the all of the changes in Apple's Mac OS X 10.3, aka "Panther". Written with humor and technical insight characteristic of

Acknowledgments
The Missing Manual series is a joint venture between Pogue Press (the dream team introduced on these pages) and 
O'Reilly & Associates (a dream publishing partner).
I'm grateful to all of them, and to AppleScript genius Bill Briggs for his help on Chapter 7; O'Reilly's Chris Stone for the two 
Unix chapters; Apple's Ken Bereskin, Mike Shebanek, and Anuj Nayar for their technical assistance; to Wacom's Burt 
Holmes; and Jennifer Barber, Chuck Brandstater, John Cacciatore, Stephanie English, and Danny Marcus for their 
proofreading smarts.
And introducing...Adam Goldstein! is what movie credits would say about the gifted 15-year-old who met me at a book 
signing one day...and eventually became my right-hand man. He wrote this book's discussions of FileVault, journaling, and 
the new Disk Restore feature; revised the Mail chapter; and polished many other discussions to a shine. You'll be hearing a 
lot more from this guy.
Thanks to David Rogelberg for believing in the idea, and above all, to Jennifer, Kelly, and Tia, who make these books—and 
everything else—possible.
—David Pogue

Introduction
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Introduction
Without a doubt, Mac OS X is a stunning technical achievement. In fact, many tech reviewers and experts have called it the 
best personal-computer operating system on earth. But beware its name.
The X is meant to be a Roman numeral, pronounced "ten." Unfortunately, many people see "Mac OS X" and say "Mac O.S. 
ex." That's a sure way to get funny looks in public.
Then there's the "Mac OS" part—what a misnomer! Mac OS X is not, in fact, what millions of people think of as the Mac 
OS. Apple designed Mac OS X to look something like the old Mac system software, and certain features have been written 
to work like they used to. But all of that is just an elaborate fake-out. Mac OS X is an utterly new creation. It's not so much 
Mac OS X, in other words, as Steve Jobs 1.0.
If you've never used a computer before, none of this matters. You have nothing to unlearn. You'll find an extremely simple, 
beautifully designed desktop waiting for you.
But if you're one of the millions of people who have grown accustomed to Windows or the traditional Mac OS, Mac OS X 
may come as a bit of a shock. Hundreds of features you thought you knew have been removed, replaced, or relocated. (If 
you ever find yourself groping for an old, favorite feature, see Appendix C and Appendix D—the "Where'd it go?" 
dictionaries for Mac OS 9 and Windows refugees.)
Why did Apple throw out the operating system that made it famous to begin with? Well, through the years, as Apple piled 
new features onto a software foundation originally poured in 1984, performing nips and tucks to the ancient software to 
make it resemble something modern, the original foundation was beginning to creak. Programmers (and some users) 
complained of the "spaghetti code" that the Mac OS had become.
Apple felt that there wasn't much point in undertaking a dramatic system-software overhaul if they couldn't master every key 
feature of modern computer technology in the process, especially crash-proofness. Starting from scratch—and jettisoning 
the system software we'd come to know over the years—was the only way to do it.
The result is an operating system that provides a liberating sense of freedom and stability—but one that, for existing 
computer fans, requires a good deal of learning (and forgetting).

What's New in Panther

What's New in Panther
The main thing you gain by adopting Mac OS X is stability. You and your Mac may go for years without ever witnessing a 
system crash. Oh, it's technically possible for Mac OS X to crash, but that's an extremely rare event. Rumors of such 
crashes circulate on the Internet like Bigfoot sightings. (If it happens to you, chances are good you've got a flaky hardware 
add-on. Turn promptly to Appendix B And by the way: Your programs may crash, too, but that doesn't affect the Mac 
overall. You just reopen the program and carry on.)
Underneath the gorgeous, translucent desktop of Mac OS X is Unix, the industrial-strength, rock-solid OS that drives many 
a Web site and university. It's not new by any means; in fact, it's decades old, and has been polished by generations of 
programmers. That's the very reason Steve Jobs and his team chose it as the basis for the NeXT operating system (which 
Jobs worked on during his twelve years away from Apple), which Apple bought in 1997 to turn into Mac OS X.
But crash resistance is only the big-ticket item. The list below identifies a few of the key enhancements in Panther. (Apple 
says it added 150 new features to Mac OS X 10.3. The truth is, Apple undercounted.)
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
All About "Panther" 
What's this business about Panther? 
Most software companies develop their wares in secret, using code names to refer to new products to throw 
outsiders off the scent. Apple's code names for Mac OS X and its descendants have been named after big 
cats: Mac OS X was Cheetah, 10.1 was Puma, and 10.2 was Jaguar.
Usually, the code name is dropped as soon as the product is complete, whereupon the marketing department 
gives it a new name. In Mac OS X 10.3's case, though, Apple thought that its cat names was cool enough to 
retain for the finished product. It even seems to suggest the new system's speed and power.
You do have to wonder what Apple plans to call future versions. Apple increases only the decimal point with 
each major upgrade, which means it has six big cats to go before it hits Mac OS XI.
Let's see: Bobcat, Cougar, Leopard, Lion...Tiger...um... Ocelot?
G     Desktop features. Mac OS X in general makes navigating disks and folders extremely easy, thanks to features 
like the Dock, the Finder-window toolbar, and column view, which lets you burrow deeply into nested folders 
without leaving a trail of open windows.
In version 10.3, the Finder achieves maturity, turning from a squeaky-voiced teenager to a star college athlete. It's 
faster than previous versions of Mac OS X, for starters. The new Sidebar is a huge idea. It eliminates much folder 
navigation altogether, because one click reveals the contents of any frequently used folder or disk you park there.
Other new touches include color labels that you can use to categorize your icons, a brushed-metal look for all disk 
and folder windows, and an Action pop-up menu (shaped like a gear) that brings the power of contextual (Control-

key) menus to people who didn't even know they existed.
G     Security. In an age when viruses and hackers are taking all the fun out of PCs, it's great to be on Mac OS X. To 
date, not a single Mac OS X virus has emerged—partly because the Mac represents a smaller "audience" for virus 
writers, and partly because the Mac's technical plumbing is more difficult to penetrate.
In Panther, Apple has capitalized on Mac OS X's reputation for security by adding Secure Empty Trash (which 
deletes files you've put into the Trash, then scrubs the spot on the hard disk seven times with random gibberish to 
prevent recovery); FileVault (which encrypts your Home folder when you log out, so that nobody can access your 
files by restarting from another disk); and a new feature that closes down your account after a specified period of 
inactivity (so that the guy in the next cubicle can't rifle through your stuff when you step away to the bathroom).
G     Timesavers. You no longer have to close out your account if somebody else in your family, school, or business 
wants to duck in to check their own email. Thanks to Fast User Switching, you can keep your programs and 
documents open in the background, even while somebody else logs in.
UP TO SPEED
Extremely Quartz 
When you use Fast User Switching to change accounts, your entire screen appears to rotate off the 
monitor to the left, as though it's on the face of a giant cube.
You're witnessing Mac OS X's powerful graphics technologies at work—Quartz Extreme (for two-
dimensional graphics) and OpenGL (for three-dimensional graphics). These are the same 
technologies that give you smooth-looking (antialiased) lettering everywhere on the screen, 
translucence (of open menus, the Dock, and other onscreen elements), smoothly crossfading 
slideshows in iPhoto and the screen saver, and the ability to turn any document on the screen into an 
Adobe Acrobat (PDF) file (Section 13.6).
Quartz Extreme works by offloading graphics calculations to your Mac's video card to make them even 
faster.
Note, though, that not all Macs benefit from Quartz Extreme. Your Mac's video card must be on The 
List: GeForce2 MX, GeForce3, GeForce4 MX, and GeForce4 Ti cards, or any "AGP-based ATI 
Radeon" card. Unfortunately, this list excludes colored iBook models, the white iBooks sold in 2001 
and 2002, G3 desktops, early G4 desktops, some fruitcolored iMac models, and older PowerBooks.
Exposé is another important advance in navigating today's cluttered screens. It provides a single keystroke that 
shrinks and arranges all windows in all programs, so that you can click the thumbnail miniature you want and bring 
it to the front. (As you'll find out in Section 4.3, it's nothing like the Tile command in Windows.) Another Exposé 
keystroke shoves all open windows off to the edges of the screen for a moment, so that you can duck back to your 
Finder desktop to create a folder, burn a CD, locate a file, and so on.

Mac OS X: The Buzzword-Compliant Operating System 
You can't read an article about Mac OS X without hearing certain technical buzzwords that were once 
exclusively the domain of computer engineers. Apple is understandably proud that Mac OS X offers all 
of these sophisticated, state-of-the-art operating system features. Unfortunately, publicizing them 
means exposing the rest of us to a lot of fairly unnecessary geek terms. Here's what they mean:
Preemptive multitasking. Most people know that multitasking means "doing more than one thing at 
once." The Mac has always been capable of making a printout, downloading a file, and letting you 
type away in a word processor, all at the same time.
Unfortunately, the Mac OS 7/8/9 (and Windows 95/98/Me) version of multitasking works by the rule of 
the playground: the bully gets what he wants. If one of your programs insists on hogging the attention 
of your Mac's processor (because it's crashing, for example), it leaves the other programs gasping for 
breath. This arrangement is called cooperative multitasking. Clearly, it works only if your programs are 
in fact cooperating with each other.
Mac OS X's preemptive multitasking system brings a teacher to the playground to make sure that 
every program gets a fair amount of time from the Mac's processor. The result is that the programs get 
along much better, and a poorly written or crashing program isn't permitted to send the other ones 
home crying.
Multithreading. Multithreading means "doing more than one thing at once," too, but in this case it's 
referring to a single program. Even while iMovie is rendering (processing) a special effect, for 
example, it lets you continue editing at the same time. Not all Mac OS 9 programs offered this feature, 
but all programs written especially for Mac OS X do. (Note, however, that programs that are simply 
adapted for Mac OS X—"Carbonized" software, as described in Section 4.8—don't necessarily offer 
this feature.)
Symmetrical multiprocessing. Macs containing more than one processor chip are nothing new. But 
before Mac OS X, only specially written software—Adobe Photoshop filters, for example—benefited 
from the speed boost.
No more. Mac OS X automatically capitalizes on multiple processors, sharing the workload of multiple 
programs (or even multithreaded tasks within a single program), meaning that every Mac OS X 
program gets accelerated. Mac OS X is smart enough to dole out processing tasks evenly, so that 
both (or all) of your processors are being put to productive use.
Dynamic memory allocation. Mac OS X programs don't have fixed RAM allotments. The operating 
system giveth and taketh away your programs' memory in real time, so that no RAM is wasted. For 
you, this system means better stability, less hassle.
Memory protection. In Mac OS X, every program runs in its own indestructible memory bubble—
another reason Mac OS X is so much more stable than its predecessors. If one program crashes, it 
isn't allowed to poison the well of RAM that other programs might want to use. Programs may still 
freeze or quit unexpectedly; the world will never be entirely free of sloppy programmers. But instead of 
a message that says, "Save open documents and restart," you'll be delighted to find that you can go 
right on working. You can even open up the program that just died and pick up right where you left off.

What's New in Panther
You can now send and receive faxes right from the Mac, too, using Apple's first homegrown, fully integrated faxing 
software.
G     Networking. When it comes to hooking up your Mac to other computers, including those on the Internet, few 
operating systems can match Mac OS X. It offers advanced features like multihoming, which keeps all networking 
connections (via Ethernet cable, AirPort wireless card, dial-up modem, Bluetooth cellphone, and even Firewire 
cable) open simultaneously. For laptop lovers, that means that your laptop can switch automatically and invisibly 
from its cable modem settings to its dial-up modem settings when you take it on the road.
In Mac OS X 10.3, you can still connect to another networked computer using the Go
Connect to Server 
command. But there's a far easier way now: Just click the Network icon in the Sidebar. It reveals all of the Macs 
and PCs on your home, school, or office network, without your having to configure anything or know their 
addresses.
G     Accessory programs. Perhaps the least publicized new Panther feature is the set of upgrades Apple made to the 
50 accessory programs that come with the Mac.
For example, iChat AV (ordinarily $30) comes with Panther, making it possible for you to conduct free long-
distance phone calls and even video calls over the Internet. A new program called Font Book acts like a junior 
version of Font Reserve or Suitcase; it reveals all of your fonts, makes it simple to install or remove them, and lets 
you switch off sets of fonts at will.
The TextEdit word processor now offers style sheets, and it can create and open full-fledged, true-blue Microsoft 
Word documents. Preview, which began life as a humble graphics viewer/converter, is now a fast, powerful PDF 
reader like Adobe Acrobat Reader (which no longer comes with Mac OS X).
Image Capture can operate Epson scanners and many others—and it offers a mind-blowing new spycam feature 
using an ordinary digital camera. The Mail email program and Safari Web browser have been beefed up, too. And 
the humble Calculator now has a graphing mode, although you have to unlock it yourself, as described in Chapter 
9.
The complete list of changes in Mac OS X 10.3 would fill a book—in fact, you're holding it. But some of the nicest changes 
aren't so much new features as renewals. Panther comes with an even more full-blown collection of printer drivers, for 
example, and the latest versions of its underlying Unix security and Internet software.

About This Book
By way of a printed guide to Mac OS X, Apple provides only a flimsy "getting started" booklet. To find your way around, 
you're expected to use Apple's online help system. And as you'll quickly discover, these help pages are tersely written, offer 
very little technical depth, lack useful examples, provide no tutorials whatsoever, and aren't accessible at all unless you're 
online. You can't even mark your place, underline, or read it in the bathroom.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
What Mac OS X Takes Away
If you're coming to Mac OS X from Mac OS 9, you don't just have to learn about new features; you also have 
to unlearn a good deal of what you worked so hard to master in the older system.
Fortunately, most of the obsolete practices are troubleshooting rituals. For example:
Extension conflicts. The number one destabilizing factor of the traditional Macintosh has been banished 
forever: Mac OS X doesn't use system extensions and control panels. You will never again perform an 
extension conflict test, trying to figure out which extension is making your Mac freeze. None of those habitual 
routines has any meaning in Mac OS X.
Software companies can still add new features to your Mac, just as they once did using extensions. But most 
do it now by writing startup applications, which is a much safer, more organized method that doesn't 
destabilize your Mac.
Memory controls. There's no Memory control panel in Mac OS X. Nor does the Get Info window for Mac OS 
X programs include a place to change its memory allotment. This is great news.
Mac OS X manages memory quickly, intelligently, and constantly. The reason you don't allot a certain amount 
of your Mac's memory to a program, as you had to do in Mac OS 9, is that Mac OS X simply gives each 
running program as much memory as it needs. And if you undertake some task that requires more memory, 
Mac OS X instantly gives that program more memory on the fly.
So what happens if you're running 125 programs at once? Mac OS X uses virtual memory, a scheme by 
which it lays down pieces of the programs running in the background onto your hard drive, so that it may 
devote your actual RAM to the programs in front. However, this virtual memory scheme bears very little 
relationship to the relatively crude, slow virtual memory of the old Mac OS. In Mac OS X, this shuffling 
happens almost instantaneously, and virtual memory is called in only to park pieces of applications as 
necessary.
The bottom line: You can forget everything you knew about concepts like virtual memory, the Disk Cache, the 
Get Info window's memory boxes for applications, and the panic of getting out-of-memory messages. For the 
most part, they're gone forever.
Rebuilding the desktop. Mac OS X doesn't have the unfortunate habit of holding onto the icons (in its 
internal database) of programs long since deleted from your hard drive. As a result, you never have to rebuild 
that desktop, and you'll never see the symptoms that suggest that it's time for desktop rebuilding (a general 
slowdown and generic icons replacing the usual custom ones).

About This Book
The 
 a menu and Application menu. The menus at the upper corners of the screen, which used to 
anchor the Mac desktop experience, have been eliminated or changed in Mac OS X. The Dock takes on their 
functions.
You'll still find an 
 a menu in Mac OS X, but it's no longer a place to store aliases of your favorite files and 
folders. Instead, it lists commands like Restart and Shut Down, which are relevant no matter what program 
you're using.
The Control Strip. This handy floating strip of tiles is gone, too. Its replacement is the set of menulets in the 
upper-right corner of the screen, on the menu bar. This is now where you make quick control panel settings, 
like adjusting the volume, checking your laptop battery charge, and so on.
Finally, remember that some features aren't actually gone—they've just been moved. Before you panic, 
consult Appendix C for a neat, alphabetical list of every traditional Mac feature and its status in the new 
operating system.
The purpose of this book, then, is to serve as the manual that should have accompanied Mac OS X—version 10.3 in 
particular.
You won't find a single page that hasn't changed since the last edition. Not only are the new Panther features covered in 
depth, but you'll also find a great deal of refinement in the discussions of original Mac OS X features: more tips and tricks, 
clever uses for old ideas, and greater context borne of the passage of time.
Thousands of email suggestions have resulted in these changes, too:
G     Writing for a wider audience. These days, not everyone who uses Mac OS X has a background in Mac OS 9. 
More and more people come from Windows or a previous version of Mac OS X, or have never even used a 
computer before. This book, therefore, tones down the "Mac OS 9 did it this way, Mac OS X does it this way" 
language of previous editions. (Where comparisons are necessary, look for detailed discussions in shaded boxes 
labeled Nostalgia Corner.)
G     Mini-manuals. Some of the programs that come with Mac OS X, like iMovie, iDVD, and iTunes, are subjects of 
their own Missing Manual books.
It annoyed some readers of this book's previous editions, though, that Mac OS X: The Missing Manual didn't cover 
those programs at all. In this edition, therefore, you'll find new mini-manuals that provide crash courses in iMovie, 
iDVD, iPhoto, and Safari (not to mention updated coverage of the other 45 freebie Mac OS X programs).
Mac OS X: The Missing Manual is designed to accommodate readers at every technical level. The primary discussions are 
written for advanced-beginner or intermediate Mac users. But if you're a first-time Mac user, miniature sidebar articles 
called Up to Speed provide the introductory information you need to understand the topic at hand. If you're an advanced 
Mac user, on the other hand, keep your eye out for similar shaded boxes called Power Users' Clinic. They offer more 
technical tips, tricks, and shortcuts for the more experienced Mac fan.
0.2.1 About the Outline
Mac OS X: The Missing Manual is divided into six parts, each containing several chapters:

About This Book
G     Part I, The Mac OS X Desktop, covers everything you see on the screen when you turn on a Mac OS X computer: 
the Dock, the sidebar, Exposé, icons, windows, menus, scroll bars, the Trash, aliases, the 
 menu, and so on.
G     Part II, Applications in Mac OS X, is dedicated to the proposition that an operating system is little more than a 
launch pad for programs—the actual applications you use in your everyday work, such as email programs, Web 
browsers, word processors, graphics suites, and so on. These chapters describe how to work with applications in 
Mac OS X: how to launch them, switch among them, swap data between them, use them to create and open files, 
and control them using the AppleScript automation software. This is also where you can find out about using your 
old, pre-Mac OS X programs in the Classic program.
G     Part III, The Components of Mac OS X, is an item-by-item discussion of the individual software nuggets that make 
up this operating system—the 24 panels of System Preferences, and the 50 programs in your Applications and 
Utilities folders.
G     Part IV, The Technologies of Mac OS X, treads in more advanced topics. Networking, dialing into your Mac from 
the road, security, and setting up private accounts for people who share a single Mac are, of course, tasks Mac OS 
X was born to do. These chapters cover all of the above, plus the prodigious visual talents of Mac OS X (fonts, 
printing, graphics, handwriting recognition), its multimedia gifts (sound, speech, movies), and the Unix beneath.
G     Part V, Mac OS X Online, covers all the special Internet-related features of Mac OS X, including the built-in Mail 
email program and the Safari Web browser; the Sherlock Web-searching program; iChat for instant-messaging and 
audio or video chats; iCal for keeping and sharing your calendar; iSync for keeping your phone book and address 
book synchronized across Macs, cellphones, iPods, and PalmPilots; Web sharing; Internet sharing; the firewall; 
and Apple's online .Mac services (which include email accounts, secure file-backup features, Web hosting, and so 
on). If you're feeling particularly advanced, you'll also find instructions on using Mac OS X's Unix underpinnings for 
connecting to, and controlling, your Mac from across the wires—FTP, SSH, VPN, and so on.
At the end of the book, you'll find several appendixes. They include two "Where'd it go?" listings, one for traditional Mac 
features and another for Windows features (to help you find their new locations in Mac OS X); guidance in installing this 
operating system; a troubleshooting handbook; and a list of resources for further study.

About 
 These 
 Arrows
Throughout this book, and throughout the Missing Manual series, you'll find sentences like this one: "Open the System 
folder
Libraries
Fonts folder." That's shorthand for a much longer instruction that directs you to open three nested 
folders in sequence, like this: "On your hard drive, you'll find a folder called System. Open that. Inside the System folder 
window is a folder called Libraries; double-click it to open it. Inside that folder is yet another one called Fonts. Double-click 
to open it, too."
Similarly, this kind of arrow shorthand helps to simplify the business of choosing commands in menus, such as a 
Dock
Position on Left, as shown in Figure I-1.

To get the most out of this book, visit www.missingmanuals.com . Click the "Missing CD-ROM" link to reveal a neat, 
organized, chapter-by-chapter list of the shareware and freeware mentioned in this book. (As noted on the inside back 
cover, having the software online instead of on a CD-ROM saved you $5 on the cost of the book.)
But the Web site also offers corrections and updates to the book (to see them, click the book's title, then click Errata). In 
fact, you're invited and encouraged to submit such corrections and updates yourself. In an effort to keep the book as up-to-
date and accurate as possible, each time we print more copies of this book, we'll make any confirmed corrections you've 
suggested. We'll also note such changes on the Web site, so that you can mark important corrections into your own copy of 
the book, if you like. And we'll keep the book current as Apple releases more Mac OS X 10.3 updates.
In the meantime, we'd love to hear your own suggestions for new books in the Missing Manual line. There's a place for that 
on the Web site, too, as well as a place to sign up for free email notification of new titles in the series.
In this book, arrow notations help to simplify folder and menu instructions. For example, 
"Choose a
Dock
Position on Left" is a more compact way of saying, "From the a menu, 
choose Dock; from the submenu that than appears, choose Position on Left," as shown here.

The Very Basics
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
The Very Basics
To use this book, and indeed to use a Macintosh computer, you need to know a few basics. This book assumes that you're 
familiar with a few terms and concepts:
G     Clicking. This book gives you three kinds of instructions that require you to use the mouse that's attached to your 
Mac. To click means to point the arrow cursor at something on the screen and then—without moving the cursor at 
all—press and release the clicker button on the mouse (or your laptop trackpad). To doubleclick, of course, means 
to click twice in rapid succession, again without moving the cursor at all. And to drag means to move the cursor 
while holding down the button.
When you're told to 
-click something, you click while pressing the 
 key (which is next to the Space bar). Such 
related procedures as Shift-clicking, Option-clicking, and Control-clicking work the same way—just click while 
pressing the corresponding key at the bottom of your keyboard.
G     Menus. The menus are the words at the top of your screen: File, Edit, and so on. (The 
 at the top left corner of 
your screen is a menu, too.) Click one to make a list of commands appear, as though they're written on a window 
shade you've just pulled down.
Some people click and release the mouse button to open a menu and then, after reading the menu command 
choices, click again on the one they want. Other people like to press the mouse button continuously after the initial 
click on the menu title, drag down the list to the desired command, and only then release the mouse button. Either 
method works fine.
G     Keyboard shortcuts. If you're typing along in a burst of creative energy, it's sometimes disruptive to have to take 
your hand off the keyboard, grab the mouse, and then use a menu (for example, to use the Bold command). That's 
why many experienced Mac fans prefer to trigger menu commands by pressing certain combinations on the 
keyboard. For example, in most word processors, you can press 
-B to produce a boldface word. When you 
read an instruction like "press 
-B," start by pressing the 
 key, then, while it's down, type the letter B, and 
finally release both keys.
G     Icons. The colorful inch-tall pictures that appear in your various desktop folders are the graphic symbols that 
represent each program, disk, and document on your computer. If you click an icon one time, it darkens indicating 
that you've just highlighted or selected. Now you're ready to manipulate it by using, for example, a menu command.
Mastering Mac OS X involves knowing what things are called, especially the kinds of controls 
you find in dialog boxes.
Note, by the way, that as part of Panther's visual redesign, the dialog-box subdivisions called 
tabs are still called tabs, even though they now resemble adjacent buttons.

The Very Basics
 
G     Checkboxes, radio buttons, tabs. See Figure I-2 for a quick visual reference to the onscreen controls you're most 
often asked to use.
If you've mastered this much information, you have all the technical background you need to enjoy Mac OS X: The Missing 
Manual. 
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Version 10.3.1 and Beyond 
Only a few weeks after the debut of Mac OS X 10.3, Apple began its traditional flood of system updates. 
These multimegabyte installers patch holes, fix bugs, improve compatibility with external gadgets, and make 
the whole system work more smoothly.
Version 10.3.1, for example, introduced a long list of bug fixes in several broad categories, most notably a 
serious problem with FileVault that could corrupt your files. There were also fixes in printing and connecting to 
external FireWire 800 drives.
Only a few weeks later, 10.3.2 came out, offering faster and more refined file sharing, font management, USB, 
and text and graphics display, with even more attention to fixing FileVault problems.

The Very Basics
 
You don't have to go out of your way to get these updates: One day you'll be online with your Mac, and a 
Software Update dialog box will appear before you, offering you the chance to download and install the patch. 
Almost always, doing so is a good idea.
As for the differences between the "first decimal point" versions of Mac OS X: You'll find this book useful no 
matter which version you have, but it describes and illustrates version 10.3 and later. If you're still working 
with 10.1 or 10.2, you'll probably feel most comfortable if you seek out the first or second edition of this book.
Or, better yet, upgrade to Panther.

1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
When you first turn on a Mac that's running Mac OS X 10.3, an Apple logo greets you, soon followed by an animated, 
liquidy blue progress bar.
Left: On Macs configured to accommodate different people at different times, this is one of the 
first things you see upon turning on the computer. Click your name. (If the list is long, you may 
have to scroll to find your name—or just type the first couple letters of it.) 
Right: At this point, you're asked to type in your password. Type it and then click Log In (or 
press Return or Enter; pressing these keys usually "clicks" any blue, pulsing button in a dialog 
box). If you've typed the wrong password, the entire dialog box vibrates, in effect shaking its 
little dialog-box head, suggesting that you guess again. (See Chapter 11.)
 
1.1.1 Logging In
What happens next depends on whether you're the Mac's sole proprietor or have to share it with other people in an office, 
school, or household.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-1.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 4:46:26 AM

1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
G     If it's your own Mac, and you've already been through the Mac OS X setup process described in Appendix A, no 
big deal. You arrive at the Mac OS X desktop.
G     If it's a shared Mac, you may encounter the Login dialog box, shown in Figure 1-1. Click your name in the list (or 
type it, if there's no list).
If the Mac asks for your password, type it and then click Log In (or press Return). You arrive at the desktop. 
Chapter 11 offers much more on this business of user accounts and logging in.
1.1.2 The Elements of the Mac OS X Desktop
The desktop is the shimmering, three-dimensional Mac OS X landscape shown in Figure 1-2. If you're coming to Panther 
from Mac OS 9 or Windows, don't panic. Most of the objects on your screen are nothing more than updated versions of 
familiar elements. Here's a quick tour.
NOTE
If your desktop looks even barer than this—no menus, no icons, almost nothing on the Dock—then 
somebody in charge of your Mac has turned on Simple Finder mode for you. Details in Section 11.3.4.3.
The Mac OS X landscape looks like a futuristic version of Windows or the Mac OS. This is just a 
starting point, however. You can dress it up with a different background picture, adjust your 
windows in a million ways, and of course fill the Dock with only the programs, disks, folders, 
and files you need.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-1.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:46:26 AM

1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
 
1.1.2.1 Disk icons
Here they are, just where they've always been: the icons of your hard drive and any other disks attached to your Mac. 
Double-click to open one, as always.
You may notice that icons in Mac OS X are much larger than they were in previous operating systems. You can make them 
almost any size you like, but Apple made them bigger for two reasons. First, in this era of monitors with ever larger 
resolution, the icons on our screens have been getting ever smaller and harder to see.
Second, Apple thinks its Mac OS X icons look really cool.
1.1.2.2 The Dock
This ribbon of translucent, almost photographic icons is a launcher for the programs, files, folders, and disks you use often—
and an indicator to let you know which programs are already open.
In principle, the Dock is very simple:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-1.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 4:46:26 AM

1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
G     Programs go on the left side. Everything else goes on the right, including documents, folders, and disks. (Figure 
1-2 shows the dividing line.)
G     You can add a new icon to the Dock by dragging it there. Rearrange Dock icons by dragging them like tiles on 
a puzzle. Remove a Dock icon by dragging it away from the Dock, and enjoy the animated puff of smoke that 
appears when you release the mouse button. (You can't remove the icon of a program that's currently open, 
however.)
G     Click something once to open it. A tiny triangle underneath a program's icon lets you know that it's open.
G     Each Dock icon sprouts a pop-up menu. For example, a folder's icon can show you what's inside it. To see the 
menu, hold the mouse button down on a Dock icon, or Control-click it, or right-click it (if you have a two-button 
mouse).
Because the Dock is such a critical component of Mac OS X, Apple has decked it out with enough customization controls to 
keep you busy experimenting for months. You can change its size, move it to the sides of your screen, hide it entirely, and 
so on. Chapter 3 contains complete instructions for using and understanding the Dock.
1.1.2.3 The 
 menu
The 
 menu houses important Mac-wide commands like Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down. In Mac OS X, this menu never 
changes; it looks the same on every Mac OS X computer in the world. That's why Mac-wide commands like Sleep, Restart, 
and Shut Down are here: so that they'll always be available, no matter which program you're using.
1.1.2.4 The menu bar
Every popular operating system saves space by concealing its most important commands in menus that drop down. Mac 
OS X's menus are especially refined:
G     They're translucent. You can actually see through an open menu to whatever window is beneath. This feature 
doesn't particularly help you—in fact, critics claim that it makes the commands in the menu harder to read. But only 
an operating system with graphics software as powerful as Mac OS X's could even pull off such a sophisticated 
graphics treat. Consider translucent menus a bit of showoff-ware.
G     They stay down. For years, Macintosh menus remained open for only 15 seconds before snapping closed again. 
That's because when a menu was open, all other Macintosh activity stopped.
Mac OS X, however, is multithreaded, which means that it's perfectly capable of carrying on with its background 
activities while you study its open, translucent menus. Therefore, Mac OS X menus stay open until you click the 
mouse, press a key, or buy a new computer, whichever comes first.
G     They've been rearranged. The first menu in every program, which appears in bold lettering, tells you at a glance 
what program you're in. The commands in this Application menu include About (which indicates what version of the 
program you're using), Preferences, Quit, and commands like Hide Others and Show All (which help control 
window clutter, as described in Section 4.4).
In short, all of the Application menu's commands actually pertain to the application you're using.
The File and Edit menus come next. As in the past, the File menu contains commands for opening, saving, and 
closing files (see the logic?). The Edit menu contains the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands.
The last menu is almost always Help. It opens a miniature Web browser that lets you search the online Mac Help 
files for explanatory text (Section 1.8).
G     You can operate them from the keyboard. Once you've clicked open a menu, you can highlight any command in 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-1.html (4 of 5)5/3/2004 4:46:26 AM

1.1 Getting into Mac OS X
it just by typing the first letter (g for Get Info, for example)—a nifty and unheralded enhancement in Mac OS X 10.3. 
(It's especially great for "Your country" pop-up menus on Web sites, where "United States" is about 200 countries 
down in the list. Now you can type united s to jump right to it.)
You can also press Tab to open the next menu, Shift-Tab to open the previous one, and Enter to "click" the 
highlighted command.
All that's left is figuring out a way to open the menu from the keyboard to start the process (details in Section 4.6).
Otherwise, aside from the new typeface (Lucida Grande), the menu bar looks and works much as it has in operating 
systems past.

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
In designing Mac OS X, one of Apple's key goals was to address the window-proliferation problem. As you create more 
files, stash them in more folders, and launch more programs, it's easy to wind up paralyzed before a screen awash with 
cluttered, overlapping rectangles.
Mac OS X 10.3 takes a giant leap into the realm of tidiness by introducing Exposé, an innovative and useful feature that's 
probably worth at least $34 of Mac OS X's $130 price. It's described in detail in Section 4.3 
There are some handy clutter and navigation controls on the windows themselves, too. For example:
1.2.1 The Sidebar
Man, if this new Panther feature didn't hit you in the first 30 seconds, then your monitor must not be on.
The Sidebar is the pane at the left side of every Finder window (and, as you'll find out in Chapter 4, also at the left side of 
every full-sized Save and Open dialog box). It lists places where you might look for files and folders—that is, disks, folders, 
and network disks. Above the horizontal divider, you get the icons for your hard drives, iPods, memory cards, CDs, and 
other removable goodies. Below the divider, you can stick the icons of anything else: files, programs, folders, or whatever.
The Sidebar makes navigation very quick, because you can jump back and forth between 
distant corners of your Mac with a single click.
In column view, the Sidebar is especially handy because it eliminates all of the columns to the 
left of the one you want, all the way back to your hard-drive level. You've just folded up your 
desktop!
Good things to put here: Favorite programs; disks on the network to which you often connect; 
a document you're working on every day; and so on.
Folder and disk icons here work just like normal ones. You can drag a document onto a folder 
icon to file it there, drag a downloaded .sit file onto the StuffIt Expander icon there, and so on.
In fact, the disks and folders here are even spring-loaded (Section 2.4.3).

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
 
Each icon is a shortcut. For example, click the Applications icon to view the contents of your Applications folder in the main 
part of the window (Figure 1-3). And if you click the icon of a file or program, it opens.
1.2.1.1 Fine-tuning the Sidebar
The beauty of this parking lot for containers is that it's so easy to set up with your favorite places. For example:
G     Remove an icon by dragging it out of the window entirely. It vanishes with a puff of smoke (and even a little whoof 
sound effect). Needless to say, you haven't actually removed anything from your Mac; you've just unhitched its 
alias from the Sidebar.

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
Don't be in a hurry to remove the Network icon. True, in previous versions of Mac OS X, it 
revealed nothing, even if you had set up a home or small-office network. (It was intended 
only for big corporations.) But in Panther, clicking this icon reveals the icons of all other Macs 
and Windows PCs on the network. See Chapter 12.
G     Rearrange the icons by dragging them up or down in the list.
G     Install a new icon by dragging it off of your desktop (or out of a window) into any spot in the appropriate half of the 
Sidebar: disks above the divider bar, everything else below.
You can also highlight an icon wherever it happens to be and then choose File
 Add to Sidebar, or just press 
-T.
G     Adjust the width of the Sidebar by dragging the vertical divider bar (marked by the dot in its center) right or left. 
You'll "feel" a snap when the divider hits the spot where you're seeing all of the icon names but not wasting any 
extra white space to their right.
If you drag carefully, you can position the divider bar just to the right of the disk and folder 
icons, thereby hiding their names. Some people find it a tidier look; others miss seeing the 
text labels.
G     Hide the Sidebar entirely by double-clicking the vertical divider. The main fileand- folder-icons part of the window 
expands to exploit the freed-up space. (To bring the Sidebar back, double-click the left edge of the window; the 
telltale dot is still there to remind you.)
It's also OK to hide the Sidebar by dragging its divider bar all the way to the left edge of the window, and bring it 
back by dragging the left edge of the window to the right—but these are slower, fussier, and less satisfying than a 
good old double-click.
Then again, why would you ever want to hide the Sidebar? It's one of the handiest navigation aids since the invention of the 
steering wheel. For example:
G     It takes a lot of pressure off the Dock. Instead of filling up your Dock with folder icons (all of which are 
frustratingly alike and unlabeled anyway), use the Sidebar to store them. You leave the Dock that much more room 
for programs and documents.
G     It's better than the Dock. In some ways, the Sidebar is a lot like the Dock, in that you can stash favorite icons 
there of any sort. But one big difference is that the Sidebar reveals the names of these icons, and the Dock doesn't.
Top: How are you supposed to drag the Sir Knight file (in your Home
Pictures folder) into a 
folder that's not visible at the moment—a folder that requires navigating down a totally different 
path? You could use spring-loaded folder-dragging (Section 2.4.3), but if the two folders are 
distant, the following trick is faster.
Middle: Start by dragging the destination folder into the Sidebar (in this case, the Public
 
Drop Box folder in Bailey's home folder).

G     It makes disk-ejecting easy. Just click the 
 button next to any removable disk to make it pop out. (You can 
"eject" network disks the same way.) After 18 years, the Mac finally beats the "It's illogical to eject a disk by 
dragging it to the Trash!" (Of course, you can still eject disks in several other ways; see Section 10.1.2.)
G     It makes disc-burning easy. When you've inserted a blank CD or DVD and loaded it up with stuff you want to 
copy, click the 
 button next to its name. The Finder dutifully begins burning that disc.
G     You can drag onto its folders and disks. That is, you can still drag icons onto Places icons, exactly as though 
they were the "real" disks, folders, and programs that they represent.
G     It simplifies connecting to networked disks. Park your other computers' hard drive icons here, as described in 
Chapter 12, and you shave several steps off the usual connecting-via-network ritual.
G     It lets you drag between distant folders. See Figure 1-4 for details on this sneaky, yet highly efficient trick.
1.2.2 Title Bar
The title bar has several functions. First, when several windows are open, the darkened window name, mini-icon, and left-
corner buttons tell you which window is active (in front); in background windows, these elements appear dimmed. Second, 
the title bar—newly designed to resemble brushed aluminum in Mac OS X 10.3—acts as a handle that lets you move the 
entire window around on the screen.
Of course, that tool isn't quite so critical in Mac OS X 10.3, because you can now move Finder windows by dragging any 
"brushed-metal" edge. But it's still good to know about the title bar as a handle, because not all windows are brushed metal. 
(The Find window, for example, still bears the old, faintly pinstriped "Aqua" look—and therefore you can't drag it by its 
edges.)
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Fixing the Sidebar
If you've read the preceding paragraphs and gone on a squealing delete-fest just to see how much damage 
you could inflict on your Sidebar, it's time for a splash of cold water: Once you drag the Macintosh HD, 
Network, or Computer icon out of the top of the Sidebar, you can't drag them back in. Suddenly you're stuck 
with the orphaned horizontal divider, with nothing to divide. The top half of your list is empty.

That's why Apple gives you a quick way to restore the Sidebar to the way it came from the factory.
If you choose Finder
Preferences and then click the Sidebar button, you'll discover the checkboxes 
shown here. They let you put back the Apple-installed icons that you may have removed in haste. Just turn on 
a checkbox to restore its icon to your Sidebar.
Here's a nifty keyboard shortcut: You can cycle through the different open windows in one 
program without using the mouse. Just press 
-~ (that is, the tilde key, to the left of the 
number 1 key). With each press, you bring a different window forward within the current 
program. It works both in the Finder and in your everyday programs, and it beats the pants 
off using the mouse to choose a name from the Window menu.
After you've opened one folder that's inside another, the title bar's secret folder hierarchy menu is an efficient way to 
backtrack—to return to the enclosing window. Get in the habit of pressing the 
 key as you click the name of the window 
to access the menu shown in Figure 1-5. (You can release the 
 key immediately after clicking.)
Press 
 and click a window's title bar (top) to summon the hidden folder hierarchy menu 
(bottom). The Finder isn't the only program that offers this trick, by the way. It also works in

most other Mac OS X-compatible programs, and even many Mac OS 9 programs.
By choosing the name of a folder from this menu, you open the corresponding window. When browsing the contents of the 
Users folder, for example, you can return to the main hard drive window by 
-clicking the folder name Users and 
choosing Macintosh HD from the menu.
Keyboard lovers, take note. Instead of using this title bar menu, you can also jump to the 
enclosing window by pressing 
-up arrow, which is the shortcut for the new 
Go
Enclosing Folder command. Add the Option key if you want to switch into "Old 
Finder Mode" in the process (see Section 1.2.8).
Pressing 
-down arrow takes you back into the folder you started in, assuming that it's still 
highlighted. (This makes more sense when you try it than when you read it.)
Once you've mastered dragging, you're ready for these three terrific title bar tips:

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
G     Pressing the 
 key lets you drag the title bar area of an inactive window—one that's partly covered by a window 
in front—without bringing it to the front.
As a matter of fact, depending on the program you're clicking into, you can operate any control—resize box, 
buttons, pop-up menus, and even scroll bars—in a background window without bringing it to the front. In fact, you 
can even drag through text without bringing a window forward. In every case, just keeping 
 pressed as you click 
or drag is the secret.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The Go to Folder Command
Sometimes a Unix tentacle pokes through the user-friendly Mac OS X interface. Every now and then, 
you find a place where you can use Unix shortcuts instead of the mouse.
One classic example is the Go
Go to Folder command (Shift-
-G). It brings up a box like the 
one shown here.
The purpose of this box is to let you jump to a certain folder on your Mac directly by typing its Unix 
folder path. Depending on your point of view, this special box is either a shortcut or a detour.
For example, if you want to see what's in the Documents folder of your Home folder, you could choose 
Go
Go to Folder, type this:
  /Users/chris/Documents
Then click Go or press Return. (In this example, of course, chris is your short account name.)
 
In other words, you're telling the Mac to open the Users folder in your main hard drive window, then 
your Home folder inside that, and then the Documents folder inside that. Each slash means, "and then 
open." (You can leave off the name of your hard drive if your path begins with a slash.) When you 
press Enter, the folder you specified pops open immediately.
Of course, if you really wanted to jump to your Documents folder, you'd be wasting your time by typing 
all that. Unix (and therefore Mac OS X) offers a handy shortcut that means, "home folder." It's the tilde 
character (~) at the upper-left corner of your keyboard.
To see what's in your Home folder, then, you could type just that ~ symbol into the Go To Folder box 
and then press Return. Or you could add some slashes to it to specify a folder inside your Home 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (8 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
folder, like this:
  ~/Documents
You can even jump to someone else's Home folder by typing a name after the symbol, like this:
  ~chris
If you get into this sort of thing, here's another shortcut worth noting: If you type nothing but a slash (/) 
and then press Return, you jump immediately to the Computer window, which provides an overview of 
all your disks.
Note, too, that you don't have to type out the full path—only the part that drills down from the window 
you're in. If your Home folder window is already open, for example, you can open the Pictures folder 
just by typing Pictures.
But the Go to Folder trick really turns into a high-octane timesaver if you use auto completion. Here's 
how it works: After each slash, you can type only enough letters of a folder's name to give Mac OS X 
the idea—de instead of desktop, for example—and then wait a fraction of a second (or, if you're late 
for a plane, press the Tab key). Mac OS X instantly and automatically fills in the rest of the folder's 
name. It even auto-capitalizes the folder names for you (in Unix, capitalization matters).
For example, instead of typing /applications/Microsoft Office X/clipart/standard, you could type nothing 
more than /ap/mi/cl/st, remembering to press Tab after each pair of letters. Now that's a way to feel 
like a Unix programmer.
NOTE
Only Cocoa programs, as described in Section 4.8, offer the full range of 
-clickable controls. In 
general, programs that have simply been Carbonized respond only to 
-clicking title-bar elements.
By the way, you can always close, minimize, or zoom a background window without the help of the 
 key. Just 
click its title bar buttons normally. Mac OS X does its thing without taking you out of your current window or 
program.
G     One more title bar trick: By double-clicking the title bar area, you minimize the window, making it collapse into the 
Dock exactly as though you had clicked the minimize button (assuming you haven't turned off this feature in 
System Preferences, of course).
G     The Option key means "apply this action to all windows." For example, Optiondouble- clicking any title bar 
minimizes all desktop windows, sending them flying to the Dock.
1.2.3 Close Button
As the tip of your cursor crosses the three buttons at the upper-left corner of a window, tiny symbols appear inside them: x, 
-, and +. Ignore the gossip that these symbols were added to help color-blind people who can't distinguish the colors red, 
yellow, and green; color-blind people are perfectly capable of distinguishing the buttons by their positions, just as they do 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (9 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
with traffic lights.
Instead, these cues appear to distinguish the buttons when all three are identical shades of gray, as they are when you use 
Graphite mode (Section 8.4). They also signal you when it's time to click. For example, as described in the previous 
section, you can use these three buttons even when the window is not frontmost. You know the buttons are ripe for the 
clicking when you see the little symbols appear under your cursor.
The most important window gadget is the close button, the red, droplet-like button in the upper-left corner (see Figure 1-6). 
Clicking it closes the window, which collapses back into the icon from which it came.
If, while working on a document, you see a tiny dot in the center of the close button, Mac OS 
X is trying to tell you that you haven't yet saved your work. The dot goes away when you 
save the document.
The universal keyboard equivalent of the close button is 
-W (for window)—a keystroke well worth memorizing. If you get 
into the habit of dismissing windows with that deft flex of your left hand, you'll find it far easier to close several windows in a 
row, because you don't have to aim for successive close buttons.
In many programs, something special happens if you're pressing the Option key when using the close button or its 
-W 
equivalent: You close all open windows. This trick is especially useful in the Finder, where a quest for a particular document 
may have left your screen plastered with open windows for which you have no further use. Option-clicking the close button 
of any one window (or pressing Option-
-W) closes all of them.
When Steve Jobs unveiled Mac OS X at a Macworld Expo in 1999, he said that his goal was to 
oversee the creation of an interface so attractive, "you just want to lick it." Desktop windows, 
with their juicy, fruit-flavored controls, are a good starting point.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (10 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
 
On the other hand, the Option-key trick doesn't close all windows in every program —only those in the current program. 
Option-closing an AppleWorks document closes all AppleWorks windows, but your Finder windows remain open.
Moreover, Option-closing works only in enlightened applications, such as AppleWorks, Quicken, and the Finder. (In this 
department, Microsoft is not yet enlightened.)
1.2.4 Minimize Button
Click this yellow drop of gel to minimize any Mac window, sending it shrinking, with a genie-like animated effect, into the 
right end of the Dock, where it then appears as an icon. The window isn't gone, and it hasn't even closed. It's just out of 
your way for the moment, as though you've set it down on a shelf. To bring it back, click the newly created Dock icon (see 
Figure 1-7, as well as Chapter 3 for more on the Dock).
Minimizing a window in this way is a great window management tool. In the Finder, minimizing a window lets you see 
whatever icons were hiding behind it. In a word processor, this technique lets you type a memo that requires frequent 
consultation of a spreadsheet behind it.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (11 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
If you enjoy the ability to roll up your windows in this way, remember that you actually have a 
bigger target than the tiny minimize button. The entire title bar becomes a giant minimize 
button when you double-click anywhere on it. (That's an option in the Appearance panel of 
System Preferences, described in Chapter 8.)
Better yet, you can also minimize the frontmost window of almost any program (including the 
Finder) from the keyboard by pressing 
-M. That's a keystroke worth memorizing on Day 
One.
Clicking the minimize button sends a window scurrying down to the Dock, collapsing in on 
itself as though being forced through a tiny, invisible funnel. A tiny icon appears on the lower-
right corner of its minimized image to identify the program it's running in.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Adjusting the Genie Speed
Apple has a name for the animation you see when you minimize, open, or close a window: the genie effect, 
because it so closely resembles the way Barbara Eden, Robin Williams, and other TV and movie genies 
entered and exited their magic lamps and bottles.
But you don't have to watch the "genie" animation precisely the same way, day in and day out. You can slow 
it down or speed it up like this:
Slow it down. Whenever Steve Jobs does a Mac OS X demo, one of his favorite bits is slowing down the 
animation so that we can see it in all its graceful, slow motion. How does he do that?
If you Shift-click a window's minimize button, it collapses into the Dock at about one-fifth its usual speed—an 
effect sure to produce gasps from the onlookers. The Shift key also slows the un-minimizing animation, the 
one you see when you click a window icon in the dock to restore it to full size.
Speed it up. There's no keystroke for making the animation go faster. You can, however, substitute a faster 
style of minimizing animation.
To do so, choose 
Dock
Dock Preferences. From the "Minimize using" pop-up menu, choose 
Scale Effect, and then close the window. Now, instead of collapsing through an invisible funnel, minimized 
windows simply shrink as they fly down to the dock, remaining rectangular, requiring less computing by Mac 
OS X and therefore taking less than a second to disappear.
(Actually, there's a third animation style, too, but you need the freeware in Section 17.1 to unleash it.)
The minimize button harbors only one hidden feature, but it's very entertaining. If you Option-click it, all windows in the 
current program shrink away simultaneously —great when you've got several Web browser windows open, for example, or 
an abundance of word processor documents.
Unfortunately, there's no one-click method for un-minimizing all of the windows in a program. You have to click them one at 
a time on the Dock.
Mac OS X can even change menu commands as you press modifier keys. For example, 
open a couple of Finder windows and then click the Window menu. Focus your eyes on the 
Minimize Window command. Now press Option and watch both the wording and the listed 
keyboard equivalent change instantly to Minimize All Windows (Option-
-M).
1.2.5 Zoom Button
A click on this green geltab (see Figure 1-6) makes a desktop window just large enough to reveal all of the icons inside it. If 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (13 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
your monitor isn't big enough to show all the icons in a window, the zoom box resizes the window to show as many as 
possible. In either case, a second click on the zoom button restores the window to its previous size. (The 
Window
Zoom Window command does the same thing.)
1.2.6 The Folder Proxy Icon
Each Finder-window title bar features a small icon next to the window's name (Figure 1-8), representing the open window's 
actual folder or disk icon. It's a stand-in—a proxy—for the folder itself.
When you find yourself confronting a Finder window that contains useful stuff, consider 
dragging its proxy icon to the Dock. You wind up installing its folder or disk icon there for 
future use. That's not the same as minimizing the window, which puts the window icon into the 
Dock, and only temporarily at that. (Note: Most Mac OS X document windows also offer a 
proxyicon feature, but produce only an alias when you drag it to a different folder or disk.)
 
By dragging this tiny icon, you can move or copy the folder into a different folder or disk, into the Trash, or into the Dock 
without having to first close the window. (If this feature strikes you as unimpressive, you probably never witnessed a 
hapless Mac novice repeatedly attempting to drag an open window into the Trash in, say, System 7.5.)
You have to hold down the mouse button on the folder proxy icon until the icon darkens 
before dragging, which takes only a fraction of a second.
When dragging this proxy icon to a different place on the same disk, the usual folderdragging rules apply: Hold down the

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
Option key if you want to copy the original disk or folder; ignore the Option key to move the original folder. (You'll find 
details on moving and copying icons in the next chapter.)
1.2.7 The Finder Toolbar
Chapter 3 describes this fascinating desktop-window element in great detail.
1.2.8 "Old Finder Mode" (Hiding the Toolbar)
In Mac OS X, double-clicking a folder in a window doesn't leave you with two open windows. Instead, double-clicking a 
folder makes the original window disappear (Figure 1-9).
In an effort to help you avoid window clutter, Apple has designed Mac OS X windows so that 
double-clicking a folder in a window (top) doesn't actually open another window (bottom). 
Every time you double-click a folder in an open window, its contents replace whatever was 
previously in the window. If you double-click three folders in succession, you still wind up with 
just one open window.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (15 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
 
If you Option-double-click a folder, you don't simply replace the contents of a fixed window 
that remains on the screen; you actually switch windows, as evidenced by their changing 
sizes and shapes.
So what if you've now opened inner folder B, and you want to backtrack to outer folder A? In that case, just click the tiny left-
arrow button labeled Back, shown in Figure 1-9, or use one of these alternatives:
G     Choose Go
Back.
G     Press 
-[ (left bracket).
G     Press 
-up arrow.
G     Choose Go

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
None of that will help you, however, if you want to copy a file from one folder into another or compare the contents of two 
windows. In that case, you'll probably want to see both windows open at the same time.
You can open a second window using any of these techniques:
G     Choose File
New Finder Window (
-N).
What "new" window appears when you use this command? On a fresh Mac OS X 
installation, it's likely to be the Computer window, which isn't where you keep the folders you 
work with. Changing this setting should be one of your first bits of business in Mac OS X.
To make the change, choose Finder
Preferences. Click the General icon. Change the 
"New Finder windows open" pop-up menu to whatever folder you'd like to use as the starting 
point for your computing life. Your Home folder is a good choice, but (new in 10.3) you're 
also free to choose your Documents folder, your iDisk, or any folder at all. Now every new 
Finder window shows you that specified folder, which is a much more useful arrangement.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Multiple Views, Same Folder
If you've read this section carefully, you may have discovered a peculiar quirk of the Mac OS X Finder: By 
choosing File
 New Finder Window (or 
-double-clicking a disk or folder icon), you open a second, 
completely independent Finder window. If you stop to think about it, therefore, there's nothing to stop you from 
opening a third, fourth, or fifth copy of the same folder window. Once they're open, you can even switch them 
into different views.
Try this, for example: Choose Go
Applications. Choose File
New Finder Window (
-N), and then 
choose Go
 Applications again. Using the View menu or the controls in the toolbar, put one of these 
windows into list view, and the other into icon view.
This phenomenon has its advantages. For example, you might decide to open the same window twice while 
doing some hard drive housekeeping. By keeping a list view open, you can check the Size column as you 
move your files into different folders (so you can make sure the folders fit onto a blank CD, for example)—but 
by keeping a column view open, you gain quicker navigational access to the stuff on your drive.

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
"Old Finder Mode," of course, isn't the technical Apple term, but it should be. Here's how it works.
1.2.8.1 The Toolbar Disclosure button
The upper-right corner of every Finder window contains a little button that looks like a half-inch squirt of Crest toothpaste. 
When you click it, you enter Old Finder Mode.
Tip: You can also enter Old Finder Mode by pressing Option-
-T, the equivalent for the 
View
Hide Toolbar command. Beware: This keystroke changed in Mac OS X 10.3. The 
old one, 
-B, now does nothing at all in the Finder.
This mode was designed for people who come to Mac OS X from an earlier version of the Mac OS, like Mac OS 9, and lose 
half their hair when they discover how different things are in Mac OS X.
In this mode, three of the biggest behavioral differences between Mac OS X and its predecessor disappear:
G     The Sidebar and the Finder-window toolbar (Figure 1-6) slide out of sight.
G     Double-clicking a folder now works like it used to. Every time you double-click a folder, you open a new 
corresponding window.
G     You can add a Mac OS 9-style information strip at the top of the window, which tells you how many icons are in it 
("14 items," for example) and the amount of free space remaining on the disk. Just choose View
Show Status 
Bar—a command that's dimmed at all times except when you're in Old Finder Mode.
(In Mac OS X 10.3, this information strip appears at the bottom of every Finder window, as shown in Figure 1-6.)
1.2.8.2 Leaving Old Finder Mode
When you've had enough of Old Finder Mode, you can return to regular Mac OS X mode by clicking the Toolbar Disclosure 
button again, by pressing Option-
-T again, or by choosing View
Show Toolbar.
NOTE
You'll find this little white toolbar-control nubbin in a number of toolbar-endowed programs, including Mail, 
Safari, System Preferences, and others. Clicking it always makes the toolbar go away.
1.2.9 Scroll Bars
Scroll bars appear automatically in any window that isn't big enough to show all of its contents. Without scroll bars in word 
processors, for example, you'd never be able to write a letter that's longer than your screen is tall. You can manipulate a 
scroll bar in three ways, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Three ways to control a scroll. The scroll bar arrows (lower right) appear nestled together when 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-2.html (18 of 21)5/3/2004 4:46:35 AM

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
you first install Mac OS X, as shown here. If you, an old-time Windows or Mac OS 9 fan, prefer 
these arrows to appear on opposite ends of the scroll bar, visit the Appearance panel of 
System Preferences, described in Section 8.4.
 
Mac OS X offers an intriguing scroll bar option called "Scroll to here." Ordinarily, when you click in the scroll bar track above 
or below the gelatinous handle, the window scrolls by one screenful. But your other option is to turn on "Scroll to here" 
mode in the Appearance panel of System Preferences (see Section 8.4). Now when you click in the scroll bar track, the 
Mac considers the entire scroll bar a proportional map of the document, and jumps precisely to the spot you clicked. That is, 
if you click at the very bottom of the scroll bar track, you see the very last page.
No matter which scrolling option you choose in the Appearance panel, you can always 
override your decision on a case-by-case basis by Option-clicking in the scroll bar track. In 
other words, if you've selected the "Scroll to here" option, you can produce a "Jump to the 
next page" scroll by Option-clicking in the scroll bar track.
It's worth noting, however, that the true speed expert eschews scroll bars altogether. Your Page Up and Page Down keys 
let you scroll up and down, one screen at a time, without having to take your hands off the keyboard to grab the mouse. 
The Home and End keys, meanwhile, are generally useful for jumping directly to the top or bottom of your document (or 
Finder window). And if you've bought a non-Apple mouse that has a scroll wheel on the top, you can use it to scroll 
windows, too, without pressing any keys at all.
At first glance, you might assume that scroll bars are an extremely inefficient mechanism when you want to scroll a window

1.2 Windows and How to Work Them
diagonally—and you'd be right. Fortunately, Mac OS X includes an alternate scrolling system for such situations. Position 
your mouse inside a Finder window; while pressing 
 and Option, you can drag—and scroll—in any direction, as shown in 
Figure 1-11.
Position your mouse inside a Finder window (column views not included) or even an Internet 
Explorer window. While pressing 
 and Option, you can drag and scroll in any direction. As 
you drag, the cursor changes shape, becoming a white-gloved butler's hand. Where can you 
get that kind of service these days?
 
1.2.10 Resize Handle
The lower-right corner of every standard Mac OS X window is ribbed, a design that's meant to imply that you can grip it by 
dragging. Doing so lets you resize and reshape the window (see Figure 1-6).
1.2.11 Status Bar
This information strip tells you how many icons are in the window ("14 items," for example) and the amount of free space 
remaining on the disk. (If you miss seeing the status bar at the top of every window—what are you, some kind of radical?—
see Section 1.2.8.)

WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?
The status bar shows you disk-space information for the entire disk, but not how much disk space this 
particular window's contents occupy.
To find out that piece of information, make sure that no icon in the window is highlighted. Then choose 
File
Get Info (or press 
-I). The resulting Info window, which is described in more detail at the end of 
the next chapter, shows the size of the folder or disk whose window you're browsing, along with other useful 
statistics.

1.3 The Three Window Views
You can view the files and folders in a desktop window in any of three ways: as icons; as a single, tidy list; or in a series of 
neat columns. Figure 1-12 shows the three different views.
Every window remembers its view settings independently. You might prefer to look over your Applications folder in list view 
(because it's crammed with files and folders), but you may prefer to view the less populated Users folder in icon view, 
where the larger icons are easier to double-click.
To switch a window from one view to another, just click one of the three corresponding icons in the window's toolbar, as 
shown in Figure 1-12.
From top: The same window in icon view, list view, and column view. Very full folders are best 
navigated in list or column views, but you may prefer to view emptier folders in icon view, 
because larger icons are easier to click.
Remember that in any view (icon, list, or column), you can highlight an icon by typing the first 
couple letters of its name. In icon or list view, you can also press Tab to highlight the next icon 
(in alphabetical order), or Shift-Tab to highlight the previous one.

You can also switch views by choosing View

handy if you've hidden the toolbar. Or, for less mousing and more hardbodied efficiency, press 
-1,

icon, list, or column view, respectively.

1.4 Icon View
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
1.4 Icon View
In an icon view, every file, folder, and disk is represented by a small picture—an icon. This humble image, a visual 
representation of electronic bits and bytes, is the cornerstone of the entire Macintosh religion. (Maybe that's why it's called 
an icon.)
1.4.1 Icon View Options
Mac OS X offers a number of useful icon view options, all of which are worth exploring. Start by opening any icon view 
window, and then choose View
Show View Options (
-J).
1.4.1.1 Choosing icon sizes
Mac OS X draws the little pictures that represent your icons using sophisticated graphics software. As a result, you (or the 
Mac) can scale them to almost any size without losing any quality or clarity. You can specify a new icon size either for a 
single window or for every icon view window on your machine (Figure 1-13).
In the View Options window (Figure 1-14), click one of the buttons at the top of the window—either "This window only" or 
"All windows"—to indicate whether you want to change the icon sizes in just the frontmost window or everywhere on the 
Mac.
Mac OS X lets you choose an icon size to suit your personality. For picture folders, it can often 
be very handy to pick a jumbo size, in effect creating a slide-sorter "light table" effect. Just use 
the slider in the View Options dialog box, shown in Figure 1-14.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-4.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 4:47:07 AM

1.4 Icon View
 
Finally, drag the Icon Size slider back and forth until you find a size you like. (For added fun, make little cartoon sounds with 
your mouth.)
1.4.1.2 Text size
Ring the bells! Fire the cannons! At last, Mac OS X fans can control the type size of icon names in the Finder!
In fact, if you choose "This window only" at the top of the palette, you can actually specify a different type size for every 
window on your machine. Neither Windows nor the Mac OS has ever offered that level of control before. (Why would you 
want to adjust the point size independently in different windows? Well, because you might want smaller type to fit more into 
a crammed list view without scrolling, while you can afford larger type in less densely populated windows.)
Your choices range only from 10 to 16 points, and you still can't choose a different font. But for people with especially big or 
especially small screens—or people with aging retinas—this feature is much better than nothing.
1.4.1.3 Windows XP-style labeling
In its own quiet way, this tiny, unheralded feature represents one of the most radical changes to the Finder since the 
invention of the Mac. As shown in Figure 1-14, it lets you create, in effect, a multiple-column list view in a single window.
Thanks to the secret powers of the View Options palette (right), Mac OS X can display icon 
names on the right—and even show a second line of file info—in any icon view. You now have

1.4 Icon View
all the handy, freely draggable convenience of an icon view, along with the compact spacing of 
a list view.
 
1.4.1.4 "Show item info"
While you've got the View Options palette open, try turning on "Show item info." Suddenly you get a new line of information 
(in tiny blue type) for certain icons saving you the effort of opening up the folder or file to find out what's in it. For example:
G     Folders. The info line lets you know how many icons are inside each without having to open it up. Now you can 
spot empties at a glance.
G     Graphics files. Certain other kinds of files may show a helpful info line, too. For example, graphics in most file 
formats display their dimensions in pixels. (Even JPEG graphics display their own pixel resolutions—a welcome 
improvement from Mac OS X 10.2.)
G     Sounds and QuickTime movies. The light-blue bonus line tells you how long the sound or movie takes to play. 
For example, the highlighted MP3 file in Figure 1-14 says "00'34," which means zero minutes, 34 seconds.
You can see these effects illustrated in Figure 1-14.
1.4.1.5 "Show icon preview"
This option pertains primarily to graphics, which Mac OS X often displays only with a generic icon (stamped JPEG, TIFF, or 
PDF). But if you turn on "Show icon preview," Mac OS X turns each icon into a miniature display of the image itself, as 
shown in Figures 1-14 and 1-15. It's ideal for working with folders full of digital photos.
1.4.1.6 Window backgrounds
Here's another Mac OS X luxury that other operating-system fans can only dream about: You can fill the background of any 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-4.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 4:47:07 AM

1.4 Icon View
icon view window on your Mac with a certain color—or even a photo.
Color-coordinating or "wallpapering" certain windows is more than just a gimmick. On the contrary, it can serve as a 
timesaving psychological cue. Once you've gotten used to the fact that your main Documents folder has a sky-blue 
background, you can pick it out like a sharpshooter from a screen filled with open windows. Colorcoded Finder windows are 
also especially easy to distinguish at a glance when you've minimized them to the Dock.
NOTE
Background colors and pictures disappear in list or column view, and in windows that "belong" to Mac OS X 
itself, such as the hard drive window and the Users folder.
Once a window is open, choose View
View Options (
-J). The bottom of the resulting dialog box offers three choices, 
whose results are shown in Figure 1-15:
G     White. This is the standard option.
G     Color. When you click this button, you see a small rectangular button beside the word Color. Click it to open the 
Color Picker (Section 4.10.4), which you can use to choose a new background color for the window. (Unless it's 
April Fool's day, pick a light color. If you choose a dark one—like black—you won't be able to make out the lettering 
of the icons' names.)
G     Picture. If you choose this option, a Select button appears. Click it to open the Select a Picture dialog box, already 
open to your Library
Desktop Pictures folder. Now choose a graphics file—one of Apple's in the Desktop 
Pictures folder—or one of your own. When you click Select, you'll see that Mac OS X has superimposed the 
window's icons on the photo. As you can see in Figure 1-15, low-contrast or light-background photos work best for 
legibility.
Incidentally, the Mac has no idea what sizes and shapes your window may assume in its lifetime. Therefore, Mac OS X 
makes no attempt to scale down a selected photo to fit neatly into the window. If you have a high-res digital camera, 
therefore, you'll see only the upper-left corner of a photo as the window background. Use a graphics program to scale the 
picture down to something smaller than your screen resolution for better results.
The View Options dialog box for an icon view window offers the chance to create colored 
backgrounds for certain windows (top) or even to use photos as window wallpaper (bottom). 
Using a photo may have a soothing, annoying, or comic effect—like making the icon names 
completely unreadable.

1.4 Icon View
 
1.4.2 Keeping Icons Neat and Sorted
In general, you can drag icons anywhere within a window. For example, some people like to keep current project icons at 
the top of the window and move older stuff to the bottom.
If you'd like Mac OS X to impose a little discipline on you, however, it's easy enough to request a visit from an electronic 
housekeeper who tidies up your icons by aligning them neatly to an invisible grid.
NOTE
You can't specify how tight or loose this invisible grid is.
Mac OS X offers an enormous number of variations on the "snap icons to the underlying grid" theme:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-4.html (5 of 7)5/3/2004 4:47:07 AM

1.4 Icon View
G     Aligning individual icons to the grid. Press the 
 key while dragging an icon or several highlighted icons. 
(Don't press the key down until after you begin to drag.) When you release the mouse, the icons you've moved all 
jump into neatly aligned positions.
G     Aligning all icons to the grid. Choose View
Clean Up (if nothing is selected) or View
Clean Up Selection 
(if some icons are highlighted). Now all icons in the window (or those you've selected) jump to the closest positions 
on the invisible underlying grid.
If you press Option, you swap the wording of the command. Clean Up changes to read Clean 
Up Selection, and vice versa.
This is a temporary status, however—as soon as you drag icons around, or add more icons to the window, the newly 
moved icons wind up just as sloppily positioned as before you used the command.
If you'd rather have icons snap to the nearest underlying grid positions whenever you move them, choose View
Show 
View Options. In the resulting dialog box, make sure the proper button is selected at the top of the window ("This window 
only" or "All windows"), and then turn on "Snap to grid."
If your status bar is showing in the window, as described earlier, a small, subtle grid icon appears at its left edge to remind 
you why your icons are all so neatly aligned.
NOTE
You can override the grid setting by pressing the 
 key when you drag. In other words, when gridsnapping 
is turned off, 
 makes your icons snap into position; when grid-snapping is turned on, 
 lets you drag an 
icon freely.
Note, by the way, that neither of these grid-snapping commands—View
Clean Up and the "Snap to grid" option—
moves icons into the most compact possible arrangement. If one or two icons have wandered off from the herd to a far 
corner of the window, they're merely nudged to the closest grid points to their current locations. They aren't moved all the 
way back to the group of icons elsewhere in the window.
To make them jump back to the primary cluster, read on.
G     Sorting all icons for the moment. If you choose View
Arrange
by Name, all icons in the window snap to 
the invisible grid and sort themselves alphabetically. Use this method to place the icons as close as possible to 
each other within the window, rounding up any strays. The other subcommands in the View
Arrange menu, 
such as
by Size,
by Date Modified, and so on, work similarly, but sort the icons according to different 
criteria.
As with the Clean Up command, View
Arrange serves only to reorganize the icons in the window at this 
moment. Moving or adding icons in the window means you'll wind up with icons out of order. If you'd rather have all 
icons remain sorted and clustered, try this:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-4.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 4:47:07 AM

1.4 Icon View
G     Sorting all icons permanently. This arrangement is the ideal solution for neat freaks who can't stand seeing icons 
out of place. It maintains the sorting and alignment of all icons in the window, present and future. Now if you add 
more icons to the window, they jump into correct alphabetical position; if you remove icons, the remaining ones 
slide over to fill in the resulting gap.
To make it happen, choose View
Show View Options. In the resulting dialog box, turn on the "Keep arranged 
by" checkbox. From the pop-up menu, specify what order you want your icons to snap into. Close the window. As 
shown at left in Figure 1-16, your icons are now locked into sorted position, as compactly as possible.
Although it doesn't occur to most Mac users, you can also apply any of the commands described in this section—
Clean Up, Arrange, Keep Arranged, and so on—to icons lying loose on your desktop. Even though they don't seem 
to be in any window at all, you can specify small or large icons, automatic alphabetical arrangement, and so on. 
Just click the desktop before using the commands in the View menu.
NOTE
There's only one View Options dialog box. Once it's open on the screen, you can adjust the icon sizes or 
arrangement options of other windows just by clicking them. Each time you click inside a window, the View 
Options dialog box remains in front, changing to reflect the settings of the window you just clicked.
Use the View Options dialog box (right) to turn on permanent- cleanliness mode (left). A tiny 
four-square icon (circled) appears to remind you that you've turned on the Mac's spatial 
lockjaw feature, so that you don't get frustrated when you try to drag an icon into a new 
position and then discover that it won't budge.

1.5 List View

1.5 List View
In windows that contain a lot of icons, the list view is a powerful weapon in the battle against chaos. It shows you a tidy 
table of your files' names, dates, sizes, and so on.
You have complete control over your columns, in that you get to decide how wide they should be, which of them should 
appear, and in what order (except that Name is always the first column). Here's how to master these columns:
1.5.1 Sorting the List
Most of the world's list view fans like their files listed alphabetically. It's occasionally useful, however, to view the newest 
files first, largest first, or whatever.
When a desktop window displays its icons in a list view, a convenient new strip of column headings appears (Figure 1-17). 
These column headings aren't just signposts; they're buttons, too. Click Name for alphabetical order, Date Modified to view 
newest first, Size to view largest files at the top, and so on.
You control the sorting order of a list view by clicking the column headings (top). Click a 
second time to reverse the sorting order (bottom). You'll find the identical triangle—indicating 
the identical information —in email programs, in Sherlock (Chapter 20), and anywhere else 
where reversing the sorting order of the list can be useful.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (1 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
 
It's especially important to note the tiny, dark gray triangle that appears in the column you've most recently clicked. It shows 
you which way the list is being sorted.
When the triangle points upward, oldest files, smallest files, or files beginning with numbers (or the letter A) appear at the 
top of the list, depending on which sorting criterion you have selected.
It may help you to remember that when the smallest portion of the triangle is at the top, the 
smallest files are listed first when viewed in size order.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (2 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
To reverse the sorting order, just click the column heading a second time. Now newest files, largest files, or files beginning 
with the letter Z appear at the top of the list. The tiny triangle turns upside-down.
You can also change the sorting order from the keyboard. Just press Control-Tab to highlight 
each successive column heading, sorting the list by that criterion in the process. Add the 
Shift key to move leftward through the column headings.
1.5.2 Flippy Triangles
One of the Mac's most attractive features is the tiny triangle that appears to the left of a folder's name in a list view. In its 
official documents, Apple calls these buttons disclosure triangles; internally, the programmers call them flippy triangles.
Click a "flippy triangle" (left) to see the list of the folders and files inside that folder (right). Or 
press the equivalent keystrokes: 
-right arrow (to open) and 
-left arrow (to close).
 
Either way, these triangles are very useful: When you click one, the list view turns into an outline, which displays the 
contents of the folder in an indented list, as shown in Figure 1-18. Click the triangle again to collapse the folder listing. 
You're saved the trouble and clutter of opening a new window just to view the folder's contents.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (3 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
By selectively clicking flippy triangles, you can, in effect, peer inside two or more folders simultaneously, all within a single 
list view window. You can move files around by dragging them onto the tiny folder icons.
Once you've expanded a folder by clicking its flippy triangle, you can even drag a file icon out 
of its folder so that it's loose in the list view window. To do so, drag it directly upward onto the 
column headings area (where it says Name, for example). When you release the mouse, 
you'll see that the file is no longer inside the expanded folder.
1.5.3 Which Columns Appear
Choose View
Show View Options. In the palette that appears, you're offered on/off checkboxes for the different 
columns of information Mac OS X can show you, as illustrated in Figure 1-19.
G     Date Modified. This date-and-time stamp indicates when a document was last saved. Its accuracy, of course, 
depends on the accuracy of your Mac's built-in clock (see Section 8.6).
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Flippy Triangle Keystrokes
The keystrokes that let you open and close flippy triangles in a list view are worth committing to memory.
First, pressing the Option key when you click a flippy triangle lets you view a folder's contents and the 
contents of any folders inside it. The result, in other words, is a longer list that may involve several levels of 
indentation.
If you prefer to use the keyboard, substitute the right-arrow key (to expand a selected folder's flippy triangle) 
or left-arrow key (to collapse the folder listing again). Here again, adding the Option key expands all levels of 
folders within the selected one.
Suppose, for example, that you want to find out how many files are in your Pictures folder. The trouble is, you 
have organized your graphics files within that folder in several category folders. And you realize that the "how 
many items" statistic in the status bar shows you how many icons are visible in the window. In other words, 
you won't know your total photo count until you've expanded all the folders within the Pictures folder.
You could perform the entire routine from the keyboard like this: Get to your Home folder (see Section 2.1) by 
pressing Shift-
-H. Select the Pictures folder by typing the letter P. Open it by pressing 
-O (the shortcut 
for File
Open) or 
-down arrow. Highlight the entire contents by pressing 
-A (the shortcut for 
Edit
Select All).
Now that all folders are highlighted, press Option-right arrow. You may have to wait a moment for the Mac to 
open every subfolder of every subfolder. But eventually, the massive list appears, complete with many levels 
of indentation. At last, the "items" statistic in the status bar (see Section 1.2.11) gives you a complete, 
updated tally of how many files are in all of those folders combined.

1.5 List View
NOTE
Many an up-to-date file has been lost because a Mac user spotted a very old date on a folder and assumed 
that the files inside were equally old. That's because the modification date shown for a folder doesn't reflect 
the age of its contents. Instead, the date on a folder indicates only when items were last moved into or out of 
that folder. The actual files inside may be much older, or much more recent.
The checkboxes you turn on in the View Options dialog box determine which columns of 
information appear in a list view window.
Most people live full and satisfying lives with only the three default columns—Date Modified, 
Kind, and Size—turned on. But the other columns can be helpful in special circumstances; the 
trick is knowing what information appears there.
 
G     Date Created. This date-and-time stamp shows you when a document was first saved.
G     Size. With a glance, you can tell from this column how much disk space each of your files and folders is taking up 
in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes—whichever the Mac thinks you'll find most helpful. (There are 1,024 kilobytes 
in a megabyte.)

1.5 List View
For disks and folders, you see only a dash—at first. You can, however, instruct the Mac to 
reveal their sizes, as described in Section 1.5.4.
G     Kind. In this column, you can read what kind of icon each item represents. You may see, for example, Folder, 
JPEG Image, Application, and so on.
G     Version. This column displays the version numbers of your programs. For folders and documents, you just see a 
dash.
G     Comments. This rarely seen column can actually be among the most useful. Suppose that you're a person who 
uses the Comments feature (highlight an icon, choose File
Get Info, type notes about that item into the 
Comments box). The option to view the first line of comments about each icon can be very helpful, especially when 
tracking multiple versions of your documents, as shown in Figure 1-20.
NOTE
Unfortunately, the systems for storing comments are different in Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. When you run 
Mac OS X, you won't see the icon comments you added in Mac OS 9, and vice versa.
Left: The Comments column is often worth turning on. If your monitor is big enough, you can 
make the Comments column wide enough to show several paragraphs of text, all in a single line
—enough to reveal the full life history of each icon.
Right: You enter these comments in the Get Info window for each file.

1.5 List View
 
G     Label. This Macintosh perk, missing since Mac OS 9, has returned in 10.3 to the cheers of Mac veterans. Labels 
are colors and identifying phrases that you can slap onto icons, wherever they appear, to help you categorize and 
group them. For details, see Section 2.6.
Even with this column turned off, you can still see an icon's color, of course. But only by turning on this column do 
you get to see the text phrase that you've associated with each label.
1.5.4 Other View Options
The View Options for a list view include several other useful settings (choose View
 Show View Options, or press 
-
J). As always, be sure to click either "All windows" or "This window only" before closing the window, so that your changes 
will have the scope of effect that you intended.
G     Icon Size. These two buttons offer you a choice of icon size for the current window: either standard size or tiny 
size. Unlike icon view, list view doesn't give you a size slider.
Thanks to Mac OS X's powerful graphics software, even the tiny icons aren't so small that they show up blank. You 
still get a general idea of what they're supposed to look like.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (7 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
G     Text size. As described in Section 1.5.3, you can change the type size for your icon labels, either globally or one 
window at a time.
G     Show columns. Turn on the columns you'd like to appear in the current window's list view, as described in the 
previous section.
G     Use relative dates. In a list view, the Date Modified and Date Created columns generally display information in a 
format like this: "Tuesday, March 9, 2004." (As noted below, the Mac uses shorter date formats as the column gets 
narrower.) But when the "Use relative dates" option is turned on, the Mac substitutes the word "Yesterday" or 
"Today" where appropriate, making recent files easier to spot.
G     Calculate all sizes. See the box below.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Calculate All Sizes
When I sort my list view by size, I see only dashes for folder sizes. What am I doing wrong? 
Nothing at all; that's normal. When viewing a Finder window, you see a Size statistic for each file. For folders 
and disks, however, you're shown only an uninformative dash.
Most Mac fans study this anomaly only momentarily, scratch their chins, and then get back to their work. 
Former Windows users don't even scratch their chins; Windows PCs never show folder-size or disk-size 
information in list views.
Here's what's going on: It can take a computer a long time to add up the sizes of all files inside a folder. Your 
System
 Library folder alone, for example, contains more than 1,500 files. Instead of making you wait 
while the Mac does all of this addition, Mac OS X simply shows you a dash in the Size column for a folder.
On occasion, however, you really do want to see how big your folders are. In such cases, choose 
View
Show View Options and turn on "Calculate all sizes." You'll see the folder sizes slowly begin to pop 
onto the screen, from the top of the window down, as the Mac crunches the numbers of the files within.
In fact, you can even turn on the "Calculate all sizes" option globally—that is, for all windows. In the Mac 
operating systems of days gone by, this act would have caused a massive slowdown of the entire computer. 
But remember that Mac OS X is multithreaded—that is, it has the opposite of a one-track mind. It's perfectly 
capable of devoting all of its attention to calculating your folder sizes and all of its attention to whatever work 
you're doing in the foreground.
But now consider this anomaly: Suppose you've opted to sort a particular window by folder size—in other 
words, you've clicked the word Size at the top of the column. Turning on "Calculate all sizes" bewilders the 
unprepared, as folders arbitrarily begin leaping out of order, forcing the list to rearrange itself a couple of times 
per second.
What's happening, of course, is that all folders begin at the bottom of the list, showing only dashes in the Size 
column. Then, as the Mac computes the size of your folders' contents, they jump into their correct sorted 
order at what may seem to be random intervals.
1.5.5 Rearranging Columns
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (8 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
You're stuck with the Name column at the far left of a window. But you can rearrange the other columns just by dragging 
their gray column headers horizontally. If the Mac thinks you intend to drop a column to, say, the left of the column it 
overlaps, you'll actually see an animated movement—indicating a column reshuffling—even before you release the mouse 
button.
1.5.6 Adjusting Column Widths
Place your cursor carefully on the dividing line between two column headings. When the cursor sprouts horizontal arrows 
from each side, you can drag horizontally. Doing so makes the column to the left of your cursor wider or narrower.
What's delightful about this activity is watching Mac OS X scramble to rewrite its information to fit the space you give it. For 
example, as you make the Date Modified (or Created) column narrower, "Tuesday, March 9, 2004, 2:22 PM" shrinks first to 
"Tue, Mar 9, 2004, 2:22 PM," then to "3/9/04, 2:22 PM," and finally to a terse "3/9/04."
If you make a column too narrow, Mac OS X shortens the file names, dates, or whatever by removing text from the middle. 
An ellipsis (...) appears to show you where the missing text would have appeared. (Apple reasoned that truncating the ends 
of file names, as in previous versions of the Mac OS, would hide useful information like the number at the end of "Letter to 
Marge 1," "Letter to Marge 2," and so on. It would also hide the three-letter extensions, such as Thesis.doc, that may 
appear on file names in Mac OS X.)
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Pop-Up Windows
Help! How do I make pop-up windows in Mac OS X? You know, those little folder tabs that peek up from the 
bottom of the screen? 
Apple figured you wouldn't need them. After all, you can achieve the same effect by dragging folders into the 
Dock (Chapter 3). Once there, you can click a folder icon to open it, or view a pop-up list of its contents by 
Control-clicking it, right-clicking it (if you have a two-button mouse), or just holding the mouse button down on 
it.
But that's not the real thing. If you do want the real thing, just drag any window to the bottom of the screen, so 
that only its title bar is showing. (First make the window narrow, if you like, so that its title bar turns into a little 
tab.) Put a whole row of window "tabs" down there, if you like.
Now you can make one of these tabs pop up in either of two ways. First, drag any file or folder icon off of your 
desktop, across the title bar, and down. Presto! After a short pause, the window pops open to receive your 
drag, just like the pop-up windows of Mac OS 9. It even recedes back to the screen edge if you move your 
mouse away without dropping what you're dragging. (Unfortunately, it doesn't collapse again if you release 
the mouse inside the window boundaries.)
If you'd rather have it pop up and stay up unaided, just click its green zoom button. The window springs 
upward and open so you can access its contents—and then collapses again when you click the green button 
a second time.
It's not a real pop-up window, but it's close. In the meantime, this trick does "real" pop-up windows one better: 
You can park your windows off any edge of the screen, not just the bottom. You haven't lived until you've 
watched a window "drawer" slide open from the top or side of your monitor.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-5.html (9 of 10)5/3/2004 4:47:56 AM

1.5 List View
For example, suppose you've named a Word document "Madonna—A Major Force for Humanization and Cure for 
Depression, Acne, and Migraine Headache." (Yes, file names can really be that long.) If the Name column is too narrow, 
you might see only "Madonna—A Major...Migraine Headache."
You don't have to make the column mega-wide just to read the full text of a file whose name 
has been shortened. Just point to the icon's name without clicking. After a moment, a yellow, 
floating balloon appears—something like a tooltip in Microsoft programs—to identify the full 
name.
And if you don't feel like waiting, hold down the Option key. As you whip your mouse over 
truncated file names, their tooltip balloons appear instantaneously. (Both of these tricks work 
in either list or column view—and in Save and Open dialog boxes, for that matter.)

1.6 Column View
Icon view and list view should certainly be familiar to anyone who's used a personal computer before. But for many 
computer fans, column view is something new—and welcome.
The goal is simple: to create a means of burrowing down through nested folders without leaving a trail of messy, 
overlapping windows in your wake.
The solution is shown in Figure 1-21. It's a list view that's divided into several vertical panes. The first pane (not counting 
the Sidebar) shows all the icons of your disks, including your main hard drive.
If the rightmost folder contains pictures, sounds, or movies, Mac OS X even lets you look at 
them or play them, right there in the Finder. If it's a certain kind of text document (AppleWorks 
or PDF, for example), you actually see a tiny image of the first page. If it's any other kind of 
document, you see a blowup of its icon and a few file statistics. You can drag this jumbo icon 
anywhere—into another folder, for example.
 
When you click a disk (once), the second pane shows a list of all the folders in it. Each time you click a folder in one pane, 
the pane to its right shows what's inside. The other panes slide to the left, sometimes out of view. (Use the horizontal scroll 
bar to bring them back.) You can keep clicking until you're actually looking at the file icons inside the most deeply nested 
folder.
If you discover that your hunt for a particular file has taken you down a blind alley, it's not a big deal to backtrack, since the 
trail of folders you've followed to get here is still sitting before you on the screen. As soon as you click a different folder in 
one of the earlier panes, the panes to its right suddenly change, so that you can burrow down a different rabbit hole.

1.6 Column View
Furthermore, Panther's Sidebar is always at the ready to help you jump to a new track; just click any disk or folder icon 
there to select a new first-column listing for column view.
The beauty of column view is, first of all, that it keeps your screen tidy. It effectively shows you several simultaneous folder 
levels, but contains them within a single window. With a quick 
-W, you can close the entire window, panes and all. 
Second, column view provides an excellent sense of where you are. Because your trail is visible at all times, it's much 
harder to get lost, wondering what folder you're in and how you got there, than in any other window view.
NOTE
Column view is always alphabetical. There's no way to sort the lists by date, for example, as you can in list 
view.
1.6.1 Column View by Keyboard
Efficiency fans can operate this entire process by keyboard alone. For example:
G     You can jump from one pane to the next by pressing the right or left arrow keys. Each press highlights the first icon 
in the next or previous pane.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Everything Old Is New Again
To many observers, Mac OS X's column view was one of the most radical new features of the operating 
system. The truth is, however, that it's not new at all.
In fact, column view's most recent ancestor appeared in the NeXT operating system, which Apple bought 
(along with Steve Jobs, its CEO) in 1997. But column view is even older than that.
 
As you can see in this sketch from May 1980, the idea of a single-window, multiple-column view has been 
kicking around at Apple long before the Macintosh debuted.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-6.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 4:48:00 AM

1.6 Column View
In the end, this view was deemed too complex for the original Mac, which finally appeared (with only list and 
icon views) in 1984. It took 17 more years to find its way into the standard Mac OS.
G     You can use any of the commands in the Go menu, or their keyboard equivalents, or the icons in the Sidebar, to fill 
your columns with the contents of the corresponding folder—Home, Favorites, Applications, and so on.
G     The Back command (clicking the Back button on the toolbar, pressing 
-[, or choosing Go
Back) works as it 
does in a Web browser: it retraces your steps backward. You can repeat this command until you return to the 
column setup that first appeared when you switched to column view. Once you've gone back, in fact, you can then 
go forward again (choose Go
Forward, or press 
-]).
G     Within a highlighted pane, press the up or down arrow keys to highlight successive icons in the list. Or type the first 
couple of letters of an icon's name to jump directly to it.
G     When you finally highlight the icon you've been looking for, press 
-O or 
-down arrow to open it (or double-
click it, of course). You can open anything in any column; you don't have to wait until you've reached the rightmost 
column.
1.6.2 Manipulating the Columns
The number of columns you can see without scrolling depends on the width of the window. In no other view are the zoom 
and resize controls (Section 1.2.3) so important.
That's not to say, however, that you're limited to four columns (or whatever fits on your monitor). You can make the columns 
wider or narrower—either individually or all at once—to suit the situation, according to this scheme:
G     To make a single column wider or narrower, drag its right-side handle (circled in Figure 1-22).
G     To make all the columns wider or narrower simultaneously, hold down the Option key as you drag that right-side 
handle.
G     And here's the tip of the week: Double-click one of the right-side handles to make the column precisely as wide as 
necessary to reveal all the names of its contents.
In Panther, the functions of dragging and Option-dragging have been reversed since Mac OS X 
10.2. It finally dawned on Apple that what you want to do most of the time is adjust one column, 
and that the special keystroke override should apply to the less frequent case: adjusting all 
columns at once.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-6.html (3 of 4)5/3/2004 4:48:00 AM

1.6 Column View
 
G     Option-double-click any column's right-side handle to make all columns just as wide as necessary.
1.6.3 View Options
Just as in icon and list view, you can choose View
Show View Options to open a dialog box—a Spartan one, in this 
case—offering additional control over your column views.
NOTE
Oddly enough, there's no "This window only" or "All windows" option here. Any changes you make here 
affect all column views.
G     Text size. Whatever point size you choose here affects the type used for icons in all column views.
G     Show icon. For maximum speed, turn off this option. Now you see only file names—not the tiny icons next to them
—in all column views.
G     Show preview column. The far-right Preview column can be handy when you're browsing graphics, sounds, or 
movie files. The rest of the time, it can get in the way, slightly slowing down the works and pushing other, more 
useful columns off to the left side of the window. If you turn off this checkbox, the Preview column doesn't appear.
No matter what view you're in, remember this if you ever start dragging an icon and then 
change your mind: Press the Esc key or 
-period, even while the mouse button is still 
down. The icon flies back to its precise starting place. (Too bad real life doesn't have a 
similar feature.)

1.7 Logging Out, Shutting Down
If you're the only person who uses your Mac, finishing up a work session is simple. You can either turn off the machine or 
simply let it go to sleep, in any of several ways.
1.7.1 Sleep Mode
If you're still shutting down your Mac after each use, you may be doing a lot more sitting around and waiting than 
necessary. Sleep mode consumes very little power, keeps everything you were doing open and available, and wakes up 
almost immediately when you press a key or click the mouse. To make your machine sleep:
G     Choose 
Sleep.
G     Press Control-Eject (or Control-F12, if you don't have an Eject key). In the dialog box shown in Figure 1-23, click 
Sleep (or type S).
G     Press the Power button on your machine. On many desktop models, doing so makes it sleep immediately; on 
laptops, you get the dialog box shown in Figure 1-23. (Then again, if you have a laptop, just closing the lid is a 
much quicker way to send it to bed.)
G     Just walk away, confident that the Energy Saver setting described in Section 8.12 will send the machine off to 
dreamland automatically at the specified time.
1.7.2 Restart
You shouldn't have to restart the Mac very often—only in times of severe troubleshooting mystification, in fact. Here are a 
few ways to do it:
Once the Shut Down dialog box appears, you can press the S key instead of clicking Sleep, R 
for Restart, Esc for Cancel, or Enter for Shut Down.
 
G     Choose 
Restart. A confirmation dialog box appears; click Restart (or press Enter).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-1-SECT-7.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:48:02 AM

1.7 Logging Out, Shutting Down
If you press Option as you release the mouse on the 
Restart command, you won't 
be bothered by an "Are you sure?" confirmation box.
G     Press Control-
-Eject. (If you don't have an Eject key, substitute F12.)
G     Press Control-Eject to summon the dialog box shown in Figure 1-23; click Restart (or type R).
1.7.3 Shut Down
To shut down your machine completely (when you don't plan to use it for more than a couple of days, when you plan to 
transport it, and so on), do one of the following:
G     Choose 
Shut Down. A simple confirmation dialog box appears; click Shut Down (or press Enter).
Once again, if you press Option as you release the mouse, no confirmation box will appear.
G     Press Control-Option-
-Eject. (It's not as complex as it looks—the first three keys are all in a tidy row to the left of 
the Space bar.)
G     Press Control-Eject (or Control-F12) to summon the dialog box shown in Figure 1-23. Click Shut Down (or press 
Enter).
G     Wait. If you've set up the Energy Saver preferences (Section 8.12) to shut down the Mac automatically at a 
specified time, you don't have to do anything.
1.7.4 Log Out
If you share your Mac, you should log out when you're done. Doing so ensures that your stuff is safe from the evil and the 
clueless even when you're out of the room. To do it, choose 
Log Out Chris (or whatever your name is). Or, if you're 
in a hurry, press Shift-
-Q.
When the confirmation dialog box appears, click Log Out (or press Enter), or just wait for two minutes. The Mac hides your 
world from view and displays the Log In dialog box, ready for the next victim.
Last time: If you press Option as you release the mouse on the 
Log Out command, 
you squelch the "Are you sure?" box.

1.8 Getting Help in Mac OS X
It's a good thing you've got a book about Mac OS X in your hands, because you certainly won't get much help from Apple. 
The only user manual you get with Mac OS X is the Help
Mac Help command, which you can also summon by 
pressing 
-?. You get a Web browser-like program that reads a set of help files that reside in your System
Libraries 
folder (see Figure 1-24).
The Mac OS X Help system no longer bunches together the help pages from every program on 
your Mac, as it did in previous versions. When you're in the Finder, you get the general 
Macintosh help screens. When you're in iPhoto, you get only iPhoto help screens. And so on. 
(To which most Mac fans would add: "Amen!")
 
You're expected to find the topic you want in one of these two ways:
G     Use the "Ask a Question" blank. Type the phrase you want, such as printing or switching applications, into the 
blank at the top of the window, and then press Return.
The Mac responds by showing you a list of help-screen topics that may pertain to what you need (see Figure 1-25).

1.8 Getting Help in Mac OS X
The bars indicate the Mac's "relevance" rating—how well it thinks each help page matches your 
search. Click one to read a short description of the topic at the bottom of the window, or double-
click to open the help page. If it isn't as helpful as you hoped, click the Back button (the 
leftpointing arrow) at the top of the window to return to the list of relevant topics. Click the little 
Home button to return to the Help Center's welcome screen.
 
G     Drill down. The starting screen offers several "quick click" topics that may interest you. If so, keep clicking text 
headings (which are actually links) until you find a topic that you want to read.
As with the Search method, you can backtrack by clicking the Back (left-pointing arrow) button at the top of the 
"browser" window.

begin each morning by double-clicking it, like millions of other people who'd grown used to older versions of the Mac OS, 
you're in for a shock: Your stuff isn't there.
All you'll find in the Macintosh HD window is a set of folders called Applications, Library, and Users—folders you didn't put 
there. (If you upgraded an existing Mac to Mac OS X 10.3, you'll also see all your original hard drive folders nestled among 
them.)
Most of these folders aren't very useful to you, the Mac's human companion. They're there for Mac OS X's own use. Think 
of your main hard drive window as storage for the operating system itself, which you'll access only for occasional 
administrative purposes. 
2.1.1 Your Home Folder
Instead of setting up your nest—your files, folders, aliases, and so on—in the hard drive window, Mac OS X keeps all of it in 
your Home folder. That's a folder bearing your name (or whatever name you typed when you installed Mac OS X).
One way to find it is to double-click the Users folder, and then double-click the folder inside it that bears your name and 
looks like a house (see Figure 2-1). Here, at last, is the window that you'll eventually fill with new folders, organize, back up, 
and so on.
Mac OS X is rife with shortcuts for opening this all-important folder:
G     Choose Go
Home, or press Shift-
-H.
G     Click the Home icon (the little house) in the Sidebar (Section 1.2.1). 
G     Click the Home icon on the Dock. (If you don't see one, consult Section 3.2 for instructions on how to put one 
there.)
G     Press 
-N, or choose File
New Finder Window. (If your Home folder doesn't open when you do that, see 
Section 1.2.8.)
All of these steps open your Home folder directly.
So why has Apple demoted your files to a folder three levels deep? The answer may send you through the five stages of 
grief—Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and finally Acceptance—but if you're willing to go through it, much of the 
mystery surrounding Mac OS X will fade away.
Mac OS X has been designed from the ground up for computer sharing. It's ideal for any situation where different family 
members, students, or workers share the same Mac.
Each person who uses the computer will turn on the machine to find his own separate desktop picture, set of files, Web 
bookmarks, font collection, and preference settings. (You'll find much more about this feature in Chapter 11.)
Like it or not, Mac OS X considers you one of these people. If you're the only one who uses this Mac, fine—simply ignore

2.1 The Mac OS X Folder Structure
the sharing features. (You can also ignore all that business at the beginning of Chapter 1 about logging in.) But in its little 
software head, Mac OS X still considers you an account holder, and stands ready to accommodate any others who should 
come along.
NOTE
Some Mac fans have noted with dismay that Mac OS X lacks an Encrypt command for protecting individual 
files. In part, that's because the need for file-by-file privacy isn't quite as critical now that Panther can encrypt 
your entire machine environment (Chapter 12). Still, if you miss the ability to password-protect individual 
folders or files, you can use Mac OS X's Disk Utility to do it, as described in Section 9.25.13.2. 
In any case, now you should see the importance of the Users folder in the main hard drive window. Inside are folders—the 
Home folders—named for the different people who use this Mac. In general, nobody is allowed to touch what's inside 
anybody else's folder.
If you're the sole proprietor of the machine, of course, there's only one Home folder in the Users folder—named for you. 
(You can ignore the Shared folder, which is described in Section 11.5.3.)
This is only the first of many examples in which Mac OS X imposes a fairly rigid folder structure. Still, the approach has its 
advantages. By keeping such tight control over which files go where, Mac OS X keeps itself pure—and very, very stable. 
(Other operating systems known for their stability, such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP, work the same way.)
Furthermore, keeping all of your stuff in a single folder makes it very easy for you to back up your work. It also makes life 
easier when you try to connect to your machine from elsewhere in the office (over the network) or elsewhere in the world 
(over the Internet), as described in Chapter 21.
This is it: the folder structure of Mac OS X. It's not so bad, really. For the most part, what you 
care about are the Applications folder in the main hard drive window and your own Home 
folder. You're welcome to save your documents and park your icons almost anywhere on your 
Mac (except inside the System folder or other people's Home folders). But keeping your work in 
your Home folder makes backing up and file sharing easier.

2.1 The Mac OS X Folder Structure
 
2.1.2 What's in Your Hard Drive Window
When you first run Mac OS X, you'll find the following folders in the main hard drive window:
G     Applications. The Applications folder, of course, contains the complete collection of Mac OS X programs on your 
Mac. Even so, you'll rarely launch programs by opening this folder. (The Dock is a far more efficient launcher, as 
described in the next chapter.)
G     Library. This folder bears more than a passing resemblance to the System Folder subfolders of Mac OSes gone 
by, or the Windows folder on PCs. It stores components for the operating system and your programs (sounds, 
fonts, preferences, help files, printer drivers, modem scripts, and so on).
G     System. This is Unix, baby. These are the actual files that turns on your Mac and controls its operations. You'll 
rarely have any business messing with this folder, which is why Apple made almost all of its contents invisible.
G     Users. As noted earlier, this folder stores the Home folders for everyone who uses this machine.
Depending on how you installed Mac OS X, you may also find:
G     Developer. You'll find this folder only if you, a software programmer, bothered to install the XCode Tools CD. (To 
find out where you get it, see Section 9.25.23.)
G     Applications (Mac OS 9). If you upgraded your Mac from Mac OS 9, all of your old, pre-Mac OS X programs wind 
up in this folder (or rather, those that you kept in your old Applications folder).
G     System Folder. Here's another folder you'll find if you upgraded from Mac OS 9. It contains Mac OS 9 itself. (Don't 
confuse the Mac OS 9 folder, called System Folder, with the one that's just called System: that one contains Mac

OS X.)
G     Your old junk. If you upgraded your Mac from Mac OS 9, your main hard drive window also lists whatever folders 
you kept there.
2.1.3 What's in Your Home Folder
Within the folder that bears your name, you'll find another set of standard Mac OS X folders. Except as noted, you're free to 
rename or delete them; Mac OS X creates the following folders solely as a convenience:
G     Desktop. When you drag an icon out of a folder or disk window and onto your Mac OS X desktop, it may appear to 
show up on the desktop. But that's just an optical illusion, a visual convenience. In truth, nothing in Mac OS X is 
ever really on the desktop. It's actually in this Desktop folder, and mirrored on the desktop area.
G     The reason is simple enough: Remember that everyone who shares your machine will, upon logging in, see her 
own stuff sitting out on the desktop. Now you know
UP TO SPEED 
The Computer Window
In your explorations of the Finder's Go menu, you may have wondered about the command called Computer 
(Shift-
- C). ("Go to my Computer? Jeez, I thought I was already at my computer...")
As in Microsoft Windows, the Computer window holds the icons for all the disks connected to your machine—
the hard drive, a CD that you've inserted, an iPod, another external hard drive, and so on—as well as an icon 
called Network. (The Network icon appears even if you're not, in fact, on a network.) This is the topmost level 
of your Mac. This is the stuff that can't be put into any folder at all.
So what's it for? In some ways, the Computer window is redundant. After all, Mac OS X automatically displays 
your disk icons on the desktop and in the Sidebar.
But some people, particularly Windows refugees, don't care for that icons-on-the-desktop feature. In the 
interest of creating a neater, cleaner desktop, they turn it off, in fact (by choosing Finder
Preferences and 
turning off the three checkboxes under "Show these items on the Desktop"). Furthermore, in the interest of 
creating neater, narrower windows, they may also hide the Sidebar.
In that case, the Computer window still provides access to all of your disks.
Otherwise, the Computer window really doesn't serve much purpose except as a familiar landmark to 
Windows veterans and Mac fans who grew used to it in the era before the Sidebar came along.
how Mac OS X does it: There's a separate Desktop folder in every person's Home folder.
G     You can entertain yourself for hours by proving this to yourself. If you drag something out of your Desktop folder, it 
also disappears from the actual desktop. And vice versa. (You're not allowed to delete or rename this folder.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-1.html (4 of 5)5/3/2004 4:48:34 AM

2.1 The Mac OS X Folder Structure
The desktop is actually a folder in your Home folder. That's handy, because it gives you a 
quick and sneaky way to jump to your Home folder from anywhere. Simply click the desktop 
background and then press 
-up arrow (which is the keystroke for Go
Enclosing 
Folder; pay no attention to the fact that that command is dimmed at the moment).
Because that keystroke always means "open whatever folder contains the one I'm 
examining," it instantly opens your Home folder. (Your Home folder is, of course, the "parent" 
of your Desktop folder.)
G     Documents. Apple suggests that you keep your actual work files in this folder. Sure enough, whenever you save a 
new document (when you're working in AppleWorks or Word, for example), the Save As box proposes storing the 
new file in this folder, as described in Chapter 4.
Your programs may also create folders of their own here. For example, you may find a Microsoft User Data folder 
for your Entourage email, a Palm folder for your palmtop's calendar and phone book data, a AppleWorks User Data 
folder for certain preferences, and so on.
G     Library. As noted earlier, the main Library folder (the one in your main hard drive window) contains folders for 
fonts, preferences, help files, and so on.
But you have your own Library folder, too, right there in your Home folder. It stores the same kinds of things—but 
they're your fonts, your preferences, and so on.
Once again, this setup may seem redundant if you're the only person who uses your Mac. But it makes perfect 
sense in the context of families, schools, or offices where numerous people share a single machine. Because you 
have your own Library folder, you can have a font collection that's "installed" on the Mac only when you're using it. 
Each person's program preference files are stored independently, too (the files that determine where Photoshop's 
palettes appear, and so on). And each person, of course, sees his own email when launching Mac OS X's Mail 
program (Chapter 19)—because your mail, too, is generally stored in your own Library folder.
Other Library folders store your Favorites, Internet search sites, Web browser plugins and cached Web pages, 
keyboard layouts, sound files, and so on. (It's best not to move or rename this folder.)
G     Movies, Music, Pictures. These folders, of course, are designed to store multimedia files. The various Mac OS X 
programs that deal with movies, music, and pictures will propose these specialized folders as storage locations. 
For example, when you plug a digital camera into a Mac OS X computer, the iPhoto program automatically begins 
to download the photos on it—and stores them in the Pictures folder. Similarly, iMovie is programmed to look for 
the Movies folder when saving its files, and iTunes stores its MP3 files in the Music folder.
G     Public. If you're on a network, or if others use the same Mac when you're not around, this folder can be handy: It's 
the "Any of you guys can look at these files" folder. Other people on your network, as well as other people who sit 
down at this machine, are allowed to see whatever you've put in here, even if they don't have your password. (If 
your Mac isn't on an office network and isn't shared, you can throw away this folder.) Details on sharing the Mac 
are in Chapter 11, and those on networking are in Chapter 12.
G     Sites. Mac OS X has a built-in Web server: software that turns your Mac into a Web site that people on your 
network—or, via the Internet, all over the world—can connect to. This Mac OS X feature relies on a program called 
the Apache Web server, which is so highly regarded in the Unix community that programmers lower their voices 
when they mention it.
Details are in Chapter 21. For now, though, note that this is the folder where you will put the actual Web pages you 
want to make available to the Internet at large.

2.2 Icon Names
Every document, program, folder, and disk on your Mac is represented by an icon: a colorful little picture that you can 
move, copy, or double-click to open. In Mac OS X, icons look more like photos than cartoons, and you can scale them to 
practically any size.
A Mac OS X icon's name can have up to 255 letters and spaces. If you're accustomed to the 31-character limit of Mac OS 
9, that's quite a luxurious ceiling.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Printing a Window—or a List of Files
Hey, in Mac OS 9, I could print a Finder window. I'd get a neat list of the files, which I could use as a label for 
a CD I was going to burn, or whatever. How do I print a Finder window in Mac OS X? 
It's easy enough to make a list of files for printing. Once the window is open on your screen, choose 
Edit
Select All. Choose Edit
Copy. Now switch to a word processor (or TextEdit) and paste. You get 
a tidy list of all the files in that window, ready to format and print.
This simple file name list still isn't the same as printing a window, that's true; you don't get the status bar 
showing how many items are on the disk, and how full the disk is. For that purpose, you can always make a 
screenshot of the window (Section 13.11), and print that.
Of course, that technique's no good if the list of files is taller than the window itself.
Really, what you want is Print Window, a handy shareware program dedicated to printing out your Finder 
windows, without any of these workarounds or limitations. You can download it from the "Missing CD" page at 
www.missingmanuals.com 
If you're used to Windows, you may be delighted to discover that in Mac OS X, you can name your files using letters, 
numbers, punctuation—in fact, any symbol except for the colon (:), which the Mac uses behind the scenes for its own folder-
hierarchy designation purposes. And you can't use a period to begin a file's name.
To rename a file, click its icon (to highlight it) and then press Return or Enter. (In icon view, you can use a shortcut: just 
click the icon's name. You can skip the Returnkey bit.)
In any case, a rectangle now appears around the name (see Figure 2-2). At this point, the existing name is highlighted; just 
begin typing to replace it. If you type a very long name, the rectangle grows vertically to accommodate new lines of text.

2.2 Icon Names
If you simply want to add letters to the beginning or end of the file's existing name, press the 
left or right arrow key immediately after pressing Return or Enter. The insertion point jumps 
to the corresponding end of the file name.
Click an icon's name (top left) to produce the renaming rectangle (top right), in which you can 
edit the file's name. At this point, the existing name is highlighted; just begin typing to replace 
it (bottom left). When you're finished typing, press Return, Enter, or Tab to seal the deal, or just 
click somewhere else.

2.2 Icon Names
disappear.
You can give more than one file or folder the same name, as long as they're not in the same folder. For example, you can 
have as many files named "Chocolate Cake Recipe" as you like, provided each is in a different folder. And, of course, files 
called Recipe. doc and Recipe.xls can co-exist in a folder, too.
As you edit a file's name, remember that you can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in the Edit menu to move 
selected bits of text around, just as though you're word processing. The Paste command can be useful when, for instance, 
you're renaming many icons in sequence (Quarterly Estimate 1, Quarterly Estimate 2, and so on).
And now, a few tips about renaming icons:
G     When the Finder sorts files, a space is considered alphabetically before the letter A. To force a particular folder to 
appear at the top of a list view window, insert a space before its name.
G     Older operating systems sort files so that 10 and 100 come before 2, the numbers 30 and 300 come before 4, and 
so on. You wind up with alphabetically sorted files like this: "1. Big Day," "10. Long Song," "2. Floppy Hat," "20. Dog 
Bone," "3. Weird Sort," and so on. Generations of computer users have learned to put zeros in front of their single-
digit numbers just to make the sorting look right.
In Mac OS X, though, you get exactly the numerical list you'd hope for: "1. Big Day," "2. Floppy Hat," "3. Weird 
Sort," "10. Long Song," and "20. Dog Bone." At long last, you can get out of the habit of putting zeros in front of file 
names to make them sort properly.
G     In addition to the letters and numbers, Mac OS X Panther also assigns punctuation marks an "alphabetical order," 
like this: ' (the accent mark above the Tab key), ^, _, -, space, short and long dashes, comma, semicolon, !, ?, ', ", 
(, ), [, ], {, }, @, *, /, &, #, %, +, <, =, 
, >, |, ~, and $.
Numbers come after punctuation; letters come next; and bringing up the rear are these characters: µ (Option-M); π 
(Option-P); Ω(Option-Z), and 
 (Shift-Option- K).
G     When it comes time to rename files en masse, add-on shareware can help you. A Better Finder Rename, for 
example, lets you manipulate file names in a batch— numbering them, for example, correcting a spelling in dozens 
of files at once, deleting a certain phrase from their names, and so on. You can download it from the "Missing CD" 
page at www.missingmanuals.com.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Long and Short File Names
Hey, what's the deal with long file names? I thought this was the big deal in Mac OS X! But I tried saving a 
Word document, and it didn't let me use more than 31 letters! 
It's true that you can assign a very long name to a file in the Finder. But you may soon discover that pre-Mac 
OS X programs, and even programs that have been rewritten (Carbonized) to run in Mac OS X, still limit you 
to 31 characters when naming a new document in the Save As dialog box.
Over time, software companies may get with the program and rejigger their software to overcome this 
anachronistic glitch. For now, though, all is not lost.
Even though you can use only 31 characters when saving a new document from, say, AppleWorks, Word, or 
Internet Explorer, you're welcome to rename the file in the Finder, using all 255 characters Mac OS X permits. 
When you reopen the document in the original program, you'll see an abbreviated name in the title bar (a file

that, at the desktop, is called My Visit to Bill Gates's House and Why I'll Take the Apple Bumper Sticker Off 
my Car Next Time opens into AppleWorks as something like My Visit to Bill Gates's H#B6C5).
The good news is that behind the scenes, Mac OS X still remembers its long name. Even if you edit and re-
save the document, you'll still find its long file name intact when you view its icon on the desktop.

2.3 Selecting Icons
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
2.3 Selecting Icons
To highlight a single icon in preparation for printing, opening, duplicating, or deleting, click the icon once with the mouse. (In 
a list or column view, as described in Chapter 1, you can also click on any visible piece of information about that file—its 
size, kind, date modified, and so on.) Both the icon and the name darken in a uniquely Pantherish way.
You can change the color of the oval highlighting that appears around the name of a selected 
icon. Choose 
System Preferences, click Appearance, and use the Highlight Color 
pop-up menu.)
That much may seem obvious. But most first-time Mac users have no idea how to manipulate more than one icon at a time
—an essential survival skill in a graphic interface like the Mac's.
2.3.1 Selecting by Clicking
To highlight multiple files in preparation for moving or copying, use one of these techniques:
G     To highlight all the icons. To select all the icons in a window, press 
-A (the equivalent of the Edit
Select 
All command).
G     To highlight several icons by dragging. You can drag diagonally to highlight a group of nearby icons, as shown 
in Figure 2-3. In a list view, in fact, you don't even have to drag over the icons themselves—your cursor can touch 
any part of any file's row, like its modification date or file size.
You can highlight several icons simultaneously by dragging a box around them. To do so, drag 
from outside of the target icons diagonally across them (right), creating a transparent gray 
rectangle as you go. Any icons or icon names touched by this rectangle are selected when you 
release the mouse. If you press the Shift or 
 key as you do this, any previously highlighted 
icons remain selected.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-3.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:48:40 AM

2.3 Selecting Icons
 
If you include a particular icon in your diagonally dragged group by mistake, 
-click it to 
remove it from the selected cluster. 
G     To highlight consecutive icons in a list. If you're looking at the contents of a window in list view or column view, 
you can drag vertically over the file and folder names to highlight a group of consecutive icons, as described above. 
(Begin the drag in a blank spot.)
But there's a faster way to do the same thing: Click the first icon you want to highlight, and then Shift-click the last 
file. All the files in between are automatically selected, along with the two icons you clicked. Figure 2-4 illustrates 
the idea.
Left: To select a block of files in list view, click the first one. While pressing Shift, click the last 
one. Mac OS X highlights all the files in between your clicks. This technique mirrors the way 
Shift-clicking works in a word processor and in many other kinds of programs.

2.3 Selecting Icons
Right: To remove one of the icons from your selection, 
-click it.
 
G     To highlight random icons. If you want to highlight only the first, third, and seventh icons in a window, for 
example, start by clicking icon No. 1. Then 
-click each of the others (or 
-drag new rectangles around them). 
Each icon darkens to show that you've selected it.
If you're highlighting a long string of icons and then click one by mistake, you don't have to start over. Instead, just 
-click it again, so that the dark highlighting disappears. (If you do want to start over from the beginning, you can 
deselect all selected icons by clicking any empty part of the window—or by pressing the Esc key.)
The 
 key trick is especially handy if you want to select almost all the icons in a window. Press 
-A to select 
everything in the folder, then 
-click any unwanted icons to deselect them.
In icon views, you can either Shift-click or 
-click to select multiple individual icons. But you 
may as well just learn to use the 
 key when selecting individual icons. That way, you won't 
have to use a different key in each view.

2.3 Selecting Icons
Once you've highlighted multiple icons, you can manipulate them all at once. For example, you can drag them en masse to 
another folder or disk by dragging any one of the highlighted icons. All other highlighted icons go along for the ride. This 
technique is especially useful when you want to back up a bunch of files by dragging them onto a different disk, delete them 
all by dragging them to the Trash, and so on.
When multiple icons are selected, the commands in the File and Edit menus—such as Duplicate, Open, and Make Alias—
apply to all of them simultaneously.
Don't forget that you can instantly highlight all the files in a window (or on the desktop) by 
choosing Edit
Select All (
-A)—no icon clicking required.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Contextual Menus, Action Menus
It's part of the Mac's user-friendly heritage: You can do practically everything using only the mouse. 
Everything is out front, unhidden, and clickable, whether it's an icon, button, or menu.
But as in rival operating systems, you can shave seconds and steps off of your workload if you master 
contextual menus: short menus that appear right on things you click and offer commands that the software 
thinks you might want to invoke at the moment, as shown here at top.
To summon a contextual menu (called a "shortcut menu" in Windows—and, by the way, in Panther's help 
screens for the first time), you click something —an icon, the desktop, inside a window, a link in Safari, text in 
a word processor—while pressing the Control key. (If you've bought a two-button mouse, right-clicking does 
the same thing.) A menu drops down listing relevant commands: Get Info, Move to Trash, Copy, and so on. 
You can either click the command you want, or type the first couple letters of it and then tap the Space bar.
These menus become more and more useful the more you get to know them. The trouble is, millions of Mac 
fans never even knew they existed.
That's why, in Mac OS X 10.3, Apple introduced a second way to access them. At the top of every Finder 
window, you'll find a sprocket-logoed pop-up menu that's technically called the Action menu (shown here at 
bottom).
It lists the same sorts of commands you'd find in the contextual menus, but offers two advantages. First, it's 
visible, so novices stand a better chance of stumbling onto it. Second, you don't need two hands to open it 
(one on the Control key, one on the mouse)—a distinct perk for anyone whose nondominant hand is already 
occupied with a refreshing beverage.

2.3 Selecting Icons
 
 
2.3.2 Selecting Icons from the Keyboard
For the speed fanatic, using the mouse to click an icon is a hopeless waste of time. Fortunately, you can also select an icon 
by typing the first couple letters of its name.
When looking at your Home window, for example, you can type M to highlight the Movies folder. And if you actually 
intended to highlight the Music folder instead, press the Tab key to highlight the next icon in the window alphabetically. Shift-

2.3 Selecting Icons
Tab highlights the previous icon alphabetically. Or use the arrow keys to highlight a neighboring icon.
(The Tab-key trick works only in icon and list views—not column view, alas. You can always use the right and left arrow 
keys to highlight adjacent columns, however.)
After highlighting an icon in this way, you can manipulate it using the commands in the File menu or their keyboard 
equivalents: open (
-O), put it into the Trash (
-Delete), Get Info (
-I), duplicate (
-D), or make an alias, as 
described later in this chapter (
-L). By turning on the special disability features described in Section 8.25.4, you can 
even move the highlighted icon using only the keyboard.
If you're a first-time Mac user, you may find it excessively nerdy to memorize keystrokes for functions the mouse performs 
perfectly well. If you make your living using the Mac, however, the speed and efficiency of these keystrokes will reward you 
immeasurably for memorizing them.

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons
In Mac OS X, there are two ways to move or copy icons from one place to another: by dragging them, or by using the Copy 
and Paste commands.
2.4.1 Copying by Dragging
You can drag icons from one folder to another, from one drive to another, from a drive to a folder on another drive, and so 
on. (When you've selected several icons, drag any one of them; the others tag along.) While the Mac is copying, you can 
tell that the process is still under way even if the progress bar is hidden behind a window, because the icon of the copied 
material shows up dimmed in its new home, darkening only when the copying process is over. You can cancel the process 
by pressing either 
-period or the Esc key.
If you're copying files into a disk or folder that already contains items with the same names, 
Mac OS X asks you individually about each one. ("An older item named 'Fiddlesticks' with 
extension '.doc' already exists in this location.") Note that, thank heaven, Mac OS X tells you 
whether or not the version you're replacing is older or newer than the one you're moving.
Click Replace or Don't Replace, as you see fit, or Stop to halt the whole copying business.
Understanding when the Mac copies a dragged icon and when it just moves the icon bewilders many a beginner. However, 
the scheme is fairly simple (see Figure 2-5) when you consider the following:
G     Dragging from one folder to another on the same disk moves the icon.
G     Dragging from one disk (or disk partition) to another copies the folder or file. (You can drag icons either into an 
open window or directly onto a disk or folder icon.)
G     If you press the Option key as you release an icon you've dragged, you copy the icon instead of moving it. Doing 
so within a single folder produces a duplicate of the file called "[Whatever its name was] copy."
G     If you press the 
 key as you release an icon you've dragged from one disk to another, you move the file or 
folder, in the process deleting it from the original disk.
This last trick is a dramatic change from the Mac OS 9 era, where you could never move an icon to a different disk. 
You had no choice but to manually delete the original from your hard drive after dragging it to the second disk.
Mac OS X frees you forever from this kind of housekeeping task.
This business of pressing Option or 
 after you begin dragging is a tad awkward, but it has 
its charms. For example, it means that you can change your mind about the purpose of your 
drag in mid-movement, without having to drag back and start over.

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons
2.4.2 Copying by Using Copy and Paste
Dragging icons to copy or move them probably feels good because it's so direct: You actually see your arrow cursor 
pushing the icons into the new location.
But you pay a price for this satisfying illusion. You may have to spend a moment or two fiddling with your windows to create 
a clear "line of drag" between the icon to be moved and the destination folder. (A background window will courteously pop 
to the foreground to accept your drag. But if it wasn't even open to begin with, you're out of luck.)
There's a better way. Use the Copy and Paste commands to move icons from one window into another (just as you can in 
Windows, by the way—except you can only copy, not cut, Mac icons). The routine goes like this:
1. Highlight the icon or icons you want to move. 
Use any of the techniques described in Section 2.3.
2. Choose Edit
Copy. 
Or press the keyboard shortcut: 
 -C.
You can combine steps 1 and 2 by Control-clicking an icon and choosing the Copy command 
from the contextual menu that appears—or by using the Action menu (Section 2.3.1). If 
you've selected several icons, say five, the command will say "Copy 5 items."
3. Open the window where you want to put the icons. Choose Edit
Paste. 
Once again, you may prefer to use the keyboard equivalent: 
 -V. And once again, you can also Control-click inside the 
window and then choose Paste from the contextual menu that appears, or you can use the Action menu.
A progress bar may appear as Mac OS X copies the files or folders; press Esc or 
 -period to interrupt the process. When 
the progress bar goes away, it means you've successfully transferred the icons, which now appear in the new window.
2.4.3 Spring-Loaded Folders: Dragging Icons into Closed Folders
Here's a common dilemma: you want to drag an icon not just into a folder, but into a folder nested inside that folder. This 
awkward challenge would ordinarily require you to open the folder, open the inner folder, drag the icon in, and then close 
both of the windows you opened. As you can imagine, the process is even messier if you want to drag an icon into a sub-
subfolder or even a sub-sub-subfolder.
Instead of fiddling around with all those windows, you can instead use the springloaded folders feature (see Figure 2-5).
It works like this: With a single drag, drag the icon onto the first folder—but keep your mouse button pressed. After a few 
seconds, the folder window opens automatically, centered on your cursor:
G     In icon view, the new window instantly replaces the original.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-4.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:48:44 AM

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons
G     In column view, you get a new column that shows the target folder's contents.
G     In list view, a second window appears.
Still keeping the button down, drag onto the inner folder; its window opens, too. Now drag onto the inner inner folder—and 
so on. (If the inner folder you intend to open isn't visible in the window, you can scroll by dragging your cursor close to any 
edge of the window.)
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Dragging to Copy a Disk
Help! I'm trying to copy a CD onto my hard drive. But when I drag it onto the hard drive icon, I get only an alias
—not a copy of the CD. I used to do this all the time in Mac OS 9, but I can't make it work now. 
Apple switched some things around in Mac OS X. Sure enough, dragging a disk onto a disk creates an alias 
now. But producing a copy of the dragged icon is easy enough: Just press Option or 
 as you drag.
Honestly, though: Why are you trying to copy a disc this way? Using Disk Utility (Section 9.25.13) saves 
space, lets you assign a password, and usually fools whatever software was on the CD into thinking that it's 
still on the original CD.
You can even drag icons onto disks or folders whose icons appear in the Sidebar (Chapter 
1). When you do so, the main part of the window flashes to reveal the contents of the disk or 
folder you've dragged onto. When you let go of the mouse, the main window changes back 
to reveal the contents of the disk or folder where you started dragging.
In short, Sidebar combined with spring-loaded folders make a terrific drag-and-drop way to 
file a desktop icon from anywhere to anywhere—without having to open or close any 
windows at all.
Top: To make spring-loaded folders work, start by dragging an icon onto a folder or disk icon. 
Don't release the mouse button. Wait for the window to open automatically around your cursor.
Bottom: Now you can either let go of the mouse button to release the file in its new window or 
drag onto yet another, inner folder. It, too, will open. As long as you don't release the mouse 
button, you can continue until you've reached your folderwithin- a-folder destination.

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons
 
When you finally release the mouse, you're left facing the final window. All the previous windows closed on the way (a 
change from previous versions of the Mac OS). You've neatly placed the icon into the core of the nested folders.
NOTE
Longtime Mac fans should note that the second half of the old spring-loaded folder feature, the click-and- a-
half, doesn't work in Mac OS X 10.3. That is, you can't open a folder within a folder by double-clicking and 
then holding down the button as you point to one folder after another, just to see what's inside. You must 
drag an icon.

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons
2.4.4 Making Spring-Loaded Folders Work
That spring-loaded folder technique sounds good in theory, but can be disconcerting in practice. For most people, the long 
wait before the first folder opens is almost enough wasted time to negate the value of the feature altogether. Furthermore, 
when the first window finally does open, you're often caught by surprise. Suddenly your cursor—mouse button still down—
is inside a window, sometimes directly on top of another folder you never intended to open. But before you can react, its 
window, too, has opened, and you find yourself out of control.
Fortunately, you can regain control of spring-loaded folders using these tricks:
G     Choose Finder
Preferences. On the General pane, adjust the "Spring-loaded folders and windows" slider to a 
setting that drives you less crazy. For example, if you find yourself waiting too long before the first folder opens, 
drag the slider toward the Short setting.
G     You can turn off this feature entirely by choosing Finder
Preferences and turning off the "Spring-loaded folders 
and windows" checkbox.
G     Tap the Space bar to make the folder spring open at your command. That is, even with the Finder
Preferences 
slider set to the Long delay setting, you can force each folder to spring open when you are ready by tapping the 
Space bar as you
POWER USERS' CLINIC 
Designing Your Own Icons
You don't have to be content with the icons provided by Microsoft, Apple, or whoever else wrote your 
software. You can paste new icons onto your file, disk, and folder icons to help you pick them out at a glance.
The easiest way to replace an icon is to copy it from another icon. To do so, highlight the icon, hold down the 
Option key, choose File
Show Inspector (see Section 2.8.1), click the existing icon in the resulting 
window, and then choose Edit
Copy.
Now click the icon to which you want to transfer the copied picture. Its icon now appears in the Info dialog box 
that's still open on the screen. Click the icon in the dialog box, and this time choose Edit
Paste.
If you'd rather introduce all-new icons, you're welcome to steal some of the beautifully designed ones at www.
iconfactory.com and the icon sites linked to it. Once you've downloaded these special icon files, you can copy 
their images from the Get Info window as you would any icon.
To design a Mac OS X icon from scratch, you could, of course, use a graphics program like Photoshop, the 
painting module of AppleWorks, or shareware like GraphicConverter. (Remember to make your new icons 
128 pixels square.) But sooner or later, you'll want to finish up in Iconographer (available from the "Missing 
CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com format required by Mac OS X.
Once you've saved your icon file, select it, choose File
Get Info, and then copy and paste its icon as 
described above.
Note that you can't change certain folder icons that Mac OS X considers important, such as Applications or 
System (at least not without CandyBar, described in Section 17.3). You can, however, change the special

2.4 Moving and Copying Icons

You're also not allowed to change icons that belong to other people who share your Mac and sign in under a 
different name (Chapter 11).
hold down the mouse button. True, you need two hands to master this one, but the control you regain is immeasurable.
The Space bar trick works even when "Spring-loaded folders and windows" checkbox (in 
Finder
 Preferences) is turned off. That's a handy arrangement, because it means that 
folder windows will never pop open accidentally.
G     Whenever a folder springs open into a window, twitch your mouse cursor up to the newly opened window's title bar 
or information strip. Doing so ensures that your cursor won't wind up hovering on, and accidentally opening up an 
inner folder. With the cursor parked on the info strip, you can take your time to survey the newly opened window's 
contents, and plunge into an inner folder only after gaining your bearings.
Mail programs like Entourage and Mail have spring-loaded folders, too. You can drag a 
message out of the list and onto one of your filing folders, wait for the folder to spring open 
and reveal its subfolders, and then drag directly into one of them.

2.5 Aliases: Icons in Two Places at Once
Highlighting an icon and then choosing File
Make Alias (or pressing 
 -L), generates an alias, a specially branded 
duplicate of the original icon (see Figure 2-6). It's not a duplicate of the file—just of the icon; therefore it requires negligible 
storage space. When you double-click the alias, the original file opens. (A Macintosh alias is essentially the same as a 
Windows shortcut.)
Because you can create as many aliases as you want of a single file, aliases let you, in effect, stash that file in many 
different folder locations simultaneously. Double-click any one of them, and you open the original icon, wherever it may be 
on your system.
Top: You can identify an alias by the tiny arrow badge on the lower-left corner. (Longtime Mac 
fans should note that the name no longer appears in italics.)
Bottom: If the alias can't find the original file, you're offered the chance to hook it up with a 
different file.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-5.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:48:47 AM

2.5 Aliases: Icons in Two Places at Once
You can also create an alias of an icon by Option-
-dragging it out of its window. (Aliases 
you create this way lack the word alias on the file name—a distinct delight to those who find 
the suffix redundant and annoying.) You can also create an alias by Control-clicking a normal 
icon and choosing Make Alias from the contextual menu that appears, or by highlighting an 
icon and then choosing Make Alias from the Action menu.
2.5.1 What's Good about Aliases
An alias takes up almost no disk space, even if the original file is enormous. Aliases are smart, too: Even if you rename the 
alias, rename the original file, move the alias, and move the original around on the disk, double-clicking the alias still opens 
the original icon.
And that's just the beginning of alias intelligence. Suppose you make an alias of a file that's on a removable disc, like a CD. 
When you double-click the alias on your hard drive, the Mac requests that particular disc by name. And if you double-click 
the alias of a file on a different machine on the network, your Mac attempts to connect to the appropriate machine, 
prompting you for a password (see Chapter 12)—even if the other machine is thousands of miles away and your Mac must 
dial the modem to connect.
Here are a few ways you can put aliases to work:
G     You may want to file a document you're working on in several different folders, or place a particular folder in 
several different locations.
G     You can use the alias feature to save you some of the steps required to access another hard drive on the network. 
(Details on this trick in Chapter 12.)
G     It's useful to put aliases of your Mac OS 9 programs, if you're still using any, into the Applications folder, so that 
they appear listed among the Mac OS X programs. Now all your programs are, in effect, in one place.
Mac OS X makes it easy to find the file to which an alias "points" without actually having to 
open it. Just highlight the alias and then choose File
Show Original (
-R), or choose 
Show Original from the Action menu. Mac OS X immediately displays the actual, original file, 
sitting patiently in its folder, wherever that may be.
2.5.2 Broken Aliases
An alias doesn't contain any of the information you've typed or composed in the original. Don't burn an alias of your slide 
show onto a CD and then depart for the airport, hoping to give the presentation upon your arrival in Tokyo. When you 
double-click the alias, now separated from its original, you'll be shown the dialog box at bottom in Figure 2-6.
If you're on a plane 3,000 miles away from the hard drive on which the original file resides, click Delete Alias (to delete the 
orphan alias you just double-clicked) or OK (to do nothing, leaving the orphaned alias where it is).
In certain circumstances, however, the third button—Fix Alias—is the most useful of all. Click it to summon the Fix Alias 
dialog box, which you can use to navigate your entire Mac. When you click a new icon and then click Choose, you

2.5 Aliases: Icons in Two Places at Once
associate the orphaned alias with a different original icon.
Such techniques become handy when, for example, you click your book manuscript's alias on the desktop, forgetting that 
you recently saved it under a new name and deleted the older draft. Instead of simply showing you an error message that 
says "'Enron Corporate Ethics Handbook' can't be found," the Mac displays the box that contains the Fix Alias button. By 
clicking it, thus reassociating it with the new document, you can save yourself the trouble of creating a new alias. From now 
on, double-clicking your manuscript's alias on the desktop opens the new draft.
You don't have to wait until the original file no longer exists before choosing a new original 
for an alias. You can perform alias reassignment surgery any time you like. Just highlight the 
alias icon and then choose File
Get Info. In the Get Info dialog box, click Select New 
Original. In the resulting window, find and double-click the file you'd now like to open 
whenever you double-click the alias.

2.6 Color Labels

2.6 Color Labels
Mac OS X 10.3 introduces—or, rather, reintroduces—a welcome blast from the Macintosh past: icon labels. This feature 
lets you tag selected icons with one of seven different labels, each of which has both a text label and a color associated 
with it.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Favorites Reborn
Hey! Where the heck are my Favorites? 
In previous versions of Mac OS X, the File
Add to Favorites command placed the names of icons you've 
highlighted into a submenu of the Go
Favorites command. The Favorites scheme, in other words, was 
yet another mechanism of listing your favorite files, folders, programs, disks, and even network-accessible 
folders for quick access.
Trouble was, Mac OS X already had a number of different methods for stashing favorite icons for convenient 
access, like the Dock, the Finder toolbar, and the Sidebar. So Apple decided that enough was enough. 
There's no more Add to Favorites command, and there's no more Go
Favorites command.
There is, however, still a Favorites folder. It's sitting right there in your Home
Library folder.
If you miss this feature—maybe you upgraded from Mac OS X 10.2 and you've got a bunch of stuff already 
listed in your Favorites—you'll find the new 10.3 scheme to be much simpler.
First drag the Favorites folder into your Sidebar (Section 1.2.1).
From now on, whenever you want to designate an icon as a Favorite, drag it onto the Favorites folder icon in 
your Sidebar. (Or Option-
 drag it to create an alias.)
Thereafter, to view your collection of faves, just click the Favorites icon.
This new system is both simpler and easier to understand than the previous mechanism. In fact, this feature 
may become one of your...favorites.
To do so, highlight the icons. Open the File menu (or the Action menu, or the contextual menu that appears when you 
Control-click the icons). There, under the heading Color Label, you'll see seven colored dots, which represent the seven 
different labels you can use. Figure 2-7 shows the routine.
Top: Use the File menu, Action menu, or contextual menu to apply label tags to highlighted 
icons.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-6.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 4:48:51 AM

2.6 Color Labels
Bottom: Instantly, the icon's icon and name take on the selected shade. In a list or column view, 
the entire row takes on that shade, as shown in Figure 2-8. (If you choose the little X, you're 
removing any labels that you may have applied.)
 
2.6.1 What Labels Are Good For
After you've applied labels to icons, you can perform some unique file-management tasks—in some cases, on all of them 
simultaneously, even if they're scattered across multiple hard drives. For example:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-6.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:48:51 AM

2.6 Color Labels
G     Round up files with Find. Using the Find command described later in this chapter, you can round up all icons with 
a particular label. Thereafter, moving these icons en masse is a piece of cake—choose Edit
Select All, and 
then drag any one of the highlighted icons out of the results window and into the target folder or disk.
Using labels in conjunction with Find in this way is one of the most useful and inexpensive backup schemes ever 
devised—whenever you finish working on a document that you'd like to back up, Control-click it and apply a label 
called, for example, Backup. At the end of each day, use the Find command to round up all files with the Backup 
label—and then drag them as a group onto your backup disk.
G     Sort a list view by label. No other Mac sorting method lets you create an arbitrary order for the icons in a window. 
When you sort by label, the Mac creates alphabetical clusters within each label grouping, as shown in Figure 2-8.
This technique might be useful when, for example, your job is to process several different folders of documents; for 
each folder, you're supposed to convert graphics files, throw out old files, or whatever. As soon as you finish 
working your way through one folder, flag it with a label called Done. The folder jumps to the top or bottom) of the 
window, safely marked for your reference pleasure, leaving the next unprocessed folder at your fingertips, ready to 
go.
Sorting by label lets you create several different alphabetical groups within a single list. (The 
ability to sort by label is available only if you first make the label column visible. Do so by 
choosing View
Show View Options and turning on the Label checkbox.)

2.6 Color Labels
 
G     Track progress. Use different color labels to track the status of files in a certain project. The first drafts have no 
labels at all. Once they've been edited and approved, make them blue. Once they've been sent to the home office, 
they turn purple. (Heck, you could have all kinds of fun with this: money-losing projects get red tints; profitable ones 
get green; things that make you sad are blue. Or maybe not.)
2.6.2 Changing Labels
When you first install Mac OS X, the seven labels in the File menu are named for the colors they show: Red, Orange, 
Yellow, and so on. Clearly, the label feature would be much more useful if you could rewrite these labels, tailoring them to 
your purposes.
Doing so is easy: choose Finder
Preferences. Click the Labels button. Now you see the dialog box shown in Figure 2-
9, where you can edit the text of each label.

2.6 Color Labels
Top left: In the Labels tab of the Preferences dialog box, you can change the predefined label 
text. Each label can be up to 31 letters and spaces long.
Bottom right: Now your list and column views reveal meaningful text tags instead of color 
names.

2.7 The Trash
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
2.7 The Trash
No single element of the Macintosh interface is as recognizable or famous as the Trash can, which now appears at the end 
of the Dock.
You can discard almost any icon by dragging it onto the Trash icon (which actually resembles a wastebasket, not a trash 
can, but let's not quibble). When the tip of your arrow cursor touches the Trash icon, the little wastebasket turns black. 
When you release the mouse, you're well on your way to discarding whatever it was you dragged. As a convenience, Mac 
OS X even replaces the empty-wastebasket icon with a wastebasket-filled-with-crumpled-up-papers icon, to let you know 
there's something in there.
Learn the keyboard alternative to dragging something to the Trash: highlight the icon and 
then press 
-Delete. This technique is not only far faster than dragging, but requires far 
less precision, especially if you have a large screen. Mac OS X does all the Trash-targeting 
for you.
2.7.1 Rescuing Files and Folders from the Trash
File and folder icons sit in the Trash forever—or until you choose Finder
Empty Trash, whichever comes first.
If you haven't yet emptied the Trash, you can open its window by clicking the wastebasket icon once. Now you can review 
its contents: icons that you've placed on the waiting list for extinction. If you change your mind, you can rescue any of these 
items by dragging them out of the Trash window.
If dragging something to the Trash was the last thing you did, you can press 
-Z—the 
keyboard shortcut of the Edit
Undo command. This not only removes it from the Trash, 
but also returns it to the folder from whence it came. This trick works even if the Trash 
window isn't open.
2.7.2 Emptying the Trash I: Quick and Easy
If you're confident that the items in the Trash window are worth deleting, use any of these three options:
G     Choose Finder
Empty Trash.
G     Press Shift-
-Delete. Or, if you'd just as soon not bother with the "Are you sure?" message, throw the Option key 
in there, too.
G     Control-click the wastebasket icon (or just click it and hold the mouse button down for a moment); choose Empty 
Trash from the contextual menu.

2.7 The Trash
Top: Your last warning. Mac OS X doesn't tell you how many items are in the Trash or how 
much disk space they take up.
Bottom: The Get Info window for a locked file. Locking a file in this way isn't military-level 
security by any stretch—any passing evildoer can unlock the file in the same way. But it does 
trigger an "operation cannot be completed" warning when you try to put it into the Trash—or 
indeed when you try to drag it into any other folder—providing at least one layer of protection 
against mistakes.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-7.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 4:48:54 AM

2.7 The Trash
This last method has two advantages. First, the Mac doesn't bother asking "Are you 
sure?" (If you're clicking right on the Trash and choosing Empty Trash from the pop-up 
menu, it's pretty darned obvious you are sure.) Second, this method nukes any locked files 
without making you unlock them first.
If you use either of the first two methods, the Macintosh asks you to confirm your decision (see Figure 2-10). Click OK.
Either way, Mac OS X now deletes those files from your hard drive.
2.7.3 Emptying the Trash II: Secure and Forever
When you empty the Trash as described above, each Trashed icon sure looks like it disappears. The truth is, though, that 
the data in each file is still on the hard drive. Yes, the space occupied by the dearly departed is now marked with an internal 
"This space available" message, and in time, new files that you save may overwrite that spot. But in the meantime, some 
future eBay buyer of your Mac—or, more imminently, a savvy family member or office mate—could use a program like 
Norton Utilities to resurrect those deleted files. (In even more dire cases, companies like DriveSavers. com can use 
sophisticated clean-room techniques to recover crucial information—for several hundred dollars, of course.)
That notion doesn't sit well with certain groups, like government agencies, international spies, and the paranoid. As far as 
they're concerned, deleting a file should really, really delete it, irrevocably, irretrievably, and forever.
Mac OS X 10.3 introduces a new command, therefore, called Secure Empty Trash. When you choose this command from 
the Finder menu, the Mac doesn't just obliterate the parking spaces around the dead file. It actually records new information 
over the old—random 0's and 1's. Pure static gibberish.
The process takes longer than the normal Empty Trash command, of course. But when it absolutely, positively has to be 
gone from this earth for good (and you're absolutely, positively sure you'll never need that file again), Secure Empty Trash 
is secure indeed.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Opening Things in the Trash
Now and then, it's very useful to see what some document in the Trash is before committing it to oblivion—
and the only way to do that is to open it.
Trouble is, you can't open it by double-clicking; you'll get nothing but an error message.
Or at least that's what Apple wants you to think.
There is, of course, a workaround: Drag the document onto the icon of a program that can open it. That is, if a 
file called Don't Read Me.txt is in the Trash, you can drag it onto, say, the Word or TextEdit icon in your Dock.
The document dutifully pops open on the screen. Inspect, close, and then empty the Trash (or rescue the 
document).

2.7 The Trash
2.7.4 Locked Files: The Next Generation
By highlighting a file or folder, choosing File
Get Info, and turning on the Locked checkbox, you protect that file or 
folder from accidental deletion (see Figure 2-10 at bottom). A little padlock icon appears on the corner of the full-size icon, 
also shown in Figure 2-10.
Mac OS X doesn't even let you put a locked icon into the Trash—or any other folder. You can't put the icon of an open 
program into the Trash, either.
If something that's already in the Trash turns out to be locked, click and hold on the Trash itself. Now, when you choose 
Empty Trash from its contextual pop-up menu, Mac OS X empties the Trash without warnings, locked files and all.
Of course, the other alternative is to unlock what's in the Trash. Fortunately, there's a quick way to do so. Click the Trash 
icon to open its window, then highlight the icons you want to unlock (or choose Edit
Select All).
Now press 
 -I (or choose File
Get Info). Turn off the Locked checkbox in the resulting Info window. (Yes, you can 
lock or unlock a mass of files at once.) Now you can send the newly unprotected files to data heaven without any fancy 
tricks.
(If you're still having trouble emptying the Trash, see Chapter 16 for some helpful Unix commands.)

2.8 Get Info
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
2.8 Get Info
By clicking an icon and then choosing File
Get Info, you open an important window like the one shown in Figure 2-11. 
It's a collapsible, multi-panel screen that provides a wealth of information about a highlighted icon. For example:
G     For a disk icon, you get statistics about its capacity and how much of it is full.
G     For a document icon, you see when it was created and modified, and what programs it "belongs" to.
G     For an alias, you learn the location of the actual icon it refers to.
G     If you open the Get Info window when nothing is selected, you get information about the desktop itself (or the open 
window), including the amount of disk space consumed by everything sitting on or in it.
G     If you highlight a gaggle of icons all at once, the Get Info window shows you how many you highlighted, breaks it 
down by type ("23 documents, 3 folders," for example), and adds up the total of their file sizes. This is a great 
opportunity to change certain file characteristics on numerous files simultaneously, such as locking or unlocking 
them, hiding or showing their file name extensions (Section 4.5.2), changing their ownership or permissions 
(Section 12.2.10), and so on.
2.8.1 Uni-window vs. Multi-window
In Mac OS X versions 10.0 and 10.1, a single Info window remained on the screen all the time as you clicked one icon after 
another. (Furthermore, the command was called Show Info instead of Get Info. Evidently "Show Info" sounded too much 
like it was the playbill for a Broadway musical.)
Top: The Get Info window can be as small as this, with all of its information panels "collapsed."
Bottom: Or it can be as huge as this (it's shown here split in two because the book isn't tall 
enough to show the whole thing)—if you click each flippy triangle to open its corresponding 
panel of information. The resulting dialog box can easily grow taller than your screen, which is 
a good argument for either (a) closing the panels you don't need at any given moment or (b) 
running out to buy a really gigantic monitor.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-8.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 4:48:57 AM

2.8 Get Info
 
The single info window was great for reducing clutter, but it didn't let you compare the statistics for the Get Info windows of 
two or three folders side by side.
In 10.2 and 10.3, Apple returned to the old way of doing Get Info: A new dialog box appears each time you get info on an 
icon.
But the uni-window approach is still available for those occasions when you don't need side-by-side Get Info windows—if 
you know the secret. Highlight the icon and then press Option-
-I (or hold down Option and choose Show Inspector from 
the File menu). The Get Info window that appears looks slightly different (it lacks Minimize and Zoom buttons), and it 
changes to reflect whatever icon you now click.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-8.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 4:48:57 AM

2.8 Get Info
2.8.2 The Get Info Panels
Apple built the Get Info window out of a series of collapsed "flippy triangles," as shown in Figure 2-11. Click a triangle to 
expand a corresponding information panel.
Depending on whether you clicked a document, program, disk, alias, or whatever, the various panels may include the 
following:
G     General. Here's where you can view (and edit) the name of the icon, and also see its size, creation date, most 
recent change date, Locked status, and so on.
If you click a disk, this info window shows you its capacity and how full it is. If you click the Trash, you see how 
much stuff is in it. If you click an alias, this panel shows you a Select New Original button and reveals where the 
original file is. The General panel always opens the first time you summon the Get Info window.
G     Name & Extension. On this panel, you can read and edit the name of the icon in question. The "Hide extension" 
checkbox refers to the suffix on Mac OS X file names (the last three letters of Letter to Congress.doc, for example).
As described in Section 4.5.2, many Mac OS X documents, behind the scenes, have file name extensions of this 
kind—but Mac OS X comes factory-set to hide them. By turning off this checkbox, you can make the suffix 
reappear for an individual file. (Conversely, if you've elected to have Mac OS X show all file name suffixes, this 
checkbox lets you hide file name extensions on individual icons.)
G     Content index. As noted at the end of this Chapter, Mac OS X's Find program can locate files based on the words 
inside them, regardless of the actual names of the files. It can perform this magic only in folders that have been 
indexed (Section 2.10.2.2), however. This panel (visible for folders only) lets you know when a folder was last 
indexed, and allows you to index the folder manually or to delete the existing index file to save disk space.
G     Memory. You'll see this option only when showing info for Classic programs (those that haven't been updated for 
Mac OS X). There are three different memory statistics: Suggested Size (the software company's official 
recommendation), Minimum Size (below which the program won't even run—a number you shouldn't change), and 
Preferred Size. This final number is the one you should feel free to adjust, arming the program with more memory if 
it seems unstable or slow in your Classic world (Chapter 5).
G     Open with. This chapter is available for documents only. Use the controls on this screen to specify which program 
will open when you double-click this document, or all documents of its type. (Details in Section 4.5.2.)
G     Preview. On this panel, you see a handsome, very large thumbnail image. In the case of spreadsheets, word 
processing documents, HTML documents, and so on, this is nothing to write home about—you see only a 
magnified version of the generic document icon.
But when you're examining pictures, text files, PDF files, sounds, clippings, and movies, this feature can be 
extremely useful. As you click each icon, you see a magnified thumbnail version of what's actually in that 
document. A controller lets you play sounds and movies, where appropriate.
G     Languages. The menus and dialog boxes of well-written Mac OS X programs (iMovie and iPhoto, for example) 
appear by magic in whatever language you choose. The trouble is, your hard drive carries a lot of baggage as a 
result; it must store the wording for every menu and dialog box in every language.
If you're pretty sure you do most of your computing in just one language, expand the Languages tab, select all of 
the languages you don't speak, and click Remove. You'll save disk space and clutter.
G     Ownership & Permissions. This is available for all kinds of icons. If other people have access to your Mac (either 
from across the network or when logging in, in person), this panel lets you specify who is allowed to open or 
change this particular icon. See Chapter 12 for a complete discussion of this hairy topic.
G     Comments. Here, you can type in random comments for your own reference. Later, you can view these remarks in 
any list view, as illustrated in Section 1.5.4.
Here and there, you may even see other panels in the Get Info window, especially when you get info on application icons. 
For example, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD each offer a Plugins panel that lets you manage add-on software modules.

2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
In Panther, you have two different search tools for rounding up files and folders you're looking for.
The first one, the Search bar (Figure 2-12), is especially convenient because you can opt to have it appear at the top of 
every Finder window, all the time, ever ready to help you ferret out a stray icon. After 20 years, the Finder's name is finally 
justified.
In Mac OS X 10.3, moreover, it's a much more flexible tool. It's no longer limited to searching the window you're in.
On the other hand, it's only good for finding icons whose names you know. If you want to search for a file you created on a 
certain date, or to search for words inside your files, see Section 2.10.
2.9.1 The Search Bar
If you don't see the little round-ended box at the top of every Find window, then check these conditions, all of which are 
described in the Finder toolbar discussion beginning in Section 3.3.4:
G     Your Finder toolbar must, in fact, be visible (see Section 3.4.1).
G     The window must be wide enough to reveal the Search bar.
G     The Search bar must be on the toolbar to begin with (Section 3.4.2.2).
2.9.2 Performing the Search
If all is well, and the Search bar is staring you in the face, here's how to use it.
2.9.2.1 Step 1: Where to look
First, click the magnifying-glass icon inside the Search bar. From the pop-up menu (at top in Figure 2-12), specify where 
you want Find to do its searching. Your choices are:
The Search bar is a kind of software sieve that lets you screen out the rabble in a folder window 
filled with files.
Top: Before you search, specify where you want to search, using the tiny pop-up menu.
Middle: The upper half of the results window lists the files that Mac OS X found. The lower part 
offers the path, or map, that shows you where the highlighted found icon is filed. You can drag 
the horizontal divider between the halves of this window upward or downward to adjust the 
relative sizes of the panes.
Bottom: If the bottom half of the window isn't tall enough to display the ladder-like folder path, 
it shows you this compressed form.

2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
 
G     Everywhere. Not much ambiguity here. You want to round up every file with certain text in its name, wherever it 
may be on your Mac, your iDisk (Section 18.9.1), or even on your network.
G     Local disks. You're saying, "I just want to search my own machine. I don't care about the network, Internet-based 
disks, or whatever."
G     Home. Home refers to your own Home folder (Section 2.1). Now you're rooting through only your own stuff. As a 
result, the search is much faster, since you're not wasting time searching through, for example, your software 
programs and Mac OS X's own system files.
G     Selection. If you know that the file you're trying to find is in a certain folder, or on a certain disk, click that folder or 
disk's icon, wherever it may be on your screen. (You can also select a batch of them.) Mac OS X will confine its 
search to these items.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-9.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:01 AM

2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
If you choose Selection and then don't highlight any disk or folder icons, Mac OS X searches 
only the window you're in (and all folders inside it). It works, in other words, just as Mac OS X 
10.2 did.
It's also really fast; the files generally appear in the list in real time, as you type.
2.9.2.2 Step 2: What to find
Once you've set up the boundaries of your search, start typing the name of the file or folder name you're seeking. For 
example, if you're trying to find a file called Pokémon Fantasy League.doc, typing just pok or leag would probably suffice.
As you type—or, more realistically, a second or two after you type each letter—the window changes to reveal, item by item, 
a list of the files and folders whose names contain what you typed (at middle in Figure 2-12).
While the searching is going on, various controls spring to life:
G     A sprocket icon whirls away in the lower-right corner of the window. If a search is taking a long time, you're free to 
switch into another program while the Search bar keeps working in the background.
G     To pause or cancel the search in progress, click the X button next to the sprocket. (The other X button, the one 
next to the search word you typed, means "clear this box so I can type a different word.")
Once you've halted the search in this way, you can click the circular-arrow button (identified in Figure 2-12) to 
resume the original search.
G     The Parent column, new in 10.3, tells you at a glance where each found file is—that is, which folder contains it. 
Yes, sure, the lower pane tells you the full folder path. But often, just knowing whether this is the Neiman Marcus 
Cookies recipe in your Pictures folder or the one in your Documents folder is all you really need to know.
NOTE
If you share your Mac with other people, as described in Chapter 11, you'll generally see only the files that 
belong to you. The Search bar doesn't show you anything in folders that are off-limits to you, like the 
Documents and Pictures folders of other people.
There are exceptions, however. For instance, you'll be able to find files and folders that have been explicitly 
put into the Public or Shared folders, as described in Chapter 12. You may also be able to see icons that are 
sitting in other people's Home folders that haven't been further filed into inner folders (like the Documents 
folder).
2.9.3 What to Do with Search Results
You can manipulate the list of search results much the way you'd approach a list of files in a standard Finder list view 
window. You can move up or down the list by pressing the arrow keys, scroll a "page" at a time with the Page Up and Page 
Down keys, and so on. You can also highlight multiple icons simultaneously, the same way you would in a Finder list view: 
Highlight all of them by choosing Edit
Select All, highlight individual items by 
-clicking them, drag diagonally to 
enclose a cluster of found items, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-9.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:01 AM

2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
Or you can proceed in any of these ways:
2.9.3.1 Find out where something is
If you click once on any item in the results list, the bottom half of the window becomes a folder map that shows you where 
that item is. Depending on how tall the window is, you may see either of the two notations illustrated in Figure 2-12 (a 
ladder-like display or an arrow notation like the one in this book, as in "Users
Chris").
For example, in Figure 2-12, the notation in the bottom half of the window (read from bottom to top) means: "The About 
AppleScript Studio.pdf icon you found is in the Developer Tools folder, which is in the Installers folder, which is in the 
Applications folder, which is on the hard drive called Macintosh HD."
To get your hands on the actual icon, choose File
Open Enclosing Folder (
-R). The Search Results window retreats 
to the background, as Mac OS X highlights the actual icon in question, sitting there in its window wherever it happens to be 
on your hard drive.
2.9.3.2 Go back where you began
Go back where you began If you're content with the results of the search, but don't actually want to act on it (by opening the 
file you found, for example), just hit the Back button at the top of the window (or press 
-[). You return to the window you 
were viewing before your search began.
2.9.3.3 Open the file (or open one of the folders it's in)
If one of the found files is the one you were looking for, double-click it to open it (or highlight it and press 
-O). In many 
cases, you'll never even know or care where the file was—you just want to get into it.
You can also double-click to open any of the folders that appear in the folder map in the bottom half of the window. For 
example, in Figure 2-12, you could double-click the selected PDF icon to open it, or the Developer Tools folder to open it, 
and so on.
2.9.3.4 Move or delete the file
You can drag an item directly out of the found-files list and into a different folder, window, or disk—or straight to the Trash. 
The folder map at the bottom of the window updates itself to reflect the file's new location.
2.9.3.5 Rename the file
You can even rename a highlighted file in the Search Results window, just as though it's sitting in a Finder list view window. 
Click its name once, wait for the renaming rectangle to appear, and then type over the old name.
2.9.3.6 File-menu commands
After highlighting an icon (or icons) in the list of found files, you can use the commands in the File menu, including Get Info 
and Move to Trash.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-2-SECT-9.html (4 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:01 AM

2.9 Finding Files 1: The Search Bar
2.9.3.7 Adjust the list
By clicking the column headings (make the window wider if necessary to see them), you can sort the list of found files in 
various ways: by parent folder, name, size, date, and so on. (You can reverse the order by clicking the same heading a 
second time.) You can also make the window bigger by dragging the lower-right corner handle, adjusting the relative widths 
of the columns by dragging the column-name dividers, or rearranging the columns horizontally by dragging their names. All 
of this works exactly as it does in a Finder list view window.
2.9.3.8 Copy a file
To copy a file, Option-drag it out of the Search Results window and onto the desktop, into a different window, or onto a disk 
or folder icon. Alternatively, highlight the file and then choose Edit
Copy "Bunion Treatments.doc" (or whatever the file's 
name is). Then click inside a folder window, or click a folder itself, before choosing Edit
 Paste.
2.9.3.9 Make an alias
You can make an alias for one of the found items exactly the way you would in a Finder window: drag it out of the window 
while pressing 
-Option. The alias appears wherever you release the mouse (on the desktop, for example).
2.9.3.10 Start over
If you'd like to repeat the search using a different search phrase, just edit the text in the Search bar. The results pane 
updates itself as you type.
2.9.3.11 Give up
If none of these avenues suits your fancy, you can simply close the Search window as you would any other (
-W).

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
The Search bar is simple, fast, and above all, convenient. It's always there, happy to serve you, no matter what Finder 
window you're in.
It's not, however, the most powerful search program on earth. It searches only for icons' names, not their sizes, dates, and 
so on. And it can't look for words inside your files.
There is a feature that can perform these more complex searches, though; in fact, no modern self-respecting operating 
system would be without it. But here's a bit of news that may shock veteran Mac and Windows users: In Mac OS X 10.3, 
you don't search your own machine using the same program you use to search the Web. (Heresy! Scandal! Sacrilege!)
Actually, it's a move to be applauded. Over the years, be-all, end-all search programs like Apple's Sherlock and Microsoft's 
Search Assistant had become slow, sluggish, ungainly creatures that didn't do either job especially well. In Mac OS X 10.3 
(as in 10.2), you use one program just for finding files on your Mac, and a different one (Sherlock) to search the Internet. 
(More on Sherlock in Chapter 20.)
To meet the new file-finding tool, choose File
Find (or press 
-F). The shockingly simple dialog box shown in Figure 
2-13 appears next.
As you'll soon discover, the Find window can hunt down icons using extremely specific criteria. If you spent enough time 
setting up the search, you could use this program to find a document whose name begins with the letters Cro, is over one 
megabyte in size, was created after 10/1/03 but before the end of the year, was changed within the last week, has the file 
name suffix .doc, and contains the phrase "attitude adjustment." (Of course, if you knew that much about a file, you'd 
probably know where it is, too, without having to use the Find window. But you get the picture.)
To use the Find window, you need to feed it two pieces of information: where you want it to search, and what to look for. 
You can make both of these criteria as simple or complex as you like.
The first time you use it, the new Find program opens up ready to search by file name and file 
content, as shown here, because those are the most common kinds of search. But don't settle—
Find has many more tricks up its software sleeve.

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
 
2.10.1 Where to Look
The pop-up menu at the top of the window lets you specify where you want Find to do its searching. Your choices are 
Everywhere, Local Disks, Home—which correspond with the options described in Section 2.9.2.2—and one called Specific 
Places, which lets you limit your search to certain disks or folders (see Figure 2-14).
To limit (and thereby speed up) a search, choose Speci fic Places from the pop-up menu and 
then drag a disk, a folder, or a set of folders directly off the desktop and into the list of folders 
and disks. (To ditch them, click Remove.)

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
2.10.2 What to Look For
The first time you open the Find window after turning on your Mac OS X 10.3 machine, two boxes appear that need filling 
in: Name and Content (that is, words inside the files).
But those are only starting points. In all, Find lets you define a search using up to 11 different criteria (date modified, file 
size, and so on). Figure 2-15 illustrates how detailed this kind of search can be.
To add a criterion to the list, click one of the + buttons at the right end of the dialog box. A new row appears in the Find 
window, whose pop-up menus you can use to specify what date, what file size, and so on.
To delete a row from the Find window, click the - button at its right end.
Here's a rundown of the eight kinds of information you can search for, as they appear in the first pop-up menu of a row.
2.10.2.1 Name
To find a file whose name you know, just type a few letters of its name into the blank. (Capitalization doesn't matter.)
Of course, if all you want to do is find files whose names include Sales, you may as well save yourself all of this reading and 
use the Search bar described in the previous section. But using the Find program instead offers you far more control, 
thanks to the pop-up menu that offers you these options:
G     Contains. The position of the letters you type doesn't matter. If you type then, you'll find files with names like "Then 
and Now," "Authentic Cajun Recipes," and "Lovable Heathen."
G     Starts with. The Find program will find only files beginning with the letters you type. If you type then, you'll find 
"Then and Now," but not "Authentic Cajun Recipes" or "Lovable Heathen."
By repeatedly clicking the + button at the right end of the search criteria rows, you can limit 
your search to files that were created before or after a certain date, that are larger or smaller 
than a certain size, that were created by a specific program, and so forth. Turn on as many 
criteria as you'd like; each additional row further narrows the search.

G     Ends with. If you type then, you'll find "Lovable Heathen," but not files called "Then and Now" or "Authentic Cajun 
Recipes."
G     Is. This option finds only files named precisely what you type (except that capitalization still doesn't matter). Typing 
then won't find any of the file names in the previous examples. It would unearth only a file called simply "Then." (In 
fact, a file with a file name suffix, like "Then.doc," doesn't even qualify.)

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
If you listen closely, you can hear the cheers of propeller-heads worldwide over this 
development: Mac OS X 10.3 lets you perform "and" searches. That is, you can add Name 
rows to your Find setup more than once, for even more specific searches.
For example, if you create one Name row to look for apple, a second Name row to seek out 
corp, and a third Name row to hunt down memo, you'll round up only files whose names 
include all three of those terms ("Apple Corporate Memo.doc," "Memo to Apple Corps of 
Dallas").
2.10.2.2 Content
Sooner or later, it happens to everyone: a file's name doesn't match what's inside it. Maybe a marauding toddler pressed 
the keys while playing KidPix, inadvertently renaming your doctoral thesis "xggrjpO#$5%////." Maybe, in a Saturday 
afternoon organizing binge, your spouse helpfully changed the name of your "ATM Instructions" document to "Cash 
Machine Info," little realizing that it was a help file for Adobe Type Manager. Or maybe you just can't remember what you 
called something.
For this purpose, Find can search for words inside your files, regardless of their names (see Figure 2-16). It performs this 
kind of search with amazing speed, and has saved thousands of Mac fans hours of frustrated searching by hand; just type 
the word or phrase you seek into the "content includes" box.
If a Content search doesn't unearth a file you think it should have, consider the possibility 
that Mac OS X hasn't yet caught up indexing your files, as described in the box on the next 
page.
In the Relevance column, longer bars indicate more relevance; relevance is defined as "how 
many times the search term appears relative to the whole document's length." So a four-word 
file containing the search term "lizard" twice has higher relevance than one containing "lizard" 
three times in a 500- word essay. (Proximity also counts. If you search for Apple Corp, a 
document with "Apple Corporation" gets higher relevance than one containing, "She gave an 
apple to the Marine Corps.")

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
 
2.10.2.3 Date created, date modified
These options let you search for files according to when you first created them or when you last saved them.
Some of the fuzzy-logic commands on the pop-up menus are particularly useful. For example, setting up the pop-up menus 
so that they say, "is within" and "1 month" may be just what you need when you only vaguely remember when you last 
worked with the file.
You're allowed to add two Date rows—a great trick that lets you round up files that you 
created or edited between two dates. Set up the first Date row to say "is after," and the 
second one to say "is before," as illustrated in Figure 2-15.

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
The Indexing Catch
The "content" search, which finds words inside your files, is a terrific help when you can't remember what you 
named a certain file. Left unaided, the Mac would take almost as long as you would to search your files for a 
particular phrase.
To eliminate that delay, Apple programmed the Find program to do something ingenious: Like a kid cramming 
for an exam, it reads, takes notes on, and memorizes the contents of all of your files. Once it has indexed 
your hard drive in this way, Find can produce search results in seconds.
The indexing process occurs automatically and continuously—in the background —in the microseconds 
between your keystrokes and clicks in other programs. Most people can ignore the whole concept.
Every now and then, however, you may find it useful to know more about the indexing process. For example:
Manual indexing. If a search doesn't unearth a file you're pretty sure exists, maybe Mac OS X hasn't yet 
gotten around to indexing the disk or folder that contains it. In that situation, you can index it manually: Just 
highlight the disk or folder, choose File
Get Info, expand the Content Index panel, and then click Index 
Now (shown here). Once the Status line says "Indexed," try the search again.
Deleting an index. The index files (the card catalogs of your stuff) may be invisible, but they take up real disk 
space. If you're ever pinched for space, consider deleting the index files for folders you never search. (You 
may also want to delete the index files if certain folders full of irrelevant stuff keep coming up in your content 
searches.) To do so, highlight the disk or folder, choose File
Get Info, expand the Content Index panel, 
and then click Delete Index.
What the index includes. Mac OS X is smart enough to ignore files on your hard drive that don't actually 
contain words, such as applications, pictures, movies, system files, and so on. What it does index includes 
word processing files, text files, clipping files, HTML (Web page) documents, Acrobat (.pdf) files, and 
sometimes email, depending on the program you use.
Other disks. Mac OS X can't index CDs or other hard drives on the network.
Saving time and space. In an effort to be world-friendly and painfully complete, Apple wrote the Find 
program to index words in every possible language— Afrikaans, Norwegian, and so on. Unless you're some 
kind of freaky Harvard polyglot, this list is probably more inclusive than you actually need. By turning off the 
languages you don't speak, you can accelerate the indexing (and make the index files smaller).
To do so, in the Finder, choose Finder
Preferences. Click the Advanced button, and then click the Select 
button at the bottom of the dialog box. In the Languages dialog box, turn off the checkboxes of every 
language except the ones you use in your documents.
Where the index files are. In Mac OS X, there's no central, massive, invisible index file on the hard drive. 
Instead, every folder has its own invisible index file called .FBCIndex. The beauty of this system is that folders 
remain indexed even when copied to other disks—because the invisible index travels along with them.

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
 
2.10.2.4 Kind
These two pop-up menus let you search for everything that is, or isn't, a certain kind of file—an alias, folder, image, and so 
on. For example, when you're trying to free up some space on your drive, you could round up all your gigantic movie (.mov) 
files.
2.10.2.5 Label
Mac OS X Panther lets you not only tag certain icons with text-and-color labels, but—perhaps even more importantly—lets

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
you round them up later, for backing up, deleting, or burning to a CD en masse, for example.
Section 2.6 describes how to flag icons with labels. Now the other shoe drops: This is how you specify which label you want 
to use for finding them all, wherever they may be hiding.
2.10.2.6 Size
Using this control, and its "is less than"/ "is greater than" pop-up menu, you can restrict your search to files of a certain size. 
(Remember that there are 1,024 K per megabyte; this field requires a number in KB, or kilobytes.)
2.10.2.7 Extension
Here's the option you need when rounding up all files of a certain type, using their file name extensions as a "handle." You'd 
type .doc here to find all Word files, .jpg to find all JPEG graphics, and so on. (Fortunately, the Find program will find them 
even if the suffixes are hidden as described in Section 4.5.2.)
2.10.2.8 Visibility
Your hard drive is absolutely teeming with invisible files, including the thousands of Unix files that make up Mac OS X. 
Using this command, you can take a look at them. (It's not wise to move or throw away invisible files, however. In fact, 
Apple made them invisible expressly so you wouldn't tamper with them.)
UP TO SPEED
The Wacky Keystrokes of Panther
Mac OS X offers a glorious assortment of predefined keystrokes for jumping to the most important locations 
on your Mac: your Home folder, the Applications folder, the Utilities folder, the Computer window, your iDisk, 
the Network window, and so on.
Better yet, the keystrokes are incredibly simple to memorize: Just press Shift-
 and the first letter of the 
location you want. Shift-
-H opens your Home folder, Shift-
-A opens the Applications folder, and so on. 
You learn one, you've learned 'em all.
The point here is that Shift-
, in Panther, means places. 
The other system-wide key combo, Option-
, means functions. For example, Option-
-D hides or shows 
the Dock, Option-
-H is the Hide Others command, Option-
-+ magnifies the screen (if you've turned on 
this feature), Option- 
-Esc brings up the Force Quit dialog box, and so on. Consistency is always nice.
2.10.2.9 Type, Creator
Type and Creator codes are four-letter tags that help the Mac OS identify which program to use for opening which 
documents. See Section 4.5.1 for a full description of this soon-to-be-obsolete system. In the meantime, these options, new

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
to Mac OS X 10.3, can be useful indeed. They let you hunt down all files of a type (all text files, for example, even ones 
whose names don't end in .txt) or all files that "belong" to a certain program (Photoshop, for example).
The only catch is that you have to know their Type or Creator codes, which are ordinarily invisible. See Figure 4-8 for 
details.
2.10.3 Step 3: Find the Files, and Use Them
Once you've set up your search—a process that, in extreme cases, can take all afternoon —click the Search button, or 
press Return or Enter, to set the search in motion.
A new window, called Search Results, opens up immediately, although it may take some time for any files to appear in the 
list. If you let the search proceed, eventually you're shown a list of files whose names contain what you typed in the blank.
At this point, you should proceed exactly as described in Section 2.9.3; as it turns out, the Search bar and the Find program 
produce the same Search Results window. Doubleclick a found file to open it, drag it to the desktop to move it, and so on.
POWER USERS' CLINIC 
Secrets of the Non-Apple Mouse
Apple still includes a one-button mouse with every desktop Macintosh. But millions of people—not only 
Windows PC users—prefer a two-button mouse, preferably with a little scroll wheel on top.
Feel free to get one. They're cheap. Companies like Macally, Logitech, and Microsoft sell them specifically for 
the Macintosh, or you can try a generic mouse from some random PC-mouse company. Most of the time, PC 
mice work just fine on the Mac, even without having to install any software drivers. (And when a driver is 
necessary, you'll have good luck with a shareware driver like USB Overdrive, found at www.usboverdrive.com)
Most of the time, right-clicking something on the screen is the same as Control-clicking it—that is, it makes a 
contextual menu appear.
If your mouse has a little scroll wheel on the top, a world of shortcuts and conveniences awaits you. For 
example, you can pick menu items from an open menu just by spinning the scroll wheel to move up or down 
the commands.
In the Finder, pressing Option while you scroll accelerates the scrolling; that is, you can jump half a page at a 
time, instead of a few lines at a time.
If you press Shift as you twirl the wheel, many programs let you scroll the window horizontally instead of 
vertically. This surprising trick works in, for example, the Finder, Microsoft Excel, the Desktop panel of System 
Preferences, and the Open or Save dialog boxes for certain programs.

2.10 Finding Files 2: The Find Window
Actually, there's one thing you can do after using the Find program that you can't do using 
the Search bar: leave the Search Results window open. Then start a new search by pressing 
-F or choosing File
Find.
Adjust the search parameters and perform your second search. Now you've got two Search 
Results windows, each containing a different list of found files, which you're welcome to 
compare and study.
GEM IN THE ROUGH 
Stuffing, Zipping, and Archiving
For the first time in Mac history, Panther comes with a built-in command that compresses a file or folder down 
to a single, smaller icon—an archive— for storing or emailing.
It's just like using StuffIt in previous Mac OS versions, except for two big changes. First, Mac OS X 10.3 
creates .zip files, the same compression format used in Windows. That means that you can now send .zip 
files back and forth to PC owners without worrying that they won't be able to open them. (Non-Panther Mac 
owners can open .zip files, too. They just use the free StuffIt Expander as usual.)
Second, the software that does the compressing is built right in. Control-click a file or folder, and choose 
"Create Archive of [the icon's name]" from the contextual menu. (Of course, you can use the Action menu 
instead.)
Mac OS X thoughtfully creates a .zip archive, but leaves the original behind so you can continue working with 
it.
Opening a .zip file somebody sends you is equally easy: Just double-click it. Zip!—it opens.

Chapter 3. Dock, Desktop, and Toolbar
You can't help reacting, one way or another, to the futuristic, sleek, cool looks of Mac OS X the first time you arrive at its 
desktop. When you stop to think about it, the environment owes most of its distinctive, photo-realistic looks to only three key 
elements: the Dock at the bottom edge of the screen; the toolbar at the top of every Finder window; and the shimmering, 
sometimes animated backdrop of the desktop itself. This chapter shows you how to use and control these most dramatic 
elements of Mac OS X.

3.1 The Dock
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
3.1 The Dock
Most operating systems maintain two different lists of programs. One of them-like the Start menu (Windows) or the 
Launcher (Mac OS 9)-lists unopened programs until you need them. The other list-like the taskbar (Windows) or the 
Application menu (Mac OS 9)-keeps track of which programs are open at the moment, so that you can easily switch among 
them.
In Mac OS X, Apple combined both functions into a single strip of icons called the Dock.
Apple's thinking goes like this: Why must you know whether or not a program is already running? That's the computer's 
problem, not yours. In an ideal world, this distinction should be irrelevant. A program should appear when you click its icon, 
whether it's open or not-just as on a PalmPilot, for example.
"Which programs are open" already approaches unimportance in Mac OS X, where sophisticated memory-management 
features make it hard to run out of memory. You can open dozens of programs at once in Mac OS X.
And that's why the Dock combines the launcher and status functions of a modern operating system. Only a tiny triangle 
beneath a program's icon tells you that it's open.
In any case, the Dock is a core element of Mac OS X, and it's here to stay. Whether or not you agree with Apple's 
philosophy (and there's been plenty of controversy), Apple has made it as easy as possible to learn to like the Dock. You 
can customize the thing to within an inch of its life, or even get rid of it completely. This section explains everything you 
need to know.

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
3.2 Setting Up the Dock
Apple starts the Dock off with a few icons it thinks you'll enjoy: QuickTime Player, iTunes, iPhoto, iChat, Mail, the Safari 
Web browser, and so on. But using your Mac without putting your own favorite icons on the Dock is like buying an 
expensive suit and turning down the free alteration service. At the first opportunity, you should make the Dock your own.
The concept of the Dock is simple: Any icon you drag onto it (Figure 3-1) is installed there as a button. (You can even drag 
an open window onto the Dock-a Microsoft Word document you're editing, say-using its folder proxy icon [Section 1.2.4] as 
a handle.)
A single click, not a double-click, opens the corresponding icon. In other words, the Dock is an ideal parking lot for the icons 
of disks, folders, documents, programs, and Internet bookmarks that you access frequently.
You can install batches of icons onto the Dock all at once-just drag them as a group. That's 
something you can't do with the other parking places for favorite icons, like the Sidebar and 
the Finder toolbar.
To add an icon to the Dock, just drag it there. You haven't moved the original file; when you 
release the mouse, it remains exactly where it was. You've just installed a pointer-like a 
Macintosh alias or Windows shortcut, you might say.
 
Here are a few aspects of the Dock that may throw you at first:
G     It has two sides. See the fine dark line running down the Dock in Figure 3-1? That's the divider. Everything on the 
left side is an application-a program. Everything else goes on the right side: files, documents, folders, and disks.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-2.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:14 AM

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
It's important to understand this division. If you try to drag an application to the right of the line, for example, Mac 
OS X will teasingly refuse to accept it. (Even aliases observe that distinction. Aliases of applications can go only on 
the left side, for example.)
G     Its icon names are hidden. To see the name of a Dock icon, just point to it without clicking. You'll see the name 
appear just above the icon.
When you're trying to find a certain icon on the Dock, run your cursor slowly across the icons without clicking; the 
icon labels appear as you go. Better yet, you can usually tell documents apart by looking solely at their icons, as 
shown in the box in Section 3.2.1.
G     Folders and disks are hierarchical. If you retain nothing else in this chapter, remember this: If you click a folder 
or disk icon on the right side of the Dock and hold down the mouse button, a list of its contents sprouts from the 
icon. It's a hierarchical list, meaning that you can burrow into folders within folders this way. See (Figure 3-2) for an 
illustration.
If you'd rather not spend that half-second waiting for the pop-up menu to appear, just Control-
click the Dock icon, or right-click it (if you have a two-button mouse). The pop-up menu 
snaps up faster.
As long as you keep the mouse button pressed, you can burrow into folders within folders- 
either with the intention of opening a file or folder (by releasing the mouse button as you point), 
or just to see what's inside.
 
G     Programs appear there unsolicited. Nobody but you can put icons on the right side of the Dock. But program 
icons appear on the left side of the Dock automatically whenever you open a program (even one that's not listed in 
the Dock). Its icon remains there for as long as it's running.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-2.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:14 AM

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
The Dock is already extremely cool looking, but you haven't seen the end of its tricks. Using 
TinkerTool, you can make the Dock translucent (see-through) to a degree that you specify-a 
great way to show off at user-group meetings. See (Section 17.1) for details.
3.2.1 Organizing and Removing Dock Icons
You can move the tiles of the Dock around by dragging them horizontally. As you drag, the other icons scoot aside to make 
room. When you're satisfied with its new position, drop the icon you've just dragged.
If you don't want the other icons to scoot away-for example, if you're trying to drop a 
document into a folder on the Dock, rather than adding the document to the Dock-then 
-
drag it. In that case, the existing Dock icons freeze in place.
To remove a Dock icon, just drag it away. Once your cursor has cleared the Dock, release the mouse button. The icon 
disappears, its passing marked by a charming little puff of animated cartoon smoke. The other Dock icons slide together to 
close the gap. (Mac OS X won't let you remove the Finder, the Trash, the Dock icon of an open program, or any minimized 
document window.)
You can replace the "puff of smoke" animation with one of your own, as described in (Section 
17.2.)
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Living Icons
Mac OS X brings to life a terrific idea, a new concept in mainstream operating systems: icons that tell you 
something. As shown here, for example, you can often tell documents apart just by looking at their icons.
Furthermore, some program icons actually change over time. Activity Monitor (in your Utilities folder; see 
Section 9.25.1), for example, can be a living icon that actually graphs your Mac's stats, right there in the Dock. 
The Mail icon (see Chapter 19) displays a live counter that indicates how many new email messages are 
waiting for you. (After all, why should you switch into the Mail program if you'll only be disappointed?) The 
America Online icon sprouts a flag to let you know if an instant message is waiting. Toast illustrates the 
progress of a disc you're burning. And if you minimize a QuickTime movie while it's playing, it shrinks down 
and continues playing right there in the Dock.
Think of the possibilities. At this rate, one day the Safari icon could change to let you know when interesting 
new Web pages have appeared, the Quicken icon could display your current bank balance, and the Microsoft 
Word icon could change every time Microsoft posts a bug fix.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-2.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:14 AM

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
 
Weirdly enough, this technique (removing a Dock program's icon by dragging it away) works even while a program is still 
running. Granted, you won't see any change immediately, because the program is still open. But when you ultimately quit 
the program, you'll see that its previously installed icon is no longer in the Dock.
3.2.2 Three Ways to Get the Dock out of Your Hair
The bottom of the screen isn't necessarily the ideal location for the Dock. Because most screens are wider than they are 
tall, the Dock eats into your limited vertical screen space. In these situations, you have three ways out: Hide the Dock, 
shrink it, or rotate it 90 degrees.
3.2.2.1 Auto-hiding the Dock
To turn on the Dock's auto-hiding feature, choose 
Dock 
Turn Hiding On (or press Option-
-D).
You also find this on/off switch when you choose 
Dock
 Dock Preferences 
(Figure 3-4), or when you click the System Preferences icon on the Dock, and then the Dock 
icon. (Chapter 8 contains much more about the System Preferences program.)
When the Dock is hidden, it doesn't slide into view until you move the cursor to the Dock's edge of the screen. When you 
move the cursor back to the middle of the screen, the Dock slithers out of view once again. (Individual Dock icons may 
occasionally shoot upward into Desktop territory when a program needs your attention-cute, very cute-but otherwise, the 
Dock lies low until you call for it.)
On paper, an auto-hiding Dock is ideal-it's there only when you summon it. In practice, however, you may find that the extra 
half-second the Dock takes to appear and disappear makes this feature slightly less appealing.
For many Mac fans, then, the solution is to hide and show the Dock at will by pressing the hide/show keystroke, Option-
-
D. This method makes the Dock pop on and off the screen without requiring you to move the cursor.
3.2.2.2 Shrinking and enlarging the Dock
Depending on your screen's size, you may prefer smaller or larger Dock buttons. The official way to resize them goes like 
this: Choose 
Dock
Dock Preferences. In the resulting dialog box, drag the Dock Size slider, as shown in 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-2.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:14 AM

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
Figure 3-4.
There's a much faster way to resize the Dock, however: Just position your cursor carefully on the Dock's divider line, so that 
it turns into a double-headed arrow (shown in Figure 3-3). Now drag up or down to shrink or enlarge the Dock.
If you press Option as you drag, the Dock snaps to certain canned icon sizes-those that the 
programmer actually drew. (You won't see the in-between sizes that Mac OS X generally 
calculates on the fly.)
As noted in Figure 3-3, you may not be able to enlarge the Dock, especially if it contains a lot of icons. But you can make it 
almost infinitely smaller. Which makes you wonder: How can you distinguish between icons if they're the size of molecules?
The answer lies in the 
 Dock
Turn Magnification On command. What you've just done is trigger the swelling 
effect shown in Figure 3-4. Now your Dock icons balloon to a much larger size as your cursor passes over them. It's a 
weird, rippling, magnetic sort of animated effect that takes some getting used to. But it's yet another spectacular 
demonstration of the graphics technology in Mac OS X, and it can actually come in handy when you find your icons 
otherwise shrinking away to nothing.
Look closely-you can see the secret cursor that resizes the Dock. If you don't see any change 
in the Dock size as you drag upward, you've reached the size limit. The Dock's edges are 
already approaching your screen sides.
 
To find a comfortable setting for the Magnification slider, choose 
Dock
 Dock 
Preferences. Leave the Dock Preferences window open on the screen, as shown here. After 
each adjustment of the Dock Size slider, try out the Dock (which still works when the Dock 
Preferences window is open) to test your new settings.

3.2 Setting Up the Dock
 
3.2.2.3 Moving the Dock to the sides of the screen
Yet another approach to getting the Dock out of your way is to rotate it, so that it sits vertically against a side of your screen. 
You can rotate it in either of two ways:
G     The menu way. From the 
 Dock submenu, choose "Position on Left," "Position on Right," or "Position on 
Bottom," as you see fit.
G     The mouse way. While pressing Shift, drag the Dock's divider line, like a handle, directly to the side of the screen 
you want.
You'll probably find that the right side of your screen works better than the left. Most Mac OS X programs put their 
document windows against the left edge of the screen, where the Dock and its labels might get in the way.
NOTE
When you position your Dock vertically, the "right" side of the Dock becomes the bottom. In other words, the 
Trash now appears at the bottom of the vertical Dock. So as you read references to the Dock in this book, 
mentally substitute the phrase "bottom part of the Dock" when you read references to the "right side of the 
Dock."

3.3 Using the Dock

3.3 Using the Dock
Most of the time, you'll use the Dock as either a launcher (you click an icon once to open the corresponding program, file, 
folder, or disk) or as a status indicator (the tiny black triangles, identified in Figure 3-1, indicate which programs are running).
But the Dock has more tricks than that up its sleeve. You can use it, for example, to pull off any of the following stunts.
3.3.1 Switch Applications
The Dock isn't just a launcher; it's also a switcher. For example, it lets you:
G     Jump among your open programs by clicking their icons.
G     Jump among your open programs by pressing 
-Tab. (Details in Section 4.2.)
G     Drag a document (such as a text file) onto a Dock application button (such as the Microsoft Word icon) to open the 
former with the latter. (If the program balks at opening the document, yet you're sure the program should be able to 
open the document, add the 
 and Option keys as you drag.)
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Recovering from a MicroDock
What is a MicroDock? It's what you get when you try to store 355 JPEG files by dragging them onto a folder in 
the Dock, but you just miss the folder (thanks to its tendency to scoot aside). As a result, you drop all of the 
graphics directly into the Dock. They dutifully appear as shown here, all in an endless row, at the size of 
subatomic particles.
Now you have a problem. How do you get the Dock back to normal? If you dragged the icons off the Dock 
one at a time,you'd spend two presidential administrations doing it.
The easiest way to return to a normal Dock is to delete the Dock preferences file from your 
Home
Library
Preferences folder. The file is named com.apple. Dock.plist, and you can just drag it 
into the Trash. (If you're really obsessive about your Dock setup, you can create a backup of this file now, 
while everything is working properly. In the event of a MicroDock, you can just replace the messed-up 
preferences file with the backup.)
 
G     Hide all windows of the program you're in by Option-clicking another Dock icon.
This is just a quick summary of the Dock's application-management functions; you'll find the full details in Chapter 4.

3.3 Using the Dock
3.3.2 Operate the Dock by Keyboard Control
If you turn on full keyboard access, you can operate the Dock entirely from the keyboard; see Section 4.6.
3.3.3 Secret Menus
Don't get so enamored of single-clicking the Dock icons that you miss this one. It turns out that if you Control-click a Dock 
icon-or, if you're in no hurry, hold down the mouse button on it-a hidden menu sprouts out of it (Figure 3-5).
If you've clicked a minimized window icon, this shortcut menu says only the name of the window. If you've clicked the icon 
of an application that's not running at the moment (or an alias), the menu says only Show In Finder.
Top: Control-click a Dock icon, or click and hold on it, to open the secret menu. The names at 
the top of this shortcut menu are the names of the windows currently open in that program. The 
checkmark next to a window's name indicates that it's the frontmost window of that program 
(even if that program is in the background).
Bottom: Here's a bonus secret. If you Control-click the divider bar that separates the two sides 
of the Dock, another hidden menu appears, this time listing a bunch of useful Dock commands, 
including the ones listed in the 
Dock submenu.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-3.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:17 AM

3.3 Using the Dock
 
But if you've clicked the icon of a running application, you get some very useful hidden commands. For example:
G     [Window names.] At the top of the shortcut menu, you'll often find at least one tiny, neatly labeled window icon, 
like those shown in Figure 3-5. This useful Mac OS X feature means that you can jump directly not just to a certain 
program, but to a certain open window in that program.
For example, suppose you've been using Word to edit three different chapters. You can use Word's Dock icon as a 
Window menu to pull forward one particular chapter, or (if it's been minimized) to pull it up-even from within a 
different program.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-3.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:17 AM

3.3 Using the Dock
The Finder tile that's always at the beginning of the Dock is, in effect, its own Window menu. 
By holding the mouse down on this icon for a moment, you produce a menu that lists all open 
desktop windows.
Of course, the Window menu at the top of the Finder screen does the same thing. But the 
Dock is available no matter what program you're using.
G     Keep In Dock. Whenever you launch a program, Mac OS X puts its icon in the Dock-marked with a little black 
triangle-even if you don't normally keep its icon there. As soon as you quit the program, its icon disappears again 
from the Dock.
If you understand that much, then the Keep In Dock command makes a lot of sense. It means, "Hello, I'm this 
program's icon. I know you don't normally keep me in your Dock, but I'd be happy to stay here even after you quit 
my program. Just say the word." If you find that you've been using, for example, Terminal (Chapter 15) a lot more 
often than you thought you would, this command may be just the ticket.
Actually, there's a faster way to tell a running application to remain on the Dock from now on: 
Just drag its icon off the Dock and then right back onto it-yes, while the program is running. 
You have to try it to believe it.
G     Show In Finder. Choose this command to highlight the actual icon (in whatever folder window it happens to sit) of 
the application, alias, folder, or document you've clicked. You might want to do this when, for example, you're using 
a program that you can't quite figure out, and you want to jump to its desktop folder in hopes of finding a Read Me 
file there.
If you really want to reveal an icon in the Finder, there's a much faster way: 
-click its Dock 
icon. (You can even 
-click a document window that's listed in one of the Dock's pop-up 
menus, illustrated in Figure 3-5, to highlight its corresponding icon.)
G     Hide. Apple's theme for Mac OS X 10.3 seems to have been, "Cut the clutter," because this operating system is 
crawling with ways to hide or reveal selected batches of windows. Here's a case in point: You can hide all traces of 
the program you're using by choosing Hide from its Dock icon. (You could accomplish the same thing in many 
other ways, of course; see Section 4.4)
What's kind of cool here is that (a) you can even hide the Finder and all its windows, and (b) if you press Option, 
the command changes to say Hide Others. This, in its way, is a much more powerful command. It tells all of the 
programs you're not using-the ones in the background-to get out of your face. They hide themselves instantly.
G     Quit. You can quit any program directly from its Dock menu. (Troubleshoot moment: If you get nothing but a beep 
when you use this Quit command, it's because you've hidden the windows of that program, and one of them has 
unsaved changes. Click the program's icon, save your document, and then try to quit again.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-3.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:17 AM

3.3 Using the Dock
You might be thankful for this quick-quitting feature when your boss is coming down the hallway and the Dilbert 
Web site is on your screen where a spreadsheet is supposed to be.
If you hold down the Option key-even after you've opened the pop-up menu-the Quit 
command changes to say Force Quit. That's your emergency hatch for jettisoning a locked-
up program.
G     Conduct speed tests. When you click an application on the Dock, its icon jumps up and down a few times as the 
program launches, as though with excitement at having been selected. The longer a program takes to start up, the 
more bounces you see. This has given birth to a hilarious phenomenon: the counting of these bounces as a casual 
speed benchmark for application-launching times. "Internet Explorer took twelve bouncemarks to open in Mac OS 
X 10.2," you might read online, "but only three bouncemarks in 10.3."
If you find the icon bouncing a bit over the top, try this: Choose 
Dock
Dock 
Preferences. In the Dock dialog box (shown in Figure 3-4), turn off "Animate opening 
applications." From now on, your icons won't actually bounce-instead, the little triangle 
underneath it will simply pulse as the application opens.
G     Do your filing. Once you've tried stashing a few important folders on the right side of your Dock, there's no going 
back. You can mostly forget all the other navigation tricks you've learned in Mac OS X. After all, the folders you 
care about are always there, ready for opening with a single click.
Better yet, they're easily accessible for putting away files; you can drag them directly into the Dock's folder icons as 
though they're regular folders. In fact, if you press 
 just before releasing the mouse, docked folder icons don't 
scoot out of the way, as they usually do to accommodate something you're adding to the Dock.
3.3.4 Great Things to Put on Your Dock
Now that you know what the Dock's about, it's time to set up shop. Install the programs, folders, and disks you'll be using 
most often.
They can be whatever you want, of course, but don't miss these opportunities:
G     Your Home folder. Many Mac fans immediately drag their hard drive icons onto the right side of the Dock-or, 
perhaps more practically, their Home folders (see Section 2.1). Now they have quick access to every single file in 
every single folder they'll ever use.
G     The Applications folder. Here's a no-brainer: Stash the Applications folder here, so you'll have quick pop-up 
menu access to any program on your machine.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-3.html (5 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:17 AM

3.3 Using the Dock
If you click and hold on the Applications folder's icon, a list of its contents pops up. That 
much you already knew.
But remember that in Panther, you can highlight a command in an open menu just by typing 
the first couple letters of its name-and that goes for Dock pop-up menus, too. In other words, 
once you've popped open your Applications menu, you can open any program inside it just 
by typing sa for Safari (for example), without having to scroll through a hundred programs 
with the mouse.
G     Your Applications folder. As an even more efficient corollary, create a new folder of your own. Fill it with the 
aliases of just the programs you use most often and park it on the Dock. Now you've got an even more useful 
Applications folder.
G     The Documents folder. The Documents folder in your Home folder is another primary center for your Mac activity. 
Stash it here for quick access.
G     The Shared folder. If you're using the Mac's accounts feature (Chapter 11), this is your wormhole between all 
accounts-the one place you can put files where everybody can access them (Section 11.5.2).
Ordinarily, dragging an icon off the Dock takes it off the Dock.
But if you press 
 as you drag, you drag the actual item represented by the Dock icon, 
from wherever it happens to be on the hard drive! This new Panther trick is great when, for 
example, you want to email a document whose icon is on the Dock; just 
-drag it into your 
outgoing message. (Option-
-drag, meanwhile, creates an alias of the Dock item.)

3.4 The Finder Toolbar
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
3.4 The Finder Toolbar
At the top of every Finder window is a small set of function icons, all in a brushedaluminum row (Figure 3-6). If you're used 
to Mac OS X 10.2, a glance at this new, emaciated toolbar may make you wonder if Apple put it on some kind of crazy no-
carb diet. Gone are the icons for Home, Computer, Applications, and other folders that used to appear here-because these 
now appear in the Sidebar (Section 1.2.1).
Instead, the first time you run Mac OS X 10.3, you'll find only these icons on the toolbar:
G     Back, Forward. As you've probably noticed, the Mac OS X Finder works something like a Web browser. Only a 
single window remains open as you navigate the various folders on your hard drive.
The Back button returns you to whichever folder you were just looking at. (Instead of clicking Back, you can also 
press 
-[, or choose Go
Back-particularly handy if the toolbar is hidden, as described below.)
The Forward button springs to life only after you've used the Back button. Clicking it (or pressing 
-]) returns you 
to the window you just backed out of.
G     View controls. The three tiny buttons next to the Forward button switch the current window into icon, list, or 
column view, respectively (Section 1.3). And remember, if the toolbar is hidden, you can get by with the equivalent 
commands in the View menu at the top of the screen-or by pressing 
-1, 
-2, or 
-3 (for Icon, List, and 
Columns view, respectively).
G     Action. You can read all about this context-sensitive pop-up menu, new in Panther, in Section 2.3.1.
G     Search bar. This is your Find command. As described in detail in Section 2.9, it lets you pinpoint a certain icon 
within the open window, or anywhere on your system.
If you 
-click the upper-right toolbar button repeatedly, you cycle through six combinations of 
large and small icons and text labels (three examples are shown here).
Tip: This same 
-clicking business cycles through the same toolbar variations in Mail, System 
Preferences, and many other programs that have toolbars.

3.4 The Finder Toolbar
3.4.1 Removing or Shrinking the Toolbar
Between the toolbar, the Dock, the Sidebar, and the unusually large icons of Mac OS X, it almost seems like there's an 
Apple conspiracy to sell big screens.
Fortunately, the toolbar doesn't have to contribute to that impression. You can hide it with one click-on the white, oval "Old 
Finder Mode" button (see Section 1.2.7). You can also hide the toolbar by choosing View
Hide Toolbar or pressing 
Option-
-T. (The same keystroke, or choosing View
Show Toolbar, brings it back.)
Why did Apple change the Hide Toolbar keystroke after millions of Mac fans just got finished 
memorizing 
-B in Mac OS X 10.2?
Answer: Because Panther is more consistent. Remember that the Option-
combo is the 
universal pair for system-wide on/off switches, like Option-
-D for hiding the Dock, 
Option-
-H for Hide Others, Option-
-Esc for Force Quit, and so on.
But you don't have to do without the toolbar altogether. If its consumption of screen space is your main concern, you may 
prefer to simply collapse it-to delete the pictures but preserve the text buttons.
The trick is to 
-click the Old Finder Mode button. With each click, you make the toolbar take up less vertical space, 
cycling through six variations of shrinking icons, shrinking text labels, and finally labels without any icons at all (see Figure 3-
6).
There's a long way to adjust the icon and label sizes, too: Choose View
Customize Toolbar (or Option-
 click the Old 
Finder Mode button). As shown in Figure 3-7, the dialog box that appears offers a Show pop-up menu at the bottom. It lets 
you choose picture-buttons, with Icon Only, or, for the greatest space conservation, Text Only. You can see the results 
without even closing the dialog box.
Click Done or press Enter to make your changes stick.
NOTE
In Text Only mode, the three View buttons become a little pop-up menu. Furthermore, the Search bar 
(Section 2.9) turns into a one-word button called Search. Clicking it brings up the Find dialog box (Section 
2.10), which is actually much more powerful than the Search bar itself.
While this window is open, you can add icons to the toolbar by dragging them into place from 
the gallery before you. You can also remove icons from the toolbar by dragging them up or 
down off the toolbar. Rearrange the icons by dragging them horizontally.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-4.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:20 AM

3.4 The Finder Toolbar
 
3.4.2 Adding Your Own Icons to the Toolbar
Mac OS X not only offers a collection of beautifully designed icons for alternate (or additional) toolbar buttons, but makes it 
easy for you to add anything to the toolbar,turning it into a supplementary Dock or Sidebar. This is great news for people 
who miss having their Home and Applications folder icons at the top of the window, as it was in Mac OS X versions past, or 
for anyone who has run out of space for stashing favorite icons on the Dock or the Sidebar. (Of course, if that's your 
problem, you need a bigger monitor.)
3.4.2.1 Apple's toolbar-icon collection
To see the optional toolbar icons that Apple has prepared for you, choose View
 Customize Toolbar. The window 
shown in Figure 3-7 appears.
There's a great secret shortcut for opening the Customize Toolbar window: Option-
-click 
the toolbar button (the white capsule in the upper-right corner of every Finder window). The 
keys to hold down may have changed from Mac OS X 10.2, but the result is equally 
satisfying.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-4.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:20 AM

3.4 The Finder Toolbar
This is your chance to rearrange the existing toolbar icons or delete the ones you don't use. You can also add any of 
Apple's buttons to the toolbar simply by dragging them from the "gallery" upward onto the toolbar itself. The existing icons 
scoot out of your cursor's way, if necessary.
Most of the options listed in the gallery duplicate the functions of menu commands. Here are a few of the options that don't 
appear on the standard toolbar:
G     Path. Most of the gallery elements are buttons, but this one creates a pop-up menu on the toolbar. When clicked, it 
reveals (and lets you navigate) the hierarchy-the path-of folders that you open to reach whichever window is open. 
(Equivalent: 
-clicking a window's title, as described in Section 1.2.2.)
G     Eject. This button ejects whichever disk or disk image is currently highlighted. (Equivalent: The File
Eject 
command, or holding down the Eject key on your keyboard.)
G     Burn. This button burns a blank CD or DVD with the folders and files you've dragged onto it. (Equivalent: The 
File
Burn Disc command.)
G     Customize. This option opens this toolbar-customizing window. (Equivalent: The View
Customize Toolbar 
command.)
G     Separator. This gallery icon doesn't actually do anything when clicked. It's designed to set apart groups of toolbar 
icons. (For example, you might want to segregate your folder buttons, such as Documents and Applications, from 
your function buttons, such as Delete and Connect.) Drag this dotted line between two existing icons on the toolbar.
G     Space. By dragging this mysterious-looking item-new in Panther-into the toolbar, you add a gap between it and 
whatever icon is to its left. It's about as wide as one icon. (The fine, dark, rectangular outline that appears when 
you drag it won't actually show up once you click Done.)
G     Flexible Space. This icon, too, creates a gap between the toolbar buttons. The difference is that this time, the gap 
will expand as you make the window wider. Now you know how Apple got the Search bar, for example, to appear 
off to the right of the standard toolbar, a long way from its clustered comrades to the left.
G     New Folder. Clicking this button creates a new folder in whichever window you're viewing. (Equivalent: the 
File
New Folder command, or the Shift-
-N keystroke. Millions of Mac fans, however, spend their first weeks 
with Mac OS X hitting the old keystroke, 
-N, when they want a new folder, little realizing that 
-N now triggers 
the New Finder Window command. Adding the New Folder command to the toolbar is a quick solution.)
G     Delete. This option puts the highlighted file or folder icons into the Trash. (Equivalent: the File
Move to Trash 
command, or the 
-Delete keystroke.)
The New Folder and Delete icons are among the most valuable ones to put on your toolbar. 
They represent functions you'll probably use often.
G     Connect. If you're on a home or office network, this opens the Connect to Server dialog box (see Section 12.2.2) 
so that you can tap into another computer. (Equivalent: The Go
Connect to Server command, or the 
-K 
keystroke.) 
G     Find. This option opens the Find dialog box (Chapter 2), which you can use to search your hard drive for files or 
folders.
G     Get Info. This button opens the Get Info window (Section 2.8) for the icon you've highlighted. 
G     iDisk. The iDisk is your own personal 100 MB virtual hard drive on the Internet. It's your private backup disk, 
stashed at Apple, safe from whatever fire, flood, or locusts may destroy your office. Of course, you already know 
this, because you're paying $100 per year for the privilege (see Section 18.9.2).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-4.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:20 AM

3.4 The Finder Toolbar
In any case, you can connect to the Internet and bring your iDisk's icon onto the screen just by clicking this toolbar 
icon.
G     Search. This item represents the Search bar described in Section 2.9.
G     Default set. If you've made a mess of your toolbar, you can always reinstate its original, factory-installed 
arrangement just by dragging this rectangular strip directly upward onto your toolbar.
NOTE
If a window is too narrow to show all the icons on the toolbar, you will see, at the right end of the toolbar, a 
>> symbol. Click it for a pop-up menu that names whichever icons don't fit at the moment. (You'll find this 
toolbar behavior in many Mac OS X programs-System Preferences, Mail, Address Book, and so on-not just 
the Finder.)
3.4.2.2 Adding your own stuff
Millions of Panther fans will probably trudge forward through life, using the toolbar to hold the suggested Apple function 
buttons, and the Sidebar to hold the icons of favorite folders, files, and programs. They may never realize that you can drag 
any icons at all onto the toolbar-files, folders, disks, programs, or whatever-to turn them into one-click buttons, just as in 
Mac OS X 10.2.
In short, you can think of the Finder toolbar as yet another Dock or Sidebar (Figure 3-8).
You don't need to choose View
Customize Toolbar to add your own icons to the toolbar. 
Just drag them from the desktop or any folder window directly onto the toolbar, at any time. 
Pause with your cursor on the toolbar for a moment before releasing the icon.)
 
3.4.3 Rearranging or Removing Toolbar Icons
You can drag toolbar icons around, rearranging them horizontally, by pressing 
 as you drag. Taking an icon off the 
toolbar is equally easy: While pressing the 
 key, just drag the icon clear away from the toolbar. It vanishes in a puff of 
cartoon smoke.

3.5 Designing Your Desktop

3.5 Designing Your Desktop
In some ways, just buying a Macintosh was a renegade act of self-expression. But that's only the beginning. Now it's time to 
fashion the computer screen itself according to your personal sense of design and fashion.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Desktop Fonts
How do I change the fonts used by the Mac OS X Finder? 
In Mac OS versions gone by, you could choose any font you liked for your icon labels. You even had a choice 
of several fonts for use in your menus.
In Mac OS X 10.3, that flexibility is gone. You get Lucida Grande in your menus and as icon labels, love it or 
leave it. In the View Options window, you can change the type size-just not the font.
For now, Apple intends to remain conservative with the look of Mac OS X-both for "branding" reasons (to 
make Mac OS X instantly recognizable) and for technical ones (to make sure that it doesn't open a Pandora's 
box of interface hacks that wind up destabilizing the machine).
3.5.1 System Preferences
Cosmetically speaking, Mac OS X offers two dramatic full-screen features: desktop backgrounds and screen savers. (That's 
not counting the pictures and colors you can apply to individual folder windows, as described in Section 1.4.1.6.)
The command center for both of these functions is the System Preferences program (which longtime Mac and Windows 
fans may recognize as the former Control Panels). Open it by clicking the System Preferences icon on the Dock, or by 
choosing its name from the

Screen Saver button. For further details on these System Preferences modules, see Chapter 8.
3.5.2 Graphic Designers' Corner: The Gray Look
One of the earliest objections to the lively, brightly colored look of Mac OS X came from Apple's core constituency: artists 
and graphic designers. Some complained that Mac OS X's bright blues (of scroll bar handles, progress bars, the 
 menu, 
pulsing OK buttons, highlighted menu names and commands), along with the red, green, and yellow window-corner 
buttons, threw off their color judgment.
Truth is, these features have been greatly toned down since the original version of Mac OS X. The pulsing effects are 
subtler, the three-dimensional effects are less drastic, and the button colors are less intense.

3.5 Designing Your Desktop
But just in case they still bother artists, Apple created what it calls the Graphite look for Mac OS X, which turns all of those 
interface elements gray instead of blue. To try out this look, click the System Preferences icon on the Dock (or choose 
System Preferences from the 
 menu); click Show All; click Appearance; and then choose Graphite from the Appearance 
pop-up menu.
The Highlight Color pop-up menu lets you choose a different accent color for your little Mac 
world. For example, this is the background color of highlighted text, the colored oval that 
appears around highlighted icon names, and window "lining" as you drag an icon into it.
3.5.3 Desktop Sounds
Desktop sounds are the tiny sound effects that accompany certain mouse drags. And we're talking tiny-they're so subdued 
and sparse, you might not even have noticed them. But you'll hear a little plink/crunch when you drop an icon onto the 
Trash, and a little whoof! when you drag something off the Dock and into oblivion.v
If all that racket is keeping you awake, however, it's easy enough to turn them off. Open System Preferences, click the 
Sound icon, and turn off "Play user interface sound effects."
And if you decide to leave them turned on, please-use discretion when working in a library, neurosurgical operating room, 
or church.

3.6 Menulets: The Missing Manual
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
3.6 Menulets: The Missing Manual
See the little menu-bar icons in Figure 3-9? Apple calls them Menu Extras, but Mac fans on the Internet have named 
menulets. Each is both an indicator and a menu that provides direct access to certain settings in System Preferences. One 
lets you adjust your Mac's speaker volume; another lets you change the screen resolution; another shows you the 
remaining power in your laptop battery; and so on.
These little guys are the direct descendants of the controls once found on the Mac OS 9 
Control Strip or the Windows system tray. Menulets from left: Eject, VPN, Text Input, Remote 
Desktop, PPP, Ink, iChat, Classic, Bluetooth, AirPort, Volume, Battery, and Date & Time.
 
To summon the various menulets, you generally visit a certain pane of System Preferences (Chapter 8) and turn on a 
checkbox called, for example, "Show volume in menu bar." Here's a rundown of the various Apple menulets that you may 
encounter, complete instructions on where to find this magic on/off checkbox for each:.
G     AirPort status lets you turn your AirPort card on or off, join existing AirPort wireless networks, and create your own 
private ones. To find the "Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
Network. From the Show pop-up menu, 
choose AirPort. (It's available only if you've installed Apple's AirPort software.)
G     Apple Remote Desktop is a program, sold separately, that lets teachers or system administrators tap into your 
Mac from across the network. In fact, they can actually see what's on your screen, move the cursor around, and so 
on. The menulet lets you turn remote control on and off, send a message to the administrator, and so on. To find 
the "Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
Sharing, and click Apple Remote Desktop. 
G     Battery status shows how much power remains in your laptop's battery (laptops only). To find the "Show" 
checkbox:: Open System Preferences
Energy Saver. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-3-SECT-6.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:49:25 AM

3.6 Menulets: The Missing Manual
G     Bluetooth status (for connecting to Bluetooth devices, "pairing" your Mac with a cellphone, and so on). To find the 
"Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
Network. From the Show pop-up menu, choose Bluetooth. (It's 
available only if you've installed Apple's Bluetooth software.) Finally, click the Bluetooth Modem tab button. The 
"Show Bluetooth status in menu bar" checkbox appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
G     Classic. Using this menulet, you can start or stop Classic (which is Mac OS X's "Mac OS 9 simulator," as 
described in Chapter 5), open the Classic pane of System Preferences, or-this is weird-view the contents of the 
Mac OS 9 
 menu. To find the "Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
Classic. Look near the middle 
of the Start/Stop pane.
G     Dial-up modem (PPP) status lets you connect or disconnect from the Internet. To find the "Show" checkbox: 
Open System Preferences
Network. From the Show pop-up menu, choose Internal Modem. Click the Modem 
tab button. 
G     Displays adjusts screen resolution. To find the "Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
Displays.
G     Eject disc. This one's the oddball: There's no checkbox in System Preferences to make it appear. The fact that it 
even exists is something of a secret.
To make it appear, open your System
Library
CoreServices
Menu Extras folder, and double-click the 
Eject.menu icon. That's it! The Eject menulet appears.
You'll discover that its wording changes: "Open Combo Drive," "Close DVD-RAM Drive," "Eject [Name of Disc]," or 
whatever, to reflect your particular drive type and what's in it at the moment.
G     iChat. Here's a quick way to let the world know, via iChat and the Internet (Chapter 21), that you're away from your 
keyboard, or available and ready to chat. Via the Buddy List command, it's also a quick way to open iChat itself. To 
find the "Show" checkbox: Open iChat (it's in your Applications folder). Choose iChat
Preferences, click the 
General button, and turn on "Show status in menu bar."
G     Ink. If you have a graphics tablet, you can use this menulet to turn Write Anywhere on and off. (That may not mean 
much to you until you've read about the Ink feature, beginning in Section 14.6.) To find the "Show" checkbox: Open 
the Ink panel of System Preferences.
G     Menu-bar clock tells the time, in analog or digital form (choose your preference from the menulet itself). To find 
the "Show" checkbox: Open System Preferences
 Date & Time
Clock tab button.
G     PC Card. You can use this little item to eject a PC card that you've inserted into the slot in your PowerBook, if it 
has such a slot. To make it appear, open your System
 Library
CoreServices
Menu Extras folder, and 
double-click the PCCard.menu folder.
G     PPPoE status (PPP over Ethernet) lets you control certain kinds of DSL connection. To find the "Show" checkbox: 
Open System Preferences
Network From the Show pop-up menu, choose Built-in Ethernet. Click the PPoE 
tab button. 
G     Script menu lists a variety of useful, ready-to-run AppleScript programs (see Section 7.1). To make it appear, 
open your Applications
AppleScript folder and doubleclick Install Script Menu.
G     Speaker volume, of course, adjusts your Mac's speaker or headphones volume. To find the "Show" checkbox: 
Open System Preferences
Sound.
G     Text Input makes it easy for you to switch among different text input modes. You're probably most familiar with the 
normal keyboard. But what if your language, like Japanese Kanji, has hundreds of symbols in it? How will a 26-
letter keyboard help you then? You'll need a floating palette of all of these symbols, and this menulet summons and 
dismisses such palettes. Details in Section 8.14.1. To find the "Show" checkbox: Open System 
Preferences
International. Click the Input Menu tab button.
G     User identifies the account holder (Chapter 12) who's logged in at the moment. To make this menulet appear (in 
bold, at the far right end of the menu bar), turn on fast user switching, which is described in Section 11.7.
G     VPN stands for virtual private networking, which is a system of letting you tap into a corporation's network so you 
can, for example, check your email from home. You can use the menulet to connect and disconnect, for example. 
To find the "Show" checkbox: Open the program called Internet Connect (it's in your Applications folder). Click the 
VPN button.

3.6 Menulets: The Missing Manual
To remove a menulet, just 
 -drag it off your menu bar (or turn off the corresponding checkbox in System Preferences). 
You can also rearrange them by 
 -dragging them horizontally.
These little guys are useful, good-looking, and respectful of your screen space. The world could use more inventions like 
menulets.

Chapter 4. Programs and Documents
From the day Apple first announced Mac OS X, the company made clear that Mac OS X offered a lot of advantages, 
particularly in stability—but that you would need all-new versions of your programs to realize these benefits. Most software 
companies announced that they would get to work Mac OS X-izing their programs, but Mac fans still kept reading the same 
advice: Don't switch to Mac OS X until most or all of the programs you use every day have been adapted to run on it.
For most people, that time is here. One by one, the Mac OS X versions of big-name programs became ready: 
QuarkXPress, AppleWorks, iMovie, iTunes, Illustrator, Freehand, Quicken, FileMaker, Internet Explorer, America Online, 
and thousands of others. In fact, many of the latest Mac versions run only in Mac OS X (Microsoft Office, InDesign 3, iMovie 
3, Photoshop CS, and so on).
The time has also come, therefore, to grow accustomed to the way programs and documents relate in Mac OS X.
NOTE
There are two chief kinds of Mac OS X-compatible programs, known by the geeks as Carbon and Cocoa 
programs (see Section 4.8). This chapter describes how Carbon and Cocoa programs work.
You can also run older, Mac OS 9-compatible programs that haven't yet been updated for Mac OS X—but 
when you launch one of these, your Mac automatically opens a Mac OS 9 simulator called Classic. For 
details on running the older, Mac OS 9-specific programs in this way, see Chapter 5.

4.1 Launching Mac OS X Programs
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.1 Launching Mac OS X Programs
You can launch (open) a program in any of several ways.
G     Double-click an application's icon in the Finder.
G     Click a program's icon on the Dock, Sidebar, or the Finder toolbar.
G     If you've added the Applications folder to your Dock (and you should!), hold the mouse button down on it until the 
list of its contents springs open. Then click the program you want (or even type the first couple letters of its name 
and then press Return).
G     Highlight an application icon and then press 
-O (short for File
Open) or 
-down arrow.
G     Use the submenus of the 
 menu's Recent Items
Applications command. (You control how many programs 
this feature tracks using the System Preferences panel described in Section 8.4.3.)
NOTE
Mac OS X stores a list of your recently used programs in a text file called com.apple.recentitems.plist,located 
in your Home folder
Library
Preferences folder. And with about $1.00, that information will buy you 
a cup of coffee in most restaurants.
G     Open a document icon in any of these ways, or drag a document onto the icon of a program that can open it 
(whether in the Dock, the Finder toolbar, the Sidebar, or in a folder window).
If you press Option as you open an application (or anything else) in the Finder, you 
automatically close the window that contains its icon. Later, when you return to the Finder, 
you'll find a neat, clean desktop—no loitering windows.
When you launch a program, the Mac reads its computer code, which lies on your hard drive's surface, and feeds it quickly 
into RAM (memory). During this brief interval, the icon of the opening program jumps up and down eagerly in your Dock. 
(You can turn off this bouncing in Finder
Preferences.)
Want to see multithreading in action? Launch a program that takes a long time to open—that 
is, whose icon on the Dock does a lot of bouncing.
You don't have to wait for the application to finish bouncing—you're wasting perfectly good 
computing time. Just switch to another program and get to work; the newly opened program 
keeps right on launching in the background. Multithreading simply means that Mac OS X can 
crunch more than one process at a time.

4.1 Launching Mac OS X Programs
What happens next depends on the program you're using. Most present you with a new, blank, untitled document. Some, 
like iMovie and iDVD, automatically open the last file you worked on. Some, like FileMaker and PowerPoint, ask you: Do 
you want to open an existing document or create a new one? And a few oddball programs don't open any window at all 
when first launched.
4.1.1 The Application Menu
In each case, however, the very first menu after the 
 appears with bold lettering and identifies the program you're using. 
It might say iTunes, or Microsoft Word, or Stickies.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Virtual Memory and Memory Allotments
I'm completely at sea when it comes to using memory in Mac OS X. There's no Memory control panel. There's 
no box to set the memory allotment in the Get Info dialog box of any program. There's no on/off switch for 
virtual memory. There's no RAM disk option. There isn't even an About This Macintosh box that shows where 
all my RAM (electronic memory) is going. What on earth is going on? 
Mac OS X handles memory with light-years more sophistication and skill than anything Mac fans have used 
before—so much so, in fact, that these controls no longer even exist.
In the old days, each program claimed a fixed amount of RAM for itself as soon as you launched it. You could 
view and adjust this number in the program's Get Info box. (That panel is still there, in fact, when you Get Info 
on a Mac OS 9 program.) When you launched a program, it instantly claimed 20 MB of memory (or whatever 
its programmers thought it might need).
But in Mac OS X, memory allotments are dynamic. They adjust themselves as needed, on the fly. When you 
launch a program, it might not use very much RAM at all. But when you then use that program to open a 
huge, complex document, the system supplies more memory automatically. Then, when you close that 
document, Mac OS X automatically returns the RAM it was using to the "pot," so that it's available for use by 
other programs and functions.
It's true that the About This Mac command no longer opens a little graph depicting how much RAM each 
program is using, as it did in Mac OS 9. There's no longer much point. The answer is always, "exactly as 
much memory as it needs, and it's changing minute by minute."
Still, if you're desperate to know how much memory each of your running programs is using at this instant, 
open your Applications
Utilities folder. Open the program called Activity Viewer. It presents a little table 
showing what percentage of your Mac's memory each running program is using (see Section 9.25.1).
Then there's the matter of virtual memory, which helps you open more programs simultaneously than should 
fit into the amount of RAM your computer has. This feature works by using a chunk of hard drive space as 
temporary overflow RAM when necessary. Of course, real memory delivers information to your Mac's brain 
many times faster than the hard drive, which is why virtual memory gained a reputation in the old Mac OS for 
slowing down your machine.
In Mac OS X, virtual memory is turned on all the time. But these days, virtual memory is far less likely to slow 
down your machine for a couple reasons. First, each program uses only as much RAM as it needs to begin 
with, so far less is wasted. Second, virtual memory in Mac OS X puts only pieces of your programs onto the 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-1.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:32 AM

4.1 Launching Mac OS X Programs
hard drive, minimizing the slowdown effect. In any case, even if you have 50 programs open, Mac OS X 
devotes much of your Mac's actual RAM to whatever program is frontmost, so the active program doesn't 
grow sluggish. You'll notice the sluggishness kicking in only when switching programs or when working on an 
absolutely huge document that overwhelms your installed RAM. (Want to see how much virtual memory has 
kicked in? Mac OS X can show you. See Section 16.4 for instructions.)
Therefore, if you find yourself receiving "out of memory" messages, which are otherwise unheard of in Mac 
OS X, it's probably because your hard drive is running out of space, thereby thwarting the efforts of Mac OS 
X's virtual memory scheme. Make more room—or install more RAM.
This Application menu (Figure 4-1) offers a number of commands pertaining to the entire program and its windows, 
including About, Quit, and Hide.
4.1.2 Quitting Programs
You quit a program in Mac OS X by pressing 
-Q, which is the keyboard equivalent of the Quit command. For Macintosh 
and Windows veterans, the only tricky part here is that the Quit command is no longer in the File menu—it's now at the 
bottom of the Application menu.
But Mac OS X offers two much more fun ways to quit a program:
G     Control-click a program's Dock icon and choose Quit from the pop-up menu.
G     When you've pressed 
-Tab to summon Panther's "heads-up display" of open programs (Section 4.2), type the 
letter Q without releasing the 
 key. The highlighted program quits instantly.
The first menu in every program lets you know, at a glance, which program you're actually in. It 
also offers overall program commands like Quit and Hide.

4.1 Launching Mac OS X Programs
4.1.3 Force Quitting Programs
Everybody knows that Mac OS X is a rock-solid operating system, but that doesn't mean that programs never screw up. 
Individual programs are as likely as ever to freeze—or, rather, to hang (to lock up and display the "spinning beach ball of 
death" cursor). In such cases, you have no choice but to force quit the program—the computer equivalent of terminating it 
with a blunt instrument.
The big Mac OS X difference is that doing so doesn't destabilize your Mac, meaning you don't have to restart it. In fact, you 
can usually reopen the very same program and get on with your life.
You can force quit a stuck program in any of several ways:
G     Control-click its Dock icon (or just hold your mouse down on it). Once the popup menu appears, press Option so 
that the Quit command now says Force Quit (see Figure 4-2). Bingo—that program is outta here.
G     Press Option-
-Esc, the traditional Mac force quit keystroke.
G     Choose 
Force Quit.
Either way, proceed as shown in Figure 4-2.
Again, force quitting is not bad for your Mac. Dire warnings don't appear. The only downside to force quitting a program is 
that you lose any unsaved changes to your open documents, along with any preference settings you may have changed 
while the program was open.
Panther introduces a very handy new key combination: Shift-Option-
-Escape. It force 
quits the frontmost program, no questions asked.
That's good to know when, for example, you can't get to the Dock or the 
 menu (because, 
for example, the locked-up program covers the entire screen, like Keynote).
In other situations, you can achieve the same purpose by pressing Shift as you choose 
Force Quit.
Top: You can force quit a program from the Dock, thanks to the Option key.
Bottom: When you press Option-
-Esc or choose Force Quit from the 
 menu, a tidy box 
listing all open programs appears. Just click the one you want to abort, click Force Quit, and 
click Force Quit again in the confirmation box. (Using more technical tools like the Unix kill 
command, there are other ways to jettison programs. But this is often the most convenient.)

4.2 The "Heads-Up" Program Switcher
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.2 The "Heads-Up" Program Switcher
Only one program can be in front, or active, at a time.
To make a different program active, you could simply repeat the technique you used to launch the program initially. Click its 
Dock icon, double-click a document icon, or whatever.
You can also switch to a different program by clicking its icon on the Dock. Doing so makes the program, along with any of 
its open windows and toolbars, pop to the front.
But Panther introduces a faster, more direct program-switching feature—faster, because you perform it entirely from the 
keyboard. Just hold down the 
 key and begin tapping the Tab key (Figure 4-3).
In fact, you can use this feature in three different ways, all of which are well worth learning:
POWER USERS' CLINIC
When Programs Are Actually Folders
You may have noticed that Mac OS X programs don't seem to have 50,000 support files strewn across your 
hard drive. To open AOL, you no longer need to first open an America Online folder; you can just double-click 
the AOL icon itself. That's a much better arrangement than in Mac OS 9 or Windows, where many programs 
must remain in special folders, surrounded by libraries, dictionaries, foreign language components, and other 
support files and folders.
The question is: Where did all those support files go?
Mac OS X features something called packages or bundles, which are folders that behave like single files. 
Every properly written Mac OS X program looks like a single, doubleclickable application icon. Yet to the Mac, 
it's actually a folder that contains both the actual application icon and all of its hidden support files. (Even 
documents can be packages, including iDVD project files and some TextEdit documents.)
If you'd like to prove this to yourself, try this experiment. Choose Go
Applications. See the Calculator 
program? Control-click it. From the contextual menu, choose Show Package Contents. You're asking Mac OS 
X to show you what's inside the Calculator "application icon" folder.
The Calculator package window opens, revealing a Contents folder that you've never seen before. If you open 
this folder, you'll find a handful of strange-looking, Unix-named folders and files that are, behind the scenes, 
pieces of the Calculator program itself.
The application-as-folder trick is convenient for you, of course, because it means that you're generally free to 
move the application to a different window—or uninstall the program by dragging this single icon to the Trash
—without worrying that you're leaving behind its entourage of support files. It's also convenient for 
programmers, because they can update certain aspects of their applications just by replacing one of these 
component files, without having to rewrite the entire program.
You can even try out this programmery benefit for yourself. In the case of the Calculator and many other Mac 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-2.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:49:34 AM

4.2 The "Heads-Up" Program Switcher
OS X programs, the Resources folder contains individual graphics file—PDF or TIFF files— that serve as the 
graphic elements that you see when using the program. For example, the file lcd.tiff in the calculator's 
Resources folder contains the image of the calculator's screen (where the numbers appear as you punch the 
calculator number buttons).
Using a graphics program, you can change the background of this light-yellow calculator screen to, say, light 
blue. The next time you double-click the Calculator—which you now realize is actually a folder behind the 
scenes—you'll see your modified calculator design.
 
G     If you keep the 
 key pressed, each press of the Tab key highlights the Dock icon of another program, in left-to-
right Dock order. Release both keys when you reach the one you want. Mac OS X brings the corresponding 
program to the front. (To move backward through the open programs, press Shift-
-Tab.)
Apple calls this Windowslike row of open program icons a "heads-up display," partly because 
it's translucent (like the projected "heads-up display" data screens on a Navy jet windshield) 
and partly because you don't have to look down to the Dock to see what you're doing. (Shown 
here superimposed on another window to illustrate its translucence.)

4.2 The "Heads-Up" Program Switcher
 
G     If you leave the 
 key pressed, you can choose a program by clicking its icon with your mouse.
G     A single press of 
-Tab takes you to the program you used most recently, and another press returns you to the 
program you started in.
Imagine that, for example, you're doing a lot of switching between two programs—your Web browser and your email 
program, for example. If you have five other programs open, you don't waste your time 
-Tabbing your way through all 
open programs just to "get back" to your Web browser.

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
In its day, the concept of overlapping windows on the screen was brilliant, innovative, and extremely effective. (Apple 
borrowed this idea from a research lab called Xerox PARC.) In that era before digital cameras, MP3 files, and the Internet, 
managing your windows was easy this way; after all, you had only about three of them.
These days, however, managing all the open windows in all the open programs can be like herding cats. Off you go, 
burrowing through the microscopic pop-up menus of your taskbar buttons (Windows XP) or the Dock (Mac OS X 10.2), 
trying to find the window you want. And heaven help you if you need to duck back to the desktop—to find a newly 
downloaded file, for example, or eject a disc. You'll have to fight your way through 50,000 other windows on your way to the 
bottom of the "deck."
Exposé, a new feature in Panther (for some, the new feature), represents the first fresh look at this problem in decades. 
The concept is delicious: With the press of the F9 key, Mac OS X shrinks all windows in all programs to a size that fits on 
the screen (Figure 4-4), like index cards on a bulletin board. You click the one you want, and you're there. It's fast, efficient, 
animated, and a lot of fun.
Top: Quick? Where's the Apple Web page in all this mess?
Bottom: With one tap of the F9 key, you can spot that window, shrunken but unencumbered 
and un-overlapped. As your cursor passes over each thumbnail, the window darkens and 
identifies itself, courtesy of the floating label that appears in its center. What's especially cool 
is that these aren't static snapshots of the windows at the moment you Exposé'd them. They're 
live, still-updating windows, as you'll discover if one of them contains a QuickTime movie 
during playback or a Web page that's still loading. If you're not pointing to a window, tapping 
F9 again turns off Exposé without changing anything; if you're pointing to a window, tapping F9 
again brings it forward. (As for programs running in Classic: They get out of the way when you 
Exposé them, but they don't appear in thumbnail form like Mac OS X program windows do.)

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
4.3.1 Three Ways to Exposé
That business about finding a buried window on your screen is probably the way you'll use Exposé the most often. But it's 
actually only one of three Exposé functions; the other two are described on the following pages.
4.3.1.1 Find one window in the current program
A second Exposé keystroke is designed to help you find a certain window only in the program you're using—a feature you'll 
probably find the most useful when you're Web browsing or word processing. When you tap F10 (the factory setting), all of 
the windows in the frontmost program spread out and shrink, if necessary, so that you can see all of them simultaneously, 
in full—and so that you can click the one you want (see Figure 4-5, top).
And now, tips:
Top: When you press the F10 key, you get a clear shot at any window in the current program 
(Safari, in this example). In the meantime, the rest of your screen attractively dims, as though 
someone has just shined a floodlight onto the windows of the program in question. It's a 
stunning effect.
Bottom: Tap the F11 key when you need to duck back to the desktop for a quick administrative 
chore. Here's your chance to find a file, throw something away, eject a disc, or whatever, 
without having to disturb your application windows. In either case, tap the same function key 
again to turn off Exposé. Or click one of the window edges, which you can see peeking out 
from all four edges of the screen.

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
of its windows spring to the fore, and all of the other programs' windows grow dim. (Shift-Tab, as usual, cycles 
through the programs in the opposite direction.)
G     Suppose you pressed F9 to shrink all programs' windows, but you decide that what you really meant to do was 
press F10 to see only one program's windows. The solution is to press the Tab key, which switches you into F10 
mode, dimming (and restoring to full size) all programs' windows but one. At this point, you can press Tab or Shift-
Tab to cycle through the open programs as described in the preceding paragraph.
G     Here's another way to change programs once you've "F10'ed" your windows: Press 
-Tab to bring up the "heads-
up display" (yes, even while your windows are shrunken). Tab your way through the program icons ( Figure 4-3) 
until the one you want is selected, and then release the keys. That program's windows spring to the front, still 
miniaturized and arrayed for your selection pleasure.
G     Press Shift as you tap the F-key to view the Exposé animation in slow motion.
G     Press F10 quickly twice to bring all of a program's windows to the front.
4.3.1.2 Return to the desktop
The third keystroke (F11 is the factory setting) may be the stealth breakthrough of Panther. It sends all windows in all 
programs cowering to the edges of your screen, revealing the desktop beneath in all its uncluttered splendor (Figure 4-5 , 
bottom). There they remain—forever, or until you tap F11 again, click a visible window edge, double-click an icon, or take 
some other window-selection step.
This is a spectacular opportunity to save hassle in situations like these:
G     You're writing an email message, and you want to attach a file. Tap F11, root around in the Finder until you locate 
the file you want. Begin to drag it, and then tap F9 to make it easier to find your email window. Move your cursor, 
with the file in mid-drag, directly over the outgoing message window; press F10 again to turn off Exposé; and 
release the cursor to create the attachment.
G     You want to open a different document. For many people, having access to the entire Finder beats the pants off 
having to use the Open dialog box. Double-clicking the icon you want automatically opens it and turns off Exposé.
G     You're on the Web, and you want to see if some file has finished downloading. Tap F11 to survey the situation on 
your desktop.
G     You're in Dreamweaver designing a Web page. You want to insert a graphic that's on your hard drive. But first you 
want to be sure it's in the proper local site folder. Press F11, do your housekeeping, then tap F11 again to pop 
straight back into what you were doing.
In essence, Apple has finally realized that the desktop really isn't "just another program." If the layer of open programs is 
the atmosphere, the Finder is the earth below.
You can switch among the three Exposé modes (F9, F10, or F11), even after you've 
triggered one. For example, if you press F10 to shrink only one program's windows, you can 
then press F11 to see the desktop, and then press F9 to shrink all programs' windows.
4.3.1.3 Another way to Exposé
Most of the time, you'll probably use Exposé in two steps. You'll tap the function key once to get the windows out of the 
way, and tap it again to bring them back (if, indeed, you haven't clicked a window to bring them back).
In some cases, though, you may find it easier to hold down the relevant key. For example, hold down F11 to see if a file is 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-3.html (5 of 8)5/3/2004 4:49:38 AM

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
finished downloading to the desktop, then release the key to bring back all of the windows. For quick window-clearing 
situations, that method saves you the step of having to press the key a second time to turn off Exposé.
4.3.2 Three Triggers for Exposé
Exposé is wonderful and all, but the standard keys for triggering its three functions—F9 to expose all windows, F10 for 
current-application windows, F11 for show-me-thedesktop— may leave something to be desired. For one thing, they may 
already be "taken" by other functions in your programs (like Microsoft Word) or even by your computer (like certain 
PowerBook G4 models, whose F9 and F10 keys adjust the keyboard illumination). For another thing, those keys are at the 
top of the keyboard where your typing fingers aren't used to going, and you may have to hunt to make sure you're pressing 
the right one.
Fortunately, you can reassign the Exposé functions to a huge range of other keys, with or without modifiers like Shift, 
Control, and Option. To view your options, choose 
System Preferences and then click the Exposé icon (Figure 4-6).
Here, you'll discover that you can trigger Exposé's functions in any of three ways:
4.3.2.1 Screen corners
The four pop-up menus (Figure 4-6) represent the four corners of your screen. Using these menus, you can assign an 
Exposé trigger to each corner; for example, if you choose Desktop from the first pop-up menu, when your pointer hits the 
upper-left corner of the screen, you'll hide all windows and expose the desktop. (To make the windows come back, click 
any visible edge of a window, or twitch the cursor back into the same corner.)
Depending on the size of your screen, this option can feel awkward at first. But if you've run out of keystrokes that aren't 
assigned to other functions, be glad that Apple offers you this alternative.
NOTE
In previous versions of Mac OS X, of course, whipping the pointer into a corner was one good way to turn on 
your screen saver. Apple hasn't forgotten about that, which is why you'll also find commands called Start 
Screen Saver and Disable Screen Saver in the pop-up menus. Apple wanted to make sure that you don't get 
confused and assign two different functions to the same corner.
4.3.2.2 Keystrokes
Also in the Exposé preferences, you'll find three pop-up menus—"All windows," "Application windows," and "Desktop"—that 
correspond to the three functions of Exposé as described earlier. You can't assign any old keystroke to Exposé, but you 
have far more options than the puny F9, F10, and F11 keys.
Within each pop-up menu, for example, you'll discover that all of your F-keys are available as triggers: F1, F2, F3, and so 
on. If, while the pop-up menu is open, you press one or more of your modifier keys (Shift, Option, Control, or 
), all of 
these F-key choices change to reflect the key you're pressing; now the pop-up menu says Shift-F1, Shift-F2, Shift-F3, and 
so on. That's how you can make Shift-F1 trigger the hide-all-windows function, for example.
You can trigger Exposé in any of three ways: by twitching your cursor into a certain corner of 
the screen (top), pressing a key (middle), or clicking the extra buttons on a non-Apple mouse 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-3.html (6 of 8)5/3/2004 4:49:38 AM

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
(bottom). Of course, there's nothing to stop you from setting up all three ways, so you can 
press in some situations and twitch or click in others.
 
These pop-up menus also contain choices like Left Shift, which refers to the Shift key on the left side of your keyboard. That 
is, instead of pressing F9 to make all your windows shrink, you could simply tap the Shift key. (This is only an example. 
Repeat: This is only an example. Actually using the Shift key to shrink all your windows is a terrible, terrible idea, as you'll 
quickly discover the next time you try to type a capital letter. This feature is intended exclusively for hunt-and-peck typists 
who never use the Shift key on one side.)

4.3 Exposé: Death to Window Clutter
If you have a laptop, you'll also find out that the Fn key (the neglected key in the lower-left corner of your keyboard) is also 
available for Exposé—and this time, it's a great choice, because Fn otherwise has very little direction in life.
4.3.2.3 Multiple-button mouse clicks
If you've equipped your Mac with a replacement mouse, one with more than one button, you see a third panel in System 
Preferences, labeled Mouse. Use these pop-up menus to assign the three Exposé modes to the various clickers on your 
mouse: rightclick to hide all windows, left-side click to reveal the desktop, and so on.

4.4 Hiding Programs the Old-Fashioned Way

4.4 Hiding Programs the Old-Fashioned Way
When it comes to getting windows out of your way, nothing can touch Exposé for speed, efficiency, and entertainment 
value. Once you've mastered it, the traditional rituals of hiding windows will surely seem charmingly quaint. "When I was 
your age," you'll tell your grandchildren, "we used to have to hold down the Option key to hide windows!"
But you know the drill at software companies: They addeth, but they never taketh away. All of the old techniques are still 
around for the benefit of Mac fans who use them by force of habit.
4.4.1 Hiding the Program You're Using
When a program is hidden, all of its windows, tool palettes, and button bars disappear. You can bring them back only by 
bringing the program to the front again (by clicking its Dock icon again, for example).
If your aim is to hide only the program you're currently using, Mac OS X offers a whole raft of approaches to the same 
problem. Many of them involve the Option key, as listed here:
G     Option-click any visible portion of the desktop. The program you were in vanishes, along with all of its windows.
G     Option-click any other program's icon on the Dock. You open that program (or bring all of its windows to the front) 
and hide all the windows of the one you were using.
G     Option-click any visible portion of another program's windows. Once again, you switch programs, hiding the one 
you were using at the time.
G     From the Application menu—the boldfaced menu that bears the program's name—choose Hide iPhoto (or 
whatever the program is).
G     When you've highlighted a Dock icon by pressing 
-Tab to rotate through the running programs, press the letter 
H key. The program hides itself instantly. Leave the 
 key down the whole time, and after pressing the H, press 
Tab again to move on to the next program. If you release the keys while "stopped" on the program instead, you'll 
bring it forward rather than hiding it.
G     Press 
-H. This may be the easiest and most useful trick of all (although it doesn't work in every program). Doing 
so hides the program you're in; you then "fall down" into the next running program.
Consider this radical, timesaving proposal: Never quit the programs you use frequently. 
Instead, simply hit 
-H whenever you're finished working in a program. That way, the next 
time you need it, the program launches with zero wait time.
There's a limit to this principle; if you have only 256 megabytes of memory and you keep ten 
programs open (and one of them is Photoshop), you'll incur a speed penalty. In more 
moderate situations, though, Mac OS X's virtual-memory scheme is so good, there's almost 
no downside to leaving your programs open all the time.
To un-hide a program and its windows, click its Dock icon again, choose the Show All command in the Application menu, or 
press 
-Tab to summon the heads-up application display.

4.4 Hiding Programs the Old-Fashioned Way
The Dock continues to display the icons of all running programs without any indication that 
you've hidden them. Fortunately, that's easy enough to fix. All you need is the shareware 
program TinkerTool, which is described in Section 17.1. It offers a simple checkbox that 
makes hidden programs appear with transparent Dock icons.
4.4.2 Hiding All Other Programs
Choosing Hide Others from your program's Application menu means, of course, "hide the windows of every program but 
this one." It even hides your Finder (desktop) windows, although desktop icons remain visible.
Better yet, there's a keystroke for this command: Option-
-H. That's one small step for keystrokes, one giant leap for 
productivity geeks.
If this trick interests you, you might also enjoy its Mac OS X-only corollary, described next.
4.4.3 The Bring-Forward, Hide-All-Others Trick
Here's a Mac OS X secret that has no precursor in Mac OS 9 or Windows. It's a terrific technique that lets you bring one 
program to the front (along with all of its open windows), and hide all other windows of all other open programs—all with 
one click. You might think of it as Hero mode, or Front-and-Center mode, or Clear My Calendar mode.
In any case, the trick is to Option-
-click the lucky program's icon on the Dock. As it jumps to the fore, all other windows 
on your Mac are instantly hidden. (You can bring them back, of course, by clicking the appropriate Dock icons.)
4.4.4 Hiding (Minimizing) Individual Windows
In Mac OS X, there's more to managing your window clutter than simply hiding entire programs. You can also hide or show 
individual windows of a single program. In fact, Apple must believe that hiding a window will become one of your favorite 
activities, because it offers at least four ways to do so, including:
G     Choose Window
Minimize Window, if your program offers such a command, or press 
-M.
G     Click the Minimize button on the window's title bar, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
G     Double-click the window's title bar.

4.4 Hiding Programs the Old-Fashioned Way
If you press the Option key as you perform the latter two techniques (and, in some programs, 
even the first one), you minimize all of your program's open windows to the Dock. (If you had 
several document windows open, they turn into side-by-side document icons on the Dock.) 
This isn't the same thing as hiding the entire program, as described previously—you remain 
in the same program, but now all of its windows are hidden.
Before Panther, alas, there was no way to bring them all back at once. You had to click their 
Dock icons one by one. But in Mac OS X 10.3—rejoice!—Option-clicking any one of a Cocoa 
program's minimized Dock windows restores all of that program's windows to full prominence.
When you click the center button on a window title bar, or double-click the title bar, or press 
-
M, you minimize that window, getting it out of your way and off your screen. It's now 
represented by a window icon on your Dock—which you can click to reopen the window. (All of 
this should sound familiar if you've used Windows—all, that is, except for the cool genie 
animation shown here.)

4.4 Hiding Programs the Old-Fashioned Way
In any case, the affected window shrinks down until it becomes a new icon on the right side of the Dock. Click that icon to 
bring the window back.

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
Every operating system needs a mechanism to associate documents with the applications that created them. When you 
double-click a Microsoft Word document icon, for example, it's clear that you want Microsoft Word to launch and open the 
document.
In Windows, every document bears a three-letter file name suffix. If you double-click something called memo.doc, it opens 
in Microsoft Word. If you double-click memo. wri, it opens in Microsoft Write, and so on.
Mac OS 9 uses a similar system, except that you never see the identifying codes. Instead, it relies on invisible, four-letter 
creator codes and type codes. Apple carefully monitors and tracks these four-letter codes, in conjunction with the various 
Mac software companies, so that no two codes are alike.
NOSTALGIC CORNER
Window Layering
In Mac OS 9, bringing a program to the foreground also brought all of its windows to the foreground. If you 
were working in Internet Explorer, but Word was running in the background with six open documents, all six 
windows would pop to the front when you switched to Word.
As shown here, however, Mac OS X takes a much more layered approach. It's entirely possible to wind up 
with the windows of different programs sandwiched and layered, front to back.
Suppose, for example, that you have Microsoft Excel in the foreground, but Word in the background. If you 
click within a visible portion of a background window, you bring only that window of Word to the front—a 
sandwiched effect that never would have been possible in Mac OS 9.
The remedy for this situation, if it bothers you, is the Window
 Bring All to Front command, which appears 
in the Finder and many other programs. It brings all of a program's windows to the front. (You can do the 
same thing by simply clicking the program's Dock icon, or using the 
-Tab "heads-up" display.)
In the Finder, if you prefer, you can also use the new Window
Arrange in Front command. To reveal it, 
press Option as you open the Window menu. (What used to say "Bring All to Front" changes to say "Arrange 
in Front.") Mac OS X responds by cascading all open Finder windows, stacking them diagonally, overlapping 
them so that only their title bars are visible.
Layered windows really shine when you're comparing two documents in two different programs, because it 
frees you of the window clutter of other open documents. But the time will come when you're ready to bring all 
of a background program's windows to the front. Get into the habit of clicking its Dock icon, or pressing 
-
Tab to select its icon, rather than clicking inside one window. When you do that, all open windows in that 
application come forward, from wherever they may be.

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
 
As a Macintosh/Unix hybrid, Mac OS X uses both creator codes (like Mac OS 9) and file name suffixes (like Windows).
It's possible to live a long and happy life without knowing anything about these codes and suffixes. Indeed, the vast majority 
of Mac fans may never even encounter them. But if you're prepared for a little bit of technical bushwhacking, you may 
discover that understanding creator/type codes and file name suffixes can be useful in troubleshooting, keeping your files 
private, and appreciating how Mac OS X works.
4.5.1 Type and Creator Codes
A Macintosh document's four-letter creator code identifies the program that will open it.
If you're curious to see these codes (which are usually invisible), download a program like Type and Creator Changer 
(available from the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com), and drag the icon in question onto its icon (Figure 
4.8).
As a little experimentation will soon show you, the creator code for a program and the documents it creates are identical—
MSWD for Microsoft Word, FMP3 for FileMaker Pro, and so on. That's the entire point: The creator code tells the Mac 
which program to open when you double-click a particular document.
Type and Creator Changer also reveals the second four-letter code in the DNA of most Macintosh icons: the type code. 
This code specifies the document's file format. Photoshop, for example, can create graphics in a multitude of different 
formats: GIF, JPEG, TIFF, and so on. If you inspect your Photoshop documents, you'll discover that they all share the same 
creator code, but have a wide variety of type codes.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-5.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 4:49:44 AM

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
If the type code is supposed to identify the file format of a document, does a standard 
application have a type code?
It does: APPL.
Drag any icon from the desktop directly onto Type and Creator Changer's icon to view the 
icon's type and creator codes. Capitalization and spaces count, so if you see a creator code 
that appears to have only three letters, then a space at the end is also part of the code.
 
When you double-click a document, Mac OS X checks to see if it has a creator code. If so, it then consults an invisible 
database of icons and codes. This database is the master index that lists the correspondence between creator codes and 
the applications that generate them. Together, the type and creator codes also specify which picture appears on a 
particular icon.
If the desktop file discovers a match—if, say, you double-clicked a document with creator code BOBO, which corresponds 
to the AppleWorks entry in your desktop database—then the corresponding program opens the document, which now 
appears on your screen.
4.5.2 File Name Extensions
In Mac OS X, plenty of documents don't have type and creator codes. Documents created by Cocoa applications (Section 
4.8), for example, generally don't.
That's because Mac OS X is a Unix operating system. In Unix, type and creator codes are unheard of. Instead, what 
determines which program opens when you doubleclick a document is its file name extension, just as in Windows. A file 
name extension is identifiable by a suffix following a period in the file's name, as in Letter to Mom.doc.
(Actually, the file name extension can be much longer than three letters. It can even identify the name of the program that 
will open when you double-click something. The file called Registration.setup, when double-clicked, launches the Mac OS X 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-5.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 4:49:44 AM

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
Setup application.)
The bottom line is that Mac OS X offers two different mechanisms that associate documents with the programs that created 
them. Mac OS X looks for type and creator codes first. Where they're absent, the file name suffixes kick in.
4.5.3 Hiding and Showing File Name Extensions
Mac OS X comes set to hide most file name extensions on the premise that they make the operating system look more 
technical and threatening. If you'd like to see them, however, choose Finder
Preferences, click the Advanced button, 
and turn on "Show all file name extensions." Now examine a few of your documents; you'll see that their names now display 
the previously hidden suffixes.
You can hide or show these suffixes on an icon-at-a-time basis, too (or a clump-at-atime basis). Just highlight the icon or 
icons you want to affect and then choose File
 Get Info. In the resulting Info window, proceed as shown in Figure 4-9.
4.5.4 Reassigning Documents to Programs
Unfortunately, type and creator codes aren't of much use when you encounter a document created by a program that you 
don't have. If I email you a MIDI file (a file-exchange format for music) that I exported from my Finale sheet music program, 
you won't be able to open it simply by double-clicking, unless you, too, have Finale installed. Even if you have a different 
sheet music program on your hard drive, just double-clicking the MIDI file won't, by itself, open it.
The file name extension system, meanwhile, has problems of its own. File name extensions are even less likely to pinpoint 
which parent program should open a particular document. Suppose you've downloaded a graphic called Sunset.JPG. Well, 
almost any program these days can open a JPEG graphic—AppleWorks, Word, Preview, Safari, and so on. How does Mac 
OS X know which of these programs to open when you double-click the file?
The answer is simple. You can reassign a document to a specific program (or all documents of its kind).
Top: In the Info window, open the Name & Extension pane. Now you can see what Mac OS X 
really thinks your file is called. Turn "Hide extension" on if you'd rather not see the file name 
suffix in the Finder.
Bottom: If you try to add a suffix of your own, Mac OS X objects, in effect saying, "Hey—I've 
already got a file name extension for this, even if you can't see it. Are you sure you know what 
you're doing?"

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
 
Here's the rundown:
4.5.4.1 Reassigning a certain document—just once
Double-clicking a graphics file generally opens it in Preview, the graphics viewer included with Mac OS X (see Section 
9.18). Most of the time, that's a perfectly good arrangement. But Preview can only display graphics—it can't edit them. What 
if you decide to edit a graphics file? You'd want it to open, just this once, into a different program—Photoshop Elements, for 
example.
To do so, you must access the Open With command. You can find it in two places:
G     Highlight the icon, and then choose File
Open With.
G     Control-click the file's icon. (Or right-click it, if your mouse has two buttons. Or, in a Finder window, highlight the 
icon and then open the Action menu.) From the resulting contextual menu, choose Open With.

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
In any case, study the submenu for a moment (Figure 4-10, top). The program whose name says "(default)" indicates which 
program usually opens this kind of document. From this pop-up menu, choose the name of the program you'd rather open 
this particular file, right now, just this once.
Top: The contextual menu offers a list of programs capable of opening an icon. If you were to 
press the Option key right now, the words Open With would suddenly change to say Always 
Open With.
Bottom: If you choose Other, you'll be prompted to choose a different program. Turn on Always 
Open With if you'll always want this document to open in the new parent program. Otherwise, 
this is a onetime reassignment.
 
4.5.4.2 Reassigning a certain document—permanently
After opening a TIFF file in, say, Photoshop Elements for editing, you haven't really made any changes in the fabric of your 
Mac universe. The next time you double-click that file, it will open once again in Preview.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-5.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 4:49:44 AM

4.5 How Documents Know Their Parents
If you wish this particular file would always open in GraphicConverter, the steps are slightly different. In fact, there are three 
different ways:
G     In the Choose an Application dialog box, turn on "Always Open With" (shown at bottom in Figure 4-10).
G     Start out with one of the techniques described previously (File
Open With, or Control-click the file's icon and 
choose Open With)—but after you see the menu, press the Option key, too. Before your very eyes, the Open With 
command changes to say Always Open With.
G     Highlight the icon, and then choose File
Get Info. Open the "Open with" panel. Choose a new "parent" 
program's name from the pop-up menu. You'll see that the word "(default)" changes position, now tacking itself 
onto the name of the new program you've chosen.
You can use the Get Info method to reassign the parenthood of a whole flock of selected 
icons at once. Once you've selected them, just choose File
Get Info, open the "Open 
with" panel, and choose a new program from the pop-up menu. The message at the top of 
the window—"22 items," for example—reminds you that you're changing the whole batch at 
once.
4.5.4.3 Reassigning all documents of this type
So much for reassigning one document (or group of documents) at a time. What if you're writing, say, a book about Mac OS 
X, and you've been taking a lot of screenshots? Mac OS X saves each captured screen illustration as a graphics file in PDF 
format. That's all fine, except that every time you double-click one of these, it opens into Preview, where you can't edit—you 
can only look.
Sure, you could reassign all of these files, one at a time, to a different program, but your grandchildren would have 
grandchildren by the time you finish. In this case, you want to tell Mac OS X, "For heaven's sake, make all PDF files open in 
Photoshop from now on!"
To make it happen, use the Get Info method described previously. (You can't do it using the File
Open With command, 
nor by Control-clicking the icon, nor by using the Action menu.)
Start by highlighting any PDF file. Choose File
Get Info. Open the "Open with" panel.
From its pop-up menu, choose the program you want to open this kind of document from now on. (If the one you prefer isn't 
listed, use the Other option, which opens the Choose an Application dialog box so that you can navigate to the one you 
want. Find, and double-click, the program.)
This time, however, follow up by clicking Change All beneath the pop-up menu. (This button is dimmed until you've actually 
selected a different program from the pop-up menu.) Mac OS X asks you to confirm by clicking Continue or pressing Enter.
From now on, double-clicking any similar kind of document opens it in the newly selected program.

4.6 Keyboard Control

4.6 Keyboard Control
Mac OS X offers a fantastic feature for anyone who believes that life is too short: keyboard-controllable menus, dialog boxes, pop-
up menus, and even Dock pop-up menus. You can operate every menu in every program without the mouse or add-on software.
Panther, in fact, takes this concept to a new extreme. You can now operate every control in every dialog box from the keyboard, 
including pop-up menus and checkboxes. And you can even redefine many of the built-in Mac OS X keystrokes, like Shift-
-3 to 
capture the screen as a graphic.
In fact, Mac OS X 10.3 even lets you add or change any menu command in any program. If you're a keyboard-shortcut lover, your 
cup runneth over.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Using the Dock or Sidebar for Drag-and-Drop
The Mac is smart about the relationship between documents and applications. If you double-click an AppleWorks 
document icon, for example, AppleWorks launches automatically and shows you the document.
But these days, it's occasionally useful to open a document using a program other than the one that created it. 
Perhaps, as is often the case with downloaded Internet graphics, you don't have the program that created it, or you 
don't know which one was used. This technique is also useful when opening a Read Me file into your word 
processor, such as Word, instead of the usual TextEdit program.
In such cases, the Dock is handy: Just drag the mystery document onto one of the Dock's tiles, as shown here. 
Doing so forces the program to open the document—if it can. (Dragging onto a program's icon in the Sidebar or even 
the Finder toolbar works just as well.)
Incidentally, only the Dock icons of programs that can, in fact, open the file you're dragging become highlighted. The 
others just shrug indifferently or even scoot aside, thinking you're trying to drag the file into the dock.
Pressing Option-
 as you drag forces them to be more tolerant. Now all Dock program icons "light up" as your 
document touches them, indicating that they'll at least try to open your file. Even so, a "could not be opened" error 
message may result. As they say in Cupertino, sometimes what a can really needs is a can opener.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-6.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:47 AM

4.6 Keyboard Control
Here are some of the ways you can control your Mac mouselessly. In the following descriptions, you'll encounter the factory 
settings for the keystrokes that do the magic—but as you'll note in a moment, you can change these key combos to anything you 
like. (That's fortunate, since many of them, out of the box, conflict with canned brightness and volume keystrokes for PowerBooks 
and iBooks.)
4.6.1 Control the Menus
When you press Control-F2, the 
- menu drops down. At this point, you can highlight individual commands on that menu by 
pressing the up or down arrow keys, or even typing the first couple letters of the command you want.
You move to a different menu by pressing the right and left arrow keys (or Tab and Shift-Tab). And you can "click" a menu 
command by pressing Enter, Return, or the Space bar.
You can also close the menu without making a selection by pressing Esc or 
period.
4.6.2 Control the Dock
Once you've pressed Control-F3, you can move to highlight any icon on the Dock by pressing the appropriate arrow keys (or, once 
again, Tab and Shift-Tab).
Then, once you've highlighted a Dock icon, you "click it" by pressing Enter or the Space bar. Again, if you change your mind, press 
Esc or 
-period.
Once you've highlighted a disk or folder icon, you can press the up or down arrow to make the list of 
its contents appear. (If you've positioned the Dock vertically, use the left or right arrow instead!)
Using the arrow keys, you can now highlight and open virtually anything in any disk or folder on the 
Dock. Similarly, once you've highlighted the icon of an application that has several windows open, 
you can press the up and down arrows to highlight the name of an individual window. When you 
press Enter, that window pops to the front.
4.6.3 Cycle Through Your Windows
Every time you press Control-F4, you bring the next window forward, eventually cycling through every window in every open 
program. Add the Shift key to cycle through them in the opposite order.
Of course, you may remember from Chapter 1 that Mac OS X offers a different keystroke for cycling through the different windows 
in your current program (it's 
-~, the tilde symbol at the upper-left of your keyboard). This keystroke, on the other hand, tours all 
windows in all programs. Both keystrokes are useful in different situations.
4.6.4 Control the Toolbar
This one is on the unpredictable side, but it more-or-less works in most programs that display a Mac OS X-style toolbar: the Finder, 
System Preferences, Sherlock, the iPhoto editing window, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-6.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:47 AM

4.6 Keyboard Control
When you press Control-F5, you highlight the first button on that toolbar. Move the "focus" by pressing the arrow keys or Tab and 
Shift-Tab. Then tap Enter or the Space bar to "click" the highlighted button.
4.6.5 Control Tool Palettes
In a few programs that feature floating tool palettes, you can highlight the frontmost palette by pressing Control-F6. At this point, 
use the arrow keys to highlight the various buttons on the palette. You can see the effect when, for example, you're editing text in 
TextEdit and you've also opened the Font palette. Pressing Control-F6 highlights the Font palette, taking the "focus" off your 
document.
Turn off any checkboxes for keystrokes that you never use—especially if they seem to conflict with 
identical keyboard shortcuts in your programs. In fact, there's even a keystroke that turns off all of 
the "full keyboard access" keystrokes (the ones that let you control menus, Dock, toolbars, palettes, 
and so on) all at once: Control-F1. (Don't mean to hurt your brain, but you can actually turn off even 
that keystroke.)
 
4.6.6 Control Dialog Boxes
Mac OS X 10.3 also lets you navigate and manipulate any dialog box from the keyboard. When this feature is turned on, pressing 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-6.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:47 AM

4.6 Keyboard Control
the Tab key highlights the next control of any type, whatever it may be—radio button, pop-up menu, and so on. Press the Space 
bar to "click" a button or open a pop-up menu. Once a menu is open, use the arrow keys (or type letter keys) to highlight 
commands on it, and the Space bar to "click" your choice.
At the bottom of the Keyboard & Mouse panel of System Preferences, you'll see a checkbox called, "Turn on full keyboard access." 
When that checkbox is off, pressing the Tab key works only to move among text boxes in the dialog box. It skips over radio 
buttons, pop-up menus, and checkboxes.
4.6.7 Changing a Menu Command
Suppose you love iPhoto (and who doesn't?). But one thing drives you crazy: The Revert to Original command, which discards all 
the changes you've ever made since taking the photo, has no keyboard equivalent. You must trek up to the menu bar every time 
you need that command.
Or maybe it drives you crazy that the Hide command is 
 -H in most programs, but not, for some nutty reason, in Photoshop.
This is why Panther lets you add keyboard shortcuts to menu commands that lack them—or change the command in programs 
whose key assignments break with tradition. (It works in any program that uses the standard Mac OS X menu software, which rules 
out Microsoft Word.) Here's the routine:
1.  Choose 
System Preferences. Click the Keyboard & Mouse button. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab 
button. 
You arrive at the dialog box shown in Figure 4-11.
2.  Click the + button just beneath the list. 
The dialog box shown in Figure 4-12appears.
3.  Indicate which program needs behavior modification. 
In this example, you'd choose iPhoto from the Application pop-up menu. (If the program's name doesn't appear in the pop-
up menu, choose Other; navigate to, and double-click, the program you want.)
If you choose All Applications from the top pop-up menu, you can change the keyboard combo for a 
certain combo command wherever it appears. You could, for example, change the keystroke for Page 
Setup, in every program at once.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-6.html (4 of 5)5/3/2004 4:49:47 AM

4.6 Keyboard Control
 
4.  Carefully type in the name of the menu command whose keyboard shortcut you want to change or add. 
Type it exactly as it appears in the menu, complete with capitalization and the little ellipsis (...) that may follow it. (You 
make the ellipsis character by pressing Option-semicolon.)
5.  Click in the Keyboard Shortcut box. Press the new or revised key combo you want. 
For example, press Control-R (for iPhoto's Revert to Original command). You'll see the Mac's notation of your keystroke 
appear in the Keyboard Shortcut box—unless, of course, the combo you selected is already in use within that program. In 
that case, you hear only an error sound that means, "Try again."
6.  Click Add. 
The dialog box closes. By scrolling down in your Keyboard Shortcuts list, you'll see that the keystroke you selected has 
now been written down for posterity under the appropriate program's flippy triangle. (To get rid of it, click its name and then 
click the - button beneath the list.)
The next time you open the program you edited, you'll see that the new keystroke is in place.

4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
When you choose File
Save, you're asked where you want the new document stored on your hard drive. In Panther, the resulting dialog 
box is crystal-clear—more than ever, it's a miniature Finder. All of the skills you've picked up working at the desktop come into play here.
To give it a try, launch any included Mac OS X program that has a Save or Export command—TextEdit, for example. (Not all programs from 
other software companies have yet updated their Save dialog boxes.) Type a couple of words and then choose File
Save. The Save 
sheet appears ( Figure 4-13).
In Mac OS X, a quick glance at the Close button in the upper-left corner of a document window tells you 
whether it's been saved. When a small dot appears in the red button, it means you've made changes to the 
document that you haven't yet saved (time to press 
-S!). The dot disappears as soon as you save your 
work.
4.7.1 Sheets
In the days of antique operating systems like Mac OS 9 and Windows, the Save dialog box appeared dead center on the screen, where it 
commandeered your entire operation. You weren't allowed to switch to any other document until you clicked Save or Cancel to close the 
dialog box. Moreover, because it seemed stuck to your screen rather than to a particular document, you couldn't actually tell which document 
you were saving—a real problem when you quit out of a program that had three unsaved documents open.
All of this struck Mac OS X's designers as user-hostile and unnecessarily rigid.
In most Mac OS X programs, there's no mystery regarding which document you're saving, because a little Save dialog box called a sheet 
slides directly out of the document's title bar. Now there's no mistaking which document you're saving.
Better still, you can think of this little Save box as a sticky note attached to the document. It will stay there, neatly attached and waiting, even 
if you switch to another program, another document within the same program, the desktop, or wherever. When you finally return to the 
document, the Save sheet will still be there, waiting for you to type a file name and save the document.
Top: The Save dialog box, or sheet, initially appears in a compact view. Right (inset): If you open the Where 
pop-up menu, you'll find that Mac OS X neatly lists all the places it thinks you might want to save your new 
document: on the hard drive or iDisk, in a folder that you've put into your Sidebar (Section 1.2.1), or into a 
folder you've recently opened.
Bottom: If you want to choose a different folder or create a new folder, click the downpointing triangle to 
expand the dialog box. Here, you see the equivalent of the Finder—with a choice of list or column view. (In 
this view, the Where pop-up menu now reveals the folder hierarchy—the folder path—that you've descended 
to reach the folder location before you.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-7.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:51 AM

4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
 
4.7.2 Simplified Navigation
Of course, you, O savvy reader, have probably never saved a document into some deeply nested folder by accident, never to see it again. 
But millions of novices (and even a few experts) have fallen into this trap.
When the Save sheet appears, however, a pop-up menu shows you precisely where Mac OS X proposes putting your newly created 
document: usually in the Documents folder of your own Home folder. For many people, this is an excellent suggestion. If you keep everything 
in your Documents folder, it will be extremely easy to find, and you'll be able to back up your work just by dragging that single folder to a 
backup disk.
But as described in Figure 4-13, the Where pop-up menu gives you direct access to some other places you might want to save a newly 
created file. (The keystrokes for the most important folders work here, too—Shift-
-H for your Home folder, for example.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-7.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:51 AM

4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
The Save box always displays whatever places you've put in your Sidebar. (In compact view, the Where pop-
up menu lists them; in expanded view, you see the Sidebar itself.)
The bottom line: If, on some project, you find yourself wanting to save new documents into the same deeply 
buried folder all the time, press F11 to duck back to the Finder, and add it to your Sidebar. From now on, 
you'll have quick access to it from the Save dialog box.
4.7.3 Column View/List View Navigation
When you save a file, the options in the Where pop-up menu have you covered 90 percent of the time. Most people work with a limited set of 
folders for active documents.
But when you want to save a new document into a new folder, or when you want to navigate to a folder that isn't listed in the Where pop-up 
menu, all is not lost. Click the large black triangle shown in Figure 4-13.
After a moment, a familiar scene appears: a compact version of a Finder window. You should be on reassuring turf here: There's your 
Sidebar (Section 1.2.1), there's your toggle switch between list and column views (although no icon view), there's the Back button, and so on. 
No other operating system on earth makes it so easy to navigate your folders from within the Save dialog box.
In column view, your first instinct should be to widen this window, making more columns available. Do so by 
carefully dragging the lower-right corner of the dialog box. Mac OS X will remember the size you like for this 
Save sheet independently in each program.
Most of the familiar Finder-navigation shortcuts work here, too. For example, press the right and left arrow keys to navigate the columns, or 
the up and down arrow keys to highlight the disk and folder names within a column. Once you've highlighted a column, you can also type to 
select the first letters of disk or folder names.
Highlight the name of the folder in which you want to save your newly created document. Alternatively, you can click the New Folder button 
to create a new folder inside whatever folder is highlighted in the column view. (The usual New Folder keystroke works here, too: Shift-
-
N.) You'll be asked to type the new name for the folder. After you've done so, click Create (or press Enter). The new folder appears in the 
rightmost pane of the column view. You can now proceed with saving your new document into it, if you like.
The next time you save a new document, the Save sheet will reappear in whatever condition you left it. That is, if you used column view the 
last time, it will still be in column view. At any time, you can collapse it into simplified view, shown at top in Figure 4-12, by again clicking the 
fat black triangle to the right of the Where pop-up menu.
4.7.4 Insta-Jumping to a Folder Location
Whether you're using the mini-sheet or the expanded view, you can save yourself some folder-burrowing time by following the tip shown in 
Figure 4-14. This feature is totally undocumented—but well worth learning.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-7.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:51 AM

4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
If, when the Save box in its expanded condition, you click the name of an existing file, Mac OS X thoughtfully 
copies the name of the clicked file into the Save As: text box (which otherwise said "Untitled" or was blank).
This trick can save you time when you're saving a second document with a slightly modified name (Oprah 
and Me: The Inside Story, Chapter 1 and then Oprah and Me: The Inside Story, Chapter 2). It's also useful if 
you want to replace the original file with the new one you're saving. Instead of having to type out the entire 
name of the file, you can just click it.
The quickest way to specify a folder location is to drag the icon of any folder or disk from your desktop 
directly into the Save or Open sheet. Mac OS X instantly displays the contents of that folder or disk. You'll 
see by the Where pop-up menu that Mac OS X has indeed understood your intention.
 
4.7.5 The File Format Pop-up Menu
The Save dialog box in many programs offers a pop-up menu of file formats below the Save As box. Use this menu when preparing a 
document for use by somebody else—somebody whose computer doesn't have the same software. For example, if you've used a graphics 
program to prepare a photograph for use on the Web, this menu is where you specify JPEG format (the standard Web format for photos).
4.7.6 The Open File Dialog Box
The dialog box that appears when you choose File
Open is almost identical to the expanded Save File sheet (see Figure 4-15). Because 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-7.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 4:49:51 AM

4.7 The Save and Open Dialog Boxes
you encounter it only when you're opening an existing file, this dialog box lacks the New Folder button, Save button, file name field, and so 
on.
Most of the other Save File dialog box controls, however, are equally useful here. Once again, you can begin your navigation by seeing 
what's on the desktop (press 
-D) or in your Home folder (press Shift-
-H). Once again, you can find a folder or disk by beginning your 
quest with the Sidebar, and then navigate using either list or column view. And once again, you can drag a folder or disk off your desktop 
directly into the dialog box to specify where you want to look.
When you've finally located the file you want to open, do so by double-clicking it or highlighting it (which you can do from the keyboard), and 
then pressing Return, Enter, or 
-O.
In general, most people don't encounter the Open File dialog box nearly as often as the Save File dialog box. That's because the Mac offers 
many more convenient ways to open a file—double-clicking its icon in the Finder, choosing its name from the 
 Recent Items 
command, and so on—but only a single way to save a new file.
NOTE
In Panther, Apple removed the Go To box from the bottom of the Open sheet. That is, you can no longer type a folder path 
(such as ~/pictures or ~/pi and a Tab) right into the blank—or at least that's what you're supposed to think. In fact, though, you 
can still summon that old friendly "Go To" dialog box by pressing Shift-
-G.
Mac OS X's Open dialog box shows you only icons for disks, folders, and documents that you can actually 
open at this moment. For example, when using Preview as shown here, Word and TextEdit documents 
appear dimmed and unavailable, while picture files show up fine.

4.8 Three Kinds of Programs: Cocoa, Carbon, Classic
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.8 Three Kinds of Programs: Cocoa, Carbon, Classic
Mac OS X was supposed to make life simpler. It was supposed to eliminate the confusion and complexity that the old Mac 
OS had accumulated over the years—and replace it with a smooth, simple, solid system.
In a few years, that's exactly what Mac OS X will be. For the moment, however, you're stuck with running three different 
kinds of programs, each with different characteristics: Cocoa, Carbon, and Classic.
The explanation involves a little bit of history and a little bit of logic. To take full advantage of Mac OS X's considerable 
technical benefits, software companies must write new programs for it from scratch. So what should Apple do—send out an 
email to the authors of the 18,000 existing Mac programs, suggesting that they throw out their programs and rewrite them 
from the bottom up?
At big companies like Microsoft and Adobe, such a suggestion would wind up on the Joke of the Week bulletin board.
Instead, Apple gave software companies a break. It wrote Mac OS X to let programmers and software companies choose 
precisely how much work they wanted to put into compatibility with the new system. The various levels include:
G     Do nothing at all (Classic). Let's face it: Software companies go out of business, unprofitable product lines are 
dropped, and shareware authors go off to law school. All of them leave behind orphaned programs that run only on 
the old Mac OS.
Your Mac OS X machine can still run this entire library of older software. When you try to open one of these older 
programs, Mac OS X launches a Mac OS 9 simulator called the Classic environment. Suddenly your screen is 
taken over by the ghost of Mac OS 9. Sure, you leave behind all the trappings (and benefits) of Mac OS X—its new 
look, crash protection, and so on—but at least you're still running your favorite programs.
The point here is that Mac OS X doesn't necessarily relieve you of having to know something about Mac OS 9. Like 
it or not, until a huge library of Mac OS X programs is available, most people wind up having to master both Mac 
OS X and certain elements of Mac OS 9.
See Chapter 5 for much more detail on the Classic environment.
G     Update the existing programs (Carbon). If software companies and programmers are willing to put some effort 
into getting with the Mac OS X program, they can simply adapt, or update, their existing software so that it works 
with Mac OS X. The resulting software looks and feels almost every bit like a true Mac OS X program—you get the 
crash protection, the good looks, the cool-looking graphics, the Save sheets, and so on—but behind the scenes, 
the bulk of the computer programming is the same as it was in Mac OS 9. These are what Apple calls Carbonized 
programs, named for the technology (Carbon) that permits them to run on Mac OS X.
Most Carbonized programs don't offer all of the features available to Mac OS X, however. In the following pages, 
you'll discover which Mac OS X goodies you sacrifice when using programs adapted in this way.
On the other hand, such software offers a spectacular feature that software companies like a lot: the ability of a 
single Carbonized program to run on both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. (Not all do—Microsoft Office X doesn't run on 
Mac OS 9, for example.) For the next few years, most of the big-name software companies will produce nothing but 
Carbonized programs.

4.8 Three Kinds of Programs: Cocoa, Carbon, Classic
Other examples of Carbonized programs include AppleWorks, iMovie 2, iTunes, Photoshop, FileMaker, Internet 
Explorer, and, believe it or not, the Finder itself.
G     Write new programs from scratch (Cocoa). As Mac OS X becomes a bigger and bigger hit, more and more 
programmers and software companies create new programs exclusively for it. The geeks call such programs 
Cocoa applications. Although they look exactly like Carbonized programs, they feel a little bit more smooth and 
solid. They may run slightly slower than Carbonized programs (witness iMovie 2 vs. iMovie 3), but they offer a 
number of special features not offered by Carbonized programs.
Many of the programs that come with Mac OS X are true Cocoa applications, including iMovie 3, iDVD, Safari, 
iChat AV, iPhoto, TextEdit, Stickies, Mail, Address Book, and so on.
Having trouble keeping the definitions of Carbon and Cocoa straight? You wouldn't be alone; 
it's like reading a novel where two characters' names start with the same letter. Here's one 
way to remember: Carbon programs are generally the older ones, those that might require 
carbon dating techniques to calculate their ages.

4.9 The Cocoa Difference

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
Here are some of the advantages offered by Cocoa programs. It's worth reading—not to make you drool about a future 
when all Mac programs will fall into this category, but to help clear up any confusion you may have about why certain 
features seem to be present only occasionally.
NOTE
The following features appear in almost all Cocoa programs. That's not to say that you'll never see these 
features in Carbonized programs; the occasional Carbon program may offer one of these features or 
another. That's because programmers have to do quite a bit of work to bring them into Carbon applications— 
and almost none to include them in Cocoa ones.
4.9.1 The Font Panel
The Mac has always been the designer's preferred computer, and Mac OS X only strengthens its position. For one thing, 
Mac OS X comes with about 100 absolutely beautiful fonts that Apple licensed from commercial type companies—about 
$1,000 worth, according to Apple.
When you use a Carbon program, you usually access these fonts the same way as always: using a Font menu. But when 
you use a Cocoa program, you get the Fonts panel, which makes it far easier to organize, search, and use your font 
collection. Chapter 13 describes fonts, and the Font panel, in more detail.
4.9.2 Title Bar Tricks
You may remember from Chapter 1 that the title bar of every Finder window harbors a secret pop-up menu. When you 
-
click it, you're shown a little folder ladder that delineates your current position in your folder hierarchy. You may also 
remember that the tiny icon just to the left of the window's name is actually a handle that you can drag to move a folder into 
a different window.
In Cocoa programs, you get the same features in document windows, as shown in Figure 4-16. (This feature is available in 
many Carbonized programs, but it isn't a sure thing.) By dragging the tiny document icon next to the document's name, you 
can perform these two interesting stunts:
G     Drag to the desktop. By dragging this icon to the desktop, or onto a folder or disk icon, you create an instant alias 
of the document you're working on. This is a useful feature when, for example, you're about to knock off for the 
night, and you want easy access to whatever you've been working on when you return the next day.
G     Drag to the Dock. By dragging this title-bar icon onto the Dock icon of an appropriate program, you open your 
document in that other program. For example, if you're in TextEdit working on a memo, and you decide that you'll 
need the full strength of Microsoft Word to dress it up, you can drag its title-bar icon directly onto the Word icon in 
the Dock. Word then launches and opens up the TextEdit document, ready for editing.
Top: By dragging the document- window proxy icon, you can create an alias of your document 
on the desktop or anywhere else. Bottom: If you 
-click the name of the document in its title 
bar, you get to see exactly where this document sits on your hard drive. (Choosing the name of

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
one of these folders opens that folder and switches you to the Finder.)
 
Unfortunately, you can't drag an open document directly into the Trash—a technique that could come in handy for writers 
who struggle with first drafts.
4.9.3 Services
Apple has always dreamed of a software architecture that would let you mix and match features from different programs—
using the AppleWorks spelling checker in Microsoft Word, the drawing tools of PowerPoint in your email program, and so 
on. (Remember Apple's OpenDoc software project? Neither does anybody else.)
In Mac OS X, Apple's dream has finally become a reality. Nestled in the Application menu of almost every Mac OS X 
program is a command called Services. Its submenu lists several functions that technically belong to other programs, as 
described below (Figure 4-17).
Unfortunately, these commands are dimmed when you use most Carbonized programs (like AppleWorks, Microsoft Office, 
and Internet Explorer). They become available only when you use Cocoa programs like iChat, TextEdit, Mail, OmniWeb—
and the Finder. (Yes, the Finder is a Carbon program. But remember that programmers can add Cocoa features to their 
older, Carbonized programs; it just takes a lot of work.)
Here's a rundown of what they do.
NOTE
Not all of these Services work in all programs—even Cocoa programs. Implementing them is left to 
programmers' discretion. In these early days of Mac OS X, a little unpredictability along these lines is par for 
the course.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (2 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
4.9.3.1 Finder
The three commands listed in this submenu work only in one situation: When you've highlighted some text that precisely 
matches the name and folder path of any icon, such as ~/Documents/Marge.jpg). (Details on path notation in Section 1.2.2)
At that point, you can choose any of these commands from the Services
Finder submenu:
G     Open. Opens the icon. This command, in effect, lets you open any file on your hard drive, from within any Cocoa 
program, without having to switch to the Finder. For example, you could keep a list of your favorite files and 
programs in a TextEdit document, ready for opening without having to leave the program.
G     Reveal. Takes you to the Finder, where the specified icon is highlighted and its enclosing folder opened into a 
window.
G     Show Info. Switches to the Finder, where the Get Info window for the specified file opens, for your inspection 
pleasure.
If what you've highlighted isn't the name and path of a document, you'll get only an error message.
4.9.3.2 Grab
Grab is a screen-capture program in your Applications
Utilities folder. You use it to turn what you see onscreen into 
graphics files. It's especially handy when writing computer books or training manuals.
The Grab service, in theory, lets you take your software snapshot from within any Cocoa application, without having to go 
find and launch Grab separately. Unfortunately, it's available only in programs that can accept pasted graphics. You'll find 
details on Grab's submenu commands (Screen, Selection, Timed Screen) in Section 9.25.14.
4.9.3.3 Import Image
This option, new in Panther, lets you import a digital photo from a scanner or digital camera, if one is attached and ready to 
roll. Like Grab, it works only in Cocoa programs that accept pasted graphics, and like Image Capture (on which it's based), 
it can operate only Webcammable digital cameras and compatible scanners (see Section 9.10).
4.9.3.4 Mail 
This handy command springs to life only after you've highlighted some text in a Cocoa program—or a file in the Finder.
G     Send Selection. In one step, the Mail Text command launches the Mail program and pastes the highlighted text 
into the body of a new, outgoing email message. You're saved the trouble of copying, launching Mail, creating a 
new message, and pasting. You might use this feature when, for example, you find something interesting on a Web 
page, and you'd like to email it to someone.
G     Send To. This command is useful only if you've highlighted an email address in a text document. This command, 
too, switches to Mail and creates a new, outgoing message—but this time, Mac OS X pastes the text you've 
highlighted into the "To:" field.
4.9.3.5 Make New Sticky Note
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (3 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
This command copies whatever text you've got highlighted, switches to your Stickies program (Section 9.22), creates a new 
sticky note, and pastes your selected material in it. If you're the kind of person who keeps your life—lists, passwords, 
favorite URLs, to do list, notes, and so on—in Stickies, this one can save you considerable hassle. No wonder Apple 
endowed it with its own keyboard shortcut: Shift-
-Y.
4.9.3.6 Open URL
When you highlight a Web address in any program, choosing this command fires up your Web browser and takes you to 
the indicated page.
4.9.3.7 Script Editor
For AppleScript fans only.
G     Get Result of AppleScript. This command processes whatever text you've highlighted as an AppleScript—and 
then replaces the selected text by the result of your script.
G     Make New AppleScript. This item works just like Make New Sticky Note, except that it copies your text into Script 
Editor rather than Stickies.
G     Run as AppleScript. This one runs a selected blot of text as if it were an AppleScript, much like Get Result of 
AppleScript. The only difference: It doesn't replace the selected text with the result of your script.
None of these Script Editor services do any error checking. If you forget a quotation mark in your script, it simply won't run.
If you know how to use the do shell script command, you can run Unix commands directly 
from your service-enabled programs (see Chapters 7 and 15).
4.9.3.8 Search with Google
Never let it be said that inspiration is dead in the post-tech-bubble era. This unassuming command, new in Panther, adds a 
powerful research assistant to every program where you can type. Highlight a phrase— Picasso, electric curtains, Yankees 
game—and hit this command. In seconds, you're online, in your Web browser, facing a list of Web pages from a Google 
search for that topic. It's a dictionary, thesaurus, news service, and stock ticker all in one.
The gang at Apple loves this one, too. They blessed it with its own keyboard shortcut: Shift-
-L (for lookup).
4.9.3.9 Send File to Bluetooth Device
Bluetooth is a short-range, wireless, cable-elimination technology. It's great for tossing files between two Macs (or a Mac 
and a Windows laptop, for that matter), on the fly, on a plane, without any cables or setup. (Your Mac must have a 
Bluetooth transmitter, of course. All current PowerBooks do, for example.)
If you've highlighted the path of a file (see the tip below), this command grabs the file and hands it off to Bluetooth File 
Exchange, which begins the process of transmitting it to a nearby Bluetooth computer. (Section 6.2.6 describes this ritual.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (4 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
4.9.3.10 Speech
As detailed in Chapter 14, Mac OS X doesn't just display text onscreen—it can actually read it out loud.
G     Start Speaking Text. Start by highlighting some text in a Cocoa program. Then choose this command, and presto: 
The Mac actually reads the text out loud, using the character voice you've chosen in System Preferences (Section 
14.5).
G     Stop Speaking. This command makes the Mac shut up.
If you highlight an icon in the Finder, the Start Speaking Text command reads its path to you. 
For example, for a Flowers.tiff file in your Home
Pictures folder, whose path is Users/
chris/Pictures/Flowers. tiff, the Mac says, "Users, Chris, Pictures, Flowers dot tiff."
4.9.3.11 Summarize
Talk about intriguing: When you choose this command after highlighting some text, the Mac analyzes the sentences you've 
highlighted and, after a moment, launches Summary Service. This little program, which you probably never even knew you 
had, displays a greatly shortened version of the original text. Figure 4-17 offers details.
To save the summarized document as a TextEdit document, choose File
Save As.
Use the Summarize command to create a one-paragraph summary (bottom) of a longer passage 
(top). Once the summary appears in the Summary Service program, you can make the summary 
more or less concise by dragging the Summary Size slider. You can also ask it to display the 
most statistically relevant paragraphs instead of sentences, just by clicking the appropriate 
radio button at the lower left.
(Note: Bear in mind that Summary Service doesn't actually do any creative rewriting; even Mac 
OS X can't come up with something coherent if the original wasn't. Instead, Summary Service 
chooses the most statistically significant sentences to include in the summary.)

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
 
4.9.3.12 TextEdit
This pair of commands also requires you to first highlight some text.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (6 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
G     New Window Containing Selection. If you've highlighted some blob of text—on a Web page, say—this command 
automatically launches TextEdit, creates a new untitled document, and pastes the highlighted text.
G     Open Selected File. This command works only if you've highlighted some text that matches the name and folder 
path of a TextEdit document (including its folder path, like ~/Documents/essay.txt). If so, you can choose 
Services
TextEdit
 Open Selected File to find and open that document in TextEdit. (If what you've 
highlighted isn't the name of a document, you'll get only an error message.)
Although these are the commands that come built into a fresh installation of Mac OS X, that's not the end of the versatility. 
The real beauty of Services is that as new, clever applications come along, they can add their own commands to this menu 
for your data-manipulation pleasure.
InstantLinks, a piece of $5 shareware from Subsume Technologies, offers a useful look 
ahead to the future of Services. It adds to your Services menu commands that send your 
highlighted text to various services on the Web.
For example, you can choose Dictionary Lookup (looks up the selected text in an online 
dictionary), Map Location (looks up the selected address at MapQuest.com—great when 
somebody emails you an invitation), Open URL, Search Web, and Thesaurus Lookup. You 
can download it from the "Missing CD" page of www.missingmanuals.com.
4.9.4 Toolbar Tricks
The toolbar is an increasingly common sight at the top of modern application windows. In any thoughtfully written program, 
the Customize Toolbar command lets you determine how you want this toolbar to show up—with icons, icons with text 
labels beneath them, with text labels alone to save window space, and so on.
By 
-clicking the toolbar button repeatedly, you can cycle among various toolbar styles. This 
technique works in most toolbar-equipped Cocoa programs (and even the Finder, although it's 
technically a Carbonized program). In Mail, for example, you can cycle between six different 
toolbar styles: with icons and labels (large and small); with icons only (large and small); and 
with text labels only (large and small).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (7 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
 
But in many Cocoa programs—including OmniWeb, Mail, Address Book, and XCode—there's a much faster way to switch 
among these toolbar styles: Just 
-click the white button shown in Figure 4.18.
4.9.5 Secret Keyboard Shortcuts
For the most part, it's possible to ignore the Unix that beats within the heart of Mac OS X. But every now and then, a 
refreshing reminder pokes its head up through the fields of brushed metal—and here's one of them.
Although you'll never see it mentioned in the user manuals for Cocoa applications (if there even were such thing as user 
manuals anymore), all of them respond to certain keystrokes left over from the NeXT operating system (Mac OS X's 
ancestor). If you're a card-carrying number of KIAFTMA (the Keyboard Is Always Faster Than the Mouse Association), 
you'll love these additional keyboard navigation strokes:
G     Control-A. Moves your insertion point to the beginning of the paragraph. (Mnemonic: A = beginning of the 
Alphabet.)
G     Control-E. Deposits your insertion point at the end of the paragraph. (Mnemonic: E = End.)
G     Control-D. Forward delete (deletes the letter to the right of the insertion point).
G     Control-K. Instantly deletes all text from the insertion point to the right end of the line. (Mnemonic: K = Kills the rest 
of the line.)
G     Control-O. Inserts a paragraph break, much like Return, but leaves the insertion point where it was, above the 
break. This is the ideal trick for breaking a paragraph in half when you've just thought of a better ending for the first 
part.
G     Control-T. Moves the insertion point one letter to the right—and along with it, drags whichever letter was to its left. 
(Mnemonic: T = Transpose letters.)
G     Option-Delete. Deletes the entire word to the left of the insertion point. When you're typing along in a hurry, and 
you discover that you've just made a typo, this is the keystroke you want. It's much faster to nuke the previous word 
and retype it than to fiddle around with the mouse and the insertion point just to fix one letter.
Four additional keystrokes duplicate the functions of the arrow keys. Still, as long as you've got your pinky on that Control 
key...
G     Control-B, Control-F. Moves the insertion point one character to the left or right, just like the left and right arrow 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-9.html (8 of 9)5/3/2004 4:49:58 AM

4.9 The Cocoa Difference
keys. (Mnemonic: Back, Forward).
G     Control-N, Control-P. Moves the insertion point one row down or up, like the down and up arrow keys. 
(Mnemonic: Next, Previous).
4.9.6 Background Window Control
As hinted in Chapter 1, the 
 key unlocks a slick trick in Cocoa programs: It lets you operate the buttons and controls of 
an inactive, background window without bringing it to the front. You can operate a background window's resize box, 
buttons, pop-up menus, and scroll bars, all while another window is in front of it. In fact, you can even drag through text in a 
background window—and then drag-and-drop it into the foreground window. (Freaky!)
In every case, the secret is simply to keep 
 pressed as you click or drag.

4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
In general, new programs arrive on your Mac via one of two avenues: on a CD, or via an Internet download. The CD 
method is slightly simpler; see "Performing the Installation" later in this section.
For help installing downloaded programs, on the other hand, read on.
4.10.1 .sit, .zip, .tar, and .gz
Programs you download from the Internet generally arrive in a specially encoded, compressed form. The downloaded file's 
name usually has one of these file name extensions:
G     .sit indicates a StuffIt file, the standard Macintosh file-compression format.
G     .zip is the standard Windows compression file format—and, because Panther has a built-in Create [.zip] Archive 
command right in the File menu, it may become the new standard Macintosh compression format. (That would 
certainly make life easier for people who have to exchange files with the Windows crowd.)
G     .tar is short for tape archive, an ancient Unix utility that combines (but doesn't compress) several files into a single 
icon, for simplicity in sending.
G     .gz is short for gzip, a standard Unix compression format.
G     .tar.gz or .tgz represents one compressed archive containing several files.
G     .dmg is a disk image, described below.
Fortunately, if you use Safari (Chapter 20) as your Web browser, you don't have to worry about all this, because it 
automatically unzips and unstuffs them. If you use some other browser, StuffIt Expander can turn all of them back into 
usable form. In fact, StuffIt Expander, a program in your Applications
Utilities folder, generally kicks in automatically 
when you download a file. (If it doesn't, double-click a downloaded compressed file to spur Expander into action.)
4.10.2 Disk Images (.dmg files)
Once you've unstuffed (or untarred) a downloaded program, it often takes the form of a disk image file, whose name ends 
with the letters .dmg (second from top in Figure 4.19). (Some files arrive as disk images straight from the Web, too, without 
having been compressed first.)
Disk images have been around for years on the Mac, but they're extremely common in Mac OS X. All you have to do is 
double-click the .dmg icon. After a moment, it magically turns into a disk icon on your desktop, which you can work with just 
as though it's a real disk (third from top in Figure 4.19). For example:
G     Double-click it to open it. The software you downloaded is right inside.
G     Remove it from your desktop by dragging it to the Trash (whose icon turns into a big silver Eject key as you drag), 
highlighting it and pressing 
-E (the shortcut for File
Eject), or Control-clicking it and choosing Eject from the 
contextual menu. (You've still got the original .dmg file you downloaded, so you're not really saying goodbye to the 
disk image forever.)
Downloading a new program from the Internet may strew your desktop with icons. After the 
installation is complete, you can delete all of them. (But keep the .dmg file if you think you 
might want to install the software again later.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-10.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:50:01 AM

4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
 
NOTE
In 2003, Apple introduced a new kind of disk images called Internet-enabled disk images. When you 
download one, the .dmg file automatically copies its contents onto your desktop and then auto-Trashes itself. 
You might never know that you downloaded a disk image; it's as though you just downloaded a bunch of files.
If you don't see all of the left-over detritus illustrated in Figure 4-19 after downloading a disk image, now 
you'll know why; you just got lucky.
4.10.3 Cleaning Up after Decompression
When the StuffIt Expander progress-bar dialog box disappears, you may have several icons on your desktop. Some are 
useful; some you're free to trash.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-10.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:50:01 AM

4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
G     The original compressed file. It's safe to throw away the .sit, .tar, .gz, or .tgz file you originally downloaded (after 
it's decompressed, of course).
If you get tired of cleaning up after your downloads this way, you can tell StuffIt Expander to 
delete the pieces automatically. To do so, double-click the StuffIt Expander icon (in 
Applications
Utilities). From the StuffIt Expander menu, choose Preferences. Turn on 
both "Delete after expanding" checkboxes, and then click OK.
G     The .dmg file. Once you've turned it into an actual disk-drive icon, installed the software from it, and "ejected" the 
disk-drive icon, you can delete the .dmg file. Keep it only if you think you might need to reinstall the software 
someday.
NOTE
If you try to trash the .dmg file before removing the disk-drive icon from the screen, you'll get a "file in use" 
error message when you try to empty the Trash.
G     The disk image itself. This final icon, the one that contains the actual software or its installer (third from top in 
Figure 4-19), doesn't exist as a file on your hard drive. It's a phantom drive, held in memory, that will go away by 
itself when you log out. So after installing its software, feel free to drag it to the Trash (or highlight it and press 
-
E to "eject" it).
4.10.4 Performing the Installation
Working with .tar, .gz, and .dmg files are all skills unique to downloading Mac OS X programs from the Internet. Installing 
software from a CD is much more straight-forward.
In either case, once you've got a disk icon on your desktop (either a pseudo-disk from a disk image or a CD you've 
inserted), you're ready to install the software. You can install many Mac OS X programs just by dragging their icons or 
folders to your hard drive. Others offer a traditional installer program that requires you to double-click, read, and accept a 
license agreement, and so on.
In both cases, where you decide to install the new program is suddenly a big issue. You have the following two alternatives:
G     In the Applications folder. Most programs, of course, sit in your Applications folder. Most of the time, this is where 
you'll want to install new programs. Putting them in the Applications folder makes it available to anyone who uses 
the Mac.
NOTE
You can't put anything in your Applications folder unless you have an Administrator account, as described in 
Section 11.2.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-4-SECT-10.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:50:01 AM

4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
G     In your Home folder. Suppose you share your Mac with other people, as described in Chapter 11. If that's your 
situation, you may occasionally want to install aprogram privately, reserving it for your own use only. In that case, 
just install or drag it into your Home folder, or a folder inside it. When other people log onto the machine, they won't 
even know that you've installed that new program, since it doesn't show up in the Applications folder.
UP TO SPEED
The Color Picker
Here and there—in System Preferences, TextEdit, Microsoft Office, and many other programs—Mac OS X 
offers you the opportunity to choose a color for some element: for your desktop background, a window, and 
so on.
The dialog box that appears offers a miniature color lab that lets you dial in any color in the Mac's rainbow. 
Several color labs, actually, arrayed across the top, each designed to make color-choosing easier in certain 
circumstances:
Color Wheel. Drag the scroll bar vertically to adjust the brightness, and then drag your cursor around the ball 
to pick the shade.
Color Sliders. From the pop-up menu, choose the color-mixing method you prefer. CMYK stands for cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black. People in the printing industry will feel immediately at home, because these four 
colors are the component inks for color printing. (These people may also be able to explain why K stands for 
black)
RGB is how a TV or computer monitor thinks of colors: as proportions of red, green, and blue. And HSB 
stands for Hue, Saturation, and Brightness—a favorite color-specifying scheme in scientific circles.
In each case, just drag the sliders to mix up the color you want, or type in the percentages of each component.
Color Palettes presents canned sets of color swatches. They're primarily for programmers who want quick 
access to the standard colors in Mac OS X. (The Web Safe Colors list is useful for Web designers, too; they 
can tell whether a color will display properly on other computers.)
Image Palettes offers the visible rainbow arrayed yet another way: in cloudy, color-arranged streaks. (Cool 
tip: If you drag a graphics file directly into the dialog box, it will appear in the spectrum's place. That's a handy 
trick if you're trying to identify the color of a certain spot of an image, for example. And don't miss the pop-up 
button at the bottom of the dialog box, which offers a few other stunts).
Crayons. Now this is a good user interface. You can click each crayon to see its color name: "Mocha," "Fern," 
"Cayenne," and so on. (Some interior decorator in Cupertino had a field day naming these crayons.)
In any of these color pickers, you can also "sample" a color that's outside the dialog box—a color you found 
on a Web page, for example. Just click the magnifying-glass icon and then move your cursor around the 
screen. You'll see the sliders and numbers change inside the dialog box automatically when you click.
Finally, note that you can store frequently used (or frequently admired) colors in the mini-palette squares at 
the bottom. To do that, drag the big rectangular color swatch (next to the magnifying glass) directly down into 
one of the little squares, where it will stay fresh for weeks.

4.10 Installing Mac OS X Programs
If you don't have space for all the colors you want at the bottom of the window, you can drag the small circular 
dot down to make room for more.
 
If you don't have an Administrator account, in fact, this is your only option for installing new programs.
4.10.5 Uninstalling Software
In Mac OS X, there's no Add/Remove Programs window. If the program you want to trash came with an Uninstall program, 
by all means use it. If not, to uninstall a program, just drag it (or its folder) from the Applications folder (or wherever it is), to 
the Trash.
Some programs also leave harmless scraps of themselves behind; to check for them, look for preference files or folders 
bearing the dearly departed program's name in your Library folders and your Home
Library
Preferences folder.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Submitting to Apple
What the—I was working along in Microsoft Word, and all of a sudden it just vanished! Poof! And all I got was 
this lousy dialog box about "submitting to Apple." What's going on? 
Apple is trying to assimilate you.
Or, more accurately, it's trying to enlist your help in ferreting out all the little glitches that makes modern 
computing so much fun. If you're willing to click the Submit Report button and type a few comments ("I was 
just running Word, minding my own business, and when I clicked the Print toolbar button, the whole thing just 
crashed"), then Apple will add your report to the thousands flowing in from everyone else.
The idea, which Apple borrowed from Windows and added to Panther, is that when its programmers get a 
moment, they'll study these reports, track down the patterns ("Hm, we've received 50,000 reports about that 
Print button in Word"), and then accost the software company responsible—and, presumably, get a fix under 
way.
The report you submit is full of technical info that help the programmers figure out what was happening at the 
time of the crash, but no personal information goes along for the ride. So if you feel like doing some good for 
your fellow Mac fans, by all means submit the report (via the Internet) whenever you're offered the chance.

Chapter 5. Back to Mac OS 9
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Chapter 5. Back to Mac OS 9
If only we could move into Mac OS X and live there! Unfortunately, software makes the world go 'round, and it'll be a long 
time before every program you'd ever want to use has been written or rewritten for Mac OS X. 
That doesn't mean you can't use them at all, though. You can certainly run your old favorites within Mac OS X—by flipping 
back into Mac OS 9. There are two ways you can do that, as described in this chapter.
The bad news is that now you've got two different operating systems to learn. The landscape, features, and locations of 
favorite commands differ in each one.
If you've got the old Mac OS in your blood, you're way ahead of the game. But if you're new to the Mac, you can easily get 
confused. You may see a shiny blue 
 menu one moment, and a striped one with completely different commands the 
next, as the machine flips back and forth between the two OSes.
There's no solution to this dilemma except to wait until every program you'd ever want to use is available in a Mac OS X 
version. Fortunately, most of the biggies are already available for Mac OS X. The sooner you can stop using the Mac OS 9 
tricks described in this chapter, the better.

5.1 Two Roads to Mac OS 9
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
5.1 Two Roads to Mac OS 9
You can return to Mac OS 9 in either of two ways. Here's a summary that outlines the pros and cons of each method:
G     Run Classic. The program called Classic is one of the crowning achievements of Mac OS X. You can think of it as 
a Mac OS 9 simulator or emulator. It runs automatically whenever you double-click the icon of a pre-Mac OS X 
program.
At that point, the Classic (Mac OS 9) world takes over your screen, looking exactly as though the old Mac OS 9 you 
used to know (or not know) is starting up. There's the old startup logo, the parade of extensions across the screen, 
your old 
 menu, the non-striped menu bar, and so on. Once it's running, you can run almost all of your older 
Mac OS 9 programs without a hitch.
Classic is the reason Apple recommends that you install Mac OS X only on Macs with at least 128 MB of memory. 
When you run it, your Mac is running two operating systems at once, which requires quite a bit of memory.
For most people, most of the time, Classic is the easiest, quickest, and most effective way to run older Mac 
programs.
NOTE
Classic requires Mac OS 9.1 or later. The most recent version, 9.2.2, is best.
G     Restart the Mac in Mac OS 9. Unfortunately, Classic is only a simulator. It isn't your operating system at the time—
it isn't actually controlling your Mac. Mac OS X continues to run beneath it.
When a certain Mac OS 9 program "reaches for" a particular piece of circuitry on your Mac, such as the FireWire or 
USB jack, it may come up empty-handed. That's why many scanners, digitizing tablets, and even printers don't 
work when you run programs in the Classic mode.
Fortunately—depending on the age of your Mac—you may also be able to restart your Mac in Mac OS 9, just as 
though you don't have Mac OS X installed at all. At this point, you've got just a regular Mac OS 9 machine, and all 
of that older gear works just as it always did. Of course, you don't get any of the benefits of Mac OS X, such as its 
stability and multitasking prowess.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Where to Get Mac OS 9
Hey, I just bought Mac OS X 10.3, and it doesn't come with a Mac OS 9 CD! Where am I supposed to get a 
copy of Mac OS 9? 
If you bought your Mac within the last several years, you already have a copy of Mac OS 9, right on the hard 
drive. Thanks to the software downloads page of Apple's Web site, you can update any version of Mac OS 9 
to the very latest version (9.2.2).
Even if you bought your Mac today, you, too, have a copy of Mac OS 9. It's the folder called System Folder in 
your main hard drive window. (Don't confuse the folder called System Folder with the folder just called 
System, which is your Mac OS X folder.)
In short, you're completely out of luck only if you have an old Mac that's still running Mac OS 8.5 or 8.6. And 
for you, Apple has a special offer: $20 buys you a copy of Mac OS 9. (You must prove your worthiness by 
sending Apple a copy of your Mac OS X receipt.) Details are on Apple's Web site.

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
If you still harbor the notion, propagated by certain old Mac books, that it's bad form to have two System folders on the 
same hard drive, welcome to the 21st century. When you use Mac OS X, it's not only a good idea to have two System 
folders, it's almost a requirement. You should have one copy of Mac OS X, and at least one copy of Mac OS 9. (Appendix A 
describes various ways to set all this up.)
It's easy to spot the Mac OS 9 System folder on your drive, as shown in Figure 5-1.
When you're running Mac OS X, the System Folder that contains Mac OS 9 is clearly marked by 
the golden 9. Only one System Folder per disk may bear this logo, which indicates that it's the 
only one officially recognized by the Mac. (As the programmers say, it's the "blessed" System 
Folder.)
 
5.2.1 How to Start Classic
You can start up your Classic program in any of several ways.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (1 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
5.2.1.1 Double-click a Mac OS 9 program
The most common method of launching Classic is simply double-clicking the icon of a pre-Mac OS X program. Your Mac 
concludes: "Well, this program won't run in Mac OS X, so I'll just go ahead and launch your Mac OS 9 simulator."
At this point, several things happen. The very first time you ever run Classic, you may see a message that says, "Classic 
needs to update resources in your selected Classic system folder." Mac OS X is telling you that your Mac OS 9 System 
Folder requires a couple of extensions and other system files (listed later this chapter) in order to run within Mac OS X, and 
that it's offering to put them in the right place. Click OK.
Now a progress bar appears in a floating window, as shown in Figure 5-2. Classic takes about 15 seconds to start up, 
depending on your machine. (You can cut that time in half using the tricks described in the following pages.) 
During the startup process, you'll see a little Classic (numeral 9) icon in your Dock, just to help you understand what's going 
on.
If you haven't got the time to wait, or you suddenly change your mind, you can cancel the 
Classic startup process by clicking the Stop button. In the confirmation box, click Stop 
Classic. You return to the desktop, no harm done.
And if you find Classic launching fairly often when you don't really want to bother, try this. 
Open System Preferences (Chapter 8), click the Classic icon, and turn on "Warn before 
starting Classic." Now, whenever you try to open a Mac OS 9 program, accidentally or not, 
Mac OS X will ask for your OK before firing up Classic.
When all the bouncing stops, you'll see a number of changes onscreen. Your Apple menu is now rainbow-striped, as it was 
in the days before Mac OS X, and it lists whatever programs, documents, and other icons you've put there. The menu bar is 
light gray, its fonts are smaller, and its menus and commands are different. In short, you've now gone back in time to Mac 
OS 9.
Top: Starting up Classic involves waiting for the progress bar to fill up.
Bottom: If you click the flippy triangle below the progress bar, you summon what looks like the 
full screen of a Macintosh floating within your own Mac's monitor, displaying the standard 
extensions and control panel icons, the Mac OS 9 logo, and other landmarks of the traditional 
Mac OS 9 startup process. (The title bar identifies which Mac OS 9 System Folder you're 
starting up from.)

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
 
NOTE
As an entire operating system, Mac OS 9 could well be the subject of an entire book unto itself—like Mac OS 
9: The Missing Manual. The rest of this book assumes that you either know Mac OS 9 already or have a 
good source of information to help you with it.
5.2.1.2 Launch it manually
You can also start up Classic manually, although you'll rarely have much need to do so. The master control panel for 
controlling Classic is in System Preferences, and it works like this:
1.  Open System Preferences. 
You can choose 
 Preferences, or click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (3 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
2.  Click the Classic icon. 
Now the Classic preference panel appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
At this point, you'll see a list of every disk (or disk partition) that contains a Mac OS 9 System Folder, also shown in 
Figure 5-3. If you expand the flippy triangle next to a disk's name, you'll see a list of the Mac OS 9 System Folders. 
Any one of them can serve as the System Folder that runs when you enter the world of Classic.
Make sure the correct one is selected; more on this topic later in this chapter.
This preference panel lets you specify which Mac OS 9 System Folder takes over when 
you launch the Classic mode. If you point to a System Folder without clicking, a square 
balloon appears to identify its name, location, and system version.
 
3.  To start Classic manually, click Start. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (4 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
Water appears to flow into the progress bar, exactly as shown in Figure 5-2. (If the Start button is dimmed, check 
the boldface message above the list of disks. It may be that Classic is already running.)
You can also add the icon of Classic to your Dock, creating a quick and easy way to launch it 
without having to burrow into System Preferences. Open your 
System
Library
CoreServices folder. Inside this folder, you'll find an icon called 
Classic Startup. Drag it onto the Dock, where it will remain for easy access.
In fact, you can even add a little Classic menulet to your menu bar, complete with Start and 
Stop commands. Instructions are in (Section 3.6).
5.2.1.3 Open Classic from the Menulet
If you've installed the Classic menulet described in (Section 3.6), you can simply choose Start Classic from your menu bar.
5.2.1.4 Start up Classic automatically
If you find yourself using Classic every day, you'll have by far the best time with Mac OS X if you instruct it to start up 
Classic automatically when the computer turns on (or, if you share your Mac with others, when you log in).
It's true that your Mac will now take longer to start up each day as it loads first one operating system (Mac OS X), and then 
another (Mac OS 9). But you won't care. You'll be reading the paper and drinking coffee. And when you do need to run a 
Mac OS 9 program, you won't have to wait while Classic starts up; the environment will already be waiting for you.
Instructing Classic to start up automatically is extremely easy. Follow steps 1 and 2 in the preceding instructions—but at 
step 3, turn on "Start Classic when you log in." (To make the process even less intrusive, also turn on "Hide Classic while 
starting.") Close the System Preferences window.
From now on, Classic will automatically launch when you turn on, or log into, your Mac.
5.2.2 What to Expect from Classic
Once Classic is running, you're free to use the Mac OS 9 program you originally double-clicked—or any other Mac OS 9 
programs, for that matter. You'll probably find, in fact, that Mac OS 9 programs launch even faster in Classic than they 
would on an actual Mac OS 9 computer.
Remember, you're running two operating systems simultaneously. Yet you can freely flip back and forth between Mac OS 9 
and Mac OS X: When you click a Mac OS X program's icon on the Dock (or click inside a Mac OS X program's window), 
you bring forward both that program and Mac OS X. When you double-click a Mac OS 9 program's Dock icon (or click 
inside a Mac OS 9 program's window), you bring forward both that program and Mac OS 9. You can copy and paste 
information between the programs running in these two worlds—or even drag-and-drop highlighted material, exactly as 
described in Chapter 6.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (5 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
You'll soon discover that the icons of open Mac OS 9 programs appear on the Dock, just like Mac OS X programs. (Well, 
maybe not exactly like them; see Figure 5-4.)
Most pre-Mac OS X programs exhibit ragged icons on the Dock—a side effect of being enlarged 
to Mac OS X size. There are some exceptions: For example, Microsoft knew about Mac OS X in 
time to design Mac OS X-style icons for Office 2001.
 
It's important to note, however, that Mac OS 9 is no more stable now than it ever was. It doesn't offer Mac OS X's memory 
protection and other goodies. One buggy program can still freeze or crash the entire Classic bubble. At that point, you may 
have to exit the entire Mac OS 9 portion of your machine, losing unsaved changes in any of your Mac OS 9 programs, just 
as though it were a Mac OS 9 machine that had locked up. 
On the other hand, even when your Classic world goes down, you won't have to restart the actual computer. Mac OS X 
soldiers on, unaffected, and all your Mac OS X programs remain safe, open, and running.
5.2.3 Getting Out of Classic
Because Classic is a genuine Mac OS X program, it doesn't consume any memory or horsepower to speak of when it's in 
the background—especially if you turn on "Put Classic to sleep when it is inactive" (on the Advanced tab of the Classic 
panel of System Preferences). You may as well leave it open so that you won't have to wait for the startup process the next 
time you use a Mac OS 9 program.
In fact, Classic doesn't even distract you by putting its icon on the Dock. Apple's idea was that you shouldn't really care 
whether a program is running in Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X. All application icons—whether in Classic or not—show up on the 
Dock as equals. Clicking one switches to it, whether in Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X.
There are a few situations in which you might want to quit Classic manually, however. For example, you might want to close 
it following a system crash or lockup within Classic. Or you might want to restart Classic after making changes to its 
extensions, control panels, drivers, or other System Folder elements.
You can exit Classic in any of several ways:
G     In the System Preferences panel shown in Figure 5-3, click Stop or Restart. The Mac invites you to save the 
changes to any open documents, if necessary.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (6 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
G     If you've installed the Classic menulet (Section 3.6), just choose Stop Classic from your menu bar.
G     If your Classic environment has frozen or crashed, you may have to force quit your Classic program—that is, shut it 
down with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. You lose any unsaved changes in any Classic programs, but at least 
you escape the freeze or crash.
You can force quit Classic just as you would any program (Section 4.1.3). You can also click Force Quit in the 
System Preferences window shown in Figure 5-3.
5.2.4 Specifying a Classic System Folder
Classic doesn't operate at all unless there's a Mac OS 9 System Folder somewhere on your Mac.
On the other hand, it's perfectly legal, in the world of Mac OS X, to have more than one Mac OS 9 System Folder on board
—and many people do. You may want to designate one of them exclusively for use in Classic. (You might want to use a 
second one for dual booting, as described at the end of this chapter.) Note, however, that for Classic purposes, each Mac 
OS 9 System Folder must sit on a different disk or disk partition (see Appendix A).
When following the instructions on the previous page, therefore, choose carefully. The System Folder you select here 
affects how much time it takes Classic to start up, which extensions and control panels it has (and therefore how stable it 
is), what preference settings apply in various programs, what Web-browser bookmarks are available, and so on.
5.2.5 Controlling Classic Startup
If you're smart or lucky, you'll eventually eliminate the Classic startup delay altogether. For example, you can set up Classic 
so that it opens automatically at startup or login. Or maybe you'll get into the habit of never shutting down your computer at 
all, allowing it simply to sleep when not in use, so that Classic remains running essentially forever. Or you may eventually 
move almost all your operations into Mac OS X programs, rendering Classic obsolete—the dream of everyone who uses 
Mac OS X.
But if you open—and wait for—Classic every day, you might find it valuable to shave down the amount of time it takes to get 
going. The best way is to turn off as many extensions and control panels as possible. That's just one of the ways you can 
control the Classic startup process, as described in the following section.
5.2.5.1 Summoning Extensions Manager
By the time Mac OS X arrived on the scene, the System Folder of its predecessor, Mac OS 9, was caked solid with 
extensions and control panels (self-launching software that loads into memory at startup time). Each controls some function 
of the Mac, but taken together, they account for much of the standard Mac OS 9's propensity to freeze, crash, and 
otherwise act up.
Within the Classic world, you don't need many of these extensions anymore. Remember that Classic is a workaround, not 
your main operating system. Mac OS X now duplicates many of its functions in a much superior way. Turning off as many 
Mac OS 9 extensions as possible, therefore, makes using your Classic environment a much smoother and more stable 
experience—and accelerates Classic's startup process.
The key to controlling which extensions load is to press and hold the Space bar just after the progress bar begins filling up, 
as shown in Figure 5-5. Release the Space bar only after you see the appearance of the Extensions Manager window.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (7 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
If you can't seem to get the hang of the timing, then open the Classic panel of System 
Preferences, click the Advanced tab, and, from the first pop-up menu, choose Open 
Extensions Manager. The Extensions Manager window will open automatically the next time 
Classic starts.
Pressing the Space bar while Classic is starting up opens Extensions Manager, just as though 
you pressed Space while starting up a Mac OS 9 computer. (If you own the now-discontinued 
Conflict Catcher 9—a commercial replacement for Extensions Manager with many more features
—you'll see its screen appear here instead.)
 
Extensions Manager lets you turn certain Mac OS 9 extensions or control panels on and off. One of its most useful features 
is its ability to create canned sets that permit you to switch among sets of preselected extension combinations with a single 
click. Use the Selected Set pop-up menu at the top to switch among them.
To set up your winnowed-down extension set, click Duplicate Set in the lower-right corner of the window. In the dialog box 
that appears, type a name for the set you're about to create (such as Classic Speedy Startup), and then click OK.
5.2.5.2 Extensions and control panels to turn off
Now you're ready to start paring down the extensions and control panels that delay Classic's startup process (and make it 
so prone to crashes). Depending on what functions you need to use in Classic, you might consider turning off the 
extensions and control panels in these function categories (by clicking their checkboxes so that the X no longer appears):
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-2.html (8 of 12)5/3/2004 4:52:14 AM

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
G     Control Panels. Many of Mac OS 9's control panel functions are superseded by new panels in the Mac OS X 
System Preferences (see Chapter 8). Changing your mouse speed using Mac OS 9's Mouse control panel, for 
example, doesn't have much meaning if you've already set your mouse speed in Mac OS X.
Therefore, you should turn off the following control panels immediately, since they don't work in Classic and gain 
you nothing: Control Strip, Energy Saver, File Sharing, Infrared, Location Manager, Modem, Monitors, Mouse, 
Multiple Users, Password Security, PowerBook SCSI Disk Mode, Remote Access, Software Update, TCP/IP, 
Trackpad, and Web Sharing.
NOTE
These Mac OS 9 control panels work, albeit with limited functions, within Classic: Appearance, AppleTalk, 
Date & Time (for menu-bar clock control only), General Controls (some commands, like Show Desktop, are 
dimmed), Keyboard (duplicated functions are dimmed), Memory (Disk Cache only), Monitors, and Sound (for 
alert sounds only).
G     Internet. If you've moved your Web-surfing, email, and remote dial-in operations over to Mac OS X, you may have 
little need for the equivalent functions in the Classic environment.
If that's the case, you can safely turn off DialAssist, Internet, Location Manager Extension, Apple Modem Tool, 
Internet V.90 Modem (and other modem names, such as PowerBook Modem), the LDAP extensions, NBP Plugin, 
NetSprocketLib, Remote Only, and ShareWay IP Personal Bgnd, in addition to the control panels listed above. You 
may as well turn off the Software Update extensions, too, since they rely on Internet access.
G     Networking, Multi-User features. Most of Mac OS X's networking and Mac- sharing features far outshine those in 
Mac OS 9. So if you won't be connecting to other computers on your office network from within Classic, you may as 
well turn off AppleTalk, any AirPort extensions, Keychain Access, IrDA Tool and IrDALib, Apple Enet, Apple Enet 
DLPI Support, AppleShare, EnetShimLib, File Sharing Extension, File Sharing Library, Multi-User Startup, OpenTpt 
Remote Access, Network Setup Extension, and SLPPlugin.
G     Printing. If you don't plan to print from within Classic programs, you can turn off anything containing the words 
Print, Printer, Printing, or ColorSync, as well as the extensions bearing specific printer names (Color SW 1500, 
Color SW 2500, LaserWriter, and so on).
G     DVD. The old, Mac OS 9-style DVD Player program doesn't even work in Classic. Turn off everything containing 
DVD in its name.
G     Disc burning. Here again, Mac OS X does a far better job of burning CDs than Mac OS 9 does. For example, Mac 
OS X can even burn data DVDs, which hold a delightful 4.4 GB per disc. By all means, turn off the Disc Burner 
Extension.
G     Video games. A few video games require the OpenGL, QuickDraw 3D, NVIDIA, and ATI extensions. If you're a 
gamer, you'll experience the best game play by restarting your Mac in Mac OS 9 (see Section 5.3), rather than 
trying to play Mac OS 9 games in the Classic mode. If you agree, turn off all extensions that contain the words 
QuickDraw 3D, OpenGL, NVIDIA, and ATI.
G     FireWire. Even if you have a digital camcorder for use with iMovie, you may as well turn off the FireWire 
extensions, as the Mac OS X version of iMovie is better than the Mac OS 9 version. (Slower, but otherwise better.) 
Leave the FireWire extensions on only if you have FireWire gadgets like external hard drives that you want to 
access from within Mac OS 9.
Once your pruning session is complete, click Continue. You should find that the Classic mode now starts up far faster than 
before.

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
These are only suggestions. If, after turning off some of these extensions and control panels, you find that 
certain familiar Mac OS 9 functions are no longer available, exit Classic, restart it with the Space bar pressed 
again, and experiment with restoring some of the things you turned off. And if you don't have the time to 
fiddle with individual extension settings, you can always turn on the entire Apple-authorized original set by 
choosing Mac OS 9 All (or Mac OS 9.2.2 All, or whatever) from the Selected Set pop-up menu.
5.2.5.3 Extensions to leave on
You can't go totally hog-wild turning off System Folder elements. Classic expects to find certain System Folder items when 
it launches. If you turn them off, an error message will explain that "Some Classic-specific resources need to be added to or 
updated in your System Folder on [Disk Name]." If you click OK, Mac OS X copies them into the Mac OS 9 System Folder. 
Here's a list, current as of Mac OS 9.2.2:
G     Control Panels: General, Startup Disk
G     Extensions: Apple Guide, CarbonLib, Classic RAVE, Open Transport, Open Transport ASLM Modules
G     Loose in the System Folder: Classic Support, Classic Support UI, ProxyApp 
5.2.5.4 "Holding down" keys during startup
On a Mac OS 9 machine, holding down certain keys during the startup process triggers certain utility functions. Pressing 
Shift, for example, turns off all extensions and control panels. Holding down Option and 
 eventually rebuilds the desktop 
database file, a Mac OS 9 troubleshooting technique that can cure general slowdowns as well as the "generic," blank-icon 
problem.
As Classic is starting up, these keystrokes work exactly as they do when a Mac OS 9 Mac is starting up. That is, if you 
press Shift immediately after the Classic progress bar appears onscreen, you'll see the usual "Extensions Off " message in 
the middle of the simulated Mac OS 9 startup screen. Similarly, if you hold down the Option and 
 keys as the extension-
loading process comes to an end, you'll eventually be offered the opportunity to rebuild the desktop. (Well, sort of...after 
Classic has finished loading, click the blank-document icon that appears in your Dock with the name Classic Support UI, to 
bring forward the "Are you sure you want to rebuild the desktop?" dialog box.)
Still, Apple's engineers worried that you might find it difficult to gauge when the right moment is to hold down these various 
startup keys, so they offer you an alternative method of "holding them down."
To see it, open the Advanced tab of the Classic preference panel (see Figure 5-6).
On this tab, you'll find a pop-up menu that helps you control the startup process. The options are as follows:
G     Turn Off Extensions. If you choose this command and then click the Start Classic (or Restart Classic) button next 
to it, you launch the Classic emulator with all extensions turned off, just as though you had held down the Shift key 
during its startup.
G     Open Extensions Manager. If you choose this command and then click Start Classic (or Restart Classic), the Mac 
behaves as though you had pressed the Space bar while Classic was starting up. As a result, the Extensions 
Manager window opens, just as described in Section 5.2.5.1.
G     Use Key Combination. This option is designed to accommodate all other startup keys, such as those available in 
Conflict Catcher, a now-discontinued extensions manager. Start by clicking in the <enter up to five keys> box. Now 
you can press up to five different keys (one at a time, please) that the Mac will "hold down" when you start Classic 
by clicking the Start Classic (or Restart Classic) button in this dialog box. As you press the keys, you'll see them 
recorded in the text box.

5.2 Classic: Mac OS 9 on Mac OS X
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Two Systems, One Preference
Having to live in two worlds—Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X—is not an especially popular situation. In fact, it can 
be a real pain.
Fortunately, Mac OS X takes a baby step toward simplifying things. Now, at least, programs that run in both 
Mac OS X and Classic can maintain a single set of preference files. Now your serial numbers, window 
positions, palette setups, and other settings will be remembered as you move between worlds.
To view this option, open the Classic panel of System Preferences. Click the Advanced tab, and then turn on 
"Use Mac OS 9 preferences from your home."
From now on, any programs that can run in either 9 or X will use a consistent set of preference files—the ones 
in your Home
Library
Preferences folder, rather than the Preferences folder in your Classic System 
Folder. (Such programs include Photoshop 7, AppleWorks, and so on, along with system-wide features like 
QuickTime preferences, Internet preferences, modem preferences, and so on.)
None of this means that these programs will use the same preference files when you restart in Mac OS 9—
only when you run them in the Classic environment.
Note that whatever option you choose from the pop-up menu will apply only to the next Classic startup you trigger from 
within this dialog box. These options don't affect Classic when you start it up in any of the usual ways.
There's no need to press Option-
 when Classic is starting up if you want to rebuild the 
Desktop file. The Rebuild Desktop button in this dialog box does the trick automatically, 
without making you launch Classic at all.
The Advanced tab of the Classic panel lets you specify which keys you want "held down" for 
you as Classic starts up. It also lets you specify when Classic can sleep—that is, to slip down 
into virtual memory, returning the RAM (and processor attention) it was claiming to the general 
pool. Once it's sleeping, Classic takes slightly longer to open programs—but not nearly as long 
as when it first started up.

5.3 Restarting in Mac OS 9
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
5.3 Restarting in Mac OS 9
Unfortunately, Classic can get you only so far. Sure enough, it fakes out your older software fairly well—but your Mac is not 
actually running Mac OS 9. Anytime a piece of software tries to communicate with some physical component of your Mac, 
such the SCSI, USB, FireWire, or serial ports, it will bruise its knuckles on the stainless-steel dome of Mac OS X, which is 
really in charge of your ports. That's why a lot of older add-on equipment, including USB-to-serial adapters, certain printers, 
SCSI cards, scanners, and so on may not run properly in the Classic environment.
What this kind of equipment really needs, of course, is Mac OS X-specific driver software. If drivers exist (check the 
manufacturer's Web site), you can once again use your gear.
Otherwise, you have only one alternative when you want your external gadgets to work properly with your Mac, just the way 
they did when it ran Mac OS 9: Restart the Mac in Mac OS 9.
At that point, you've returned to complete compatibility with all your old gadgets and all your old programs. When you're 
finished, you can restart the Mac again, this time with Mac OS X "in charge." This ability to switch back and forth between 
two radically different operating systems on the same computer is called dual booting. 
The chief caveat here is that only Mac models introduced before January 2003 even offer this feature. Subsequent models
—the 12-inch PowerBook G4, the Power Mac G5, and so on—can't dual boot; they're all Mac OS X, all the time. That's 
Apple's way of encouraging hardware and software makers to hurry up and develop X-compatible gadgets—but it's had the 
perverse effect of boosting the price of older, used Macs that still offer this desirable option.
5.3.1 Dual Booting the Long Way
The key to switching back and forth between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X is the Startup Disk control panel (or System 
Preferences panel).
5.3.1.1 Switching from X to 9
Suppose you're running Mac OS X, and you need to duck back into Mac OS 9 to use, say, your scanner. The routine goes 
like this.
1.  Open System Preferences. 
As always, you can do it by clicking the System Preferences icon on the Dock or by choosing 
System 
Preferences. The System Preferences screen appears.
2.  Click Startup Disk. 
You now see the panel shown at top in Figure 5-7. The icons here represent the various System folders, both Mac 
OS 9 and Mac OS X flavors, that your Mac has found on all disks currently attached to your Mac.
3.  Click the Mac OS 9 System Folder you want to be in charge, and then click Restart. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-3.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:52:19 AM

5.3 Restarting in Mac OS 9
The Mac asks you: "Are you sure you want to set the Startup disk and restart the computer?"
4.  Click "Save and Restart" (or press Enter). 
When your Mac restarts, you'll feel like it's 1999 all over again. There go the parade of extension icons, the Mac OS 
9 logo, and all the other trappings of the traditional, pre-Mac OS X startup process. You're now fully back in Mac 
OS 9, ready to use all your old add-on equipment and software (but without the benefit of Mac OS X's stability, 
good looks, and other features).
5.3.1.2 Switching from 9 to X: The Long Way
The officially prescribed method of returning to Mac OS X is very similar.
1.  Choose 
Control Panels
Startup Disk. 
The Startup Disk control panel appears, as shown at bottom in Figure 5-7. Click the flippy triangle next to a disk's 
name, if necessary, to see the list of System folders on it.
2.  Click the specific Mac OS X System folder you want to be in charge, and then click Restart. 
Mac OS X starts up.
If you're running Mac OS X, you can indicate that you'd like Mac OS 9 to seize control at 
the next startup by using the Startup Disk system preference panel. If you're having 
trouble telling the System Folders apart (because, after all, System Preferences reveals 
only their System versions and disk names, not their folder names), point to the folder 
icon until the identifying yellow balloon appears. Bottom: If you're running Mac OS 9, use 
the Startup Disk control panel to specify that you want Mac OS X to be in charge at the 
next startup.

5.4 Three Tricks for Faster Switching
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
5.4 Three Tricks for Faster Switching
It didn't take long for the masses of Mac fans to grow impatient with fiddling around with System Preferences and control 
panels just to go back and forth between 9 and X.
Here are four ways to reduce the number of steps.
5.4.1 The X Key Trick (From 9 to X)
If you have both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X installed on the same hard drive or disk partition, use this sensational shortcut: 
Just hold down the letter X key while the Mac is starting up. (Hold it down until the Mac stops chiming.) You'll go straight to 
Mac OS X.
5.4.2 The D Key Trick (From X to 9)
The only downside to the X key trick is that it's one-way. You can't, for example, hold down the 9 key to start up in Mac OS 
9 again—at least not if 9 and X are on the same drive.
If you've installed 9 and X on two different drives or partitions, though, you can enjoy the D key trick. It works in either of 
these two situations:
G     You have two hard drives. You've installed Mac OS 9 on the internal hard drive, and Mac OS X on an external.
G     You have one hard drive, but you've partitioned it (divided it into two or more "virtual disks," each with its own icon). 
You'll find instructions for setting up multiple partitions—and installing different operating system versions on them
—in Appendix A.
But here's the key point: You've installed Mac OS 9 on the first partition.
Once you've arranged things like this, leave your System Preferences set so that Mac OS X is the startup disk, as 
described earlier. But on those occasions when you want to duck back into Mac OS 9, hold down the D key just after the 
startup chime (when turning on or restarting the machine). The Mac starts up in Mac OS 9.
To return to Mac OS X, just don't do anything. Restart the machine without holding down any keys at all.
As it turns out, the D key tells the Mac to start up from the first internal disk or partition that contains a working System 
Folder of any type. If it's a Mac OS 9 partition, that's what you get.
5.4.3 The Option Key Trick
This trick may be the easiest and friendliest of all. It's a single keystroke that lets you decide, each time the computer turns 
on, which operating system version you want to run it. This method lets you postpone making the decision until the moment 
you actually turn the thing on, instead of having to make the switch after the computer has already started up.
This technique, too, works only if you've installed Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X on different disks or different partitions of a 
single disk. And it doesn't work on the oldest Mac OS X-compatible machines, like blue-and-white Power Mac G3 models.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-4.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:52:22 AM

5.4 Three Tricks for Faster Switching
Now you're ready. Turn on the Mac. Just as it's lighting up, hold down the Option key. Hold it down until you see the display 
illustrated in Figure 5-8. 
This screen, known inside Apple as the Startup Manager, offers icons for every disk, CD, or partition containing a working 
System folder (either Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X). Just click the one you want to start up the Mac and then click the "continue" 
button. Without missing a beat, your Mac continues to start up using the operating system you selected.
Clearly, this technique requires a bit of preparation and planning—not just because it requires different disks or partitions, 
but also because it limits you to having one System folder on each. The display shown in Figure 5-8 offers a list of startup 
disks, not System folders. (The Startup Disk method described earlier, by contrast, lets you choose from among several 
System folders on the same disk.)
Still, if you find that switching between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X is a daily feature of your work routine, you may decide to 
bite the bullet and partition your hard drive (or buy a second, external one) just to realize the convenience of this switching-
at-startup feature.
This display, known as the Startup Manager, appears when you press Option during startup. It 
displays all the disk icons, or disk partitions, that contain working System folders. Just click 
the icon you want and then click the arrow button at the lower right.
 
5.4.4 Separate System Folders for Classic and Rebooting
If you've really thought this through, it may have dawned on you that the ideal Mac OS 9 System Folder for use in Classic 
makes a lousy System Folder for restarting your Mac, and vice versa.
The Mac OS 9 System Folder you want for Classic is a slimmed-down, streamlined System Folder with as few extensions 
and drivers as possible. Here, your aim is to make Mac OS 9 launch as quickly as possible. When you restart the Mac in 
Mac OS 9, on the other hand, you want maximum compatibility. You want all your Mac's features intact, especially the 
drivers that will operate your external equipment.
5.4.4.1 Maintaining a single Mac OS 9 System Folder
You can maintain a single Mac OS 9 System Folder on your Mac, of course. You can simply use Extensions Manager (or 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-5-SECT-4.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 4:52:22 AM

5.4 Three Tricks for Faster Switching
Conflict Catcher, if you still have it) to create two different sets of extensions: one for use in Classic and one for use when 
restarting the Mac. Use the Select Set pop-up menu (see Figure 5-5) to switch sets.
Obviously, this method presents one massive inconvenience: You have to remember to press the Space bar every time 
Mac OS 9 starts up (either in Classic or when dual booting) in order to summon Extensions Manager to make the switch. 
(All right, you wouldn't have to open Extensions Manager every time—only when switching the function of your Mac OS 9 
System Folder [Classic or dual booting].)
This option can work just fine if:
G     You do most of your Mac OS 9 work in Classic, and you find yourself rebooting in Mac OS 9 only occasionally, or
G     You do most of your Mac OS 9 work by restarting into Mac OS 9, and you rely on Classic only occasionally.
In other words, the only inconvenient aspect of this setup is switching the function of your single Mac OS 9 System Folder.
5.4.4.2 Maintaining two different Mac OS 9 System Folders
Some people maintain two Mac OS 9 System Folders: one that's trimmed down for use in Classic, and another that loads a 
complete set of extensions and drivers for use in restarting the Mac (Figure 5-8). This method doesn't require separate 
partitions or drives. Both System Folders—or all three, if you count the Mac OS X System folder—can sit on the same hard 
drive.
This arrangement frees you from the inconvenience of switching extension sets when switching a single System folder's 
function. But it does come with a hassle of its own: You're now maintaining duplicate sets of preference settings, Web 
bookmarks, and the like.
Suppose you bookmark a Web site when running a Classic Web browser. The next day, when you reboot into Mac OS 9, 
your Web browser no longer lists that bookmark. That's because Mac OS 9 stores its bookmark lists, like its preference 
files, inside the System Folder that's "in charge" at the time.
Fortunately, this inconvenience, too, may turn out to be a red herring, depending on your purpose in using Mac OS 9. The 
Web bookmark example really isn't a good one because, for instance, you probably wouldn't want to use any version of 
Mac OS 9 for Web browsing. (Excellent Web browsers are available right in Mac OS X.) In real life, most people reboot into 
Mac OS 9 only for special purposes like using an old CD burner or scanner that doesn't work in Mac OS X or Classic. In 
these cases, the fact that each Mac OS 9 System Folder is maintaining a duplicate set of preference files will probably have 
little impact on your life, if you even notice it at all.

Chapter 6. Moving Data
The original 1984 Mac didn't make jaws drop because of its speed, price, or sleek looks. What amazed people most was 
the simplicity and elegance of the user interface. At some point in every Apple demo, the presenter copied a graphic drawn 
in a painting program (MacPaint) and pasted it directly into a word processor (MacWrite), where it appeared neatly nestled 
between typed paragraphs of text. 
We take this example of data exchange for granted today. But in those days, that simple act struck people like a 
thunderbolt. After all, if this little computer let you copy and paste between different programs, it could probably do anything. 
Today, the Mac is even more adept at helping you move and share your hard-won data. Mac OS X offers several different 
ways to move information within a single document, between documents, between different programs, and even between 
the Mac and Windows computers. This chapter leads you through this broad range of data-exchange mechanisms.

6.1 Moving Data Between Documents
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
6.1 Moving Data Between Documents
You can't paste a picture into your Web browser, and you can't paste MIDI music information into your word processor. But 
you can put graphics into your word processor, paste movies into your database, insert text into GraphicConverter, and 
combine a surprising variety of seemingly dissimilar kinds of data. 
6.1.1 Cut, Copy, and Paste
The original copy-and-paste procedure of 1984—putting a graphic into a word processor —has come a long way. Most 
experienced Mac users have learned to trigger the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands from the keyboard, quickly and without 
even thinking. Here's how the process works: 
1.  Highlight some material in a document. 
Drag through some text in a word processor, for example, or highlight graphics, music, movie, database, and 
spreadsheet information, depending on the program you're using. 
2.  Use the Edit
Cut or Edit
Copy command. 
Or press the keyboard shortcuts 
-X (for Cut—think of the X as a pair of scissors) or 
-C (for Copy). The 
Macintosh memorizes the highlighted material, socking it away on an invisible storage pad called the Clipboard. If 
you chose Copy, nothing visible happens. If you chose Cut, the highlighted material disappears from the original 
document. 
At this point, most Mac fans take it on faith that the Cut or Copy command actually worked. But if you're in doubt, 
switch to the Finder (by clicking its Dock icon, for example), and then choose Edit
Show Clipboard. The 
Clipboard window appears, showing whatever you've copied. 
If you minimize the Clipboard window to the Dock, you'll be able to glance down to 
see what's on it at any given moment—because it's a live, self-updating Dock icon. 
3.  Click to indicate where you want the material to reappear. 
This may entail switching to a different program (even a Classic program), a different document, or simply a 
different place in the same document. 
4.  Choose the Edit
Paste command (
-V). 
The copy of the material you had originally highlighted now appears at your insertion point—if you're pasting into a 
program that can accept that kind of information. (You won't have much luck pasting, say, a movie clip into 
Quicken.)

6.1 Moving Data Between Documents
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Styled Text
When you copy text from, for example, Word X, and then paste it into another program, such as Mail, you 
may be pleasantly surprised to note that the formatting of that text—bold, italic, font, (size, color, and so on)—
appears intact in Mail. You're witnessing one of the Mac's most useful but underpublicized features: its 
support for styled text on the Clipboard.
Almost all Mac OS X-compatible programs transfer the formatting along with the copied text. Every time you 
paste formatted text copied from one of these programs, the pasted material appears with the same 
typographical characteristics it had in the original program. Over time, this tiny timesaver spares us years' 
worth of cumulative reformatting effort—yet another tiny favor the noble Macintosh does mankind.
The most recently cut or copied material remains on your Clipboard even after you paste, making it possible to paste the 
same blob repeatedly. Such a trick can be useful when, for example, you've designed a business card in your drawing 
program and want to duplicate it enough times to fill a letter-sized printout. On the other hand, whenever you next copy or 
cut something, whatever was already on the Clipboard is lost forever. 
6.1.2 Drag-and-Drop
As useful and popular as it is, the Copy/Paste routine doesn't win any awards for speed. After all, it requires four steps. In 
many cases, you can replace that routine with the far more direct (and enjoyable) drag-and-drop method. Figure 6-1 
illustrates how this works. 
NOTE
Most Cocoa programs see (Section 4.8) require you to press the mouse button for a split second before 
beginning to drag. (This delay is shorter in 10.3 than it was in 10.2, however.) 
Virtually every Mac OS X program works with the drag-and-drop technique, including TextEdit, Stickies, Mail, Sherlock, 
QuickTime Player, Preview, iMovie, iPhoto, and Apple System Profiler, not to mention commercial programs like Microsoft 
applications, America Online, and so on. 
To use drag-and-drop, highlight some material. Click in the middle of the highlighted area; 
press the mouse button for about half a second. Now, with the button still pressed, drag to 
another place in the document, into a different window, or into a different application. As your 
cursor enters the target window, a shaded outline appears inside the window's boundaries—
the Mac's way of letting you know that it understands your intention. When you release the 
mouse, the highlighted material appears instantly in its new location.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-1.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:52:28 AM

6.1 Moving Data Between Documents
 
6.1.2.1 When to use drag-and-drop 
As shown in Figure 6-1, drag-and-drop is ideal for transferring material between windows or between programs. It's 
especially useful when you've already copied something valuable to your Clipboard, since drag-and-drop doesn't involve 
(and doesn't erase) the Clipboard. 
Its most popular use, however, is rearranging text within a single document. In Word or AppleWorks, for example, you can 
rearrange entire sections, paragraphs, sentences, or even individual letters, just by dragging them—a wonderfully efficient 
editing technique. 
When you use drag-and-drop to moves text within a document, the Mac moves the 
highlighted text, deleting the highlighted material from its original location. If you press Option 
as you drag, however, you make a copy of the highlighted text. 
6.1.2.2 Using drag-and-drop to the desktop 
You can also use drag-and-drop in the one program you use every single day: the Finder itself. As shown in Figure 6-2, you 
can drag text, graphics, sounds, and even movie clips out of your document windows and directly onto the desktop. Once 
there, your dragged material generally becomes an icon called a clipping file. 
When you drag a clipping from your desktop back into an application window, the material in that clipping reappears. Drag-
and-drop, in other words, lets you treat your desktop itself as a giant, computer-wide pasteboard—an area where you can 
temporarily stash pieces of text or graphics as you work. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-1.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 4:52:28 AM

6.1 Moving Data Between Documents
When the material you drag to the desktop contains nothing but an Internet address, such as 
an email address or Web page URL, Mac OS X gives it a special icon and a special function: 
an Internet location file. See Section 18.10 for details. 
When you drag material out of the document window and onto the desktop, you get a clipping 
file. Its icon depends on the kind of material contained within: from top, a text clipping, picture 
clipping, and movie clipping. (For easy identification, Mac OS X conveniently titles text 
clippings by the first line of the text contained inside.) You can view a clipping just by double-
clicking it, so that it opens into its own window (left).
 
6.1.3 Export/Import 
When it comes to transferring large chunks of information—especially address books, spreadsheet cells, and database 
records—from one program to another, none of the data-transfer methods described so far in this chapter do the trick. For 
these purposes, use the Export and Import commands found in the File menu of almost every database, spreadsheet, 
email, and address-book program. (In some programs, the Save As command serves this function.) 
These Export/Import commands aren't part of Mac OS X, so the manuals (if any) of the applications in question should be 
your source for instructions. For now, however, the power and convenience of this feature are worth noting—it means that

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
Considering how many ways there are to get files back and forth between Macs, it seems almost comical that anybody complained when 
Apple discontinued built-in floppy disk drives. For one thing, you can almost always email the file to someone—even to yourself! And there 
are plenty of other ways to move files around: 
6.2.1 By Network
With about $50 worth of equipment (or $300, if you want to go wireless), you can connect your Macs together into a network. Once you've 
done so, you can keep an icon for each Mac's hard drive on your screen. You can open files from the other drives, copy stuff back and 
forth—anything you would do with your own disk. 
Step-by-step instructions are in Chapter 12. 
6.2.2 By CD or DVD 
You can always burn your files onto a blank CD or DVD and then carry it to the other machine. You'd use this approach when, for 
example, you have a lotof data to copy, but the two Macs aren't within networking range; for example, they're not in the same room or the 
same city. 
6.2.3 FireWire Disk Mode
FireWire Disk Mode is a brilliant but little-known, Macintosh-only feature that lets you turn one Mac into an external hard drive for another. 
This is by far the fastest method yet for transferring a lot of data—even faster than copying files over a network. It's extremely useful in any 
of these situations: 
G     You're traveling with a laptop. You want to copy your life onto it from your main Mac, including your entire 2 GB email folder and 
project files, before taking it on a trip, and then unload it when you return. 
G     You have a new Mac. You want to copy everything off the old one, without having to wait all night. 
G     One Mac won't start up. You want to repair it, using another Mac as a "front end." 
In the following steps, suppose your main Mac is an iMac, and you want to use a PowerBook as an external hard drive for it. 
1.  Shut down the PowerBook. 
Make sure it's plugged in, too. You wouldn't want the battery to die in the middle of this process. (Leave the iMac on.) 
2.  Using a FireWire cable, connect the FireWire jacks of both computers. 
For this trick, you'll need a 6-pin FireWire cable—not the one that connects a camcorder to a Mac. The one you need has the 
same, large connector on both ends. (The one that comes with an original iPod is exactly right.) 
NOTE
If your Mac has one of Apple's new FireWire 800 jacks, use its traditional FireWire 400 connector instead. Otherwise, 
you'll need either a special FireWire 800-to-FireWire-400 cable, or the 400-to-800 adapter that came with your Mac. 
3.  Turn on the PowerBook. Hold down the T key immediately after the chime. 
You can release the key when you see a giant, yellow, Y-shaped FireWire icon bouncing around the laptop screen. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-2.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 4:52:33 AM

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
Now take a look at the iMac's screen: Sure enough, there's the PowerBook's hard drive icon on the desktop. You're ready to copy 
files onto or off of it, at extremely high speeds, and go on with your life. 
4.  When you're finished working with the PowerBook, eject it from the iMac's screen as you would any disk. Then turn off 
the laptop by pressing the power button. 
Disconnect the FireWire cable only when you're sure the laptop is off. 
6.2.4 Via the iPod 
As noted in Chapter 10, an Apple iPod is an extremely fine music player with enormous capacity. That's because it contains an actual hard 
drive that stores the songs. 
But because the iPod has a FireWire connector, it makes a dandy portable hard drive for everyday files, too—not just music. 
NOTE
Of course, you can transfer data using any external FireWire hard drive without having to follow any particular steps. 
To set this up, proceed like this: 
1.  Connect the iPod to your Mac with a FireWire cable. 
Use the white one that came with the iPod. The style of cable changed with the 2003 iPod models, but either way, one end fits 
your Mac's FireWire jack. 
(If this is the first time you've done this, the iTunes Setup Assistant may appear, offering you the chance to name your iPod.) 
2.  Open iTunes. Click the iPod icon in the left-side Source list, and then click the iPod icon in the lower-right corner of the 
screen. 
The iPod Preferences window appears. 
3.  Turn on "Enable FireWire disk use." 
A dialog box warns you that even when you're just syncing up your music collection (and not using the iPod as a hard drive for 
files), you'll have to manually eject the iPod after each use. 
4.  Click OK, and then OK again. 
After a moment, you'll see the iPod's icon appear on your desktop. 
Now you've got yourself a multi-gigabyte external hard drive. Just drag your files onto, or off of, the iPod icon, exactly as though it's a disk 
(which it is). The iPod automatically keeps your data files separate from your music files; your files won't be touched when you update your 
music collection from iTunes. 
Whenever you're finished using the iPod as a hard drive, eject it in any of the usual ways. For example, drag its icon to the Trash, or 
Control-click it and choose Eject from the contextual menu. 
6.2.5 Via Flash Drive 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-2.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 4:52:33 AM

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
A flash drive , also called a thumb drive, is a tiny keychain-like doodad that plugs into your USB port. Inside is little more than a big chunk 
of RAM (memory) that acts like a miniature hard drive. When the flash drive is plugged into your Mac, its icon shows up on the desktop as 
a disk. Use it as a tiny, 512 MB hard drive (or whatever size you've bought). 
The beauty of a flash drive is that it works instantly and automatically with any Mac or any Windows machine, without any software 
installation or configuration; it's small and light enough to carry around on your keychain; and it's so darned cool. If you do any kind of 
regular transfer of everyday documents between Macs or between Macs and PCs, a flash drive will change your life. 
6.2.6 Via Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a long-delayed, but promising, cable-elimination technology. It's designed to let Bluetooth-equipped gadgets communicate 
within about 30 feet, using radio signals. 
Already you can get Bluetooth—either built in or as a slide-in cartridge—for computers, printers, Palm and PocketPC organizers, Sony 
camcorders, and so on. Apple's wireless keyboard and mouse both rely on Bluetooth. Even some phones have built-in Bluetooth 
transmitters. 
Apple's Bluetooth adapter costs $50 and takes the form of a little nubbin that plugs into any Mac OS X Mac's USB port. It lets you sync 
with a Bluetooth-equipped Palm organizer, use a Bluetooth cellphone as a modem to get you online, use the Apple wireless keyboard or 
mouse—and transfer files through the air to similarly equipped gear. 
Bluetooth isn't especially fast—in fact, it's pretty darned slow. (You'll get transfer speeds of 30 to 50 K per second, depending on the 
distance.) But when you consider the time you'd have taken for wiring, passwords, and configuration using any other connection method, 
you may find that Bluetooth wins, at least in casual, spur-of-themoment, airport-seat situations. 
And when you consider that Bluetooth works no matter what the operating system —Mac, Windows, Palm, Pocket PC—you can see that it 
has great potential as a universal file-exchange translator, too.
6.2.6.1 Sending a file 
To shoot a file or two across the airwaves to a fellow Bluetooth-equipped Mac fan, proceed like this: 
Top: Make sure that Discoverable is turned on. If a device (like your Mac) isn't in "discoverable" mode, 
then no other Bluetooth gizmos can see it. You get plenty of privacy, but no productivity. While you're at it, 
by the way, turn on "Show Bluetooth status in the menu bar." 
Bottom: The Bluetooth menulet makes it quick and easy to shoot a file to another person (Mac or 
Windows) who's blessed (or shrewd) enough to have a Bluetooth-equipped machine.

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
 
1.  Open System Preferences. Click the Bluetooth icon. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-2.html (4 of 7)5/3/2004 4:52:33 AM

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
This panel appears in System Preferences only if you do, in fact, have a properly installed Bluetooth adapter. 
2.  Adjust the Settings tab as shown at top in Figure 6-3. 
Discoverable means, "Other Bluetooth gadgets can see me." 
3.  Close System Preferences. From the Bluetooth menulet ( Figure 6-3, top), choose Send File. 
After a moment, the Select File to Send dialog box appears. (You've actually succeeded in opening a program called Bluetooth 
File Exchange, which sits in your Applications
Extras
Bluetooth folder.) 
4.  Navigate to, and select, the files you want to send. 
If you're trying to send a bunch of them, you may find it easier to drag their icons onto the Bluetooth File Exchange icon in your 
Dock. 
Either way, a new Send File dialog box appears.
Top: You can control what happens when someone sends you files via Bluetooth. Usually, you'll 
want your Mac to ask you whether or not to accept these files (that's what the option "Prompt for 
each file" means). You can also specify where you want received files to wind up. Here, they've been 
set to land in your Home
 Documents folder. 
Bottom: Here's the exciting moment when a file is actually winging your way. (It's even more 
exciting when you peek at the other guy's screen to see that your progress bars are proceeding in 
parallel.)

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
 
5.  Click Search. 
The Bluetooth software scans the airwaves in search of other Bluetooth-equipped computers. At least these days, since Bluetooth 
is still a new technology, you'll probably know perfectly well which ones are in range. (They, too, must be in Discoverable mode, 
by the way.) 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-6-SECT-2.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 4:52:33 AM

6.2 Exchanging Data with Other Macs
6.  In the list of found machines, click the name of the one you want to send your files to, and then click Send. 
What happens now—on the receiving end—depends on how the receiving Mac has been set up (Figure 6-4, top). In most cases, 
a dialog box tells the receiver that files are arriving; if he clicks Accept, the download proceeds (Figure 6-4, bottom). He's then 
offered the chance to either (a) open the transferred file or (b) reveal its highlighted icon in the Finder. 
When you send files to a Windows PC or some other gadget using this method, security may be tighter. You may be asked to 
make up a temporary, one-time password that must be typed into both your Mac and the receiving device within, say, one minute, 
to prove that this transfer is authorized. 
6.2.7 Fetching a file
Using the Send a File command in the Bluetooth menulet is a quick and satisfying way to transfer a file—but it's not the only way. You can 
also perform this entire procedure in reverse. That is, you can go fishing through your buddies' files without their explicitly having to send 
one. 
Once you're looking at the contents of your buddy's Bluetooth shared folder, you can either click a file 
name and click Get, or you can just drag the file out of the dialog box and onto your desktop.
 
To make a Mac invade-able, the person to be invaded must turn on "Allow other devices to browse files on this computer" (Figure 6-4), 
and indicate which folder contains the files to be shared. 
Then all you have to do is choose Browse Device from your own menulet (Figure 6-3)—and let the rummaging begin!

6.3 Exchanging Data with Windows PCs

6.3 Exchanging Data with Windows PCs
It's no surprise that the Mac is great at transferring information among Mac programs. The big news is how easy Mac OS X 
makes it to transfer files between Macs and Windows computers. 
Documents can take one of several roads between your Mac and a Windows machine, many of which are the same as Mac-
to-Mac transfers. For example, you can transfer a file on a disk (such as a CD or Zip disk), a flash drive, via network, by 
Bluetooth, on an iPod, as an attachment to an email message, via Web page, as an FTP download, and so on. The 
following pages offer some pointers on these various transfer schemes. 
6.3.1 Preparing the Document for Transfer
Without special adapters, you can't plug an American appliance into a European power outlet, play a CD on a cassette 
deck, or open a Macintosh file in Windows. Therefore, before sending a document to a colleague who uses Windows, you 
must be able to answer "yes" to both of these questions. 
6.3.1.1 Is the document in a file format Windows understands?
Most popular programs are sold in both Mac and Windows flavors, and the documents they create are freely 
interchangeable. For example, documents created by recent versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, FileMaker, FreeHand, 
Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and many other Mac programs don't need any conversion. The corresponding 
Windows versions of those programs open such documents with nary a hiccup. 
Files in one of the standard exchange formats don't need conversion, either. These formats include JPEG (the photo format 
used on Web pages), GIF (the cartoon/logo format used on Web pages), HTML (raw Web page documents before they're 
posted on the Internet), Rich Text Format (a word-processor exchange format that maintains bold, italic, and other 
formatting), plain text (no formatting at all), QIF (Quicken Interchange Format), MIDI files (for music), and so on. 
But what about documents made by Mac programs that don't exist on the typical Windows PC hard drive, such as 
AppleWorks 6? It's available to educators in a Windows version, but you certainly can't count on your recipient having it. 
Do your recipients the favor of first saving such documents into one of the formats listed in the previous paragraphs. In 
AppleWorks, for example, choose File
Save As; from the File Type pop-up menu, choose "Word Win 97, 2000"; name 
this special version of the document (remember the .doc suffix); and then click Save. 
6.3.1.2 Does the file have the correct three-letter file name suffix?
As noted in Chapter 4, every document on your hard drive has some kind of tag to tell the computer what program is 
supposed to open it: either a pair of invisible fourletter codes or a file name suffix like .doc. 
Microsoft Windows uses only the latter system for identifying documents. Here are some of the most common such codes:

The beauty of Mac OS X is that your Mac adds these file name suffixes automatically and invisibly, every time you save a 
new document from a Mac OS X program. You and your Windows comrades can freely exchange documents without ever 
worrying about this former snag in the Macintosh/Windows relationship. 
6.3.2 Notes on Disk Swapping
Once you've created a document destined for a Windows machine, your next challenge is to get it onto that machine. One 
way is to put the file on a disk—a CD you've burned, for example—which you then hand to the Windows user. 
In theory, this kind of exchange shouldn't be possible, because Macs and PCs format disks differently. When you insert a 
Mac floppy disk into a PC, for example, an error message declares it to be unreadable. Windows then offers to "correct" the 
problem by erasing the disk. 
6.3.2.1 How the Mac reads Windows disks
Fortunately, although Windows can't read Mac disks, the Mac can read (and save onto) Windows disks. When you insert a 
Windows-formatted floppy, Zip, or CD into your Mac, its icon appears onscreen just like a Mac disk. You can drag files to 
and from this disk (or its window), rename files, delete files, and so on, exactly as though you're working with a Mac disk. (It 
doesn't operate nearly as quickly as a Mac disk, though.) 
6.3.2.2 Creating a Windows disk on the Mac
You can even create a Windows disk on your Macintosh. CDs that you burn on the Mac, for example, are Windows 
compatible right out of the gate. 
To share a floppy or Zip disk, you must first erase it using Disk Utility (in your Applications
 Utilities folder). (This 
example assumes that you have a floppy or a Zip drive, either of which you can buy for any USB Mac—although honestly, 
these days, buying a flash drive makes a heck of a lot more sense.) Insert the disk, so that its icon shows up in the list at 
the left side of the window, and then click the Erase tab. Click the disk's name, use the pop-up menu to specify MS-DOS 
File System format, and then click Erase. After the erasing process is over, you can insert the floppy into both Macs and 
PCs with equal success. 
6.3.3 Network Notes
Mac OS X can "see" shared disks and folders on Windows PCs that are on the same network. Seated at the Mac, you can 
open or copy files from a PC—or vice versa. Complete instructions are in Chapter 12. 
6.3.4 Via the Internet

Chapter 7. AppleScript
You can think of AppleScript programs (called scripts) as software robots. A simple AppleScript might perform some daily 
task for you: backing up your Documents folder, for example.
A more complex script can be pages long. In professional printing and publishing, where AppleScript enjoys its greatest 
popularity, a script might connect to a photographer's hard drive elsewhere on the Internet, download a photo from a 
predetermined folder, color-correct it in Photoshop, import it into a specified page-layout document, print a proof copy, and 
send a notification email to the editor—automatically.
Even if you're not aware of it, you use technology that underlies AppleScript all the time. Behind the scenes, numerous 
components of your Mac communicate with each other by sending Apple Events, which are messages bearing instructions 
or data that your programs send to each other. When you use the Show Original command for an alias, or the Get Info 
command for a file or folder, an Apple Event tells the Finder how to respond. Some of the files in the Speakable Items folder 
(Section 14.4.2.4), furthermore, are AppleScripts that quit your programs, open AppleWorks, switch a window into list view, 
and so on.
AppleScript veterans will find a lot of enhancements in Mac OS X 10.3—and there's a nice surprise for first-timers, too.

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
You don't have to create AppleScripts to get mileage out of this technology. Mac OS X comes with several dozen prewritten 
scripts that are genuinely useful—and all you have to do is choose their names from a menu. "Playing back" an AppleScript 
in this way requires about as much technical skill as pressing an elevator button.
Similarly, you can download all sorts of useful scripts for iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, AppleWorks, 
and other programs from the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/applescript/imovie; substitute 
the program name for that final part of the address).
To sample some of these cool starter scripts, you must first add the Script menu to your menu bar (see Figure 7-1).
Now open the newly installed Script menulet (which Apple calls simply the Script menu), whose icon looks like a scroll, to 
see the list of prewritten scripts.
The Script menu reflects the contents of two different Scripts folders: the one in your 
Home
Library Scripts folder, and the one in your main Library folder. (The ones in your 
Home folder are listed below the dotted line in the Script menu.)
These scripts aren't just for running. They're also ideal for opening up in Script Editor (just by 
double-clicking) and analyzing line by line, to learn how they work. (Script Editor is a program 
in your Applications
 AppleScript folder, which you can use to type up your own scripts.) 
Once you understand the syntax, you can then copy bits of the code to modify and use in 
your own scripts.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
What's New in Panther's AppleScript
Dear AppleScript veterans:
A lot of the great old scripting tools (like scripting additions), Web sites, and Internet resources apply only to 
AppleScript in Mac OS 9 and earlier. And thousands of scripts that require the old Finder flounder in the Mac 
OS X Finder, which works somewhat differently.
Still, after several incarnations, the AppleScript of Mac OS X is finally becoming a solid tool with lots of 
features. Finder recordability has returned to the Mac in Panther—a great boost for first-timers.
Some of the other new features in Mac OS X 10.3 include:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-1.html (1 of 9)5/3/2004 4:52:41 AM

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
User-interface Scripting. In Panther, AppleScript can choose menu commands, click radio buttons, turn on 
checkboxes, and type into text boxes in the course of running a script—a very useful enhancement in 
situations where the program you want to script isn't very AppleScript-savvy.
Script Editor 2. In version 2, Script Editor offers find-andreplace commands, a spelling checker, and a 
contextual menu (available by Control-clicking the main panel of the Script Editor window) that offers quick 
access to a library of pre-built, error-free code snippets.
Better yet, Script Editor is now itself scriptable; in theory, you could even write scripts that write other scripts.
Folder Actions Setup.The new Folder Actions Setup panel lets you manage all of your Folder Actions 
(Section 7.5.2.2) from a single panel. To open this panel, choose Configure Folder Actions from your Script 
menu (Section 7.1), or open Applications
AppleScript
Folder Actions Setup.
Image Events. The new Image Events application lets your scripts flip, convert, and otherwise manipulate 
graphics files without having to fire up Photoshop.
Help. AppleScript Help isn't actually new in Mac OS X 10.3, but it's been expanded so much, it merits a 
mention. Anyone new to AppleScript should explore the AppleScript or Script Editor Help as a first resort in 
times of confusion.
Some of the scripts operate on familiar components of the Mac OS, like the Finder; others show off applications or features 
that are new in Mac OS X. Here are the categories as they appear in the Script menu:
Mac OS X comes with an assortment of useful scripts to try. The Script menu (which you install 
from your Applications
 AppleScript folder) lets you launch Perl, Shell, and AppleScript 
scripts, just by choosing their names, from within any application. To install the Script menu, 
open your Applications
 AppleScript folder and double-click Install Script Menu.

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
 
7.1.1 Address Book Scripts
In this folder, you'll find a single Import Addresses script that's designed to move addresses to the Address Book from 
Palm Desktop, Entourage, Eudora, or Outlook Express.
7.1.2 Basics
In this folder, you'll find a few simple scripts like AppleScript Help (which opens the Help Viewer and searches for the word 
AppleScript) and AppleScript Website (which opens the AppleScript Web page in your Web browser).
7.1.3 ColorSync
In this folder, you'll find seventeen ColorSync script droplets (scripts that run when you drop something on their icons) 
primarily designed for graphic artists, Web site designers, publishers, and so on.
If you choose a script's name from the menu, you'll get a terse help message and then an Open dialog box for choosing the 
graphics file you want to process. Alternatively, you can drag the graphics files onto the script's icon in the 
Library
Scripts
 ColorSync folder.

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
7.1.4 Finder Scripts
All of these scripts have to do with the Finder—manipulating files and windows, for example. A few of the most useful:
G     Add to File Names, Add to Folder Names. These scripts tack on a prefix or suffix to the name of every file or 
folder in the frontmost Finder window (or, if no windows are open, on the desktop). You could use this script to add 
the word draft or final or old to all of the files in a certain folder.
G     Finder Windows - Hide All minimizes all open Finder windows to the Dock, as though you'd pressed Option-
-
M. Finder Windows - Show All, of course, brings them back from the Dock.
G     Replace Text in Item Names lets you do a search-and-replace of text bits inside file names, folder names, or both. 
When one publisher rejects your 45-chapter book proposal, you could use this script to change all 45 chapter files 
from, for example, "A History of Mouse Pads—A Proposal for Random House, Chapter 1" to "A History of Mouse 
Pads—A Proposal for Simon & Schuster, Chapter 1."
G     Trim File Names, Trim Folder Names.If you made a mistake in using the Add to File Names script, you can 
always use Trim File Names script to undo the damage. This one removes file extensions, suffixes, or prefixes of 
your choosing.
For example, suppose you've just made a lot of new folders at once. Mac OS X calls them "untitled folder," "untitled 
folder 2," and so on. But what if you'd rather have them just called "folder 1," "folder 2," and so on? Run the Trim 
Folder Names script; when the dialog box asks you what you want trimmed, type untitled and click OK.
7.1.5 Folder Actions
This folder contains scripts that were required, in Mac OS X 10.2, to folder actions work (Section 7.5.2.2). In Panther, you 
probably won't use them much, since Controlclicking a folder (or inside its window) offers the same functions.
7.1.6 Folder Action Scripts
The scripts in this folder don't actually show up in the Script menu. They are, however, in your Library
Scripts folder. 
You need to attach them to folders to use them.
They're sample folder action scripts—designed to make folders behave the way you wish they would. These scripts are 
useful just as they are, but even more useful as examples to help you learn the syntax for writing more folder action scripts.
G     add - new item alert. When you drop icons into a folder (to which you've attached this script), the Mac will tell you 
how many icons were added and offer you the chance to inspect the contents of the folder.
G     close - close sub-folders. When you close the folder to which this script is attached, all folders inside it also close.
G     open - show comments in dialog. Whenever you open the folder to which this script is attached, the Mac will 
show you the contents of its Comments box (that is, whatever you typed into the Comments area of its Get Info 
window). You'll be given the chance to open the Get Info window, delete the comments, or do nothing further.
G     convert - PostScript to PDF. When you drop PostScript files into a folder to which you've attached this script, the 
Mac converts them into PDF files. (Pay attention, you graphic designers and print-shop staff who don't have 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller on hand.)
The remaining nine scripts (Image - Add Icon, Image - Duplicate as JPEG, Image - Duplicate as PNG, Image - 
Duplicate as TIFF, Image - Flip Horizontal, Image - Flip Vertical, Image - Info to Comment, Image - Rotate Left, and 
Image - Rotate Right) all perform the specified flipping or conversion operations on graphics files. For example, if you 
dump a bunch of TIFF files into a folder to which you've attached the Duplicate as JPEG script, Mac OS X converts them

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
into JPEG format for you (and preserves the originals).
These scripts are brought to you by Panther's new Image Events Scripting application (see Section 7.1).
7.1.7 FontSync Scripts
FontSync is a noble Apple attempt to solve an old problem for desktop publishers. You finish designing some beautiful 
newsletter, take it to the local printing shop for printing on a high-quality press, and then have to throw out the entire batch—
all because the fonts didn't come out right. The printing shop didn't have exactly the same fonts you had when you prepared 
the document. Or, worse, it did have the same font—but from a different font company, with the same name but slightly 
different type characteristics.
FontSync is designed to give you early warning for such disasters. When you run the Create FontSync Profile script, 
several minutes elapse—and then the Mac generates a FontSync Profile document. This file contains staggering amounts 
of information about the design, spacing, and curlicues of every font installed in your system. When you hand that profile 
over to your print shop, they can drop it onto the accompanying script, called Match FontSync Profile. It will tell them 
precisely what fonts are different on their Macs and yours.
The wishful-thinking aspect of this technology is, of course, that it assumes a lot: that your print shop uses Mac OS 9 or 
Mac OS X, that the print shop knows how to use FontSync, and that you remember to create the profile and submit it.
7.1.8 Info Scripts
These two scripts offer minor usefulness: Current Date & Time displays the current date and time in a dialog box, 
complete with a Clipboard button that copies the information, ready for pasting. Font Sampler was designed, in an era 
before Font Book (Section 13.7), to show you what all your fonts look like.
7.1.9 Internet Services
These scripts are designed to show off the power of XML-RPC and SOAP, two Internetquery technologies that debuted in 
Mac OS X 10.1. For example, the Stock Quote and Current Temperature by Zipcode fetch those respective bits of 
information, popping them into a dialog box without having to use your Web browser, thanks to the power of SOAP (Simple 
Object Access Protocol).
7.1.10 Mail Scripts
This collection of scripts, expanded in Mac OS X 10.3, communicates with Mail (see Chapter 19). Some highlights:
G     Count Messages in All Mailboxes counts all messages and unread messages in all of your mailboxes and 
displays the result.
G     Crazy Message Text is Apple at its wackiest. When you run it, a dialog box asks you what message you want to 
send ("Happy Birthday," for example). Mail then creates a colorful, zany, outgoing formatted message in which 
each letter has a random typeface, style, color, and size. It's ideal for making people think you spent a long time 
with your Format menu for their entertainment.
G     Display All Accounts And Preferences prepares a new mail message that includes information about every 
account you have configured and the preference settings you have set in Mail, all ready to send to some 
troubleshooting expert who needs the details in order to help you.
G     Import Addresses grabs names from the address book from Entourage, Eudora, Outlook Express, or Palm 
Desktop. It's not actually a Mail script—it brings the addresses into Mac OS X's Address Book program—but it's 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-1.html (5 of 9)5/3/2004 4:52:41 AM

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
still handy if you've decided to switch from one of those programs to Apple's Mail program.
G     Quick Mail prompts you for an address and a subject line, launches the Mail application, and sets up a new 
message for you with those attributes. With a little analysis of this script, you should be able to see how it could 
save you time in generating canned, regularly scheduled outgoing mail messages. (A clean installation of Panther 
doesn't include this one, but you may have it if you upgraded from Mac OS X 10.2.)
The Mail Scripts
Rule Action folder contains three scripts, two of which you're supposed to trigger from inside Mail, 
using a message rule (Section 19.4.12):
G     Help With Rule Actions brings up the appropriate help screen so you can read about how to use Rule Actions.
G     Open Apple Website brings up the Apple Web site. It's intended as an example of how you can use Mail's 
message rules to trigger AppleScripts automatically when certain conditions are met.
G     Sample Action Rule Script is also intended as an example; it doesn't do anything but display a dialog box 
indicating the name of the rule that summoned it, along with the subject of the message.
The Mail Scripts
Scripts Menu folder contains several scripts that illustrate how Mail's own Scripts menu can trigger 
AppleScripts. For example:
G     Create New Mailing List Mailbox___ctl-m searches selected email messages for those it thinks came from a 
mailing list. If it strikes gold, it creates a new mailbox, stashes the mailing-list messages in it, and creates a rule 
that puts future messages from that list into the new mailbox automatically.
That "__ Control-m" business is supposed to illustrate how you can create keyboard 
shortcuts for your AppleScripts (at least those in the Script menu). At the end of the script's 
name, you just type three underline characters, followed by the key combination you want—
Control-M, in this case. (Note that this keystroke works only in Mail, and refers to Mail's own 
private Script menu.)
G     Get Source of Selected Message copies the raw message contents of the highlighted message into a new email 
message. Here, source means the raw, underlying code of the message: invisible headers, the message body, 
HTML formatting code, any attached files (in encoded form), and so on.
G     Remove Messages From Sender or Thread___ctl-r. Mail maintains a blacklist of people you'd rather not hear 
from, and a list of threads (subject lines from an ongoing discussion) whose messages you no longer want to read. 
This script can assist you in updating that list.
Suppose, for example, that you select a message from steveapple.com with the subject line, "New Product." When 
you choose this command, Mail displays a set of dialog boxes for creating a message rule that (a) automatically 
deletes all email from steveapple.com or (b) automatically deletes all email in the same thread (having either "New 
Product" or "Re: New Product" as its subject).
G     Speak Sender and Subject makes the Mac say out loud the number of messages that are currently selected (if 
more than one), and then announce the sender's name and subject of each.
G     Summarize Message creates a short summary of the selected message—and then reads it out loud. (Great for 
long-winded correspondents.)
7.1.11 Navigation Scripts
Four of these scripts—New Applications Window, New Home Window, and so on—all open the corresponding windows, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-1.html (6 of 9)5/3/2004 4:52:41 AM

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
just as though you'd used the Finder's Go menu to choose their names. (As for the word "New"—it's a red herring. These 
scripts do not, in fact, open a new window if one is already open.)
The Open Special Folder script presents a list of Mac OS X's special folders: Applications, Favorites, Movies, Sites, 
Utilities, and so on. Double-click the one you want to open—a straight shot to some of Mac OS X's most important folders.
If you're game to edit this script in Script Editor, you can modify it to let you choose and open 
more than one folder simultaneously (by 
-clicking them, for example). Just type multiple 
selections allowed true right after the text Choose folder to open: (which appears at the end 
of a line about a third of the way down the script). Save your changes.
7.1.12 Script Editor Scripts
As the About these scripts command tells you, these 48 canned scripts can help you write faster and more accurate 
scripts, because the code chunks are free of typos and syntax errors. As you progress, you can add your own code-building 
scripts, customized for the kind of scripts you like to build, to make you even more productive.
In any case, to insert one of these code chunks into a script you're editing in Panther's Script Editor 2, just Control-click your 
fledgling script. When you choose from the contextual menu, the code block magically appears in the Script Editor window, 
right where you had clicked. (Alternatively, choose the chunk's name from the Script menu; the code winds up on your 
Clipboard, ready to paste.)
7.1.13 Sherlock Scripts
The sole script here, Search Internet, prompts you for a search string (the words you want to search for on the Web). 
When you click Search, the script opens Sherlock and proceeds to execute your search. All of this saves you a few mouse 
clicks, but this script was likely designed to serve primarily as an example for study by scripting hopefuls.
7.1.14 UI Element Scripts
Much of the time, scripts perform their magic quietly in the background, out of sight. But if you're trying to automate a 
program that doesn't respond to the usual AppleScript commands, your scripts can now "operate" them manually by 
choosing menu commands, clicking buttons, and so on.
NOTE
This feature, called UI (user-interface) scripting, doesn't work until you first open the Universal Access panel 
of System Preferences and make sure that "Enable access for assistive devices" is turned on.
You wouldn't want to run the scripts in the UI Element Scripts folder just as they are; they're simply samples that show you 
the correct syntax.
Here, for example, is a sample script that illustrates how you might use UI scripting. This script brings the frontmost 
TextEdit document to the front, highlights all of its contents, and then reads it out loud.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-1.html (7 of 9)5/3/2004 4:52:41 AM

7.1 Running Ready-Made AppleScripts
tell application "System Events"
     get properties
     tell process "TextEdit"
          set frontmost to true
          delay 1
          keystroke "a" using {command down}
          click menu item "Start Speaking Text" of menu 1 of menu
          item "Speech" of menu 1 of menu item "Services" of menu
          "TextEdit" of menu bar item "TextEdit" of menu bar 1 of application
          process "TextEdit" of application "System Events"
     end tell
end tell
See how the text is selected by "pressing" 
-A, and the speech is triggered by "choosing" the 
TextEdit
Speech
Start Speaking Text menu command? (Of course, TextEdit is scriptable, and you could perform 
the same stunt using a much shorter script without using the UI scripts—but you get the point.)
Here are the demonstration scripts that you'll find in the UI Element Scripts folder:
G     Get User Name.applescript opens the System Preferences
Accounts
Password tab and extracts your 
name from the name field. (To try this script out, open it in Script Editor and run it. You'll see System Preferences 
open, and in a moment, your account name will appear in Script Editor's Result window.)
G     Key Down-Up.applescript. Using TextEdit, this script demonstrates a number of ways to get AppleScript to do 
some typing for you. Use the examples in this script as a template for your own, more useful scripts.
G     Probe Menu Bar.applescript and Probe Window.applescript are valuable demo scripts for "probing" menus and 
window elements (buttons, tabs, text boxes, and so on), in an effort to learn the correct syntax for making UI 
scripting work. For example, open the Menu Bar script and run it in Script Editor, and then observe the long list in 
the Result window. It reveals the correct ways to refer to all active (that is, not dimmed) Finder menu commands. 
(Feel free to change the word "Finder" in the script to another open program's name.)
G     Set Network Location.applescript changes your Network Location settings to Automatic—not an especially 
useful script on its own, but a useful demonstration of how you can trigger commands in your 
 menu. By 
modifying this script, you could, for example, make it change the location of the Dock, turn its magnification off, and 
so on.
G     Set Output Volume.applescript. This script shows you the correct syntax for adjusting your Mac's speaker 
volume. You might incorporate it, for example, into a larger script that reads the mail, launches iTunes, and turns 
up the volume.

All of the scripts in this folder simply open your browser, connect to the Internet if necessary, and then open the specified 
Web pages (the stock quote for Apple on Yahoo, the Apple Store, CNN, and so on). Download Weather Map is much 
cooler; in a flash, it downloads the current U.S. weather map image and then opens the file in the Preview program for 
viewing.
The AppleScript Related Sites scripts in this folder open the most popular and useful AppleScript sites: Bill Cheeseman's 
AppleScript Sourcebook, MacScripter.net, and Apple's own AppleScript Web site. Each offers a wealth of information and

7.2 Creating Your Own AppleScripts

7.2 Creating Your Own AppleScripts
If you ask a crowd of Mac users how many of them write AppleScripts, few hands are likely to go up. That's too bad, 
because as programming languages go, AppleScript is easy to understand. It takes only a few weeks, not years, to become 
comfortable with AppleScript. And the power AppleScript places in your hands is well worth the effort you'll expend learning 
it.
For example, here's a fragment of actual AppleScript code:
open folder "AppleScript" of folder "Applications" of startup disk
You probably don't need a manual to tell you what this line from an AppleScript program does. It opens the 
Applications
AppleScript folder on your hard drive. (That's the folder that contains Script Editor, the Mac OS X program 
that lets you write your own AppleScripts.)
If you have no interest in learning to program, you're not alone. But almost every Mac fan can benefit by understanding 
what AppleScript can do, why it's important in certain industries, and how it may be useful in everyday situations.

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
You can, if you wish, create a script by typing out the computer commands one at a time, just as computer programmers do 
the world over. Details on this process come later in this chapter.
But if the task you want it to handle isn't especially complex, you'll be pleased to discover that in Mac OS X 10.3—surprise!
—the Finder itself is once again recordable, much as it was in the Mac OS 9 days. That is, you can create a script just by 
doing the job manually—using menu commands, opening windows, changing window views, and so on—as Script Editor 
watches and writes out the necessary lines of code automatically. Recording an action and watching the Mac turn your 
movements into lines of AppleScript code is a fantastic way to learn how AppleScript works.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Text to Audio Files
Your Mac can perform an astonishing feat: It can convert a text file into a spoken digital recording in AIFF 
audio format.
This is a twist with huge implications. If you transfer these files to your iPod, you can listen to your documents
—email, Web pages, reports, eBooks, or anything else you can type or download—as you commute, work 
out, or work outside.
Of course, commuters and joggers have been listening to Books on Tape for years, and companies like 
Audible.com create what you might call Books on MP3. But those products are expensive, and you can't listen 
to your own stuff.
To pull this off, just download the two sample scripts at www.apple.com/applescript/macosx/text2audio.html 
7.3.1 A Simple Auto-Recorded Script
The script you'll build in this experiment creates a squeaky-clean new folder, into which you can stuff your newly created 
documents each day for backup. In the following section, you'll find a line-by-line analysis of the result.
1.  Open Script Editor. 
Script Editor is in your Applications
AppleScript folder. It looks like Figure 7-2, except that the window is empty 
when it first opens.
The Script Editor in action. Type a short description into the bottom pane of the window, 
if you like. This script appears already formatted with colored keywords (which aren't 
evident in the grayscale illustration here) and indents because it was created using 
"watch me" mode. (If you don't have an empty window before you begin recording, 
choose File
New.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-3.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:47 AM

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
 
2.  Click Record. 
Script Editor is about to write out the code that describes your every mouse movement, click, and menu command 
from now until you stop recording. In this experiment, you'll create a new folder, name it, open it, change the 
window to list view, resize it, and then move it to a convenient position on the screen.
3.  Click the desktop. Choose File
New Folder. Type Today's Backup and then press Return. 
You've just made a new folder on your desktop. If you sneak a peek at your Script Editor window, you'll see that it 
has begun to notate the computer commands that represent what you've done so far.
4.  Choose File
Open (or press 
-O), and then choose View
as List (
-2). 
5.  Drag the resize handle (the lower-right corner of the window) to make the window smaller. 
Finally, you'll move this backup folder window off to a corner, so that you'll have more room to drag your 
documents into it.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-3.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:47 AM

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
6.  Drag the Today's Backup folder window to a new position on the screen. 
That's all this modest AppleScript will do: Create a new folder, name it, open it, change the view to list view, and 
then resize and reposition it.
7.  Click in the Script Editor window, and then click Stop. 
Your newly created script is complete, as shown in Figure 7-2.
Click your desktop and then throw away the Today's Backup folder, so that you can start fresh. Once again, return 
to Script Editor—but this time, click Run.
In rapid, ghost-driven sequence, you'll see AppleScript create another Today's Backup folder, open it, change it to 
List view, then resize it and drag it to precisely the spot on the screen where you dragged the first one by hand—all 
in a fraction of a second. The script you've created isn't the world's most useful, but it illustrates how powerful and 
fast AppleScript can be.
7.3.2 AppleScript Commands
Scripts you create in "watch me" mode are actually fairly limited. If you want to write scripts for programs that aren't 
recordable—or more complex scripts for the Finder—you'll eventually have to learn to type out AppleScript code for yourself.
As a first step in understanding the AppleScript language, study the code written by Script Editor in the previous example. 
As it turns out, much of this script consists of standard AppleScript jargon that appears in almost every script. Here's a line-
by-line analysis of the little folder-creating script you just made.
tell application "Finder"
     activate
     make new folder at folder "Desktop" of folder "chris" ¬
     of folder "Users" of startup disk with properties
     {name:"untitled folder"}
     set name of folder "untitled folder" of folder "Desktop" ¬
     of folder "chris" of folder "Users" of startup disk to "Today's
     Backup"
     make new Finder window to folder "Today's Backup" ¬
     of folder "Desktop" of folder "chris" of folder "Users" of
     startup disk
     set current view of Finder window 1 to list view
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-3.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:47 AM

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
     set bounds of Finder window 1 to {10, 93, 417, 482}
     set position of Finder window 1 to {11, 453}
end tell
NOTE
The ¬ character means, "This command continues on the next line. Treat it all as one giant clump." (It 
appears on these limited-width pages for clarity, but in Script Editor, you don't actually need them. If you 
don't insert this character manually [by pressing Option-Return], Script Editor wraps lines automatically.)
7.3.2.1 tell application "Finder"
Almost every script begins with a line like this. It specifies which Mac program or window this section of your script will 
control. If you were writing a script manually, you'd begin by typing this line.
Complex scripts can involve several programs—grabbing information from File- Maker and pasting it into QuarkXPress, for 
example. In those longer scripts, you'd see tell application "FileMaker Pro" at the beginning of the steps that involve the first 
program, and then tell application "QuarkXPress" later in the script, where the steps pertain to QuarkXPress.
7.3.2.2 activate
This command means, "Bring the abovementioned program to the front." Technically, you don't have to make the Finder 
the active program to perform the simple folder- creation steps in this script—AppleScript could create and manipulate your 
Today's Backup folder even with the Finder in the background. But Script Editor inserted this step automatically because, 
when recording your actions, you made the Finder the active program (by clicking the desktop). You're welcome to delete 
this step from your Script Editor window.
This is only the first of many examples you'll find in which Script Editor records wordier scripts than necessary. Hand-typed 
scripts, like those described later in this chapter, are typically more compact and faster to run.
7.3.2.3 make new folder at folder "Desktop" of folder "chris" of folder "Users" of startup disk 
with properties {name:"untitled folder"}
This command tells the Finder to create a new folder on your desktop. (Why does it say "of folder chris"? Because 
remember that in Mac OS X, every account holder has a separate desktop.)
If you're writing out scripts by hand, it's worth knowing that you don't really need a command this verbose. The line make 
new folder at desktop would do just as well.
7.3.2.4 set name of folder "untitled folder" of folder "Desktop" of folder "chris" of folder "Users" 
of startup disk to "Today's Backup"
This step renames the new folder. (You could also type set name of folder "untitled folder" to "Today's Backup" for a more 
concise version.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-3.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:47 AM

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
AppleScript processes the expression in parentheses first, just as in mathematics, and uses its result to evaluate that part 
outside of the parentheses. Either way, the result is a renamed folder.
7.3.2.5 make new Finder window to folder "Today's Backup" of folder "Desktop" of folder 
"chris" of folder "Users" of startup disk
This step opens the new folder to a Finder window. (Talk about wordy! The handscripter's more elegant alternative: open 
folder "untitled folder".)
7.3.2.6 set current view of Finder window 1 to list view
The frontmost window is always number 1 in the Finder's eyes. This command changes its view to list view.
7.3.2.7 set bounds of Finder window 1 to {10, 93, 417, 482}
Here's how AppleScript thinks when it resizes your Finder window. The first two numbers in the list represent the vertical 
and horizontal coordinates of the window's upper-left corner, as measured in pixels from the upper-left corner of your 
screen. The second pair of numbers represents the position of the lower-right corner of the Finder window.
7.3.2.8 set position of Finder window 1 to {11, 453}
This script step moves your window to the specified position, once again measured in pixels from the upper-left corner of 
the screen to the upper-left corner of the window.
7.3.2.9 end tell
You're finally telling the Script Editor that it can stop paying attention to Finder. End tell always accompanies the tell 
application command that begins a script. These two commands form the bookends that delineate the instructions to the 
program in question. (AppleScripters call the entire chunk, beginning with tell and ending with end tell, a tell block.)
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Colorful Words in Scripts
Why does Script Editor put some words in color and some in black? 
Imagine that your word processor could color-code the words you type, according to their function in the 
sentence, or their part of speech. If you were asked to analyze the sentences for grammatical correctness, 
having the color code would be a big help; you could almost see the sentence structure.
AppleScript has rules of syntax as well. Script Editor checks your syntax for you, and displays the words you 
type in different colors according to whether it thinks that they're language keywords, application keywords, 
variables, operators, and so on. The color coding makes a script much easier to read. It can also sometimes 
help you find typos.
In Panther, AppleScript has a new standard color scheme. It doesn't color-code everything, but it's better than 
the allblack coloring approach of the old AppleScript.

7.3 Recording Scripts in "Watch Me" Mode
To adjust the color settings, choose Script Editor
Preferences and click the Formatting icon. Double-click 
a color swatch to change it, or a "part of speech" name to change its font.
You can change the fonts and formatting Script Editor uses to write out your scripts. Choose

7.4 Saving a Script

7.4 Saving a Script
Before you save a script, let Script Editor check its syntax by clicking the Compile button. (If you don't perform a syntax 
check manually before trying to save, Script Editor will automatically do it for you as soon as you try to save.)
NOTE
The Compile button won't find any errors if you created a script using the "watch me" system. After all, Script 
Editor itself wrote the script, so of course it's perfect. But when you write scripts by hand, as described later 
in this chapter, you'll find the Compile button a useful tool for cleaning stray errors out of your scripts.
If Script Editor finds your script to be correctly written, you'll get no reaction from Script Editor except to see your script 
formatted with colors and fonts, as shown in Figure 7-3. If it does find a problem with the syntax, you'll be limited to saving 
your script file in only one format: plain text.
If you type an AppleScript manually, it appears just as it would in a word processor (top left): in 
Courier with no special formatting. When you click the Check Syntax button, however, Script 
Editor indents the tell block and changes all type to Verdana (bottom right), with AppleScript's 
reserved words (language keywords and application keywords) in colored type and comments 
in smaller, italic type. Congratulations: You've got the Script Editor seal of approval.

7.4 Saving a Script
At this point, you're ready to save your script. Choose File
Save. Name your script and choose a location for it, by all 
means—but the important step here is to choose a format for your completed script (see Figure 7-4). Your choices depend 
on whether you want your scripts to work in Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, or both. They also depend on how you intend to use 
your scripts.
G     Script. Saving as a Script really means as a compiled script. You can't double-click a compiled script to run it. 
Nonetheless, compiled scripts are required by a number of programs that launch AppleScripts, including your 
Mac's Script menu (see Figure 7-1) and any programs that have their own Script menus. These so-called 
attachable programs include FileMaker Pro, Entourage, and Eudora, among others. Compiled scripts can run in 
both Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.
When you choose this option, you're offered an additional checkbox. If you choose Run Only, neither you nor 
anyone else can open your script for editing later. You may want to use Run Only scripts for distribution to people 
who shouldn't be modifying your scripts, or if you are being secretive about your code.
Top: The format you choose when you save a script depends mostly upon the operating 
system on which you plan to use your script and how you plan to use it. In Panther, you can 
specify what kind of invisible line-ending character you want: LF, CR, or CRLF (for reading on 
Unix, Mac, or Windows, respectively). 
Bottom: The Options checkboxes control what happens when someone double-clicks the 
resulting AppleScript icon.

7.4 Saving a Script
 
G     Application. Choose this option if you want to create a standalone, double-clickable application script suitable for 
use in Mac OS X or OS 9. You can put the resulting script into the Dock, for example, so that you can trigger it 
whenever you like. Or you can put the finished script into, say, your Startup Items list to run automatically at startup 
(to search the Web for news of your industry and save the Web pages in a new folder, for example).
When you choose this option, you're offered three additional checkboxes (Figure 7-4, bottom). Run Only works 
just as it does for a compiled Script, as explained on the previous page. If you choose Stay Open, the applet 
you've created remains running after it's launched—just what you'd want for scripts that are meant to monitor some 
activity on your computer continuously.
In general, you'll want to leave Startup Screen turned off, so the startup message never appears. If you turn it on, 
however, then whatever description you provided for your script appears whenever the script runs. You, or whoever 
is using your script, must then click either Run or Quit after the script launches. This can become tiresome very 
quickly.
G     Script Bundle. Choose this option if your script relies on external files like a video clip, a graphic, or even other 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-4.html (3 of 4)5/3/2004 4:52:50 AM

7.4 Saving a Script
scripts. Script Editor will bundle them together with your script into a single icon.
G     Application Bundle. Like the Application option, this format creates a doubleclickable, self-running script 
application—but one that can run only on Mac OS X 10.3 and later. Here again, the point is to store resources used 
by the script in a single icon (a package), making it possible to deploy more complicated scripts without worrying 
that some supporting files might go astray.
G     Text. You can't actually run an AppleScript that's saved as a text file, but saving it this way provides a good way to 
exchange scripts with other people or to save an unfinished script you want to work on later.

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand
Using the "watch me" mode, you can create only very simple scripts. If you want to create anything more elaborate, you 
must type out the script steps one by one, testing your work, debugging it, reworking it, and so on.
7.5.1 Scriptable Programs
Most introductory articles about AppleScript discuss scripts that perform useful tasks in the Finder—that is, scripts that 
manipulate your files, folders, disks, and so on. That's because AppleScript can control almost every element of the Finder, 
making it an extraordinarily scriptable program.
But AppleScript can also control and communicate with almost every popular Mac program: FileMaker, AppleWorks, Adobe 
and Microsoft applications, and so on. Sherlock, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, QuickTime Player, Terminal, TextEdit, Mail, 
Internet Connect, and Image Capture are among the built-in Mac OS X programs that you can control with AppleScripts, 
and the list is always growing.
Before you can write a script that manipulates, say, FileMaker, you need to learn which commands FileMaker can 
understand. Most Mac programs understand at least the most basic four AppleScript commands—Open, Print, Quit, and 
Run—but some offer a much larger AppleScript vocabulary. To find out, you need to look at the application's dictionary—
the list of AppleScript commands it understands.
To do so, open Script Editor; choose File
Open Dictionary. You're offered a list of all scriptable applications on your 
Mac. You can jump to the program you want by typing the first few letters of its name (a new Panther feature). Once it's 
highlighted, press Enter, or double-click the name of the program you want to check out (see Figure 7-5). If the application 
whose dictionary you seek is not in the list, click the Browse button and hunt for it.
You can also open a dictionary by dragging a program's icon onto the Script Editor icon—a 
good argument for parking Script Editor in the Dock.
The dictionary for a program lists the AppleScript commands and objects (classes) it knows 
about. If you click one of the commands on the left side of the window, you see an explanation 
of how to use it on the right. Unfortunately, you don't get any examples; it's up to you to try 
each command to see how it works.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-5.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:53 AM

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand
 
That's not to say, of course, that these commands make much sense to someone who's never written an AppleScript 
before. These commands, and the scripts that incorporate them, still require study and experimentation. But a glance at a 
program's AppleScript dictionary is a good way to assess its scriptability—and therefore how much the software company 
has embraced the Macintosh Way.
7.5.2 Two Sample Scripts
In the following hand-typed examples, you'll encounter new kinds of tell blocks, scripts that control more than one program 
at a time, and scripts that do things that you can't even do manually. If you look over these examples carefully—and type 
them up for yourself in Script Editor—you'll begin to see how similar to English AppleScript can be. You may also wind up 
with some useful scripts that can make your Macintosh life easier.
7.5.2.1 Example 1: Auto-backup before shutting down
Suppose you'd like to use your new iPod as a backup disk. You want to be able to back up your Home
Documents 
folder each day without having to burrow through folders, drag and drop, click OK, and so on. AppleScript can do the job 
automatically.
In Script Editor, choose File
New Script, and then type this:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-5.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:52:53 AM

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand
tell application "Finder"
duplicate folder "Documents" of folder "chris" of folder "Users"
of startup disk to disk "Ye Olde iPod" with replacing
end tell
Here's how the key command breaks down:
G     duplicate. AppleScript also offers commands called move and copy. So why duplicate? 
Use move when you want to "drag" an icon around on the same disk, changing its location; use duplicate when you 
want to leave a copy behind. (In this example, it doesn't matter which command you choose. "Dragging" an icon to 
a different disk always makes a copy and never moves the original.)
Copy, to AppleScript, means "copy to the Clipboard," which the Finder can't do by AppleScript control. (The 
Finder's dictionary lists the copy command as "not available yet.")
As for the phrase with replacing: You'll probably want to run this auto-backup script every day, so you'll want it to 
wipe out yesterday's Documents backup each time you run it. That's what with replacing accomplishes.
G     folder "Documents" of folder "chris" of folder "Users" of startup disk. All of this business simply reflects the 
location of your Documents folder. It's in your Home folder, of course, which bears your name. In this example, 
substitute your actual Home folder's name for "chris."
After you've run your script a couple times from within Script Editor (by clicking the Run button) and enjoyed the mad, brain-
shocking power, add a little finesse by adding the new commands shown here in italics:
tell application "Finder"
duplicate folder "Documents" of folder "chris" of folder "Users"
of startup disk to disk "Ye Olde iPod" with replacing
activate me
beep
display dialog "Backup Successful!" buttons "Cool!"
end tell
The additional commands make the Mac beep and report, in a little dialog box, "Backup Successful!" after it makes the 
copy. It even offers a button ("Cool!") that you can click to dismiss the dialog box. (Of course, you can make the button say 
anything you like—"OK," "Get on with it," "Good boy!" or whatever.)
Once you've created this little script, save it as an application and put it in the Dock, on your Finder toolbar, or in your 
Sidebar. Or save it as a compiled script in your Home folder
Library
Scripts folder, so that you'll be able to trigger 
your backup from the Script menu.

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand
As you get better at AppleScript, you'll realize that this script is only the beginning. You could, for example, add a date 
stamp in the folder name, label the folder, make it always keep the most recent backup (a rolling backup strategy), back the 
files up to your iDisk, "eject" the iPod disk after the backup is complete, and even speak out loud, "All done, O master!" after 
the copying is complete.
7.5.2.2 Example 2: Universal Shutdown
Every now and then, you might find it useful to quit all running programs except the Finder. Unfortunately, there's no one-
step command that quits all of your open programs—but you can create one for yourself.
Nearly every Mac program on earth understands the Quit command when sent by AppleScript. All you have to do, then, is 
to send that command to each of the programs you're likely to have open. If you spend most of your time in AppleWorks, 
Mail, and Safari, for example, your script might look like this:
tell application "AppleWorks"
quit
end tell
tell application "Mail"
quit
end tell
tell application "Safari"
quit
end tell
In time, after hanging out on AppleScript mailing lists and studying a few other scripts, you'd realize that you could shorten 
those tell blocks like this:
tell application "AppleWorks" to quit
tell application "Mail" to quit
tell application "Safari" to quit
Even so, this script is doomed. If some of these programs aren't actually running, the script will dutifully launch each 
application and then quit it, which won't exactly make you the envy of your household. Fortunately, there's a better way.
What you really want is a script that briskly exits every running program, but is smart enough not to disturb the important 
system processes that run in the background. (Note that process, in computer-speak, refers to any running program, 
including both the applications you're using and the secret background ones that the Mac runs all the time.) So you'd want 
this:

7.5 Writing Commands by Hand
tell application "Finder"
     set quitList to the name of every application process whose file type is "APPL"
end tell
repeat with i from 1 to count of quitList
     tell application (item i of quitList) to quit
end repeat
Here's how some of these unfamiliar lines break down:
G     set quitList to the name of every application process whose file type is "APPL." You're defining a new 
variable, a stunt double, called quitList. It's a list of every program whose file type (Section 4.5.1) is APPL—that is, 
every double-clickable program. By limiting it to processes whose file type is APPL, you avoid quitting most of Mac 
OS X's important background programs.
G     repeat with i from 1 to count of quitList. This is a loop. You're saying, "run through the quitList list, exiting each 
program until you're at the end of the list."
Unfortunately, if you actually try this script (hint: save it first), you'll discover that it's the neutron bomb of scripts: It quits 
everything in sight, including the Dock, invisible graphic-interface programs like SystemUIServer, and even Script Editor 
itself! Oops.
By adding a few more lines, however, you can specify the names of processes that you want untouched:
set excludedOnes to {"Script Editor", "loginwindow", "Dock",
"SystemUIServer", "System Events", "ClassicAuxInput"}
tell application "Finder"
     set quitList to the name of every application process whose
file type is "APPL"
end tell
repeat with i from 1 to count of quitList
set aProcess to item i of quitList
if aProcess is not in excludedOnes then
     tell application aProcess to quit
end if
end repeat
This script gives you an even greater degree of control, because you can add to the list of processes that aren't to be

disturbed. Just add them to the bracketed list in the first line, always in quotes and followed by a comma. Now you're free to 
quit all of your running applications—even applications running in Classic—with one click of the mouse.

7.6 Folder Actions
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
7.6 Folder Actions
A folder action is a script that the Mac triggers automatically whenever you do something specific to a particular folder: open 
it, close it, move it, resize it, or change its contents.
7.6.1 Attaching and Removing Folder Actions
If you've never before used folder actions, first run the Enable Folder Actions script from the Script menu, which turns on 
the feature. (You can also turn on Enable Folder Actions in the new Folder Actions Setup program, which is in your 
Applications
 AppleScript folder.)
Then, to attach a script to a folder, see Figure 7-6.
A folder shows no indication that an action is attached. You can, however, add a little 
indicator badge to it manually. The badged icon has vanished from Apple's AppleScript site, 
but you can still download it from the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com.
Keep your eye on www.apple.com/applescript/folderactions too, for updated versions of the 
canned folder action scripts that come with your system, plus extra sample script.
To attach a script to a folder, Control-click the folder's icon. From the contextual menu, choose 
Attach a Folder Action. Then, in the dialog box, select the folder action script you want to run 
whenever somebody interacts with the specified folder. (It's perfectly OK to attach more than 
one script to a folder.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-6.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:52:55 AM

7.6 Folder Actions
 
To remove a Folder Action script from its folder, use any of these approaches:
G     Control-click the closed folder icon (or, if its window is open, Control-click inside the window and choose Remove a 
Folder Action from the contextual menu). From the submenu, choose the script to remove.
G     In the Folder Actions Setup panel, click the name of the folder in the left-side list; in the right pane, click the script 
you want to remove and then click the - button beneath it.
G     From the Script menu, choose Folder Actions
Remove Folder Actions. You're shown a list of folders that have 
folder actions attached; select the one you want to cleanse. Highlight the name of the script you want to remove, 
and click OK.
7.6.2 What They're Good For
For a simple example of what folder actions can do, here's one that notifies you whenever somebody has put new files into 
a particular folder. Type this text into Script Editor, save it to your hard drive, and then attach it to a folder as described on 
the previous page:
on adding folder items to this_folder
     tell application "Finder"
     set the folder_name to the name of this_folder
     display dialog "Someone has put new files into ¬
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-7-SECT-6.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 4:52:55 AM

7.6 Folder Actions
     the folder called " & the folder_name giving up after 30
end tell end adding folder items to
This script incorporates several useful AppleScript techniques you haven't yet seen in this chapter. For example:
G     on adding folder items to. This phrase tells the Mac that the script should run when an icon is added to the folder.
G     this_folder. This term isn't a standard AppleScript term; it's a variable. You can substitute almost any word you like 
(it doesn't have to be this_folder). It's no secret to the Mac which folder "this folder" refers to, because you told it 
which folder when you attached the folder action script.
G     folder_name. This term is another variable. In order not to have to type the name of this_folder over and over 
again, the skilled scripter would use a new variable "folder_name" to hold the value that longer phrase represents—
that is, the folder's name.
G     &. The & is the concatenation operator. It allows you to splice together, or concatenate, separate text chunks. 
When you're composing the message that you want to appear in a dialog box (as indicated by the "display dialog" 
command above), you can string together text you've written between quotes and text in any variables in your 
script. In this example, the fourth line of the script creates a dialog box that reads, "Someone has put new files into 
the folder called Fish Heads" (or whatever the folder is called).
After you've attached this script to a folder, nothing happens until you drop a new file into the folder, at which time a 
message appears, saying, "Someone has put new files into the folder called 'Fish Heads.'" This way, you can keep tabs on 
what your network buddies are submitting while you work on other things. (And if you don't click OK, the dialog box goes 
away by itself after 30 seconds.)
You can find an assortment of ready-made folder action scripts in your 
Library
Scripts
Folder Action Scripts folder. If you have a copy of Mac OS 9 on your 
Mac, a second set awaits in the System Folder
 Scripts
Folder Action Scripts folder. 
Some don't work in Mac OS X, but they're a very good starting point for experimentation.
Keep an eye on Apple's AppleScript Web site for any updates that may include new folder action scripts. Useful things 
appear there frequently.

7.7 Advanced AppleScript
No single chapter—in fact, no entire book—can make you a master AppleScript programmer. Gaining that kind of skill 
requires weeks of experimentation and study, during which you'll gain a lot of appreciation for what full-time software 
programmers endure every day.
By far the best way to learn AppleScript is to study existing scripts (like those in the Library
Scripts folder) and to take 
the free online training courses listed at the end of this chapter. And there are thousands of examples available all over the 
Web. Trying to figure out these scripts—running them after making small changes here and there, and emailing the authors 
when you get stuck—is one of the best ways to understand AppleScript.
On the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com, for example, you'll find a document called Advanced AppleScript.
pdf. It introduces several more complex AppleScript concepts, including variables, loops, nested "if " statements, and so on.
When you get really serious about creating AppleScripts, you'll also want to check out AppleScript Studio (ASS for short—
how did that one get past Marketing?). Technically, it's an integrated development environment that combines Project 
Builder and Interface Builder, making AppleScript a peer language of Java and Objective C. In plain language, ASS lets you 
put a real Aqua user interface on your scripts, complete with dialog boxes, text boxes, buttons, slide controls, and much 
more. It also lets you combine multiple scripts into a single program.
AppleScript Studio is free. It's part of the Developer Tools kit described in Section 9.25.23 .
7.7.1 Where to Learn More
Once you've exhausted the built-in AppleScript help screens (or become exhausted reading them), begin your quest for 
more information at Apple's AppleScript Web site, www.apple.com/AppleScript. There you'll find the link to an excellent, 
step-by-step tutorial in hand-coding scripts, as well as links to these outstanding online AppleScript guides:
G     Apple's own Web site. The place to start your AppleScript quest is at the mother ship—Apple's own AppleScript 
web site (www.apple.com/applescript/ ). There you'll find lots of up-to-date information emanating from Apple, and 
links to all of the significant AppleScript sites on the Web.
At www.apple.com/applescript/guidebook/sbrt/index.html you'll find on-line AppleScript 
Guidebook modules with a lot of useful routines that you can use, borrow from, or dissect for 
the purposes of learning.
G     MacScripter.net. This site is a beehive of AppleScript activity (www.macscripter.net ), run by a group of 
AppleScript enthusiasts. It hosts the latest in AppleScript news from all quarters, links to everything AppleScript 
under the sun, free scripts for downloading, discussion boards, and much, much more.
G     AppleScriptSourcebook.com. Run by Bill Cheeseman, one of AppleScript's longtime enthusiasts, this site 
contains a wealth of technical details about every release of AppleScript, including an expansion on many of the 
terse Apple release notes. There's a lot here for scripters of all levels, so keep it in your browser's AppleScript 
bookmarks.

Each of those three Web sites offer links to commercial AppleScript training course offerings, technical encyclopedias that 
describe every AppleScript command in detail, AppleScript news sites, scripting additions, freeware scripts, code samples, 
multimedia training magazines, and so on.
Other resources:
G     AppleScript mailing lists. Sign up for one of these free, email-based discussion lists whose members are all 
AppleScript fans. Apple runs the AppleScript Users' list; the MacScript list is independent. Given the rapidly 
changing face of AppleScript in Mac OS X, these lists are possibly the best source of up-to-date solutions for the 
new scripter. (Sign up at lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo)
G     AppleScript books. If you want to buy a book about AppleScript, be sure that it's been updated for Mac OS X 10.3
—like the latest edition of AppleScript: The Definitive Guide. 
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Scripting Additions
Much of AppleScript's power comes in the form of add-on files called scripting additions. You can think of 
them as plug-ins, each of which adds a particular new feature to AppleScript's repertoire.
In Mac OS X, you may find scripting additions in any of three different places. The standard additions are in 
the System
 Library
ScriptingAdditions folder. As with fonts, sounds, or other settings, you can also 
install scripting additions that only you can access by making a Scripting Additions folder in your 
Home
Library folder. Similarly, if you're an administrator, you can make a Scripting Additions folder in the 
main Library folder (in the hard drive window); everyone with an account will be able to use the scripting 
additions you place there.
Like a scriptable application, each of these scripting additions has its own dictionary—its own bunch of 
specialized AppleScript commands that you can use in your scripts. You view these new commands just as 
you would when studying the vocabulary of a program: by opening Script Editor, choosing File
Open 
Dictionary, and then navigating to and opening the scripting addition you want.
As more power is built into AppleScript itself, there's less demand for the functions provided by scripting 
additions. In the meantime, now you know where to find them.

Chapter 8. System Preferences
The hub of Mac customization is System Preferences, the modern-day successor to the old Control Panel (Windows) or 
Control Panels (previous Mac systems). Some of its panels are extremely important, as their settings determine whether or 
not you can connect to a network or go online to exchange email. Others handle the more cosmetic aspects of customizing 
Mac OS X. This chapter guides you through the entire System Preferences program, panel by panel. (Reading it will be an 
especially worthwhile exercise if you're used to previous versions of Mac OS X. Apple had a field day rearranging things in 
this system-software toolbox.) 
Only a system administrator (see Section 11.2) can change settings that affect everyone who 
shares a certain machine: its Internet settings, Energy Saver settings, and so on. If you see a 
bunch of controls that are dimmed and unavailable, now you know why.
The tiny padlock in the lower-left corner of a panel (see Figure 8-4 for an example) is the 
other telltale sign. If you, a nonadministrator, would like to edit some settings, call an 
administrator over to your Mac and ask him to click the lock, input his password, and 
supervise your tweaks.

8.1 The System Preferences Window
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.1 The System Preferences Window
You can open System Preferences in dozens of ways, but the quickest is to choose its name from the 
 menu or click its 
icon in the Dock. At first, the rows of icons are grouped according to function: Personal, Hardware, and so on.
But you can also view them in tidy alphabetical order, as shown at bottom in Figure 8-1. That can spare you the ritual of 
hunting through various rows just to find a certain panel icon whose name you already know. (Quick, without looking: Which 
row is Date & Time in?) This alphabetical arrangement matches the way the various panels are organized in this chapter, 
too.
Either way, when you click one of the icons, the corresponding controls appear in the main System Preferences window. To 
access a different preference pane, you have a number of options:
G     Fast: Click the Show All icon in the upper-left corner of the window (or press 
-L, a shortcut worth learning). Then 
click the icon of the new panel you want. (Bonus effect: Shift-click the icon for slow-mo!)
G     Faster: Choose any panel's name from the View menu.
G     New in Panther: Choose a panel's name from the System Preferences Dock icon. (This menu appears only when 
System Preferences is actually open.)
G     Even faster: (This keyboard-only trick assumes that you've turned on Full Keyboard Access; see Section 4.6.) 
Highlight the first System Preferences icon by pressing Tab. (The highlighting is very faint, but it's there.) Then type 
the first couple of letters of the icon you want to highlight—p for Print &, di for Displays, or whatever —and then 
press the Space bar to open that panel.
You can view your System Preferences icons alphabetically (bottom), rather than in rows of 
arbitrary categories (top); just choose View
Organize Alphabetically. This approach not only 
saves space, but also makes finding a certain panel much easier, because you don't need to 
worry about which category it's in.
And while you're customizing: You can hide the toolbar by clicking the upper-right capsule-
shaped button. You can also customize this toolbar—and you should—by dragging onto it the 
icons of the System Preferences panels you use the most.

8.1 The System Preferences Window
 
G     Fastest: Click the icon you want, if it's there, on the System Preferences toolbar. And why shouldn't it be there? By 
all means, stash the panels you use most frequently up there, as shown in Figure 8-1.

8.2 .Mac
This panel is of no value unless you've signed up for a .Mac account (see Chapter 18). It offers two tabs:
G     .Mac. This is where you fill in your member name and password for your .Mac account, if you've subscribed. (See 
Chapter 18 for a full discussion of these accounts.) If you're not yet a member, you can click the Sign Up button to 
get started.
G     iDisk. The Disk Space graph indicates how full your electronic iDisk is. (And if it approaches your limit of 100 MB, a 
Buy More button lets you pay Apple for the privilege of gaining more storage.) The Your Public Folder controls let 
you specify whether or not other people are allowed to put new files into your Public folder (Section 18.9.2.3), and 
whether or not outsiders need a password to see what's in your Public folder. Much more detail on these topics in 
Chapter 18.

8.3 Accounts
This is the master list of people who are allowed to log into your Mac. It's where you can adjust their passwords, startup 
pictures, self-opening startup items, permissions to use various features of the Mac, and other security features. All of this 
is described in Chapter 11.
NOSTALGIA CORNER
Where to Specify Your Preferred Mail and Browser Programs
Hey! Where the heck do I specify what browser I want to open when I click a link in, say, an email message? 
It used to be in the Internet panel of System Preferences, but that panel doesn't exist anymore! 
You're right. The Internet panel has been reborn in Panther as the .Mac panel, and the places where you set 
up your preferred email and Web programs have gone off to the great software company in the sky.
This is going to sound a little odd, but you specify which browser you want to use by opening the Safari 
browser that came with Mac OS X, choosing Safari
Preferences, clicking the General tab, and then using 
the Default Web Browser pop-up menu at the top.
You specify your preferred email program the same way, but in Mail instead of Safari.
Yes, it's a bit peculiar that you have to visit Safari even if you want to specify that you don't want to use Safari, 
and you have to open Mail to opt out of using Mail. But at least you probably won't have to make these 
changes more than once.

8.4 Appearance
After—what's it been, 20 years?—of calling this panel General, somebody at Apple finally realized it's mostly about how 
things look on the screen: windows, menus, buttons, scroll bars, and fonts. So in Panther, it's the same stuff on a renamed 
panel.
Nothing you find here lets you perform any radical surgery on the Aqua interface—the overall Mac OS X look stays the 
same—but you can tweak certain settings to match your personal style.
8.4.1 Changing Colors
Two pop-up menus let you crank up or tone down Mac OS X's overall colorfulness:
G     Appearance. Choose between Blue or Graphite. Blue refers to Mac OS X's factory setting—bright, candy-colored 
scroll-bar handles, progress bars, 
 menu, and pulsing OK buttons—and those shiny red, yellow, and green 
buttons in the corner of every window. If you, like some graphics professionals, find all of this circusposter coloring 
a bit distracting, then choose Graphite, which renders all of those interface elements in various shades of gray.
G     Highlight color. When you drag your cursor across text, its background changes color to indicate that you've 
selected it. Exactly what color the background becomes is up to you—just choose the shade you want using the 
pop-up menu. (The Highlight color also affects such subtleties as the lines on the inside of a window as you drag 
an icon into it.)
If you choose Other, the Color Picker palette appears, from which you can choose any color your Mac is capable of 
displaying (Section 4.10.4).
8.4.2 Tweaking the Scroll Bars
These radio buttons control the scroll-bar arrow buttons of all your windows. You can keep these arrows together at one 
end of the scroll bar, or you can split them up so that the "up" arrow sits at the top of the scroll bar, and the "down" arrow is 
at the bottom. (Horizontal scroll bars are similarly affected.) For details on the "Jump to the next page" and "Scroll to here" 
options, see Section 1.2.9.

8.4 Appearance
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Toolbar Tip-O-Rama
Hint and tip lovers, rejoice! The System Preferences toolbar is just loaded with goofy little secrets.
For example, you can rearrange the toolbar icons (except Show All) by dragging horizontally, or remove one 
by dragging it directly away from the toolbar. On the other hand, you can hide the toolbar altogether (to 
maximize your screen space) by clicking the white oval button in the window's upper- right corner. At that 
point, you switch among different System Preferences panes by using the View menu, or the System 
Preferences pop-up icon in the Dock.
Similarly, if you 
-click that "hide toolbar" button, you cycle between six possible toolbar styles. With each 
click, the icons get smaller, the text labels get smaller, and finally the icons disappear altogether, leaving only 
a row of tiny text labels.
At the largest icon size, you have room for about seven or eight icons in the toolbar. In the smallest icon-only 
view, you can fit at least twelve to fifteen icons in the same horizontal space. (It defeats the purpose of putting 
them in the toolbar in the first place, but it looks really neat.)
Miss the days when only both arrows appeared at both ends of the scroll bar? You can make 
Mac OS X work that way, too. You just need a moment alone with TinkerTool, described in 
Section 17.1.
You can also turn on one or both of these checkboxes:
G     Use smooth scrolling. This option affects only one tiny situation: When you click (or hold the cursor down) inside 
the empty area of the scroll bar (not on the handle, and not on the arrow buttons). And it makes only one tiny 
change: Instead of jumping abruptly from screenful to screenful, the window lurches with slight accelerations and 
decelerations, so that the paragraph you're eyeing never jumps suddenly out of view.
G     Minimize when double clicking a window title bar. This option provides another way to minimize a window. In 
addition to the tiny yellow Minimize button at the upper-left corner of the window, you now have a much bigger 
target—the entire title bar.
8.4.3 Number of Recent Items
Just how many of your recently opened documents and applications do you want the Mac to show using the Recent Items 
command in the 
 menu? Pick a number from the pop-up menus. (You'll probably find that 5 is too few; 30 is more 
practical.)
8.4.4 Font Smoothing Style
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-4.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:12 AM

8.4 Appearance
The Mac's built-in text-smoothing (antialiasing) feature is supposed to produce smoother, more commercial-looking text 
anywhere it appears on your Mac: in word processing documents, email messages, Web pages, and so on. Yet one of the 
most common complaints about Mac OS X is that it actually makes text look blurry to people who aren't used to the effect.
Fortunately, you can control the degree to which text gets smoothed. Use the pop-up menu to choose a setting that suits 
your eyes—and your monitor. For example, Apple suggests Standard for CRT (cathode ray tube) screens (that is, 
traditional, bulky, television-style screens), and Medium for flat-panel screens like laptops and almost all current desktop 
Macs.
Either way, the differences are fairly subtle (see Figure 8-2). Furthermore, unlike most System Preferences, this one has no 
effect until the next time you open the program in question. In the Finder, for example, you won't notice the difference until 
you log out and log back in again.
8.4.5 Turning Off Smoothing on Tiny Fonts
At smaller type sizes, such as 10-point and smaller, you might find that text is actually less readable with font smoothing 
turned on. It all depends upon the font, the size, and your taste. For that reason, the Size pop-up menu lets you choose a 
cutoff point for font smoothing. If you choose 12 from this pop-up menu, for example, then 12-point (and smaller) type still 
appears crisp and sharp; only larger type, such as headlines, displays the graceful edge smoothing.
Top: The same 12-point type with text smoothing turned on (top) and off, shown magnified for 
your inspection pleasure.
Bottom: Here's the widest difference in text-smoothing styles: Light smoothing vs. Strong. 
Standard and Medium, of course, are in between.

8.4 Appearance
 
Mac OS X fans will be delighted to discover that, in Panther, you can choose a size cutoff as low as 4 points. Note that 
none of the settings affect your printouts, only the onscreen display.

8.5 Bluetooth
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.5 Bluetooth
This panel shows up only if your Mac is equipped with a Bluetooth transmitter, either built-in or in the form of an external 
USB gadget. The thrill of using Bluetooth to send files is described in detail in Section 6.2.5, but here's a quick overview of 
this panel's three tabs:
G     Settings. Here's where you make your Mac discoverable (that is, "visible" to other Bluetooth gadgets), specify 
whether or not a password is required, and indicate whether or not you'd like your wireless data to be encrypted 
(presumably so that the Russian spies who've been tailing you won't be able to intercept your transmitted files 
using sophisticated interception equipment). You also get a Turn Bluetooth Off button, so that, when your laptop 
has nothing to communicate with, it can save the trickle of power it would otherwise use to power the transmitter.
G     File Exchange. Here, you can indicate what you want to happen when someone shoots a document your way: 
accept it, refuse it, or ask what to do. You can similarly indicate what you want your Mac to do when someone 
sends you a "business card" from their copies of the Mac OS X address book (by choosing Card
Send This 
Card).
Finally, if you turn on "Allow other devices to browse files on this computer," you're saying that it's OK for other Mac 
fans to burrow through whatever you've put into your Shared folder (Section 11.5.3) when they create a tiny, 
impromptu network using Bluetooth.
G     Devices. The whole point of Bluetooth is hooking up—with phones, other Macs, wireless keyboards, whatever. 
Here's where you introduce other Bluetooth equipment to your Mac. Click Set Up New Device to fire up the 
Bluetooth Setup Assistant, which scouts the local airwaves for Bluetooth gear in your vicinity and lets you add them 
to your Mac's list.
Where security is an issue—like when you plan to use your Bluetooth cellphone as a wireless Internet antenna for 
your PowerBook, and you'd just as soon not have other people in the airport waiting lounge surfing the Web via 
your cellphone—you can also click Pair New Device. To prove that you're really the owner of both the laptop and 
the phone, you're asked to make up a one-time password, which you have 60 seconds to type into both the Mac 
and the phone. Once that's done, you're free to use the phone's Internet connection without any further muss, fuss, 
or passwords.

8.6 CDs & DVDs
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.6 CDs & DVDs
This handy panel (Figure 8-3) lets you tell the Mac what it should do when it detects the insertion of a CD or DVD. For 
example, when you insert a music CD, you probably want iTunes (Chapter 10) to open automatically so that you can listen 
to the CD or convert its musical contents to MP3 files on your hard drive. Similarly, when you insert a picture CD (such as a 
Kodak Photo CD), you probably want iPhoto to open in readiness to import the pictures from the CD into your photo 
collection. And when you insert a DVD from Blockbuster, you want the Mac's DVD Player program to open.
You can tell the Mac exactly which program to launch when you insert each kind of disc, or tell 
it to do nothing at all.
 
For each kind of disc (blank CD, blank DVD, music CD, picture CD, or video DVD), the pop-up menu lets you choose 
options like these:
G     Ask what to do. A dialog box will appear that asks what you want to do with the newly inserted disc.
G     Open (iDVD, iTunes, iPhoto, DVD Player...). The Mac can open a certain program automatically when you insert 
the disc. When the day comes that somebody writes a better music player than iTunes, or a better digital shoebox 
than iPhoto, you can use the "Open other application" option.
G     Run script. If you've become handy writing AppleScript programs (Chapter 7), you can schedule one of your own 
scripts to take over from here. For example, you can set things up so that inserting a blank CD automatically copies 
your Home folder onto it for backup purposes.
G     Ignore. The Mac won't do anything when you insert a disc (except to display its icon on the desktop).

POWER USERS' CLINIC
System Preferences: Under the Hood
The entire System Preferences program is nothing more than a series of graphical front ends for underlying 
Unix settings. (If you know Unix and feel so inclined, in fact, you can bypass the System Preferences panel 
completely. Using the defaults command, you can use Mac OS X's Terminal program to make any of the 
changes described in this chapter—and many others.)
The individual preference panels are represented by package icons (Section 4.2) in your various Library 
folders. For example, icons in the basic Mac OS X set are in System
Library
 PreferencePanes. Mac 
OS X also checks the Network
 Library
PreferencePanes folder, if there is one, when it decides 
which icons to include in System Preferences.
You can easily expand System Preferences by simply dropping new pane modules into your 
Home
Library
 PreferencePanes folder (or running downloaded installers that do just that). The 
beauty of this arrangement, of course, is that everyone who shares a Mac now can see a different assortment 
of customized preference panes.
Or, if you're an administrator, you can generate a PreferencePanes folder in the Mac's main Library folder, so 
that everyone with an account on the Mac (Chapter 11) will be able to access your newly added panels.
When you download and install a new System Preferences pane like TinkerTool or TiVo Desktop, it takes the 
form of a new icon in one of those four PreferencePanes folders. That's good to know when the day comes 
that you want to remove one of these add-on panes.
Within the System Preferences program, any new panes you add in this way appear in a new row of icons 
labeled Other.

8.8 Date & Time
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.8 Date & Time
Your Mac's conception of what time it is can be very important. Every file you create or save is stamped with this time, and 
every email you send or receive is marked with this time. As you might expect, setting your Mac's clock is what the Date & 
Time panel is all about.
8.8.1 Date & Time tab
Click the Date & Time tab. If your Mac is online, turn on "Set Date & Time automatically," and be done with it. Your Mac 
sets its own clock by consulting a highly accurate scientific clock on the Internet. (No need to worry about Daylight Savings 
Time, either, as the time servers take that into account.)
If you have a full-time Internet connection (cable modem or DSL, for example), you may as 
well leave this checkbox turned on, so that your Mac's clock is always correct. If you connect 
to the Internet by modem, however, turn off the checkbox, so that your Mac won't keep trying 
to dial spontaneously at all hours of the night.
If you're not online and have no prospect of getting there, you can also set the date and time manually. To change the 
month, day, or year, click the digit that needs changing and then either type a new number or click the little arrow buttons. 
Press the Tab key to highlight the next number. (You can also specify the day of the month by clicking a date on the mini 
calendar.)
To set the time of day, use the same technique—or, for more geeky fun, you can set the time by dragging the hour, minute, 
or second hands on the analog clock. Finally, click Save. (If you get carried away with dragging the clock hands around and 
lose track of the real time, just click the Revert button to restore the panel settings.)
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Your Free Time-Difference Calculator
You can use the Time Zone pane of the Date &Time panel to calculate the exact time difference between any 
two points on earth. To do this, you must have the Time Zone pane open and your menu bar clock turned on—
set to View as Text, with a digital readout. (See the discussion of the menu bar clock in this chapter.)
To calculate a time difference, make a note of the current time shown in the menu bar, with the Time Zone 
correctly set to your own zone. Now click your way across the Time Zone map. With each click, notice that the 
time in the menu bar changes, updating itself as you cross from time zone to time zone. By comparing the 
original time on your menu bar with the new time that appears when you've finished clicking, you can easily 
determine the time difference.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-8.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:21 AM

8.8 Date & Time
If you're frustrated that the Mac is showing you the 24-hour "military time" on your menu bar 
(that is, 17:30 instead of 5:30 PM)—or it isn't showing military time when you'd like it to—click 
the Clock tab button and turn "Use a 24-hour clock" on or off.
Note, however, that this affects only the menu bar clock. If you'd like to reformat the menu 
bar clock and all other dates (like the ones that show when your files were modified in list 
views), click the Open International button at the bottom of the Date & Time pane. Once 
there, click the Formats tab button. There you'll see a Customize button for Times, which 
leads you to "24-hour clock" and "12-hour clock" options.
8.8.2 Time Zone tab
You'd be surprised how important it is to set the Time Zone for your Mac. If you don't do so, the email and documents you 
send out—and the Mac's conception of what documents are older and newer—could be hopelessly skewed. Teach your 
Mac where it lives using the Time Zone map, as shown in Figure 8-4.
Setting the Time Zone is a two-step process. In the Time Zone pane, click on a section of the 
map to select a general region of the world, and then use the pop-up menu to specify your 
country within that region. (Or, instead of using the pop-up menu with the mouse, you can also 
highlight the text in the Closest City box. Then start typing your city name until the Mac gets 
the idea.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-8.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:21 AM

8.8 Date & Time
 
8.8.3 Clock tab
In the Clock pane, you can specify whether or not you want the current time to appear, at all times, at the right end of your 
menu bar, or even in a small floating window, whose transparency you can control with the slider here. You can choose 
between two different clock styles: digital (3:53 PM) or analog (a round clock face). If you go the View as Text route, you get 
several other options that govern this digital clock display: whether or not you want to include designations for AM and PM, 
the display of seconds, the day of the week, and a blinking colon.
At the bottom of the dialog box, you'll find a new Panther feature called "Announce the time." 
At the intervals you specify, the Mac will speak, out loud, the current time: "It's ten o'clock." If 
you tend to get so immersed in "working" that you lose track of time, Mac OS X just removed 
your last excuse.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-8.html (3 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:21 AM

8.8 Date & Time
And by the way, your menu bar clock always shows the current time. When you need to know today's date, just click the 
clock. A menu drops down revealing the complete date. The menu also lets you switch between digital and analog clock 
types and provides a shortcut to the Date & Time panel in System Preferences.
Attention Unix geeks: You can also set the date and time from within Terminal (Chapter 15). 
Use sudo (Section 15.1), type date yyyymmddhhmm.ss, and press Enter. (Of course, replace 
that code with the actual date and time you want, such as 200404051755.00 for April 5, 
2004, 5:55 p.m.) You might find this method faster than the System Preferences method.

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
This panel represents the mating of two separate panels called Desktop and Screen Effects from Mac OS X 10.2. But they 
still do the same thing:
G     Desktop lets you dress up your desktop with the background image of your choice. You can choose from one of 
the several dozen background pictures that come with Mac OS X or use your own pictures. In fact, you can even 
schedule these background pictures to change automatically at regular intervals—an essential feature for the easily 
bored.
G     Screen Saver controls the Mac OS X screen saver—the wild, animated light show that appears on your screen to 
protect its contents when you've wandered away for a cup of coffee.
NOSTALGIA CORNER 
You Say Screen Saver, I Say Screen Effects
Hey, in the last edition of this book, you made a big deal about how Apple called it Screen Effects instead of 
Screen Saver, because in this era of flat-panel monitors and dramatically improved CRT monitors, screen 
burn-in is a thing of the past. You said that Apple called it Screen Effects because these days, "Screen savers 
are mostly about entertainment, pure and simple." So how come it's back to being called Screen Saver, hot 
shot? 
Who knows what secrets lurk in the hearts of Apple programmers?
In this case, the secret probably was this: Most people call these displays screen savers no matter what the 
logic.
So Apple went with the flow.
8.9.1 Desktop
Mac OS X comes with several ready-to-use collections of desktop pictures, ranging from National Geographic-style nature 
photos to plain solid colors. To install a new background picture, first choose one of the image categories in the list at the 
left side of the window, as shown in Figure 8-5. Your choices include Apple Background Images (muted, soft-focused 
swishes and swirls), Nature (plants, bugs, water), Abstract (swishes and swirls with wild colors), or Solid Colors (boring 
grays, blues, and greens).
NOTE
Several of Apple's ready-to-use desktop pictures come in two sizes. The elongated versions (with the flatter, 
squashed-down thumbnails) are designed to perfectly fill the extra-wide screens on 15- and 17-inch 
PowerBooks, Apple Cinema Displays, and other unusually wide screens.

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
8.9.1.1 Using your own pix
Of course, you may feel that decorating your Mac desktop is much more fun if you use one of your own pictures. You can 
use any digital photo, scanned image, or graphic you want in almost any graphics format (JPEG, PICT, GIF, TIFF, PDF, or 
Photoshop).
That's why your own Pictures folder is also listed here. If you use iPhoto to manage your digital camera shots, you'll 
welcome the appearance of the Photo Library, Last Import, and iPhoto album icons here, too.
Using the list of picture sources at left, you can preview an entire folder of your own images 
before installing one specific image as your new desktop picture. Use the Choose Folder option 
to select a folder of assorted graphics—or, if you're an iPhoto veteran, click an iPhoto album 
name, as shown here. Clicking one of the thumbnails installs the corresponding picture on the 
desktop.

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
 
In any case, when you click one of these icons, you see thumbnail versions of its contents in the main screen to its right. 
Just click the thumbnail of any picture to apply it immediately to the desktop. (There's no need to remove the previously 
installed picture, because picking a new picture automatically replaces the old one.)
If there's one certain picture you like, but it's not in any of the listed sources, just drag the 
image file itself onto the well (the mini desktop displayed in the Desktop panel). A thumbnail 
of your picture instantly appears in the well and, a moment later, the picture is plastered 
across your monitor.
8.9.1.2 Making the picture fit
No matter which source you use to choose a photo of your own, you have one more issue to deal with. Unless you've gone 
to the trouble of editing your chosen photo so that it matches the precise dimensions of your screen (1024 x 768 pixels, for 
example), it probably isn't exactly the same size as your screen.
The top 23 pixels of your graphic will be hidden by the menu bar—something to remember 
when you prepare the graphic.
Fortunately, Mac OS X offers a number of solutions to this problem. Using the popup menu just to the right of the desktop 
preview well, you can choose any of these options:
G     Fill screen. This option enlarges or reduces the image so that it fills every inch of the desktop. If the image is 
small, the low-resolution stretching can look awful. Conversely, if the image is large and its dimensions don't 
precisely match your screen, parts get chopped off. At least this option never distorts the picture, as the "Stretch" 
option does (below).
G     Stretch to fill screen. Use this option at your peril, since it makes your picture fit the screen exactly, come hell or 
high water. Unfortunately, larger pictures may be squished vertically or horizontally as necessary, and small 
pictures are drastically blown up and squished, usually with grisly-looking results.
G     Center. This command centers the photo neatly on the screen. If the picture is larger than the screen, you see only 
the middle; the edges of the picture are chopped off as they extend beyond your screen.
But if the picture is smaller than the screen, it doesn't fill the entire background; instead it just sits right smack in the 
center of the monitor at actual size. Of course, this leaves a swath of empty border all the way around your screen. 
As a remedy, Apple provides a color-swatch button next to the pop-up menu (also shown in Figure 8-5). When you 
click it, the Color Picker appears (Section 4.10.4), so that you can specify the color in which to frame your little 
picture.
G     Tile. This option makes your picture repeat over and over until the multiple images fill the entire monitor. (If your 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-9.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 4:53:24 AM

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
picture is larger than the screen, no such tiling takes place. You see only the top center chunk of the image.)
8.9.1.3 Auto-picture changing
The novelty of any desktop picture, no matter how interesting, is likely to fade after several months of all-day viewing. That's 
why Panther's randomizing function is so delightful.
Turn on "Change picture" at the bottom of the dialog box. From the pop-up menu, specify when you want your background 
picture to change: "every day," "every 15 minutes," or, if you're really having trouble staying awake at your Mac, "every 5 
seconds." (The option called "when waking from sleep" refers to the Mac waking from sleep, not its owner.)
Finally, turn on "Random order," if you like. (If you leave it off, your desktop pictures will change in alphabetical order by file 
name.)
That's all there is to it. Now, at the intervals you specified, your desktop picture changes automatically, smoothly 
crossfading between the pictures in your chosen source folder like a slideshow. You may never want to open another 
window, because you'll hate to block your own view of the show.
8.9.2 Screen Saver
On the Screen Saver panel, you can create your own screen-saver slideshows—an absolute must if you have an Apple 
Cinema Display and a cool Manhattan loft apartment.
Apple provides a few displays to get you started:
G     Computer Name. This display shows nothing more than the Apple logo and the computer's name, faintly displayed 
on the monitor. (These elements shift position every few minutes—it just isn't very fast.) Apple probably imagined 
that this feature would let corporate supervisors glance over at the screens of unattended Macs to find out who's 
not at their desks.
G     Flurry. You get flaming, colorful, undulating arms of fire, which resemble a cross between an octopus and 
somebody arc welding in the dark. If you click the Options button, you can even control how many streams of fire 
appear at once, the thickness of the arms, the speed of movement, and the colors.
G     Abstract, Beach, Cosmos, Forest. These are photographic screen savers, featuring gorgeous pictures that slowly 
zoom and softly cross-fade into each other. Abstract features psychedelic swirls of modern art. In the Beach, 
Cosmos, and Forest screen savers, you see a series of tropical ocean scenes, deep space objects, and lush rain 
forests, respectively.
Each creates an amazingly dramatic, almost cinematic experience, worthy of setting up to "play" during dinner 
parties like the lava lamps of the Seventies.
G     .Mac. One of the perks for paying $100 per year for a .Mac membership is the ability to create slideshows online, 
which can play back either on your own Mac or (if you opted to make it public) on anybody else's. Yes, that's right: 
You can now enjoy a screen saver composed of photos taken by somebody else on the Internet ("Oh, look, honey, 
here's some shots of Uncle Jed's crops this summer!").
Click the Options button to specify which member's slideshow collection you want to view and how you want it to 
appear. (For example, you can turn off the crossfade between slides, crop the slides so that they fit on the screen, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-9.html (4 of 7)5/3/2004 4:53:24 AM

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
opt to present the slides in random order, and so on.)
G     Pictures Folder, Choose Folder. This is one of the coolest modules. It lets you transform your own collection of 
pictures—whatever you've got in your Home
 Pictures folder—into a self-playing slideshow, complete with 
spectacular zooming and dissolving effects. (If you keep your photos elsewhere, click Choose Folder instead.)
G     Photo Library, Last Import, album list. If you're using iPhoto to organize your digital photos, you'll see its familiar 
album list here, making it a snap to choose any of your own photo collections for use as a screen saver. It's a very 
nice touch in Panther.
G     Random. If you can't decide which one of the modules to use, click Random. The Mac will choose a different 
module each time your screen saver kicks in.
When you click a module's name in the Screen Savers list, you see a mini version of it playing in the Preview screen. Click 
Test to give the module a dry run on your full monitor screen.
When you've had enough of the preview, just click the mouse or press any key. You return to the Screen Saver panel.
8.9.2.1 Activating the screen saver
You can control when your screen saver takes over your monitor in a couple of ways:
G     After a period of inactivity. Using the "Start screen saver" slider, you can set the amount of time that has to pass 
without keyboard or mouse activity before the screen saver starts. The duration can be as short as three minutes or 
as long as two hours, or you can drag the slider to Never to prevent the screen saver from ever turning on by itself.
GEM IN THE ROUGH 
Secrets of the Screen Saver Modules
The canned screen saver modules are stored in your System
 Library
Screen Savers folder. If you 
Control-click one of the icons inside and choose Show Package Contents from the contextual menu, you'll 
find a Contents
Resources folder that contains the individual JPEG files for each module (the outer space 
photos for the Cosmos screen saver, for example).
Why bother? Because some of these spectacular photos make really good desktop pictures. You're free to 
copy them out of the Resources folder for that purpose.
G     When you park your cursor in the corner of the screen. If you click the Hot Corners button, you'll see that you 
can turn each corner of your monitor into a hot corner (see Figure 8-6).

8.9 Desktop & Screen Saver
Click the Hot Corners button to open this "sheet," which lets you designate certain corners of 
your screen as instant-activation spots, or never-come-on spots. Sliding the mouse to the Start 
Screen Saver corner, for example, turns on your screen saver right away. (You can use the 
remaining corners to control Exposé, as described in Section 4.3.)

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION 
The Password-Protected Screen Saver
I like the fact that when I wander away from my desk, the screen saver protects whatever I was doing from 
prying eyes. But whoever walks by can just press a key to exit the screen saver, so big deal! I looked all over, 
and couldn't find any way to make the Mac require a password before exiting the screen saver. 
You had the right idea—you were just looking in the wrong place.
In System Preferences, click the new Panther icon called Security. There's the checkbox you're looking for: 
"Require password to wake this computer from sleep or screen saver."

8.10 Displays
Displays is the center of operations for all your monitor settings. Here, you set your monitor's resolution, determine how 
many colors are displayed onscreen, and calibrate color balance and brightness.
On a laptop, you can open up this panel with a quick keystroke from anywhere on the Mac. 
Just press Option as you tap one of the screen-brightness keys (F1 or F2) on the top row of 
your keyboard.
The specific controls you'll see here depend on the kind of monitor you're using, but here are the ones you'll most likely see:
8.10.1 Display Tab
This tab is the main headquarters for your screen controls. It governs these settings:
G     Resolutions. All Mac screens today can make the screen picture larger or smaller, thus accommodating different 
kinds of work. You perform this magnification or reduction by switching among different resolutions (measurements 
of the number of dots that compose the screen). The Resolutions list displays the various resolution settings your 
monitor can accommodate: 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, and so on (Figure 8-7). 
When you use a low-resolution setting, such as 800 x 600, the dots of your screen image get larger, thus enlarging 
(zooming in on) the picture, but revealing a smaller slice of the page. Use this setting when playing a small 
QuickTime movie, for example, so that it fills more of the screen. At higher resolutions (such as 1024 x 768), the 
screen dots get smaller, making your windows and icons smaller, but showing more overall area. Use this kind of 
setting when working on two-page spreads in your page-layout program, for example. (Lower resolutions usually 
look blurry on flat-panel screens, though.)
In the early days of Macintosh, higher color settings required a sacrifice in speed, since it took 
the Mac time to compute the color for each of thousands of individual dots that make up the 
screen image. Today, however, there's very little downside to leaving your screen at its 
maximum depth setting ("Millions" of colors). Photos, in particular, look best when your 
monitor is set to higher depth settings. (The Detect Displays button appears primarily on 
laptops; it means, "Check to see if I've attached an external monitor or projector.")
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-10.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:27 AM

8.10 Displays
 
G     Colors. Today's Mac monitors offer different color depth settings, each of which permits the screen to display a 
different number of colors simultaneously. The Colors pop-up menu generally offers only three choices: 256 Colors, 
Thousands, and Millions.
You can still make your monitor grayscale (shades of gray), even if no choice for it appears 
here. The trick is to visit the Universal Access panel, described later in this chapter.
G     Refresh Rate. If you have a choice here at all, this pop-up menu lets you adjust how many times per second your 
screen image is repainted by your monitor's electron gun. (You may not see this pop-up menu if you have a flat-
panel screen.) Choose a setting that minimizes flicker.
G     Brightness, Contrast. Use these sliders to make the screen look good in the prevailing lighting conditions. You'll 
usually want the Contrast control all the way up—if you have it at all (flat-panel screens usually don't)—and 
Brightness near the middle.

8.10 Displays
Of course, most Apple keyboards have brightness-adjustment keys, so these software controls are included just for 
completeness' sake.
You can adjust the color depth and resolution of your monitor without having to open System 
Preferences. Just turn on "Show displays in menu bar," which adds a Monitors pop-up menu 
(a menulet-Section 3.6) to the right end of your menu bar for quick adjustments.
8.10.2 Geometry Tab
This pane appears only on Macs with built-in, non-flat screens—for the most part, that means eMacs and the older, fruit-
colored iMacs. It lets you adjust the position, size, and angle of the screen image on the glass itself—controls that can be 
useful in counteracting distortion in aging monitors.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Blurry Flat-Panel Screens
Yucko! I tried the 800 x 600 setting on my 2001 iBook, and everything got all blurry and fuzzy! How do I fix it? 
On any flat-panel screen—not just laptop screens—only one resolution setting looks really great: the 
maximum one. That's what geeks call the native resolution of that screen.
That's because on flat-panel screens, every pixel is a fixed size. At lower resolutions, the Mac does what it 
can to blur together adjacent pixels, but the effect is fuzzy and unsatisfying. (On a bulky, CRT monitor, the 
electron gun can actually make the pixels larger or smaller, so you don't have this problem.)
Don't miss the opportunity to eliminate the black borders around your screen perimeter! 
That's just wasted space. Click the Height/Width button. Then click the "expand vertical" and 
"expand horizontal" buttons at the lower-right corner of the miniature monitor image until 
you've eliminated the black borders around the screen. (You'll probably have to recenter the 
whole picture, too.)
8.10.3 Arrange Tab
From the dawn of the color-monitor era, Macs have had a terrific feature: the ability to exploit multiple monitors all plugged 
into the computer at the same time. Some Macs can project the same thing on both screens (mirror mode), which is useful 
in a classroom. A few lucky models permit one monitor to act as an extension of the next. For example, you might have 
your Photoshop image window on your big monitor, but keep all the Photoshop controls and tool palettes on a smaller 
screen. In this case, your cursor passes from one screen to another as it crosses the boundary.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-10.html (3 of 4)5/3/2004 4:53:27 AM

8.10 Displays
To bring about this delicious arrangement, you need a Mac with a video output jack. (All current Mac laptops have one, as 
do iMacs and eMacs. And with the installation of additional video cards, you can have three or even more monitors all going 
at once.) You don't have to shut down the Mac to hook up another monitor—just put it to sleep.
When you open System Preferences, you see a different Displays window on each screen, so that you can change the 
color and resolution settings independently for each. Your Displays menulet shows two sets of resolutions, too, one for 
each screen.
If your Mac can show different images on each screen, your Displays panel offers an Arrange tab, displaying a miniature 
version of each monitor. By dragging these icons around relative to each other, you can specify how you want the second 
monitor's image "attached" to the first. Most people position the second monitor to the right of the first, but you're also free 
to position it on the left, above, below, or even directly on top of the first monitor's icon (the last of which produces a video-
mirroring setup). For the least likelihood of going insane, consider placing the real-world monitor into the corresponding 
position—to the right of your first monitor, for example.
For committed multiple-monitor fanatics, the fun doesn't stop there. See the microscopic menu bar on the first-monitor icon? 
You can drag that tiny strip onto a different monitor icon, if you like, to tell Displays where you'd like the menu bar to appear. 
(And check out how most screen savers correctly show different stuff on each monitor!)
8.10.4 Color Tab
The Color pane lets you choose an accurate ColorSync profile for your screen (Section 13.8), and lets you calibrate it for 
correct color display.
When you click Calibrate, the Display Calibrator Assistant opens to walk you through a series of six screens, presenting 
various brightness and color-balance settings in each screen. Pick the settings that look best to you; at the end of the 
process, you save your monitor tweaks as a ColorSync profile (Section 13.8) that ColorSync-savvy programs can use to 
adjust your display for improved color accuracy.

8.12 Energy Saver
The Energy Saver program helps you and your Mac in a number of ways. By blackening the screen after a period of 
inactivity, it prolongs the life of your monitor. By putting the Mac to sleep half an hour after you've stopped using it, Energy 
Saver cuts down on electricity costs and pollution. On a laptop, Energy Saver extends the length of the battery charge by 
controlling the activity of the hard drive and screen.
Top: Here's what Energy Saver looks like in its expanded condition on a laptop. (On a desktop 
machine, it's far simpler.) If you turn on the "Put the display to sleep" option, you can specify 
an independent sleep time for the screen.
Bottom: Here's the relevant slice of the Schedule tab—a welcome return of the Mac's self-
scheduling abilities.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-12.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 4:53:32 AM

8.12 Energy Saver
 
Best of all, an old friend is back, to the joy of longtime Mac veterans: The option to have your computer turn off each night 
automatically, and turn on again at a speci- fied time in anticipation of your arrival at the desk.
8.12.1 Sleep Tab
The Energy Saver controls are very different on a laptop Mac and a desktop Mac.
On a desktop Mac, you see a pair of sliders; on a laptop, you have to click Show Details to see them (Figure 8-8).
In any case, the top slider controls when the Mac will automatically go to sleep—anywhere from one minute after your last 
activity to Never. (Activity can be mouse movement, keyboard action, or Internet data transfer; Energy Saver won't put your 
Mac to sleep in the middle of a download.)
At that time, the screen goes dark, the hard drive stops spinning, and your processor chip slows to a crawl. Your Mac is 
now in sleep mode, using only a fraction of its usual electricity consumption. To wake it up when you return to your desk, 
press any key. Everything you were working on, including open programs and documents, is still onscreen, exactly as it 
was. (To turn off this automatic sleep feature entirely, drag the slider to Never.)
NOTE
On Macs of old, the beauty of the independent "Put the display to sleep" slider was that you could make the 
screen go dark before the Mac itself. That way, the Mac would awaken instantly when you touched a key or 
clicked the mouse.
In Mac OS X, the Mac always wakes instantly from sleep—one of the great payoffs of Mac OS X. In short, 
there's very little reason to set the screen to sleep independently of the Mac itself.
Finally, "Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible" saves even more juice—and noise—by letting your drives stop 
spinning when not in use. The downside is a longer pause when you return to work and wake the thing up, because it takes 
a few seconds for your hard drive to "spin up" again.
8.12.2 Laptop Options
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-12.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 4:53:32 AM

8.12 Energy Saver
As noted above, Energy Saver on a laptop offers quite a few additional controls see(Figure 8-8). That's because power 
management is ten times more important on a laptop, where every drop of battery power counts.
The Optimize Energy Settings pop-up menu, for example, offers several canned Energy Saver settings, appropriate for 
several common laptop situations:
G     Automatic detects whether or not the laptop is plugged into a power outlet. If so, it switches you to Highest 
Performance mode, described next. But if you're running on battery power, it switches automatically to Longest 
Battery Life. Most of the time, this is exactly what you want: high-speed when you're safely plugged into the wall, 
and best battery life when you're working at 39,000 feet.
G     Highest Performance sets both sliders to Never, so that you won't be inconvenienced by the screen going dark. It 
also turns off the "Put the hard disk(s) to sleep" checkbox, so that you'll never need to wait while the hard drive 
spins up after going to sleep. (The settings also turn on all three checkboxes on the Options tab, as described 
below, so that the laptop will be turned on and awake whenever possible.)
G     Longest Battery Life puts the screen to sleep after one minute of inactivity, puts the laptop itself to sleep after five 
minutes, and puts the hard disk to sleep whenever possible. All of this is designed to ensure that the machine uses 
as little juice as possible whenever you wander away—even if it's only for a minute.
Although there's no visual indication, this option also slows down your processor to save power.
G     DVD Playback keeps the screen on, keeps the laptop awake, and keeps the DVD drive going—but stops the hard 
drive from spinning whenever possible. (Technically, you don't need your hard drive when you're playing a DVD.) 
After all, when you're watching a movie, the last thing you want is the screen blinking off just as Schwarzenegger 
reaches the top of the skyscraper. This is still a pretty power-hungry arrangement, but not quite as bad as Highest 
Performance.
GEM IN THE ROUGH 
Mysteries of the Battery Menulet
If you've got a laptop, don't miss the checkbox in Energy Saver called "Show battery status in the menu bar." 
It puts a fantastically handy status indicator in the menu bar that keeps you informed of your battery's life.
When used as a menu, this menulet lets you choose between displaying the actual number of minutes left 
until a battery is depleted, the percentage of battery life that remains, or a visual emptying-battery icon.
If you've opted to view the numeric version, you may notice that sometimes the number, or the percentage, is 
in parentheses, like this: (78%). That's your signal that the laptop is plugged in and charging; you're seeing 
the number of minutes left until the battery is fully recharged (or the percentage of full charge you've achieved 
so far). Either way, the readout is counting down to that glorious moment.
If you're viewing only the battery icon in the menu bar, here's what the readouts mean:
Power-cord-in-the-battery: The laptop is plugged in, and the battery is 100% charged. Ready to roll, captain!
Lightning-bolt-in-the-battery: The laptop is plugged in, but the battery is still charging.
Superimposed X: The laptop is plugged in, but the battery isn't in right, it's missing, or it isn't getting a charge 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-12.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 4:53:32 AM

8.12 Energy Saver
for some other reason.
Emptying black battery: The laptop is running off of battery power, and has at least 25 percent power left. 
(The width of the bar reveals how much charge is left.)
Emptying red battery: You're running off of battery power, and you have less than 25 percent charge 
remaining.
A nearly invisible red bar means you have less than nine minutes left. Save those documents, buddy.
 
G     Presentations is exactly the same as DVD Playback, except that it doesn't keep the DVD drive spinning.
G     Custom just means "none of the above." Whenever you adjust one of the sliders or checkboxes, Energy Saver 
automatically changes the pop-up menu to say Custom. (Mac OS X remembers your settings here. If you choose 
one of the presets and then choose Custom again, your hand-adjusted settings remain in place.)
Note, by the way, that the expanded Energy Saver panel also offers a pop-up menu called "Settings for," which lets you 
establish independent variations of the presets for the two times you'll be using your laptop: when plugged in and when 
running on battery. In other words, you really have two versions of each preset: one DVD Playback setting for battery, 
another for AC power; one Presentations setting for battery, another for AC power; and so on.
8.12.3 Scheduled Startup and Shutdown
By clicking the Schedule tab button, you can set up the Mac to shut itself down and turn itself back on automatically (Figure 
8-8, bottom).
If you work 9 to 5, for example, set the Mac to turn itself on at 8:45 a.m., and shut itself down at 5:30 p.m.—an arrangement 
that conserves electricity, saves money, and reduces pollution, but doesn't inconvenience you in the least. In fact, you may 
come to forget that you've set up the Mac this way, since you'll never actually see it turned off.
NOTE
The Mac doesn't shut down automatically if you've left unsaved documents open onscreen. It will go to sleep, 
though.

8.12 Energy Saver
8.12.4 Waking and Other Options
Click the Options tab button to summon a few more controls:
G     Wake when the modem detects a ring. This checkbox can be useful in two circumstances: first, if you use your 
Mac as a fax machine that accepts incoming faxes (Chapter 13), and second, if you dial into your Mac from the 
road. In either case, when a phone call reaches the laptop's modem, the computer wakes up and accepts the call—
if this option is turned on.
G     Wake for Ethernet network administrative access. This option exists exclusively for the purchasers of the 
software suite called Mac OS X Server, which lets the network guru in an office control (and, with this checkbox, 
even awaken) sleeping Macs on the network.
G     Restart automatically after a power failure. This is a good option if you leave your Mac unattended and access it 
remotely, or if you use it as a network file server or Web server. It ensures that, if there's even a momentary 
blackout that shuts down your Mac, it will start itself right back up again when the juice returns.
All three of these checkboxes can be part of the presets for a laptop. In other words, the DVD 
Playback setting turns all of the checkboxes off, the Highest Performance setting turns them 
all on, and so on.
G     Processor Performance. Is the scalding metal case of the PowerBook sending your thighs to the emergency 
room? Here's your quick fix: Choose Reduced from this pop-up menu. Your chip doesn't run nearly as fast now, but 
it's still plenty fast for email, word processing, and so on—and it runs at about half the temperature. (You'll gain 
some battery life, too.)

8.14 International
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.14 International
The International panel lets you set up your Mac to work in other languages. If you bought your Mac with a localized 
operating system—a version that already runs in your own language—and you're already using the only language, number 
format, and keyboard layout you'll ever need, then you can ignore most of this panel.
But at the very least, check it out. When it comes to showing off Mac OS X to your friends and loved ones, the "wow" factor 
on the Mac's polyglot features is huge.
8.14.1 Another Language—Instantly
The Mac has always been able to run software in multiple languages—if you installed the correct fonts, keyboard layouts, 
and localized software (a French copy of the Mac OS, a French version of Entourage, and so on). But in Mac OS X, you 
can shift from language to language in certain programs on the fly, without reinstalling the operating system or even 
restarting the computer.
Open the International panel. On the Language tab, you see a listing of the different languages the Mac can switch into—
French, German, Spanish, and so on. Just drag one of the languages to the top of the list to select it as the target 
language, as shown in Figure 8-9.
Now launch Safari, TextEdit, or Stickies. Every menu, button, and dialog box is now in the new language you selected! If 
you log out and back in (or restart) at this point, the entire Finder will be in the new language, too.
Of course, if you're really French (for example), you'll also want to make these changes:
G     Visit the Formats tab and choose your French-speaking country from the Region pop-up menu, so that time and 
date formats, number punctuation, and currency symbols also conform to your local customs.
For example, the decimal and thousands separator characters for displaying large numbers differ from country to 
country. (The number 25,600.99, for example, would be written as 25 600,99 in France, and as 25.600,99 in 
Spanish.) And what appears to an American as July 4 (the notation 7/4), to a European, indicates April 7.
If, for some reason, Apple's preprogrammed settings aren't right for your region, you'll see three Customize buttons 
that let you override them.
G     Choose the French keyboard layout from the Input Menu pane, as explained in Section 8.14.1.
NOTE
Not all programs are language-switching aware. Also note that, while you can add other languages to the 
Language list using the Edit button, they don't actually work unless you install additional language kit 
software.

8.14.2 Input Menu Tab
While the Mac can display many different languages at the same time, typing in those languages is another matter. The 
symbols you use when you're typing Swedish aren't the same as when you're typing English. Apple solved this problem by 
creating different keyboard layouts, one for each language. Each rearranges the letters that appear when you press the 
keys.
For example, when you use the Swedish layout and press the semicolon key, you don't get a semicolon (;)—you get an ö. 
(Apple even includes a Dvorak layout—a scientific rearrangement of the standard layout that puts the most common letters 
directly under your fingertips on the home row. Fans of the Dvorak layout claim greater accuracy, better speed, and less 
fatigue.)
Use the list in the Input Menu pane to indicate which keyboard layout you want. If you check off more than one keyboard 
layout, a tiny flag icon appears in your menu bar—a keyboard menulet that lets you switch from one layout to another just 
by choosing its name. (To preview a certain keyboard arrangement, launch the Key Caps program described in the next 
chapter.)
GEM IN THE ROUGH 
The Character Palette
There you are, two-thirds of the way through your local chess-club newsletter, when it hits you: You need an 
arrow symbol. Right now.
You know there's one in one of your symbol fonts, but you're not about to take two weeks off from work just to 
hunt through your fonts, typing every single combination of keys until you produce the arrow symbol. You 
can't help wishing there was an easier way to find those special symbols that hide among your fonts—fancy 
brackets, math symbols, special stars and asterisks, heart shapes, and so on.
The Keyboard Viewer display described on the facing page is one solution. But there's a better one: the 
Character Palette.
To make it appear, open System Preferences, click the International icon, click the Input Menu tab, and turn 
on the Character Palette checkbox. Now inspect your menu bar: You've just added the keyboard menu.
Next time you're word processing or doing page layout, choose Show Character Palette from this menu. (In 
some programs, you can choose Edit
Special Characters to summon the palette, too.)
The resulting window rounds up all symbols from all your fonts at once. To find a particular symbol, click the 
"by Category" tab, and then click the various category headings: Arrows, Stars/Asterisks, Math, and so on. 
(You can preview various styles of the same symbol by opening the Font Variations triangle.) When you find 
the symbol you want, double-click it.
If you're using a Cocoa program, the correct symbol pops into your document. (If not, you may get only the 
correct character, but not in the correct font. In that case, you'll have to change the font of the inserted 
character manually. To find out what font it came from, click the Font Variation flippy triangle to see the font 
name.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-14.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 4:53:37 AM

Instead of using the keyboard menu, you can switch back and forth between the most 
recently selected pair of keyboard scripts by pressing 
-Space bar. Alternatively, you can 
"walk down" the list of layouts by pressing Option-
-Space (if, that is, you've turned on this 
option in the Options box of the Input tab).
If these keystrokes conflict with one of the programs you already use, there's not much you 
can do about it, other than turning off the keyboard layouts you don't use. Apple's keyboard-
layout keystrokes always take precedence over the same shortcuts in your programs.
Then again, you may not have to switch manually. Sweetly enough, the new option here 
called "Try to match keyboard with text" may save you that effort. The Mac tries to choose 
the appropriate layout automatically when you highlight some text in a document, based on 
the language characters it sees there.
8.14.3 Keyboard Viewer: The Return of Key Caps
Key Caps, a part of the Mac since its earliest days, consists of a single window containing a tiny onscreen keyboard (Figure 
8-10). When you hold down any of the modifier keys on your keyboard (like 
, Option, Shift, or Control), you can see 
exactly which keys produce which characters. The point, of course, is to help you learn which keys to press when you need 
special symbols or non-English characters, such as © or ¢, in each font.
NOTE
Key Caps shows only the symbols you can produce by typing keystrokes. A font may contain thousands of 
other characters that can't actually be typed; the Character Palette (see the facing page) is the only way to 
access these other symbols.
How do you make a πsymbol? Top: Open Keyboard Viewer by choosing its name from the 
International (flag) menulet.
Bottom: Keyboard Viewer reveals the answer. When you press the Option key, the Keyboard 
Viewer keyboard shows that the pi character (π) is mapped to the P key. Once you've found the 
character in Keyboard Viewer, click its onscreen key to "type" it into the frontmost text 
application window.

It's a great tool—if you can find it. In Panther, it's no longer a separate program.
Instead, open the International panel of System Preferences, click Input Menu, and turn on the Keyboard Viewer checkbox. 
The window shown at top in Figure 8-10 appears. (Thereafter, you'll be able to choose its name from the flag menulet at the 
top of the screen, also as shown at top in Figure 8-10.)
To see the effect of typing while pressing the modifier keys (Shift, Option, and so on), either click the onscreen keys or type 
on your actual keyboard. The corresponding keys on the onscreen keyboard light up as they're pressed.
8.14.3.1 Change the Keyboard Viewer font
Different fonts contain different hidden characters. For example, Palatino contains an 
 character (pressing Shift-Option-
K), yet Adobe Garamond does not.
Fortunately, Keyboard Viewer lets you see the characters lurking within almost any installed font; just choose a font's name 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-14.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 4:53:37 AM

from the Font pop-up menu to see all of its modifier-key characters. (You may have to change the keyboard layout to see all 
symbols in some fonts.) Alas, this feature doesn't work in a few of the fonts where it would be the most useful (certain 
symbol fonts like Symbol and Zapf Dingbats).
You're not stuck viewing all characters in 12-point size—a good thing, because some of them 
are hard to read when displayed that small. Just "zoom" the Key Caps window by dragging 
its lower-right corner, or by clicking its Zoom button. You magnify the Key Caps window and 
its font.

8.15 Keyboard & Mouse

8.15 Keyboard & Mouse
This panel lets you do some frivolous fine-tuning of your mouse, keyboard, and (for laptops) trackpad. It also unlocks Mac 
OS X's strange and remarkable Full Keyboard Access feature, which lets you control your Mac's menus, windows, dialog 
boxes, buttons, the Dock, and the toolbar—all from the keyboard. Here's a tour of the Keyboard & Mouse panel's various 
tab buttons.
UP TO SPEED 
Bringing Dead Keys to Life
If you press Option while the Key Caps window is open, you see little white outlines around certain keys 
(shown in Figure 8-10, for example). These rectangles identify the Mac's five dead keys—keys that, when 
pressed once, type nothing onscreen.
However, when you then type another key—a normal letter, for example—it appears with the dead key's 
displayed marking over it.
To type the ñ in jalapeño, for example, you must first press Option-N and then type an n. This same two-step 
approach lets you type characters like ö and é.
8.15.1 Keyboard Tab
The changes you make are teeny tiny, but can have a cumulatively big impact on your daily typing routine.
G     Key Repeat Rate, Delay Until Repeat. You're probably too young to remember the antique once known as the 
typewriter. On some electric versions of this machine, you could hold down the letter X key to type a series of 
XXXXXXXs—ideal for crossing something out in a contract, for example.
On the Mac, every key behaves this way. Hold down any key long enough, and it starts spitting out repetitions, 
making it easy to type, for example, "No WAAAAAAAY!" or "You go, girrrrrrrrrl!" These two sliders govern this 
behavior. On the right: a slider that determines how long you must hold down the key before it starts repeating (to 
prevent triggering repetitions accidentally, in other words). On the left: a slider that governs how fast each key spits 
out letters once the spitting has begun.
G     Illuminate keyboard in low light conditions. This setting appears only if your Mac's keyboard does, in fact, light 
up when you're working in the dark—a showy feature of, for example, the 15- and 17-inch PowerBook models. You 
can specify that you want the internal lighting to shut off after a period of activity (to save power when you've 
wandered away, for example), or you can turn the lighting off altogether.
8.15.2 Mouse Tab
It may surprise you that the cursor on the screen doesn't move five inches when you move the mouse five inches on the 
desk. Instead, the cursor moves farther when you move the mouse faster.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-15.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 4:53:40 AM

8.15 Keyboard & Mouse
How much farther depends on how you set the first slider here. The Fast setting is nice if you have an enormous monitor, 
since you don't need an equally large mouse pad to get from one corner to another. The Slow setting, on the other hand, 
forces you to pick up and put down the mouse frequently as you scoot across the screen. It offers no acceleration at all, but 
it can be great for highly detailed work like pixel-by-pixel editing in Photoshop.
The Double-Click Speed setting specifies how much time you have to complete a double-click. If you click too slowly—
beyond the time you've allotted yourself with this slider—the Mac "hears" two single clicks instead.
8.15.3 Bluetooth Tab
People have named their Macs for years (Voyager, Li'l Abner, PowerThang G5). Now they can name their keyboards and 
mice—and, indeed, must—thanks to Apple's 2003 introduction of its cordless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Here's where 
you type in their names (so that Mac knows which wireless keyboard and mouse it's "listening" to in a room full of them) 
and monitor their battery levels. 
8.15.4 Trackpad Tab
This panel shows up only if you have a laptop.
Under normal circumstances, you touch your laptop's trackpad exclusively to move the cursor. For clicking and dragging, 
you're supposed to use the clicking button beneath the trackpad.
Many people find, however, that it's more direct to tap and drag directly on the trackpad—using the same finger that's been 
moving the cursor. That's the purpose of these five checkboxes:
G     Clicking. When this box is turned on, you can tap the trackpad surface to register a mouse click at the location of 
the cursor. Double-tap to double-click.
G     Dragging. Turn on this option if you want to move icons, highlight text, or pull down menus—in other words, to 
drag, not just click—using the trackpad. Start by tapping twice on the trackpad, then immediately after the second 
tap, begin dragging your finger. (If you don't start moving promptly, the laptop assumes that you were double-
clicking, which could wind up opening an icon you didn't intend to open.) You can stroke the trackpad repeatedly to 
continue your movement, as long as your finger never leaves the trackpad surface for more than about one 
second. When you finally stop touching the pad, you "let go," and the drag is considered complete. (All of this is 
much easier to do than to describe.)
G     Drag lock. If the dragging maneuver described above makes you too nervous that you might "drop" what you're 
dragging if you stop moving your finger for a fraction of a second, turn on this option instead. Once again, begin 
your drag by double-clicking, then move your finger immediately after the second click.
When this option is on, however, you can take your sweet time in continuing the movement. In between strokes of 
the trackpad, you can take your finger off the laptop for as long as you like. You can take a phone call, a shower, or 
a vacation; the Mac still thinks that you're in the middle of a drag. Only when you tap again does the laptop 
consider the drag a done deal.
G     Ignore accidental trackpad input. This option is a huge Mac OS X perk. It addresses a chronic syndrome of 
laptop owners who turn on the Clicking option of Apple trackpads: when you type along and a finger accidentally 
brushes the trackpad, sending the insertion point onto a different line of text. Before you even notice, you've typed 
over, or typed into, some random part of your document.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-15.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 4:53:40 AM

8.15 Keyboard & Mouse
This ingenious option locks out the click-and-drag trackpad functions when you're actually typing on the keyboard-
an elegantly simple solution.
G     Ignore trackpad when mouse is present. Here's another ingenious advance in laptop technology: When you 
hook up a mouse, trackball, or tablet to your laptop, the trackpad is deactivated. Obviously, if you're using a mouse, 
then you probably won't want to use the trackpad—and by turning on this checkbox, you're no longer susceptible to 
accidentally brushing it.
Here, too, is where you adjust the tracking and double-click speed of your trackpad, exactly as you would for a mouse.
8.15.5 Keyboard Shortcuts
Mac OS X 10.3 comes loaded with keyboard shortcuts for common tasks—and now you can reassign them to shortcuts you 
prefer. For a full discussion of the options on this pane, Section 4.6.

8.18 QuickTime
The settings in the QuickTime panel affect the way movies are played back on your Mac, including movies that stream to 
you from a Web page and movies that you watch using QuickTime Player (Chapter 14).
You don't even have to touch most of these settings, but here are a few worth tweaking:
G     Plug-In. The settings in this pane control the way your Web browser's QuickTime plug-in works with streaming 
video. The "Play movies automatically" option, for example, tells the plug-in to start playing streaming movies as 
soon as they begin downloading (rather than waiting for an entire movie to download before starting).
G     Connection. The only important setting here is Connection Speed. Set it to match the actual speed and type of 
your Internet connection. Some streaming Quick- Time Web sites are set up with multiple versions of the same 
movie, each saved at a different size and frame rate. Based on your connection speed setting here, the QuickTime 
plug-in can automatically request the appropriately sized version of a movie for the best possible playback.
G     Music. Nothing to see here, folks. You're supposed to choose a music synthesizer for playing back MIDI music files
—but you have only one choice.
G     Media Keys. Media keys are supposed to be special passwords supported by QuickTime that unlock movies so 
you can watch them. As it turns out, nobody uses them.
G     Update. These controls provide an easy way to download the latest QuickTime software from Apple.
(The Registration button at the bottom of the dialog box lets you upgrade to Quick- Time Pro, as described in Chapter 14.)

8.21 Software Update

8.21 Software Update
Few operating-system ideas are simpler or better than this one: Whenever Apple improves or fixes one of the innumerable 
software pieces that make up Mac OS X,
POWER USERS' CLINIC 
Storing Apple Software Updates
The great unspoken migraine of Software Update is this: If you ever reinstall Mac OS X from its original CD or 
DVD (when you install a new hard drive or move to a new computer, for example), you'll have to download 
and install all relevant updates again. That is, if you bought Mac OS X 10.3 and it came with iPhoto 2.0.1, 
you'll have to download and install the 10.3.1 updater, the iPhoto 2.0.3 updater, and so on.
Fortunately, although you can't skip the reinstallation process, you can skip the download step—by preserving 
the update installers as they arrive.
Each time Software Update finds updates to install, turn on the ones you wish to install and then choose 
Update
 Install and Keep Package.
Later, you can reinstall your downloaded updates at any time by just double-clicking each installer. (They wind 
up in your Macintosh HD
Library
Packages folder.)
The sole downside: When there are multiple updates that require restarting your Mac, you have to restart after 
each one you install. On its own, Software Update would save up its one restart until all of the updates are 
installed.
the Software Update program can notify you, download the update, and install it into your System automatically. These 
updates may include new versions of programs like iPhoto and iMovie; drivers for newly released printers, scanners, 
cameras, and such; bug fixes and security patches; and so on.
Software Update doesn't run rampant through your system software, however. It's quietly respectful. For example, Software 
Update doesn't actually download the new software without asking your permission first and explicitly telling you what it 
plans to install, as shown in Figure 8-11.
When Software Update finds an appropriate software morsel, it offers to install it automatically 
by presenting this dialog box. Apple has always created updated and bug-fixing versions of its 
software components, but they don't do you any good if you don't know about them. You no 
longer have to scour Mac news Web sites to discover that one of these components has been 
released and then hunt down the software itself.

before anything gets installed, but you won't have to wait for the downloading—the deed will already be done.
(If you've had "Check for updates" turned off, you can always click the Check Now button to force Mac OS X to report in to 
Apple to see if new patches are available.)

By popular demand, Software Update also keeps a meticulous log of everything it drops into your system. On this tab, you

In your hard drive
Library
Receipts folder, you'll find a liberal handful of .pkg files 
that have been downloaded by Software Update.
Most of these are nothing more than receipts that help Mac OS X understand which updaters 
you've already downloaded and installed. They make intriguing reading, but their primary 
practical use is determining whether or not you've installed, for example, the 10.3.2 update.

8.22 Sound

8.22 Sound
Mac OS X's sound options are a little on the lean side, but a visit to the Sound panel is still worthwhile. Using the panes of 
the Sound panel, you can configure the sound system of your Mac in any of several ways.
Here's a quick way to jump directly to the Sound panel of System Preferences—from the 
keyboard, without ever having to open System Preferences or click Sound. Just press Option 
as you tap one of the volume-adjustment keys on the top row of your Apple keyboard.
8.22.1 Sound Effects Tab
"Sound effects" means error beeps—the sound you hear when the Mac wants your attention, or when you click someplace 
you shouldn't.
Just click the sound of your choice to make it your default system beep. Most of the canned choices here are funny and 
clever, yet subdued enough to be of practical value as alert sounds.
As for the other controls on the Sound Effects panel, they include:
G     Alert Volume slider. Some Mac users are confused by the fact that even when they drag this slider all the way to 
the left, the sound from games and music CDs still plays at full volume.
The actual main volume slider for your Mac is at the bottom of the Sound panel, called "Output volume." The slider 
on the Alert Sounds panel is just for error beeps; Apple was kind enough to let you adjust the volume of these error 
beeps independently.
You can also adjust the alert volume by holding down the Option key as you drag the main 
speaker volume menulet on your menu bar.
G     Play user interface sound effects. This option produces a few subtle sound effects when you perform certain 
Finder operations: dragging something off of the Dock, for example, or dropping something into the Trash.
G     Play feedback when volume keys are pressed. Most Mac keyboards have little volume-adjustment keys on the 
top row that, when pressed, adjust the overall speaker level. Each time you press one of these keys, the Mac 
beeps to help you gauge the current volume.
That's all fine when you're working at home. But more than one person has been humiliated in an important 
meeting when the Mac made a sudden, inappropriately loud sonic outburst-and then amplified that embarrassment 
by furiously and repeatedly pressing the volume-down key, beeping all the way.

8.22 Sound
If you turn off this checkbox, the Mac won't make any sound at all as you adjust its volume. Instead, you'll see only 
a visual representation of the steadily decreasing (or increasing) volume level.
If you like the little volume-adjustment clicks most of the time, you can shut them up on a one-
shot basis by pressing Shift as you tap the volume keys.
8.22.2 Output Tab
"Output" means speakers. For 99 percent of the Mac-using community, this panel offers nothing useful except the Balance 
slider, which sets the balance between your Mac's left and right stereo speakers. The "Choose a device" wording seems to 
imply that you can choose which speakers you want to use for playback. But Internal is generally the only choice, even if 
you have external speakers. (The Mac uses your external speakers automatically when they're plugged in.)
8.22.3 Input Tab
This panel lets you specify which sound source you want the Mac to "listen to," if indeed you have more than one source 
connected: external microphone, internal mike, line input, or whatever. It also lets you adjust the sensitivity of that 
microphone—its input volume—by dragging the slider and watching the real-time Input Level meter above it change as you 
speak.
Put another way, it's a quick way to see if your microphone is working or not.

8.25 Universal Access
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
8.25 Universal Access
The Universal Access panel is designed for people who type with one hand, find it difficult to use a mouse, or have trouble 
seeing or hearing. (These features can also be handy when the mouse is broken or missing.)
NOTE
The Mac actually speaks aloud the names of the Universal Access panel's various buttons and tabs, as you 
move your cursor over them. This, of course, is intended to help people who have trouble reading the 
screen. If it bothers you, turn off "Enable text-to-speech for Universal Access preferences" at the bottom of 
the window.
8.25.1 Seeing Tab (Magnifying the Screen)
If you have trouble seeing the screen, one quick solution is to reduce your monitor's resolution—thus magnifying the image
—using the Displays panel described earlier in this chapter. If you have a 17-inch or larger monitor set to, say, 640 x 480, 
the result is a greatly magnified picture.
That method doesn't give you much flexibility, however, and it's something of a hassle to adjust.
If you agree, then try out the features offered by the Seeing panel (called CloseView in earlier Mac OS versions). This 
feature lets you enlarge the area surrounding your cursor in any increment—and, if you like, also to invert the colors of the 
screen so that white is black, blue is yellow, and so on.
To make it work, press Option-
-8 as you're working. Or, if the Seeing panel is open in front of you, just click the gigantic 
Turn On Zoom button. That's the master switch.
No zooming actually takes place, however, until you press Option-
-plus sign (to zoom in) or Option-
-minus sign (to 
zoom out). With each press, the entire screen image gets larger or smaller, creating a virtual monitor that follows your 
cursor around the screen.
You'll be amazed at just how much you can zoom in. In fact, there's nothing to stop you from zooming in so far, that a single 
pixel fills the entire monitor. (That may not be especially useful for people with limited vision, but it can be handy for graphic 
designers learning how to reproduce a certain icon, dot by dot.)
If you click Zoom Options, you'll find miles and miles of options that control when the enlarged screen image pans (all the 
time, or only when the pointer hits a screen edge), the maximum or minimum degree of enlargement, and so on.
While you're at it, pressing Control-Option-
-* (asterisk), or clicking the "Switch to Black on White" button, inverts the 
colors of the screen, so that text appears white on black—an effect that some people find easier to read. (This option also 
freaks out many Mac fans who turn it on by mistake, somehow pressing Control-Option-
-* by accident during everyday 
work. They think that the Mac's expensive monitor has just gone loco. Now you know better.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-25.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 4:59:44 AM

8.25 Universal Access
There's also a button called Set Display to Grayscale, which banishes all color from your 
screen. This is another feature designed to improve text clarity, but it's also a dandy way to 
see how a color document will look when printed on a monochrome laser printer.
Switch back to color by clicking Set Display to Color.
8.25.2 Hearing Tab (Flashing the Screen)
If you have trouble hearing the Mac's sounds, the obvious solution is to increase the volume, which is why the Adjust Sound 
button on this panel offers a direct link to the Sound preferences panel. (If your Mac doesn't have external speakers, 
consider getting some.)
Fortunately, hearing your computer usually isn't critical (except when working in music and audio, of course). The only time 
audio is especially important is when the Mac tries to get your attention by beeping. For those situations, turn on "Flash the 
screen when an alert sound occurs" (an effect you can try out by clicking Flash Screen). Now you'll see a white flash across 
the entire monitor whenever the Mac would otherwise beep—not a bad idea on laptops, actually, so that you don't miss 
beeps when you've got the speakers muted.
8.25.3 Keyboard Tab (Typing Assistance)
This panel offers two clever features designed to help people who have trouble using the keyboard.
G     Sticky Keys lets you press multiple-key shortcuts (involving keys like Shift, Option, Control, and 
) one at a time 
instead of all together.
To make Sticky Keys work, first turn on the master switch at the top of the dialog box. Then go to work on the Mac, 
triggering keyboard commands as shown in Figure 8-12.
If you press a modifier key twice, meanwhile, you lock it down. (Its onscreen symbol gets brighter to let you know.) 
When a key is locked, you can use it for several commands in a row. For example, if a folder icon is highlighted, 
you could double-press 
 to lock it down—and then type O (to open the folder), look around, and then press W 
(to close the window). Press the 
 key a third time to "un-press" it.
Whenever you want to press a multiple-key keystroke like Shift- Option-
-D, press them one at 
a time. You'll see ghost images of these keys superimposed on your screen, to show you which 
keystrokes you've added to your temporary collection. To "un-press" a key you've already 
pressed, press it again twice.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-8-SECT-25.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 4:59:44 AM

8.25 Universal Access
 
The checkbox called "Press the Shift key five times to turn Sticky Keys on or off" gives you 
the flexibility of turning Sticky Keys on and off at will, without even taking a trip to System 
Preferences. Whenever you want to turn on Sticky Keys, press the Shift key five times in 
succession. You'll hear a special clacking sound effect alerting you that you just turned on 
Sticky Keys. (Repeat the five presses to turn Sticky Keys off again.)
G     Slow Keys, on the other hand, doesn't register a key press at all until you've held down the key for more than a 
second or so—a feature designed to screen out accidental key presses.
If "Use click key sounds" is turned on, you'll hear a little typing sound each time you press a key, but none of these 
key presses registers unless you hold the key down for a moment. (Use the Acceptance Delay slider to govern this 
threshold.) You hear a different sound when the Mac actually accepts the key press, and, of course, you'll see the 
letter you typed appear onscreen.

POWER USERS' CLINIC 
Direct System Preferences Access from the Dock
As noted earlier in this chapter, Mac OS X 10.3 offers a tidy pop-up menu of System Preferences panels right 
there in your Dock. That's a great feature, one that saves you several steps on the way to System 
Preferences, but it works only when System Preferences is already running. 
Wouldn't it be cool if your favorite preference panels could pop up from the Dock anytime, whether System 
Preferences was running or not?
Here's how you do it. Make a new folder (in your Home folder, for example). Name it whatever you want the 
Dock icon to say—SysPrefs or Control Panels, for example. Stick it into your Sidebar for a moment.
Now open your System
Library
PreferencePanes folder, which contains the icons for the various 
System Preferences panes. Select all of them—or only the ones you actually use.
Drag them into the SysPrefs folder on your Sidebar, taking care to press Option-
 as you release the 
mouse. (Option-
-dragging makes aliases of them.) If the .prefPane suffix on the aliases bugs you, select 
all of the aliases, press 
-I, open the Name & Extension panel in the Get Info window, and turn on "Hide 
extension."
Finally, drag the SysPrefs folder onto the right side of your Dock. Now, whenever you want to open a 
particular panel, just Control-click (or hold the mouse button down on) this SysPrefs Dock icon. You get a 
handy pop-up list, as shown here. (The icons may look like folders, but they're standard, double-clickable 
icons that take you directly to the corresponding panel of System Preferences.)

8.25 Universal Access
 
8.25.4 Mouse Tab (Cursor Control from the Keyboard)
Mouse Keys is designed to help people who can't use the mouse—or who want more precision when working in graphics 
programs. It lets you click, drag, and otherwise manipulate the cursor by pressing the keys on your numeric keypad.
When Mouse Keys is turned on, the 5 key acts as the clicker; hold it down for a moment to "click the mouse," do that twice 
to double-click, and so on. Hold down the 0 key to lock down the mouse button, and the period key to unlock it. (The 
amount of time you have to hold them down depends on how you've set the Initial Display slider.)
Move the cursor around the screen by pressing the eight keys that surround the 5 key. (For example, hold down the 9 key 
to move the cursor diagonally up and to the right.) If you hold one of these keys down continuously, the cursor, after a 
pause, begins to move smoothly in that direction—according to the way you have adjusted the sliders called Initial Delay 
and Maximum Speed.
The new Panther checkbox called "Press the option key five times to turn Mouse Keys on or 
off" saves you the trouble of opening System Preferences.

Chapter 9. The Free Programs
Right out of the box, Mac OS X comes with a healthy assortment of nearly 50 freebies: programs for sending email, writing 
documents, doing math, even playing games. Some are dressed-up versions of Mac programs that have been around for 
years. Others, though, are new programs that not only show off some of Mac OS X's most dramatic new technologies, but 
let you get real work done without having to invest in additional software.
NOTE
Several of the freebie programs described here are also the subject of other books in this series, including 
iMovie 3 & iDVD: The Missing Manual, iMovie 3: The Missing Manual, and iPhoto 2: The Missing Manual. By 
popular request (and, in some cases, indignant request), this chapter now includes concise crash courses in 
these programs. But the full scoop on each of these powerful programs-including tips, tricks, customization 
advice, troubleshooting chapters, and so on-requires a whole other book.

9.1 Your Free Mac OS X Programs
You've got a broad assortment of programs in the Applications folder in the main hard drive window. The

Utilities folder holds another couple dozen mini-programs that handle such workaday jobs as setting up 
printers and network connections, fixing problems on your hard disk, and monitoring the behind-the-scenes processing 
performed by your Mac whenever you launch and run programs.
All of these programs have been either written expressly for Mac OS X (Cocoa applications) or adapted for it ( Carbonized—
see Section 4.8). This chapter guides you through every item in your new software library, one program at a time. 
(Depending on your Mac model, you may find other programs in your Applications folder; Apple occasionally includes 
software of its own, or from other companies, to spice up the collection for, say, iMacs or Power Macs.)

9.4 Calculator
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
9.4 Calculator
Over the years, just about every Mac program and feature evolved, matured, and grew. For 17 years, however, one 
program chugged along, essentially untouched: the simple, four-function Calculator. As late as 2002, this Calculator still 
lacked memory keys, a percentage key, or a CE (clear entry) key, let alone any advanced functions. By the time Mac OS X 
came along, it was the very last piece of original Mac OS software still standing.
That relic is finally gone. The new Calculator is far more potent than the humble fourfunction program that preceded it. It 
can act as a scientific calculator for students and scientists, a conversion calculator for metric and U.S. measures, and even 
a currency calculator for world travelers.
Here's everything you need to know for basic math:
G     The calculator has two modes: Basic and Advanced (see Figure 9-1). Switch between them by choosing the 
appropriate command from the View menu (or pressing 
-1 for Basic, 
-2 for Advanced).
G     You can operate the calculator by clicking the onscreen buttons, but it's much easier to press the corresponding 
number and symbol keys on your keyboard.
If you have a Mac laptop, don't miss the embedded numeric keypad, superimposed on the 
right side of the keyboard and labeled on the keys in a different color ink. When you press 
the Fn key in the lower-left corner of the keyboard, typing these keys produces the numbers 
instead of the letters. (You can also press the NumLock key to stay in number mode so that 
you don't have to keep pressing Fn.)
G     As you go, you can make your calculator speak each key you press. The Mac's voice ensures that you don't 
mistype as you keep your eyes on the receipts in front of you, while you type by touch.
Just choose Speech
Speak Button Pressed to turn this feature on or off. (You choose which voice does the talking in 
the Speech panel of System Preferences.)
G     Press the C key to clear the calculator display.
G     Once you've calculated a result, you can copy it (using Edit
Copy, or 
-C) and paste it directly into another 
program.
Both the four-function Basic mode and the scientific calculator mode (shown here) offer a 
"paper tape" feature (View
Show Paper Tape) that lets you correct errors made way back in 
a calculation. Drag through a number, retype, and then click Recalculate Totals.

9.4 Calculator
 
9.4.1 Conversions
Calculator is more than a calculator; it's also a conversion program. No matter what units you're trying to convert—meters, 
grams, inches, miles per hour—Calculator is ready. Proceed like this:
1.  Clear the calculator. Type in the starting measurement. 
To convert 48 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, for example, type 48.
2.  From the Convert menu, choose the kind of conversion you want. 
In this case, choose Temperature. When you're done choosing, a little dialog box appears.
3.  Use the pop-up menus to specify which units you want to convert to and from. 
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, choose Celsius from the first pop-up menu, and Fahrenheit from the second.
4.  Click OK. 
The calculator displays the result—in degrees Fahrenheit, in this example.
The next time you want to make this kind of calculation, you can skip steps 2, 3, and 4. Instead, just choose your desired 
conversion from the Convert
Recent Conversions submenu.
You might not suspect it, but the Calculator has a secret graphing mode—and a few other 
tricks up its sleeve. See the box in Section 9.25.23 for details.

9.4 Calculator
Calculator is especially amazing when it comes to currency conversions—from pesos to American dollars, for example—
because it actually does its homework. It goes online to download up-to-the-minute currency rates to ensure that the 
conversion is accurate.
All you have to do is choose Convert
Update Currency Exchange Rates. Then, when you use the 
Convert
Currency command, your numbers will be the very latest.
If you Control-click Calculator's results display, the contextual menu offers an option called 
Large Type. If you choose it, you get huge, enormous, gigantic type, superimposed upon a 
smoky background window for contrast—a great way to make sure the peons in the back row 
can see the answer.

9.5 Chess
Mac OS X comes with only one game, but it's a beauty (Figure 9-2). Chess is a traditional chess game played on a 
gorgeously rendered board with a set of realistic 3-D pieces. You can rotate the board in space, as described in Figure 9-2.
The program is actually a 15-year-old Unix-based chess program, Gnu Chess, that Apple packaged up in a new wrapper.
You don't have to be terribly exact about grabbing the chess pieces when it's time to make your 
move. Just click anywhere within a piece's current square to drag it into a new position on the 
board (shown here in its Marble incarnation). And how did this chess board get rotated like 
this? Because in this program you can grab a corner of the board and rotate it in 3-D space. 
Cool!

9.5 Chess
9.5.1 Playing a Game of Chess
When you launch Chess, you're presented with a fresh, new game that's set up in Human vs. Computer mode—meaning 
that you (the Human, with the light-colored pieces) get to play against the Computer (your Mac, on the dark side). Drag the 
chess piece of your choice into position on the board, and the game is afoot.
If you choose Game
New Game, however, you're offered a pop-up menu with choices like Human vs. Computer, 
Human vs. Human, and so on. If you switch the pop-up menu to Computer vs. Human, you and your Mac trade places; the 
Mac takes the white side of the board and opens the game with the first move, and you play the black side.
The same New Game dialog box also offers a pop-up menu called Variant, which offers 
three other chess-like games: Crazyhouse, Suicide, and Losers. The Chess help screens 
(under "Starting a new game") explain these variations.
On some night when the video store is closed and you're desperate for entertainment, you might also want to try the 
Computer vs. Computer option, which pits your Mac against itself. Pour yourself a beer, open a bag of chips, and settle in to 
watch until someone—either the Mac or the Mac—gains victory.
9.5.2 Chess Preferences
Choose Chess
Preferences to find some useful controls like these:
G     Style. In Mac OS X 10.3, Apple went nuts with the computer-generated materials options. (Is it a coincidence that 
Steve Jobs is also the CEO of Pixar, the computeranimation company?)
In any case, you can choose all kinds of wacky materials for the look of your game board—Wood, Metal, Marble, or 
Grass (!)—and for your playing pieces (Wood, Metal, Marble, or Fur).
G     Computer Plays. Use this slider to determine how frustrated you want to get when trying to win at Chess. The 
further you drag the slider toward the Stronger side, the more calculations the computer runs before making its next 
move (and, thus, the harder it gets for you to outthink it). At the Faster setting, Chess won't spend more than five 
seconds ruminating over possible moves. Drag the slider all the way to the right, however, and the program may 
analyze each move for as long as ten fun-filled hours. This hardest setting, of course, makes it all but impossible to 
win a game (which may stretch on for a week or more anyway).
Choosing the Faster setting makes it only mildly impossible.
G     Speech. This checkbox lets you play Chess using the Mac's built-in voice-recognition features. You tell your chess 
pieces where to go instead of dragging them. Section 14.5.1 has the details.
If your Chess-playing skills are less than optimal, the Move menu will become your fast 
friend. The three commands tucked away there let you undo your last move (great for 
recovering from a stupid mistake), display your opponent's previous move (in case you failed 
to notice what the computer just did), and receive a suggestion for a move when you don't 
have a clue what to do next.

9.5 Chess
9.5.3 Saving Your Games
You can choose Game
Save Game to save any game in progress, so that you can resume it later.
To archive the moves making up an entire game instead, use the Game Log command, which displays the history of your 
game, move by move. A typical move would be recorded as "Nb8 - c6," meaning that the knight on the b8 square moved to 
the c6 square. Equipped with a Chess list document, you could recreate an entire game, move by move.
If you open this window before you begin a new game, you can see the game log fill in the 
moves as they happen.

NOSTALGIA CORNER
Death to the Clock?
Hey! Where's the Clock? I used to love that little Mac OS X app. 
Mac OS X 10.3 no longer comes with a program called Clock in your Applications folder—that much is true.
However, the friendly neighborhood clock is still around.
Open System Preferences, click Date & Time, click the Clock tab button, turn on "Show the date and time," 
choose "View in: Window," and "View as: Analog." There's your old friend, floating in its own little window as 
always.

9.9 iDVD 3

9.9 iDVD 3
You have iDVD 3 only if you bought a new Mac containing a SuperDrive DVD burner, or you bought Apple's iLife software 
suite. In any case, iDVD is designed to let you turn your digital photos or camcorder movies into DVDs that work on any 
DVD player, complete with menus, slideshow controls, and other navigation features. iDVD handles the technology; you 
control the style.
Sure, you can export your finished iMovie project back to a good old VHS cassette. But preserving your work on a DVD 
gives you a boatload of benefits, including better durability, dramatically better quality, no need for rewinding, duplication 
without quality loss, and cheaper shipping. (And besides, you can fit a lot more DVDs on a shelf than VHS tapes.)
NOTE
DVD players sold since 2002 are generally a safe bet for playing back homemade DVDs, but check the 
master player compatibility list at www.dvdrhelp.com if you're ever in doubt. Some players are fussy about 
which DVD-R brand discs they play, too.
Here's the basic routine for converting an iMovie movie into a Blockbuster-style DVD.
9.9.1 Phase 1: Insert Chapter Markers
DVD chapters let viewers skip to predefined starting points within a movie, either using a Scene menu or pressing the Next 
Chapter or Previous Chapter buttons on the remote control. Thanks to the partnership of iMovie 3 and iDVD 3, you can add 
to your own movies markers that perfectly replicate this feature.
The iDVD palette lets you add, remove, and name chapters—and then publish your iMovies to 
iDVD. New iMovie chapters are numbered sequentially, as they appear in your movie from left 
to right. Chapter references appear in your timeline as small yellow diamonds, just above the 
video track. iMovie can add up to 99 chapters per movie with the iDVD palette.

1.  In iMovie, click the iDVD button to open the iDVD palette. 
You'll find it among the other palette buttons, just to the right of the Effects button, as shown in Figure 9-3.
2.  Drag the Playhead to the position for your new chapter. Click Add Chapter. Type a chapter title into the 
Chapter Title box. 
Whatever you type here will wind up as the chapter name in the finished DVD menu.
3.  Repeat step 2 until you've created all the chapters for your movie. Save your project. 
If you've added a chapter in error, click it and then click Remove Chapter.
9.9.2 Phase 2: Hand Off to iDVD
Now you're ready to hand off the movie to iDVD, where you do your menu design and DVD burning.
The Customize button reveals iDVD's Customize drawer. When you click one of the buttons at 
the top, the pane changes to show its contents. For example, Themes lets you choose a design 
scheme. The Settings pane lets you choose motion menu duration, background video and 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-9.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 5:00:06 AM

9.9 iDVD 3
audio, title fonts, and the look and placement of buttons. The Audio and Photos panes link 
directly to iTunes and iPhoto.
 
Save your project, and then click Create iDVD Project at the bottom of the chapter list. Your hard drive whirs, thunder rolls 
somewhere, and after a few minutes, you wind up in iDVD itself. You'll know when you get there: haunting movie-score 
music plays and animated red curtains open and close (Figure 9-4).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-9.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 5:00:06 AM

9.9 iDVD 3
To turn off the Apple logo that appears in the lower-right corner of every iDVD Project, 
choose iDVD
 Preferences and turn off "Show Apple logo watermark."
9.9.3 Phase 3: Design the Menu Screen
The red-curtained theater, the music that's playing, and the font for your buttons are all part of a theme: a unified design 
scheme that governs how the menus look and behave.
A wide range of canned themes awaits your inspection. To see them, click Customize to open the Customize drawer, if it 
isn't already open (Figure 9-4). Then, from the pop-up menu at the top of the drawer, choose All.
Scroll through the list of themes, clicking each one to see what it looks like in the main work area, or just rely on the little 
thumbnail icons to get a sense of the theme's overall flavor.
Select a theme by clicking its thumbnail. The main menu screen takes on your chosen theme instantly. If your DVD menu 
system has other screens—a scene-selection screen that lists your chapter markers, for example—choose 
Advanced
Apply Theme to Project, so that every screen will look alike.
9.9.4 Phase 4: Edit Titles and Buttons
On the main menu screen now before you, you'll find two buttons:
G     Play. On the finished DVD, this button will mean, "Play the movie from the beginning."
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Drop Zones
Drop zones, new in some iDVD 3 themes, let you use video, slideshows, and graphics as the backgrounds of 
your menu screens. Look for the words "Drag photos or movies here," indicating the presence of a drop zone.
You can drag any video, photo album, or image right into a drop zone outline to install it there (like the island 
photo shown here). You can drag it out of the Finder, or directly out of the Movies or Photos panes in the 
Customize drawer.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-9.html (4 of 7)5/3/2004 5:00:06 AM

9.9 iDVD 3
 
By the way, if you drag a movie into a drop zone, you can't control where the movie begins, as you can with 
button movies. It always begins at the beginning.
G     Scene Selection. On the finished DVD, this button will take your audience to a second screen, which is filled with 
individual buttons for the chapters you created. (In fact, this second screen may well have arrows that lead to third 
and fourth screens, because iDVD can fit only six buttons per screen.)
You can edit these text buttons just as you would Finder icon names: Click inside the text to open up an editing box, type 
your changes, and then press Enter or Return.
Editing button names works almost the same way, except that you single-click the button first, and then click the text itself 
to open the editing box.
9.9.4.1 Button images and button videos
Almost every button displays an icon, picture, or tiny movie clip to give viewers a hint as to what lies in store if they click it. 
To specify what that image is, see Figure 9-5.
iDVD can display up to 30 seconds of a movie right there on the button. Turn on Movie, and 
then use the slider to specify where you want the tiny button movie to begin looping. To make 
your button's face a still image instead, turn off the Movie checkbox, and then drag any 
graphics file right onto the button; you'll see the image change instantly.

9.9 iDVD 3
 
9.9.5 Phase 5: Burning Your DVD
Once your menu screens are looking pretty good, you're almost ready to burn the DVD. Before you go using up a blank 
disc, however, you should test your creation to make sure that it works on the virtual DVD player known as the Macintosh.
G     Preview the DVD. iDVD's Preview button lets you test your menu system to avoid unpleasant surprises. When you 
click it, iDVD enters Preview mode, which simulates how your DVD works on a standalone set-top DVD player. You 
even get a simulated remote control to help you navigate. Click Stop (the filled square) or reclick Preview to return 
to iDVD's Edit mode.
G     Check the length. iDVD prefers to burn 60-minute DVDs, because they have the best quality. The instant you try 
to add the sixty-first minute of footage to your project, though, iDVD invites you to switch to 90-minute mode—at 
lower quality —or to delete some video from the project to make it fit within 60 minutes again.
When you've finished editing your disc and testing it thoroughly, it's time to proceed with your burn.
1.  Check your Motion setting. 
The Motion button at the bottom of the window determines whether or not your finished DVD will have animated 
menus, buttons, and backgrounds, and whether or not music will play. If the Motion button is green, you'll get all of 
the above. If you click to turn the Motion button off (gray), then motion and audio features won't appear on the final 
disc.
2.  Choose File
Save Project. Click the Burn button twice. 
The first click on the gray, closed Burn button "opens" it, revealing a throbbing yellow-and-black button. The second 
click begins the burning process.
3.  Insert a blank DVD-R disc when the Mac asks for it. 
Be sure you're using the correct kind of blank DVD for the speed of your DVD burner. For example, don't attempt to 
burn 1x or 2x blanks at 4x speed.

9.10 Image Capture
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
9.10 Image Capture
This unsung little program is something of an orphan. It was designed to download pictures from a USB digital camera and 
then process them automatically (turning them into a Web page, scaling them to emailable size, and so on). Of course, after 
Image Capture's birth, iPhoto came along, generally blowing its predecessor out of the water.
Even so, Apple still includes Image Capture with Mac OS X for these reasons:
G     Image Capture makes it easy to download only some pictures from your camera (Figure 9-6). iPhoto, by contrast, 
always downloads the entire contents of your camera's memory card.
G     Image Capture can grab images from Mac OS X-compatible scanners, too, not just digital cameras.
G     Image Capture can download your movies and sounds from a digital still camera; iPhoto can't.
G     In Mac OS X 10.3, Image Capture can turn a compatible digital camera into a Webcam, broadcasting whatever it 
"sees" to anyone on your office network—or the whole Internet. Similarly, it can share a scanner with all the 
networked Macs in your office.
You can open Image Capture in either of two ways. You can simply double-click its icon in your Applications folder or you 
can set it up to open automatically whenever you connect a USB digital camera and turn it on. To set up that arrangement, 
open Image Capture manually. Choose Image Capture
Preferences, click Camera, and choose Image Capture from 
the "When a camera is connected, open" pop-up menu.
In any case, once Image Capture is open, it looks like Figure 9-6.
In Image Capture, you can use the following pop-up menus.
Top: You can set up Image Capture to open automatically when you attach a USB camera to 
your Mac. One click (on Download All) transfers the cameras pictures to your hard drive.
Bottom: If you click Download Some, you get this "slide-sorter" window, where you can choose 
the individual pictures you want to download, use the buttons at the top to rotate selected 
shots, or delete shots from the camera. In slide-sorter view, Shift-click or 
 click the 
thumbnails of the pictures you want. In list view, Shift-click or 
-click as though they're Finder 
list-view files.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-10.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 5:00:10 AM

9.10.1 Download To
Use this pop-up menu to choose a destination folder for the pictures. Image Capture proposes putting photos, sounds, and 
movies from the camera into your Home folder's Pictures, Music, and Movies folders, respectively. When the downloading 
process is complete, Mac OS X opens the corresponding folder automatically, saving you the trouble of finding it.
9.10.2 Automatic Task
Download, schmownload—Image Capture is just warming up. It comes equipped to process the downloaded photos in 
several useful ways. For example:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-10.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 5:00:10 AM

9.10 Image Capture
G     None. Translation: "Just download the pictures, please."
G     Build slide show. After the download is complete, your screen goes black, and a smooth full-screen slideshow 
begins, featuring the newly downloaded pictures gracefully cross-fading one to the next (without musical 
accompaniment, alas).
G     Build web page. Creates an actual, and very attractive, Web page of your downloaded shots. Against a black 
background, you get thumbnail images of the pictures in a Web page document called index.html. (You'll find it in 
your Home folder
 Pictures
Index folder, which also contains the graphics files incorporated into this 
HTML document.) Image Capture, proud of its work, automatically opens up this page in your Web browser.
Just click one of the small images to view it at full size, exactly as your Web site visitors will be able to do once this 
page is actually on the Web. (Getting it online is up to you, although Apple's HomePage feature—part of the .Mac 
subscription program described in Section 18.9—is one of the easiest methods.)
The truth is, iPhoto offers more Web page options and better-looking results, but Image Capture is handy when you 
just need something quick and dirty.
G     crop to 3 x 5, fit to 3 x 5.... Each option here creates a photo gallery as a PDF document ( Section 13.6), ready to 
print out and then, presumably, to cut apart with scissors or a paper cutter. Each offers neatly arranged photos in 
the dimensions you've selected.
And what if a photo doesn't precisely fit 4 x 6 proportions (or whatever)? The "crop to" options center each photo 
within the specified shape and then trim the outer borders if necessary. The "fit to" options shrink the photo as 
necessary to fit into the specified dimensions, sometimes leaving blank white margins.
NOTE
The "crop" commands never touch the actual downloaded photos. The downloaded image files themselves 
retain their full size and resolution.
G     Preview. This option opens the fresh pictures in Preview (Section 9.18), so that you can get a better (and bigger) 
look at them.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Image Capture Super-Prefs
Apple spared no expense on this baby. Lurking in the dialog box that appears when you click the Options 
button (shown in Figure 9-6) are some very powerful features. They're well worth exploring.
The Download Options tab, for example, is where you can set Image Capture to grab pictures automatically 
when you plug in the camera, saving you a click on the Download button. Here's where you specify, too, that 
you want to delete the photos from the camera after they've been downloaded to the Mac—another step-
saving option that makes your memory card ready for more pictures.
The View Options tab controls the displays shown at bottom in Figure 9-6: the size of the icons in "slide-
sorter" view, and which columns of information appear in the list view—date, height and width, resolution 
(DPI), aperture, and so on.

Once you've written or downloaded them, drop them into your System
Library
Image

Automated Tasks folder, and then enjoy their presence in the newly enhanced Automatic Task pop-up 
menu.
9.10.3 Download Some, Download All
Clicking Download All, of course, begins the process of downloading the photos to the folder you've selected. A progress 
dialog box appears, showing you thumbnail images of each picture that flies down the wire.
Connect the camera and turn it on.
Top: Choose Image Capture
 Preferences, click the Sharing tab, and turn on "Enable Web- 
Sharing." Click OK.
Bottom: Now anyone else on the Internet can open Safari, type the IP address provided by the 
Preferences dialog box (see it, just underneath the "Enable Web-Sharing" checkbox at top?) 
into their address bar, and peep at the contents of your Mac's digital camera! (Meet George 
Jetson...) And if they have one of the lucky camera models, they can even click Remote Monitor 
and use the camera as a spycam/Webcam from across town or across the world.

9.10 Image Capture
Clicking Download Some, however, opens the picture browser shown at bottom in Figure 9-6. In either a list view or a slide-
sorter view, you can Shift- or 
 -click the photos you want to download, rotate, or delete from the camera.
9.10.4 Downloading from Across the Network
You're sitting in front of Macintosh #1, but the digital camera is connected to Macintosh #2 downstairs, elsewhere on the 
network. What's a Mac fan to do?
All right, that situation may not exactly be the scourge of modern computing. But downloading pictures from a camera 
attached to a different computer can occasionally be useful—in a graphics studio, for example, when a photographer comes 
back from the field, camera brimming with fresh shots. He can hook up the camera to his Mac so that his editor can peruse 
the pictures on hers from across the building.
To share your camera on the network, hook it up, choose Image Capture
Preferences, click the Sharing tab, turn on 
"Share my devices," and select the camera in question (Figure 9-7). (This trick works with scanners, too.)
On the other Mac, open Image Capture and choose Devices
"Browse shared devices." Open the flippy triangle, select 
the camera, click OK, open Safari, enter the address Image Capture gaver you (Figure 9-7), and proceed to view and 
download the photos exactly as though the camera's connected to your Mac.
9.10.5 Downloading from Across the Internet
You can also share your camera's contents with the whole Internet , assuming your Mac has its own, publicly accessible IP 
address (Section 21.1). Figure 9-7 has the details for the setup.
9.10.6 Image Capture as Web Spycam
All digital cameras can share what's currently on their memory cards via the Internet as described above. If you have one of 
a few newer models, in fact, you can actually control the camera remotely. You can spy on whatever's in the room where 
the camera is, taking snapshots at on demand. (Can you say, "Babysittercam"?)
NOTE
Some of the Webcammable cameras are the Canon A60, A70, S400, S50, and G5; HP C618 and 912; 
Kodak DC280, DC4800, and DC5000; and Nikon D1, D1X, and D1H.
To set this up, begin as shown in Figure 9-7. Then, if your camera is one of the compatible models, the Remote Monitor tab 
(shown dimmed in Figure 9-7) springs to life, along with the buttons labeled Delete, Take Picture, and so on.
Clicking Take Picture captures a picture exactly as you would if you'd been next to the camera and pressed the shutter 
button.
If you click the Remote Monitor tab, you see, at full size, whatever the camera is seeing; the image is updated once every 
minute. (The pictures are blasted to you via the Internet, but not captured onto the memory card.) Click the light-switch icon 
to change the shutter interval.

9.10 Image Capture
9.10.7 Scanning
Assuming you haven't changed the "Open scanner window when Image Capture is launched" setting (in Image 
Capture
Preferences
Scanner), you should see the window shown in Figure 9-8 as soon as you turn on your 
scanner and fire up Image Capture.
Assuming your scanner is compatible with Mac OS X (that is, it's TWAIN-compatible), this 
preview window appears automatically when you turn on the scanner and open Image Capture. 
Open the drawer to specify the dimensions and resolution you want. Click Overview if you need 
to repeat the preview. Drag across the image to indicate which part you want to capture 
(otherwise, the Scan button is dimmed), and then click Scan when you're ready to go.

9.11 iMovie
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
9.11 iMovie
If you have a digital camcorder (MiniDV or Digital8 format) and a few hours of free time—all right, a few weekends of it—
iMovie helps you make astonishingly highquality, fully edited movies. Digital video is great; you can transfer the footage 
back and forth between the Mac and the camcorder a hundred times, but you'll never see any deterioration in quality.
9.11.1 Phase 1: Set Up iMovie 3
The first time you run iMovie, it asks you whether you want to open an existing iMovie file (called a project) or start a new 
one. After that, each time you launch iMovie, it automatically opens up the movie you most recently worked on.
If you click Create Project, you're asked to select a name and location for the movie you're about to make. Once you've 
saved your project, you finally arrive at the main iMovie window ( Figure 9-9).
Here's iMovie in a nutshell. Save your project onto the drive that has the most space (if, indeed, 
you have more than one), because digital video files are enormous. They require 3.6 MB of hard 
drive space per second or 13 gigabytes per one-hour tape. Choose a monitor resolution that's 
1024 x 768 or larger (using, for example, the Displays panel of System Preferences). Poor 
iMovie can't even run at any lower setting.

9.11 iMovie
 
9.11.2 Phase 2: Import Camcorder Footage
After you've shot some footage, connect the camcorder to the Mac using a FireWire cable. If you have the proper cable, 
one end (the six-pin connector) fits your Mac, and the much smaller end (the four-pin connector) goes into the FireWire 
connector on your camcorder, which, depending on the brand, may be labeled FireWire, i.Link, DV In/Out, or IEEE 1394.
Put the camcorder into VTR mode (also known as VCR or Playback mode). If necessary, click iMovie's Camera button, 
identified in Figure 9-9. 
The Monitor window says, "Camera Connected." Now you can click the Play, Rewind, Fast Forward, and other buttons on 
the screen to control the camcorder. Scan your tape to find the sections that you'll want to include in your edited movie.
Every time you click the Import button—or tap the Space bar—iMovie imports the footage you're watching, saving it as a 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (2 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
series of digital-video movie files on the Mac's hard drive. For each scene, iMovie creates what looks like a slide in the Clips 
pane, as shown in Figure 9-9. That's a clip —a single piece of footage that makes up one of the building blocks of an iMovie 
movie. Its icon is a picture of the first frame. On the clip's upper-left corner, you can see the length of the clip expressed as 
"seconds: frames" (there are 30 frames per second in North American video, 25 in the European format).
9.11.2.1 How iMovie organizes its files 
Every time you save a project file, iMovie creates an entire folder bearing your project's name. Inside this folder are three 
key icons that are worth getting to know:
G     Media folder. Inside the Media folder are several, or dozens, or hundreds of individual QuickTime movies. These 
are digital files, one for each clip, sound, picture, or special effect you used in your movie.
Never rename, move, or delete the files in the Media folder. iMovie will become cranky, display error messages, 
and forget how you had your movie the last time you opened it.
G     The project file. This is the file that you actually edit when you work on iMovie. It's tiny, because it contains 
nothing more than a list of internal pointers to the QuickTime clips in the Media folder.
G     The reference movie. If your movie is called Bigfoot, this file is the one called Bigfoot.mov. This icon, too, contains 
references (pointers) to all of the individual movie and sound clips in the Media folder.
The reference movie's primary purpose is to work behind the scenes with iDVD. You may occasionally find the 
reference movie handy for your own purposes, though, as it offers a great way to open a movie you've been 
working on for a quick playback where you don't risk messing anything up.
When you double-click this icon, your iMovie movie appears in QuickTime Player, where a simple tap of the Space 
bar starts it playing.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Automatic Scene Detection
If you let the tape continue to roll, you'll notice each time a new scene begins, a new clip icon appears in the 
Clips pane.
iMovie is studying the date and time stamp that DV camcorders record into every frame. When iMovie detects 
a break in time, it assumes that you stopped recording, if only for a moment—and therefore that the next 
piece of footage should be considered a new shot. It turns each new shot into a new clip.
If you'd prefer manual control over when each clip begins and ends, choose iMovie
Preferences and turn 
off "Automatically start new clip at scene break."
9.11.3 Phase 3: Arrange the Clips
As you're building your movie, you can store your clips in either of two places: the Clips pane or the storyboard strip—the 
Movie Track, for want of an official name—at the bottom of the window (Figure 9-9.). You put clips on the Clips pane before 
deciding what to do with them, and drag them down to the storyboard area once you've decided where they fit into your 
movie.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (3 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
The Movie Track can appear in either of two ways, depending on which tab you click (the film strip or the clock):
G     Clip Viewer. this view, each clip appears as an icon, like a slide on a slide viewer. Each is sized identically, 
regardless of length.
G     Timeline Viewer. Here, each clip is represented by a horizontal bar that's as wide as the clip is long. Parallel bars 
below the clips indicate the soundtracks playing simultaneously.
You can do several things to a clip, whether it's in the Clips pane or the Movie Track. For example:
G     Select a clip. Click a clip's icon to view its first frame and, down on the Movie Track, some statistics (for example, 
when the scene was filmed).
To highlight several consecutive clips in the Movie Track, click one clip, and then Shift-click the last one. In the 
Clips pane, you can also drag diagonally across a batch of them.
G     Play a clip. To play a highlighted clip, press the Space bar. You can also drag the playhead (see Figure 9-9.) to 
view earlier or later parts of the clip. By pressing the right and left arrow keys when playback is stopped, you can 
view your clip one frame at a time, as though you're watching the world's least interesting slideshow.
Adding the Shift key when you press the arrow keys lets you jump ten frames at a time. This 
is more useful when you have a lot of footage to cover.
G     Reorganize the clips. You can drag clips from cubbyhole to cubbyhole on the Clips pane. In fact, you can even 
drag a clip (or even a mass of highlighted clips) onto an occupied cubbyhole. iMovie automatically creates enough 
new cubbyholes to hold them all, and shuffles existing clips out of the way if necessary.
G     Trash a clip. You can get rid of a clip either by selecting it and then pressing the Delete key or by dragging it 
directly onto the project Trash icon (once again, shown in Figure 9-9).
You can't open the Trash, as you can in the Finder; in iMovie, the Trash is the key to iMovie's ten-level Undo 
command. Whenever you delete some footage, iMovie stores it in this Trash can. Then, if you decide to use the 
Undo command, even ten times in a row, iMovie will be able to restore the footage you had cut—by pulling it, 
behind the scenes, out of the project Trash.
That's why, whenever you choose File
Empty Trash (or double-click the Trash can), you lose your ability to 
undo the last ten steps you took.
G     Trim a clip. Unless you have some godlike ability to control precisely when the subjects of your life—your pets, 
your children, your geysers—are at their most video-worthy, you probably don't need to preserve every frame of 
your captured footage for future generations.
To target some footage for deletion, click a clip, position your cursor within the tick marks of the Scrubber bar, and 
drag horizontally until the triangle handles surround the footage you want to keep (Figure 9-9). If you choose Cut or 
Clear from the Edit menu, iMovie promptly trims away whatever was highlighted between the triangles. (If you 
choose Edit
Crop instead, iMovie deletes whatever was outside the highlighted portion.)

9.11 iMovie
Here's a quick trick for highlighting only the first portion of a selected clip: Shift-click within 
the Scrubber bar at the point where you'd like the selection to end. Instantly, iMovie 
highlights everything from the left end of the clip to the position of your click.
9.11.4 Phase 4: Assemble the Movie
Drag the edited clips out of the Clips pane and into the correct order on the Movie Track, exactly as though you're building a 
storyboard or timeline.
You can also have fun with the Movie Track like this:
G     To make a selected clip play backwards, choose Advanced
Reverse Clip Direction (
-R). Even the audio 
gets reversed, offering hours of fun to the kind of people who look for secret messages in Beatles albums.
G     You can adjust the Rabbit/Turtle slider at the bottom edge of the Timeline Viewer to make a selected clip play 
faster or slower.
G     To magnify the Timeline Viewer for a better look, drag the slider at the lower-left corner of the window. It adjusts the 
relative sizes of the bars that represent your clips.
9.11.4.1 Play as you go
As you work, you'll want to play back your movie to check its flow. You may discover that, in the context of the whole movie, 
some clips are too long, too short, in the wrong order, and so on.
G     To play back your entire Movie Track, press the Home key, which means Rewind. When you tap the Space bar, 
iMovie plays your movie from the beginning, one clip after another, seamlessly.
G     To play back only a certain chunk of the movie, first select the clips you want, then click the Play button or press 
the Space bar. iMovie plays only the clips you highlighted.
G     The Play Full Screen button (the darkened triangle to the right of the round Play button) makes the playback—even 
if it's already under way—fill the entire computer screen. To interrupt the movie showing, click the mouse or press 
any key on the keyboard.
NOTE
The quality of the full-screen playback may look a tad grainy. Don't panic. When you transfer your finished 
movie back to your camcorder for TV playback, you'll get pristine, crystal-clear playback.
9.11.5 Phase 5: Transitions, Effects, Titles, Audio, and Photos
Professional film and video editors have at their disposal a wide range of transitions — special effects that smooth the 
juncture between one clip and the next. For example, apart from a simple cut, the world's most popular transition is the 
crossfade or dissolve , in which the end of one clip gradually fades away as the next one fades in.
iMovie 3 offers a long list of transitions, of which crossfades are only the beginning. To see them, click the Trans button 
(Figure 9-10.).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (5 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
Click the name of the transition you want. Use the slider above the Transitions palette to 
specify how many seconds you want the crossfade to last. (One second is fairly standard.) 
Once you've done so, drag the name of the transition into the Movie Track, between the two 
clips . They scoot apart to make room for the new transition icon that appears.
 
When you drag a transition into your Movie Track, the Mac now creates the crossfade — renders it—by superimposing the 
end of one clip with the beginning of the next. When the red progress bar is finished, click in your timeline just before the 
transition, press the Space bar to play, and marvel at your new ability to make home movies look pro.
You can continue working on other parts of your movie, or even switch into another Mac OS 
X program, while the rendering is going on.
To delete a transition, click its icon in the timeline and then press Delete. To edit it (by changing its length, for example), 
click its icon, return to the Transitions palette, make the adjustment, and then click Update.
9.11.5.1 Effects 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (6 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
The Effects button summons a panel full of additional visual effects. Most are designed to create actual special effects that 
simulate fog, rain, earthquakes, lightning, flashbulbs, and bad LSD. (Most are weird and distracting. Use sparingly.)
To apply an effect, first specify which lucky region of footage you want to be affected. (iMovie can apply effects only to 
entire clips, so it may have to split your clip at the endpoints of the selection, and then apply the effect to the central clip.)
Then, on the Effects pane, specify when the effect should begin and end (use the Effect In and Effect Out sliders), its 
intensity, and so on. Finally, click Apply. As usual, the rendering telegraphs its progress with a miniature red progress bar 
on the selected clip.
If you click a clip and then press the Delete key, you're saying: "Throw away the effect. Bring back my original, unmodified 
clip." To adjust the start time, stop time, or other parameters of a special effect, you must first delete the effect altogether, 
and then reapply it using new settings.
It's perfectly possible to combine effects by applying first one, and then another. For 
example, after using the Black & White effect, you may want to use Brightness & Contrast 
control to adjust its gray tones. You can even apply a single effect repeatedly, intensifying 
the result. For instance, you could apply Rain twice at different intensities to add depth to 
your simulated deluge.
If you click such a clip, you can retrace your steps, removing one effect after another with 
each press of the Delete key.
9.11.5.2 Titles and credits
To add rolling credits, opening titles, subtitles, or MTV-style music video credits to your masterpiece, start by clicking the 
Titles button. A list of title animation styles pops up. In the tiny text box underneath the list, type the text you want to appear. 
(Some of the effects, like Rolling Credits, offer pairs of text blobs; see Figure 9-11.)
If you'll want to insert this title in front of a clip, so that the text appears on a black background, turn on the Over Black 
checkbox. If you'd rather have the text appear on top of the video, leave that box unchecked. (Superimposing a title usually 
breaks the clip in half—the part with the title superimposed is now one clip, and the unaffected part is separate.)
Click the Preview button to see what the title will look like. Adjust the timing slider above the list, and then drag the name of 
the title type (such as Centered Title) into the Movie Track.
To eliminate a title, click its icon in the timeline and then press Delete. To edit, click its icon, make changes in the Titles 
palette, and then click Update.
9.11.5.3 Audio
As noted in Chapter 5, the top horizontal band of the Timeline Viewer displays the video component of your movie. For the 
most part, you won't do much with this strip when you're editing audio; its primary purpose is to show where you are in the 
movie.
After you've typed in a couple of pairs, click the + button to tack on yet another pair to your 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (7 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
credits. The program automatically adds the dots and lines up the names (just like real live 
credits!), or places the subtitle beneath the main title, as shown here.
 
The two skinnier horizontal strips underneath it are your playground for audio clips (Figure 9-11.). Both audio tracks are 
equivalent. Each can hold sound from any of these sources:
G     iTunes tracks. When you click the Audio button, iMovie shows you your complete iTunes music collection, 
including playlists, making it easy for you to choose background music for your flick. Double-click a song to listen to 
it; drag its name onto one of the audio tracks to use it in your movie.
G     Narration. This can be anything that you've recorded with your microphone. Drag the Playhead to a spot just 
before you want the narration to begin, click the round, Record Voice button on the Audio pane, and begin to 
speak. You can watch the video play as you narrate. (If the level meter isn't dancing as you speak, check the 
selected sound source in the Sound panel of System Preferences.)
G     Sound effects. From the pop-up menu at the top of the iMovie audio pane, choose iMovie Sound Effects. Now you 
can add any of iMovie's sound effects (laughing, crickets, and so on) to your movie just by dragging them into an 
audio track.
G     MP3, WAV, AAC, and AIFF audio files. Import these popular music formats using the File
Import command.
G     Music from a CD. You can insert a standard audio CD and transfer a song into iMovie to serve as the music for a 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (8 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
scene. (Its contents appear in the Audio palette, and iTunes usually opens automatically to help you catalog the 
CD.) As usual, drag the name of a song to an audio track to install it there.
G     Your camcorder audio. You can turn the ordinarily invisible audio portion of a video clip into an independent 
sound clip, which you can manipulate just like any other kind of sound clip (great for creating voice-overs, echoes, 
audio flashbacks, and so on). To do that, highlight the audio clip and then choose Advanced
Extract Audio.
You can use the three checkboxes at the right end of these tracks to control which ones play 
back. When you want to isolate only one track, turn off the other two checkboxes.
The Timeline Viewer reveals your two parallel audio tracks (shown split in half here, to fit on the 
page). Feel free to drag audio clips between the two sound tracks. And don't miss the Edit 
Volume slider, which lets you create audio adjustments along a sound's length.
 
Fortunately, you can do more with your audio clips than just insert them into the Timeline Viewer. You can lengthen them or 
shorten them, make them fade in or out, shift them to play earlier or later in time, and even superimpose them. Best of all—
and here's one of the most useful new features in iMovie 3—you can make their volume rise and fall over the length of the 
clip.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (9 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
G     Whole-clip volume adjustments. To make a selected clip louder or quieter, drag the volume slider shown in 
Figure 9-12. You can make it so quiet that it's absolutely silent, or you can actually boost it to 50 percent louder 
than the original.
G     Volume adjustments within a clip. In iMovie 3, you can make the volume of a clip rise and fall along its length. 
For example, you can "pull back" the music when somebody is speaking, and then bring it back to full volume in 
between speeches.
When you turn on the Edit Volume checkbox at the bottom edge of the Timeline Viewer, a horizontal line appears 
on every audio clip, stretching from edge to edge (and your video clips, too). This line is a graph of the clip's 
volume.
Click directly on the line and drag upward or downward to produce a temporary volume fluctuation (Figure 9-13).
Each "knot" in the line (the round handle) represents a new volume level that sticks until the 
end of the clip or the next volume level, whichever comes first. To remove a volume change, 
click the orange "knot" to select it, and then press the Delete key.
 
9.11.5.4 Photos
You might want to import a graphics file into iMovie for any number of reasons—to use as a less distracting still image 
behind your titles and credits, for example, or to create a video photo album. If you keep your pictures in iPhoto, a great 
feature awaits.
When you click the Photos button (Figure 9-12), you're shown the contents of your entire iPhoto Library. Using the pop-up 
menu, you can even limit your view to the contents of one iPhoto album or another.
Once you've pinpointed the picture you want, use the controls at the top of the Photos palette to specify:
G     The amount of time the photo will remain on the screen.
G     Whether or not you want the Ken Burns effect , where the "movie camera" pans and zooms smoothly across 
photos, in essence animating them and directing the viewer's attention. (Ken Burns is the creator of PBS 
documentaries like The Civil War and Baseball, which use this effect in abundance.)
Finally, drag the photo out of the thumbnail palette and into the Movie Track. The other clips scoot out of the way to 
make room, and the photo becomes, in effect, a new silent video clip with the duration you specified. (If you turned 
on the Ken Burns effect, iMovie takes a few moments to render the animation. The familiar red progress bar inches 
across the face of the clip.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (10 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
NOTE
If you don't routinely keep your photos in iPhoto, you can also import a graphics file, or even a 
QuickTime movie, right from your hard drive by choosing File ___Import.
To set up a Ken Burns effect, click Start. Use the Zoom controls until the photo is as big as you 
want it at the beginning of its time on screen. Drag inside the Preview screen to adjust the 
photo's position. Then click Finish, and repeat to set up the picture's final size and position. 
(Shift-drag to constrain your dragging to perfect vertical or perfect horizontal adjustments.) In 
short, what you've done is set up the starting and ending conditions for the photo.
 
9.11.6 Phase 6: Meet Your Public
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-11.html (11 of 12)5/3/2004 5:00:15 AM

9.11 iMovie
When the movie's looking good on your Mac screen, you're ready to distribute it to the adoring masses. iMovie offers three 
ways to do that:
G     Export it as a QuickTime movie. Choose File
Export. Choose To QuickTime from the first pop-up menu, and 
choose a quality setting from the second one—for example, Email, CD-ROM, or Expert (that is, manual settings for 
compression, frame rate, and size).
G     Play it back to your camcorder. Put the camcorder into VTR or VCR mode, connect the FireWire cable to your 
Mac, choose File
Export, and choose Camera from the pop-up menu.
From there, by connecting your camcorder to a VCR, you can copy the movie onto a regular VHS tape for 
submission to the Sundance film festival, Cannes, or your mother.
G     Turn it into a DVD. If your Mac came equipped with a SuperDrive (a drive that both reads and records both CDs 
and DVDs), you can create professional-quality DVD discs just like the ones that come out of Hollywood. See 
"iDVD 3," earlier in this chapter, for complete instructions.

9.12 Internet Connect
Internet Connect is primarily designed for people who connect to the Internet via dial-up modem. Here's what you can 
accomplish with Internet Connect:
G     Click Connect to dial out using your current modem settings.
G     Once you're hooked up, check the status display to confirm whether your modem successfully connected to your 
ISP—or if you've been disconnected.
G     You also see your connection speed , to find out if you're really connected at 56 K (ha!).
G     A timer shows how long you've been connected.
G     Internet Connect keeps a neat log of your connection activity (choose Window
 Connection Log). Reading this 
log is about as exciting as reading random entries from the White Pages. Nonetheless, if you're having serious 
connection problems, it can be a useful troubleshooting tool.
G     The "Show modem status in menu bar" checkbox lets you use a menu bar icon to dial and observe your 
connections—without using Internet Connect at all.
Of course, even then, you don't really need Internet Connect to get online. If your dial-up settings are configured correctly 
(see Section 18.2.2), your Mac will automatically dial whenever you launch a program that requires one (such as Internet 
Explorer).
In Mac OS X 10.3, Apple rolled a few other miscellaneous Internet connection functions into Internet Connect. For example:
G     Internet Connect is also your gateway to Virtual Private Networking, a feature that lets you tunnel into corporate 
networks from the road—see Section 21.5. 
G     You can use Internet Connect to initiate PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet, a connection required by certain DSL 
modems), as described in Chapter 18.
G     If you use your Bluetooth-equipped Mac to dial the Net using a Bluetooth-equipped cellphone as a wireless modem 
in your pocket ( man , is that cool!), you can once again use Internet Connect to start and stop the connection. 
Details in Chapter 12.
G     Internet Connect now incorporates the setup programs for AirPort wireless networks (Chapter 12).

9.13 Internet Explorer
Microsoft's Web browser has received a very public demotion in Panther. It doesn't even appear in the Dock when you first 
install Mac OS X 10.3. And no wonder—not only is Safari a superior Web browser in many regards, but Microsoft has 
announced that it has stopped working on Internet Explorer for Macintosh.
Still, as noted in Chapter 20, certain Web sites don't work in Safari, so it's good to have both browsers on hand.

9.14 iPhoto
Once you're hooked on using a digital camera, your free, filmless photos pile up quickly. Before you know it, you have 
6,000 pictures of your kid playing soccer. Just organizing and keeping track of all these photos is enough to drive you 
insane.
Apple's answer to such problems was iPhoto, a simple and uncluttered program designed to organize, edit, and distribute 
digital photos without the nightmarish hassles. Here's the executive summary.
9.14.1 Importing Pictures
Plugging a USB camera into your Mac is the easiest way to transfer pictures into iPhoto. The whole process practically 
happens by itself.
1.  With your camera turned off, connect it to your Mac using the USB cable that came with it. 
iPhoto opens automatically as soon as you switch on the camera (unless you've changed the factory settings in 
Image Capture).
NOTE
If this is the first time you've ever run iPhoto, it asks if you always want it to run when you plug in the camera. 
If you value your time, say yes.
2.  Turn on the camera. 
iPhoto detects that there are new photos available for download.
3.  Click the Import button at the bottom of the screen. 
iPhoto swings into action, copying each photo from your camera to your hard drive. (If you turned on "Erase 
camera contents after transfer," you'll see a final "Are you sure...?" dialog box, affording you one last chance to 
back out of that decision.)
The program also creates a thumbnail of each picture—a tiny, low-resolution version of each photo that appears, 
like a slide on a slide sorter.
4.  Switch to the Finder. Drag the camera memory-card "disk" icon, if you see one, to the Trash. Turn off the 
camera, and then unplug it. 
This is the official Apple-sanctioned procedure for disconnecting your camera.

9.14 iPhoto
You can also import photos, or even folders or disks full of them, by dragging their icons (or 
the disk or folder icons) directly into the iPhoto window.
The large photo viewing area reveals thumbnails of your imported photos. The pane at the 
bottom of the window changes depending on which of iPhoto's four modes you're in—Import, 
Organize, Edit, or Book. In Organize mode, the Size slider controls the size of thumbnails; in 
Edit mode, it zooms in and out of an individual image; and in Book mode, it magnifies or 
shrinks a single page.

POWER USERS' CLINIC
Where iPhoto Keeps Your Files
Whenever you import pictures into iPhoto, the program makes copies of your photos, always leaving your 
original files untouched. Those copies land in a special folder called iPhoto Library, which you can find in your 
Home
Pictures folder.
If all of your photos one day "disappear" from iPhoto, you'll know why: Somebody moved or renamed this 
important folder. It must be in your Home
Pictures folder, and it must be named iPhoto Library. 
(Shareware programs like iPhoto Library Manager permit you to name it other things and file it in other places, 
but you get the point.)
9.14.2 Organizing Photos
You now see a neatly arranged grid of thumbnails ( Figure 9-15). You're looking at what iPhoto refers to as your Photo 
Library—your entire photo collection, including every last picture you've ever imported.
9.14.2.1 The Last Import film roll 
Most of the time, you'll probably work with the photos that you just downloaded from your camera. That's the purpose of the 
roll-of-film icon called Last Import. With one click, iPhoto displays only your most recent photos, hiding all the others. If, at 
any time, you want to return to the grand overview of all your pictures, click the Photo Library icon at the top of the Album 
pane.
You can speed up iPhoto's scrolling by turning off the Drop Shadow option in the 
Appearance section of iPhoto's Preferences window.
9.14.2.2 Opening photos
The easiest way to open a photo for full-size viewing is simply to double-click a thumbnail. Unless you've changed iPhoto's 
settings, the photo opens in the main iPhoto window, scaled to fit into the viewing area.
iPhoto aficionados prefer, though, to use iPhoto's much smarter, but less obvious, method of opening photos: Open each 
picture in its own window. For example, you can:
G     Choose iPhoto
Preferences and change the photo-opening setting. Under the "Double-click" heading, select 
the "Opens in separate window" button. Then click OK.
Several advantages of opening photos in their own windows are illustrated here. Specifically, 
not only can you look at multiple full-size images at the same time—a critical feature when 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-14.html (3 of 10)5/3/2004 5:00:23 AM

9.14 iPhoto
comparing a series of similar shots—but you can also keep your other thumbnails in view, 
allowing you to easily open additional photos without closing the ones you already have open. 
Also, notice how iPhoto tells you, in the title bar, which magnification level it's using to display 
each photo.
 
G     Control-click a photo. Choose "Edit in separate window" from the contextual menu. (If you choose "Edit in separate 
application," you can edit the photo in another program—Photoshop, for example.)
When a photo opens in its own window, all kinds of control and flexibility await you (see Figure 9-16).
9.14.2.3 Deleting Photos 
As every photographer knows—make that every good photographer—not every photo is a keeper. At some point, you'll 
probably want to delete some of the photos you've imported into iPhoto.
Do so by dragging a picture from the Library or Last Import collection to the Trash at the bottom of the Album list (or click it 
and press Delete). Instead of deleting the photo immediately, iPhoto lets it sit there in the Trash, awaiting permanent 
disposal via the Empty Trash command.
Whatever pictures you erase this way also disappear from any albums you've created. (Deleting a photo from an album is 
different, as described later in this section.)
9.14.3 Albums
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-14.html (4 of 10)5/3/2004 5:00:23 AM

9.14 iPhoto
An album is a subset of pictures from your Photo Library, grouped together for easy access and viewing. It's represented by 
a little album-book icon in the album list. (If you've used playlists in iTunes, or the Sidebar in the Finder, you'll recognize the 
concept.) Albums make finding photos much faster. Furthermore, only in an album can you drag your photos into a different 
order.
There's no limit to the number of albums you can add, so make as many as you need to 
logically organize all the photos in your Photo Library. New albums are always added to the 
end of the list, but you can change the order in which they appear by simply dragging them up 
or down in the list.
 
To create an iPhoto album, choose File
New Album (
-N), or click the + button in the iPhoto window, below the 
album list. A dialog box appears. Type in a descriptive name (Yellowstone 2004, Edna in Paris, or whatever), click OK, and 
watch as a new photo album icon appears in the Album pane. (See Figure 9-17.)
You can also drag a thumbnail (or a batch of them) from the photo-viewing area directly into 
an empty portion of the Album pane. In a flash—well, in about three seconds—iPhoto 
creates a new album for you, named Album-1 (or whatever number it's up to). The photos 
you dragged are automatically dumped inside.
In fact, you can drag a bunch of graphics files, or a folder full, from the desktop into the 
Album pane. In one step, iPhoto imports the photos, creates a new photo album, names it 
after the folder you dragged in (if that's how you did it), and puts the newly imported photos 
into that album.

To rename an album, double-click its name or icon. A renaming rectangle appears, with text highlighted and ready to be 
edited.
To add photos to an album, drag them onto its icon. (Putting photos in an album doesn't move or copy them. You're just 
creating creates references to, or aliases of, the photos in your master Photo Library. In other words, each photo can 
appear in as many different albums as you want.)
9.14.3.1 Deleting photos or albums 
To remove a photo from an album, click the album name to view its contents, click the photo you want to remove, and then 
press Delete. The thumbnail disappears from the album, but of course it's not really gone from iPhoto. It's still in your Photo 
Library.
To delete a selected album, choose Edit
Clear or press the Delete key. iPhoto asks you to confirm your intention. 
(Deleting an album doesn't delete any photos, just the references to those photos. Even if you delete all your albums, your 
Photo Library remains intact.)
9.14.4 Sharing Your Pix
The payoff for all of this organizational effort is, of course, showing your photos to other people. iPhoto is endlessly talented 
in this department. After you select some photos or an album and check to make sure that the Organize button is selected 
beneath the thumbnail area, you can click the following icons:
9.14.4.1 Print
iPhoto comes with a number of templates for clustering photos onto each sheet of printer paper, saving both paper and ink.
9.14.4.2 Slideshow 
Onscreen slideshows are easy to set up, they're free, and they make your photos look fantastic. The Mac presents the 
pictures in full-screen mode—no windows, no menus, no borders—with your images filling every inch of the entire monitor. 
Each picture fades gently into the next, producing a smooth, cinematic effect. If you want, you can even add a musical 
soundtrack to accompany the presentation.
Click an album (or highlight a group of thumbnails), and then click the Play button under the Info pane. A moment later, your 
Mac's screen fades to black, and then the show begins. The default musical soundtrack—J. S. Bach's Minuet in G—plays in 
the background. When you've had enough, click the mouse or press almost any key.
For more control, click the Slideshow icon at the bottom of the iPhoto window ( Figure 9-18.).
In this dialog box, you can adjust the speed of slide changing, how you want the show to 
repeat, and which song (from your iTunes collection) you want as the slideshow's soundtrack. 
(Use the iTunes Library pop-up menu to choose any playlists that you've already created using 
iTunes.)

9.14.4.3 Email 
The most important thing to know about emailing photos is this: full-size photos are usually too big to email. They take 
forever to download, they run the risk of exceeding your recipient's In-box limit, and they open up much too large on your 
victims' screens. (It does you no good to email somebody a 3-megapixel photo—2048 x 1536 pixels—when her monitor's 
maximum resolution is only 1024 x 768.)
Fortunately, iPhoto can automatically send a scaled-down, reasonably sized version of your photo instead.
Start by choosing the email program you use in the iPhoto
Preferences command. Then highlight the photos you want 
to send, and click the Email icon on the panel at the bottom of the iPhoto window. In the resulting dialog box, choose a size 
for your photos; "Medium (640x480)" yields a file that will fill a nice chunk of your recipient's screen, with plenty of detail.
Finally, click Compose. iPhoto processes your photos—converting them to JPEG format and, if you requested it, resizing 
them—and then opens your email program, creates a new message, and attaches your photos to it. Just type your 
recipient's email address into the "To:" box, and then click Send.

9.14.4.4 Order prints
This option uploads your selected photos and—for a fee—converts them into handsome Kodak prints that get mailed back 
to you.
9.14.4.5 Order book 
iPhoto's Book feature lets you design and order (via the Internet) a gorgeous, linencovered, 9-by-11-inch hardbound book, 
printed at a real bindery and shipped back to you in a slipcover. Your photos are printed on the glossy, acid-free, single-
sided pages, complete with captions, if you like.
A ten-page book costs $30 (extra pages are $3 each). That's about the least you could hope to pay for a handsome, 
emotionally powerful gift guaranteed never to wind up in an attic, garage sale, or eBay.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Slideshow Smackdown: iPhoto vs. iMovie
I've read that iMovie makes a great slideshow program, too. Supposedly I can import my photos, add music, 
and play it all back full-screen with cool cross-dissolves, just like you're saying here. Which program should I 
use? 
The short answer: iPhoto for convenience, iMovie for control.
In iMovie, you can indeed import photos. You can add them to the Movie Track in any order. What's more, 
you have individual control over their timing (1 second for the first slide, 3 seconds for the second, or 
whatever) and the crossfades between them (dissolve between slides 1 and 2, a left-to-right "wipe" between 
slides 2 and 3, and so on). You can even add the Ken Burns effect: slow, elegant pans and zooms across 
certain photos.
The music options are much greater in iMovie, too. Not only can you import music straight from a music CD, 
but you can actually record a narration into a microphone as the slideshow plays. And, of course, you have a 
full range of title and credit-making features at your disposal.
But iPhoto has charms of its own. Creating a slideshow is much less work, for one thing. If you want a 
slideshow to loop endlessly—playing on a laptop at somebody's wedding, for example, or at a trade show—
iPhoto is also a much better bet. (iMovie can't loop.)
Remember, too, that iPhoto is beautifully integrated with your various albums. Whereas building an iMovie 
project is a serious, sit-down-and-work proposition that results in one polished slideshow, your Photo Library 
has as many different slideshows as you have albums—all ready to go at any time.
Start by putting the photos you want into an album, dragged into the sequence you like. Next, click the Book button below 
the main picture area. You're viewing a proposed layout of your book pages. (In this book-design mode, you can't add 
photos to your album, take any photos out, or rearrange them. You can perform tasks like these only in Organize mode.)
Choose a canned design for the book—from the Theme pop-up menu at the lower-left corner of the iPhoto screen. Then 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-14.html (8 of 10)5/3/2004 5:00:23 AM

9.14 iPhoto
design the individual pages, starting with the Cover (the first picture in the album). For each following page, click the 
thumbnail, and use the Page Design pop-up menu to specify how many photos you want to appear.
Each time you change the number of photos on a page, pictures on the following pages slide 
onto earlier or later pages. This syndrome can drive you wiggy if it winds up disrupting a 
page that you've already tweaked to perfection—a problem you'll almost certainly encounter 
if you don't work on your pages from left to right.
The solution: Once a page has the right photos on it, turn on the Lock Page checkbox at the 
lower edge of the window.
Most themes offer you text boxes that you can fill with titles, explanations, and captions. You're welcome to edit the photo 
titles or comments either in the layout, or in the Info box for the individual photos (at the left side of the iPhoto window).
Before blowing $30 or more on a one-shot deal, proofread and inspect your book design from every possible angle. Finally, 
click the Organize button. In the row of icons at the bottom of the screen, click Order Book.
In the next dialog box, choose a cover color, input your Apple ID or .Mac account name (or sign up for one), specify the 
address for the finished book, and click Buy Now. The hardest part is waiting the three days it takes for the book to arrive.
9.14.4.6 Home Page 
If you have a .Mac account, you can turn an album or a selection of photos into an instant Web-page gallery, complete with 
fast-downloading thumbnail images that your visitors can click to magnify. All you have to do is send your fans the Web 
address provided by the .Mac account.
If you already have a Web site (not a .Mac account), you can create the same attractive 
online gallery by choosing File
Export and clicking the HTML tab. iPhoto will save, to 
your hard drive, a complete set of HTML documents and linked, nested folders (containing 
both thumbnails and full-size images), ready to upload to your site. 
9.14.4.7 .Mac slides 
When you send your photos out into the world as .Mac slides, other Mac OS X users can subscribe to your show, 
displaying your pictures as their screen saver.
To create a .Mac slideshow, select the album or photos you want to share, and then click this button. Click Publish to begin 
uploading your photos. When the process is complete, click Announce Slideshow to email your friends to let them know 
about your slides.
To view someone else's .Mac show, see Section 8.9.1.3.

9.14 iPhoto
9.14.4.8 Desktop 
This button plasters any selected photo in your Photo Library onto your desktop as a wallpaper background. Neat!
If you select multiple photos (or an album), this button turns them into fodder for the Mac OS X screen saver. Wait long 
enough, and they'll appear all by themselves, in gorgeous, panning, cross-fading fashion.
9.14.4.9 Burn 
iPhoto CDs are discs (either CDs or DVDs) that you can create directly from within iPhoto to archive your entire Photo 
Library—or any selected portion of it—with just a few mouse clicks. This is a great way to back up your photos; transfer 
them to another Mac without losing all your keywords, descriptions, and titles; share discs with other iPhoto fans; offload 
photos to CD or DVD as your photo collection grows; or merge separate Photo Libraries (such as the one on your iBook 
and the one on your iMac) into a single master library.
With iPhoto in Organize mode, select the albums or photos that you want to include on the disc, and then click the Burn 
icon. Pop in a blank CD or DVD.
Now take a look at the Info panel just below with Albums list. If the set of photos you want to burn is larger than 650 or 700 
megabytes (for a CD) or about 4.3 gigabytes (for a DVD), it's not going to fit. You'll have to split your backup operation 
across multiple discs. Select whatever number of photo albums or individual pictures you can that will fit on a single disc, 
then, after burning the first disc, select the next set of photos, and then burn another CD or DVD.
Finally, click the Burn icon again. When the process is done, your Mac spits out the finished CD (named "iPhoto Disc"), 
ready to use.
Later, if you want to view the contents of your finished CD in iPhoto, pop the disc back into the drive. Moments later, the 
icon for the CD appears in the Albums list of the iPhoto window. If you click the disc's icon, the photos it contains appear in 
the photo-viewing area, just as if they were stored in your Photo Library.

9.18 Preview
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
9.18 Preview
Preview began life as Mac OS X's built-in graphics viewer—but in Panther, it's much more than that. It's now the program 
you use to view incoming faxes ( Chapter 13), as well as a nearly full-blown clone of Acrobat Reader (the free Adobe 
program that you use to read PDF files).
In fact, because Preview now includes searching PDF documents, copying text out of them, and clicking live hyperlinks in 
them—features that used to be available only in Acrobat Reader—Apple doesn't even include Acrobat Reader with Mac OS 
X. Preview, the company feels, is ready to take over all PDF-reading tasks. (Among other benefits, Preview is a lot faster 
than Acrobat Reader.)
9.18.1 Preview as Graphics Viewer
Preview's hallmark is its surprising versatility. It can display and manipulate pictures saved in a wide variety of formats, 
including common painting formats like JPEG, TIFF, PICT, and GIF (even animated ones; you can add a Play button to the 
toolbar, as described below); less commonly used formats like BMP, PNG, SGI, TGA, and MacPaint; and even Photoshop, 
EPS, and PDF graphics.
9.18.1.1 Cropping graphics 
For the first time in Panther, you can crop graphics in Preview, chopping out unwanted sections. To do that, choose 
Tools
Select Tool (or click the dotted-rectangle tool on the toolbar). Drag across the part of the graphic that you want to 
keep, and then choose Tools
Crop Image (
-K).
If you don't think you'll ever need the original again, save the document. Otherwise, choose File
Save As to spin the 
shrunken image out as a separate file, preserving the original in the process.
You can also rotate an image—even a PDF document—in 90-degree increments and then 
flip it vertically or horizontally, using the commands in the View menu.
9.18.1.2 Converting file formats 
Preview doesn't just open all these file formats—it can also convert between most of them. You can pop open some old 
Mac PICT files and turn them into BMP files for a Windows user, pry open some SGI files created on a Silicon Graphics 
workstation and turn them into JPEGs for use on your Web site, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-18.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 5:00:32 AM

9.18 Preview
What's even cooler, you can open raw PostScript files right into Preview, which converts 
them into PDF files on the spot (a new feature in Panther). Put another way, you no longer 
need a PostScript laser printer to print out high-end diagrams and page layouts that come to 
you as PostScript files. Thanks to Preview, even an inkjet printer can handle them.
All you have to do is open the file you want to convert and choose File
Export. In the Save As dialog box that appears, 
choose the new format for the image using the Format pop-up menu.
For each format, the Options button may be available. When exporting to JPEG, for example, you can choose a Quality 
setting, and—if you plan to use this graphic on the Web—even specify how big it is, in kilobytes, so that you can gauge how 
long it will take to download. When saving TIFF files, you can turn built-in compression on or off.
Finally, click Save to export the file.
9.18.1.3 The Thumbnails drawer
The Thumbnails drawer slides out from the side of the main Preview window whenever (a) you open a multipage PDF or 
TIFF file, or (b) you highlight a bunch of graphics files in the Finder and open them all at once. (If your PDF file has been 
prepared with a table of contents, the drawer shows that.)
To open or close the new Thumbnails drawer (right), click the Thumbnails icon at the left end of 
the toolbar. Incidentally, you can change the size of these miniatures by choosing Preview
 
Preferences and adjusting the slider. In the same dialog box, you'll find buttons that govern 
whether the Thumbnails drawer shows icons, text labels, or both.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-18.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 5:00:32 AM

9.18 Preview
 
The idea is that these thumbnails (miniatures) let you navigate pages or graphics without having to open a rat's nest of 
individual windows. Figure 9-19 expands on the idea.
9.18.2 Preview as PDF Reader
Preview is a full-blown equivalent of Acrobat Reader, the free program used by millions to read PDF documents. Here are 
the basics:
G     Zoom in and out using 
-plus and 
-minus.
G     Use 
-up arrow and 
-down arrow to page through a document. (Page Up and Page Down aren't quite the 
same thing; they shift to the previous or next part of the same page, if it wasn't already visible.) You can use the up 
arrow and down arrow keys alone to walk through the miniature images in the Thumbnails drawer, too.
G     Turn antialiasing (font smoothing) on or off to improve readability; to find the on/off switch, choose 
Preview
Preferences and click the PDF tab. (Though antialiased text generally looks great, it's sometimes 
easier to read very small type with antialiasing turned off. It's a little jaggy, but clearer nonetheless.)
G     Turn on View
Continuous Scrolling to scroll through multipage PDF documents in one continuous stream, 
instead of jumping from page to page when you use the scroll bars.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-18.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 5:00:32 AM

9.18 Preview
Once the Find drawer is open (press 
-F), begin typing into the Find box (top right). Preview 
presents a list of matching phrases in the list as you type, exactly as in the Finder's search bar. 
(The numbers next to the occurrences represent page numbers.) To jump to the spot on the 
actual page, click any of the "items found."
 
G     To find a word or phrase somewhere in a PDF document, press 
-F (or choose Edit
Find
Find) to open 
the Find drawer. Proceed as shown in Figure 9-20.
G     If you want to copy some text out of a PDF document—for pasting into a word processor, for example, where you 
can edit it—click the Text tool (the letter A on the toolbar) or choose Tools
Text Tool. Now you can drag 
through some text and then choose Edit
Copy, just as though the PDF document is a Web page. (You can 
even drag across page boundaries.)
G     You can save out a single page from a PDF as a TIFF file, so that you can use it in other graphics, word 
processing, or page layout programs—some of which might not directly support PDF. (Microsoft Word, for 
example, can accept TIFF graphics, but not PDFs.)
To extract a page, use the usual File
Export command, making sure to choose the new file format from the 
pop-up menu. (If you choose a format like Photoshop or JPEG, you'll be warned that only the currently selected 
page of your PDF document will be converted. That's because there's no such thing as a multipage Photoshop or 
JPEG graphic. But you already knew that.)

9.18.3 The Toolbar
You can have hours of fun with Preview's toolbar. Exactly as with the Finder toolbar, you can customize it (by choosing 
View
Customize Toolbar—or by Option-
clicking the upper-right toolbar button), rearrange its icons (by 
-dragging 
them sideways), and remove icons (by 
-dragging them downward).
Unhappy about the full inch of screen space consumed by the toolbar? No problem. Just 
-
click the toolbar button (the white capsule in the upper-right corner). With each click, you 
cycle to the next toolbar style: large icons, small icons, no text labels, only text labels, and so 
on.

9.22 Stickies
Stickies lets you create virtual Post-it notes that you can stick anywhere on your screen—a triumphant software answer to 
the thousands of people who stick notes on the edges of their actual monitors.
You can use Stickies to type quick notes and to-do items, paste in Web addresses or phone numbers you need to 
remember, or store any other little scraps and snippets of text you come across. Your electronic Post-its show up whenever 
the Stickies program is running Figure 9-21).
In the old days of the Mac, the notes you created with Stickies were text-only, single-font deals. 
Today, however, you can use a mix of fonts, text colors, and styles within each note. You can 
even paste in graphics, sounds, and movies (like PICT, GIF, JPEG, QuickTime, AIFF, whole PDF 
files, and so on), creating the world's most elaborate reminders and to-do lists.
 
9.22.1 Creating Sticky Notes
The first time you launch Stickies, a few sample notes appear automatically, describing some of the program's features. 
You can quickly dispose of each sample by clicking the close button in the upper-left corner of each note or by choosing 
File
Close ( 
-W). Each time you close a note, a dialog box asks if you want to save the note. If you click Don't Save 
(or press 
-D), the note disappears permanently.

To create a new note, choose File
New Note ( 
-N). Then start typing—or:
G     Drag text in from any other program, such as TextEdit, AppleWorks, or Microsoft Word.
G     Drag text clippings from the desktop directly into notes.
G     Drag the icon of a single-page PDF file into a note. (Stickies can't accept multipage PDF files.)
G     Choose File
Import and select any plain text file or RTF (Rich Text Format) document to bring it into a note.
G     Drag a PICT, GIF, JPEG, or TIFF file into a note to add a picture. Or drag a sound or movie in. (A message will ask 
if you're sure you want to copy the whole whomping QuickTime movie into a little Stickies note.)
G     Drag URLs into a note directly from a Web browser's Address Bar.
If one particular note contains your most important information—your to-do list, say—you can 
force it to remain in front of all other windows, even if Stickies itself gets shunted to the 
background. Just click the note and then choose Note
Floating Window.
G     In TextEdit, Mail, or other Carbon applications, select a chunk of text and then choose

Services
Make New Sticky Note. This command launches Stickies, creates a new note, and fills 
it with your selected text—all in one step.
Have a favorite style for your sticky notes? First create a new note, choosing the color and 
text style that you like and setting it to the size you prefer. Then choose Note
Use as 
Default. All new notes you create will now appear in the size, font, and color of your choice.
9.22.2 Growing and Shrinking Notes
Once you start plastering your Mac with notes, it doesn't take long to find yourself plagued with desktop clutter. Fortunately, 
Stickies includes a few built-in tricks for managing a deskful of notes:
G     There's a small resize handle on the lower-right corner of each note. Drag it to make notes larger or smaller on 
screen.
G     The small triangle in the upper-right corner of each expanded note is mysterious in design and function, but it must 
be useful to somebody. It makes each note snap to the same cozy position near the lower-left corner of your 
screen.
G     The best option: Double-click anywhere along the dark strip at the top of each note to miniaturize it into a compact 
one-line mini note, as shown in Figure 9-22. You also can miniaturize a selected note by choosing 
Window
Miniaturize Window ( 
-M).
If the first line of text gets truncated, as in the third note shown here, you can tug the right 
corner of the note and drag it wider without de-miniaturizing it.

9.22 Stickies
 
The most efficient way to use Stickies is to keep the notes in their miniaturized state, as 
shown in Figure 9-22. When a note is miniaturized, the first line of text shows up in tiny type 
right in the collapsed title bar of the note, so you don't have to expand the note to remember 
what's in it. And since many—if not most—of your notes can probably be summed up in a 
couple of words ("pick up dry cleaning," "call Mom"), it's perfectly possible to keep your sticky 
notes in their miniaturized state permanently.
9.22.3 Formatting Notes
Stickies has several word processor-like commands for creating designer sticky notes, with any combination of fonts, 
colors, and styles. (You can also choose from six background colors from the Color menu.) For the full scoop on Mac OS 
X's Font panel, choosing colors, and using the Copy Font command, see Section 13.7.3.
9.22.4 Saving Sticky Notes
The notes you create in Stickies last only as long as you keep them open. If you close a note to get it out of the way, it 
vanishes permanently.
If you want to preserve the information you've stuffed into your notes in a more permanent form, use File
Export Text to 
save each note as a standalone TextEdit document. When you use the Export Text command, you have the following 
options:
G     Plain Text. This option saves your note as a plain text file, with neither formatting nor pictures.
G     RTF stands for Rich Text Format, a special format recognized by most word processors that preserves most 
formatting, including font, style, and color choices. You can open the resulting RTF file in just about any word 
processor with all of your formatting still intact.
G     RTFD. RTFD, a strange and powerful variant of RTF, is a Rich Text Format document with attachments . How do 
you "attach" items to an RTFD file? Drag the icon of an actual application (Clock, Calculator, or whatever) or a 
multipage PDF file, into a sticky note. The icon for the program or document appears in the note, but double-
clicking the icon doesn't do anything. When you export the note as an RTFD file, the result is a TextEdit document 
that has embedded within it the entire program or document that you dragged in. The program icon appears just as 
it did in the sticky note, but if you double-click it, the program now actually launches.

NOSTALGIA CORNER
Kenneth, Where Are the Stickies?
In the days of Mac OS 9, it was easy to find the file that actually stored the text of your Stickies. It was 
called Stickies File, and it sat right there in your System Folder
Preferences folder. Because you 
could see it, you could back it up, copy it when you bought a new Mac, email it to other people, or 
whatever.
Today, the Stickies file is in your Home folder
Library folder. It's just sitting there out in the open. 
You're free to copy it, pass it along, and so on, just as you would any old file.
Make that 151 new features in Panther, Apple!
You can also paste a graphic into your sticky note. When you export the note, the resulting package file will include 
a graphics file of the format that you pasted.
If you don't have embedded programs or documents in your notes, then exported RTFD files are exactly the same 
as their RTF counterparts.
You can import the Stickies file from your old Mac OS 9 System Folder. Just choose 
File
Import Classic Stickies. In the Open File dialog box, navigate to the old System 
Folder
Preferences
Stickies File document and open it.

9.24 TextEdit
TextEdit: It's not just for Read Me files anymore.
As always, TextEdit is a basic word processor—but it's not nearly as basic as it used to be. You can create real documents 
with real formatting, using style sheets, colors, and customized line spacing, and—get this—even save the result as a 
Microsoft Word document. There's even a multiple-level Undo command. If you had to, you could write a novel in TextEdit 
and it would look pretty decent.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The Hidden Stickies Commands
The casual Stickies user may miss some of the program's more interesting commands, which are accessible 
only through the contextual menus that pop up when you Control- click a sticky note. Here's what you'll find 
only in the contextual pop-up menus:
Check Spelling As You Type. Turning on this spell-check option flags misspelled words the moment you 
type them. You must turn this option on or off for each note individually.
Speech. Don't just read your notes—listen to them. You can use the Mac's Text-to-Speech feature to hear 
your notes read aloud. Choose Speech
Start Speaking to hear the Mac read a selected portion of a note, 
or use the command with nothing selected to hear the entire contents of a note. The only way to stop the 
speech is to Control-click again and choose Speech
Stop Speaking.
(To pick the voice and speed of the reader, go to the Speech pane of System Preferences, as described in 
Section 14.5).
Writing Direction. This feature is intended to let you type in non-English languages. But even in English, you 
can have plenty of fun with unsuspecting suckers by choosing Right to Left, so that all your text is right-
justified and the insertion point moves to the left as you type.
Not only can TextEdit open and save Microsoft Word documents, but it even recognizes 
some of the very same keyboard shortcuts. For example, you can advance through 
documents one word at a time by pressing Option-left arrow or Option-right arrow. Adding 
the Shift key to those key combinations lets you select one whole word at a time. You can 
also use the Control or 
 key in conjunction with the right and left arrow keys to jump to the 
beginning or end of a line.
9.24.1 Setting up TextEdit
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (1 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
When you first launch TextEdit, it's not very impressive. You see a blank, untitled document with neither a toolbar nor 
margins. It looks like a nearly useless text editor.
To unleash the program's full potential as a word processor, set things up like this:
G     Choose Format
Wrap to Page. Now you'll see the actual width of your page, with visible margins—just as in 
a real word processor. (The Wrap to Window mode is the marginless view in which your text reflows to fill the width 
of the window.) Wrap to Page view also produces a Zoom menu in the lower-right corner of each window with ten 
different levels of magnification.
G     Turn on the text ruler. If you don't see a ruler at the top of the window, choose Format
Text
Show Ruler 
(
-R). Now the ruler appears, complete with all the standard tools for setting margins, indents, tabs, line spacing, 
and paragraph alignment. It works almost exactly like the rulers you'd find in Microsoft Word or AppleWorks (Figure 
9-23).
G     Fire up the spell-checker. If the Edit
Spelling
Check Spelling As You Type command is turned on, you 
get interactive spell-checking, just as in Microsoft Word and other word processors. That is, misspelled words get 
flagged with a dashed red line the moment you type them.
UP TO SPEED
The Deal with Microsoft Word
Yes, you read that correctly: Humble TextEdit can now open and create Microsoft Word documents! Your 
savings: the $400 price of Microsoft Office!
Well, sort of.
When you open a Microsoft Word document, most of the formatting comes through alive: bold, italic, font 
choices, colors, line spacing, alignment, and so on.
A lot of Word-specific formatting does not survive crossing the chasm, however: borders, bullets, style sheets, 
footnotes, and the like.
Saving a TextEdit document as a Word document (File
Save As) is a better bet, because Word 
understands all of the kinds of formatting that TextEdit can produce. The one disappointment is that Word 
doesn't recognize any style sheets you've set up in TextEdit. The formatting applied by those style names 
survives—just not the style names themselves.
Even so, a built-in Word-document editor is a huge, huge step for the Mac OS. It means that for the most part, 
you can be a first-class citizen on the great playing field of American business. Nobody ever needs to know 
that you're (a) using a Mac, and (b) not using the real Microsoft Word.
9.24.2 TextEdit's Two Personalities
The one confusing aspect of TextEdit is that it's both a plain-text editor (no formatting; globally compatible) and a true word 
processor (fonts, sizes, styles; compatible with other word processors). You need to keep your wits about you as you edit, 
because the minute you add formatting to your document, TextEdit will no longer let you save it as a plain text file.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (2 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
The text ruler gives you control over tab stops, line spacing, paragraph justification, and so on. 
Pressing 
 -R makes it appear and disappear. The Style pop-up menu lists canned sets of 
character and paragraph formatting, so that you can apply them consistently throughout a 
document.
 
Here's the scheme:
G     You can change a plain-text document to a formatted one by choosing Format
 Make Rich Text. The ruler 
appears automatically to remind you that a new world of formatting has just become available.
G     Conversely, you can change a formatted document (a Word file you've opened, for example) to a plain-text 
document by choosing Format
Make Plain Text. An alert message appears to point out that you're about to 
lose all formatting.
G     If you know what kind of document you always want to open, go to the TextEdit
 Preferences dialog box and 
select "Rich text" or "Plain text." That's what kind of document you'll get every time you choose File
New.

9.24.3 Working in TextEdit
As you begin typing, all the usual word processing rules apply, with a few twists:
G     Choose Bold, Italic, and font sizes using the Format
Font submenu, or choose Format
Font
Show 
Fonts (
-T) to open up the standard Mac OS X Font panel (Section 13.7.3). You can even create subscript or 
superscript, change the color of the text (Format
Font
Show Colors), and so on.
G     Common paragraph-alignment options—Align Left, Align Right, Center, Justify— are all available in 
Format
Text submenu. Adjust the line spacing (single, double, or any fraction or multiple) using the Spacing 
pop-up menu in the ruler.
G     You can easily add graphics to a TextEdit file by dragging or pasting pictures directly into a document. The 
program understands TIFF, PICT, JPG, and GIF formats.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Advanced Typography in TextEdit
If you just sprayed your coffee upon reading the heading of this sidebar, you're forgiven. Advanced 
typography in TextEdit? Isn't that a little bit like saying, "page layout in Note Pad"?
Not at all. TextEdit is a gleaming showcase for Mac OS X's typographical smarts.
Most of the commands in the Format
Font submenu should be familiar to you: Bold, Italic, Underline, and 
so on. But a few were once found only in expensive page-layout programs like PageMaker and QuarkXPress. 
For example:
Kern. Use these commands, such as Tighten and Loosen, to nudge the letters of the selected text closer 
together or farther apart—an especially useful feature when you're fiddling with headlines and headings.
There are no controls to set how much you want to kern the text, but you can apply these commands 
repeatedly to the same text selection to intensify them. If you want your text to be very tight, for example, just 
keep choosing the Tighten command. The characters will creep closer and closer together until they crash 
into each other.
 
Ligature. Ligatures are letter pairs, such as fl and ff, that, in fancy typesetting, are often conjoined into special 
combination characters, as shown here. If you choose Format
 Font
Ligature
Use Default (or 
Use All) TextEdit will display these letter pairs with the appropriate ligatures. (This works only if the font you're 
using has those ligatures built into it. New York, Charcoal, Apple Chancery, and all Adobe Expert fonts do, for 
example, but many other fonts don't.)
Baseline. The baseline is the imaginary "floor" for text characters in a line of type. You can push text above 
this line or sink it below the baseline using the Raise and Lower commands in the Baseline submenu. The 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (4 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
Superscript and Subscript commands, meanwhile, shift characters far above or below the baseline, so you 
can write stuff like H20.
Character Shape. In a few fonts, such as Adobe Expert fonts, this submenu offers a choice between 
Traditional Form and specialized type treatments like Small Caps.
Copy Style/Paste Style. If mastering the new Styles pop-up menu (Section 9.24.4) is too much effort, these 
commands offer another way to copy and paste just the font formatting to other text in your document—the 
font, color, style, and size, but none of the actual text or paragraph attributes, such as alignment.
9.24.4 Style Sheets
A style is a prepackaged collection of formatting attributes that you can apply and reapply with a click of the mouse: bold, 
24-point Optima, double-spaced, centered (for example). You can create as many styles as you need: chapter headings, 
sidebar styles, and so on. You end up with a collection of custom-tailored styles for each of the repeating elements of your 
document.
Once you've created your styles, you can apply them as you need them, safe in the knowledge that they'll be consistent 
throughout the document. During the editing process, if you notice you accidentally styled, say, a headline using the 
Subhead style, you can fix the problem by simply reapplying the correct style.
NOTE
Unlike a real word processor, TextEdit doesn't let you change a style's formatting and thereby update every 
occurrence of it. You can't search and replace by style, either.
G     Creating a named style. To create a style, start by formatting some text so that it looks the way you like it, 
complete with font, color, line spacing, tab settings, and so on.
Then, from the Styles pop-up menu in the ruler, choose Other (Figure 9-23). Click Add to Favorites, type a name 
for the style, turn on both checkboxes (Figure 9-24), and click Add.
Highlight the text you want to format. Then, from the Styles popup menu in the ruler, choose 
Other. With each click of a triangle button, you summon a snippet of the next chunk of 
formatting. When you find one you like, you can either click Apply (to zap the highlighted text 
into submission) or Add To Favorites (so that you can reuse this canned style later).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (5 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
 
G     Applying a style. Later, when you want to reuse the formatting you set up, just highlight some text and then 
choose the appropriate name from the Styles pop-up menu. TextEdit applies the formatting immediately.
If you simply click inside a paragraph, applying a style affects only paragraph attributes like 
line spacing, tab stops, and alignment. If you highlight text instead, applying a style affects 
only character attributes like the font and type size.
If you highlight an entire paragraph, however, both text and paragraph formatting appears.
G     Deleting a style. To delete superfluous styles, choose Other from the Styles pop-up menu on the ruler. Click the 
Favorite Styles button, choose the unwanted style's name from the pop-up menu, and click Remove From 
Favorites. Format
Style, then click the style in the Styles list box and click Delete. (Deleting a style doesn't 
affect any formatting that's already in your document; it just removes the name from the Styles menu.)
G     Copying by example. In Word and most other "serious" word processors, the routines above correctly describe 
how you use styles. But in TextEdit, there's a clever new method of grabbing formatting from one place in your 
document and reusing it elsewhere. See Figure 9-24 for complete details. (Note that you can't apply styles in text-
only documents.)
9.24.5 The TextEdit Preferences
Most of the settings in the TextEdit Preferences window have no effect on documents that are already open—only on 
documents you open or create from now on. Most of the settings are self-explanatory; nonetheless, handy explanatory 
balloons appear if you point to an option without clicking. Here are a few settings that may not be immediately clear:
G     Default Fonts. If Helvetica 12 doesn't especially float your boat, you can change TextEdit's starting font. Note that 
you can set two default fonts—one for Rich Text documents and another one for Plain Text files.
NOTE
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (6 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
By definition, plain text files don't have any formatting. So whatever font you choose here for Plain Text files 
is for your editing pleasure only. If you plan to send the file to anyone else, remember that the font choice 
won't be saved with the document.
G     Window width, Window height. These settings have no effect unless you're in Wrap to Window mode. If you are 
in Wrap to Window mode, then these dimensions determine the size of the window that appears each time you 
create a new TextEdit document.
G     Rich Text Processing. When you keep these settings turned off, TextEdit opens and displays HTML documents 
as though it's a Web browser, interpreting the tags and displaying a fully formatted Web page. It handles RTF 
documents the same way, interpreting the behind-the-scenes tags that indicate the font faces, colors, styles, and 
so on. But if you turn on the Ignore checkboxes, TextEdit doesn't interpret the HTML or RTF tags. Instead, it opens 
these files as plain text, so that you can view the raw "source" inside them.
9.24.6 TextEdit's Other Writing Tools
TextEdit includes a few other very useful document-editing tools:
G     Allow Hyphenation. When you select this command from the Format menu, TextEdit breaks up words by syllable 
and inserts hyphens when necessary in order to create more visually pleasing line breaks.
It's especially important to turn this feature on if your paragraph alignment is set to Justify, or 
if you create narrow columns of text. If hyphenation is turned off, TextEdit won't break up 
whole words at the end of a line—even if it leaves big, ugly white gaps between words.
G     Prevent Editing. When you turn this option on (again, in the Format menu), you're locked out. You can select and 
copy text to your heart's content, but you can't change anything. Prevent Editing mode can be useful if you want to 
prevent yourself from making accidental changes to a file, but it's not much of a security feature. (All anyone has to 
do is choose Format
Allow Editing to regain full editing privileges.)
G     Spell Checking. As mentioned earlier, TextEdit can check spelling as you type, flagging questionable words with 
red underlining. To open the full Spelling panel at any time, choose Edit
Spelling
Spelling (or press 
Shift-
-;). Using the panel, you can correct errors (choosing from the suggestions generated by Apple's built-in 
spelling dictionary) or tell TextEdit to learn or ignore other suspected misspellings.
However, the quickest way to handle spelling corrections is shown in Figure 9-25.
This feature isn't really a TextEdit function—it's a system-wide spelling checker that you'll 
also find in Stickies, Mail, iCal, iPhoto, and other programs. You learn it once, you've learned 
it forever.
You're never more than a Control-click away from more accurate spelling in TextEdit. Control-
click a questionable word; the suggestions of Apple's builtin dictionary appear right in the 
contextual pop-up menu, along with the Learn and Ignore commands.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-24.html (7 of 9)5/3/2004 5:00:47 AM

9.24 TextEdit
 
G     Find and Replace. No self-respecting word processor would be complete without a good find-and-replace 
command. Choose Edit
Find
Find (
-F) to search for and replace text in TextEdit documents.
If you use Edit
Find
Use Selection for Find (or 
-E), instead of typing words into 
the Find field, you'll find the next occurrence of whatever text you've already selected in your 
document, without even opening the Find Panel. Select one occurrence of the word you want 
to look for, press 
-E, and then press 
-G to jump to each new occurrence of that word.
G     AutoComplete. This feature, new in Panther (and perhaps in Mac word processors), is great for anyone who's in a 
hurry, who's unsure of a spelling, or who's trying to solve a crossword puzzle. See Figure 9-26 for details.
Once you've begun typing a word, press Option-Esc to produce the list of possible word 
completions shown here. If TextEdit correctly anticipates the rest of the word, great; just 
continue typing to accept the suggestion. If TextEdit guesses wrong, you can either select a 
different word in the list (using the mouse or the arrow keys), or tap Esc or the Space bar to 
keep on typing as if nothing had happened.

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
The Utilities folder (inside your Applications folder) is home to another batch of freebies: another couple dozen tools for 
monitoring, tuning, tweaking, and troubleshooting your Mac.
The truth is, though, that you're likely to use only about six of these utilities. The rest are very specialized gizmos primarily 
of interest only to network administrators or Unix geeks who are obsessed with knowing what kind of computer-code 
gibberish is going on behind the scenes.
Tip: Even so, Apple obviously noticed that as the sophistication of Mac OS X fans grows, 
more people open the Utilities folder more often. That's why Panther features, for the first 
time, a menu command and a keystroke that can take you there. In the Finder, choose 
Go
Utilities (Shift-
-U).
9.25.1 Activity Monitor
Activity Monitor is the result of a merger between two earlier Mac OS X programs known as Process Viewer and CPU 
Monitor. Its function is the same, though: To let the technologically savvy Mac fan check in to see how much of the Mac's 
available processing power is being tapped at any given moment.
9.25.1.1 The Processes table
Even when you're only running a program or two on your Mac, dozens of computational tasks ( processes) are going on in 
the background. The top half of the dialog box, which looks like a table, shows you all the different processes—visible and 
invisible —that your Mac is handling at the moment.
Check out how many items appear in the Process Listing Window, even when you're just staring at the desktop. It's 
awesome to see just how busy your Mac is! Some are easily recognizable programs (such as Finder), while others are 
background systemlevel operations you don't normally see. For each item, you can see the percentage of CPU being used, 
who's using it (either your account name, someone else's, or root, meaning the Mac itself), and the percentage of memory 
it's using.

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Files within Files within Files
It's no surprise that you can include formatted text and pictures in a TextEdit document, but here's a shocker: 
You can also embed an entire program or document within a TextEdit file.
Try this experiment: Create a new TextEdit document in Rich Text mode. Drag the icons from a couple of 
programs into the TextEdit document. Do the same with some documents that were created using native Mac 
OS X programs (another TextEdit document, for example).
When you save the file, Mac OS X saves embedded copies of the applications and documents you dragged 
into the TextEdit document itself. (The TextEdit file is saved in a format called RTFD, which is a Rich Text 
Format document with attachments.)
 
Once you've saved the file, you can double-click any of the icons in the file to launch the embedded items. In 
the TextEdit document shown here, you could launch the Clock, Chess, DVD Player, and Mail programs—all 
right from within the file.
To make things even wilder, it's possible to drag a TextEdit file containing embedded items into another 
TextEdit file, saving a file within a file within a file.
One important point to keep in mind: The double-clickable icons you create in TextEdit using this method are 
not aliases or links to your original documents and programs. They're actual, full copies. If you make changes 
in the original document, they won't be reflected in the copies embedded in the TextEdit file. And if you embed 
a 10 MB program into a TextEdit document, you'll end up with a 10 MB TextEdit file!
9.25.1.2 The System monitor tabs
At the bottom of Activity Monitor, you're offered five tabs that reveal intimate details about your Mac and its behind-the-
scenes efforts:

G     CPU. As you go about your usual Mac business, opening a few programs, dragging a playing QuickTime movie 
across the screen, playing a game, and so on, you'll see the CPU graph rise and fall, depending on how busy 
you're keeping the CPU. On multiple-processor Macs, you see a different bar for each chip, enabling you to see 
how efficiently Mac OS X is distributing the work among them.
The many faces of Activity Monitor.
Top: It can be a graph of your processor (CPU) activity, your RAM usage at the moment, your 
disk capacity, and so on.
Bottom: If you double-click a process's name, you're treated to a three-tab dialog box that 
offers stunningly complete reams of data, mostly of interest only to programmers, about what 
that program is up to. (The Open Files dialog box, for example, shows you how many files that 
program has opened, often invisibly.) The most handy feature of this dialog box is the Quit 
button. It's a handy way to jettison a locked-up program when all else fails.

You may also want to watch this graph right in your Dock (choose Monitor

G     System Memory. Here's a colorful graph that reveals the state of your Mac's RAM at the moment.
The number below the graph shows how much memory is installed in your Mac. If, when your Mac is running a 
typical complement of programs, the Wired number plus the Active number nearly equals your total RAM amount, 
it's time to consider buying more memory. You're suffocating your Mac.
G     Disk Activity. Even when you're not opening or saving a file, your Mac's hard drive is frequently hard at work, 
shuffling chunks of program code into and out of memory, for example. Here's where the savvy technician can see 
exactly how frantic the disk is at the moment.
G     Disk Usage. This little graph offers one of the quickest ways to check out how full your hard drive is at the moment. 
(If you have more than one drive—say, a flash drive, tape-backup drive, or whatever—choose another's name from 
the pop-up menu.)
G     Network. Keep an eye on how much data is shooting across your office network with this handy EKG-ish graph.
9.25.2 AirPort Admin Utility
Don't even think about this program unless you've equipped your Mac with the hardware necessary for Apple's wireless 
AirPort networking technology. (That entails installing a $100 AirPort card in your Mac and setting up a base station, as 
described in Chapter 12.)
Even then, you don't use the AirPort Admin Utility to set up AirPort connections for the first time. For that task, use the 
AirPort Setup Assistant (described below).
After you're set up, you can use AirPort Admin Utility to monitor the connections in an existing AirPort network. (You can 
also use this utility to set up new connections manually, rather than using the step-by-step approach offered by the 
Assistant.)
9.25.3 AirPort Setup Assistant
An Assistant, in Apple-ese, is an interview program. It presents a series of screens, posing one question at a time; after 
answering each question, you're supposed to click the right-arrow (or Next) button. At the end of the interview, the Assistant 
program incorporates your answers into a finished product. It configures numerous System Preferences all at once, for

example.
The AirPort Setup Assistant is the screen-by-screen guide that walks you through the steps needed to set up and use 
AirPort wireless networking. You'll be asked to name your network, provide a password for accessing it, and so on. When 
you've followed the steps and answered the questions, your AirPort hardware will be properly con- figured and ready to use.
9.25.4 Asia Text Extras
The tools in this folder are exclusively for Chinese-speaking Mac fans. The Chinese Text Coverter converts documents 
between Simplified and Traditional Chinese; the IM Plugin Converter lets you create your own customized input methods in 
Chinese.
These tools aren't of any value to you unless (a) you've turned on the Chinese input method on the International panel of 
System Preferences, and (b) you have a clue what you're doing.
9.25.5 Audio MIDI Setup
Maybe you've heard that Mac OS X comes with spectacular internal wiring for music, sound, and MIDI (Musical Instrument 
Digital Interface, a standard "language" for inter-synthesizer communication). It's available, that is, to music software 
companies that write their wares to capitalize on these new tools. (The big-name programs, including Digital Performer, are 
ready to go.)
This configuration program offers two tabs. The first, Audio Devices, is the master control panel for all your various sound 
inputs and outputs: microphones, line inputs, external speakers, and so on. Of course, for most people, this is all 
meaningless, because most Macs have only one input (the microphone) and one output (the speakers). But if you're sitting 
even now in your darkened music studio, humming with high-tech audio gear whose software has been designed to work 
with this little program, you're smiling.
The second tab, MIDI Devices, should look familiar to synthesizer fans who have used software like OMS or FreeMIDI to 
teach the Mac about their studio configurations. By clicking Add Device, you create a new icon that represents one of your 
pieces of gear. Double-click the icon to specify its make and model. Finally, by dragging lines from the "in" and "out" arrows, 
you teach your Mac (and its MIDI software) how the various components are wired together.
9.25.6 Bluetooth File Exchange
One of the luxuries of using a Mac that has Bluetooth is the ability to shoot files (to similarly forward-thinking colleagues) 
through the air, up to 30 feet away. Bluetooth File Exchange makes it possible, as described in Section 6.2.5.
9.25.7 Bluetooth Serial Utility
This utility is designed to let your Bluetooth transmitter serve as a wireless serial port for, for example, HotSyncing with a 
Bluetooth Palm organizer.
Come to think of it, that's about the only example most people can think of for this program—and it comes pre-configured 
for Palm organizers, so most people have very little need to visit this little stub of a program.
9.25.8 Bluetooth Setup Assistant
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (5 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
Getting your Bluetooth-equipped PowerBook to communicate with your Bluetoothequipped cellphone or your Apple 
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse is, in theory, much simpler if you let this little program walk you through the process. When 
everything goes smoothly (as it usually does with a keyboard or mouse), only a few clicks get you where you're going. 
When you run into trouble (as you may when setting up a cellphone), you're in for a call to the phone company's tech-
support hotline, assistant or no.
9.25.9 ColorSync Utility
If you happen to use ColorSync (because you're in the high-end color printing business, for example), you might be 
surprised to find that the ColorSync panel is gone from Panther's System Preferences program. Instead, that panel's 
settings have been merged into this beefed-up program.
This bet-you'll-never-touch-it utility combines two functions:
G     Its Profile First Aid tab performs a fairly esoteric task: repairing ColorSync pro- files that may be "broken" because 
they don't strictly conform to the ICC profile specifications. (ICC [International Color Consortium] profiles are part of 
Apple's ColorSync color management system, as described in Section 13.8.) If a profile for your specific monitor or 
printer doesn't appear in the Profiles tab of this program when it should, this is the tool you need to fix it.
G     The Profiles tab lets you review all the ColorSync profiles installed on your system. The area on the right side of 
the window displays information about each ColorSync profile you select from the list on the left.
G     The other tabs are described in Section 13.8.
9.25.10 Console
Console is a viewer for all of Mac OS X's text logs—the behind-the-scenes, internal Unix status messages being passed 
between the Mac OS X and other applications.
Opening the Console log is a bit like stepping into an operating room during a complex surgery; you're exposed to stuff the 
average person just isn't supposed to see. (Typical Console entries: "kCGErrorCannotComplete" or "doGetDisplay 
TransferByTable.") You can adjust the font and word wrapping using Console's Font menu, but the truth is that the phrase 
"CGXGetWindowType: Invalid window -1" looks ugly in just about any font.
Console isn't useless, however. These messages can be of great value to programmers who are debugging software or 
troubleshooting a messy problem.
9.25.11 DigitalColor Meter
DigitalColor Meter can grab the exact color value of any pixel on your screen, which can be helpful when matching colors in 
Web-page construction or other design work. After launching the DigitalColor Meter, just point anywhere on your screen. A 
magnified view appears in the meter window, and the RGB (red-green-blue) color value of the pixels appears in the meter 
window. You can display the color values as RGB percentages or absolute values, in Hex form (which is how colors are 
defined in HTML; white is represented as #FFFFFF, for example), and in several other formats.
Here are some tips for using the DigitalColor Meter to capture color information from your screen:
G     To home in on the exact pixel (and color) you want to measure, drag the Aperture Size slider to the smallest size—
one pixel. Then use the arrow keys to move the aperture to the precise location you want.
G     Press Shift-
-C (Color
Copy Color as Text) to put on the Clipboard the numeric value of the color you're 
pointing to.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (6 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
G     Press Shift-
-H (Color
Hold Color) to "freeze" the color meter on the color you're pointing to—a handy stunt 
when you're comparing two colors onscreen. You can point to one color, hold it using Shift-
-H, and then move 
your mouse to the second color. Pressing Shift-
-H again releases the hold on the color.
G     When the Aperture Size slider is set to view more than one pixel, DigitalColor Meter measures the average value of 
the pixels being examined.
9.25.12 Directory Access
If you use your Mac at home, or if it's not connected to a network, you'll never have to touch Directory Access. Even if you 
are connected to a network, there's only a remote chance you'll ever have to open Directory Access—unless you happen to 
be a network administrator, that is.
This utility controls the access that each individual Mac on a network has to Mac OS X's directory services —special 
databases that store information about users and servers. Directory Access also governs access to LDAP directories 
(Internet- or intranet-based "white pages" for Internet addresses).
A network administrator can use Directory Access to do things like select NetInfo domains, set up search policies, and 
define attribute mappings. If those terms don't mean anything to you, just pretend you never read this paragraph and get on 
with your life.
9.25.13 Disk Utility
One of Panther's hallmarks is a certain merging frenzy, in which Apple attempts to reduce icon clutter by combining two 
older programs into one new one. CPU Monitor + Process Viewer = Activity Monitor. ColorSync Panel + old ColorSync 
Utility = new ColorSync Utility. And, finally, Disk Copy + old Disk Utility = new Disk Utility.
Put another way, this program serves two key functions:
G     It's Mac OS X's own little Norton Utilities: a powerful hard-drive administration tool that lets you repair, erase, 
format, and partition disks. If you make the proper sacrifices to the Technology Gods, you'll rarely need to run Disk 
Utility. But keep it in mind, just in case you ever find yourself facing a serious disk problem.
G     Disk Utility also creates and manages disk images, electronic versions of disks or folders that you can send 
electronically to somebody else.
The following discussion tackles the program's two personalities one at a time.
9.25.13.1 Disk Utility, the hard drive-repair program
Here are some of the tasks you can perform with this half of Disk Utility:
G     Get size and type information about any disks attached to your Mac.
G     Fix disks that won't mount on your desktop or behave properly.
G     Repair folders, files, and programs that don't work because you supposedly don't have sufficient "access 
privileges."
G     Completely erase disks—including rewritable CDs (CD-RW).
G     Partition a disk into multiple volumes (that is, subdivide a drive so that its segments appear on the desktop with 
separate disk icons).
G     Set up a RAID array (a cluster of separate disks that acts as a single volume).

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
NOTE
Disk Utility can't verify, repair, erase, or partition your startup disk—the disk on which your system software is 
currently running. That would be like a surgeon performing an appendectomy on himself—not a great idea.
If you want to use Disk Utility to fix or reformat your startup disk, you must start up your Mac from a different 
system disk, such as the Mac OS X Install disc.
The left Disk Utility panel lists your hard drive and any other disks in your Mac at the moment. When you click the name of 
your hard drive's mechanism, like "74.5 GB Hitachi iC25N0..." ( not the "Macintosh HD" partition label below it), you see a 
panel with five tabs, one for each of the main Disk Utility functions:
G     First Aid. This is the disk-repair part of Disk Utility, and it does a great job at fixing many disk problems. When 
you're troubleshooting, Disk Utility should always be your first resort. To use it, you click the icon of a disk and then 
click either Verify Disk (to get a report on the disk's health) or Repair Disk (which fixes whatever problems the 
program finds). In other words, First Aid attempts to perform the same healing effects on a sick hard drive as, say, 
a program like Norton Utilities.
If Disk First Aid reports that it's unable to fix the problem, then it's time to invest in Norton Utilities or its increasingly 
popular rival, DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com ).
If Disk First Aid finds nothing wrong with a disk, it reports, "The volume appears to be 
OK." Don't be alarmed at the wishy-washy, not-very-confident wording of that 
message—that's the strongest vote of confidence Disk First Aid can give. Even a 
brand-new, perfectly healthy hard drive only appears to be OK to Disk First Aid.
You may wind up using the Verify and Repair Disk Permissions buttons even more often. Their function is to 
straighten out problems with the invisible Unix file permissions that keep you from moving, changing, or deleting 
files or folders. (The occasional software installer can create problems like this.) You'd be surprised how often 
running one of these permission checks solves glitchy little Mac OS X problems.
Chapter 12 has a much more detailed discussion of permissions.
G     Erase. Select a disk, choose a format (always Mac OS Extended, unless you're formatting a disk for use on an 
ancient Mac running Mac OS 8.1 or earlier), give it a name, and click Erase to wipe a disk clean.
To partition your drive—which involves erasing it completely —launch Disk Utility, switch to 
the Partition pane, and select the hard drive you want to partition from the list on the left. From 
the Volume Scheme popup menu, choose the number of partitions you want (or, for two equal 
chunks, click Split below the map). Now drag the horizontal divider in the Volumes map to 
specify the relative sizes of the partitions you want to create. Assign a name and format for 
each partition in the Volume Information area, and then click Partition.

NOSTALGIA CORNER
Dude, Where's My Erase Disk Command?
Erasing a disk on a Mac used to be easy. All you had to do was select the disk in the Finder and choose 
Special
Erase Disk. But in Mac OS X, there's no Special menu, and the Erase Disk command is nowhere 
to be found.
That's because the Disk Utility program now handles your disk-erasing needs. Launch it, click the Erase tab, 
and blow away the data on the disk of your choice, whether it's a floppy, hard drive, rewriteable CD, or 
rewriteable DVD.
G     Partition. With the Partition tools, you can erase a hard drive in such a way that you subdivide its surface. Each 
chunk is represented on your screen by two (or more) different hard drive icons. (See Figure 9-28.)
There are some very good reasons not to partition a drive these days: A partitioned hard drive is more difficult to 
resurrect after a serious crash, requires more navigation when you want to open a particular file, and offers no 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (9 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
speed or safety benefits.
But there's one very good reason to do it, too: On older Macs that can still restart in Mac OS 9, keeping Mac OS 9 
and Mac OS X on different partitions can save you time when you switch between them, as described in Section 
5.3.
G     RAID. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, and refers to a special formatting scheme in which 
a group of separate disks are configured to work together as one very large, very fast drive. In a RAID array, 
multiple disks share the job of storing data—a setup that can improve speed and reliability.
Most Mac users don't use or set up RAID arrays, probably because most Mac users only have one hard drive (and 
Disk Utility can't make your startup disk part of a RAID array).
If you're using multiple external hard disks, though, you can use Apple RAID to merge them into one giant disk. 
Just drag the icons of the relevant disks (or disk partitions) from the left-side list of disks into the main list (where it 
says, "Drag disks here to add to set"). Use the RAID Scheme pop-up menu to specify the RAID format you want to 
use (Stripe is the most common), name your new mega-disk, and then click Create. The result is a single "disk" 
icon on your desktop that actually represents the combined capacity of all the RAID disks.
G     Restore. This tab, new in Panther, introduces a useful new feature: It can make a perfect copy of a disk or a disk 
image, much like the popular shareware program CarbonCopy Cloner. You might find this useful when, for 
example, you want to make an exact copy of your old Mac's hard drive on your new one. (You can't do that just by 
copying your old files and folders manually via, say, a network. If you try, you won't get the thousands of invisible 
files that make up a Mac OS X installation. If you use the Restore function, they'll come along for the ride.)
Start by dragging the disk or disk image you want to copy from into the Source box. Then drag the icon of the disk 
you want to copy to into the Destination box.
If you want to copy an online disk image onto one of your disks, you don't have to 
download it first. Just type its Web address into the Source field. You might find this 
trick convenient if you keep disk images on your iDisk, for example.
If you turn on Erase Destination, Disk Utility will obliterate all the data on your target disk before copying the data. If 
you leave this checkbox off, however, Disk Utility will simply copy everything onto your destination, preserving all 
your old data in the process. (The Skip Checksum checkbox is available only if you choose to erase your 
destination disk. If you're confident that all of the files on the source disk are 100% healthy and whole, turn on this 
checkbox to save time. Otherwise, leave it off for extra safety.)
Finally, click the Restore button. (You might need to type in an administrator password.) Restoring can take a long 
time for big disks, so go ahead and make yourself a cup of coffee while you're waiting.
Instead of clicking a disk icon and then clicking the appropriate Disk Utility tab, you can just 
Control-click a disk's name and choose Information, First Aid, Erase, Partition, or Restore 
from the contextual menu.
9.25.13.2 Disk Utility, the disk-image program
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (10 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
The world's largest fan of disk images is Apple itself; the company often releases new software in disk-image form. A lot of 
Mac OS X add-on software arrives from your Web download in disk-image form, too.
Disk images are popular for software distribution for a simple reason: Each image file precisely duplicates the original 
master disk, complete with all the necessary files in all the right places. When a software company sends you a disk image, 
it ensures that you'll install the software from a disk that exactly matches the master disk.
It's important to understand the difference between a disk-image file and the mounted disk (the one that appears when you 
double-click the disk image). Figure 9-29 makes the distinction clear.
After you double-click a disk image, go ahead and click Skip in the verification box that 
appears. If something truly got scrambled during the download, you'll know about it right away
—your file won't decompress correctly, or it'll display the wrong icon, for example.
In fact, you can make Disk Utility always skip that verification business, which is a relic from 
the floppy-disk days. To do so, choose Disk Utility
Preferences, click the Verifying tab, 
and turn off Verify Checksums.
The usual life cycle of a disk-image file: First, you download it from the Internet. The result is an 
icon whose name usually ends in .img or .dmg (upper left). (Files that end with .smi are also 
disk images, but self-mounting ones that don't require Disk Utility.) Second, when you double-
click this icon, an invisible program called DiskImageMounter creates an icon that simulates a 
new disk (upper right). Finally, when you double-click this icon, you see exactly what the 
original creator of the image wanted you to see (bottom).

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
You can create disk images, too. Doing so can be very handy in situations like these:
G     You want to create a backup of an important CD. By turning it into a disk-image file on your hard drive, you'll 
always have a safety copy, ready to burn back onto a new CD. (This is an essential practice for educational CDs 
that kids will be handling soon after eating peanut butter and jelly.)
G     You want to replicate your entire hard drive—complete with all of its files, programs, folder setups, and so on—onto 
a new, bigger hard drive (or a new, better Mac), using the new Restore feature described earlier.
G     You want to back up your entire hard drive, or maybe just a certain chunk of it, onto an iPod or another disk. 
(Again, you can later use the Restore function to complete the transaction.)
G     You bought a game that requires its CD to be in the drive at all times. Most programs like these run equally well off 
of a mounted disk image that you made from the original CD.
G     You want to send somebody else a copy of a CD via the Internet. You simply create a disk image, and then send 
that—preferably in compressed form.
Here's how you make a disk image.
G     To image-ize a disk or partition. Click the name of the disk you want (in the leftpanel list, where you see the disks 
currently in, or attached to, your Mac). (The topmost item is the name of your drive, like "484.0 MB MATSHITADVD-
R" for a DVD drive or "74.5 GB Hitachi" for a hard drive. Beneath that entry, you generally see the name of the 
actual partition, like "Macintosh HD," or the CD's name as it appears on the screen.)
Then choose Image
New
Image from [whatever the disk or partition's name is].
G     To image-ize a folder. Choose Image
New
Image from Folder. In the Open dialog box, click the folder 
you want and then click Open.
Disk Utility can't turn an individual file into a disk image. But you can always put a single file 
into a folder, and then make a disk image of it.
Either way, the next dialog box (Figure 9-30 ) offers some fascinating options.
G     Image Format. If you choose "read/write," your disk image file, when doubleclicked, will turn into a superb imitation 
of a hard drive. You'll be able to drag files and folders onto it, drag them off of it, change icons' names on it, and so 
on.
If you choose "read-only," however, the result will behave more like a CD. You'll be able to copy things off of it, but 
not make any changes to it.
The "compressed" option is best if you intend to send the resulting file by email, for example, or if you'd like to 
preserve the disk image on some backup disk for a rainy day. It takes a little longer to create a simulated disk when 
you double-click the disk image file, but it takes up a lot less disk space than an uncompressed version.
Finally, choose "DVD/CD master" if you're copying a CD or a DVD. The resulting file is a perfect mirror of the 
original disc, ready for copying onto a blank CD or DVD when the time comes.
G     Encryption. Here's a great way to lock private files away into a vault that nobody else can open. If you choose 
"AES-128 (recommended)," you'll be asked to assign a password to your new image file. Nobody will be able to 
open it without the password—not even you. Furthermore, if you save it into your Keychain (Section 12.4.1.2), it 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (12 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
won't be such a disaster if you forget the password.
G     Save As. Choose a name and location for your new image file. The name you choose here doesn't need to match 
the original disk or folder name.
These two pop-up menus let you specify (a) what kind of disk image you want, and (b) whether 
or not you want it password-protected. The latter option is great when you want to password-
protect one folder, without bothering with your entire Home folder.
 
When you click Save (or press Enter), if you opted to create an encrypted image, you'll be asked to make up a password at 
this point.
Otherwise, Disk Utility now creates the image and then mounts it—that is, turns the image file into a simulated, yet fully 
functional, disk icon on your desktop.
When you're finished working with the disk, eject it as you would any disk (Controlclick it and choose Eject, for example). 
Hang onto the .dmg disk image file itself, however. This is the file you'll need to double-click if you ever want to recreate 
your "simulated disk."
9.25.13.3 Turning an image into a CD
One of the other most common disk-image tasks is turning an image back into a CD or DVD—provided you have a CD or 
DVD burner on your Mac, of course.
All you have to do is drag the .dmg file into the Disk Utility window, select it, and click the Burn icon on the toolbar (or, 
alternatively, Control-click the .dmg icon and choose Burn from the contextual menu). Insert a blank CD or DVD, and then 
click Burn.
9.25.14 Grab
Grab takes pictures of your Mac's screen, for use when you're writing up instructions, illustrating a computer book, or 
collecting proof of some secret screen you found buried in a game. You can take pictures of the entire screen (press 
-Z, 
which for once in its life does not mean Undo) or capture only the contents of a rectangular selection (press Shift-
-A). 
When you're finished, Grab displays your snapshot in a new window, which you can print, close without saving, or save as 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (13 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
a TIFF file, ready for emailing or inserting into a manuscript.
Now, as experienced Mac users already know, the Mac OS has long had its own builtin shortcuts for capturing screenshots: 
Press Shift-
-3 to take a picture of the whole screen, and Shift-
-4 to capture a rectangular selection.
So why use Grab instead? In many cases, you shouldn't. The Shift-
-3 and Shift-
-4 shortcuts work like a dream. But 
there are some cases in which it might make more sense to opt for Grab. Here are three:
G     Grab can make a timed screen capture (choose Capture
Timed Screen, or press Shift-
-Z), which lets you 
enjoy a ten-second delay before the screenshot is actually taken. After you click the Start Timer button, you have 
an opportunity to activate windows, pull down menus, drag items around, and otherwise set up the shot before 
Grab shoots the picture.
G     When you capture a screenshot using Grab's Selection command, the size of your selection is displayed, in pixels, 
right under the pointer as you drag. If you need to capture a 256-pixel-wide square, for example, you can do so 
with pinpoint accuracy. (Choose Edit
Inspector to read the dimensions of a screenshot after you capture it.)
G     With Grab, you have the option of including the cursor in the picture, which is extremely useful when you're 
showing a menu being pulled down or a button being clicked. (Mac OS X's screenshot keystrokes, by contrast, 
always eliminate the pointer.) Use the technique described in Figure 9-31 to add the pointer style of your choice to 
a Grab screenshot.
One of the advantages Grab offers over simply snapping screenshots with Shift-
- 3 or 
Shift-
-4 is that it lets you include the pointer/cursor in the picture—or hide it. Choose

Actually, if you're going to write a book or manual about Mac OS X, the program you really 
need is SnapzPro X (available for download from www.missingmanuals.com, among other 
places). It offers far more flexibility than any of Mac OS X's own screenshot features. For 
example, you have a choice of file format, you can neatly snip out just one dialog box or 
window with a single click, and you can even capture movies of screen activity.

nothing for you to configure or set up.
9.25.16 Java
Programmers generally use the Java programming language to create small programs that they then embed into Web 
pages—animated effects, clocks, calculators, stock tickers, and so on. Your browser automatically downloads and runs 
such applets (assuming that you have "Enable Java" turned on in your browser).
Your Java folder contains several Java-related tools, including Applet Launcher, Java Plugin Settings, and Web Start.
9.25.16.1 Applet Launcher
So-called Java applets are really just programs. So, what if you want to run one without going through a Web site and 
launching your Web browser? Applet Launcher (Figure 9-32 ) lets you open and launch Java applets without relying on a 
Web browser.
You might wonder—where do you find Java applets to run with Applet Launcher? Just launch 
your browser and type free Java applets into any search engine. You'll find Web sites galore 
containing hundreds of applets—games, utilities, animations, and more—that you can 
download immediately. Once you've downloaded them, use Applet Launcher to open the .
html file associated with each applet.
Thanks to the Applet Viewer, you can use your Mac to run hundreds of free Java applets 
available for download over the Internet, such as this vintage Commodore 64 era game.
 
Once you're running an applet in the Applet Viewer, an Applet menu appears in the menu bar, containing a few self-

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
explanatory commands, such as Stop, Start, Restart, and Reload. If an applet locks up, the Restart command can generally 
revive it.
9.25.16.2 Java Plugin Settings
These tiny configuration programs offer a few random settings that pertain to the Mac's Java Virtual Machine (the "engine" 
that runs Java applets). The average person will never need to adjust these settings. But if you're the kind of person who 
knows what to do with options like "Recycle Classloader," go wild.
9.25.16.3 Java Web Start
Java Web Start isn't an Apple product—it's a free program from Sun Microsystems designed to streamline the process of 
downloading and running Java-based programs on your Mac.
If you want to see what this is all about, fire up your browser and go to java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html to 
access a page of demo programs. When you click one of the demo Launch buttons, Java Web Start (JWS) kicks in to 
download all the necessary files and start running the program you select—all with one click, and without relying on the 
Web browser. In fact, JWS doesn't just run Java programs; it also stores them on your system so you can launch them 
again later. To launch a Java-based program, double-click its icon, or choose View
Downloaded Applications in JWS.
The catch is that Java Web Start is a fledgling technology and only a handful of (mostly lame) demo programs are available 
that actually make use of JWS.
Ultimately, Sun hopes that JWS will become an important software distribution tool, enabling people to connect to a Web 
site, click a button, and start using whatever program they need. It's a great concept—but still mostly just a concept.

Sleuthing Around with NetInfo Manager
While most of NetInfo Manager is of little use to a typical Mac user, a few parts of this utility can be valuable 
even to a non-system administrator.
To dive into NetInfo Manager, start by clicking the padlock button at the bottom of the main window and enter 
an administrator's password. Then examine the various parameters in the top-left Directory Browser list. As 
you'll quickly discover, most of these settings are written in Unix techno-speak.
A few, however, are easy enough to figure out. If you click users in the middle list, you'll see, in the next 
column, a list of accounts you've created. Click one of the account names there, and you'll see, in the 
properties pane at the bottom of the screen, some parameters that may come in handy—such as each 
person's name, password, and password hint.
By double-clicking one of these info items, you can edit it, which can come in genuinely handy if someone on 
your school or office network forgets her password.

Keychain Access manages all your secret information—passwords for network access, file servers, FTP sites, Web pages, 
and other secure items. For instructions on using Keychain Access, see Chapter 12 .
9.25.18 NetInfo Manager
NetInfo is the central Mac OS X database that keeps track of user and group accounts, passwords, access privileges, email 
configurations, printers, computers, and just about anything else network related. NetInfo Manager is where a network 
administrator (or a technically inclined Mac guru) can go to view and edit these various settings.
You can find more information about NetInfo in these places:
G     The tutorials in the relevant sections of this book, such as in Section 11.8 and Section 12.4.
G     Article #106416 ("NetInfo: What is it? How to Set Up NetInfo") at kbase.info.apple.com, and the associated 
downloadable PDF manual.
9.25.19 Network Utility
The Network Utility gathers information about Web sites and network citizens. It offers a suite of standard Internet tools like 
NetStat, Ping, Traceroute, Finger, and Whois—advanced tools, to be sure, but ones that even novice Mac users may be 
asked to fire up when calling a technician for Internet help.
Otherwise, you probably won't need to use Network Utility to get your work done. However, Network Utility can be useful 
when you're performing Internet detective work:
G     Use Whois ("who is") to gather an amazing amount of information about the owners of any particular domain (such 
as www.apple.com )—including name and address info, telephone numbers, and administrative contacts—using 
the technique shown in Figure 9-33.
G     Use Ping to enter a Web address (such as www.google.com), and then "ping" (send out a "sonar" signal to) the 
server to see how long it takes for it to respond to your request. Network Utility reports the response time in 
milliseconds—a useful test when you're trying to see if a remote server (a Web site, for example) is up and running. 
(The time it takes for the ping to report back to you also tells you how busy that server is.)

Just type in the network address or URL, and then click Trace. You'll see that your request actually jumps from one 
trunk of the Internet to another, from router to router, as it makes its way to its destination. You'll find that a 
message sometimes crisscrosses the entire country before it arrives at its destination. You can also see how long 
each leg of the journey took, in milliseconds.
The Whois tool is a powerful part of Network Utility. First enter a domain that you want 
information about, then choose a Whois server from the pop-up menu (you might try whois. 
networksolutions.com). When you click the Whois button, you'll get a surprisingly revealing 
report about the owner of the domain, including phone numbers, fax numbers, contact names, 
and so on.
 
9.25.20 ODBC Administrator
This program is designed to arbitrate ODBC access requests. Any questions?
If you have no idea what that means, and no corporate system administrator has sat down to explain it to you, then your 
daily work probably doesn't involve working with corporate ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) databases. You can 
ignore this program or throw it away.
9.25.21 Printer Setup Utility
This is the hub of your Mac's printing operations. You can use the Printer Setup Utility (formerly called Print Center) to set 
up and configure new printers, and to check on the status of print jobs, as described in Chapter 13.
9.25.22 StuffIt Expander
StuffIt Expander, a free program from Aladdin Systems, is an indispensable utility for decompressing and decoding files, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-9-SECT-25.html (18 of 23)5/3/2004 5:00:55 AM

9.25 Utilities: Your Mac OS X Toolbox
especially those that you download from the Internet or receive as email attachments. It automatically restores all kinds of 
compressed files into usable form, including StuffIt files (whose names end with .sit), Zip files (.zip), BinHex files (.hqx), 
UUEncoded files (.uu), MIME or Base64 files (.mime), and—especially important in Mac OS X—.tar and .gzip files, which 
were once found only on Unix machines. (Now your Mac is a Unix machine.)
Usually, you needn't do anything with StuffIt Expander. It just does its thing automatically whenever you download a 
compressed file. That's because most Web browsers summon Expander the moment they recognize that you've 
downloaded a compressed file.
If, for some reason, you end up with a .sit or .zip file on your Mac that needs decompressing —and StuffIt Expander hasn't 
been launched automatically—just drag the file onto the StuffIt Expander icon to expand it.
9.25.23 System Profiler
System Profiler (previously called Apple System Profiler) is a great tool for learning exactly what's installed on your Mac 
and what's not—in terms of both hardware and software. (The people who answer the phones on Apple's tech-support line 
are particularly fond of System Profiler, since the detailed information it reports can be very useful for troubleshooting nasty 
problems.)
Instead of burrowing into your Utilities folder to open System Profiler, it's usually faster to use 
this trick: Choose 
About This Mac. In the resulting box, click the More Info button. 
Boom—System Profiler opens. (Oh, and if you click your Mac OS X version twice in the 
About box, you see your Mac's serial number!)

The XCode (Developer Tools) CD Extras
Starting with the Panther version, the Mac OS comes on three CDs (or one DVD) for the first time—and that's 
not even counting the mysterious fourth CD, labeled XCode Tools, that comes in the Mac OS X box. (If Mac 
OS X came with your Mac, the Developer CD may be a disk image on one of your Software Restore discs. 
Use Disk Utility to burn this image onto a real CD, as described in Section 9.25.13.)
The XCode Tools CD is intended for developers (programmers) who write Mac OS X software. You'll need 
some of these programs if you want to get into some of the more esoteric (or, as some would say, fun) Mac 
OS X tricks and tips, like those in the book Mac OS X Hints.

To install these tools, double-click Developer.mpkg in the CD window. You wind up with a new folder called 
Developer on your hard drive. In its Applications
Utilities
Built Examples folder, you'll find a few 
programs that are userfriendly enough even for nonprogrammers.
BlastApp, for example, is a fun fly-the-helicopter-throughthe- cave arcade-style game. Another example: 
Sketch is a simple drawing program. If you're a Mac old-timer, you might describe it as something along the 
lines of the old MacDraw. It makes smooth lines, circles, and text boxes.
Here, too, you'll find a strange hybrid: a Mac OS X version of SimpleText, which 99.999 percent of Mac users 
probably assume is a Mac OS 9-only program. Why is this handy? Because it offers a Sound
Record 
feature —the only place in Mac OS X where you'll find a simple sound-recording tool (not counting iMovie). 
(WorldText, in the same folder, is similar, but with more features, including paragraph-justification commands.)
When you launch System Profiler, it reports information about your Mac in a list down the left side (Figure 9-34).
They fall into these categories:
G     Hardware. Click this word to see precisely which model Mac you have, what kind of chip is inside (and how many), 
how much memory it has, and its serial number.
If you expand the flippy triangle, you get to see details about which Memory slots are filled and the size of the 
memory module in each slot (which spares you from having to stick your fingers into your Mac's case to find out 
what's in there); what PCI/AGP Cards are installed in your expansion slots (including what graphics card you 
have); what's attached to your ATA bus (internal drives, like your DVD drive and hard drive); what's connected to 
your SCSI, USB, and FireWire chains, if anything; details on your AirPort Card, if you have one; and what 
Modems you have.
Does your PowerBook's chip run at 800 MHz or 1.25 GHz? What percentage of your external 
hard drive is filled up? Want a comprehensive list of every program installed on your Mac, with 
version numbers? And (shown here): Does your G4 tower have any open slots for extra RAM?

Finally, the Network section reveals which kind of network your Mac is on and, if you have a networkable printer, which 
printer is selected.
G     Software. Click this heading to see exactly which version of Mac OS X you have, and what your computer's name 
is, as far as the network is concerned ("Chris's Computer,") for example.
The Applications list documents every program on your system, with version information—a quick inventory of 
what you've installed on your Mac. It's great for spotting duplicate copies of programs.
Similar information shows up in the Extensions panel. In this sense, "extensions" doesn't mean system extensions 
like those that made life a living hell in Mac OS 9 and earlier. In Mac OS X, the term extensions refers to a different 
kind of add-on component to the core system software. Generally, these are drivers for the Mac's various 
components, which sit in the System
Library
Extensions folder. Whatever's in that folder is what you see 
listed in this panel.
G     Network. This category shows all the different ways your Mac can connect to other computers (AirPort, Ethernet, 
Internet Modem, Bluetooth, and so on), and which ones are online at the moment (as indicated by whether or not 
they display IP Addresses).
G     Finally, the Logs panel reveals your Mac's secret diary: a record of the traumatic events that it experiences from 
day to day. (Many of these are the same as those revealed by the Console utility.) Some reveal crash logs, which 
are detailed technical descriptions of what went wrong when various programs crashed, and what was stored in 
memory at the time.
Unfortunately, there's not much plain English here to help you understand the crash, or how to avoid it in the future. 
Most of it runs along the lines of "Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001); Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS 
(0x0001) at 0x2f6b657d." In other words, it's primarily for the benefit of programmers. Still, tech-support staff may 
occasionally ask to see the information in one of these logs, as described next.

Secrets of the Plug-Ins
Mac OS X programs can be built out of modular chunks, which is one of the features that programmers like so 
much about it. Several of Panther's built-in programs, in fact, come with additional software chunks that you 
can turn on or off at will.
Here's an example: the Calculator. Did you know that it has a graphing mode—perfect for high-school math?
To explore the invisible world of plug-ins, highlight Calculator's icon, and then choose File
Get Info. 
Expand the Plug-ins panel, which you've probably never seen before in a Get Info window.
Right now, the Calculator views you know and love are listed here: Basic&Sci.calcview, which refers to the 
Basic and Scientific views. But there are others.
 
Click Add. In the resulting Add Plug-ins window, navigate to your 
Applications
Calculator
Contents
Resources folder. (It might seem strange to click Calculator as 
though it's a folder, but that's actually what it is; see Section 4.2.)
The plug-ins to install look like folders, and they're called Graphing-2d.calcview, Hexadecimal. calcview, and 
ExpressionSheet. calcview. Open one or all of them (highlight the folder and then click Open).
You return to the Get Info window, where these additional views are now listed. Now open Calculator and 
inspect the View menu. You've got the 2-D Graphing mode (type an equation, click Graph); Expression Sheet 
(a simple type-an-equation mode); and Hexadecimal (for programmers).
Presto: the humble Calculator is now SuperCalc!

that the resulting report can be well over 100 pages long. In many cases, you're better off simply making a screen shot of

Terminal opens a terminal window with a command line interface, taking you deep into the world of Unix, the operating 
system on which Mac OS X is based. Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 offer a crash course on this powerful window into the 
Mac's shadow operating system.

10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
Apple shocked the world when, in 1997, it introduced the iMac without a floppy disk drive—and proceeded to eliminate the 
floppy drive from all subsequent Mac models in the following years. Apple argues that the floppy disk is dead: It's too small 
to serve as a backup disk, and, in this day of the Internet, it's a redundant method of exchanging files with other computers.
These days, even Windows PC manufacturers seem to agree the floppy drive is gradually vanishing as standard 
equipment. So, for that matter, is the Zip disk, the SuperDisk (a high-capacity floppy), and Iomega Peerless drives (a hard 
drive cartridge system).
10.1.1 Disks Today
So what's springing up to take the floppy's place? Let us count the disks:
10.1.1.1 Hard drives and the iPod
Thanks to the Mac's FireWire or USB jacks, it's easier than ever to attach an external hard drive for extra storage. It would 
be hard to imagine a more convenient second hard drive than, for example, Apple's iPod, which is not only an outstanding 
MP3 music player but also doubles as a self-powered, extremely compact, bootable hard drive.
10.1.1.2 CDs
You wouldn't get far in today's computer world without a CD-ROM drive. Most commercial software comes on CD—not to 
mention the music CDs that the Mac can play so expertly.
CD-ROM stands for "compact disc, read-only memory"—in other words, you can't ever write (save files) onto them.
Yet most Mac models today don't just play CDs; they can also record them, thanks to a built-in CD burner. A CD burner can 
record onto either of two kinds of blank discs:
G     CD-R. You can fill this type of disc with your own files—once. The disc can't be erased, although you can add to it 
(see Section 10.2).
G     CD-RW. The initials stand for rewritable; using Disk Utility (Section 9.25.13), you can erase one of these discs and 
rerecord it, over and over again. Of course, CD-RW and DVD-RW blank discs are somewhat more expensive than 
the one-shot kind.
10.1.1.3 DVDs
Many Mac laptops and desktops include a built-in DVD drive. You use it primarily for playing back DVD movies that you've 
rented or bought, but you may also occasionally use it for data DVDs—that is, DVDs that contain Mac files or software 
installers.
However, the latest—and definitely the greatest—kind of drive is what Apple calls the SuperDrive: a drive, actually made by 
Pioneer or Sony, that can play and record CDs and DVDs. If your Mac came with a SuperDrive built in, you can take 
advantage of a Mac OS X feature that neither Windows nor any previous version of the Mac OS offers: the ability to use 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-1.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:00 AM

10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
blank DVDs as massive backup disks that hold 4.7 GB each.
You may see all kinds of disks on the Mac OS X desktop (shown here: hard drive, CD, iPod, 
iDisk)—or none at all, if you've chosen to hide them using the Finder
Preferences command. 
But chances are pretty good you won't be seeing many floppy disk icons.
 
If you've used iMovie to edit your home camcorder footage, you can also save them onto one of these DVDs for playback in 
standard home DVD players—the perfect way to distribute your masterpiece to friends and family without the drastic 
sacrifice of video quality that would result in saving the movie onto a VHS tape.
The first generations of SuperDrive could record only onto so-called DVD-R and DVD-RW blank discs (note the hyphen). 
The latest SuperDrives, found in, for example, the Power Mac G5, can also record your files onto DVD+R and DVD+RW 
discs (note the plus sign), a confusingly similar format that doesn't work in the original SuperDrives.
10.1.1.4 Flash drives
The most recent invention is among the most convenient: tiny, keychain-sized flash drives or thumb drives, which plug 
directly into your USB jack and serve as low-capacity hard drives with no moving parts. Inside, they contain nothing but 
RAM—pure memory.
Flash drives are fantastic, inexpensive gadgets that typically hold 128, 256, or 512 MB. They work on any Mac or Windows 
PC, and don't require any drivers or special software installation. Ask for one for your birthday.
10.1.2 Disks In, Disks Out
When you insert a disk, its icon shows up in three places (unless you've changed your Finder preferences): on the right 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-1.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:00 AM

10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
side of the screen, in the Computer window, and in the Sidebar (Section 1.2.1). To see what's on a disk you've inserted, just 
double-click its icon.
NOTE
You can make the Mac work like Windows, if you choose. For example, to open a single window containing 
icons of all currently inserted disks, choose Go
Computer (which produces the rough equivalent of the 
My Computer window).
To complete the illusion that you're running Windows, you can even tell Mac OS X not to put disk icons on 
the desktop at all. Just choose Finder
Preferences and turn off the three top checkboxes—"Hard disks," 
"Removable media (such as CDs)," and "Connected servers." They'll no longer appear on the desktop—only 
in your Computer window. (You can stop them from appearing in the Sidebar, too, by clicking the Sidebar 
button in the Finder preferences and turning off the same checkboxes.)
To remove a disk from your Mac, use one of these methods:
G     Drag its icon onto the Trash icon. For years, this technique has confused and frightened first-time Mac users. 
Their typical reaction: Doesn't the Trash mean "delete"? Yes, but only when you drag document or folder icons 
there—not disk icons. Dragging disk icons onto the Trash (at the right end of the Dock) makes the Mac spit them 
out. (If you've dragged a disk image icon or the icon of a networked disk, this maneuver unmounts them—that is, 
gets them off your screen.)
The instant you begin dragging a disk icon, the Trash icon on the Dock changes form, as though to reassure the 
novice that dragging a disk icon there will only eject. As you drag, the wastebasket icon morphs into a giant-sized 
Eject logo (which matches the symbol on the upper-right key of current Mac keyboards).
G     Highlight the disk icon, and then choose File
Eject (
-E). The disk pops out.
G     Control-click the disk icon. Choose Eject from the contextual menu.
G     Use the Sidebar. Click the little 
 button next to a disk's name in the Sidebar, as described in Section 1.2.2. 
Any of these techniques also work to get network disks and disk images off your screen, too.
G     Hold down the Eject key on your keyboard. Recent Mac keyboards, both on laptops and desktops, have a 
special Eject key in the upper-right corner. Hold it down for a moment to make a CD or DVD pop out. (If you don't 
have an Eject key, press F12 instead.)
10.1.3 Startup Disks
When you turn the Mac on, it hunts for a startup disk—that is, a disk containing a System folder. If you've ever seen the 
dispiriting blinking folder icon on a Mac's screen, you know what happens when the Mac can't find a startup disk. It blinks 
like that forever, or until you find and insert a disk with a viable System folder on it.
10.1.3.1 Creating a startup disk
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-1.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:00 AM

10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
By installing the Mac OS onto a disk—be it a hard drive or blank CD or DVD—you can create a startup disk. Not all disks 
are capable of starting up the Mac, however (older external FireWire disks, for example), and not all older Macs can start up 
from external FireWire drives.
10.1.3.2 Selecting a startup disk
It's perfectly possible to have more than one startup disk simultaneously attached to your Mac. That's the deal, for example, 
whenever you've inserted the Mac OS X

When I push the Eject button on my keyboard (or on my CD-ROM drawer), how come the CD doesn't come 
out? 
There might be two things going on. First of all, to prevent accidental pushings, the Eject key on the modern 
Mac keyboard is designed to work only when you hold it down steadily for a second or two. Just tapping it 
doesn't work.
Second, remember that once you've inserted a disk, the Mac won't let go unless you eject it in one of the 
official ways.
On Mac models with a CD tray, pushing the button on the CD-ROM door opens the drawer only when it's 
empty. If there's a disc in it, you can push that button till doomsday, but the Mac will simply ignore you.
That behavior especially confuses people who are used to working with Windows. (On a Windows PC, 
pushing the CD button does indeed eject the disc.) But on the Mac, pushing the CD-door button ejects an 
inserted disc only when the disc wasn't seated properly, or the Mac couldn't read the disc for some other 
reason, and the disc's icon never appeared onscreen.
The Eject key on the modern Mac keyboard, however, isn't so fussy. It pops out whatever CD or DVD is in the 
drive.
Oh—and if a CD or DVD won't come out at all (and its icon doesn't show up on the desktop), restart the Mac. 
Keep the mouse button pressed as the Mac restarts to make the disc pop out.
And if even that technique doesn't work, look for a tiny pinhole in or around the slot. Inserting a straightened 
paper clip, slowly and firmly, will also make the disc pop out.
CD into your Mac: Each contains a System folder, and each is a startup disk. Some veteran Mac fans deliberately create 
other startup disks—using CDs, for example—so that they can easily start the Mac up from a backup disk, or from a 
different version of the OS.
Only one System folder can be operational at a time. So how does the Mac know which to use as its startup disk? You

make your selection in the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences (Figure 10-2).
If you're in a hurry to start the machine up from a different disk, just click the disk icon and 
then click Restart in the System Preferences window. You don't have to close the System 
Preferences window first.
10.1.4 Erasing a Disk
Mac OS X doesn't have an Erase Disk command at the desktop. When you want to erase a disk (such as a CD-RW disc), 
therefore, you have to use Disk Utility, which
In the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences, the currently selected disk—the one that will 
be "in force" the next time the machine starts up—is always highlighted. You see the System 
folder's version and the name of the drive it's on, but not its actual name—until you point to the 
icon (without clicking).

10.1 How the Mac Does Disks
UP TO SPEED
Mac OS Extended Formatting
Whether you use Disk Utility to erase a disk (or when you first install Mac OS X and elect to erase the hard 
drive in the process), you'll be confronted with a choice between formatting options called Mac OS Extended 
and UNIX File System (UFS). (Depending on the kind of disk, you may also see an option to create a DOS-
formatted disk for use in Windows machines.)
Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) refers to the HFS Plus filing system, a disk format that 
has been proudly maximizing disk space for Mac fans since Mac OS 8.1. (For a definition of journaling, see 
Appendix A.4.)
Mac OS X still accepts disks that were prepared using the older, Mac OS Standard formatting—the ancient 
HFS (hierarchical filing system) format—but you can't use one as your startup disk, and any file names longer 
than 31 characters will appear chopped off.
As for the UNIX File System option, it's exclusively for use on computers that run Unix (the pure variety, not 
the dressed-up version that is Mac OS X).
is in your Applications
Utilities folder. This is the same program you use to erase, repair, or subdivide (partition) a hard 
drive.
Once you've opened Disk Utility, click the name of the disc (in the left-side list), click the Erase tab, and click the Erase 
button.
You won't be able to do so, though, if:
G     The disk is a standard CD-ROM, DVD, a previously recorded CD-R disc, or a disk elsewhere on the network.
G     You're trying to erase the startup disk. You can't wipe out the disk that contains the currently running System folder 
any more than you can paint the floor directly beneath your feet. (To erase your built-in hard drive, for example, you 
must start up from the Mac OS X CD-ROM.)

10.2 Burning CDs and DVDs

10.2 Burning CDs and DVDs
If your Mac has a CD-RW drive or an Apple SuperDrive in it, you've got yourself the world's most convenient and elegant 
backup system. It's just like having a floppy disk drive, really—except that a blank CD holds at least 450 times as many 
files, and a blank DVD holds about 3,250 times as many!
You can buy blank CDs very inexpensively in bulk ($20 for 100 discs, for example) via the Web. (To find the best prices, 
visit www.shopper.com or www.buy.com and search for blank CD-R.) Blank DVDs are more expensive, but not ridiculously 
so considering their capacity. At this writing, the Apple Web site, for example, sells them at $20 for five—and prices keep 
dropping.
To use one for backup, transporting files, or mailing files, insert a blank CD-R, CDRW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or (on recent 
model SuperDrive Macs) DVD+R or DVD+RW disc into your Mac. (If you have a slot-loading Mac, simply slip the disc into 
the slot. If your Mac has a sliding CD/DVD tray instead, open it first by pressing the button on the tray, or pressing your 
Eject key for about one second.
Top left: Choose Open Finder if you plan to copy regular Mac files onto the CD, or Open iTunes 
if you plan to burn a music CD using iTunes. If this is pretty much what you always want to do 
with blank CDs, turn on "Make this action the default." Then click OK. 
Right: Drag the fully "loaded" CD or DVD onto the Burn icon in the Dock, or Control-click it and 
choose Burn Disc, as shown here. 
Lower left: Confirm your choice in this box.

10.2 Burning CDs and DVDs
Once you've inserted a CD or DVD into your tray, you can close it either by pushing gently on 
the tray or—if your keyboard has an Eject key—by pressing the key again.
After a moment, the Mac notices the blank disc and displays a dialog box asking, in effect, what you want to do with this 
blank disc. See Figure 10-3 for instructions.
If you choose Open Finder, you'll see the disc's icon appear on the desktop after a moment. At this point, you can begin 
dragging files and folders onto it, exactly as though the disc were a particularly well-endowed floppy disk. You can add, 
remove, reorganize, and rename the files on it just as you would in any standard Finder window. You can even rename the 
CD or DVD itself just as you would a file or folder.
Behind the scenes, the Mac is creating a disk image of the CD- or DVD-to-be, as described 
in Section 4.10. If your hard drive is very full—too full to set aside a 650-megabyte, 700-
megabyte, or 4.3-gigabyte loading area for your files, depending on the kind of disc—you'll 
get an error message.
When the disk contains the files and folders you want to immortalize, do one of these things:
G     Choose File
Burn Disc.
G     Click the Burn button next to the disc's name in the Sidebar.
G     Drag the disc's icon toward the Trash icon on the Dock. As soon as you begin to drag, the Trash icon turns into 
what looks like a bright yellow fallout-shelter logo. Drop the disc's icon onto it.
G     Control-click the disc's icon on the Dock and choose Burn Disc from the contextual menu that appears (shown in 
Figure 10-3).
In any case, the dialog box shown at bottom left in Figure 10-3 now appears. Click Burn. The Mac's laser proceeds to 
record the CD or DVD, which can take some time. Feel free to switch into another program and continue using your Mac.
When the recording process is over, you'll have yourself a newly minted DVD or CD that you works in any other suitably 
equipped Mac (or PC, for that matter).
Here are a few final notes on burning CDs and DVDs at the desktop:
G     Not sure whether your Mac even has a CD-burning drive? Launch System Profiler (in your 
Applications
Utilities folder). Expand the Hardware triangle, and click the ATA category (or if your drive is 
external, click USB, FireWire, or SCSI). At the right side of the display, you'll see an indication of the kind of drive 
your Mac has. It might say "DVD," for example (meaning you can't record anything), or "CD-RW/DVD-R" (meaning 
you can burn CDs and DVDs—a SuperDrive).
G     You can only do the most basic recording right in the Finder—convenient as all get-out, but very basic. For 
example, you can only record an entire CD at once, instead of adding files one at a time.
G     You can, however, add more to a previously recorded CD-R or CD-RW (technically, to create a multisession disc). 
See the box in Section 10.2.

10.2 Burning CDs and DVDs
G     If you do a lot of disc burning, a full-fledged CD-burning program like Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com ) adds myriad 
additional formatting options that let you make startup CDs, video CDs, and so on.s
G     When you insert a CD-RW disc that you've previously recorded, the box shown at top left in Figure 10-3 doesn't 
appear. Instead, the disc's icon simply appears on the desktop as though it's an ordinary CD. Before you can copy 
new files onto it, you must erase it using Disk Utility as described in the previous section. 
GEM IN THE ROUGH
How to Burn a Multisession CD in Mac OS X
Most people think that you need a program like Roxio Toast to record a CD-R disc more than once in 
Mac OS X.
In fact, though, you can use humble old Disk Utility, right there your Applications
Utilities folder, to 
burn a single CD as many times as you like. That's right—regular, cheapie CD-R discs, not CD-RW 
(rewriteable).
What you'll create here is a multisession disc. Each time you burn more material onto it, you create a 
new disc icon that will appear separately when you insert the CD. Shown here at top, for example, is a 
disc that's been burned twice. A folder called PhotoRabbit was burned to the CD first. Then, a week 
later, a folder called "Flower pix" was burned onto the same disc, creating a second session (disc 
icon).
To pull off this stunt, prepare the material you intend to burn the first time. For example, put it all into a 
folder on your desktop.
Now open Disk Utility. Choose Images
New
 Image from Folder. When prompted, navigate 
to, and select, the folder you want to burn, and then click Image.
Type a name for the disk image you're creating. Specify a location (like the Desktop) and then click 
Save. In this example, suppose it's called PhotoRabbit CD.dmg.
When you're ready to burn, open Disk Utility. Click the Burn icon on the toolbar. Navigate to, and click 
once, the disk image (PhotoRabbit CD.dmg). Then click Burn.
In the resulting Burn Disc dialog box, click the blue triangle button at upperright. The dialog box 
expands, as shown here. Turn on "Leave disc appendable." Click Burn to record the material onto the 
CD.
When it comes time to add new material to that disc, repeat all of these steps so far. This time, in the 
dialog box shown above, you'll see that instead of Burn, the lower-right button now says Append. 
That's your clue that Disk Copy understands what it's about to do: add information to an existing CD, 
resulting in a second disk icon on the desktop containing only the new material.
You've just created a multisession disc!
You can repeat the process over and over again, adding more and more material to a disc until it's full.

10.2 Burning CDs and DVDs
 
 
G     The CDs that the Mac burns work equally well on Macs and Windows (or Linux) PCs. If you plan to insert a CD into 
a PC, however, remember that Windows doesn't permit any of these symbols in a Windows file name—\ / : * ? " < > 
|—and you'll run into trouble if any of your file names contain these symbols. In fact, you won't be able to open any 
folders on your CD that contain illegally named files.

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
iTunes, in your Applications folder, is the ultimate software jukebox (Figure 10-4). It can play music CDs, tune in to Internet 
radio stations, load up your iPod music player, and play back MP3 files (sound files in a popular format that stores CD-
quality music in remarkably small files) and other popular audio formats. It can also turn selected tracks from your music 
CDs into MP3 files, so that you can store favorite songs on your hard drive to play back anytime—without having to dig up 
the original CDs. If your Mac can burn CDs, iTunes lets you record your own custom audio CDs that contain only the good 
songs. Finally, of course, iTunes is the shop window for Apple's popular online iTunes Music Store ($1 a song, $10 an 
album).
iTunes can also burn MP3 CDs: music CDs that fit much more than the usual 74 or 80 minutes of music onto a disc 
(because they store songs in MP3 format instead of AIFF). Not all CD players can play MP3 discs, however, and the sound 
quality is slightly lower than standard CDs.
When the Library icon is selected in the Source list, you can click the Browse button (upper-
right) to produce a handy, supplementary view of your music database, organized like a Finder 
column view. It lets you drill down from a performer's name (left column) to an album by that 
artist (right column) to the individual songs on that album (bottom half, beneath the browser 
panes).

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
 
The first time you run iTunes, you're asked (a) whether you want iTunes to be the program your Mac uses for playing music 
files from the Internet, (b) whether you want it to ask your permission every time it connects to the Internet, and (c) whether 
you want the program to scan your Home folder for all music files already on it. (You can decline to have your hard drive 
scanned at this time. Later, you can always drag it, or any other folder, directly into the iTunes window for automatic 
scanning.)
The following pages present a mini-manual on iTunes. For the full scoop, plus coverage of 
the iPod and the iTunes Music Store, consult iPod: The Missing Manual. 
10.3.1 MP3 Files and Company
The iTunes screen itself is set up to be a list—a database—of every song you've got in MP3, AIFF, WAV, AC3, or AAC 
format. iTunes automatically finds, recognizes, and lists all such files in your Home 
folder
Music
iTunes
iTunes Music folder.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-3.html (2 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:23 AM

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
You can instruct iTunes to display the contents of other folders, too, by choosing 
File
Add to Library. It promptly copies any sound files from the folder you "show" it into 
your Home folder
Music
iTunes
 iTunes folder.
10.3.2 Audio CDs
If you're not into collecting MP3 files, you can also populate the main list here simply by inserting a music CD. The songs on 
it immediately show up in the list.
At first, they may appear with the exciting names "Track 01," "Track 02," and so on. But after a moment, iTunes attempts to 
connect to the Internet and compare your CD with the listings at www.cddb.com a global database of music CDs and their 
contents. If it finds a match among the thousands of CDs there, iTunes copies the album and song names into the program, 
where they reappear every time you use this particular music CD.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Auto-Playing Music CDs
How do I make music CDs automatically play when they're inserted into the Mac? 
First, make sure iTunes is slated to open automatically when you insert a music CD. You do that on the CDs 
& DVDs panel of System Preferences (use the "When you insert a music CD" pop-up menu).
Then all you have to do is make sure iTunes knows to begin playing automatically once it launches. Choose 
iTunes
 Preferences, click the General icon, and from the On CD Insert pop-up menu, choose Begin 
Playing, and click OK.
From now on, whenever you insert a music CD, iTunes will open automatically and begin playing.
If you connect an iTunes-compatible portable MP3 player to your Mac (the iPod isn't the only 
one), its name, too, shows up in the left-side Source list. This is your opportunity to make 
your Mac the "hub for the digital lifestyle," exactly as Apple advertises: You can add or 
remove songs on your player (by dragging them onto its icon), rename or reorder them, and 
so on.
10.3.3 The iPod
Unless you're just off the shuttle from Alpha Centauri, you probably already know that the iPod is Apple's beautiful, tiny, 
white-and-chrome music player containing a hard drive that can hold thousands of songs. It's designed to integrate 
seamlessly with iTunes.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-3.html (3 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:23 AM

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
All you have to do is connect the iPod to the Mac via its FireWire cable. You'll see the iPod's icon show up on your desktop 
as though it's a hard drive (which it is). You'll also see an iPod icon show up in the iTunes let-side source list. Click its icon 
to view its contents.
10.3.4 The iTunes Music Store
The iTunes Music Store is incredibly easy to figure out. Right from within iTunes, you can search or browse for over 
400,000 pop songs, classical pieces, and even comedy excerpts—and then buy them for $1 apiece. There are no monthly 
fees, and your downloads don't go poof! into the ether if you decide to cancel your subscription, as they do with some rival 
services.
Start by clicking the Music Store icon in the iTunes Source list. You go online and land on the home page, which looks and 
works like a Web page. Use the Search Music Store box to find the songs or performers you're interested in. Double-click a 
song to hear a 30-second excerpt. (For audio books, you get a 90-second excerpt.)
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
iPod Independence
Out of the box, the iPod and iTunes come set for automatic synchronization. That is, as soon as you hook 
them together, iTunes sends your complete music library (the contents of your Library "folder" in iTunes) to 
the iPod. The iPod's songs and playlists always match the Mac's.
Apple's idea here was to ensure that you don't use the iPod as a convenient piracy machine. Your iPod gets 
its music from your Mac, but can't put its songs onto a Mac.
At least that's the theory. But what if your hard drive selfdestructs, vaporizing the 945 MP3 files that you've 
made from your paid-for CD collection? You legally own those copies. Shouldn't you have the right to retrieve 
them from your own iPod?
If you believe that the answer is yes, a quick search at www.versiontracker.com will bring up a list of programs 
like iPod Viewer and iPod.iTunes, which let you copy music from the iPod to the Mac.
These programs know that the name of the super-secret music folder on the iPod, called iPod_Control, is 
invisible, which is why you can't see it on your desktop without the help of these utilities.
10.3.4.1 Buying music
If you decide to buy a song, you need an Apple Account; click the Account: Sign In button on the right side of the iTunes 
window to get started. (If you've ever bought or registered an Apple product on the company's Web site, signed up for 
AppleCare, bought an iPhoto hardbound book, or have a .Mac membership, you probably have an Apple Account already. 
All you have to do is remember your name—usually your email address—and password.)
When you click the Buy button next to a song's name, iTunes downloads it into your Home
Music
iTunes Music 
folder. It also shows up in the Purchased Music playlist in the Source list for convenient access.

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
10.3.4.2 Restrictions
Although some people may never even realize it, Apple Music Store downloads are copy-protected—gently. For example:
G     Maximum of three computers. Apple lets you play your Music Store-bought songs on up to three computers at 
once.
However, to prevent you from becoming a rampant music pirate, you must prove your honesty by authorizing these 
three machines.
You authorized your first machine when you signed up for an Apple Account for the iTunes store. To authorize a 
song to play on a second or third computer, copy it over from the first machine. Then, in iTunes, select the song 
and click the Play button. Type in your Apple Account user name and password in the box that appears. This 
second computer is now authorized to play that song—and any other songs you bought using the same Apple 
Account.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Playing Across the Network
If you've taken the trouble to set up a home network, you can share songs and playlists with up to five 
networked computers. You could, for example, tap into your roommates' jazz collection without getting up 
from your desk, and they can sample the zydeco and tejano tunes from your World Beat playlists. The music 
you decide to share is streamed over the network to the other computer.
You can't share music across the Internet; only within your own home or office network. Technically speaking, 
the computers must be on the same subnet (open the Network panel of System Preferences to check your 
subnet number).
To make your music available to others, choose iTunes
 Preferences, click the Sharing icon, and turn on 
"Share my music." When they click OK, they'll find your iTunes collection listed in the Source pane, ready to 
play.
Unfortunately, you can't listen to a song from the iTunes Music Store across the network until you enter the 
Apple account name and user password that was used to purchase the song. Your Mac now takes one of the 
three spots on the song's authorized list. If you don't type in the owner's name and password for purchased 
songs, iTunes will just skip those tracks.
Thinking of putting that older computer up for sale? Before you wipe the drive clean and send 
it on its way, be sure to deauthorize it (choose Advance
Deauthorize Computer), so that 
you're not wasting one of your "you can play your Music Store purchases on up to three 
computers" slots. Erasing a hard drive, by itself, does not deauthorize a computer.

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
G     Maximum of ten CDs per playlist. You can also burn purchased tracks to blank CDs, so you can listen to them in 
the car or on the big stereo rack in the living room. Here, Apple has inserted a tiny, almost irrelevant form of copy 
protection: If you've added store-bought songs to a given playlist, you can't burn more than ten CD copies of it in a 
row without making at least one change to that list. Changing the song order slightly will do.
10.3.5 Playing Music
To turn your Mac into a music player, click iTunes' triangular Play button (or press the Space bar). The Mac immediately 
begins to play the songs whose names have checkmarks in the main list (Figure 10-4).
The central display of the top of the window shows not only the name of the song and album, 
but also where you are in the song, as represented by the diamond in the horizontal strip. 
Drag this diamond, or click elsewhere in the strip, to jump around in the song.
To view the current music's sound levels, just click the tiny triangle at the left side of this 
display to see a pulsing VU meter, indicating the various frequencies.
10.3.6 Playing with Playback
As music plays, you can control and manipulate the music and the visuals of your Mac in all kinds of interesting ways. As a 
result, some people don't move from their Macs for months at a time.
10.3.6.1 Turning on visuals
Visuals is the iTunes term for an onscreen light show that pulses, beats, and dances in perfect sync to the music you're 
listening to. The effect is hypnotic and wild. (For real party fun, invite some people who grew up in the Sixties to your house 
to watch.)
To summon this psychedelic display, click the flower-power icon in the lower-right corner of the window (see Figure 10-4). 
The show begins immediately—although it's much more fun if you choose Visuals
Full Screen so that the movie takes 
over your whole monitor. True, you won't get a lot of work done, but when it comes to stress relief, visuals are a lot cheaper 
than a hot tub.
Once the screen is alive with visuals, you can turn it into your personal biofeedback screen by experimenting with these 
keys:
Key 
Function 
?
Displays a cheat sheet of secret keystrokes. (Press it repeatedly to see the other shortcut keys.)
F

T
Turns frame rate capping on or off—a feature that limits the frame rate to 30 frames per second, to

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
You can also control CD playback from the Dock. Just Control-click the iTunes icon (or click 
and hold on it) to produce a pop-up menu offering playback commands like Pause, Next 
Song, and Previous Song, along with a display that identifies the song currently being played.
10.3.6.3 Playing with the graphic equalizer
If you click the Graphic Equalizer button (identified in Figure 10-4), you get a handsome control console that lets you adjust 
the strength of each musical frequency independently (see Figure 10-5).
Drag the sliders (bass on the left, treble on the right) to accommodate the strengths and 
weaknesses of your speakers or headphones (and listening tastes). Or save yourself the trouble
—use the pop-up menu above the sliders to choose a canned set of slider positions for 
Classical, Dance, Jazz, Latin, and so on. These settings even transfer to the iPod.
 
10.3.6.4 Preventing ear-blast syndrome
Here's a clever touch: In the iTunes
Preferences dialog box, if you click the Effects icon, you see a new checkbox 
called Sound Check. Its function is to keep the playback volume of all songs within the same basic level, so that you don't 
have to adjust the volume to compensate for different recorded levels. (This setting, too, gets transferred to your iPod.)
10.3.7 Copying (Ripping) CD Songs to Your Hard Drive
iTunes lets you convert your favorite songs from audio CDs into files on your hard drive. Once they've been transferred to 
your Mac, you can play them whenever you like, without even needing the original CD.
To rip a CD (as aficionados would say), make sure that only the songs you want to capture have checkmarks in the main 
list. (The bottom of the window shows you how many songs are on the CD, their total playback time, and how many 
megabytes of disk space it would take to copy them to your hard drive.) Choose a format for the files you're about to create 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-3.html (9 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:23 AM

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
using the pop-up menu on the iTunes
Preferences
 Importing tab. Then click the Import button at the upper-right 
corner of the window (see Figure 10-6).
Watch the display at the top of the window to see how long the conversion is going to take, and 
which song iTunes is working on. As iTunes finishes processing each song, you see a small, 
circled checkmark next to its name in the main list to remind you that you've got it on board 
and no longer need the CD in your machine.
 
When it's all over, you'll find the imported songs listed in your Library (click the Library icon in the left-side Source list). From 
there, you can drag them into any other folder (playlist), as described next.
10.3.8 Playlists and Smart Playlists
When you click the Library icon in the left-side Source list, the main part of the screen displays every music file iTunes 
knows about (and even QuickTime movie files; iTunes will play back just the soundtrack). It's organized much like a Finder 
window, with columns indicating the song length, singer or band, album, and so on. As always, you can rearrange these 
columns by dragging their headings, sort your list by one of these criteria by clicking its heading, reverse the sorting order 
by clicking the heading a second time, and so on. And here's the best part: To find a particular song, just type a few letters 
into the Search blank above the list. iTunes hides all but the ones that match.
Apple recognizes that you may not want to listen to all your songs every time you need some tunes. That's why iTunes lets 
you create playlists—folders in the Source list that contain only certain songs. In effect, you can devise your own albums, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-3.html (10 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:23 AM

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
like one called Party Tunes, another called Blind Date Music, and so on.
10.3.8.1 Creating playlists
To create a new playlist, click the New Playlist button in the lower-left corner of the window, or choose File
New Playlist 
(
-N). Alternatively, if you've already highlighted certain songs—by 
-clicking them or Shift-clicking them—you can 
choose File
New Playlist From Selection.
A new playlist appears as an icon in the list at the left side of the screen. You can rename one by double-clicking it, and add 
songs to one by dragging them out of the main list.
Deleting a song from a playlist doesn't delete it from the Library (or your hard drive). 
Similarly, it's fine to add the same song to as many different playlists as you like, since you're 
not actually increasing the size of your Library. (You might be starting to pick up a running 
theme in Apple's software. Playlists work just like albums in iPhoto, or the Sidebar in the 
Finder.)
10.3.8.2 Playing with criteria
Smart Playlists constantly rebuild themselves according to criteria you specify. You might tell one Smart Playlist to 
assemble 45 minutes' worth of songs that you've rated higher than four stars but rarely listen to, and another to list your 
most-often-played songs from the Eighties.
iTunes automatically tracks how many times you've played each song, the band name, and 
other criteria. The rating is one Smart Playlist criterion you have to input yourself.
To rate a song, make the window wide enough that you can see the My Rating column. Then 
just click in the My Rating column for a selected song. The appropriate number of stars 
appears—one, two, three, four, or five—depending on the position of your click. You can 
change a song's rating as many times as you like—a good thing, considering the short shelf 
life of a pop hit these days.
The Smart Playlist dialog box is really a powerful search command (because iTunes is really a 
powerful database). You can set up certain criteria, like the hunt for particular Beatles tunes 
illustrated here. Then, provided the "Live updating" checkbox is turned on, iTunes will always 
keep this playlist updated as your collection changes, as you change your ratings, as your Play 
Count changes, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-10-SECT-3.html (11 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:23 AM

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
 
To make a smart playlist, choose File
New Smart Playlist (Option-
-N)—or just Option-click the New Playlist button 
beneath the source list. The dialog box shown in Figure 10-7 appears. The controls here are designed to set up a search of 
your music database. Figure 10-7, for example, illustrates how you'd find up to 74 Beatles tunes released between 1965 
and 1968—that you've rated three stars or higher and that you've listened to exactly twice.s
When you click OK, your Smart Playlist is ready to show off. When you click its name in the Source list, the main song list 
updates itself according to your criteria and any changes in your music collection. (Smart Playlists get transferred to your 
iPod, but don't continue to update themselves there.)
10.3.9 iTunes: Burning Music CDs
If your Mac can burn CDs, Mac OS X can serve as your own private record label. iTunes can record selected sets of songs, 
no matter what the original sources, onto a blank CD. When it's all over, you can play the burned CD on almost any 
standard CD player, just as you would a CD from Tower Records—but this time, you hear only the songs you like, in the 
order you like, with all of the annoying ones eliminated.
Use CD-R discs. CD-RW discs are not only more expensive, but may not work in standard 
CD players. (Not all players recognize CD-R discs either, but the odds are better.)

10.3 iTunes: The Digital Jukebox
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Internet Radio
Audio CDs and MP3 files aren't the only sources of musical and spoken sound you can listen to as you work. 
iTunes also lets you tune in to hundreds of Internet-based radio stations, which may turn out to be the most 
convenient music source of all. They're free, they play 24 hours a day, and their music collections make yours 
look like a drop in the bucket.
Click Radio in the left-side Source list. In the main list, if you're connected to the Internet, you'll see categories 
like Blues, Classic Rock, Classical, and so on, as shown here. Click the flippy triangle to see a list of Internet 
radio stations in that category.
When you see one that looks interesting, double-click it. (The higher the number in the Bit Rate column, the 
better the sound quality. Note, though, that 128 Kbps is generally too rich for dial-up modems, and may 
sputter or fail to connect.) Wait a moment for your Mac to connect to the appropriate Internet site, and then let 
the music begin!
Unfortunately, there's no easy way to capture Internet broadcasts or save them onto your hard drive. You can, 
however, drag the name of one into the Source list, or your Library, or even a playlist, to make it easier to 
access later on.
If you discover other Internet radio stations that sound interesting, choose Advanced
 Open Stream, type 
in the station's Web address (URL), and press Return.
 
Start by creating a playlist for the CD you're about to make. Click its icon in the leftside Source list to see the list you've

built. Take a moment to drag them up or down in the list to reflect their playback order. Keep these points in mind:
G     Keep an eye on the readout at the bottom of the list, which tells you how much time the songs will take.
G     About 74 or 80 minutes of AIFF audio files fit on one CD. But if you make an MP3 CD instead (choose 
iTunes
Preferences
Burning tab, choose MP3 CD as the format), you can hold at least ten times as much. 
Note, though, that MP3 CDs don't play on all CD players—only those advertised with this feature.
G     You can control how many seconds of silence iTunes leaves between tracks on your custom CD. Choose 
iTunes
Preferences, click the Burning icon, and make a selection from the Gap Between Songs pop-up menu. 
This is also where you specify whether you want to make a standard audio CD or a CD in the newer, less 
compatible MP3 CD format (which holds much more music per disc).
When everything is set up, click the Burn CD button in the playlist window. Insert a blank CD into the Mac and then click 
Burn CD again.
The burning process takes some time. Feel free to work in other programs while iTunes chugs away.

10.4 DVD Movies
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
10.4 DVD Movies
If your Mac has a DVD drive (or a combo DVD/CD-RW drive or SuperDrive), you're in for a treat. Your Mac can play rented 
or purchased movies on DVD as though it was born to do so.
Watching movies on your Mac screen couldn't be simpler: Just insert the DVD. The Mac automatically detects that it's a 
video DVD—as opposed to, say, one that's just filled with files—and launches the DVD Player program (Figure 10-8).
NOTE
DVD Player doesn't work (and doesn't even get installed) on certain older Macs, including the "Wall Street" 
PowerBook laptops and early blue-and-white Power Macs.
If DVD Player doesn't start up automatically when you insert a DVD movie, you can open it yourself. It's sitting there in your 
Applications folder. (Then fix the problem, using the CDs & DVDs panel of System Preferences.)
10.4.1 Playing a Movie
If DVD Player starts out playing your movie in a window, your first act should be to choose Video
Enter Full Screen 
(
-0). At this point, the movie screen fills your entire monitor—even the menu bar disappears. (To make it reappear, move 
your cursor near the top of the screen.)
At this point, you're ready to play the movie. By far the easiest way is to just press the Space bar—once to start, again to 
pause, again to start again.
You can also use the "remote control," which is deconstructed in Figure 10-8. Or just use the keyboard:
G     Press Shift-
-right arrow to fast-forward; press that combination repeatedly to cycle from twice to 4, 8, or 16 
times normal speed. Similarly, press Shift-
-left arrow to scan backwards. Click Play (or press the Space bar) to 
resume normal playback. 
Top: DVDs on your screen!
Bottom: You can orient this controller either horizontally or vertically on your screen by 
choosing Controls
Use Vertical Controller. You can also do without this remote control 
altogether, since all of its buttons have keyboard equivalents.

10.4.2 Language Fun
Most Hollywood DVDs have been programmed with onscreen subtitles to help those with hearing impairments and people 
sitting in noisy bars. Click the Subtitle button (Figure 10-8) to turn on the subtitles, again to hide them. (You can specify the 
language you want—English subtitles, Spanish subtitles, or whatever the DVD offers—by clicking the same button

repeatedly. Or choose DVD Player
Preferences, click the Disc Setup tab, and choose a language from the Subtitle pop-
up menu.)
Meanwhile, each time you click the Audio button on the remote, the movie's soundtrack switches to a different language (if, 
in fact, alternate soundtrack languages have been provided). You'll see the name of each language appear briefly in the 
remote's display. (You can also use the Audio button as a pop-up menu to choose the language you want directly.)
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Region Changing
The first time I tried to play a DVD, I got this weird message about initializing the region code. What's up with 
that? 
Hollywood generally releases its movies in each part of the world at different times. A movie may come out on 
video in the U.S. when it's just hitting screens in Europe. We certainly can't have people watching a DVD 
before the movie studio says it's OK! That's why many discs are region-locked, so that they play back only on 
players in certain geographical regions of the world.
As a DVD player in disguise, your Mac is just doing its duty. You can change its region (you'll be offered the 
chance to do so when you insert a region-locked DVD from another region), but only five times—and then it's 
frozen forever in the fifth version, or at least until you erase your hard drive and start over.
The dialog box shows you which region your DVD is designed for: 1 for the U.S. and Canada; 2 for Japan, 
Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East; 3 for Southeast and East Asia; 4 for Australia, New Zealand, 
Pacific Islands, Central America, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean; 5 for Eastern Europe, Africa, 
and North Korea; 6 for China; and 8 for airplanes, cruise ships, and so on.
(There is no Region 7. Maybe it's reserved for the empty spot in movie executives' hearts.)
For real fun, turn on English subtitles but switch the soundtrack to a foreign language. No 
matter how trashy the movie you're watching, you'll gain much more respect from your 
friends and family when you tell them that you're watching a foreign film.
10.4.3 The Big Picture
Now, watching a movie while sitting in front of your iMac or Power Mac is not exactly the great American movie-watching 
dream. But if your Mac has an S-video jack (many PowerBook and iBook models do), you can connect the Mac to your TV 
for a much more comfortable movie-watching experience.
Just be sure to connect the cable directly to the TV. If you connect them to your VCR instead, you'll probably get a horrible, 
murky, color-shifting picture—the result of the built-in copy-protection circuitry of every VCR.

Chapter 11. Security and Accounts
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Chapter 11. Security and Accounts
In an era when security is the hot high-tech buzzword, Apple was smart to make security a focal point for the Panther 
upgrade. In an already virus-free operating system, it's only icing on the cake that, for example, you can now opt to have 
your Home folder protected with something called AES-128 encryption. (How secure is that? It would take a password-
guessing computer 149 trillion years before hitting paydirt. Or, in more human terms, slightly longer than two back-to-back 
Kevin Costner movies.)
The concept of user accounts is central to Panther's security approach. Like the Unix under its skin (and also like Windows 
XP and Windows 2000), Mac OS X is designed from the ground up to be a multiple-user operating system. You can 
configure a Mac OS X machine so that everyone must log in—that is, you have to click or type your name and type in a 
password—when the computer turns on. And upon doing so, you discover the Macintosh universe just as you left it, 
including these elements:
G     Your documents, files, and folders.
G     Your preference settings in just about every program you use: Web browser bookmarks and preferred home page; 
desktop picture, screen saver, and language; icons on the desktop and in the Dock—and the size and position of 
the Dock itself; and so on.
G     Your email account(s), including personal information and mailboxes.
G     Your personally installed programs and fonts.
G     Your choice of programs that launch automatically at startup.
This system means that several different people can use it throughout the day, without disrupting each other's files and 
settings. It also protects the Mac from getting fouled up by mischievous (or bumbling) students, employees, and hackers.
If you're the only person who uses your Mac, you can safely skip most of this chapter. The Mac will never ask for the name 
and password you made up when you installed Mac OS X (at least not at startup time), because Apple's installer 
automatically turns on something called automatic login (Section 11.4.1). You will be using one of these accounts, though, 
whether you realize it or not.
Furthermore, when you're stuck in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles, you may find the concepts presented here 
worth skimming, as certain elements of this multiple-user system may intrude upon your solo activities—and the 
discussions in this book—from time to time.
Even if you don't share your Mac with anyone and don't create any other accounts, you might 
still be tempted to learn about the accounts feature because of its ability to password-protect 
the entire computer. All you have to do is to turn off the automatic login feature described in 
Section 11.4.1. Thereafter, your Mac is protected from unauthorized fiddling when you're 
away from your desk or when your laptop is stolen.

11.1 Introducing Accounts
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.1 Introducing Accounts
When you first installed Mac OS X, whether it was 10.3 or an earlier version (see Appendix A), you were asked for a name 
and password. You may not have realized it at the time, but you were creating the first user account on your Macintosh. 
Since that fateful day, you may have made a number of changes to your desktop—adjusted the Dock settings, set up your 
folders and desktop the way you like them, added some favorites to your Web browser, and so on—without realizing that 
you were actually making these changes only to your account. 
When you set up several accounts, you don't turn on the Mac so much as sign into it. A 
command in the 
 menu called Log Out summons this sign-in screen, as does the new 
Accounts menu described later in this chapter. Click your own name, and type your password 
(if any), to move past this box and into your own stuff.
 
As noted in Chapter 2, you've probably been saving your documents into your own Home folder, which is the cornerstone of 
your own account. This folder, generally named after you and stashed in the Users folder on your hard drive, stores not only 
your own work, but also your preference settings for all the programs you use, special fonts that you've installed, programs 
you've installed for your own use, and so on.
Now then: If you create an account for a second person, when she turns on the computer and signs in, she'll find the 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-1.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:01:33 AM

11.1 Introducing Accounts
desktop exactly the way it was factory-installed by Apple—blue swirling desktop picture, Dock along the bottom, the default 
Web browser home page, and so on. She can make the same kinds of changes to the Mac that you've made, but nothing 
she does will affect your environment the next time you log in. You'll still find the Mac desktop the way you left it—your 
desktop picture fills the screen, the Web browser lists your bookmarks, the Dock lists your favorite documents, and so on.
In other words, the multiple-accounts feature has two components: first, a convenience element that hides everyone else's 
junk; and second, a security element that protects both the Mac's system software and everybody's work.

11.2 Administrator vs. Standard Accounts
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.2 Administrator vs. Standard Accounts
If you like the idea of this multiple-accounts business, begin by opening System Preferences (Chapter 8). In the System 
Preferences window, click Accounts.
The screen lists everyone for whom you've created an account. From here, you can create new 
accounts or change passwords. Notice the padlock icon at the bottom. Whenever you see it, 
you're looking at settings that only administrators are allowed to change—after clicking the 
padlock and identifying themselves by password, that is.
 
The screen shown in Figure 11-2 appears, revealing the list of everyone who has an account. If you're new at this, there's 
probably just one account listed here—yours. This is the account that Mac OS X created when you first installed it.
11.2.1 Administrator Accounts
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-2.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:01:36 AM

11.2 Administrator vs. Standard Accounts
It's important to understand the phrase you see just beneath your name. On your own personal Mac, it probably says 
Admin. This, as you could probably guess, stands for Administrator.
Because you're the person who installed Mac OS X to begin with, the Mac assumes that you are its administrator—the 
technical wizard who's in charge of it. You're the teacher, the parent, the resident guru. You're the one who will maintain 
this Mac. Only an administrator is allowed to:
G     Install new programs into the Applications folder.
G     Add fonts (to the Library folder) that everybody can use.
G     Make changes to certain System Preferences panels (including Network, Date & Time, Energy Saver, and Startup 
Disk).
G     Use NetInfo Manager and some features of the Disk Utility program.
G     Create, move, or delete folders outside of your Home folder.
G     Decide who gets to have accounts on the Mac.
G     Open, change, or delete anyone else's files (Section 12.2.10).
G     Bypass FileVault using a master password (Section 11.3.3).
Mastering the notion of administrators may be new to you, but it's an important pill to swallow. For one thing, you'll find 
certain settings all over Mac OS X that you can change only if you're an administrator—including many in the Accounts 
panel itself (see Figure 11-2). For another thing, whether or not you're an administrator plays an enormous role when 
networking your Mac to other kinds of computers, as described in the next chapter. And finally, in the bigger picture, the fact 
that the Mac has an industrial-strength accounts system, just like traditional Unix and Windows 2000 operating systems, 
gives it a fighting chance in the corporations of America.
As you create accounts for other people who'll use this Mac, you'll be offered the opportunity to make each one an 
administrator just like you. Needless to say, use discretion. Bestow these powers only upon people as responsible and 
technically masterful as you.
11.2.2 Standard Accounts
Anyone who isn't an administrator will probably just be an ordinary, everyday Standard account holder ( Figure 11-2). (In 
earlier Mac OS X versions, Apple had no name for this kind of account; they were just "not administrators.")
These people have everyday access to their own Home folders and to some of the System Preferences, but most other 
areas of the Mac are off-limits. Mac OS X won't even let them create new folders on the main hard drive, except inside their 
own Home folders (or in the Shared folder described later).
A few of the System Preferences panels contain a padlock icon like the one in Figure 11-2. If you're a Standard account 
holder, you can't make changes to these settings without the assistance of an administrator. (Fortunately, you aren't 
required to log out so that an administrator can log in and make changes. You can just call the administrator over, click the 
padlock icon, and let him type in his name and password—if, indeed, he feels comfortable with you making the changes 
you're about to make.)

11.3 Creating an Account
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.3 Creating an Account
To create a new account, click the + button beneath the list of accounts. The controls shown in Figure 11-2 appear.
Mac OS X offers a long list of options for each account, as described in the following pages. None of it is difficult; some of it, 
in fact, is kind of fun.
11.3.1 Phase 1: Name the Account
On the first tab of the dialog box, called Password, you fill in certain information about the new account holder.
G     Name. If it's just the family, this could be Chris or Robin. If it's a corporation or school, you'll probably want to use 
both first and last names.
G     Short Name. Particularly if your name is, say, Alexandra Stephanopoulos, you'll quickly discover the value of 
having a short name—an abbreviation of your actual name. When you sign into your Mac in person, you can use 
either your long or short name. But when you access this Mac by dialing into it or connecting from across the 
network (as described in the next chapter), the short variation is all you need.
As soon as you tab into this field, the Mac proposes a short name for you. You can replace the suggestion with 
whatever you like. (Technically, it doesn't even have to be shorter than the "long" name.)
G     Password, Verify. Here's where you're supposed to type this new account holder's password (Figure 11-2). In fact, 
you're supposed to type it twice, to make sure you didn't introduce a typo the first time. The Mac displays only dots 
as you type, to guard against the possibility that somebody is watching over your shoulder.
The usual computer book takes this opportunity to stress the importance of a long, complex password—something 
made up of mixed letters and numbers or anything that isn't in the dictionary. This is excellent advice if you create 
sensitive documents and work in a big corporation.
But if you share the Mac only with a spouse or a few trusted colleagues in a small office, for example, you may 
have nothing to hide. You may see the multiple-users feature more as a convenience (keeping your settings and 
files separate) than a protector of secrecy and security. In these situations, there's no particular urgency to the 
mission of thwarting the world's hackers with a convoluted password.
In fact, you may want to consider setting up no password—leaving both password blanks empty. Later, whenever 
you're asked for your password, just leave the Password box blank. You'll be able to log in that much faster each 
day.
G     Password Hint. If you gave yourself a password, you can leave yourself a hint in this box. If your password is the 
middle name of the first person who ever kissed you, for example, your hint might be "middle name of the first 
person who ever kissed me."
Later, if you ever forget your password, the Mac will display this cue to jog your memory.
11.3.2 Phase 2: Choose a Picture
The usual Mac OS X sign-in screen (Figure 11-1) displays each account holder's name, accompanied by a little picture.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (1 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
Once you've selected a photo to represent yourself (left), you can adjust its position relative to 
the square "frame" (right), or adjust its size by dragging the slider. Finally, when the picture 
looks correctly framed, click Set. (The next time you return to the Images dialog box, you'll be 
able to recall the new image using the Recent Images pop-up menu.)
 
On the Picture tab, you can choose a little graphic for yourself. It will become not only your icon on the sign-in screen, but 
also your "card" photo in Mac OS X's Address Book program and your icon in iChat.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (2 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
If you like the selections that Apple has provided at the right side of the window (drag the scroll bar to see them all), just 
click one to select it. If you'd rather supply your own graphics file—a digital photo of your own head, for example—follow 
one of these paths:
G     Drag the graphics file directly into the "picture well" (Figure 11-3). Use the resulting Images window to frame your 
picture.
G     Click the Edit button. In the Images dialog box that appears, click Choose. You're shown a list of what's on your 
hard drive so that you can double-click it.
G     If you have an iSight camera (or a digital camcorder) hooked up to your FireWire jack, click Edit. Use the resulting 
Images window to frame yourself, and then click the Take Video Snapshot button.
11.3.3 Phase 3: Security—and FileVault
The Security tab, new in Panther, is the heart of Mac OS X's account security system (Figure 11-4).
The most important item here is the checkbox called "Allow user to administer this computer." This is the big one: the 
master switch that turns this ordinary, unsuspecting computer user into an administrator, as described previously.
The second most important item here is FileVault, one of Panther's most often-cited new features. Understanding what it 
does may take a little slogging.
As noted earlier, the Mac OS X accounts system is designed to keep people out of each other's stuff. Ordinarily, for 
example, Chris isn't allowed to go rooting through Robin's stuff.
Until Mac OS X 10.3, though, there were all kinds of ways to circumvent this protection system. A sneak or showoff could 
start up your Mac in Mac OS 9, which knows nothing about Mac OS X permissions, or start up the Mac in FireWire disk 
mode (Section 6.2) using a different copy of Mac OS X, or even remove the hard drive and hook it up to a Mac OS 9 
machine. In each case, they'd then be able to run rampant through everybody's files, changing or trashing them with 
abandon. For people with sensitive or private files, the result was a security hole bigger than Steve Jobs' bank account.
FileVault is an extra line of defense. When you turn on this feature, your Mac automatically encrypts (scrambles) everything 
in your Home folder, using the abovementioned, ridiculously secure AES protocol. This means that unless someone knows 
(or can figure out) your password, FileVault renders your files unreadable for anyone but you and your computer's 
administrator—no matter what sneaky tricks they try to pull.
You won't notice much difference when FileVault is turned on. You log in as usual, clicking your name and typing your 
password. Only a slight pause indicates that Mac OS X is decoding your entire Home folder.
This feature is especially useful for laptop owners. If someone swipes or "borrows" your 
PowerBook or iBook, they won't be able to access your stuff without the password.
Here are some things you should know about FileVault's protection:
G     It's useful only if you've logged out. Once you're logged in, your files are not encrypted. If you want the 
protection, log out before you wander away from the Mac. (Or let the screen saver close your account for you; see 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (3 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
Section 11.4.2).
G     It only covers your Home folder. Anything in your Applications, System, or Library folders is exempt from 
protection.
If you've got programs you don't want anyone else to see, store them in your Home folder 
and put aliases of them in your Applications folder. That way, you get the security of FileVault 
and the convenience of your Applications folder.
G     An administrator can access your files, too. According to Mac OS X's caste system, anyone with an 
administrator's account can have virtually unhindered access to his peasants' files—even with FileVault on—
because the administrator has the master password described below.
G     It doesn't let you access your files from anything other than Mac OS X. In exchange for protection against 
evildoers, Mac OS X doesn't let you get to the stuff in your Home folder when the Mac starts up in Mac OS 9, or 
when you access it via FireWire disk mode. (That, after all, is the whole point.)
G     It keeps other people from opening your files, not from deleting them. It's still possible for someone to trash all 
your files, without ever seeing what they are. There's not much you can do about this with FileVault on or off.
G     Any shared folders in your Home folder will no longer be available on the network. That is, any folders you've 
shared won't be available to your co-workers except when you're at your Mac and logged in.
G     Backup programs may throw a tizzy. FileVault's job is to "stuff " and "unstuff " your Home folder as you log in 
and out. Backup programs that work by backing up files and folders that have changed since the last backup may 
therefore get very confused.
G     It's only as secure as your password. If someone can figure out your account's password, they can bypass 
FileVault for your account. Even more seriously, if someone can figure out the master password (see below), they 
can bypass FileVault for every account on your computer.
G     If you forget your password and your administrator forgets the master password, you're toast. If this 
happens, your data is permanently lost. You'll have no choice but to erase your hard drive and start from scratch.
To turn FileVault on, proceed like this:
1.  In the Accounts panel of System Preferences, click the Security tab. 
Actually, you can find the same controls in the Security panel of System Preferences.
2.  Click Set Master Password. 
If you're the first person to turn on FileVault, you'll need to create a master password first.
The master password is an override password that gives an administrator full power to access any account (even 
without knowing the account holder's password) or to turn off FileVault for any account.
The thinking goes like this: Yeah, yeah, the peons with Standard accounts forget their account passwords all the 
time. But with FileVault, a forgotten password would mean the entire Home folder is locked forever —so Apple 
gave you, the technically savvy administrator, a back door. (And you, the omniscient Administrator, would never 
forget the master password—right?)

11.3 Creating an Account
Bottom: Type in your master password twice, and give yourself a hint. (In the event of an 
emergency, the hint will appear after the third unsuccessful attempt to type in the master 
password.) When you click OK, you'll see that the Security dialog box now says, "A 
master password is set for this computer."
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (5 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
When you click Set Master Password, the dialog box shown in Figure 11-4 appears.
3.  Click Turn On FileVault. 
Some time passes as Mac OS X tries to figure out whether or not you have enough free disk space to encrypt your 
Home folder. (Remember, it's essentially going to duplicate and encode everything in your Home folder-all of your 
photos, movies, and so on. It will then delete the originals.) If you don't have enough space (20 GB, 30 GB, or more 
may be necessary), you'll get only an error message.
If you do have enough space, an explanatory dialog box appears.
4.  Click Turn on FileVault in the dialog box. 
Now Mac OS X logs you out of your own account. (It can't very well encrypt a folder that's in use.) Some time will 
pass while it converts your Home folder into a protected state, during which you can't do anything but wait.
After a few minutes, you arrive at the standard login window, where you can see that your account picture is now 
adorned by the FileVault logo. Sign in as usual, confident that your stuff is securely locked away from anyone who 
tries to get at it when you're not logged in.
NOTE
To turn off FileVault, open System Preferences, click Security, and click Turn Off FileVault. Enter your 
password and click OK. (The master password sticks around once you've created it, however, in case you 
ever want to turn FileVault on again.)
UP TO SPEED
Password Hell
With the introduction of the master password in Mac OS X 10.3, you now have quite a few different passwords 
to keep straight. Each one, however, has a specific purpose:
Account password. You type this password in at the normal login screen. You can't get into anyone else's 
account with it—only yours. Entering this password unlocks FileVault, too.
Administrator password. You're asked to enter this password whenever you try to install new software or 
modify certain system settings. If you're the only one who uses your computer (or you're the one who controls 
it), your administrator password is your account password. Otherwise, you're supposed to ask an 
administrator to type in his name and password once he's assessed what you're trying to do.
Master password. You can think of this password as a master key: If anyone with FileVault forgets her 
account password, the administrator who knows the master password can unlock the account. The master 
password also lets an administrator change an account's password right at the sign-in screen, whether 
FileVault is turned on or not.
Root password. This password is rarely useful for anything other than Unix hackery (Chapter 16).

11.3 Creating an Account
11.3.4 Phase 4: Build the Rubber Room
If you're setting up a Standard account, the Limitations tab affords you the opportunity to shield your Mac—or its very 
young, very fearful, or very mischievous operator—from confusion and harm. This is a great feature to remember when 
you're setting up accounts for students, young children, or easily intimidated adults.
Here, you see three buttons: No Limits, Some Limits, and Simple Finder.
11.3.4.1 No Limits
This setting, of course, means that this account holder is allowed do just about anything on the Mac that a Standard 
account holder is allowed to do: open any program, change settings, burn any kind of disc, and so on. Only administrative 
duties are off limits (installing programs into the Applications folder, adding and deleting accounts, and so on).
From the Limitations window, you can control the capabilities of any user of your system. In the 
lower half of the Some Limits or Simple Finder panes, you can choose applications by turning 
on the boxes next to their names. (Expand the flippy triangles if necessary.) Those are the only 
programs these account holders will be allowed to use.

11.3 Creating an Account
 
11.3.4.2 Some Limits
By tinkering with the checkboxes here, you can declare certain programs off-limits to this account holder, or turn off his 
ability to remove Dock icons, burn CDs, and so on.
In fact, you can restrict this person's access to the Mac in several different ways:
G     Limit the programs. At the bottom of the dialog box shown in Figure 11-5, you see a list of all the programs in your 
Applications folder (an interesting read in its own right). If you turn on "This user can use only these applications," 
you can then turn the programs' checkboxes on or off. Only checked items will show up in the account holder's 
Applications folder.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (8 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
If you don't see a program listed, click the Locate button and find it, or drag its icon 
from the Finder into the window. You'll have to do that when, for example, a program, 
like Adobe Photoshop, is inside a folder in the Applications folder, rather than sitting 
loose as a solo icon there.
If you're setting up an account for use in the classroom, say, you may well want to turn off access to programs like 
Disk Utility, iChat, and Tomb Raider.
G     Limit the features. When you first create a Standard account, all of the checkboxes above the list of programs are 
turned on. That is, Standard account holders are free to burn CDs or DVDs, change what's on the Dock, change 
their passwords, and view the settings of all System Preferences panels (although they can't necessarily change all 
of these settings).
Depending on your situation, you may find it useful to turn off some of these options. In a school lab, for example, 
you might want to turn off the ability to burn discs (to block software piracy). If you're setting up a Mac for a 
technophobe, you might want to turn off the ability to change the Dock (so your colleague won't accidentally lose 
access to his own programs and work).
11.3.4.3 Simple Finder
If you're really concerned about somebody's ability to survive the Mac—or the Mac's ability to survive them—then click the 
Simple Finder button (shown at top in Figure 11-5). Also turn on the checkboxes of the programs that person is allowed to 
use.
Now suppose you're the lucky Mac fan who's been given a Simple Finder account. When you log in, you'll discover the 
barren world shown in Figure 11-6. There are only three menus (
, Finder, and File), a single onscreen window, no hard 
drive icon, and a bare-bones Dock. The only folders you can see are in the Dock. They include:
G     My Applications. These are aliases of the applications the administrator approved. They appear on strange, fixed, 
icon view "pages" (list and column views don't exist). You can't move these icons, delete them, or rename them. If 
you have too many to fit on one screen, you get numbered page buttons beneath them, which you can click to 
move from one set to another.
G     Documents. Behind the scenes, this is your Home
Documents folder. Of course, as a Simple Finder kind of 
soul, you don't have a visible Home folder. All your stuff goes in here.
G     Shared. This is the same Shared folder described in Section 11.5.2. It's provided so that you and other account 
holders can exchange documents. However, you can't open any of the folders here, only the documents.
G     Trash. The Trash is here, but you won't use it much. Selecting or dragging any icon is against the rules, so you're 
left with no obvious means of putting anything into your Trash.
Truth is, you can put something into the Trash by Control-clicking it and choosing Move to Trash from the 
contextual menu. But as you'll be told, the item "will be deleted immediately." In Simple Finder, there's no mercy for 
files you've slated for execution.
The Simple Finder doesn't feel like home-unless you've got one of those Spartan, space-
age, Dr. Evil-style pads. But it can be just the ticket for less skilled Mac users, with few 
options and a basic oneclick interface. Every program in your My Applications folder is 
actually only an alias to the real program, which is safely ensconced in the off-limits 
Applications folder.

11.3 Creating an Account
 
Otherwise, you can essentially forget everything else you've read in this book. You can't create folders, move icons, or do 
much of anything beyond clicking the icons that your benevolent administrator has provided. It's as though Mac OS X 
moved away and left you the empty house.
G     If you click a folder, it opens—but only if something's actually inside; if it's empty, nothing happens at all. To keep 
things extra-simple, Mac OS X permits only one window at a time to be open. It's easy to open icons, too, because 
one click opens it, not two.
G     The File menu is stunted, offering only a Close Window command. The Finder menu only gives you two options: 
About Finder and Run Full Finder. (The latter command prompts you for an administrator's user name and 
password, and then turns back into the regular Finder—a handy escape hatch. To return to Simple Finder, just 
choose Finder
Return to Simple Finder.)
G     The 
 menu is really bare-bones: You can Log Out, Force Quit, or go to Sleep. That's it.
Although the Simple Finder is simple, any program (at least, any that you, the administrator, have permitted) can run from it. 
A program running inside the Simple Finder still has all of its features and complexities—only the Finder has been whittled 
down to its essence.
This, of course, is one of the downfalls of the Simple Finder concept: It's great for streamlining the Finder, but novices won't 
get far swallowing their techno-fear until the world presents us with Simple AppleWorks, Simple Mail, and Simple Microsoft 
Word. Still, it's better than nothing.
In any case, as shown in Figure 11-6, the available programs' icons appear, 12 on a "page," with page buttons and previous/
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (10 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
next buttons at the bottom of the screen. The Simple person can't move, rename, delete, sort, or change the display of them
—merely click them.
When the Simple people try to save documents, they'll find that although the Save box lists the usual locations (Desktop, 
Applications, and so on), in fact, they can save files only into their own Home folders (or folders inside it).
You can add any icon to the list of things you want to start up automatically. Click the + button 
to summon the Open dialog box where you can find the icon, select it, and then click Choose. 
Better yet, if you can see the icon in a folder or disk window (or on the desktop), just drag it into 
this list. You can specify the order in which your startup items open just by dragging them up 
or down in the list. To remove an item, click it in the list and then click the - button.
 
11.3.5 Phase 5: Startup Items
There's one additional System Preferences setting that each account holder can set up for herself: which programs or 
documents open automatically upon login. (This is one decision an administrator can't make for other people. It's available 
only to whoever is logged in at the moment.)
To choose your own crew of self-starters, open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon. Click the Startup Items 
tab. As shown in Figure 11-7, you can now build a list of programs, documents, disks, and other goodies that will auto-
launch each time you log in. You can even turn on the Hide checkbox for each one, so that the program is running in the 
background at login time, waiting to be called into service with a quick click.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (11 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
Don't feel obligated to limit this list to programs and documents, by the way. Disks, folders, servers on the network, and 
other fun icons can also be startup items, so that their windows are open and waiting when you arrive at the Mac each 
morning.
11.3.6 Editing Accounts
Administrators have all the fun, but even peon Standard users are permitted to change their startup pictures and (if the 
administrator has permitted it) passwords. Just open System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click your own account, 
which appears at the top of the account-holders' list. Now you can change whatever settings you like. (Well, almost any 
settings. Only administrators can change an account's name—and even they can't change an account's short name once 
the account has been created.)
11.3.7 Deleting Accounts
Hey, it happens: Somebody graduates, somebody gets fired, somebody dumps you. Sooner or later, you may need to 
delete an account from your Mac.
When that time comes, click the account name in the Accounts list and then click the little minus-sign button beneath the 
list. Panther asks what to do with all of the dearly departed's files and settings:
G     Delete Immediately. This button offers the "Hasta la vista, baby" approach. The account and all of its files and 
settings are vaporized forever, on the spot.
G     OK. This button presents the "I'll be back" approach. Mac OS X will preserve the dearly departed's folders on the 
Mac, in a tidy digital envelope that won't clutter your hard drive, and can be reopened in case of emergency.
In the Users
Deleted Users
[person's name] folder, you'll find a disk image file (.dmg) like the ones 
described in Section 4.10. If you double-click it, you'll find a new, virtual disk icon on your desktop named for the 
deleted account. You can open folders and root through the stuff in this "disk," just as if it were a living, working 
Home folder.
If fate ever brings that person back into your life, you can use this disk image to reinstate the deleted person's 
account. Start by creating a brand-new account. Then copy the contents of the folders in the mounted disk image 
(Documents, Pictures, Desktop, and so on) into the corresponding folders of the new Home folder.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Moving Your Home Folder Between Computers
Mac OS X proposes putting all of the account holders' Home folders in one special folder (Users) on the main 
hard drive. But being able to put somebody's Home folder—such as your own—on a different disk can have 
its advantages, too. If you travel back and forth between home and work, for example, you might find it 
convenient to keep your entire life on an iPod or some other portable disk. In corporate environments, a 
network administrator may want you to keep your Home folder elsewhere on the Windows network. (Yes, Mac 
OS X is that compatible.)
Sure, you can do it, but you'll have to exploit the sometimes- intimidating power of NetInfo Manager, a 
program included with Mac OS X that's designed to let you perform just such technical tasks.
You'll find this program in your Applications
Utilities folder. Open the program, click the lower-left padlock, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-3.html (12 of 14)5/3/2004 5:01:44 AM

11.3 Creating an Account
and then enter an administrator's name and password.
In the second column, click users. In the column to its right, click the name of the account whose Home folder 
you want to move—let's say it's chris. 
In the bottom half of the window, scroll down until you see an entry called home. In the next column, you'll see 
its current location: /Users/chris (that is, the Home folder is called chris, and it's in the Users folder).
Double-click this notation (/Users/chris) to edit it. Change this text to /Volumes/diskname, where diskname is 
the name of your removable disk. ("Volumes" is the name of an invisible folder on your Mac OS X machine 
that lists the names of all disks present.) Press Enter, and then choose Domain
Save (and click "Update 
this copy" in the confirmation box).
Log out and then log back in again—as chris. You should see by the house-shaped icon on your desktop that 
the iPod is now, in effect, your Home folder, complete with all the usual Home-folder subfolders (Desktop, 
Documents, Library, and so on).
You're not allowed to remove the disk from the Mac until you've logged out and logged back in under a 
different account. Once you've done so, remove the disk and take it to work (or wherever the other Mac OS X 
machine is). Insert the disk and then repeat all of these steps so far.
From now on, both Macs will expect to find your Home folder on that removable disk. (Make sure that you've 
inserted it and given it time to spin up before you log in. And of course, don't remove the disk while you're 
logged in.)
And by the way, the procedure described here will leave the original chris folder on the primary hard drive—an 
orphaned duplicate. It's not doing any harm, but if you find its presence confusing, you can always delete it by 
restarting your Mac in Mac OS 9 (if your Mac can do that) or using the sudo rm command in Terminal (if you 
know how to do that; see Chapter 16).

11.4 Setting Up the Login/Logout Process
Once you've set up more than one account, the dialog box shown in Figure 11-1 appears whenever you turn on the Mac, 
whenever you choose 
Log Out, or whenever the Mac logs you out automatically (Section 11.4.1). But a few extra 
controls let you, an administrator, set up either more or less security at the login screen—or, put another way, build in less 
or more convenience.
Top: This dialog box lets you know where to find the deleted account's material, should the 
need arise.
Bottom: The files and settings of accounts you deleted live on, in the Users

11.4 Setting Up the Login/Logout Process
 
11.4.1 Login Options
Open System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options button (Figure 11-9). Here are some of the 
ways you can shape the login experience for greater security (or greater convenience).
G     Display Login Window as. Under normal circumstances, the login screen presents a list of account holders when 
you power up the Mac, as shown in Figure 11-1. That's the "List of users" option in action.
If you're especially worried about security, however, you might not even want that list to appear. If you turn on 
"Name and password," each person who signs in must type both his name (into a blank that appears) and his 
password—a very inconvenient, but secure, arrangement.
G     Automatically log in as: This option eliminates the need to sign in at all. It's a timesaving, hassle-free arrangement 
if only one person uses the Mac, or if one person uses it most of the time.
These options make it easier or harder for people to sign in, offering various degrees of 
security. By the way: Turning on "List of users" also lets you sign in as >console, a 
troubleshooting technique described in Appendix B.9.2. It's also one way to sign in with 
the root account Section 11.8, once you've activated it.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-4.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:47 AM

11.4 Setting Up the Login/Logout Process
When you choose an account holder's name from this pop-up menu, you're prompted for his name and password. 
Type it and click OK.
From now on, the dialog box shown in Figure 11-1 won't appear at all at startup time. After turning on the machine, 
you, the specified account holder, will zoom straight to your desktop.
Of course, only one lucky person can enjoy this express ticket. Everybody else must still enter their names and 
passwords. (And how can they, since the Mac rushes right into the Automatic person's account at startup time? 
Answer: The Automatic thing happens only at startup time. The usual login screen appears whenever the current 
account holder logs out—by choosing 
Log Out, for example.)
G     Hide the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons. If you haven't turned on File- Vault, the Mac OS X security 
system is easy to circumvent. Truly devoted evildoers can bypass the standard login screen in a number of different 
ways: by restarting in Mac OS 9, restarting in FireWire Disk Mode, restarting at the Unix Terminal, and so on. 
Suddenly, these no-goodniks have full access to every document on the machine, blowing right past all of the 
safeguards you've so carefully established. (As noted earlier, using FileVault closes all of these back doors and 
more.)
One way to thwart them is to turn on this checkbox. Now there's no Restart or Shut Down button to tempt mischief-
makers. That's plenty of protection in most homes, schools, and workplaces; after all, Mac people tend to be nice 
people.
But if you worry that somebody with a pronounced mean streak might restart simply by pulling the plug, then either 
use FileVault or set the Open Firmware password, as described in the box below.
G     Enable fast user switching. This new Panther feature is described in Section 11-7.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The Open Firmware Password
After all this discussion of security and passwords, it may come as a bit of a shock to learn that enterprising 
villains can bypass all of Mac OS X's security features in 10 seconds. If you haven't turned on FileVault, their 
nefarious options include restarting the Mac with a Mac OS 9 CD in the drive, using the Unix console 
described in Appendix B, using FireWire disk mode (Section 6.2) age 183), and so on.
But there is one way to secure your Mac completely: by using the Open Firmware Password program. (It's on 
your original Mac OS X Install CD, Disc 1, in the Applications
 Utilities folder. You can also download it 
from www.info.apple.com ; search for Open Firmware Password in the Downloads section.)
Once you've turned on Open Firmware Password protection, none of the usual startup-key tricks work. 
Holding down the C key to start up from a CD, holding down N to start up from a NetBoot server, pressing T to 
start up in Target Disk Mode, 
-V to start up in Verbose mode, 
-S to start up in Single-user mode, 
-
Option-P-R key to reset the parameter RAM, pressing Option to start up from a different system disk—none of 
it works without the master Open Firmware Password.
When you run this little utility, you turn on a checkbox called "Require password to change Open Firmware 
settings," as shown here. Then you make up a master password that's required even to turn the Mac on.
This password is deadly serious and un-hackable, and there's no back door. If you forget the Open Firmware 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-4.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:47 AM

11.4 Setting Up the Login/Logout Process
password, you can't change the startup disk ever again. Even Apple can't help you out of that situation.
Once you've entered a password into both boxes, you're asked for an administrator's password. Finally, a 
message tells you that, "The settings were successfully saved." Restart the Mac.
From now on, whenever you attempt to start up in anything but the usual way (primary hard drive, standard 
login screen), you'll be asked to type in the Open Firmware password. For example, you'll see it when you 
press the C key to start up from a CD, or when you press Option to choose a different startup disk or partition.
No amount of clever restarting or inserting of disks can bypass this heavily armed gatekeeper.

11.4 Setting Up the Login/Logout Process
As you'll read later in this chapter, the usual procedure for finishing up a work session is for each person to choose 
Log Out. After you confirm your intention to log out, the sign-in screen appears, ready for the next victim.
But sometimes people forget. You might wander off to the bathroom for a minute, run into a colleague there who 
breathlessly begins describing last night's date and then proposes finishing the conversation over pizza. The next thing you 
know, you've left your Mac unattended but logged in, with all your life's secrets accessible to anyone who walks by your 
desk.
You can prevent that situation using either of two checkboxes, both in the Security panel of System Preferences:
G     Require password to wake this computer from sleep or screen saver. This option gives you a password-
protected screen saver that locks your Mac after a few minutes of inactivity. Now, whenever somebody tries to 
wake up your Mac after the screen saver has appeared (or when the Mac has simply gone to sleep according to 
your settings in the Energy Saver panel of System Preferences), the "Enter your password" dialog box will appear. 
No password? No access.
G     Log out after __ minutes of inactivity. If you prefer, you can make the Mac sign out of your account completely if 
it figures out that you've wandered off (and it's been, say, 15 minutes since the last time you touched the mouse or 
keyboard). Instead, it presents the standard Login screen.
DON'T PANIC
The Case of the Forgotten Password
Help—I forgot my password! And I never told it to anybody, so even the administrator can't help me! 
No problem. Your administrator can simply open up System Preferences, click Users, click the name of the 
person who forgot the password, and then click Edit to re-establish the password.
But you don't understand. I am the administrator! And I'm the only account! 
Aha—that's a different story. All right, no big deal. At the login screen, type a gibberish password three times. 
On the last attempt, the Mac will offer you the chance to reset the password. All you have to do is type in your 
Master password (Section 11.3.3) to prove your credentials.
Um—I never set up a master password. 
All right then. That's actually good news, because it means you didn't turn on FileVault. (If you had, and you'd 
also forgotten the master password, your account would now be locked away forever.)
Insert the Mac OS X CD. Restart the Mac while pressing down the letter C key, which starts up the Mac from 
the CD and launches the Mac OS X installer.
On the first installer screen, choose Installer
Reset Password. When the Reset Password screen 
appears, click the hard drive that contains Mac OS X. From the first pop-up menu, choose the name of your 
account. Now make up a new password and type it into both boxes. Click Save, close the window, click the 
installer, and restart.
And next time, be more careful! Write down your password on a Post-it note and affix it to your monitor. (Joke
—that's a joke!)

11.5 Signing In
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.5 Signing In
Here's how you go about getting into, and out of, a Mac OS X machine once somebody has set up your account, . (For the 
purposes of this discussion, "you" are no longer the administrator—you're one of the students, employees, or family 
members for whom an account has been set up.)
11.5.1 Identifying Yourself
When you first turn on the Mac—or when the person who last used this computer chooses 
Log Out—the login 
screen shown in Figure 11-1 appears. At this point, you can proceed in any of several ways:
G     Restart. Click if you need to restart the Mac for some reason. (The Restart and Shut Down buttons don't appear 
here if the administrator has chosen to hide them as a security precaution; see Section 11.4.1)
G     Shut Down. Click if you're done for the day, or if sudden panic about the complexity of user accounts makes you 
want to run away. The computer turns off.
G     Log in. To sign in, click your account name in the list. If you're a keyboard speed freak, you can also type the first 
letter or two—or press the up or down arrow keys—until your name is highlighted. Then press Return or Enter.
Either way, the password box appears now (if a password is required). If you accidentally click the wrong person's 
name on the first screen, you can click Go Back. Otherwise, type your password and then press Enter (or click Log 
In).
You can try as many times as you want to type the password. With each incorrect guess, the entire dialog box 
shudders violently from side to side, as though shaking its head "No." If you try unsuccessfully three times, your 
hint appears-if you've set one up.
If you ever forget your password, and even the Mac's administrator doesn't know it, your third 
attempt to type the password correctly produces not only your password hint, but also a 
button called Reset Password. When you click it, the Mac asks for the master password 
(Section 11.3.3), which the administrator almost certainly knows.
Once that's typed in, you're allowed to make up a new password for your own account (and, 
presumably, a better hint this time). No harm done.
11.5.2 Your World
Once you're in, the world of the Mac looks just the way you left it (or the way an administrator set it up for you). As noted in 
Chapter 2, most of the action revolves around the Applications folder, the Dock, and your own Home folder (press Shift-
-
H to open it).
Mac OS X keeps almost everything in your Mac world separate from anybody else who uses this Mac. A few examples are 
especially worth noting:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-5.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:51 AM

11.5 Signing In
G     Fonts. You can install your own preferred fonts into your Home folder
Library
 Fonts folder. Only you will 
be able to see them and use them in your programs.
G     Programs. Unless you're an administrator, you're not allowed to install any new programs (or indeed, to put 
anything at all) into the Applications folder. That folder, after all, is a central software repository for everybody who 
uses the Mac, and all such universally shared folders are off-limits to everyday account holders. (You can drag 
things out of the Applications folder, but doing so doesn't actually move them—it just copies them.)
That's not to say that you can't install new programs of your own. You can-but you must put them somewhere in 
your own Home folder (where you'll be the only person with access to such programs) or in the Shared folder (if 
you want other people to be able to use them). You may want to create a Programs folder there just for this 
purpose.
G     Bookmarks. When you browse the Web, you can freely "bookmark" your favorite Web pages, confident that 
nobody else who uses your Mac will be able to see where you've been or what you consider your favorite sites.
G     Mail. Your email collection is yours and yours alone. When your sister tries to run the same email program, she'll 
find her email there.
11.5.3 The Shared Folder
Every Mac OS X machine has a Users folder in the main hard drive window. It contains the individual Home folders of every 
account on this Mac.
If you try to open anybody else's Home folder, you'll see a tiny red "no go here" icon superimposed on almost every folder 
inside, telling you: "Look, but don't touch."
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Shared Data Files
My wife and my eight-year-old kid share my Mac. Over the years, we've amassed a fabulous collection of 
MP3 files, but at the moment, I'm the only one who sees them in iTunes. This business of separate 
environments for every account holder is all well and good, but what about when we want to access the same 
files—like our iTunes library? 
The problem is that the iTunes library is stored in the Music folder of just one person. Fortunately, the solution 
is easy enough.
Whoever is the administrator—probably your eight-year old —should move the iTunes folder (currently in 
somebody's Music folder) to the Users
Shared folder. Now it's available to everybody. 
At this point, each account holder can log in, fire up iTunes, choose iTunes
Preferences
Advanced, 
and click the Change button to choose the relocated iTunes Music Folder in the Shared folder.
From now on, each person will be able to see and access the entire library of iTunes tunes, but will still enjoy 
the flexibility to build individual playlists.
There are exceptions, though. As shown in Figure 11-10, two folders are designed to be distribution points for files your co-
workers want you to see: Public and Sites.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-5.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:51 AM

You, too, have Public and Sites folders in your own Home folder. Here again, anything you put into these folders is 
available for inspection—although not for changing—by anyone else who uses this Mac.
Top: In other people's Home folders, the Public and Sites folders are available for your 
inspection. These two folders contain stuff that other people have "published" for the benefit of 
their co-workers.
Middle: In the Public folder is the Drop Box, which serves the opposite purpose. It lets anyone 
else who uses this Mac hand in files to you (but they can't see what's in it).
Bottom: Inside the Users folder (to get there from a Home folder, press 
up- arrow) is the 
Shared folder, a wormhole between all accounts. Everybody has full access to everything 
inside.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-5.html (3 of 6)5/3/2004 5:01:51 AM

11.5 Signing In
 
Sitting in the Users folder is one folder that doesn't correspond to any particular person: Shared. This is the one and only 
folder that everybody can access, freely inserting and extracting files. It's the common ground among all the account 
holders. It's Central Park, the farmer's market, and the grocery store bulletin board.
11.5.4 Changing Permissions
A factory-fresh installation of Mac OS X offers one way for you to submit files to somebody else (that person's Public 
folder), one way to accept files from other people (your Drop Box folder), and one community folder (the Shared folder).
This arrangement is relatively secure and relatively easy to understand. But maybe you'd like even more security; you'd 
rather seal off your Public folder so that people can't see what's inside. Or maybe you'd like greater convenience; you'd like 
to set up some additional drop box folders, or other "public" folders, for your co-workers' use.
The business of changing the permissions, or access privileges, for certain folders can be complex and brain-bending. A full 
discussion begins in Section 12.2.10. In the meantime, here's a quick summary of some typical setups.
In each case, you can't make changes unless either (a) you have an Administrator account or (b) it's a folder that you own 
(it's in your Home folder, or you created it).
Begin by highlighting the folder in question and choosing File
Get Info. Expand the Ownership & Permissions section, 
and then the Details section. Prove your worthiness as an administrator by clicking the tiny padlock icon (and typing your 
password, if any).
At this point, an administrator can change the ownership of the folder just by choosing 
another name from the Owner pop-up menu. In other words, an administrator actually has 
full access to every folder in every account. Better be good, you Standard account-holding 
boys and girls!
Now you can use the Access pop-up menus as follows:
G     Full access by everybody. If you want to turn one of your folders into one that resembles the Shared folder (full 
free access by anyone with an account), set up its Get Info window like the one shown at left in Figure 11-11.
G     Give, but don't take. To make another folder work like your Drop Box folder (people can put things in, but can't

11.5 Signing In
actually open the folder), set things up as shown at middle in Figure 11-11.
Remember that people can't put anything into a new Drop Box-type folder if they can't get to 
it. That is, make sure you've turned on "Read" access for whatever folder it's in. (Making a 
Drop Box folder in your Documents folder, for example, won't work because nobody is 
allowed to open your Documents folder to begin with.)
G     Look, but don't touch. You can also turn any of your folders into another Publictype, "bulletin board" folder—that 
is, people can open or copy files from inside, but they can't put anything in or save any changes they make.
You'll realize the importance of mastering these various access permissions when you get a load of this startling fact: 
Unless you intervene, everybody else who uses this Mac will be able to peek into everything in every new folder you create 
(unless it's inside a folder that is, itself, off-limits). Technically speaking, every new folder springs into existence with Read-
only permissions for Everyone. They're allowed to open or copy anything inside.
The bottom line: As you type the title of a new folder that you suspect might be best kept private (Salaries 2004 or My Spicy 
Dreams Journal, let's say), remember to use the File
Get Info routine to change the new folder's Everyone and Group 
settings to None.
(Even so, remember that anyone with an Administrator account can blow your intentions to smithereens. Such people can, 
at any time, override your ownership and permission settings, even making your folders off-limits to you, if they so desire. 
That's what you get for using a Mac that you've allowed somebody else to set up for you.)
Three typical configurations for folders you've created in your Home folder. Set the three pop-
up menus as shown for a Shared-type folder (left), a drop-box folder (middle), and the "bulletin 
board" folder (right). Click the "Apply to enclosed items" button if you want the same settings 
to apply to all the folders inside this one. Finally, close the Get Info window.

11.7 Fast User Switching
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.7 Fast User Switching
The account system described so far in this chapter has its charms. It keeps everyone's stuff separate, it keeps your files 
safe, and it lets you have the desktop picture of your choice.
As fans of Mac OS X 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2 may have discovered, though, it was capable of going from handy to hassle in 
one split second. That's when you're logged in, and somebody else wants to duck in just for a second—to check email or a 
calendar, for example. You had no choice but to log out completely, closing all of your documents and quitting all of your 
programs. When the interloper was finished, you had to log back in and fire up all your stuff again, hoping against hope that 
your inspirational muse hadn't fled in the meantime.
Fortunately, that's all over now. A new Panther feature called Fast User Switching —modeled on a similar Windows XP 
feature, which itself is modeled on a Unix feature—lets Person B log in and use the Mac for a little while. All of your stuff, 
Person A, simply slides into the background, still open the way you had it (see Figure 11-12).
When Person B is finished working, you can bring your whole work environment back to the screen without having to 
reopen anything. All your windows and programs are still open, just as you left them.
To turn on this feature, open the Accounts panel of System Preferences. Click Login Options, and turn on "Enable fast user 
switching." (You can see this dialog box in Figure 11-12.)
The only change you'll notice immediately is the appearance of your own account name in the upper-right corner of the 
screen (Figure 11-12).
Top: The appearance of the Accounts menu lets you know that Fast User Switching is turned 
on. The circled check mark indicates people who are already logged in, including those who 
have been "fast user switched" into the background. The dimmed account name shows who's 
logged in right now.
Bottom: Fast User Switching lets one account holder "cut in" without requiring someone else 
to log out first. When the screen changes from your account to somebody else's, your entire 
world slides visibly offscreen as though it's mounted on the side of a rotating cube—a 
spectacular animation made possible by Mac OS X's Quartz Extreme graphics software. (On 
older Macs that lack Quartz Extreme, you get the feature, but not the animation.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-7.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 5:01:55 AM

11.7 Fast User Switching
 
That's all there is to it. Next time you need a fellow account holder to relinquish control so that you can duck in to do a little 
work, just choose your name from the Accounts menu. Then merely type your password, if one is required, and feel 
guiltless about the interruption.
And now, the finer points of fast user switching:
G     Depending on how many programs are open and how much memory the Mac has, switching accounts may entail a 
delay and a good deal of hard-drive activity. That's Mac OS X's virtual memory scheme kicking in, "setting down" 
what was in memory in your account to make room for the incoming account's stuff.
G     There's only one way to neatly close one of the accounts listed in the Accounts menu: switch to it and then choose 
Log Out as usual.
G     Weirdly enough, a bunch of account holders can be using the same program simultaneously in their own parallel 
universes. Even if Microsoft Word was open in your account, Chris, Casey, and Robin can each open the same 
copy of the same program simultaneously when they fast-switch into their own accounts. (Word in that case uses 
up four times as much memory, of course.)

11.7 Fast User Switching
G     You can't make changes to accounts (in System Preferences) that are still logged in. Nor, as you'd expect, can you 
turn off Fast User Switching while other people are logged in.
G     If you try to shut the Mac down or restart it while other people are logged in, a dialog box tells you: "There are 
currently logged in users who may lose unsaved changes if you shut down this computer." Now you're asked to 
type in an administrator's name and password to establish that you know what the heck you're doing.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Fast Opinion Switching
This might blow your mind, but Fast User Switching isn't just for letting several people use the Mac at 
once. You can also use it to keep different work environments separate, even if you're the only one 
who uses the Mac.
That is, you can treat each account as an environment. One account can be your word processing 
setup, with the Mac's colors, desktop picture, Dock, programs, and palettes set up just so. Another 
can be your graphics environment, with Photoshop open and its various tools arrayed. A third can be 
your Internet world, with Safari and Mail always open and always online.
 
As you proceed through your workday, you can simply switch among these accounts as though 
they're separate workstations with separate monitors. You have a minimum of preference-changing 
and window-adjusting to do as you move from one aspect of your work to another.
Fast User Switching: It's not just for family members anymore.
Here's a moral dilemma for the modern age. If you proceed by typing the password and clicking Shut Down, you 
shut down all accounts that were open in the background and any open documents-and if those documents hadn't 
been saved, all changes are gone forever. Of course, if you click Cancel, you can't shut down the Mac at all, or at 
least not until you hunt down the account holders whose stuff is still open in the background so that they can log 
out one at a time.

11.7 Fast User Switching
You can avoid this awkward situation in either of two ways: (1) Trust each other 
completely. (2) Save all your documents before you let anyone else cut in and send 
your account to the background.
G     Remember the Shared folder (in the Users folder on the hard drive)? It's still the wormhole between all accounts. If 
you want to share a file with another account holder, put it there.
G     Your account isn't anesthetized completely. In fact, it keeps on doing whatever you set it to doing. If you were 
downloading some big file, for example, it keeps right on downloading when the next guy logs in.
G     A few programs, like Macromedia's MX 2004 programs (Freehand, Dreamweaver, and so on), don't work when 
Fast User Switching is turned on. Bummer.

11.8 The Root Account
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
11.8 The Root Account
An administrator's account isn't exactly a skeleton key that gives unfettered access to every corner of the Mac. Even an 
administrator isn't allowed to remove files from the System folder or other files whose removal could hobble the machine.
It turns out that Standard and Administrator aren't the only kinds of accounts. There's one account that wields ultimate 
power, one person who can do anything to any file anywhere. This person is called the superuser.
Unix fans speak of the superuser account—also called the root account—in hushed tones, because it offers absolutely 
unrestricted power. The root account holder can move, delete, rename, or otherwise mangle any file on the machine, no 
matter what folder it's in. One wrong move—or one Internet hacker who manages to seize the root account—and you've got 
yourself a $2,500 doorstop. That's why Mac OS X's root account is completely hidden and, in fact, deactivated.
There's another reason this account comes turned off: You can enjoy most root-like powers without actually turning on the 
root account. Here, for example, are some of the things the root account holder can do—and the ways you can do them 
without ducking into a phone booth to become the superuser:
G     See the thousands of crucial system files that Mac OS X ordinarily renders invisible. Of course, you can also 
see them extremely easily just by using the shareware program TinkerTool (see Section 17.1). You can also use 
the Terminal program as described in Chapter 15.
G     Manipulate the files within the System folder's Library folder. First of all, you'd be nuts to try. The numero uno 
virtue of Mac OS X is its stability—its System folder's invulnerability to change. Sure, you can mess around with its 
contents, but if you really wanted a crash-prone machine, you could have stuck with Mac OS 9.
Anyway, even if you did want to fool around with these files, there's a much easier way: Restart the Mac in Mac OS 
9. You'll have full access to all Mac OS X files and folders.
G     Peek into other account holders' folders (or even trash them). You don't have to be the superuser to do this—
you just have to be an administrator who's smart enough to use the Get Info command, as described in Section 2.8.
G     Use powerful Unix system commands. As you'll discover in Chapter 16, some of the Unix commands you can 
issue in Mac OS X require superuser powers. As you'll also find out in that chapter, however, there's a simple 
command—the sudo command—that simulates root powers without you actually having them. Details in Section 
16.1.4.1.
Treat the root account, in other words, as you would one of those "Break glass in case of fire" boxes. If you know what 
you're doing, and you see no alternative, you might be glad the root account is available. System-customization freaks who 
enjoy editing the look of window title bars, say, may need to enable the root account. And certain pre-Panther software 
installers, like the one for Palm Desktop 4.1, won't install correctly except when you're using the root account.
You can turn on the root account in any of several ways. One of them involves typing a Unix command or two (Section 
16.2), but the technique most people use goes like this:
1.  In your Applications
Utilities folder, open the NetInfo Manager program. Click the tiny padlock in the 
lower-left corner of its screen. 
A dialog box asks you for an administrator's name and password. After all, you wouldn't want ordinary underlings 
fooling around with the superuser account.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-11-SECT-8.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:01:58 AM

11.8 The Root Account
2.  Type your name and password, and then click OK. 
You're in. (If you're not an administrator, then you probably shouldn't be using the root account.)
3.  Choose Security
Enable Root User. 
If this is the first time you've performed this particular surgery, you'll be told, "The root password is currently blank." 
You're asked to make up a "non-trivial" (meaning virtually impossible for anyone to guess) password for the newly 
created root account.
4.  Click OK and then type the password in both of the bottom Password boxes. Click OK two more times. 
The second dialog box simply tells you that if you intend to make any more changes in NetInfo Manager, you'll 
have to sign in as an administrator again. But your work is done here.
5.  Quit NetInfo Manager. 
You've just brought the dormant root account to life.
6.  Log out. Log back in again as root. 
That is, when the login screen appears, click Other User (a choice that magically appears once you've turned on 
the root account). In the first text box, type root. In the second, type the password you made up in step 4. Click Log 
In.
That's it—you arrive at the desktop, where no matter what you do, no error messages regarding access privileges or 
ownership will interrupt the proceedings. In the words of every movie hero's sidekick: Be careful out there.
When you're finished going about your business as a root user, immediately log out again. It's important to rule out the 
possibility that some clueless or malicious person might wander up to the Mac while you're still logged in as the superuser.
In fact, if you don't anticipate needing your superuser powers again soon, consider turning off the root account altogether. 
(Just repeat steps 1 and 2 on the preceding page. In step 3, choose Security
Disable Root User.)

Chapter 12. Networking
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Chapter 12. Networking
Just about every Mac ever built is network-ready. Buy a few cables and adapters, and you can connect all the Macs in your 
office together, with or without wires. The process of rigging the hardware and software for a network is somewhat more 
technical than, say, emptying the Trash, but it's not exactly rocket science. 
Once you've got a network, you can copy files from one machine to another just as you'd drag files between folders on your 
own Mac. You can send little messages to each other's screens. Everyone on the network can consult the same database 
or calendar. You can play games over the network. You can share a single printer, cable modem, or fax modem among all 
the Macs in the office. You can connect to this network from wherever you are in the world, using the Internet as the world's 
longest extension cord back to your office. And in Mac OS X, you can even connect to Windows machines without having to 
buy any additional software. 
Best of all, all the software you need to create such a network is built right into Mac OS X. 
As you read this chapter, remember the difficulty Apple faces: It must design a networking system simple enough for the 
laptop owner who just wants to copy things to a desktop Mac when returning from a trip, yet secure and flexible enough for 
the network designer at a large corporation. In general, you'll probably find that Apple has done an excellent job of 
balancing these two wildly different motivations. 
You don't necessarily need a network to exchange files between Macs (and even PCs). If 
each computer is equipped with a Bluetooth card, they can shoot files back and forth 
wirelessly, as described in Section 6.2.6

12.1 Wiring the Network
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
12.1 Wiring the Network
Most people connect the Macs (and other computers) in their offices using either of two connection systems: Ethernet or 
AirPort. 
12.1.1 Ethernet Networks
These days, every Mac and every network-ready laser printer has an Ethernet jack on the back or side panel (see Figure 
12-1 ). If you connect all of the Macs and Ethernet printers in your small office to a central Ethernet hub—a compact, 
inexpensive box with jacks for five, ten, or even more computers and printers—you've got yourself a very fast, very reliable 
network. (Most people wind up hiding the Ethernet hub in a closet, and running the wiring either along the edges of the 
room or inside the walls.) You can buy Ethernet cables, plus the Ethernet hub, at any computer store or, less expensively, 
from an Internet-based mail-order house. (Hubs aren't Mac-specific.) 
If you want to connect only two Macs—say, your laptop and your desktop machine—you 
don't need an Ethernet hub. Instead, you just need an Ethernet crossover cable—about $8 
from a computer store or online mail-order supplier. Run it directly between the Ethernet 
jacks of the two computers. Better yet, if you have a metal-clad PowerBook, a white iBook, or 
a recent desktop model (like a Power Mac G5), you can use either a crossover cable or a 
traditional Ethernet cable.
Or don't use Ethernet at all; just use a FireWire cable (Section 12.1.3 ).
Ethernet is the best networking system for many offices. It's fast, easy, and cheap. 
Every Mac OS X-compatible Mac has an Ethernet jack (left). It looks like an overweight 
telephone jack. It connects to an Ethernet hub (right) via Ethernet cable (also known as Cat 5), 
which ends in what looks like an overweight telephone-wire plug (also known as an RJ-45 
connector).

12.1 Wiring the Network
12.1.2 AirPort Networks
Of course, the Mac wouldn't be the Mac if it couldn't connect to other Macs using the most exciting kind of networking 
connection: radio waves. You can install an $80 metal AirPort card, about the size of a Visa card, into almost any Mac OS 
X-compatible Mac. This card lets your machine connect to your network without any wires at all—as long as they're within 
about 150 feet of a base station, which must in turn be physically connected to your network. (If you think about it, the 
AirPort system is a lot like a cordless phone in that the Mac is the handset.)
Although novices may never even realize it, AirPort is actually Apple's name for the popular 
WiFi or 802.11 wireless network system. You can find free or inexpensive WiFi hot spots 
(base stations) all over the country—in coffee shops, airports, parks, offices, McDonald's 
restaurants, and so on. Just whip open your laptop, check the AirPort menulet for a signal 
(Section 3.6), and start using the Internet! 
The base station can take any of these forms:
G     AirPort Base Station. This $200 Apple product looks like a small white or silver flying saucer. (The $250 version 
has a built-in modem, so that it can dial up the Internet while you're comfortably relaxing in a room that doesn't 
even have a phone jack.) 
G     A wireless broadband router. These gadgets are, in essence, AirPort Base Station clones from other companies, 
such as MaxGate (www.maxgate.net ) or Macsense (www.xsense.com ). You can plug the base station into an 
Ethernet hub, thus permitting 10 or 20 AirPort-equipped Macs to join an existing Ethernet network without wiring. 
G     Another Mac. Your Mac can also impersonate an AirPort base station. In effect, the Mac becomes a software-
based base station. 
UP TO SPEED
AirPort: Regular or Supersized?
You can buy your AirPort gear in either of two variants: the original AirPort or the newer AirPort Extreme. 
The difference involves the technical specs of the wireless signal. Original AirPort uses the 802.11b standard; 
AirPort Extreme uses 802.11g. (Incidentally, Apple didn't make up this ridiculous terminology.) 
So what's the difference? Equipment bearing the "b" label transfers data through the air at up to 11 megabits 
per second; the "g" system is almost five times as fast. (Traditionally, geeks measure network speeds in 
megabits, not megabytes. If you're more familiar with megabytes, though, here's a translation: The older 
AirPort gear has a top speed of 1.4 megabytes per second, versus more than 6 megabytes per second for the 
AirPort Extreme stuff.) 
The beauty of the Extreme (802.11g) gear, though, is that it's backwards-compatible with the original AirPort 
gear, and vice versa. If you have a PowerBook with an original AirPort card, you can hop onto an Extreme 
base station simultaneously with people using Extreme cards—and if you have an AirPort Extreme card, you 
can hop onto older base stations. You won't get better speed, of course, but at least you won't need a 
separate base station. 
It's important to understand, though, that a cable modem or DSL box delivers Internet information at only 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-1.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 5:02:03 AM

12.1 Wiring the Network
about half a megabyte per second. The bottleneck is the Internet connection, not your network. Don't buy 
AirPort Extreme gear thinking that you're going to speed up your email and Web activity. 
Instead, the speed boost you get with AirPort Extreme is useful only for transferring files between computers 
on your own network—and playing networkable games. 
Incidentally, the great thing about wireless networking is that it all works together, no matter what kind of 
computer you have. There's no such thing as a "Windows" wireless network or a "Macintosh" wireless 
network. Macs can use non-Apple base stations, PCs can use AirPort base stations, and so on. 
The Mac itself must have an AirPort card inside, but you may still save money. By equipping a Mac with a $80 card, you 
save yourself the purchase of a $200 AirPort base station. (Much more on AirPort network setups in Chapter 18.) 
12.1.3 FireWire Networks
FireWire networks?
You're forgiven for splurting your coffee. Everyone knows that FireWire is great for hooking up a digital camera or an iPod, 
and a few people know about FireWire Disk Mode (Section 6.2). But not many people realize that FireWire makes a 
fantastic networking cable, since it's insanely, blisteringly fast. (All right, gigabit Ethernet is faster. But attaining that kind of 
networking nirvana requires that all your Macs, hubs, and other networking gear are all gigabit-Ethernet compatible.) 
FireWire networking, technically known as IP over FireWire, is an unheralded, unsung feature of Mac OS X 10.3. But when 
you have a lot of data to move between Macs—your desktop and your laptop, for example—a casual FireWire network is 
the way to go. It lets you copy a gigabyte of email, pictures, or video files in a matter of seconds. 
Here's how you unleash this secret feature.
1.  Connect two Macs with a FireWire cable. 
You can't use the one that fits a camcorder. You need a six-pin-to-six-pin cable for traditional FireWire jacks (like 
the one that came with original iPods). If you want to use the faster FireWire 800 connection on the latest Mac 
models, you'll need to shop for an even less common cord. 
In any case, the computers can remain turned on. (That's one difference from FireWire Disk Mode. The other 
difference is that you can continue to use both Macs while they're connected.) 
2.  Open System Preferences. Click Network. From the Show pop-up menu, choose Network Port 
Configurations. 
The dialog box shown in Figure 12-2 appears, showing all the different ways your Mac can connect to a network. 
3.  Click New. Type a name (like FireWire) and, from the Port pop-up menu, choose Built-in FireWire (Figure 12-
2). Click OK. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-1.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 5:02:03 AM

12.1 Wiring the Network
Your FireWire network connection appears in the list.
4.  Drag the word FireWire to the top of the list. Click Apply Now. 
This is an important step! If you don't drag the FireWire connection to the top, the network won't work, because 
your Mac won't assign itself an IP address. 
5.  Repeat steps 2-4 on the second Mac. 
By now, it may have dawned on you that you can't actually get online via FireWire, since your cable runs directly 
between two Macs. But you can always turn on Internet Sharing (Section 18.8) on the other Mac. 
6.  Quit System Preferences. 
Your Macs are ready to talk—fast. 
Once you've switched on your FireWire connection, you may need to turn File Sharing or 
Internet Sharing off and on again to make it work.
In the Network pane of System Preferences, you can add your FireWire port to the list of 
network connections. The point of this window, by the way, is that a Mac can maintain 
simultaneous open network connections—Ethernet, AirPort, FireWire, and dial-up modem. 
(That's a feature called multihoming.) On this screen, you drag them into the order you prefer, 
usually fastest first.

12.2 File Sharing
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
12.2 File Sharing
When you're done wiring (or not wiring, as the case may be), your network is ready. Your Mac should "see" any Ethernet or 
shared USB printers, in readiness to print (see Chapter 13). You can now play network games or use a network calendar. 
And you can now turn on File Sharing, one of the most useful features of the Mac OS. 
In File Sharing, you can summon the icon for a folder or disk attached to another computer on the network, whether it's a 
Mac or a Windows PC. It shows up in a Finder window, as shown in Figure 12-3. At this point, you can drag files back and 
forth, exactly as though the other computer's folder or disk is a hard drive connected to your own machine. 
12.2.1 Setting up the Computers
These instructions assume that you've already set up your network, as described at the beginning of this chapter.
The point of file sharing is to bring other Macs and PCs onto your own screen—in this example, 
the contents of the account called apple on the Mac called G5 Mama. By dragging icons back 
and forth, you can transfer your work from your main Mac to your laptop; give copies of your 
documents to other people; create a "drop box" that collects submissions; and so on. 
 
12.2.1.1 Setting up a Mac OS X machine
The first step in setting up file sharing is to create an account for each person who might want to visit (Chapter 11). 
Whatever password you use to log in to the Mac computer is the same password you need to connect over the network. In 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (1 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
other words, Mac OS X doesn't care how you try to get into your own stuff, just as long as it's sure that you're you.
If you work alone, or with only a few trusted others, you can make life easier for yourself in a 
couple of ways. First, give yourself no password at all. Second, give yourself a very short, 
easy-to-type name—just your initials, for example. 
Once you've established accounts for everybody who might want to access your Mac—even if it's only you—you're ready to 
proceed with preparing the machine for access from elsewhere on the network. 
1.  Open System Preferences (Chapter 8). Click the Sharing icon. 
The Sharing panel appears, as shown at top in Figure 12-4.
NOTE
Only administrators (Section 11.2) are allowed to fool around with the settings you're about to change. If 
the little padlock icon in the lower-left corner looks locked, call an administrator over, click the lock, and 
prove that you have permission to do what you're doing by entering (or asking the administrator to 
enter) the administrator's name and password. 
2.  In the Computer Name blank, change your Mac's name, if you like. 
Your Mac will appear on the network with this name. Make it nice and descriptive, such as Front Desk iMac. If other 
Macs on your network run Mac OS X 10.2 or later, you can also edit your Rendezvous name (Section 12.2.10.1) by 
clicking the Edit button. (You're not allowed to use spaces or punctuation—except hyphens—in the Rendezvous 
name.) 
Top: Here's the master on/off switch for file sharing over the network in Mac OS X—the 
Sharing panel of System Preferences. (The toolbar has been hidden in this illustration.) 
Bottom: In Mac OS 9, this is the setup for a security-free, high-convenience file-sharing 
arrangement. You'll be able to access any Mac on the network without typing in a name, 
password, or anything. If you work alone with a couple of Macs, or with coworkers you 
trust, this is the most efficient arrangement.

12.2 File Sharing
 
3.  In the list of checkboxes, turn on Personal File Sharing (Figure 12-4, top). 
If you want Windows PCs on your network to be able to connect to your Mac too, turn on Windows Sharing as well. 
These features takes a moment to warm up; when File Sharing is finally on, the button says Stop. Close the 
window, if you like. 
Repeat this process on each Mac OS X machine in your office, giving each one a different computer name.

12.2 File Sharing
12.2.2 Connection Method A: The Sidebar
Suppose you're seated at your Power Mac (running Mac OS X), but you need a file that's on the flat-screen iMac down the 
hall. As long as the other machine is running Mac OS 8.6 or later, the steps to accessing shared stuff on another networked 
Mac are the same: 
1.  Open any Finder window. 
For example, press 
-N, or click the Finder icon on your Dock. 
2.  Click the Network icon in the Sidebar. 
This is the cool part, new in Panther: your network is built right into your desktop.
For several seconds, you may not see anything at all, or maybe just a Server icon. But wait it out. After 5, 10, or 30 
seconds, more icons appear. 
Depending on the complexity of your network, you may see the icons for individual Macs (Chris's iBook, PowerMac 
G5, and so on); skip to step 4. Or you may see an assortment of "network neighborhoods"—limbs of your network 
tree, as shown in Figure 12-5. 
The Local folder is usually the one you want. It contains the icons of all the shared Macs, Windows, and Unix 
machines on your limb of the office network. 
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Pre-Mac OS X Macs
If your network includes a Mac that's running Mac OS 8.5 through 9.2, setting it up for file sharing 
follows almost the same steps as outlined above—but the locations of the controls are different. 
Here's a summary: 
Setting up user accounts. Use the Users & Groups tab of the File Sharing control panel. 
Naming the computer. Use the File Sharing control panel.
Clicking Start. You do this in the File Sharing control panel, as well. But there's one additional step: 
Turn on the checkbox called "Enable File Sharing clients to connect over TCP/IP," if you have it 
(shown at the very bottom of Figure 12-4). 
This TCP/IP option is available in Mac OS 9 and later. If one of your networked Macs runs Mac OS 
8.5 or 8.6, you'll have to compensate for its absence by taking an extra step. On each Mac OS X 
machine, reopen System Preferences. Click Network, double-click the kind of network connection you 
have from the pop-up menu (like Ethernet or AirPort), click the AppleTalk tab, turn on "Make 
AppleTalk active," and then click Apply Now. (The reason: All modern Macs communicate using the 
TCP/IP language, just like the Internet. Older Macs spoke only the proprietary AppleTalk protocol.) 
Without either TCP/IP or AppleTalk, you won't be able to access the files or folders on your older 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (4 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
computer from a Mac OS X machine. (You will, however, be able to go the other direction. In other 
words, you'll be able to access a Mac OS X machine on the network from your older machine.) 
You should be all set to access the shared disks and folders on your Mac OS X 8.5-9.2 machines 
while seated at your Mac OS X machines, just as described in this chapter. To go the other way, sit at 
the older Mac, choose 
Chooser and click AppleShare to see the other network Macs' icons. 
Double-click away. 
You may also see a Servers icon, which lets you know what your Mac's icon looks like on the network. (In 
companies big enough to employ professional network nerds, this is also where you'll find any servers they've set 
up for you.) 
If you see a MSHOME icon, that means Windows PCs are being shared on the network. And the WORKGROUP 
icon displays the icons of Macs for which you've turned on Windows Sharing in System Preferences. 
It's normal, by the way, for some Macs to show up in more than one of these folders. Mac OS X is just doing its 
best to "listen" for the presence of every possible networking protocol. 
Top: When you click Network in the Sidebar, you'll see the names of individual 
computers in the leftmost column. On bigger networks, you may see folder icons that 
represent Apple- Talk zones, Windows workgroups, or other Mac OS X machines. 
Column view, shown here, gives you the best sense of how you got where you are. Click 
Local, click the name of the Mac you want, click Connect. (Don't be freaked out by the 
appearance of your own Mac's name. That's all normal.) 
Middle: Specify your password, or if one isn't required, leave the password box blank. 
Click Connect. 
Bottom: At long last, you're in. The other Mac's shared contents appear in the Finder 
window just as though it's another disk.

12.2 File Sharing
If you're a network nerd, you may be interested to note that Mac OS X 10.3 can also "see" servers that 
use the SMB/CIFS, NFS, FTP, and WebDAV protocols running on Mac OS X Server, AppleShare, 
UNIX, Linux, Novell NetWare, Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP servers. But the Sidebar 
method described here reveals only the shared computers on your subnet (your internal office network)
—not those on the Internet. 
3.  Open Successive folders until you find the shared disk or folder you want. 
If you open the Local folder, you may see either the names of individual shared Macs, or the names of AppleTalk 
zones (clusters of machines, as found in big companies and universities). In any case, keep clicking until you see 
the machine you're browsing for. 
If you're trying to tap into a Windows machine, open the icon representing the workgroup (computer cluster) that 
contains the machine you want. In small office networks, it's usually called MSHOME. (In big corporations, these 
workgroups can be called almost anything—as long as it's no more than twelve letters long with no punctuation. 
Thanks, Microsoft.) 
You can also access other Macs on your network directly from within the Open or 
Save dialog boxes described in Chapter 4. There, too, you'll find a Network icon in 
the Sidebar (expand the dialog box if necessary). Click it, and then continue with the 
steps outlined here. 
4.  Double-click the name of the computer you want to access. 
Now the "Connect to the file server" box appears (Figure 12-5, center). You're supposed to specify your account 
name and password, so that you can sign in and access your own files on that other Mac. 
You can even do this while somebody else is actually using the Mac in person. The Mac can process the work of 
many people simultaneously. In fact, you, Chris, and Robin can each log into Ellen's Mac from across the network, 
with each of you using your own files on that same machine, even while Ellen is using her own account! 
5.  Type your short user name (Figure 12-5, middle). 
Type precisely what you would use to log into the networked computer if you were sitting in front of it. 
If nobody has set up an account for you on that machine, on the other hand, all you can do is click the Guest button 
to gain some very limited access to what's on the other Mac. And if the Guest button is dimmed, then someone has 
turned off Guest access altogether. Now you're completely out of luck. 
(Not sure what your short user name is? To look it up, open System Preferences on your home-base Mac, click 
Accounts, and click your account name.) 
6.  Press Tab, and then type your password. 
If you work alone or with a small group of trusted people, and you've left your password blank, just skip the 
password box here.

12.2 File Sharing
7.  Click Connect, or press the Return or Enter key. 
Now a list of disks and folders on that Mac that have been shared for network access appears (Figure 12-5, 
bottom). You're free to open them and work with their contents exactly as though they were on your own Mac—with 
certain limitations, which are described next. 
If you drag a shared folder onto the bottom half of the Sidebar (or highlight it and 
choose File
Add to Sidebar), you can bring it back to your screen later just by 
clicking its icon. 
You can even drag its icon into the Startup Items window described in Section 11.3.4. 
Now the disk will appear on your desktop automatically each time you log in—the 
most effortless arrangement of all. 
12.2.3 Connection Method B: Connect to Server
The Sidebar method of connecting to networked folders and disks is practically effortless. It involves nothing more than 
clicking your way through folders—a skill that, in theory, you already know. 
But the Sidebar method lacks some advantages of the older "Connect to Server" method of Mac OS X versions gone by. 
Here are some of the differences: 
G     When you use the Sidebar to access a disk or folder, the shared icon never actually shows up on your desktop. It's 
therefore hard to know when you're really connected to it. 
G     When you use the Sidebar, if somebody shuts down the Mac you're exploring via network, a message on your 
screen eventually appears to say, "The alias 'chris' could not be opened, because the original item could not be 
found"—not exactly a crystal-clear explanation of what's gone wrong. 
In Panther, connecting to networked disks is both easier and harder. The Sidebar 
method is quick and easy, but it doesn't let you connect to certain kinds of disks. The 
Connect to Server method entails plodding through several dialog boxes and doesn't let 
you browse for shared disks, but it can find just about every kind of networked disk. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (8 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
 
G     The Sidebar method doesn't let you type in a disk's network address. As a result, you can't access any shared disk 
on the Internet (an FTP site, for example), or indeed anywhere beyond your local subnet (that is, your own small 
network). 
G     Except as noted in Figure 12-5, the Sidebar method doesn't offer an "Add to Keychain" option (Section 12.4.1.2) 
that makes the Mac memorize your password for a certain disk so you don't have to type it in every darned time 
you connect. 
Fortunately, the pre-Panther method of summoning shared disks and folders is still alive and well. When you choose 
Go
Connect To Server, you get the dialog box shown in Figure 12-6. The idea is that you can type in the address of the 
shared disk you want. 
For example, from here, you can connect to:
G     Everyday Macs on your network. If you know the IP address of the Mac you're trying to access—you geek!—you 
can type nothing but its IP address into the box and then hit Connect. 
And if the other Mac runs Mac OS X 10.2 or later, you can just type its Rendezvous name: afp://upstairs-PowerMac.
local/. 
To find out your Mac's IP address or Rendezvous address, open the Sharing panel of 
System Preferences. There, at the bottom, you'll see a message like this: "Other 
Macintosh users can access your computer at afp://192.168.1.24." That's your IP 
address. (Technically, though, you don't even need the afp:// part—only the number.) 
To see your Rendezvous address, click the Edit button at the top of the System 
Preferences pane.

12.2 File Sharing
After you enter your account password and choose the shared disk or folder you want, its icon appears on your 
desktop and in the Sidebar's disk list (Figure 12-7, bottom). As a bonus, the corresponding window opens 
automatically. 
The next time you open the Connect To dialog box, Mac OS X will remember that address, as a courtesy to you, 
and show it pre-entered in the Address field. 
G     Macs across the Internet. If your Mac has a permanent (static) IP address, the computer itself can be a server, to 
which you can connect from anywhere in the world via the Internet. Details on this procedure begin in Section 21.3.
G     An iDisk. An iDisk is a file server, too (Section 18.9.2). The easiest way to bring your iDisk icon to the screen is to 
choose Go
Disk
My iDisk. But what if you're not using your own Mac? What if you're visiting a friend, and 
you want to bring your iDisk to his screen? 
In that case, you could type afp://idisk.mac.com into the Connect to Server dialog box. When you click Connect, the 
Mac asks for your iDisk name and password. Type them in, and after a moment, your iDisk's icon pops up on the 
desktop. 
G     Windows machines. Find out the PC's IP address or computer name, and then use this format for the address: 
smb://192.168.1.34 or smb://Expensive-Dell. 
After a moment, you're asked to enter your Windows account name and password, and then to choose the name of 
the shared folder you want. When you click OK, the shared folder appears on your desktop as an icon, ready to 
use. (More on sharing with Windows PCs later in this chapter.) 
If you know the name of the shared folder, you can add that after a slash, like this: 
smb://192.168.4.23/ sharedstuff. You save yourself one dialog box. 
G     NFS servers. If you're on a network with Unix machines, you can tap into one of their shared directories using this 
address format: nfs://Machine-Name/pathname, where Machine-Name is the computer's name or IP address, and 
pathname is the folder path ( Section 1.2.2) to the shared item you want. 
G     FTP servers. Mac OS X 10.3 makes it simple to bring FTP servers onto your screen, too. (These are the drives, 
out there on the Internet, that store the files used by Web sites.) 
In the Connect to Server dialog box, type the FTP address of the server you want, like this: ftp://www.apple.com (or 
whatever the address is). If the site's administrators have permitted anonymous access—the equivalent of a Guest 
account—that's all there is to it. A Finder window pops open, revealing the FTP site's contents. 
If you need a password for the FTP site, however, what you type into the Connect to Server dialog box should 
incorporate the account name you've been given, like this: ftp://yourname@www.apple.com. You'll be asked for 
your password. 
You can even eliminate that password-dialog box step by using this address format: 
ftp://yourname: yourpassword@www.apple.com. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (10 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
Once you type it and press Return, the FTP server appears as a disk icon on your desktop (and in the Sidebar). Its 
window opens automatically, its contents ready to open or copy from. (You can't delete things or add things when 
you connect this way, however. If that's your intention, see Section 21.2.1.) 
G     WebDAV server. This special kind of Web-based shared disk requires an address format of its own, like this: http://
Computer-Name/pathname. (Technically, the iDisk is a WebDAV server—but as you know, Mac OS X offers far 
user-friendlier ways to get at it.) 
In each case, once you click OK, you may be asked for your name and password. You're then offered a useful Options 
button (see Figure 12-7). 
Nor is that the only timesaving feature built into the Connect to Server box (Figure 12-6): 
G     Once you've typed a disk's address into the box, you can click the + button to add that server to the list of server 
favorites. The next time you want to connect, you can open the shared disk just by double-clicking its name. 
G     The clock-icon pop-up menu lists Recent Servers—computers you've accessed recently over the network. If you 
choose one of them from this pop-up menu, you can skip having to type in an address manually. 
Top: When you access another networked computer using the Connect to Server command, 
this dialog box asks for your name and password. Don't miss the Options button. 
Middle: Clicking Options opens this useful box. The Add Password to Keychain button means 
that you won't have to type your password later (see "The Keychain," later in this chapter). If 
you click Change Password as you connect to another computer, you'll be given the 
opportunity to change your account password on that machine. A clear text password is one 
that isn't encrypted—a less secure, but more compatible, method of transmitting your 
password over the network. 
Bottom: When you connect to a server using this method, its icon shows up in the Sidebar, so 
it's easy to eject—something that you don't get when you connect by clicking the Network icon 
in the Sidebar.

12.2 File Sharing
 
Here's a handy side effect of using the Connect to Server command: It displays each 
connected disk as an icon in your Sidebar, even within the Open or Save dialog boxes of 
your programs. You don't have to burrow through the Sidebar's Network icon to open files 
from them, or save files onto them.

12.2 File Sharing
12.2.4 What You Can Do Once You're In
When you tap into a Mac OS 9 machine over the network, you're allowed complete freedom. You can trash, rename, move, 
or otherwise wreak havoc with the files and folders you find there. 
But when you tap into a Mac OS X machine, you can access only what's in certain designated folders. Which folders are 
available depends on whether you're a guest, a normal user, or an administrator (see the previous chapter). 
12.2.5 If You're a Guest
If you're just a guest—somebody for whom an account hasn't already been set up—you won't see the usual assortment of 
shared disks and folders (see Figure 12-8). 
At this point, all you can do is this:
G     Put things into anyone's Drop Box folder. (Open the account holder's folder to see the Drop Box folder.) You can 
copy files into a Drop Box, but you can't open it. Yes, Mac OS X is very secure, but even a high-security prison has 
a mailbox. 
If you connect as a guest, there's not much to see. Top: At first, you see only the names 
of account holders on the Mac you're tapping into (Bob, Chris, Robin, and so on). 
Bottom: You can deposit files into the Drop Box folder of any account holder, but not 
into the window that holds it—the little slashed-pencil icon in the lower-left corner tells 
you that it's off-limits. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (13 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
 
G     Open anything that people have put into their Public folders. (If you don't see any Public folders, then nobody has 
put anything into them for you to see.) Figure 12-9 has the details. 
The rest of the Mac is invisible and off-limits to you.
Suppose that Chris put three files into her Public folder. (Every person's Home folder contains 
a Public folder.) When you connect to her Mac, you'll see whatever she put there plus her Drop 
Box. You can't put anything in Chris's window (except in the Drop Box), but you can open the 
three files she's left there for you to see.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (14 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
 
12.2.6 If You're a Standard Account Holder
If you have a Standard account, you'll enjoy Drop Box access, Public-folder access, and the ability to see and manipulate 
what's inside your own Home folder. You can do anything you like with the files and folders you find there, just as though 
you're actually seated in front of that Mac. 
All other disks and folders on the Mac, including the System and Application folders, are invisible to you. 
NOTE
Once you've connected to a Mac using your account (or indeed, any account), the other Mac assumes that it 
has a lock on your identity. You'll be able to connect to the other Mac over and over again, without ever 
having to retype your password. 
On the other hand, if you try to connect to a different person's Home folder, you'll be treated as a guest; you 
won't even be offered the chance to type in that person's password. After all, you can't very well be two 
people at once, can you? (Insert favorite Jim Carrey joke here.) 
The only way to wipe the other Mac's memory clean is to log out and log back in again. You're once again 
asked for your password when you try to connect to the other Mac. 
12.2.7 If You're an Administrator
If you're an administrator, you get to see icons for the account-holder folders and the hard drive itself to which you're 
connecting. In fact, you even get to see the names of any other disks connected to that Mac. 
If you, O lucky administrator, open the hard drive, you'll discover that you not only have the same freedoms as a Standard 
account holder (described above), but also the freedom to see and manipulate the contents of these folders: 
G     Applications 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (15 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
G     Desktop folder
G     Library (and the System
Library folder, but nothing else in the System folder)
G     Users
Shared folder (Section 11.5.3)
G     The other disks connected to the Mac OS X machine
Why aren't Standard and Administrator account holders allowed to see what's in the System folder? Because Mac OS X is 
extremely protective of its System folder. To make Mac OS X remain as solid and stable as the day you installed it, human 
beings are not allowed to play with it, whether they're visiting over the network or not. 
Standard and Administrator account holders aren't allowed to see what's in other users' Home folders, either. (When you're 
connected via the network, you can't use the Get Info trick described in Section 12.2.10 to seize control of other people's 
folders.) 
NOTE
There's actually one more kind of account, of course, as described in the previous chapter—the root user. 
Whoever holds this account has complete freedom to move or delete any file or folder anywhere, including 
critical system files that could disable your Mac. Section 11.8 has details.
12.2.8 Disconnecting Yourself
When you're finished using a shared disk or folder, you can remove it from your screen just as you would any disk (Section 
10.1.2). The easiest method is to click the Eject icon next to its name in the Sidebar. 
12.2.9 Disconnecting Others
In Mac OS X, there's no visual clue to alert you that other people on the network are accessing your Mac. 
Maybe that's because there's nothing to worry about. You certainly have nothing to fear from a security standpoint, since, 
as you'll recall, people from across the network are allowed to access only their own folders. Nor will you experience much 
computer slowdown as you work (another traditional drawback of having people access your hard drive from across the 
network), thanks to Mac OS X's prodigious multitasking features. 
This dialog box asks you how much notice you want to give your co-workers that they're about 
to be disconnected—10 minutes to finish up, for example. If you're feeling rushed or rude, type 
a zero; you'll cut off that person instantly, without warning. Then click OK. (When you 
disconnect people by closing your laptop lid or having a system crash, your co-workers get a 
message that says, "The server has unexpectedly shut down.") 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (16 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
 
Still, if you're feeling particularly antisocial, you can slam shut the door to your Mac just by turning off the File Sharing 
feature. (Click System Preferences on the Dock, click the Sharing icon, and turn off the Personal File Sharing or Windows 
Sharing checkbox.) 
If anybody is, in fact, connected to your Mac at the time (from a Mac), you see the dialog box shown in Figure 12-10. If not, 
your Mac instantly becomes an island once again. 
12.2.10 Advanced Permissions Control
You may have noticed that Mac OS X adopts a fairly rigid scheme of permissions (access privileges). Most people on the 
network are allowed to see only their own folders (and what's in other people's Public folders) when they connect to a Mac 
OS X machine. 
But what if:
G     You want your co-workers to be able to access other folders? 
G     You'd rather not have your Public folder be quite that public? 
G     You work in a corporation where every machine has a full-time, high-speed connection to the Internet, which 
makes you worry even about that Drop Box? If some prankster figures out your Mac's IP address, it's conceivable 
that they could dump unsavory files into your Drop Box anonymously over the Internet (or keep dumping random 
files into it until your hard drive is full). 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (17 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Instant Network Messaging
As Figure 12-11 makes clear, turning off File Sharing gives you the opportunity to send a little 
message to everyone who is currently connected to your Mac via network. But you don't have to turn 
off File Sharing just to gain the opportunity to send little instant messages to your buddies. The dialog 
box shown in Figure 12-11 is suitable for warning your network buddies that the boss is coming, for 
example, or to request that they get you a beverage.
To do so, open System Preferences, click Sharing, and turn off the File Personal File Sharing 
checkbox. Type your message into the box that appears, and click OK. Your message pops up on the 
screens of everyone who's connected to you. 
Technically, you also just began the File Sharing shutdown process—now you should cancel that. 
After sending a message, you'll find that you're now staring straight at the Cancel button on the 
Sharing panel. Clicking it cancels the shutdown of File Sharing. (It also sends yet another message to 
your network comrades' screens, to the effect that File Sharing is no longer going to be cut off—a 
small price to pay for learning about the secret Mac OS X instant-messaging system.) 
Yes, of course, iChat is a far better instant-messaging system—but this cheapie one lets you send 
little messages even to Macs running systems before Mac OS X 10.2. 
G     You find it annoying that Standard account holders can't access the other disks attached to your Mac from across 
the network? 
Fortunately, Mac OS X's very restrictive folder-permission scheme is just a suggestion. It's perfectly possible to make 
individual folders either more protected or less protected, as you see fit—a bit technically hairy, but possible. 
In Mac OS X, you can even control how much access people have to an individual file—not 
just an entire folder. Keep that useful fact in mind as you read the following discussion. 
12.2.10.1 Changing access permissions for a file or folder
To begin, highlight a file or folder on your hard drive. Unless you're an administrator, it must be a file or folder that you own 
(because it's in your Home folder or because you've created it yourself). (Standard account holders are never allowed to 
mess with other people's folders.) 
Choose File
Get Info (or press 
 -I). When the Info dialog box appears, expand the Ownership & Permissions panel; 
then expand the Details section (see Figure 12-11). 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (18 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
You can also change the permissions for many folders at once. Just highlight all of them 
before choosing File
Get Info. 
Left: This window lets you establish who's allowed to see or use the contents of a particular 
folder or disk. 
Right: Using the pop-up menus, you can specify how much access you, the Owner, a selected 
group, and everyone else has. 
 
Now you see three pop-up menus: Owner, Group, and Others. (Each of the first two also offers an Access pop-up menu.) 
More on these designations in a moment. 
For now, note that the Owner Access, Group Access, and Others pop-up menus contain identical commands. They let you 
specify what you, the other people in your work group, and the entire network community can do with this document or 
folder: 
G     If you choose No Access, then you're a network tease—your co-workers may be able to see the folder, but its 
name and icon will be dimmed and unavailable. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-2.html (19 of 22)5/3/2004 5:02:11 AM

12.2 File Sharing
G     The Read only option lets visitors open the folder, open the files inside, or copy the files inside to their own hard 
drives; however, they can't put anything new into the folder, nor save changes to files they find there. Set up a 
folder like this as a distribution point for newsletters, standard logos, or other company information. Or turn this on 
for a document that you want people to be able to read but not edit. 
G     The Write only (Drop box) option is available only for folders. Turn it on if you want your network co-workers to be 
able to see the folder, but not open it. All they can do is copy files into it. (Your own Drop Box—which Mac OS X 
creates automatically in your Home
Public folder—works this way, too.) 
This option is great for setting up a place where people can put documents that are intended for your eyes only. 
Think students turning in homework, underlings turning in quarterly reports, and so on. 
G     Finally, choose Read & Write if you'd like your networked colleagues to have full access to the folder. They can do 
anything they want with the files inside, including trashing them. 
NOTE
Whenever you adjust the permissions for a folder like this, remember to take into account the permissions of 
the folder it's in (that is, its parent folder). No matter how exquisitely you set up a drop box folder, for 
example, nobody will even know it's there unless it's inside a folder for which you've turned on at least "Read 
only" access. 
But wait. Just when you thought this permissions business might be easy enough for you to grasp without that long-
postponed PhD in astrophysics, it gets more complicated. 
It turns out that you can assign these different levels of freedom to different subsets of people on your network. That's why 
there are three different categories of pop-up menu: 
G     Owner. That's you.
Of course, ordinarily, you have full access (Read & Write) to all of your folders. You can put anything into them, 
take anything out of them, and do whatever you like with them. But if you feel the need to protect yourself from your 
own destructive instincts, you can actually limit your own access to certain folders. For example, you can turn one 
into a drop box using this pop-up menu, as described below. 
If you're an administrator, in fact, you can do more than specify how much access you have. You can actually 
change the owner, so that somebody else has control over this icon. 
To make this change, click the padlock icon, and then choose a new owner from the Owner pop-up menu. 
This is an unbelievably sweeping power. It means that you can trod roughshod over everyone else's stuff, blowing 
away all of the usual Mac OS X account-security mechanisms. If you feel like trashing all the files of everyone else 
who uses this Mac, you can do it. You, after all, are Administrator, God of the Mac. (This, by the way, is a good 
argument for limiting the number of people who have Administrator accounts. Remember, they can do the same 
thing to you.) 
In any case, as soon as you choose a new owner from the pop-up menu, you'll be asked for your account 
password, just to prove that you're really an administrator. Type it, and then click OK. 
Now you can not only change who the owner is, but you can also use the Owner Access pop-up menu to specify 
how much access that person has to the selected file or folder.

G     Group. In most networking systems, you can put every person in your office into certain groups, such as 
Marketing, Accounting, or Temps. Mac OS X itself, however, offers no easy mechanism for setting up such groups. 
(There is a complicated way, however, which is described in Section 12.4).) 
But Mac OS X does come with a whole bunch of canned, prefab groups, to which it automatically assigns everyone 
on the network. If you're an administrator, for example, you belong to the admin group, among others; if you're a 
mere peon, a Standard account holder, you're part of the staff group. (The other group names here—dialer, guest, 
mail, and such—exist for the benefit of network administrators and for Mac OS X itself. Mac OS X 10.3 even 
creates a group named after each account holder—very tiny groups indeed.) 
If you have a Standard account, you can't change the Group pop-up menu. But using the Group Access pop-up 
menu, you can change how much access everyone in your group has to the file or folder. 
If you're an administrator, on the other hand, you can make a selected file or folder available to any other group 
(and then, by using the Access pop-up menu beneath it, specify that group's degree of access). Once again, you'll 
be asked to prove your worthiness by clicking the padlock icon and entering your administrator password. 
G     Others. So far, you've specified how much access the owner of this icon has, and how much access one favored 
group gets to it. But what about everyone else? 
They are the Others , of course. This pop-up menu specifies how much freedom everybody else in the network will 
have to the selected file or folder, including guests. Needless to say, if security is an issue where you work, you 
may not want to set the Everyone pop-up menu to permit full access. 
NOTE
You can't give "Everyone" more access to the folder than you gave the Group people—only the same degree 
of freedom, or less. For example, you can't give Read & Write access to a folder to Everyone, but give your 
own administrator group only Drop Box access. 
If you want the change to affect all the folders inside the selected disk or folder in the same way, click "Apply to enclosed 
items." In the confirmation box, click OK. 
In any case, just close the Info window when you're finished. You've just fooled around with some high-powered Unix mojo
—without even knowing it. 
This chapter describes the visual way to connect from across the network—a system of 
dialog boxes, menus, and nice clickable buttons. 
If you're willing to forego all of that Mac-like stuff, a second, highly regarded system of 
connecting to your Mac from across the network (or from across the Internet) awaits: a Unix 
program called SSH (Secure Shell). If you're still game, Section 21.4 offers the details.

12.2 File Sharing
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Rendezvous
Throughout this chapter, and throughout this book, you'll encounter rituals in which you're supposed to 
connect to another Mac, server, or printer by typing in its IP address (its unique network address). 
First of all, IP addresses are insanely difficult to memorize (192.179.244.3, anyone?). Second, networks 
shouldn't require them anyway. If a piece of equipment is on the network, it should announce its presence, 
rather than making you specifically call for it by name. 
Now you can appreciate the beauty of Rendezvous, an underlying Mac OS X networking technology that lets 
networked gadgets detect each other on the network automatically and recognize each other's capabilities. 
It's Rendezvous at work, for example, that makes other Macs' names show up in your iTunes program so that 
you can listen to their music from across the network (Section 10.3.4.1). Rendezvous is also responsible for 
filling up your buddy list in iChat automatically, without requiring you to know your buddies' screen names first 
(Section 20.2.3); for making shared Macs' names show up in the Sidebar's Network icon; and for making the 
names of modern laser printers from HP, Epson, or Lexmark appear like magic in the list of printers in the 
Print dialog box. 
And if you're lucky enough to have (a) a TiVo Series 2 video recorder for your television, (b) a home network 
that connects it with your Mac, and (c) TiVo's Home Networking Option, you already know that your Mac's 
name magically appears on the TiVo screen. This allows you to play your iTunes music, or put on a slide 
show of your iPhoto pictures, right on the TV. Once again, it's Rendezvous at work. 
But it's even more tantalizing to contemplate the future of Rendezvous. To quote www.zeroconf.org, whose 
underlying technology forms the basis of Rendezvous: 
"The long-term goal of Zeroconf is to enable the creation of entirely new kinds of networked products, 
products that today would simply not be commercially viable because of the inconvenience and support costs 
involved in setting up, configuring, and maintaining a network to allow them to operate." 
But that's just the beginning. If the electronics companies show interest (and some have already), you may 
someday be able to connect the TV, stereo, and DVD player with just a couple of Ethernet cables, instead of 
a rat's nest of audio and video cables. 
For most of us, that day can't come soon enough.

12.3 Networking with Windows
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
12.3 Networking with Windows
Microsoft Windows may dominate the corporate market, but there are Macs in the offices of America. Mac OS X represents 
a historic moment in Mac-Windows relations: It lets Macs and Windows PCs see each other on the network, with no special 
software (or talent) required. 
In fact, you can go in either direction: Your Mac can see shared folders on the Windows PCs, and a Windows PC can see 
shared folders on your Mac. The following pages take you through both situations. 
12.3.1 Seated at the Mac: Seeing the PC
Suppose you have a Windows XP machine on the network (although the same feature works in Windows Me, Windows 
2000, and other recent editions). Here's how you get the Mac and PC chatting: 
1.  On your Windows PC, share a folder. 
You have to specify which folders you want to make available on the network, if some administrator hasn't already 
done so. In Windows XP, for example, you right-click a folder, choose Properties from the shortcut menu, click the 
Sharing tab, and turn on "Share this folder on the network" (Figure 12-12, top). In the "Share name" box, type a 
name for the folder as it will appear on the network (no spaces are allowed). 
Top: To share a folder in Windows, right-click it, choose Properties, and turn on "Share 
this folder on the network." 
Bottom: Back in the safety of Mac OS X, click Network in the Sidebar, click your 
workgroup name (if necessary), click the name of the shared computer, and click 
Connect. (Those are the steps in column view. In other views, just double-click the name 
of the computer you want.)

12.3 Networking with Windows
 
NOTE
If you've never shared a folder on this PC before, you won't see the "Share this folder" option. In its 
place, you'll see a link that runs the Network Setup Wizard. Go ahead and run that, supplying a 
computer and workgroup name when prompted, and then restart the PC to turn on sharing. Then start 
over with step 1. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-3.html (2 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:16 AM

12.3 Networking with Windows
Repeat for any other folders you want to make available to your Mac.
2.  On the Mac, open any Finder window. Click Network in the Sidebar. 
The shared PCs may appear as individual computer names, or—if you've used Microsoft's Network Setup Assistant
—you may see only the icon of their workgroup (network cluster). Unless you (or a network administrator) changed 
it, the workgroup name is probably MSHOME or WORKGROUP. 
You can also access the shared PC via the Connect to Server command, as 
described in Section 12.2.3.
3.  If necessary, click LOCAL or the Windows workgroup name. 
Now the names of the individual PCs on the network appear on the right side of the window (Figure 12-12, bottom). 
4.  Double-click the name of the computer you want. 
The Authentication dialog box appears, as shown at top in Figure 12-13.
5.  Type your name and password, if necessary, and then click OK. 
If you have an account on the Windows PC, great—use that name and password. If the PC isn't in a corporation 
where somebody administers access to each machine, you may be able to leave the password field blank. 
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
When Your Workgroup Isn't WORKGROUP
When you first turn on Windows Sharing in Mac OS X, the Mac tries to show what a good sport it is by 
announcing that it's part of a Windows workgroup (network cluster). Unfortunately, it believes itself to 
be in the workgroup called WORKGROUP—while Windows PCs start out believing that they belong to 
a workgroup called MSHOME. 
This distinction isn't earth-shatteringly important. But if the Macs and PCs have the same workgroup 
names, connecting is easier; for example, your Mac is more likely to show up on the PC from across 
the network, and your LOCAL folder (in the Networking icon of the Sidebar) won't display both Macs 
and PCs. 
The easiest solution: Open the Directory Access program in your Applications
Utilities folder. 
Click the padlock, sign in as an administrator, and then double-click the SMB item in the list. 
In the resulting dialog box, type (or choose) the new name you want—MSHOME, or whatever 
matches the PC's workgroup name—and then click OK. Quit Directory Access and click LOCAL again. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-3.html (3 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:16 AM

12.3 Networking with Windows
This time, you should see Macs and PCs listed side-by-side, in glorious harmony. 
The SMB Mount dialog box now appears (Figure 12-13, bottom). Its pop-up menu lists the shares (that is, shared 
folders and disks) on the selected PC. 
6.  From the pop-up menu, choose the name of the shared folder that you want to bring to your desktop. Click 
OK. 
At long last, the contents of the shared folder on the Windows machine appear in your Finder window, just as 
though you'd tapped into another Mac. From here, it's a simple matter to drag files between the machines, open 
Word documents on the PC using Word for the Mac, and so on, exactly as though you're hooked into another Mac. 
Top: The PC wants to make sure that you're authorized to visit it. If the terminology here 
seems a bit geeky by Apple standards, no wonder—this is Microsoft Windows' lingo 
you're seeing, not Apple's. 
Bottom: Here, you see a list of shared folders on the PC. Choose the one you want to 
connect to, and then click OK. Like magic, the Windows folder shows up on your Mac 
screen, ready to use! 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-3.html (4 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:16 AM

12.3 Networking with Windows
 
12.3.2 Seated at the PC: Seeing the Mac
Actually, you can share files in both directions. Not only can your Mac see other PCs on the network, but they can see the 
Mac, too. 
Here's how you prepare the Mac for visitation from a PC: 
1.  On the Mac, open System Preferences. Click the Sharing icon. Turn on Windows Sharing (Figure 12-14, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-3.html (5 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:16 AM

12.3 Networking with Windows
top). 
If you haven't created an account for whoever will be tapping into your Mac (Chapter 11 ), this is your opportunity to 
do so. Otherwise, your Mac is ready for invasion. Quit System Preferences, if you like. 
Top: This magic checkbox in System Preferences makes it all possible. It's a system-
wide On switch for invasion from Windows. 
Lower left: Sign in, using the same name and password you'd use to log into your Mac 
(Chapter 11). 
Lower right: Here's your Mac's icon—in Windows! Open it up to find your Home folder, 
complete with all your stuff.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-3.html (6 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:16 AM

12.3 Networking with Windows
 
2.  On the Windows machine, open the My Network Places or Network Neighborhood icon (Figure 12-14, lower 
right). 
The goal here is to find your Mac's icon. If it shows up by itself (you may need to wait a minute or two), terrific; you 
must have sacrificed the proper animals to the Windows gods. 
If it doesn't appear, try each of these three approaches, in order of desperation:
First resort: Click "Microsoft Windows Network" in the task pane.
Second resort: Click "View workgroup computers" instead.
NOTE
The task pane is the blue panel at the left side of every Windows XP desktop window. If you don't see it, 
try widening the window. If you still don't see it, choose Tools
Folder Options and turn on "Show 
common tasks in folders." 
Last resort: If your Mac still doesn't show up, you'll have to add it the hard way. Click "Add a network place" in the 
task pane. On successive screens, click Next, click "Choose another network location," and then click Next. In the 
"Internet or network address" box, type \\192.168.1.24\chris (substitute your Mac's IP address and your short 
account name), taking care to use backslashes, not normal / slashes. 
Finally, click Next, type a name for your Mac on the network, click Next again, and click Finish.
In any case, when you do find your Mac on the network, its icon may bear a name like "Samba 2.2.3a (Robins-
computer)." No, Microsoft isn't trying to give you dance lessons. Samba is the Mac's version of the SMB file sharing 
protocol that Windows uses. 
In the future, you won't have to do so much burrowing, since it will appear automatically in the My Network Places 
window. 
3.  Double-click the icon's name, sign in (Figure 12-14, bottom left), and then go to town. 
In the final window, you see your actual Home folder—on a Windows PC! You're ready to open its files, copy them 
back and forth, or whatever. 
12.3.3 More Mac-Windows Connections

12.3 Networking with Windows
The direct Mac-to-Windows file-sharing feature of Mac OS X is by far the easiest way to access each other's files. But it's 
not the only way. Here are a few more possibilities (not including disks, flash drives, and other removable gadgets): 
G     Dave. Dave (www.thursby.com ) is a Mac/Windows file-sharing program that's more powerful, more flexible, and 
more complex than the procedure described in the previous pages. 
G     Web Serving. As described in Chapter 21, Mac OS X's Apache software turns your Mac into a living Web site. And 
the beauty of the Web, of course, is that it doesn't care what kind of computer you're using. The contents of the 
Web site are dished up exactly the same way to Macs, Windows machines, Unix machines, and so on. 
All of this provides a great way to distribute files to other people on the network —even people who are using less 
enlightened operating systems. You can simply list files for distribution on a simple Web page, to which other 
people on the network can connect. 
Chapter 21 offers the full details of setting up such a system—but in the context of making your Mac available to 
anyone on the Internet. The point to note here is that other people on your office network can access your Mac in 
exactly the same way, just by typing http://192.168.1.5/~chris/ (that is, your IP address followed by ~ and your short 
account name), into the address bar of their Web browsers. 
G     FTP. Think of an FTP server as something like a Web site designed specifically as a holding tank for files that you 
want to distribute or accept. Here again, though, it's worth remembering that you can use the Mac OS X built-in 
FTP server to distribute and accept files on your local network, not just over the Internet. The Windows PC user, 
using only a Web browser, will be able to download any files in the folder that you've set up for such transactions. 
Chapter 21 has complete details. (And using an FTP client program—the Windows equivalent of Fetch, for example
—that person can copy files to and from the folder.) 
G     Bluetooth. If your Mac and a PC each have Bluetooth adapters, you can share files between them as though 
there's no language barrier at all. 
Apple's Bluetooth adapter comes with a nondenominational file-exchange program called Bluetooth File Exchange; 
not all Windows Bluetooth adapters come with such a program. But if yours does (3Com's adapters do, for 
example), you should be able to shoot files between the machines with the greatest of ease—and no setup 
whatsoever. See Section 6.2.5.

12.4 Managing Groups
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
12.4 Managing Groups
As noted earlier in this chapter, the circuitry of Mac OS X's file-sharing software doesn't let you create and manipulate 
groups. As your networking setup becomes more complex, being able to work with subsets of the people on your network 
can be a great timesaver. 
For example, you might create groups called Marketing, Temps, and Executives. Later, you can permit an entire group of 
these people access to a particular file, folder, or disk in one fell swoop. (Groups are also the key to letting Standard 
account holders on your network see and access secondary drives on your Mac OS X computer.) 
Phase 1 involves creating and naming the groups you want. It requires NetInfo Manager, an advanced utility program that 
comes with Mac OS X. Phase 2 involves assigning those groups to individual disks, files, or folders on your system. The 
following pages walk you through both procedures. 
12.4.1 Creating Groups
To set up groups, start by opening NetInfo Manager, which is in your Applications
 Utilities folder. 
12.4.1.1 Defining and naming the group
Here's how you might go about creating a new group called Executives and then adding the names of three employees to 
it. (These steps assume that you've already created accounts for these people, as described in Chapter 11.) 
1.  In NetInfo Manager, click the tiny padlock in the lower-left corner. 
A dialog box appears, prompting you for an administrator's name and password. The Mac is just checking to make 
sure that somebody with a clue is at the helm.
2.  Type the name and password of an administrator (Section 11.2). Click OK. 
NetInfo presents a staggering array of network-related variables (Figure 12-15). In the second column, you'll see 
that one of them is called groups. 
Consider yourself warned: NetInfo is an extremely technical program designed for 
network administrators with years of training and full employee benefits somewhere in 
corporate America. Not only do you need an administrator's account to play with it, but 
veering off the instructional path speci- fied in the following pages could, in theory, get 
your Mac in trouble.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-4.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 5:02:19 AM

12.4 Managing Groups
 
3.  Click groups. 
In the next column to the right, you'll see a list of all the canned groups that come installed with Mac OS X: admin, 
bin, daemon, kmem, and so on. These terms aren't especially closely related to English, but then again, Unix 
names were designed primarily for efficiency in typing. 
You're ready to add a new group to this list. The easiest way is to duplicate one of the existing groups. 
4.  Click admin in the list of groups, and then click the Duplicate button at the top of the window. Now click 
Duplicate in the confirmation message. 
You wind up with a new group in the list, called admin copy. Note that it's highlighted, and a few morsels of 
information about it appear at the bottom of the window. One of them—in the Property column—says name (see 
Figure 12-15). 
5.  Double-click admin copy. at the bottom of the window (in the Value(s) column). Type the new name for 
your group, as shown in Figure 12-15, and then press Enter. 
You've just created and named a new group. To help Mac OS X keep this one separate from the others, you'll also 
need to give it a new group ID number, abbreviated gid in Unix-ese. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-12-SECT-4.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 5:02:19 AM

12.4 Managing Groups
6.  If the gid value (in the third row at the bottom of the window) isn't already highlighted, double-click it. Then 
type 200 and press Enter. 
The ID number doesn't especially matter except that it can't be the same as any the other folders' group IDs. The 
existing ones are all under 100, so you should be in good shape. 
At the moment, your new group lists the names of all Administrator accounts (because you began this process by 
duplicating the admin group). Now you need to make sure that the right people belong to this group. 
12.4.1.2 Adding people to the new group
The adding-people-to-group process takes place in the bottom half of the window.
1.  At the bottom of the window, click the users row without expanding it. Choose Directory
Insert Value 
(or press Option-
-I). 
The users row now expands, revealing individual rows for each account holder who already belongs to this group. 
A new_value box waits for you to type in the name of somebody you've created an account for. (Sorry, efficiency 
fans, there's no simple pop-up list of the accounts on your Mac; NetInfo Manager assumes that you can remember 
the precise name and capitalization of every account.)
2.  Type the short account name (Section 11.3) of the person you want to add to this group, and then press 
Enter. 
If you want to add another person, choose Directory
Insert Value again, and then type in another name. (You 
can also delete someone from this group by highlighting the appropriate row and then choosing 
Directory
Delete Value.)
3.  When you're finished adding people, save your changes (Domain
Save Changes), and click "Update 
this copy" in the confirmation dialog box. 
Quit NetInfo Manager. 
At the moment, you've got yourself a properly defined group, but this information is just kicking around in Mac OS X's head 
without any practical value. The next step is to tell Mac OS X which folders are the private stomping grounds of this group. 
12.4.2 Assigning Groups
It's easy for an administrator to let a certain group have access to a certain file, folder, or disk. Just highlight the icon in 
question, choose File
Get Info, expand the Ownership & Permissions panel (Figure 12-11), expand the Details section, 
click the padlock icon, and use the Group pop-up menu to specify a group. (Type in your administrator's name and 
password again.)
Then use the Access pop-up menu below it to determine how much access this group should enjoy. (Use the Others pop-
up menu to specify how much access all other group members get.)

12.4 Managing Groups
You can do exactly the same thing using Terminal, Mac OS X's rabbit hole into the world of Unix commands. The average 
Macintosh fan will certainly consider this method insanely opaque, user-hostile, and counterintuitive. The average Unix fan 
will love it. You'll find an overview in Chapter 16.

12.5 Dialing In from the Road
If you're one of the several million lucky people who have full-time Internet connections—in other words, cable modem or 
DSL accounts—a special thrill awaits. You can connect to your Mac from anywhere in the world via the Internet. If you have 
a laptop, you don't need to worry when you discover you've left a critical file on your desktop Mac at home. 
Mac OS X offers several ways to connect to your Mac from a distant location, including file sharing over the Internet, virtual 
private networking, FTP, and SSH (secure shell). Chapter 21 has the details.

12.6 Forgettable Passwords: The Keychain
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
12.6 Forgettable Passwords: The Keychain
The information explosion of the computer age may translate into bargains, power, and efficiency, but it carries with it a 
colossal annoyance: the proliferation of passwords we have to memorize. Shared folders on the network, Web sites, your 
iDisk, FTP sites—each requires another password. 
Apple has done the world a mighty favor with its Keychain feature. The concept is brilliant: Whenever you log into Mac OS 
X and type in your password, you've typed the master code that tells the computer, "It's really me. I'm at my computer now." 
The Mac responds by automatically filling in every password blank you encounter in your networking exploits (and in your 
Web-surfing exploits too, if you use a Keychainsmart browser like Safari or OmniWeb). You can now safely forget all of the 
passwords required for accessing the various other Macs on your network. 
Because it's on all the time and memorizes most passwords automatically, the Keychain winds up being invisible for many 
people. Just go about your business, tapping into other computers on the network as described earlier in this chapter, 
connecting to your iDisk, and so on. Behind the scenes, the Mac quietly collects the various passwords so that you don't 
need to enter them again. 
12.6.1 Locking and Unlocking the Keychain
When your Keychain is unlocked, you can open your password-protected FTP sites, iDisk, network servers, and so on, 
without ever having to enter a password. Technically, you're supposed to enter a name and master password to "unlock" 
the Keychain every time you sit down in front of your Mac, thereby turning on this automaticpassword feature. But Apple 
figured, "Hey, you've already entered a name and master password—when you logged into the Mac. That's good enough 
for us."
If you work alone, the Keychain therefore becomes automatic, invisible, and generally wonderful.
But what if you work in an office where someone else might sit down at your Mac while you're getting a candy bar? Of 
course, Mac OS X 10.3 can now lock your Mac—Keychain and all—after a specified period of inactivity (Section 11.4.2). 
But if, for old times' sake, you want to lock the Keychain manually, you can use either of these methods. Each requires the 
Keychain Access program (in your Applications
Utilities folder): 
You can use this program to examine the passwords that Keychain Access is storing for you. 
(Click one of these rows to see more information about that password in the Attributes 
window.) The Access Control tab lets you specify which programs Mac OS X will supply with 
the selected password.

12.6 Forgettable Passwords: The Keychain
 
G     Lock the Keychain manually. Click the Lock button in the toolbar of the Keychain Access window (see Figure 12-
16).
G     Lock the Keychain automatically. In the Keychain Access program, choose Edit
Change Settings for 
Keychain [your name]. The resulting dialog box lets you set up the Keychain to lock itself, say, five minutes after 
the last time you used your Mac, or whenever the Mac goes to sleep. When you return to the Mac, you'll be asked 
to re-enter your account password in order to unlock the Keychain, restoring your automatic-password feature.
Either way, when the Keychain is locked, Mac OS X will no longer fill in your passwords. 
NOTE
As noted above, you unlock your Keychain using the same password you used to log into Mac OS X, but 
that's just a convenience. If you're really worried about security, you can choose Edit
Change Password 
for Keychain [your name], thereby establishing a different password for your Keychain, so that it no longer 
matches your login password. Of course, doing so also turns off the automatic-Keychain-unlocking-whenyou- 
log-in feature.

12.6 Forgettable Passwords: The Keychain
12.6.2 Managing Keychains
To take a look at your Keychain, open the Keychain Access program. By clicking one of the password rows, you get to see 
its attributes—name, kind, account, and so on (Figure 12-16). At this point, you can turn on "Show password" to see the 
actual password it's storing. 
The primary purpose of the Keychain is, of course, to type in passwords for you 
automatically. However, it's also an excellent place to record all kinds of private information 
just for your own reference: credit card numbers, ATM numbers, and so on. Just click the 
Access Control tab, then click the Add button. 
No, the Mac won't type them in for you automatically anywhere, but it does maintain them in 
one central location that is, itself, password-protected. 
12.6.3 Multiple Keychains
By choosing File
New Keychain, you can create more than one Keychain, each with its own master password. On one 
hand, this might defeat the simplicity goal of the Keychain. On the other hand, it's (faintly) conceivable that you might want 
to encrypt all of your business documents with one master password, and all of your personal stuff with another, for 
example. 
If you do have more than one keychain, click the Show Keychains toolbar icon to make a 
"drawer" listing all keychains slide out of the side of the main window. Click their names to 
switch among them. 
No, wait—there's an even better way. In Keychain Access, choose View
Show Status in 
Menu Bar. You've just added the Keychain menulet to your menu bar (a padlock icon), which 
makes it easy to switch keychains from within any program. 
12.6.4 Keychain Files
Keychains are represented by separate files in your Home folder
Library
Keychains folder. Knowing that can be 
handy when you want to delete a keychain or copy it to another Mac—your laptop, for example.

Chapter 13. Printing, Faxing, Fonts, and Graphics
The Macintosh may be only the five-percent solution in the mainstream business world, but in the graphics and printing 
industries, it's the 800-pound gorilla. You'd better believe that when Apple designed Mac OS X, it worked very hard to keep 
its graphics and printing fans happy.
This chapter tackles printing, faxing, fonts, graphics, and ColorSync. It also covers PDF (Acrobat) files, which Mac OS X 
uses as an everyday exchange format—one of the biggest perks in Mac OS X.

13.1 Mac Meets Printer
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.1 Mac Meets Printer
One of the biggest complaints about the original Mac OS X was that at the outset, not many printer companies had 
rewritten their printer drivers—the software that controls various printer models—for it. Fortunately, the situation has 
improved: Today's Mac OS X comes with hundreds of printer drivers from Epson, HP, Lexmark, Canon, and others.
The Panther installer described in Appendix A even offers you the strangely named but 
wonderful GIMP-Print, a package of high quality printer drivers for Mac OS X. These drivers 
give new life to hundreds of current and older Epson, Canon, HP, and Lexmark printers.
The beauty of Mac OS X is that setting up a printer for the first time is incredibly easy. The first time you want to print 
something, follow this guide:
1.  Connect the printer to the Mac, and then turn the printer on. 
Inkjet printers usually connect to your USB jack. Laser printers generally hook up to your Ethernet connector. (If 
you're on an office network, the laser printer may already be connected somewhere else on the network, saving 
you this step. If you're hooking the printer straight into your Mac's Ethernet jack, you may need an Ethernet 
crossover cable to connect it, rather than a standard Ethernet cable.)
NOTE
Most Ethernet- or network-connected laser printers communicate with your Mac using a language called 
AppleTalk. If you have such a printer, here is step 1.5: Open the Network pane of System Preferences; 
double-click your network connection (like Ethernet or AirPort); click the AppleTalk tab; turn on Make 
AppleTalk Active, and then click Apply Now. (If you omit this step, Printer Setup Utility will nag you 
about it in step 5.)
Top: If you've never before hooked up a printer to your Mac, Printer Setup Utility displays 
this message. (If you're trying to hook up an additional printer, on the other hand, click 
the Add toolbar button.) Middle: If you choose the right connection method from the pop-
up menu, your Mac should automatically "see" any printers that are hooked up and 
turned on. Click the one you want, and then click Add. (If you have some oddball printer 
whose driver doesn't come built into Mac OS X, a "Driver not installed" message 
appears. Find the driver, if it exists, on the printer's CD or Web site.)
Bottom: If you've set up more than one printer in this way, you'll see all of them listed in 
the Printer List. The one whose name appears in bold is the one currently selected—the 
one destined to produce your next printout.

13.1 Mac Meets Printer
 
2.  Open a document to be printed. Choose File
Print. In the Print dialog box (Figure 13-3), open the 
Printer pop-up menu. Choose Edit Printer List. 
A program called Printer Setup Utility opens automatically. (It was called Print Center in previous versions of Mac 
OS X.) You could also have opened it manually from your Applications
Utilities folder, or by opening the Print 
& Fax panel of System Preferences and clicking the Set Up Printers button.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-1.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 5:02:30 AM

13.1 Mac Meets Printer
If you haven't already set up a printer, you see the message at top in Figure 13-1.
3.  Click Add. 
Now a strange little window appears. If you have an inkjet printer that Mac OS X recognizes, its name may appear 
here. Skip to step 5.
If you work in a corporation where a highly paid network expert has already configured some network printers 
(using technical tools like NetInfo or LDAP databases), you'll see these printers listed here. Similarly, if you work on 
a network that's been equipped with one of the new Rendezvous printers (Section 12.2), they, too, appear here 
automatically. In either case, skip to step 5.
But if you find the Directory Services window empty, you need to tell Printer Setup Utility where to look to find its 
new printer.
4.  From the upper pop-up menu, choose the kind of printer you intend to use: USB, AppleTalk, or whatever 
(Figure 13-1, middle). 
In other words, tell Printer Setup Utility how the printer is connected to the Mac. For example, choose USB if you've 
connected an inkjet printer to your USB port. (You may see a brand-named version here, like Epson USB or HP 
USB; choose that, if it matches your printer brand.) Choose AppleTalk if you're connected to a laser printer via an 
Ethernet network cable or AirPort wireless network.
Most Mac fans are unfamiliar with LPR (Line Printer) printers, which live on corporate networks (and, therefore, 
connect to your Mac's Ethernet jack). If you and your company's network nerd determine that the printer you want 
to use is, in fact, an LPR printer, choose IP Printing from the pop-up menu and fill in the appropriate IP address 
and other settings, as directed by your cheerful network administrator.
NOTE
Panther introduces a new menu option here called Windows Printing. It means, "Hey, your Mac can 
send printouts to a Windows-only printer out there on your office network!" Just choose this option, click 
the name of the network group you're in, and then type an account name and password, if necessary.
After a moment, the names of any printers that are turned on appear in the printer list. For most people, that means 
just one printer—but one's enough.
5.  Click the name of the printer you want to use. 
As an optional step, you can open the Printer Model pop-up menu. Choose your printer's manufacturer (like HP or 
Canon), and then, in the list that appears, choose your printer's model name, if you can find it. That's how your Mac 
knows what printing features to offer: double-sided, legal size, second paper tray, whatever.
6.  Click Add. 
After a moment, you return to the main printer list window, where your printer now appears (Figure 13-1, bottom). 
You're ready to print.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-1.html (3 of 4)5/3/2004 5:02:30 AM

13.1 Mac Meets Printer
If you're lucky enough to own several printers, repeat the steps above for each one. Eventually, you'll have introduced the 
Mac to all the printers available to it, and all of their names will show up in the printer list.
Don't miss the Show Info button in the Printer Setup Utility's toolbar. Among other things, it 
lets you rename a printer. In a building where all the printers show up with such helpful 
names as 172.168.3.4 and 172.168.9.23, this feature can be extremely helpful.
And while you're poking around: If you choose Printers
Create Desktop Printer, you 
create, yes, a desktop icon for the selected printer. From now on, you can drag documents 
onto it to print them, or double-click it to check on the list of printouts-in-waiting.
Whenever you want to switch from one printer to the other, you can return to Printer Setup Utility and click the new printer's 
name. There's a much easier way, however: Use the Printer pop-up menu that appears in the Print dialog box (Figure 13-3).
The printer listed in bold denotes the default printer—the one that the Mac will use unless 
you explicitly choose a different one for a particular printout. To specify a different default 
printer, click its name in Printer Setup Utility and then click the Make Default button on the 
toolbar (or press 
-D).

13.2 Making the Printout
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.2 Making the Printout
You print documents from within the programs you used to create them, exactly as in other operating systems. The options 
for printing should feel distinctly familiar.
You know how Mac OS X comes with the necessary software for hundreds upon hundreds of 
printers? Unless you're in Oprah's tax bracket, you probably don't actually own that many 
printers—but their drivers are taking up nearly a gigabyte of hard drive space!
To clean out the ones you don't need, open your hard drive
Library
Printers folder. 
Throw away the folders for printer companies that didn't make your printer. (Administrator 
account required.)
13.2.1 Page Setup
The experience of printing depends on the printer you're using—laser printer, color inkjet, or whatever. In every case, 
however, all the printing options hide behind two commands: File
Page Setup, which you need to adjust only 
occasionally, and File
 Print, which you generally use every time you print. You'll find these two commands in almost 
every Macintosh program.
The pop-up menu at the top of the Page Setup dialog box offers a command called Summary, which displays a textual 
description of the document you're about to print (orientation, paper dimensions, and so on). It sometimes offers a 
command specific to the program you're using. For example, in Microsoft Word, the Settings
Microsoft Word command 
offers a screenful of custom page-size and margin settings.
The real action, though, is in the dialog box that appears when you choose Page Attributes from this pop-up menu (see 
Figure 13-2).
Here, in Page Setup, are the controls you need to print a document rotated sideways on the 
page, so that it prints "the long way." The Scale control, which lets you reduce or enlarge your 
document, can be handy if the program you're using doesn't offer such a control. And the 
Paper pop-up menu, of course, specifies the size of the paper you're printing on—US Letter, US 
Legal, or one of the standard European or Japanese paper sizes (A4 and B5).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-2.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 5:02:33 AM

13.2 Making the Printout
 
The remaining choices vary. The Page Setup options for an Epson inkjet, for example, differ dramatically from those for a 
laser printer. Only your printer's user manual can tell you exactly what these choices do.
You can (and must) configure the Page Setup settings independently in each program you 
use. And by the way: To change the default paper size for all new documents, open System 
Preferences, click Print & Fax, and use the "Default paper size" pop-up menu. (Mac fans in 
the UK: You're welcome.)
13.2.2 The Print Command
Although you can grow to a ripe old age without ever seeing the Page Setup dialog box, you can't miss the Print dialog box. 
It appears, like it or not, whenever you choose File
Print in one of your programs.
Once again, the options here depend on the printer. But here's what you may find on the box's main screen (when the pop-
up menu reads Copies & Pages):
G     Printer. One cool thing about Mac OS X is that if you have more than one printer connected to your Mac, you can 
indicate which you want to use for a particular printout just by choosing its name from this pop-up menu.
G     Presets. Here's a way to preserve—and call up again with one click—your favorite print settings. Once you've 
proceeded through this dialog box (specifying the number of copies, which printer trays you want the paper taken 
from, and so on), choose Save As from the pop-up menu shown in Figure 13-3, and then assign a name to your 
settings set (like "Borderless, 2 copies"). Thereafter, you'll be able to recreate that suite of settings just by choosing 
its name from this pop-up menu.
G     Copies. Type the number of copies you want printed. The Collated checkbox controls the printing order for the 
various pages. For example, if you print two copies of a three-page document, the Mac will generally print the 
pages in this order: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. If you turn off Collated, on the other hand, it'll print in this order: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-2.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 5:02:33 AM

13.2 Making the Printout
G     Pages. You don't have to print an entire document—you can print, say, only pages 2 through 15. Use commas and 
hyphens to spell out exactly the pages you want. For example, typing 1, 3-6, 9 will produce pages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 
9.
You don't have to type numbers into both the "From" and "to" boxes. If you leave the 
first box blank, the Mac assumes that you mean "from page 1." If you leave the 
second box blank, the Mac understands that you mean "to the end." To print only the 
first three pages, in other words, leave the first box blank, and type 3 into the second 
box. (These page numbers refer to the physical pages you're printing, not to any 
fancy numbering you've set up in your word processor. As far as the Print dialog box 
is concerned, the first printed page is page 1, even if you've told your word processor 
to label it Section 14.3.1.1.)
G     Preview. This button provides a print-preview function to almost every Mac OS X program on earth, which, in the 
course of your life, could save huge swaths of the Brazilian rain forest and a swimming pool's worth of ink in 
wasted printouts.
Technically, the Preview button sends your printout to Preview. As described in Section 9.18, Preview lets you 
zoom in or zoom out, rotate, or otherwise process your preview. When you're satisfied with how it looks, you can 
either print it (File
 Print), cancel it (File
Close), or turn it into a PDF file (File
Save as PDF). (Another 
means to this end is described next.)
G     Save As PDF. Clicking this delightful button, of course, turns your document into a PDF file instead of printing it. 
PDF means an Adobe Acrobat document—a file that any Mac, Windows, Linux, or Unix user can view, read, and 
print using either Preview (Mac OS X 10.3) or the free Acrobat Reader (included with every PC and earlier Mac 
operating system). Much more on PDF files in Section 13.6.
G     Fax. Here, for the first time as a built-in Mac feature, is faxing! See Section 13.4.
If you examine the unnamed pop-up menu just below the Presets pop-up menu, you'll find dozens of additional options. 
They depend on your printer model and the program you're using at the moment, but here are some typical choices:
G     Layout. As shown in Figure 13-3, you can save paper and ink or toner cartridges by printing several miniature 
"pages" on a single sheet of paper.
G     Output Options. Turning on "Save as File," choosing PDF from the Format popup menu, and then clicking Print 
saves your document as a PDF file, exactly like the Save As PDF button described above. In Panther, in fact, you 
can even save the result as a pure PostScript file—a feature beloved by graphic artists who send their work to 
professional printing shops.
G     Scheduler. This option, new in Mac OS X 10.3, lets you specify when you want your document to print. If you're a 
freelancer, sitting at home with an inkjet on your desk, you might not immediately grasp why anyone wouldn't want 
their printouts right now. But try to print a 400-page catalog in a big office where other people on the network might 
resent you for tying up the laser printer all afternoon, and you'll get the idea.
The options included in this dialog box depend on the printer model you're using. 
Sometimes, as when printing on a laser printer, the pop-up menu at the top lets you 
switch among different screens full of choices.

13.2 Making the Printout
 
G     Paper Handling. Here's another handy Panther special: You can opt to print out your pages in reverse order so 
that they stack correctly, or you can print just odd or even pages so that you can run them through again for double-
sided printing.
G     ColorSync. Most color printers offer this panel, where you can adjust the color settings—a little more red, perhaps. 
This is also where you indicate whose color-matching system you want to use: Apple's ColorSync, your printer 
manufacturer's, or none at all.
G     Quality & Media (inkjet printers only). Here's where you specify the print quality you want, the kind of paper you're 
printing on, and so on. (The name of this panel varies by manufacturer.)
G     Error Handling. Using these controls, you can specify that you want a technical message to print out when the 
laser printer reports a PostScript error (when your document is too complex for the printer's memory, for example). 
Depending on your printer, you may also be able to specify what kind of notification you want to receive if your 
specified paper tray runs out of paper.
G     Paper Feed. If you chose the correct printer model (from the Printer Model popup menu shown at middle in Figure 
13-1), then this screen "knows about" your printer's various paper trays. Here's where you specify which pages you 
want to come from which paper tray. (By far the most popular use for this feature is printing the first page of a letter 
on company letterhead, and the following pages on blank paper from a second tray.)
G     [Program Name]. Whichever program you're using—Mail, Word, AppleWorks, or anything else—may offer its own 
special printing options on this screen.
G     Summary. This command summons a text summary of all your settings so far.
Here's one for the technically inclined. Open your Web browser and enter this address: 
http://127.0.0.1:631. You find yourself at a secret "front end" for CUPS (Common Unix 
Printing System), the underlying printing technology for Mac OS X 10.3—and one that lets 
your Mac communicate with a huge array of older printers that don't yet have Mac OS X 
drivers. Using this administration screen, you can print a test page, stop your printer in its 
tracks, manage your networked printers and print jobs, and more—a very slick trick indeed.

13.2.3 Printing
When all of your settings look good, click Print (or press Enter) to send your printout to the printer.
Tip: Background printing is turned on all the time in Mac OS X. In fact, you can't turn it off. As 
you may have realized by now, Mac OS X is the king of multitasking. It spends about as 
much attention thinking about printing as you do thinking about what to have for breakfast 
next Wednesday.

13.3 Managing Printouts
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.3 Managing Printouts
After you've used the Print command, you can either sit there until the paper emerges from the printer, or you can manage 
the printouts-in-waiting. That option is attractive primarily to people who do a lot of printing, have connections to a lot of 
printers, or share printers with many other people.
Start by opening Printer Setup Utility. In the list of printers, the Status column shows which printers are busy. Double-click a 
printer's name to see something like Figure 13-4; namely, the printouts that will soon be sliding out of your printer appear in 
a tidy list.
Here are some of the ways in which you can control these waiting printouts, which Apple collectively calls the print queue: 
G     Delete them. By clicking an icon, or 
-clicking several and then clicking the Delete toolbar button, you remove 
items from the list of waiting printouts. Now they won't print.
G     Pause them. By highlighting a printout and then clicking the Hold button, you pause that printout. It won't print out 
until you highlight it again and click the Resume button. This pausing business could be useful when, for example, 
you need time to check or refill the printer, or when you're just about to print your resignation as your boss drops by 
to offer you a promotion.
If you pause one printout, the others lined up behind it will continue to print.
G     Halt them all. You can stop all printouts from a specific printer by clicking the Stop Jobs button. (They resume 
when you click the button again, which now says Start Jobs.)
Waiting printouts appear in this Printer window. You can manipulate this window exactly as 
you would any Finder list view. For example, you can sort the list by clicking the column 
headings Name, Status, and so on; make the columns wider or narrower by dragging the 
column-heading dividers horizontally; or reverse the sorting order by clicking the column name 
a second time.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Scanning: The Opposite of Printing
Will my scanner work with Mac OS X? 
These days, the odds are pretty good.
For the first couple years A.M. (After Mac OS X), scanning was a sore spot for Mac fans. Precious few 
scanners worked with Mac OS X even a year after its release.
These days, Mac OS X recognizes almost any Epson scanner and any scanner that works with the so-called 
TWAIN scanning standard (which, if you can believe it, stands for Technology Without An Interesting Name). 
As noted in Chapter 9, you can use Mac OS X's Image Capture program to operate such scanners without 
even installing any software.
If you're hanging onto an older scanner model that predates these scanning standards, run, don't walk, to 
www.hamrick.com to download VueScan. It's a $60 shareware program that enables dozens of scanners to 
work with Mac OS X, including:
SCSI models including all SCSI scanners from Apple, Epson, Canon, HP, Microtek, UMAX, LinoType-Hell, 
Acer, and Agfa.
USB models including all scanners from Epson and many from Canon, HP, Microtek, Umax, and others.
FireWire models including all scanners from Epson, Microtek, UMAX, and LinoType-Hell.

You can't rearrange printouts by dragging them up or down in the queue lists, nor drag printouts between

13.4 Printer Sharing
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.4 Printer Sharing
USB printer sharing is for people (or offices) with multiple Macs connected to a network (Chapter 12), who'd rather not buy 
a separate printer for each machine. Instead, you connect the printer to one Mac, flip a couple of software switches, and 
then boom: The other Macs on the network can send their printouts to the printer without actually being attached to it—even 
wirelessly, if they're on an AirPort network.
To use a USB printer that's been shared elsewhere on the network, open the document you 
want to print and then choose File
Print. In the list of printers, you'll see a new item called 
Shared, which lists the printers that have been shared on the network. (Point to one without 
clicking to view the details rectangle shown here.)

Printing from Classic Programs
If you imagine Mac OS X as an intervening layer between the Classic programs (see Chapter 5) and 
Macintosh circuitry itself, you won't find it so surprising that printing documents from within Classic programs 
isn't, shall we say, one of the highlights of the Mac OS X experience.
Classic programs can't print to many older printers (those that use the so-called QuickDraw technology), 
including the ImageWriter, StyleWriter, and many in the Personal LaserWriter line. If you want to use these 
printers, you must restart in Mac OS 9, as described in Section 5.3 (if your Mac can, in fact, restart in Mac OS 
9).
Some USB inkjet printers work within Classic, and some don't. Most PostScript laser printers, fortunately, 
work fine.
In any case, you need to treat Classic as though it were a separate Macintosh. That is, even if you've already 
installed your printer's software under Mac OS X, you must reinstall it—the Mac OS 9 version, that is—while 
running Classic.
Setting up printer sharing is easy. On the Mac with the printer, open the Print & Fax panel of System Preferences. On the 
Printing tab, turn on "Share my printers with other computers." (The Printer Sharing checkbox in the Sharing panel of 
System Preferences is similar, except that it shares all printers that your Mac can see—not just USB printers attached 
directly to it. In offices, the result can be duplicate listings of networked laser printers.)
Then, to make a printout from across the network, see the instructions in Figure 13-5.

13.5 Faxing

13.5 Faxing
It only took 19 years for faxing to become a built-in Mac OS feature. Sure, some Macs came with add-on faxing software 
like FaxSTF, but the new faxing feature in Panther is Apple's first attempt at home-grown faxing software.
Using the Mac as a fax machine is a terrific idea, for a lot of reasons. It saves all kinds of money on paper and fax 
cartridges, and may even spare you the expense of buying a physical fax machine. Faxing from the Mac also eliminates the 
silly and costly ritual of printing out something just so that you can feed it into a fax machine. And because your fax 
originates directly from the heart of Mac OS X instead of being scanned by a crummy 200-dpi fax-machine scanner, it 
blesses your recipient with a great-looking document.
Here's the basic idea: When faxes come in, you can read them on the screen, opt to have them printed automatically, or 
even have them emailed to you so that you can get them wherever you are in the world. (Try that with a regular fax 
machine.) And sending a fax is even easier on a Mac than on a real fax machine: You just use the regular File
Print 
command, exactly like you're making a printout of the onscreen document.
There are only two downsides of using a Mac as a fax machine:
G     The Mac needs its own phone line. Otherwise, your Mac, answering each incoming call, will give friends and 
relatives a screaming earful when they try to call to express their love.
Of course, you can avoid that prerequisite by using your Mac exclusively for sending faxes, so that it doesn't 
answer the phone. Or if you need to receive the occasional fax, you could just turn on the fax-receiving feature only 
when somebody is about to send you a fax. Or you could buy an automated fax/voice splitter that sends voice lines 
to the phone and incoming faxes to the Mac.
But in general, the Mac-as-fax works best if it has its own line.
G     You can't fax from a book or magazine. The one big limitation of Mac-based faxing is that you can only transmit 
documents that are, in fact, on the computer. That pretty much rules out faxing notes scribbled on a legal pad, 
clippings from People magazine, and so on (unless you scan them in first).
13.5.1 Setting Up Faxing
Open System Preferences. Click Print & Fax. Click the Faxing tab.
If you intend to send faxes from the Mac, type in your return fax number. If you intend to receive faxes, turn on "Receive 
faxes on this computer." Then specify how you want to handle incoming faxes, as described in Figure 13-6.
When your Mac answers the fax line, there are three things it can do with the incoming fax: 
Option 1: Save it as a PDF file that you open with Preview. (The Mac proposes saving these 
files into the Users
 Shared
Shared Faxes folder, but you can set up a more convenient 
folder.) Option 2: Email it to you, so that you can get your fax even when you're not home (and 
so that you can forward the fax easily). Option 3: Print it out automatically just like a real fax 
machine.

13.5 Faxing
 
13.5.2 Sending a Fax
When you're ready to send a fax, type up the document you want to send. Choose File
Print. In the Print dialog box 
(Figure 13-3), click the Fax button.
The dialog box shown in Figure 13-7 appears. Here's what you're supposed to do now:
G     Specify the fax number. If you like, you can simply type the fax number into the To box, exactly the way it should 
be dialed: 1-212-553-2999, for example. You can even send a single fax to more than one number by separating 
each with a comma and a space.
If you fax the same people often, though, you're better off adding their names and numbers to the Address Book 
(Chapter 19). That way, you can start typing a name and letPanther auto-complete it for you—or click the little 
silhouette button to the right of the "To:" box and choose the recipient as shown in Figure 13-7, top.
NOTE
At this writing, the Address Book feature doesn't work when you're sending from Microsoft Word or 
Excel. You have to type in the fax number by hand.
G     Add a subject line. If you plan to send a cover sheet, you can type a fax title into the Subject box.
G     Set up the "printout." Most of the time, fiddling with the lower pop-up menu isn't relevant to sending a fax. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-5.html (2 of 6)5/3/2004 5:02:41 AM

13.5 Faxing
(ColorSync? On a black-and-white fax? Get real!) But the standard printing controls are here for your convenience. 
You can use the Scheduler pane to specify a time for your outgoing fax, the Layout pane to print more than one 
"page" per sheet, and so on.
G     Add a cover sheet. If you turn on "Cover page," you're allowed to type a little message into the box. Be careful, 
though! Your note must all be one long, run-in paragraph. Don't press the Return key, thinking that you're creating 
a new paragraph; Return actually triggers the Fax button, and you'll send your message before it's complete.
Clever Mac fans can work around this awkward situation by typing up the cover note 
in another program, complete with paragraph breaks, and then pasting it into the 
Cover Page box.
Top: This miniature version of the Address Book program is a "look, don't touch" 
scheme. You can choose someone's name here by doubleclicking, but you can't add a 
new person to the list. All phone numbers appear here, so look for those identified (in 
gray type) as fax numbers. (Chances are that the address book listing doesn't feature the 
"1-" long- distance prefix, which is why Apple gave you a separate Dialing Prefix box.) If 
you've built groups in your address book, you can send to everyone in a group at once. 
After you've double- clicked a fax number or group name, close the Address Book list.
Bottom: Fill in this dialog box in readiness to send a fax.

13.5 Faxing
 
G     Preview. This button opens your outgoing fax in Preview (Section 9.18), so you can see exactly what it will look 
like. (Don't miss the Soft Proof checkbox at the lower left. A better name for it would be, "Crummy preview," 
because it simulates the jagged, black-and-white look of an actual fax.)
Choosing File
Save As at this point is your only opportunity to keep a copy of the fax 
you're sending.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-5.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 5:02:41 AM

13.5 Faxing
When everything looks good, hit the Fax button. Although it may look like nothing is happening, check your Dock, where the 
icon of a secret program called Internal Modem has appeared. If you click it, you'll see a clone of the dialog box shown in 
Figure 13-4, indicating the progress of your fax. Here you can pause the faxing, delete it, or hold it exactly as you would a 
printout.
Otherwise, you don't get much feedback on the faxing process. You don't hear anything, see anything, or receive any notice 
that the fax was successful.
(If your fax was not successfully sent for some reason, the Internal Modem window will automatically reschedule the fax to 
go out in five minutes. If you can't wait, click the fax in the list and then click the Resume button.)
If you've set up a network, only one Mac has to be connected to a phone line. On that Mac, 
open System Preferences, click Sharing, and turn on Printer Sharing. From now on, other 
Macs on the network can send out faxes via the one that has a phone line! (They'll see the 
shared modem listed in the Fax dialog box.)
13.5.3 Receiving a Fax
A Mac that's been set up to answer calls does a very good impersonation of a fax machine. You don't even have to be 
logged in to get faxes (although the Mac does have to be turned on and not asleep).
When a fax call comes in, the Mac answers it after the number of rings you've specified. Then it treats the incoming fax 
image in the way you've specified in System Preferences —by sending it to your email program, printing it automatically, or 
just saving it as a PDF file in a folder that you've specified.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Beyond Mac OS X Fax
As you'll discover pretty quickly, Mac OS X's built-in faxing feature is bare-bones, to say the least. For 
example, there's no record of what you've sent or received, you can't design your own cover pages, and you 
don't get any indication that a sent fax was successful.
There are alternatives. The best-known Mac faxing program is the weirdly named FaxSTF, available for $90 
from www.smithmicro.com. In addition to Mac OS X's faxing features, it adds goodies like a central, Mail-like 
program for viewing sent, pending, and received faxes.
The shareware world is a good place to shop, too. For example, you can try Page-Sender, Cocoa eFax, or 
any of the other shareware faxing programs listed at www.versiontracker.com on the Mac OS X tab.)

13.5 Faxing
As of Mac OS X 10.3.2, faxing in general, and receiving faxes specifically, is still an iffy prospect. In many 
cases, for example, your Mac will answer incoming calls just fine; it just doesn't manage to download the fax 
itself.
People who upgrade from a previous copy of Mac OS X 10.2 seem to have the most problems; those who 
use the Archive & Install option (see Appendix A) seem to have the fewest; but just about everyone agrees 
that there's room for improvement.
When Apple solves the problems, you (and your Software Update program) will be the first to know.

13.6 PDF Files
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.6 PDF Files
Sooner or later, almost everyone with a personal computer encounters PDF (portable document format) files. Many a 
software manual, Read Me file, and downloadable "white paper" comes in this format. Until recently, you needed the free 
program called Acrobat Reader if you hoped to open or print these files. In fact, Windows users still do.
But PDF files are one of Mac OS X's common forms of currency. In fact, you can turn any document (in any program with a 
Print command) into a PDF file—a trick that once required the $250 program called Adobe Acrobat Distiller. (Maybe Apple 
should advertise: "Buy Acrobat for $250, get Mac OS X free—and $120 cash back!")
And why would you want to do so? What's the big deal about PDF in Mac OS X? Consider these advantages:
G     Other people see your layout. When you distribute PDF files to other people, they see precisely the same fonts, 
colors, page design, and other elements that you did in your original document. And here's the kicker: They get to 
see all of this even if they don't have the fonts or the software you used to create the document. (Contrast with the 
alternative: Sending somebody a Microsoft Word document, for example. If your correspondents don't have 
precisely the same fonts you have, then they'll see a screwy layout. And if they don't have Word or a program that 
can open Word files, they'll see nothing at all.)
G     It's universal. PDF files are very common in the Macintosh, Windows, Unix/Linux, and even Palm and PocketPC 
organizer worlds. When you create a PDF file, you can distribute it (by email, for example) without worrying about 
what kinds of computers your correspondents are using.
G     It has very high resolution. PDF files print at the maximum quality of any printer. A single PDF file prints great 
both on cheapo inkjets and on high-quality imagesetting gear at professional print shops. (You're looking at a PDF 
file right now, in fact, which was later printed at a publishing plant.)
G     You can search it. Although you may be tempted to think of a PDF file as something like a captured graphic of the 
original document, it has several key differences. Behind the scenes, its text is still text. Furthermore, you can 
search this text using a Find command—an especially handy feature when you work with electronic software 
manuals in PDF format.
13.6.1 Opening PDF Files
There's nothing to opening up a PDF file: Just double-click it. Either Preview or Acrobat Reader takes over from there, and 
opens the PDF file on your screen.
13.6.2 Creating PDF Files
Opening, schmopening—what's really exciting in Mac OS X is the ability to create your own PDF files. The easiest way is to 
click the Save As PDF button in the standard Print dialog box (Figure 13-3). When you click it, Mac OS X saves your 
printout-to-be to the disk instead of printing it.
NOTE
All right, that joke about a free copy of Acrobat is an exaggeration. Mac OS X alone creates screen-
optimized PDF files—compact, easy-to-email files that look good on the screen but don't have high enough 
resolution for professional printing. For high-end purposes and more optimization for specific uses (Web, 
fancy press machines, and so on), you still need a program like Adobe Acrobat.

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.7 Fonts—and Font Book
Over the years, Macintosh fonts have improved considerably. No longer must you pray to the printer gods that your 
beautiful flyer won't come out with jagged-looking type because you chose the wrong font type, one that doesn't have 
smooth edges.
Up through Mac OS 9, a family of typefaces called bitmapped fonts was still kicking around, a holdover from the jagged-
printing days of the original 1984 Macintosh. But Mac OS X can't even use such fonts. Only always-smooth font formats 
work in Mac OS X: namely, TrueType, PostScript Type 1, and OpenType. (OpenType is a font format developed by 
Microsoft and Adobe that's already common on Windows machines.)
In short, Mac OS X delivers type that is all smooth, all the time. Fonts always look smooth onscreen, no matter what the 
point size, and always look smooth in printouts, no matter what kind of printer you use.
Better yet, Mac OS X 10.3 introduces a new program just for installing, removing, inspecting, and organizing fonts. It's 
called Font Book, and it's in your Applications folder.
13.7.1 Where Fonts Live
If you're used to Mac OS 9 or Windows, one of the most confusing changes is that there is no longer one single Fonts 
folder for your computer. There are now five Fonts folders. The fonts you actually see listed in the Fonts menus and Font 
panels of your programs are combinations of these Fonts folders' contents. They include:
G     Your private fonts (your Home folder
Library
Fonts). This Fonts folder sits right inside your own Home 
folder. You're free to add your own custom fonts to this folder. Go wild—it's your font collection and yours alone. 
Nobody else who uses the Mac will be able to use these fonts, and will never even know that you have them.
G     Main font collection (Library
Fonts). This, for all intents and purposes, is the equivalent of the traditional 
Fonts folder. All fonts in this folder are available to everyone to use in every program. (As with most features that 
affect everybody who shares your Macintosh, however, only people with Administrator accounts are allowed to 
change the contents of this folder.)
G     Network fonts (Network
Library
Fonts). In certain corporations, a network administrator may have set 
up a central font collection on another computer on the network, to which your Mac and others can "subscribe." 
The beauty of this system, of course, is that everybody on the network will be able to rely on a consistent set of 
fonts. (In this case, the Network "folder" is represented by the Network icon in your Sidebar.)
G     Essential system fonts (System
Library
Fonts). This folder contains the fonts that the Mac itself needs: 
the typefaces you see in your menus, dialog boxes, icons, and so on. You can open this folder to see these font 
suitcases, but you can't do anything with them, such as opening, moving, or adding to them. Remember that, for 
stability reasons, the System folder is sealed under glass forever. Only the superuser (Section 11.8) can touch 
these files—and even that person would be foolish to do so.
G     Classic fonts (Mac OS 9 System Folder
Fonts). Mac OS X automatically notices and incorporates any fonts 
in the System Folder that you've designated for use by the Classic environment (Chapter 5). This folder is also, of 
course, the source of fonts that appear in the Font menus of your Classic programs.
With the exception of the essential system fonts, you'll find an icon representing each of these locations in your Font Book 
program, described next.
13.7.2 Font Book: Installing and Managing Fonts
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-7.html (1 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:48 AM

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
One of the biggest perks of Mac OS X is its preinstalled collection of over 50 greatlooking fonts—"over $1,000 worth," 
according to Apple, which licensed many of them from type companies. In short, fewer Mac users than ever will wind up 
buying and installing new fonts.
But when you do buy or download new fonts, you're in luck. There's no limit to the number of fonts you can install. 
Furthermore, installing them is simpler than ever, thanks to the new Font Book program.
13.7.2.1 Looking over your fonts
Right off the bat, Font Book is great for one enjoyable pursuit: looking at samples of each typeface. Expand the All Fonts 
triangle, click Computer (for example), click the first font name, and then press the down-arrow key. As you walk down the 
list, the rightmost panel shows you a sample of each font (Figure 13-8).
You can also open any font family's flippy triangle (or highlight its name and then press the right arrow) to see the font 
variations it includes: Italic, Bold, and so on.
When you first open Font Book, the actual text of the typeface preview (in the right panel) is 
pretty generic. Don't miss the Preview menu, though. It lets you substitute a full display of 
every character (choose Repertoire)—or, if you choose Custom, it lets you type your own 
text, as illustrated in Figure 13-8.
Each account holder can have a separate set of fonts; your set is represented by the User 
folder. You can drag fonts and font families between the various Fonts folders represented 
here; for example, from your User account folder to the Computer icon, making it available to 
all account holders.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-7.html (2 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:48 AM

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
 
13.7.2.2 Eliminating duplicates
Since your Mac accesses up to five folders containing fonts, you might wonder what happens in the case of conflicts. For 
example, suppose you have two slightly different fonts, both called Optima, which came from different type companies, and 
are housed in different Fonts folders on your system. Which font will you actually get when you use it in your documents?
The scheme is actually fairly simple: Mac OS X proceeds down the list of Fonts folders in the order shown above, beginning 
with your own home Fonts folder. It only acknowledges the existence of the first duplicated font it finds.
If you'd rather have more control, open Font Book. A bullet (·) next to a font's name is Font Book's charming way of trying to 
tell you that you've got copies of the same font in more than one of your five Fonts folders. You might have one version of 
Comic Sans in your own Home
Library
Fonts folder, for example, and another in your Mac's main Fonts folder.
Click the one that you want to keep and then choose Edit
Resolve Duplicates. Font Book turns off all other copies, and 
the bullet disappears.
13.7.2.3 Adding, removing, and hiding fonts
Here's what you can do with Font Book:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-7.html (3 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:48 AM

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
G     Install a font. When you double-click a font file's icon in the Finder, Font Book opens and presents the typeface for 
your inspection pleasure. If you like it, click Install Font. You've just installed it into your account's Fonts folder, so 
that it appears in the Font menus of all your programs. (If you'd rather install it so that it appears in all account 
holders' Fonts menus, see Figure 13-8.)
G     Remove a font. Removing a font from your machine is easy: Highlight it in the Font Book list and then press the 
Delete key. (You'll be asked to confirm the decision.) Before taking such a drastic and permanent step, however, 
keep in mind that you can simply disable (hide) the font instead. Read on.
G     Disable a font. When you disable a font, you're simply hiding it from your programs. You might want to turn off a 
font so that you can use a different version of it (bearing the same name but from a different type company, for 
example), make your Font menus shorter, or make programs like Microsoft Word start up faster. (You can always 
turn a disabled font back on if you ever need it again.)
To disable a font, just click it (or its family name; see Figure 13-8) and then click the Disable button beneath the list. 
Its name now appears gray, and the word Off appears next to it, making it absolutely clear what you've just done. 
(To turn the font on again, highlight its name and then click the Enable button.)
NOTE
When you install, remove, disable, or enable a font using Font Book, you'll see the changes in the Font 
menus and panels of your Cocoa programs immediately. You won't see the changes in open Carbon 
programs, however, until you quit and reopen them.
And when you use Font Book to manipulate fonts in Classic, not only must you quit your open Classic 
programs—you must actually restart Classic itself to see the changes in your Font menus.
13.7.2.4 Font collections
A collection, like the ones listed in the first Font Book column, is a canned set of fonts. Apple starts you off with collections 
called things like PDF (a set of standard fonts used in PDF files) and Web (fonts you're safe using on Web pages—that is, 
fonts that are very likely to be installed on the Macs or Windows PCs of your Web visitors).
But you can create collections called, for example, Headline or Sans Serif, organized by font type. Or you can create 
collections like Brochure or Movie Poster, organized by project. Then you can switch these groups of fonts on or off at will, 
just as though you'd bought a program like Suitcase.
To create a new collection, click the leftmost + button to create a new entry in the Collections column, whose name you can 
edit. Then click one of the font storage locations—User, Computer, or Classic Mac OS—and drag fonts or font families onto 
your newly created collection icon. (Recognize this process from playlists in iTunes, or albums in iPhoto?) Each font can be 
in as many different collections as you want. When you're finished, click Done.
To remove a font from the collection, click its name and then press Delete. You're not actually removing the font from your 
Mac, of course—only from the collection.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-7.html (4 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:48 AM

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
Each time you create a new font collection, Mac OS X records its name and contents in a 
little file in your Home folder
Library
FontCollections folder.
By copying these files into the Shared folder (see Section 11.5.2), you can make them 
available to anyone who uses the Mac. If your sister, for example, copies one of these files 
from there into her own Home folder
 Library
FontCollections folder, she'll see the 
name of your collection in her own Font panel. This way, she can reap the benefits of the 
effort and care you put into its creation.
13.7.3 The Font panel
As noted in Chapter 4, some existing Mac programs have simply been touched up—Carbonized, in the lingo—to be Mac 
OS X-compatible. Choosing fonts in these programs works exactly as it always has on the Mac: You choose a typeface 
name from the Font menu or a formatting palette.
Things get much more interesting when you use Cocoa programs (Section 4.8), like TextEdit and Mail. They offer a new, 
standard Mac OS X feature called the Font panel. If you're seated in front of your Mac OS X machine now, fire up TextEdit 
and follow along.
The Font panel, generally available only in Cocoa programs, offers elaborate controls over text 
color, shadow, and underline styles. It also contains some of the genetic material of old-style 
programs like Suitcase and Font Juggler. See the handy font sample shown here above the font 
lists? To get it, choose Show Preview from the Action pop-up menu. Or use the mousy way: 
Place your cursor just above the headings (Collections, Family, and so on) and drag downward.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-7.html (5 of 8)5/3/2004 5:02:48 AM

13.7 Fonts-and Font Book
 
13.7.3.1 Choosing fonts from the Font panel
Suppose you've just highlighted a headline in TextEdit, and now you want to choose an appropriate typeface for it.
In TextEdit, open the Font panel (Figure 13-9) by choosing Format
Font
Show Fonts (
-T). If you've ever used 
Font Book, this display should look distinctly familiar. The first column lists your Collections, as described above. The 
second column, Family, shows the names of the actual fonts in your system. The third, Typeface, shows the various style 
variations—Bold, Italic, Condensed, and so on—available in that type family. (Oblique and Italic are roughly the same thing; 
so are Bold and Black.)
The last column lists a sampling of point sizes. To select one, you can use the size slider, choose from the point-size pop-
up menu, or type any number into the box at the top of the Size list.
13.7.3.2 Designing collections and favorites
At the bottom of the Font panel is a small gear-shaped pop-up menu just like the Action menu in Finder windows. It offers a

tools Apple provides to manage unwieldy font collections. To designate a font as one of your favorites, specify a 
font, style, and size by clicking in the appropriate columns of the Font panel. Then use this command.
From now on, whenever you click Favorites in the Collections column, you'll see a list of the typefaces you've 
specified.
G     Show Preview. The Font panel is great and all that, but you may have noticed that, at least at first, it doesn't 
actually show you the fonts you're working with—something of an oversight in a window designed to help you find 
your fonts. See Figure 13-9 for details. (Choose this command again—now called Hide Preview—to get rid of this 
preview.)
Once you've opened the Preview pane, feel free to click the different sizes, typeface 
names, and family names to view the various effects.
G     Hide Effects. The "toolbar" of the Font panel lets you create special text effects—colors, shadows, and so on—as 
shown in Figure 13-9. This command hides that row of pop-up buttons.
G     Color. Opens the Color Picker (Section 4.10), so that you can specify a color for the highlighted text in your 
document.
G     Characters. Opens the Character Palette (Section 8.14.2), so that you can choose a symbol without having to 
remember the crazy keyboard combo that triggers it.
G     Typography. Opens the new Typography palette (see Figure 13-10).
G     Edit Sizes. The point sizes listed in the Font panel are just suggestions. You can actually type in any point size you 
want. By choosing this command, in fact, you can edit this list so that the sizes you use most often are only a click 
away.
G     Manage Fonts. Opens Font Book, described earlier in this chapter.
The new Typography palette is a collapsible menagerie of fancy type effects, which vary by 
font. Each option is a master on/off switch for your entire document. In this example, turning on 
Common Ligatures creates fused letter pairs like fl and fi; the Mathematical options create true 
multiplication and division symbols; and the lowercase option affects all text you've already 
typed.

13.8 Font Fuzziness on the Screen

13.8 Font Fuzziness on the Screen
As noted earlier in this chapter, printed type generated by Mac OS X always looks smooth and terrific, at all sizes and on 
any printer.
On the screen, however, some people describe the type in Mac OS X as remarkably smooth, while others describe it as 
fuzzy. There's a lot of confusion regarding Mac OS X's jaggies-eliminating technology, which is technically called 
antialiasing. 
Mac OS X's success in enhancing screen type depends primarily on the size of the type. If you find that very small type is 
too fuzzy for comfort, open System Preferences, click the Appearance icon, and choose a higher number from the "Turn off 
text smoothing for font sizes __ and smaller" pop-up menu. The setting you assign here affects type in every program, 
including the Finder.
You can also change the style of this font smoothing; see Section 4.5 for details and illustrations.
You can't make Mac OS X apply antialiasing to 8-point type or smaller—at least not without 
the help of TinkerTool, which you can download from the "Missing CD" page at www.
missingmanuals.com .

13.9 ColorSync
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.9 ColorSync
As you may have read elsewhere in this book—or discovered through painful experience —computers aren't great with 
color. Each device you use to create and print digital images "sees" color a little bit differently, which explains why the deep 
amber captured by your scanner may be rendered as chalky brown on your monitor, yet come out as a fiery orange on your 
Epson inkjet printer. Since every gadget defines and renders color in its own way, colors are often inconsistent as a print 
job moves from design to proof to press.
ColorSync attempts to sort out this mess, serving as a translator between all the different pieces of hardware in your 
workflow. For this to work, each device (scanner, monitor, printer, digital camera, copier, proofer, and so on) has to be 
calibrated with a unique ColorSync profile—a file that tells your Mac exactly how your particular monitor (or scanner, or 
printer, or digital camera) defines colors. Armed with the knowledge contained in the profiles, the ColorSync software can 
make on-the-fly color corrections, compensating for the various quirks of the different devices, and even the different kinds 
of paper they print on.
Most of the people who lose sleep over color fidelity are those who do commercial color scanning and printing, where "off " 
colors are a big deal. After all, a customer might return a product after discovering, for example, that the actual product 
color doesn't match the photo on a company's Web site.
13.9.1 Getting ColorSync Profiles
ColorSync profiles for most Apple color printers, scanners, and monitors come built into Mac OS X. When you buy 
equipment or software from, say, Kodak, Agfa, or Pantone, you may get additional profiles. If your equipment didn't come 
with a ColorSync profile, visit Profile Central ( www.chromix.com ), where hundreds of modelspeci fic profiles are available 
for downloading. Put new profiles into the Library
 ColorSync
Profiles folder.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
AppleScript and ColorSync
Using AppleScript, described in Chapter 7, you can harness ColorSync in elaborate ways. Just by dragging 
document icons onto AppleScript icons, for example, you can embed ColorSync profiles, modify the profiles 
already incorporated, remove profiles, review the profile information embedded in a graphic, and much more. 
Better yet, you don't even have to know AppleScript to perform these functions—just use the built-in 
AppleScripts that come with Mac OS X.
To find them, open the Library
ColorSync
Scripts folder. Unfortunately, there aren't any instructions 
for using these eighteen ready-made AppleScripts. Nonetheless, Apple's real hope is that these example 
scripts will give you a leg up on creating your own AppleScripts—that someday you, the print shop operator, 
will be able to automate your entire color processing routine using AppleScript and ColorSync.
13.9.2 Default Profiles
In professional graphics work, a ColorSync profile is often embedded right in the photo, making all of this automatic. Using

13.9 ColorSync
the ColorSync Utility program (in Applications
 Utilities), you can specify:
G     Which ColorSync profile each of your gadgets should use. Click the Devices tab, open the category for your 
device (scanner, camera, display, printer, or proofer), click the model you have, and use the Current Profile pop-up 
menu to assign a profile to it.
G     Which ColorSync profile to use when Mac OS X encounters an image that doesn't include one. Click the 
Preferences toolbar icon, and use the three pop-up menus (RGB Default, CMYK Default, Gray Default, which 
correspond to the three kinds of printing you may intend to do) to set up your fallback profiles.
In the Displays pane of System Preferences, you'll find a Color tab. Its Calibrate button is 
designed to create a profile for your particular monitor in your particular office lighting—all 
you have to do is answer a few fun questions onscreen and drag a few sliders.
13.9.3 More on ColorSync
If you ache to learn more about ColorSync, you won't find much in Mac OS X's Help system. Instead, search the Web. At 
www.apple.com/colorsync , for example, you'll find articles, tutorials, and—perhaps most important—a link to an email 
discussion group where you can pose questions and read other people's answers. Going to a site like www.google.com and 
searching for ColorSync is also a fruitful exercise.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
The Coolest Panther Feature?
Deep in the ColorSync Utility program beats one of the coolest new Panther features that nobody's ever 
discovered.
On the Profiles tab, you can click the name of a color-device profile and view a lab plot of its gamut (the colors 
it's capable of displaying). What you might not realize, however, is that this is a 3-D graph; you can drag its 
corners to spin it in space.
But that's not the cool part. The tiny triangle in the corner of the graph is a pop-up menu. If you choose "Hold 
for comparison" and then choose a different color profile, you'll see both lab plots superimposed, revealing the 
spectrum areas where they overlap—and the yawning gaps where they can't display the same colors.
You'll find out, among other things, that printers can't display nearly as many colors as your monitor can, and 
that inkjets are much better at depicting, say, cyan than green.
And while we're discussing features you might have missed: You can double-click a profile's name to view a 
dizzyingly complex scientific description of its elements.
Blue colorant tristumulus, anyone?

13.10 Graphics in Mac OS X
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
13.10 Graphics in Mac OS X
Now you're talking. If you want to see dilated pupils and sweaty palms, just say "graphics" to any Mac OS X junkie.
Yes, graphics is one of the big deals with Mac OS X, thanks to its sophisticated Quartz graphics-processing technology. 
Everywhere you look in Mac OS X, you'll find visual effects that would make any other operating system think about early 
retirement.
For example: Menus are slightly transparent, and when you release them, they fade away instead of snapping off; you can 
set Excel 3-D graphs to be slightly transparent, so that they don't block other bars in a 3-D graph; when you paste files into 
windows in icon view, their icons fade into view; when you open an especially long message in Mail, its text fades in from 
white; and, of course, when you switch accounts using Fast User Switching, your work environment slides off the screen as 
though it's pasted on the side of an animated cube.
All of these visual goodies owe their existence to Quartz (or its enhanced successor, Quartz Extreme, which is not available 
on older Macs).
13.10.1 Graphics Formats in Mac OS X
Mac OS X understands dozens of Mac and Windows graphics file formats. Better yet, its Preview program (Section 9.18) 
can open such graphics and then export them in a different format, making it an excellent file-conversion program.
You can confidently double-click graphics files—from a digital camera, scanner, or a Web download, for example—in any of 
these formats:
G     PICT files. For almost 20 years, the PICT file was the graphics format Mac fans were most familiar with. It was the 
graphics format used by the Macintosh Clipboard, and it was the format created by the Shift-
-3 keystroke (see 
the end of this chapter).
Unfortunately, no other kinds of computers could open these files, so PICT files gave conniptions to the equipment 
at printing shops. Mac OS X acknowledges the existence of PICT files, and can open them just fine; the Preview 
program can even export them. Otherwise, however, Mac OS X dramatically downplays the importance of PICT 
files, which will soon ride into the sunset.
G     TIFF files. The TIFF file format is a high-density bitmap—that is, the Mac has memorized the color of each tiny dot 
in the file. Trying to enlarge one is like enlarging a fax: Make it too big, and the image breaks down into visible dots.
Nonetheless, TIFF files are very popular in the printing industry—most of the graphics in this book, for example, 
were stored as TIFF files. They print beautifully, work nicely in page-layout programs, and are understood by both 
Macs and PCs.
G     JPEG files. This format is one of the most popular on the Web, particularly for photos or other high-quality, full-
color artwork.
What makes JPEG files ideal for online use is that they've been compressed (using a program like Photoshop). 
Just enough of the color data has been thrown out from the original file to make the image a quick download 
without noticeably impacting its quality.
G     GIF files. GIF stands for graphics interchange format. Today, GIF files are used almost exclusively on the Web, 
usually for solid-colored graphics like cartoons, headlines, and logos. (A GIF file can have a maximum of 256 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-10.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:02:55 AM

13.10 Graphics in Mac OS X
colors, which is not even close to the photorealism of, say, JPEG. That's what makes GIF files inappropriate for 
photographs.)
G     PNG files. As it turns out, one of the algorithms used by GIF files is, technically speaking, the property of a 
company called Unisys, which threatened to sue everybody who was creating GIF files. No problem, said the World 
Wide Web Consortium, we'll just come up with our own replacement—a file format that has no legal strings 
attached. What they created was PNG (for portable network graphics). You can save AppleWorks, Photoshop, and 
Preview documents in PNG format, and every modern Web browser understands it.
PNG files don't lose quality when compressed, as JPEG files do. On the other hand, PNG files don't accommodate 
animation, as GIF files do. And when it comes to photos, they don't offer as impressive a size/quality balance as 
JPEG.
G     PDF (Acrobat) files. You can read all about these files in Section 13.6. As noted there, Mac OS X traffics 
effortlessly in PDF files, meaning that you can distribute documents you create to almost anyone, confident that 
they'll be able to open and print your stuff regardless of what kind of computer, fonts, and programs they have.
G     Photoshop files. If you're a graphic designer or Webmeister, this one is kind of neat: Mac OS X can open (and 
Preview can even export) actual Photoshop files. Among other advantages, the fact that Mac OS X can open and 
display these files means that you could use a Photoshop masterpiece, complete with layers and transparency, as 
a Mac OS X desktop background.
G     BMP. You can think of this graphics format as the PICT files of the Windows world. It's nice that Mac OS X can 
open (and Preview can export) them, especially because you may occasionally find .bmp files on the Web or 
attached to email messages.
G     Silicon Graphics, MacPaint, Targ. Talk about obscure—you could go through your whole life without ever seeing 
a graphic in one of these formats. Silicon Graphics is, of course, the format created by Silicon Graphics computers. 
MacPaint is a black-and-white only, 8-x-10-inch maximum, ancient Macintosh graphics format that disappeared 
from the scene in about 1988. And Targ (Targa) is the file format once used by products from the Truevision 
Corporation.

13.11 Screen-Capture Keystrokes

13.11 Screen-Capture Keystrokes
If you're reading a chapter about printing and graphics, you may someday be interested in creating screenshots—printable 
illustrations of the Mac screen.
Screenshots are a staple of articles, tutorials, and books about the Mac (including this one). Mac OS X has a secret built-in 
feature that lets you make them—and includes some very cool convenience features.
Here's how to capture:
G     The whole screen. Press Shift-
-3 to create a picture file on your desktop, in PDF (Acrobat) format, that depicts 
the entire screen image. A satisfying camera-shutter sound tells you that you were successful.
Top: If you're interested in capturing only part of the screen, press Shift-
-4 to turn your 
cursor into a tiny + symbol. Now drag diagonally across the screen to capture only a 
rectangular chunk of it, as illustrated here. When you drag and release the mouse, you 
hear the camera-click sound, and the Picture 1 file appears on your desktop as usual.
Bottom: To capture just one dialog box, use the old Camera Cursor trick. That is, invoke 
Shift-
-4 and then tap the Space bar to produce the cursor shown here. Click the 
element you want to snip from its background. (Press the Space bar a second time to 
exit "snip one screen element" mode and return to "drag across an area" mode.) If you 
ever change your mind about taking any kind of screenshot, press 
-period or the Esc 
key.

13.11 Screen-Capture Keystrokes
 
The file is called Picture 1 or Picture 1.pdf. Each time you press Shift-
-3, you get another file, called Picture 2, 
Picture 3, and so on. You can open these files into Preview, AppleWorks, or another graphics program, in 
readiness for editing or printing.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-13-SECT-11.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 5:02:58 AM

13.11 Screen-Capture Keystrokes
G     One section of the screen. You can capture only a rectangular region of the screen by pressing Shift-
-4. See 
Figure 13-11 for the details.
G     One menu, window, icon (with its name), or dialog box. Once you've got your menu or window open onscreen, 
or the icon visible (even if it's on the Dock), press Shift-
-4. But instead of dragging diagonally, press the Space 
bar.
Now your cursor turns into a tiny camera (Figure 13-11, bottom). Move it so that the misty highlighting fills the 
window or menu you want to capture—and then click. The resulting Picture file snips the window or menu neatly 
from its background.
G     The Dock. That business of pressing Shift-
-4 and then the Space bar also lets you capture the Dock in one 
quick snip. Once you've got the camera cursor, just click any blank spot on the Dock (between icons).
If you hold down the Control key as you click or drag (using any of the techniques described 
above), you copy the screenshot to your clipboard, ready for pasting, rather than saving it as 
a new graphics file on your desktop.
As noted in Chapter 9, by the way, Mac OS X also offers another way to create screenshots: the Grab program, which 
offers a timer option that lets you set up the screen before it takes the shot. But if you're really serious about capturing 
screenshots, you should opt instead for SnapzPro X ( www.ambrosiasw.com ), which can capture virtually anything on the 
screen—even movies of onscreen procedures, along with your narration—and save it in your choice of graphics format.

Chapter 14. Sound, Movies, Speech, and Handwriting
For years, as other computer companies whipped themselves into a frenzy trying to market one multimedia computer or 
another, Mac fans just smiled. Macs have been capable of displaying sound and graphics—no add-on sound, graphics, or 
video boards required—from day one, years before the word multimedia was even coined.
The Mac's superiority at handling sound and video continues in Mac OS X. Quick- Time, for example, is software that lets 
you play digital movies on your screen and watch live "streaming" broadcasts from the Internet. This chapter covers both 
creative pursuits: creating and using sound, and playing and editing movies.
As a bonus, this chapter also covers Mac OS X's speech features (how to command your Mac by voice, as well as making 
your Mac talk back) and even Ink, Mac OS X's bizarre little handwriting-recognition system.

14.1 Playing Sounds
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
14.1 Playing Sounds
You can have a lot of fun with digital sounds—if you know where to flnd them, where to put them, and how to edit them. 
You can play almost any kind of digitized sound flles, even MP3 flles, right in the Finder—if you put its window into column 
view. But that's just the beginning.
14.1.1 Controlling the Volume
Adjusting the volume of your Mac's speakers couldn't be easier: Just add the speaker menulet to your menu bar, as 
directed in Figure 14-1. That illustration also shows the Sound panel of System Preferences, which offers another way to go 
about it.
Actually, all current Macs offer an even more direct way to control the speaker volume: 
speaker-control keys right on the keyboard. (The key next to them is the Mute button, which 
instantaneously cuts off all the Mac's sound—a wonderful feature when you flnd yourself 
trying to use the Mac surreptitiously in a library or church.)
The tiny speaker silhouette in the upper-right corner of your screen turns into a volume slider 
when you click it. To make this sound menulet appear, open the Sound pane of System 
Preferences and turn on "Show volume in menu bar" (bottom). (Of course, another way to 
adjust the overall speaker volume is to drag the "Output volume" slider in System Preferences.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-1.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 5:03:03 AM

14.1 Playing Sounds
 
The Output tab of this panel, by the way, is designed to let you adjust the left-toright balance of your stereo speakers, if you 
have them. The stereo speakers on most Macs that have them (iMac, PowerBooks) are already perfectly centered, so 
there's little need to adjust this slider unless you generally list to one side in your chair. (You may flnd additional controls 
here if you have extra audio gear—an iSub subwoofer system, for example.)
In the Audio MIDI Setup program (in Applications
Utilities), you can set up and conflgure 
much fancier speaker setups, including 5.1 and 6.1 surround-sound systems.
14.1.2 Alert Beeps and You
In Mac OS X, you don't hear error beeps much—the little quacks, beeps, or trumpet blasts that say, "You can't click here." 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-1.html (2 of 4)5/3/2004 5:03:03 AM

14.1 Playing Sounds
Dialog boxes very rarely commandeer your screen as they do in Mac OS 9 or Windows. These days, if you try to click 
outside the Print dialog box, you just switch into whichever window or program you clicked.
Nonetheless, you still hear error beeps occasionally. (Try typing letters into a dialog box where a program expects numbers, 
for example.)
14.1.2.1 Choosing an alert beep
To choose one that suits your own personal taste, open the Sound panel of System Preferences (Figure 14-1, bottom). The 
Sound Effects screen offers a canned choice of fourteen witty and interesting sound snippets for use as error beeps. Press 
the up and down arrow keys to "walk" through them, listening to each. The one that's highlighted when you close the 
window becomes the new error beep.
You can also drag the "Alert volume" slider to adjust the error beep volume relative to your Mac's overall speaker setting.
14.1.2.2 Adding new alert beeps
Mac OS X's error beeps are actually AIFF sound flles (see the box below). As with fonts, Mac OS X builds the list of error 
beeps that you see in the Sound panel of System Preferences from several folder sources:
G     System
Library
Sounds folder. This folder contains the basic Mac OS X set. Because it's in the System 
folder, it's off-limits to manipulation by us meddlesome human beings. You can't delete one of the original Mac OS 
X error beeps, nor add to this collection (unless you take the drastic step of logging in as the root account holder 
[Section 11.8] or restarting the computer in Mac OS 9).
G     Home folder
Library
Sounds folder. Fortunately, it's easy enough to add sounds for your own use—just 
add them to this folder.
G     Library
Sounds folder. If you, an administrator, want to make a sound flle available to all account holders (if, 
in fact, there's more than one) on your Mac, create a new Sounds folder in the main hard drive window's Library 
folder. Any sound flles you put there now appear in every account holder's list of alert sounds.
The sound flles you put into these folders must be in AIFF format, and their names must end with the extension .aiff or .aif.
UP TO SPEED
AIFF Files
The standard sound format in Mac OS X is the AIFF flle, a popular Mac/Windows/Internet sound format—
which, as a testimony to its potential for high quality, is also the standard sound-flle format for music CDs. 
(The abbreviation stands for audio interchange flle format.)
If you double-click an AIFF flle, it opens up in iTunes (described in Chapter 10), where you must press the 
Space bar to begin or end playback. You can also play it right in the Finder, of course, in the far right pane of 
a column view window.
The good news is that you can exchange these flles with both Mac and Windows fans, download them from 
Web sites with the comforting certainty that your Mac will be able to play them, and so on.

14.2 Recording Sound
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
14.2 Recording Sound
If you hope to record new sounds, you'll need a microphone. Your microphone situation depends on the kind of Mac you 
have:
G     iMac, eMac, PowerBook, white iBook. You have a built-in microphone, usually a tiny hole near the screen. This 
microphone couldn't be more convenient: it's always with you, and always turned on.
G     Original iBook, Cube, recent Power Macs. You can plug in an external USB microphone (the Apple Products 
Guide at www.guide.apple.com offers a list) or use an adapter (such as the iMic, www.grifflntechnology.com) that 
accommodates a standard microphone.
G     Older Power Macs. These models came with a gray, half-cone-shaped microphone called the PlainTalk 
microphone. You'll flnd a corresponding miniplug jack for it on the back. Note, however, that the PlainTalk mike's 
pin is slightly longer than a standard miniplug. Standard microphones don't work in a Mac without an adapter like 
the NE Mic from www.grifflntechnology.com 
No matter what model you have, an Apple iSight videoconferencing camera works great as a 
microphone.
Top: To summon the Record Voice controls, click the Audio button. If your microphone is 
correctly hooked up, the Record Voice button (indicated here by the cursor) is available. 
(Otherwise, it's dimmed.) Just beside the button is a live "VU" level meter. Test your setup by 
speaking into the microphone. If this meter twitches in response, you're ready to record.
Bottom: Your recording takes the form of a colored bar labeled Voice at the bottom of the 
screen. (Click the clock icon tab if you don't see it.)

14.2 Recording Sound
 
The Sound panel of System Preferences lets you choose which sound source you want the Mac to listen to. Click the Input 
tab, and then click the sound source you want: external USB microphone, external analog microphone (that is, something 
plugged into the microphone or Line In jacks of Macs that have them), built-in microphone, iSight, or whatever.
14.2.1 Making the Recording
Once you've got your microphone situation taken care of, you need to get your hands on some sound-recording software.
14.2.1.1 The iMovie method
Although you might never suspect it, Mac OS X comes with a basic recording program: it's iMovie, which lurks in your 
Applications folder.
In a new, arbitrarily named movie project, click the Audio button shown in Figure 14-2. Click the round, red Record Voice 
button and begin to speak. Click Stop to complete the recording.
Now a new stripe appears in the soundtrack, labeled Voice 01 like the one shown in Figure 14-2. Drag the playhead to the 
left—to the beginning of the new recording —and then press the Space bar to listen to your voice-over work. If the narration 
wasn't everything you hoped for, it's easy enough to record another take. Just click the stripe representing your recording 
and then press Delete to get rid of it. Then repeat the process.

14.2 Recording Sound
When you're satisfled with the recording, you can proceed in either of two ways:
G     The quick way. Save the project and quit iMovie. Inside the movie project folder, you'll flnd a folder called Media. 
Inside it, there's a flle called, for example, Voice 01. That's the sound flle you just made.
Add .aiff to its name, conflrming your decision when the Mac asks you, and then drag the flle into the appropriate 
Library
Sounds folder, as described on the previous page. (It's flne to create a Sounds folder if there isn't one 
already.) Delete the orphaned iMovie project folder.
G     The flexible way. Choose File
Export. In the resulting dialog box, choose To QuickTime from the upper pop-
up menu, and Expert Settings from the lower one. Then click Export. In the next dialog box, select "Sound to AIFF" 
from the Export pop-up menu. Make sure the flle name ends in .aiff, navigate to a Sounds folder, and click Save.
The advantages to this approach: First, you don't have to remove the sound flle from your iMovie project folder, so 
you won't have any problems if you try to open the project again later. Second, you can adjust the quality of the 
exported sound by clicking Options in the last dialog box (you could make the sound Mono, for example).
Either way, congratulations: You've just created a new alert sound!
14.2.1.2 The shareware method
If you're willing to spend a few dollars, you can buy a shareware program that puts iMovie, as a sound studio, to shame. 
Some of the most useful, economical, and powerful include Sound Studio for OS X ($35) and Amadeus II ($25). You can 
download trial versions of both programs from www.missingmanuals.com, among other places.
These programs make terriflc sound recorders. Better yet, they make great editors, too. If there's excess silence at one end 
of the clip, or a few too many "uhs" and "ums" in the middle, you can edit them out just by dragging through the appropriate 
section of the scrolling sound-wave map and pressing Delete.
These programs can open almost any kind of sound flles, including tracks from your music CDs, and convert them to any 
other kind of format, including MP3.

14.3 QuickTime Movies
A QuickTime movie is a video flle you can play from your hard drive, a CD-ROM, or the Internet. Like any movie, it flashes 
many individual frames (photos) per second before your eyes, while also playing a synchronized soundtrack.
14.3.1 QuickTime Player
Hundreds or even thousands of Mac OS X programs can open QuickTime movies, play them back, and sometimes even 
incorporate them into documents: Word, File- Maker, AppleWorks, PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, America Online, and even 
the Finder (Figure 14-3).
You don't need any special software to play QuickTime movies. Just view their Finder windows 
in column view. To preview a selected QuickTime movie, in miniature, click the Play triangle to 
play; click it again to pause. The two buttons on the right end are frameadvance buttons.
 
But the cornerstone of Mac OS X's movie-playback software is QuickTime Player, which sits in your Applications folder 
(and even comes factory installed on the Dock). It's designed not only to play movies, but also to show pictures, and to play 
sounds, in all kinds of formats.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (1 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
Like Preview, another basic Mac OS X utility program, QuickTime Player can open many 
graphics flles—such as JPEG, GIF, TIFF, PICT, and even native Photoshop documents. You 
can either drag these graphics flles onto the QuickTime Player icon, or—from within 
QuickTime Player—choose File
Open Movie in New Player.
14.3.1.1 Playing movies with QuickTime Player
You can open a movie flle by double-clicking it, dragging it onto the QuickTime Player icon, or launching QuickTime Player 
and then choosing File
Open Movie in New Player (
-O). As shown in Figure 14-4, a number of controls help you 
govern the movie's playback:
G     Audio level meters. This tiny graph dances to indicate the relative strength of various frequencies in the 
soundtrack, like the VU meters on a stereo. If you don't see any dancing going on while the movie plays, then 
you've opened a movie that doesn't have a soundtrack.
G     Q button. Click this peculiar, round button to summon "QuickTime TV"—icons of Web sites that provide video 
feeds, as described below.
G     Resize handle. Drag diagonally to make the window bigger or smaller.
Some of the controls shown here are available only in the Pro version of QuickTime Player. 
They appear as soon as you type in your registration code (which you get when you pay $30).
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (2 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
When you drag the resize handle, QuickTime Player strives to maintain the same aspect 
ratio (relative dimensions) of the original movie, so that you don't accidentally squish it. If you 
want to squish it, however—perhaps for the special effect of seeing your loved ones as they 
would look with different sets of horizontal and vertical genes—press Shift as you drag.
If you press Option while dragging, meanwhile, you'll discover that the movie frame grows or 
shrinks in sudden jumping factors of two—twice as big, four times as big, and so on. On 
slower Macs, keeping a movie at an even multiple of its original size in this way ensures 
smoother playback.
G     Scroll bar. Drag the black triangle to jump to a different spot in the movie.
You can also press the right and left arrow keys to step through the movie one frame at a 
time. If you press Option-right or -left arrow, you jump to the beginning or end of the movie. 
In the Pro version, Optionarrow also jumps to the beginning or ending of a selected stretch of 
the movie.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
QuickTime Player vs. QuickTime Player Pro
Every time I launch QuickTime Player, I get this stupid ad about upgrading to QuickTime Pro. How can I get 
rid of it? 
Easy one. Click Later, and then Quit QuickTime Player. Open System Preferences; click Date & Time. Reset 
your Mac to a date far beyond its obsolescence point—the year 2020, for example. (Turn off "Set Date & Time 
automatically" flrst, if it's on.) Close the window.
The next time QuickTime Player shows its ad (which it does only once a day), click the Later button for the 
very last time. Quit the program, reset your clock to the correct date, and enjoy the fact that you've played a 
little trick on the program's calendar-watching feature. You'll never see the ad again—at least not until 2020.
All of these shenanigans are only necessary, of course, if you've decided not to upgrade to QuickTime Player 
Pro, whose additional editing playback and exporting features are documented in this chapter.
For $30, Apple will sell you a password that turns your copy of QuickTime Player into something called 
QuickTime Player Pro. (To obtain this password, call 888-295-0648, or click the Upgrade Now button to go 
online to www.apple.com/quicktime/buy.)
To record your password, choose QuickTime Player
 Preferences
Registration. Your password gets 
stored in your Home folder
Library
Preferences folder, in a flle called QuickTime Preferences. 
(Remember that when you upgrade to a new Mac.)

14.3 QuickTime Movies
Once you've upgraded, you gain several immediate beneflts—not the least of which is the permanent 
disappearance of the "upgrade now" advertisement. Now QuickTime Player can edit your movies, as 
described later in this chapter. It can also import many more sound and graphics formats, and—via the 
File
Export command—convert sounds, movies, and graphics into other formats.
Nor is QuickTime Pro the only upgrade you can buy. For another $20, you can add the MPEG-2 Playback 
Component, which gives QuickTime Player the ability to open, play, and convert MPEG-2 flles (like the super-
high-quality flles found on a DVD).
 
G     Selection handles. These tiny black triangles appear only in the $30 Pro version. You use them to select, or 
highlight, stretches of footage.
G     Volume. If you like, you can make the soundtrack louder or softer by dragging this slider with your mouse or 
clicking in its "track." You may flnd it easier, however, to press the up or down arrow keys.
To mute the sound, click the little speaker icon, or press Option-down arrow. Press Option-up 
arrow to make the volume slider jump to full-blast position.
G     Counter. In "hours: minutes: seconds" format, this display shows how far your diamond cursor has moved into the 
movie.
If you have QuickTime Pro, the counter reveals the position of the selection handle you've most recently clicked (if 
any).
G     Rewind, Fast Forward. By clicking one of these buttons and keeping the mouse button pressed, you get to speed 
through your movie, backward and forward, respectively, complete with sound. This is a terriflc way to navigate 
your movie quickly, regardless of whether you're using QuickTime Player or QuickTime Player Pro.
G     Jump to Start, Jump to End. These buttons do exactly what they say: scroll to the beginning or end of your 
movie. In the Pro version, they can also jump to the beginning and ending of the selected portion of the movie (if 
any). All of this, in other words, is exactly the same as pressing the Option-left arrow or -right arrow keys.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
QuickTime Virtual Reality
If they live to be 100, most Mac users will probably never encounter a QuickTime VR movie. Yet this kind of 
"panorama movie" technology is built into every Mac.
The trick is flnding a Quick- Time VR movie; your safest bet is, as usual, the Web. (The best starting point is Apple's 
own QuickTime VR page, www.guide.apple.com)
When you open a Quick- Time VR movie, you might think at flrst that you've simply opened a still photo (there's no 
scroll bar, for example). The trick is to drag your cursor around inside the photo. Doing so rotates the "camera," 
enabling you to look around you in all directions.
Then try pressing the Shift key, to zoom in (move forward) as much as you like. If you go too far, the image 
becomes too grainy. Press the Control key to zoom out (move backward).
And if you really want to blow your mind, try one of the cubic VR movies posted on that Web page. It lets you rotate 
your view not just side to side, but also up to the sky and down to your feet.
Using the free and commercial tools listed on the Apple Web site (or several that aren't, including PanoTools), you 
can even make your own QuickTime VR movies—provided you've got a camera, a tripod, and a good deal of 
patience.

14.3 QuickTime Movies
Try minimizing a QuickTime Player window while a movie is playing. It shrinks to the Dock—
and keeps on playing. Do this enough times, and you'll know what it's like to be Steve Jobs 
on stage.
14.3.1.2 Hidden controls
Don't miss the Movie
Show Video Controls and Movie
Show Sound Controls commands. As shown in Figure 14-5, 
they let you flne-tune the video and audio you're experiencing.
Clicking the tiny, grayed-out grid to the right of the scroll bar is a quicker alternative to 
choosing Movie
 Show Audio Controls.
Click the word Brightness to summon the Contrast or Tint slider; drag your mouse across the 
vertical bars to adjust the picture accordingly. The Sound controls replace the scroll bar. When 
you're flnished adjusting the balance, bass, and treble, click the light gray grid at the right edge 
to bring the scroll bar back.
 
14.3.1.3 Fancy playback tricks
Nobody knows for sure what Apple was thinking when it created some of these additional features—exactly how often do 
you want your movie to play backward?—but here they are. Some of these features are available only in the unlocked Pro 
version of QuickTime Player, as indicated below.
G     Change the screen size. Using the Movie menu commands, such as Double Size and Fill Screen, you can 
enlarge or reduce the actual "movie screen" window. Making the window larger also makes the movie coarser, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (6 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
because QuickTime Player simply enlarges every dot that was present in the original. Still, when you want to show 
a movie to a group of people more than a few feet back from the screen, these larger sizes are perfectly effective.
G     Play more than one movie. You can open several movies at once and then run them simultaneously. (Of course, 
the more movies you try to play at once, the jerkier the playback gets.)
If you have Player Pro, you can use the Movie
Play All Movies command to begin 
playback of all open movies at the same instant.
G     Play the movie backward. You can play the movie backward—but not always smoothly—by pressing 
-left 
arrow, or by Shift-double-clicking the movie itself. (You must keep the Shift button pressed to make the backward 
playback continue.) There's no better way to listen for secret subliminal messages.
G     Loop the movie. When you choose Movie
Loop and then click Play, the movie repeats endlessly until you 
make it stop.
G     Play a selection (Pro only). When you choose Movie
Loop Back and Forth and then click Play, the movie 
plays to the end—and then plays backward, from end to beginning. It also repeats this cycle until you make it stop.
14.3.2 QuickTime TV (Internet Streaming)
QuickTime TV generated a few raised eyebrows when Steve Jobs announced it in 1998, but few Mac fans have even 
noticed it since. That's too bad: It's a clever feature that lets you watch "Internet slide shows," watch a couple of live TV 
stations, or listen to the radio—all as you work on your Mac, and all at no charge.
14.3.2.1 Streaming video from your browser
With ever-increasing frequency, modern Web sites advertise streaming video events, such as Steve Jobs keynote 
speeches and the occasional live rock concert. You'll flnd a note on a Web page, for example, that says, "Watch the live 
debate by clicking here on October 15 at 9:00 p.m. EST."
If you do so, you'll flnd yourself transported once again into QuickTime Player, which connects to the appropriate Internet 
"station" and plays the video in its window. (You can also choose File
Open URL in New Player from within QuickTime 
Player to type in the Web address.)
NOTE
You don't have much control when watching a live broadcast. You generally can't rewind, and you certainly 
can't fast-forward. You may be able to pause the broadcast, but when you un-pause, you wind up at the 
current broadcast moment—not where you stopped.
14.3.2.2 Streaming video in QuickTime Player
Fortunately, if you're eager to experience the early-technology thrill of watching live Internet video, you don't have to wait 
until you stumble onto a broadcast advertised on a Web page. Thanks to Apple's QuickTime TV initiative, a number of TV 
and radio broadcasts are going on at this very moment—24 hours a day. A list of them is built right into QuickTime Player.

To access these channels, click the little Q button. Channel icons replace the video image, as shown in Figure 14-6.
You can flnd a list of additional QuickTime TV channels at www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv 
14.3.2.3 Manipulating your Favorites
When you choose Favorites
Show Favorites, you see a list of items you've put there for quick access.
Although few people have any use for this feature, it's possible to add the icons of your own QuickTime movies to the 
Favorites panel—not QuickTime TV channels, but actual movies on your hard drive. To do so, you can use any of these 
methods:
A "pick of the day" is highlighted on the right side. At this point, you can click the featured ad 
to see the movie's Web page in your browser; click a category button to see individual movies; 
or click one of the More buttons. You'll go to an Apple Web page that lists many more music 
stations, educational clips, movie or game trailers, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (8 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
 
G     Drag the icon of a QuickTime movie, picture flle, or sound clipping directly off of your desktop and into QuickTime 
Player's Favorites window.
G     Open a movie, picture, or sound, and then choose Favorites
Add Movie As Favorite.
You can also reorganize the locations of the Favorites icons just by dragging them up or down in the list. To delete one of 
your favorites, just click its name and then press Delete (and click Delete in the conflrmation box).
14.3.3 QuickTime Player Pro
If you've spent the $30 to upgrade your free copy of QuickTime Player to the Pro version, you've unlocked a number of 
useful features. For example:
G     Your Movie menu contains additional playback options, such as those described in "Fancy playback tricks" in 
Section 14.3.1.1.
G     When you flnd a QuickTime movie on a Web page, you can usually save it to your hard drive. (Click the movie; 
hold down the mouse button until a pop-up menu appears; choose Save Movie to Disk, or the equivalent in your 
browser.)
G     Using the commands in the Edit menu, you can view, turn on and off, add, or delete the individual tracks in a 
particular movie. (Most movies have nothing but a video track and a soundtrack. But a few specialized movies may 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (9 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
also contain a text track, an animation track, alternate soundtracks, and so on.)
G     The Movie
Full Screen (
 -F) command is the best possible way to view a Quick- Time movie on your 
screen. When you use this command, QuickTime Player blacks out the screen and devotes most of the Mac's 
processing power to playing the movie smoothly. (To interrupt the movie, press Esc or 
-period.) Just remember 
that although Full Screen is terriflc when you want to play a movie for a large group of people, an enlarged 
QuickTime movie is also a jerkier and grainier one.
By far the most powerful feature you gain in the Pro version, however, is its ability to edit QuickTime movies. You can 
rearrange scenes, eliminate others, and save the result as a new movie with its own name.
14.3.3.1 Selecting footage
Before you can cut, copy, or paste footage, QuickTime Player needs to provide a way for you to specify which footage you 
want to manipulate. Its solution: the two tiny black triangles that start out at the left end of the horizontal scroll bar, as 
shown in Figure 14-4. These are the "in" and "out" points; by dragging these triangles, you can isolate the scene you want 
to cut or copy.
You can gain more precise control over the selection procedure by clicking one of the black 
triangles and then pressing the right- or left-arrow key. Doing so expands or contracts the 
selected chunk of footage by one frame at a time.
You may also prefer to select a piece of footage by Shift-clicking the Play button. As long as 
you hold down the Shift key, you continue to select footage. When you release the Shift key, 
you stop the playback, and the selected passage appears in gray on the scroll bar.
Once you've highlighted a passage of footage, you can proceed as follows:
G     Jump to the beginning or end of the selected footage by pressing Option-right arrow or -left arrow key.
G     Deselect the footage by dragging the two triangles together again.
G     Play only the selected passage by choosing Movie
Play Selection Only (
 -T). (The other Movie menu 
commands, including Loop, apply only to the selection at this point.)
G     Drag the movie picture out of the Player window and onto the desktop, where the selected portion becomes a 
movie clipping that you can double-click to view.
G     Cut, copy, or clear the highlighted material using the commands in the Edit menu.
If you paste some text directly into QuickTime Player Pro, you get a two-frame title—like an 
opening credit—at the location of the scroll-bar playhead. (If you need it to be longer, paste it 
repeatedly.) QuickTime Player automatically uses the font, size, and style of the text that was 
in the text clipping. You can paste a graphic image, too, which gets you a two-frame "slide" of 
that still image.
If you flnd it easier, you can also drag a text or picture clipping flle directly from the desktop 
into the QuickTime Player window; once again, you get a two-frame insert.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (10 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
14.3.3.2 Pasting footage
After cutting or copying footage, you can move it elsewhere in the movie. Specify where you want the pasted material to go 
by clicking or dragging in the horizontal scroll bar so that the black triangle marks the spot; then choose Edit
Paste. 
The selection triangles (and their accompanying gray scroll bar section) appear to show you where the new footage has 
appeared. (That makes it easy for you to promptly choose Edit
Cut, for example, if you change your mind.)
But in QuickTime Player Pro, Cut and Paste are just the beginning of your options. For example:
G     If you choose Edit
Replace, any footage that's on your Clipboard now replaces the selected stretch of movie.
G     Edit
Trim eliminates the outer parts of the movie—the pieces that aren't selected. All that remains is the part 
you flrst highlighted.
QuickTime Player Pro has a little-known subtitling feature, complete with freedom of type style. 
Copy some formatted text from a word processor, highlight a slice of footage in QuickTime 
Player, and choose Edit
Add. The copied text appears as a subtitle on a black band, beneath 
the picture, as shown here.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-3.html (11 of 15)5/3/2004 5:03:12 AM

14.3 QuickTime Movies
G     Edit
Add adds whatever's on the Clipboard so that it plays simultaneously with the selected footage—a feature 
that's especially useful when you're adding a different kind of material to the movie (see Figure 14-7).
G     If you choose Edit
Add Scaled, whatever you're pasting gets stretched or compressed in time so that it flts the 
highlighted region, speeding up or slowing down both the audio and video. The effect can be powerful, comical, or 
just weird.
You can edit sounds exactly as you edit movies, using the same commands and shortcuts. 
Use the File
Open Movie in New Player command in QuickTime Player Pro to locate a 
sound flle to open. It opens exactly like a QuickTime movie, except with only a scroll bar, no 
picture.
14.3.3.3 Saving the flnished movie
After you've flnished working on your sound or movie, you can send it back out into the world in any of several ways. If you 
choose Edit
Save As, for example, you can specify a new name for your edited masterpiece. You must also choose 
one of these two options:
G     Save normally. The term "normally" in this case is a red herring. In fact, you'll almost never want to use this option, 
which produces a very tiny QuickTime flle that contains no footage at all. Instead, it's something like an alias of the 
movie that works only as long as the original, unedited movie remains on your hard drive. If you try to email the 
newly saved flle, your unhappy recipient won't see anything at all.
G     Make movie self-contained. This option produces a new QuickTime movie—the one you've just flnished editing. 
Although it consumes more disk space, it has none of the drawbacks of the "save normally" flle described above.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
All About Pixlet
If you were to open the pop-up menu at the top of the dialog box shown in Figure 14-8 (lower right), you'd see 
one of the new Panther features that Apple is most excited about: A new video codec (compressor-
decompressor) called Pixlet.
Now, Pixlet is not intended as a new way to compress, say, your iMovie masterpieces. Instead, it was 
designed for use by a professional fllm company—Pixar, to be exact. Film and TV editors want to be able to 
edit movies with perfect frame quality and perfect frame accuracy—without having to ship gargantuan, full-
resolution, multi-gigabyte flles across the network or across the country.
Pixlet is the answer. It compresses the original, fllm-resolution movie down to about a twentieth its original flle 
size, without introducing any artifacts (specks or blockiness).
Unlike other codecs, Pixlet doesn't compress video over time; that is, it doesn't memorize one key frame and 
then, for the following frames, store only the information for the pixels that have changed. Pixlet stores all of 
the color information for every single frame. (It achieves its compression solely by compressing the color 
information within each frame.) The point of all this is to permit editors to scrub back and forth through a 
scene, stepping frame by frame if they like, and viewing full, instantaneous, half-high-deflnition resolution at 
every step.

14.3 QuickTime Movies
14.3.3.4 Exporting the flnished work
Instead of using the File
Save As command, you can also use the File
Export command. The resulting dialog box 
offers two pop-up menus that can be very useful in tailoring your flnished work for speciflc purposes:
G     Export. Using this pop-up menu, you can convert your movie to AVI (Windows movie) format, DV Stream (for use 
as a clip in digital-video editing programs like iMovie and Final Cut), Image Sequence (a very large collection of 
individual still frames), and so on. This pop-up menu also lets you convert a sound you've been working on to AIFF, 
System 7, WAV (Windows), and other formats.
G     Use. This pop-up menu lets you establish your preferences for the export format you've just specifled above. For 
example, if you're exporting your movie as individual still frames, use this pop-up menu to specify the format for 
those individual still frames—BMP (Windows bitmap format), JPEG, and so on. If you're exporting your work as a 
QuickTime movie, you can specify how much QuickTime Player should compress it. (Compression makes a flle 
smaller, but decreases the video quality.) For example, if you intend to let people watch this movie over the 
Internet, you should use one of the Streaming options, which makes the movie extremely small and extremely 
cruddy-looking. If you plan to burn your movie onto a CDROM, use one of the "CD-ROM" options at the bottom of 
the pop-up menu.
If you're used to most moviemaking software, like iMovie or Final Cut, you may wonder where 
QuickTime Player hides its compression settings. They're here, in the Options dialog box (left) 
and the Settings boxes that spring from within it (right).
Hint: For smooth playback, use 15 frames per second or above (television playback is 30 fps); 
for best quality but small flle size, use the Sorenson 3 Video Compressor (or MPEG-4, if you're 
sure your audience has QuickTime 6 or later). For the smallest possible flle size—at more 
picture-quality sacriflce— use the H.263 compressor.

14.3.3.5 Compression and special effects
One of QuickTime Player's most powerful features is hidden in the Export dialog box, in a place where you might never flnd 
it. If none of the canned compression settings appeals to you, you can click the Options button. In the Settings dialog box 
that appears (see Figure 14-8), QuickTime Player Pro offers a staggering degree of control over the movie you're exporting. 
(The resulting dialog box varies according to the compression method you've selected.)
When exporting a movie as a QuickTime Movie, for example, here's where you can specify the compression format, the 
frames per second, and (by clicking Size) the dimensions of the flnished movie. As a bonus, you even get a Filter button 
that offers fourteen special video effects. They let you blur or sharpen your movie, adjust the brightness or contrast, flddle 
with the color balance, and so on.

14.3 QuickTime Movies
Similarly, when you're exporting a sound flle, the Options button lets you specify the sound quality you want, the 
compression method, and so on—all various ways of manipulating the trade-off between flle size and sound quality.

14.4 Speech Recognition

14.4 Speech Recognition
Although it may surprise many Mac users, the Mac is quite talented when it comes to speech. Its abilities fall into two 
categories: reading text aloud, using a synthesized voice; and taking commands from your voice.
The Apple marketing machine may have been working too hard when it called this feature "speech recognition"—the Mac 
OS feature called PlainTalk doesn't take dictation, typing out what you say. (For that, you need a program like IBM ViaVoice 
for Mac OS X, www.ibm.com, or iListen, www.macspeech.com .)
Instead, PlainTalk is what's known as a command-and-control technology. It lets you open programs, trigger AppleScripts, 
choose menu commands, trigger keystrokes, and click dialog box buttons and tabs—just by speaking their names.
Few people use PlainTalk speech recognition. But if your Mac has a microphone, PlainTalk is worth at least a 15-minute 
test drive. It may become a part of your work routine forever.
14.4.1 Your First Conversation with the Mac
The on/off switch for speech recognition in Mac OS X is the Speech panel of System Preferences (Figure 14-9). Where you 
see "Apple Speakable Items is," click On. (The flrst time you do this, a small instructions window appears. Read it if you 
like, and then click Continue. If you ever want to see these tips again, click the Helpful Tips button on this pane.)
14.4.1.1 The Feedback window
Check out the right side of your screen: A small, microphone-like floating window now appears (Figure 14-10). The word 
Esc in its center indicates the "listen" key—the key you're supposed to hold down when you want the Mac to respond to 
your voice. (You wouldn't want the Mac listening all the time—even when you said, for example, "Hey, it's cold in here. 
Close the window." Therefore, the Mac comes ready to listen only when you're pressing that key.)
You can specify a different key, if you wish, or eliminate the requirement to press a key altogether, as described in the next 
section.
When you start talking, you'll also see the Mac's interpretation of what you said written out in a yellow balloon just over the 
Feedback window.
Top: Turn off listening altogether using the On/Off tab.
Bottom: If you turn on "Key toggles listening on and off," then you don't have to press a key to 
make the Mac listen. (Instead, pressing the designated key turns the speech recognition feature 
on or off completely.) In the Name blank, type the name you want the Mac to listen for as it 
monitors the sound from your mike.

14.4 Speech Recognition
 
14.4.1.2 The Speakable Commands window
Here's the most important single fact to understand about PlainTalk speech recognition: The only commands it understands 
are those listed in the Speakable Commands window, which generally appears automatically when you turn on speech 
recognition.
Keeping your eye on the Speakable Commands window is absolutely essential, because it offers a complete list of 
everything your Mac understands. As you can see, some of them represent shortcuts that would take several steps if you 
had to perform them manually.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-4.html (2 of 8)5/3/2004 5:03:16 AM

14.4 Speech Recognition
To open this list if it's not open, click the tiny arrow at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open Speech 
Commands Window from the commands that appear. Here are a few examples of what you'll flnd in the list at flrst:
G     Open Sherlock. Launches the Sherlock Web-searching program, as described in Chapter 20, saving you the 
trouble of using the Dock or finding it in your Applications folder.
G     Close this window. Closes the frontmost window instantly.
G     Empty the trash. Works only when you're in the Finder.
G     Switch to AppleWorks. Brings AppleWorks to the front. (Of course, you can say "switch to" and then the name of 
any running or recently used program.)
Left: The Feedback window lacks the standard Close and Minimize buttons. If it's in your way, 
just double-click it (or say "minimize speech window") to shrink it into your Dock. If you choose 
Speech Preferences from its bottom-edge triangle, you open the Speech preferences window.
Right: Choosing Open Speech Commands window, of course, opens the list of things you can 
say.
 
G     Quit all applications. Saves you the trouble of switching into each program and choosing Quit.
G     Open the Speech Commands window or Show me what to say. Opens the Speech Commands window, of 
course.
G     What day is it? Tells you the date.
G     Tell me a joke. Begins a pathetic/funny knock-knock joke. You've got to play along, providing the "who's there?" 
and "so-and-so who?" answers.
Mac OS X updates the listing in the Speech Commands window in real time, according to the context. When you switch 
from one program to another, you see a list of the local commands that work in the new program. You'll discover that when 
you use the "Tell me a joke" command, for example, you don't necessarily have to say, "Who's there?" You can also say 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-4.html (3 of 8)5/3/2004 5:03:16 AM

14.4 Speech Recognition
"Stop," "Go away," or "Stop with the jokes!" (It must really be fun to work at Apple.)
14.4.1.3 Speaking to the Mac
When you're ready to talk to your computer, position the microphone between one and three feet from your mouth. If it's a 
headset mike, make sure it's plugged into your Mac's microphone or USB jack. If it's built-in, speech recognition may not be 
as accurate.
In any case, flnish up by opening the Speech panel of System Preferences. Click the Listening mini-tab, and use the 
Microphone pop-up menu to specify which microphone you'll be using (if you have a choice).
Now you're ready to begin. While pressing the Esc key (if that's still the one identifled in the Feedback window), begin 
speaking. Speak normally; don't exaggerate or shout. Try one of the commands in the Speakable Commands list—perhaps 
"What time is it?" If the Feedback window doesn't display animated sound waves, indicating that the Mac is hearing you, 
something's wrong with your microphone setup. Open the Speech panel again, and conflrm that the correct microphone is 
selected.
14.4.2 Customizing Speech Recognition
You can tailor the speech recognition feature in two ways: by adjusting the way it looks and operates, and by adding new 
commands to its vocabulary.
14.4.2.1 Changing when the Mac listens
Early experimentation quickly showed Apple's speech engineers that having the microphone "open," listening full-time, was 
an invitation for disaster. Everyday phone conversations, offlce chatter, and throat clearings completely bewildered the 
software, triggering random commands.
Therefore, you must explicitly tell the Mac when you're addressing it. When you flrst turn on the speech recognition feature, 
the Mac expects you to alert it by pressing a key when you speak, such as the Esc key.
To change the key you hold down when you want the Mac to listen, visit the Speech panel of 
System Preferences; click the Listening tab, and then click Change Key. A little message 
prompts you to press the keyboard key you'd prefer to use. Your choices are Esc, tilde (~), 
Delete, F5 through F15 (not including the Eject key), or the keys on your numeric keypad—
with or without the Shift, Control, or Option keys.
If you'd rather not have to press some key whenever you want the computer's attention, click the other option in this box, 
"Key toggles listening on and off." Now to get the computer's attention you must speak its name—which you type into the 
Name box—before each command. For example, you might say, "Computer, open AppleWorks," or "Hal, what day is it?"
The name you specify appears in the middle of the round Feedback window.
NOTE
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-4.html (4 of 8)5/3/2004 5:03:16 AM

14.4 Speech Recognition
This method of getting the computer's attention is less reliable than the push-a-key-to-talk system. Especially 
if you name the computer Hal; although that's hilarious in theory, polysyllabic names work better in practice.
By using the "Name is" pop-up menu, meanwhile, you can specify how big your window of opportunity is:
G     Optional before each command. If you work alone in a quiet room, this is the choice for you. It means that you 
don't have to press a key or say the Mac's name when issuing a voice command. Everything you say is considered 
a command.
G     Required before each command. Nothing you say is interpreted as a command unless you say the computer's 
name flrst, as in, "Macintosh, switch to Microsoft Word."
G     Required 15 seconds after last command, Required 30 seconds after last command. Sometimes you want to 
issue several commands in a row, and would feel foolish saying, "Computer, close all windows. Computer, empty 
the trash. Computer, switch to AppleWorks." When you turn on this option, you can say the computer's name just 
once; all commands that you issue in the next 15 or 30 seconds "belong to" that flrst salutation. The push-to-talk 
key and the spoken name, in this case, serve as a master on/off switch for the Mac's listening mode.
If you're not using the push-to-talk method, you can still turn speech recognition off 
temporarily by saying, "Turn on push to talk." (Now the Mac listens to you only when you're 
pressing the designated key.) When you want to return to listening-all-the-time mode, say, 
"Listen continuously."
Finally, note that the Speech pane also lets you turn off recognition completely. On the On/Off tab, click Off (Figure 14-9). 
On the other hand, if you really love the speech feature, you can save yourself the trouble of visiting this control panel each 
morning by turning on "Start Speakable Items at log in." Speech recognition will be turned on and "listening" as soon as you 
log in.
14.4.2.2 Changing the feedback
Another set of options on the On/Off tab governs what the Mac does when it understands something that you've said. For 
example:
G     Play sound.The Mac generally makes a sound whenever it recognizes something you've said. Use this pop-up 
menu to control which of your built-in beeps you want it to use—or choose None.
G     Speak conflrmation. Sometimes the Speech Feedback window shows you a message of its own—when you use 
the "Empty the trash" command, for example, text in the Feedback window may inform you that a locked item 
prevents the emptying. The Mac generally reads this text aloud to you; turn this checkbox off if you'd rather have 
the Mac be silent.
14.4.2.3 Triggering menus by voice
On the Speech panel of System Preferences, click the Speech Recognition tab, and then click the Commands mini-tab on 
that window. Here you'll flnd a list of the command categories that Speakable Items can understand. As you turn each 
checkbox on or off, watch the Speech Commands window. Giant swaths of commands appear or disappear as you fool with 
these checkboxes, giving you a good indication as to their function. Here's a rundown:
G     Global Speakable Items. This is the master list of Speakable Items shown in Figure 14-11.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-4.html (5 of 8)5/3/2004 5:03:16 AM

14.4 Speech Recognition
G     Application Speciflc Items. Certain Mac OS X programs come with preset lists of commands that work only when 
you're in the relevant program. For example, whenever you're in the Finder, you can say, "Empty the trash," "Go to 
my Home directory," "Hide the Dock," "Minimize all windows," "Make a new folder," and so on. When this checkbox 
is off, the Mac no longer recognizes any of these handy commands.
G     Application Switching. This is the command category at the bottom half of the Speech Commands list—"Switch 
to Address Book," "Switch to AOL," and so on.
G     Front Window. In your Speech Commands window, you'll note the appearance of a new category of commands, 
called Front Window. The idea here is to provide you with quick speech-recognition access to the most prominent 
buttons, tabs, and icons in whichever window is before you. Figure 14-11 elaborates on the idea.
G     Menu Bar. This command lets you open menus (in the menu bar) by speaking their names.
Once you say its name ("File menu," for example), the menu opens. Now you can say any command in the open 
menu ("New Playlist," "Save," or whatever). The Menu Bar category of the Speech Commands window changes to 
remind you of what you can say at any given moment.
The Front Window commands change automatically to reflect the controls that are in the 
frontmost window. For example, in the Date & Time panel of System Preferences, you can say 
anything in the circled area of the Speech Commands window: the name of any tab or window 
control (indicated by the arrows). Whenever you say an item, the Mac "clicks" it for you. You 
can also speak the menus' names to open them.
 
You can probably see that the combination of Front Window and Menu Bar commands lets you do quite a bit of work on 
your Mac without ever needing the mouse or keyboard.

14.4 Speech Recognition
14.4.2.4 Improving the PlainTalk vocabulary
By putting an alias of a favorite document, folder, disk, or program into your Home
 Library
Speakable Items 
folder, you can teach PlainTalk to recognize its name and open it for you on command. You can name these icons anything 
you want. You can also rename the starter set that Apple provides. You'll have the best luck with multiword or polysyllabic 
names—"Microsoft Word," not just "Word."
But one kind of icon PlainTalk can open is an AppleScript icon, the kind you create by following the instructions in Chapter 
7. If you open your Home folder
Library
 Speech
Speakable Items, you'll discover that most of the built-in 
speakable-item icons are, in fact, AppleScript icons. The point is that you can make PlainTalk do almost anything you want, 
especially in the Finder, simply by creating AppleScripts and putting them into the Speakable Items folder.
14.4.2.5 Application-speciflc commands
Most of the preinstalled PlainTalk commands work in any program. You can say, for example, "Open Sherlock" to launch 
Sherlock from within any program.
However, you can also create commands that work only in a speciflc program. They sit in your Speakable 
Items
Application Speakable Items folder, inside individual application-name folders. For example, Mac OS X comes 
with commands for Internet Explorer that include Go Back, Go Forward, and Page Down.
If you get good at AppleScript, you can create your own application-command folders in the Speakable 
Items
Application Speakable Items folder.
Then open the program for which you want to create special commands and say, "Make this application speakable." The 
Mac creates a folder for the program in the Speakable Items folder; flll it with the AppleScripts you've created.
Of course, not every program is equally suitable to being voice-controlled—since PlainTalk is based on AppleScript, only 
programs that are AppleScriptable (Chapter 7) thrive with this treatment.
NOTE
If you give an application-speciflc icon the exact same name as one of the global commands, the Mac 
executes the application-speciflc one—if that program is running.
14.4.2.6 PlainTalk tips, tricks, and troubleshooting
When you're creating new commands, keep this advice in mind:
G     Favor longer icon names. "Save the flle" works better than "Save."
G     If the name of an icon includes an acronym (such as FTP), put spaces between the letters (F T P), if you'll be 
pronouncing them as individual letters.
G     You can precede the name of something in your Speakable Items folder with the word "open." PlainTalk doesn't 
care—"open Excel" and "Excel" do the same thing.
If you can't seem to make the speech recognition feature work, consider this checklist:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-4.html (7 of 8)5/3/2004 5:03:16 AM

14.4 Speech Recognition
G     If the stripes on the bottom half of the Feedback window don't change color when you're speaking, something's 
wrong with your microphone arrangement. Revisit the Speech panel of System Preferences, and make sure you've 
selected the correct microphone. Also make sure you've plugged the microphone into the correct jack on the back 
or side of the computer.
G     Make sure you're pressing the correct key (if you're using the push-to-talk method), or speaking the name of the 
computer before each command (if not).
G     Make sure you're saying the name of the working command, as listed in either the Speakable Commands window 
(which appears when you say "Show me what to say") or the Speech Commands list.

14.5 The Mac Talks Back
So far in this chapter, you've read about the Mac's listening ability. But the conversation doesn't have to be one way; it's 
even easier to make the Mac talk.
In fact, Mac can read almost anything you like: text that you pass your cursor over, alert messages, menus, and any text 
document in any program. It can speak in your choice of 22 synthesized voices, ages eight to flfty. The Mac's voice comes 
out of its speakers, reading with a twangy, charmingly Norwegian accent.
For 15 minutes of hilarious fun, try clicking the Mac's voices in turn (or press the up and down 
arrow keys) to hear a sample sentence spoken in that voice. Drag the slider to affect how fast 
he or she speaks. (Clearly, Apple's programmers had some fun with this assignment.)
 
14.5.1 Setting Up the Mac's Voice
To conflgure the way the Mac talks, revisit the Speech panel of System Preferences. Click the Default Voice tab at the top 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-5.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 5:04:06 AM

14.5 The Mac Talks Back
of the window. As you can see in Figure 14-12, you can control which of the Mac's voices you want your computer to use, 
as well as how fast it should speak.
Five of the voices sing rather than speak: Good News sings to the tune of "Pomp and 
Circumstance," also known as the Graduation March; Bad News sings to the tune of the 
Chopin Prelude in C minor, better known as the Funeral March; Cellos sings to the tune of 
Grieg's "Peer Gynt" suite; Pipe Organ sings to the tune of the Alfred Hitchcock TV theme; 
and Bells sings the typical church-bell carillon melody.
In other words, these voices sing whatever words you type to those melodies. (To hear the 
melody in its entirety, don't use any punctuation.)
14.5.2 Programs That Already Talk
Some Mac OS X programs come with built-in speaking features. For example, Mail (Chapter 19) can read your messages 
aloud; just Control-click inside a message window and, from the pop-up menu, choose Speech
Start Speaking. 
(Choose Speech
 Stop Speaking when you've heard enough.) You can also add a Speak Text button in AppleWorks, 
or add a Speak command in FileMaker Pro scripts.
14.5.3 The Chatty Mac
As noted earlier, the Mac is prepared to read to you any text in any program.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Talking to Chess
If your friends and co-workers are, for some reason, still unimpressed by Mac OS X and your mastery of it, 
invite them over to watch you play a game of chess with your Mac—by talking to it.
(Actually, this feature isn't purely for entertainment: Some chess players prefer to move without looking at the 
board. By speaking their moves to the computer—and having the computer respond by speaking its own 
moves—these people can play "blindfolded.")
Open the Chess program, which is described in Section 9.5. Unless you've turned it off (in 
Chess
Preferences), the game's speech-recognition feature is already turned on. When it's on, the round 
Feedback window should be visible onscreen.
To learn how to speak commands in a way that Chess will understand, click the small gray triangle at the 
bottom of the Speech Feedback panel to open the Speech Commands window. As usual, it lists all the 
commands that Chess can comprehend.
You specify the location of pieces using the grid of numbers and letters that appears along the edges of the 
chessboard. The White king, for example, starts on square e1 because he's in the flrst row (1) and the flfth 
column (e). To move the king forward by one square, you'd say: "King e1 to e2."
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-5.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 5:04:06 AM

14.5 The Mac Talks Back
As the Speech Commands window should make clear, a few other commands are at your disposal. "Take 
back move" is one of the most useful. When you're ready to close in for the kill, the syntax is: "Pawn e5 takes 
f6."
And smile when you say that.
To experiment, visit the Speech panel of System Preferences. Click the Spoken User Interface tab (Figure 14-13).
Here are all the different occasions when the Mac can talk to you:
Here's where you tell the Mac just how chatty you want it to be. You can also control which 
voice it uses, and even how fast it talks—a slider, by the way, you won't flnd on many of your 
human companions.
 
14.5.3.1 When an alert message appears onscreen
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-5.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 5:04:06 AM

14.5 The Mac Talks Back
You can make the Mac read aloud error messages and alert messages that may appear on your screen. Here are the 
controls available to you:
G     Speak the phrase. Use this pop-up menu to specify which utterance the Mac speaks before the actual error 
message—for example, "Excuse me! The Trash could not be emptied" or "Attention! The document could not be 
printed." If you don't want any such preamble, turn off the checkbox.
If you choose "Next in the list" or "Random from the list" from this pop-up menu, you'll never hear the same 
expletive twice. Better yet, choose Edit Phrase List to open a dialog box where you can specify your own words of 
frustration. (Apple Computer, Inc. is not liable for any trouble you may get into with people in neighboring cubicles.)
G     Speak the alert text. If you turn off this checkbox, the Mac won't read the actual error message at all. That is, if 
you turn on "Speak the phrase" but leave this checkbox off, the Mac will shout, for example, "Oh dear!" to get your 
attention, but will leave it up to you to read the onscreen message.
G     Talking Alerts voice. Use this pop-up menu to specify the voice you want reading your error messages. (It doesn't 
have to be the same as the standard Mac default voice that's used for other purposes.)
G     Wait before speaking. The entire purpose of the Talking Alerts feature is ostensibly to get your attention if you've 
wandered away—mentally or physically—from your Mac. The chances are slim, but an urgent problem might occur 
that, if left undetected, could land you in trouble. (A 500-page printout brought to its knees by a paper jam comes to 
mind.)
In other words, if you're still sitting in front of your Mac, you may not need the Mac to speak to get your attention; 
you'll simply read the onscreen message. That's why you can set this slider to make the Mac wait, after the error 
message appears, for up to a minute before trying to flag you with its voice, so that it won't harangue you 
unnecessarily. (Click Demonstrate Settings for a sense of how long the Mac will delay before speaking.)
14.5.3.2 When an application requires your attention
A jumping Dock icon means that the program is trying to get your attention. It might be because your printer is out of paper, 
or it might be because you've tried to shut down but one program still has open, unsaved documents. In any case, now the 
Mac can tell you, in so many words, which program needs some loving care.
14.5.3.3 When your cursor passes over some text
This feature is, obviously, a spectacular help for anyone who has trouble seeing. Now your cursor can "read" buttons, tabs, 
dialog box options, desktop icons, the subject lines of messages in your email inbox, and so on.
14.5.3.4 When a key is pressed
In its own humble way, this option offers the most dramatic possibilities of all. It means that the Mac can read any text in 
any program. Now you can hear any Web page read to you, any email message, any sticky note—a welcome break for 
sore eyes. Furthermore, if you do any kind of writing at all, you'll discover the value of having your material read back to you 
out loud; it's a proofreading technique that reveals all kinds of typos and wordos that you wouldn't catch just by reading, 
even if you read it 50 times.
The very flrst time you turn on this checkbox, the Mac prompts you to specify a keystroke. (Later, you can always change 
the keystroke by clicking the Set Key button.) Choose a keystroke that doesn't conflict with the program you're using—Shift- 
Option-Z, for example.
Now go to the program where you'd like the reading to happen. Highlight some text (or just press 
-A to select all of it).

14.5 The Mac Talks Back
Then press the keystroke you specifled. The Mac begins reading it aloud immediately. To interrupt the playback, press the 
same keystroke again.
And be glad you were alive to see the day.
If you have an iPod, don't forget that your Mac can convert any text or word processing 
document into a spoken recording, so that you can listen to it when you're on the go. Details 
in Section 7.3.

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
In the same way that your grandmother turned yesterday's dinner into today's sandwich (and tomorrow's soup), Apple 
recycled the handwriting technology of its failed Newton handheld and added it to Mac OS X. It's now called Ink, and it does 
exactly what it used to: turns your handwriting into "typed" text in any program.
You can't very well write directly on your Apple Cinema Display (although that would be cool—Apple, are you listening?). 
That's why Ink appears in Mac OS X only if you have a graphics tablet, one of those stylus-and-pad devices found generally 
only on the desks of graphic artists. (Wacom is the best-known tablet company, but there are a couple of others.)
Top: Most people never see the Ink panel of System Preferences, since it appears only when 
you install a Wacom graphics tablet.
Bottom: You can shrink the Ink toolbar down to a small square by clicking on the zoom button 
(Section 1.2.3), or expand it to include the Ink pad by clicking the notepad icon at the toolbar's 
right.

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
 
Can Ink really replace the keyboard? Not for anything more than quick notes, that's for sure. But it can be handy when 
you're Web surflng, sketching, fllling in database forms, and so on.
14.6.1 Write Anywhere
The Ink panel appears in System Preferences only after you've installed a tablet and its software driver.
Once you've done so, open System Preferences and click the Ink icon. Turn on handwriting recognition by setting the 
"Handwriting Recognition is" button to On (Figure 14-14, top). Right away, you see a change on your screen: the Ink toolbar 
appears (Figure 14-14, bottom).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-6.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:09 AM

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
Now visit a program that accepts typing—TextEdit, for example. As you start to write on the tablet, a translucent, yellow, 
lined overlay appears, magically expanding if necessary to accommodate your writing. A moment after you stop writing 
each word, the Mac turns your writing into text and "types" it into the current document (Figure 14-15).
Use the Character Palette (Section 8.14.2) to insert awkward punctuation marks and unusual 
symbols.
As you write, your penstrokes appear on screen. They disappear as the Mac recognizes your 
writing and inserts it at the insertion point. Print neatly on the overlay—don't use script—and 
make capital letters distinctly larger than lowercase letters. It's OK if the yellow writing area 
extends beyond your document window.
 
14.6.2 Writing vs. Mousing
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-6.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:09 AM

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
So when is your stylus a mouse for pointing and clicking, and when is it a writing implement? When "Write Anywhere" is 
turned off, your stylus is just a mouse.
You can flnd this switch in three different places:
G     The flrst icon on the Ink toolbar is the on/off switch for "Allow me to write anywhere." When the icon looks like an 
arrow cursor, your pen is just a pointing device; when it's a fountain pen, it's a writing device.
The next few buttons on the Ink toolbar let you "press" the keys for menu commands: 
, 
Shift, Option, or Control. For example, to trigger the Shift-
-H keystroke (for Replace) in 
Microsoft Word, you'd tap the 
 button, tap Shift, and then write the letter H.
G     An "Allow me to write anywhere" checkbox also appears on the Ink panel of System Preferences.
G     Also in System Preferences, a checkbox called "Show Ink in menu bar" adds a fountain-pen icon (a menulet) to 
your menu bar. Its commands include Write Anywhere and Show Ink Window (meaning the Ink pad, described 
next).
14.6.3 The Ink Pad
The "anywhere on the screen" mode described above is only one place that Ink can detect what you write. If you click the 
rightmost icon on the Ink palette (highlighted in Figure 14-14), or choose Show Ink Window from either System Preferences 
or the Ink menulet, you can also summon a floating "note pad" window called the Ink pad.
Limiting the writing area to the Ink pad is a useful arrangement when you're working in a graphics program and want the 
Mac to distinguish between penstrokes that draw and penstrokes that write. The Ink pad is also handy because it 
recognizes gestures, described next.
Click the A button to input text; click the star button to make a drawing. Either way, after you're 
flnished, click the Send button to have your text or art pasted into whatever document is open 
behind it. (Of course, you can't paste a graphic unless the program you're currently running 
accepts graphics.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-6.html (4 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:09 AM

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
 
At the bottom of the Ink pad, you see two buttons, labeled with the letter A and a star. Their functions are described in 
Figure 14-16.
If Ink makes a mistake in the Ink pad, tap the word while pressing the Control key. You get a 
pop-up list of alternate transcriptions.
14.6.4 Improving Ink
If you flnd that Ink doesn't translate your handwriting well (you write "Millennium" and Ink thinks you wanted "Mill E Numb," 
for example), return to the Ink panel of System Preferences.
Adjust the "My handwriting style is" slider (Figure 14-14, top). If your writing is loose and airy, for example, sliding toward 
"Widely spaced" can dramatically improve Ink's recognition of your chicken scratch.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-6.html (5 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:09 AM

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
If you click Options at the bottom of this tab, you'll flnd even more ways to tweak the way Ink processes your handwriting. 
For example, you can use the sliders here to govern how quickly your writing pen cursor turns back into a pointing-and-
clicking device after you stop writing.
Another way you can help is to teach Ink terms it may not know, such as your friends' names and any professional jargon 
you use. To do so, click the Word List tab (of the Ink panel of System Preferences). Click Add, type the word you want Ink 
to consider legitimate, and click OK. Adding uncommon words to the Word List tab dramatically improves recognition.
Do these gestures look more like hieroglyphics? No problem. When you click a gesture, the 
large box at the right of the screen displays a small animation, showing you how to properly 
write the gesture. Most of them are pretty easy to remember: Undo is a U with an extra leg, 
Paste is a modifled P, and Clear—as all Newton users will remember—is a zigzag line, as if you 
were crossing something out on a pad of paper.
 
In other words, don't give up if Ink doesn't perfectly recognize your handwriting right away. After working with it for a little 
while, you'll get the hang of using Ink—and it'll get the hang of understanding you.
14.6.5 Gestures
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-14-SECT-6.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:09 AM

14.6 Ink: Handwriting Recognition
Ink also recognizes gestures, a strange but logical concept: When you draw certain shapes on the tablet, Ink performs 
commands like Undo, Copy, Paste, and Select All. There are also written characters for keys like Delete, Space, Tab, and 
Return.
To view the list of gestures that Ink knows, click the Gestures tab of the Ink panel of System Preferences, as shown in 
Figure 14-17. By learning these characters, you can maximize the time you spend using your pen, and minimize the effort 
of pressing keys and pulling down menus.
14.6.6 Editing Your Transcriptions
Since your stylus can serve as both your keyboard and your mouse, editing your transcribed text, as you might guess, can 
be a tad tricky. Use these techniques:
G     Switch the pen back into mouse mode (so that you can drag across text to highlight it) by pausing momentarily. 
Drag to select the botched word, and then write the replacement word. (You can also tap the flrst Ink toolbar icon to 
switch into, or out of, writing mode.)
G     To insert punctuation after a word, you're supposed to highlight the last letter, and then rewrite the letter and the 
punctuation.
G     In Inkpad, you can use gestures to edit, as described above.

Chapter 15. Terminal: Doorway to Unix
As you're certainly aware by now, Mac OS X's resemblance to the traditional Mac operating system is only superficial. The 
engine underneath the pretty skin is utterly different. In fact, it's Unix, one of the oldest and most respected operating 
systems in use today.
The first time you see it, you'd swear that Unix has about as much in common the traditional Mac OS as a Jeep does with a 
melon (see Figure 15-1).
Top: What most people think of when they think "Macintosh" is a graphic interface—one that 
you control with a mouse, using icons and menus to represent files and commands.
Bottom: Terminal offers a second way to control Mac OS X: a command line interface, which 
you operate by typing out programming commands.
 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...ther%20Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 5:04:12 AM

Chapter 15. Terminal: Doorway to Unix
What the illustration at the bottom of Figure 15-1 shows, of course, is a command line interface: a place where you can type 
out instructions to the computer. This is a world without icons, menus, or dialog boxes; even the mouse is almost useless.
Surely you can appreciate the irony: The brilliance of the original 1984 Macintosh was that it eliminated the command line 
interface that was still the ruling party on the computers of the day (like Apple II and DOS machines). Most non-geeks sighed 
with relief, delighted that they'd never have to memorize commands again. Yet here's Mac OS X, Apple's supposedly 
ultramodern operating system, complete with a command line! What's going on?
UP TO SPEED
Mac OS X's Unix Roots
In 1969, Bell Labs programmer Ken Thompson found himself with some spare time after his main project, an 
operating system called Multics, was canceled. Bell Labs had withdrawn from the expensive project, 
disappointed with the results after four years of work.
But Thompson still thought the project—an OS that worked well as a cooperative software-development 
environment— was a promising idea. Eventually, he and colleague Dennis Ritchie came up with the OS that 
would soon be called Unix (a pun on Multics). Bell Labs saw the value of Unix, agreed to support further 
development, and became the first corporation to adopt it.
In the age when Thompson and Ritchie started their work on Unix, most programmers wrote code that would 
work on only one kind of computer (or even one computer model). Unix, however, was one of the first portable 
operating systems: its programs could run on different kinds of computers without having to be completely 
rewritten. That's because Thompson and Ritchie wrote Unix using a new programming language of their own 
invention called C.
In a language like C, programmers need only write their code once. After that, a software Cuisinart called a 
compiler can convert the newly hatched software into the form a particular computer model can understand.
Unix soon found its way into labs and, thanks to AT&T's low academic licensing fees, universities around the 
world. Programmers all over the world added to the source code, fixed bugs, and then passed those 
modifications around.
In the mid-1970s, the University of California at Berkeley became the site of especially intense Unix 
development. Students and faculty there improved the Unix kernel (the central, essential part of the OS), 
added features, and wrote new Unix applications. By 1977, they had enough additional software to release 
their own version of Unix, the first of several Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) versions.
As it happened, the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was seeking a 
uniform, portable OS to use for their growing wide-area network, originally called ARPAnet (and now called the 
Internet).
DARPA liked Unix and agreed to sponsor further research at Berkeley. In January 1983, DARPA changed 
ARPAnet's networking protocol to TCP/IP—and the Internet was born, running mostly on Unix machines.
Cut to 1985. Steve Jobs left Apple to start NeXT Computer, whose NextStep operating system was based on 
BSD Unix. When Apple bought NeXT in 1996, Jobs, NextStep (eventually renamed OpenStep), and its 
Terminal program came along with it. The Unix that beats within Mac OS X's heart is just the latest resting 
place for the OS that Jobs's team developed at NeXT.

Chapter 15. Terminal: Doorway to Unix
So the next time you hear Apple talk about its "new" operating system, remember that its underlying 
technology is actually more than 30 years old
Actually, the command line never went away. At universities and corporations worldwide, professional computer nerds kept 
right on pounding away at the little C: or $ prompts, appreciating the efficiency and power such direct computer control 
afforded them.
You're forgiven if your reaction to learning Unix is, "For goodness' sake—can't I finish learning one way to control my new 
operating system before I have to learn yet another one?"
Absolutely. You never have to use Mac OS X's command line. In fact, Apple has swept it far under the rug, obviously 
expecting that most people will use the beautiful icons and menus of the regular desktop. In earlier versions of Mac OS X, 
there were a few tasks you could perform only at the command line, but there are even fewer of them in 10.3.
For intermediate or advanced Mac fans with a little time and curiosity, however, the command line opens up a world of 
possibilities. It lets you access corners of Mac OS X that you can't get to from the regular desktop. It lets you perform certain 
tasks with much greater speed and efficiency than you'd get by clicking buttons and dragging icons. And it gives you a 
fascinating glimpse into the minds and moods of people who live and breathe computers.
If you've ever fooled around with ResEdit, experimented with AppleScript, or set up a Mac on a network, you already know 
the technical level of the material you're about to read. The Unix command line may be unfamiliar, but it doesn't have to be 
especially technical, particularly if you have some "recipes" to follow like the ones in this chapter and the next.
NOTE
Unix is an entire operating system unto itself. This chapter is designed to help you find your footing and 
decide whether you like the feel of Unix. If you get bitten by the bug, see Appendix E for sources of additional 
Unix info.

15.1 Terminal
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
15.1 Terminal
The keyhole into Mac OS X's Unix innards is a program called Terminal, which sits in your Applications
Utilities folder 
(see Figure 15-2). Terminal is named after the terminals (computers that consist of only a monitor and keyboard) that tap 
into the mainframe computers at universities and corporations. In the same way, Terminal is just a window that passes 
along messages to and from the Mac's brain.
The first time you open Terminal, you'll notice that there's not much in its window except the date and time of your last login, 
a welcome message, and the command line prompt (Figure 15-2).
For user-friendliness fans, Terminal doesn't get off to a very good start; this prompt looks about as technical as computers 
get. It breaks down like this:
G     office-mac: is the name of your Mac (at least, as Unix thinks of it). It's usually the Mac's Computer Name (as it 
appears in the Sharing panel of System Preferences), but it's occasionally the name your Mac goes by on the 
Internet.
G     ~. The next part of the prompt indicates what folder you're "in" (see Figure 15-1). It denotes the working directory—
that is, the currently open folder. (Remember, there are no icons in Unix.) Essentially, this notation tells you where 
you are as you navigate your machine.
The very first time you try out Terminal, the working directory is set to the symbol ~. That tilde symbol is important 
shorthand; it means "your own Home folder." It's what you see the first time you start up Terminal, but you'll soon 
be seeing the names of other folders here—office-mac: /Users or office-mac: /System/Library, for example. (More 
on this slash notation in Section 1.2.2.)
NOTE
Before Apple came up with the user-friendly term folder to represent an electronic holding tank for files, 
folders were called directories. But in this chapter and the next, you'll encounter the term directory almost 
exclusively. In any discussion of Unix, "directory" is simply the correct term.
Besides, using a term like "working folder" within earshot of Unix geeks is likely to get you lynched.
G     chris$ begins with your short user name. It reflects whoever's logged into the shell (see the box on the facing 
page), which is usually whoever's logged into the mac at the moment. As for the $ sign, think of it as a colon. In 
fact, think of the whole prompt shown in Figure 15-2 as Unix's way of asking, "OK, Chris, I'm listening. What's your 
pleasure?"
Unless you've fiddled with Terminal's preferences, the insertion point looks like a tall rectangle at the end of the command 
line. It trots along to the right as you type.
On the Web, Mac OS X's Terminal is one of the most often discussed elements of Mac OS X. 
Dozens of step-by-step tutorials for performing certain tasks circulate online, usually without 
much annotation as to why you're typing what you're typing. As you read this chapter, 
remember that capitalization matters in Terminal, even though it doesn't in the Finder. As far as

15.1 Terminal
most Unix commands are concerned, Hello and hello are two different things.
 
15.1.1 Unix Programs
An enormous number of programs have been written for Unix. And thanks to thousands of open-source developers—
programmers all over the world who collaborate and make their work available for the next round of modification—much of 
this software is freely available to all, including Mac OS X users.
Each Unix command generally calls up a single application (or process, as geeks call it) that launches, performs a task, and 
closes. Many of the best-known such applications come with Mac OS X.
Here's a fun one: Just type uptime and press Enter or Return. (That's how you run a Unix program: type its name and press 
Enter). On the next line, Terminal shows you how long your Mac has been turned on continuously. It shows you something 
like: "6:00PM up 8 days, 15:04, 1 user, load averages: 1.24, 1.37, 1.45"—meaning your Mac has been running for 8 days, 
15 hours nonstop.
You're finished running the uptime program. The $ prompt returns, suggesting that Terminal is ready for whatever you 
throw at it next.
Try this one: Type cal at the prompt, and then press Enter. Unix promptly spits out a calendar of the current month.

15.1 Terminal
POWER USERS' CLINIC
bash, Terminal, and Shells
One Unix program runs automatically when you open a Terminal window: bash. It's Apple's chosen shell for 
Mac OS X 10.3.
A shell is a Unix program that interprets the commands you've typed, passes them to the kernel (the 
operating system's brain), and then shows you the kernel's response.
But more practically, the shell is the Unix Finder. It's the program that lets you navigate the contents of your 
hard drive, see what's inside certain folders, launch programs and documents, and so on.
There are actually several different shells available in Unix, each with slightly different command syntax. A 
few others— like tcsh, zsh, and csh—come with Mac OS X. (You can choose among them by choosing 
Terminal
Preferences and typing the new shell's path into the text box.) But on a clean installation of 
Panther, Terminal comes set to use bash. 
Bash evolved from the original sh shell, which was named the Bourne shell after its inventor. Bash got its 
name, then, as the Bourne Again Shell (get it?).
So why did Apple switch to bash in Panther? (In Mac OS X 10.2, tcsh was the standard shell. In fact, if you 
upgraded to 10.3 rather than performing a clean install and creating a fresh account for yourself, you'll still 
have tcsh.)
Turns out bash has better international-text features, among other improvements—and goodness knows, 
Apple would love for Mac OS X to become a hit in as many countries as possible. Bash is also more popular 
than tcsh. And, of course, the bash prompt symbol, $, is a lot more inspiring than the tcsh prompt, which was 
a % symbol.
You can open additional Terminal windows (45 max) by choosing File
New Shell. Each window runs 
independently of any others. For proof, try opening several windows and then running the cal command in 
each
office-mac:~ chris$ cal

15.1 Terminal
office-mac:~ chris$
This time, try typing cal 11 2004, cal -y, or cal -yj. These three commands make Unix generate a calendar of November 
2004, a calendar of the current year, and a Julian calendar of the current year, respectively.
The mouse isn't very useful at the command line. You generally move the cursor only with 
the left and right arrow keys. (The Delete key works as it always does.)
You can use the mouse, however, to select text from anywhere in the window (or other 
programs) and paste it in at the prompt. You can also use the mouse to drag an icon off your 
desktop into the Terminal window, as shown in Figure 15-3. And in the Terminal
Window 
Settings
Emulation dialog box, you'll find a preference that lets you Option-click in a 
command line to plant the insertion point there.

15.2 Navigating in Unix
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
15.2 Navigating in Unix
If you can't see any icons for your files and folders, how are you supposed to work with them?
You have no choice but to ask Unix to tell you what folder you're looking at (using the pwd command), what's in it (using the 
ls command), and what folder you want to switch to (using the cd command), as described in the following pages.
UP TO SPEED
Pathnames 101
In many ways, browsing the contents of your hard drive using Terminal is just like doing so with the Finder. 
You start with a folder, and move down into its subfolders, or up into its parent folders.
In this chapter and the next, you'll be asked to specify a certain file or folder in this tree of folders. But you 
can't see their icons from the command line. So how are you supposed to identify the file or folder you want?
By typing its pathname. The pathname is a string of folder names, something like a map, that takes you from 
the root level to the next nested folder, to the next, and so on. (The root level is, for learning-Unix purposes, 
the equivalent of your main hard drive window. It's represented in Unix by a single slash. The phrase /Users, 
in other words, means "the Users folder in my hard drive window"—or, in Unix terms, "the Users directory at 
the root level.")
One way to refer to the Documents folder in your own Home folder, for example, would be /Users/chris/
Documents (if your name is Chris, that is)
15.2.1 pwd (print working directory, or "Where am I?")
Here's one of the most basic navigation commands: pwd, which stands for print working directory. The pwd command 
doesn't actually print anything on your printer; instead, the pwd command types out, on the screen, the path Unix thinks 
you're in (the working directory).
Try typing pwd and pressing Enter. On the next line, Terminal may show you something like this:
          /Users/chris/Movies
Terminal is revealing the working directory's path—a list of folders-in-folders, separated by slashes, that specifies a folder's 
location on your hard drive. /Users/chris/Movies pinpoints the Movies folder in Chris's Home folder (which, like all Home 
folders, is in the Users directory).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-2.html (1 of 11)5/3/2004 5:04:19 AM

15.2 Navigating in Unix
Capitalization counts in Unix. Command names are almost always all lowercase (like cal and 
pwd). But when you type the names of folders, be sure to capitalize correctly.
15.2.2 ls (list, or "What's in here?")
The ls command, short for list, makes Terminal type out the names of all the files and folders in the folder you're in (that is, 
your working directory). You can try it right now: just type ls and then press Enter. Terminal responds by showing you the 
names of the files and folders in a list, like this:
Desktop         Library      Music          Public
Documents       Movies       Pictures       Sites
In other words, you see a list of the icons that, in the Finder, you'd see in your Home folder.
NOTE
Terminal respects the limits of the various Mac OS X accounts (Chapter 11). In other words, a Standard or 
Administrator account holder isn't generally allowed to peek into someone else's Home folder. If you try, 
you'll be told, "Permission denied."
You can also make Terminal list what's in any other directory (one that's not the working directory) just by adding its 
pathname as an argument. An argument tells the command what to work on. (Remember the Calendar example? When 
you wanted the November 2004 calendar, you typed cal 11 2004. The "11 2004" part was the argument— that is, 
everything you typed after the command itself.)
To see a list of the files in your Documents directory, then, you could just type ls /Users/ chris/ Documents. Better yet, 
because the ~ symbol is short for "my home directory," you could save time by typing ls ~/ Documents. The pathname "~/
Documents" is an argument that you've fed the ls command.
15.2.2.1 About flags
Between a command and its arguments, you can sometimes insert option flags (also called switches)—short modifying 
phrases that affect how the command works. In the Calendar example, you can type cal -y to see a full-year calendar; the -
y part is an option flag.
Option flags are almost always preceded by a hyphen (-), although you can usually run several flags together following just 
one hyphen. If you type ls -ai, both the -a and -i flags are in effect.
Here are some useful options for the ls command:
G     -a. The unadorned ls command even displays the names of invisible files and folders—at least by the Finder's 
definition. The Unix shell uses its own system of denoting invisible files and folders, and ignores the Finder's. That 
doesn't mean you're seeing everything; files that are invisible by the Unix definition still don't show up.

15.2 Navigating in Unix
You can use one of the ls command's flags, however, to force even Unix-invisible files to appear. Just add the -a 
flag. In other words, type this: ls -a. Now when you press Enter, you might see something like this:
./                         Desktop/          Music/
../                        Documents/        Pictures/
.CFUserTextEncoding        Library/          Public/
.Trash/                    Movies/           Sites/
G     -F. As you see, the names of invisible Unix files all begin with a period (Unix folk call them dot files). But are these 
files or folders? To find out, use ls with the -F option (capitalization counts), like this: ls -aF. You're shown 
something like this:
./                     Desktop/        Music/
../                    Documents/      Pictures/
.CFUserTextEncoding    Library/        Public/
.Trash/                Movies/         Sites/
The names of the items themselves haven't changed, but the -F flag makes slashes appear on directory (folder) 
names. This example shows that in your home directory, there are 11 other directories and one file.
G     -G. Here's a fascinating flag that makes ls display color-coded results: blue for directories, red for programs, normal 
black-on-white type for documents, and so on.
G     -R. The -R flag produces a recursive listing—one that shows you the directories within the directories in the list. 
Listing all of the home directory could take several pages, but if you type ls -R Movies, for example, you might get 
something like this:
     Bad Reviews.doc    Old Tahoe Footage  2  Picnic Movie  2  Reviews.doc
     
     ./Old Tahoe Footage 2:
     Tahoe 1.mov     Tahoe 3.mov    Tahoe Project File
     Tahoe 2.mov     Tahoe 4.mov
     
     ./Picnic Movie 2:
     Icon?       Media         Picnic Movie 2 Project
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-2.html (3 of 11)5/3/2004 5:04:19 AM

15.2 Navigating in Unix
     
     ./Picnic Movie 2/Media:
     Picnic Movie 1     Picnic Movie 3    Picnic Movie 5
     Picnic Movie 2     Picnic Movie 4    Picnic Movie 6
In other words, you've got two subdirectories here, called Old Tahoe Footage 2 and Picnic Movie 2—which itself contains a 
Media directory.
As you can tell by the cal and ls examples, Unix commands are very short. They're often just 
two-letter commands, and an impressive number of those use alternate hands (ls, cp, rm, 
and so on).
The reason has partly to do with conserving the limited memory of early computers and 
partly to do with efficiency: most programmers would just as soon type as little as possible to 
get things done. User-friendly it ain't, but as you type these commands repeatedly over the 
months, you'll eventually be grateful for the keystroke savings.
15.2.3 cd (change directory, or "Let me see another folder")
Now you know how to find out what directory you're in, and how to see what's in it, all without double-clicking any icons. 
That's great information, but it's just information. How do you do something in your command-line Finder—like switching to 
a different directory?
To change your working directory, use the cd command, followed by the path of the directory you want to switch to. Want to 
see what's in the Movies directory of your home directory? Type cd /Users/chris/Movies and press Enter. The $ prompt 
shows you what it considers to be the directory you're in now (the new working directory). If you perform an ls command at 
this point, Terminal will show you the contents of your Movies directory.
That's a lot of typing, of course. Fortunately, instead of typing out that whole path (the absolute path, as it's called), you can 
simply specify which directory you want to see relative to the directory you're already in.
For example, if your Home folder is the working directory, the relative pathname of the Trailers directory inside the Movies 
directory would be Movies/Trailers. That's a lot shorter than typing out the full, absolute pathname (/Users/chris/Movies/
Trailers).
If your brain isn't already leaking from the stress, here's a summary of the three different ways you could switch from ~/
(your home directory) to ~/Movies: 
G     cd /Users/chris/Movies. That's the long way—the absolute pathname. It works no matter what your working 
directory is.
G     cd ~/Movies. This, too, is an absolute pathname that you could type from anywhere. It relies on the ~ shorthand 
(which means "my home directory," unless you follow the ~ with another account name).
G     cd Movies. This streamlined relative path exploits the fact that you're already in your home directory.

15.2 Navigating in Unix
Actually, there's a fourth way to specify a directory that involves no typing at all: dragging the 
icon of the directory you want to specify directly into the Terminal window. Figure 15-3 should 
make this clear.
This may be the quickest way of all to identify a directory or file you want to manipulate: don't 
type anything at all. When you drag icons directly from the desktop into a terminal window, the 
icon's pathname appears automatically at the insertion point. Terminal even adds backslashes 
to any special characters in these pathnames for you (a necessary step known as escaping the 
special characters; see Section 15.2.5.2).
 
15.2.4 . and .. (dot and dot-dot, or "Back me out")
So now you've burrowed into your Movies directory. How do you back out?
Sure, you could type out the full pathname of the directory that encloses Movies—if you had all afternoon. But there's a 
shortcut: you can type a period (.) or a double period (..) in any pathname. These shortcuts represent the current directory 
and its parent directory (the directory that contains it), respectively.
To go from your home directory up to /Users, for example, you could just type cd .. (that is, cd followed by a space and two 
periods).
You can also use the dot-dot shortcut repeatedly to climb multiple directories at once, like this: cd ../.., which would mean 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-2.html (5 of 11)5/3/2004 5:04:19 AM

15.2 Navigating in Unix
"switch the working directory to the directory two layers out." If you were in your Movies directory, ../.. would change the 
working directory to the Users directory.
Another trick: You can mix the .. shortcut with actual directory names. For example, suppose your Movies directory contains 
two directories: Trailers and Shorts. Trailers is the current directory, but you want to switch to the Shorts directory. All you'd 
have to do is type cd ../Shorts, as illustrated in Figure 15-4.
15.2.5 Keystroke-Saving Features
By now, you might be thinking that clicking icons would still be faster than doing all this typing. Here's where the typing 
shortcuts of the bash shell come in.
The double dot tells Unix to switch its attention to the Movies directory (walking upward 
through the directory tree); the rest tells it to walk down the Movies directory into the Shorts 
directory. Note that the prompt always identifies the current working directory.

15.2.5.1 Tab completion
You know how you can highlight a file in a Finder window by typing the first few characters of its name? The tab-completion 
feature works much the same way. Over time, it can save you miles of finger movement.
It kicks in whenever you're about to type a pathname. Start by typing the first letter or two of the path you want, and then 
press Tab. Terminal instantly fleshes out the rest of the directory's name. As shown in Figure 15-5, you can repeat this 
process to specify the next directory-name chunk of the path.
Some tips for tab completion:
G     Capitalization counts.
G     Terminal will add backslashes automatically if your directory names include spaces, $ signs, or other special 
characters. But you still have to insert your own backslashes when you type the "hint" characters that tip off tab 
completion.
G     If it can't find a match for what you typed, Terminal beeps.
If it finds several files or directories that match what you typed, Terminal beeps; when you press Tab again, terminal shows 
you a list of them. To specify the one you really wanted, type the next letter or two and then press Tab again.
Top: You type cd /U and then press Tab.
Second from top: Terminal finishes the directory name Users for you.
Third from top: You type c and then press Tab.
Bottom: Terminal finishes the home-directory name, chris. You can also use tab completion to 
specify file names, as when you type ls -l Movies/R and then press Tab; Terminal finishes the 
name Reviews.doc.

15.2 Navigating in Unix
 
15.2.5.2 Using the history
You may find yourself at some point needing to run a previously entered command, but dreading the prospect of re-entering 
the whole command. Retyping a command, however, is never necessary. Terminal (or, rather, the shell it's running) 
remembers the last 500 commands you entered. At any prompt, instead of typing, just press the up or down arrow keys to 
walk through the various commands in the shell's memory. They flicker by, one at a time, at the $ prompt—right there on 
the same line.
15.2.5.3 Wildcards
Wildcards are special characters that represent other characters—and they're huge timesavers.
The most popular wildcard is the asterisk (*), which means "any text can go here." For example, to see a list of the files in 
the working directory that end with the letters te, you could type ls *te. Terminal would show you files named Yosemite, 
BudLite, Brigitte, and so on—and hide all other files in the list.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-2.html (8 of 11)5/3/2004 5:04:19 AM

15.2 Navigating in Unix
Likewise, to see which files and directories begin with "Old," you could type ls Old* and press Enter. You'd be shown only 
the names of icons in the working directory called Old Yeller, Old Tahoe Footage, Olduvai Software, and so on.
If you add the asterisk before and after the search phrase, you'd find items with that phrase anywhere in their names. 
Typing ls *jo* will show you the files named Mojo, johnson, Major Disaster, and so on.
Using * by itself means "show me everything." To see a list of what's in a directory and in the 
directories inside it (as though you'd highlighted all the folders in a Finder list view and then 
pressed 
-right arrow), just type ls *.
15.2.5.4 Directory switching
A hyphen (-) after the cd command means, "take me back to the previous working directory." For example, if you changed 
your working directory from ~/Movies/Movie 1 to ~/Documents/Letters, simply enter cd - to change back to ~/Movies/Movie 
1. Use cd - a second time to return to ~/Documents/Letters. (Note the space between cd and the hyphen.)
If you're doing a lot of switching between directories, you'll probably find it quicker to open 
and switch between two Terminal windows, each with a different working directory.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
No Spaces Allowed
Terminal doesn't see a space as a space. It thinks that a space means, for example, "I've just typed a 
command, and what follows is an argument." If you want to see what's in your Short Films directory, therefore, 
don't bother typing ls ~/Movies/Short Films. You'll only get a "No such file or directory" error message. (See 
the space in the Short Films directory name?)
Similarly, % signs have a special meaning in Unix. If you try to type one in a pathname (because a directory 
name contains %, for example), you'll have nothing but trouble.
Fortunately, you can work around this quirk by using a third reserved, or special, character: the backslash (\). 
It says, "Ignore the special meaning of the next character—a space, for example. I'm not using it for some 
special Unix meaning. I'm using the following space as, well, a space." (At a Unix user-group meeting, you 
might hear someone say, "Use the slash character to escape the space character.")
The correct way to see what's in your Short Films directory, then, would be ls ~/Movies /Short\ Films. (Note 
how the backslash just before the space means, "This is just a space—keep it moving, folks.")
Of course, if you have to enter a lot of text with spaces, it'd be a real pain to type the backslash before every 
single one. Fortunately, instead of using backslashes, you can enclose the whole mess with single quotation 
marks. That is, instead of typing this:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-2.html (9 of 11)5/3/2004 5:04:19 AM

15.2 Navigating in Unix
cd /Users/chris/My\ Documents/Letters\ to\ finish/Letter\ to\ Craig.doc
...you could just type this:
cd '/Users/chris/My Documents/Letters to finish/Letter to Craig.doc'
It can get even more complicated. For example, what if there's a single quote in the path? (Answer: Protect it 
with double quotes.) Ah, but you have years of study ahead of you, grasshoppa.
15.2.5.5 The ~ shortcut
You already know that the tilde (~) character is a shortcut to your home directory. But you can also use it as a shortcut to 
somebody else's home directory simply by tacking on that person's account name. For example, to change to Miho's home 
directory, use cd ~Miho.
15.2.5.6 Special keys
The bash shell offers dozens of special keystroke shortcuts for navigation. You may recognize many of them as useful 
undocumented shortcuts that work in any Cocoa application (see Section 4.8), but even more are available (and useful) in 
Terminal:
Keystroke
Effect
Ctrl-U
Erases the entire command line you're working on (to the insertion point's left).
Ctrl-A
Moves the insertion point to the beginning of the line.
Ctrl-E
Moves the insertion point to the end of the line.
Ctrl-T
Transposes the previous two characters.
Esc-F
Moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next word.
Esc-B
Moves the insertion point to the beginning of the current word.
Esc-Delete Erases the previous word (defined as "anything that ends with a space, slash, or most 
other punctuation marks; periods and asterisks not included"). You have to hold down 
Esc as you press Delete; repeat for each word.
Esc-D
Erases the word, or section of a word, following the insertion point.
Esc-C
Capitalizes the letter following the insertion point.
Esc-U
Changes the next word or word section to all uppercase letters.
Esc-L
Changes the next word or word section to all lowercase letters.

15.3 Working with Files and Directories
The previous pages show you how to navigate your directories using Unix commands. Just perusing your directories isn't 
particularly productive, however. This section shows you how to do something with the files you see listed: copy, move, 
create, and delete directories and files.
You're entering Serious Power territory, where it's theoretically possible to delete a whole 
directory with a single typo. As a precaution, consider working through this section with 
administrator privileges turned off for your account (Section 11.2), so that you won't be able 
to change anything outside your home directory—or even create a new, test account just for 
this exercise.
15.3.1 cp (copy)
Using the Unix command cp, you can copy and rename a file in one move. (Try that in the Finder!)
The basic command goes like this: cp path1 path2, where the path placeholders represent the original file and the copy, 
respectively.
15.3.1.1 Copying in place
To duplicate a file called Thesis.doc, you would type cp Thesis.doc Thesis2.doc. (That's just a space between the names.) 
You don't have to call the copy Thesis2—you could call it anything you like; the point is that you wind up with two identical 
files in the same directory with different names. Just remember to add a backslash before a space if you want to name the 
copy with two words (Thesis\ Backup, for example).
If this command doesn't seem to work, remember that you must type the full names of the 
files you're moving—including their file name suffixes like .doc or .gif, which Mac OS X 
usually hides. Using the ls command before a copy may help you find out what the correct, 
full file names should be. Or you may just want to use the tab-completion feature, making 
Terminal type the whole name for you.
15.3.1.2 Copying and renaming
To copy the same file into, say, your Documents folder instead, just change the last phrase so that it specifies the path, like 
this: cp Reviews.doc ~/Documents/Reviews2. doc.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-3.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:22 AM

15.3 Working with Files and Directories
Note that cp replaces identically named files without warning. Use the -i flag (that is, cp -i) if 
you want to be warned before cp replaces a file like this.
15.3.1.3 Copying without renaming
To copy something into another directory without changing its name, just use a pathname (without a file name) as the final 
phrase. So to copy Reviews.doc into your Documents folder, for example, you would type cp Reviews.doc ~/Documents. 
You can use the "." directory shortcut (which stands for the current working directory) to copy 
files from another directory into the working directory, like this: $ cp ~/Documents/Reviews.
doc . (notice the space and the period after Reviews.doc).
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
The Slash and the Colon
OK, I'm so confused. You say that slashes denote nested directories. But in Mac OS 9, I always read that 
colons (:) denote the Mac's internal folder notation, and that's why I can't use colons in the names of my 
icons. What's the story? 
At the desktop, the Mac still uses colons as path separators instead of the slash. Therefore, you are allowed 
to use slashes in file names in the Finder, but not a colon. Conversely, in Terminal, you can use colons in file 
names but not slashes!
Behind the scenes, Mac OS X automatically converts one form of punctuation to the other, as necessary. For 
example, a file named Letter 6/21/2002 in the Finder shows up as Letter 6:21:2002 in Terminal. Likewise, a 
directory named Attn: Jon in Terminal appears with the name Attn/ Jon in the Finder. Weird—and fun!
15.3.1.4 Multiple files
You can even move several files or directories at once. Where you'd normally specify the source file, just list their 
pathnames separated by spaces, as shown in Figure 15-6.
The first argument of this command lists two different files. The final clause always specifies 
where you want all of these files moved to (in this case, the FinishedMovies directory).

15.3 Working with Files and Directories
You can also use the * wildcard to copy several files at once. For example, suppose you've got these files in your iMovie 
Projects directory: Tahoe 1.mov, Tahoe 2.mov, Tahoe 3.mov, Tahoe 4.mov, Script.doc, and Tahoe Project File. Now 
suppose you want to copy only the QuickTime movies into a directory called FinishedMovies. All you'd have to do is type cp 
* mov ../FinishedMovies and press Enter; Mac OS X instantly performs the copy.
If you wanted to copy all of those files (not just the movies) to another directory, you'd use the * by itself, like this: cp * ../
Finished Movies.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
When Forks Collide: CpMac and MvMac
If you could inspect certain traditional Macintosh files with the software equivalent of a CAT scanner, you'd 
see that its single icon might actually house two chunks of computer code, which the geeks call the data fork 
and the resource fork. (Data refers to, well, data—stuff you type, or the programming code that makes up an 
application. Resources are programming components like icons, windows, toolbars, and other pieces of your 
applications.)
This fork business is news to Unix, however. When you use the cp command (or mv, described later in this 
chapter), Unix copies or moves only the data fork—the one it knows about. The effect on the copied or moved 
file could be minor or disastrous, depending on the type of file. Many non-Cocoa programs (AppleWorks, 
Word, and so on), for example, will be rendered useless, having lost many of their essential resources. Many 
will also be given blank icons, having lost their type and creator codes (Section 4.5.1).
To address this problem, Apple created command line applications called CpMac and MvMac, which are just 
like cp and mv except that they copy or move all forks of any file they copy. The standard Mac OS X 
installation doesn't include these commands, however; they're available only if you install the Developer Tools 
(see Section 9.25.23).
Unfortunately, because these are add-on Unix programs, you have to refer to them using their entire path 
notations. A typical command might therefore look like this: /Developer/ Tools/CpMac -r MacWrite\ Folder ~/
Applications.
You can replace cp with CpMac (and mv with MvMac) in any of the examples in this chapter. There are only 
two minor differences. First, CpMac uses a lowercwhat is the nokie sitease r for its recursive copying option 
instead of a capital R. (MvMac doesn't require any flag; it always moves everything inside a folder.) Second, 
whereas you can specify that cp and mv warn you before overwriting files, CpMac and MvMac provide no 
warnings before overwriting existing files of the same name.
Unfortunately, if the iMovie Projects directory contained other directories and not just files, that command would produce an 
error message; the Unix cp command doesn't copy directories within directories unless you explicitly tell it to, using the -R 
option flag. Here's the finished command that copies everything in the current directory— both files and directories—into 
FinishedMovies: cp -R * ../FinishedMovies. 
Here's one more example: a command that copies everything (files and directories) with Tahoe in its name into someone 
else's Drop Box directory: cp -R *Tahoe* ~miho/ Public/Drop\ Box. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-3.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:22 AM

15.3 Working with Files and Directories
15.3.2 mv: Moving and Renaming Files and Directories
Now that you know how to copy files, you may want to move or rename them. To do so, you use the Unix command mv 
almost exactly the same way you'd use cp (except that it always moves directories inside of directories you're moving, so 
you don't have to type -R).
The syntax looks like this: mv oldname newname. For example, to change your Movies directory's name to Films, you'd 
type mv Movies Films. You can rename both files and directories this way.
15.3.2.1 Moving files and directories
To rename a file and move it to a different directory simultaneously, just replace the last portion of the command with a 
pathname. To move the Tahoe1 movie file into your Documents directory—and rename it LakeTahoe at the same time—
type this: mv Tahoe1.mov ~/Documents/LakeTahoe.mov.
All the usual shortcuts apply, including the wildcard. Here's how you'd move everything containing the word Tahoe in your 
working directory (files and directories) into your Documents directory: mv *Tahoe* ~/Documents.
15.3.2.2 Option flags
You can follow the mv command with any of these options:
G     -i. Makes Terminal ask your permission before replacing a file with one of the same name.
G     -f. Overwrites like-named files without asking you first. (Actually, this is how mv works if you don't specify 
otherwise.)
G     -n. Doesn't overwrite like-named files; just skips them without prompting.
G     -v. Displays verbose (fully explained) explanations on the screen, letting you know exactly what got moved.
If you use a combination of options that appear to contradict each other—like the -f, -i, and -
n options— the last option (farthest to the right) wins.
By the way, the mv command never replaces a directory with an identically named file. It will copy everything else you've 
asked for, but it skips files that would otherwise wipe out folders.
15.3.3 mkdir: Creating New Directories
In the Finder, you make a new folder by choosing File
New Folder. In Terminal, you create one using the mkdir 
command (for make directory).
Follow the command with the name you want to give the new directory, like this: mkdir 'Early iMovie Attempts' (the single 
quotes in this example let you avoid having to precede each space with a backslash).
The mkdir command creates the new directory in the current working directory, although you can just as easily create it 
anywhere else. Just add the pathname to your argument. To make a new directory in your Documents

If there is no directory called Finished in your Documents directory, you'll just get an error 
message—unless you use the -p option, which creates as many new directories as 
necessary to match your command. For example, mkdir -p '~/Documents/Finished/Early 
iMovie Attempts' would create both a Finished directory and an Early iMovie Attempts 
directory inside it.
15.3.4 touch: Creating Empty Files
To create a new, empty file, type touch filename. For example, to create the file practice.txt in your working directory, use 
touch practice.txt.
And why would you bother? For the moment, you'd use such new, empty files primarily as targets for practicing the next 
command.
15.3.5 rm: Removing Files and Directories
Unix provides an extremely efficient way to trash files and directories. With a single command, rm, you can delete any file or 
directory—or all of those that you're allowed to access with your account type (Admin or Standard).
The dangers of this setup should be obvious, especially in light of the fact that deletions are immediate in Unix. There is no 
Undo, no Empty Trash command, no "Are you sure?" dialog box. In Unix, all sales are final.
The command rm stands for "remove," but could also stand for "respect me." Pause for a moment whenever you're about to 
invoke it. For the purpose of this introduction to rm, double-check that administration privileges are indeed turned off for 
your account.
To use this command, just type rm, a space, and the exact name of the file you want to delete from the working directory. 
To remove the file practice.txt you created with the touch command, for example, you'd just type rm practice.txt. 
To remove a directory and everything in it, add the -r flag, like this: rm -r Practice- Folder.
If you're feeling particularly powerful (and you like taking risks), you can even use wildcards with the rm command. Now, 
many experienced Unix users make it a rule to never userm rm with wildcards while logged in as an administrator, because 
one false keystroke can wipe out everything in a directory. But here, for study purposes only, is the atomic bomb of 
command lines, the one that deletes everything in the working directory: rm -r *.
Be doubly cautious when using wildcards in rm command lines, and triply cautious when 
using them while logged in as an administrator.

15.3 Working with Files and Directories
Just after the letters rm, you can insert options like these:
G     -d deletes any empty directories it finds, in addition to files. (Otherwise, empty directories will trigger an error 
message.)
G     -i (for interactive) makes the Mac ask you for confirmation before nuking each file or directory.
15.3.6 srm: Secure Removal
Behind the scenes, the Finder's new Secure Empty Trash function (Section 2.7.3) actually triggers Unix's srm (secure 
removal) tool. Of course, you can also use srm directly from the command line. One benefit: in Terminal, you can control 
just how thoroughly Mac OS X scrubs the hard drive spot where the deleted file once sat.
The srm utility lets you specify three general levels of deletion:
G     Simple. The -s flag tells srm to perform a simple secure removal, overwriting the deleted material with random data 
just once. It's faster than the Finder's Secure Empty Trash, but not as thorough.
G     Medium. The -m flag designates medium level, which overwrites the unwanted data seven times with various 
types of random and not-so-random data. This is what you get when you use the Finder's Secure Empty Trash 
command, and it's thorough enough to meet U.S. Department of Defense security requirements.
G     Strong. If you don't specify either -s or -m, srm will perform a strong secure removal. That entails recording over 
the spot where the deleted file sat 35 times, each time using a different string of data as specified by the Gutmann 
algorithm. (And what is the Gutmann algorithm? A series of data patterns that make recovery of an erased file 
almost impossible. More than you ever wanted to know is at www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.
html.)
The bottom line: To make sure no one ever, ever reads that poem you typed out for your cat one lonely, bleary-
eyed evening, type srm "My Twinkie.doc". That will be the end of it, and neither the CIA nor Norton Utilities will ever 
know what it was.
15.3.7 echo: The Safety Net
You can make rm or srm less risky by prefacing it with the echo command. It makes Terminal type out the command a 
second time, this time with a handy list of exactly what you're about to obliterate. If you've used wildcards, you'll see the 
names of the files that will be affected by the * character. If you type echo rm -r *, for example (which, without the echo part, 
would normally mean "delete everything in this directory"), you might see a list like this:
rm -r Reviews.doc    Tahoe Footage    Picnic Movie    Contract.doc
Once you've reviewed the list and approved what Terminal is about to do, then you can retype the command without the 
echo portion.
NOTE
The rm command doesn't work on file or directory names that begin with a hyphen (-). To delete these items 
from your working directory, preface their names with a dot slash (./), like this: rm ./-Recipes.doc.

Mac OS X comes with more than 900 Unix programs like the ones described in this chapter. How are you supposed to 
learn what they all do?
Fortunately, almost every Unix program comes with its own little help file. It may not appear within an elegant, brushed-
metal Panther window—in fact, it's pretty darned plain—but it offers much more material than the regular Mac Help Center.
These help files are called user-manual pages, or manpages, which hold descriptions of virtually every command and 
program available. Mac OS X, in fact, comes with manpages on about 5,500 topics—almost 10,000 printed pages' worth.
To move on to the next man screen, press the Space bar. To go back, press the up-arrow key or 
the B key. To close the manual and return to a prompt, press Q. You can also search for a 
certain phrase by typing a / (to produce the "find what?" prompt); thereafter, type n to find the 
next occurrence.
 
Alas, manpages rarely have the clarity of writing or the learner-focused approach you'll find in the Mac Help Center. They're 
generally terse, just-the-facts descriptions. In fact, you'll probably find yourself needing to reread certain sections again and

again. The information they contain, however, is invaluable to new and experienced Unix fans alike, and the effort spent 
mining them is usually worthwhile.
15.4.1 Using man
To access the manpage for a given command, type man followed by the name of the command you're researching. For 
example, to view the manpage for the ls command, enter: man ls. 
The -k option flag lets you search by keyword. For example, man -k appletalk produces a list 
of all manpages that refer to AppleTalk, whereupon you can pick one of the names in the list 
and man that page name.
Now the manual appears, one screen at a time, as shown in Figure 15-7.
A typical manpage begins with these sections:
G     Name. The name and a brief definition of the command.
G     Synopsis. Presents the syntax of the command, including all possible options and arguments, in a concise 
formula. For example, the synopsis for du (disk usage) is as follows: du [-H | -L | -P] [-I mask] [-a | -s | -d depth] [-c] 
[-h | -k] [-x] [file ...].
This shows all the flags available for the du command and how to use them.
Brackets ([ ]) surround the optional arguments. (All of the arguments for du are optional.)
Vertical bars called pipes (|) indicate that you can use only one item (of the group separated by pipes) at a time. 
For example, when choosing options to use with du, you can use either -H, -L, or -P—not two or all three at once.
The word file in the synopsis means "type a pathname here." The ellipsis (...) following it indicates that you're 
allowed to type more than one pathname.
G     Description. Explains in more detail what the command does and how it works. Often, the description includes the 
complete list of that command's option flags.
For more information on using man, view its own manpage by entering—what else?—man man.
The free program ManOpen, available for download at www.missingmanuals.com is a Cocoa 
manualpages reader that provides a nice looking, easier-to-control window for reading 
manpages.

Sometimes Terminal shoves a little bit of user-manual right under your nose—when it thinks you're having trouble. For 
example, if you use the mkdir command without specifying a pathname, mkdir interrupts the proceedings by displaying its 
own synopsis as a friendly reminder (subtext: "Um, this is how you're supposed to use me"), like this: usage: mkdir [-pv] [-m 
mode] directory...

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
Like most applications, Terminal has a Preferences command. You use it, among other things, to switch from bash to a 
different shell. (Turn on "Execute this command" and then type /bin/bash for bash, or /bin/csh for tsch. Then open a new 
Terminal window.)
However, you'll access most of Terminal's settings from the Terminal
Window Settings command instead; the Terminal 
Inspector window opens. If you spend endless hours staring at the Terminal screen, as most Unix junkies do, you'll 
eventually be grateful for the preference settings that let you control how Terminal looks and acts.
Most of the options here are self-explanatory, but here are a few worth noting.
15.5.1 Window Settings
When you choose Terminal
Window Settings, the Terminal Inspector window appears (Figure 15-8).
Changes you make in the Terminal Inspector window affect only the active window, so you 
can change each open window independently. Clicking Use Settings as Default, on the other 
hand, applies the changes to the active window and all subsequent Terminal windows you 
open.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
.term Files
Once you've got a few windows open—your main Terminal window, a couple of man (user-manual) windows, 
a top window showing all the running programs, and so on—you may get dizzy just looking at the seas of 
black-on-white type. One easy solution is to customize the colors, fonts, and positions of your favorite 
windows, and then make Terminal take a snapshot of that configuration.
A Terminal .term file stores the size, location, and visible/ invisible status of all windows that are open when 
you create the .term file. It also stores each window's preference settings, including its Font, Title Bar, and 
Colors settings. (It doesn't store any text in these windows.) Once you've saved a startup file, you can open it 
again anytime to replicate your saved window layout in Terminal.
To create a .term file, choose Terminal
Window Settings. Set up your preferences the way you like them, 
and then choose File
Use Settings as Defaults. Then open and arrange Terminal windows the way you 
like them, using the Terminal Inspector, if you like, to make different settings for different windows.
Next, choose File
Save. Use the pop-up menu in the Save dialog box to choose whether you want to 
save the settings for only the Main window (the active window) or for all windows. In this same dialog box, you 
can also choose to have the saved .term file opened when Terminal launches. (If so, the settings stored with 
the .term file override any settings you've made in the Terminal Inspector.)

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
You can even include a command line for Terminal to run when this .term file is opened. Just click "Execute 
this command," type the command into the box, and, if you want the Terminal window to stay opened when 
the command's done, also turn on "Execute command in a shell."
The best place to store .term files is in your home directory's Library/Application Support/Terminal folder. (You 
may have to create the Terminal directory yourself.) Files saved there appear automatically in the 
File
Library menu for quick access.
Using the pop-up menu at the top, you can choose any of the following panels:
15.5.1.1 Shell
When you're finished fooling around in Terminal, you end your session either by closing the window, or more properly, by 
typing exit (or pressing Control-D) at the prompt. The "When the Shell Exits" setting determines what happens when you do 
that.
To access the Terminal Inspector, choose Terminal
 Window Settings (or press 
-I). This 
window is like a Preferences dialog box with many panes, which you navigate by choosing 
from the pop-up menu at the top. Two of its panels are shown here.

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
 
15.5.1.2 Processes
Shell commands can take some time to complete. If you close a Terminal window before its work is finished, you cancel the 
process and lose your work. The options here let you configure Terminal to monitor such active processes, and warn you if 
closing the window or quitting will sacrifice any work.
15.5.1.3 Emulation
These options pertain to Terminal's impersonation of a traditional, metal-and-silicon terminal. Among the most useful 
options:
G     Option click to position cursor. This selection lets you move your insertion point on the command line by Option-
clicking.
G     Visual Bell. Terminal generally beeps to let you know when you've typed something it can't understand. If you're 
keeping your roommates awake with constant beeping, then select Visual Bell here, which quietly flashes the 
Terminal window instead.

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
15.5.1.4 Buffer
As your command line activity fills the Terminal window with text, older lines at top disappear from view. So that you can get 
back to these previous lines for viewing, copying, or printing, Terminal offers a Scrollback Buffer, which sets aside a certain 
amount of memory to store previous lines and adds a scroll bar so you can access them.
Although it may be tempting to set the buffer to Unlimited, restrain yourself; you'll only 
increase Terminal's memory use. 10,000 lines should be plenty.
15.5.1.5 Display
Here's where you control what the insertion point looks like, along with settings like these:
G     Text. No matter what font you choose for your future Terminal sessions, note that characters in successive rows of 
text will line up with each other, monospaced as though they're all Monaco or Courier.
G     Anti-aliasing. Select here to turn on font smoothing if you find that easier to read.
15.5.1.6 Color
People who spend long hours in Terminal revel in its ability to serve as a software chameleon, changing its look to suit 
offbeat tastes (and sore eyes). For example, you can specify the colors of the type and background by selecting a 
predetermined set from the "Standard color selections" pop-up menu. Or, if you're truly discriminating, you can dream up 
your own color schemes by clicking the color swatches and making selections from the Color Picker (Section 4.10.4).
If you're truly an extremist, you can click "Use an image for the background" (and then the Set button) to choose a picture 
file to fill your background instead.
Actually, there's a more entertaining way to choose a background color. Choose 
Font
Show Colors; in the Colors dialog box, choose the color you want. Finally, drag the 
color rectangle at top into any empty area of the Terminal window (or into one of the "color 
wells" in the Terminal Inspector window). Boom! It changes color to match.
You can also make your Terminal windows translucent, a sure way to make novices fall to their knees in awe. Just drag the 
slider to the right and watch the background of the active window nearly disappear, like the Cheshire Cat, leaving only text.
Is this really useful? You'd have to do quite a bit of stretching to imagine how. Still, the effect is really neat, especially when 
you consider the drop shadows and other lighting effects that are still visible at the window edges.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-15-SECT-5.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 5:04:28 AM

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
This effect looks especially cool if you make the Terminal window black with white or yellow 
writing.
15.5.1.7 Window
The Dimensions boxes affect the width in characters (columns) and height in lines (rows) of new Terminal windows. (Of 
course, you can always resize an existing window by dragging its lower-right corner. As you drag, the title bar displays the 
window's current dimensions.)
In the Title section, turn on the elements that you'd like the current Terminal window to display in the title bar. Remember, 
your preferences can be different for each Terminal window; you might therefore want the windows' title bars to identify the 
differences.
15.5.1.8 Keyboard
These controls let you choose keyboard shortcuts that help you navigate your Terminal window, or that send strings of 
canned text to the shell. As your Unix prowess grows, these shortcuts will become more useful.
15.5.2 Connect to Server
When you use Terminal to connect to other computers across a network—a common Terminal task—you use commands 
like ssh and ftp in conjunction with another computer's IP address. For example, you might type ssh 192.168.43.76. 
The trouble is, these IP addresses are hard to remember—and they may actually change over time. In Panther, though, 
Apple has brought the magic of Rendezvous—a networking feature in which Macs announce their presence to the network, 
using their plain-English names—to Terminal. Now you can browse other Panther computers on your network just as you'd 
browse them in the Finder (Chapter 12).
To get started, choose File
Connect to Server. Continue as shown in Figure 15-9.
From the left side, choose the service you want; from the right, you can choose from a list of 
Panther machines whose Remote Login and FTP checkboxes are turned on in the Sharing 
panel of System Preferences. Type your account name into the User box. As you adjust the 
connection options, the box at the bottom shows the Unix command that you're building. Click 
Connect to open a new Terminal window and send that command inside it.

15.5 Terminal's Window Preferences
 
Even if the remote machine isn't running Panther, you can still add its address to the Server 
list manually by clicking the + button below it. Likewise, all command lines entered in the 
bottom field get added to the pop-up menu beside it, allowing you to quickly reconnect 
without having to use the browse list at all.

15.6 Terminal Tips and Tricks
After you've used Terminal awhile, you may feel ready for a few of these power tips.
15.6.1 Switching Windows
You can switch among your various Terminal windows by pressing 
-1, 
-2, and so on (up to 
-9). You'll be able to 
identify the windows easily if you choose to include the Command key in the title bars (use the Window section of the 
Terminal Inspector).
15.6.2 Default .term File
After you've changed Terminal's preferences, it's not easy to get the factory settings back—unless you first save them in a .
term file.
If you've already made changes to your Terminal's preferences, quit Terminal and temporarily remove its property list 
(preferences) file, called com.apple.Terminal. plist, from your Home folder
Library
Preferences folder. Drag it out 
of the Finder window to the desktop, for example.
Next, reopen Terminal, where you'll find that all original settings have been restored. Save this window as a .term file 
named Default (see Section 15.5). Finally, quit Terminal and replace the newly created property list file (com.apple.Terminal.
plist) with the one you removed initially.
When you next open Terminal, you'll have your old preferences back—and a new Default item in your Library menu that will 
always open a factory-fresh Terminal window. (You may even consider locking the Default startup file, by opening its Get 
Info dialog box in the Finder and turning on the Locked checkbox.)

15.7 Double-Clickable Unix Tools
Most people are used to thinking of Unix applications as programs you run from within Terminal. Many, though, appear in 
the Finder as regular old icons—and in Panther, you can open them by double-clicking, just as you would a traditional Mac 
OS X program. This trick isn't very useful for commands that require flags. But for some, like cal, clicking provides a quick 
way to run the program, especially if you keep it in your Dock.
To double-click a Unix program, though, you first have to find it—and that may not be easy. Mac OS X's Unix directory 
structure is labyrinthine indeed.
But why not ask Terminal where the program is? You can do exactly that using the which command: which cal, for example. 
Terminal responds with /usr/bin/cal, telling you that cal resides in the /usr/bin directory.
To get there, use the open command in Terminal, like this: open /usr/bin. A Finder window opens revealing the cal icon. 
Drag the icon to the right side of the Dock.
From now on, when you click that Dock icon, a new Terminal window opens, automatically displaying this month's calendar. 
You've shaved several precious seconds off the time it would have taken you to open iCal.

Chapter 16. Fun with Unix
Chapter 15 shows you the basics of using the command line instead of the Finder for getting around and manipulating files 
and directories. But nobody would use Terminal if all it could do was move files around. Terminal, like Unix, is much more 
powerful than that.
This chapter, which assumes that you're already familiar with the Unix commands introduced in Chapter 15, offers guided 
tutorials for performing more specialized tasks—some of which you can't do in the Finder. These procedures, and the 
commands you need to perform them, are also starting points for further learning.

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
Permissions is a largely invisible, but hugely important, Mac OS X and Unix feature. The behind-the-scenes permissions 
setting for a file or folder determines whether or not you're allowed to open it, change it, or delete it. Permissions are the 
cornerstone of several important Mac OS X features, including the separation of user accounts and the relative 
invulnerability of the operating system itself.
You can get a good glimpse at the permissions settings of a file or folder in the Get Info box; see Section 12.2.10 for a 
discussion. But even there, you're not seeing all of the permission settings Unix provides, and every now and then, you 
might want to. Suppose, for example, that you're a teacher in charge of a computer lab containing 25 Macs. On each 
computer, you've created Standard accounts (see Chapter 11) for five students each, for a total of 125 student accounts.
Soon after the students start using the lab, you notice a bit more giggling and frantic typing then you'd expect from students 
researching Depression-era economics. Younonchalantly stroll to the end of the room and do a quick about-face at one of 
the desks. Aha—iChat! Horribly depressed by the comments you read there regarding your fashion sense, you vow to keep 
students from using that application ever again.
You have several options:
G     Delete iChat from the Applications folder. Unfortunately, the Computer Club meets in your classroom after 
school, and its members routinely use iChat to communicate. (Talking out loud, after all, is so twentieth century.)
G     Use Account Limitations. You could open System Preferences, click Accounts, click Limitations, turn on Some 
Limits, and turn off the iChat checkbox. Repeat 124 times.
G     Use Terminal. Go to a Mac, fire up Terminal, and type a quick command to turn off iChat's execute permissions for 
Standard account holders. (This process won't affect the Computer Club, because its members all have 
Administrator accounts.) Repeat only 24 times.
In fact, if walking to each machine is too much work, you could even use the ssh technique described in Chapter 21 
to run the command remotely from a single machine, while seated in the comfort of your own teacher's chair.
It'll take several pages to work through this example. But in the process, you'll learn an amazing amount about Terminal 
and the Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X.
16.1.1 Looking at Permissions
In general, when you double-click a file icon in the Finder, it opens either as a program or opens into a program (if it's a 
document).
But as noted in Section 4.2, most Mac OS X application icons in the Finder are really folders posing as single files. Inside 
the folder, or package, are all the files that application depends on to run, including the actual application file itself, the one 
that opens when you double-click the package icon. If you turn off the execute permission for that inner nugget, you prevent 
it from running—and, as in this classroom example, you can turn it off only for certain kinds of account holders.
To inspect the permissions for iChat, open the Applications folder. Control-click the iChat icon. From the contextual menu 
that appears, choose Show Package Contents. When you do, a new Finder window opens, revealing the contents of the 
iChat application package.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-1.html (1 of 10)5/3/2004 5:04:39 AM

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
Open the Contents
MacOS folder, and inside you'll find the individual iChat program file. (Nobody would ever bother 
opening iChat by double-clicking this icon, but it's possible.) You could inspect its permissions by highlighting the inner 
iChat icon and then choosing File
Get Info. Expand the Ownership and Permissions section, and then the Details 
section.
Now try the same thing the Unix way. To view the ownership and permissions information within Terminal, use the ls 
command like this:
                ls -l /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/MacOS
The -l flag produces a long list—an expanded display showing extra information about each item in the directory, in this 
case its single iChat file.
Terminal's response is something like this:
                total 592
-rwxrwxr-x 1 root admin 302080 27 Sep 03:04 iChat
Thanks to the -l option, the first line displays the grand total size of all the loose files in the directory: 592. (It's measured in 
512-byte blocks. If you also included the -k flag, you would see this measurement in kilobytes.)
Next you see the name of the one inhabitant of the MacOS directory: iChat. (If there were more, you would see each item 
on its own line.)
But what on earth is -rwxrwxr-x? Is Terminal having a meltdown?
Not at all; you're just seeing more Unix shorthand, listed in what are supposed to be helpful columns. Figure 16-3 breaks 
down the meaning of each clump of text.
G     Type. The first character of the line indicates the file type—usually d (a directory), l (a symbolic link—the Unix 
version of an alias), or, as in this case, a hyphen (a file).
G     File Mode. Rammed together with the type (like this: rwxrwxr-x) is a string of nine characters. It indicates, in a 
coded format, the actual access permissions for that item, as described in the next section.
G     Owner. Terminal's response also identifies the account name of whoever owns this file or directory, which is 
usually whoever created it. Remember that root means that Mac OS X itself owns it. That's why even 
administrators generally aren't allowed to delete directories that bear "root" ownership.
NOTE
In the Finder's Get Info windows, you may see ownership listed as System. That's Apple's kinder, gentler 
term for root.
G     Group. After the owner comes the name of the group that owns this file or directory. "Wheel," as in "big wheel," 
indicates the group with the highest powers (administrators are not part of this group); the "admin" group contains 
all administrators.

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
NOTE
If you inspect the icons in a Home directory, you'll find that they belong to a group that's named after your 
account. When you created an account named chris, Mac OS X created a chris group (with only one 
member), and makes every new icon part of it.
Everything in Chris's Home directory, then, has chris as both owner and group, which ensures greater 
security than previous versions of Mac OS X. (In those versions, everyone belonged to a common group 
called staff, and everyone's files were owned by that group. In fact, if you've upgraded from Jaguar, you'll 
find that your old Home-folder icons are still owned by the staff group.)
G     Pathname. At the end of the line (following the file's size and date) comes the path of this file or directory, relative 
to the listed directory.
Here's one magnified line of what the ls -al command produces. The parts you care about are in 
gray.
 
16.1.2 File-Mode Code
To understand the coded nine-character file mode section, you need a good grasp of the topics covered in Chapter 11. 
There you'll find out that as you create new files and directories, you can specify who else is allowed to see or make 
changes to them. In fact, you can specify these permissions for three different categories of people: the owner (usually 
yourself), your group (Section 12.4), and everyone else.
The file mode column is made of three subcolumns (Figure 16-2), which correspond to those same three categories of 
people: owner, group, and everybody else.
Within each sequence, three characters describe the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions that this person or 
group has to this file or directory (more on these concepts in a moment). A hyphen (-) means, "Nope, this person isn't 
allowed this kind of access." In Figure 16-2, you can see that, if you were the owner of this file, you could do everything you 
want to it—because there are no hyphens.
If you look very closely and move your nose right up against the screen, you'll see that the file-
mode column isn't just a string of random letters—it's three distinct sets of information that tell

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
you who's allowed to do what.
 
There's an x in all other columns too, meaning that anyone can execute (launch) this file. Since there's also a w in both the 
owner and group columns, those user categories could, in theory, even make changes to the file (although there would 
never be a reason to do so).
The three forms of access—read, write, and execute—have slightly different meanings when applied to files and directories:
G     Read access to a file means that someone can open and read it. (In the case of a program like iChat, the system 
needs to "read" the file on your behalf in order to run it.) Read access to a directory (folder), on the other hand, just 
means that someone using Terminal can see a list of its contents using a command like ls.
G     Write access to a file means that someone can modify and save changes to it. Write access to a directory means 
that someone can add, remove, and rename any item the folder contains (but not necessarily the items within its 
subdirectories).
NOTE
Turning off write access to a certain file doesn't protect it from deletion. As long as write access is turned on 
for the folder it's in, the file is still trashable.
To protect a certain file from deletion, in other words, you must also worry about the access settings of the 
folder that encloses it.
G     Execute access, when applied to an application, means that people can run that particular program. (In fact, Unix 
distinguishes applications from ordinary files by checking the status of this setting.) 
Of course, you can't very well "run" a directory. If this x bit is turned on for a directory, it's called the searchable bit 
(as opposed to the execute access bit), and it means that you can make it the working directory, using the cd 
command. You still can't see what's in the folder if you don't also have read permissions, but you're welcome to 
read or copy a file in it as long as you know its full pathname.
16.1.3 Group Detective Work
Back to the task of keeping iChat from launching. The x in every user category tells you that anyone can run this program. 
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to change these settings so that one class of account holder can run iChat 
(Admin), but not another (Standard).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-1.html (4 of 10)5/3/2004 5:04:39 AM

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
As you've seen, every file's set of permissions identifies both an owner and a group. The group that owns the iChat file is 
admin. As you would expect, the Admin class of users is part of the admin group, so Administrators and anyone else in the 
admin group will have no trouble running the program.
You just have to make sure that no other account holders—Standard ones—are also part of the admin group. That's easy 
enough to find out.
To find out what Unix groups you belong to, type groups in Terminal and press Enter. On the next line, Terminal types out a 
list of the groups that include your account; if you have an Administrator account, it's probably admin, appserverusr, 
appserveradm, plus the one named for your account (chris, for example).
But you want to find what groups incorporate Standard account holders. To find out what groups someone else's account 
belongs to, type groups robin (or whatever the account name is). You'll probably see that Robin belongs only to the Robin 
group. And, in fact, you would find this to be true for all Standard account holders.
All right then: The admin group contains only Admin users. As far as permissions are concerned, then, Standard account 
holders fall into the everyone else category.
You just need to turn off iChat's execute permissions for everyone else, then, to complete your task. Doing so will only allow 
the file's owner (root) and members of its group (admin) to execute the file (that is, to open the program). All other account 
holders—that is, Standard account holders—will be out of luck. They'll actually have to pay attention in class.
16.1.3.1 chmod (Change Mode)
The Unix command for changing file modes (permissions) is chmod (for change mode).
Here's the command you'll use on the iChat file:
                chmod o-x /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/MacOS/iChat
And here's how to understand it.
The command line begins, naturally, with the chmod command itself, and ends with the pathname of the iChat file.
In between are three characters that make up the three parts of a mode-change clause: o-x.
The first character, o, represents the class of user that the change affects. In this spot, you can type u to symbolize the file's 
owner, g for its group, o for other (everyone else), and a to indicate all three classes at once.
The second character represents the operation to perform, which in most cases is to either to add a permission (use the + 
symbol) or remove one (use the - sign).
The final character specifies which permission to change: r for read, w for write, or x for execute.
The complete chmod command provided above, then, says: "Remove the execute permissions for others," which is 
precisely what you want to do.
16.1.4 Permission to Change Permissions
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-1.html (5 of 10)5/3/2004 5:04:39 AM

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
If you actually try the chmod command described above, however, you'll get only an error message ("Operation not 
permitted").
Only the owner of an item can change its permissions. And you're not iChat's owner; root is (that is, Mac OS X itself).
So how do you solve the problem? One solution would be to turn on the root account as described in Section 11.8, and 
then log on as root. Then you'd be the superuser and could do any darned thing you like. But not only is that a lot of time 
and hassle, involving a trip to the NetInfo Manager program and logging out, but it's also an extreme step; turning on the 
root account always entails a security risk.
Instead, you could always open the Get Info window for the iChat application file, make yourself the owner, and then type in 
your name and password to prove you're an administrator. Then open Terminal, use the chmod command now that you're 
the file's owner, return to the Finder, open Get Info again, and change the file's permissions back to root.
But for a Unix guru, that's an awful lot of steps for something that should take only a few keystrokes. As it turns out, the final 
possibility is quick and easy, which explains its popularity in Unix circles. It's the sudo command.
16.1.4.1 sudo
sudo is a great command name. Technically, it's short for superuser do , which means that you're allowed to execute any 
command as though you'd logged in with the root (superuser) account—but without actually having to turn on the root 
account, log out, log back in again, and so on.
It's also a great command name because it looks as though it would be pronounced "pseudo," as in, "I'm just pretending to 
be the root user for a moment. I'm here under a pseudonym." (In fact, you pronounce it "SOO-doo," because it comes from 
superuser do. In the privacy of your own brain, though, you can pronounce it however you like.)
NOTE
Only people with Administrator accounts can use the sudo command.
If you have the root account—or can simulate one using sudo—you can override any permissions settings, including the 
ones that prevent you from changing things in the Applications directory (like iChat).
Finally, you're ready to change the permissions of that infernal iChat application file. To use sudo, you must preface an 
entire command line with sudo and a space. Type this:
                sudo chmod o-x /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/MacOS/iChat
Taken slowly, this command breaks down as follows:
G     sudo "Give me the power to do whatever I want."
G     chmod. "Change the file mode..."
G     o-x. "...in this way: remove execute permission for others..."
G     /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/MacOS/iChat /. "...from the file called iChat, which is inside the 
Applications
iChat.app
Contents
MacOS folder."

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
The first time you run sudo, you're treated to the characteristic deadpan humor of programmers worldwide: "We trust you 
have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these two things: 1) Respect 
the privacy of others, and 2) Think before you type."
In other words, sudo is a powerful tool that lets you tromp unfettered across delicate parts of Mac OS X, so you should 
proceed with caution. At the outset, at least, you should use it only when you've been given specific steps to follow, as in 
this chapter.
Now sudo asks for your usual login password, just to confirm that you're not some seventh-grader up to no good. If you are 
indeed an administrator, and your password checks out, sudo gives you a five-minute window in which, by prefacing each 
command with sudo, you can move around as though you're the all-high, master root account holder. (If you don't use sudo 
again within a five-minute span, you have to input your password again.)
Now whenever anyone who isn't an administrator tries to open iChat, its icon bounces just once in the Dock before dying 
painlessly.
To restore its original permissions, use the same command, but replace the - with a +, like this:
                sudo chmod o+x /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/MacOS/iChat
NOTE
Whenever Mac OS X's Repair Permissions function is run (either automatically—which happens each time 
you install a Mac OS X update—or manually, using Disk Utility), iChat returns to its original permissions 
settings. You'll have to rerun the command if you want its protections in place.
16.1.5 Protecting Files En Masse
It could happen to you. You've got yourself a folder filled with hundreds of files— downloaded photos from your digital 
camera, for example. Most are pretty crummy, but the ones you took in Tahoe (and therefore have Tahoe in their file 
names) are spectacular. You want to protect those files from deletion without having to turn on the Locked checkbox 
(Section 2.8) of every file individually.
Here again, you could operate in the Finder, just like ordinary mortals. You could use the Find command to round up all files 
with Tahoe in their names, highlight all of them in the search results window, choose File
Get Info, and turn on Locked, 
thus protecting all of them at once. But doing it the Unix way builds character.

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
UP TO SPEED
Beware the Dread Typo
Use sudo with caution, especially with the rm command. Even a single typing error in a sudo rm command 
can be disastrous.
Suppose, for example, that you intended to type this:
sudo rm -ri /Users/Jim/Pictures 
—but you accidentally inserted a space after the first slash, like this:
sudo rm -ri /Users/Jim/Pictures 
You've just told Terminal to delete all data on all drives! 
Because of the extra space, the rm command sees its first pathname argument as being only /, the root 
directory. The -r flag means "and all directories inside it."
Good thing you added the -i flag, which instructs Mac OS X to ask you for confirmation before deleting each 
directory. It's almost always a good idea to include -i whenever you use sudo with rm.
History buffs (and Unix fans) may remember that Apple's first iTunes 2 installer, released in October 2001, 
contained a tiny bug: the tendency to erase people's hard drives. (Oops!) Apple hastily withdrew the installer 
and replaced it with a fixed one. But behind the scenes, an improperly formed rm command was the culprit.
When you turn on a file's Locked checkbox, Mac OS X turns on an invisible switch known to Unix veterans as the user 
immutable flag. Not even the superuser is allowed to change, move, or delete a file whose user is turned on.
The command you need to change such flags is chflags—short for change flags, of course. You can always read its man 
manual (see Section 15.4.1) to learn all the different flags it can change; for now, though, all you care about is the user 
immutable flag.
You can follow the chflags command with three arguments: its own option flags, the file flags, and the pathname of the file 
whose flags are being changed. In this case, the flag you care about is called uchg (short for user changeable; in other 
words, this is the immutable flag).
To protect all of the Tahoe shots in one fell swoop, then, here's what you'd type at the prompt:
                chflags uchg ~/Pictures/*Tahoe*
The asterisks are wild cards that mean, "all files containing the word Tahoe in their names." So in English, you've just said, 
"Change the immutable flag (the Locked checkbox setting) for all the Tahoe files in my Pictures folder to 'locked.'"

16.1 Changing Permissions with Terminal
To unlock a file, thus turning off its uchg flag, just add the word "no," like this: chflags no 
uchg ~/ Pictures/*Tahoe*.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
.command Files
You can help to combat repetitive stress syndrome by saving any long, often-typed, command line as a .
command file. Double-clicking the file will open a new Terminal window, perform the command, and then exit 
the shell—all automatically.
Creating .command files requires two steps.
First, create a new document in a text editor like TextEdit. (Check TextEdit
Preferences to make sure you 
create a plain-text document.)
Type in the entire command that you want to memorialize (sudo chmod o+x /Applications/iChat.app/Contents/
MacOS/ iChat, for example). Save the document with a name ending with the .command extension—for 
example, iChatOff .command. (As a bonus, documents with this extension appear with a spiffy icon in the 
Finder.)
Next, you'll need to make that file itself executable by using the chmod command, as described previously. If, 
for example, you want only the owner of the iChatOff.command file to be able to execute it (that is, you), you 
would type: chmod u+x iChatOff.command.
Thereafter, you can simply double-click the .command file to open and run it. (Since you used the sudo 
command in this example, you'll first have to provide your password.)
If the object of the .command file's attention sits in the same location on each Mac, you could even burn the 
iChatOff. command to a CD, roam to each machine, insert the CD, and double-click the .command file, thus 
further reducing the amount of effort required to apply its magic to many Macs.
To see the results of your handiwork, you can always switch to the Finder, where you'll see that the Tahoe files now have 
their Locked checkboxes turned on. Or, to confirm your work right in Terminal, issue this command: ls -lo ~/Pictures (or any 
other path to a folder containing locked items). That's the familiar ls (list) command that shows you what's in a certain 
directory, followed by an -l flag for a more complete listing, and an -o flag that produces a "flags" column in the resulting 
table.
In any case, Terminal might spit out something like this:
                total 830064
-rw-r—r—1 chris chris - 158280000 Jun 16 20:05 Sunset.jpg

-rw-r—r—1 chris chris uchg 100560000 Jun 16 20:05 Buddy.jpg
The fifth column, the product of the -o flag, lists any file flags that have been set for each file. In this case, three of the files 
are listed with uchg, which represents the user immutable (locked) flag. (The hyphen for the first listed file means "no 
flags"—that is, not locked.)

16.2 Enabling the Root Account
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
16.2 Enabling the Root Account
Only one person is allowed to clomp through any Mac OS X directory, unfettered and unrestricted: whoever holds the root 
(superuser) account. There are two ways to turn on this usually hidden account: the NetInfo way (see Section 11.8) and the 
Unix way.
To enable the root account in Terminal, all you have to do is make up a password for the dormant account using the 
passwd command.
Normal account holders can use passwd to change their own passwords (although the Accounts pane of System 
Preferences strikes most people as a more direct way to do so). To change your own password, for example, just type 
passwd and press Enter. You'll be asked to type your old password, and then the new one twice.
NOTE
As you type your old and new password, no typing appears onscreen. That's a safeguard against people 
peeking over your shoulder as you type.
The superuser, on the other hand, can change anyone's password—including the root account's password. Fortunately, so 
can an administrator using sudo, like this:
                sudo passwd root
At this point, sudo will prompt you for your password to confirm that you're actually an administrator. After you've entered it, 
the passwd utility will prompt you to enter a new password for the root account. Make it a good one: no spaces, at least four 
characters long.
If you ever lose the root account password, you can set up a new one by starting up the Mac 
from the Mac OS X installer CD. From the Installer menu, choose Reset Password.
Once the root account has a password, you can use it to log in with the user name root, exactly as though it's a normal 
account. When you do, you'll find that the root account's Home folder isn't in the Users folder like everyone else's; instead, 
it's in the private
var folder. You'll also find, of course, that you have complete freedom to modify, move, or change 
access privileges for any file and folder on your system.
NOTE
Not only is your system at risk of inadvertent damage when you log in as root, but some applications may 
behave oddly when run by the root account. Therefore, you should log in to Mac OS X as the superuser only 
when you have a specific job to do, and log out as soon as you've completed the task.

16.3 Nine Useful Unix Utilities
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
16.3 Nine Useful Unix Utilities
So far, you've read about only a handful of the hundreds of Unix programs that are built into Mac OS X and ready to run. 
Yes, ls and sudo are very useful tools, but they're only the beginning. Here's a rundown of some more cool (and very safe) 
programs that await your experimentation.
If you don't return to the $ prompt after using one of these commands, type q or, in some 
cases, quit; then hit Enter.
16.3.1 bc
Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows aren't the only operating systems that come with a basic calculator accessory; Unix is 
well equipped in this regard, too.
When you type bc and hit Enter, you get a copyright notice and then...nothing. Just type the equation you want to solve, 
such as 2+2, or 95+97+456+2-65, or (2*3)+165- 95*(2.5*2.5), and then press Enter. On the next line, bc instantly displays 
the result of your calculation.
(In computer land, * designates multiplication and / represents division. Note, too, that bc solves equations correctly; it 
calculates multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, and inner parentheses before the outer ones. For 
more bc tricks and tips, type man bc at the prompt.)
16.3.2 kill
Mac OS X offers no shortage of ways to cut the cord on a program that seems to be locked up. You can force quit it 
(Section 4.1.2), use Activity Monitor (Section 9.25.1.1), or use kill.
The kill program in Terminal simply force quits a program, as though by remote control. (It even works when you telnet or 
SSH into your Mac from a remote location, as described in Chapter 21.) All you have to do is follow the kill command with 
the ID number of the program you want to terminate.
And how do you know its ID number? You start by running top—described in a moment —whose first column shows the 
PID (process ID) of every running program.
Unless you also use sudo, you can kill only programs that you "own"—those that are running 
under your account. (The operating system itself—root—is always running programs of its 
own, and it's technically possible that other people, dialing in from the road, are running 
programs of their own even while you're using the Mac!)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-3.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 5:04:44 AM

16.3 Nine Useful Unix Utilities
When you hear Unix fans talk about kill online, they often indicate a number flag after the command, like this: kill -9. This 
flag is a "non-catchable, non-ignorable kill." In other words, it's an industrial-strength assassin that accepts no pleas for 
mercy from the program you're killing.
If you check top and find out that BeeKeeper Pro's process ID is 753, you'd abort it by typing kill -9 753 and then pressing 
Enter.
16.3.3 open
What operating system would be complete without a way to launch programs? In Mac OS X's version of Unix, the 
command is easy enough: open -a, as in open -a Chess. The -a flag allows you to specify an application by name, 
regardless of where it is on your hard drive. You can even specify which document you want to open into that program by 
adding a space and then the document's name, like this: open -a Preview MyGraphic.tif. 
The -e flag opens any text document in TextEdit, like this: open -e Diary.txt. This shortcut 
saves you from having to specify TextEdit itself.
The real utility of this command might not be apparent at first, but imagine doing something like this in the Finder: Select 
from a folder of hundreds of HTML files those that contain the word "Sequoia" in their file names and preview them all with 
the OmniWeb browser, regardless of what application they're actually associated with. You could do it with the help of the 
Finder's Find command, but that would take quite a few steps. In Terminal, though, you just switch to that directory (using 
the cd command) and type, open -a OmniWeb *Sequoia*. Done!
Of course, you may not often find use in simply launching programs and documents this way. But you can see how useful 
open can be when you're writing automated scripts for your Mac, like those used by the cron command scheduler program 
(Section 16.4.1.5).
16.3.4 ps
The ps (process status) command is another way to get a quick look at all the programs running on your Mac, even the 
usually invisible ones, complete with their ID numbers. (For the most helpful results, use the -a, -u, -x, and -w flags like this: 
ps -auxw. For a complete description of these and other flags, type man ps and hit Enter.)
16.3.5 shutdown
It's perfectly easy to shut down your Mac from the 
 menu. But using shutdown in Terminal has its advantages. For one 
thing, you can control when the shutdown occurs, using one of these three flags:
G     Now. You can safely shut down by typing shutdown now. (Actually, only the root user is allowed to use shutdown, 
so you'd really type sudo shutdown now and then type in your administrator's password when asked.)
G     Later today. The -h flag means, "shut down at the time I specify." Typing sudo shutdown -h 2330, for example, 
shuts down your machine at 11:30 p.m. today (2330 is military-time notation for 11:30 p.m.).
G     Any time in the next 100 years. To make the machine shut down at 5:00 p.m. on November 5, 2004, for example, 
you could type sudo shutdown 0411051700. (That number code is in year [last two digits]:month:date:hour:minute

format. So 0504051700 means 2005, April 5, 5:00 p.m.)
Once you set the auto-shutdown robot in motion, you can't stop it easily. You must use the 
kill command described above to terminate the shutdown process itself. To find out 
shutdown's ID number in order to terminate it, use the top or ps command.
There are still more useful flags. For example:
G     The -r flag means "restart instead of just shutting down," as in sudo shutdown -r now.
G     You can use shutdown to knock all connected network users off your machine without actually shutting down. Use 
the -k flag, like this: sudo shutdown -k now.
One of the most powerful uses of shutdown is turning off Macs by remote control, either from across the network or across 
the world via Internet. That is, you can use telnet or SSH (both described in Chapter 21) to issue this command.
16.3.6 gnutar, gzip, zip
You know how Mac OS X 10.3 can create compressed .zip archive files? (If not, check Section 2.10.3.)
Well, as it turns out, you can "stuff " files from within Terminal, too. Actually, you don't encounter StuffIt files much in the 
Unix world, since they're a Macintosh convention. You're much more likely to run across tar (for combining) and gzip (for 
compressing) files. And in Windows, people are most familiar with zip files (for combining and compressing).
Terminal lets you stuff and combine files in these formats with the greatest of ease. To compress a file, just type gzip, a 
space, and then the pathname of the file you want to compress (or drag the file directly from the desktop into the Terminal 
window). When you press Enter or Return, Mac OS X compresses the file.
"Tarring" a folder (combining its contents into a single file) is only slightly more complicated. You have to specify both the 
resulting file's name, followed by the actual directory pathname, like this: gnutar -cf Memos.tar /Users/chris/Memos. Add the 
-z flag if you want to tar and compress the folder: gnutar -czf Memos.tar.gz /Users/ chris/Memos.
To combine and compress files using zip, just specify a name for the zip file and the names of the items to zip, like this: zip 
StaffordLake.zip Stafford* (which would cram all files in the working directory whose name begins with Stafford into a single 
archive).
To zip a folder, include the -r flag as well: zip -r Memos /Users/chris/Memos.
In any case, if you switch to the Finder, you'll see that the file or folder you specified is now compressed (with the suffix .gz), 
combined (with the suffix .tar), or both (with the suffix tar.gz or .zip).
Unfortunately, none of these utilities handles resource forks properly (Section 15.3.5). (The Finder's Create Archive 
command does, though.) If you can't bear to be away from Terminal, you can use hfstar, a Unix utility that properly 
combines files with resource forks. (You can download it from www.metaobject.com/Products.html.)
You can also use these utilities to open combined and compressed files, but they can easily overwrite existing items of the

16.3 Nine Useful Unix Utilities
same name if you're not careful. Use StuffIt Expander to eliminate that worry.
NOTE
The gzip command deletes the original file after gzipping it. The gnutar and zip commands, on the other 
hand, "stuff" things but leave the originals alone.
16.3.7 top
When you type top and press Enter, you get a handy table that lists every program that's currently running on your Mac, 
including the obscure background ones you may not even know exist (Figure 16-3). (To be more specific, you get the top 
20 or so. Make the window taller to see the rest.)
The top display remains onscreen, automatically updating itself as you work, until you type q to 
quit the program. The plain-English program names are in there somewhere...
 
You also get statistics that tell you how much memory and speed (CPU power) they're sucking down. In this regard, top is

16.3 Nine Useful Unix Utilities
similar to Activity Monitor, described in Section 9.25.1.1.
If you type top -u, you get a list sorted by CPU usage, meaning the power-hungry programs 
are listed first. If your Mac ever seems to act sluggish, checking top -u to see what's tying 
things up is a good instinct.

16.4 Where to Go from Here
This crash course in Unix should give you a first helping of guidance—enough to perform some genuinely useful tasks in 
Mac OS X, and to acquire a feeling for how Unix commands work.
There's a lot more to learn, however. As you peruse beginner-level Unix books and Web sites (see Appendix E), for 
example, you'll gradually become familiar with a variety of important terms and tools.
16.4.1 Aliases
Don't be confused: Aliases in Unix have nothing to do with traditional Macintosh icon aliases. Instead, Unix aliases are 
more like text macros, in that they're longish commands that you can trigger by typing a much shorter abbreviation.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Secrets of Virtual Memory
The top command's table offers a fascinating look at the way Mac OS X manages memory. In the "VM" 
section, for example, you'll see current statistics for pageins and pageouts—that is, how many times the 
virtual-memory system has had to "set down" software code for a moment as it juggles your open programs in 
actual memory. (These numbers are pointed out in Figure 16-3.)
The pageins and pageouts statistics are composed of two different numbers, like this: 45451(0) pageins, 
42946(0) pageouts. The big number tells you how many times your Mac has had to shuffle data in and out of 
memory since the Mac started up. The number in parentheses indicates how much of this shuffling it's done 
within the last second.
This is the number to worry about. If it stays above zero for a while, your Mac is gasping for RAM (as the hard-
drivethrashing sounds and program-switching delays are probably also telling you).
In the listing of individual programs, the last four columns provide details about the memory usage of each 
listed program. The one you care about is the RPRVT (Resident Private) column, which shows how much 
memory each program is actually using at the moment. (If you remember the About This Macintosh memory 
graph of Mac OS 9, then you probably remember the filled portion of the memory bars. That's what this 
number tells you: how much memory each program is actually using.) This number goes up and down as you 
work, and that's the miracle of Mac OS X: Programs don't just grab a chunk of memory and sit with it; they put 
RAM back in the pot when they don't need it.
For example, remember the command for unlocking all the files in a folder? (It was sudo chflags -R nouchg [pathname]. To 
unlock everything in your account's Trash, for example, you'd type sudo chflags -R nouchg ~/.trash.)
Using the alias command, however, you can create a much shorter command (unlock, for example) that has the same 
effect. (The alias command takes two arguments: the alias name you want, and the command it's supposed to type out, like 
this: alias unlock='sudo chflags -R nouchg ~/.trash'.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-4.html (1 of 6)5/3/2004 5:04:47 AM

16.4 Where to Go from Here
On the down side, aliases you create this way linger in Terminal's memory only while you're still in the original Terminal 
window. As soon as you close it, you lose your aliases. When you get better at Unix, therefore, you can learn to create a .
bash_profile or .bashrc file that permanently stores all your command aliases.
16.4.1.1 pico, emacs, vim
One way to create and edit text files containing aliases (and to perform other command- related tasks) is to use pico, a 
popular text editor ( see Figure 16-4).
As you'll discover just by typing pico and pressing Enter, pico is a full-screen Unix application. You enter text in pico much 
as you do in TextEdit or SimpleText, yet pico is filled with features that are especially tailored to working with Unix tasks and 
commands.
Nor is that the only text editor that's built into the Unix under Mac OS X. Some Unix fans prefer the more powerful and 
complex vim or emacs, in the same way that some people prefer Microsoft Word to AppleWorks.
A new pico session. One key difference between pico and, say, TextEdit: To scroll, you must 
use the up and down arrow keys, or the Prev Pg and Next Pg commands—not the Terminal 
scroll bar.

16.4 Where to Go from Here
16.4.1.2 date
Used all by itself, the date command simply displays the current date and time. However, you can use its long list of date 
"conversion specifications" (enter man date to see all of them) to format the date string in any conceivable way. Begin the 
string with a + and then enter the formatting you like, mixing in any regular text as well, like this:
                office-mac:~ chris$ date +"I can't believe it's already week %V
of %Y, here in the %Z time zone. But what do you expect on a %A
at%l:%M %p?"
                I can't believe it's already week 45 of 2003, here in the PST
time zone. But what do you expect on a Monday at 8:25 PM?
NOTE
Be careful about using date with sudo. If you do, and accidentally forget the leading +, you'll reset your Mac's 
built-in clock.
16.4.1.3 grep
The grep program is a filter, a powerful program designed to search data for text that matches a specified pattern. It can 
pass on the processed result to another program, file, or the command line itself.
Specify the text pattern you want grep to search using a notation called regular expressions. For example, the regular 
expression dis[ck] will search for either disk or disc. Another example: To search for lines containing the file names 
Yosemite1. mov, Yosemite2.mov, and Yosemite3.mov, you could tell grep that you're looking for Yosemite[1-3]\.mov.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Eliza, I Have Issues with My Mother
Therapy, whether it's about your frustrations with your Mac or any other subject, is expensive. Still, it feels good 
to talk to someone about whatever's bothering you—and Mac OS X is ready to listen.
Hidden in the emacs text-editing program is a fully unlicensed automated psychoanalyst named Eliza. To enter 
her office, open Terminal, type emacs and press Enter. After the introductory screen has appeared, press Shift-
Esc, type xdoctor, and then press Enter.
"I am the psychotherapist," Eliza begins. "Please, describe your problems. Each time you are finished talking, 
type RET twice." (She means, "Press the Return key twice.")
As you can see from this illustration, she isn't exactly Sigmund Freud. But she's very entertaining, and 
surprisingly responsive.
When your session is finished, press Control-X and then Control-C to exit Eliza and emacs.

16.4 Where to Go from Here
 
But grep can search much more than just file and directory names. Its search material can be part of any file, especially 
plain text files. The text files on your Mac include HTML files, log files, and—possibly juiciest of all—your email mailbox 
files. Using grep, for example, you could search all your Mail for messages matching certain criteria with great efficiency.
16.4.1.4 find
Now that the Finder can actually find files again, you might wonder why you would need to use the Unix find command. 
Well, for one, find takes file searching to a whole new level. For example, you can find files based on their permissions, 
owner name, flag settings, and of course any kind of name pattern you can think of using regular expressions.
Also, like most other Unix commands, you can "pipe" the find command's list of found files straight into another program for 
further processing. You might do this to change their names, convert them to other formats, or even upload them to a 
network server.
Perhaps best of all, since you can run find with sudo, you can look for files existing anywhere on your hard disk, regardless 
of directory permission settings.
To find all files in your Home directory with "Bolinas" in their names, for example, you would use this command: 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-4.html (4 of 6)5/3/2004 5:04:47 AM

16.4 Where to Go from Here
find ~/ -name '*Bolinas*' 
Or, to ignore capitalization:
find ~/ -iname '*Bolinas*' 
And this command will search for all the locked files in your Home directory:
find ~/ -flags uchg
16.4.1.5 cron
This little Unix program can trigger certain commands according to a specified schedule, even when you're not logged in. 
People use cron to trigger daily backups or monthly maintenance, for example. You program your unattended software 
robot in simple text files called crontabs.
Mac OS X comes set up to run cron automatically. (If you open the Activity Monitor program in your 
Applications
Utilities folder, you'll see it listed among the administrator processes that your Mac is continually running.)
In fact, it comes with three under-the-hood Unix maintenance tasks already scheduled —a daily cron, a weekly cron, and a 
monthly cron. They come set to run at 3:15 a.m., 4:30 a.m., and 5:30 a.m., however. If your Mac isn't generally turned on in 
the middle of the night, these healthy cron jobs may never run.
You can either leave your Mac on overnight every now and then or, if you're feeling ambitious, change the time for them to 
run. A glance at man crontab shows you how. (Hint: It involves using sudo pico and editing the system crontab file (/etc/
crontab).
16.4.1.6 curl
With curl, all you need is a file's URL, and you can download it from an FTP site or Web server, without launching an FTP 
program (or enduring a single pop-up ad). To download the entire "Missing CD" for the second edition of this book (see the 
inside back cover), you could just type this:
                curl -O http://examples.oreilly.com/macosxmm2/macosxmm2_all.zip
When the download is complete, you see a note in the Terminal window, and the downloaded file appears right there in 
your working directory.
You can also use this command to upload a file, using the -T flag. To add something to the Incoming folder of an 
anonymous FTP site, for example, use this command line:
                curl -T BigBasin.sit ftp://anonymous@ftp.coast-photo.com/Incoming
In this case, the name of the file you're uploading is BigBasin.sit, and the FTP site is ftp.coast-photo.com. 
You'll be asked for a password, which for anonymous access is, by convention, your email address, and then the upload 
begins.

16.4 Where to Go from Here
16.4.1.7 sips
Sips (Scriptable Image Processing System), an Apple Unix utility included with Panther, lets you process graphics files like 
TIFF, JPEG, and GIF files from within Terminal. You can use sips to get more information about such files (type, size, or 
attached ColorSync profile), for example, or to remove or attach ColorSync profiles.
Better still, sips can modify the images by scaling, rotating, flipping, or converting them to other formats (like PNG, 
Photoshop, or PICT). You can also generate custom Finder icons for image files without them.
Though there's no manpage for sips, you can view its two help screens to learn more. Type sips -h to get general help, and 
sips -H to see the list of image file properties that sips can work with.
For example, to flip a digital photo called TenLakes.jpg vertically (and saving the flipped version with the name 
TenLakesFlipped.jpg), type this:
                sips -f vertical TenLakes.jpg—out TenLakesFlipped.jpg
(If you fail to include the—out option and a new filename, sips will permanently transform the original image file instead of 
spinning out a new one.)
You can even include multiple sips actions in one command. So, for example, to make the same flip but also transform the 
file into a TIFF file, enter this:
sips -f vertical -s format tif TenLakes.jpg—out TenLakesFlipped.tif 
16.4.1.8 telnet, ftp
Telnet and FTP aren't exclusively Unix programs, of course. Techies from all walks of operating-system life have used 
telnet for years whenever they want to tap into another computer from afar, and FTP to deliver and download software files. 
Details on both are in Chapter 21.

16.5 Putting It Together
All of the Unix syntax and vocabulary presented in this chapter and Chapter 15 is all well and good, and it will give you the 
rosy glow of having mastered something new. But it still doesn't entirely explain why Unix gives programmers sweaty palms 
and dilated pupils.
The real power of Unix comes farther down the road—when you start stringing these commands together.
Suppose, for example, you want to round up all the TIFF image files related to your Yosemite project, scale them to a 
common size, convert them to JPEG files, and copy them to an FTP site. How would you go about it?
You could, of course, use the Finder's Find command to search for all TIFF files that have "Yosemite" in their names. But 
what if your images were named otherwise but kept in folders with Yosemite in their names? You would have to find those 
folders first, and then the TIFF files within them.
You could perform the next step (scaling and converting the image) either manually or by a preprogrammed script, using a 
program like Photoshop or even iPhoto. Once the images were all done, you'd need to collect them and then use your 
favorite FTP program to upload them to the server.
But with a mastery of Unix, you could shave 12 minutes off of your workday just by changing to an empty working directory 
and typing this as one long line:
                find ~ -type f -ipath '*yosemite*tif' -print0 | xargs -0 sips -Z
250 -s format jpeg—out . ; ftp -u ftp://ftp.coast-photo.com/Incoming *
Even after two chapters of Unix basics, that mass of commands probably looks a tad intimidating. And, indeed, if you've 
never programmed before, even the following breakdown may make your eyes glaze over. But even so, pieces of it should 
now look familiar:
G     find ~ -type f -ipath '*yosemite*tif ' -print0 |. This segment searches your Home directory (~) for files (-type f) 
whose pathnames (-ipath, meaning "capitalization doesn't matter") contain the word Yosemite and end in tif. 
Remember, the asterisks here are wildcard characters, which stand for "any number of characters." The command 
so far makes a list of all matching files, which it keeps in its little head.
The -print0 command formats this list of found files' pathnames, separating them with the null character (a special 
character that programmers use to indicate where one string of text ends and another begins) instead of the usual 
spaces. It lets the command work with pathnames that contain spaces, a common occurrence on Macs (but a rarity 
in Unix). You'll see how it does this shortly.
Then comes the pipe (the vertical bar), which you can use to direct the results (output) of one command into the 
input of another. In this case, it sends the list of found pathnames on to the next command.
G     xargs -0 sips -Z 250 -s format jpeg—out . ;. xargs is an argument builder. In this case, it builds an argument from 
the list of files it received from the find command and provides it to sips for processing. In other words, xargs hands 
a list of files to sips, and sips runs the same command on each one.
The -0 flag tells xargs that the pathnames are separated by the null character. (Otherwise, xargs would separate 
pathnames at each space character, which would choke sips.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-16-SECT-5.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 5:04:50 AM

16.5 Putting It Together
For each file it gets, sips first scales the image's largest dimension to 250 pixels, and its other dimension 
proportionally. (That way, any image will fit into a 250 x 250-pixel box on a Web page, for example.)
sips then sets the format (-s format) of the image to JPEG and saves it, with the correct .jpg extension, in the 
working directory (which is indicated by the single dot that follows—out).
The semicolon at the end of this fragment tells the shell to run the next command when it's finished with the 
previous one. So, once sips is done with each file it gets from xargs, the shell move on to this:
G     ftp -u ftp://ftp.coast-photo.com/Incoming *. The ftp utility included with Panther can work a lot like curl in the way 
it can upload and downloads files with a single command. In this case, the command uploads (-u) every file from 
the working directory (as specified by the asterisk—that is, all of the sips-processed files) to the Incoming directory 
of the coast-photo.com FTP site.
NOTE
As written, this command works only if you don't need a password to get into the FTP site. Otherwise, build 
your FTP account name and password into its address like this: ftp://chris:password@ftp.coast-photo. com/
Incoming. 
When you press Return or Enter after this gigantic command, Mac OS X scans all the directories inside your Home 
directory, rounds up all the Yosemite-related image, scales them, converts and renames them, and then uploads each to 
the FTP directory.
Once you've gained some experience with Unix commands and programs like these, you'll find it fairly easy to adapt them 
to your own tasks. For example, here's a more versatile command that searches a directory called Projects for all TIFF files 
modified after 6:00 that morning, converts them to thumbnail-sized jpegs and then plops into the images directory of your 
FTP-accessible Web server:
                find ~/Projects -type f -iname *tif -newermt 6:00 -print0 |
xargs -0 sips -Z 128 -s format jpeg—out . ; ftp -u ftp://carlos:
birdie@ftp.coast-photo.com/htdocs/images *
Of course, not everyone's going to want to type out that entire command line every time. Fortunately, you don't have to; 
having read the box in Section 16.1.5, you know that you can just save the whole thing as a .command file—and run it 
thereafter just by double-clicking.
Trouble is, a new Terminal window comes with the working directory set to your Home folder—and you don't want your .
command file to upload your entire life! Ideally, then, you should build a "change directory" command into the .command 
file. Change Terminal's attention to, say, a new, empty directory, which will collect the processed files. You should then 
include a final move command that will empty that directory when the rest of the command is done. That way, you'll again 
have an empty working directory for the next time you run the following command:
                cd ~/Stage ; find ~/Projects -type f -iname *tif -newermt 6:00
-print0 | xargs -0 sips -Z 128 -s format jpeg—out . ; ftp -u
ftp://carlos:birdie@ftp.coast-photo.com/htdocs/images * ; mv * ~/Backup/

GEM IN THE ROUGH
The Famous Animated-Desktop Trick
It was one of the first great Mac OS X hacks to be passed around the Internet: the classic "screen-saver-on-
the-desktop" trick. In this scheme, your desktop shows more than some wussy, motionless desktop picture. It 
actually displays one of the Screen Effects animation modules.
Start by choosing the screen saver module you prefer, using the Screen Effects panel of System Preferences. 
(The one called "flurry" makes a good choice.)
Then, in Terminal, type: /System/Library/Frameworks/ ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaver 
Engine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background & 
...and then press Enter. (Note that there are no spaces or Returns in the command, even though it appears 
broken onto more than one line here.)
Presto: The active screen saver becomes your desktop picture! Fall back into your chair in astonishment.
Once you've regained your composure, look in the Terminal window again. The number that follows the [1] in 
the following line is the process ID of your background desktop program (see Section 16.3.7).
You'll need that number when it comes time to turn off the effect, which is a good idea, since the desktop/
screen saver business drains a massive amount of your Mac's processing power. The whole thing is a 
gimmicky showoff stunt you'll generally want to turn off before conducting any meaningful work.
To turn off this effect, type kill 496 (or whatever the process ID is) and then press Enter.
And if you get tired of typing out that long command, download xBack from www.gideonsoftworks.com/xback.
html. It's a simple piece of shareware that lets you turn this effect, plus many additional options, on and off 
with the click of a mouse.
With just a few more keystrokes, you could modify that command to collect some files, lock them, and place copies of each 
in every account holder's Home directory, as well as several different servers at the same time. What's more, it will email 
you a report when it's done. Using the cron command, you could even configure this routine to trigger itself automatically 
every day at 11:00 p.m. Considering the hundreds of Unix programs included with Mac OS X and the thousands of others 
available on the Internet, the possibilities are limitless.
For some guidance in picking up your Unix career from here, see Appendix E.

Chapter 17. Hacking Mac OS X
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Chapter 17. Hacking Mac OS X
Chapter 8 shows you how to customize your desktop picture, error beep, and screen saver. But beyond those simple 
modifications, Mac OS X offers only a subset of the tweakable features found in other operating systems. You can't record 
sounds, change the fonts used in the Finder, adjust the colors of your scroll bars, and so on.
If you're sneaky, creative, or just different, however, you can indeed perform more dramatic visual and behavioral surgery 
on your copy of Mac OS X—from changing the startup screen image to replacing the "poof " that appears when you drag 
something off the Dock with a new animation of your own. All you need is a few of Mac OS X's less obvious tools, or some 
free downloadable customizing software, and a few recipes like the ones in this chapter.
Some of these tricks are frivolous. Some are actually functional and useful. And although Apple sanctions not a one, all are 
perfectly safe.
NOTE
History has shown that Apple considers Mac OS X a work in progress. A huge number of the fun little hacks 
that worked in Mac OS X 10.1 stopped working in 10.2. All of the tricks in this chapter work in 10.3, but may 
well "break" in subsequent versions of Mac OS X. The Errata page for this book at www.missingmanuals.
com will keep you up to date.

17.1 TinkerTool: Customization 101
If you poke around the Mac OS X Web sites and newsgroups long enough, you'll find little bits of Unix code being passed 
around. One of them purports to let you change the genie animation that you see when you minimize a window to the Dock. 
Another eliminates the drop shadow behind icon names on your desktop. Yet another lets you change the transparency of 
the Terminal window (Chapter 15)—a cool, although not especially practical, effect.
If you really want to fool around with these bits of Unix code, go for it. You'll find most of these tidbits at Web sites like www.
macosxhints.com.
The truth is, however, that there's no good reason for you to subject yourself to the painstaking effort of typing out Unix 
commands when easy-to-use, push-button programs are available to do the same thing.
TinkerTool 3, for example, is a free utility that offers an amazing degree of control over the fonts, desktop, Dock, scroll bar 
arrows, and other aspects of the Mac OS X environment.
TinkerTool is a double-clickable program that makes changes only to your account settings. 
(You can download it from the "Missing CD" page of www.missingmanuals.com, among other 
places.)
 
Here are some of the highlights:

17.1 TinkerTool: Customization 101
G     Kill the animations. When you open any icon, expand a Get Info panel, and so on, you see little animated 
expansion effects. It's nice, but it takes time. TinkerTool can turn them off (see Figure 17-1).
G     Dock. TinkerTool lets you gives hidden programs transparent icons on the Dock and specify the Dock's position on 
the screen—left, right, bottom, or top—and even whether it's centered or flush against one side of the screen. 
TinkerTool even unlocks a third option for the animation of windows collapsing onto the Dock. In addition to the 
standard Mac OS X choices (Genie and Scale), you also get something called Suck In (no comment).
G     Scroll bars. TinkerTool gives you greater control over the placement of Mac OS X's scroll bar arrows—together at 
one end of the scroll bar, duplicated at both ends of the scroll bar, and so on.
G     Visibility. TinkerTool can make the thousands of invisible Unix files appear as full-blooded icons. (Power users, 
you know who you are.)
G     Fonts. TinkerTool lets you change the fonts for dialog boxes, menus, title bars, help balloons, and so on.
What's great about TinkerTool is that it's completely safe. It's nothing more than a front end for a number of perfectly 
legitimate Unix settings that Apple simply opted not to make available in the regular Finder. Furthermore, the changes you 
make using TinkerTool are stored in your own Home
Library folder—that is, they affect only your account. Whatever 
changes you make don't affect the Mac experience for anyone else using your machine. And TinkerTool's Reset pane 
makes it easy to restore everything back to the way it was before you started fooling around.

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
The professional interface artists at Apple use Photoshop, just like professional artists everywhere else. But in Mac OS X, 
they've made very little effort to cover their tracks. In Cocoa programs and even a few Carbonized ones, every element of 
the famous Aqua interface is nothing more than a Photoshop-generated graphics file.
The beauty of graphics files, of course, is that you can edit them. Maybe you just want to adjust the colors. Maybe you 
found a replacement graphic online. Or maybe you actually want to draw a new graphic from scratch. In each of these 
cases, using a program like Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, or GraphicConverter, you can dress up your own desktop in 
your own way.
In addition to a little artistic talent, all you need to know is how to open the graphics that constitute the interface of each 
program. The routine generally goes like this:
1.  In the Finder, open the Applications folder. Control-click the icon of the program you want to edit; choose 
Show Package Contents from the contextual menu. 
You may remember from Chapter 4 that most Mac OS X programs may look like single icons, but are actually 
disguised folders containing all of their own support files.
You can choose almost any Cocoa program to edit in this way: Address Book, Chess, iChat, Mail, iPhoto, Safari, 
iDVD, iMovie, TextEdit, whatever.
2.  Open the Contents
Resources folder. 
Inside are the objects of your search: the TIFF or PDF files that constitute the "face" of the program you're editing. 
(Sometimes they're one more folder down, in a folder representing your language-English.lproj, for example.)
When you're editing the Mac OS X Chess game, for example, you'll find a folder called Styles, which contains the 
graphics that create the game board and the textures that wrap around each of the pieces. There's nothing to stop 
you from swapping in photos of your friends' heads in their places. Figure 17-2 shows another example.
While you're at it, you may also want to open up Mac OS X's Mail program and redesign its toolbar icons. The sky's 
the limit!
If you think you may want to go back to the program's original look after your 
experiment, make a safety copy of these files before proceeding.
Top: Cocoa programs are nothing more than a bunch of artistically done Photoshop TIFF 
files, buried in the program's package
Contents
 Resources folder. When you feel 
the need for change, go ahead and edit them—hey, it's your computer.

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
Bottom: When you're editing the Calculator program, you can edit the LCD_center.tif, 
LCD_right. tif, and LCD_left.tif files (left) to change the look of the readout window 
(right). In this example, the "center" portion gets stretched as wide as necessary to fill 
the width of the Calculator screen.
 
3.  Open the TIFF files in Photoshop. 
Edit them brilliantly.
4.  Save your changes. 
The deed is done. You now have a program that you can decidedly call your own.

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
17.2.1 Editing the Trash and Finder Icons
You can edit the Finder dock icon and the Trash icons (empty and full) exactly as described above—but you have to peek 
into a different corner to find them. The Dock program, after all, isn't in your Applications folder; it's in your System folder. 
And in Mac OS X, the System folder is sacred territory, forbidden to humans. An error message will let you know that you're 
not allowed to edit the graphics files that make up Mac OS X itself (rather than its applications).
In this Mac OS X hack and in several others in this chapter, you'll have to find a way around this kind of OS self-protection. 
You can go about it in any of three ways:
G     Restart in Mac OS 9, if your Mac is capable of it. Doing so bypasses the objections you'll get from Mac OS X as 
you try to hack the system.
G     Log into Mac OS X as the root user, as described in Section 11.8.
The "poof" animation is nothing more than five individual frames of cartoon smoke, 128 
pixels square. You'll find its file sitting inside the Dock package, as described in the 
previous section, alongside the finder.png and trash files. As shown here in Photoshop 
Elements, you can substitute any graphics you want, as long as you fit them evenly on 
this 640-pixeltall "film strip" (that is, 128 pixels times 5). Save, quit, and then restart.

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
 
G     Here's a technique that's new to Panther: 
-drag the icon you want out of the System folder, edit a copy of it 
(preserve the original, just in case), and then 
-drag it back into place.
As soon as you begin to 
-drag one of these sacred files, Mac OS X asks you to prove your hackworthiness by 
entering an administrator's name and password—and then it lets you proceed with your surgery.
In any case, to edit the Finder or Trash icons, you'd start by opening the System
 Library
CoreServices folder. 
Control-click Dock and choose Show Package Contents from the contextual menu. The Dock window opens. Open the 
Contents
Resources folder. These are the graphics you want to edit (as PNG graphics instead of TIFF): finder.png, 
trashempty.png, and trashfull.png.
17.2.2 Replacing the Poof
When you drag an icon off the Dock or toolbar, it disappears with a literal puff of smoke—a cute, cartoon-like animation that 
Apple's been trying to work into its operating systems ever since the days of the Newton palmtop. Most people find this tiny, 
one-second display of interface magic charming and witty, but others argue that it demeans the dignity of the otherwise 
professional-looking Mac OS X.
If you follow that latter camp, you can replace the animation just by editing Apple's own five-frame "poof " animation. Figure 
17-3 shows the procedure.
17.2.3 The Startup and Login Screens
Yeah, yeah, sure, Mac OS X makes it easy to change the desktop picture. But what about the boring Mac OS X, Apple-logo 
picture that appears while the startup progress bar is chugging across the screen? And what about the default swirling blue 
desktop picture that appears behind the sign-in screen?
Open the System
Library
CoreServices
 SystemStarter_folder. Control-click the 
QuartzDisplay.bundle icon and, from the contextual menu, choose Show Package Contents. In 
the resulting window, open the Resources folder to find the object of your quest: a file called 
BootPanel. pdf. You can edit this file to your heart's content in, for example, Photoshop. After 
you save changes and then restart, you'll find your new graphic in place.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-17-SECT-2.html (5 of 7)5/3/2004 5:04:58 AM

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
 
Don't despair—you can make these look like anything you want. Here you go:
G     The background behind the "Welcome to Mac OS X" sign is a JPEG graphic, called Aqua Blue.jpg, located in 
the Library
Desktop Pictures folder. (Classic Aqua Blue. jpg was the standard desktop picture in Mac OS X 
10.1.) You can open and edit this file directly—or replace it with another graphic having the same name and file 
format. At the next startup, you'll enjoy your new background.
G     The sign-in screen graphic is only slightly harder to change. It involves bypassing Mac OS X's security shield, 
using any of the three techniques described in Section 17.2.1. Then see Figure 17-4.
17.2.4 Editing Your Menulets
You can colorize the little menu-bar symbols fondly called menulets, or even completely redesign their graphics. Like many 
other Mac OS X screen elements, these are nothing more than little tiny graphics saved in PDF format.
Here again, you can't save changes to them unless you (a) restart in Mac OS 9, (b) log in as the root user, or (c) 
-drag 
the original files to the desktop, edit them, and then 
-drag them back in. Open the 
System
Library
CoreServices
Menu Extras folder.
Here, you'll find individual files (actually packages) for almost every menulet: Battery, Clock, Displays, and so on. Open 
whichever one you want to customize (Airport. menu, for example) by Control-clicking it and choosing Show Package 
Contents. As usual, open the Contents
Resources folder.

17.2 Redoing Mac OS X's Graphics
Inside are a number of TIFF files that represent the various forms your menulet might take; the Volume icon, for example, 
seems to emit different numbers of sound waves depending on your volume setting. Edit each of the graphics as you see 
fit. (The ones whose names are tagged with an s or w represent the inverted highlighted graphic, which you see when you 
actually click the menulet.)

17.3 Replacing the Finder Icons
This one's easy: Just download CandyBar, a simple drag-and-drop program for Mac OS X 10.3. With no technical skill 
whatsoever, you can use this program to replace the icon pictures featured on your folders, your disks, and the Finder 
toolbar. It even comes with several collections of perky (but non-photorealistic) replacement icons (Figure 17-5).

17.4 Rewriting the Words
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
17.4 Rewriting the Words
Mac OS X stores the text and settings of its menus, dialog boxes, and other elements in special text files called plist (for 
Property List) files. They sit in one of the three Library folders (in your Home folder, the System folder, or the hard drive 
window).
The easiest way to edit them is to use Apple's Property List Editor, a program that came on your Mac OS X Developer CD. 
Once you've installed your developer tools as described in Section 9.25.23, you'll find Property List Editor in 
Developer
Applications.
There are hundreds of plist files, so some experimentation and patience is required. Most of the cool changes you can 
make to your plists can be made much more easily using TinkerTool, described at the beginning of this chapter. Here, 
however, is an example of a smaller change you can make this way.
To use CandyBar, just drag your new icons onto the appropriate slots. When you restart the 
Mac, you'll find your new icons in place. Restoring the original icons is equally simple.

17.4.1 Renaming the Trash
It's called Trash, but in Mac OS X, it looks more like an office wastebasket. When inspiration on the work you're supposed 
to be doing runs dry, consider remedying this discrepancy by changing the name of the Trash icon to something more 
appropriate.
In PropertyList Editor, choose File
Open. Navigate to System

17.4 Rewriting the Words
Once you're finished making the change, choose File
Save As, and save your edited plist document to the desktop. 
Now replace the original document (after making a safety copy, if you like) with your edited version, using any of the three 
techniques described in Section 17.2.1.
In any case, the next time you log in, you'll see your new name on the Trash.
Top: This simple file contains the name of the Trash icon on the Dock—and the name of the 
Eject icon that replaces it when you're dragging a disk. By double-clicking the text in the Value 
column, you can edit these descriptions to change the corresponding names.
Bottom: The resulting Trash has a very different name.
 
17.4.2 Rewording the Dock
Using the same routine described in the previous paragraphs, you can edit all of the commands that pertain to the Dock—
both its commands in the a 
 menu (Dock Preferences, Turn Magnification On, and so on) and the contextual menus that 
pop out of the Dock icons themselves. These wordings are in System

GEM IN THE ROUGH
The Blob
It's one of the funniest, weirdest, and least useful of all Panther features. It's the Blob: a strange, floating, 
translucent sphere that, when clicked, triggers Panther's Exposé feature (the "F10" version).
Did Apple programmers put it in as a joke? Was it an early prototype, before they settled on the F10 key as 
the Exposé trigger? Is it an Easter egg? You decide.
In the meantime, here's how to unleash the Blob.
In Terminal (Chapter 15), type this all on one line:
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-floater -bool true
Press Enter. Quit the Dock (use Activity Monitor, if you know how, or just log out and back in again). When the 
Dock next starts up, you'll find the Blob on your screen.
You can drag it around, click it to trigger the F10 function of Exposé, Option-click it to trigger the F9 function, 
Shift-click it to trigger Exposé in slow motion, or get rid of it by repeating the command above (but substitute 
false as the last word).
What you never can do is fully understand it.

Chapter 18. Internet Setup, Firewall, and .Mac
As Apple's programmers slogged away for months on the massive Mac OS X project, there was one spot where they must 
have felt like they were happily gliding on ice: networking and the Internet. For the most part, the Internet already runs on 
Unix, and hundreds of extremely polished tools and software chunks were already available.
Most people connect to the Internet using a modem that dials out over ordinary phone lines. But a rapidly growing minority 
connects over higher-speed wires, using broadband connections that are always on: cable modems, DSL, or corporate 
networks. This chapter explains how to set up each one (and how to use each with a wireless AirPort system).
This chapter also describes some of Mac OS X's offbeat Internet featurettes: the iDisk, a backup or transfer disk that 
resides on the Internet; the other Apple .Mac account features, including HomePage, which lets you publish your own Web 
pages; Internet Connection Sharing, which lets several computers in the same household share a single broadband 
connection; and the system-wide Internet bookmarks known as Internet location files.

18.1 The Best News You've Heard All Day
If you upgraded to Mac OS X 10.3 from an earlier version of the Mac OS, breathe easy. Mac OS X was kind enough to pick 
up your networking and Internet settings from that earlier installation. The moment you first see the Mac OS X desktop, 
you're ready to use the Internet (and skip the next two pages).
Read on, however, if you need to plug in the Internet settings manually. If you're setting up a new Mac, or if you've just used 
Mac OS X's "clean install" option (Appendix A ), or if you simply want to create a new Internet account, you definitely have 
some typing to look forward to.
If you haven't yet set up an Internet connection, reading the next few pages will guide you 
through plugging the proper settings into System Preferences.
If you're more of a do-er than a reader, however, you may prefer the new "Assist me" button 
at the bottom of the Network pane of System Preferences. It asks how you want to connect 
to the Internet (by dial-up modem, DSL, cable modem, and so on), and then walks you 
through the process of typing in the settings, if necessary.

18.2 Connecting by Dial-up Modem
If you intend to connect to the Internet via ordinary phone lines, courtesy of your Mac's built-in modem, you need to sign up 
for an Internet service. Hundreds of companies, large and small, would love to become your Internet service provider (ISP), 
generally charging $20 per month for the privilege of connecting you to the great Internet.
Panther's new Network Status screen shows you how each of your network connections are 
doing at the moment (the status messages actually change as circumstances change). To 
adjust the network settings for a connection, double-click its "row."
 
A setup program for Earthlink, a popular ISP, presents itself as part of the Setup Assistant program that runs the first time 
you turn on a new Mac.
But if you aren't starting in such virgin territory (or if you want to sign up with a different ISP), you must plug a series of 
settings into the Network pane of System Preferences. You'll need to get this information directly from your ISP by 
consulting either its Web page, the little instruction sheets that came with your account, or a help-desk agent on the phone.

18.2 Connecting by Dial-up Modem
NOTE
The following instructions don't pertain to America Online. It comes with its own setup program and doesn't 
involve any settings in System Preferences.
18.2.1 The PPP Tab
Start by opening System Preferences and clicking the Network icon. You're shown the view pictured in Figure 18-1: a 
Network Status screen, new in Mac OS X 10.3, which summarizes the various ways your Mac can connect to the Internet 
or an office network, and how each connection is doing.
From the Show pop-up menu, choose Internal Modem. (Or just double-click the Internal Modem "row" of the status screen.) 
You should be facing the PPP tab, where you fill in the blanks like this:
G     Service Provider. Type in the name of your ISP (EarthLink, for example).
G     Account Name. This is your account name, as assigned by the ISP. If you're BillG@earthlink.net, for example, 
type BillG here.
G     Password. Specify your ISP account password here. Turn on "Save password" if you'd rather not retype it every 
time you connect.
G     Telephone Number. This is the local access number that your modem is supposed to dial to connect to your ISP.
If you need your Mac to dial a 9 or an 8 for an outside line (as you would from within a hotel), 
or *70 to turn off Call Waiting, add it to the beginning of the phone number followed by a 
comma. The comma means "pause for two seconds." You can also put the comma to good 
use when typing in the dialing sequence for a calling-card number.
G     Alternate Number. This blank lets you type in a number to dial if the first one is busy.
G     PPP Options. Click this button to bring up a special Options dialog box. Here, for example, you can specify how 
long the Mac waits before hanging up the phone line after your last online activity, and how many times the Mac 
should redial if the ISP phone number is busy. 
In the Session Options, one checkbox you'll almost certainly want to turn on is "Connect 
automatically when needed." It makes your Mac dial the Internet automatically whenever you 
check your email or open your Web browser. (Otherwise, you'd have to establish the Internet 
call manually, using the Internet Connect program described in Section 9.12. Only then could 
you check your email or open your Web browser.)
Even if several user accounts (Chapter 11) are set up on your Mac, they all share the same 
Internet connection settings. Only an administrator can make changes to the Internet dial-up 
settings. That's why the little padlock appears in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. When

18.2 Connecting by Dial-up Modem
you're finished making your settings, either close the window or click Apply Now.
 
18.2.2 The Other Tabs
Most people using a dial-up modem can ignore TCP/IP and Proxies tabs altogether. (The TCP/IP tab comes already set to 
"Using PPP," which is what you want. And proxy servers are computers used primarily by corporations to accelerate or filter 
the delivery of Internet information. Of course, if you work in a corporation, you probably don't connect to the Internet with a 
dial-up modem anyway. If you are that rare exception, ask your network administrator to show you how to set up this 
screen.)
On the Modem tab, you specify which kind of modem you have. Most Mac OS X- compatible Macs have built-in Apple 
modems, which is why the pop-up menu already says "Apple Internal 56K Modem." If you, the heretic, have some other 
kind of modem, choose its name from the pop-up menu.

This list of modems corresponds to configuration files in your Library
Modem Scripts 
folder. You can save some disk space and simplify your life by throwing away the scripts for 
all of the modems except the one you actually use.
Some of the other settings that can be handy include:
G     Wait for dial tone before dialing. This is for you, North American laptop owners. Because the dial tones in certain 
foreign countries sound weird to the Mac, it therefore won't dial; it's still listening for that good old North American 
dial tone. In that case, turning off this checkbox makes the Mac dial bravely even though it hasn't heard the sound 
it's listening for.
G     Dialing. Specify what kind of phone service you have—Tone, or in a few rural locations, Pulse.
G     Sound. By clicking Off, you make your Mac dial the Internet silently, sparing sleeping family members or dorm 
roommates from having to listen to your modem shriek as it connects.
18.2.3 Going Online
That's all there is to it. If you've turned on "Connect automatically when needed," your Mac dials and connects to the 
Internet automatically whenever an Internet-related program tries to connect (a Web browser or email program, for 
example).
Going online automatically (by launching an Internet program) is by far the most convenient 
method, but you can also go online on command, in one of these two ways.
Top: The quick way to dial or hang up is to use this menulet (which doesn't appear until you 
turn on "Show modem status on menu bar" in Internet Connect or on the Network pane's PPP 
screen).
Bottom: You can also go online (or disconnect) the long way—using Internet Connect.

18.2 Connecting by Dial-up Modem
 
If you didn't turn on that option, then you can make your Mac dial the Internet in one of two ways:
G     Using Internet Connect. This little program is in your Applications folder. The main item of interest here is the 
Connect button, which makes the Mac dial. Once Internet Connect indicates that you're online, open your Web 
browser, email program, or other Internet software and get surfing.
If you're smart, however, you'll turn on the "Show modem status on menu bar" checkbox. It adds a tiny telephone 
icon—the Modem Status menulet—to the upper- right corner of your screen, which lets you completely bypass 
Internet Connect the next time you want to go online (Figure 18-3).
G     Use the menu-bar icon. Just click the Modem Status menulet and choose Connect from the pop-up menu. Your 
Mac dials without even blocking your desktop picture with a window. 
18.2.4 Disconnecting
The Mac automatically drops the phone line 15 minutes after your last activity online (or whatever interval you specified in

the PPP Options dialog box). In fact, if other people have accounts on your Mac (Chapter 11), the Mac doesn't even hang 
up when you log out. It maintains the connection so that the next person can surf the Net without redialing.
Of course, if other people in your household are screaming for you to get off the line so that they can make a call, you can 
also disconnect manually. Either choose Disconnect from the Modem Status menulet or click Disconnect in the Internet 
Connect window (both shown in Figure 18-3).
If you have more than one ISP, or if you travel between locations with your laptop, don't miss 
the Location feature. It lets you switch sets of dial-up modem settings—including the local 
phone number—with a simple menu selection. It's described in Section 18.5.

18.3 Broadband Connections
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
18.3 Broadband Connections
If you have a cable modem, DSL, or office network, you're one of the lucky ones. You have a high-speed, broadband 
connection to the Internet that's always available, always on. You never have to wait to dial, disconnect, or download. 
You're connected to the Net via your Mac's Ethernet jack or AirPort connection, leaving its built-in modem benched.
18.3.1 Automatic Configuration
The real beauty of most broadband connections these days is that they require no setup whatsoever. Take a new Mac out 
of the box, plug in the Ethernet cable to your cable modem, and you can begin surfing the Web instantly.
That's because most cable modems and DSL boxes automatically feed all of the necessary configuration settings to the 
Mac (including techie specs like IP address and DNS Server addresses), courtesy of a glorious feature called DHCP. This 
acronym means dynamic host configuration protocol, which is tech-ese for "we'll fill in your Network pane of System 
Preferences automatically."
NOTE
The bad news is that DHCP doesn't necessarily give you a single, unchanging IP address, which can make it 
more difficult to use the remote control features of Mac OS X, like dialing in from the road. There is a 
workaround, however; see Section 21.1.
18.3.2 Manual Configuration
If, for some reason, you're not able to surf the Web or check email the first time you try, it's conceivable that your 
broadband modem doesn't offer DHCP. In that case, you may have to fiddle with the Network pane of System Preferences, 
preferably with a customer-support rep from your broadband provider on the phone.
On the Network pane, from the Show pop-up menu, choose either AirPort or Built-in Ethernet, depending on how your Mac 
is connected to the broadband modem. Now you see something like Figure 18-4. 
Don't be alarmed by the morass of numbers and periods—it's all in good fun. (If you find TCP/IP 
fun, that is.) In this illustration, you see the setup for a cablemodem account with a static IP 
address, which means you have to type in all of these numbers yourself, as guided by the cable 
company. The alternative is a DHCP server account, which fills most of it in automatically.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-3.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:05:20 AM

18.3 Broadband Connections
 
The next step is to make a selection from the Configure pop-up menu. Only your service provider can tell you exactly which 
settings to use, but you'll probably be asked to choose Manually. That is, your cable or phone company will tell you 
precisely which IP address (Internet address) to type in here. The bad news is that you'll also have to fill in all the other 
boxes here—Subnet Mask, Router, and so on—with cryptic numbers separated by periods.
On the other hand, look at the bright side: You've just been given a static IP address, an Internet address that is all your 
own and that won't change. Because your Mac has this one reliable address, several cool Mac OS X features are available 
to you. For example, it's easier to access your files from anywhere in the world, as described in Chapter 21. 
That's all the setup—click Apply Now. If your settings are correct, you're online, now and forever. You never have to worry 
about connecting or disconnecting.

18.4 AirPort Networks
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
18.4 AirPort Networks
AirPort is Apple's term for the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) wireless networking technology. If you have it, you'll remember having paid 
$80 or $100 for an AirPort card, which lets any modern Mac model communicate with an AirPort base station up to 300 feet 
away, much like a cordless phone. Doing so lets you surf the Web from your laptop in the TV room, for example, or share 
files with someone across the building from you. (Details in Section 12.1.)
Most people set up an AirPort base station in one of three ways:
G     They go online by dialing via modem, which is built into the base station. The base station is plugged into a phone 
jack. Wireless Macs in the house can get online by triggering the base station to dial by remote control.
G     They have a broadband modem, into which they plug the AirPort base station. Wireless Macs can surf using its 
connection through the air.
G     They have a broadband modem, which they've plugged into an Ethernet hub (an inexpensive box with jacks for 
numerous computers, so they can communicate). They plug the broadband modem into the WAN (wide area 
network)port of the hub—not one of the regular Ethernet jacks—and plug the base station into one of the hub's 
regular jacks.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
PPPoE and DSL
If you have DSL service, you may be directed to click the PPPoE tab (in the Network pane of System 
Preferences). It stands for PPP over Ethernet, meaning that although your DSL "modem" is connected to your 
Ethernet port, you still have to make and break your Internet connections manually, as though you had a dial-
up modem.
Fill in the PPPoE tab as directed by your ISP (usually just your account name and password). From here on 
in, you start and end your Internet connections exactly as though you had a dial-up modem, as described in 
Section 18.2.3. 
You may discover that turning on PPPoE disables AppleTalk. If you need AppleTalk (for connecting to older 
Macs on the network, for example), here's a tip: On the Network pane of System Preferences, choose 
Show
Network Configurations. Duplicate and rename your Ethernet setup. Set up the new configuration 
with AppleTalk on, using a manually assigned IP address (like 192.168.1.10).
Now your Mac can talk on two "networks" at once on the same Ethernet port—your DSL company and your 
older Macs on the network.
For the easiest AirPort network setup, begin by configuring your Mac so that it can go online the wired way, as described on 
the previous pages. Once it's capable of connecting to the Internet via wires, you can then use the Airport Setup Assistant 
(in your Applications
Utilities folder) to transmit those Internet settings wirelessly to the base station itself. From then 
on, the base station's modem or Ethernet jack—not your Mac's—will do the connecting to the Internet.
Once your AirPort system is working, you can use the menu bar icon to turn off your AirPort

card (for battery savings in a laptop); to switch from one AirPort network to another (in schools 
or companies that have more than one, as shown here); and to check your wireless signal 
strength (by counting the "waves" coming out of the icon on your menu bar).
 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
All the Firewall Checkboxes
Why can't I turn the checkboxes on the Firewall dialog box on or off? 
These checkboxes are really only indicators, not controls. You can't turn them on or off by clicking—only by 
changing the setup on the Services tab.
The checkboxes here list certain ports—numbered tunnels for certain kinds of Internet traffic. Each service 
(iChat, iTunes Music Sharing, Personal Web Sharing, Personal File Sharing, and so on) conducts its business 
on a specific port.
For example, the Personal Web Sharing service watches port 80 for requests (from the Internet) for the Web 
pages you've created on your Mac, as described in Chapter 21. The Personal File Sharing service watches 
port 548 for requests to access shared folders and disks (Chapter 12).
That's why the only way to turn these checkboxes on or off is by visiting the Services tab of the Sharing panel. 
Whenever you turn on one of the services on the Services tab, Mac OS X turns on the corresponding 
checkbox on the Firewall tab automatically.
Likewise, turn the service off to close the port. (Turn off all of the services you don't need, so the bad guys 
can't use the corresponding ports to access your computer.)
It's important to note that you'll only need to keep ports open for those services you're providing, and not 
those you're using on other computers. For example, you don't need to keep port 80 open when you're 
accessing other people's Web pages, and you don't need to keep port 548 open if you're accessing other 
Macs on the network.
Incidentally, the Firewall pane lists only the services that come built into Mac OS X. As power users know, 
there are plenty of other network services worth running that aren't listed here: IRC, Retrospect, MSN 
Messenger, Timbuktu, and so on. You have to open their ports manually.

18.4 AirPort Networks
To do so, click New on the Firewall pane. The resulting sheet has a pop-up menu listing a handful of common 
services, and a text box showing the associated port for that service. If the service you would like to run is 
listed, choose it from the pop-up menu and click OK. You've just added a new checkbox to the Firewall pane.
If you don't see your service listed, choose Other in the Port Name pop-up menu. Enter the port number 
associated with that service and a description. If you don't know the correct port number to use, search the 
port database at ports.tantalo.net 
At that point, you can do all the controlling you like from the AirPort menulet (Figure 18-5).

18.5 The Firewall
If you have a broadband, always-on connection, you're connected to the Internet 24 hours a day. It's theoretically—though 
remotely—possible for some cretin to use automated hacking software to flood you with files or take control of your 
machine. Fortunately, Mac OS X 10.3's firewall feature puts up a barrier to such mischief.
Open the Sharing panel of System Preferences. Click the Firewall tab (Figure 18-6), and then click Start. That's almost all 
there is to it: you're protected.
This simple firewall doesn't let you create complex rules (preprogrammed guidelines that 
permit or deny certain kinds of Internet traffic). For that degree of flexibility, install a shareware 
program like Firewalk or Brickhouse (available from www.missingmanuals.com, for example).
 
Only one complication may remain: If you're using Mac OS X's Internet connection sharing feature (Section 18.8), then it's 
important to turn on the firewall only for the first Mac—the one that's the gateway to the Internet. Leave the firewall turned 
off on all the Macs "downstream" from it.

18.6 Switching Locations

18.6 Switching Locations
If you travel with a laptop, you know the drill. You're constantly opening up System Preferences
Network so that you 
can switch between Internet settings: Ethernet at the office, dial-up at home. Or maybe you simply visit the branch office 
from time to time, and you're getting tired of having to change the local access number for your ISP each time you leave 
home (and return home again).
The simple solution is the 
Location submenu. As Figure 18-7 illustrates, all you have to do is tell it where you are. 
Mac OS X handles the details of switching to the correct Internet connection and phone number.
The Location feature lets you switch from one "location" to another just by choosing its name—
either from the 
 menu (top) or from this pop-up menu in System Preferences (bottom). The 
Automatic location just means "the standard, default one you originally set up." (Don't be 
fooled: Despite its name, Automatic isn't the only location that offers multihoming, which is 
described later in this chapter.)

18.6 Switching Locations
 
18.6.1 Creating a New Location
To create a Location, which is nothing more than a set of memorized settings, open System Preferences, click Network, 
and choose New Location from the Location popup menu. You'll be asked to provide a name for your new location, such as 
Chicago Office or Dining Room Floor. 
When you click OK, you return to the Network panel, which is now blank. Take this opportunity to set up the kind of Internet 
connection you use at the corresponding location, just as described on the first pages of this chapter. If you travel regularly, 
in fact, you can use Location Manager to build a long list of city locations, each of which "knows" the local phone number for 
your Internet access company (because you've entered it on the PPP tab).
A key part of making a new Location is putting the various Internet connection types (Ethernet, AirPort, Modem, Bluetooth) 
into the correct order. Your connections will be slightly quicker if you give the modem priority in your Hotel setup, the AirPort 
connection priority in your Starbucks setup, and so on.

18.6 Switching Locations
In fact, if you use nothing but a cable modem when you're at home, you may want to create a location in which only the 
Ethernet connection is active. Conversely, if your laptop uses nothing but its dial-up modem when on the road, your 
Location could include nothing but the Internal Modem connection. You'll save a few seconds each time you try to go 
online, because your Mac won't bother hunting for an Internet connection that doesn't exist (see "Multihoming," below).
18.6.2 Making the Switch
Once you've set up your various locations, you can switch among them using either the Location pop-up menu (in System 
Preferences
Network) or the 
Location submenu, as shown in Figure 18-7. As soon as you do so, your Mac is 
automatically set to dial the new phone number or to connect using the different method.
If you have a laptop, create a connection called Offline. From the Show pop-up menu, 
choose Network Port Configurations; turn off all the connection methods you see in the list. 
When you're finished, you've got yourself a laptop that will never attempt to go online. This 
setup will save you the occasional interruption of a program that tries to dial but takes three 
minutes to discover you're on Flight 800 to Miami and have no phone line available.

18.7 Multihoming
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
18.7 Multihoming
Speaking of different ways to get online, Mac OS X offers one of the coolest features known to Internet-loving mankind: 
multihoming. That's the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous network connections open—Ethernet, AirPort, dial-up, 
even FireWire. If one of your programs needs Internet access, and the first method isn't hooked up, the Mac switches to the 
next available connection—automatically.
This feature is especially ideal for laptops. When you open your Web browser, your laptop might first check to see if it's at 
the office, plugged into a cable modem via the Ethernet—the fastest possible connection. If not, it automatically looks for an 
AirPort network. Finally, if it draws a blank there, the laptop reluctantly dials the modem. It may not be the fastest Internet 
connection, but it's all you've got at the moment.
In short, for each location you create, you can specify which network connections the Mac should look for, and in which 
order. You can even turn off some connections entirely. For example, if you have a desktop Mac that's always connected to 
a cable modem, you may never want your Mac to dial using its built-in modem. In that case, you could turn off the modem 
entirely.
Here's how to go about using this multihoming feature:
1.  Open System Preferences. Click the Network icon. 
Panther's new Network Status screen (Figure 18-1) brings home the point of multihoming: You can have more than 
one network connection operating at once.
Make sure the appropriate location is selected in the Location pop-up menu.
2.  From the Show pop-up menu, choose Network Port Configurations. 
Now you see the display shown in Figure 18-8. It lists all the different ways your Mac knows how to get online, or 
onto an office network.
The key to multihoming is sliding the network connection methods' names up or down 
(and turning off the ones you don't intend to use in this location). You can also rename 
the different configurations by double-clicking them.

18.7 Multihoming
 
3.  Drag the items up and down in the list into priority order. 
If you have a wired broadband connection, for example, you might want to drag Built-in Ethernet to the top of the 
list, since that's almost always the fastest way to get online.
At this point, you can also turn off any connections you don't want your Mac to use when it's in this location—the 
internal modem, for example.
4.  Click Apply Now. 
Your Mac will now be able to switch connections even in real time, during a single Internet session. If lightning 
takes out your cable modem in the middle of your Web surfing, your Mac will seamlessly switch to your AirPort 
network, for example, to keep your session alive.

18.8 Internet Sharing

18.8 Internet Sharing
If you have cable modem or DSL service, you're a very lucky individual. Not only do you benefit from great speed when 
surfing the Web or processing email, but your connection is on full-time. You never have to wait for some modem to dial 
(screeching all the way), and wait again for it to disconnect. Too bad only one computer in your household or office can 
enjoy these luxuries.
Actually, it doesn't have to be that way. You can spread the joy of high-speed Internet to every Mac (and PC) on your 
network in either of two ways:
G     Buy a router. A router (sometimes called a residential gateway) is a little box, costing about $50, that connects 
directly to the cable modem or DSL box. In most cases, it doubles as a hub, providing multiple Internet jacks into 
which you can plug your Macs and PCs. As a bonus, a router provides excellent security, serving as a firewall to 
keep out unsolicited visits from hackers on the Internet. (If you use a router, turn off Mac OS X's own firewall, as 
described previously in this chapter.)
G     Use Internet Sharing. Panther's Internet Sharing feature is the software version of a router, in that it distributes a 
single Internet signal to every computer on the network. But unlike a router, it's free. You just fire it up on the one 
Mac that's connected directly to the Internet—the gateway computer. (The Internet Sharing feature is also 
responsible for Mac OS X's software base station feature for AirPort Macs, as described in Section 18.8.1.)
But there's a downside: If the gateway Mac is turned off or asleep, none of the other machines can get online.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Internet Sharing Using a Modem
My eMac isn't anywhere close to a phone jack. Can I use Internet Sharing to get online via the dial-up modem 
of my upstairs Power Mac? 
As long as your eMac is connected to the gateway machine via a network (Ethernet or AirPort), the answer is 
yes.
Think about it: Dial-up modems and Bluetooth cell phones may be listed in the Network panel of System 
Preferences, but they're only connections to the Internet, not connections to your home network. 
If you want the gateway Mac to share its dial-up or Bluetooth connection with other machines on your 
network, therefore, the selected Location (Section 18.5) must list both the modem/Bluetooth connection and 
either Ethernet, AirPort, or FireWire.
The bottom line: If the Show pop-up menu in your Network panel shows only Internal Modem or only 
Bluetooth, then you won't be able to turn on Internet Sharing at all
Most people use Internet Sharing to share a broadband connection like a cable modem or DSL. But in fact, Internet Sharing 
works even if the gateway Mac connects to the Internet via dial-up modem or even a Bluetooth cell phone.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-8.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 5:05:37 AM

18.8 Internet Sharing
The only requirement is that the gateway Mac also has a network connection (Ethernet, AirPort, or FireWire) to the Macs 
that will share the connection.
18.8.1 Turning on Internet Sharing
To turn on Internet Sharing on the gateway Mac, open the Sharing panel of System Preferences. Click the Internet tab and 
then click Start, as shown in Figure 18-9. (In most setups, you'll want to turn on Internet Sharing only on the gateway Mac.)
Ka-ching! Mac OS X's Internet Sharing button just saved you the cost of a $50 hardware router. 
In this example, the Mac is connected a cable modem via Ethernet. But other Macs are 
connected to it via wireless AirPort and by a FireWire cable (Section 12.1.3.) And now they can 
get online, too, even though they're not directly connected to the cable modem.
 
To set up sharing, you have to specify (a) how the gateway Mac is connected to the Internet, and (b) how it's connected to 
the other Macs on your office network:
G     Share your connection from. Using this pop-up menu, identify how this Mac (the gateway machine) connects to 
the Internet—via Built-in Ethernet, Internet Modem, or whatever. If you turn on AirPort, you create the software

base-station effect described in the next section.
G     To computers using. Turn on the checkboxes to teach your Mac how the other Macs are connected to it—via 
what form of networking, in other words.
NOTE
Which checkboxes appear here depend on which kinds of Internet connections are turned on in the Network 
panel of System Preferences. If the gateway Mac doesn't have an AirPort card installed, for example, or if 
AirPort is turned off in the current configuration, the AirPort option doesn't appear.
Now visit each of the other Macs on the same network. Open the Network panel of System Preferences. Using the Show 
pop-up menu, choose AirPort, Built-in Ethernet, or FireWire—whichever reflects how each Mac is connected to your 
network. Then, from the Configure pop-up menu, choose Using DHCP. Leave everything else blank, as shown in Figure 18-
8. Finally, click Apply Now.
As long as the gateway Mac remains turned on, you should find that both it and your other Macs can get onto the Internet 
simultaneously, all at high speed. (Even Windows PCs on the same network can also get online, as long as you set them 
up to use DHCP just as you did your "downstream" Macs.)
NOTE
If you're like most people, your gateway Mac has only one Ethernet port. How, you may wonder, can you 
plug in both the cable modem and the local network?
One approach is to install a second Ethernet card. The more economical approach: Connect the cable 
modem to the Uplink or WAN jack on your Ethernet hub. (On some hubs, an ordinary Ethernet port can be 
turned into an Uplink port if you flip a tiny switch.) Your gateway Mac plugs into the hub as usual.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Internet Sharing as a Bridge
Ordinarily, only one Mac has Internet Sharing turned on—the one that's connected directly to the Internet.
There are, however, times when you might want another machine "downstream" to have it turned on, too. 
That's when you want to bridge two networks. 
Consider the setup illustrated here, where there are really two different networks: one that uses AirPort, and 
another connected to an Ethernet hub.
If you play your cards right, you can actually set things up so that all of these Macs can get online 
simultaneously, using a single Internet connection.
Set up the gateway Mac so that it's an AirPort base station, exactly as described on these pages.
Start setting up the bridge Mac the way you'd set up the other AirPort Macs—with AirPort selected as the 
primary connection method, and "Using DHCP" turned on in the Network panel.

18.8 Internet Sharing
Then visit the bridge Mac's Sharing panel. Turn on Internet Sharing here, too, but this time select "To 
computers using: Built-in Ethernet."
The bridge Mac is now communicating on both networks. It uses the AirPort connection as a bridge to the 
gateway Mac and the Internet—and its Ethernet connection to share that happiness with the wired Macs in its 
own neighborhood
 
18.8.2 The Software Base Station Effect
If the gateway Mac has an AirPort card, turning on Internet Sharing (and "To computers using: AirPort") has another 
profound effect: It creates a software base station. The Mac itself is now the transmitter for Internet signals to and from any 
other AirPort-equipped Macs within range. You just saved yourself the cost of a physical, flying saucer Apple base station!
Internet Sharing can create the opposite effect, too: Instead of letting a wireless Mac 
piggyback on a wired Mac's connection, you can let a wired Mac share a wireless connection.
Suppose, for example, that you and a buddy both have laptops in a hotel lobby. You're 
online, using the hotel's WiFi network and your laptop's AirPort card. If you set up Internet 
Sharing appropriately, your buddy, who was too cheap to buy an AirPort for his laptop, can 
connect to yours via an Ethernet cable or even a FireWire cable—and surf along with you!

18.9 .Mac Services
In January 2000, Apple CEO Steve Jobs explained to the Macworld Expo crowds that he and his team had had a mighty 
brainstorm: Apple controls both ends of the connection between a Mac and the Apple Web site. As a result, Apple should 
be able to create some pretty clever Internet-based features as a reward to loyal Mac fans. Later that same day, the Apple 
Web site offered a suite of free services called iTools.
Then the technology bubble burst.
These days, .Mac subscriptions (as they're now called) cost $100 per year. For a full description, see Figure 18-10. 
The .Mac features appear as buttons down the left side of the .Mac Web site. For example, the 
iCards feature lets you send attractively designed electronic greeting cards by email to anyone 
on the Internet. The Backup feature works in conjunction with a basic backup program that you 
can download from this site. Webmail, HomePage, a virus program, and features that 
synchronize your iCal and iSync data with other computers are the other second-tier features. 
The best feature, however, is iDisk.
 
18.9.1 Signing Up for .Mac

18.9 .Mac Services
Open System Preferences and click the .Mac icon. Click Sign Up.
You now go online, where your Web browser has opened up to the .Mac sign-up screen. Fill in your name and address, 
make up an account name and password, turn off the checkbox that invites you to get junk mail, and so on.
The final step is to return to the Internet pane of System Preferences. On the .Mac tab, fill in the account name and 
password you just composed, if necessary. You're ready to use .Mac.
18.9.2 iDisk
The crown jewel of the .Mac services is iDisk, which creates a 100 MB hard-drive icon on your desktop. (For more money, 
you can opt for a bigger iDisk.) Anything you drag into the folders inside this icon gets copied to Apple's secure servers on 
the Internet. Meanwhile, on your end, it appears to work just like a hard drive.
In other words, iDisk can be a handy pseudo-floppy or pseudo-Zip drive. Better, in fact; because this backup disk is off-site, 
if a fire or thief destroys your office and your backup disks, your iDisk is still safe.
Furthermore, you can pull the iDisk onto any computer's screen—Mac or Windows —at your office, at your home, at your 
friend's house, so you don't need to carry around a physical disk to transport important files.
Best of all, the iDisk is extremely well integrated into Mac OS X. For example, when you're saving a document from within a 
program, you can save it directly onto your iDisk.
18.9.2.1 Pulling it onto your screen
Apple must really love the iDisk concept, because it has devised about 300 different ways to pull the iDisk icon onto your 
screen (Figure 18-11):
G     Choose Go
iDisk
My iDisk (or press Shift-
-I).
G     Click the iDisk icon in the Sidebar of a Finder window, or in the Sidebar of a Save or Open dialog box.
G     Choose Go
Connect to Server. At the bottom of the resulting dialog box, type http://idisk.mac.com/yourname 
(substitute your actual account name for yourname). Press Enter. Type your .Mac name and password, if 
necessary, and then click Connect. (This is the quickest approach if you're using somebody else's Mac OS X 
machine.)
G     Visit www.mac.com and click the iDisk icon. Type in your name and password, and then click Enter. Finally, click 
Open Your iDisk. (Clearly, this is a lot more work than the one-click methods already described. Use this technique 
when you're using a Mac OS 9 machine far from home, for example.)
At this point, the iDisk behaves like an external hard drive. You can drag files or folders from your hard drive into one of the 
folders that appear on the iDisk.
NOTE
You can't create your own folders in the iDisk's main window. You must put your files and folders into one of 
the folders already on the iDisk, such as Documents or Pictures. If you try to drag an icon directly into the 
iDisk window, or onto the iDisk icon, for example, you'll get an error message.

18.9 .Mac Services
Choose Go
iDisk (top) or click the iDisk icon in your Sidebar. When the iDisk finally appears 
(bottom right), double-click it—and wait—to see its contents (bottom left). Note that you can't 
create your own folders on this special disk; you must drag your files directly into one of the 
folders shown here.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
The Secret Software Stash
The Software folder on your iDisk is different from all the others. It holds an entire software collection you 
didn't even know you had.
Inside are various folders containing Apple software updates, the latest iLife programs like iMovie and iPhoto, 
hundreds of free MP3 files for use in your iMovie flicks, and demos of dozens of Mac OS X programs. After 
reviewing these programs, drag the software you want to your hard drive or your desktop. You can open or 
install it from there. (Fortunately, none of this eats into your 100 MB limit, and none of it is mirrored on your 
hard drive like your own iDisk stuff.)
Thereafter, you can retrieve or open whatever you copied to the iDisk. Open one of the folders on it; you can now open, 
rename, trash, or copy (to your hard drive) whatever you find inside.
18.9.2.2 Making the iDisk fast and synchronized
As you can imagine, copying files to and from a disk through a phone line (or even a cable modem) is very slow compared 
to copying them between hard drives on the same Mac. The iDisk has a reputation, therefore, of being very slow.
But in Mac OS X 10.3, the iDisk no longer needs to run at the speed of an anesthetized slug. Behind the scenes, Mac OS X 
10.3 can keep a full, invisible copy of the iDisk's contents on your hard drive. When you add something to the iDisk, 
therefore, it seems to appear there instantly—even when you're not online—because all you've done is copy something 
onto a secret stash of your own drive. The Mac will begin the process of transmitting the copy to the online iDisk at the next 
opportunity.
In short, you can leave the iDisk's icon onscreen for as long as you like, even when you're offline.
To turn on this feature, see Figure 18-12. 
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The iDisk from Windows
In the old days, you could only get to your iDisk from a Macintosh. These days, you can bring your iDisk onto 
the screen of any computer, even one running Windows or Linux.
The procedure varies by operating system, but the general idea is the same: You're going to create a new 
"hard drive" in your My Computer window whose icon represents the iDisk.
If you have Windows XP and plan to connect regularly, you can download the free iDisk Utility for Windows, 
which makes pulling up someone's iDisk a simple matter of a couple of clicks. Visit www.mac.com and click .
Mac Downloads to find it.
Otherwise, here are the steps for different Windows versions:

18.9 .Mac Services
Windows XP: Choose Tools
Map Network Drive in any desktop window.
Windows 2000: Choose Tools
Map Network Drive. Click "Web folder or FTP site."
Windows 98: Open My Computer. Double-click the Web Folders icon; double-click Add Web Folder.
In each case, you should now type in this address as the location to add: http://idisk.mac.com/yourname 
(where yourname is your .Mac member name), as shown here. When you're asked for a name and password, 
type in your usual .Mac name and password.
After a minute or two, you'll find the icon for your iDisk in the My Computer window, sitting there as though it's 
a hard drive attached to the PC. In Windows XP, for example, it's in the Network Drives category, called 
something like "Frank23 on 'idisk.mac.com.'"
 
If you have more than one Mac in different locations (home and office, for example), you can 
keep your key files synchronized among all of them by turning on this automatic iDisk 
syncing on all of the machines. You've burned your last "Take Home" CD!
Top: To turn on iDisk syncing, open System Preferences, click .Mac, and turn on "Create a local 
copy of your iDisk."
Bottom: If you leave "Synchronize: Automatically" selected (best if you have a broadband 
connection), your Mac will keep your iDisk and your hard drive's copy updated to match each 
other, checking periodically for changes. (It will make the first copy as soon as you quit System 
Preferences.) If you opt for manual synchronization, (because you're using a dial-up 
connection, for example), you have to trigger your own syncs by clicking the little Sync button 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-9.html (5 of 11)5/3/2004 5:05:43 AM

next to the iDisk's name in the Sidebar. Note, too, that you can switch between automatic and 
manual syncing by clicking the iDisk in the Sidebar and then turning Automatic on or off in the 
Action menu.
 
18.9.2.3 The Public folder
In general, whatever you put onto your iDisk is private and password-protected. There's one exception, however: Whatever 
you put into the Public folder on any iDisk can be seen, opened, and copied by any other .Mac member. All they need is 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-9.html (6 of 11)5/3/2004 5:05:43 AM

18.9 .Mac Services
your member name—not your password. (Think of the iDisk Public folder as the long-lost twin of the Public folder in your 
own Home folder.)
The Public folder is terrific for storing family photos where anyone who's interested can look at them. It's also handy when 
you're collaborating; just post the latest drafts of your work in the Public folder for your co-workers to review.
To view someone else's Public folder, use one of these techniques (suppose the person's .Mac name is SkiBunny23):
G     From Mac OS X 10.3. Choose Go
iDisk
Other User's Public Folder. Type in the person's member name 
and hit Return. 
G     Mac OS X 10.1 or 10.2. Choose Go
Connect to Server. At the bottom of the dialog box, type http://idisk.mac.
com/skibunny23/Public. Click Connect or press Enter. If a password is required, use public as the user name and, 
well, the password as the password. 
Actually, there's a simpler way: Use iDisk Utility, described below.
G     From Mac OS 9. Choose 
Chooser, click AppleShare, click the Server IP Address button, type idisk.mac.
com in the Server Address box, and then click Connect. Type skibunny23; for the password, use public (unless the 
folder really is password- protected, in which case you should type the password you were given). Then click 
Connect. Select the iDisk and then click OK. 
NOTE
Apple announced its intention to turn off AppleTalk access to the iDisk at the end of 2003. If this method no 
longer works, therefore, you'll have to search www.versiontracker.com, for example, to find a shareware 
program that carries on this function from Mac OS 9.
G     From Windows. See the box in Section 18.9.2.2 
After a minute or so, a new iDisk icon appears on your desktop, bearing that member's name. Double-click it to view its 
contents. You can copy these files to your hard drive, or double-click them to open them directly.
18.9.2.4 iDisk Options
If you open System Preferences and click the .Mac icon, you're offered a few interesting options, along with a graph that 
shows how full your iDisk is getting.
Here, you can also make these changes:
G     Let people put stuff in your Public folder. Ordinarily, other people can deposit stuff into your Public folder as well 
as copy things out. If you'd rather set it up so that only you can drop things in there, click "Read only."
G     Password-protect your Public folder. Probably a good idea if you decide to make your Public folder available for 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-9.html (7 of 11)5/3/2004 5:05:43 AM

deposits.
NOTE
These functions are available to pre-Panther people (and Windows people) if they visit www.mac.com click ".
Mac Downloads," sign in, and download the program called iDisk Utility (or iDisk Utility for Windows).
18.9.3 Email
Apple offers an email address to each .Mac member.
Of course, anyone who's able to get to the Apple Web site probably already has an email account. So why bother? The first 
advantage is the simple address: YourName@mac.com. And because .Mac is a Mac-only service, the odds are good that 
you'll be able to claim the name you want. No longer must you be known as bgates28514@earthlink.net. (Cultdom has its 
privileges.)
Second, Mac.com addresses are integrated into the Mail program that comes with Mac OS X, as you'll see in the next 
chapter. And finally, you can read your .Mac email from any computer anywhere in the world, via the www.mac.com Web 
site.
18.9.4 HomePage
Creating a Web page (an HTML document) isn't difficult. Using a program like Dreamweaver, GoLive, Netscape Composer, 
or even AppleWorks, you can design the text and graphics for a simple Web page in a single afternoon.
It's much more difficult, however, to figure out how to post that Web page—to hang it on the Internet where the world can 
see it. To do that, you need special software, several passwords and codes, and a lot of help from your ISP.
The .Mac HomePage feature eliminates all that hassle. All you have to do is drag your Web-page documents and graphics 
into the Sites folder on your iDisk (described in the previous section). Your Web page is instantly available for viewing by 
the 300 million people on the Internet.
You can create as many Web pages as you want. When you return to the HomePage 
screen, a list of your existing Web pages appears (complete with Edit Page and Delete Page 
buttons).
If you already know how to design Web pages, great; put the HTML documents and graphics you've created into the Sites 
folder of your iDisk.
Then tell your friends its Web address. Suppose that the Web page you designed is called index.html, and that your .Mac 
member name is SkiBunny. In that case, your custom-designed Web address is homepage.mac.com/skibunny/index.html 
(although most people can leave off everything after your member name).
And if you have no experience designing Web pages, you can use Mac OS X itself to help you:

18.9 .Mac Services
G     iPhoto and Image Capture can both turn photos downloaded from your digital camera into handsome art-gallery 
Web pages. After they've done so, drag the resulting HTML documents and image folders into your iDisk's Sites 
folder. Presto: you've got yourself a photo-gallery Web page.
G     Sign into www.mac.com If you click HomePage, you'll find a large gallery of canned Web site design templates that 
you can easily fill up and post in cyberspace: photo albums, movie players, résumés, baby announcements, and so 
on.
When you finally click the Publish button at the top of the screen, new Web page (HTML) documents appear in the 
Sites folder of your iDisk. Also, your screen now displays your page's URL (Web address), which you can email to 
anyone who'd be interested. Unfortunately, it's not particularly catchy: it's along the lines of http://homepage.mac.
com/YourMemberName/baby.html. 
Finally, your Web page is available for anyone on the Internet to see. Corporations and professional Web designers may 
sniff at the simplicity of the result—but it takes them a lot longer than ten minutes to do their thing.
18.9.5 Backup
.Mac membership also includes access to a program called Backup 2.0, which can give you an effortless, even automatic 
backup system for your most important files. It's also among the easiest-to-use backup programs ever written.
After you've downloaded the Backup program (from www.mac.com) and installed it, you'll find the Backup icon in your 
Applications folder. Opening it produces what you see in Figure 18-13. 
Backup starts you out with Quick Picks—checkboxes for stuff Apple thinks you might want to 
back up, including some you might not think of (like Safari bookmarks). Incidentally, Backup 
requires an Internet connection; each time you back up, it checks in with the mother ship to 
con- firm that you're a .Mac member (although you can restore your stuff even if you're not).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-9.html (9 of 11)5/3/2004 5:05:43 AM

18.9 .Mac Services
 
Here's how to back up your stuff:
1.  Specify what to back up. 
Turn on the Quick Pick checkboxes, for example (Figure 18-13), or drag folders and files right off your desktop into 
the Backup list. In general, you'll want to back up only the stuff in your Home folder. After all, you don't need to 
back up Mac OS X itself or your programs, because you have the original discs (right?).
To remove something from the list, click it and then press the Delete key.
As you build your list, Backup shows you how much space (or how many discs) you'll need.
If you click a folder, and then click the Info button (the round i), you're shown a list of 
the files in that folder, so that you can exclude certain files.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-18-SECT-9.html (10 of 11)5/3/2004 5:05:43 AM

18.9 .Mac Services
2.  Specify where you want Backup to put your safety copies. 
The top pop-up menu lets you choose where you want to make your backup copy: on your iDisk, on a blank CD or 
DVD, onto a flash drive (Section 10.1.1.4), or on another hard drive—an external hard drive, an iPod, another 
computer on the network, or whatever. (If you have too much stuff to fit on your iDisk, you'll have to choose fewer 
files to back up. If you have too much stuff to fit on a CD or DVD, on the other hand, Backup can split the job 
across multiple discs.)
3.  Click Backup Now. 
If you've opted to back up onto blank discs, Backup asks you to name the backup set (like Essentials, 2/2/04), then 
tells you when to insert new discs. (It's fine to use a combination of blank CDs and DVDs.)
In any case, Backup now whirls into action, making the safety copies (and replacing any earlier copies of them).
If you're backing up onto your iDisk or a hard drive, you can set up Backup to make 
automatic backups according to a schedule, just by clicking the Schedule Backups button. 
Backup will kick in at the scheduled time, assuming your Mac is on, your account is logged 
in, and the Backup program isn't already running. (To find out if your scheduled backup took 
place, choose File
Show Log.)
If disaster should ever befall your files—dead hard drive, clueless spouse, overtired self—you'll be glad you went through 
this exercise. Insert the CD or DVD (or connect the hard drive or iDisk) and then use the appropriate Restore command 
from Backup's top pop-up menu. Turn on the Restore checkboxes next to the stuff you want, and then click restore Now.

18.10 Internet Location Files

18.10 Internet Location Files
One of the least convenient aspects of using the Internet is having to remember the often cumbersome addresses for 
various Internet features. The Mac offers a clever way to manage and memorize these addresses: Internet location files. 
Figure 18-14 shows the procedure for creating one of these special clipping files.
The idea is simple: When you double-click an Internet location file, your Web browser opens automatically to that page, or 
your email program launches and generates a new, blank, preaddressed outgoing message.
To create an Internet location file, highlight an Internet address in any dragand- droppable 
program (like TextEdit or Stickies). Drag the highlighted text to your desktop, where it becomes 
an Internet location file.
 
In other words, an Internet location file is like a system-wide Bookmarks feature. You might consider gathering together the 
location files for Web sites you frequently visit, put them into a folder, and put that folder into the Dock. Do the same with 
addresses to which you frequently send email. Thereafter, you save a step every time you want to jump to a particular Web 
page or send email to a particular person—just choose the appropriate name from the Dock folder's pop-up menu.
Rename your Internet location files. Doing so doesn't affect their original programming—they 
still take you to the same Web pages or email addresses—but it lets you substitute plain 
English names ("Bob Smith" instead of bsmith@earthlink.net, for example).
Although Web and email addresses are by far the most popular uses of the Internet location file feature, they're not the only 
ones. You can also create location files for the addresses of newsgroups (news://news.apple.com ), FTP sites (ftp.apple.

Chapter 19. Mail and Address Book
Email is a fast, cheap, convenient communication medium; these days, anyone who doesn't have an email address is 
considered some kind of weirdo. If you do have one, though, you'll be happy to discover that Mac OS X includes Mail, a 
program that lets you get and send email messages—without having to wade through a lot of spam (junk mail). Mail is a 
surprisingly complete, refreshingly attractive program, much improved in Mac OS X 10.3, that's filled with shortcuts and 
surprises. And it's free.

 < Day Day Up >  
 
19.1 Setting Up Mail
What you see the first time you open Mail (by clicking its icon on the Dock, for example) may vary. If you've signed up for a 
Mac.com account (and typed its name into System Preferences as described in Section 8.2), you're all ready to go.
If you're using a regular Internet service provider (ISP) account instead, you'll confront the dialog box shown in Figure 19-1, 
where you're supposed to input the various settings to specify your email account. (Some of this information may require 
the help of your ISP's phone representative.) Here's the rundown:
G     Full Name will appear in the "From:" field of the email you send. Type it just way you'd like it to appear.
G     Email Address. This is the address you were assigned when you signed up Internet services, such as 
billg@microsoft.com. 
G     Account Type, Incoming Mail Server, Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP). Enter the information your ISP gave you 
about its mail servers: the type of server, the name of the incoming mail server, and the name of the outgoing mail 
server. The incoming server is often a POP3 server and its name is connected to the name of your ISP, such as 
popmail.mindspring.com. The outgoing mail server (also called the SMTP server) looks something like mail.
mindspring.com.
G     Outlook Web Access Server. This setting only appears if you choose Exchange for the Account Type. You can 
get the name of this server (also known as an Internet Information Server or IIS) from your network administrator.
G     User Name, Password. Enter the name and password provided by your ISP.
Click OK when you're finished.
This dialog box lets you plug in the email settings provided by your ISP. If you want to add 
another email account later, choose Mail
Preferences, click Accounts, and click the plus 
sign in the lower-left corner. Then enter all your information on the right side of the window.

19.1 Setting Up Mail
 
Now Mail offers to import your email collection from whichever email program you used before—Entourage, Outlook 
Express, Claris Emailer, Netscape, Mozilla, Eudora, or even a version of OS X's Mail program that's stored somewhere 
else. Importing is a big help in making a smooth transition between your old email world and your new one. Figure 19-2 has 
the details.

19.2 Checking Your Mail
You get new mail and send mail you've written using the Get Mail command. You can trigger it in any of several ways:
G     Click Get Mail on the toolbar.
G     Choose Mailbox
Get New Mail (or press Shift-
-N).
NOTE
If you have multiple accounts, Get New Mail turns into a menu of its own. Choose "In All Accounts" to check 
all of your mailboxes at once, or check only a specific mailbox by selecting its name.
G     Control-click (or right-click) Mail's dock icon, and choose Get New Mail. (You can use this method from any 
program, as long as Mail is already open.)
G     Wait. Mail comes set to check your email automatically every few minutes. To adjust its timing or turn it off 
completely, choose Mail
Preferences, click General, and choose a time interval from the "Check for new mail" 
pop-up menu.
Now Mail contacts the mail servers listed in the Accounts pane of Mail's preferences, retrieving new messages and 
downloading any files attached to those messages. It also sends any outgoing messages and their attachments.
If you click Yes (top), Mail offers to import your old email collection from just about any other 
Mac email program (bottom left). You can even specify which email folders you want to import 
(bottom right). When the importing process is finished (it can take a very long time) you'll find 
precisely the same folders already set up in Mail. (If you ever want to import mail from another 
program, choose File
 Import Mailboxes.)

19.2 Checking Your Mail
The Activity window gives you a Stop button, progress bars, and other useful information. 
Summon it by choosing Window
Activity Viewer, or by clicking the spinning progress 
indicator that appears in the upper-right corner of the Mail window when it's checking for new 
messages.
2.1 The Mailbox Drawer
Mail organizes your email into folders—mailboxes—at one side of the screen, in a sliding drawer (Figure 19-3). The 
Mailboxes icon on the toolbar opens and closes it. You may find the following mailbox folders, which are sometimes hidden 
by flippy triangles, in the drawer:
UP TO SPEED
POP, IMAP, Exchange, and Web-based Mail
When it comes to email, there are four primary flavors of servers (Internet computers that process email): 
POP (also known as POP3), IMAP (also known as IMAP4), Exchange, and Web-based. Each has its own 
distinct feeling, with different strengths and weaknesses. (AOL mail could be considered a fifth kind, but Mail 
can't work with it.)
POP accounts are the most common kind. A POP server transfers your incoming mail to your hard drive 
before you read it, which works fine as long as you're only using one computer to access your email.
If you want to take your email world along with you on the road, you have to copy the Mail folder in your 
Home
 Library folder into the corresponding location on your laptop's hard drive. When you run Mail on 
the laptop, you'll find your messages and attachments already in place.
IMAP servers are newer and have more features than POP servers, but aren't as popular or as common. 
IMAP servers store all of your mail online for you, rather than making you download it each time you connect. 
As a result, you can access the same mail regardless of the computer you use. IMAP servers remember 
which messages you've read and sent, to boot. (Your Mac.com account is an IMAP account, which is why you 
can access the mail in your Inbox repeatedly from any Mac in the world. As a bonus, you can read your .Mac 
email from any Web browser at www.mac.com.)
One downside to this approach, of course, is that you can't delete your email, or read it for the first time, 
unless you're online, because all of your mail is on an Internet server. Another disadvantage is that if you 
don't conscientiously manually delete mail after you've read it, your online mailbox eventually overflows. 
Sooner or later, the system starts bouncing new messages back to their senders, annoying your friends and 
depriving you of the chance to read what they had to say.
Exchange servers are central email hubs that are popular in corporations. Most of the time, employees tap 
into these servers using a Windows email program like Outlook. Corporate information-tech types like 
Exchange servers because they're easy to set up and maintain, and because they offer many of the same 
features as IMAP servers.
In Panther, for the first time, Mail can read and send email through Exchange servers as though your Mac 
were just another beige PC.

19.2 Checking Your Mail
Free, Web-based servers like Hotmail also store your mail on the Internet, and you can use a Web browser 
on any computer to read and send messages. They're slower and more cumbersome to use than regular 
email accounts, but they're often free. Mail can't check Web-based accounts at all.
Some email accounts, however, let you check for new messages either with either a mail program or a Web 
browser. If you have a .Mac account, you'll find that your email system falls into this category—and Mail can 
certainly communicate with a .Mac account
G     In holds mail you've received. If you have more than one email account, you can expand its flippy triangle to see 
the separate folders for your individual accounts. You'll see this pattern repeated with the Sent, Junk, and other 
mailboxes, too—separate accounts have separate headings under the main one.
If you're not already online, you can click the small lightning-bolt icon next to the Inbox to 
connect and check that email account for new messages.
G     Out holds mail you've written but hasn't yet been sent.
G     Drafts holds messages you've started but haven't yet finished, and don't want to send just yet.
G     Sent holds copies of messages you've sent.
G     Junk appears automatically when you use Mail's spam filter, as described later in this chapter.
G     On My Mac is a folder where you can file messages, within subfolders, from a standard ISP account (Earthlink, for 
example).
G     Trash works a lot like the Trash on your desktop, in that messages you put there don't actually disappear. They 
remain in the Trash folder until you permanently delete them or move them somewhere else.
To see what's in one of these folders, click it once. The list of its messages appears in the top half of the main window. 
When you click a message name, the message itself appears in the bottom half of the main window.
The many panes of Mail. Click a mailbox icon in the drawer to see its contents in the upper-left 
pane. When you click the name of a message in the main list (or press the up and down arrow 
keys to highlight successive message names in that list), you see the message itself, along 
with any attachments, in the Preview pane.

19.3 Writing Messages
To send an email, click the New toolbar button. The New Message form, shown in Figure 19-4, opens. Here's how you go 
about writing a message:
1.  Type the email address of the recipient in the "To:" field. 
If somebody is in your address book ( Section 19.6), just type the first couple letters of the name; Mail automatically 
completes the address. (If the first guess is wrong, just type another letter or two until Mail revises its guess.)
As in most dialog boxes, you can jump from blank to blank (from the "To:" field to the CC field, for example) by 
pressing the Tab key.
If you want to send this message to more than one person, separate their addresses with commas:bob@earthlink.
net, billg@microsoft.com, steve@apple.com. 
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The Mighty Morphing Interface
You don't have to be content with the factory-installed design of the Mail screen; you can control 
almost every aspect of its look and layout.
For example, you can control the main window's information columns exactly as you would in a Finder 
list view window—make a column narrower or wider by dragging the right edge of its column heading, 
rearrange the columns by dragging their titles, and so on. You can also control which columns appear 
using the commands in the View
Columns menu. Similarly, you can sort your email by clicking 
these column headings, exactly as in the Finder (click a second time to reverse the sorting).
The various panels of the main window are also under your control. For example, you can drag the 
divider bar—between the list of messages and the Preview pane—up or down to adjust the relative 
proportions, as shown here. In fact, you can get rid of the Preview pane altogether just by 
doubleclicking the divider line, double-clicking just above the vertical scroll bar, or dragging the divider 
line's handle all the way to the bottom of the screen. (Bring it back by dragging the divider line up from 
the bottom.)
You can also control the mailbox's drawer. Drag its outer edge inward or outward to make the drawer 
wider or narrower, for example. You can even make the drawer disappear or reappear by clicking the 
Mailboxes icon on the toolbar or by choosing View
Hide Mailboxes (or
Show Mailboxes) 
command.
If you'd like to swap the drawer to the other side of the main window, drag a message in the main 
message list horizontally toward the side where you want the drawer to appear.
Finally, you have full control over the toolbar, which works much like the Finder toolbar. You can 
rearrange or remove icon buttons (by 
-dragging them); add interesting new buttons to the toolbar

(by choosing View
Customize Toolbar); change its display to show just text labels or just icons—
either large or small (by repeatedly 
-clicking the white, oval, upper-right toolbar button); or hide the 
toolbar entirely (by clicking that white button or using the View
 Hide Toolbar command).
 
If you send most of your email to addresses within the same organization (like 
reddelicious@apple.com, grannysmith@apple.com, and winesap@apple.com), Mail 
can automatically turn all other email addresses red. It's a new Panther feature 
designed to avoid sending confidential messages to outside addresses.
To turn on this feature, choose Mail
Preferences, click Composing, turn on "Mark 
addresses not in this domain," and type the "safe" domain (like apple.com) into the 
blank.
2.  To send a copy of the message to other recipients, enter the email address(es) in the CC field. 
CC stands for carbon copy. Getting an email message where your name is in the CC line implies: "I sent you a 
copy because I thought you'd want to know about this correspondence, but I'm not expecting you to reply."
Here's a new Panther feature for you. If Mail recognizes the address you type into the 
"To:" or CC box (because it's someone in your Address Book), the name turns into a 
shaded, round-ended box button. Besides looking cool, these buttons have a small 
triangle on their right; when you click it, you get a list of useful commands (including 
Open in Address Book).
These buttons are also drag-and-droppable. For example, you can drag one from the 
"To:" box to the CC field, or from the Address Book to Mail.
A message has two sections: the header, which holds information about the message; 
and the body, the big empty white area that contains the message itself. In addition, the 
Mail window has a toolbar, which you can use to access other features for composing 
and sending messages. The Signature pop-up menu doesn't exist until you create a 
signature (Section 19.3.3).

3.  Type the topic of the message in the Subject field. 
It's courteous to put some thought into the Subject line (use "Change in plans for next week" instead of "Yo"). Don't 
leave it blank; you'll just annoy your recipient.
4.  Specify an email format. 
There are two kinds of email: plain text and formatted (what Apple calls Rich Text). Plain text messages are faster 
to send and open, are universally compatible with the world's email programs, and are greatly preferred by many 
veteran computer fans. And even though the message is plain, you can still attach pictures and other files.
(Resourceful geeks have even learned how to fake some formatting in plain messages: They use capitals instead 
of italics [GO HOME] "smileys" instead of pictures [ :-) ], and pseudo-underlines for emphasis [I _love_ Swiss 
cheese!].)
By contrast, formatted messages sometimes open slowly, and in some email programs the formatting doesn't 
come through at all.
To control which kind of mail you send on a message-by-message basis, choose, from the Format menu, either

Make Plain Text or Make Rich Text. To change the factory setting for new outgoing messages, choose 
Mail
Preferences; click the Composing icon; and choose from the Format pop-up menu.
If you really want to use formatting, click the Fonts icon on the toolbar to open the Font 
panel described in Section 13.7.2.4 , or the Colors icon to open the Color Picker 
described in Section 4.10.4. The Format menu (in the menu bar) contains even more 
controls—paragraph alignment (left, right, or justify), and even Copy and Paste Style 
commands that let you transfer formatting from one block of text to another.

19.3 Writing Messages
If you plan to send formatted mail, remember that your recipients won't see the fonts 
you use unless their machines have the same ones installed. Bottom line: For email 
to Mac and Windows fans alike, stick to universal choices like Arial, Times, and 
Courier.
5.  Type your message in the message box. 
You can use all standard editing techniques, including copy and paste, drag-anddrop, and so on. If you selected 
the Rich Text style of email, you can even use word processor-like formatting (Figure 19-5).
As you type, Mail checks your spelling, using a dotted underline to mark questionable words (also shown in Figure 
19-5). To check for alternative spellings for a suspect word, Control-click it. From the list of suggestions in the 
contextual menu, click the word you really intended, or choose Learn Spelling to add the word to the Mac OS X 
dictionary.
Adding a word to the dictionary in Mail also adds it to the dictionaries of all other OS 
X programs that use the global Mac OS X spelling checker, and vice versa. In other 
words, you won't have to teach "speciation" to Mail, Safari, and TextEdit—only to one 
of them.
(To turn off automatic spell check, choose Edit
Spelling
Check Spelling As You Type so that the 
checkmark disappears. If you want to spell-check a message all at once, choose Edit
Spelling
Check 
Spelling [
-;] after composing it.)
If you're composing a long email message, or if it's one you don't want to send until later, click the Save as Draft 
button, press 
-S, or choose File
Save As Draft. You've just saved the message in your Drafts folder. (It will 
still be there the next time you open Mail.) To reopen a saved draft later, click the Drafts icon in the mailbox drawer, 
and then double-click the message that you want to work on.
UP TO SPEED
Blind Carbon Copies—and Reply-To
A blind carbon copy is a secret copy. This feature lets you send a copy of a message to somebody 
secretly, without any of the other recipients knowing that you did so. To view this field when 
composing a message, choose View
 Bcc Header.
You can use the BCC field to quietly signal a third party that a message has been sent. For example, 
if you send your co-worker a message that says, "Chris, it bothers me that you've been cheating the 
customers," you could BCC your supervisor to clue her in without getting into trouble with Chris.
The BCC box is useful in other ways, too. Many people send email messages (containing corny jokes, 
for example) to a long list of recipients. You, the recipient, have to scroll through a very long list of

names the sender placed in the To or CC field.
But if the sender used the BCC field to hold all the recipients' email addresses, you, the recipient, 
won't see any names but your own at the top of the email. (Unfortunately, spammers have also 
learned this trick.)
6.  Click Send (or press Shift-
-D). 
If you're not already online, your modem dials, squeals, connects to the Internet, and sends the message.
To re-send a message you already sent, Option-double-click the message in your Sent 
mailbox. Mail dutifully opens up a brand-new duplicate, ready for you to edit, readdress if you 
like, and then send again.
(The prescribed Apple route is to highlight the message and then choose Message
Send 
Again, but that's not nearly as much fun.)
If you'd rather have Mail place each message you write in the Outbox folder instead of connecting to the Net when you click 
Send, choose Mailbox
Go Offline. While you're offline, Mail will refrain from trying to connect, which is a great feature 
when you're working on a laptop at 39,000 feet. (Choose Mailbox
Go Online to reverse the procedure.)
19.3.2 Attaching Files to Messages
Sending little text messages is fine, but it's not much help when you want to send somebody a photograph, a sound, or a 
Word document. To attach a file to a message you've written, use one of these methods:
G     Drag the icons you want to attach directly off the desktop (or out of a folder) into the New Message window. There 
your attachments appear with their own hyperlinked icons (Figure 19-5), meaning that your recipient can simply 
click to open them.
The spot where you release the mouse in your message doesn't make a difference; Mail makes it look for all the 
world as though you can park the attached file's icon (or the full image of a graphics file) inside the text of the 
message, mingled with your typing. Don't be fooled, however; on the receiving end, all of the attachments will be 
clumped together at the end of the message.
Exposé (Section 4.3) was born for this moment. Hit the F11 key to make all open windows 
flee to the edges of the screen, revealing the desktop. Root around until you find the file you 
want to send. Begin dragging it; without releasing the mouse, press F11 again to bring your 
message window back into view. Complete your drag into the message window.

G     Click the Attach icon on the New Message toolbar, choose File
Attach File, or press Shift-
-A. The standard 
Open File dialog box now appears, so that you can navigate to and select the files you want to include. (You can 
choose multiple files simultaneously in this dialog box. Just 
-click or Shift-click the individual files you want, just 
as though you were selecting them in a Finder window.)
Once you've selected them, click Choose File (or press Enter). You return to the New Message window, where the 
attachments' icons appear, ready to ride along when you send the message.
To remove an attachment, drag across its icon to highlight it, and then press the Delete key. (You can also drag an 
attachment icon clear out of the window onto your Dock's Trash, or choose Message
Remove Attachments.)
If you have a high-speed connection like a cable modem, by the way, have pity on your recipient. A big picture or movie file 
might take you only seconds to send, but tie up your correspondent's modem for hours.
19.3.3 Signatures
Signatures are bits of text that get stamped at the bottom of your outgoing email messages. A signature may contain a 
name, postal address, a pithy quote, or even a scan of your real signature, as shown in Figure 19-4. 
To create a signature, choose Mail
Preferences, and then click the Signatures icon (Figure 19-6.). You can create any 
number of signatures by clicking the Add Signature button, which opens an editing sheet in which you can type your new 
signature and define a name for it.
Once you've created a signature or two, you can tack one of them onto your outgoing mail, either always or on a message-
by-message basis.
G     Always append a signature. On the Signatures preference screen (Figure 19-6, top), use the Automatically Insert 
Signature pop-up menu to choose the signature that you'd like to have in every email message. (You can always 
override this choice on a message-by-message basis.)
If you use the Select Signature pop-up menu to choose "In Random Order" or "In Sequential 
Order," Mail will choose a different one of these gems to grace the bottom of each email 
message that you send out. This is the way to rotate your quotes from, say, Monty Python, 
without seeming repetitive to your correspondents.

POWER USERS' CLINIC
Becoming Windows Friendly
In Panther, Apple introduced two features that make sending attachments more convenient than ever. First, 
you can compress your files and folders from right within the Finder-a great way to make your attachments 
take less time to send and receive (Section 2.10.3).
Second, Panther now lets you choose from two different formats for your attachments: normal or Windows-
friendly.
Normal attachments open correctly on both Macs and PCs. The trouble is, a normal attachment may show up 
on a PC accompanied by a useless, second attachment whose name starts with "._". (Your recipients should 
just ignore it.)
Windows-friendly attachments, on the other hand, always work correctly on PCs—but may not open at all on 
Macs. Unless you work in an all-Windows company, then, stick with the normal setting.
To use the Windows-friendly setting for an open message, choose Edit
Attachments
Send Windows 
Friendly Attachments. (If no message is open, the command says "Always Send Windows Friendly 
Attachments" instead). You can also adjust the setting on a per-email basis using the Send Windows Friendly 
Attachments check box at the bottom of the attachment dialog box.
G     Message by message. On the Signatures preference screen, turn on "Show signature menu on compose 
window." From now on, a Signature pop-up menu appears just above the message-body area on every outgoing 
email. When you choose from it, Mail pastes the signature into your message.
In Panther, a new option lets you specify where your signature goes when you're sending a 
reply. Ordinarily, your signature appears at the bottom of each message. But if you turn on 
"Place signature above quoted text" on the Signatures preference screen, your signature will 
always appear just above the "quoted back" text that Mail inserts when you reply to a 
message. The point is to save your recipient the pain of having to scroll past all your previous 
correspondence just to find your signature.
Top: Your list of signatures and the doorway to the signature-creation box.
Bottom: After typing some signature material, don't miss the Format menu, which you can use 
to dress up your signature with colors and other formatting. You can even drag or paste a 
picture into the signature box. Click OK when you're finished. (You'll be able to use formatted 
signatures only if you're sending Rich Text messages, of course.)

19.4 Reading Email
Mail puts all the email you get into your Inbox; the statistic in parentheses after the word In lets you know how many of its 
messages you haven't read yet. New messages are also denoted by colorful, liquidy dots in the main list.
The Mail icon in the Dock also shows you how many new messages you have waiting—it's 
the number in the red circle, as shown in Figure 19-7.
Click the In folder to see a list of received messages. If it's a long list, press Control- Page Up and Control-Page Down to 
scroll. Click the name of a message once to read it in the Preview pane, or double-click a message (or, if it's selected, just 
press Return or Enter) to open it into a separate window.
Instead of reading your mail, you might prefer to have Mac OS X read it to you, as you sit 
back in your chair and sip your strawberry daiquiri. Highlight the text you want to hear (or 
choose Edit
Select All), Control-click the selected text, and choose Speech
Start 
Speaking from the contextual menu. You'll hear the message read aloud, in the voice you've 
selected on the Speech pane of System Preferences (Chapter 8). 
To stop the insanity, choose Speech
Stop Speaking from the same contextual menu.
Once you've viewed a message, you can respond to it, delete it, print it, file it, and so on. The following pages should get 
you started.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
All the Little Symbols
The first column of the main email list shows little symbols that let you know at a glance how you've processed 
certain messages. The most common one is, of course, the gelatinous blue dot (
), which means "new 
message." (After reading a message, you can mark it once again as an unread message by choosing 
Message
Mark
As Unread—or Control-clicking the message's name and choosing Mark
 As 
Unread from the contextual menu.)
You might also see these symbols, which represent messages that you've replied to (
), forwarded (
), 
redirected (
), or flagged (
).
In Panther, however the "replied to" and "forwarded" symbols aren't just indicators—they're buttons. When 
you see one of these symbols next to your original message, click it to jump straight to your reply (or 
forwarded message). You're spared the trouble of having to search through all your mailboxes.

19.4 Reading Email
Incidentally, you may have noticed that Mail marks a message as having been read the moment you click it. 
You can change it back to unread (by using its contextual menu)—but there's also a more permanent 
workaround.
But if you hide the Preview pane by double-clicking the divider bar just above it, Mail no longer marks 
messages "read" just because you clicked one in the list. (You can bring back the Preview pane by double-
clicking just above the vertical scroll bar, or by dragging the divider bar back up from the bottom.)
19.4.1 Threading
Threading is one of the most useful mail-sorting methods to come along in a long time—and it's finally come to Mac OS X. 
When threading is turned on, Mail automatically groups emails with the same subject (like "Raccoons" and "Re: 
Raccoons"), as a single item in the main mail list.
To turn on threading, choose View
Organize by Thread. If several messages have the same subject, they all turn light 
blue to indicate their membership in a thread (see Figure 19-7).
Threads have two parts: a heading (the subject of the thread, listed in dark blue) and members 
(the individual messages in the thread, listed in light blue and intended). Often, the main list 
shows only a thread's heading; click the flippy triangle to reveal its members.
 
Here are some powerful ways to use threading:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (2 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
G     View a list of all the messages in a thread by clicking its heading. In the Preview pane, you'll see a 
comprehensive inventory of the thread. You can even click a message's name in this list to jump right to it.
G     Move all the members of a thread to a new mailbox by moving just its heading. You might find this useful, for 
example, when you've just finished a project and want to quickly file away all the email related to it. (As a bonus, a 
circled number tells you how many messages you're moving as you drag the heading.) You can even delete all the 
messages in a thread at once by simply deleting its heading.
G     Examine thread members from multiple mailboxes. Normally, threads only display messages held in the same 
mailbox, but that's not especially convenient when you want to see both messages (from your In box) and your 
replies (in your Sent box). To work around that problem, click In and then 
-click the Sent mailbox (or any other 
mailboxes you want to include). Your threads will seamlessly combine related messages from all of the selected 
mailboxes.
G     Quickly collapse all threads by choosing View
Collapse All Threads. If your main list gets cluttered with too 
many expanded threads, this is a quick way to force it into order. (If, on the other hand, your main list isn't cluttered 
enough, choose View
Expand All Threads.)
G     Send someone all the messages in a thread by selecting the thread's heading and clicking Forward. Mail 
automatically copies all the messages of the thread into a new message, putting the oldest at the top. You might 
find this useful, for example, when you want to send your boss all the correspondence you've had with someone 
about a certain project.
19.4.2 Adding the Sender to Your Address Book
Mail offers a timesaving feature: The Message
Add Sender To Address Book command. Whenever you choose it, Mail 
memorizes the email address of the person whose message is on the screen. In fact, you can highlight a huge number of 
messages and add them all simultaneously using this technique.
Thereafter, you'll be able to write new messages to somebody just by typing the first couple letters of the name or email 
address.
19.4.3 Opening Attachments
Just as you can attach files to a message, so people often send files to you. Sometimes they don't even bother to type a 
message; you wind up receiving an empty email message with a file or two attached. Only the presence of the file's icon in 
the message body tells you that there's something attached.
Mail doesn't ordinarily indicate the presence of attachments in the main mail list. It can do so, 
however. Just choose View
Columns
Attachments. A new column appears in the 
email list—at the far right—where you'll see a paper-clip icon and the number of file 
attachments listed for each message.
Mail doesn't store downloaded files as normal file icons on your hard drive. They're actually encoded right into the .mbox 
mailbox databases described in Section 19.4.12. To extract an attached file from this mass of software, you must proceed 
in one of these ways:
G     Control-click the attachment's icon, and choose Save Attachment from the contextual menu. You'll be asked to 
specify where you want to put it.
G     Drag the attachment icon out of the message window and onto any visible portion of your desktop (or any visible

19.4 Reading Email
folder).
G     Click the Save All button at the top of the email, or choose File
Save Attachments. (If the message has more 
than one attachment, this maneuver will save all of them.)
G     Double-click the attachment's icon, or single-click the blue name link underneath the icon. If you were sent a 
document (such as a photo, Word file, Excel file, and so on), it now opens in the corresponding program (Preview, 
Word, Excel, or whatever).
After the attachment is open, use the File
Save As command to save the file into a folder 
of your choice. Otherwise, any changes you make won't be visible in the file except when you 
open it from within Mail.
G     Control-click the attachment's icon. From the contextual menu, you can specify which program you want to use for 
opening it, using the Open With submenu.
19.4.3.1 When attachments don't open
Several factors may be at work if you're unable to open a file attachment. For starters, your correspondent's email program 
may have compressed or encoded the file to make it take less time to send. If you're having trouble getting a file to open, 
therefore, your first step should be to drag the attachment's icon onto that of StuffIt Expander, which is in your 
Applications
Utilities folder. This little program can gracefully decode just about any geeky Internet file. (Real Mac OS X 
masters simplify their lives by parking Expander on the Dock for easy drag-and-drop access.)
If the file still won't open, then you may be dealing with a file from a Windows PC that requires a little more effort to open. 
For example:
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Dialup Blues
If you're among the 70 percent of the population who still connects with a dial-up modem, you may find that 
Mail is painfully slow at opening and reading email—and that it slows down other Internet programs, like your 
Web browser, whenever it checks for new mail.
Fortunately, you can take a few steps to speed up Mail (and, indirectly, your other Internet applications):
Cut back on mail checks. Choose Mail
Preferences, click General, and change the "Check for new 
mail" pop-up to "Every hour," or even "Manually." That way, Mail won't tie up your phone line by trying to 
connect every five minutes.
Whenever you have a choice, don't sign up for HTML email. HTML mail takes far longer to arrive than 
plain email. Even though Mail in Panther uses Safari's super-fast HTML-displaying technology, formatted 
messages still take far more time to download. Therefore, if you ever sign up for companies' email updates 
(like Apple's eNews bulletin or the New York Times's Circuits newsletter), choose to receive the messages as 
text, not HTML.
Turn off graphics in formatted mail. If you have no choice but to receive HTML messages, the least you

19.4 Reading Email
can do is block the pictures, which are the biggest and slowest elements of a formatted message.
To do that, choose Mail
Preferences, click Viewing, and turn off "Display images and embedded objects 
in HTML messages". From now on, you'll see a special Load Images button at the top of the Preview pane 
whenever you select an HTML message. If you feel that the empty boxes (where the graphics would have 
appeared) really deprive the message of its oomph, click that button to make Mail download all the images in 
the current message—this time, only because you've asked for them.
Don't auto-download attachments. If you use an IMAP, .Mac, or Exchange account, you can set up Mail so 
that it won't download attachments until you tell it to.
Open the Accounts pane of Mail's preferences, select your account, click Advanced, and choose "All 
messages, but omit attachments" from the pop-up menu in the middle. From now on, Mail won't save 
attachments unless you command it to do so.
G     .exe denotes an executable file—in other words, a Windows program. By itself, your Mac can't run Windows 
programs, any more than a CD player can play 8-track tapes.
G     .html. A file whose name ends in .html or .htm is a Web page. In the beginning, Web pages hung out only on the 
Internet. These days, however, you're increasingly likely to find that you've downloaded one to your Mac's hard 
drive (it may be a software manual for some shareware, for example). You can open it just by double-clicking; Mac 
OS X comes set to open all .htm and .html files in Safari.
G     .vcf. A "business-card" file; see Section 19.6.2.1.
If you were sent a file with a three-letter code not listed here, you may well have yourself a file that can be opened only by a 
Windows program that you don't actually own. You might consider asking your correspondent to resend it in one of the 
more universal formats, such as the graphics formats JPEG and TIFF, or the text formats RTF and TXT. (Mac OS X opens 
all of these formats easily.)
19.4.4 Replying to a Message
To answer a message, click the Reply button on the message toolbar (or choose Message
 Reply, or just press 
-R). 
If the message was originally addressed to multiple recipients, you can send your reply to everyone simultaneously by 
clicking the Reply All button instead.
In Rich Text-formatted Mail messages (not to be confused with RTF [Rich Text Format] word 
processing format, which is very different), a reply includes the original message, marked in a 
special color (which you can change in Mail
 Preferences) and with a vertical bar to 
differentiate it from the text of your reply. (In plain-text messages, each line of the reply is 
>denoted >with >brackets, although only your recipient will see them.) The original sender's 
name is automatically placed in the To field. The subject is the same as the original subject with 
the addition of Re: (shorthand for Regarding). You're ready to type your response.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (5 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
 
A new message window opens, already addressed. As a courtesy to your correspondent, Mail places the original message 
at the bottom of the window, denoted by brackets or a vertical bar, as shown in Figure 19-8.
If you highlight some text before clicking Reply, Mail pastes only that portion of the original 
message into your reply. That's a great convenience to your correspondent, who now knows 
exactly which part of the message you're responding to.
At this point, you can add or delete recipients, edit the Subject line or the original message, attach a file, and so on.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (6 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
Use the Return key to create blank lines in the original message. Using this method, you can 
splice your own comments into the paragraphs of the original message, replying point by 
point. The brackets preceding each line of the original message help your correspondent 
keep straight what's yours and what's hers.
When you're finished, click Send. (If you click Reply All in the message window, your message goes to everyone who 
received the original note, even if you began the reply process by clicking Reply. Mac OS X, in other words, gives you a 
second chance to address your reply to everyone.)
19.4.5 Forwarding Messages
Instead of replying to the person who sent you a message, you may sometimes want to pass the note on to a third person.
To do so, click the Forward toolbar button (or choose Message
Forward, or press Shift-
-F). A new message opens, 
looking a lot like the one that appears when you reply. You may wish to precede the original message with a comment of 
your own, along the lines of: "Frank: I thought you'd be interested in this joke about Congress."
Finally, address it as you would any outgoing piece of mail.
19.4.6 Redirecting Messages
A redirected message is similar to a forwarded message, with one extremely useful difference. When you forward a 
message, your recipient sees that it came from you. When you redirect it, your recipient sees the original writer's name as 
the sender. The message bears no trace of your involvement (unless the recipient thinks to choose 
View
Message
Long Headers). In other words, a redirected message uses you as a low-profile relay station 
between two other people.
Treasure this feature. Plenty of email programs, including Outlook and Outlook Express for Windows, don't offer a Redirect 
command at all. You can use it to transfer messages from one of your own accounts to another, or to pass along a 
message that came to you by mistake.
To redirect a message, choose Message
Redirect Message, or press Shift-
-E. You get an outgoing copy of the 
message—this time without any quoting marks. (You can't edit redirected messages, since they're supposed to end up at 
their destination just as you received them.)
19.4.7 Printing Messages
Sometimes there's no substitute for a printout. Choose File
Print, or press 
-P to summon the Print dialog box.
19.4.8 Filing Messages
Mail lets you create new mailboxes in the drawer. You might create one for important messages, another for all order 
confirmations from Web shopping, still another for friends and family, and so on. You can even create mailboxes inside 
these mailboxes, a feature beloved by the hopelessly organized.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (7 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
The commands you need are all in the Mailbox menu. For example, to create a new mailbox folder, choose 
Mailbox
New, or click the plus sign at the bottom of the drawer. Mail asks you to name the new mailbox. If you have 
more than one email account, it lets you specify which one will contain the new folder.
If you want to create a folder-inside-a-folder, use slashes in the name of your new mailbox. (If 
you use the name Cephalopods/Squid, for example, Mail will create a folder called 
Cephalopods, with a subfolder called Squid.)
You can also drag the mailbox icons up and down in the drawer to place one inside another.
When you click OK, a new icon appears in the mailbox drawer, ready for use.
You can move a message (or group of messages) into a mailbox in any of three ways:
G     Drag it out of the main list onto the mailbox icon (Figure 19-9).
G     Highlight one or more messages in the list pane and then choose from the Message
 Move To submenu, which 
lists all your mailboxes.
G     Control-click a message (or one of several that you've highlighted). From the resulting contextual menu, choose 
Move To, and then choose the mailbox you want from the submenu.
You can use any part of a message's "row" in the list as a handle; the little envelope cursor tells 
you that Mail knows what's happening. You can also drag messages en masse onto a folder. If 
you Optiondrag a message into a folder, you make a copy, leaving the original message where 
it is.
 
19.4.9 Flagging Messages
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (8 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
Sometimes you'll receive email that prompts you to some sort of action, but you may not have the time (or the fortitude) to 
face the task at the moment. ("Hi there...it's me, your accountant. Would you mind rounding up your expenses for 1993 
through 2003 and sending me a list by email?")
That's why Mail lets you flag a message, summoning a little flag icon in a new column next to a message's name. These 
indicators can mean anything you like—they simply call attention to certain messages. You can sort your mail list so that all 
your flagged messages are listed first (click the flag at the top of the column heading), for example.
To flag a message in this way, select the message (or several messages) and choose Message
Mark
As Flagged, 
or press Option-
-L, or Control-click the message's name in the list and choose Mark
As Flagged from the contextual 
menu. (To clear the flags, repeat the procedure, but use the Mark
As Unflagged command instead.)
19.4.10 Finding Messages
As noted earlier in this chapter, you can sort the columns in your main email list just by clicking the headings (From, 
Subject, Date & Time, and so on).
But when you deal with masses of email, you may find it easier to process your messages using any of Mail's three 
message-finding methods.
Top: Use the pop-up menu to specify how you want to filter your email list (message body, 
sender, recipient, or subject), and whether you want to search just the current mailbox or all 
mailboxes. Type the text you're looking for in the search box.
Bottom: As you type, Mail shrinks the list of email messages in real time, so that you're looking 
at only the ones matching what you typed. (In this case, messages with the word of in the 
subject line.) To return to seeing all of your messages, click the tiny X at the right side of the 
search box.

19.4 Reading Email
 
19.4.10.1 Finding messages within a mailbox
See the little text box in the upper-right corner of your main mail window? You can use it to hide all but certain messages, 
as shown in Figure 19-10.
You can also set up Mail to show you only certain messages that you've manually selected, 
hiding all others in the list. To do so, highlight the messages you want, just as though they're 
icons in a Finder list view. Then choose View
Display Selected Messages Only. (To see 
all of them again, choose View
 Display All Messages.)
19.4.10.2 Finding text within an open message
You can also search for certain text within a single message. Choose Edit
Find
 Find (or press 
-F) to bring up

19.4 Reading Email
the Find panel (Figure 19-11).
The Find panel works just as it might in a word processor, except that the Replace function 
works only on messages that you have written yourself—Mail doesn't let you change the words 
of mail you've received. (Lawyers would have a field day with that in court.)
 
19.4.11 Deleting Messages
Sometimes it's junk mail. Sometimes you're just done with it. Either way, it's a snap to delete a selected message, several 
selected messages, or a message that's currently before you on the screen. You can press the Delete key (with or without 
the 
 key), click the Delete button on the toolbar, choose Edit
Delete, or drag messages out of the list window and 
into your Trash mailbox—or even onto the Dock's Trash icon.
If you delete a message by accident, the Undo command (Edit
Undo or 
-Z) restores it.
All of these commands move the messages to the Trash folder. If you like, you can click its icon to view a list of the 
messages you've deleted. You can even rescue messages by dragging them into any other mailbox (right back into the In 
box, if you want).
19.4.11.1 Emptying the Trash folder
Mail doesn't vaporize messages in the Trash folder until you "empty the trash," just as in the Finder. You can empty it in any 
of several ways:
G     Click a message, or a folder, within the Trash folder list and then click the Delete icon on the toolbar (or press the 
Delete key). Now it's really gone.
G     Choose Mailbox
Erase Deleted Message (
-K). (If you have multiple accounts, choose Erase Deleted 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (11 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

Messages
In All Accounts.)
G     Control-click the Trash mailbox icon and choose Erase Deleted Messages from the contextual menu. (Mail now 
sports an Action pop-up icon, too, just like in the Finder toolbar. It's at the bottom of the mailboxes drawer. You can 
also choose Erase Deleted Messages from this pop-up menu, for example.)
G     Wait. Mail will permanently delete these messages automatically after a week.
If a week is too long (or not long enough), you can change this interval. Choose Mail
Preferences, click 
Accounts, and select the account name from the list at left. Then click Special Mailboxes, and change the "Erase 
deleted messages when" pop-up menu. (If you choose Quitting Mail from the pop-up menu, Mail will take out the 
trash every time you quit the program.)
19.4.11.2 Method 2: Deleted mail turns invisible
Mail offers a second—and very unusual—method of deleting messages that doesn't involve the Trash folder at all. Using 
this method, pressing the Delete key (or clicking the Delete toolbar button) simply hides the selected message in the list. 
Hidden messages remain hidden, but don't go away for good until you use the Rebuild Mailbox command described in the 
box on the facing page.
If this arrangement sounds useful, choose Mail
Preferences, click Accounts, select the account from the list on the left, 
click Special Mailboxes, and turn off the checkbox called "Move deleted messages to a separate folder" or "Move deleted 
messages to the Trash mailbox" (depending on what kind of account you have). From now on, messages you delete simply 
vanish from the list.
They're not really gone, however. You can bring them back, at least in ghostly form, by choosing View
Show Deleted 
Messages (or pressing 
-L). Figure 19-12 shows the idea.
Using this system, in other words, you never truly delete messages; you just hide them.
The grayish type indicates deleted messages. (It may be difficult, in this grayscale illustration, 
to see the difference between brown junk mail and gray deleted mail, but you'll see it on your 
screen.) You can bring any of these messages back from the world of the dead by reversing the 
preference in Mail
Preferences. The gray type turns to black, and the message is brought 
back to life once again.

19.4 Reading Email
 
At first, you might be concerned about the disk space and database size involved in keeping your old messages around 
forever like this. The truth is, however, that Mac OS X is perfectly capable of maintaining many thousands of messages in 
its mailbox databases. Meanwhile, there's a huge benefit to this arrangement: Almost everyone, sooner or later, wishes they 
could resurrect one deleted message or another—maybe months later, maybe years later. Using the hidden-deleted-
message system, your old messages are always around for reference.
When you do want to purge these messages for good, you can always return to the Special Mailboxes dialog box and turn 
the "Move deleted mail to a separate folder" checkbox back on.
19.4.12 Using Message Rules
Once you know how to create folders, the next step in managing your email is to set up a series of message rules (filters) 
that file, answer, or delete incoming messages automatically based on their contents (such as their subject, address, and/or 
size). Message rules require you to think like the distant relative of a programmer, but the mental effort can reward you 
many times over; message rules turn Mail into a surprisingly smart and efficient secretary.
19.4.12.1 Setting up message rules
Here's how to set one up:
1.  Choose Mail
Preferences. In the Preferences dialog box, click the Rules icon. 
The Rules dialog box appears, as shown at top in Figure 19-13.
2.  Click Add Rule. 
Now the dialog box shown at bottom in Figure 19-13 appears.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Secrets of the Mbox Files
As noted earlier in this chapter, Mail keeps your messages in a series of mailbox database files in your 
Home
Library
 Mail
Mailboxes folder, inside folders named for your accounts. (The files 
within—Outbox, Sent Messages, and so on—are packages, as described in Section 4.2. To see the 
actual .mbox files inside of one, Control-click its icon and choose Show Package Contents.)
Knowing this permits you to perform a number of interesting tricks. First of all, now you know what files 
to back up for safekeeping.
Second, you now have yourself a beautiful monthly archiving system. Each month, create a new 
mailbox folder in Mail, named for that month (like "June2004.mbox"). Drag into it all the mail you want 
to archive, and then back up just that mailbox file from your hard drive—instant archiving system! (If 
you ever want to work with these messages again, just drag that .mbox file back into your 
Home
Library
Mail folder before opening Mail.)
Third, now you know which files to copy to your laptop to maintain email continuity when you travel
3.  Use the Criteria options to specify how Mail should select messages to process. 
For example, if you'd like the program to watch out for messages from a particular person, you would set up the 
first two pop-up menus to say "From" and "Contains," respectively.
To flag messages containing loan, $$$$, XXXX, !!!!, and so on, set the pop-up menus to say "Subject" and 
"Contains."
In fact, you can set up multiple criteria here, so that you flag messages whose subjects contain any one of those 
common spam triggers. (If you change the "any" pop-up menu to say "all," then all of the criteria must be true for 
the rule to kick in.)
Top: Mail rules can screen out junk mail, serve as an email answering machine, or call 
important messages to your attention. All mail message rules you've created appear in 
this list. (The color shading for each rule is a reflection of the colorizing options you set 
up, if any.)
Bottom: Double-click a rule to open the Edit Rule dialog box, where you can specify what 
the rule does.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (14 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
 
4.  Specify which words or people you want the message rule to watch for. 
In the text box to the right of the two pop-up menus, type the word, address, name, or phrase you want Mail to 
watch for—a person's name, or $$$$, in the previous examples.
5.  In the lower half of the box, specify what you want to happen to messages that match the criteria. 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-4.html (15 of 16)5/3/2004 5:06:16 AM

19.4 Reading Email
If, in Steps 1 and 2, you've told your rule to watch for junk mail containing $$$$ in the Subject line, here's where 
you can tell Mail to delete it or move it into, say, a Junk folder.
With a little imagination, you'll see how the options in this pop-up menu can do absolutely amazing things with your 
incoming email. Mail can colorize, delete, move, redirect, or forward messages—or even play a sound when you 
get a certain message. (Consider, for example, what happens when you go on a trip. By setting up the controls as 
shown in Figure 19-13, you have specified that messages your boss, Chris Herbert, sends to your .Mac account 
are to be redirected to your vacation email address, feelio@yahoo.com. The rest of the mail will just have to wait 
until you're home again.)
6.  In the very top box, name your mail rule. Click OK. 
Now you're back to the Rules pane (Figure 19-13, top). Here you can choose a sequence for the rules you've 
created by dragging them up and down. Here, too, you can turn off the ones you won't be needing at the moment, 
but may use again one day.
Mail applies rules as they appear, from top to bottom, in the list. If a rule doesn't seem to be 
working properly, it may be that an earlier rule is intercepting and processing the message 
before the "broken" rule even sees it. To fix this, try dragging the rule up or down in the list.

19.5 The Anti-Spam Toolkit
Many of the improvements Apple made in the 10.3 version of its Mail program are tiny tweaks. For example, the mailbox 
drawer has an Action menu like the Finder's; Mail is faster at checking for new messages; and you can start an instant-
messaging conversation with the person who sent you an email by choosing Message
Reply with iChat.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
The Email Answering Machine
If you're going on vacation, you can turn Mail into an email answering machine that sends a canned "I'm away 
until the 15th" message to everyone who writes you.
To do so, set the first set of pop-up menus in the Rules dialog box so that they say Account and the name of 
your account. In the bottom half of the dialog box, select Reply to Message from the pop-up menu. Click 
"Reply message text" and type your boilerplate reply in the resulting box.
Important: If you subscribe to mailing lists, set up another mail rule that intercepts and files them before your 
answering- machine rule kicks in. Otherwise, you'll incur the wrath of the other Internet citizens by littering 
their email discussion groups with copies of your auto-reply message.
19.5.1 Using the Junk Mail Filter
One of Panther's most exciting enhancements isn't new at all, but rather an upgrade —to Mail's Junk Mail Filter. You'll see 
its effects the first time you check your mail: A certain swath of message titles appears in color. These are the messages 
that Mail considers junk.
NOTE
Out of the box, Mail doesn't apply its spam-targeting features to people whose addresses are in your 
address book, to people you've emailed recently, or to messages sent to you by name rather than just by 
email address. You can adjust these parameters in Mail
Preferences
Junk Mail tab.
This is a very good thing; today, over 50 percent of all email is spam, and the problem will only get worse. At the moment, 
technological tools are the most promising weapon you have to fight back.
During your first couple of weeks with Mail, your job is to supervise Mail's coloring job. That is, if you get spam that Mail 
misses, click the message and then click the Junk button at the top of its window (identified in Figure 19-3), or the Junk icon 
on the toolbar. On the other hand, if Mail flags legitimate mail as spam, slap it gently on the wrist by clicking the Not Junk 
button. Over time, Mail gets better and better at filtering your mail.
The only trouble with this so-called Training mode is that you're still left with the task of trashing the spam yourself. Once 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-5.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 5:06:18 AM

19.5 The Anti-Spam Toolkit
Mail has perfected its filtering skills to your satisfaction, however, open Mail's preferences, click Junk Mail, and click "Move 
it to the Junk mailbox." From now on, Mail automatically files what it deems junk into a Junk Mail box, where it's much 
easier to scan and delete the messages en masse.
In the Rules dialog box shown in Figure 19-13, you can see that Apple performs its magic 
using a Junk rule . By editing it, you can make the sieve more or less restrictive. For 
example, you could click the plus sign next to one of the conditions, and then choose 
Account from the new pop-up menu, so that the junk mail filter applies only to one of your 
email accounts.
Also, don't miss the "Trust Junk Mail headers set by your Internet Service Provider" option in 
the Junk Mail pane of the preference window. If you turn on that checkbox, Mail will take your 
ISP's word for it that certain messages are spam, giving you a double layer of spam 
protection.
19.5.2 More Anti-Spam Options
The Junk filter goes a long way toward cleaning out the spam from your mail collection. But it doesn't catch everything. If 
you're overrun by spam, here are some other steps you can take:
G     Don't let the spammers know you're there.. If you choose Mail
Preferences, click Viewing, and turn off 
"Display images and embedded objects in HTML messages," Mail saves you time, because graphics are big and 
slow to download. It also shields you from unexpected free samples of pornographers' wares.
But it also thwarts a common spammer tactic by blocking graphics that appear to be embedded in a message, but 
actually get retrieved from a Web site somewhere, letting the spammers know that their message has fallen on 
fertile ground—a live sucker who actually looks at these messages.
G     Rules. Set up some message rules, as described in Section 19.4.12, that auto-flag messages as spam that have 
subject lines containing trigger words like "Viagra," "Herbal," "Mortgage," "Refinance," "Enlarge Your..." and so on.
G     Create a private account. If you're overrun by spam, consider sacrificing your address to the public areas of the 
Internet, like chat rooms, online shopping, Web site and software registration, and newsgroup posting. Spammers 
use automated software robots that scour every public Internet message and Web page, recording email 
addresses they find. That's how they got your address in the first place. Using this technique, at least you're now 
restricting the junk mail to one, secondary mail account. (Reserve a separate email account for person-to-person 
email.)
Here are some suggestions, meanwhile, for avoiding landing on spammers' lists in the first place:
G     Don't ask for it. When filling out forms online, turn off the checkboxes that say, "Yes, send me exciting offers and 
news from our partners."
G     Fake out the robots. When posting messages in a newsgroup, insert the letters NOSPAM somewhere into your 
email address. Anyone replying to you via email must delete the NOSPAM from your email address, which is a 
slight hassle. Meanwhile, however, the spammers' software robots will lift a bogus email address from your 
newsgroup posts.
G     Never reply to spam. Doing so identifies your email address as an active one, and can lead to even more 
unwanted mail. Along the same lines, never click the "Please remove me from your list" link at the bottom of an 
email unless you know who sent the message.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Rebuilding Your Mail Databases
As noted earlier in this chapter, Mail keeps your messages in a series of mailbox database files in your 
Home
Library
 Mail
Mailboxes folder.
Over time, you add and delete hundreds of messages from these database files. Inevitably, some 
digital sawdust gets left behind, resulting in peculiarities when addressing messages or general Mail 
sluggishness. You also wind up with massive message files hidden on your hard drive, which can 
consume hundreds of megabytes of disk space. That's a particular bummer if you like to copy your 
message databases to your laptop when you go on a trip.
Fortunately, it's easy enough to rebuild the message databases. Doing so cleanses, repairs, and 
purges your message files. As a result, you wind up with a much more compact and healthy database.
To rebuild an email database, highlight it in the mailboxes "drawer" in Mail. (Highlight several, if you 
like.) Then choose Mailbox
Rebuild. Mac OS X takes several minutes (or hours, depending on the 
sizes of your mailboxes) to repair and compact your database.
And for goodness' sake, don't order anything sold by the spammers. If only one person in 500,000 does so, the 
spammer makes money.

19.6 Address Book
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
19.6 Address Book
Address Book is Mac OS X's little-black-book program—an electronic Rolodex where you can stash the names, job titles, 
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and Internet chat screen names of all the people in your life (Figure 19-14). 
Of course, Address Book can hold other contact information too, such as birthdays and anniversaries, as well as any other 
scraps and tidbits of personal data you'd like to keep at your fingertips.
The big question: Why isn't this program named iContact? With its three-paned view, soft 
rounded buttons and brushed-aluminum style windows, it certainly looks like a close cousin of 
iPhoto and iTunes.
 
Once you make Address Book the central repository of all your personal contact information, you can call up this 
information in a number of convenient ways:
G     You can launch Address Book and search for a contact by typing just a few letters in the Search box.
G     When you're composing messages in Mac OS X's Mail program, Address Book automatically fills in email 
addresses for you when you type the first few letters.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (1 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
If you choose Window
Address Panel from within Mail, you can browse all of 
your addresses without even launching the Address Book program. Once you've 
selected the people you want to contact, just click the "To" button to address an email 
to them.
G     When you use iChat to exchange instant messages with people in your Address Book, the pictures you've stored of 
them automatically appear in chat windows.
G     Address Book can send its information to an iPod, giving you a little white "little black book" that fits in your shirt 
pocket, can be operated one-handed, and comes with built-in musical accompaniment. (The easiest way is to use 
iSync, described at the end of Chapter 18.)
G     If you have a Bluetooth cellphone, Address Book can exchange information with your phone and even dial it for 
you. Incoming calls to your phone wirelessly trigger Address Book to display the number or name of the caller. 
Using the same wireless connection, you can also exchange contact info between Address Book and Palm-
compatible handhelds.
You can find Address Book in your Applications folder or (on a fresh installation of OS X) in the Dock.
19.6.1 Creating Address Cards
Each entry in Address Book is called a card —an electronic version of a paper Rolodex card, with predefined spaces to 
hold all the standard contact information.
To add a new person to your collection, choose File
New Card, press 
-N, or click the + button beneath the Name 
column. Then type in the contact information, pressing the Tab key to move from field to field (that is, text box to text box), 
as shown in Figure 19-15.
If one of your contacts happens to have three office phone extensions, a pager number, two 
home phone lines, a cellphone and a couple of fax machines, no problem—you can add as 
many fields as you need. Click the little green + buttons when editing a card to add more 
phone, email, chat name, and address fields. (The buttons appear only when existing fields are 
filled.) Click a field's name to change its label; you can select one of the standard labels from 
the pop-up menu (Home, Work, and so on) or make up your own labels by choosing Custom, as 
seen in the lower portion of this figure.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (2 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
 
If you find yourself constantly adding the same fields to new cards, check out the Template 
pane of Address Book's Preferences (Address Book
Preferences). There, you can 
customize exactly which fields appear for new cards.
Each card also contains a freeform Notes field at the bottom, where you can type any other random crumbs of information 
you'd like to store about the person (spouse's name, embarrassing nicknames, favorite Chinese restaurant, and so on).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (3 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
19.6.1.1 Editing an address
When you create a new address card, you're automatically in Edit mode, which means you can add and remove fields and 
change the information on the card. To switch into Browse Mode (where you can view and copy contact information but not 
change it), click the Edit button or choose Edit
Edit Card (
-L). You can also switch out of Browse Mode in the same 
ways.
Regardless of what mode you're in—Edit or Browse—you can always type, drag, or paste 
text into the Notes field of an address card.
This example shows three other kinds of fields that you can plug into your address cards. The 
phonetic first/last name fields (shown at top) let you store phonetic spellings of hardto- 
pronounce names. The other two fields store birthdays and screen names for instant 
messaging networks (like Jabber and Yahoo). To add fields like these, choose from the 
Card
Add Field menu.
 
19.6.1.2 Adding addresses from Mail
You can also make new contacts in the Address Book directly from the Mail program, saving you the trouble of having to 
manually type names and email addresses. Select an email message in Mail, then choose Message
Add Sender to 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (4 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
Address Book (or press 
-Y). Presto: Mac OS X automatically adds a new card to the Address Book, with the name and 
email address fields already filled in. (Later, you can edit the card in Address Book to add phone numbers, street 
addresses, and so on.)
19.6.2 Importing Addresses
The easiest way to add people to Address Book is to import them from another program from a program like Entourage, 
Outlook Express, or Palm Desktop.
Address Book isn't smart enough to read an Entourage or Outlook Express database, though—it can only import files in 
vCard format, or the less common LDIF format. But Mac OS X 10.3 comes with a handy AppleScript that lets you import 
addresses from six of the most popular contact manager programs: Entourage, Outlook Express, Palm Desktop, Eudora, 
Claris Emailer, and Netscape. Just choose Import Addresses from the new Script menu at the top of the screen, and follow 
the prompts. A minute or two later, you'll have all your old contacts safely transferred into Address Book.
19.6.2.1 About vCards
Address Book can exchange contact information with other programs primarily through vCards. vCard is short for virtual 
business card. More and more email programs send and receive these electronic business cards, which you can easily spot 
by the .vcf extension on their names.
If you ever receive an email to which a vCard file is attached, drag the .vcf file into your Address Book window to create an 
instant entry with a complete set of information. You can create vCards of your own, too: just drag a name out of your 
Address Book and onto the desktop (or into a piece of outgoing mail).
In addition to letting you create vCards of individual entries, Address Book makes it easy to 
create vCards that contain several entries. To do so, just 
-click the entries in the Name 
column that you want included, and drag them to the desktop. There, they'll appear all 
together-as a single vCard. You can even drag an item from the Group column to the 
desktop to make a vCard that contains all the group's entries.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
The Windows-to-Address Book Journey
Getting names and addresses out of one Mac program and into another is one thing, but what if your contacts 
are stored on a Windows PC running Microsoft Outlook—the most-used contact manager in the world?
Fortunately, there is a way to grab all those phone numbers and email addresses and slide them into Address 
Book without having to manually re-enter any of it—but the journey isn't exactly a one-click operation. Outlook 
for Windows, it turns out, can't export contacts as .vcf files (the format that Address Book requires for import) 
as a group—only one by one. And who's got the time for that?
The easiest way is to email yourself all your contacts. (For reasons known only to a handful of Microsoft 
engineers, Outlook can't export contacts as vCards, but it can email them as vCard attachments.) Select all 
your contacts in Outlook, and then choose Action
Forward as vCard. You'll end up with an email 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (5 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
containing lots of little .vcf attachments.
Send this email to yourself, then open the message and drag the attached .vcf files straight into Address 
Book. (If you have more than a couple hundred contacts, you might want to do them in a few batches.)
There's one other option, but it requires that you have either Outlook Express or Entourage on your Mac. Use 
Outlook's Export command to create a tab-delimited text file containing all your contacts, then copy the text 
file to your Mac. Address Book can't do anything with this text file, but Outlook Express and Entourage can.
Choose File
Import in either program to get the process going. You'll have to step through an ugly Import 
dialog box to map the Outlook fields to the Mac program, but you should be able to successfully get all your 
contacts transferred intact. The final step is to use Address Book's Import Addresses script, as described 
above, to move the addresses from Outlook Express or Entourage into Address Book.
19.6.3 Adding Pictures
You can dress up each Address Book entry not only with textual information, but also with a photo. Whenever you're editing 
somebody's address book card, just drag a digital photo—preferably 64 pixels square, or a multiple of it—into the "picture 
well" just to the left of the person's name, as shown in Figure 19-15. Or double-click the picture well and browse to a picture 
by clicking Choose. (No matter how you select a picture, though, Address Book shows you the standard Images dialog box-
see Figure 11-1 for a full explanation.)
You don't necessarily have to use a photo, of course. You could add any graphic that you want to represent someone, even 
if it's a Bart Simpson face or skull and crossbones. You can use any standard image file in an address card—a JPEG, GIF, 
TIFF, or even a PDF.
From now on, if you receive an email from that person, the photo shows up right in the email message.
If you've got your snapshots organized with iPhoto, it's particularly easy to add a picture to 
any address card. Drag directly from the main iPhoto window to the picture frame on the 
address card to insert it.
19.6.3.1 Replacing and removing a picture
To replace a photo that you've attached to an address card, just drag a new image on top of the old one. If you want to get 
rid of an existing picture without replacing it, select the card, then choose Card
Clear Custom Image (or press Delete).
19.6.4 Groups
A group is a collection of related address cards, saved under a single descriptive name. Organizing your contact entries into 
groups can make them much easier to find and use—especially when your database of addresses climbs into the 
hundreds. For example, if you regularly send out a family newsletter to 35 relatives, you might gather the address cards of 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (6 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
all your assorted siblings, cousins, nieces, nephews, uncles, and aunts into a single group called Family. When addressing 
an outgoing message using Mail, you can type this group name in one quick swoop. As a bonus, a person can be a 
member of as many different groups as you want.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Cool Group Tricks
Dragging cards into and out of groups can be a great way to spend an afternoon, but groups can actually be 
powerful time-savers. For example, if a card is selected in the Name column, you can quickly identify all the 
groups it belongs to by simply pressing the Option key.
Also, if you've created a lot of groups, it can be very difficult to find a specific one-especially because Address 
Book's Search box looks only for individual cards. To get around this limitation, click in the Group list and then 
type the first few letters of a group's name. Address Book jumps right to the first matching group.
You can even add groups to other groups. You might find it useful to keep a Nieces group and a Nephews 
group, for example, but to keep both groups inside a master Family group. To do this, you'd 
-click Nieces 
and Nephews in the Group list, and then Option-drag them onto the Family group. Now, whenever you select 
Family, you'll see both groups listed among the rest of the cards; double-click either group to see its members.
To create a group, click the + button at the bottom of the Group column in the Address Book window, or choose 
File
New Group (or press Shift-
-N.) Type a name for the newly spawned group icon in the Group column, and then 
populate it with address cards by dragging entries from the Names list into the group. If you're familiar with iTunes or 
iPhoto, you'll feel right at home doing this; It's just like adding photos to an album, or songs to a playlist. Clicking on a group 
name automatically locates and displays (in the Names column) all the names that are a part of that group—and hides any 
that aren't.
To turn a set of address cards into a group very quickly, select multiple entries from the 
Names column —by either Shift-clicking the names (to make contiguous selections) or 
-
clicking (for non-contiguous selections)—and then choose File
New Group From 
Selection. You end up with a new group containing all the selected names.
19.6.4.1 Removing someone from a group
To take someone out of a group, first click the group name, and then click the person's name in the Name column and 
press the Delete key. If you want to remove the person from Address Book itself, click Delete in the resulting dialog box. 
Otherwise, just click "Remove from Group"; Address Book will keep the card, but remove it from the currently selected 
group.
NOTE
If you selected "All" in the Group column, rather than a specific group, OS X doesn't even give you the 
"Remove from Group" option in the dialog box that appears when you press Delete. Instead, it just lets you 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (7 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
confirm whether you do, in fact, want to permanently remove the card.
19.6.5 Finding an Address
You can search for an Address Book entry inside the currently selected group just by typing a few letters of a name (or 
address, or any other snippet of contact information) in the capsule-shaped Search box (see Figure 19-17). To search all 
your contacts instead of just the current group, first click All in the Group list.
You can press 
-F to jump directly to the search field and start typing. Your savings: one 
mouse click.
If Address Book finds more than one matching card, use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through them. (You can 
also press Return to move forward through the matching entries or Shift-Return to move backward.)
Once you've found the card you're looking for, you can perform some interesting stunts. If you click the label of a phone 
number ("home" or "office", for example), you see the Large Type option: Address Book displays the number in an absurdly 
gigantic font that fills the entire width of your screen, making it all but impossible to misread the number as you dial the 
phone from across the room. You can also click the label of an email address to create a pre-addressed email message, or 
click a home page to launch your Web browser and go to somebody's site. Clicking an address label even gives you the 
option of getting a map of the address via your Web browser (Figure 19-18).
As you type, Address Book filters your social circle and displays the number of matching 
address cards at the very bottom of the window. (Ordinarily, Address Book displays the 
number of cards in the currently selected group there.) The records themselves appear in the 
Name column; the first of the matching card entries appears in the far-right pane.

19.6 Address Book
 
You can also copy and paste (or drag) address card info into another program or convert it into a Sticky Note.
The options that become available when you click the field labels on an address card vary 
according to field type. Pop-up menus let you send email, open Web pages, or view a map, 
depending on the field you've clicked.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (9 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
 
19.6.6 Changing the Address Book Display
You can't do much to customize Address Book's appearance, but the Preferences panel (Address Book
Preferences) 
gives you at least a couple of options in the General pane that are worth checking out:
G     Display Order. Choose to have names displayed with the first name followed by the last name, or vice versa.
G     Sort By. Sort the entries in Address Book by either first or last name.
G     Font Size. Choose from Regular, Large or Extra Large. Unfortunately, you can't change anything else about the 
font used in the Address Book; the color, face and style are all locked down.
19.6.7 Printing Options
When you choose File
Print, you're presented with a somewhat awkward window that combines the capabilities of 
traditional Print and Page Setup dialog boxes. From here, you can choose from two different printing approaches in the 
Style pop-up menu: Mailing Labels or Lists.
G     Mailing Labels. One of the most useful new features in Panther's Address Book is its ability to print addresses on 
standard sheets of sticky mailing labels—Avery, for example—that you buy at office-supply stores. From the Page 
pop-up menu, indicate which kind of label paper you're using; type the identification number from the paper's 
package in the blank on the right. In the Label tab, customize the color, font style, and image to be used for each 
card, and then click Print.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-19-SECT-6.html (10 of 13)5/3/2004 5:06:23 AM

19.6 Address Book
As you manipulate settings, you can see your changes in the preview pane on the 
right. If the preview is too small for you to see, use the Zoom slider (it doesn't affect 
your printout).
If you want to access the traditional Print dialog box (to fine-tune how much ink your 
printer uses, for example), click Advanced Options. Then, once you're ready to return 
to Address Book's special dialog box, click Standard Options.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Automatic Notifications
In earlier versions of OS X, notifying friends and family that your email address had changed was one 
of life's most dreaded tasks. Fortunately, in Panther's Address Book, this process has been simplified 
to a single step.
All you have to do is visit the General pane of Address Book's Preferences and turn on "Notify people 
when my card changes." From now on, whenever you change the information in your own address 
card (including your home address, email address, or phone number), Address Book will ask you 
whether you want to send a notification email-almost like a virtual change-of-address card.
In the resulting dialog box, choose which groups of people you want to notify, and then personalize 
the outgoing message. When you click Send, Address Book delivers an email to all the people in the 
groups you chose, attaching your new vCard (Section 19.6.2.1). When your recipients get the email, 
they can simply drag the vCard into their own Address Books to update their information about you.
(And if you ever want to manually send updates to your contacts, just choose File
Send Updates.)
G     Lists. If all you want is a paper backup of your Address Book entries, this is the setting you should choose. In the 
Attributes list, turn on the checkboxes of the fields you want printed. Specify a type size in the Font Size pop-up 
menu, and click Print.
No matter which mode you choose, the only cards that will be printed are the ones that were selected when you chose 
File
Print. If you want to print all your cards, therefore, make sure to select "All" in the Group column before you print.
19.6.8 Addresses
When you think about it, the contents of your Address Book may represent years of typing and compiling effort. Losing all 
that information to a corrupted database—or a hard drive crash—could be devastating. Here are two ways to protect your 
Address Book data:
G     Use the Backup command. Periodically choose File

version to rescue the data by choosing File
Revert to Database Backup.
G     Make a backup copy of your entire Address Book database. Open your Home
 Library
Application 
Support folder. Copy the entire AddressBook folder to another disk—burn it to a CD, download it to your iPod, or 
upload it to a file server, for example. Now your contact data is safe even in the event of a hard drive crash.
19.6.9 Address Book and Bluetooth
Address Book can do far more than just store, retrieve, and display phone numbers. It can actually dial them using your 
cellphone, thanks to the Bluetooth wireless technology.
19.6.9.1 Getting Bluetooth-enabled
To make Address Book talk to the outside world in this way, you have to pair it with a Bluetooth-enabled cellphone. (And 
your Mac, of course, must have a Bluetooth adapter, like the one that comes preinstalled on new PowerBooks.) Once 
you've turned on all the hardware, your cellphone and Mac have to "find" each other on the wireless network—a task 
managed by the Bluetooth pane of System Preferences.
Once your computer and phone have mated for life, open Address Book. You'll see a Bluetooth logo in the Address Book 
window, letting you know that your phone and computer "see" each other and that you can now make calls and send 
cellphone messages from your computer.
19.6.9.2 Dialing with Address Book
To make a phone call, click any phone-number field label on an address card and choose Dial from the pop-up menu. Then 
pick up your cellphone and wait for the person you're calling to answer.
You can also use Address Book to send SMS text messages directly to other cellphones. (SMS stands for "short message 
service," and refers to the feature of cellphones that lets you send and receive short text messages.) To send an SMS 
message, click a phone number field label on an address card and choose Send SMS Message from the popup menu. 
Type your message and send it off. (Of course, this works only if the phone you're calling is capable of receiving SMS 
messages.)
19.6.9.3 Receiving calls
Once your cellphone and Mac have met, Address Book can notify you of incoming calls, too. It's Caller ID on the Mac!
When a call comes in, a window opens (assuming Address Book is open), showing the caller's number in jumbo type. If it's 
somebody in your Address Book, you even see the caller's name.
Click Answer and then pick up your cellphone to begin your conversation. If you click Send to Voicemail instead, your 
phone stops ringing and you dump the caller into your cell service's answering machine, just as though you'd pressed the 
Voicemail button on the phone.
Sometimes, you may prefer to send the caller to voice mail and create a new SMS message to reply. In that case, click 
Send SMS Reply. This way, you shut up the ringing phone while your family is sleeping, but still manage to type out a reply 
(like "It's 3:35 AM, for God's sake! What are you doing!?").

Chapter 20. Panther's Internet Software Suite
Apple is unabashedly intrigued by the possibilities of the Internet. With each new release of Mac OS X, more clever tendrils 
reach out from the Mac to the world's biggest network. There's the Safari Web browser, of course, but also Sherlock, iCal 
(Mac OS X's calendar program), iSync (which keeps your address book, calendar, and to-do list synchronized with your 
cellphone, iPod, PalmPilot, and other Macs), and iChat AV (an America Online-compatible instant-messenger/voice chat/
videoconferencing program, which non-Panther peons must buy for themselves at $30).
This chapter tackles each item in this motley crew.

20.1 Sherlock
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
20.1 Sherlock
Sherlock is like a Web browser that's specifically fine-tuned to bring you certain popular kinds of up-to-date Web info, 
without the waiting, without the navigation hassle, and without the ads.
The Sherlock channels (indicated by icons on its toolbar) bring Web information directly to your Sherlock window, formatted 
for maximum impact: graphs when you search for stock prices, QuickTime previews when you search for movies, maps 
when you search for flights, and so on.
Here's how the channels work.
20.1.1 Internet
The Internet channel simply means, "search the Web." You type what you're looking for into the "Topic or Description" box, 
and then press Enter (or click the green magnifying-glass button). After a moment, you see a tidy list of Web sites that 
match what you looked for, sorted by relevance, at the outset.
By double-clicking one of the matches, you fire up your Web browser to visit that site.
Here's what you can do with one of these results:
G     Read the first paragraph. Click one of the Web pages listed in the search results. At the bottom of the window, 
Sherlock displays the first paragraph or so of text that appears on that Web page.
G     Go to the Web page. Double-click one of the listings to launch your Web browser and visit the corresponding page.
G     Create an Internet location file. If you think you might like to visit one of these Web sites later, drag it out of the 
list and onto your Dock or desktop, where it becomes an Internet location file (see Section 18.10). You can also 
drag it directly into the toolbar or favorites lists of Internet Explorer Favorites or Safari, where it becomes a 
bookmark for that browser.
Of course, in the age of Safari and its built-in Google search bar, this aspect of Sherlock might not seem so impressive. 
Still, Sherlock offers one key benefit—or at least one key difference: It can search at least six search engines 
simultaneously (listed at the bottom of the window).
20.1.2 Pictures
Need a photo of something? Type whatever you're looking for into this channel's "Picture Topic or Description" box—Santa 
Claus, October squash, Keanu Reeves—and then press Enter. In a flash, you see thumbnails of photographs from Web 
pages all over the Internet that match your search (see Figure 20-1). Double-click one to view it on the actual Web page in 
your browser, so that you can download it—and pay for it.
If you are a busy graphic designer with the money to pay for professionally captured, 
professional- resolution digital images, this channel can be very useful. It's like having the 
searchable catalogs of several stock-art companies at your fingertips.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
 
Note, by the way, that you only get to see a few pictures at a time. Watch the phrase next to the green magnifying-glass 
icon; if it says "Click again for more pictures," you're not yet seeing all of them. Keep clicking until it says "No pictures 
found." Now you're seeing everything Sherlock found.
For noncommercial use, the Image Search tab of Google.com is far more powerful. It finds 
far more pictures on the topic you're seeking, because it grabs them from thousands of 
everyday Web pages, rather than limiting its search to commercial stock-photo companies. 
(Yes, you should ask for permission from these Web sites before using pictures of theirs for 
some other purpose.)
20.1.3 Stocks
This one is amazing. Type the name or stock symbol of a company into the box, and then press Enter. (If Sherlock isn't 
sure which company you meant, you'll see a list of matching companies so that you can click the right one.)
In a moment, you're shown not only the current stock price and accompanying statistics, but also headlines relating to the 
company and a graph of its stock performance.
Here's some of the fun you can have with this module:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (2 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
G     Double-click the row of stock information to go to the company's Lycos financial- information page in your Web 
browser. Much more statistical detail appears here.
G     Click one of the headlines to view the full article in the area at the bottom of the window. You can select this text 
and copy it.
G     From the Chart pop-up menu, choose Week, Year, or Intraday (meaning "just today so far") to change the graph.
G     Each time you add a stock name, your list of stocks grows. To remove one, just click its row and then press the 
Delete key.
G     You can manipulate the columns of stock information just as you do in the Finder: click a heading to sort the list of 
stocks by that criterion (Symbol, Last Trade, or whatever). And you can drag these headings horizontally to 
rearrange them.
To preserve a stock graph, drag it to your desktop, where it becomes a picture clipping that 
you can file away for future use.
20.1.4 Movies
For the movie fan, this single Sherlock feature might be worth the entire price of Mac OS X. It makes finding a movie or 
theater in your neighborhood so easy and efficient that Moviefone.com looks positively antique by comparison. As you can 
see in Figure 20-2, it's an instantaneously updated database of movies and show times for your neighborhood.
Check out the two buttons in the lower-left. The Address Book button puts the address of the 
selected theater into your Address Book, and the button next to it shows you all the 
information about the theater (location, phone number, driving directions, and so on).
Type your city and state—or just your zip code—into the text box at the top, and then press 
Enter. After a moment, you'll see a list of movies playing near you—in the first column. Click 
one to see the theaters where it's playing (in the second column); click one of those to see 
today's show times (in the last column). Meanwhile, you even see the address of the theater, 
the movie poster, the movie's rating and length, a description, and—if you wait long enough—
even the QuickTime trailer for the movie, if any. Life is sweet.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
 
The only thing stopping this module from becoming an international smash hit is that...well, it doesn't work internationally. At 
the moment, it knows only about movie theaters in the United States.
20.1.5 Phone Book
A Yellow Pages of every business and organization in the entire United States wouldn't be especially convenient. In fact, it 
would probably occupy your entire living room. And yet think of the convenience of having such a thing. You could instantly 
find the closest Chinese restaurant, hospital, or all-night drugstore, even if you're a laptopcarrying road warrior in a strange 
city.
Well, now you can. Into the Business Name or Category box, type whatever it is you're looking for, exactly as though it's a 
heading in the Yellow Pages business directory. You could type drug store, cleaning service, health club, tailor, library, or 
whatever. (Alternatively, click the blue arrow next to this box to see a list of services Sherlock already knows about.)
Then, in the Find Near box, you can type:
G     A zip code.
G     A city and state name (like Cleveland, OH). Sherlock automatically fills out the rest of the name it thinks you're 
typing, based on its huge database of towns.
G     The name of someone in your Address Book program. As you type, Sherlock completes the name it thinks you're 
matching—and then, when you press Return or Enter, shows you local matching businesses based on that 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (4 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
person's Address Book address. (Enter your name to get directions from your house...get the idea?)
When you press Enter, Sherlock not only shows you a list of businesses and organizations that meet your criteria, but it 
also shows you the phone number, the address, and even a map.
Sherlock will find you a list of local drug stores, but it doesn't know anything about 
drugstores. The point is to try a couple of different search terms until you find some "hits."
You can also type a name, zip, or city into the Driving Directions From box to get turn-by-turn driving directions from that 
spot to the business whose name you've highlighted in the results list. If you choose File
Print, or click the Print button 
above the map, Sherlock does the right thing. It creates a beautifully formatted page that identifies the currently highlighted 
business, its address and phone number, driving directions, and the map, all ready to print and take with you. This, ladies 
and gentlemen, is progress.
20.1.6 eBay
This one is for you, auction freaks. Into the Item Title box, type whatever it is you're looking for—ceramic angel, Babe Ruth 
baseball card, PowerBook G4, or whatever. When you press Enter, Sherlock displays a list of all matching items from the 
eBay Web site currently on auction, complete with description, number of bids, remaining time for the auction, and more. 
Use the pop-up menus on this screen to further narrow the listing by specifying price ranges, categories, geographical 
regions, and so on.
Two different mechanisms let you sort the results, slicing and dicing them to feed your obsession. Using the pop-up menu 
to the right of the "priced between" boxes, you can specify that the items appear listed by price, by time remaining in the 
auction, and so on. Or you can click the column headings (Title, Price, Bids, or Ends).
If one of the items catches your eye, click its name and then click Track Listing (bottom right). From now on, you can view 
your list of especially interesting items by switching the Search/Track button to Track mode. (All other items are hidden until 
you click Search again.)
All of this is especially useful if you're a real eBay aficionado. You know, in that case, that most of these deals are made or 
broken in the final moments of the auction, as all the patient vultures jump in. Now, thanks to Sherlock, you can keep your 
eye on all of your auctions at once.
20.1.7 Flights
The Flights module is actually two modules in one.
G     Flight Finder. If you're planning a trip, Sherlock can show you a list of flights that match your itinerary. Just type 
the arrival and departure cities into the appropriate boxes—or use the pop-up menus provided—and then press 
Enter. This is precisely the tool to use when a friend or relative is flying in and you're unsure of the flight number or 
airline. (New in Panther: A Leg pop-up menu that lets you inspect individual legs of a multi-flight journey.)
G     Flight Tracker. If you already know a flight number, Sherlock can tell you whether or not it's going to be on time, 
which airport terminal to go to, and even where (on the map) the flight is at the moment. See Figure 20-3 for an 
example.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (5 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
If you know the airline and flight number, use the controls at the top of the window to specify 
them. You'll be shown the schedule, airport, date, flight time remaining, type of airplane, and so 
on. If you don't have a specific flight number, plug in the departure and arrival cities, using the 
resulting list to find your flight. If the flight is en route, you see a map of its progress, as shown 
here. (Hit the lower-right light switch to tell Sherlock the continent you live on, which affects 
which airlines and airports Sherlock suggests.)
 
20.1.8 Dictionary
Never again will your family gatherings devolve into heated arguments over Scrabble. Now you have a powerful, 
instantaneous, electronic dictionary built right into your operating system. Just type a word into the Word to Define box and 
then press Enter.
In seconds, you see what looks like a photocopy of the relevant page from the American Heritage Dictionary, complete with 
phonetic spelling, syllabication, every conceivable word-form variant of the word, and (at the lower half of the window) even 
synonyms, if there are any. For dedicated word nerds, this feature is indisputably convenient, handy, useful, suitable, 
expedient, clever, nimble, and slick.
20.1.9 Translation
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-1.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:28 AM

20.1 Sherlock
The next time you travel abroad, plan your trip so that your laptop always has highspeed wireless Internet access wherever 
you go (yeah, right). You'll be able to use this module to translate your utterances—or those of the natives—to and from 
about seventeen languages.
Just type the sentence or paragraph into the Original Text box, choose the language direction you want from the central 
pop-up menu, and then press Enter. In a flash, the bottom of the window shows the translation.
Of course, these translations are performed by automated software robots on the Web. As a result, they're not nearly as 
accurate as what you'd get from a paid professional. On the other hand, when you're standing in the middle of a strange city 
and you don't know the language—and you desperately need to express yourself—what Sherlock provides may just be 
good enough.
Your first instinct may be to assume that this module is designed for translating things you 
want to say into the local language. However, you may find it even more useful for translating 
foreign language paragraphs—from email or Web pages, for example—into your own 
language so that you can read them.
20.1.10 AppleCare
This module gives you a direct line to Apple's Knowledge Base, a huge collection of answers, troubleshooting tips, and 
feature explanations for every Mac model ever made. It's based on the same technical library consulted by Apple's tech-
support representatives, by the way, so you may as well check it before you call the Apple help line.
The trick is to use just a few words in the Topic or Description box—you might type Mac OS X Simple Finder, for example, 
or Windows networking. When you press Enter, you see a list of the articles from the library. Click one to read the article in 
the bottom half of the window.

20.2 iChat AV
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
20.2 iChat AV
iChat AV, which you got free with Panther but costs $30 to the less enlightened who still use Mac OS X 10.2, is a combo 
communications program that does three things:
G     Instant messaging. If you don't know what instant messaging is, chances are there's a teenager near you who 
does.
It's like live email. You type messages to friends and colleagues in a chat window, in real time, and they type 
replies back to you. Instant messaging can be a great way to converse with the privacy of email but the immediacy 
of the phone.
In this regard, iChat is a lot like AOL's popular Instant Messenger (AIM) and Buddy Chats. In fact, iChat lets you 
type back and forth with any of AIM's 150 million members (it speaks the same "chat" language), which is a huge 
advantage. But iChat's visual design is pure Apple.
G     Free long distance. If your Mac has a microphone, and so does your buddy, the two of you can also chat out loud, 
using the Internet as a free long-distance telephone.
G     Free videoconferencing. The "AV" in the name stands, of course, for audio-video. If you and your buddy each 
have broadband Internet connections and a FireWire camera—like Apple's own iSight camera, or (if your Mac has 
a G4 or G5 chip) even a digital camcorder—the two of you can conduct one-on-one video chats. It's the perfect 
way to keep in touch when you're on the road—and about $99,900 less expensive than professional 
videoconferencing gear.
20.2.1 Two Chat Networks
iChat lets you reach out to fellow chat partners on two different networks:
G     The Internet. If you've signed up for a .Mac account (the free kind or the paid kind) or a free AOL Instant 
Messenger account, you can chat with anyone in the 150-million-member AOL Instant Messenger network.
G     Your own local network. Thanks to the Rendezvous technology described in Section 12.2.10.1, you can 
communicate with other Macs on your network without signing up for anything at all—and without being online. 
This is a terrific feature when you're sitting around a conference table, idly chatting with colleagues using your 
wireless laptop (and the boss thinks you're taking notes).
These two kinds of chats operate in parallel. Each network (AIM and Rendezvous) has its own separate Buddy List window 
and its own chat window. The File menu offers separate commands for connecting to each network ("Log In to AIM" and 
"Log In to Rendezvous").
Otherwise, however, chatting and videoconferencing work identically on both networks. Keep that in mind as you read the 
following pages.
20.2.2 Signing Up
When you open iChat for the first time, you see the "Welcome To iChat" window (Figure 20-4). To use iChat via the 
Internet, you need an account. Fortunately, these accounts are free, and there are a couple different ways to acquire one. 
:34 AM
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-2.html (1 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06

20.2 iChat AV
If you're already a member of Apple's .Mac service (Chapter 18 ), your Mac.com user name and password appear here 
automatically. If not, you can access iChat in either of two ways: via a free .Mac account or with a free AIM account.
20.2.2.1 A Free .Mac Account
Although Apple charges $100 for an annual .Mac subscription, you can get an iChatonly account for free. Details are in 
Figure 20-4. (You'll sign up for a free iChat account name, and you'll also get 60 days of the more complete .Mac treatment 
described in Chapter 18. When your trial period ends, you'll lose access to all of the other stuff that .Mac provides, but you'll 
get to keep your iChat name.)
NOTE
If your .Mac name is missingmanualguy, you'll actually appear to everyone else as missingmanualguy@mac.
com. The software tacks on the "@mac.com" suffix automatically, which adds a certain unwieldiness to your 
"handle."
The rest of the setup process offers you the chance to fine-tune your video camera, if you have one. Another screen asks, 
"Do you want to turn on Rendezvous messagiChat ing?" As noted above, that refers to chats with other people in your 
building, on your network. Your answer here doesn't really matter; if you decline, you can always choose iChat
Log Into 
Rendezvous later.
Top: The Welcome screen explains the concept of iChat AV. When you click Continue, you 
arrive at the "Set up a new iChat account" screen. To sign up for a free, iChat-only .Mac 
account, click the "Get an iChat Account" button, proceed to Apple's iChat Signup Web page, 
type in your name and email address, and make up a screen name and password for yourself. 
Once that's done, return to this dialog box, fill in your freshly minted iChat address (which ends 
with "@mac. com") and password, and click Continue.

20.2 iChat AV
 
20.2.2.2 An AIM Account
You don't have to have a .Mac name to use iChat; you can use an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) name instead. From the 
Account Type pop-up menu on the Welcome to iChat screen, choose AIM Account. From here, choose the category that 
fits you:
G     You're a paying AOL member. Enter your AOL screen name and password, and click OK.
G     You've used AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) before. You can use your AIM screen name and password here.
G     You've never used AOL or AIM. You may still have a valid chat name if you've ever created a screen name at 
Netscape.com or one of the Time Warner Web sites (People, Time, and Sports Illustrated magazines, plus CNN.
com), all of which are part of the same megalithic corporate AOL family.
G     None of the above. If you've racked your brain and can't come up with an AOL account name and password, don't 
worry—you can get one for free. Open your Web browser and go to my.screenname.aol.com Click "Get a Screen 
Name" to make up an AOL screen name.

20.2 iChat AV
Once you've signed up, you can enter your new name and password in the Welcome to iChat screen. You're 
almost ready to go!
NOTE
To inspect or change your AOL name, visit the iChat
Preferences
Accounts pane.
20.2.3 The Buddy List
Once you've entered your account information, you're technically ready to start chatting. All you need now is a chatting 
companion, or what's sweetly called a (buddy in instant-messaging circles. Fortunately, iChat comes complete with a Buddy 
List window in which you can house the chat "addresses" for all your friends, relatives, and colleagues out there on the 
Internet.
NOTE
There's a very similar list for chatting on your office network, by the way: the Rendezvous list. The following 
discussion deals mainly with the Buddy List window, though, because you can't put any names into your 
Rendezvous list. Anyone who's on the network (and running iChat) appears automatically in the Rendezvous 
list, courtesy of the Rendezvous technology.
The Buddy List is where you store the names of everyone you know who uses iChat or AOL 
Instant Messenger. Click the + button to add a new buddy, either by connecting your buddy to 
the name of someone in your address book or by adding a brand-new buddy from scratch (by 
clicking New Person). The telephone icon tells you that the buddy has a microphone, and is 
ready for a free Internet "phone call." If you see a movie-camera icon, you can have a 
fullscreen, high-quality video chat with that person, because they, like you, have a camcorder 
or FireWire camera and a high-speed Internet connection.

20.2 iChat AV
 
20.2.4 Making a List
When you start iChat, your Buddy List automatically appears (Figure 20-5). (If you don't see it, choose Window
Buddy 
List [for AIM buddies] or Window
Rendezvous [for local office network buddies].)
Adding a buddy to this list entails knowing that person's account name, whether it's on AIM or Mac.com. Once you have it, 
you can either choose Buddies
Add a Buddy (Shift-
-A) or click the + button at the bottom-left corner of the window.
Out slides a sheet attached to the Buddy List window, offering a window into the Address Book program (Chapter 19). 
Scroll through the list until you find the name you want (or enter the first few letters into the Search box), click the name, 
and then click Select Buddy.
If your chat companion isn't already in your Address Book, click New Person and enter the buddy's AIM or .Mac address. 
You're adding this person to both your Buddy List and Address Book.

20.2 iChat AV
If you've used AIM before, you may find that you've already got buddies in your list. That's because AIM accounts store 
their buddy lists on AOL's computers, so that you can keep your buddies even if you switch computers.
As you accumulate buddies, your Buddy List may become crowded. But if you choose

Show Offline Buddies to turn off the check mark, you'll only see your currently 
online buddies in the Buddy List—a much more meaningful list for the temporarily lonely.
20.2.5 Let the Chat Begin
As with any conversation, somebody has to talk first. In chat circles, that's called inviting someone to a chat.
You're being invited to a chat! Your buddy wants to have a typed chat (top left) or a spoken one 
(top right). To begin chatting, click the invitation window, type a response in the bottom text 
box if you like (for text chats), and click Accept (or press Enter).
Click Block to lock out the person sending you messages—a good trick if someone's harassing 
you.
 
20.2.5.1 They invite you
To "turn on your pager" so that you'll be notified when someone wants to chat with you, run iChat. Hide its windows, if you 
like, by pressing 
 -H.

20.2 iChat AV
When someone tries to "page" you for a chat, iChat comes forward automatically and shows you an invitation message like 
the one in Figure 20-6. If the person initiating a chat isn't already in your Buddy List, you'll simply see a note that says 
"Message from [name of the person]."
20.2.5.2 You invite them
To invite somebody in your Buddy List to a chat:
G     For a text chat, double-click the person's name, type a quick invite ("You there?"), and press Enter.
G     To start an audio or video chat, click the microphone or movie-camera icon in your Buddy List (shown in Figure 20-
5).
To initiate a chat with someone who isn't in the Buddy List, choose File
New Chat With Person. Type the account 
name of the person and click OK to send the invitation.
Either way, you can have more than one chat going at once. Real iChat nerds wind up with screens overflowing with 
individual chat windows. Juggling them all, and keeping them all current, is just part of the fun.
20.2.6 Text Chatting
A typed chat works like this: Each time you or your chat partner types something and then presses Enter, the text appears 
on both your screens (Figure 20-7). iChat displays each typed comment next to an icon, which can be any of these three 
things:
UP TO SPEED
Chat vs. Instant Messaging
Double-clicking someone in your Buddy List invites them to instant message you. You're not inviting them to 
chat with you, which is technically different.
Not much different, though. One of the few differences: You can name a chat.
For example, you might be asked by friends to join a particular chat already in progress, in a named chat 
room. Maybe you're a member of a fantasy football league, and your preseason draft is taking place in an 
AOL chat room.
To join an existing named chat, choose File
Go to Chat. Type the name of the chat you want to join, and 
click OK.
To create your own named chat, choose File
Go to Chat, type a unique name for it, and click OK. Then 
you'll be in an empty chat room. Tell your friends the name of the room you've created, or just drag their icons 
out of the Buddy List and into the chat's Participants list to invite them.
Or, to invite someone to chat without having to set up a name for the "room," Control-click a name in the 
Buddy List and choose Invite to Chat from the contextual menu.

20.2 iChat AV
G     A picture they added. If the buddy added her own picture—to her own copy of iChat or AOL Instant Messenger—
it will be transmitted to you, appearing automatically in the chat window. Cool!
G     A picture you added. If you've added a picture of your buddy to the Buddy List or Address Book, you see it here 
instead. (After all, your vision of what somebody looks like may not match his own self-image.)
G     Generic. If nobody's done icon-dragging of any sort, you'll get a generic icon— either a blue globe (for .Mac 
people) or the AOL Instant Messenger running-man (for AIM people).
To choose a graphic to use as your own icon, click the square picture to the right of your own name at the top of the Buddy 
List. From the pop-up palette of recently selected pictures, choose Edit Picture to open the pop-up image-selection palette 
described on Section 11.3.2. Feel free to build an array of different graphics to represent yourself—and to change them in 
mid-chat, using this pop-up palette, much to the delight or confusion of your conversation partner.
As you chat, your comments always appear on the right. If you haven't yet created a custom 
icon, you'll look like a blue globe or an AOL running man. You can choose a picture for yourself 
either in your own Address Book card or right in iChat.
 
20.2.6.1 In-chat fun
Typing back and forth isn't the only thing you can do during a chat. You can also perform any of these productivity stunts:
G     Open the drawer. Choose View
Show Chat Participants to hide or show the "drawer" that lists every person in 
your current chat. To invite somebody new to the chat, click the + button at the bottom of the drawer, or drag the 
:34 AM

20.2 iChat AV
person's icon out of the Buddy List window and into this drawer.
G     Format your text. You can press 
-B or 
-I to make your next typed utterance bold or italic. Or change your 
color or font by choosing Format > Show Colors or Format
Show Fonts, which summons the standard Mac OS 
X color or font palettes. (If you use some weirdo font that your chat partners don't have installed, they won't see the 
same typeface.)
G     Insert a smiley. When you choose a face (like Undecided, Angry, or Frown) from the quick-access menu of smiley 
options (at the right end of the text-reply box), iChat inserts it as a graphic into your response.
On the other hand, if you know the correct symbols to produce smileys—where :) means a smiling face, for example
—you can save time by typing them instead of using the pop-up menu. iChat converts them into smiley icons on 
the fly, as soon as you send your reply.
G     Send a file. Choosing Buddies
Send a File lets you send a file to all the participants of your chat.
Better yet, just drag the file's icon from the Finder into the box where you normally type. (This trick works great with 
pictures.)
Either way, this is a fantastic way to transfer a file that would be too big to send by email. A chat window never gets 
"full," and no attachment is "too large" to send.
This method halves the time of transfer, too, since your recipient gets the file as you upload it. They don't have to 
wait 20 minutes for you to send the file, and then another 20 minutes to download it, as they would with email or 
FTP.
Note, though, that this option isn't available in old versions of the AOL Instant Messenger program—only new 
versions and iChat.
If you've opened the Participants drawer, you can drag files from the Finder onto individual 
participants' names in this drawer to send files directly to them.
G     Get Info on someone. If you click a name in your Buddy list and then choose Buddies
 Get Info, you get a 
little Info window about your buddy, where you can edit her name, email address, and picture. (If you change the 
picture here, you'll see it instead of the graphic your buddy chose for herself.)
If you choose Actions from the Show pop-up menu, meanwhile, you can make iChat react when this buddy logs in, 
logs out, or changes status—for example, by playing a sound or saying, "She's here! She's here!"
G     Send an Instant Message. Not everything in a chat session has to be "heard" by all participants. If you choose 
Buddies
Send Instant Message, you'll get a private chat window, where you can "whisper" something directly 
to a special someone behind the other chatters' backs.
G     Send Direct Message. A Direct Message (Buddies
Send Direct Message) is exactly like an Instant Message, 
except that it's exclusively for sending notes to other people using iChat. It sends a message Mac to Mac, rather 
than via AOL's central server (which is what happens during an Instant Message session). For anyone who lies 
awake worrying that some disgruntled AOL engineer is peeking in on the instant-message traffic passing through 
AOL's computers, Direct Messaging is a more private channel.
G     Send Email. If someone messages you, "Hey, will you email me directions?" you can do so on the spot by 
choosing Buddies
Send Email. Your Mail program opens up automatically so that you can send the note along.
G     Send an SMS message to a cellphone. If you're using an AIM screen name, and you know somebody who has a

cellphone capable of receiving SMS (Short Message Service) notes, try this wacky variation: Choose File
New 
Chat with Person. In the address box that pops up, type +1 and the full cellphone number. For (212) 555-1212, 
you'd type this: +12125551212.
Press Enter to return to the chat window. Type a very short message (a couple of sentences, tops) and then press 
Enter. Obviously, you won't be able to carry on much of an interactive conversation this way—the only response 
you'll get is from AOL's computers, letting you know that your message has been sent. But what a great way to 
shoot a "Call me!" or "Running late—see you tonight!" or "Turn on channel 4 right now!!!" message to someone's 
phone.
When you minimize the iChat message window, its Dock icon displays the icon of the person 
you're chatting with—a handy reminder that they're still there.
20.2.6.2 Popping the Balloons
The words you might have for iChat's word-balloon design might be "cute" and "distinctive." But it's equally likely that your 
choice of words includes "juvenile" and "annoying."
Fortunately, behind iChat's candy coating are enough options that you'll certainly find one that works for you (see Figure 20-
8).
You can even change iChat's white background to any image using View
Set Chat Background. Better yet, find a 
picture you like and drag it into your chat window; iChat immediately makes it the background of your chat. To get rid of the 
background and revert to soothing white, choose View
Clear Chat Background.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
The Chat Transcript
Every now and then, you'll wish you could preserve a chat for all time: a particularly meaningful conversation 
with a friend, lover, or customer-service agent.
On the iChat
Preferences
Messages panel, you can turn on "Automatically save chat transcripts." 
From now on, the text of your conversations is automatically saved in your Home
Documents
iChats 
folder. To view a chat later, just double-click its icon. It opens within iChat, compete with all colors and 
formatting.
Even if you don't turn on this "Automatically" checkbox, you can always save individual chats in progress by 
choosing File
Save a Copy As.

Ordinarily, messages you type aren't "broadcast" until you actually press Enter. But if you 
prefer the adrenaline rush of a live, watch-my-letters-appear-as-I-type-them effect, choose 
iChat
Preferences. Turn on "Send text as I type." (As noted in the dialog box, this 
feature works only in Rendezvous chats—that is, chats on your own network, usually within 
the same building.)
iChat can look like almost anything. Here, for example, is what a chat looks like with the balloon 
effect turned off (giving you colored rectangles instead), and with balloons and pictures turned 
off. You can even hide the names, if you like. You make these changes for a chat in progress 
using the View menu. You can also change the color and typeface settings, meanwhile, in the

Messages panel.

20.2 iChat AV
iChat becomes much more exciting when you exploit the "AV" part of its name. Even over a dial-up modem connection, you 
can conduct audio chats, speaking into your microphone and listening to the responses from your speaker.
But if you and your partner both have broadband Internet connections, an even more impressive feat awaits. You can 
conduct a free video chat, viewing your partner in a window as crisp, clear, bright and smooth as television—as big as your 
screen, if you like.
Apple offers this luxurious experience only if you have luxurious gear: a video camera with a FireWire connector. That can 
be an ordinary digital camcorder (as long as your Mac has at least a G4 chip inside), a golf-ball Webcam that connects via 
FireWire instead of USB, or the iSight, Apple's cylindrical camera-microphone appliance.
You can tell what kind of equipment your buddy has by the green telephone or camcorder icon next to his name in the 
Buddy List.
G     To begin an audio chat: Click the telephone icon next to the buddy's name, or highlight someone in the Buddy List 
and then click the microphone icon at the bottom of the list, or (if you're already in a text chat) choose 
Buddies
Invite to Audio Chat.
Once your invitation is accepted, you can begin speaking to each other. The bars of the sound-level meter let you 
know that the microphone—which you've specified in the iChat
Preferences
Video tab—is working.
G     To begin a video chat: Click the camera icon next to the buddy's name, or highlight someone in the Buddy List and 
then click the camcorder icon at the bottom of the list, or (if you're already in a text chat) choose Buddies
Invite 
to Video Chat.
A window opens, showing you. This Preview mode is intended to show what your buddy will see. (You'll probably 
discover that you need some kind of light in front of you to avoid being too shadowy.)
You don't both need the same gear. If only you have a camera, for example, you can choose 
Buddies
 Invite to One-Way Video Chat (or Audio Chat). Your less-equipped buddy will 
see or hear you, but will have to type in response.
Once your buddy clicks Accept, the chat can begin (see Figure 20-9).
That's you in the smaller window. To move your own mini-window, click a different corner, or 
just drag yourself around with the mouse. If you need to blow your nose or do something else 
unseemly, Option-click the microphone button to freeze the video and mute the audio. Click 
again to resume.

20.2 iChat AV
 
Here's what you'll discover about audio and video chatting:
G     Although the audio is full-duplex (you can hear and speak simultaneously, like a phone but unlike a walkie-talkie), 
there may be a delay, like you're calling overseas on a bad connection.
G     If your conversation partners seem unwilling to make eye contact, it's not because they're shifty. They're just 
looking at you, on the screen, rather than at the camera —and chances are you aren't looking into your camera, 
either.
G     This cutting-edge technology can occasionally present cutting-edge glitches: The video quality deteriorates, the 
transmission aborts suddenly, the audio has an annoying echo, and so on. To find a tidy list of problems and 
solutions, choose Help
iChat Help and click the Solving Problems link.
G     If you use iChat AV with a camcorder, you can set the camera to VTR (playback) mode and play a tape right over 
the Internet to whoever is on the other end! (The video appears flipped horizontally on your screen, but looks right 
to the other person.)
You can't record audio or video, or at least not without a screen-recording shareware 
program like SnapzPro X (www.ambrosiasw.com ). But you can capture a still "photo" of a 
video chat by 
-dragging the image to your desktop, or by choosing Video
Take 
Snapshot (Option-
-S).

20.2 iChat AV
If you've done nothing but chat in iChat, you haven't even scratched the surface. The iChat
Preferences dialog box 
gives you plenty of additional control. A few examples:
G     General pane. If you turn on Show status in menu bar, you bring the iChat menulet to your menu bar. It lets you 
change your iChat status (Available, Away, and so on), whether you're in iChat or not.
And if you turn off When I quit iChat, set my status to Offline, then quitting iChat doesn't actually log you out. 
When someone wants a chat with you, iChat will open automatically.
G     Accounts pane. If you have more than one AIM or .Mac account, you can switch among them here. Your 
passwords are conveniently saved in your Mac OS X Keychain.
G     Messages pane. The Messages preference panel lets you design your chat windows—the background color, word 
balloon color, and typeface and size of text you type.
If you want to set a special background image for your chats, you can do that, too—just drag a graphics file into the 
chat preview box on this pane. You can revert to a white background by choosing View
Clear Background.
G     Alerts pane. Here, you can choose how iChat responds to various events. For example, it can play a sound, 
bounce its Dock icon, or say something out loud whenever you log in, log out, receive new messages, or whatever.
G     Privacy pane. If you're worried about being interrupted by people who think they're your buddies but are horribly, 
horribly confused, you can limit your visibility.
The "Allow anyone" setting means that anyone can chat with you. (You still have one small level of privacy, even at 
this level: If you turn off "Allow anyone to see that I am idle," nobody will know when you've stepped away from 
your Mac to make a sandwich.)
The other privacy levels permit only people in your Buddy List to see and chat with you, only certain people whose 
names you type, nobody (Block Everyone), or everybody but people on a list that you type (Block Specific People).
G     Video pane. This is where you get a preview of your own camera's output, limit the amount of bandwidth (signal-
hogging data) the camera uses (a troubleshooting step), and specify that you want iChat AV to fire up automatically 
whenever you switch on the camera.

20.3 iCal
In many ways, iCal is not so different from those "Hunks of the Midwest Police Stations" paper calendars we leave hanging 
on our walls for months past their natural life span. But iCal offers several advantages over paper calendars. For example:
G     It can automate the process of entering repeating events, such as weekly staff meetings or gym workout dates.
G     iCal can give you a gentle nudge (with a sound, a dialog box, or even an email) when an important appointment is 
approaching.
G     iCal can share information with your Address Book program, with Mail, with your iPod, with other Macs, with 
"published" calendars on the Internet, or with a Palm organizer. Some of these features require one of those .Mac 
accounts described in Chapter 18, and some require iSync (described later in this chapter). But iCal also works just 
fine on a single Mac, even without an Internet connection.
20.3.1 Working with Views
When you open iCal, you see something like Figure 20-10. By clicking one of the View buttons on the bottom edge of the 
calendar, you can switch among any of these views:
G     Day shows the appointments for a single day in the main calendar area, broken down by time slot.
If you choose iCal
Preferences, in fact, you can specify what hours constitute workday. This is ideal both for 
those annoying power-life people who get up at a.m. for two hours of calisthenics, and for the more reasonable 
people who sleep until 11 a.m. before rolling out of bed and heading over to the home office in the den. This same 
dialog box lets you limit the number of hours visible in each Day view (choose from the "Show __ hours at a time" 
pop-up menu); as you make this number lower, the time slots get larger, for your nearsighted pleasure.
G     Week fills the main display area with seven columns, reflecting the current week. (You can change the display to a 
five-day work week instead in iCal
Preferences.)
G     Month shows the entire month that contains the current date. Double-click a date number to jump to the day view 
for that date.
iCal provides a quick way to get to the current day's date—choose View
Go to Today, or 
press 
-T.
20.3.2 Making an Appointment
The basic iCal calendar is easy to figure out. After all, with the exception of one unfortunate Gregorian incident, we've been 
using calendars successfully for centuries.
Even so, there are two ways to record a new appointment: a simple way and a more flexible, elaborate way.
Left: Week view. The miniature navigation calendar provides an overview of adjacent months. 
You can jump to a different week or day by clicking the triangle buttons (or using them as pop-
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (1 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

up menus), and then clicking within the numbers. If the event is recurring, its upper "grip strip" 
shows two stacked squares.
Right: Month view. You can hide the To Do list either using the Window
Hide To Dos 
command, or just by clicking the thumbtack button identified here.
 
20.3.2.1 The easy way
You can quickly record an appointment using any of several techniques, listed here in order of decreasing efficiency:
G     Double-click the appointed time on the calendar, in any view. A colored box appears, where you type the name for 
your new appointment.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (2 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
G     When viewing a day or week view, drag vertically through the time slots that represent the appointment's duration, 
and then type inside the newly created colored box.
G     Using the month view, double-click in a blank area of the appropriate date's square, and then type in the newly 
created colored bar.
G     Choose File
New Event (or press 
-N). A new appointment appears on the currently selected day, 
regardless of the current view.
G     In any view, Control-click a date and choose New Event from the contextual menu.
Unless you use the drag-over-hours method, a new event believes itself to be one hour long, but you can adjust its duration 
by dragging the bottom edge vertically. Drag the dark top bar up or down to adjust the start time.
In many cases, that's all there is to it. You have just specified the day, time, and title of the appointment. You can get on 
with your life.
20.3.2.2 The long way
The information drawer shown in Figure 20-11 contains all the details for a certain appointment. (If it's not already open, 
you can open the drawer by clicking the gray i button at the lower-right corner of the window.) Using this drawer, you can 
create far more specific appointments, decked out with far more bells and whistles.
You can open this Info drawer by double-clicking a calendar square or dragging through a 
swath of hours on any day or week view (background, left). The ending date information is 
generally dimmed except for events that span more than one day (and to make an event do 
that, you must turn on "all day").
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (3 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
 
For each appointment, you can Tab your way to the following information areas:
G     Subject. That's the large, bold type at the top—the name of your appointment. For example, you might type Fly to 
Phoenix. 
G     location. This field makes a lot of sense; if you think about it, almost everyone needs to record where a meeting is 
to take place whenever such an appointment comes up. You might type a reminder for yourself like My place, a 
specific address like 212 East 23, or some other helpful information like a contact phone number or flight number.
G     all-day. An "all-day" event of course, refers to something that has no specific time of day associated with it: a 
holiday, a birthday, a book deadline. When you turn on this box, you'll see the name of the appointment jump to the 
top of the iCal screen, in the area reserved for this kind of thing (see Figure 20-10).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (4 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
If you turn on "all-day," you can use the "to" date to specify a different ending date. The result 
is a banner across the top of the calendar, like the one shown in Figure 20-10.
G     from, to. You can adjust the times shown here by typing, clicking buttons, or both. (Press Tab to jump from one 
setting to another, and from there to the hours and minutes of the starting time.)
For example, start by clicking the hour, then increase or decrease this number either by pressing your up and down 
arrow keys, or by typing a number. Press Tab to highlight the minutes, and repeat the arrow buttons-or-keys 
business. Finally, press Tab to highlight the AM/PM indicator, and type either A or P—or press the up or down 
arrow key—to change it, if necessary.
G     attendees. If the appointment is a meeting or some other gathering, you can type the participants' names here. If a 
name is already in your Address Book program, iCal proposes auto-completing the name for you; if you type in 
fresh names and separate them by commas, iCal automatically turns each into a shaded oval pop-up button, as 
shown in Figure 20-11. You can click it for a pop-up menu of commands like Remove Attendee and Send Email. 
(That option appears only if the person in your Address Book has an email address, or if you typed a name with an 
email address in brackets, like this: Chris Smith <chris@yahoo.com>.)
You can also drag people out of your Address Book list directly into this Attendees 
area.
The word Attendees is itself a pop-up menu, too. If you use it to choose Send Invitations, iCal fires up Mail and 
prepares ready-to-send messages, each with an iCal.ics attachment: a standard calendar-program invitation file.
Your guest will get an email message that says, "Chris Smith has invited you to the event: Company Hoedown, 
scheduled for Wednesday, February 02, 2005 at 3:00PM. To accept or decline this invitation, click the link below."
Unfortunately, there generally is no link below unless your guests happen to use Mac OS X and Mail. It's a great 
idea for a feature, but extremely limited in scope at the moment.
If your lucky recipient does use Mail, clicking the iCal.ics attachment opens up a dialog box that offers Accept and 
Decline. When your guest clicks one of these buttons, an RSVP message goes back to you. Once Mail has 
downloaded the response, you've opened its attachment, and you've clicked OK, iCal updates the invitee's status 
in the Event Info window. You'll see the word Pending, Accepted, or Declined next to each name. (And your 
guests, meanwhile, will be delighted to find that the appointment has automatically appeared on their calendars.)
G     status. You can use this pop-up menu to classify the appointment as Tentative, Confirmed, or Cancelled. A 
corresponding icon appears next to the event's name on your calendar.
G     repeat. The pop-up menu here (which starts out saying None) contains common options for recurring events: every 
day, every week, and so on.
Once you've made a selection, you get an end pop-up menu that lets you specify when this event should stop 
repeating. If you choose "Never," you'll be stuck seeing this event repeating on your calendar until the end of time 
(a good choice for recording, say, your anniversary, especially if your spouse might be consulting the same 
calendar). You can also turn on "after" (a certain number of times), which is a useful option for car and mortgage 
payments. And if you choose "on date," you can specify the date that the repetitions come to an end; use this

option to indicate the last day of school, for example.
G     alarm. This pop-up menu tells iCal how to notify you when a certain appointment is about to begin. iCal can send 
the three kinds of flags to get your attention: It can display a message on the screen (with a sound, if you like), 
send you an email, or open a file on your hard drive. (You could use this unusual option to ensure that you don't 
forget a work deadline by making the relevant document fling open in front of your face at the eleventh hour.)
Once you've specified an alarm mechanism, a new pop-up menu appears to let you specify how much advance 
notice you want for this particular appointment. If it's a TV show you like to watch, you might set up a reminder only 
five minutes before airtime. If it's a birthday, you might set up a two-day warning to give yourself enough time to 
buy a present, and so on.
G     calendar. A calendar, in iCal's confusing terminology, is a subset—a category—into which you can place various 
appointments. You can create one for yourself, another for family-only events, another for book-club appointments, 
and so on. Later, you'll be able to hide and show these categories at will, adding or removing them from the 
calendar with a single click.
Use this same pop-up menu to change an appointment's category. If you filed something in 
Company Memos that should have been in Sweet Nothings for Honey-Poo, open its 
information drawer and reassign it. Quick.
G     url. What Apple really means here, of course, is URL—a Uniform Resource Locator, better known as a Web 
address like www.apple.com. If there's a URL relevant to this appointment, by all means type it here. Type more 
than one, if it will help you (separating each with a comma).
G     notes. Here's your chance to customize your calendar event. You can type, paste, or drag any text that you like in 
the notes area—driving directions, contact phone numbers, a call history, or whatever.
Your newly scheduled event now shows up on the calendar, complete with the color coding that corresponds to the 
calendar category you've assigned.
20.3.3 What to Do with an Appointment
Once you've entrusted your agenda to iCal, you can start putting it to work. iCal is only too pleased to remind you (via pop-
up messages) of your events, reschedule them, print them out, and so on. Here are a few of the possibilities.
20.3.3.1 Editing events
To edit a calendar event's name, double-click it.
To edit any of the appointment's other characteristics, you have to open its Info drawer, as described in the previous 
section. To do that in day or week view, doubleclick the top bar (where its time appears); in month view, double-click the dot 
before the name.
Or, in any view, highlight an event's name and then click the round blue i button in the lower-right corner of the iCal window.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (6 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
If you simply want to change an appointment's "calendar" category, you can bypass the Info 
drawer. Instead, just Control-click the appointment's name (or anywhere on its block), and 
choose the category you want from the resulting contextual menu.
You don't have to bother with this if all you want to do is reschedule an event, however, as described next.
20.3.3.2 Rescheduling events
If an event in your life gets rescheduled, you can drag an appointment block vertically in its column to make it later or earlier 
the same day, or horizontally to another date in day or week view. (If you reschedule a recurring event, iCal asks you if you 
want to change only this occurrence, or this and all future ones.)
If something is postponed for, say, a month or two, you're in trouble; you can't drag an appointment beyond its month 
window. You have no choice but to open the Info drawer and edit the starting and ending dates or times—or just cut and 
paste the event to a different date.
20.3.3.3 Lengthening or shortening events
If a scheduled meeting becomes shorter or your lunch hour becomes a lunch hourand- a-half (in your dreams), changing 
the length of the representative calendar event is as easy as dragging the top or bottom border of its block in any column 
view (see Figure 20-12).
In Week view, if you've grabbed the top or bottom edge of an appointment's block so that the 
cursor changes, you can drag horizontally to make an appointment cross the midnight line 
and extend into a second day.
You can resize any iCal calendar event just by dragging its border. As your cursor touches the 
bottom edge of a calendar event, it turns into a horizontal line with arrows above and below. 
You can now drag the event's edge to make it take up more or less time on your calendar.

20.3 iCal
 
20.3.3.4 Printing events
To commit your calendar to paper, choose File
Print, or press 
-P. In the resulting Print dialog box, choose iCal from 
the lower pop-up menu to look over your printout options—for example, to print only a certain range of dates (a welcome 
improvement in Panther).
20.3.3.5 Deleting events
To delete an appointment, just select it and then press the Delete key. In the confirmation dialog box, click Delete (or press 
Enter). If you delete a recurring event (like a weekly meeting), iCal asks whether you want to delete just that particular 
instance of the event, or the whole series from that point forward.
If you're a laptop-toting traveler, iCal can keep right up with your changing time zones. In 
iCal
Preferences, turn on "Turn on time zone support." From now on, the Info drawer 
shown in Figure 20-11 offers a new pop-up menu for each appointment. Its Other command 
lets you tell it where you'll be on that day (you click to pinpoint your location on a tiny world 
map).
Then, as you travel, use the new pop-up menu of time zones in the upper-right corner of 
iCal's window. You'll see all of your appointments snap to the correct time slots for your 
current location, so that you're always on time and up to date.
20.3.4 Searching for Events
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (8 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
You should recognize the oval text box at the bottom of the iCal screen immediately: it's almost identical to the one in 
Preview, iTunes, the Finder toolbar, and so on. This search box is designed to let you hide all appointments except those 
matching what you type into it. Figure 20-13 has the details.
20.3.5 The "Calendar" Category Concept
Just as iTunes has playlists that let you organize songs into subsets, and iPhoto has albums that let you organize photos 
into subsets, iCal has something called calendars that let you organize appointments into subsets. One person might have 
calendars called Home, Work, and TV Reminders. Another might have Me, Spouse 'n' Me, and Whole Family. A small 
business could have categories called Deductible Travel, R&D, and R&R. They can be anything you like.
To create a calendar, double-click any white space in the Calendar list (below the others), or click the + button at the lower-
left corner of the iCal window. Type a name that defines the category in your mind.
To change the color-coding of your category, click the i info button, or choose Window
 Show Info (
-I). The Calendar 
Info drawer appears, looking a lot like the Event Info drawer shown in Figure 20-11. Here, you can change the name, color, 
or description of this category.
You assign an appointment to one of these categories using the pop-up menu on its Info drawer, or by Control-clicking an 
event and choosing a calendar name from the resulting contextual menu. After that, you can hide or show an entire 
category of appointments at once just by turning on or off the appropriate checkbox in the Calendars list.
Click a calendar name before you create an appointment. That way, the appointment will 
already belong to the correct calendar.
As you type into the search box, iCal filters your calendar until only events with matching text 
are visible. It screens out both the text list and the colored boxes on the calendar itself, so that 
you can produce, in seconds, a calendar that shows only events pertaining to a particular client 
or project. (You can also open up this list view by clicking the button identified here at right.)

20.3 iCal
 
20.3.6 "Publishing" Calendars to the Web
One of iCal's best features is its ability to post your calendar on the Web, so that other people—or you, using a different 
computer—can subscribe to it, which adds your appointments to their calendars. If you have a .Mac account, then anyone 
with a Web browser can also view your calendar, right online.
For example, you might use this feature to post the meeting schedule for a group or club that you manage, or to make clear 
the agenda for a series of financial meetings coming up that all of your coworkers will need to consult.
20.3.6.1 Publishing
Since iCal can publish only one "calendar" (category) at a time, there's no way to publish both your corporate appointments 
and your personal ones. Begin, then, by clicking the calendar category you want in the left-side list.
Then choose Calendar
Publish; the dialog box shown in Figure 20-14 appears. Here you customize how your saved 
calendar is going to look and work. You can even turn on "Publish changes automatically," so that whenever you edit the 
calendar, iCal connects to the Internet and updates the calendar automatically.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (10 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
CalSync ($5, www.itoast.de/eng/calSync) lets you publish your calendars to any FTP server 
and have them updated automatically, in full subscribable form.
If you click "Publish calendar on .Mac," iCal posts the calendar —the actual, viewable calendar
—on the Web, as shown in Figure 20-15. If you click "Publish calendar on a WebDAV server," 
you have the freedom to upload the calendar to your own personal Web site, if it's WebDAV-
compatible. In this case, however, your fans will be able to download (and subscribe to) the 
calendar, but won't be able to view it online.
 
When you click Publish, your Mac connects to the Web and then shows you the Web address (URL) of the finished page, 
complete with a Send Mail button that lets you fire the URL off to your colleagues.
20.3.6.2 Subscribing
If somebody else has published a calendar, you subscribe to it by choosing Calendar
 Subscribe. In the Subscribe to 
Calendar dialog box, type in the Internet address you received from the person who published the calendar. Alternatively, 
click the Subscribe button in any iCal Web page (shown in Figure 20-15 at top right).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (11 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
Your calendar is now live on the Web. Your visitors can control the view, switch dates, double-
click an appointment for details —it's like iCal Live! This feature of iCal is a brilliant solution to 
the old, "My spouse and I each have a Palm, but we can't see each other's calendars" problem. 
In conjunction with iSync (described later in this chapter), each person can now summon the 
other's calendar to the screen on demand.
 
Either way, you can also specify how often you want your own copy to be updated (assuming you have a full-time Internet 
connection), and whether or not you want to be bothered with the publisher's alarms and notes.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (12 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
When it's all over, you see a new "calendar" category in your left-side list, representing the appointments from the published 
calendar.
Want to try it out right now? Visit www.icalshare.com, a worldwide clearinghouse for sets of 
iCal appointments. You can subscribe to calendars for shuttle launches, Mac trade shows, 
National Hockey League teams, NASCAR races, soccer matches, the Iron Chef and Survivor 
TV shows, holidays, and much more. You'll never suffer from empty-calendar syndrome 
again.
20.3.7 To Do Lists
iCal's Tasks feature lets you make a To Do list and helps to shepherd you along by giving you gentle reminders, if you so 
desire (Figure 20-16).
Using the To Do Info drawer (right), you can also give your note a priority, a calendar 
(category), or a due date. (Tasks that come due won't show up on the calendar itself, but a little 
exclamation-point triangle appears in the To Do Items list.)
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-3.html (13 of 14)5/3/2004 5:06:40 AM

20.3 iCal
 
To see the list, click the little pushpin button at the lower-right corner of the iCal screen. Add a new task by double-clicking 
in the To Do Items list that appears.
To change a task's priority, click the set of three horizontal bars to the to-do item's right. With each click, you add a bar, 
corresponding to three priority levels, and the list re-sorts itself accordingly. (You can change the sorting order by Control-
clicking anywhere in the list and using the Sort By command.) To delete a task, click it and then press the Delete key.

20.4 iSync
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
20.4 iSync
If Apple ever had evidence to back up its "digital hub" hype, iSync is it.
This attractive, simple program is designed to keep the calendars and phone lists on your various computers, Palm 
organizer, cellphone, and even your iPod in perfect synchronization, sparing you the headache of the modern age: inputting 
the same information over and over again. (See Figure 20-20.)
Here's what it can keep synched:
G     A Bluetooth phone. iSync can keep your cellphone and Mac up-to-date with each other's calendar, Address Book, 
and to-do list. Of course, this requires that your Mac has a Bluetooth adapter (Section 6.2.5). And it requires a 
certain amount of technical setup (creating a phone profile, pairing the phone with your Mac, opening iSync and 
choosing Device
Add Device, and selecting the phone). You'll find detailed instructions in the iSync Help 
screens.
Apple lists the phones that are officially compatible with this feature at www.apple.com/isync/
devices . html. If your phone isn't on The List, don't miss www.taniwha.org.uk, a Web page 
that's loaded with drivers and installation instructions for specific phone models.
Top: For each gadget, you can specify which iCal calendar categories you want synched, which 
contacts, and (for a .Mac account) whether or not you want the synching to be automatic. 
Bottom: The Safeguard window warns you about exactly how many changes you're about to 
make. (You can turn off this confirmation box in the iSync
Preferences dialog box.) You can 
also revert your setup to the last sync, or back up all your data, using commands in the 
Devices menu. Even with all these safeguards, synchronization can be a tricky business. Just 
remember never to sync a device with more than one Mac. Similarly, sync only one of each 
device type (phone, Palm, or iPod) with a certain Mac. Otherwise, iSync may get hopelessly 
confused as to what's most current.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-4.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 5:06:43 AM

20.4 iSync
 
G     Other Macs. This part requires a .Mac account, but it can be fantastically useful. It means that you and a 
colleague, or you and a spouse, or you and yourself at the office, can keep your Macs' calendars, Address Book, 
and even Safari bookmarks in sync, using the Internet as an intermediary. Delete a phone number at work, and 
you'll find it deleted on your Mac at home, too.
To set this up, open iSync and click the .Mac icon. Click Register, type a name for your Mac, and then click 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-4.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 5:06:43 AM

20.4 iSync
Continue.
G     A Palm organizer. iSync can also keep iCal and Address Book synched with a Palmcompatible organizer. It 
doesn't do the work itself; it relies, behind the scenes, on Palm's own HotSync software, which must be installed 
and properly configured beforehand.
Once that's done, open HotSync Manager in your Palm folder. Choose HotSync
 Conduit Settings. Double-
click the item named iSync, and turn on "Enable iSync for this Palm device."
Click OK and quit HotSync Manager. You've just told Palm's own synching software to butt out. From now on, 
iSync will handle synching your Mac's info with its Address Book, Date Book, and To Do List. (To edit and sync 
Notes, you still need Palm Desktop.)
Finally, in iSync, use the Devices
Add Device command to make iSync "see" your Palm, which you've put into 
its cradle, attached to its cable, or (if it's a Bluetooth Palm) made discoverable. To start the synchronization, press 
the physical HotSync button on the palmtop's cradle, cable, or HotSync screen. (Clicking iSync's Sync Now button 
never affects the Palm—only the iPod, phone, and .Mac connections.)
G     An iPod. Connect the iPod to the Mac, and help iSync find it using the Devices
 Add Device command. Now 
it's simple to consult your little black book on your little white block. (Current iPod models include the calendar-
display feature. If you have an older iPod, you can download the calendar module for it from the Apple Web site. 
Note, too, that the synching is one-way: iSync copies your calendar and phone book to the iPod, but of course you 
can't use the iPod to add to, edit, or delete any of this information.)
When you open iSync, its toolbar shows the icons of any synchable devices connected to your Mac at the moment. Click 
the appropriate gadget on the toolbar—your iPod, for example—to see the synching options available. Turn on the 
checkboxes you want, and then click the Sync Now button. After asking what you want to do with each kind of data—"This 
is the first time you're syncing your bookmarks. What do you want to do for this sync? (Merge, Keep, Erase?)"—iSync does 
the deed.
Actually, you don't have to open iSync to trigger the synching—once you've installed the 
iSync menulet.
In iSync, choose iSync
Preferences and turn on "Show iSync in menu bar." From now 
on, you can get the synching under way by choosing Sync Now from the yin-yang arrow 
symbol on your menu bar.
iSync is plenty smart when it comes to resolving conflicts among your gadgets. For example, if you edit somebody's home 
phone number on your Palm, and your spouse simultaneously edits the same person's office number on the Mac, iSync will 
smoothly incorporate both changes into all copies of your address book. Unless you and your spouse both change the 
home number in different ways; then iSync will present a Resolve Conflicts button. Click it, and choose which info you 
believe should prevail.

20.5 Safari
If you want to get something done right, you have to do it yourself. 
Or at least that must be what Apple was thinking when it wrote its own Web browser, which so annoyed Microsoft that it 
promptly ceased all further work on its own, time-honored Mac browser, Internet Explorer.
Safari is beautiful, very fast, and filled with delicious features. It's not, however, Internet Explorer, and so some Web sites—
certain banking sites, for example—still refuse to acknowledge its existence (workarounds coming later in the chapter). For 
the near term, therefore, it's worth keeping Internet Explorer on hand for those situations when Safari can't get its foot in the 
door.
20.5.1 Browsing Basics and Toolbars
Navigating the Web requires little more than clicking buttons and/or those underlined blue phrases, as shown in Figure 20-
18.
The Safari window offers tools and features that let you navigate the Web almost effortlessly; 
these various toolbars and buttons are described in this chapter. One difference that may throw 
you: When you're loading a Web page, the progress bar appears as a colored stripe that 
gradually darkens the Address bar itself, rather than in a strip at the bottom of the window.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-5.html (1 of 15)5/3/2004 5:06:50 AM

20.5 Safari
 
You probably know the drill when it comes to Web browsers: When you click an underlined link (or hyperlink) or a picture 
button, you're transported from one Web page to another. One may be the home page of General Motors; another may 
contain critical information about a bill in Congress; another might have baby pictures posted by a parent in Omaha. Several 
hundred million Web pages await your visit.
Text links aren't always blue and underlined. In fact, modern Web designers sometimes make 
it very difficult to tell which text is clickable, and which is just text. When in doubt, just move 
your cursor over some text. If the arrow changes to a pointing-finger cursor, you've found 
yourself a link.
Some of the other Safari tips that may not be obvious:
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-5.html (2 of 15)5/3/2004 5:06:50 AM

20.5 Safari
G     Graphics worth saving. When you see a picture you'd like to keep, Control-click it and choose Download Image to 
Disk from the contextual menu. Safari promptly stores it as a new graphics file on your hard drive containing the 
picture you saved. (You'll find it in whatever download folder you specify on the Safari
Preferences
 
General tab.)
You can also save a graphic to the desktop just by dragging it there, right out of the Safari 
window.
G     Scroll bars. Use the scroll bar to move up and down the page—or to save mousing, press the Space bar each time 
you want to see more. Press Shift-Space to scroll up. (The Space bar has its traditional, space-making function only 
when the insertion point is blinking in a text box or the address bar.)
You can also press your up- and down-arrow keys to scroll. Page Up and Page Down scroll in full-screen 
increments, while Home and End whisk you to the top or bottom of the current Web page. And if your mouse has a 
scroll wheel, it works, too.
20.5.2 Safari Toolbars
Many of Safari's most useful controls come parked on toolbars and buttons that you summon or hide by choosing their 
names from the View menu. Here's what they do:
20.5.2.1 Address Bar
When you type a new Web page address (URL) into this strip and press Enter, the corresponding Web site appears. (If only 
an error message results, then you may have mistyped the address, or the Web page may have been moved or dismantled
—a relatively frequent occurrence.)
Because typing out Internet addresses is so central to the Internet experience and such a typo-prone hassle, the address 
bar is rich with features that minimize keystrokes. For example:
G     You don't have to click in the address bar before typing; just press 
-L.
G     You can highlight the entire address, ready to be typed over with a new one, by clicking the very upper edge of the 
address-bar text box. Or click the small icon just to the left of the current address. Or triple-click in the Address bar.
G     You don't have to type out the whole Internet address. You can omit the http://www and .com portions; Safari will fill 
in those standard address bits for you. To visit NYTimes.com, for example, a speed freak might press 
-L to 
highlight the address bar, type nytimes, and then press Enter.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-5.html (3 of 15)5/3/2004 5:06:50 AM

20.5 Safari
You're sitting in front of your Web browser and you suddenly realize you need to look up an 
appointment in iCal. What do you do?
The power users open other programs right from within Safari by typing ical:// in the address 
bar—or ichat://, addressbook://, or sherlock://—and then pressing Return or Enter.
You can even type mailto: to open a new outgoing email message in Mail, or mailto:
steve@apple.com to pre-address that outgoing message.
G     When you begin to type into the address bar, the auto-complete feature compares what you're typing against a list 
of Web sites you've recently visited. Safari displays a drop-down list of Web addresses that seem to match what 
you're typing. To spare yourself the tedium of typing out the whole thing, just click the correct complete address with 
your mouse, or use the down arrow key to reach the desired listing and then press Enter. The complete address 
you selected then pops into the address bar.
You might wonder why the View menu even offers you the chance to hide the address bar. 
After all, if it were hidden, how could you use the Web?
Simple: Even with this bar hidden, you can briefly summon it by pressing 
-L. Type the 
address you want, and then press Enter to make the bar disappear again. That's good news 
for people with small screens.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Let AutoFill Do the Typing
Safari can also remember user names, passwords, and other information you type into the text boxes you 
encounter in your Web travels.
To turn on this feature, visit the Safari
Preferences
AutoFill tab. If you turn on "Using info from my 
Address Book card," then whenever you're supposed to fill in your shipping address on a Web form, you can 
click the AutoFill button to have Safari fill in the blanks for you automatically. (If you don't see the little AutoFill 
button—see Figure 20-19—choose its name from the View menu.)
Alternatively, just click in a text box—"Name," for example— and start typing. As soon as Safari recognizes a 
familiar scrap of your contact information, it fills out the rest of the word automatically. (If it guessed wrong, just 
keep typing.)
If, in Preferences, you turn on "User names and passwords," then each time you type a password into a Web 
page, Safari offers to memorize it for you. It's a great time and memory saver, even though it doesn't work on 
all Web sites.
When you want Safari to "forget" your passwords—for security reasons, for example—revisit that

arrow, or 
-left bracket.
Once you've clicked Back, you can then click the Forward button (or 
-right arrow, or 
-right bracket) to return 
to the page you were on before you clicked the Back button. Click (and hold on) the Back button for a drop-down list 
of all the Web pages you've visited during this online session. (That pop-up menu lists the sites by name, as in 
"New York Times on the Web." To view the actual addresses instead, Option-click (and hold on) the Back or 
Forward button.)
Instead of click-and-holding the Back or Forward button for these tricks, you can save a half a 
second of waiting by adding the Control key as you click.
You summon or hide these buttons by choosing their names from the View menu. Some of 
them lack text labels, but all offer tooltip labels that you can read by pointing to the button 
without clicking.
 
G     Home. Click to bring up the Web page you've designated as your home page (in 
Safari
Preferences
General).
G     AutoFill. Click this button to make Safari fill in Web order forms with your name, address, and other information.

See the box on the facing page.
G     Text Size. You can adjust the point size of a Web page's text using these buttons (or by pressing 
-plus and 
-
minus). When you visit a Web site designed for Windows computers, whose text tends to look too small on Mac 
screens, you might want a bigger size.
G     Stop/Reload. Click the Stop button to interrupt the downloading of a Web page you've just requested (by mistake, 
for example). Keyboard shortcut: Esc or 
- period.
Once the page has finished loading, the Stop button turns into a Refresh button. Click this circular arrow if a page 
doesn't look or work quite right, or if you want to see the updated version of a Web page (such as a stock ticker) 
that changes constantly. Safari re-downloads the Web page and reinterprets its text and graphics. Keyboard 
shortcut: 
-R.
G     Add Bookmark. When you find a Web page you might like to visit again, click this button, or press 
-D, or 
choose Bookmarks
Add Bookmark, or drag its tiny icon in the Address bar directly onto your Bookmarks bar.
As shown in Figure 20-20, Safari offers to add this Web page's name (or a shorter name that you specify for it) 
either to the Bookmarks menu, or to the Bookmarks bar described below. The next time you want to visit that page, 
just choose its name.
Press Shift-
-D instead to add the bookmark to the menu instantly, no questions 
asked, no dialog box presented.
You can rearrange the commands in your Favorites menu easily enough: Just choose Bookmarks
Show All 
Bookmarks (Option-
-B), or click the tiny book icon shown in Figure 20-20. In the resulting organization window, 
drag the bookmarks up and down.
For more dramatic management tasks—to edit, rename, or delete your Favorites, for example—also see Figure 20-
20.
G     Google Search. Here's one of Safari's most profoundly useful features: A Search box that automatically sends your 
search request to Google.com, the world's greatest Web search page. Press Option-
-F to deposit your insertion 
point inside this rounded text box, type something you're looking for—electric curtains, say—and then press Enter. 
Safari takes you directly to the Google results page.
Click the tiny triangle at the left end of the Google bar to produce a pop-up menu of your most 
recent searches.
Bonus Tip:If you Control-click a highlighted word or phrase on a Web page, you can choose 
Google Search from the contextual menu to run a search directly.
G     Bug. Ladies and gentlemen, Apple at its most humble. This insect-shaped button opens a tiny "Dear Apple" box, 
where you can tell Apple about a Safari feature or Web page that wouldn't work. If you click Options, you can even 
opt to send Apple a screen illustration of, for example, a screwy Web-page layout that Safari delivered.

20.5.2.2 Bookmarks bar
The Bookmarks menu is one way to maintain a list of Web sites you visit frequently. But opening a Web page listed in that 
menu requires two mouse clicks—an exorbitant expenditure of energy. The Bookmarks bar (View
Bookmarks Bar), on 
the other hand, lets you summon a few very favorite Web pages with only one click.
Figure 20-20 illustrates how to add buttons to, and remove them from, this toolbar.
As shown in Figure 20-20, you can drag a link from a Web page onto your Bookmarks bar. 
But you can also drag a link directly to the desktop, where it turns into an Internet location file. 
Thereafter to launch your browser and visit the associated Web page, just double-click this 
icon whenever you like.
Better yet, stash a few of these icons in your Dock or Sidebar for even easier access.
Top: Once you've got a juicy Web page on the screen, you can drag its tiny page-logo icon from 
the address bar directly onto the Bookmarks bar.
Second from top: Safari realizes that you may prefer a shorter name to appear on the 
spacelimited bar, so it offers you the chance to type in a label you prefer.
Third from top: When you click OK, the new button appears on the bar, as shown here. (You can 
also drag any link, such as a blue underlined phrase, from a Web page onto the bar—or even an 
icon from your desktop!) To remove a button, drag it off the bar; to rearrange the icons, just 
drag them. 
Bottom: Click the little book icon (circled) to open the Organize Bookmarks window. Here, you 
can drag names up or down to rearrange the list, or drag them into a "folder" that becomes a 
submenu in the Bookmarks menu (create one by clicking the + button below the list). You can 
edit a bookmark by clicking once on its name or URL, or delete one by pressing Delete.

20.5 Safari
The Status bar at the bottom of the window tells you what Safari is doing (such as "Opening page..." or "Done"); when you 
point to a link without clicking, the Status bar also tells you which URL will open if you click it. For those two reasons, it's a 
very useful strip, but it doesn't appear when you first run Safari. You have to summon it by choosing View
Status Bar.
20.5.4 Tips for Better Surfing
Safari is filled with shortcuts and tricks for better speed and more pleasant surfing. For example:
20.5.4.1 SnapBack
The little orange SnapBack button (
 ), at the right end of the address bar or Google search bar, takes you instantly back to 
the Web page whose address you last typed, or whose bookmark you last clicked, or to your first Google results page. The 
point here is that after burrowing from one link to another in pursuit of some Google result or Amazon listing, you can return 
to your starting point without having to mash the Back button over and over again. (The Snapback button doesn't appear 
until you have indeed clicked away from the first page.)
At any time, you can designate your current page as the new SnapBack page, to which all 
subsequent SnapBacks on that site will take you. To do so, choose History
Mark Page 
for SnapBack.
20.5.4.2 Stifle pop-ups and pop-unders
The ad banners at the top of every Web page are annoying enough—but nowadays, they're just the beginning. The world's 
smarmiest advertisers have begun inundating us with pop-up and pop-under ads: nasty little windows that appear in front of 
the browser window, or, worse, behind it, waiting to jump out the moment you close your browser. They're often deceptive, 
masquerading as error messages or dialog boxes; they'll do absolutely anything to get you to click inside them.
If this kind of thing is driving you crazy, choose Safari
Block Pop-Up Windows, so that a checkmark appears next to the 
command. Yes, it's a war out there—but at least you now have some ammunition.
NOTE
This feature doesn't squelch small windows that pop up when you click a link—only windows that appear 
unbidden.
Even these, however, are sometimes legitimate (and not ads)—notices of new banking features, warnings 
that the instructions to use a site have changed, and so on. Be aware that Safari can't tell these from ads, 
and stifles them too.
20.5.4.3 Impersonating Internet Explorer
Sooner or later, you'll run into a Web site that doesn't work in Safari. The reason: When you arrive at a Web site, your 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-5.html (9 of 15)5/3/2004 5:06:50 AM

20.5 Safari
browser identifies itself. That's because many commercial Web sites display a different version of the page depending on 
the browser you're using, thanks to differences in the way various browsers interpret Web layouts.
But because you're using the relatively unknown Safari browser, your otherwise beloved Web site tells you: "Sorry, browser 
not supported."
In such times of trouble, you can make Safari impersonate any other browser, which is often good enough to fool the picky 
Web site into letting you in.
The key to this trick is Safari's Debug menu, which is generally hidden. You can make it appear in either of two ways:
G     Download Safari Enhancer, a free program available on the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com. It 
offers a simple checkbox that turns on the debug menu.
G     Use the Terminal command defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1. (Details on using Terminal in 
Chapter 15.)
When you next open Safari, the new Debug menu appears right next to Help. Most of its commands are designed to appeal 
to programmers, but the one you want—User Agent—is useful indeed. It lets Safari masquerade as a different browser. 
Choose User Agent
Mac MSIE 5.22, for example, to assume the identity of Internet Explorer for Macintosh.
NOTE
Unfortunately, there's a serious dark side to using this User Agent trick. If enough people pretend that they're 
using Internet Explorer, whoever created the Web site will never know how many people are actually using 
Safari—and will never get around to fixing the Web site in the first place.
Whenever you encounter a Web site that gives Safari trouble, therefore, you should also (a) notify Apple of 
the problem and (b) notify the Webmaster of the site you're trying to visit that you want Safari compatibility.
20.5.4.4 Where am I?
As you dig your way down into a Web site, you may wish you could have left a trail of bread crumbs to mark your path. Ah, 
but Safari has already thought of that. As shown in Figure 20-21, you can access a secret menu that shows where you are 
on the Web site, matter how deeply nested your page is. To navigate back, just click the page that you'd like to see. This 
trick works even if you didn't actually burrow here step by step—that is, even if you typed this page's address in its entirety, 
jumping here directly.
If you 
-click the title bar (centered just above the address bar), Safari displays the "ladder" of 
pages you descended to arrive at the current one.

20.5 Safari
 
20.5.4.5 Faster browsing without graphics
Graphics are part of what makes the Web so compelling. But they're also responsible for making Web pages take so long to 
arrive on the screen. Without them, Web pages appear almost instantaneously. You still get fully laid-out Web pages with all 
their text and headlines. But wherever a picture would normally be, you see an empty rectangle containing a generic 
"graphic goes here" logo, usually with a caption explaining what that graphic would have been.
To turn off graphics, choose Safari
Preferences and click the Appearance tab, turn off "Display images when page 
opens," and close the Preferences window. Now try visiting a few Web pages and enjoy the substantial speed boost. (And if 
you wind up on a Web page that's nothing without its pictures, return to Safari
Preferences, turn the same checkbox off, 
and reload the page.)
20.5.4.6 Viewing Web pages offline
You don't have to be connected to the Net to read a favorite Web page. You can save a certain Web page on your hard 
drive so that you can peruse it later—on your laptop during your commute, for example—just by choosing File
Save As.
20.5.4.7 Designate your home page
The first Web site you encounter when Safari connects to the Internet is an Apple Web site. This site is your home page. 
You'll probably find Web browsing more fun if you specify your favorite Web page as your home page.
To do that, navigate your way to the page you prefer. Google, or its news page news.google.com, is a good starting place; 
so is your favorite newspaper home page, or www.macsurfer.com, a summary of the day's Mac news coverage around the 
world, or maybe www.dilbert.com for today's Dilbert cartoon.
Then choose Safari
Preferences, click the General tab, and click Set to Current Page (or type the address into the box).

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Erasing Your Tracks
So, about this History menu: I'd just as soon my wife/husband/ boss/parent/kid not know what Web sites I've 
been visiting. Must that History menu display my movements quite so proudly? 
True, some people find it creepy that Safari maintains a complete list of every Web site they've seen recently, 
right there in plain view of any family member or coworker who wanders by. To erase the History menu, 
choose History
 Clear History.
Of course, the History menu isn't the only place where you've left footprints. If you really want to leave no trace 
of your activities, choose Safari
Reset Safari instead. That command also erases all other shreds of your 
activities: any cookies (Web-page preference files) you've accumulated, your list of past downloads, the cache 
files (tiny Web graphics files on your hard drive that a browser stores to save time when you return to the page 
they came from), and so on. This is good information to know; after all, you might be nominated to the 
Supreme Court some day.
Incidentally, you can also delete just one particularly incriminating History listing. Click the book icon at the left 
end of the Bookmarks bar; in the resulting Bookmarks organizer window, click History. Expand the relevant 
date triangle, highlight the offending address, and then press your Delete key. Click the book icon again to 
return to normal browsing.
You've just rewritten History.
If you can't decide on a home page, or your mood changes from day to day, use the "New windows open with" pop-up menu 
to choose Empty Page. Some people prefer this setup, which makes Safari load very quickly when you first open it. Once 
this empty window opens, then you can tell the browser where you want to go today.
In the Safari
Preferences
General tab, you can also choose Bookmarks. Then, 
whenever you open a new window or launch Safari, you can choose exactly which page you 
want to open by choosing from a tidy list of your bookmarks.
20.5.4.8 Return to the past
The History menu lists the Web sites you've visited in the last week or so, neatly organized into subfolders like "Earlier 
Today" and "Yesterday." (A similar menu appears when you click and hold on the Back or Forward button.) These are great 
features if you can't remember the URL for a Web site that you remember having visited, say, yesterday.
20.5.5 Tabbed Browsing
Beloved by hardcore surfers the world over, tabbed browsing is a way to keep a bunch of Web pages open simultaneously—
in a single, tidy window. Figure 20-22 illustrates.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20T...dition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-20-SECT-5.html (12 of 15)5/3/2004 5:06:50 AM

Turning on tabbed browsing unlocks a whole raft of Safari shortcuts and tricks, which are just the sort of thing power users 
gulp down like Gatorade:
G     If there's a certain set of Web sites you like to visit daily, put their bookmarks into one folder, using the Bookmarks 
organizer window (Figure 20-20). Then you can load all of them at once, into a single tabbed window, by Control-
clicking the
Top: First turn on tabbed browsing in Safari's Preferences
Tabs window. (For best 
results, also turn on "Select new tabs as they are created.")
Bottom: Now, whenever you 
-click a link, or type an address and press 
-Return or 
-Enter, you open a new tab, not a new window as you ordinarily would. You can now 
pop from one open page to another by clicking the tabs just under your Bookmarks bar, 
or close one by clicking its X button (or pressing 
-W).
 
resulting "folder" in the Bookmarks menu and choosing Open in Tabs from the contextual menu.
The beauty of this arrangement is that you can start reading the first Web page while all of the others load into their 
own tabs in the background.

20.5 Safari
Click the book icon at the left end of the Bookmarks bar. In the Bookmarks organizer, click 
the Bookmarks Bar item in the left-side list. Now you can see an Auto-Tab checkbox for each 
listed folder.
If you turn this checkmark on, then you'll be able to open all the bookmarks in that folder into 
tabs, all at once, just by clicking the folder's name in the Bookmarks bar.
G     If you Option-click a tab's X (close) button, you close all tabs except the one you clicked.
G     If you Option-
-click a link, it opens in a separate window, rather than a new tab. (When tabbed browsing is 
turned off, you 
-click a link to open a new window.)
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Cookie Control
Help! I'm afraid of cookies! 
Cookies are something like Web page preference files. Certain Web sites—particularly commercial ones like 
Amazon. com—deposit them on your hard drive like little bookmarks, so that they'll remember you the next 
time you visit. Most cookies are perfectly innocuous —and, in fact, are extremely helpful, because they help 
Web sites remember you. Cookies spare you the effort of having to type in your name, address, credit card 
number, and so on, every single time you visit these Web sites.
But fear is on the march, and the media fans the flames with tales of sinister cookies that track your movement 
on the Web. If you're worried about invasions of privacy, Safari is ready to protect you.
Once the browser is open, choose Safari
Preferences
 Security tab. As you'll see, the buttons in this 
dialog box are like a paranoia gauge. If you click Never, you create an acrylic shield around your Mac. No 
cookies can come in, and no cookie information can go out. You'll probably find the Web a very inconvenient 
place, because you'll have to re-enter your information upon every visit, and some Web sites may not work 
properly.
A good compromise is "Only from sites you navigate to," which accepts cookies from sites you want to visit, 
but blocks cookies deposited on your hard drive by sites you're not actually visiting—cookies an especially evil 
banner ad gives you, for example.
Note, too, the Show Cookies button, which reveals the shockingly complete list of every cookie you've 
accumulated so far—and offers you the chance to delete the ones that don't look quite so savory.

Contents
Resources
English.lproj. Finally, drag the icon called Shortcuts.html right 
into the Safari window.
G     If you Shift-

Chapter 21. SSH, FTP, VPN, and Web Sharing
Email and Web surfing may be the most popular Internet activities, but the world's most gigantic network has many other 
uses. The general idea is always the same, though: letting one computer reach out and touch another.
Mac OS X offers a few features that embrace the more literal aspects of that notion. For example, you can turn your Mac 
into a Web server—an actual living Web site that anyone on the Internet can visit. This chapter also explores various 
advanced methods of manipulating your own Mac from the road, including remote access technologies like long-distance 
file sharing, FTP, SSH, and virtual private networking (VPN).
NOTE
Most of these technologies are designed for full-time Internet connections (cable modem or DSL, for 
example). If you have a dial-up modem, these features work only when you're actually online. Still, they may 
occasionally be useful even when you're not. You could always call up a friend and say, "Check out my Web 
site right now—here's the current IP address" or call someone back home to say, "I have to grab a file off my 
hard drive. Could you make the Mac on my desk go online?"

21.1 Web Sharing
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
21.1 Web Sharing
Using the Sharing panel of System Preferences, you can turn your Mac into a Web site (or server), accessible from the 
Web browsers of people on your office network, the Internet at large, or both.
This feature assumes, of course, that you've already created some Web pages. For this purpose, you can use Web-design 
programs (Macromedia Dreamweaver, for example, or the free Netscape Composer) or the File
Save as Web Page 
command of a program like Microsoft Word. Or you could let Mac OS X build Web pages for you using iPhoto or Image 
Capture.
After you provide your friends and co-workers with your Mac's Web site address, they can view your Web pages, graphics, 
and documents in their own Web browsers. And whenever you're online, your Web site is also available to anyone on the 
Internet—but you don't have to pay a penny to a Web-hosting company.
Web sharing is also an easy and efficient way to share your Mac files with Windows PCs, 
either those on your office network or those on the Internet. No special software or 
translation is required, and posting your files on the Web page avoids all the usual 
complexities of sending files by email.
Don't mistake Mac OS X's Web Sharing feature, by the way, with the relatively feeble equivalent feature in Mac OS 9 or 
Windows, which are designed to handle only a handful of visitors at a time (and can't handle anything fancy like CGI 
scripts). Inside Mac OS X is Apache, one of the strongest and most popular Unix Web server programs—precisely the 
same one that drives 60 percent of the Internet's commercial Web sites.
UP TO SPEED
IP Addresses and You
Every computer connected to the Internet, even temporarily, has its own exclusive IP address (IP stands for 
Internet Protocol). What's yours? Open the Sharing pane of System Preferences to find out (see Figure 21-1). 
As you'll see, an IP address is always made up of four numbers separated by periods.
Some Macs with broadband Internet connections have a permanent, unchanging address called a fixed or 
static IP address. Clearly, life is simpler if you have a fixed IP address, because other computers will always 
know where to find you.
Most other Macs get assigned a new address each time they connect (a dynamic IP address). That's virtually 
always the case, for example, when you connect using a dial-up modem. (If you can't figure out whether your 
Mac has a static or fixed address, ask your Internet service provider.)
You might suppose that Mac fans with dynamic addresses can't use any of the remote-connection 
technologies described in this chapter. After all, your Mac's Web address changes every time you connect, 
making it impossible to provide a single, permanent address to your friends and co-workers.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-21-SECT-1.html (1 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:56 AM

21.1 Web Sharing
The answer is a dynamic DNS service that gives your Mac a name, not a number. Whenever you're online, 
these free services automatically update the IP address associated with the name you've chosen (such as 
macmania.dyndns.org), so that your friends and colleagues can memorize a single address for your machine.
To sign up for one of these services, just go to their Web sites— www.dyndns.org, www.dhs.org, www.dtdns.
com, www.hn.org, www.no-ip.com , and so on.
You'll also need to download and run a utility called an update client, which contacts your DNS service and 
keeps it up to date with your latest IP address, regularly and automatically. Check your DNS service's Web 
site for a list of compatible update clients.
Once you've got a fixed DNS name associated with your Mac, you'll be able to access it from elsewhere 
(provided it's online at the time) via File Sharing (Chapter 12), the screen-sharing program called Timbuktu, 
the Web Sharing and FTP features described in this chapter, and so on.
(If you have a fixed address, you can also pay a few dollars a year to register your own domain name, a bona 
fide address like www.yournamehere.com. To register one—or to find out if the name you want is taken—visit 
a site like www.networksolutions.com .)
The bottom line: If you build it, they won't necessarily come. But you'll have the capacity to handle them if they do.
21.1.1 Firing Up Personal Web Sharing
Here's how you turn your Mac into a low-budget Web site:
1.  Put the HTML documents, graphics, and files you want to publish into your Home
Sites folder. 
Everyone with an account on your Mac has a Sites folder, and therefore the Mac can actually serve up lots of Web 
sites at once.
Your Web site's home page, by the way, must be named index.html. (Apple has already put an index.html 
document into your Sites folder, just to give you the idea; feel free to replace it.)
2.  Open System Preferences; click Sharing. Turn on the Personal Web Sharing checkbox (Figure 21-1). 
Use the Sharing System Preferences pane to make designated folders on your hard drive 
available to anyone on the Internet. Note your Mac's IP address, which appears here in 
blue underlined type. It's the basis for all of the fun Mac-sharing- over-the-Internet 
features described in this chapter.

21.1 Web Sharing
 
You've just made the contents of your Web Pages folder available to anyone who connects to your Mac.
Take this opportunity to turn on Mac OS X's firewall, too (Section 18.5). You wouldn't 
want Internet hoodlums to take advantage of your open Web connection.
3.  Note your IP address. 
In general, your Mac's Web address is based on its IP address (or Network Address). The Mac identifies this 
address for you at the bottom of the Sharing pane (see Figure 21-1).
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-21-SECT-1.html (3 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:56 AM

It might be, for example, http://111.222.3.44/~chris/ (the number is your IP address, and the name should be your 
short user name). Don't forget the final slash. Tell your friends to bookmark it so they won't have to remember this 
address, or use one of the DNS naming services described in Section 21.1.
That IP address with all the numbers is the one that people on the Internet need. If 
they have Mac OS X 10.2 or later, people on your local office network can use your 
Mac's Rendezvous name to connect instead. (To read or change its Rendezvous 
name, open the Sharing pane of System Preferences, and click Edit.)
They could, for example, type http://office-mac.local/~chris into their Web browsers, 
where office-mac.local is your Mac's Rendezvous name.
You've just put your folder-based Web page on the Internet for all to see—that is, all who know your secret Web address. 
Maybe you'll want to distribute the address only to other people on your office network, using your tiny Web site as a 
distribution source for documents. Or maybe you'll want to go whole-hog, hosting an e-commerce Web site (read on).
21.1.2 The Mac's Own Web Site
The instructions above show you how to create a Web site in your Home
Sites folder. In other words, they guide you 
through the process of creating a personal Web site.
But if you have an Administrator account (Chapter 11), you can also put your Web pages into the main hard drive window's 
Library
WebServer
Documents folder. This is your Mac's main Web site folder, and its address is simply 
http://111.222.3.44/. That is, it's just your IP address, no user name needed. (Of course, if you have a DNS name for your 
Web server, you can use that, as well. And here again, if people will be connecting from across your office network rather 
than the Internet, they can replace the IP number with your Mac's Rendezvous name.)
Working with this primary Web site folder is only slightly different from the personal ones described above. Because you're 
now working inside an official Mac OS X system folder, you must mind your privileges (Section 12.2.10). Using the 
File
Get Info command, you should set up the permissions of any folders and documents inside the Library
 
WebServer
Documents folder (an Images folder, for example) like this:
G     Owner: Read & Write
G     Group: Read & Write (or Read Only, if you don't want other administrators to have access)
G     Everyone: Read Only
You've just ensured that your visitors will be allowed to see your Web documents—and that random Internet hoodlums can't

21.1 Web Sharing
make any changes to them.
21.1.3 The Easiest Way to Distribute Files
Here's a handy secret: If there isn't a document whose name is index.html in your Sites folder (or 
Library
WebServer
Documents folder), then visitors see, in their browsers, a handy list of the files that are in that 
folder (see Figure 21-2).
Here's a great way to make files available to other people on your network or collaborators 
across the Internet. Just put your files into the Sites or Library
Web- Server
Documents 
folder and make sure nothing is named index. html. The Parent Directory link takes you to the 
folder that contains this one—if you've been given access to it, that is.
 
This is a terrific convenience: It offers a quick, simple way for you to make a bunch of documents available for downloading. 
All your visitors have to do is click one of these file names. It downloads immediately, no matter what kind of computer your 
Web visitor is using.

21.1 Web Sharing
If one of the files listed is a graphic, like a JPEG or GIF file, it appears right in the browser 
window. Tell your visitors to Alt-click or Option-click the link to download it instead.
21.1.4 Browser Navigation of Your Own Mac
Once you've turned on Web Sharing, you can navigate the folders of your own machine right from within a browser—just 
use localhost as the "Web address."
To see what's in your own Sites folder, for example, type http://localhost/~chris/ (or whatever your short account name is) 
into your browser's address bar. Or to see what's in the Library
WebServer
Documents folder, http://localhost/ is 
all you need.
Actually, in any address that involves the word localhost (like the previous examples), you 
can leave out the word localhost to save a little typing. But keep all the slashes that surround 
it. For example, http:/// is enough to see the list of documents in your Mac's main Web-pages 
folder.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
CGI Scripts
A CGI script (Common Gateway Interface) is a program—written in a language like Perl, AppleScript, or 
Python—that runs right on your Web page. You've seen these on many a Web page: Web-visitor counters, 
interactive polls, shopping forms, and so on. Apple even includes a few of them with Mac OS X; they're in 
your System
Library
Perl
[version number]
CGI Scripts folder, for example.
If you've got a CGI script of your own that you'd like to incorporate into your Web page, copy it into your 
Library
 WebServer
CGI-Executables folder (this means you, administrators). The script's Web 
address becomes http://111.222.3.44/cgi-bin/scriptname. (Substitute your actual IP address and the real 
name of the script file, of course.)
Unfortunately, you won't get far testing out your CGI script, because it comes with its "execute" permissions 
turned off. To turn them on again, you need to use the chmod (change mode) command.
You can use a permission-changing shareware program like SuperGetInfo, available from the "Missing CD" 
page of www.missingmanuals.com , or you can do the job in Terminal, as described in Section 16.1.4. (In this 
case, you'd type sudo chmod 755 test-cgi.)
The chmod command is a quick way to change access privileges—including Execute permission, which isn't 
available in the File
Get Info window.
The 755 business is a long story, which you can read at any Terminal prompt by typing man chmod and 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-21-SECT-1.html (6 of 7)5/3/2004 5:06:56 AM

21.1 Web Sharing
hitting Enter. In short, however, this code is shorthand for "Change the permissions so that everyone else can 
read and execute (but not make changes to) this file"—just what you want for a CGI script.
After hitting Enter, you're ready to proceed. Now sudo asks for your administrator's password. Once you've 
entered it, press Enter; the deed is done. You can test your script either on the same Mac (http://localhost/cgi-
bin/test-cgi) or on another one across the network or across the Internet
But why stop at HTML documents? You can see the contents of any folder on your Mac, just by typing its folder pathname. 
For example, to see what's in your Documents folder, type file:///Users/chris/Documents/ into your browser's Address bar. 
You get a tidy list like the one shown in Figure 21-2, revealing what's in that folder. Click a link to open it. (If you're using 
Safari, you open a Finder window revealing the folder's contents instead.)
21.1.5 More on Apache
As noted above, Apache is the most popular Web-serving software in the world. As you can well imagine, it's powerful, 
reliable—and very technical. It is, after all, a Unix program.
You can read more at any of these sources:
G     The Apache manual. To open it up, type http://localhost/manual/ into your browser's address bar. You won't get 
far reading this thing if you haven't spent some time at a technical college, but at least you'll know what you're up 
against.
G     Apache: The Definitive Guide. A book from O'Reilly.
G     MacOSXHints.com. Dozens of Mac OS X fans have posted specific Apache-tweaking tips and ticks at www.
macosxhints.com .
Note, too, that $350 will buy you a graphic front end for the various Apache settings, in the form of Tenon's iTools program 
(no relation to Apple's old iTools service). It still requires an understanding of the technical aspects of Web hosting, but at 
least it spares you from having to type out Unix commands to make your changes.

21.2 FTP
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
21.2 FTP
FTP sites (file transfer protocol) store pieces of software that can be accessed from the Internet. If you've heard of FTP at 
all, it was probably under one of two circumstances—either you've downloaded software from an Internet FTP site, or 
you've created and maintained your own Web site.
21.2.1 Uploading and Downloading from FTP Sites
Hooking into an FTP site generally requires an FTP client program that runs on the kind of computer you use (Mac, 
Windows, or whatever). On Mac OS X, popular FTP client programs include the shareware programs Fetch, Interarchy, and 
Captain FTP, and the free RBrowser Lite (which is available from the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com ).
Using these programs, Web designers, for example, can view a list of all the text and graphics documents, sitting there on 
an Internet-connected computer somewhere, that make up their Web pages. When they want to update one of those 
pages, they add it to this list; to delete a Web page, they remove it from this list.
21.2.2 Just Downloading from FTP Sites
If you're just going to look at and download files (but not upload or delete any), you don't even need a special FTP program 
like Fetch. You can get to the files much more directly using one of these two methods:
G     Any old Web browser will work. Open Internet Explorer, for example, and type ftp.apple.com (or whatever the 
address is) into the address bar. A dialog box asks for an account name and password, if they're required. Once 
you're in, you see a list of everything on the FTP server, displayed much like the list shown in Figure 21-2.
NOTE
Safari works slightly differently. Instead of presenting a list of files, it switches to the Finder and 
presents the contents of the FTP site as a window full of standard file icons.
G     Using the Finder's Go
Connect to Server command, you can mount read-only FTP volumes right on your 
desktop, much like a public iDisk.
In the Connect to Server dialog box, just enter the address of the FTP server you would like to mount- ftp.apple.
com , for example. You'll soon see the ftp.apple. com icon appear on your desktop just like your other disks. Open 
it up and drag out whatever you want to download.
Top: To access your Mac OS X machine from across the Internet, fire up RBrowser Lite and use 
the address ftp://111.222.33.4 (or whatever your IP address is). Be sure the first pop-up menu 
says FTP, not Public FTP—otherwise, you won't be offered the chance to type in your account 
name and password.
Bottom: Once you're looking at an FTP server's contents, you can drag files from your desktop 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-21-SECT-2.html (1 of 2)5/3/2004 5:06:58 AM

into the list. Copy them to your Mac by dragging them out of the list onto your desktop, or open 
them by double-clicking.
 
21.2.3 Becoming an FTP Server
Thanks to Mac OS X and its Wonder Unix, you can also turn your own Mac into an FTP site. Once again, the key is the 
Sharing pane of System Preferences; this time, just turn on the FTP Access checkbox.
Once again, the key to your own Mac is its IP address, as shown at the bottom of the System Preferences pane. At this 
point, you, or other people you trust, can connect to your FTP server by running an FTP program like RBrowser (see Figure 
21-3) or just typing ftp://111.222.33.4 into their Web browsers.

21.3 Connecting from the Road
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
21.3 Connecting from the Road
You can also connect to your Mac's regular File Sharing feature (Chapter 12) from over the Internet. This feature is a 
blessing to anyone who travels, whether with a laptop or to a branch office, because you'll never be up the creek without a 
paddle if you discover that you left an important file at home.
To connect over the Internet, make sure that you've set up the home-base Mac for file sharing, as directed in Chapter 12. 
Then, once you're on the road, go online and proceed like this:
1.  Choose Go
Connect to Server. 
The Connect to Server dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-4.
The Connect to Server dialog box lets you type in the IP address for the shared Mac to 
which you want access. (Ensuring that the shared Mac is turned on and connected to the 
Internet is the network administrator's problem.)
 
2.  Type in the IP address (or domain name) of the Mac to which you want to connect, and then click Connect 
(or press Enter). 
If you don't know the shared Mac's IP address, pick up the phone and call somebody in the office there. That 
person can find out the shared Mac's IP address by opening the Network pane (or Sharing pane) of System 
Preferences.
And if you've signed up for a DNS naming service as described in Section 21.1, you can type your Mac's domain

name instead.
3.  Enter your name and password, and then click Connect. 
From here, it's just as though you were connecting to another computer on your office network (Section 12.2.3), 
although it's a good bit slower. But when you're in Hong Kong and need a document from your Mac in Minneapolis, 
you may not care.

21.4 Remote Access with SSH
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
21.4 Remote Access with SSH
Are you a geek? Take this simple test at home. Do you get excited about Mac OS X's ability to permit SSH access?
If you answered "What's SSH?" or "I'm already being quiet," then the following discussion of Unix remote control may not 
interest you. To be sure, SSH is not a program with a graphic user interface (icons and menus). You operate it from within a 
program like Terminal by typing commands, exactly as described in Chapter 15.
If you're willing to overlook that little peccadillo, though, SSH (Secure Shell) is an extremely powerful tool. It lets you 
connect to your Mac from anywhere—from across the network or across the Internet. And once you're connected, you can 
take complete control of it, copying files, running commands, rearranging folders, or even shutting it down, all by remote 
control.
21.4.1 Getting In
Here's how you go about using SSH:
1.  Set up your Mac by opening the Sharing panel of System Preferences, and then turning on the Remote 
Login checkbox. 
You've just told the Mac it's OK for you (or other people with accounts on your machine) to connect from the road. 
Quit System Preferences.
2.  Go away. 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Connecting Through a Router
I want to connect to my home network from the road. Trouble is, I have a router that shares my 
broadband modem with a bunch of Macs. How do I get into one specific Mac? It doesn't really have a 
"real" IP address, because the router is sharing the cable modem's signal! 
It's possible—just complicated.
Most home broadband routers offer a feature called port forwarding, in which signals intended for a 
specific port (Section 18.4) on the router (port 22 for ssh, for example) get passed on to whichever 
computer on the network you've designated to receive it. (You specify this using the router's 
management software.) You can specify a different machine for different ports: all port-80 
communications goes to one machine doing Web serving, for example; all 548 goes to another 
machine doing file sharing, and so on.
Even if you're enough of a technical mastermind to set up this port-forwarding business, however, you 
still won't be able to access two different machines using the same port. For some services, including 
ssh and Timbuktu, you can work around this limitation by logging into the machine specified for port 
forwarding, and then from that machine, log into the others on the rest of the network.

21.4 Remote Access with SSH
You can move to another machine on the network, or another computer on the Internet. Once you're online with 
that other machine, you can contact your homebase machine from within a program like Terminal.
It doesn't have to be Terminal, and it doesn't have to be a Mac. You can get SSH 
client programs for almost any kind of computer, including Windows and Mac OS 9.
For pre-Mac OS X Macs, for example, you can try MacSSH or NiftyTelnet SSH, both 
of which you can download from www.missingmanuals.com . To find SSH programs 
for Windows, visit www.versiontracker.com , click the Windows tab, and search for 
SSH.
3.  At the $ prompt, type ssh -l chris 111.222.3.44 . Press Enter. 
Instead of chris, substitute your short account name (as you're known on the Mac you're tapping into), and replace 
the phony IP address shown here with your real one. (If your Mac back home has a domain name unto itself, such 
as macmania.com, you can type that instead of the IP address.)
If all goes well, the ssh command acknowledges your first successful connection by displaying a message like this: 
"The authenticity of host '172.24.30.189 (172.24.30.189)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is d9:f4:11:
b0:27:1a: f1: 14:c3:cd:25:85:2b:78:4d:e7. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?" (This message 
won't appear on subsequent connections.) You're seeing SSH's security features at work.
4.  Type yes and press Enter. 
Now you see one more note: "Warning: Permanently added '172.24.30.189' (RSA) to the list of known hosts." 
You're then asked for your account password.
5.  Type your account password and press Enter. 
You're in. Issue whatever commands you want. You can now conduct a full Unix Terminal session as described in 
Chapters 15 and 16—but by remote control.
For a list of options you can use in SSH, type ssh at the prompt (nothing more) and press 
Enter.

21.4 Remote Access with SSH
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Where Did Telnet Go?
How do I telnet into my Mac OS X machine? 
telnet and ssh are very similar in concept. But the problem with telnet is that it's more susceptible to hackers.
The ssh networking program, on the other hand, is extremely secure, immune to all kinds of the hacker 
attacks you may have read about: IP spoofing, IP source writing, DNS spoofing, and so on. That's why Apple 
replaced its telnet feature with ssh beginning in Mac OS X 10.1.
Apple also hopes that Unix-savvy Mac fans will recognize ssh to be a superior replacement for such remote 
control Unix programs as rlogin, rsh, and rcp (via scp), for that matter.
21.4.2 Remote Control Program Killing
One of the most common uses of SSH is quitting a stuck program. Maybe it's a program that doesn't respond to the usual 
Force Quit commands—maybe even the Finder or Terminal. Or maybe, having just arrived in Accounting on the fifth floor, 
you realize that you accidentally left your Web browser, open to Dilbert.com, up on your screen in clear view of passersby.
In any case, you'd fire up Terminal and proceed like this (what you type is shown in bold; responses are in normal type):
home-mac:~ chris$ ssh 172.24.30.182
The authenticity of host '172.24.30.182 (172.24.30.182)' can't
be established. RSA key fingerprint is d9:f4:11:b0:27:1a:f1:14:
c3:cd:25:85:2b:78:4d:e7.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '172.24.30.182' (RSA) to the list of
known hosts.

As you can see, the Finder is process number 283. If that's the stuck program, then, you could quit it like so:
office-mac:~ chris$ kill 283
Or if you're sure of the program's exact name, just use the killall command with the program's name instead of its process 
ID. To handle a stuck Finder, you would type this:
office-mac:~ chris$ killall Finder
Either way, the Finder promptly quits (and relaunches in a healthier incarnation, you hope). You could also, at this point, 
type shutdown -h now to make your Mac, elsewhere on the network, shut down. (Terminal doesn't type any kind of 
response.)
If you ended your SSH session by shutting down the other Mac, you can just close the Terminal window now. Otherwise, 
type exit to complete your SSH session.

21.5 Virtual Private Networking
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
21.5 Virtual Private Networking
After reading the previous pages, you might assume that it's a piece of cake for business people to connect to their 
corporate networks across the Internet from wherever they happen to be: their homes, hotel rooms, or local Starbucks. But 
even though the steps on the preceding pages work fine if you're dialing into your home machine, they'll probably fail 
miserably when you want to connect to a corporate network. There's one enormous obstacle in your way: Internet security.
The typical corporate network is guarded by a team of steely-eyed administrators for whom Job Number One is preventing 
access by unauthorized visitors. They perform this job primarily with the aid of a super-secure firewall that seals off the 
company's network from the Internet.
So how can you tap into the network from the road? One solution is to create a hole in the firewall for each authorized user
—software that permits incoming Internet traffic only from specified IP addresses like your Mac's. Unfortunately, this setup 
isn't bulletproof, security-wise. It's also a pain for administrators to manage.
Another solution: You could dial directly into the corporate network, modem-to-modem. That's plenty secure, but it 
bypasses the Internet, and therefore winds up being expensive. (Want proof? Try this simple test: Make a call from the 
Tokyo Hilton to the Poughkeepsie Sheet Metal home office. Have a look at your hotel bill when you check out.)
Fortunately, there's a third solution that's both secure and cheap: the Virtual Private Network, or VPN. Running a VPN 
allows you to create a super-secure "tunnel" from your Mac, across the Internet, and straight into your corporate network. 
All data passing through this tunnel is heavily encrypted; to the Internet eavesdropper, it looks like so much undecipherable 
gobbledygook.
And it's cheap—whether you're accessing the Internet via your home DSL, a local ISP number from a hotel, or wirelessly 
from your stool at Starbucks.
Remember, though, that VPN is a corporate tool, run by corporate nerds. You can't use this improved Mac OS X 10.3 
feature without these pieces in place:
G     A VPN server. This is a big deal. If your tech department tells you they don't have one, then that's that—no 
tunneling for you.
If they do have one, then you'll need to know the type of server it is. Mac OS X's VPN software can connect to VPN 
servers that speak PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over the 
IP Security Protocol), both relatives of the PPP language spoken by modems. Most corporate VPN servers work 
with at least one of these protocols.
You'll also need to know the Internet address of your VPN server (for example, vpn.ferrets-r-us.com).
G     An account on the remote network that allows VPN access. Your remote network can be set up in many 
different ways, but in every case, you'll still need to confirm with your network administrator that your account on it 
allows VPN access.
G     All necessary account information. Make sure you have all the scraps of connection information you'll need to 
dial in. That would include your user (account) name, at the very least. You may also need an NT Domain name; 
VPN servers are often part of Microsoft Windows NT networks, which won't let you in until you know this domain 
name.
Some networks also may require that you type in the currently displayed password on an RSA SecurID card, 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-CHP-21-SECT-5.html (1 of 4)5/3/2004 5:07:06 AM

which your administrator will provide. This James Bondish, credit card-like thing displays a password that changes 
every few seconds, making it rather difficult for hackers to learn "the" password. (If your network doesn't require a 
SecurID card, you'll need a standard password instead.)
Finally, if your office offers L2TP connections, you'll need yet another password called a Shared Secret to ensure 
that the server you're connecting to is really the server that you intend to connect to.
21.5.1 Making the VPN Connection
Once you know everything's in place, you connect to the corporate network as follows:
1.  Connect to the Internet. 
Connect the way you normally do—via cable modem, DSL, office network, modem, AirPort, or whatever.
2.  Open Internet Connect. 
It's in your Applications folder.
3.  Click the VPN toolbar button (Figure 21-5). 
The Mac asks you to choose either L2TP or PPTP. Find out which system your company's network uses, and then 
proceed.
4.  Click L2TP or PPTP, and then click Continue. 
The toolbar icon's name will then change to reflect your choice. (If you ever need to use the other protocol, choose 
File
New VPN Connection; you'll be prompted to choose again.)
You're on your way to joining the corporate network—from thousands of miles away. 
Virtual private networking is ideal for the paranoid (because it's very secure) and the 
cheap (because you're using the Internet as a giant wire connecting you to your home).

21.5 Virtual Private Networking
 
5.  Enter the VPN server address, your VPN account name, and your password. Click Connect. 
If you need to enter a SecurID password or shared secret, click the Configuration pop-up menu, choose Edit 
configurations, and type them into the configuration sheet.
If all goes well, several status messages go by. The last one says, "Connected To" and gives the IP address of the 
network equipment you've reached out and touched.
At this point, you're connected to the corporate network. You can perform the same network-related tasks you 
could if you were actually in that office: check your email, view internal corporate Web pages, access internal FTP 
servers, make printouts on laser printers thousands of miles away, and so on.
You generally can't browse things, though. That is, depending on your network, you might not be able to click the 
Network icon in your Sidebar to view a list of the other computers on the office network, or open Printer Setup 
Utility to see a list of networked printers.
In this case, to access these services, you must know their IP addresses. For example, to connect to a shared 
folder on another computer, choose Go
Connect to Server, type its network address, and press Enter.
To connect to a shared folder on a Windows machine, the address looks like this: 
smb://111.222.33.4/sales-docs. Of course, you'd substitute the correct IP address for 
the dummy one shown here, and insert the actual name of the shared folder. (You 
can also use its DNS name instead of the IP address, if you know it, like this: smb://
big-blue-server.ferret-lan.com/sales-docs.)

21.5 Virtual Private Networking
Classic programs can use your VPN connection, too.
6.  When you're finished accessing the remote network, return to Internet Connect. In the VPN Connection 
window, click Disconnect. 
Once you're finished with the tunnel, it's a good idea to close it, if only because accessing other Web sites can be 
very slow while you're connected to the VPN.
Turning on "Show VPN status in menu bar" adds a VPN menulet to your menu bar, giving 
you a quick way to start and stop subsequent connections.
21.5.2 The Fine Points of VPN
For all the wonders of VPN, here are some possible complications:
G     If you're using a router at home (a little box that shares one cable modem or DSL box with several computers), it 
might not be able to handle the tunneling protocols, or it might not have that feature turned on. Check the router's 
manual, or ask its manufacturer for more information.
For example, the first-generation (silver) AirPort base stations can't handle VPNs at all. Neither do the second-
generation, white models unless you've upgraded to version 2.0.4 or later of the Airport software. (The current, 
AirPort Extreme base stations work with VPNs just fine.)
G     If the corporate network doesn't seem to like your name and password, you might need to add your NT domain 
name and a backwards slash to the beginning of your account name (like this: dom01\msmith) before trying again.
If you're able to make the connection, but experiencing trouble reaching services by their DNS names (for example, 
big-blue-server.com), your Mac could be having difficulty finding the right DNS server. Working with your network 
administrator, open the Network pane of System Preferences. From the Show pop-up menu, choose the correct 
VPN interface (PPTP or L2TP); enter the desired DNS server addresses in the DNS Servers box. Click Apply Now, 
and then try the VPN connection again.
G     If you're still having problems using the VPN, look at the logs (automatically kept technical records) for clues to 
share with your network administrator. To view these records, open Internet Connect and choose 
Window
Connection Log.

Appendix A. Installing Mac OS X 10.3
If your computer came with Mac OS X 10.3 already installed on it, you can skip this appendix—for now. But if you're 
running an earlier version of the Mac OS and want to savor the Panther experience, this appendix describes how to install 
the new operating system on your Mac.

A.1 Getting Ready to Install
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
A.1 Getting Ready to Install
For starters, you need to make sure that you and your Mac have what it takes to handle Mac OS X—specifically:
G     A Macintosh that came with a G3, G4, or G5 processor. In other words, a Power Mac G3 (but not the old beige 
ones), Power Mac G4, or Power Mac G5; an iMac or eMac; a PowerBook G3 (except the very first model, the one 
bearing a six-color Apple logo) or PowerBook G4; or an iBook. (According to Apple, Macs with G3 or G4 upgrade 
cards don't qualify.) You can bend the rules a little, however; see the box on the next page.
G     Plenty of free hard disk space.You need at least 2 GB free to install the full Mac OS X—more if you install the 
Developer Tools, less if you decline to install the full 1 GB of printer drivers (more on this in a moment). 
G     A lot of memory. Remember that when you use Mac OS X, you may sometimes have to run Mac OS 9 (in the 
form of the Classic simulator) simultaneously. One modern operating system takes a lot of RAM; two of them 
require even more. Apple recommends at least 128 MB of memory, but Mac OS X absolutely loves memory. For 
the greatest speed, install 256 MB, 512 MB, or more if you can afford it (and these days, you probably can).
G     The latest version of Mac OS 9. Once again, Mac OS X and Mac OS 9 will be coexisting on the same computer. 
You'll have the best luck if you upgrade your copy of Mac OS 9 (version 9.2.2, which Apple says is the final 
version) before installing Mac OS X.
G     The latest firmware. Firmware describes the low-level, underlying software instructions that control the actual 
circuitry of your Mac. Every now and then, Apple updates it for certain Mac models, and it's very important that your 
Mac has the absolute latest. The Software Update control panel of Mac OS 9 is supposed to alert you automatically 
when such updates become available. (These updates are also available for download at www.apple.com/support/
downloads, of course.)
All that, believe it or not, is the easy part. The more difficult part is assessing whether or not you'll actually be happy in 
Panther. Are the programs you use available in Mac OS X versions? Will your scanner and printer work? As noted in 
Chapter 5, you want to minimize returning to Mac OS 9 just to run some program or piece of add-on equipment that hasn't 
yet been adapted for Mac OS X.
A.1.1 The Partitioning Question
In the coming months and years, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble and time if you keep Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X on two 
different drives. This kind of setup offers several advantages:
G     It's much easier to switch between the two operating systems at startup time. (You may hear this feature called 
dual booting. )
G     Troubleshooting Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X is much easier.
G     You don't have to see, and try to distinguish, your Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X folders all mixed together in the single 
hard drive window (two Applications folders, two System folders, and so on).

A.1 Getting Ready to Install
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Installing Mac OS X on Forbidden Macs
Apple says that you can't install Mac OS X except on models with G3, G4, or G5 processors. The truth is a 
little bit more complicated: The Mac OS X installer doesn't run on any models except those, but Mac OS X 
itself can indeed be made to work. All you need is a patch to make the installer work, and a few pieces of 
software in the System folder.
That's exactly the point of XPostFacto, a free program that lets Mac OS X operate on certain pre-G3 
Macintosh models, including these: Macintosh 7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500, 9600, and certain clones 
(Umax S900 and J700, and Power Computing PowerWave and PowerTower Pro).
There are a few glitches along the way; for example, you can't reboot into Mac OS 9.2 (although you can use 
it for Classic). For rebooting purposes, pretty much the only solution is to keep a separate partition with Mac 
OS 9.1 on it.
Even so, if your Mac has enough speed and memory, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to enjoy 
Mac OS X and all the cool new programs that run only on it. Just don't call Apple asking for technical support.
You can download XPostFacto (and get your questions answered) at eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter 
The easy and expensive way to achieve this happiness is, of course, to install Mac OS X on a second hard drive (like an 
iPod).
Fortunately, there's also a free method: partitioning your Mac's main hard drive—dividing its surface so that it shows up on 
your desktop with two different icons and two different names. You can keep Mac OS 9 on one, and Mac OS X on the 
other. Now you can live like a king, enjoying all the advantages of people who have two separate hard drives.
Unfortunately, partitioning your hard drive requires first erasing it completely. And that, of course, involves copying all of 
your files and programs onto some kind of backup disk first—and then copying them back onto the hard drive when the 
process is over. Ponder this compromise, weighing it against the advantages of partitioning.
If you decide that all that backing up, erasing, and copying is too much hassle to merit the payoff, no harm done. It's 
perfectly OK to install Mac OS X right onto your Mac OS 9 hard drive. You'll find instructions for both methods in the coming 
pages.
NOTE
You may have to partition your hard drive if you have certain older Mac models: a PowerBook that lacks USB 
jacks, a beige Power Mac G3, or an iMac with a CD tray. If your Mac model is one of these, here's the 
strange little footnote to the installation instructions: you must install Mac OS X onto a partition that's "within" 
the first 8 GB of the disk. If your hard drive is smaller than 8 GB as it is, never mind—you don't have to 
partition. If it's larger, however, run Disk Utility as described below to create smaller partitions. 
A.1.2 How to Partition
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-A-SECT-1.html (2 of 3)5/3/2004 5:07:13 AM

A.1 Getting Ready to Install
If you decide to partition your drive, on the other hand, here's how to do it:
1.  Back up everything worth preserving. 
Burn it onto CDs, copy it onto another Mac over the network, email it to yourself, whatever it takes—just remember 
that you're about to erase the hard drive completely.
2.  Insert the Mac OS X CD. Double-click the Install Mac OS X icon. Click the Restart button. 
Your Mac restarts, booting up from the Mac OS X CD. After a moment, the Installer screen appears. However, you 
don't want to install Mac OS X just now, so don't click Continue.
3.  Choose Installer 
 Open Disk Utility. 
The Disk Utility program opens.
4.  Click the Partition tab. Partition your hard drive as shown in Figure 9-28 (which appears in Section 
9.25.13.1 ). 
Actually, you can create more than two partitions, if you see any value in it.
How do you decide how big to make the partitions? If you expect to use your Mac OS 
9 System Folder primarily as the basis of your Classic environment (see Chapter 5), 
its partition can be fairly small, maybe 2 GB or so. Particularly if you're an iMovie fan, 
give the Mac OS X partition as much space as you can, so your DV files will have 
somewhere to go.
If you expect to restart your Mac in Mac OS 9 quite a bit, however (if indeed your Mac 
model can do that), you may want to divide the hard drive roughly in half, so that 
you'll have plenty of room no matter which operating system you're using.
5.  Click OK. In the warning box, click Partition. 
Now you've done it. Disk Utility erases your hard drive and divides it into the number of partitions you've specified. 
When the progress bar disappears, choose Disk Utility
Quit Disk Utility. You arrive at the first Mac OS X 
installer screen; skip to step 3, below.

A.2 Four Kinds of Installation
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
A.2 Four Kinds of Installation
The Mac OS X installer can perform a number of different installations. For example, it can put a copy of Mac OS X 10.3 
onto a hard drive that currently has:
G     Nothing on it. If you one day have to erase your hard drive completely—because it's completely hosed, or, less 
drastically, because you've bought a new, empty external hard drive—this is how to do it. See "The Basic 
Installation," below, for a step-by-step guide.
G     Mac OS 9 on the hard drive. Also see "The Basic Installation" below for a step-by-step explanation.
G     Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.2. The 10.3 installer can turn your older copy of Mac OS X into the 10.3 version, in the 
process maintaining all of your older preferences, fonts, documents, accounts, and so on. See "The Upgrade 
Installation" in Section A.4 
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
The Panther "Up to Date" Upgrade Disk
When you buy Panther from a store, you get the installer described on these pages—the one capable 
of performing either an Upgrade installation or an "Archive and Install" (that is, a clean install).
You may have received a different set of CDs, however, thanks to Apple's Software Up-to-Date 
program. (That's where you pay only $20 or so for the upgrade—an consolation prize offered to 
people who bought a new Mac only a few weeks before a major new Mac OS X version comes out.) 
You'll know if you have this set, because Disc 1 bears the label Upgrade Disc.
Trouble is, there's no Archive and Install option when you run this installer. After all, these discs are 
intended to upgrade the copy of Mac OS X that's already on your new Mac.
That doesn't mean, though, that you can't perform a clean install at all. If you use the Erase and Install 
option, you do indeed get a clean installation of Panther. You'll have to re-create your accounts and 
settings, but at least you'll wind up with the considerable stability benefits of a clean installation.
On the other hand, a substantial body of evidence (specifically, hundreds of moaning Mac fans online) points to the 
wisdom of performing a clean install, described next, rather than an upgrade installation. (Apple calls this the 
"Archive and Install" option.) A clean installation provides a healthier, more glitch-proof copy of 10.3. See "The 
Clean Install" in Section A.5 
G     Mac OS X 10.3. In times of dire troubleshooting, when nothing in Appendix B has helped, you can actually give 
yourself a fresh copy of 10.3, even though 10.3 is already on the hard drive. See "The Clean Install" in Section A.5

A.3 The Basic Installation
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
A.3 The Basic Installation
The installation process takes about an hour, but for the sake of your own psyche, you'll probably want to set aside a whole 
afternoon. Once the installation is over, you'll want to play around, organize your files, and learn the lay of the land.
A.3.1 Phase 1: The Installer
Here's how you install Mac OS X 10.3 onto a drive that doesn't have a version of Mac OS X on it already:
1.  Insert the Mac OS X CD. Double-click the Install Mac OS X icon in the CD's main window. When the Restart 
button appears, click it. 
The Mac starts up from the CD and takes you directly to the first Installer screen.
The installer will soon fall into a pattern: Read the instructions, make a couple choices, and click Continue to 
advance to the next screen. As you go, the list on the left side of the screen reveals where you are in the overall 
procedure.
You can back out of the installation at any time before step 6, just by choosing 
Installer
Quit Installer. When the Quit button appears, click it. Then eject the Mac 
OS X CD, either by holding down the mouse button while the computer restarts or, if 
you have a tray-loading CD drive, by pushing its eject button during the moment of 
darkness during the restart.
2.  Work your way through the Select Language, Welcome, Important Information, and Software License 
Agreement screens, clicking Continue each time. 
Important Information duplicates the Read Me file. The Software License Agreement requires you to click a button 
confirming that you agree with whatever Apple's lawyers say.
3.  On the Select a Destination screen, click the disk or partition on which you want to install Mac OS X. 
Icons for all of your disks (or partitions) appear on the screen, but ones that are off-limits to Mac OS X (like CDs 
and USB hard drives) appear dimmed, if at all.
Click the icon of the drive—or the partition, if you've created one to hold Mac OS X—that will be your new main 
startup drive.
NOTE
If a yellow, triangular exclamation point logo appears on a drive, it probably has a newer version of Mac 
OS X 10.3 on it. (Click it and read the message at the bottom of the dialog box to find out.) That's the 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-A-SECT-3.html (1 of 3)5/3/2004 5:07:18 AM

A.3 The Basic Installation
case if you're trying to do a clean install from a 10.3 CD, but you already have 10.3.1 on the hard drive, 
for example. No problem; you should be reading "The Clean Install" instructions in Section A.5 anyway.
4.  Click Continue. 
You arrive at the Easy Install screen. The easiest way to proceed here is to click Install. But you can save a few 
hundred megabytes of disk space if you take the time to click Customize.
The Installer shows you a list of the various chunks that constitute Mac OS X. A few of them are easily 
dispensable. For example, if you turn off Additional Asian Fonts, Language Translations (for Japanese, German, 
French, and so on), and the printer models that you don't own, you save a staggering 1.1 gigabytes. It's like getting 
a whole mini-hard drive for free (ka-ching!).
5.  Click Install. 
Now you're in for a 45-minute wait as the Installer copies software onto your hard drive.
6.  When the Mac restarts and the first CD pops out, insert Disc 2. When that's done, insert Disc 3, if you're 
asked for it. 
Whether or not the third disc is required depends on which installation options you chose. Each time, the installer 
picks up right from where it left off.
When the installer's finished, you see a message indicating that your Mac will restart in 30 seconds. If you haven't 
wandered off to watch TV, click the Restart button to end the countdown and get on with it.
Mac OS X 10.3 is now installed on your Mac—but you're not quite ready to use it yet. See "The Setup Assistant" in Section 
A.6. 
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Mix-and-Match Help files
One typical problem that can result from an Upgrade install (rather than a clean install) is that your Help 
Viewer program presents a scrambled mix of old and new Help screens. For example, you'll find help pages 
that refer to Key Caps, which doesn't exist in Mac OS X 10.3, but no reference to Font Book, which does.
The quick fix: Quit the Help Viewer program. Open your Home
Library
Caches
com.apple.helpui 
folder, and throw away the Mac Help folder inside. Next time you open your Help program, you'll find only up-
to-date Panther information.

This kind of installation doesn't give you certain categories of extra Mac OS X software: fonts for Asian 
languages, additional speech voices, Common Access Card Viewer (security-card reading software primarily

A.4 The Upgrade Installation
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
A.4 The Upgrade Installation
If Mac OS X version 10.0 through 10.2-point-anything is on your hard drive, the Mac OS X 10.3 installer can neatly nip and 
tuck its software code, turning it into version 10.3. Everything remains just as you had it: your accounts, folders, files, email, 
network settings, everything-else settings, and so on.
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Journaling
If you decide to erase your hard drive before installing Panther, you're offered a choice of two formats for your 
hard drive: "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" and "Unix file System." If you choose the first option, you turn on 
a special, background feature of OS X known as file journaling.
When file journaling is turned on, your Mac keeps a personal diary of everything you do on your hard drive-
opening, saving, deleting files, and so on. Journaling offers two benefits: a shorter startup time and safety in 
the event of a crash.
Here's how it works: When you press the power button, Mac OS X checks to see whether your computer was 
shut down properly (by choosing 
Shut Down for example,instead of just pulling out the plug).
If you didn't shut down properly, Mac OS X examines your hard drive the next time you start up to see if it 
needs repair.It has to scan the whole drive-which can take anywhere from a couple of minutes (if your hard 
drive is less than 10 GB) to a couple of hours (if your hard drive is more than 200 GB). Thanks to file 
journaling, however, Panther can tell what was happening when your computer shut down-and therefore 
spend a lot less time checking your hard drive.
There are some downsides to the journaled format, however. first, this procedure doesn't actually recover 
what you were working on when your Mac shut down; it can only try to keep files you already saved from 
getting corrupted. Second, file journaling can make it take slightly longer for your programs to save files.
Third, and perhaps most importantly, the journaled format is still relatively new. If your hard drive gets 
seriously damaged and your disk-repair program isn't compatible with file journaling, you could end up 
damaging your drive even more.
Mac OS X doesn't prevent you from having different hard drives with different formats, either. You can use the 
journaled format on your main hard drive, but not on your external fireWire drive—or vice versa. (If you ever 
want to change the format of one of your disks, use Disk Utility, although you'll have to erase all the 
information on the disk first.)
If you leave your Mac on all the time (if you run it as a Web server, for example), it's a good idea to use the 
journaled hard drive format. Keep in mind, too, that blackouts affect your hard drive just as much as pulling 
the plug. So if you live in Iraq, a solar-powered house, or anywhere else where power is inconsistent, 
journaling can be a lifesaver.

A.4 The Upgrade Installation
As noted earlier, this sophisticated surgery occasionally leaves behind a minor glitch here and there: peculiar cosmetic 
glitches, a checkbox that doesn't seem to work, and so on. If that possibility concerns you, a clean install is a safer way to 
go. (A clean install does, however, require a little more post-installation fiddling to reinstate your settings, notably your 
Internet and network preferences.)
If you're still game to perform the upgrade installation, follow the preceding steps 1 through 4. On the Select Destination 
screen, however, click Options.
Now you're offered four variations of the basic installation. The one you want is Upgrade Mac OS X. Click it and then click 
OK. Proceed with the previous step 5. (The button described there now says Upgrade, though, instead of Install.)

A.5 The Clean Install
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
A.5 The Clean Install
In Mac OS 9 and Windows, the clean install is considered an essential troubleshooting technique. It entails installing a 
second System Folder or Windows folder—a fresh one, uncontaminated by the detritus left behind by you and your 
software programs.
In general, though, you and your software can't invade the Mac OS X System folder. The kind of gradual corruption that 
could occur in those older operating systems is theoretically impossible in Mac OS X, and therefore the need to perform a 
clean install is almost completely eliminated.
That's the theory, anyway. In fact, somehow or other, things do go wrong with your Mac OS X installation. Maybe you or 
somebody else has been fiddling around in Terminal and wound up deleting or changing some important underlying files. 
Certain shareware programs can perform deep-seated changes like this, too.
The point is that eventually, you may wish you could just start over with a new, perfect copy of Mac OS X. And now, thanks 
to the clean install ("Archive and Install") option, you can—without having to erase the hard drive first, as you did in earlier 
Mac OS X versions.
Start by following the preceding steps 1 through 4. On the Select Destination screen, though, click Options.
Now you're offered four kinds of installation. Turn on "Archive and Install." ("Preserve Users and Network Settings" should 
be on, too.)
This powerful option leaves all of your accounts (Home folders, documents, pictures, movies, Favorites, email, and so on) 
untouched. As the option's name implies, it also leaves your network and Internet settings alone. But it deactivates your old 
System folder (you'll find it, later, in a new folder called Previous System Folders) and puts a new one in its place. And 
that's exactly what you want.
Click OK and then continue with the previous step 5. When it's all over, you'll be confident that your Mac OS X installation is 
clean, fresh, and ready for action.

A.6 The Setup Assistant
When the Mac "comes to" after a basic installation, the first thing you experience is some jazzy music (a new theme for 
Panther), and the towering, gleaming X of the Panther logo. Then, once Apple has quite finished showing off its multimedia 
prowess, you arrive at a Welcome screen.
Once again, you're in for a click-through-the-screens experience, this time with the aim of setting up your Mac's various 
settings. After answering the questions on each screen, click Continue.
The number and sequence of information screens you'll encounter depend on whether you've upgraded an existing Mac or 
started fresh, but here are some of the possibilities:
G     Welcome. Click the name of the country you're in.
G     Personalize Your Settings. Click the name of the country you're in—or, more specifically, the country whose 
keyboard layout is the one you're used to. (Believe it or not, the "standard" computer keyboard isn't standard from 
country to country.)
G     Your Apple ID. Here, you're offered the chance to type in, or create, an Apple ID—which is your email address. An 
Apple ID doesn't cost anything, but it makes life easier if you want to buy songs from the Apple Music Store, order 
gift books or prints from iPhoto, and so on. (If you have a .Mac account—see Section 18.9—put that account info 
here.) And if you'd rather not bother with any of this, click "Don't create an Apple ID for me."
G     Registration Information. This is your chance to become a grain of sand on the great beach of the Apple 
database (and to set up your own "card" in Mac OS X's Address Book program). Click Continue.
If you're not interested in providing your personal information to Apple, or if you've 
already done so during a previous installation, press 
-Q. A message offers you 
Skip, Shut Down, and Cancel buttons. If you click Skip, you jump straight ahead to 
"Create Your Account," below.
G     A Few More Questions. This window includes two pop-up menus that let you tell Apple where your computer will 
be used (Home, Home Business, and so on) and what you do for a living. You'll also find buttons that let you 
accept or decline some exciting new junk mail from Apple and its partners. Click Continue.
The "Thank You" screen now appears, telling you that the information you've just supplied will be sent to Apple as 
soon as you connect to the Internet. Click Continue.
G     Create Your Account. Most of the steps up to this point have been pretty inconsequential, but this is a big 
moment. You're about to create your account—your Administrator account, in fact, as described in Chapter 11.
All you have to do is make up a name, usually a short variation of your name (eight characters or fewer—no 
spaces) and a password (same deal). Choose carefully, because you can't easily change your account name later.
If you're the only one who uses your Mac, it's perfectly OK to leave the password blank empty.
What you come up with here is extremely important, especially if several different people use this Mac at different 
times, or if other people connect to it on a network. See Section 11.3 for details on creating a password and a hint

that will help you remember it.
Click Continue.
NOTE
The rest of the setup process involves the creation of an Internet account. If your Mac was already 
connected to the Internet (in Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X), Mac OS X 10.3 is kind enough to absorb 
those settings and take you straight to the Select Time Zone screen described below.
G     Get Internet Ready. You can tell the setup program that you don't want to set up an Internet account right now. 
Otherwise, the buttons on this screen let you sign up for an EarthLink Internet account (which will wind up costing 
about $22 per month) or indicate that you already have an Internet service.
For the purposes of these instructions, let's say that you decided not to sign up for an EarthLink account, which 
would introduce a detour in the setup process.
If you are the only person who uses your Mac—if it's your personal laptop, for example—none 
of this information is especially important. You'll never have to remember any of it. In fact, if 
security isn't an issue for you, you might want to consider leaving the Password field empty. 
(The Mac will warn you that this isn't a particularly secure scenario if you work on an office 
network, but you don't care. Having no password will make it easier for you to hook up your 
Mac to another one, as described in Chapter 12 .)

G     How Do You Connect? Your choices are "Telephone modem" (your Mac's builtin dial-up modem), "Cable 
modem" (a cable modem connected directly to your Mac), "DSL modem" (a Digital Subscriber Line modem that's 
connected directly to your Mac), "Local network (Ethernet)," or "Local network (AirPort wireless)." The last two 
options refer to an office network or a router connected to your Mac,either with Ethernet wiring or a wireless AirPort 
card.
When you click Continue, you may be asked for specific information—the local access number, account name, and 
password, and so on—regarding your Internet account. See Chapter 18 for advice on filling in these settings.
G     Get .Mac. You can read all about .Mac accounts in Chapter 18. The crown jewel, of course, is the 100 MB Internet-
based backup hard drive called an iDisk. If you already have a .Mac account, click the appropriate button and fill in 
your account name and password. If not, you can create one now. (If you want to decline altogether, click the 
sneakily worded "I'll set up a .Mac membership later," which doesn't really mean that you have to.)
G     Now You're Ready to Connect. If you click Continue, your Mac attempts to connect to the Internet and send your 
registration information to Apple.
G     Set Up Mail. When the registration is complete, you're offered the opportunity to set up your email account. If 
you've just been through the .Mac business, your account information—that is, your yourname@mac.com email 
account information—is already filled in. You can jump right in to start using the Mac OS X Mail program (Chapter 
19) without having to configure anything more.
To set up a different email account, click "Add my existing email account" and fill in the information on the right side 
of the screen.

G     Select Time Zone, Set the Date and Time. These screens help you set your Mac's built-in clock—a surprisingly 
important step, because it determines how the files you create will know whether they are older or newer than other 
versions. (To change the date, either click on the calendar, or click its digits and then type over
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Selective Installs
Whoops! I accidentally trashed my copy of the Calculator. How can I get it back? Do I have to reinstall 
the whole, seething, 2 GB mass of Mac OS X? 
Fortunately, no. If you know the secret, you can install only specific components of Mac OS X without 
having to install the whole darned thing.
What you need is Pacifist, a shareware program that lets you install individual files and folders from 
the archipelago that is the collection of Mac OS X installation discs.
Technically, the Mac OS X installer is composed of dozens of sub-installers known as .pkg package 
files, which the installer opens one after another. That's the point of Pacifist—it lets you open an 
individual .pkg file.
Pacifist can also check existing installations and find missing or altered files. You can download it from 
the "Missing CD" page at www.missingmanuals.com 
them using your keyboard. To change the time, you can either drag the clock's hands—fun!—or, again, click the 
digits above it and then retype.)
G     Thank You. The final screen asks you to enjoy your Apple computer. (If you skipped the registration portion of the 
setup, it reminds you that you can turn in your info to Apple at any time, just by opening the Send Registration icon 
in your Home folder.)
When you click Done, you wind up at the Mac OS X desktop, just as described in Chapter 1.

A.7 Uninstalling Mac OS X 10.3
There isn't any easy way to remove Mac OS X if you decide that you don't like it.
The chief problem is that thousands of its pieces are invisible. Even if you start up the Mac from another disk and then drag 
all the visible Mac OS X folders to the Trash, you'll leave behind many megabytes of software crumbs that you can't see.
Here and there, in books and on Web sites, you'll find conflicting lists of these invisible files, along with elaborate steps for 
making them visible and then throwing them away. The truth is, however, that you'll save time by backing up the data that's 
worth preserving—your Home folder, Applications folder, Library folder, and whatever folders you use in Mac OS 9—and 
then erasing the hard drive or partition and reinstalling the operating system that you prefer.

Appendix B. Troubleshooting
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
Appendix B. Troubleshooting
Whether it's a car engine or an operating system, anything with several thousand parts can develop the occasional 
technical hiccup. Mac OS X is far more resilient than its predecessors, but it's still a complex system with the potential for 
occasional glitches.
If you're used to an older operating system, beware: very few pages of the traditional troubleshooting workbook apply to 
Mac OS X. Mac OS 9 veterans can forget about giving a program more memory, turning off system extensions, and 
rebuilding the desktop. Windows refugees can forget all about driver conflicts, IRQs, and the Registry.
In short, Mac OS X is a whole new world when it comes to troubleshooting.
It's safe to say that you'll have to do less troubleshooting in Mac OS X than in Mac OS 9 or Windows, especially considering 
that most freaky little glitches go away if you just try these two steps, one at a time:
G     Quit and restart the wayward program.
G     Log out and log back in again.
It's the other problems that will drive you batty.

B.1 Problems That Aren't Problems
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
B.1 Problems That Aren't Problems
Before you panic, accept the possibility that whatever is frustrating you is a Mac OS X difference, not a Mac OS X problem. 
Plenty of "problems" turn out simply to be quirks of the way Mac OS X works. For example:
G     My System Preferences controls are dimmed. As noted in Chapter 8, many of Mac OS X's control panels are off-
limits to Standard account holders. That is, only people with Administrator accounts are allowed to make changes, 
as indicated by the padlock icon at the lower-left corner of such panels.
G     I can't log in! I'm in an endless login loop! If the standard Login screen never seems to appear, it's because 
somebody has turned on the automatic login feature described in Section 11.4.1. The Login screen won't appear, 
giving you a chance to sign in with your own account, until somebody either turns off automatic login or chooses 
Log Out.
G     I can't move or open a folder. Like it or not, Mac OS X is Unix, and Unix has a very strict sense of who, among 
the people who share a Mac over time, owns certain files and folders. For starters, people who don't have 
Administrator accounts aren't allowed to move, or even open, certain important folders. Section 11.2 has much 
more on this topic.
If whatever problem you're having doesn't fall into one of the preceding categories, then maybe something truly has gone 
wrong; read on.

B.2 Minor Eccentric Behavior
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
B.2 Minor Eccentric Behavior
Mac OS X itself is generally about as unstable as Mount Everest. It's the programs that most often cause you grief.
All kinds of glitches may befall you. Your desktop picture doesn't change when you change it in System Preferences. A 
menulet doesn't open when you click it. A program won't open—it just bounces on the Dock a couple of times and then 
stops.
When a single program is acting up like this, but quitting and restarting it does no good, try the following steps, in the 
following sequence.
B.2.1 First Resort: Repair Permissions
An amazing number of mysterious glitches arise because the permissions of either that item or something in your System 
folder have become muddled—that is, the complex mesh of interconnected Unix permissions described in Section 16.1.1.
When something just doesn't seem to be working right, therefore, open your Applications
 Utilities folder and open Disk 
Utility. Proceed as shown in Figure B-1.
Most Mac mavens, in fact, believe in running this Repair Permissions routine after running 
any kind of installer, just to nip nascent problems in the bud. That includes both installers of 
new programs and of Apple's own Mac OS X updates.
B.2.2 Second Resort: Look for an Update
If a program starts acting up immediately after you've installed or upgraded to Mac OS X 10.3, chances are good that it has 
some minor incompatibility. Chances are also good that you'll find an updated version on the company's Web site.
B.2.3 Third Resort: Toss the Prefs File
Here we are in the age of Mac OS X, and we're still throwing away preference files?
Absolutely. A corrupted preference file can still bewilder the program that depends on it.
Click your hard drive's name in the left-side list; click the First Aid tab; click Repair Disk 
Permissions; and then read an article while the Mac checks out your disk. If the program finds 
anything amiss, you'll see messages like these. Among the text, you may recognize some Unix 
shorthand for read, write, and execute privileges (Section 16.1.1).

B.2 Minor Eccentric Behavior
 
Before you go on a dumpfest, however, take this simple test. Log in using a different account (perhaps a dummy account 
that you create just for testing purposes). Run the problem program. Is the problem gone? If so, then the glitch exists only 
when you are logged in—which means it's a problem with your copy of the program's preferences.
Return to your own account. Open your Home folder
Library
Preferences folder, where you'll find neatly labeled 
preference files for all of the programs you use. Each ends with the file name suffix .plist. For example, com.apple.finder.
plist is the Finder's preference file, com.apple.dock.plist is the Dock's, and so on.
Put the suspect preference file into the Trash, but don't empty it. The next time you run the recalcitrant program, it will build 
itself a brand-new preference file that, if you're lucky, lacks whatever corruption was causing your problems.
If not, quit the program. You can reinstate its original .plist file from the Trash, if you'd find that helpful as you pursue your 
troubleshooting agenda.
Remember, however, that you actually have three Preferences folders. In addition to your own Home folder's stash, there's 
a second one in the Library folder in the main hard drive window (which administrators are allowed to trash), and a third in 
the System
Library folder in the main hard drive window (which nobody is allowed to trash—at least not without one of

the security-bypass methods described in the box on the facing page).
In any case, the next time you log in, the Mac will create fresh, virginal preference files.
B.2.4 Fourth Resort: Log Out
Sometimes you can give Mac OS X or its programs a swift kick by logging out (
 Log Out) and logging back in 
again. It's an inconvenient step, but not nearly as timeconsuming as restarting the computer.
B.2.5 Last Resort: Trash and Reinstall the Program
Sometimes reinstalling the problem program clears up whatever the glitch was.
First, however, throw away all traces of it. Open the Applications folder and drag the program's icon (or its folder) to the 
Trash. In most cases, the only remaining piece to discard is its .plist file (or files) in your Home
Library
Preferences 
folder.
Then reinstall the program from its original CD or installer—after first checking the company's Web site to see if there's an 
updated version, of course.

B.3 Frozen Programs (Force Quitting)
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
B.3 Frozen Programs (Force Quitting)
The occasional unresponsive application has become such a part of Mac OS X life that, among the Mac cognoscenti online, 
the dreaded, endless "please wait" cursor has been given its own acronym: SBOD (Spinning Beachball of Death). When 
the SBOD strikes, no amount of mouse clicking and keyboard pounding will get you out of the recalcitrant program.
Here are the different ways you can go about force quitting a stuck program (the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete in 
Windows), in increasing order of desperation:
G     Use the Dock. If you can't use the program's regularly scheduled File
Quit command, try Control-clicking its 
Dock icon and choosing Quit from the pop-up menu.
G     Force quit the usual way. Choose 
Force Quit to terminate the stuck program, or use one of the other 
force-quit methods described in Section 4.1.3.
G     Force quit the sneaky way. Some programs, including the Dock, don't show up at all in the usual Force Quit 
dialog box. Your next attempt, therefore, should be to open the Activity Monitor program (in 
Applications
Utilities), which shows everything that's running. Double-click a program and then, in the resulting 
dialog box, click Quit to force quit it. (Unix hounds: You can also use the kill command in Terminal, as described in 
Section 16.2.)
If you find yourself having to quit the Dock more than once, here's an easier way: make 
yourself a little AppleScript (Chapter 7) consisting of a single line: tell application "Dock" to 
quit. Save it as an application. Whenever you feel that the Dock needs a good kick in the 
rear, double-click your little AppleScript.
G     Force quit remotely.If the Finder itself has locked up, you can't very well get to Activity Monitor (unless it occurred 
to you before hand to stash its icon your Dock—not a bad idea). At this point, you may have to abort the locked 
program from another computer across the network, if you're on one, by using the SSH (secure shell) command. 
The end of Chapter 21 offers a blow-by-blow description of how you might terminate a program by remote control 
in this way, either from elsewhere on the office network or even from across the Internet.
If all of this seems like a lot to remember, you can always force-restart the Mac. On most 
recent Macs, you do that by holding down the power button for a few seconds. If that doesn't 
work, press Control-
-power button.

B.4 The Wrong Program Opens
As noted in Chapter 4, the way documents are linked to the programs that can open them is very different in Mac OS X 
than it was before. Some documents have invisible, four-letter type and creator codes that tell them which programs they 
"belong to." Other documents lack these codes, and open up in whichever program recognizes its file name extension (.doc 
or .txt, for example).
Section 4.5.2 shows you how to choose which program opens a certain document (or kind of document). But that's not 
much help when you double-click a text document and have to sit there while SimpleText opens up—in Classic, mandating 
a 45-second wait.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Fixing Permissions Problems
Sooner or later, when you try to move, rename, or delete a certain file or folder, you may get an error 
message like this—"The folder 'Junk' could not be opened because you do not have sufficient access 
privileges"—or this: "The operation could not be completed because this item is owned by Chris" (or by root, 
which means by Mac OS X itself).
What they're trying to say is, you've run into a permissions problem.
As noted in Chapter 11, Mac OS X is designed to accommodate a number of different people who share the 
same Mac over time. Nobody is allowed to meddle with other people's files or folders. But even if you're the 
solo operator of your Mac, you still share it with Mac OS X itself (which the error messages may refer to as 
root or system).
In any case, if you're confident that whatever you're trying to do isn't some kind of nihilistic, self-destructive act 
like trashing the Applications folder, it's easy enough to get past these limitations. Just highlight the 
recalcitrant file or folder and then choose File
Get Info. In its window, you'll find an Ownership & 
Permissions panel that lets you reassign ownership of any icon to, for example, yourself (if you have an 
Administrator account, that is). Make sure your permission is "Read & Write." (Just don't perform this surgery 
on files in the System folder.)
Now you own that folder or file, and you can do whatever you like with it.
The simple rule to remember here is that creator codes override file name extensions. In other words, a file called Contract.
txt generally opens in Mac OS X's TextEdit—if it doesn't have a four-letter creator code behind the scenes. If that same file 
has SimpleText's creator code (ttxt), however, it opens in SimpleText (and Classic) no matter what its file name is.
The quickest solution may be to strip away the type and creator codes. You can do that by dragging the troubled files' icons 
onto a program like Wipe Creator (available from the Missing CD page of www.missingmanuals.com). At that point, Mac OS 
X has only the document's file name extension to go on when choosing a program to open it.

B.5 Can't Empty the Trash
If you're having trouble emptying the Trash, start by holding down the mouse on the Trash icon itself. When you choose 
Empty Trash from the pop-up menu, Mac OS X empties the Trash without complaint, locked files and all.
If emptying the Trash gives you "Could not be completed because this item is owned by Marge," you're trying to move or 
delete another Mac account holder's stuff. As you know, that's a big no-no in Mac OS X.
In that case, just make yourself the new owner of the file or folder, as described in the box in Appendix B.4.

If you're not allowed to drag an icon somewhere, the error message that appears almost always hits the nail on the head:

problem.

If a program won't open (if its icon bounces merrily in the Dock for a few seconds, for instance, but then nothing happens),

does.

B.8 Startup Problems
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
B.8 Startup Problems
Not every problem you encounter is related to running applications. Sometimes trouble strikes before you even get that far. 
The following are examples.
B.8.1 Kernel Panic
When you see the cheerful, multilingual dialog box shown in Figure B-2, you've got yourself a kernel panic—a Unix nervous 
breakdown.
(In such situations, user panic might be the more applicable term, but that's programmers for you.)
Kernel panics are increasingly rare. If you see one at all, it's almost always the result of a hardware glitch—most often a 
bad memory (RAM) board, but possibly an accelerator card, graphics card, SCSI gadget, or USB hub that Mac OS X 
doesn't like. A poorly seated AirPort card can even bring on a kernel panic.
If simply restarting the machine doesn't help, detach every shred of gear that didn't come from Apple. Restore these 
components to the Mac one at a time until you find out which one was causing Mac OS X's bad hair day. If you're able to 
pinpoint the culprit, seek its manufacturer (or its Web site) on a quest for updated drivers, or at least try to find out for sure 
whether the add-on is compatible with Mac OS X.
This advice goes for your Macintosh itself. Apple periodically updates the Mac's own "drivers" 
in the form of a firmware update. You download these updaters from the Support area of 
Apple's Web site (if indeed Mac OS X's own Software Update mechanism doesn't alert you 
to its existence).
A kernel panic is almost always related to some piece of add-on hardware. And look at the 
bright side: At least you get this handsome dialog box in Mac OS X 10.3. That's a lot better than 
the Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 effect—random text gibberish super-imposing itself on your screen.

B.8 Startup Problems
 
There's one other cause for kernel panics, by the way, and that's moving, renaming, or changing the access permissions for 
Mac OS X's essential system files and folders—the Applications or System folder, for example. (See Section 12.2.10 for 
more on permissions.) This cause isn't even worth mentioning, of course, because nobody would be that foolish.
B.8.2 Safe Mode (Safe Boot)
All kinds of software nuggets load during the startup process. Some of them, you choose yourself (icons you add to the 
Startup Items list in the System Preferences
 Accounts pane). Others, you don't normally see: a large mass of kernel 
extensions, which are chunks of software that add various features to the basic operating system.
If you're experiencing startup crashes, some non-Apple installer may have given you one or the other of these that doesn't 
care for Mac OS X 10.3.
Mac OS 9 fans press the Shift key at startup to turn off the extensions. Windows fans press an F-key to start up in Safe 
Mode. Either way, the idea is the same: to turn off all non-essential system-software nubbins in an effort to get a sick 
machine at least powered up.
Although not one person in a hundred knows it, Mac OS X offers the same kind of emergency keystroke. It can come in 
handy when you've just installed some new piece of software and find that you can't even start up the machine; with this 
trick, you can at least turn on the computer so that you can uninstall the cranky program.
The trick is to press the Shift key as the machine is starting up. Hold it down from the startup chime until you see the words 
"Safe Boot" on the progress-bar box.
You'll find a long list of standard features inoperable: Mac OS X's sound software; laptop-specific features like PC cards, 
infrared, and internal modems; all USB gadgets except the keyboard and mouse; FireWire camcorders; and any feature

B.8 Startup Problems
that didn't come from Apple. (The next time you restart, all of this goodness will be restored, assuming you're no longer 
clutching the Shift key in a sweaty panic.)
There's another use for the Shift key, too: If you press it later in the startup sequence—after logging in but before the 
desktop appears—you prevent any Finder windows from opening and your startup items.prevent your own hand-picked 
startup items from opening.
This, too, is a troubleshooting tactic. If some startup item crashes your Mac every time it opens, you can squelch it just long 
enough to remove it from your Startup Items list.
If you hold down the Shift key continuously from the startup chime all the way until the 
desktop appears, you turn off both kernel extensions and your startup items.
B.8.3 Gray Screen During Startup
Confirm that your Mac has the latest firmware, as described in the previous Tip. Detach and test all your non-Apple add-
ons, also as described in the previous paragraphs. Finally, perform a disk check (see below).
B.8.4 Blue Screen During Startup
Most of the troubleshooting steps for this problem (which is usually accompanied by the Spinning Beachball of Death 
cursor) are the same as those described under "Kernel Panic" above. But there's one other cause to examine: a corrupted 
font file in your Mac OS 9 System Folder.
To test for this problem, restart the Mac in Mac OS 9, open its System Folder (that's the folder called System Folder, not 
just System), and drag the Fonts folder to the desktop. Restart in Mac OS X. If the startup proceeds smoothly, you know 
you've got a damaged font file in that Fonts folder.
B.8.5 Forgotten Password
If you or one of the other people who use your Mac have forgotten the corresponding account password, no worries: just 
read the box in Section 11.4.2.

B.9 Fixing the Disk
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
B.9 Fixing the Disk
The beauty of Mac OS X's design is that the operating system itself is frozen in its perfect, pristine state, impervious to 
conflicting system extensions, clueless Mac users, and other sources of disaster.
That's the theory, anyway. But what happens if something goes wrong with the complex software that operates the hard 
drive itself?
Fortunately, Mac OS X comes with its own disk-repair program. In the familiar Mac universe of icons and menus, it takes 
the form of a program in Applications
 Utilities called Disk Utility. In the barren world of Terminal and the command line 
interface, there's a utility that works just as well but bears a different name: fsck (for file system check).
In any case, running Disk Utility or its alter ego fsck is a powerful and useful troubleshooting tool that can cure all kinds of 
strange ills, including these problems, among others:
G     Your Mac freezes during startup, either before or after the Login screen.
G     The startup process interrupts itself with the appearance of the text-only command line.
G     You get the "applications showing up as folders" problem.
B.9.1 Method 1: Disk Utility
The easiest way to check your disk is to use the Disk Utility program. Use this method if your Mac can, indeed, start up. 
(See Method 2 if you can't even get that far.)
Disk Utility can't check the disk it's on. That's why you have to restart the computer from the Mac OS X CD-ROM (or 
another startup disk), and run Disk Utility from there. The process goes like this:
1.  Start up the Mac from the Mac OS X CD. 
The best way to do that is to insert the CD and then restart the Mac while holding down the C key.
You wind up, after some time, at the Mac OS X Installer screen. Don't be fooled—installing Mac OS X is not what 
you want to do here. Don't click Continue!
2.  Choose Installer
Open Disk Utility. 
That's the unexpected step. After a moment, the Disk Utility screen appears.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-B-SECT-9.html (1 of 5)5/3/2004 5:07:52 AM

B.9 Fixing the Disk
You could also skip steps 1 and 2 by starting up from an external hard drive, like an 
iPod onto which you've installed Mac OS X. Just run its own copy of Disk Utility to 
check your Mac's hard drive.
3.  Click the disk or disk partition you want to fix, click the First Aid tab, and then click Repair Disk. 
The Mac whirls into action, checking a list of very technical disk-formatting parameters.
If you see the message, "The volume 'Macintosh HD' appears to be OK," that's meant to be good news. Believe it or not, 
that cautious statement is as definitive an affirmation as Disk Utility is capable of making about the health of your disk.
NOTE
Note: Don't be alarmed. The message's last line says "Repair completed" whether or not any repairing was 
done at all.
Disk Utility may also tell you that the disk is damaged, but that it can't help you. In that case, you need a more heavy-duty 
disk-repair program like Drive 10 (www.micromat.com ) or DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com ).
B.9.2 Method 2: fsck at the Console
Disk Utility isn't of much use when you can't find the Mac OS X CD, when your CD drive isn't working, or when you're in a 
hurry to get past the startup problems that are plaguing your machine. In these cases, you'll be glad that you can boot into 
the Mac's raw Unix underlayer to perform some diagnostic (and healing) commands.
POWER USERS' CLINIC
Journaling vs. fsck
Mac OS X 10.3 comes with journaling turned on. As noted in Appendix A.4, journaling means that the Mac 
keeps a little diary about every tiny bit of hard drive activity. In event of a crash or freeze, the Mac knows 
precisely what was going on at the time, and precisely which files might have been damaged.
In theory, then, you'll never need fsck at all. After all, there's nothing to check. The Mac's journaling software 
is always on top of things—and, if the journal indicates that there was trouble saving a file, Mac OS X can 
finish or undo the change.
Even Apple concedes, however, that in the real world, things can still go wrong, even with journaling turned 
on.
That's why, when you attempt to use fsck as described on these pages, a message will inform you that, hey, 
you don't need to repair your disk. Thanks to journaling, there's no damage to repair.
If you decide to proceed on the off chance that something's gone wrong behind your journal's back, just use 
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-B-SECT-9.html (2 of 5)5/3/2004 5:07:52 AM

B.9 Fixing the Disk
the -f flag to force the disk check, like this: fsck -f.
Note, however, that you may see a series of phony error messages when you do this. If you see any of these 
messages, you should ignore them:
G     "Volume bitmap needs minor repair"
G     "Invalid volume free block count" or "block count changed from XX to YY"
G     "Volume header needs minor repair"
G     "Incorrect block count for file"
If you see any other error messages, though, let fsck go ahead and repair them.
Specifically, you'll be glad that you can run the Unix program fsck, for which Disk Utility is little more than a pretty faceplate.
Like any Unix program, fsck runs at the command line. You launch it from the all-text, black Unix screen by typing fsck and 
pressing Enter. (As discussed in the box on the facing page, you can also use fsck -f.)
You can't, however, just run fsck in Terminal. You have to run it when the usual arsenal of graphic-interface programs—like 
the Finder and its invisible suite of accessory programs—isn't running.
B.9.2.1 Single-user mode (
-S at startup)
The Terminal program is the best known form of Mac OS X's command line, but it's not the only one. In fact, there are 
several other ways to get there.
In general, you don't hear them mentioned except in the context of troubleshooting, because the Terminal program offers 
many more convenient features for doing the same thing. And because it's contained in a Mac OS X-style window, Terminal 
is not so disorienting as the three methods you're about to read.
All of these techniques take you into console mode, shown in Figure B-3. In console mode, Unix takes over your screen 
completely, showing white type against black, no windows or icons in sight. Abandon the mouse, all ye who enter here; in 
console mode, you can't do anything but type commands.
In console mode, your entire screen is a command line interface. Unix jockeys can go to town 
here. Everyone else can timidly type fsck -y after the localhost: /root # prompt—see this prompt 
on the very last line?—and hope for the best.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-B-SECT-9.html (3 of 5)5/3/2004 5:07:52 AM

B.9 Fixing the Disk
 
To get there in times of startup troubleshooting, press 
-S while the Mac is starting up. (If you're stuck at the frozen 
remnants of a previous startup attempt, you may first have to force-restart your Mac; see the tip in Appendix B.4.)
Instead of arriving at the usual desktop, you see technical-looking text scrolling up a black screen as the Mac runs its 
various startup routines. When it finally stops at the localhost # prompt, you're ready to type commands. You're now in 
what's called single-user mode, meaning that the Unix multiple-accounts software has yet to load. You won't be asked to 
log in.
At the localhost # prompt, type fsck -y (note the space before the hyphen) and press Enter. (The y means "yes," as in "yes, 
I want you to fix any problems automatically.") If the Mac refuses because journaling is turned on (Appendix A.4), you can 
also type fsck -fy to force the disk check.
You've probably gone to this trouble for the sake of running fsck, the Unix disk-checking 
program. But you can also use ls, cd, rm, or any of the other Unix commands described in 
Chapters 15 and 16.
Now the file system check program takes over, running through five sets of tests. When it's complete, you'll see one of two 
messages:
G     The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK. All is well. Type exit and press Return to proceed to the usual 
Login screen and desktop.
file:///Users/crazymonkey/Desktop/Mac%20OS%20X%20Th...0Edition/0596006152/macxmmpanther-APP-B-SECT-9.html (4 of 5)5/3/2004 5:07:52 AM

B.9 Fixing the Disk
G     File system was modified. A good sign, but just a beginning. You need to run the program again. One fsck pass 
often repairs only one layer of problems, leaving another to be patched in the next pass. Type fsck -y a second 
time, a third time, and so on, until you finally arrive at a "disk appears to be OK" message.
Typing exit at the prompt and pressing Return is how you get back to the familiar Aqua world 
of icons and windows.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Viruses? What viruses?
One great thing about the old Mac OS was that there were hardly any viruses to worry about—all of the 
nasties seemed to be written for Windows. But now that we're using Unix, which has been around for 30 
years and has a huge user base, is it time to worry again? 
Nope. There are even fewer viruses for Unix than for the Mac OS.
You still need to be careful with Word and Excel macro viruses, of course. If you open a Word or Excel 
attachment sent by email from someone else, and a big fat dialog box warns you that it contains macros, 
simply click Disable Macros and get on with your life.
Otherwise, you have little to worry about. After three years, not a single Mac OS X virus has emerged—partly 
because virus writers have a smaller "audience" in Mac fans, and partly because Mac OS X is more difficult to 
hack.
Sleep well.

B.10 Where to Get Troubleshooting Help
If the basic steps described in this chapter haven't helped, the universe is crawling with additional help sources.
B.10.1 Help Online
These Internet sites contain nothing but troubleshooting discussions, tools, and help:
G     MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com ). The world's one-stop resource for Mac troubleshooting advice.
G     Mac newsgroups (such as comp.system.mac). A newsgroup is an Internet bulletin board, which you can access 
using a program like Microsoft Entourage or Thoth (www.thothsw.com ). If you're polite and concise, you can post 
questions to the multitudes here and get more replies to them than you'll know what to do with.
G     Other Apple support resources (www.apple.com/support ). Apple's help Web site also includes downloadable 
manuals, software updates, frequently asked questions, and many other resources.
The mother of all troubleshooting resources, however, is Apple's own Knowledge Base. This is the collection of 50,000 
individual technical articles, organized in a searchable database, that the Apple technicians themselves consult when you 
call for help.
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
The Reinstall
When some component is missing, your troubleshooting steps have failed, and Mac OS X continues to act up, 
consider reinstalling Mac OS X.
That's not a big deal at all. It involves inserting the Mac OS X CD, restarting the Mac, pressing the C key as 
the computer starts up, and proceeding with the installer as described in Appendix A.
The good news is that reinstalling Mac OS X doesn't touch your files, folders, or settings. It simply patches 
whatever holes have opened up in the Unix undercarriage of your operating system—which, every now and 
then, does you a world of good.
And what if you've updated your CDs' copy of Panther with little updates—Mac OS X 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and so 
on?
In that case, you'll have to do a clean install (that is, an "Archive & Install" as described in Appendix A). It 
gives you a brand-new Mac OS X System folder, neatly retiring the previous one (and, in fact, renaming it 
Previous System Folder).
Yes, your new, virginal System folder isn't the latest version of Mac OS X. But that's OK—it's now safe to 
install all of the updaters you've run since your Mac OS X CD was pressed. (If you were smart enough to save 
these updaters as described in Section 8.21, you won't even have to download them from the Web again.)

B.10 Where to Get Troubleshooting Help
In no time (all right, in 35 minutes), you'll be right back where you were, this time without the glitches.
If you like, you can visit this library using your Web browser (http://kbase.info.apple.com ) or right within Sherlock 3 (click 
the AppleCare icon). You can search it either by typing in keywords or by using pop-up menus of question categories.
B.10.2 Help by Telephone
Finally, consider contacting whoever sold you the component that's making your life miserable: the printer company, 
scanner company, software company, or whatever.
If it's a Mac OS problem, you can call Apple at 800-275-2273 (that's 800-APL-CARE). For the first 90 days following your 
purchase of Mac OS X (which, as far as Apple knows, is the date of your first call), the technicians will answer your 
questions for free.
After that, unless you've paid for AppleCare for your Mac (a three-year extended warranty program), Apple will charge you 
to answer your questions. Fortunately, if the problem turns out to be Apple's fault, they won't charge you.

G     Fonts tab. You can't change the fonts used by Mac OS X (at least not without the free TinkerTool program 
described in Chapter 17). You can, though, change the type size used by the names of icons, either in a single 
window or globally. Choose View
View Options to see the controls.
G     Desktop tab. Now you apply a picture to your desktop by opening the System Preferences
Desktop & Screen

G     Sound tab. On the Sound panel of System Preferences, you can turn on "Play user interface sound effects," which 
adds tiny, subtle sound effects to your mouse movements when you drag something off the Dock or empty the

G     Digital Color Meter, which used to be in the Monitor Extras folder, is now located in Applications
Utilities. See 
Chapter 9.
G     The Font Extras folder, which contained the FontSync control panel, is gone, but FontSync itself is alive and well. 
The AppleScripts that let you use FontSync sit in the hard drive's Library

G     The Mac OS Runtime for Java folder is gone, but the Apple Applet Runner, which was inside that folder, has been 
replaced with the Applet Launcher in Applications
 Utilities.
Most of the other Apple Extras items—miscellaneous folders like FireWire, Iomega, and Apple LaserWriter Software—have 
disappeared because they've been incorporated into Mac OS X itself.

C.5 Apple (
) menu
The 
 menu is still in Mac OS X, but it's no longer customizable. Instead, it lists useful commands that you'll want to 
access no matter what program you're using: Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, and so on. The 
 menu's quick-access icon 
launching features have now been taken over by the Dock (Chapter 3).
G     About This Computer. This command's functions have been scattered across Mac OS X. To find out your Mac's 
system-software version, total installed memory, and processor type, choose 
About This Mac. For memory 
stats on running programs, go to Applications
Utilities and open Activity Monitor. It shows you, perhaps, a little 
more information than you need, but the memory consumption listings are still there, updated in real time. (Mac OS 
X programs don't use a fixed amount of RAM; they constantly adjust as needed.)
G     Apple System Profiler. Still in Mac OS X, now called System Profiler but better than ever—and it's in 
Applications
Utilities.
G     Calculator. Dramatically revamped (see Chapter 9) and moved to your Applications folder.
G     Chooser. Eliminated. Its two primary functions—choosing a printer and connecting to a network—have been 
moved to the Print dialog box (choose File
Print in any program) and the Network icon in the Sidebar, 
respectively.
G     Control Panels. It's now called System Preferences (Chapter 8). You can get to it by clicking its Dock icon or by 
choosing 
System Preferences.
G     Favorites. In Panther, Favorites have received a big demotion; see Section 2.6.
You can still access your Mac OS 9 Favorites, however; they're listed in the Classic menulet 
(Section 3.6).
G     Key Caps. See "Key Caps," later in this appendix.
G     Network Browser. Now you can browse your network from within any Finder window. Just click the Network icon 
in the left-side Sidebar, as described in Chapter 12.
G     Recent Applications, Recent Documents, Recent Servers. Recent Applications and Recent Documents are 
now submenus of the 
Recent Items command. To see networked disks (servers) to which you've recently 
connected, choose Go
 Recent Folders or, for a network-only list, Go
Connect to Server. In the Connect 
to Server box, the pop-up menu lists recently accessed servers.
G     Remote Access Status. It's now called Internet Connect, and it's in your Applications folder.
G     Scrapbook. Eliminated. The closest equivalent is Stickies (in your Applications folder), which can now accept 
graphics, sounds, and movies.
G     Sherlock 2. To open Sherlock (now version 3), click its icon on the Dock. (You can always double-click it in the 
Applications folder, but that takes longer.)
You no longer use Sherlock to search for files, however. For that purpose, use the Search bar or File
Find 
command described in Chapter 2. Sherlock 3 is now dedicated tool for certain Web searches (movies, stocks,

Gone. You now use the Dock to see which programs you have running (the icons with little black triangles beneath them) 
and to switch between those programs. As noted in Chapter 4 you can still use the Dock for many of the tricks the 
Application menu used to play.
The Hide [application] and Hide Others commands, meanwhile, are now at the left end of the menu bar in the new 
Application menu—the one that bears the current application's name.
They're also in the Dock. Control-click a program's Dock icon to see the Hide option, and 
Option-click the icon to see the Hide Others option.

C.17 Click-and-a-half
Mac OS X folders are spring-loaded: If you drag an icon onto one and don't let go of the mouse button, the window springs 
open around it so that you can continue your drag. But they still don't pop open automatically, as in Mac OS 9, when you 
hover over them after a "click-and-a-half "—when you double-click, then do another half-click, so that the mouse button 
stays down. (Sound complicated? Maybe that's why Apple killed it.)

C.23 Contextual Menu Items folder
Mac OS X makes extensive use of contextual pop-up menus, but adding new commands to them is usually a matter of 
running an installer, not dropping them into a certain folder yourself.
But to answer the question: The Mac OS X incarnation of the old Contextual Menu Items folder is the 
Library
Contextual Menu Items folder. (If this folder doesn't exist, you can create it.)

C.58 Hide commands
Commands for hiding the active program, or hiding everything else but the active program, have moved from the old 
Application menu (on the far right of the menu bar) to the new Application menu (the one on the left next to the 
 menu) 
that bears the name of the frontmost program. Hiding the current program also now has an of- ficial keyboard shortcut (in 
most programs): 
-H. And hiding all other programs has a keyboard shortcut, too, although it works in even fewer 
programs: Option-
-H.
Then there's Exposé, which can make the whole concept of hiding programs obsolete (Section 4.3).

Appendix D. The "Where'd It Go?" Dictionary (Windows 
Version)
Maybe you were persuaded by the Apple "Switch" ad campaign. Maybe you just like the looks of today's Macs. Or maybe 
you've just had one IRQ conflict too many. In any case, if you're switching to Mac OS X from Windows, this appendix is for 
you. It's an alphabetical listing of every common Windows function and where to find it in Mac OS X. After all, an operating 
system is an operating system. The actual functions are pretty much the same—they're just in different places.
If this listing only whets your appetite for information about making the switch, read Switching 
to the Mac: The Missing Manual. In addition to an expanded version of this appendix, it also 
contains useful information on moving your files from the PC to the Mac, copying over your 
email, transferring your address book, and so on.

If your Mac keyboard has an Eject or F12 key in the upper-right corner, hold it down for a moment to open the CD/DVD 
drawer, or, if you have a slot-loading drive, to spit out the disc that's in it. If it's an older Mac keyboard without an Eject key, 
you can eject a CD (or any other disk) by Control-clicking its desktop icon and choosing Eject from the contextual menu. 
There are various other ways to eject a disk, but the point is that you never do so by pushing the Eject button on the disk 
drive itself.

and other special characters. The equivalent on the Mac is called the Keyboard Viewer (Section 8.14.3)—but the new 
Character Palette (Section 8.14.2) is even easier to use.

D.20 Control Panel
The Control Panel in Mac OS X is called System Preferences, and it's represented on the Dock by a little light-switch icon.

by Categories or Organize Alphabetically from the View menu.

D.21 Copy, Cut, Paste
When you're editing in a word processor or graphics program, the Mac OS X Cut, Copy, and Paste commands work exactly 
as they do in Windows.
At the desktop, however, there are a few differences. You can indeed copy icons and paste them into a new window using 
the Copy and Paste commands—you just can't cut them out of a window, as you can in Windows. On the other hand, Mac 
OS X offers a handy secondary feature: if you paste into a word or text processor instead of into another desktop window, 
you get a tidy list of the names of the icons you copied.

hard drive in an effort to optimize their placement and speed of opening.)

D.28 Disks
Working with disks is very different on the Mac. Every disk inside, or attached to, a Macintosh is represented on the screen 
by an icon. Mac OS X does have something like the My Computer window (choose Go
Computer), but both the icons 
on the desktop and the icons in the Computer window reflect only the disks currently inserted in your Mac. You'll never see 
an icon for an empty drive, as you do on Windows, and there's no such thing as drive letters (because the Mac refers to 
disks, not to drives—and refers to them by name).

The Mac has its own "tree" view of the files and folders on your hard drive: list view. By expanding the "flippy triangles" of

If you prefer the Explorer effect of clicking a folder in one pane to see its contents in the next, try Column view instead. Both 
views are described in Chapter 1.

Of course, you can buy an external USB floppy drive for any Mac for about $45.

 < Day Day Up >  
 
D.40 Folder Options
The Folder Options control panel in Windows is a collection of unrelated settings that boil down to this:
G     General tab. Exactly as in Windows, it's up to you whether or not double-clicking a folder opens up a second 
window—or just changes what's in the first one. On the Mac, you make these changes using the 
Finder
Preferences command. There you'll find the option called "Always open folders in a new window."
G     View tab. Most of the options here don't exist on the Mac. For example, system files are always hidden on the 
Mac; you can't opt to make them visible (at least not without add-on shareware). You can, however, choose 
whether you want to see the file name extensions in your desktop windows (like .doc and .html). Choose 
Finder
Preferences
Advanced, and turn "Show all file extensions" on or off.
G     File Types tab. Just as in Windows, you can reassign certain document types so that double-clicking opens them 
up in the program of your choice. But on the Mac, you can reassign either a whole class of files at once, as in 
Windows, or one file at a time. To do it, you use the Get Info window as described in Section 4.5.2.
G     Offline Files. There's no equivalent feature on the Mac.

 < Day Day Up >  
 
D.68 Recycle Bin
Mac OS X has a Trash icon at the end of the Dock. In general, it works exactly like the Windows Recycle Bin—and why not, 
since the Macintosh Trash was Microsoft's inspiration?—but there are a couple of differences. The Macintosh never auto-
empties it, for example. That job is up to you (the simplest way is to Control-click it, or right-click it, and choose Empty Trash 
from the contextual menu).
The Mac never bothers you with an "Are you sure?" message when you throw something into the Trash, either. The Mac 
interrupts you for permission only when you choose File
Empty Trash—and you can even turn that confirmation off, if 
you like (in Finder
Preferences).
To put icons into the Trash, drag them there, or highlight them and then press 
-Delete.

There's no Start menu in Mac OS X. Instead, you stash the icons of the programs, documents, and folders you use

Exactly as with the Start menu, you can rearrange these icons (drag them horizontally) or remove the ones you don't use

(applications go to the left of the Dock's divider line, documents and folders to the right).

D.87 Taskbar
Mac OS X doesn't have a taskbar, but it does have something very close: the Dock (Chapter 3). Open programs are 
indicated by a small black triangle beneath their icons on the Dock. If you hold down your cursor on one of these icons (or 
Control-click it, or right-click it), you'll get a pop-up list of the open windows in that program, exactly as in Windows XP.
Control-clicking a folder or disk icon on the Dock is even more useful. It produces a pop-up menu of everything inside that 
disk or folder—a terrific form of X-ray vision that has no equivalent in Windows.
On the other hand, some conventions never die. Much as in Windows, you cycle through the various open programs by 
holding down the 
 key and pressing Tab repeatedly.

E.1 Web Sites
 
 < Day Day Up >  
 
E.1 Web Sites
The Web is the salvation of the Mac OS X fan, especially considering the information vacuum that dominated Mac OS X's 
early days. The Internet was the only place where people could find out what the heck was going on with their beloved 
Macs. Here are the most notable Web sites for learning the finer points of Mac OS X.
E.1.1 Mac OS X
G     www.macosxhints.com. A gold mine of tips, tricks, and hints. (So are the books spun off from it: Mac OS X Hints—
Jaguar Edition and Mac OS X Hints—Panther Edition, due in early 2004.)
G     www.macintouch.com An excellent daily dose of reporting about Mac questions, problems, and news.
G     www.osxfaq.com. Unix tips and techniques, frequently asked questions, and links to useful sites.
G     www.resexcellence.com. A rich resource of information on the underpinnings of Mac OS X, with a focus on 
changing them.
G     www.versiontracker.com and www.macupdate.com . Massive databases that track, and provide links to, all the 
latest software for Mac OS X.
G     www.apple.com/developer. Even if you aren't a developer, joining the Developer Connection (Apple's 
programmers' club) gets you an email newsletter and access to the discussion boards, which are a great place for 
hearing Mac news first—all for free. (Pay $500 a year to become a Select member, and you get CDs mailed to you 
containing upcoming versions of Mac OS X.)
G     www.macobserver.com. A good source for news and commentary about the Mac and related products.
G     www.macworld.com. The discussion boards are an ideal place to find solutions for problems. When a bug pops up, 
the posts here are a great place to start.
G     www.macaddict.com. Another great location for discussion boards.
G     www.macfixit.com. The ultimate Mac troubleshooting Web site, complete with a hotbed of Mac OS X discussion.
G     www.macdevcenter.comO'Reilly's own Mac site. Full of tutorials, news, and interesting weblogs (techie diaries).
G     www.geekculture.com. A hilarious satire site, dedicated to lampooning our tech addiction—especially Apple tech. 
Perhaps best known for the David Pogue's Head icon for Mac OS X (geekculture.com/download/davidpogue.html).
Or perhaps not.
E.1.2 Mac OS X-Style Unix Lessons and Reference
G     www.westwind.com/reference/OS-X/commandline and all the other commands you can use in Terminal or the 
console.
G     www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix. A convenient, free Web-based course in Unix for beginners.
TIP
Typing unix for beginners into a search page like Google.com nets dozens of superb help, tutorial, and 
reference Web sites. If possible, stick to those that feature the bash shell; that way, everything you learn

E.3 Advanced Books, Programming Books
By a happy coincidence, this book is printed and distributed by O'Reilly & Associates, the industry's leading source of books 
for programmers. And a big chunk of O'Reilly's catalog is dedicated to teaching Unix, especially intermediate and advanced 
Unix. If this book—particularly Chapters 7, 15, and Chapter 1616—has given you the programming bug or the Unix bug, 
here are some titles that apply:

Colophon 
The animal on the cover of Mac OS X: The Missing Manual is a panther, which is essentially a black leopard.
Due to a wrist ailment you really don't want to hear about, the author wrote the chapters of this book by voice, using Dragon 
Naturally Speaking on a generic Windows PC (a program he really, really wishes were available for the Mac). The Microsoft 
Word files were then transferred as quickly as possible across the network to a Power Mac G4, where they were spell-
checked, illustrated, and transmitted to the book's editors. Ambrosia Software's Snapz Pro was used to capture illustrations; 
Adobe Photoshop and Freehand were called in as required for touching them up.
The book was designed and laid out in Adobe InDesign 3.0 on a PowerBook G4 and Power Mac G4. The fonts used 
include Formata (as the sans-serif family) and Minion (as the serif body face). The book was then generated as an Adobe 
Acrobat PDF file for proofreading, indexing, and final transmission to the printing plant.
