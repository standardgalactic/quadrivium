The last free Windows 10 
upgrade path for consumers will 
shut down by December 31 
The so-called ‘assistive loophole’ is rather broad. BY MARK HACHMAN
T
here’s still one way consumers 
can upgrade to Windows 10 for 
free—and Microsoft will shut it 
down on December 31, even 
though a majority of the world’s PC users still 
use older versions of Windows.
Microsoft gave Windows 7 and Windows 
8.1 users an entire year after the launch of 
Windows 10 (until July 31, 2016) to upgrade to 
Windows 10 for free. But there was one 
exception: those who used assistive 
technology (go.pcworld.com/assi), such as 
screen readers, got an indefinite extension. 
According to a Microsoft support page (go.

8   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
NEWS
WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE PATH
pcworld.com/supo), 
the deadline for those 
users to upgrade to 
Windows 10 for free 
expires by the end of 
the year, as noted by 
Slashgear (go.pcworld.
com/slge). After that, 
consumers will have to 
pay the full price for a 
Windows license, which 
costs about $75 from 
Amazon for a “system 
builder” license for 
Windows 10 Home, and 
more for retail Home or Professional versions.
You might think that users who don’t use 
assistive technologies would be excluded 
from this loophole. But Microsoft is making its 
upgrade path extremely generous: “We are 
not restricting the upgrade offer to specific 
assistive technologies,” the company says. “If 
you use assistive technology on Windows, 
you are eligible for the upgrade offer.” All you 
need to do is visit the assistive support page 
(go.pcworld.com/supo) in question, assert 
that you use assistive technologies, and then 
download the upgrade tool to Windows 10. 
Granted, the assistive loophole 
represents a morally gray area, especially for 
those who normally wouldn’t need to use 
assistive technology. But you might argue 
that if you’ve ever tried out the Windows 
Narrator tool, you’ve used an assistive 
technology. And with the improved assistive 
technologies that are built into the Windows 
10 OS, those who truly need assistance will 
benefit from the free upgrade.
Why this matters: Cynics will see Microsoft’s 
“wink, wink” approach to the assistive loophole 
as one that benefits the company: Windows 10 
users only represent about 30 percent of all PCs, 
according to NetMarketShare (go.pcworld.
com/netm), compared to a Windows 7 share of 
about 49 percent. Of course, Microsoft’s using 
the stick, too: AMD’s latest Ryzen chips won’t 
deliver official drivers for Windows 7 (go.
pcworld.com/widr), part of Microsoft’s plan to 
restrict modern hardware to Windows 10 (go.
pcworld.com/plan). Unless Microsoft extends 
the program in some other form, a great freebie 
is going away.

Windows 10: Insider Build 17035 
gives the first peeks at the next 
major Redstone 4 update  
The first big update to the Windows 10 Redstone 4 update cycle. BY MARK HACHMAN
M
icrosoft’s latest Windows 10 
Insider build for the “Redstone 
4” update cycle tries to do 
away with the “sneakernet” 
with a feature called Near Share, as well as a 
phone-like autosuggest feature for text typing. 
Microsoft recently launched Windows 10 
Insider build 17035 for the Fast Ring, one of the 
first code releases for what’s been referred to as 
“Redstone 4,” or the update cycle following the 
Fall Creators Update. If Microsoft holds to its 
current schedule, Redstone 4 should be due in 
the spring.
Until then, however, Windows Insiders are 
part of the testing team trying out new 
features: Near Share, better tab muting in

Edge, a new Audio settings menu, the 
ability to configure update bandwidth, and 
a few more.
Why this matters: Microsoft’s free updates 
to Windows 10 continue. Now, however, we’re 
beginning a new, blank slate. Will there be a 
theme to Redstone 4? What will be the key 
apps? These are early days, and we’re still 
getting a few scattered, though useful, utilities.
HOW TO USE NEAR SHARE
It’s pretty easy to just haul out a USB key and 
copy a file over—if you have one handy. Near 
Share replaces that with Bluetooth, however. 
Within Windows 10, you can share just about 
any file to email, Facebook, and more. Now 
your PC can seek out nearby PCs and offer 
to share a file, too.
You’ll need to have the current Insider 
build 17035 (or, as new builds are launched, 
something more recent). You’ll need to turn 
Bluetooth on, then make sure that the Near 
Share button in the Action Center is toggled 
on. After that, every time you see the Share 
icon, you’ll have the option to share the file 
or URL with a nearby device. The recipient 
will get a note in the Action Center to either 
accept it or decline. 
(Note: most people don’t “name” their 
PCs, and instead use the generic PC name 
Windows assigns. You’ll need to check with 
the recipient to confirm the name of their PC.)
EDGE IMPROVEMENTS: 
BETTER TAB MUTING,  
ePUB SAVING
While the Fall Creators Update added nifty 
features such as ebook annotations and 
PDF improvements, this new update cycle 
allows you to save free ePUB books that 
you’re reading online to your local hard 
With Edge, you can either toggle the tab into a mute state, or right-click it.

drive. Because, well, they’re free. Likewise, 
if you click a book in the Book pane, you 
can pin it to the Start menu or just remove it 
from the device.
A more useful addition is the ability to 
mute tabs right from the tab itself. Typically, 
web browsers (including Edge) will show a 
small speaker icon next to a tab that’s playing 
audio. Muting that tab, though, often requires 
right-clicking it and selecting a mute option. 
While that option is still there, the speaker 
icon is now a toggle, so that a tab can be 
muted just by clicking the icon.
LIMIT UPDATE 
BANDWIDTH, 
AUTOSUGGEST
While the Fall Creators 
Update allowed you to 
adjust the bandwidth used 
by Windows updates, the 
new build extends that 
same functionality to 
“foreground updates”—
basically downloads you 
kick off, like apps you 
download from the Store. 
That’s handy, if only 
because people rarely babysit a major app 
download (such as a game like Gears of War 
4), instead focusing on other things, like web 
browsing.
The new Windows 10 Insider Build 17035 
also migrates the main Audio settings (with 
the ability to set Windows sounds, and so 
forth) into the Settings menu, and out of the 
Control Panel.
Windows’ touch keyboard includes a 
couple of improvements, with an “Acrylic”-
themed look to the keyboard, as well as 
expanding the touch keyboard’s reach to 
more than 190 new foreign-language layouts.
The Acrylic UI has now been added to the touch keyboard.
While the Fall Creators Update added nifty features such as ebook 
annotations and PDF improvements, this new update cycle allows 
you to save free ePUB books that you’re reading online to your 
local hard drive.

Microsoft has also begun to add generally 
useful technologies, such as eye tracking and 
dictation, as assistive technologies for 
differently abled people. To this list Microsoft 
has added an optional autosuggest feature—
not autocorrect, but autosuggest. As you 
type, Microsoft will pop up suggestions for 
the next word. It’s a feature typically found on 
phones, that now is included in Windows.
The kicker, though, is that you don’t need 
to use the soft or touch keyboard to enable 
autosuggest—it works with your standard 
hardware keyboard. To enable it, go to 
Settings > Devices > Typing and then toggle 
on the Show Text Suggestions As I Type On 
Hardware Keyboard setting.
If you do use pen to write using the soft 
keyboard, you’ll see an improved “space” 
gesture (a vertical line) for adding a space 
between words, and improved handwriting 
recognition. 
Finally, Japanese users will see something 
special: Text suggestions from the Japanese-
language AI chatbot Rinna, who will now 
suggest phrases as you type. Unfortunately, given 
the Tay debacle in the United States (go.pcworld.
com/tayd), don’t look for the same feature to 
come to American users anytime soon.

Intel and AMD team up:  
A future Core chip will have 
Radeon graphics inside   
Intel will ship a chip powered by AMD’s Radeon graphics next year to bring top-tier, 
triple-A games to the thin-and-light notebook market. BY MARK HACHMAN
I
t sounds crazy, but it’s true: Arch-rivals 
AMD and Intel have teamed up to 
co-design an Intel Core 
microprocessor with a custom AMD 
Radeon graphics core inside the processor 
package, aimed at bringing top-tier gaming 
to thin-and-light notebook PCs.
Executives from both AMD and Intel told 
PCWorld that the combined AMD-Intel chip 
will be an “evolution” of Intel’s 8th-generation, 
H-series Core chips, with the ability to power-
manage the entire module to preserve battery 
life. It’s scheduled to ship as early as the first 
quarter of 2018. 
Though both companies helped engineer 
the new chip, this is Intel’s project—Intel first 
approached AMD, both companies 
confirmed. AMD, for its part, is treating the

INTEL AND AMD TEAM UP
Radeon core as a single, 
semi-custom design, in the 
same vein as the chips it 
supplies to consoles like the 
Microsoft Xbox One X and 
Sony PlayStation 4. Some 
specifics, though, remain 
undisclosed: Intel refers to it 
as a single product, though 
it seems possible that it 
could eventually be offered 
at a range of clock speeds.
The linchpin of the 
Intel-AMD agreement is a 
tiny piece of silicon that Intel 
began talking up over the 
past year: the Embedded 
Multi-die Interconnect 
Bridge (go.pcworld.com/
mbed), or EMIB. Numerous EMIBs can 
connect silicon dies, routing the electrical 
traces through the substrate itself. The result is 
what Intel calls a System-in-Package module. 
In this case, EMIBs allowed Intel to construct 
the three-die module, which will tie together 
Intel’s Core chip, the Radeon core, and 
next-generation high-bandwidth memory, or 
HBM2 (go.pcworld.com/hbm2).
Editor’s Note: Some people are beginning to 
refer to this chip as the Kaby Lake G, a name 
that Intel representatives said they will not 
confirm. A spokeswoman referred to it as 
“rumor and speculation.”
The story behind the story: You heard right: 
This is AMD and Intel, working together. 
Shaking hands on this partnership represents 
a rare moment of harmony in an often bitter 
rivalry that began when AMD reverse-
engineered the Intel 8080 microchip in 1975. 
But in graphics, the two are more cordial: 
Intel’s low-end, integrated cores own the 
majority of the notebook PC market, while 
AMD is pinched between Intel and Nvidia’s 
high-end chips. Intel is no friend to Nvidia, 
having paid out $1.5 billion in licensing fees 
(go.pcworld.com/fees) since 2011. The 
enemy of my enemy is my friend—that’s one 
explanation for how the deal came about.
Intel showed a reference notebook of the sort that will be enhanced 
by the AMD-Intel partnership. The large, black blank space is 
designed to be used for drawing with the stylus and for other digital 
content creation.

A WIN-WIN FOR ALL 
CONCERNED
According to Chris Walker, vice president of 
Intel’s Client Computing Group, Intel had a 
problem: AAA gaming PCs were selling, 
customers were interested in VR, but 
notebooks with the graphics horsepower to 
run them were thick and heavy. Customers, 
though, were seeing growth in two-in-one 
PCs and even thinner thin-and-light PCs. 
This was what Walker called Intel’s 
“portability obstacle:” How could it bring 
top-tier performance to notebooks that 
didn’t weigh a ton?
The answer, as it turned out, was the 
EMIB, a small sliver of silicon to bridge 
discrete logic cores within a single chip 
package. Intel had originally developed the 
EMIB as an alternative to what’s known as a 
silicon interposer, the “floor” or “foundation” 
of a multichip module. The problem with an 
interposer is that, like a floor, it needs to cover 
the entire space underneath the module, 
making it expensive to manufacture. EMIBs 
are more like small connectors that dip into 
the substrate. Intel found that they worked for 
its Altera programmable logic line as well as 
its more mainstream PC microprocessor 
designs. In fact, this is the first consumer use 
of EMIB, executives said.
Intel’s EMIBs, though, allowed another 
important advantage: modularity. Originally, 
Intel positioned EMIBs as a tool to mix and 
match chips using different process 
This slide, taken from an Intel presentation, shows how Intel believes its Embedded Multi-die 
Interconnect Bridge is more cost-effective for connecting chips than methods that use an interposer, and 
far higher in performance than Multi-Chip Package designs.

technologies. When designing a 
programmable chip, adding in third-party 
logic cores is somewhat common. Within 
integrated logic as complex as a 
microprocessor’s, though, it’s nearly unheard 
of. The EMIB allowed for a compromise, 
placing CPU, GPU, and memory in close 
proximity without being part of the same 
actual design.
That paid off almost immediately. Intel’s 
still being cagey on all the benefits of the 
Core-Radeon module that EMIB enabled, but 
the company revealed two. According to 
Walker, the module stripped out a whopping 
1900 square millimeters (2.9 sq in.) from a 
more traditional motherboard, where the 
processor, discrete GPU, and memory were 
laid out next to one another. (Put another way, 
the EMIB layout consumes just half of the 
typical board space, Intel says.) Second, the 
module uses about half the memory power of 
a traditional design. 
SOFTWARE, DRIVERS 
ARE CRITICAL FOR 
MANAGING POWER
That’s important, because heat naturally 
becomes more of an issue as notebooks 
become thinner. Intel added what it calls a 
new power-sharing framework to the module, 
consisting of a new connection between the 
processor, GPU, and memory. Just as a system 
can manage the processing workload 
between the three components, the new 
power framework can do the same for power 
management. 
Here, Intel’s software team plays a critical 
role, both in managing power as well as 
ensuring that the right drivers are in place for 
optimizing performance.
“If I look at this as one system with one 
driver package, with one Intel-delivered 
driver set, we’re able to apply things like our 
Dynamic Platform Framework,” Walker said, 
referring to a set of Intel-designed thermal 
An example of the space savings Intel achieved by moving the CPU, Radeon GPU, and HBM inside the 
processor package.

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   17
management technologies that can manage 
the CPU, GPU, and memory simultaneously. 
The Dynamic Platform Framework will 
allow the system to tweak and balance the 
three platform components dynamically, 
based on workload, system state, the 
temperature of the PC chassis, and more. 
Naturally, tasks like movie playback will still be 
routed to the Core chip’s existing, integrated 
graphics core, Walker said. The integrated 
8th-gen Core chips (go.pcworld.com/8gen) 
already contain dedicated, optimized logic to 
play back 4K video using the HEVC or VP9 
codecs chosen by streaming content 
companies like Netflix and Amazon, while 
using minimal power.
One interesting wrinkle: Intel will be 
responsible for supplying the drivers for the 
Radeon GPU, though company engineers 
won’t write the original code. An 
Intel representative said they’re 
working closely with AMD’s 
Radeon business to supply “day 
one” drivers for new games, when 
those drivers become available. 
INTEL’S GRAPHICS 
BUSINESS IS ALIVE 
AND WELL
Speculation that Intel might license 
or outright buy AMD’s Radeon 
business has circulated for years, 
especially as AMD has struggled to 
achieve profitability. AMD, 
however, enjoyed a rare profit of $71 million 
on $1.64 billion revenue for the just-
completed third quarter, helped by sales of its 
Ryzen processors and Vega graphics chips. 
AMD’s semi-custom business, which usually 
sells chips to game consoles, could use a 
boost: It reported flat sales year-over-year. 
(AMD also said it closed an unspecified 
patent licensing transaction “which positively 
impacted revenue,” though officials 
confirmed that the Intel deal wasn’t it.)
It’s possible that the Core-Radeon 
(Core-R, perhaps?) deal may yield a 
longer-term relationship. But right now, 
AMD seems to be positioning it as a single 
contract with a customer, like any other.
“We’re constantly looking at different 
things inside AMD, but this is really Intel’s 
project,” said Scott Herkelman, the corporate 
Intel has dominated the PC graphics market, thanks to the inte-
grated graphics cores inside its Core processors.

vice president and general manager within 
the Radeon Gaming business unit within 
AMD. “It’s completely semicustom...I 
wouldn’t say that we’re going to take this and 
learn something from it. This is Intel’s project, 
and we’re helping them execute on it.”
Last January, speculation rose that Intel 
and AMD had signed a Radeon licensing deal 
(go.pcworld.com/deal), prompting talk that 
Intel might be preparing to lay off or 
otherwise get rid of its own integrated 
graphics development teams. Walker denied 
it. “Not at all,” he said. 
“As we drive mainstream thin and light to 
15mm and lower, the Intel UHD solution is still 
the market leader in terms of how graphics 
gets delivered on a PC platform,” Walker 
added. Nor has Intel licensed the EMIB 
technology to AMD, he said.
AMD representatives went further, stating 
that there is no patent or IP licensing in place 
between the two firms at all.
WHAT’S NEXT? 
ANSWERING THE 
QUESTIONS
Unfortunately, we still don’t know the answers 
to several basic questions: How fast will these 
new cores run? How many variants of these 
new Core-Radeon chips will there be? What 
Intel Core architecture—Kaby Lake, or Kaby 
Lake-R—are they based upon? Does HBM2 
memory confirm that the Radeon core is 
based upon the AMD “Vega” architecture, 
and how does it compare to existing chips? 
How much memory is inside the package? 
Will the new Core-Radeon modules 
incorporate AMD-specific features such as 
VSR, Eyefinity, and Async Compute? And, 
of course, how much will it all cost?
The latter two questions can be answered 
in broad strokes. The idea, according to an 
AMD representative, is that these notebooks 
won’t be priced in the value segment at all, 
but in the neighborhood of $1,200 to $1,400 
apiece. Meanwhile, Intel executives say that 
notebook PCs based on the new H-series, 
Core-Radeon modules will move gaming-
class graphics down from systems 26mm 
thick, to thin-and-light PCs at 16mm and 
even 11mm thick—that’s slimmer than the 
original 13-inch Apple MacBook Air, and 
priced accordingly.  
An AMD representative also said that 
there’s nothing prohibiting any AMD graphics 
technology like VSR from being included in 
the Core-Radeon chip—but that in terms of 
specifics, it’s up to Intel to decide. 
According to Intel representatives, we’ll 
get more of those answers closer to launch. For 
now, however, there’s the simple surprise that 
the two sides came together to make this 
happen. For those who have watched the 
acrimonious AMD-Intel relationship play out in 
court, in the market, and behind closed doors 
for several decades, even a limited contract 
seemed out of the realm of possibility. But now, 
who knows what the future holds?

Intel hires Radeon boss Raja 
Koduri to challenge AMD, Nvidia 
in high-end discrete graphics   
Forget low-end integrated graphics cores: Intel just declared war on the graphics  
market by hiring AMD’s graphics chief. BY MARK HACHMAN
I
ntel dropped a bombshell recently, 
confirming that the company has hired 
AMD’s former graphics guru, Raja 
Koduri, heading up a new group to 
design high-end discrete graphics for “a 
broad range of computing segments.”
Koduri, who will start in December, will 
head up the newly-formed Core and Visual 
Computing Group, Intel said. Koduri’s 
leaving AMD led to speculation that he 
would head to Nvidia or Intel, the other two 
leaders in the PC graphics space. What 
wasn’t known, though, was whether he 
would be involved in PC graphics, or 
something tangential, such as AI.
Intel, though, apparently hasn’t given up 
on the PC. Intel representatives declined to 
confirm whether Koduri’s new role as head of 
IMAGE: INTEL

INTEL HIRES RADEON BOSS
the Core and Visual Computing Group will 
specifically include PC graphics, but his new 
title certainly implies it.
“We have exciting plans to aggressively 
expand our computing and graphics 
capabilities and build on our very strong and 
broad differentiated IP foundation,” said 
Murthy Renduchintala, Intel’s chief 
engineering officer, in a statement. “With 
Raja at the helm of our Core and Visual 
Computing Group, we will add to our 
portfolio of unmatched capabilities, advance 
our strategy to lead in computing and 
graphics, and ultimately be the driving 
force of the data revolution.”
Koduri has 25 years in the graphics 
business, most recently leading AMD’s 
effort to develop its own high-end 
graphics chip, known as “Vega”  
(go.pcworld.com/vega).
“I have admired Intel as a technology 
leader and have had fruitful collaborations 
with the company over the years,” Koduri said 
in a statement. “I am incredibly excited to join 
the Intel team and have the opportunity to 
drive a unified architecture vision across its 
world-leading IP portfolio that help’s 
accelerate the data revolution.”
AMD, who will now have to find a 
replacement for Koduri, seemed to imply that 
the newfound spirit of detente that began 
with a joint Intel Core-AMD Radeon chip (see 
page 13) may be over. Now, the two 
companies could be back at it in court. “We 
have a very strong graphics team and will 
continue our focus on building great 
products,” an AMD spokesman said in a 
statement to VentureBeat. “We also have 
industry-leading graphics [intellectual 
property] IP and, if necessary, will 
vigorously defend it.”
In addition, an AMD spokesman told 
PCWorld: “It is standard practice for all AMD 
employees to sign an agreement that 
includes post-employment confidentiality and 
non-solicitation obligations. Other companies 
are familiar with this requirement and they 
understand their legal obligation to protect 
and maintain the confidentiality of AMD’s 
information and ensure compliance with 
non-solicitation obligations.  AMD fully 
anticipates that any well-represented and 
well-advised company would not seek to 
taint their own intellectual property by 
attempting to use or access AMD’s 
confidential information or IP. The industry 
is well aware that AMD has industry-leading 
graphics IP and, if necessary, we will 
vigorously defend it.” 
What this means for you: Oh, wow. Oh, 
WOW. Nvidia and AMD just got some new 
competition in the graphics space. What 
isn’t known in whether this will include the 
PC, but it could. Color us really, really, 
excited—but let’s hope that the 
competition happens in the marketplace, 
and not the courtroom.

oogle is taking aim at one of 
the biggest scourges of the 
modern web. Starting in 
January 2018, the Chrome 
browser will automatically block noisy 
autoplay video on webpages. 
“One of the most frequent user concerns 
is unexpected media playback, which can use 
data, consume power, and make unwanted 
noise while browsing,” Google wrote in a 
blog post (go.pcworld.com/auto). “To 
address this, Chrome will be making autoplay 
more consistent with user expectations and 
will give users more control over audio.”
In Chrome 64, autoplaying videos will 
be blocked by default unless they’re muted,

or if “the user has 
indicated an interest 
in the media.” That 
means autoplay will 
be allowed for a site if 
you’ve frequently 
played a video on it 
or added the site to 
your mobile 
homepage. You 
won’t need to 
manually play every 
YouTube video or 
Twitch stream you 
select, in other words. Autoplay will also be 
enabled if you “clicked somewhere on the 
site during the browsing session”.
If you want to start blocking unwanted 
audio from autoplay videos today, try Avram 
Piltch’s Silent Site Sound Blocker extension 
(go.pcworld.com/sssb) for Chrome. Apple’s 
Safari 11 browser has also allowed users to 
easily stop autoplay videos (go.pcworld.
com/stau) since it launched with macOS 
High Sierra on September 25.
MUTE WEBSITES  
IN CHROME
Google’s paving the path for the wonderful-
sounding feature by adding the ability to 
completely mute all audio for a given website 
in Chrome 63, which is currently in the testing 
phase. The disabling will continue between 
browsing sessions. 
To activate page-muting when Chrome 
63 goes live, load the website you want to 
disable audio for, click on the Page Info 
bubble to the left of the URL, and look for 
the Sound option. 
The story behind the story: Noisy autoplay 
videos aren’t the only online bane in 
Google’s sights. Native ad-blocking 
capabilities (go.pcworld.com/nabc) are 
coming to Chrome soon. “We plan to have 
Chrome stop showing ads (including those 
owned or served by Google) on websites 
that are not compliant with the Better Ads 
Standards (go.pcworld.com/bett) starting 
in early 2018,” Google’s Sridhar 
Ramaswamy announced earlier this year. 
Chrome’s ad-blocker won’t eliminate all 
ads—only the most distracting and 
burdensome ones.

KRACK Wi-Fi attack threatens 
all networks: How to stay safe 
and what you need to know 
Update all the things. BY BRAD CHACOS AND MICHAEL SIMON
A 
devastating flaw in Wi-Fi’s WPA 
(go.pcworld.com/wipa) 
security protocol makes it 
possible for attackers to 
eavesdrop on your data when you connect to 
Wi-Fi. Dubbed KRACK, the issue affects the 
Wi-Fi protocol itself—not specific products or 
implementations—and “works against all 
modern protected Wi-Fi networks,” 
according to Mathy Vanhoef (go.pcworld.
com/vanh), the researcher that discovered it. 
That means that if your device uses Wi-Fi, 
KRACK likely impacts it. Fortunately, major 
tech companies are moving quickly to patch 

24   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
NEWS
KRACK WI-FI ATTACK
the issue.
Read on for what you need to know about 
the KRACK Wi-Fi vulnerability, from how it 
works to how to best protect yourself against 
it. That starts with updating to iOS 11.1 (go.
pcworld.com/os11) and macOS 10.13.1 (go.
pcworld.com/os13) for Apple users, and 
installing the Android November security 
patch for Pixel and Nexus devices. 
HOW DOES KRACK BREAK 
WI‑FI SECURITY?
KRACK (short for, uh, Key Reinstallation 
AttaCK) targets the third step in a four-way 
authentication “handshake” performed when 
your Wi-Fi client device attempts to connect 
to a protected Wi-Fi network. The encryption 
key can be resent multiple times during step 
three, and if attackers collect and replay those 
retransmissions in particular ways, Wi-Fi 
security encryption can be broken.
That’s the CliffsNotes version. For a 
more technically detailed explanation, 
check out Mathy Vanhoef’s KRACK attacks 
website (go.pcworld.com/atta). 
WHAT DEVICES ARE 
AFFECTED BY KRACK?
If your device uses Wi-Fi, it’s likely vulnerable 
to the KRACK Wi-Fi security flaw to some 
degree, though some get it worse than 
others. We go into greater detail about how 
particular devices are affected by KRACK in a 
dedicated section further below. 

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   25
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
WI-FI SECURITY IS BROKEN?
For starters, the attacker can eavesdrop on all 
traffic you send over the network. “This can 
be abused to steal sensitive information such 
as credit card numbers, passwords, chat 
messages, emails, photos, and so on,” 
Vanhoef explains. For a deeper look at the 
potential impact, check out PCWorld’s 
article on what an eavesdropper sees 
when you use an unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot 
(go.pcworld.com/unse). It’s a few years 
old, but still illuminating.
The United States Computer Emergency 
Readiness Team also issued this warning as 
part of its KRACK security advisory, per Ars 
Technica (go.pcworld.com/secu): “The 
impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities 
includes decryption, packet replay, TCP 
connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, 
and others.” HTTP content injection means 
the attacker could sneak code into the 
websites you’re looking at to infect your PC 
with ransomware or malware.
So yeah, it’s bad. Keep your security 
shields active, just in case. PCWorld’s guide 
to the best antivirus software (go.pcworld.
com/soft) can help you select a reliable 
solution if needed.
IS WI-FI SECURITY BEING 
BROKEN IN THE WILD?
“We are not in a position to determine if this 
vulnerability has been (or is being) actively 
exploited in the wild,” Vanhoef says. 
US-CERT’s advisory didn’t include any 
information about whether KRACK is being 
exploited in the wild, either.
Now for some somewhat settling 
news: Iron Group CTO Alex Hudson says  
(go.pcworld.com/iron) an attacker needs to 
be in range of your Wi-Fi network to carry 
out any nefarious plans with KRACK. “You’re 
not suddenly vulnerable to everyone on the 
internet,” he says.
HOW TO PROTECT 
YOURSELF FROM 
KRACK’S WI-FI FLAW
Keep your devices up to date! Vanhoef says, 
“implementations can be patched in a 
backwards-compatible manner.” That 
means your device can download an update 
that protects against KRACK and still 
communicate with unpatched hardware 
while being protected from the security flaw. 
Given the potential reach of KRACK, patches 
are coming quickly from many major 
hardware and operating system vendors. 
Up-to-date Windows PCs, for example, are 
“The impact of exploiting these 
vulnerabilities includes 
decryption, packet replay, TCP 
connection hijacking, HTTP 
content injection, and others.”

KRACK WI-FI ATTACK
already protected. 
Until those 
updates appear 
for other devices, 
consumers can still 
take steps to 
safeguard against 
KRACK. The 
easiest thing 
would be to 
simply use a wired 
ethernet 
connection, or 
stick to your 
cellular 
connection on a phone. That’s not always 
possible though.  
If you need to use a public Wi-Fi hotspot—
even one that’s password-protected—stick 
to websites that use HTTPS encryption. 
Secure websites are still secure even with 
Wi-Fi security broken. The URLs of 
encrypted websites will start with HTTPS, 
while unsecured websites are prefaced by 
HTTP. The Electronic Frontier 
Foundation’s superb HTTPS Everywhere 
browser plug-in (go.pcworld.com/http) can 
force all sites that offer HTTPS encryption to 
use that protection. Alternatively, you can 
hop on a virtual private network (VPN) to 
hide all of your network traffic. Don’t trust 
random free VPNs, though—they could be 
after your data as well. PCWorld’s guide to the 
best VPN services (go.pcworld.com/serv) 
can help you pick out a trustworthy 
provider. And again, keep your antivirus 
software (go.pcworld.com/s0ft) up to 
date to protect against potential code 
injected malware.
Going forward, the Wi-Fi Alliance  
(go.pcworld.com/a11i) will require testing for 
the KRACK WPA2 vulnerability in its global 
certification lab network, so new devices will 
be protected out of the box.
DEVICE AND ROUTER WI-FI 
SECURITY FAQ
Is my phone at risk?
KRACK is a different sort of attack than 
previous exploits, in that it doesn’t go after 
devices, it goes after the information you use 
them to send. So while the data stored on 
your phone is safe from hacking, whenever 

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   27
you use it to send a credit card number, 
password, email, or message over Wi-Fi, 
that data could be stolen.
So my router is vulnerable?
That’s closer, but still not totally accurate. 
It’s not the device that’s at risk, it’s the 
information, so the sites you visit that 
aren’t HTTPS are most vulnerable. 
So I should change my Wi-Fi password?
Well, you can, but it’s not going to stop the 
likelihood of attack. The exploit targets 
information that should have been encrypted 
by your router, so the attacker doesn’t need 
to crack your password to implement it. In 
fact, it has no bearing on the attack. 
So all devices are at risk?
Now you’re getting it. However, while any 
device that sends and receives data over 
Wi-Fi is at risk, the researchers who uncovered 
the attack said Android devices were more at 
risk than other mobile phones.
Great, I have an Android phone. But I’m 
running Nougat so I’m safe, right?
Unfortunately, no. Newer phones running 
Android 6.0 or later are actually more at risk 
since there is an existing vulnerability in the 
code that compounds the issue and makes it 
easier to “intercept and manipulate traffic.”
Google expected to have a security patch 
ready by mid-November, which would 
promptly roll out to Pixel and Nexus devices. 
But it could take weeks or even months for 
Android hardware makers and cellular 
providers to validate and deploy the patch 
to other phones and tablets. Many devices, 
especially older ones, may never receive 
the update.
So are my iPhone and Mac safe?
Safer than Android, but still not entirely safe. 
Apple rolled out fixes for KRACK in iOS, 
macOS, watchOS, and tvOS over the  
past month.
What about Windows PCs?
They’re safe if you stayed updated. Microsoft 
released a Windows patch (go.pcworld.com/
patc) to protect against KRACK on October 
10, before the vulnerability was made public.
I run Linux. Am I impenetrable to attack?
Not quite. Researchers actually found that 
Linux machines were the most vulnerable 
desktop devices, with a similar bug to the 
one found in the Android code. Now for 
the good news: An upstream Linux patch (go.
pcworld.com/upli) is already available, as are

open router firmware has designed a patch 
(go.pcworld.com/dwrt), but it isn’t available 
to download yet. Expect it soon.
So should I turn off Wi-Fi? 
That’s probably not a viable option for most 
people, but if you’re completely panic-
stricken, then the only way to be completely 
safe is to avoid using Wi-Fi until you know 
your router has been patched.

RIP Windows phones: New

RIP WINDOWS PHONE
It’s the first time a senior Microsoft 
employee has said that flat-out, but it’s not the 
first time one has been so blunt about 
Microsoft’s mobile hardware prospects. “If 
you wanted to reach a lot of phone 
customers, Windows Phone isn’t the way to 
do it,” Windows chief Terry Myerson told the 
Verge (go.pcworld.com/tery) in 2016, while 
essentially putting Windows Phones on hold 
(go.pcworld.com/hold) for the year. That 
hiatus now appears more permanent.
The downfall of Windows 10 Mobile 
seems to stem from our biggest gripe with 
the platform: The near-absolute lack of apps. 
“We have tried VERY HARD to incent app 
devs,” Belfiore writes (go.pcworld.com/
devs). “Paid money...wrote apps [for] them...
but volume of users is too low for most 
companies to invest.”
Belfiore’s Twitter posts come mere days 
after HP told The Verge (go.pcworld.com/
hpto) that it no longer plans to develop an 
extended line of devices around its Elite X3 
handset, the last great Windows Phone 
flagship (go.pcworld.com/flag). Earlier this 
year, the Windows 10 Creators Update cut 
off 40 percent of Windows phone owners 
(go.pcworld.com/cu40) from upgrades, and 
the company reported “negligible revenue

years (go.pcworld.com/yers) of laying off

WHY MICROSOFT IS KILLING 
WINDOWS PHONES
There’s a reason for those defections. 
Windows phone hardware may be on the way 
out, but Microsoft’s mobile ambitions aren’t 
obsolete. They’ve just shifted to software.
During Satya Nadella’s reign as Microsoft 
CEO, the company has shifted gears from 
focusing on mobile Windows hardware to 
bringing Microsoft’s key software to every 
available platform. Office, OneNote, 
Outlook, and even Xbox can be found on 
both iOS and Android; we’ve even done a 
feature on using Microsoft apps on Android 
phones (go.pcworld.com/miap). Android’s 
core interface doesn’t resemble the unique 
look and feel of Windows phones 
whatsoever, but if you load one up with 
Microsoft’s apps, you’ll get a damned fine 
experience nonetheless.
Just last week, Microsoft released a 
beta version of Windows 10’s Edge 
browser for mobile devices (go.pcworld.
com/mode), along with the Microsoft 
Launcher for Android. 
Both will intertwine 
deeply with the 
Windows 10 Fall 
Creators Update (go.
pcworld.com/fa11), 
allowing you to 
seamlessly pick up what 
you were working on 
regardless of whether 
you’re using your phone 
or your PC. The physical 
body may be dead, but 
the spirit of Windows 
phones lives on—
though you have to 
wonder what this means 
for the future of universal 
Windows apps (go.

Intel 8th-gen Core i7: What 
happens when thin laptops  
get quad-core speed
Don’t buy a new ultraportable laptop or MacBook Air until you read this story (seriously). 
BY GORDON MAH UNG  
I
ntel’s ntel’s 8th-generation Core CPUs 
solve a problem for the superlight 
(sub-three-pound) laptops that are 
becoming increasingly popular. Up 
to now, these laptops could handle only 
dual-core CPUs, because quad-core CPUs 
created more heat than their slimmer profiles 
could manage. That’s all changing with Intel’s 
ground breaking 8th-gen mobile CPU.  
Quad-cores once confined only to much 
larger and heavier laptops can now be stuffed 
into a tiny laptop, or so the company claims. 
But can the 8th-gen CPUs actually give 
you the performance you expect and you’re 
paying for? Or this is this just a cynical 
attempt to sell you on some quasi-

LAPTOP CPU REVIEWS 
AREN’T EASY: HOW WE 
DID IT
Unlike desktop CPUs, laptop CPU 
performance has always been a tricky task, 
as isolating the CPU is nigh impossible. 
Different laptop manufacturers will set the 
CPU to run at different speeds based on how 
much cooling they stuff into it, or how loud 
they want the fans to run at.
Basically, trying to compare an 8th‑gen 
Dell XPS 13 to a 7th‑gen Acer or HP 
introduces so many variables out of your 
control that it can be difficult to render a final 
decision. There is one way to get you closer, 
though: Compare the same laptop models 
made by the same manufacturer.
That’s exactly what we did this time, using 
Dell’s newest XPS 13 with a Core i7‑8550U 
inside ($1,300 and up on Dell.com (go.
pcworld.com/xp13)). To this, we compared 
a Dell XPS 13 with a 7th gen Core i7‑7500U. 
For context we also lumped in the original 
Broadwell‑based XPS 13 from 2015. 
Although outfitted with “only” a Core i5, 
we included it because it was also the 
model that first ushered in the zero‑bezel 
“Infinity bezel” design.
And because we all want to know how the 
8th gen hangs with “real” quad‑core CPUs, 
we also include two Dell XPS 15 models with 
much more powerful quad‑core CPUs and 
GPUs inside. That’s right, we’re pitting 
smaller, lighter laptops with lower‑power 
15‑watt TDP CPUs against large laptops with 
45‑watt TDP CPUs, but they’re all quad‑core.  
One last important important point we’ll 
make: All of the laptops here were updated 
with the latest version of Windows 10 
available to them, as well the latest drivers 
and BIOSes. This is actually a very critical step 
for trying to dive into direct CPU 
comparisons, because drivers and BIOS 
versions can have huge impacts on 
performance. A laptop can launch and six 
months later, the OEM could decide to 
increase or decrease the performance based 
on customer complaints about temperature, 
fan noise or performance.
With that said, only the XPS 13 laptops 
Intel’s 8th-gen Core i7 promises to bring quad-
core performance to ultra-portable laptops.

installed. Microsoft, it appears, did not deem 
the XPS 15s worthy.
CINEBENCH R15 
PERFORMANCE
Our first test is Cinebench R15. It’s a popular 
test built by Maxon and is based on the 
engine that runs its professional Cinema4D 
3D rendering engine. The test concentrates 
on the CPU and is heavily 
multi-threaded.
The results speak for 
themselves. Anyone who 
thought Intel couldn’t pull off a 
quad-core in a 2.5-pound 
laptop has to eat their wordss 
as the Core i7-8550U simply 
destroys the 7th-gen Core i7 
dual-core CPU, and for the 
most part hangs surprisingly 
well with the much hotter 
45-watt quad-core chips in the 
two XPS 15 laptops. What does 
this mean? It simply means that 
Intel’s new 8th gen is fast.
Cinebench R15 also allows 
us to test performance of the 
application in single-threaded 
tasks, so we threw the switch 
and ran all five laptops through 
the same task. The real surprise 
is the winner. You’d think it 
would be the Core i7-7700HQ 
in the newest XPS 15, but no, it’s the new 
Core i7-8550U in the XPS 13.
Okay, what’s really going on here? Well, if 
you look at the detailed specs in the Intel ARK 
chart (or click  go.pcworld.com/c0mp to see 
them) you can see that the new Core 
i7-8550U has a higher turbo boost speed of 
4GHz, compared to the 3.8GHz boost speed 
of the Core i7-7700HQ. Cinebench R15 
clearly shows that boost speed can pay off.

focuses on the CPU. We again see the 
8th-gen quad-core Core i7-8550U easily 
blowing away the older 7th-gen dual-core 
and hanging with the much hotter 45-watt 
quad-cores. Like Cinebench, the POV 
benchmark can use a single compute thread. 
The result places the new 8th-gen Core 
i7-8550U in a good place, just behind the 
Core i7-7700HQ in the XPS 15. 
Note how the 6th-gen quad-
core Core i7-6700K actually 
falls in line just behind the 
dual-core Core i7-7500U. 
Because both CPUs have the 
same boost clock of 3.5GHz, 
we’re not surprised. This 
is, again, a very good 
showing for the 8th-gen Core 
i7-8550U chip.

INTEL 8TH-GENERATION CORE I7
Geekbench has been controversial at times 
(go.pcworld.com/cont), it’s mostly only when 
enthusiasts try to point to it as proof that a 
tablet chip is as fast or faster than a desktop 
chip. We won’t rehash all of that, but we will 
say the test is far more relevant when it’s kept 
on the same CPU microarchitecture. That is, 
of course, what we do here, as we stick solely 
to testing XPS 13 and XPS 15 laptops.
The results in Geekbench’s multi-core test 
speak well for the 8th gen Core i7-8550U. It 
runs dead even with the 6th-gen quad-core 
Skylake chip. And yes, it simply leaves the 
dual-core chips in the dust.
Moving on to Geekbench’s single-core 
performance test, we again see the spunky 
XPS 13 hanging with the XPS 15. For the most 
part, the test puts all of the Core i7 CPUs in 
the same neighborhood. We’d tend to agree 
with that assessment, too because you’d be 
hard-pressed to tell the 
difference between a 7th-gen 
Core i7 and an 8th-gen Core i7 
when using, say, Outlook.
7-ZIP 
PERFORMANCE
As another sanity check on the 
performance results we saw from 
the previous tests, we also ran 
the internal benchmark for 7-Zip, 
a free file compression utility. (If 
you’re still using Window’s build 
in compression/decompression 
utility, go download 7-Zip now. 
It’s much, much faster.) The 
results from this real-world 
application pretty much mirrors 
what we’ve seen already: a 
complete dusting of the 7th-gen 
Core i7 by the 8th-gen Core i7.
7-Zip also allows for a 
single-threaded or single-core 
test. The results again mirror

VERACRYPT 
PERFORMANCE
We tried another internal 
benchmark, this one from the 
VeraCrypt free encryption program 
that’s a fork of the departed 
TrueCrypt. For the most part, both 
of the XPS 15s are dead even. No 
surprise, the 8th-gen Core i7 is just 
a step back from those quad-core 
laptops. And yes, dual-core, call us 
up when you cross the finish line.
HANDBRAKE 
PERFORMANCE
Although the performance of the 
8th-gen Core i7-8550U looks 
downright spectacular, one thing 
we wanted to know is whether it 
could hold its performance on 
workloads that didn’t last 5 
seconds or 50 seconds. Laptop 
CPUs are especially sensitive to 
thermal limitations, and long 
workloads generally means less 
performance. Our Handbrake test 
is thus perfectly suited to see what 
kind of performance you can 
expect on a very long task. On a 
dual-core, it can take an hour and a 
half to complete, for example. On

very challenged laptops, we often see pretty 
large hits to performance as it heats up.
The results here are, frankly, impressive. 
We say that because the Core i7-8550U has a 
processor base frequency of 1.8GHz. That’s 
basically the minimum clock speed the CPU 
would run at under the worst-case scenario, 
and certainly something we thought it would 
hit with a long workload. 
Instead, the 8th-gen Core i7-8550U 
inside the XPS 13 again surprises us by 
destroying the 7th-gen dual-core Core 
i7-7500U. For the most part, it hangs with the 
quad-core XPS 15 laptops, though having a 
larger, beefier laptop with a much larger 
cooling system remains an advantage. Still, 
for the size of the XPS 13, its performance in 
Handbrake is very, very respectable.
GAMING PERFORMANCE: 
SAME OLD, SAME OLD
The 8th-gen Core i7-8550U’s gaming 
performance is nothing to write home about. 
And it shouldn’t be, as it’s very much the 
same graphics core as the previous chip. We 
ran 3DMark’s Skydiver 1.0 test and then 
focused on the graphics 
performance results. This ignores 
the extra x86 cores it has, so 
consider it a pure test of the 
graphics subsystem. The 8th-gen 
chip’s UHD 620 graphics core 
come out slightly ahead of the 
7th-gen’s HD 620 graphics core, 
but for the most part they’re pretty 
close. Intel basic IGP is adequate 
for entry-level or low-ambition 
gaming. Don’t expect much more 
without stepping up to an Iris 
Plus-based CPU or discrete 
graphics chip.

test is not a CPU test. It’s a video rundown 
test. We charge the laptop’s battery to full, 
then unplug it and run a 4K movie (Tears of 
Steel) repeatedly until the laptop dies. The 
laptop’s brightness is set to 250-260 nits, 
audio is on, earbuds are used, and airplane 
mode is engaged. The video, for the most 
part, runs entirely within the media engine of 
the CPU, so whether it has four cores or two 
cores shouldn’t matter that much. 
Although the last few generations of XPS 
13s look the same on the outside, internal 
differences in screen resolution, touch 
support, and other components can play a 
huge part in the results. For example, the 
8th-gen XPS 13 has a 1920x1080 non-touch 
screen, while the 7th-gen XPS has a 4K 
3840x2160 panel with touch. Higher-
resolution screens tend to suck a lot of power.
Still, there is something to be gleaned 
from the results. For kicks, we 
also found a 7th-generation 
Core i7-7200U with a similar-
resolution screen to the current 
8th-gen model we’re testing. 
The results are pretty promising: 
While the 7th-generation XPS 13 
with the same resolution screen 
gives us about 11 hours of 
battery life, the 8th-gen laptop 
finishes at about 12 hours, 
second only to the much older 
Broadwell XPS 13.
If you’re wondering why the 
Broadwell-based XPS 13 does so we well 
despite having a smaller battery our guess 
is the amount of RAM and the SSD, as well 
as any differences from the CPU and 
motherboard. That particular XPS 13 has 
only 4GB of RAM instead of the 8GB the 
8th-gen and 7th-gen XPS 13 models have. 
System RAM does eat power, so having 
double the amount of RAM could be a drag 
on battery. We also suspect the SATA-based 
M.2 SSD and its rated active power 
consumption of 190 milliwatts, vs. the 
4-watt power consumption of the Toshiba 
XG5 NVMe SSD in the 8th-gen XPS 13, 
make a difference.
And if you’re wondering how much of a 
hit you take from a higher-resolution, touch 
screen, just look at the bottom of the chart 
below to see how well the touch-based, 
higher-resolution laptops did.

INTEL 8TH-GENERATION CORE I7
THE 8TH-GEN CAN BE 
FASTER ON LIGHTER LOADS
We’ve been playing with Cinebench’s 
ability to vary the thread load to try to 
simulate just what kind of performance you 
get as you slide the load on the CPU from one 
to eight threads.
Running Cinebench on the laptops, we 
can see the latest 8th-gen Core i7 surprisingly 
has a performance advantage on very light 
workloads. At the far right side of the chart 
though, the 15-watt chip can’t keep up with 
the 45-watt chips, falling into third place.
The good news is fourth place is not even 
in this race. This is a good show for the 
8th-gen quad-core Core i7.
The 8th-gen Core i7-8550U’s biggest 
advantage lies in clock speeds. Remember, it 
has a turbo boost 
rating of 4GHz vs. the 
3.8GHz of the Core 
i7-7700HQ and the 
3.5GHz of the Core 
i7-6700HQ.
To see how the 
clock speeds react 
under loads, we again 
looked what the 
various laptops hit 10 
seconds into a 
Cinebench R15 run. 
You can see just how 
much of a clock speed 
advantage the 8th-gen 
Core i7-8550U holds over all others on those 
light loads just a few seconds into a test. 
Note: In the chart opposite, we’ve focused on 
clock speeds from 2GHz to 4GHz to make it 
easier to read.
But the thing is, once you warm that tiny 
XPS 13, it’s not going to sit at those ultra-high 
clock speeds for long. So we decided to 
record the clock speed the various XPS 
models would hold for the entire benchmark 
run. On a single-threaded workload, the 
8th-gen Core i7-8550U has no problems 
running at 4GHz. Once we move it to two 
threads and then three threads, the chip 
burns through its very high burst mode faster 
than a nerd eats Doritos. 
In fact, the quad-core 8th-gen Core 
i7-8550U pretty much matches the dual-core 
Running Cinebench, the 8th-gen Core CPU excels at light loads. 

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   43
As the test progresses and we add more threads, the 8th-gen CPU’s 
clock speed drops precipitously.
7th-gen Core i7-7500U on two and three 
threads and then falls below it on four 
threads. It also falls below Kaby Lake and 
Skylake quad-core CPUs.
So yes, a 45-watt TDP with better 
cooling is going to be faster than a 15-watt 
one in a smaller, thinner laptop.
WHAT ABOUT RYZEN 7 
MOBILE VS 8TH GEN  
CORE i7?
There is one question left outstanding, and 
that’s AMD’s recent announcement of its 
Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 mobile CPUs (go.
pcworld.com/mcpu). AMD says Vega 
goodness plus Zen goodness will equal a 
new mobile CPU to give 8th-gen laptops a 
serious run for the money while using similar 
or less power. We haven’t seen these new 
Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 laptops up close yet, 
though, so until the company can prove it, 
and prove it in laptops people might want to 
buy, we’ll have to wait and see.
CONCLUSION
There’s only one way to describe our 
experience with the Core i7-8550U inside the 
Dell XPS 13: Impressed. No wait, damned 
impressed would be a better way to couch it. 
For years Intel’s CPUs in Ultrabooks have 
improved mostly incrementally, from 4th-gen 
Haswell to 5th-gen Broadwell, to 6th-gen 
Skylake. Sure, 7th-gen Kaby Lake represented a 
healthy bump over Broadwell, but not like this.
The 8th-gen Kaby Lake refresh, as it’s 
called, is a quantum leap forward for ultra-
portable laptops. You’ve simply never been 
able to get this kind of performance from 
something so small before. Yes, it’s that good.
Remember that this is just one example. 
Unlike desktops, where the 
variance from CPU to CPU is 
minuscule, laptop cooling 
designs and decisions on 
fan noise and thermals will 
likely have a huge impact on 
the new 8th-gen CPU’s 
performance.
But in this Dell XPS 13, 
the 8th gen Core i7 simply 
rocks. A full review of the 
laptop is forthcoming, but 
as you’ve already seen, this 
thing is fast.

The best free Microsoft Office 
alternatives of 2017   
Battle of the free office suites. BY MICHAEL ANSALDO
M
icrosoft Office is the king of 
office productivity suites, but 
it doesn’t inspire warm, fuzzy 
feelings in all users. Parsing 
the ever-expanding list of features can feel like 
stepping into a cockpit without a pilot’s 
license. The ribbon interface, introduced a 
decade ago, has many fans, but others pine 
for the static menus of the early aughts. And 
then there’s Office’s hefty price tag.
Fortunately, alternatives abound, ranging 
from web apps to freemium and open source 

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   45
desktop installations, many of which are 
compatible with Microsoft Office docs. 
We compared six of the most popular free 
office suites to see how well they replicate 
the most commonly used features of 
Microsoft Office.
WHAT TO LOOK
When evaluating Office alternatives, don’t 
look to replicate every feature, just the ones 
you need and use most. Depending on your 
situation, that could be robust spreadsheet 
calculations and dynamic presentation design 
or the ability to access files from anywhere 
and share them with remote team members. 
Keep these considerations in mind:
The big three: Though Microsoft Office has 
expanded over the years to include 
programs like Outlook, Access, and Publisher, 
its bread and butter is still its original trio of 
programs: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. 
That’s because nearly everyone uses these 
three apps regardless of the nature of their 
work. For many of us, they are the only 
three we need in a suite.
Office compatibility: Most of the working 
world will continue to use Microsoft Office 
long after you’ve jumped ship. That means 
you’ll still have to work with official Office 
files. Look for a suite that can cleanly read and 
write Microsoft Office formats, from the 
current DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX file types to 
legacy formats.
Interface: The way you access an office 
suite’s features matters as much as the features 
themselves. Polarized opinions about Office’s 
ribbon toolbar underscore this. Make sure 
you’re comfortable with the way a suite lays 
out its tools and that you don’t have to dig too 
deeply for those you’ll use a lot.
Collaboration capability: The irony that we 
still rely on “office” suites when many of us 
no longer work in physical offices means the 
ability to collaborate remotely with others is 
now a required feature. If you don’t want to 
have to email documents back and forth for 
editing—which can play havoc with version 
control —you’ll need an alternative that 
includes cloud support for sharing files and 
ideally the ability to co-author (i.e. make edits 
and comments on a document) in real time.
APACHE OPEN OFFICE
Price: Free
Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux
Open Office (go.pcworld.com/opff) was the 
first legitimate free contender to Microsoft 
Office, though it has ceded that spotlight in 
recent years to alternatives like Google Docs, 
Sheets, and Slides, and its own spinoff 
product LibreOffice. The open source suite 
includes word processing (Write), 
spreadsheets (Calc), presentation (Impress), 
and database management (Base) programs, 
along with drawing and math apps that don’t 
have a direct Microsoft corollary.

Open Office works with most Microsoft 
formats including DOCX, XLS, PPT, and XML. 
Hands on
If you still remember how Microsoft Office 
looked circa 2003, Open Office’s interface 
will seem eerily familiar. The component 
programs make no concessions to the trendy 
ribbon interface, using only old-school menus 
and toolbars. That’s good news if you’re still 
sore over Microsoft’s decade-old UI 
makeover, but it can take some readjusting if 
you’re now accustomed to tabbing around 
your document and spreadsheet programs.
By default, Open Office uses the Open 
Document standard for native files, but you 
can change it to save to Microsoft formats, 
and it can read and write existing Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint files. It does so 
flawlessly most of the time, even with 
complexly formatted documents like resumes 
and multi-column newsletters. Occasionally, it 
will hiccup as when it removed all the 
embedded images from a Word doc I had 
open. But those instances usually only require 
minor tweaks to correct. You can also export 
files to PDF from all three programs.
Where Open Office diverges from 
Microsoft’s productivity suite is in 
collaboration. MS Office’s tight integration 
with OneDrive and Outlook allows you to 
easily share and work on files with others 
without leaving the respective program. 
Open Office supports document review 
Open Office has excellent compatibility with Office formats and can export to PDF from all three apps.

that lets you 
connect to dozens 
of third-party cloud 
storage providers 
including Box and

like Mozilla Thunderbird.
Standout features

Apache Open Office is best for:
If you just need to work with Microsoft Office 
formats, and you don’t mind a dated 
interface, Open Office has all the

you need. If you need to collaborate with 
others on those files, though, there are other 
office alternatives that make it much easier.

Once considered merely a lightweight 
web-based alternative to Microsoft Office, 
Google’s trio of office apps (go.pcworld.
com/gdss) has grown into a worthwhile 
productivity suite in its own right. Though its 
capabilities still aren’t quite as robust as most 
desktop office suites, its tight ties to other 
Google products and extendability through 
a growing market of Chrome extensions 
make it a powerful, cost-effective option for 
students and workers.
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are free 
to use by anyone with a web browser, a 
Google account, and an internet connection.

The subscription-based G Suite, which adds 
more business-oriented features, is available 
in three pricing tiers for organizations.
Hands on
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides maintains a 
consistent look across its three component 
apps. Elegant and unadorned, the interface 
has clearly labeled menus with intuitive 
toolbar icons. All three apps also have a 
healthy set of hotkeys—accessible by typing 
Ctrl-/ on a PC or Command-/ on a Mac—for 
those who prefer to keep their fingers on the 
keyboard.
Any files you work on in the suite have to 
be stored in Google Drive, the search giant’s 
popular cloud storage. New Docs, Sheets, 
and Slides files are automatically created in 
your Drive account, and you can also upload 
Microsoft Office files for editing. All your 
changes are saved to Drive as long as you’re 
online; you can install a Chrome browser 
extension (go.pcworld.com/chbe) to edit 
files offline, but it requires some configuring 
and it only works with native Docs, Sheets, 
and Slides files.
The respective apps do an admirable job 
of importing Word and PowerPoint files, 
though you sometimes have to tweak 
elements in the latter. Importing Excel files to 
Sheets is more of a mixed bag, with 
spreadsheets containing basic functions 
translating more faithfully than larger, more 
complex ones.
The suite still shines brightest as a 
collaborative tool for written documents, 
thanks to features like real-time commenting, 
revision tracking, and deep integration with 
Google Drive cloud storage. It’s also 
intimately connected to Google search, 
allowing you to search for information 
relative to what you’re working on from 
within the individual apps.
Standout features
• Excellent collaboration tools
•  Tight integration with other Google 
products
• Simple, fast interface
Missing features
• Extensive formatting options
• Offline editing capabilities
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is best for:
Road warriors, collaborative teams, and 
anyone else who needs the flexibility to work 
from multiple locations will get the most out 
of Google’s office suite. If your needs run to 
creating large, intricate documents; mail 
merges; or serious number crunching, you’ll 
likely find the suite’s capabilities limited and 
should look elsewhere.

budget, no-commitment, free productivity 
office suite,” and it’s not just hyperbole. The 
suite—comprised of the self-explanatory 
Writer, Spreadsheets, and Presentation 
apps—replicates most of the essential 
Microsoft Office features and adds a few 
unique extras. It also comes with 1GB of 
online storage, called WPS Cloud, for 
sharing documents.
If getting all this for free sounds to good to 
be true, there is a small caveat. The free 
version requires you to view ads to gain 
time-limited access to certain features like 
printing and exporting to PDF. The ads are 
short, around 10-seconds, but if you want to 
banish them for good, you can purchase the 
Premium version for a modest $30 per year. 
WPS Office is available for Windows and 
Linux and offers companion apps for iOS 
and Android.
Hands on
As Office alternatives go, none adhere as 
faithfully to the Microsoft suite as WPS Office. 
Its ribbon interface is nearly identical to 
Microsoft Office’s, with tabs and tools in 
roughly the same spots in all three of its apps. 
Never really dug that look? Don’t worry—the 
interface is customizable so you can turn 
back the clock to an Office 2003-style static 
menu interface with the click of a button. 
You customize each app’s interface 
You can customize WPS Office’s interface to use a ribbon toolbar or static menus a la Office 2003.

independently, so you can mix it up if different 
UIs work for you in different programs.
A few features you won’t find in Microsoft 
Office make working with documents even 
easier. All three apps support tabbed 
documents, eliminating the hassle of toggling 
between multiple document windows. WPS 
Writer includes a feature called Paragraph 
Layout that lets you adjust line and paragraph 
spacing and indents with a drag-and-drop 
tool. And Section Navigation lets you quickly 
jump around large documents.
Compatibility with Office files is excellent 
across all three apps, with Presentation 
standing out for accurately translating 
PowerPoint files better than any other non-
Microsoft product we tested. There’s also 
scads of templates—over 100 in Writer 
alone—for all kinds of personal and 
business documents.
WPS Office has limited collaboration 
capabilities. Document-reviewing features 
like commenting and track changes are 
included, and you can share files with others 
via link through WPS Cloud, but real-time 
co-authoring is not supported.
Standout features
•  Customizable interface
•  Excellent Office compatibility
•  1GB cloud storage for sharing files
Missing features
•  Real-time co-authoring

If you love everything about Microsoft Office 
except the price, you’ll likely love WPS Office. 
While it doesn’t support real-time 
collaboration, neither do most desktop Office 
alternatives; if that’s a priority you’ll have to 
look to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides or 
Microsoft Office Online. Otherwise, this suite 
has everything else you could ask for in an 
Office alternative, and if the ads ever become 
an annoyance, you can always upgrade to the 
premium version for a very modest fee.
LIBREOFFICE 5
Price: Free
Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux
LibreOffice (go.pcworld.com/liof) came to 
be when the community developing Open 
Office jumped ship several years back and 
created their own suite on the same code. 
Without going in to the details of the divorce 
(go.pcworld.com/di00), suffice it to say 
LibreOffice has fared better than its ancestor, 
Document-reviewing features 
like commenting and track 
changes are included, and you

both in terms of 
development and 
popularity. Like 
Open Office, 
LibreOffice includes 
six programs: Write 
(word processing), 
Calc (spread-
sheets), Impress 
(presentation), Base 
(database 
management), 
Draw (vector 
graphics) and Math 
(mathematical 
formulae). 
Hands on
Because LibreOffice was forked off Open 
Office, there are, unsurprisingly, many 
similarities between the two. LibreOffice has 
the same Office 2003-style static menu look 
with easily navigated icons and toolbars. The 
only real difference is that it adds a splash of 
color akin to the current version of Microsoft 
Office and generally feels more polished.
LibreOffice uses open document format 
as its native format, but it can also read and 
write a range of Microsoft Office formats 
including the newer DOCX, PPT, and PPTX 
files. In our tests, it better handled the more 
complex documents that Open Office 
struggled with. The installed template 
selection pales compared to what you get 
with Microsoft Office, but you can beef it up 
with downloads from LibreOffice’s Extensions 
and Templates library.
There’s no native cloud integration, but 
LibreOffice does have a Remote Files feature 
that allows you to access files outside servers 
like Google Drive and OneDrive. That can 
facilitate sharing files for group review—track 
changes and commenting are supported—
but no real-time authoring.
Standout features
•  Fantastic compatibility with Microsoft 
Office formats
• Familiar Office-like interface
Missing features
•  Integrated cloud storage
•  Real-time co-authoring
LibreOffice seamlessly translates Office formats, including complex documents.

LibreOffice should be the choice of open 
source enthusiasts. Having relative feature 
parity with Open Office, it comes down to the 
release frequency of new features and fixes, 
and LibreOffice wins that race hands down. 
As of this writing, Open Office’s last update 
was a year ago; LibreOffice’s latest release 
came last month. That makes LibreOffice the 
obvious choice for businesses, schools, and 
anywhere else security is important. And if

MICROSOFT OFFICE ONLINE
Price: Free
Platform: Online
Not to be outdone by Google’s free online 
office suite, Microsoft offers its own gratis 
web-based apps in Microsoft Office Online 
(go.pcworld.com/mioo). The suite includes 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote and 
is accessible to anyone with a desktop 
browser. There are mobile versions of each 
app for iOS and Android, and a dedicated 
extension for Google’s Chrome browser.
Hands on
The app interfaces for Office Online look and 
navigate pretty much like their desktop 
counterparts, and therein lies the appeal. If 
you’re on the road or otherwise away from your 
trusty PC version of Word, you can open a doc 
in the web version of the app—no conversion 
required—and dive right in. As these apps are 
made for down-and-dirty editing, you’ll notice 
some omissions on the tool ribbon—the 
Designs, References, and Mailings tabs are 
gone from Word, for example—but all the basic 
functionality is accounted for.
As with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, 
Office Online works right inside your browser. 
Also like the Google suite, it requires your 
documents be uploaded to the cloud—in this 
case to Microsoft OneDrive—before you can 
edit them. If you lose internet access, there’s 
no way to work on those files offline without 
one of Microsoft’s paid Office products.
These slimmed down-versions of the big 
three productivity apps are aimed primarily at 
home users, so you won’t find pivot tables, 
fancy formatting options, or more advanced 
business-oriented capabilities. Many file 
formats that are supported in the desktop

no-charge version of 
SoftMaker Office 2016 
and offers its versions of 
Microsoft’s big three 
productivity apps in 
TextMaker (Word), 
PlanMaker (Excel), and 
Presentations 
(PowerPoint). It contains 
most of the features of 
the commercial 
product, but omits some key ones you can 
only get by upgrading to either SoftMaker 
Office Standard 2016 for $69.95 or 
SoftMaker Office Professional 2016 for 
$99.95. It’s available for Windows and Linux 
and has an Android companion app.
Hands on
FreeOffice employs a static-menu interface 
that should feel comfy to users who preferred 
the pre-ribbon Office look. Tools are 
intuitively organized and all three apps have a 
clean-and-light feeling about them. It’s more 
than cosmetic, too, as FreeOffice is 
exceptionally fast, even when working with 
data-dense spreadsheets.
FreeOffice provides excellent 
compatibility with Open Document format, as 
used by LibreOffice and OpenOffice, as well 
as the full spectrum of Microsoft Office 
formats, including password-protected files. 
However, newer Office formats including 
DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX can only be opened—
not saved—in the free version of the suite.
All three apps include advanced features 
similar to those of their Microsoft 
counterparts, including PDF creation, pivot 
tables, and interactive presentation 
capabilities, to name a few. Some other 
desirable features—tabbed documents, a 
thesaurus function, the ability to save modern 
Office formats—are reserved for the pay 
product, though.
As with most free desktop suites, 
collaboration is where FreeOffice falls short 
of Office. It includes track-changes and 
commenting features, but with no cloud 
support you can’t co-edit documents 
with others in real time.

busy toolbars, too.

Best antivirus: Keep your

A
ntivirus software ranks nearly as 
crucial as a PC’s operating 
system. No matter how careful 
you are, some threats can’t be 
prevented without the additional help of an 
antivirus program—or a full antivirus suite.
You could visit your favorite website when

program allows hackers to install other 
malware on your machine. 
Sure, PC security software isn’t fool-proof. 
Antivirus software often can’t do much to stop 
zero-day exploits, for example. But it can detect 
when the undisclosed vulnerability is used to 
install other nasty bits on your machine like 
ransomware. In general, the average user actively 
using email, clicking on links, and downloading 
programs will benefit from an antivirus suite.
So what should you pick? Our 
recommended suggestions strike a balance 
between excellent protection, a worthwhile 
selection of features, and minimal impact on 
your PC’s performance.
WHAT TO LOOK FOR
There are three basic requirements that an 
antivirus suite needs:
•  High detection rate for malware and 
other threats
•  Low impact on system resources
•  An easy-to-use interface
That’s not all to consider, however. These 
days, many security suites come with extras 
such as a backup service for your most 
essential files, Android apps for mobile 
security, a more advanced firewall, family 
protection (read: child restriction) features, 
and the right to use the program on multiple 
PCs. Whether you need those extras depends 
on your personal situation.
HOW WE TEST
First, we take a look at the interface to 
determine how easy or complicated it is. 
Does the interface make it easy to get at 
essential tools like PC scans and password 
managers, for example, or is everything 
buried under multiple clicks? Are there 
elements that look like they should be 
clickable but aren’t? Are alerts interactive or 
purely informational, and does that make 
sense in context?
We also examine the features on offer. 
Every good antivirus suite should have the 
basics like scanning and real-time protection, 
but many vendors offer elements that go 
beyond basic security like password 
managers or firewalls. We try to discern 
whether any of these extra features are 
particularly useful, or just frills that look nice 
but don’t serve a practical purpose.
To test the suite’s demand on system 
resources, we run two benchmarks. The first is 
PCMark 8’s Work Conventional test, which 
simulates a variety of workloads including 
editing spreadsheets, browsing the web, and 
running video chat. 
We run the benchmark before the 
security suite is installed. Then we install the 
software, have it run a full scan on our 
Windows 10 test machine, and start a 
second run of the benchmark at the same 
time. Then we compare the overall scores 
to see if the decline between the two 
benchmarks is significant.

BEST ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
As a harsher stress test, we also use 
Handbrake to transcode a video before and 
after installing the A/V. On most home PCs, 
this encoding task utilizes 100 percent of the 
CPU. We then compare transcoding times to 
see if there’s any significant decline.
Our test machine is an Acer Aspire E15 
with an Intel Core i3-7100U, 4GB RAM, and a 
1TB hard drive. Each security suite is tested on 
a clean install of Windows 10 Home.
As for the antivirus suite’s detection 
capabilities, we’ll rely on the opinions of 
security researchers dedicated to this task. 
We’ll take into consideration reports from 
outlets such as A-V Comparatives, A-V Test 
and SE Labs. 
We’ll also take pricing into account and 
what you get for it. Whenever possible we’ll 
review security suites using a free trial to get 
a sense of what consumers see when they 
first try out a new product.
AVAST PREMIER
Price: $80
Avast is one of the more 
popular free, third-party 
antivirus programs. For 
anyone willing to pay for more 
advanced features, 
however, Avast’s premium 
products also have a lot to 
offer. At the top of the 
company’s line-up is Avast 
Premier for $80 (go.pcworld.com/avap), 
which comes filled with features. Though it 
only offers two additional extras compared to 
Avast’s $60 Internet Security product (go.
pcworld.com/avis), those particular features 
are potentially useful for those who want 
them.
The first is Data Shredder, which deletes 
files by immediately overwriting them so they 
are not recoverable. The second is Software 
Updater, which automatically updates third-
party programs, plug-ins, and utilities on your 
PC. Both are nice features, however, you can 
use free programs to perform the same 
functions—like FileHippo App Manager (go.
pcworld.com/fihi), which monitors and 
automatically updates your programs.
Despite being packed with features, 
Avast manages to not overwhelm the user 
with a messy interface. The program uses a 
fairly standard design that includes a left rail 
Avast Internet Security’s “Status” section.

with a pop-out menu, and a 
main screen that displays 
the settings and primary 
interface for each feature.
The program also uses 
color effectively to help 
convey important 
information. The program’s 
primary background is a 
bluish gray, with the active 
section in the left rail 
highlighted in purple.
Avast Premier features 
four main categories: 
Status, Protection, Privacy, and Performance. 
The Status section is pretty simple with a basic 
green check mark when all is well. The main 
interface has one button to run a quick scan 
for viruses. This is also the section where you 
can get direct links to Avast’s catalog of 
Android and iOS apps.
Protection is where you can 
run antivirus scans, as well as 
get access to a roster of other 
security features. There’s 
Rescue Disk, which puts a 
version of Avast Antivirus on a 
CD or USB stick to more 
effectively scan and remove 
stubborn malware. You’ll also 
find Avast’s firewall settings, a 
Wi-Fi inspector, Real Site 
phishing protection, 
Ransomware Shield (which 
monitors specific folders for ransomware 
threats), the aforementioned software 
updater, and a sandbox to wall off suspect 
files from the rest of your PC.
The Privacy section includes Avast’s 
built-in password manager, Data Shredder, 
and Sensitive Data Shield. The latter probes

your machine for important 
documents, and then it 
adds extra monitoring and 
protection to those files to 
guard against malware. It 
also acts as a quick access 
list of your important files. 
There’s also a link to 
SecureLine VPN, but VPN 
service is not part of the 
Avast subscription. Instead, 
your prompted to pay extra 
for the VPN.
Finally, there’s the 
Performance section with 
only two features. The first is Cleanup, which 
is similar to programs like CCleaner that scan 
your system for extra files, temporary folders, 
and caches that can be cleared. Although it 
looks like it’s included, Cleanup only scans 
your PC for free. To actually cleanup your PC, 
you need to shell out cash for Cleanup 
Premium.
Performance also houses the settings for 
Avast’s gaming mode. This feature 
automatically detects when you’re playing a 
game and forces Avast and Windows to 
reduce its resource footprint—allowing you to 
play your game unencumbered.
Installing Avast Premier is very easy and 
using the free trial does not require you to 
register with the company. Ironically, Avast 
tries to install extra software at installation—
something a security suite should guard 
against. In the case of our test PC, it was 
Google Chrome. On a system with Chrome 
already installed, Avast offered to install its 
own secure browser, SafeZone. Later on, I 
noticed that Avast installed two Chrome 
extensions: Avast Online Security and Avast 
SafePrice. I don’t recall explicitly agreeing to 
install either of them.
Avast makes it easy to opt-out of this 
download, but it’s also easy for users to get a 
surprise Chrome install if they’re not paying 
close attention.
Performance
As one of the top security firms, Avast 
performs very well. In A-V Test’s June test of 
zero days, web, and email threats, Avast 
scored a perfect 100 percent. Regular 
malware scans also did well, scoring 100

don’t have it.

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   61
percent against more than 10,000 samples.
Avast performed similarly high during A-V 
Comparatives’ evaluation. It scored 100 
percent in the organization’s malicious URL 
test and 99.8 percent against nearly 38,000 
malware samples. In A-V Comparatives’ 
offline test, that detection number dropped 
slightly to 98.8 percent.
SE Labs gave Avast a AAA rating, noting 
that it and AVG were the most effective free 
products. Avast and AVG did fail to stop five 
targeted attacks in SE Labs’ tests.
During our benchmarks, Avast had no 
drop in performance. When we ran PCMark 
8’s Work Conventional test—a simulation of 
web browsing, video chat, word processing, 
and spreadsheet editing—without Avast 
running, our test PC netted a score of 2517. 
With Avast running, it got 2515, which is 
well within the standard margin of error.
In our more-punishing 
Handbrake test, our test PC 
typically takes one hour, 
fifteen minutes, and 30 
seconds to transcode a 
3.8GB MKV file using the 
Android Tablet preset. With 
Avast installed the file took 
one hour, fifteen minutes, 
and five seconds.
We also looked at how 
Avast’s Sensitive Data 
Shield performed, since 
that feature is likely to be 
intriguing to most users. It did a good job, 
though there were a high number of false 
positives. For example, it included many 
Word documents in the “Employee 
documents” section likely because they were 
my old articles with company names in the 
title. Avast also inspected folders that weren’t 
even on my PC via the Keybase.io desktop 
program for Windows (go.pcworld.com/
keyb). That is admittedly an edge case as 
Keybase is a niche program. Nevertheless, if 
you are a Keybase user, turn off the program 
before scanning for sensitive documents.
Conclusion
Avast Premier is a very well-designed program 
with all kinds of extra features that will appeal 
to security conscious users looking for more 
than just antivirus protection. But if you don’t 
mind the inconvenience, you can get an 
Avast Internet Security’s Data Shredder feature.

AVG INTERNET SECURITY
Price: $70
AVG has a big advantage in the free antivirus 
space since it owns both Avast (acquired in 
2016 (go.pcworld.com/ac16)) and its 
homegrown product, AVG Free. The hope is 
you’ll love the free stuff so much that you’ll 
upgrade to one of its paid products.
In the case of AVG, most people go with 
its Internet Security program (go.pcworld.
com/insp). Priced at $70, it’s one step down 
from the company’s flagship product, AVG 
Ultimate, and lacks a number of Ultimate’s less 
crucial features. For example, you don’t get 
AVG’s PC tune up package or third-party 
desktop software updater. That’s hardly a loss, 
though, as you can find free programs to 
dump cached folders taking up too much 
space or monitor software updates. The 
important security features are all included in 
the $70 security suite, however, including 
antivirus, firewall, and phishing protection.
Unlike Avast, AVG opted not to include a 
password manager as part of its various 
security packages. Instead, you have to fork 
AVG Internet Security’s primary dashboard and menu.

over an extra $20 per year to make that a part 
of your security set-up. That’s not a bad price, 
though for a few bucks more you can get an 
annual subscription to LastPass.
When you first open up AVG, it offers a 
similar aesthetic to its corporate counterpart 
Avast. The app largely has a gray background 
with bright green to highlight important 
information. You’ll first see a status dashboard 
that lets you know which AVG security 
features are active.
This dashboard is not intuitive, though. 
Almost nothing is clickable in the main part of 
the screen. To tweak most options, you have 
to click on the Menu hamburger icon at the 
top right of the window. There you can get 
into the nitty gritty of the application’s 
settings, including general options, controls 
for ransomware protection, a data safe 
(encrypted folders), and a file 
shredder feature that overwrites 
deleted data to make it harder to 
recover.
Overall, the settings could be 
better organized and made clearer. 
Most of the key settings you’ll want 
to access, for example, are under 
Menu > Settings > Components. 
From there you can tweak your 
firewall and play with the spam 
scanning settings.
Reinforcing my point about 
organization is how the options are 
laid out. Each part of the 
component settings is hidden under a 
downward facing arrow. Click that arrow and 
you reveal each section’s panel, but all you’ll 
see is an explanation of the feature and an 
option to uninstall individual parts of the 
security suite. To actually get deeper into 
those firewall settings, you have to click the 
Customize link in each tile, which is never 
hidden.
To access other options, like subscription 
information, you’ll have to go back to the 
main dashboard. In the upper left hand 
corner is an arrow—when you click on it, it 
opens another window where you can add 
another device to your subscription, as well 
as download and subscribe to other AVG 
products such as PC TuneUp, Secure VPN, 
and Password Protection. This window is very 
reminiscent of Norton Security.

AVG’s overall interface is not a deal 
breaker, and once you get used to the logic 
of the application, it’s not hard to navigate. 
However, during testing I often kept 
thinking about its Avast counterpart, which I 
found to be far more intuitive with items 
more readily accessible and not buried 
under a mountain of clicks.
One thing that AVG Internet Security does 
make very easy is the ability to scan your PC, 
as the Scan Computer button is the most 
prominent item on the primary dashboard.
Performance
Like many of the mainstream security 
programs, AVG got very high marks for 
antivirus and malware protection. A-V Test’s 
August tests gave AVG 100 percent detection 
in its 0-day and malware tests. In A-V 
Comparatives’ real-world protection test, 
meanwhile, AVG scored 
100 percent as well with 
three false positives out 
of 329 samples. When

scored 99.8 percent in 
an online scan against 
nearly 38,000 samples 
and 98.8 percent offline.
SE Labs gave AVG an 
AAA rating, saying that 
both it and Avast were 
the most effective free software in its tests, but 
AVG did fail to detect five targeted attacks. All 
three organizations used the free versions of 
AVG’s antivirus, which doesn’t have the 
ransomware, firewall, or phishing protection.
AVG also did well in our performance 
benchmarks. When we ran PCMark 8’s Work 
Conventional test (a simulation of everyday 
tasks like word processing, web browsing, 
and video chat), our initial score was 2521. 
With AVG running in the background, that 
score was 2524—a tiny enough difference 
that the improvement could be chalked up to 
margin of error.
Our Handbrake test, which puts much 
more stress on a system, showed no 
significant performance dip. Our Windows 10 
PC takes an average of one hour, 15 minutes, 
and 30 seconds to transcode a 3.8GB MKV 
file using the Android Tablet preset. With AVG

installed, Handbrake transcoded the same file 
in one hour, 15 minutes, and 25 seconds.
Conclusion
AVG leaves a lot to be desired when it comes 
to app design, especially compared to Avast. 
Given that the same company owns both 
development teams, we hope to see some 
improvement. Nevertheless, AVG gets high 
marks for security, has enough features to 
satisfy most users, and doesn’t drag on your 
performance.
COMODO INTERNET 
SECURITY PRO 10
Price: $40
When we previously looked at Comodo’s 
Internet Security Pro, the company had a 
habit of bundling software with its security 
suite—and that trend hasn’t changed with 
Internet Security Pro 10. Underneath the 
hassle of warding off extra installs, however, is 
a security suite that does a good job of 
detecting threats.
When you install Internet Security Pro 10, 
you have to read every screen very carefully. If 
you don’t, the program will attempt to set 
your browser’s homepage and search engine 
to Yahoo, change your DNS provider to 
Comodo (go.pcworld.com/dnsp), set 
Comodo Dragon (go.pcworld.com/cmdr) as 
your default browser, and import all the data 
from your current default browser.
Certainly, some users might like all that. 
Comodo Secure DNS is a popular choice 
among security enthusiasts who don’t want 
to use their ISP’s default service. Other 
security suites also route your DNS through 
their services. As for the browser, Comodo 
Dragon is a Chromium-based browser that 
some users might enjoy, and I guess there’s 
nothing wrong with Yahoo if you ignore 
that whole appalling security issue (go.
pcworld.com/apse).
But here’s the thing: Most people will click 
through the install screens without reading 
them, and software companies count on that. 
It’s just...unseemly. Plus, the attempt to switch 
your search engine and homepage makes all 
the other extra software look hostile. This 
approach is just not a good idea, even when 
acknowledging that companies are trying to 
make a buck. There has to be a better way.

As for the app 
itself, Comodo 
Internet Security Pro 
has some nice 
features. Comodo’s 
interface comes in 
three parts: the 
main application 
window, a widget 
that sits in the upper 
right corner of your 
desktop, and the 
system tray icon.
That’s a lot, but 
you can close the 
main window and get rid of the widget quite 
easily, leaving only the system tray icon. The 
widget, though, might be appreciated by 
some users as it has easy access to Comodo’s 
primary features.
At the very top there’s a status icon telling 
you the state of your PC. (Before 
running your first scan, it’s 
yellow.) Below that is a counter 
informing you of your current 
bandwidth usage for both up 
and down streams.
Then there’s a mini-
dashboard shows the status of 
Comodo’s containment tasks (a 
feature that lets you run 
untrusted apps as well as 
browsers in a virtualized space); 
the number of tasks the security 
software is currently running; and a listing of 
suspect files. That last feature isn’t particularly 
great, given that Comodo treated the EXE 
files for two common and popular services—
CrashPlan and Slack—as suspect.
The widget also has quick access to 
Comodo’s four basic operations: scan, 
unblock applications, update, and secure 
shopping. Finally, you’ll see the symbols for 
all of your installed browsers if you’re using 
any of the big four: Internet Explorer, 
Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, plus Comodo 
Dragon. There isn’t an icon for Edge on 
Windows 10 PCs.
If you open any of these browsers from the 
widget, they launch in a security container—
one of those virtualized environments that are 
sandboxed from the rest of the PC. When you 
run a browser in one of these containers, the 
entire window will be outlined in green. 
Oddly, Edge has a tab inside the Internet

Security Pro’s desktop 
widget in Windows.

Explorer container that is 
supposed to launch the 
newer browser. It doesn’t 
work, however. As for other, 
lesser known browsers like 
Vivaldi, Comodo ignores 
them.
This containers feature is 
supposed to keep you more 
secure, and it does seem to 
be a fine feature. However, 
during one test, my PC 
became unusable after 
enabling Internet Explorer in 
a secure container. Comodo’s secure 
shopping feature also inexplicably ate up 25 
percent of my CPU resources even though I 
hadn’t activated it, and I had to restart my PC.
Comodo’s main application is really just a 
bigger version of the widget. It has the same 
four main options: scan, unblock applications, 
update, and secure shopping.
Scan opens a second window where you 
can choose carry out a full scan, quick scan, a 
“rating scan” for commonly infected areas, or 
a customized scan. Unblock Applications is 
where you can re-enable any desktop 
programs that Comodo may have prevented 
from running. Update lets you manually 
check for new virus definitions. Secure 
Shopping, meanwhile, is a virtualized, 
sandboxed desktop environment where you 
can only access Windows File Explorer and a 
select number of installed browsers that 
launch in incognito mode. The idea is to 
create a secure space where you can do 
online shopping.
Overall, the basic look of Comodo 
Internet Security Pro is clean and easy to 
understand. If it’s too basic, however, there’s 
also an advanced view that provides a lot 
more at-a-glance data. It includes firewall 
details, a list of enabled services, blocked 
applications or network intrusions, and other 
information. Personally, I prefer the advanced 
view since it behaves like a security 
dashboard for your system. It also has a nice 
drag-and-drop area to scan files for viruses.
Performance
Comodo has a reputation for being 
something of a resource hog. That perception 
is less deserved these days, but we still found 
some truth to it.

BEST ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
During our first performance test, which 
checks how an antivirus program affects 
system resources during lighter tasks, 
Comodo held its own against the 
competition. When we fired up PCMark 8’s 
Work Conventional benchmark, the synthetic 
simulation of word processing, spreadsheet 
editing, web browsing, and video chat 
churned out a score of 2507. After starting an 
antivirus scan, the second score for PCM8 
was 2535—ever so slightly within Comodo’s 
favor, though not significant because the 
number falls within normal margin of error.
However, when we moved on to our more 
strenuous Handbrake benchmark, Comodo 
caused a notable drop in performance. On 
our test PC, Handbrake v0.9.9 typically takes 
an hour, fifteen minutes, and thirty seconds to 
transcode a 3.8GB MKV file to MP4 using the 
Android Tablet preset. With Comodo 
running, that same file conversion took one 
hour,  forty-one minutes, and 31 seconds. 
That 34.4 percent increase in time is the 
worst Handbrake result of the antivirus 
suites we’ve tested thus far.
As for virus detection, A-V Test rated 
Comodo’s Internet Security Premium quite 
high, with 100 percent detection against 
real-world threats like malware attacks and 
web and email threats. Virus detection, 
meanwhile, was equally high at 99.9 percent. 
A-V Comparatives did not test Comodo’s 
performance—the organization only tests 
security suites that are submitted to it by the 
vendor—nor did SE Labs.
Conclusion
Comodo’s antivirus and malware detection is 
fine, but it has some of the lowest-scoring 
benchmark performance results we’ve seen 
so far. However, this program does have a 
very nice price of $40 per year for three 
devices. If you don’t mind the slip in 
performance for resource-intensive 
operations, then Comodo is a fine choice. For 
those with mid-range PCs, however, you’d do 
well to look elsewhere.

it’s still one of the best. Currently, Symantec 
offers several versions of its long-lived 
antivirus software: The current flagship 
product is Norton Security Premium (go.
pcworld.com/nosp), which costs $110 per 
year. Following that are Norton Deluxe (go.
pcworld.com/node) ($90/year), Norton 
Security Standard (go.pcworld.com/noss) 
($70/year), and Norton Antivirus Basic (go.
pcworld.com/noab) ($50/year). 
This review covers the top dog among the 
set, Norton Security Premium. Downloading 
and installing it is simple enough, and the 
program doesn’t try to add a lot to your 
system outside of the program itself. It does, 
however, encourage you to enable its own 
browser-based password manager once 
you’re up and running.
One of Norton’s standout aspects is its 
unobtrusiveness. Outside of a small cluster 
of  notifications when you first install it, the 
program doesn’t inundate you with constant 
pop-ups. The interface is also very clean and 
easy to use, though the settings for each 
category aren’t immediately obvious. (You’ll 
have to click on a downward-facing arrow 
on the far right side of the screen.)
Norton Premium’s dashboard is divided 
into four main categories: Security, Identity, 
Backup, and Performance. There’s also a fifth 
section that houses account management, 
access to extra features, and ads for more

Norton services and 
apps. Like many antivirus 
programs, Norton 
Security uses a color-
coded scheme where 
green means you’re 
protected, yellow means 
caution, and red means 
you’re not protected.
The Security section 
is the most important 
section for PC users, as it 
houses the settings for 
regular PC scans. By 
default Norton will do a 
quick scan, but there are also options for full 
and customized scans. There’s also a feature 
called Power Eraser that is supposed to 
eliminate “difficult-to-detect threats.”
The Identity section, meanwhile is about 
protecting you. You’ll find the anti-phishing 
settings here, as well as Norton’s “Identity 
Safe,” which is the desktop version of the 
built-in password manager. Like other 
services, the safe can house your username, 
passwords, addresses, credit card 
information, and secure notes. Norton does 
have a nice tags feature to help you better 
organize your data, which you won’t always 
find in all password managers.
Backup is where Norton lets you setup 
and manage the 25GB of free cloud storage 
that comes with the suite. You can use it to 
upload files or folders to Norton’s servers via 
encrypted incremental backups. When you 
activate the feature, Norton monitors your 
documents, pictures, contacts, and other 
items by default. It will not, however, backup 
your videos by default or any email databases 
you may have.
Performance, meanwhile, is the least 
useful of the categories, since its features are 
mostly redundant. You’ll find options like a 
file cleanup utility, disk defragmenter, and a 
tool for restricting startup programs—all tools 
that come built into Windows. If you want to 
stop programs from starting up at boot, for 
example, the Task Manager in Windows 8.1 
will work just fine. The Backup section does 
have a graph that details the current 
processor usage of Norton and Windows, 
as well as recent security events and alerts 
from Norton.

Performance
Norton Premium 22.9 received high marks 
from both A-V Test and A-V Comparatives for 
malware detection. In June, A-V Test threw 
10,252 samples of malware at Norton and the 
software came back with a 99.9 percent 
detection rate. A-V Test also put Norton up 
against 202 samples of zero-day, web, and 
email threats for which Norton came back 
with a 100 percent rating.
A-V Comparatives got a similar result of 
99.8 percent in March using nearly 38,000 
samples. However, that was with an active 
Internet connection: Offline, that detection 
rate fell to 86.8 percent. SE Labs, meanwhile, 
gave Norton a AAA rating.
Those are all great results. The only 
concerning aspect would perhaps be the 
offline detection rate, though you could 
ameliorate it with other tools such as 
Windows Defender periodic scanning or 
Malwarebytes. (Or just never go 
offline—kidding!)
Norton did not have an appreciable drain 
on resources. When we ran PCMark 8’s Work 
Conventional benchmark, which simulates 
basic tasks like spreadsheet editing, web 
browsing, and video chat, our test PC scored 
2538 without Norton installed. When we 
installed Norton Security Premium, started a 
full scan, and then ran PCMark 8 again, the 
second score was 2526. That’s a drop of less

than one percent and within the PCMark 8 
benchmark’s typical margin of error.
We also didn’t see any real difference in 
performance during our Handbrake test, 
which puts far more stress on a system. It took 
our test PC one hour, fifteen minutes, and 30 
seconds to transcode a 3.8GB MKV file. With 
Norton installed, the time was twenty-two 
seconds faster at 1:15:08.
Conclusion
Norton is extremely user friendly and well 
organized, and it doesn’t interfere too much 
with users’ day-to-day activities. That last part 
is key since security programs work best 
when they stay out of your way. The software 
also has some handy extras, like the online 
backup and password manager that make it 
an all-in-one security suite.
You certainly have to pay for the privilege, 
however. Symantec will give you a 
really nice discount for your first 
year—45 percent off—but don’t 
be fooled, as you’ll ultimately be 
paying $110 for the privilege of 
running Norton Security Premium.
WINDOWS 
DEFENDER
Price: Free
In 2006, Microsoft added built-in 
security software to Windows for 
the first time. Since then, it’s 
appeared under various names, but currently 
it’s known as Windows Defender Security 
Center (go.pcworld.com/wdsc) (WDSC). 
What started out as a basic antivirus detection 
feature has slowly grown into something that 
resembles a security suite. It doesn’t have 
anything close to the features you’d see in a 
third-party suite, but it does a fair job at 
antivirus and malware scanning.
Briefly, however, WDSC has five sections: 
Virus & threat protection, Device performance 
& health, Firewall & network protection, App 
& browser control, and Family options.
The crucial section is Virus & threat 
protection. This is where you can manually 
start a full scan, enable real-time protection, 
or carry out an offline scan for removing 
particularly nasty bits of malware.
Device performance & health, meanwhile, 
just gives your PC a general health report card 
Windows Defender’s primary dashboard.

including Windows 
Update status, driver 
status, and so on. It 
does not report on any 
potential security 
weaknesses, short of 
lagging updates.
Firewall & network 
protection is fairly 
self-explanatory, while 
App & browser 
control houses all of 
your PC’s SmartScreen 
settings for Edge, 
downloads, and the 
Windows Store.
You can dive a little 
deeper into WDSC beyond this, but not by 
much. If I had to guess, Microsoft plans to 
expand its functionality over time, and right 
now we’re just seeing the basic scaffolding 
being built. That’s just speculation, however.
Performance
Windows Defender stacks up alright in anti-
virus detection. A-V Test gave Defender a 99 
percent detection rate for real-world testing 
against 0-day, web, and email threats.  For 
run-of-the-mill malware, meanwhile, Defender 
scored very highly against more than 10,000 
samples at 99.7 percent detection.
A-V Comparatives found a similarly high 
performance level for real-world protection, 
with about 9 false positives out of 329 test 
samples. SE Labs, for its part, gave Defender a 
AA overall rating in the period of April 
through June. (The highest that an antivirus 
can score with SE Labs is a AAA rating.) 
During its testing, Defender failed to protect 
against six targeted attacks and four web-
based attacks.
As for the drain on your PC’s resources, 
that’s a little harder to measure than with 
third-party software. WDSC is built right into 
the operating system and starts up 
automatically. To counteract that, we turned 
off the entirety of Windows Defender (both 
the scanning tool and the overall program) 
using the registry. Then we fired up our first 
benchmark: PCMark 8’s Work Conventional 
benchmark, which simulates everyday tasks 
Windows Defender’s device performance and health report.

REVIEWS
BEST ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
like video chatting, web browsing, and word 
processing, and recorded the score. 
Afterward, we switched WDSC back on and 
started a full system scan before running 
PCMark 8 again.
The results fell in line with the best third-
party options: Windows Defender had no real 
effect on performance. Running Windows 10 
with Defender off garnered a PCMark score of 
2498. Once it was back on, the score went 
up to 2516—right within the margin of error 
for PCMark 8 results.
That story also held true in our 
Handbrake performance benchmark, which 
puts far more strain on system resources. 
With Windows Defender turned off, we were 
able to transcode a 3.8GB MKV file on the 
Android Tablet preset in one hour, 14 
minutes, and 21 seconds. With Windows 
Defender turned on, it took one hour, 15 
minutes, and 30 seconds. That difference is 
so small it’s insignificant.
Conclusion
Windows Defender is a fine 
basic security solution. For 
advanced users who are 
hyper-aware about all the 
various threats out there, this 
free option might be enough if 
they also periodically scan their 
systems with something like the 
free version of Malwarebytes 
(go.pcworld.com/mlwb). The 
average user, however, should look for a more 
feature-rich third-party solution.

about a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti designed to 
slot between the two. Until AMD’s Radeon RX 
Vega graphics cards (go.pcworld.com/rxvg) 
launched.
The disappointing Vega 64 ran hot and 
loud while failing to best the GTX 1080. But 
the (theoretically (go.pcworld.com/rv56)) 
$400 Radeon Vega 56 proved much more 
appealing—and its performance outpunches 
the GTX 1070 in many games. Surprise! Two 
months later the $450 GeForce GTX 1070 Ti 
appears, at a price just below what the $470 
Vega 56 is actually selling for on the street.
But the quest to beat AMD puts the new 
hardware uncomfortably close to the GTX 
1080—and Nvidia surprisingly restricted the 
card’s clock speeds to keep the GTX 1070 Ti 
from cannibalizing its bigger sibling. Well, 
kind of. Find out all in our Nvidia GeForce 
GTX 1070 Ti Founders Edition ($450 on

GTX 1070 Ti SC Black Edition ($470 on 
Amazon (go.pcworld.com/70be)) review.
SPECS AND FEATURES
The only truly surprising technical feature of 
the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti is how little Nvidia 
pared down its year-and-a-half-old “GP104” 
GPU compared to the GTX 1080. The full 
version of GP104 inside the GTX 1080 
consists of 20 streaming multiprocessors 
(SMs) with 2,560 CUDA cores, while the GTX 
1070 Ti’s chip has 19 SMs and a whopping 
2,432 CUDA cores active. By comparison, 
the base GTX 1070 packs 15 SMs and just 
1,920 CUDA cores.
The GTX 1070 Ti’s clock speeds swipe 
aspects from both sides. Nvidia’s new 
graphics card ships with a 1,607MHz base 
clock and 1,683MHz boost clock. By 
comparison, the GTX 1070 clocks at 
1,506/1,683MHz, and the GTX 1080 hums 
along at 1,607/1,733MHz—at least on paper. 
In reality, Nvidia’s GPU Boost 3 technology 
runs these cards as fast as they’ll go while 
staying within optimal heat and power limits, 
especially in custom cards with powerful 
cooling solutions. But there’s an interesting 
twist to custom GTX 1070 Ti cards, which 
we’ll get into when we look at EVGA’s GTX 
1070 Ti Black Edition in just a bit.
Nvidia built the GTX 1070 Ti Founders 
Edition to overclock well, despite some 
(slightly) misguided early rumors that 
suggested clock speeds would be locked 
down. It’s equipped with the same vapor 
chamber cooler and five-phase dual-FET 
power design as the GTX 1080 has, both of

which aren’t found in the GTX 1070 vanilla. 
But the GTX 1070 Ti’s memory subsystem 
mirrors the baseline GTX 1070’s, ditching the 
GTX 1080’s speedy GDDR5X memory for 
standard GDDR5 VRAM over a 256-bit bus. 
Like the vanilla version, the GTX 1070 Ti offers 
256GBps of overall memory bandwidth, 
versus the GTX 1080’s 320GBps.
The Founders Edition card draws its 180W 
TDP through a single 8-pin power connector, 
and sports three DisplayPorts, an HDMI 2.0b 
port, and a dual-link DVI connection. The GTX 
1070 Ti also supports Nvidia’s GeForce 
Experience software, including GFE’s stellar 
Ansel and ShadowPlay Highlights tools (go.
pcworld.com/ansh)—features that actively 
makes your gaming experience more fun.
Nvidia’s aiming to eradicate the Radeon 
Vega 56’s lead in yet another way. While 
customized RX Vega graphics cards have yet 
to appear, months after AMD’s GPU released, 
a full range of custom GTX 1070 Ti cards will 
be available at launch.
We’re also reviewing the EVGA GTX 1070 
Ti SC Black Edition, which costs $20 more 
than Nvidia’s Founders Edition. The GTX 
1070 Ti SC Black Edition carries over the 
design from EVGA’s other Black Edition 
cards. In addition to a fancy LED logo and a 
5+1 power phase configuration that noses 
out the Founders Edition’s setup, it sports 
the same ACX 3.0 cooler that impressed us 
so much on the EVGA GTX 1080 FTW

later in our review. But perhaps the most 
interesting part of the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC 
Black Edition’s spec sheet is its clock speed 
rating: 1,607MHz base/1,683MHz boost 
“plus.” In fact, every card in EVGA’s GTX 1070 
Ti lineup—including the beefy, high-end $500 
FTW2 model (go.pcworld.com/ftw2)—lists 
the exact same clock speeds. And if you look 
at the clock speeds on custom GTX 1070 Ti 
graphics cards from other manufacturers, they 
all do too. What gives?
Simple: Nvidia isn’t allowing customized 
GTX 1070 Ti cards to be overclocked out of 
the box—presumably to keep overclocked 
versions of this step-down card from 
challenging the top-end GTX 1080. Here’s 
what Nvidia’s Bryan Del Rizzo said when I 
asked about it.
“GeForce GTX 1070 Ti lives in the small 
price band between the GTX 1070 and GTX 
1080. Given the number of products in this 
category we are aiming to simplify the 
stack-up, and let gamers get the extra 
performance through manual overclocking.”

Massive, massive bummer. But as he says, 
manual overclocking is still allowed, and 
because of that the restriction isn’t stopping 
Nvidia’s hardware partners from developing 
workarounds to drive their graphics cards to 
faster speeds.
HOW TO USE EVGA’S GTX 
1070 TI AUTO-
OVERCLOCKING TOOL
EVGA’s Precision XOC software is typically 
used by enthusiasts to overclock their 
GeForce graphics cards manually. But EVGA 
developed a new version of its Precision XOC 
(go.pcworld.com/px0c) overclocking and 
monitoring software with “an exclusive feature 
for the GTX 1070 Ti”: an auto-overclocking 
tool that scans your card and automatically 
applies an “optimal overclock” with no 
technical know-how needed on your end.
The packaging for the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti 
SC Black Edition (and its other GTX 1070 Ti 
models) includes a slip of paper with a QR 
code emblazoned on it, directing you to the 
company’s Precision XOC software. You’ll 
have to register with your name and email 
address to use the software, and the auto-
overclocking process requires you to input 
your card’s serial number, in case Q.A. help 
winds up being required. You can find the 
serial number on a sticker on the back of the 
EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC Black Edition as well 
as on the card’s box.
Precision XOC will automatically detect 
your GTX 1070 Ti the first time it launches and 
offer to “Run EVGA Precision XOC scanner” on 
it—that’s the auto-overclocking tool. Agree and 
you’ll be presented with three options. The 
quick scan cycles through preset overclocking 
ranges appropriate to your card, and takes 15 
to 20 minutes. A full scan 
thoroughly tests your 
hardware to create a custom 
overclock more precisely 
tuned to your particular 
graphics card, but it can take 
up to an hour. Finally, as 
always, you can manually 
overclock the EVGA GTX 
1070 Ti SC Black Edition.
I ran the quick scan on 
my model, as I’m guessing 
that’s what most people will 
do—and it was dead simple. 
The Precision XOC tool lets EVGA work around the GTX 1070 Ti’s clock 
speed lockdown, and the packaging materials make sure you know it.

NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070 TI
The EVGA Precision XOC Scanner ran for 17 
minutes, and then applied a solid +101MHz 
overclock to the card. In practice, that 
resulted in clock speeds of 1,924MHz to 
1,949MHz running The Division at 4K 
resolution, and up to 1,974MHz at 1440p.
You could no doubt push performance 
higher by manually tinkering with the card’s 
power target, overclock, and memory 
speeds, but a 101MHz boost is respectable 
indeed, and we used EVGA’s configured 
overclock to test the GTX 1070 Ti SC Black 
Edition in our performance benchmarks. A 
card like the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti FTW2 ($500 
on Amazon (go.pcworld.com/70ti)) could 
presumably hit even higher marks, as it 
includes EVGA’s revolutionary iCX cooling 
technology (go.pcworld.com/icxt) and a 
235-watt maximum power draw, compared 
to the SC Black Edition’s 217W. Cooling and 
available power can play a major difference 
in overclocking.
If you accidentally close the Precision XOC 
Scanner or want to run the auto-overclocking 
tool again, you can do so by clicking the 
yellow arrow icons in the software’s interface 
until you’re on the Basic OC Scanner page, 
then clicking Run. It’ll restart the process.
Whew, that was a long diversion—but a 
necessary one if you buy a custom GTX 1070 
Ti. Let’s dig into how this hardware handles!

We’re comparing the GTX 1070 cards

$499 air-cooled RX Vega 64. Both were 
benchmarked using the Balanced power 
profile on the stock BIOS. Of course, because 
the GTX 1070 Ti was designed to slot 
between the (theoretically (go.pcworld.com/
theo)) $350 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 (go.
pcworld.com/gt70) and $500 GTX 1080 (go.
pcworld.com/gt80), we’re testing those as 
well. All of the cards are reference models 
except the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC Black 
Edition (obviously), which we tested in both 
its out-of-the-box configuration as well as with 
Precision XOC’s new one-button overclock 
feature. We discussed the details of our 
overclock in the previous section.
Each game is tested using its in-game 
benchmark at the mentioned graphics 
presets, with VSync, frame rate caps, and all 
GPU vendor-specific technologies—like AMD 
TressFX, Nvidia GameWorks options, and 
FreeSync/G-Sync—disabled. Given the 
capabilities of these particular cards, we’re 
testing at 1440p and 4K resolutions alone. 
They’d all scream at 1080p. Every card was 
tested using the most current drivers 
available from AMD and Nvidia.

The Division
The Division ($50 on Amazon (go.pcworld.

RPG that mixes elements of Destiny and Gears 
of War, kicks things off with Ubisoft’s 
Snowdrop engine. We test the game in 
DirectX 11 mode.
The GTX 1070 Ti Founders Edition 
essentially draws even with the Radeon Vega

difference between the GTX 1070 and GTX 
1080. Out of the box, the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti

SC Black Edition does the same, 
but with Precision XOC’s auto-
overclock applied, it squeezes out 
a 4.5-percent frame rate increase 
at 1440p resolution.
Ghost Recon: Wildlands
Next up: Ghost Recon: Wildlands 
($60 on Amazon (go.pcworld.
com/ghre)), a stunningly beautiful 
and notoriously punishing game 
based on Ubisoft’s Anvil engine. 
Not even the GTX 1080 Ti can put 
in a decent showing at Ultra 
graphics settings at 4K, so we test 
at Very High, which “is targeted to 
high-end hardware.” It’s a game 
that includes some Nvidia 
GameWorks features, but again, 
we test with those disabled.
This strenuous game 
challenges all of these cards at 4K 
resolution. While the Radeon Vega 
56 barely surpassed the original 
GTX 1070 in performance, the GTX 
1070 Ti pushes straight past it, 
though once again the difference 
is less noticeable at 4K resolution. 
Once again, Nvidia’s GTX 1070 Ti 
Founders Edition falls in between 
its cousins. EVGA’s custom card 
doesn’t provide much uplift in this 
game even with the auto-applied 
overclock, but this game’s a beast.

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
Now it’s time for another 
graphically punishing game, but 
this one favors AMD hardware. 
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided ($15 on 
Amazon (go.pcworld.com/deus)) 
replaces Hitman in our test suite 
because its Dawn engine is based 
upon the Glacier Engine at 
Hitman’s heart. We dropped all the 
way down to the High graphics 
preset for this one and still 
struggled at 4K. We tested in 
DirectX 12 as that mode lifts all 
performance boats regardless 
of  which brand’s GPU sits at 
the heart of your graphics card.
Like I said: Deus Ex heavily 
favors AMD hardware, to the 
extent that the GTX 1080 barely 
stays ahead of even the Radeon 
Vega 56 at 1440p. That said, the 
GTX 1070 Ti puts up admirable 
numbers versus its AMD rival, 
which flat-out pummels the 
vanilla GTX 1070.

1070 Ti Black Edition manages 
to nudge that. We’re talking 
imperceptible zero to 4-fps 
differences from worst to 
best, though.
Ashes of the Singularity
Ashes of the Singularity ($40 on 
Steam (go.pcworld.com/ashs)), 
running on Oxide’s custom Nitrous 
engine, was an early standard-
bearer for DirectX 12. Many 
months later it’s still the premier 
game for seeing what next-gen 
graphics technologies have to 
offer. Nvidia drivers have greatly 
improved GeForce performance in 
Ashes over the past several 
months. We test the game using 
the High graphics setting, as the 
wildly strenuous Crazy and 
Extreme presets aren’t reflective of 
real-world usage scenarios.
This game traditionally favored 
Radeon hardware, but after a slew 
of DirectX 12 driver improvements 
by Nvidia, the GTX 1070 Ti trounces 
the Vega 56 and matches Vega 64 
in performance. The difference is 
even more pronounced if you don’t 
have Windows 10 and thus can’t 
utilize DX12. In DirectX 11, the 
GTX 1070 Ti beats Vega 56 by 
nearly 20 fps. Hot damn.

SPEEDS
Power
We test power under load by 
plugging the entire system into a 
Watts Up meter, running the 
intensive Division benchmark at 4K 
resolution, and noting the peak 
power draw. Idle power is 
measured after sitting on the 
Windows desktop for three 
minutes with no extra programs or 
processes running.
The Vega 64 still stands out as a 
ridiculous power hog, but the 
differences—or lack thereof—
between the GTX 1070 Ti and 
Radeon Vega 56 are more 
interesting. Because the GTX 1070 
Ti largely matches the GTX 1080’s 
GPU layout and uses GDDR5 
memory instead of power-efficient 
GDDR5X, it draws a lot more power 
than the vanilla GTX 1070 does. In 
fact, it ties the Vega 56 on that front.
Heat and noise
We test heat during the same 
intensive Division benchmark at a 
strenuous 4K resolution, by running 
SpeedFan in the background and 
noting the maximum GPU 
temperature once the run is over.

Again, the GTX 1070 Ti Founders Edition 
and Vega 56 are in a dead heat. Both cards 
use blower-style coolers, but despite the 
equality in temperature, Nvidia’s 
implementation is vastly superior to AMD’s. 
The ghastly Vega coolers are the loudest I’ve 
heard since the old Radeon 290X days. 
Seriously, it’s loud enough to distract you 
unless you’re wearing noise-proof 
headphones, and that’s rare in modern GPUs.
But the EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC Black 
Edition’s superb ACX 3.0 cooling solution 
stands heads-and-shoulders above the 
reference cards. It not only runs far, far chillier, 
it manages to run much quieter than the 
others while doing so. Two fans are better 
than one, it seems.

GEFORCE GTX 1070 TI VS 
RADEON VEGA 56
How does the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti compare 
to the Radeon Vega 56? The answer’s 
complicated, and made more so by 
cryptocurrency miners driving up prices in this 
market segment.
Nvidia met its goal. The GeForce GTX 
1070 Ti Founders Edition ($450 on Nvidia 
(go.pcworld.com/70fe)) matches or beats 
the Radeon Vega 56 in every game we tested 
except Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, which 
skews heavily towards AMD hardware. And it 
bests the AMD card heavily in Rise of the 
Tomb Raider and Ashes of the Singularity. But 
power and heat are a wash and the 
performance victories are minimal in most 
situations we’ve tested. Given that 
AMD’s glorious, tear- and stutter-
killing FreeSync variable refresh 
rate monitors (go.pcworld.com/
rate) are much more affordable 
than Nvidia’s comparable G-Sync 
displays, and the GTX 1070 Ti starts 
at $50 more than the Radeon RX 
Vega 56’s $400 suggested 
pricing, you can make an argument 
for these cards being of roughly 
equal value.
At least in theory.
In reality, the Radeon Vega 56 
has barely come close to 
approaching its suggested pricing 
since five minutes after the card

launched in August. Sure, there’s a Sapphire 
Vega 56 for $400 at Microcenter (go.
pcworld.com/ve56) right now, but that’s 
in-store pickup only and on “sale” from $530. 
As I’m writing this on November 1, there’s a 
single XFX Vega 56 available for $400 on 
Amazon (go.pcworld.com/xfxv) and $420 on 
Newegg (go.pcworld.com/xfxr), but all 
others cost more than $500... (go.pcworld.
com/alt5) and it just turned up at those prices 
today. I’ve been tracking Vega 56 prices on 
Newegg since the GTX 1070 Ti’s 
announcement last week, and most sold for 
$470—$20 more than Nvidia’s Founders 
Edition card, and the same price as the 
superior EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC Black Edition.  
The GTX 1070 Ti probably wouldn’t exist if 
Vega 56 didn’t exist, but it’s cards like the 
EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC Black Edition that make 
Vega 56 moot in today’s bizarre market. The 
world is still waiting for custom cards month 
after Vega’s launch. In the meantime, the 
Radeon Vega reference cooler sounds like a 
damned hurricane. That alone makes it 
impossible to recommend over EVGA’s (in 
reality) identically priced GTX 1070 Ti, which 
delivers more performance while staying cool 
and running awfully quiet.
If Radeon Vega 56 ever hits its suggested 
price and custom Vega cards become 
available for $450 or less, the FreeSync 
variable may tip the scales back in AMD’s 
favor. But that’s not the way of the world 
today.
SHOULD I BUY THE 
GEFORCE GTX 1070 TI?
So should you buy the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti? 
Even though we recommend it over the 
Radeon RX Vega 56, it’s still a complicated 
question influenced by the cryptocurrency 
problem, as miners drive up prices. Why do 
men decide?
If you look at PCWorld’s guide to the best

the benchmarks in this very article—you’ll see 
that the vanilla $380 GTX 1070 already excels

The GTX 1080, on the other hand, is best for 
high refresh-rate 1440p gaming. It can handle 
entry-level 4K gaming if you turn down some 
graphics settings, but true single-card 4K/60 
gaming requires the beastly $700 GTX 1080 
Ti (go.pcworld.com/80ti).
But most full-sized versions of the GTX 
1070 are selling for $430 or more on Newegg 
(go.pcworld.com/full) right now. (Damned 
miners!) The significant performance increase 
offered by the GTX 1070 Ti is well worth the 
$20 to $30 extra. But saving up even more 
pennies for the $500-plus GTX 1080 makes 
less sense. The GTX 1070 Ti is plenty fast for 
1440p gaming, and the biggest performance 
differences between the GTX 1070 Ti and 
GTX 1080 in our 4K tests 
are only about 5 fps. If 
you’re already turning 
down graphics settings to 
play games at 4K with the 
GTX 1080, you could 
save $50 and just turn 
anti-aliasing options 
down another notch on 
the GTX 1070 Ti instead.
In an ideal world—
where the GTX 1070, 
GTX 1080, and Radeon 
RX Vega 56 all sold for 
suggested pricing, and custom Vega cards 
were on store shelves—the GTX 1070 Ti 
would be a weird and largely irrelevant 
release, hampered by the crap Nvidia’s 
pulling with the clock speeds of custom 
cards. But here in the real world of today’s 
graphics card market, it’s the best 1440p 
graphics card option around. Unless 
cryptocurrency miners drive up its prices 
too,of course.
The slick-looking EVGA GTX 1070 Ti SC 
Black Edition ($470 on Amazon (go.pcworld.
com/70be)) easily justifies its modest $20 
upcharge thanks to its excellent ACX 3.0 
cooler and the one-touch ease with which 
Precision XOC negates Nvidia’s ugly, artificial 
clock speed lockdown in customized 
graphics cards. But be sure to download that 
overclocking software to get the most out of 
your hardware.

Adobe Premiere Elements 18 
(Windows): The best video 
editor does it all for you    
A no-brainer for novices, and handy for more experienced users, too. BY SAMUEL AXON
A
dobe Premiere Elements 2018 
offers most of the same basic 
video-editing features you’d 
find in other consumer 
packages, but it separates itself from the 
pack with tutorials and automatic curation 
and content-creation features that very 
nearly (but not quite) do all the work for 
you, as long as you don’t mind if your 
videos look generic.
It’s this easy access that makes Adobe 
Premiere Elements our top-rated consumer 
paid video editor. Read all of our video-
editing software reviews (go.pcworld.com/
vesr) to find out how we tested, what to 
look for, and more. 
The main video-editing interface is broken 
into three views: Quick, Guided, and Expert. 
Quick and Expert are basic versions of the 
same video-editing experience you get in most

other software. The latter exposes more 
options to you than the former.
Guided prompts you with a series of 
questions and holds your hand through 
common video-editing tasks like adding and 
arranging clips, trimming and splitting them, 
adding transitions, and adding titles.
Those are just the basics. Other guided 
walk-through categories include Video 
Adjustments, Audio Adjustments, and Fun 
Edits. The last of those includes common 
techniques like slow motion, freeze frames, 
and picture-in-picture. It can even generate 
those animated social videos that combine 
words and videos in your Facebook feed. 
Guided mode doesn’t necessarily create a 
usable video for you—think of it like a tutorial.
However, there are multiple modes that 
do most of the heavy lifting in cranking out 
videos for you. They include Favorite 
Moments, Instant Movie, and Video Story. 
Video Story, for example, can create a 
graduation video by letting you drag and 
drop clips right into the usual components of 
a video like that: dressing up, the speech, and 
so on. This can produce some very generic-
looking videos, but it does make things a lot 
easier. Other features allow you to create 
video collages automatically, or edit music 
files down to match the length of your video 
with only a couple of clicks.
But what really differentiates Adobe 
Premiere Elements from competing consumer 
video editors is its machine learning and AI 
features. A feature called Smart Trim intelligently 
grabs a bunch of short, Instagram-length mini 
videos from that 45 minutes of raw footage you 
imported. Another feature called Instant Movie 
lets you set some initial parameters and 
completely edits the video for you from 
provided media. We found this one to be very 
hit-and-miss: For example, it couldn’t tell if there 
was already music playing in a clip and just 
layered additional music on top of it for a 
cacophony. But if you learn its limitations, it 
could save you some time. 
Adobe Premiere Elements 2018 is perfect 
for people who want to make home movies to 
share with friends, but who don’t have much 
video-editing experience. It also offers decent 
functionality for more experienced editors who 
don’t want to follow the walk-throughs. But 
more robust software might be better for a 
power user pursuing YouTube stardom.

•  Guided modes help you learn to create nice-
looking videos with absolutely no experience
•  Video Story and Instant Video modes almost 
automatically create family movies from raw

Call of Duty: WWII: Not a 
remaster, but it might as well be     
Time is a flat circle. BY HAYDEN DINGMAN 
C
all of Duty: WWII isn’t a remaster, 
but it feels like one. As the gate 
crashed open on my landing 
craft and I sprinted desperately 
onto Omaha Beach, I half-expected to hear 
people yelling for Lieutenant Powell, star of 
2002’s Medal of Honor: Allied Assault—the 
first game I remember doing the iconic 
D-Day opener.
This one stars a “Davis” instead, but that’s 
no big deal. 15 years on, Call of Duty: WWII 
is less “World War II as it actually existed” 
and more “World War II as it existed in video 
games between 1999 and 2008-ish,” a 
Greatest Hits Collection spanning from the 
original Medal of Honor through to Allied 
Assault, and eventually Call of Duty 1, 2, 
and 3.
It was the decade where everyone got 
sick of World War II games, but absence 
does indeed make the heart grow at least 
a little fonder.

ROAD TO BERLIN
“Everything in moderation” is not the games 
industry’s strong suit, which I guess is why we 
tend to get ideas in waves. We do sci-fi to 
death in the ‘90s so everyone moves on to 
World War II. Then we do World War II to 
death so we move on to modern war. That 
gets stale, we return to science fiction. And 
voila, 15 or 20 years later we’re reloading our 
M1 Garands.
And if Call of Duty: WWII is the start of a 
World War II renaissance, it’s about the safest 
bet you could make. Dredging up the ol’ 
D-Day (go.pcworld.com/dday) to VE-Day 
(go.pcworld.com/vedy) storyline once again, 
from June of 1944 through to April of 1945, 
it’s the same Band of Brothers/Saving Private 
Ryan story video games love to focus on. 
We’ve seen it in Allied Assault, in multiple Call 
of Duty games, in Gearbox’s underrated 
Brothers in Arms series, and so on.
So if you played games between 1999 
and 2008ish, this’ll feel 
very familiar. Omaha 
Beach? Check. 
Normandy’s hedgerows? 
Check. Hill 400? Check. 
Battle of the Bulge? Check. 
All the usual highlights.
It’s safe. It’s also kind of 
bland. Davis and his pals 
breeze through Normandy 
on the backs of the most 
generic platitudes. Davis 
has a wife back home in Texas. He wants to 
head home to her but—spoilers!—decides 
duty comes first! Sergeant Pierson has a dark 
past involving Tough Command Decisions. 
He’s also an alcoholic. Your friend Zussman 
ends up being the most fleshed-out character, 
and that depth literally goes as deep as “He’s 
part-Jewish and fighting Nazis.”
Call of Duty: WWII has nothing to add to 
our understanding of World War II, nothing to 
say that hasn’t been said by dozens of its 
predecessors. It doesn’t even feel like it’s 
trying to say something more interesting. As I 
said, it’s content to be a sort-of “World War II 
Video Game Greatest Hits Collection.”
The difference of course is that we’ve had 
a dozen or so Call of Duty games and a 
generation (or two) of hardware since last we 
saw these locales. Call of Duty: WWII is 
stunning. It’s a case, as with remasters, of a 
new game looking like I remember the old, 
not how it actually looked. Sprinting between 
Pierson is the worst when it comes to hoary old “soldiering life” cliches.

CALL OF DUTY: WWII
hedgehogs on D-Day, the water bursting 
around me, the plink-plink-plink of a German 
machine gun tapping on barricades, then up 
and over the earthworks, storming the 
bunkers full of Nazis—it looks like I remember 
Allied Assault looking, brings back that 
same adrenaline rush.
Then I look at how Allied Assault actually 
looked and…oh.
The same is true of Hurtgen Forest and the 
rest. Ideas that were only hinted at in the past 
can now be fully realized—for instance, the 
way artillery shreds a 50-foot pine tree, turns it 
into six-inch chunks of shrapnel. Trees (and 
limbs and houses and so on) explode in WWII 
in a way they didn’t and couldn’t in 2005.
Maybe that’s enough. Technological 
advances perhaps highlight how little Call of 
Duty’s progressed in other respects, but only 
to those who were here for the World War II 
game glut the first 
time around. 
There’s an entire 
new generation of 
people playing 
games now 
who’ve never 
played something 
like Call of Duty: 
WWII.
And for those 
of us who were 
there, the 
nostalgia is still 
real. Hearing the ping of an emptied M1 
Garand, seeing that familiar gray-green color 
grading, hearing the rumble of Panzers 
coming over a hill—I missed it.
Hell, Sledgehammer’s even taken this 
throwback one step further, eschewing 
rechargeable health in favor of medkits—the 
first time since Call of Duty 2. In terms easier 
to grasp, that means it’s the first time Call of 
Duty has used medkits for health since 
before the release of the Xbox 360.
FIGHT ON THE BEACHES
Multiplayer feels just as retro, at least by 2017 
standards. I don’t typically spend much time 
talking about Call of Duty’s multiplayer, in part 
because the last few iterations just haven’t 
appealed to me much at all. But I found myself 
playing and actually enjoying WWII over the 
weekend in a way I haven’t since maybe... 
Side note: WWII also features Call of Duty’s best behind-enemy-lines stealth 
mission since Chernobyl.

Black Ops?
It’s pretty simple, really. Call of Duty: WWII 
ditches all the wall-running/jump-boosting/
future-parkour stuff from the last few entries. 
Sledgehammer’s been fond of yelling “Boots 
on the ground!” in its marketing pitches and 
while I hate to regurgitate marketing points, I 
can’t deny I’m having more fun with my two 
feet planted pretty firmly on Europe’s war-
pocked soil.
And I just prefer WWII era weaponry. It’s 
what drew me to Battlefield 1 last year (where 
the weapons were even more primitive), and 
it’s what’s kept me playing WWII so far. That 
aforementioned M1 ping is a classic, but the 
clunky mechanical feel of the period is 
overall a big draw.
There are aspects I definitely don’t like. 
One of the most surreal moments I’ve had in 
2017 was popping open loot boxes while 
some random dude commented over my 
shoulder on the items contained therein. 
“Three commons? Oh you got screwed, 
man.” See, WWII has a Destiny-like hub called 
“Headquarters,” styled after a Normandy 
Beach base of operations. It’s like a pseudo-
MMO with fellow players running around 
emoting at each other, marking challenges 
to complete in their next match, and—yes—
popping open loot boxes in full view of 
everyone else.
It’s not great.
But aside from 
Headquarters, the logistics of 
which made WWII’s servers a 
bit of a nightmare over the 
weekend, this is pretty much 
stock Call of Duty multiplayer. 
You can even unlock reflex 
sights and other modern 
warfare gizmos for your circa-
1944 weaponry. It’s dumb but 
Call of Duty: WWII
PROS
•  Feels like a greatest hits collection of World War II 
video games past
•  The ping of that M1 Garand is like a concentrated 
rush of nostalgia
CONS
•  Content to retread well-trod ground, even by 
World War II video game standards
•  “Allows” you to watch other people open loot 
boxes. Ugh
BOTTOM LINE
Nostalgia is enough to mitigate Call of Duty: WWII’s 
weak story and bland characters, but only barely. 
Multiplayer’s better than it has been, though.

CALL OF DUTY: WWII
it’s my kind of dumb, I guess—at least until 
Battlefield makes a World War II game again.
As for the now almost decade-old 
Zombies mode, it’s probably the weakest part 
of 2017’s offering, which is surprising since it 
was the part of Infinite Warfare I enjoyed most. 
WWII ditches the zany tone of last year’s 
“Zombies in Spaceland” for a more classic 
Nazi Zombies feel, darker and more ominous. 
And that’s fine in theory, but the zaniness 
helped mask some of the repetition. I’ve 
played WWII’s zombie campaign three times 
and while it’s a similar labyrinth of unlockable 
doors, collectible weapons, and bizarre traps, 
it just lacks a certain spark.
Part of the problem I think is that the 
zombies feel spongy, which clashes with 
WWII’s weapons. Shooting a Nazi Zombie 
with a chunky World War II-era combat 
shotgun only for it to shrug off the blow 
and keep coming at you? A bit of a 
cognitive disconnect.
Regardless, it’s a drag and I don’t see 
myself going back much, especially given 
that the proper multiplayer mode’s been 
somewhat redeemed.
BOTTOM LINE
Nostalgia is fine. Nostalgia is good. I enjoyed 
my time with Call of Duty: WWII and I’m 
continuing to enjoy its multiplayer off-and-on. 
But nostalgia is also weird—a strange and 
uncontrollable force where you know what 
you’re playing is somewhat mediocre, 
somewhat disappointing, and you just don’t 
care because you grew up shooting virtual M1 
Garands and it feels good to shoot one again, 
to hear that ping and see some dumb Nazi’s 
helmet pop off. Call of Duty: WWII is 
mediocre. I enjoyed it anyway.
The question now, of course, is whether 
2018 brings Call of Duty: WWII Pt. Two. I’m 
fine if it does, but the series can’t just coast 
along on another Greatest Hits Collection 
next year—it needs 
to take some actual 
risks, dig a bit 
deeper. We can’t just 
do Band of Brothers 
forever, especially if 
our characters can’t 
be one iota as 
interesting as even 
the least interesting 
character in Band 
of Brothers.

being underpowered compared to the 
PlayStation 4, and with each controversy over 
the Kinect or resolution upscaling or what 
have you, the Xbox’s hole only got deeper. 
The Xbox One X could fill in that hole a 
little. For the first time since 2005, Microsoft 
has the most powerful gaming console on the 
market—powerful enough that it surprised 
even me, a devout PC gamer (go.pcworld.
com/pcga). 
This little box packs some power.
SIZING DOWN
And the Xbox One X is little. That’s as good a 
place as any to start this review, because it’s a 
compliment I would never pay to the original 
Xbox One and its vintage VCR aesthetic.
A quick aside: We’ll be comparing the 
Xbox One X to both the original Xbox One 
and 2016’s Xbox One S in this review. Some 
of the Xbox One X’s “new” features debuted 
on the S last year, such as 
HDR support, but because 
that was more of a 
placeholder model and 
provided less incentive to 
upgrade it only makes sense 
to cover them again here.
The Xbox One X isn’t 
necessarily more eye-
catching—it still has that 
“generic cable box” look to 
it in my opinion. I wish 
Microsoft had opted to reuse 
(or save) the more vibrant white-and-black 
color scheme from last year’s Xbox One S.
It’s compact, though. Measuring 11.8 x 
9.4 x 2.4 inches, the Xbox One X is drastically 
smaller than the launch Xbox One (13.1 x 10.8 
x 3.1 inches) and only a hair larger than the 
slimmer S model (11.5 x 9 x 2.5 inches). Pretty 
incredible, considering the X’s more powerful 
hardware. Even better: Like the S, the Xbox 
One X packs the power supply inside the 
case. Say goodbye to that launch Xbox One 
and its enormous power brick. The X has an 
unadorned 5-foot power cord.
Despite being shrunk down, it’s also 
quieter. It’s hard for me to do a 100-percent 
fair comparison with the original Xbox One at 
this point because mine is going on four years 
old, but I guarantee it was never this quiet. 
Even after hours of playing, the Xbox One X is 
almost whisper-silent when placed on the 
other side of the room—none of that

annoyed with its capacitive power button 
though, which not only boots the console at 
the briefest hint that something might want to 
touch it but also shuts it off. If you even look at 
it wrong you’ll hear the boo-doo-doop of the 
Xbox turning on or off, and heaven forbid you 
have a cat/dog/child/poltergeist. Though 
perhaps less futuristic, the S returned to the 
pressable power button of 
old and the X follows suit.
THE 4K FACTOR
Okay, but gaming. How 
does the Xbox One X 
function while gaming? 
After all, that’s the reason to 
upgrade. The Xbox One S 
already had size covered, as 
well as the physical power

The Xbox One X exceeds not only its predecessor, 
but also matches up to the majority (55 percent or 
more) of gaming PCs today—and for only $500. 
Pretty impressive, for a console.The question is 
whether developers take advantage of it.

jet-engine fan noise I associate with the 
original Xbox One. There’s plenty of 
ventilation on both ends and the rear of the 
console, and while the X gets warm to the 
touch it never gets hot.
Note that unlike the 2TB Xbox One S, the 
standard Xbox One X does not come with a 
stand. Microsoft does plan to sell one, but 
unless you shell out you’re limited to running 
the console horizontally. Microsoft has also 
made no mention of providing free Kinect 
adapters. The Kinect port is gone, and most 
of you probably won’t notice or care. But 
those who do will need to purchase an 
adapter from Microsoft for $40 this time 
around—a final insult to those who bought 
(and maybe even use!) the now officially 
discontinued accessory.
Anyway the best improvement—the 
absolute best—is the Xbox One X’s physical 
power button. This might sound like a minor 
improvement, and it is! Anyone who owns the

button, a larger hard drive, 
quietness, and so on. So, how 
does it perform?
Surprisingly well.
Listen, I’m a PC guy and I’ve 
been a PC guy for a while now. 
The Xbox One X doesn’t match 
up to a high-end PC and the 
people who say it does...well, 
their idea of a “high-end” PC is 
maybe skewed a bit low. But it 
does come way closer than I 
expected, if not on paper than 
at least in-game—and it blows 
the old Xbox One (not to 
mention the PlayStation 4) 
completely out of the water.
First, for those who like specs: The original 
Xbox One featured a custom 8-core AMD 
APU clocked at 1.75GHz and 8GB of DDR3 
RAM, plus 32MB of higher throughput 
ESRAM. To simplify this down to a single 
number so as to not kill you: Peak graphics 
throughput was marked at 1.31 TFLOPS. The 
Xbox One S bumped that number to about 
1.4—not really a notable increase.
The Xbox One X by comparison features 
an 8-core APU clocked at 2.3GHz, with 12GB 
of GDDR5 RAM, all of it higher-throughput 
(326GB/s) than even the 32MB of ESRAM in 
the original Xbox One. By raising both the 
number of compute cores and the clock 
speed, peak throughput for the Xbox One X 
is estimated at 6 TFLOPS.
To put it in more accessible real-world 
terms, the original Xbox One was estimated 
to have power on a par with (being generous) 
AMD’s Radeon 7790—or, on Nvidia’s side, 
approximately a GTX 650 Ti. The Xbox One X 
is about equal to an AMD Radeon RX 580 (go.
pcworld.com/n1tr) or an Nvidia GeForce GTX 
1060 (go.pcworld.com/gf60).
It’s a huge increase in power. Of course, 
the Xbox One X’s real-world performance will 
be a bit better than even those model 
numbers indicate, due to the differences 
between optimizing for consoles versus 
PC—especially since, as a mid-generation 
upgrade, developers are already mostly 
comfortable with the Xbox One architecture. 
Expect fewer launch-day woes than you’d see 
at the start of an entirely new generation.

GEARS OF WAR: LEADING 
THE CHARGE
Which brings us to Gears of War 4, our main 
point of reference at the moment when it 
comes to the Xbox One X. To be fair, it does 
pull out all the stops on the Xbox One X—4K, 
HDR, the works. It also features two different 
rendering modes, one labeled “Visuals” and 
the other “Performance.”
Visuals mode ups the graphics of Gears 4 
significantly, outputting the game at native 4K 
with settings reminiscent (as far as we can tell) 
of High/Ultra on the PC. That’s in-line with the 
GPU comparison above—my colleague Brad 
Chacos benchmarked Gears of War 4 (go.
pcworld.com/gwar) on a variety of systems 
last year, and managed 32 frames per second 
on an AMD Radeon Fury X at 4K Ultra, a 
slightly better card than the 580. Dip a few 
settings to High and you’d see a steady 30 
on the 580 too, most likely.
Performance mode is more interesting to 
me, though. Despite the focus on 4K in the 
Xbox One X marketing, I’ll take lower 
resolution and higher frame rate almost any 
day—that’s my bias as a PC gamer with a 
144Hz monitor. Performance mode does 
just that, eschewing native 4K for upscaled 
1080p Ultra, but running at a smooth 60 
frames per second.
It plays like a whole different game. 
Everything, from sprinting to shooting to even 
the explosions is so much smoother. To be 
honest, Performance mode and its 60

frames-per-second output is more reminiscent 
to me of playing on the PC than the 4K Visuals 
mode. That goes doubly because of how far 
people (usually) sit from the TV. I’m not 
convinced 4K is really necessary. It’s a great 
selling point for Microsoft, but even sitting 
five feet from a 55-inch Samsung 4K TV, the 
difference 60 frames 
per second made 
was way more 
noteworthy than the 
graphics 
enhancements of 
Visuals mode. Your 
mileage may vary 
though—I know 
some people 
aren’t as sensitive 
to frame rate.
Either way, the 
game looks better 
than the original 
Xbox One. I had both 
consoles plugged 
into different HDMI 
ports so I could swap 
back and forth. Even 
the main menu of the 
original Xbox One 
version is uglier, with 
protagonist JD Fenix’s 
face blurry and 
jagged. Swap over to 
the Xbox One X, his 
face is magically crisper, the reflections better, 
the eyes more alive.
A/B testing the actual game is easy too. 
Feel free to expand the screenshots above, 
and you should be able to see the difference. 
We’ve also captured some video (embedded 
in the next section, since it also contains PC 
Gears of War 4 on the original Xbox One. Note the aliasing on the shotgun 
shells, how static the smoke looks, and how indistinct the background looks…

generation behind by comparison, especially 
when it comes to aliasing. Enemies look 
jagged and indistinct, even compared to the 
1080p upscaled version on the X. In frantic 
moments the Xbox One has a tendency to 
stutter, where the X is smooth.
HOW DOES IT FARE 
AGAINST A PC?
Pitting the Xbox One X against its 
predecessor is Easy Mode though. Far more 
interesting (especially to us at PCWorld) is 
how the X stands up against a PC.
As I said earlier, Brad benched Gears 4 on 
a variety of setups last year. It’s easy to draw 
some conclusions if you jump over there (go.
pcworld.com/gwar)—just keep in mind the 
Xbox One X focuses on 4K native at 30 frames 
per second on High/Ultra or 1080p upscaled 
at 60 frames per second on Ultra (though in 
both cases there’s probably some overhead 
to ensure a smooth locked frame rate).
Does the Xbox One X 
measure up against a 
high-end PC? Of course 
not. We tested the HP 
Omen X we have in the 
office, to see what would 
happen—that’s a machine 
with dual GTX 1080 Tis. 
And...well, the results are 
predictable. In Gears 4 the 
Omen averaged 70-80 
frames per second in the same test sections at 
4K Ultra. It was overkill obviously, the point 
being that a PC can outdo the Xbox One X.
On the other hand, the Xbox One X 
measures up to machines the majority of 
enthusiast PC gamers are running. Just take a 
look at the Steam Hardware Survey (go.
pcworld.com/surv): About 55 percent of PC 
gamers use GTX 1060-caliber cards and 
below, while the other 45 percent is a 
smattering of cards both higher and lower. 
The fact the Xbox One X matches what 55+ 
percent of the PC gaming audience uses 
day-to-day? Pretty impressive.
POST-RELEASE
Now that the Xbox One X has officially 
launched I’ve had time to check out a few 
more titles. Assassin’s Creed: Origins was the 
one I felt would show the most obvious 
differences between PC and the Xbox One X, 
and that is indeed the case. Below, you’ll see 
a screenshot of the Xbox One X version.

XBOX ONE X
Above is a screenshot of the PC game.
Unlike Gears 4, Origins only has a single 
mode: 4K native. It looks surprisingly good in 
still images, and I’d wager the game is 
running on the Xbox One X at 4K with High 
settings—some missing reflections, simpler 
shadows, and the distant mountains lose 
some finer details and appear blurrier overall.
Still, it’s pretty impressive. The biggest 
issue is it’s at 30 frames per second, and a 
pretty jittery 30 frames per second at that. As 
with Gears, I think Origins would benefit 
more immediately from a 1080p60 Ultra 
upscaled to 4K than it does from 4K native at 
High. Actually, I think all games on the Xbox 
One X would benefit 
more from 1080p 
upscaled to 4K with 
better frame rate/detail. 
4K is a great buzzword, 
but in practice it’s not as 
easily noticed as other 
adjustments.
Something for 
developers to consider 
moving forward.
PRICE
Alaina’s build above came in around $650-
700. That’s another area where the Xbox One 
X has a major advantage—price. We’ve put 
together a few PC builds comparable to the 
Xbox One X (go.pcworld.com/50mp), and 
the cheapest (sans-optical drive because 
Steam exists) is around $640. That’ll get you 
basic 4K, 30 frames-per-second gaming. 
Adding a 4K Blu-Ray drive tacks at least 
another $100 on the price, and your options 
are very limited. 
At $500 then, the Xbox One X is a 
bargain. A bit ironic, given the outcry about 
the original Xbox One’s $500 price tag—at 
the time it seemed like a ripoff. $500 for the 
Xbox One X seems more than reasonable 
though, considering it’s cheaper than even 
the least expensive comparable PC.
As for our supercharged HP Omen X 
comparison, keep in mind that just a single 
1080 Ti would cost you more than this entire 
As with Gears, I think Origins

scrubbed away. The difference is that 
noticeable.
The problem: It’s hard to demo HDR. If 
you watch HDR-ready content on a screen 
that’s not HDR-equipped, it will just display 
in the color range you’re accustomed to. 
Games also need to be mastered specifically 
for HDR, which means there aren’t a ton of 
games utilizing it even if you own an HDR-
ready TV.
It looks great though, and is a major 
benefit to both the Xbox One X and S 
provided you have capable hardware. 
“Capable hardware” is also why I say it’s 
an advantage over PCs at the moment: 
While both Nvidia and AMD technically 
support HDR output, HDR adoption by 
monitors has been slow, to say the least. 
That’ll probably change in 2018, but then

the Xbox One X out of the

price/performance ratio

moment.
XBOX ONE X 
HAS AN EDGE 
IN HDR
Another area where the Xbox holds an 
advantage over PCs at the moment: HDR. 
High Dynamic Range, or HDR, actually 
debuted with last year’s S model so it’s not 
brand-new, but it’ll be new to most Xbox 
One X buyers, I assume. So far there are only 
a few tentpole Xbox titles, though luckily 
Gears 4 is one of them. It’s more subtle than 
4K, but again is likely to be more important 
moving forward.
I won’t go into tons of detail, but HDR or 
High Dynamic Range essentially increases 
the amount of colors your TV shows, and 
increases the contrasts between light and 
dark areas. In Gears 4 this means better-
looking explosions especially—brighter and 
more vibrant, with a better range of oranges 
and reds. Gears 4 even includes a nifty 
mode where you can split the screen, the left 
showing an HDR-enhanced image and the 
right showing the standard version. The HDR

THE “EXCLUSIVE” PROBLEM
Microsoft’s biggest problem, and this is 
important: Games. Or rather, the lack 
thereof. Microsoft has suffered all 
generation from a lack of exclusive titles, 
and dwindling interest in the few they do 
have. Halo, Gears of War, and Forza are the 
main three, with Cuphead, Sunset 
Overdrive, Quantum Break, and Rare Replay 
to fill out the gaps. It’s not very impressive, 
especially when stacked up to Sony’s 
onslaught of exclusives.
Hell, Crackdown 3 was supposed to 
launch alongside the Xbox One X and then 
was delayed into next year, leaving Super 
Lucky’s Tale as the sole “launch title.” That’s 
not great.
Now, the Xbox One X’s situation is a bit 
better going forward, insofar as 
multiplatform titles will henceforth 
presumably look and play the best on it. 
That’s more than could be said about the 
original Xbox One. Microsoft claims 70 
titles will be “Enhanced” for the Xbox One 
X launch.
Still, a console is nothing without games, 
and right now that’s Microsoft’s weakest 
point—especially this far into a console 
generation, when most people have already 
built up friend networks and trophies and a 
history on the PS4. The Xbox One X is an 
excellent value and definitely more powerful, 
but can that overcome four years of a Sony 
advantage? Especially with no Halo or other 
system-seller to kickstart the X out the gate? 
Hard to say.
Here’s your...much-anticipated, system-selling launch game?

streaming from many streaming services, the 
same can be said of most 4K smart TVs 
released in the last couple of years.
It’s also worth noting the HDMI-In port 
still exists, so if you’re one of the people 
using your Xbox as a media box, keep doing 
your thing. Microsoft’s certainly 
downplaying those aspects these days and 
has even removed features—chief among 
them the “Snap” feature that allowed you to 
game and watch something at the same 
time, which was removed with April’s 
Creator’s Update.
THE LITTLE THINGS THAT 
ARE GOOD
This review’s getting lengthy, and the Xbox 
One X’s performance is our chief concern. 
That said, I do want to call out some last Pros 
and Cons before we wrap up.
In the good column, Microsoft’s support 
for backward compatibility. Obviously this 
THE FUTURE OF TV?
I’m not going to dwell much on the Xbox 
One X’s TV features because frankly, even 
Microsoft doesn’t seem to care anymore. 
The Xbox One X does feature a few 
improvements over the original Xbox One, 
though most of these improvements came 
with last year’s S redesign.
Basically the Xbox One X will double as a 
4K media player, for those who still buy 
physical media. That’s a pretty big win for 
Microsoft seeing as, for whatever reason, 
Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro does not playback 
4K media—you’d think Sony would know 
better, considering how pivotal Blu-Ray 
support was for the PS3.
4K Blu-Rays pumped through the Xbox 
One look phenomenal, as expected. 
Microsoft provided us a copy of Planet Earth 
2, which is probably the best 4K/HDR 
showcase you could ask for. The footage is 
crisp, colors are vibrant, it’s beautiful.
The million-dollar 
question though: How 
many people are buying 
physical media? Certainly 
not as many people as in 
previous console 
generations, as Netflix, 
HBO Go, Amazon Prime, 
Hulu, etc. grow in 
popularity. And while the 
Xbox One X features those 
apps and allows for 4K 
Ninja Gaiden Black on an Xbox One X? Fantastic.

feature exists on the 
original Xbox One 
also, but it’s worth 
noting because it 
didn’t exist when we 
reviewed that console 
back in 2013.
Not only that, but 
Microsoft recently 
added backward 
compatibility with a 
handful of original 
Xbox (meaning the 
2001 Xbox) games 
too. I had a fun time digging out my copy of 
Ninja Gaiden Black earlier this week, 
popping the disc in, and seeing the old 
Xbox boot screen. Good on Microsoft there.
I’ve also come to love Microsoft’s “Xbox 
Game Pass,” its newish Netflix-for-games 
type offering. $10 a month gets you access 
to about 100 games, spanning from the 
2001 Xbox to the Xbox 360 to even a 
handful of Xbox One games—Metal Gear 
Solid V, for instance. The games are cycled 
in and out monthly, and there are a surprising 
number of quality titles to choose from. 
Definitely worth looking into. (I grabbed 
Nights: Into Dreams, Ninja Gaiden Black, 
and Metro: Last Light Redux for testing.)
There are also signs Microsoft is 
loosening its hold on the platform—a pretty 
big move. First it was Bluetooth added to 
last year’s new controller design, now it’s 
peripherals that work with the Xbox One X 
right out of the box. Turtle Beach’s new 
Stealth 700 headset connects wirelessly to 
the Xbox One without a dongle, the first to 
do so and hopefully a sign of things to come.
And as much as I dislike UWP on 
Windows 10, I’ll admit it’s been great for the 
Xbox ecosystem. Many of my favorite 
programs have built Windows 10 UWP 
versions which are then easily ported over—
Spotify, Netflix, and so on. Pretty seamless, 
and a huge advantage over the PlayStation 4 
in that regard.
THE LITTLE THINGS 
THAT ARE BAD
Now, for the not-so-good. First up, the Xbox 
One X’s hard drive is comically small. 
Microsoft saw fit to offer a 2TB version of the 
Xbox One S, and for good reason: With 
Halo 5, Gears of War 4, Metal Gear Solid V, and more, all for a $10 
subscription? Not bad.

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   109
game installs topping 100GB, the Xbox One 
X’s measly 1TB system drive (with only 
650GB of free space out of the box) means 
you can install approximately 6-10 games 
nowadays. Less perhaps, once you factor in 
DLC.
That’s absurd. 1TB is better than the 
shameful 500GB of the original Xbox One, 
but it’s still woefully underprepared for the 
realities of modern gaming. You’ll absolutely 
need an external USB drive or two to 
supplement, and I can’t fathom why 
Microsoft didn’t opt for a 2TB standard 
considering it would’ve cost them, what, an 
extra $10 per unit?
Microsoft’s user interface also continues 
to disappoint. Despite multiple refreshes in 
2017 alone, the system is still cluttered and 
clumsy to navigate. Menus and submenus 
are hidden all over the place, the Store is 
clearly built for a mouse-and-keyboard setup 
and translates terribly to gamepad; the push 
for Mixer over Twitch is bound to confuse 
and alienate, and so on.
It’s just a mess. Rather than reworking a 
UI that hasn’t worked since 2013, Microsoft 
desperately needs to jettison a large amount 
of its design language and start from scratch, 
like it did multiple times on the Xbox 360. 
The whole “Flat Arrangement of Squares 
Cluttered By Ads” setup is not working.
BOTTOM LINE
Forgive me for repeating myself, but this is a 
long review and I want to make sure you 
didn’t miss the most important point: The 
Xbox One X is the best price/performance 
ratio on the market at the moment. Sure, 
you can build a PC that outperforms it at 
every turn—some of you reading this 
probably have.
But native 4K gaming for $500? And in a 
form factor this small and this quiet? That’s 
pretty incredible, especially when you 
consider the jump from the original Xbox 
One—probably Microsoft’s low point for 
console engineering. There are missteps 
that bring it down a notch or two, especially 
that undersized hard drive and the lack of 
quality exclusive titles, but judged purely on 
a technical level? The Xbox One X is a huge 
step up from the original Xbox One and an 
impressive machine in its own right, 
matching what the majority of PC gamers 
have at home. 
Already a quarter full after installing Gears 4, 
Forza Horizon 2, Super Lucky’s Tale, Metro: Last 
Light Redux, and half of Rare Replay.

RAZER PHONE HANDS-ON:

FEATURE
RAZER PHONE HANDS-ON
T
he Razer Phone (go.pcworld.
com/rp) is a bit of a puzzle. It’s not 
surprising that it exists, given that 
Razer, best known for PC hard-
ware and peripherals, acquired smartphone 
maker Nextbit in January of 2017 in order to 
produce this device. Nor is it surprising that, 
based on our hands-on time with the device at a 
recent briefing, the Phone seems to be equal 
parts Nextbit’s Robin (go.pcworld.com/epnr) 
and Razer’s laptop line, touting impressive specs 
at a reasonable price of $699.
What’s confusing is what it isn’t. Razer says 
this isn’t meant to be a gaming phone. Rather, 
it’s a phone for gamers, Razer fans, and 
Android enthusiasts, meaning it’s intended to 
deliver a great experience for all kinds of 
“content consumption,” not just gaming. But 
it’s a weird message when Razer’s core 
audience is gamers—and Razer is still pushing 
gaming partnerships that take advantage of 
the Razer Phone’s unique screen.
THE RAZER PHONE’S FIRST: 
A 120HZ SCREEN
The Razer Phone is packed with a 120Hz, 
1440x2560, 5.72-inch LCD panel. If you’ve 
ever used a high framerate PC display, you 
know the difference a faster refresh rate can 
have on simple tasks—not just games.

and “consuming content” all felt

super-smooth. I even got to track the refresh 
cycles with Razer’s own built-in version of 
FRAPS (yes, I asked, and yes, you can turn it on 
in the final version). The panel uses some of the 
same adaptive refresh technology as Nvidia’s 
Gsync and AMD’s Freesync, so when you’re 
idle you also aren’t wasting precious battery.
Speaking of battery, the Razer Phone packs 
a 4,000mAh one inside its 197-gram body. That, 
paired with the newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 
835, help it last for long “content consumption” 
sessions. The phone also features 8GB of dual 
channel LPDDR4 RAM clocked at 1,600MHz. 
Razer really knows its audience when it lists 
detailed specs like that for a device.
How about another PC-centric spec to catch 
your attention? Members from the same team 
that came up with the custom-cooling solutions 
in the Razer Blade line (go.pcworld.com/trbl) 
also had a hand in custom cooling for the Snap-
dragon 835. Razer says its cooling solution allows 
the 835 to run longer before throttling down, 
and when it does, it doesn’t throttle as low. 
SHARED DESIGN 
LANGUAGE
Razer also wants the Razer Phone to feel right 
at home with the company’s other hardware 
offerings—and it does. The engineers worked 
with some of the same teams that helped make 
Razer’s refined Razer Blade laptop series. At 
first glance it looks much like the Robin that

came before it, but in my hands, the Razer 
Phone made the Robin feel like a toy. I would 
describe the overall design to be monolithic—
taking cues from Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece 
2001: A Space Odyssey. 
The chassis is all aluminum—like the Razer 
Blade—and has a nice, tactile feel in my hand. 
I’ve never been a fan of all-glass phones, so 
I’m glad to see Razer lean into what it knows. 
It also feels like a tank that could easily with-
stand some drops—much like LG’s V20. It was 
dense without feeling too weighty.
The back of the phone is one solid piece 
of aluminum, disrupted only by Razer’s 
three-headed snake logo in the middle and a 
camera bump at the top. The edges show a 
glimpse of antenna lines, but they blend in 
well. On the front of the Razer Phone is a dual 
speaker grille—again, like the Razer Blade—
with notches taken out for the front-facing 
camera and sensors.
RAZER PHONE HANDS-ON
Razer sees its Phone much 
like it sees its Blade line, 
mostly for the hardcore.
The aluminum sure does gather dust and smudg-
es. Still, I prefer it to all-glass phones.

PHONE AUDIO WITH A 
PUNCH
The Razer Phone’s dual speaker grille and 
stereo speaker configuration are not a first by 
any means, but I’d be hard-pressed to find a 
louder setup on any phone! Each speaker has 
its own amp, allowing the Phone to be 
pushed to higher decibels without distortion. 
I’m currently using a Google Pixel 2 XL (which 
also has dual front-facing speakers), and side 
by side it’s no contest: The Razer Phone blew 
the Pixel out of the water at the highest levels. 
Sadly, the Razer Phone does not include a 
3.5-inch headphone jack, and I’m not a fan of 
this decision. It especially makes no sense 
when Razer makes a number of high-quality 
headphones that still support this format. 
Razer does offer a couple of headphone 
options that support Apple’s Lightning 
connector, so I’m hoping the company 
releases USB-C support in the future. Until 
then we are stuck with dongles.
STOCK FOR THE ANDROID 
ENTHUSIAST
Razer is also trying to court Android enthusiasts. 
The Phone runs a near-stock version of Android 
7.1.1 out of the gate, and Razer promises 8.0 
Oreo support in Q1 of 2018. Unlike Nextbit with 
the Robin, Razer focuses on the basics while 
adding only a few custom tweaks, like its own 
Gamebooster technology and a theme store. 
We’ve heard this “focus-on-the-basic” approach 
before (re: Essential, go.pcworld.com/re), so 
The Razor Phone 
feels right at home.

116   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
FEATURE
I’m hoping Razer can deliver.
One choice I liked was Razer’s decision to 
default to Nova Prime Launcher rather than 
make its own. I’ve been using Nova Launcher for 
years, and it’s one of the most popular out there. 
The Robin had a heavily skinned UI that matched 
the aesthetic they were going for 
at Nextbit, and Razer could easily 
have gone down that same path. 
Instead Razer is allowing the 
freedom of stock Android and 
providing a theme store if you 
want custom Razer looks. 
To round out the enthusiast 
angle, the Razer phone is sold 
unlocked (GSM only), with the 
bootloader unlocked out of the 
box as well. This phone might 
be a great option for the tinker-
ers out there!
FINAL THOUGHTS
I would have loved to have 
seen a headphone jack and 
more attention paid to the 
camera setup (it’s very basic), 
but there’s still plenty to like 
about the Razer Phone. 
Gaming phone or not, Razer 
is still partnering with big 
phone gaming publishers 
like Square Enix (Final 
Fantasy) and Tencent (Arena 
of Valor) to offer 120Hz 
optimized experiences.
During my meeting, I got the feeling that 
the team from Nextbit got to follow their 
passions on the software side while having 
access to the hardware resources of the teams 
at Razer. It feels like a grown-up Robin, which 
is what Razer needed.

WHAT THE  
KASPERSKY  
ANTI-VIRUS

THE KASPERSKY ANTI-VIRUS HACK
aspersky Lab’s 400 million 
users worldwide can’t be 
happy about recent news 
linking the company’s antivi-
rus products to spying. The 
Russian government reportedly used the 
Moscow-based company’s software to steal 
sensitive information from American intelli-
gence agents.
The incidents remind us that the security 
products we trust to protect our PCs have 
more or less full access. “Every cloud-based 
anti-virus has the potential and the ability to 
delete files, to modify files,” said Jake Williams, 
Founder and President of Rendition Infosec. 
“They have the ability to launch new processes 
as well as terminate existing processes.”
It’s bad if someone hacks your computer. 
If someone hacks your computer and uses 
your own antivirus software to take over, that’s 
a disaster. “Looking at all of this together,” 
Williams concluded, “It becomes clear that if 
whoever’s running your anti-virus doesn’t 
have your best interests at heart they can 
definitely do some damage.”
Now that we know Kaspersky antivirus 
software can turn against you, the next ques-
tion is whether we can do anything about it. 
We talked to security experts to find out more.
KASPERSKY’S PURPORTED 
DATA EXFILTRATION: A 
TIMELINE
The Kaspersky story heated up earlier this fall. 
On October 5, The Wall Street Journal reported 
(go.pcworld.com/wsjr) that hackers working 
for the Russian government in 2015 stole 
documents detailing how the U.S. attacks 
foreign computer networks and defends 
domestic ones. The Russian hackers used 
Kaspersky Anti-Virus to identify the data and 
target it on the home computer of a National 
Security Agency contractor, the Journal said.
A few days later The New York Times 
reported (go.pcworld.com/nytr) that the 
Americans only found out about the pur-
ported Kaspersky data leak from Israeli spies. 
The Israelis, the Times said, hacked into 
K
“THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
LAUNCH NEW PROCESSES AS 
WELL AS TERMINATE EXISTING 
PROCESSES.”

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   121
Kaspersky themselves, where they watched 
Russian hackers use Kaspersky software in real 
time as a “sort of Google search for sensitive 
information.”
The Journal followed up a day later with 
another report (go.pcworld.com/jfu). This one 
said Russian agents used Kaspersky to search for 
terms like “top secret” across computers where 
Kaspersky software was installed. 
Kaspersky Lab has denied allegations that 
it’s in cahoots with Russian intelligence. Never-
theless, retailers including Best Buy (go.
pcworld.com/bby), Office Depot (go.pcworld.
com/ode), and Staples (go.pcworld.com/sta) 
have pulled Kaspersky software from store 
shelves during, and leading up to, the 
controversy.
Company co-founder and CEO Eugene 
Kaspersky announced he would open up the 
company’s code to third-party review to quell 
concerns about Russian interference (go.
pcworld.com/ari).
Soon after, Kaspersky Lab also announced 
the preliminary results of an 
internal investigation (go.
pcworld.com/oaii) into the 
purported spying on the U.S. 
The company said its antivirus 
software simply did its job. A 
contractor put covert malware 
onto his home machine with 
Kaspersky installed. After a 
scan, the antivirus detected 
the new malware, uploaded it 
to Kaspersky’s cloud servers for analysis, and 
at that point the covert data was exposed. 
Kaspersky said once it discovered the govern-
ment-developed malware the code was 
deleted from company servers and never 
delivered to any government agencies.
THE RUSSIANS ARE 
COMING. THE RUSSIANS 
ARE COMING?
For most North Americans, the default is to 
assume the worst about Kaspersky Lab, 
especially because Eugene Kaspersky himself 
was trained at a KGB-run school.
Security experts see some room for 
explanation. It’s not unusual, for one thing, for 
information security (infosec) professionals to 
start in the military or government intelligence 
before entering the private sector.
Kaspersky Lab is actually an important 
player in the infosec community for the useful 
threat information it makes freely available. “I 
think they have probably some of the best

researchers and talents in the world,” said 
Amit Serper, principal security researcher for 
Boston-based infosec company Cybereason. 
Good works aren’t enough to absolve 
Kaspersky, however. That’s why the company 
wants third parties to audit its code. But even 
that won’t satisfy most critics. “I think it’s 
entirely for show, and I think they know that,” 
Williams said. “It’s not a question of ‘is the 
code itself secure?’ I would argue that Kasper-
sky is probably some of the most secure A/V 
code out there right now. It’s a matter of how 
they use the code that’s going to be con-
trolled by the Kaspersky command center.”
Serper offered similar sentiments, but 
added that the data is what most concerns 
him. “What data is collected [from user PCs]? 
How is it collected? How is it saved? How is it 
catalogued? I think it’s a data science question, 
and not a software engineering question.”
WHAT HOME USERS CAN DO
We may never know whether Kaspersky Lab is 
a willing accomplice for Russian intelligence. 
What you can do, however, is stick to the 
basics of PC security and understand your 
“threat model”—the realistic threats that you 
confront as an everyday computer user. If 
you’re an engineer working on infrastructure 
projects, a research scientist, or even a 
journalist, then Russian spying on your 
machine might be part of your threat model, 
says Williams. Those people may want to 
avoid Kaspersky products.
The reality, however, is that Russian intelli-
gence is not interested in the average Ameri-
can’s family photos or personal diaries. As 
Williams pointed out on Twitter (go.pcworld.
com/oot), technicians working on your PC at a 
local computer shop pose a higher risk of data 
theft than Russian intelligence via Kaspersky or 
other software.
“Personally, I don’t think that Kaspersky is 
a threat to the home user,” Serper said.
Williams also wouldn’t advise that most 
home users dump Kaspersky—he hasn’t even 
advised any of his family and friends to delete 
the software. “But if I have a brand-new 
machine,” Williams added. “And I’m trying to 
decide should I install Kaspersky or not? I’m 
not sure that I would.”
That’s not only because of the worries 
about espionage, Williams says, but the 
question of Kaspersky’s long-term fate in the 
U.S. market given current tensions.
Whatever your decision, the worst option 
would be to give up on antivirus altogether. 
“Are you worried about the .01 percent of the 
Advanced Persistent Threat groups [elite and 
state-level hackers] that are probably not 
interested in you,” Williams said. “or are you 
worried about the 99.9 percent of stuff that’s 
going to hurt you? The reality is A/V keeps 
most of that stuff away.”
Besides, this problem is not likely to 
disappear—if anything, more consumer-grade 
software may soon end up in the cross-fire. 
Before reports of Kaspersky surfaced, hackers

linked to China infiltrated and delivered 
malware via the popular PC utility CCleaner 
(go.pcworld.com/ccli). Williams believes we’ll 
see more state-level hackers accelerate their 
computer hacking programs thanks to recent 
high-level leaks of infiltration methods such as 
Vault 7 (go.pcworld.com/v7) and the Shadow 
Brokers hack (go.pcworld.com/sbh).
STAYING SAFE WITH 
ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
To counter these potential problems, Wil-
liams advises home users to stick to big-name 
products as a way to benefit from a digital 
version of herd immunity. “For a product that’s 
widely used,” he said, “a back door in that 
product will be caught much more quickly 
than a product that is sparsely used.”
Serper reminds us to keep our machines 
and software up to date. Vulnerabilities and 
hacking methods that get leaked are much 
easier to pull off because many people 
don’t patch their machines to fix critical 
vulnerabilities.
As usual, basic common sense and security 
practices are your best defense. Rely on good, 
popular software, pick an antivirus that you 
trust, regularly patch your operating system 
and software, and don’t forget to use a reliable 
ad blocker in your browser to guard against 
some common web-based attacks. That may 
not defend you against all possible intrusions, 
but it’s the most reasonable approach short of 
wearing a tinfoil hat and running Linux.

Android Instant Apps:  
What they are and how to  
use them on your phone  
Get apps—no downloading required. BY MICHAEL SIMON
N
ow that Google’s Instant Apps 
(go.pcworld.com/inap) have 
made it to the Play Store, you 
can expect to see a lot more of 
them. While the initial rollout is limited to just 
a handful of apps, dozens of apps and games 
will soon be available in instant form. But 
what exactly are Instant Apps? And how do 
you get them on your phone? We’re here to 
help you get started:

126   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
HERE’S HOW
ANDROID INSTANT APPS
WHAT ARE INSTANT APPS?
Instant Apps are the next step in app 
evolution, a universal Android solution that 
brings the speed and power of a native app 
with the ease and immediacy of a web app. 
They look and operate just like one of the 
apps that are installed on your phone, but you 
don’t need to download anything.
SO INSTANT APPS DON’T 
LIVE ON MY PHONE?
Correct. Using an Instant App is similar to 
browsing a webpage. Once you close the 
window, it disappears.
ARE THERE ANY 
LIMITATIONS?
Yes and no. Instant Apps don’t have any 
technical limitations, and developers can 
deliver things like account signup, 
purchasing, and videos, just like they would 
in a regular app. However, Instant Apps can 
be specifically targeted, so a developer could 
choose to deliver a certain portion of their 
app to a user at a specific time. That would 
effectively “lock” the rest of the app until the 
user decided to download the full version.
DO I NEED TO BE ONLINE TO 
USE INSTANT APPS?
Like Progressive Web Apps, Instant Apps can 
be designed to work online, but some 
features would be accessible only when 
connected to a network.
CAN ANY PHONE RUN 
THEM?
Pretty much. Google says phones going all the 
way back to Jelly Bean can run Instant Apps, 
though some phones may not be capable of 
displaying them.
DO I NEED TO 
SET UP 
ANYTHING TO 
USE THEM?
You need to enable Instant 
Apps for your account on 
your phone. Open the 
Settings app and find your 
Google Account settings. 
Go to Instant Apps, flip the 
toggle on, and tap Yes, I’m 
In on the next screen.
Setting up Instant Apps is as easy as flipping a switch.

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   127
HOW DO I KNOW I’M USING 
AN INSTANT APP?
Well, the point is that you’re not supposed to 
know when you’re running an Instant App. 
They launch just like a regular app would, and 
offer the same experience. But there are a 
couple of telltale signs. For one, most Instant 
Apps will include a link to download the full 
app at the top of the screen. Also, if you’re in 
a browser when you open an Instant App, 
the address bar will disappear when you 
click an Instant link.
CAN I SHARE INSTANT 
APPS?
Yes, and in fact that’s their main advantage. If 
you see an article you like in the Buzzfeed 
app, for example, you can share it with a 
friend and they’ll be able to launch directly 
into that section of the app even if they 
haven’t previously installed it.
HOW DO I FIND AN INSTANT 
APP?
Unless you’re specifically searching for one 
in the Play Store, it’s actually kind of 
random. Someone may send you a link that 
opens up in an instant app, or you could do 
a Google search that sends you to one. To 
test it out, type NYT Crossword into the 
Chrome browser on your Android phone 
and tap on the result with the word 
Instant next to it. Open that link, and you’ll be 
taken to the New York Times Crossword app 
with the ability to work on the current day’s 
mini-puzzle.
You can play 
the daily New 
York Times mini 
crossword as 
an Instant App.

128   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
HERE’S HOW
ANDROID INSTANT APPS
HOW DO I FIND AN INSTANT 
APP IN THE PLAY STORE?
When you visit an app page that has an 
Instant App companion, there will be a 
Try Now button. Tap it and you’ll be taken 
directly to the instant app.
WHICH INSTANT APPS ARE 
AVAILABLE TO TRY?
At launch, there are only a handful of apps to 
try, but more will be added:
•  Hollar (go.pcworld.com/holl)
•  Skyscanner (go.pcworld.com/skys)
•  NYTimes Crossword  
(go.pcworld.com/nyxw)
•  BuzzFeed News (go.pcworld.com/bzzf)
•  Onefootball Live Soccer Scores

•  Red Bull TV (go.pcworld.com/rbtv)
•  Dotloop (go.pcworld.com/l00p)
•  Share The Meal (go.pcworld.com/meal)
CAN I SEE AN INSTANT APPS 
HISTORY? 
If you head back to the Instant Apps tab in 
your Google Account settings, you can see a 
history of the Instant Apps you’ve used. 
Hollar is one of the Instant Apps available to try in the Play Store.

How to choose a TV antenna  
Attention cord cutters: This in-depth guide to TV antenna tech will help you find just the 
right model for tuning in free over-the-air broadcasts. BY MARTYN WILLIAMS
P
utting up a TV antenna is one of 
the best steps you can take to 
breaking your reliance on pay TV. 
Most areas of the U.S. have 
access to several dozen TV channels 
broadcast over the air for free.
A TV antenna will bring them to your TV, 
so you won’t be stuck with the “local 
broadcast TV fee” charged by your cable or 
satellite company. And if you decide to 
subscribe to an online TV provider, you won’t 
need to worry about which ones carry your 
local channels (not all of them do).
As a bonus, they’ll make your big-screen 
TV shine with a better picture than cable or 
satellite can deliver. This is possible because 
those transmissions are typically compressed 
in order to preserve bandwidth, so the service

CHOOSE A TV ANTENNA
providers can cram 
more channels into 
their pipes.
You’ll notice the 
difference in quality 
on the major 
broadcast networks 
mostly, because all of 
them broadcast in 
high definition. Most 
stations broadcast a 
1080i (interlaced 
scanning) signal, 
which is the highest 
resolution currently 
used for OTA TV in the US, but a handful 
transmit at 720p (progressive scanning). Both 
specs are considered to be high definition.
Here’s our five-step guide to choosing the 
right TV antenna:
•  Determine which channels are available 
where you live
•  Choose which channels you want to watch
•  Check the rules on antenna installation 
where you live
•  Figure out which type of antenna you need
• Select the antenna
WHICH CHANNELS ARE 
AVAILABLE ON AN 
ANTENNA?
The first step to choosing a TV antenna is 
figuring out which channels are available 
where you live and of those, which ones you 
want to watch.
To figure out what’s on air where you live, 
head over to TV Fool (go.pcworld.com/f00l). 
It pairs the FCC’s broadcast TV database with 
topographical maps to give you a pretty 
detailed estimation of which signals will reach 
your house and how strong they’ll be.
Enter your house address in the search 
box, hit enter, and you’ll get something like 
the above screenshot in return.
That chart above looks pretty 
complicated, but it’s really not. 
WHICH CHANNELS DO I 
WANT TO WATCH?
At this point, it might be a good idea to check 
the TV guide in a newspaper or website (go.
pcworld.com/tvgd) to determine what’s on 
A screenshot of the TV Fool website showing TV reception in San Francisco.

DECEMBER 2017   PCWorld   131
air and what you want to watch. Make sure 
you choose “antenna” or “over the air” as 
your TV provider in the online program guide, 
so you don’t get cable channels mixed in.
Many TV stations broadcast several 
channels as a digital package, so make sure to 
look at those as well.
Once you’ve made your list, examine the 
TV Fool results to find the channels you want 
to watch. Write down the number in the 
second column, the Real Channel, the 
second-to-last column, the True Azimuth, and 
the color (green yellow, or red). The colors 
will inform you if an indoor antenna will be 
sufficient, or if you’ll need an attic or roof-
mounted model to pull them in.
CAN I PUT UP AN ANTENNA?
In almost all cases, the answer is yes. The 
FCC’s over-the-air reception devices (OTARD) 
rule (go.pcworld.com/rule) gives you the 
right to erect an antenna for the reception of 
over-the-air TV or satellite programming. It 
applies to both homeowners and renters, and 
it overrides the power of home-owners 
associations (HOAs) to block antenna 
deployments. The rule (go.pcworld.com/
le11) covers antennas required for an 
“acceptable quality signal” on your property, 
or if you rent, an area where you have 
exclusive use. The FCC website has full details.
WHICH ANTENNA  
DO I NEED?
TV Fool ranks station in order of predicted 
signal power, with the easiest to receive at the 
top. The green channels can probably be 
received with a simple indoor antenna, yellow 
ones will probably require a larger antenna in 
an attic space or on the roof, and the red ones 
will require a good roof-mounted antenna.
Indoor antennas are typically flat, so 
they’re easy to set up, usually by 
hanging them in a window on the 
side of the house facing the 
transmitter. Some look different, a 
bit like the old ‘rabbit ears’ 
antennas or even like a soundbar 
(go.pcworld.com/sobr), but the 
principle is the same: install them in 
a favorable location.
Indoor antennas are typically 
fine for all the strong local 
channels, but if you want channels 
that are weaker or further away, you

132   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
HERE’S HOW
CHOOSE A TV ANTENNA
might need to go larger and put an antenna in 
your attic space or on your roof.
Compared to the roof, an antenna in the 
attic will probably receive slightly less signal 
because it’s enclosed, but it might be 
enough to get stable TV reception. If you 
hate the look of an outdoor antenna, then 
experiment. An attic-mounted antenna will 
also be easier to maintain.
The direction of the TV transmitter tower is 
also important. If you’re using an indoor 
antenna, you’ll want to put it in a window facing 
that direction. If you’re using an outdoor 
antenna, it will show you which way to point. As 
signals get weaker, going from green to yellow 
to red, the direction is more important. If you 
want to tune in weaker stations from towers in 
different directions, you’ll probably need a 
rotator. This motorized device will turn the 
antenna so that it’s oriented 
to pull in those weaker 
signals.
Knowing the real 
channel number will help 
you select an antenna. TV 
broadcasting in North 
America is spread across 
three frequency bands: low 
VHF (channels 2 through 
6), high VHF (channels 7 
through 13), and UHF 
(channels 14 through 50). 
Because of the different 
frequencies in use, 
antennas are designed to cover one, two or 
three bands. Not every antenna covers them all.
The real channel number helps you figure 
this out. After TV stations went digital, some 
no longer transmit on the channel number 
they announce on air. For example, channel 5 
in San Francisco is actually broadcasting on 
channel 29. That’s why the real channel is 
important in antenna selection.
Be prepared to put up with a lot of 
marketing speak when checking out 
antennas. For the record, there is no such 
thing as an “HD” antenna or “digital” 
antenna—the format of the signals being 
received doesn’t matter—and take those 
“miles” range claims in the product 
specifications with a grain of salt. No 
manufacturer can guarantee their antenna will 
pull in a signal from a given number of miles 
The RCA Skybar is designed to resemble a soundbar and can be mounted 
beneath a wall-hung flat-screen.

because too much depends on local 
topology, signal strength, interference, and 
other factors unique to your location.
Having said that, those range claims are 
useful in evaluating antennas from the same 
manufacturer. It’s a good bet that an antenna 
labeled that claims 65 miles of range is 
generally better for long-distance reception 
than one from the same company that 
claims to deliver 30 miles of range.
ANALYZING YOUR LIST
In the example above, an indoor antenna will 
probably pull in all the green channels coming 
from the transmitter at 240 degrees, and the 
same antenna will also likely work for the third 
channel in the list, which comes from a 
different transmitter at 199 degrees, but has a 
strong signal.
The last station 
on the list will require 
a bit more work. A 
larger antenna is 
probably required, 
and because it’s 
more than 100 
degrees from the 
others, it will 
probably require a 
second antenna or a 
rotator. Now is the 
time to ask yourself if 
that sixth channel is 
worth the extra 
equipment and installation.
Finally, look at those channel numbers. In 
the list, two channels are high VHF (12 and 7) 
and the rest are UHF, so you’ll need an 
antenna that covers both those bands.
DO I NEED A SIGNAL 
AMPLIFIER OR A ROTATOR?
If you’re unable to receive distant TV stations 
due to low signal levels, you should consider 
a signal amplifier. It’s always best to collect as 
much signal as possible at the antenna, so 
don’t skimp on a small one and try to make up 
A TV antenna with rotator installed.
If you’re unable to receive 
distant TV stations due to low 
signal levels, you should 
consider a signal amplifier. 

134   PCWorld   DECEMBER 2017
HERE’S HOW

for it with an amplifier. But if a large antenna 
still won’t pull in the station without picture 
breakup, a signal amplifier might help. You 
also might need one if you have an 
excessively long run of cable, say from a 
distant spot on a piece of land to a house.
A rotator will turn the TV antenna in any 
direction with the click of a remote. These are 
useful if you want to receive stations from 
several different locations.
WHAT TYPE OF CABLE DO I 
NEED FOR A TV ANTENNA?
The connection from your antenna to your TV is 
every bit as important as the antenna itself. You 
need a high-quality coaxial cable (“coax” for 
short) for the job. Coax has a center wire that 
carries the signal and is surrounded by a plastic 
insulator. An outer braid shields the center 
cable from interference, and an outer sheath to 
protect the cable from the elements.
Don’t be tempted to save a few dollars 
reusing old coax. Buy new coax in the length 
you need. Try to avoid coupling two cables 
together, as each union will result in a little 
signal loss. The most common type of cable 
for TV is called RG-6.
A FINAL WORD OF ADVICE
Predicting which antenna will work with 
certainty is almost impossible. The 
information garnered from sites like TV Fool 
will provide a strong indication of what should 
work, but there are other variables at work.
In some areas, such as cities or hilly places, 
signals can bounce off obstacles like buildings 
and cause interference, trees can grow leaves 
in the spring and block stations you got fine in 
the winter, and atmospheric 
conditions can alter the way 
signals reach your house.
Moving an antenna just 
a little to one side or up 
and down a window can 
have a big effect on 
reception. If you’re putting 
up an external antenna, 
one side of your roof might 
bring in nothing while the 
other side provides perfect 
reception. 
Be prepared to 
experiment.

How to type emoji on your  
PC using Windows 10 Fall 
Creators Update  
Why should smartphones have all the fun? BY MARK HACHMAN
H
ow can I type emoji on my PC 
keyboard? It’s a question that 
you’ve probably asked, given 
up on, shrugged, and then 
pulled out your smartphone. Now, with 
Windows 10 and the Fall Creators Update 
(go.pcworld.com/4all), a new emoji 
keyboard will make adding emoji to Twitter, 
Facebook, and other apps a snap. 
While there’s nothing wrong with a good 
old-fashioned smiley-face :) or GIF, an emoji is 
a simple way to add a bit of fun to your 
IMAGE: iSTOCK

HERE’S HOW
TYPE EMOJI ON A PC
communications. That’s the whole point of 
emoji, after all! And while they’ve been part of 
smartphone culture for years, Microsoft has 
now added its easy emoji keyboard to 
Windows 10. For now, we’ll show you how to 
bring up emoji under the current version of 
Windows 10 (the Creators Update, which 
many of you still have), and how it will 
become easier once the Fall Creators Update 
drops. (We used Insider Build 16215 [go.
pcworld.com/inbu] for testing, then checked 
it against the Fall Creators Update, itself.)
HOW TO TYPE EMOJI UNDER 
WINDOWS 10
What was so annoying about the state of 
emoji in the Windows 10 Creators Update is 
that Microsoft almost, but not quite, had it 
right. A tool called the On-Screen Keyboard is 
actually an accessibility app that you can 
launch using the Start menu, or, via the 
Control Panel, trigger to launch whenever 
you boot Windows.
The On-Screen keyboard is not an emoji 
app, however, and trying to type a smiley face 
simply types in text: a colon and a closed 
parentheses symbol. Given that the on-screen 
keyboard is rather detailed, you would think 
that emoji could be built right in. Nope.
If you’re lucky enough to have a tablet, 
emoji are accessible only if you undock the 
tablet and put it into tablet mode. In tablet 
mode, you’ll see an on-screen keyboard icon 
appear in the lower right-hand corner of your 
taskbar. It’s this keyboard that allows you to 
type in emoji within the Creators Update—if 
you enjoy typing on glass while trying to 
tweet or send email.
Discovering that Microsoft allows emoji in 
one on-screen keyboard but not in the other 
was the sort of design decision that, as a user, 
made you want to tear your hair out. 
Fortunately, Microsoft has resolved that 
issue with the Fall Creators Update.

HOW TO LAUNCH THE 
EMOJI KEYBOARD WITHIN 
WINDOWS 10 FALL 
CREATORS UPDATE 
Once you receive the Windows 10 Fall 
Creators Update, here’s how to launch the 
emoji keyboard within Windows 10: either 
use the WIN + . (the period punctuation 
mark) key, or else the WIN + ; (semi-colon) 
key. Either will open the new emoji keyboard.
There, you’ll find the standard range of 
emoji, from people to food to sports, plus 
Microsoft-specific emoji like the ninjacat. You 
can navigate among the various “tabs” or 
categories of emoji via the Tab key, and 
touch or mouse to the one you’d like, or use 
the arrow keys. The Enter key selects the 
proper emoji.
There’s one catch: Somewhat inexplicably, 
you can enter only one emoji at a time. After 
you enter your emoji, the keyboard 
disappears. That means, of 
course, that if you want to really 
emphasize a point—
, for 
example—you’ll have to 
re-invoke the keyboard three 
separate times, or just copy 
and paste. Unfortunately, the 
emoji keyboard isn’t a true, 
draggable window, either—it 
remains in place.
There’s one other option 
you should know about: On 
the very first tab of the emoji 
keyboard (and only that tab, for now) there’s a 
small “swatch” of what looks like fabric to the 
upper right, near the X icon to close the emoji 
window. The swatch represents a global 
adjustment for the skin tone for each emoji, 
which you may vary as you choose.
If there’s any downside to Microsoft’s 
emoji window, it’s that developers have 
already coded in solutions to fix the issue. If 
you post something to Facebook, or use 
the Web app that Twitter provides, each 
service will present you with a small emoji 
icon to add whatever emoji you’d like, 
regardless of whether you have the Fall 
Creators Update.
That’s not the case for all apps, though. 
And Microsoft’s own—Word, PowerPoint, 
Mail, and others—lack the capabilities that the 
new emoji keyboard adds. Now that the 
emoji keyboard has dropped within the Fall 
Creators Update, it’s cause for 
! 
Some developers have already taken action to add emoji.
