Hox Modules in Evolution  
and Development
Few, if any, genes have had the same level of impact on the field of evolutionary-
developmental biology (evo-devo) as the Hox genes. These genes are renowned for 
their roles in patterning the body plans and development of the animal kingdom. 
This is complemented by the distinctive organisation of these genes in the genome, 
with them frequently being found as clusters in which gene position is linked to when 
and where the individual genes are expressed, particularly during embryogenesis. 
This book provides the latest overviews of Hox gene organisation and function for 
major clades of animals from across the animal kingdom. With the rapidly increas-
ing availability of high-quality whole genome sequences from an ever-expanding 
range of species, it is becoming increasingly evident that there is great diversity in 
the organisation of Hox genes. These great strides in genome sequencing are wed-
ded to important developments in our ability to detect expression and disrupt gene 
function in species that are not traditionally genetically amenable animals. These 
technical developments are integrated with wide taxon-sampling in this volume to 
provide new perspectives on the roles of Hox genes in understanding fundamental 
issues such as embryo patterning, mechanisms of gene regulation, homology, evolv-
ability, evolutionary novelties, phylogeny, the role of gene and genome duplications 
in evolution, and ancestral states for major clades of animals.

Series Preface
In recent decades, evolutionary principles have been integrated into biological dis-
ciplines such as developmental biology, ecology, and genetics. As a result, major 
new fields emerged, chief among which are Evolutionary Developmental Biology (or 
Evo-Devo) and Ecological Developmental Biology (or Eco-Devo). Inspired by the 
integration of knowledge of change over single life spans (ontogenetic history) and 
change over evolutionary time (phylogenetic history), evo-devo produced a unifica-
tion of developmental and evolutionary biology that generated unanticipated syn-
ergies: Molecular biologists employ computational and conceptual tools generated 
by developmental biologists and by systematists, while evolutionary biologists use 
detailed analysis of molecules in their studies. These integrations have shifted para-
digms and enabled us to answer questions once thought intractable.
Major highlights in the development of modern Evo-Devo are a comparison of 
the evolutionary behaviour of cells, evidenced in Stephen J. Gould’s 1979 proposal of 
changes in the timing of the activity of cells during development—heterochrony—
as a major force in evolutionary change, and numerous studies demonstrating how 
conserved gene families across numerous cell types “explain” development and evo-
lution. Advances in technology and in instrumentation now allow cell biologists to 
make ever more detailed observations of the structure of cells and the processes by 
which cells arise, divide, differentiate, and die. In recent years, cell biologists have 
increasingly asked questions whose answers require insights from evolutionary his-
tory. As just one example: How many cell types are there and how are they related? 
Given this conceptual basis, cell biology—a rich field in biology with history going 
back centuries—is poised to be reintegrated with evolution to provide a means of 
organising and explaining diverse empirical observations and testing fundamental 
hypotheses about the cellular basis of life. Integrating evolutionary and cellular biol-
ogy has the potential to generate new theories of cellular function and to create a new 
field, Evolutionary Cell Biology.
Mechanistically, cells provide the link between the genotype and the phenotype, 
both during development and in evolution. Hence, the proposal for a series of books 
under the general theme of Evolutionary Cell Biology: Translating Genotypes into 
Phenotypes, to document, demonstrate, and establish the central role played by cel-
lular mechanisms in the evolution of all forms of life.

Preface
The discovery in the mid-1980s of the homeobox motif within the Hox genes of 
Drosophila melanogaster, rapidly followed by the finding that the motif was also 
present in homologous genes across much of the animal kingdom, including humans, 
was truly revolutionary. The description of the homeobox as being the Rosetta stone 
of biology was no understatement. The discovery ushered in revolutions in both 
developmental biology and evolutionary biology and very rapidly led to the dramatic 
rejuvenation and expansion of the interface between them, evolutionary developmen­
tal biology (evo-devo), now with a new molecular and cellular perspective.
There was palpable excitement through the 1990s as these genes were discovered 
in ever increasing numbers of animal species and their expression was consistent 
with roles in embryonic patterning similar to those that were originally defined in 
Drosophila (and mice). This ability to delve into the molecular control of body plan 
patterning and development and make comparisons over vast evolutionary distances 
drew widespread attention and created excitement not only amongst evolutionary 
and developmental biologists, but also much more generally, even beyond working 
scientists, to journalists, film, and documentary makers.
One of the most recent books focused on Hox gene biology was “Hox genes: stud­
ies from the 20th to the 21st century” edited by Jean S. Deutsch (2010) (in the series, 
Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, Springer Science and Business 
Media, LLC; Landes Bioscience). Prof Deutsch began that book, “Are the Hox genes 
so important? Frankly, it is but a rhetorical question…. the Hox genes are indeed so 
important that their study will not end with the 20th century.” He then proceeded 
to compare the importance of the discovery of the homeobox to the unravelling of 
the structure of DNA (Watson and Crick) and the finding that gene regulation is 
genetically determined (Lwoff, Jacob, and Monod). Whether or not one agrees with 
these precise comparisons (and personally, I do), it is clear that the magnitude of the 
discovery of the homeobox is extremely significant to biology. Also, a book updating 
the biology involving these genes is long overdue, particularly given the rapid devel­
opments that have occurred since 2010.
The Hox genes perfectly exemplify the two sides of the same coin that typifies the 
field of evo-devo. On one side, there is deep homology and conservation of the genes 
that control development over hundreds of millions of years, whilst on the other there 
are the changes to development that involve evolution of these same genes that is inte­
gral to the generation of biological diversity. I think that it is fair to say that very, very 
few (if any) developmental gene networks do not include a homeobox-encoding gene 
at some point. Or that any tissue or cell type does not include a role for a homeobox 
gene in its construction or function. Focusing more specifically on the homeobox-
encoding genes of the Hox super-family (i.e. those genes orthologous to the genes of 
the Drosophila and mammalian Hox gene clusters), the roles of Hox genes are not 
simply restricted to the patterning of the embryonic anterior-posterior axis, but also 
include functions in morphogenesis, organogenesis, regeneration, and disease.

xii
Preface
Hox gene clusters and the intriguing phenomenon of collinearity in both flies and 
humans, whereby the order of the genes along the chromosome corresponds with 
their order of expression and function along the anterior-posterior embryonic axis, 
are firmly embedded in biology textbooks and are familiar to anyone that has studied 
biology. What is often overlooked in these textbook types of summaries is the diver­
sity in the organisation of the Hox genes, both in terms of their genomic organisation 
and their expression. This sort of diversity is, however, the bread-and-butter fare of 
evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) and provides the potential to under­
stand both the origin and subsequent diversification of whatever clades or lineages 
of animals are of interest.
This book provides an essential and timely progress report on Hox gene research, 
taking a deliberate phylogenetically broad approach across the animals, and with 
each chapter written by experts in both the respective animals as well as the Hox 
genes themselves. These authors are also directly responsible for generating much of 
the data being reviewed and reported in this volume. Recent technological develop­
ments in both genome sequencing and gene manipulation mean that such a phyloge­
netically wide approach is more feasible and productive than ever. Since such a wide 
comparative approach is also absolutely vital to the aim of inferring fundamental 
generalities in biology, now is a particularly exciting time for Hox research and this 
book marks a key stage in this new era of Hox biology and evo-devo.

1.1  THE REVOLUTION OF EVO-DEVO
The Hox genes are a renowned and hugely important subset of developmental control 
genes in animals. The molecular characterisation of these genes began in the 1980s 
and utterly transformed developmental biology, as well as rejuvenating the field of 
evolutionary developmental biology (often abbreviated to evo-devo). A wealth of 
research has accumulated since the early days of molecular biology, with the Hox 
genes representing some of the best exemplars of the two sides of the evo-devo coin: 
deep homology versus diversification. This book aims to capture some of the latest 
developments in the field of Hox evo-devo research, illustrating the rich vein that 
these genes have provided for deepening our understanding of the origins and diver­
sification of huge swathes of the animal kingdom.
Hox genes are homeobox-containing genes; the homeobox is a distinctive nucleo­
tide motif, typically of 180bp, that encodes a homeodomain, which in turn acts as a 
sequence-specific DNA-binding motif. Hox proteins thus tend to act as transcription 
factors. Few, if any, developmental gene pathways or regulatory networks do not 
involve homeobox genes. Although the Hox genes are most renowned for their roles 
in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of animals during embryogenesis (Akam, 
1989; McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992), the genes also have a multitude of activities 
and effects beyond this anterior-posterior patterning role, with complex regulatory 
landscapes facilitating activities in morphogenesis and organogenesis (Saurin et al., 

2
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
2018; Hajirnis and Mishra, 2021). As such, the Hox genes have had a major role in the 
expansion and development of the field of evo-devo, following the discovery of the 
homeobox in the Hox genes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and then 
the rapid follow-on discoveries of conservation of the homeobox and homologous 
Hox genes across almost the entire animal kingdom, including in humans (McGinnis, 
1984a, b; Scott and Weiner, 1984; Hart et al., 1985; Levine et al., 1985; Boncinelli 
et al., 1988; Duboule and Dollé, 1989; Graham et al., 1989; Gehring, 1994; Lewis, 
1994; McGinnis, 1994). This widespread conservation of these homologous genes, 
their action in comparable and often homologous developmental processes, and their 
major roles in shaping animal body plans, with roles in generating both the similari­
ties and differences between animal forms, has had a profound impact on biology 
and our understanding of the evolution of animal diversity.
1.2  HOMEOTIC HOX HOMEOBOX GENES
The name homeobox derives from the phenomenon of homeosis described by 
William Bateson in his 1894 book Materials for the Study of Variation (reprinted 
as Bateson, 1992), for which the Hox genes of D. melanogaster are the best-known 
examples at the level of the genetics of such mutants. Homeosis entails one region 
or part of the body being transformed into another. One way to think of this is that 
things have not been deleted, duplicated, expanded or reduced, but instead the iden­
tity of something has changed such that its developmental fate becomes one that is 
usually located in a different place in the body plan.
Some of the most famous homeotic mutants are Antennapedia, in which the 
antennae are transformed into legs (Gehring, 1966), or the Ubx four-winged fly 
(described in Chapter 2 by Karch and Maeda) in which the third thoracic segment 
instead develops with the identity of the wing-bearing second thoracic segment. The 
key feature of these types of mutants is that one region of the body is transformed 
such that it develops as another part of the body – i.e. it is homeotically transformed 
(Lewis, 1978, 1994). The genes effected by these mutations thus give particular 
regions or parts of the body their ‘identity’ and are entwined with the concept of 
positional information in embryogenesis, in this case in terms of a ‘Hox code’ – 
whereby a particular combination of Hox proteins specify the identity of a region of 
the body or a particular structure (Lewis, 1978; Wolpert, 1996). Thus, when the fly 
homeotic genes of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes (ANT-C and BX-C, 
respectively) were first cloned via the then pioneering techniques of genomic walk­
ing (Bender et al., 1983; Garber et al., 1983; Scott et al., 1983) and low stringency 
DNA hybridisation, and their DNA sequences revealed to have a conserved motif 
(McGinnis et al., 1984a, b; Scott and Weiner, 1984), it made perfect sense to call 
the motif the homeobox. Despite repeated use of the term ‘Hox’ in the literature 
interchangeably for homeobox, the Hox genes are in fact only a subset of homeobox-
containing genes; being those genes that are orthologs of the genes of the fly and 
mouse/human Hox gene clusters (Scott, 1992; Ferrier, 2016a) (Figure 1.1A). Thus, 
whilst the human genome contains over 200 homeobox genes and arthropods like 
D. melanogaster over 100 (Holland et al., 2007; Chipman et al., 2014), there are 
only 39 human Hox genes and eight Hox genes in D. melanogaster (but with other

homeobox-containing genes within the ANT-C part of the Hox cluster derived from 
bona fide Hox genes, i.e. zerknüllt 1 and 2 and bicoid from Hox 3, and fushi tarazu 
from a medial Hox gene perhaps with affinity to Lox5 or Hox6 of lophotrochozoans 
or deuterostomes, respectively; Falciani et al., 1996; Telford, 2000) (Figure 1.1A). 
It is these Hox genes and their orthologs across the animal kingdom that this book 
focuses on (Figure 1.1B).
1.3  A NEW ERA OF WIDER TAXON-SAMPLING
Our understanding of the function and regulation of Hox genes in Drosophila is 
resolved to unprecedented detail, stemming from the elegant and thorough work in 
genetics by Ed Lewis and colleagues, and flourishing still further with the impact 
of developments in molecular techniques for the BX-C (as outlined by Karch and 
Maeda in Chapter 2), and in parallel for the ANT-C (see (Denell, 1994) for a per­
spective on the early genetic studies of the ANT-C, which were later expanded 
by the Kaufman lab and many others). This detailed knowledge of Drosophila 
is complemented by the elegant and detailed work in vertebrates, particularly in 
mice (e.g. Kmita and Duboule, 2003; Montavon et al., 2011; Nolte et al., 2013; Ahn 
et al., 2014; Lonfat et al., 2014; Darbellay et al., 2019; Amandio et al., 2021). Whilst 
there is clearly much more to be understood about Hox genes and their activities in 
Drosophila and mice, the extent of the similarities and differences between these 
so-called model species to other taxa is still largely an unresolved mystery. However, 
we are now entering an era in which this mystery can be clarified, with techniques 
becoming available that permit efficient exploration of molecular mechanisms with­
out requiring the heroic efforts such as those exerted by Ed Lewis in unravelling the 
genetics of a species, so that there is the possibility of exploring taxa largely driven 
by their phylogenetic position or mode of development, instead of their amenability 
to genetic approaches. The early description of the Hox genes as the Rosetta stone 
for developmental biology (Slack, 1984) is even more apposite now than ever, with 
the genes providing a rapid means to delve into the molecular mechanisms of how 
animal form is constructed and how it evolved. This book thus comes at a time when 
the field is rich with possibilities, and the authors here give a clear overview of where 
the field is going.
Starting from the detailed mechanistic understanding of Hox gene regulation 
and function that can be obtained in more ‘traditional’ study species like D. mela­
nogaster (see Karch and Maeda, Chapter 2), the power of wider taxon sampling 
is clearly demonstrated in subsequent chapters. Moving progressively further away 
from Drosophila, phylogenetically speaking, Zattara and Moczek (Chapter 3) use 
other insects, the horn-bearing beetles, as a system to understand the evo-devo of 
novel morphologies and evolvability – long-standing issues and debates in evolution­
ary biology that are now getting a new perspective from evo-devo and Hox studies 
in particular. Beyond insects, Sharma (Chapter 4) uses the chelicerate arthropods 
(i.e. spiders, mites, sea spiders and horseshoe crabs) to study the impacts of whole 
genome duplication (WGD) and the importance of understanding the underlying 
species phylogeny (which Hox genes can contribute to) in order to make accurate 
and appropriate evolutionary inferences.

5
Introduction to Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
These chelicerate WGDs are an intriguing case of a clade that has experienced 
WGDs that have been a key factor in shaping the structure, organisation and content 
of these genomes, with processes such as duplication-degeneration-complementation 
(DDC) (Force et al., 1999) impacting the evolution of the regulation and function of 
the developmental control genes (e.g. Schwager et al., 2017; Leite et al., 2018). Hox 
genes have been and are proving to be key study systems to better understand the 
impacts of gene duplication, via processes such as WGD, as a route to increased 
genetic diversity and its interplay with developmental and morphological evolution.
The more well-known instance of WGD shaping the genomes of a large clade is 
the case of the vertebrates. It is now well-established that the genomes of the gna­
thostome (jawed) vertebrates were shaped by two rounds of WGD (the 2R hypoth­
esis) (Lamb, 2021; Nakatani et al., 2021), with further instances of additional WGD 
in lineages such as the teleosts (i.e. the teleost 3R WGD; Amores et al., 1998; Taylor 
et al., 2001; Aase-Remedios and Ferrier, 2021). Resolution of these 2R and 3R events 
in gnathostomes has been significantly improved with non-teleost data such as that 
from chondrichthyans (see Kuraku, Chapter 5), which now reveals the dynamics of 
post-2R Hox evolution to unprecedented detail, including gene and cluster losses in 
distinct lineages and unusual or distinctive divergences (e.g. HoxC genes), as well as 
cryptic pan-vertebrate genes like Hox14 (Kuraku et al., 2016). Furthermore, a major 
area of debate with regards to the 2R vertebrate events is how do the jawless cyclo­
stome vertebrates (or agnathans) fit into the picture. Are they also descended from 
the same 2R events that shaped the gnathostomes, or not? And if not, then did they 
experience just one of the 2R events (i.e. cyclostomes diverged after 1R) or neither of 
the 2R WGDs? Clearly, there are large numbers of paralogs in cyclostome genomes 
and so they certainly did undergo large-scale duplications of some sort, but the dif­
ficulties that have been experienced over the years in reliably placing cyclostome 
genes into molecular phylogenetic trees have contributed to a diversity of opinions 
on how to interpret the data. The chapter of Pascual-Anaya and Böhmer (Chapter 6) 
gives an update on the cyclostome field and the prominent role that Hox genes have 
played in it. They provide a new hypothesis for the state of the last common ancestor 
of vertebrates in terms of the array of Hox gene clusters that it possessed.
If we move deeper into the deuterostomes, beyond the vertebrates, we encounter 
one of the most unusual body plans in the animal kingdom: that of the pentameral 
echinoderms. Given the key role that the Hox genes play in patterning the anterior-­
posterior axis of bilaterian animals, many in the field of echinoderm evo-devo have 
been focused on how these genes might pattern the pentameral body plan and hence 
how such a novel morphology evolved. Omori and Irie (Chapter 7) provide an over­
view of the latest echinoderm Hox research, demonstrating the clear value of wide 
taxon sampling and extending beyond what has historically been the major echino­
derm study system of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to obtain 
a clear picture of what constitutes the echinoderm Hox complement and organisation 
and how these genes are deployed during echinoderm development. Data from such 
a wide selection of species, sampling from all of the extant echinoderm classes, has 
clearly been essential to construct a more reliable picture of the ancestral state for 
this intriguing phylum and facilitate more robust comparisons to other bilaterian 
phyla. Wide taxon sampling is key.

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Until relatively recently, a major part of the animal kingdom was largely neglected 
in molecular evo-devo research, i.e. the phyla of the Lophotrochozoa/Spiralia. 
Perhaps this was in large part due to the traditional study species in developmental 
biology being from the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia (i.e. D. melanogaster as an 
ecdysozoan and vertebrates like mice and zebrafish being deuterostomes). This rela­
tive neglect is now being rectified, as demonstrated by the chapters by Wollesen and 
Wanninger, and Gasiorowski and colleagues (Chapters 8 and 9 respectively). As well 
as providing insights into some of the most morphologically diverse phyla, such as 
the molluscs, and the roles of Hox genes in shaping these body plans and the novel­
ties they contain, this lophotrochozoan data is also proving valuable in shaping our 
views on the links between Hox cluster organisation and the regulation of the genes. 
Co-option as a major process in evo-devo (True and Carroll, 2002) is a common 
theme in the Hox genes of these lophotrochozoan taxa, with Hox genes frequently 
being redeployed from their pleisiomorphic ancestral roles in axial patterning into 
apomorphies or evolutionary novelties. Pending functional genetic data, it is pre­
sumed that the Hox genes have an integral role in controlling at least some aspect 
of the development of these evolutionary novelties. Thus, we come full circle in the 
chapters of this book, with Hox roles in anterior-posterior patterning in insects like 
the fruit fly alongside co-option into the evolution of novelties like beetle horns, to 
Hox roles in both axial patterning and development of novelties in lophotrochozoans 
like the molluscs, largely via the evolution of the regulation of the Hox genes.
1.4  COMPLEX REGULATORY LANDSCAPES: MICROMANAGEMENT 
AND COLLINEARITY
One of the early stumbling blocks to the widespread adoption of ideas on roles for 
Hox gene changes in evolution was the perception that mutation of these genes would 
always have dramatic impacts, usually early in embryogenesis, that would lead to 
large changes that would almost always be detrimental (akin to the idea of hopeful 
monsters attributed to Goldschmidt, 1940). With the current much deeper under­
standing of the complexities and modularity of the regulation of the Hox genes and 
their roles in development, it is clear that we no longer have to hypothesise hopeful 
monsters. Instead, Hox genes can be viewed as micro-managers rather than master 
control genes – hopeful monsters are not necessarily impossible, but are certainly 
not required for Hox changes to have significant roles in evo-devo (Akam, 1998a, 
b). The micro-manager idea was stimulated by research on Hox gene regulation and 
pleiotropy, emphasising the importance both of modular regulatory elements and the 
highly dynamic expression of Hox genes in time and space, as well as the abundance 
of target genes, all of which can accumulate multiple small changes over the vast 
periods of evolutionary time to sum to apparently saltational changes when compar­
ing extant taxa that diverged many millions of years ago (Akam, 1998a, b; Buffry 
and McGregor, 2022). In time, the detailed understanding of Hox gene regulation 
and function that we possess for D. melanogaster will be extended across the animal 
kingdom, providing even greater explanatory power to Hox genes and evo-devo.
Hox gene regulation also provides one of the major phenomena that the Hox 
genes are renowned for: Collinearity. This entails the order of the genes along the 

7
Introduction to Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
chromosome corresponding to the order that the genes are expressed along the 
anterior-posterior axis, both in terms of their domains of expression (spatial col­
linearity) and the sequence in which they are activated (temporal collinearity – with 
anterior acting genes expressed first, through to posterior genes being activated last) 
(Von Allmen et al., 1996; Ferrier and Minguillón, 2003; Deschamps and Duboule, 
2017; Krumlauf, 2018; Duboule, 2022). Nevertheless, it is clear that there are many 
cases of Hox genes not being clustered (Lemons and McGinnis, 2006; Monteiro 
and Ferrier, 2006), and a range of types of Hox gene organisation are recognised 
(Duboule, 2007). A potentially unifying principle behind the organisation of the 
Hox genes presumably relates to how these genes are regulated, following the abun­
dant evidence for various long-range regulatory processes and phenomena such as 
topologically associating domains (TADs) (Acemel et  al., 2016; Duboule, 2022), 
shared enhancers (Sharpe et al., 1998; Kmita and Duboule, 2003; Ahn et al., 2014; 
Miller and Posakony, 2020; and see Chapter 2 by Karch and Maeda), intermingled 
enhancers (Shippy et al., 2008), chromatin modulation (Chambeyron and Bickmore, 
2004; Chambeyron et al., 2005), insulator/boundary elements and collinearity of 
enhancers (see Chapter 2 by Karch and Maeda), all of these things creating regula­
tory landscapes over Hox clusters at least in some taxa. From views on collinear­
ity being focused on the overall spatial and temporal activation of the genes, with 
the pre-­eminence of temporal collinearity being viewed as the major process or 
mechanism(s) constraining the Hox genes in intact, ordered clusters in the genome 
(e.g. Duboule, 1994; Von Allmen et al., 1996; Ferrier and Holland, 2002; Ferrier 
and Minguillón, 2003; Monteiro and Ferrier, 2006; Deschamps and Duboule, 2017; 
Pascual-Anaya et  al., 2018; Duboule, 2022), the lophotrochozoan data has been 
responsible for stimulating more nuanced views, such as sub-cluster temporal col­
linearity (Wang et al., 2017; Ferrier, 2019; see Chapter 9 by Gasiorowski et al.). Once 
again wider taxon sampling has been key.
We are still quite some way from having a clear overview of collinearity, in terms 
of what it actually constitutes, how it is achieved, and the diversity or universality of 
mechanisms and processes that are under its umbrella. But we now have a clearer 
prospect for resolving the issue(s) than ever before, with the rapid developments in 
genome sequencing and functional genetics, all driven by the essential requirement 
for wide taxon sampling, as clearly demonstrated in this book. This will go hand-
in-hand with the continued development and refinement of the key techniques that 
are integral to this science. Functional genetics in diverse species that do not have 
a history of or amenability to classical genetic approaches was opened up by the 
various approaches to RNA interference (RNAi) and is now experiencing a further 
revolution with the application of the CRISPR/Cas technique (see the discussions 
in Chapters 3 and 4 by Zattarra and Moczek, and Sharma, respectively). Genome 
and transcriptome sequencing became more affordable, and hence feasible, with the 
advent of so-called next-gen sequencing, and these rapid technical developments 
have continued with the invention and wide application of such techniques as long-
molecule sequencing and Hi-C sequencing to produce much better genome sequence 
assemblies, often now to the level of whole chromosome resolution. This degree of 
resolution is essential for robustly identifying linkage and clustering of genes like 
the Hox genes and the genomic context that they evolved and function in (Pollard

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
and Holland, 2000; Garcia-Fernàndez, 2005; Butts et al., 2008; Ferrier, 2016a). 
Understanding the significance of Hox gene organisation goes hand-in-hand with 
understanding how the genes are expressed (in time and space) and what develop­
mental functions this expression is entwined with. This is exemplified throughout 
the chapters of this book.
1.5  AND THERE IS MORE
We have not been able to capture all of the research that is ongoing in the area of 
Hox gene evo-devo and could easily fill another book (or more) with Hox research in 
other taxa, impacting further evolutionary and developmental concepts and biologi­
cal processes.
We could have included other parts of the animal kingdom, such as non-­bilaterians 
(including sea anemones and jellyfish) to help understand the evolutionary transi­
tion between the diploblasts and triploblasts (or radially symmetrical and bilaterian 
animals, depending on one’s perspective) (DuBuc et al., 2018; He et al., 2018). Or 
even more basal lineages in the animal phylogeny, such as sponges (Porifera) and 
comb jellies (Ctenophora) to understand the origin of the Hox genes themselves, 
relative to other homeobox gene families (Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012; Fortunato 
et al., 2014; Ferrier, 2016b). Also, the gnathostome vertebrates (such as the various 
jawed fish) have been the source for important research on Hox paralog evolution 
(or ohnolog evolution – ohnolog being the name given to paralogs produced from 
WGD, in tribute to Susumo Ohno who first hypothesised a major role for WGD in 
chordate evolution; Ohno, 1970; Wolfe, 2000) and morphological innovations such 
as the paired appendages and digits, appendage positions, or varied vertebral transi­
tions, to name but a few (Burke et al., 1995; Mallo, 2018; Moreau et al., 2019; Meyer 
et al., 2021). We could also have explored the diversity of examples of evolution via 
changes to Hox regulation versus changes to protein-coding sequences, as a major 
route to exploring the debates about the relative balance of such changes in evo-devo 
and how the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) containing Hox genes evolve (e.g. 
Greer et al., 2000; Ronshaugen et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2019; Allais-Bonnet et al., 
2021; Lynch and Wagner, 2021). Also on a regulatory theme, research on the Hox 
cluster of D. melanogaster was pioneering in discovering activities of non-coding 
RNA genes (Sànchez-Herrero and Akam, 1989), which has blossomed into roles 
for microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and antisense RNA transcripts, with Hox 
examples often leading the way for our understanding of how these ‘RNA’ genes 
work (De Kumar and Krumlauf, 2016) (also see Chapters 2 and 5 by Karch and 
Maeda, and Kuraku, respectively). This book is clearly to be viewed as a selective 
sample of Hox evo-devo research.
1.6  CONCLUSION
A core theme of this book and Hox research is the comparative method. The power 
of the comparative method is intrinsic to understanding fundamental aspects of 
biology, such as pattern formation, cell fate determination, morphogenesis, GRNs, 
homology and the origins of form in both ontogenesis and evolutionary time, and so

Introduction to Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
how evolution has produced the incredible biodiversity that we see around us today 
(as well as everything that has existed in the past and is now extinct). The scope and 
power of this comparative method combined with the revolution of Hox genes cannot 
be underestimated. Hox genes are now firmly established as fundamental elements in 
two major traditional branches of biology, Developmental Biology and Evolutionary 
Biology, and offer one of the most fertile and powerful integrated overlaps of the 
two, which is now firmly established as the field of Evo-Devo. Hox gene research has 
been truly revolutionary and shows every indication of continuing to be so.

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
2.1  HISTORY
The Hox gene saga began in 1915 with the discovery of the first homeotic mutation 
by Calvin Bridges which he named bithorax (bx; Bridges and Morgan 1923). Like all 
arthropods, the body of Drosophila is built of segments that are morphologically very 
easy to visualize and to distinguish from one another. Drosophila belongs to the class 
of insects and harbors three thoracic segments (T1, T2 and T3). Flies homozygous for 
the bx mutation have their anterior part of T3 developing like a copy of the anterior 
part of T2. It is important to note here that the high variety of morphological structures 
emanating from the exoskeletons of arthropods (legs, eyes, bristles, wings, antenna, 
cuticle etc.) can be used as a readout of the underlying genetic activity of the organism. 
Any alteration in these morphological traits is easy to recognize upon simple examina­
tion, explaining why the Drosophila model system has been very fruitful for identify­
ing numerous mutant phenotypes. Most mutant phenotypes give rise to malformation 
and/or abortive differentiation of the normal body structures. The case of the bx muta­
tion of Calvin Bridges is, however, different because in the homozygote, the anterior 
part of T3 looks like a perfect copy of the anterior part of T2: in other words, it is fully 
differentiated. The term homeosis had been proposed by Bateson in 1894 to describe 
the transformation of a particular structure into the likeness of another (Bateson 1894). 
The gene affected by the bx mutation became the first homeotic “gene” and this finding 
later revolutionized the way scientists thought and approached developmental biology. 
From that time, additional homeotic mutations affecting the identities of T3 and the 
first abdominal segments (A1) were identified by renowned pioneers of the Drosophila 
genetics field (Bridges and Morgan 1923; Hollander 1937). Complementation stud­
ies of these mutations, however, turned out to be rather complex, with mutations that 
sometimes complemented each other in a given context and failed to complement 
in a different context. It was difficult to conclude if these different mutations were 
alleles of the same gene or instead were hits in adjacent genes. Because of this, the 
term pseudoallelism was coined for this phenomenon (McClintock 1944) (see below). 
The ­pseudoallelic series formed around the bx mutation fascinated a young Ed Lewis, 
whose primary focus in the late thirties was to understand the nature of the gene and 
how genes evolve to give rise to new functions. From 1940 to his passing in 2003, he 
continuously analyzed this appealing locus, which led to him being awarded a Nobel 
prize in 1995 together with fellow developmental geneticists Christiane Nüsslein-
Volhard and Eric Wieschaus. In 1955, he published an ultrafine genetic dissection of 
five mutants, (bx, Cbx, Ubx, bxd and pbx), producing a linkage map involving genetic 
distances between 0.006 and 0.01 cM (0.006cM corresponds to 6 recombinants out of a 
progeny of 100,000 flies; Lewis 1955). Of particular interest here was the pbx mutation 
(postbithorax) that caused the complementary phenotype to bx, transforming the pos­
terior part of T3 into the posterior part of T2. The recovery of recombinants between 
bx and pbx gave rise to the famous four-winged fly in which the whole T3 takes the 
identity of T2 (Lewis 1957)1. This striking phenotype is reminiscent of an atavism, or 
1	 For the sake of simplification, we have omitted to mention that the four-winged flies carry an addi­
tional mutation called anterobithorax (abx), which transforms the dorsal side of T3 into the dorsal side 
of T2. In truth, the flies depicted in the NY Times, in Nature and later on in Science are a triple mutant 
that was assembled by recombination: abx, bx, pbx.

a step back in evolution, transforming a dipteran insect toward a more ancient insect 
with two pairs of wings of equal sizes on T2 and T3 such as the dragon fly. In 1957, 
this breakthrough was discussed in the New York Times edition of November 27th in 
an article entitled “4-wings Flies Bred in Study of Genes: Throwback of Million Years 
May Explain Mechanics of Human Heredity”.
2.1.1  The Model of Ed Lewis
In 1978, Ed Lewis published a landmark paper in Nature, in which he summarized 
nearly 40 years of his work (Lewis 1978). In addition to the existing mutations and new 
alleles affecting the identity of T3 and A1, he described a series of mutations affecting 
the identities of the abdominal segments (the iab mutations for infra-abdominal). All 
these mutations map in the vicinity of the initial bx alleles and he named this chromo­
somal region the Bithorax complex (BX-C). Remarkably enough, genetic mapping by 
meiotic recombination revealed that the mutations are ordered along the chromosome 
in the same order as the segments they affect along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of 
the fly. This astonishing correspondence between body axis and genomic organiza­
tion, often referred to as collinearity, was later found to be evolutionarily conserved in 
similar homeotic clusters in many organisms with bilaterial symmetry (Akam 1989; 
Duboule and Dolle 1989; Graham, Papalopulu, and Krumlauf 1989; McGinnis and 
Krumlauf 1992; Ruddle et al. 1994; Garcia-Fernandez 2005).
Because of their weird behavior in complementation studies, Ed Lewis did not 
think that the mutations affecting the segment identities were defining simple genes. 
Instead, he used the term “segment-specific-function”. In his seminal 1978 paper, 
Lewis also described a deficiency removing the entire BX-C that causes embryonic 
lethality. It is, however, possible to recognize the identities of the segments in these 
dead embryos and he found that all the segments posterior to T2 develop like a 
copy of T2. Lewis proposed that T2 represents a ground state of development (like 
a default state) and that the segment-specific functions of the BX-C allow posterior 
segments to differentiate away from that ground state. The observation that muta­
tions in individual segment-specific functions always cause homeotic transforma­
tion toward the immediately adjacent anterior segment and not into T2 implies that 
everything required for the development of that more anterior segment was also 
active in the more posterior segments. In this view, Ed Lewis proposed that the seg­
ment-specific functions of the BX-C were acting in an additive fashion and that the 
more posterior a segment is, the more segment-specific functions are active within 
it. A corollary to this assumption implies that the more posterior a segment is along 
the AP, the more it is differentiated away from the T2 ground state. Because of the 
correspondence between genomic organization of the segment-specific-functions 
and body axis, Lewis visualized this additive effect as a sequential activation of the 
segment-specific function along the chromosome (see Figure 2.1).
2.1.2  The Segment-Specific Functions Are Segment-Specific Enhancers
It is worthwhile noting that all the mutations affecting the segment-specific func­
tions are homozygous viable, giving rise to adult flies in which the homeotic phe­
notypes are observable. There were also mutations within the BX-C associated

third instar larva is drawn on the y-axis with the segmental and corresponding parasegmen­
tal boundaries. The thoracic rows of setae belts are represented as horizontal lines. Pairs of 
ventral pits are also drawn on T1, T2 and T3. The progressively wider abdominal setae belts 
are drawn as trapezoids of increasing size. The molecular map of the BX-C is depicted on the 
abscissa. The 320 kb are indicated as a horizontal line, with increments of 10 kb. The Ubx, 
abd-A and Abd-B transcription units are drawn to scale below the genomic line (note the 
short transcription unit for the m form and the larger with its alternate promoters encoding 
the r form). The approximate extent of the regions associated with mutations in the segment-
specific function are indicated by horizontal brackets above the genomic DNA. The matrix 
shows which of the segment-specific functions are active in their respective parasegment/
segment. In segments anterior to PS5, the completely off state of the BX-C is depicted as 
a dark and continuous horizontal line, which symbolizes repression by the Pc-G repressive 
complexes. In PS5 the abx/bx regulatory domain opens, enabling the enhancers residing in it 
to activate Ubx expression in its PS5-specific pattern. In PS6, the bxd/pbx domain opens up 
(note that the abx/bx domain remains open). In PS7, the next domain, iab-2 opens. There is 
a color code in the figure that relates to the promoter the segment-specific domains interact 
with. While the red colors indicate the domains regulating Ubx expression, the blue colors 
indicate the regulatory domains interacting with abd-A. Finally, the green colors indicate 
the domains regulating Abd-B (note that the enhancers regulating the Abd-B r form in PS14 
are not known). The boundaries that delimit the extent of opening of the regulatory domains 
in each parasegment are indicated by red ovals. Boundaries genetically defined by homeo­
tic gain-of-function mutations are indicated by their acronym: Fub = Front- ultrabdomi­
nal (Bender and Lucas 2013); Mcp = Miscadestral pigmentation (Lewis 1978; Karch et al. 
1985, 1994); Fab-6, 7 and 8 = Frontabdominal (Gyurkovics et al. 1990; Barges et al. 2000; 
Iampietro et al. 2010; Postika et al. 2021). The remaining boundaries are positioned on the 
basis of CTCF binding sites and/or positions of enhancer trap line insertional sites.

with much more drastic effects, resulting in embryonic lethality. This is the case of 
the Ubx alleles that transform both T3 and A1 into T2, behaving as if they were 
summing up the phenotypes of mutations in the bx, pbx and bxd segment-specific 
functions altogether. This property was corroborated by the failure of Ubx muta­
tions to complement mutations in trans in either bx, pbx or bxd. These observations 
formed the core of the pseudoallele conundrum; on the one hand, the mutations in 
bx, pbx or bxd segment-specific functions appear to define individual functional 
units, being able to complement each other in trans. On the other hand, mutations 
in either of the three of them were not complemented by Ubx mutations as if they 
were linked within a single functional unit. These genetic interactions that preoc­
cupied Ed Lewis and his contemporaries for many decades became understood 
once the modular organization of metazoan genes with their coding sequences and 
complex cis-regulatory regions was deciphered in the early-eighties. Two concomi­
tant lines of evidence brought enlightenment. First, the group of Gines Morata in 
Madrid and Robert Whittle in Sussex screened for lethal mutations in the BX-C and 
found only three complementation groups (Sanchez-Herrero et  al. 1985; Tiong, 
Bone, and Whittle 1985). One of them corresponded to the Ubx mutations and the 
two others were named abd-A and Abd-B according to the group of abdominal seg­
ments they were affecting (A2–A4 for abd-A, and A5–A8 for Abd-B)2. The second 
line of evidence came from the cloning of the BX-C and the search for the tran­
scription units imbedded within the BX-C. Cloning the BX-C is the textbook exam­
ple of positional cloning, thanks to the development of chromosomal walking by 
Welcome Bender and Pierre Spierer in the laboratory of Dave Hogness at Stanford 
(Bender, Spierer, and Hogness 1983). Within five years of work, the 300 kb of BX-C 
were isolated and more than 60 of the mutations assembled by Ed Lewis were local­
ized by whole genome Southerns on the DNA map (Bender et al. 1983; Karch et al. 
1985; Celniker et al. 1990), leading to the physical demonstration of collinearity 
(see Figure 2.1). Back in those days, a locus covering 300 kb of DNA was unusually 
large, making the search for the coding sequences cumbersome and it took some 
time until a good quality cDNA library became available to recover a first Ubx 
cDNA (Hogness et al. 1985). In the end, however, it appeared that the BX-C con­
tained only three large transcription units that matched perfectly with the regions 
of DNA defined by the DNA lesions associated with the Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B 
phenotypes (O’Connor et al. 1988; Kuziora and McGinnis 1988;  Zavortink and 
Sakonju 1989; Delorenzi and Bienz 1990; Karch, Bender, and Weiffenbach 1990; 
Macias, Casanova, and Morata 1990; Boulet, Lloyd, and Sakonju 1991)3. In 1987, 
2	 Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B mutations are true embryonic recessive lethal mutations. Ubx and Abd-B acro­
nyms are nevertheless written with a capital U or A, respectively, because they are haplo-insufficient 
loci. While Ubx/+ heterozygotes have slightly enlarged halteres, Abd-B/+ heterozygotes have rotated 
genitalia and are usually sterile
3	 The identification of the Ubx gene occurred in parallel with the molecular characterization of another 
homeotic gene, Antennapedia (Antp) in the laboratories of T. Kaufman in Bloomington and W. Gehring 
in Basel. Sequence comparisons between the Antp and Ubx clones revealed the conserved motif of 
180bp encoding for 60 aa that was named the homeobox (McGinnis et al. 1984; Scott and Weiner 1984). 
The identification of the homeobox constituted the entry point to identify similar clusters of Hox genes 
in other bilaterian animals and some cnidarians (see McGinnis and Krumlauf 1992; Duboule 2007).

20
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Casanova et al. created a triple mutant chromosome (Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B) and 
found that the homozygotes died as embryos with the same phenotype as the 
embryos homozygous for the whole BX-C deficiency that Ed Lewis described in his 
1978 paper (with T3 to A8 developing like T2, see above) thereby bringing the 
definitive proof that the entire BX-C encodes only three genes (Casanova et al. 
1987). We were then facing another paradox; on the one hand, the genetic data of 
Ed Lewis suggested the existence of nine segment-specific functions, and on the 
other hand, the molecular data indicated the presence of only three genes. The 
answer to this enigma (and to the pseudoallelism conundrum) emerged when anti­
bodies recognizing the Ubx, abd-A or Abd-B proteins gradually became available. 
As anticipated, the expression patterns of these homeotic proteins appeared tightly 
regulated in time and space with very intricate expression patterns (see Figure 2.2). 
It should be noted that the domains of expression of the homeotic proteins do not 
correspond to the morphologically visible body segments, but are shifted by about 
half a segment. In 1985, Martinez-Arias and Lawrence collected data supporting 
the idea that the unit of metamerization of the fly body axis was shifted relative to 
the body segments and proposed the term parasegments (Martinez-Arias and 
Lawrence 1985). The parasegmental origin of metamerization explains why the bx 
and other bithorax mutations affect the identity of anterior or posterior compart­
ments of segments in adult flies. It turned out that the mutations in the segment-
specific functions interfere with the activities of the enhancers that determine these 
intricate expression patterns. For example, the Ubx protein appears in parasegment 
5 (PS5) at a relatively low level in a subset of the nuclei of the epidermis and pre­
sumptive central nervous system (CNS; Figure 2.2). In a bx homozygous embryo, 
this PS5-specific Ubx expression is lost, while expression in the more posterior 
parasegments remains normal (Cabrera, Botas, and Garcia-Bellido 1985; White 
and Wilcox 1985; Little, Byrd, and Brower 1990). It turned out that the DNA lesions 
associated with the bx phenotype interfere with the enhancers responsible for that 
PS5-specific expression. In PS6, the Ubx protein appears at a higher level in all 
nuclei of the epidermis (and presumptive CNS; Figure 2.2) under the control of 
enhancers located within the region associated with the pbx and bxd mutations 
(Bender and Lucas 2013). In the case of a deletion removing the pbx and bxd 
enhancers, the PS6-specific Ubx expression is lost. However, following the predic­
tion of Ed Lewis (stating that once a segment-specific function is turned on in a 
given segment, it remains active in the more posterior segments), the PS6-specific 
expression pattern is replaced by the PS5-specific expression pattern in the pbx-bxd 
mutants. One now understands better why Ubx mutations fail to complement in 
trans bx, pbx or bxd mutations. Taking the example of bx/Ubx trans-heterozygotes, 
the bx chromosome does not produce Ubx protein in PS5, but can produce it in PS6 
(and more posterior parasegments). As the Ubx chromosome does not produce any 
Ubx protein, the heterozygotes bx/Ubx gives rise to individuals lacking Ubx only 
in PS5, hence flies associated with the bx phenotype. Figure 2.2 shows abd-A pro­
tein appearing from PS7 under the control of enhancers located in the region asso­
ciated with iab-2 mutations. The iab-2 mutations are one class of the mutations 
affecting the identities of the abdominal segments discussed in the 1978 Ed Lewis 
paper. In iab-2 flies, the second abdominal segment (A2) takes the identity of A1. 

21
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
Embryos mutant for iab-2 lack abd-A in PS7. Careful examination of the abd-A 
expression pattern shows a slight increase in PS8 and PS9. These incremental 
increases are controlled by enhancers present in the iab-3 and iab-4 regions (Karch, 
Bender, and Weiffenbach 1990; Macias, Casanova, and Morata 1990). The third 
homeotic gene of the BX-C, Abd-B, appears in a few nuclei from PS10 and the 
FIGURE 2.2  Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B are expressed in broad domains in embryos. Confocal 
images of embryos at stage 12 of embryogenesis. Embryos were cut along the dorsal mid­
line, flattened and mounted on a microscope slide. Only the epidermis is preserved in these 
preparations with the ventral nervous system that begins to appear at this stage. Top row, note 
the modulation of expression of Ubx (green) in PS5 (low) and in PS6 (high and in almost all 
nuclei), which is the consequence of regulation by the abx/bx and bxd/pbx regulatory domains 
respectively. From PS7, Ubx expression decreases progressively as a consequence of repres­
sion by abd-A (red), resulting in Ubx and abd-A expression patterns that appear complemen­
tary to each other. The parasegmental-specific abd-A expression pattern is more uniform. 
In PS7, where iab-2 regulates abd-A, expression appears to be a bit lower and in fewer cells 
when compared to PS8. The slightly stronger PS8 expression pattern is regulated by iab-3. 
There are a few additional cells from the peripheral nervous system that specifically appear 
in PS9 under the control of iab-4, but these are not visible on these preparations. The bottom 
row shows embryos double-stained for abd-A (red) and Abd-B (green). Abd-B appears from 
PS10 and increases gradually in PS11 and PS12 under the control of iab-5, iab-6 and iab-7, 
respectively. In PS13 almost all nuclei contain higher levels of Abd-B as a consequence of 
iab-8 regulation. In PS14, a truncated form of Abd-B (r) is also recognized by the antibody 
and is expressed from an alternate transcription unit (see text). In the epidermis, the abd-A 
and Abd-B expression patterns also appear complementary to each other (pictures courtesy 
of Mashesh Gummalla)

22
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
number of nuclei as well as the intensity of expression increases incrementally in 
PS11 and PS12 to reach a high level of expression in nearly all nuclei in PS13 and 
PS14. These PS-specific expression patterns are controlled by enhancers located in 
the regions defined by the iab-5, iab-6, iab-7 and iab-8 mutations, respectively 
(Celniker et  al. 1990; Sanchez-Herrero 1991; Mihaly et  al. 2006). In PS14, an 
N-terminal truncated isoform of ABDB is expressed from an alternatively spliced
transcript that initiates from upstream promoters (the so-called r forms; initiated
from promoters B, C or γ shown in Figures 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5; Kuziora and McGinnis
1988; Zavortink and Sakonju 1989; Celniker et al. 1990; Delorenzi and Bienz 1990;
Boulet, Lloyd, and Sakonju 1991).
It appears that Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B are expressed in broad domains, each 
of them forming an anteroposterior gradient in the numbers of expressing cells as 
well as in the intensity of expression within each parasegment (see Figure 2.2). 
This observation is consistent with the rules of the Lewis model, stating that “once 
a segment-specific function is active in a given parasegment, it remains active in 
the more posterior parasegments”. However, posterior to PS6 where the Ubx pro­
tein is present at high levels in nearly all nuclei of the epidermis and presumptive 
CNS, expression gradually decreases by parasegmental increments (Figure 2.2). 
This decrease is not an aberration of the Lewis rule, but instead results from 
the appearance of abd-A in PS7, which represses Ubx expression in trans. In 
the context of an abd-A mutation, the PS6-specific level of Ubx remains high in 
PS7–PS12, indicating that the bxd/pbx enhancers remain active in the more pos­
terior parasegments (complying therefore to the Lewis rule). A similar repressive 
mechanism exists between abd-A and Abd-B, where the latter exerts a repressive 
activity on the former. As a consequence, abd-A is repressed in PS13 and PS14 
where Abd-B is present at high levels, in nearly all nuclei of the epidermis and 
presumptive CNS (Figure 2.2) (Karch, Bender, and Weiffenbach 1990; Macias, 
Casanova, and Morata 1990). It should be noted that Abd-B is also repressing 
Ubx and even the more anterior-acting homeotic gene Antp. The ability of a gene 
affecting the more posterior segments to repress the more anterior gene also 
applies to Ubx being able to repress Antp (Levine et al. 1983; Harding et al. 1985). 
This phenomenon is referred as to the posterior dominance rule. In the second 
half of this chapter, we will learn that the posterior dominance rule suffers from 
a notable exception between abd-A and Abd-B in the CNS (and also in the genital 
disc, Foronda et al. 2006).
In his 1978 paper, Lewis envisioned that the segment-specific functions acted 
in a combinatorial fashion to create a unique code within each segment under the 
control of the BX-C. We have learned that this code is composed of three prod­
ucts whose expression is regulated by the segment-specific functions acting as 
enhancers. The complex cis-regulation that they mediate as well as the negative 
trans-interactions between the different homeotic genes result in extremely intri­
cate patterns of expression both between and within parasegments. Each paraseg­
ment is a unique mosaic of cells expressing different homeotic proteins and the 
compositions of these mosaics end up producing segmental identity (see Peifer 
et al. 1987).

used also in panel C. Panel B shows the spatial distribution of the iab-8 ncRNA transcript at 
three developmental stages. The top embryo is at the cellular blastoderm stage at the onset 
of the early transcripts of the BX-C. There is a strong signal in the region corresponding to 
PS13 and PS14. The middle embryo is at the stage of embryogenesis called elongated germ­
band, where the anterior-posterior axis is extended and folded over within the egg. The iab-8 
ncRNA transcript is present in PS13 and PS14. The bottom embryo is at 12 hours of develop­
ment when the iab-8 ncRNA expression disappears from the epidermis and is restricted to 
the central nervous system (CNS) in PS13 and PS14. Panel C shows the CNS of WT and three 
mutant embryos stained for abd-A in red and engrailed in green to mark the parasegmental 
boundaries. Note the absence of abd-A from PS13 in WT embryos. In the mutant iab-4186, a 
rearrangement break interrupts the iab-8 ncRNA transcription unit upstream from miR iab8, 
giving rise to embryos in which abd-A is completely derepressed in PS13. In embryos homo­
zygous for the small miRiab8 deletion, there is a weak stochastic derepression of abd-A in a 
few neurons in PS13. This suggests the existence of at least two repressive mechanisms medi­
ated by the iab-8 ncRNA (miRiab8 and something else, see text). Finally, a chromosomal 
rearrangement breakpoint interrupts the iab-8 ncRNA transcription unit downstream from 
the position of miR iab8. In this mutant, there is also partial and weak derepression of abd-A 
in PS13, presumably because miRiab8 is still active, but the second repressive mechanism is 
affected. We have compelling evidence that the second repressive mechanism is mediated by 
transcriptional interference (Castro Alvarez et al. 2021).

2.2  SEQUENTIAL OPENING OF SEGMENT-SPECIFIC 
CHROMATIN REGULATORY DOMAINS
2.2.1  Gain-of-Function Homeotic Mutations
The loss-of-function mutations (LOF) in the segment-specific functions transform 
a given segment into the immediately anterior segment (toward the ground state). 
There are also gain-of-function (GOF) mutations that cause the opposite transforma­
tion where a segment takes the identity of the immediately posterior segment (away 
from the ground state). In terms of the Lewis model, GOF mutations behave as if 
a given segment-specific function is activated just one segment ahead of its normal 
realm of action. The molecular lesions associated with these GOF mutations support 
the idea that the segment-specific regulatory regions are organized into chromatin 
domains that open up sequentially along the chromosome upon moving along the 
antero-posterior (AP) axis of the fly (Figure 2.1). This model, dubbed the “open for 
business model”, has been the subject of a review published in 2015 in memory of 
the passing over of Walter Gehring (Maeda and Karch 2015), and we will only men­
tion briefly the observations that led to its elaboration. It was the molecular lesions

the strong fluorescence at the tips of the two lobes of the accessory gland (AG). Panel C shows 
a magnification of the secondary cells located at the tips of the AG in which we detect strong 
fluorescence. Although the GFP reporter gene should be nuclear, there is so much expression 
that the fluorescence leaks out into the cytoplasm. Note the large size of the secondary cells 
and the presence of very large vacuoles devoid of GFP. Panel D confirms the expression of 
Abd-B in the secondary cells by staining with an anti-AbdB antibody. Note that these cells 
are binucleated (as are the main cells of the AG).

ness model for the first time in 1987 (Peifer, Karch, and Bender 1987). Cbx1 flies 
have the posterior part of T2 (pT2) developing like a copy of the posterior part of 
T3 (pT3). In his first ultrafine genetic dissection of the BX-C published in 1955, Ed 
Lewis had found that the Cbx1 chromosome carried two mutations that he managed 
to separate by recombination, enabling him to recover the pbx1 mutation mentioned 
above. Remarkably, the pbx1 phenotype is the exact recessive counterpart of the Cbx1 
phenotype in which pT3 is transformed into pT2. In other words, Cbx1 behaves as

a regulatory mutation, producing the pbx+ function one segment too far anterior. 
Thus, the pbx+ function is not lost in the Cbx1 chromosome. In the first paper to be 
published on the molecular genetics of the BX-C, Welcome Bender discovered that a 
17-kb-long fragment was deleted from the bxd/pbx region on the Cbx1 chromosome 
and translocated to 50 kb upstream, within the second intron of the Ubx transcrip­
tion unit (Bender et al. 1983). In the pbx1mutation alone, the enhancers responsible 
for Ubx expression in the cells giving rise to pT3 (within PS6) are deleted and these 
cells adopt a pT2 identity (back to the ground state). In Cbx1, moving these enhancers 
50 kb to the left results in their activation one segment ahead, in pT2. In essence, the 
enhancers contained within the pbx1 interval provide segmental identity. However, 
the segmental address where these enhancers are activated is provided by their loca­
tion on the chromosome. These findings led Peifer, Karch, and Bender (1987) to 
propose that the sequential activation of the segment-specific enhancers resulted 
from the progressive opening of chromosomal domains along the AP axis. In the 
wild-type context, the pbx enhancers are imbedded within a domain that only opens 
in PS6. By moving these enhancers 50 kb to the left, they fall into the chromo­
somal domain that is opened in PS5 and hence the Cbx1 phenotype. This distinction 
between segmental identity and segment address will come back later in this chapter 
in a section dealing with specific enhancers named initiators.
The idea of segment-specific chromosomal domains implies the existence of 
boundary elements that define to which extent each domain opens in a given para­
segment (see red ovals in Figure 2.1). In this view, deletion of a given boundary 
should result in the extension of the opening to the next available boundary. This 
is exactly what was observed in the Mcp1 mutation where the boundary separating 
iab-4 from iab-5 is deleted. Upon opening of iab-4 in PS9, the lack of a boundary 
leads to the opening of the next adjacent iab-5 domain and to the ectopic activation 
of iab-5 in A4, hence the GOF posterior transformation of A4/PS9 into A5/PS10 
(Karch et al. 1985; Gyurkovics et al. 1990; Karch et al. 1994). Abdominal segments 
are very similar to each other, making it difficult to recognize homeotic transfor­
mation between adjacent segments. Fortunately, sexually dimorphic abdominal pig­
mentation in males provides specific morphological traits that make their posterior 
two segments much more distinct from each other. This is how Mcp and two other 
boundary mutations, Fab-6 and Fab-7, were recognized on the basis of the homeo­
tic phenotypes they induce in males upon their deletion (Gyurkovics et al. 1990; 
Galloni et al. 1993; Mihaly et al. 1997; Iampietro et al. 2010; Postika et al. 2021). 
Two additional boundaries were genetically identified: Fab-8 causes the transforma­
tion of A7 into A8 in females (Barges et al. 2000) and Fub transforms A1 into A2 
(Bender and Lucas 2013; Savitsky et al. 2016). The Fub boundary separates the bxd/
pbx domain that regulates Ubx in PS6 from the iab-2 domain that regulates abd-A 
in PS7. Fub lies at the border between the regulatory domains interacting with Ubx 
and the regulatory domains interacting with abd-A. We will see later in this chapter 
that in 1996 we discovered that a split occurred exactly at that site in the BX-C of 
Drosophila virilis.
While analyzing this particular region of the BX-C, the laboratory of Welcome 
Bender discovered a phenomenon called homing, at the origin of a collection of 
numerous enhancer trap lines that landed within the BX-C (for references regarding 

27
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
the phenomenon of enhancer trap lines, see O’Kane and Gehring 1987). These 
enhancer trap lines provide the most visual evidence of the open for business model 
by “painting” the domains on the chromosome (for details about these enhancer trap 
lines see the original article of Bender and Hudson 2000 and reviews by Maeda and 
Karch 2006, 2015). Boundary elements such as those present in Fub, Mcp, Fab-6, 
Fab-7 and Fab-8 are also referred to as insulators and were identified and analyzed at 
other chromosomal locations in Drosophila as well as in chicken, mice and humans 
(where they have been looked at). Interestingly, most of these insulators contain 
binding sites for the conserved protein CTCF (for reviews see; Schwartz et al. 2012; 
Ozdemir and Gambetta 2019). In 2007, the laboratory of Robert White published 
a genome-wide map of sites associated with CTCF and discovered that they were 
decorating the BX-C at locations coinciding with the extents of the domains mapped 
by the mutations and/or the enhancer trap lines, giving rise to the map shown in 
Figure 2.1 (Holohan et al. 2007). More recently an outstanding joint effort from the 
laboratories of Welcome Bender and Robert Kingston brought the molecular proof 
of the open for business model by demonstrating the stepwise removal from the 
chromatin of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and its replacement by the H3K27Ac 
mark. Remarkably, the extent of each removal coincides with the sites occupied 
constitutively by CTCF. Furthermore, in agreement with the Lewis model, once a 
domain is opened, it remains associated with H3K27Ac in the posterior paraseg­
ments (Bowman et al. 2014).
2.2.2  Initiation and Maintenance Phases
Before delving further into the regulatory elements that have been identified in the 
BX-C, it is important to understand the two phases of development that characterize 
the early steps of Drosophila embryogenesis, initiation and maintenance. Keeping 
these two phases in mind will also help in understanding features discussed toward 
the end of this chapter in the evolutionary section. Extensive genetic and molecular 
analyses have shown that the determination of the AP axis in Drosophila is under 
the control of three classes of transcription factors that are deployed in a cascade. 
These transcription factors are encoded by the maternal, gap and pair-rule genes, 
which after only 3.5 hours of development have already subdivided the embryo into 
14 parasegments (at this stage embryos are still a syncytium referred to as the syncy­
tial blastoderm; for references, see Ingham, 1988; Hoch and Jackle, 1993; Kornberg 
and Tabata, 1993; DiNardo et al. 1994). We will see in the next section that these 
transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to elements within the regu­
latory domains of the BX-C to establish the ultimate expression pattern of Ubx, 
abd-A or Abd-B and determine segmental identity. Gap and pair-rule genes are only 
transiently expressed during early embryogenesis, and the activity state of the BX-C 
regulatory domains is fixed for the life of the fly. This implies a system to main­
tain homeotic gene expression throughout development (Struhl and Akam 1985). 
The maintenance system is encoded by two classes of genes named Polycomb-
group genes (Pc-G; Duncan 1982; Jürgens 1985) and trithorax-group genes (trx-G; 
Ingham 1981; Kennison and Tamkun 1988; Shearn 1989). Both classes of proteins 
assemble into complexes that associate with the chromatin at their target loci. The 

28
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Pc-G complexes function as negative regulators, maintaining the inactive state of 
the regulatory domains in segments where they have not been activated during early 
embryogenesis by the gap and pair-rule gene products. The Pc-G complexes bring 
the H3K27me3 modification associated with inactive chromatin (Ng et al. 2000; 
Tie et al. 2001; Czermin et al. 2002; Muller et al. 2002). In contrast, trx-G com­
plexes function in the maintenance of activity of the regulatory domains of the 
BX-C throughout the life cycle of the fly. They have been identified through genetic 
screens for mutations that can suppress the dominant phenotypes associated with 
Pc-G mutations (for review see Simon and Tamkun 2002). The trx-G complex brings 
the H3K27Ac involved in the active status of chromatin (Tie et al. 2014). Because of 
these distinctions between the two phases of BX-C regulation we will see that the 
DNA elements with which the gap and pair-rule gene products associate are called 
“initiators” and the DNA elements with which the Pc-G and trx-G protein complexes 
associate have been named maintenance elements (ME) also known as Pc-G or trx-G 
response elements (PREs/TREs).
2.2.3  Initiators, Cell Type-Specific and Maintenance Elements
Once the enhancer nature of the segment-specific functions was apparent, several 
laboratories undertook to dissect the regulatory domains using classical lacZ reporter 
gene constructs and P-element mediated transgenesis. While these studies led to the 
identification of numerous regulatory elements, it is important to emphasize that 
none of these individual enhancers was able to direct an expression pattern to the 
lacZ reporter gene that resembled the endogenous Ubx, abd-A or Abd-B expression 
patterns. Given the large size of the regulatory domains, these observations are not 
surprising and suggest that numerous enhancers act in a combinatorial fashion, lead­
ing to a working model for the control of gene regulation in the BX-C. The founda­
tions of the model are enhancers that confer cell type and/or tissue specificity of 
expression to the lacZ reporter gene without any restriction along the AP axis of the 
embryos (Simon et al. 1990; Busturia and Bienz 1993; Pirrotta et al. 1995; Barges 
et al. 2000; Mihaly et al. 2006). It is assumed that within their endogenous location 
in the BX-C, these enhancers become active only from the parasegment in which 
the regulatory domain is open. But outside the BX-C context, these enhancers lack a 
parasegmental address and become active in all the parasegments along the AP axis.
There are then enhancers able to read a parasegmental address. These enhanc­
ers activate the lacZ reporter gene in a restricted fashion along the AP axis of the 
early embryo (Simon et al. 1990; Qian, Capovilla, and Pirrotta 1991; Muller and 
Bienz 1992; Busturia and Bienz 1993; Zhou et al. 1999; Barges et al. 2000; Shimell 
et al. 2000; Mihaly et al. 2006) and are referred to as “initiator” elements. In gen­
eral, the initiator fragments activate the lacZ reporter gene from the appropriate 
parasegment and then this pattern is reiterated posteriorly, generally in a pair-rule 
fashion. For example, an initiator derived from the iab-6 regulatory domain activates 
lacZ expression from PS11, precisely where the endogenous iab-6 domain becomes 
active (and then in PS13; Mihaly et al. 2006). However, very often this ability to 
read a parasegmental address is transient, and at later stages of embryogenesis, the 
reporter gene expression becomes unrestricted along the AP axis or can vanish. This 

29
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
degeneration of the initial pattern is likely due to the loss of positional informa­
tion that is provided in the early embryo by the gap and pair-rule gene products. In 
agreement with this, a few initiator elements have been shown to depend directly 
on the binding sites for maternal, gap and pair-rule products (Qian, Capovilla, and 
Pirrotta 1991; Zhang et al. 1991; Shimell et al. 2000; Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011). 
Each regulatory domain contains at least one initiator element, but there are domains 
where two initiators were found, like in iab-7 (Mihaly et al. 2006).
In some instances, initiator elements can maintain a proper parasegmental address 
at later stages of development (Busturia and Bienz 1993; Chiang et al. 1995; Shimell 
et al. 2000; Mihaly et al. 2006). In this case, the DNA fragments tested were larger 
and were subsequently shown to contain a ME. Because the ability of maintaining a 
proper boundary of expression along the AP axis is lost in the context of mutations 
in Pc-G genes, these MEs were called polycomb-response-elements (PREs; Muller 
and Bienz 1992; Busturia and Bienz 1993; Simon et al. 1993; Chan, Rastelli, and 
Pirrotta 1994; Chiang et al. 1995; Fritsch et al. 1999). PREs do not have an intrinsic 
parasegmental address and can maintain different parasegmental expression pat­
terns when combined with different initiators (Chiang et al. 1995). It has also been 
shown that the robustness of maintenance throughout development increases when 
two PREs are associated with a given initiator (Chiang et al. 1995) and a number of 
observations indicate that each regulatory domain contains several PREs that work 
cooperatively across repressed domains to maintain the proper pattern of expression 
of Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B (cooperativity between PREs is thought to strongly con­
tribute to the maintenance of Hox genes in clusters in Drosophila; see Section 2.4 
Evolutionary Considerations).
Based on these reporter gene experiments, it was hypothesized that initiator frag­
ments function like switches, turning on the regulatory domains in the appropriate 
parasegment. The segmental identity is then determined by the cell type-specific 
enhancers residing within the activated domain (concepts of segmental address 
versus segmental identity). Initiators do not only activate nearby cell type-specific 
enhancers, but they also prevent the assembly of Pc-G repressing complexes, thereby 
keeping the domain active. The question then was, how the validity of these conclu­
sions could be demonstrated at a time when genome-editing techniques were not as 
advanced as they are today?
At the beginning of the 2000s, the emergence of two technologies opened up the 
path toward the possibility of performing genome editing in flies with efficiency. 
First, it became possible to do homologous recombination, though the technique 
was a bit cumbersome and slow (Rong and Golic 2000). Then the bacteriophage 
φC31-based site-specific recombination technique opened up the possibility of inte­
grating larges pieces of DNA into the Drosophila genome (Groth et al. 2004; Bischof 
et al. 2007). By combining these methods, work from our lab was able to create a 
system allowing the rapid manipulation of whole domains in the BX-C. First, using 
the ends-out homologous recombination technique of Gong and Golic (2003), we 
created a precise deletion of the 19-kb-long iab-6 domain and replaced it with an 
attP recombination site for the φC31 integrase. The choice of iab-6 was motivated 
by the knowledge of the positions of its initiator and various other cell-type-specific 
enhancers and PREs (Mihaly et al. 2006). More importantly, however, we also knew 

30
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
that iab-6 mutations would cause an easy to score homeotic phenotype in males in 
both LOF and GOF conditions while not interfering with male and female fertility 
(unlike iab-5, iab-7 or iab-8 mutations do; Iampietro et al. 2010). With this integra­
tion platform in hand, we showed that a number of large deletions removing cell-
type-specific enhancers showed partial transformations of PS11/A6 toward PS10/A5. 
But more importantly, we showed that a precise deletion of only the 927 bp iab-6 
initiator fragment caused a phenotype similar to the deletion of the whole iab-6 
domain. Thus, the 927-bp-long fragment that we named the IAB6 initiator is neces­
sary for the activity of the whole iab-6 domain but is not sufficient for iab-6 activity 
as the deletion of cell-type specific enhancers (without affecting the initiator) also 
show transformation of PS11/A6 identity towards PS10/A5.
But does the initiator function only as a switch to open the iab-6 domain, or 
does it also contain patterning elements necessary for A6 identity? To answer this 
question, we decided to perform an initiator swap experiment, where the 927 bp 
IAB6 initiator was deleted and replaced with the 1-kb-long IAB5 initiator identified 
by Busturia et al. (1993). In an ectopic context, the IAB5 initiator activates a lacZ 
reporter gene in a pair-rule fashion from PS10. If initiators function as only switches 
to open up domains, we anticipated that the activation of the iab-6 enhancers in 
PS10/A5 by the IAB5 initiator would lead to the GOF homeotic transformation of 
PS10/A5 into PS11/A6. This is exactly what we observed. Both the PS10-specific 
Abd-B expression pattern was replaced by the PS11-specific expression pattern and 
the adult cuticle showed a complete transformation of A5 into A6. The initiator swap 
experiment proved that initiators provide only positional information. The segmental 
identity, however, requires the presence of the cell type-specific enhancers residing 
within the domain (Iampietro et al. 2010; Maeda and Karch 2011).
2.2.4  Early and Transient ncRNA
How then do the initiator elements communicate with the neighboring cell type-
specific enhancers and MEs that are scattered throughout the iab-6 cis-regulatory 
domain? It has been known for more than 30 years that the regulatory domains of 
the BX-C are transcribed transiently during early embryogenesis (Lipshitz, Peattie, 
and Hogness 1987; Cumberledge, Zaratzian, and Sakonju 1990). In 1989, using 
large genomic probes spanning from iab-2 through iab-8 on tissue sections from 
early embryos, Sanchez-Herrero and Akam (1989) identified transcribed domains. 
Interestingly, the anterior limits of expression of these transcripts were colinear with 
the arrangement of the probes along the chromosome. For nearly 10 years, the exis­
tence of these transcripts was thought to be a by-product of domain accessibility, 
with cryptic promoters in the large regulatory regions firing in the domains free of 
Polycomb silencing. However, following the emergence of high-throughput sequenc­
ing techniques, intergenic transcription appeared as a frequent feature of eukaryotic 
genomes, sometimes performing important and diverse cellular functions. This led 
to a renewed interest in these non-coding RNAs. The detailed expression patterns of 
many of the BX-C intergenic transcripts in the abdominal region of the BX-C were 
determined by Drewell et al. (Bae et al. 2002; Drewell et al. 2002). In 2013, Pease, 
Borges and Bender performed a similar study for the left half of the BX-C, covering 

31
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
the entire Ubx transcription unit as well as the bxd/pbx regulatory domain (see also 
Petruk et al. 2006). Most of these intergenic transcripts appear very early, in stage 5 
blastoderm embryos. This period corresponds to the initiation phase of BX-C reg­
ulation, when the products of the gap and pair rule genes activate the regulatory 
domains. The spatial distribution of these intergenic transcripts reflects the activity 
of the respective cis-regulatory domains from which they emanate. For example, 
probes from the iab-6 regulatory domain show ncRNA transcripts from PS11 to 
PS13, following the rule of the Lewis model stating that once a regulatory domain 
becomes active, it remains active in the more posterior parasegments (see below). 
And finally, at stage 9, roughly an hour and a half later, the majority of these expres­
sion patterns vanish. Another observation suggesting that these early ncRNAs may 
be instrumental in setting up the initial steps of the regulatory domains rests on the 
observation that forcing transcription across PREs of the BX-C can interfere with the 
assembly of a repressing complex, leading to GOF homeotic phenotypes (Bender and 
Fitzgerald 2002; Hogga and Karch 2002; Schmitt, Prestel, and Paro 2005). It is thus 
possible to envision that initiator elements communicate with the rest of the elements 
in a domain by initiating transcription of the domain to interfere with the assembly 
of Pc-G repressing complexes. Work in our lab used strand-specific probes to have 
a closer look at the early ncRNAs generated by the iab-6 domain. Interestingly, 
we discovered that transcription fires bi-directionally from the initiator fragment 
in PS11 and PS12 covering more or less the entire domain. These early transcripts 
do not appear in the iab-6 mutant that carries the small initiator deletion. Although 
there is a perfect correlation between early transcription and activity of iab-6, we 
have not yet succeeded in interrupting the early transcription to see if its loss results 
in an iab-6 loss-of-function phenotype in flies, despite numerous attempts to intro­
duce transcription termination signals. Thus, we still cannot conclude if they are 
required to set up and maintain iab-6 function (Sandrine Galetti, Annick Mutero, 
Fabienne Cléard, Robert Maeda and François Karch, in preparation).
Two interesting studies performed on the bxd/pbx regulatory domain seem to 
indicate that these early transcripts do not play a role in setting up and/or maintain­
ing its activity and may simply be a simple side effect of domain activation (Petruk 
et  al. 2006; Pease, Borges and Bender 2013). The bxd/pbx regulatory domain is 
responsible for Ubx expression in PS6. As mentioned above, the first ncRNA tran­
scribed from a regulatory domain of the BX-C actually emanates from this bxd/pbx 
regulatory domain (Lipshitz, Peattie, and Hogness 1987). Like the other ncRNAs 
associated with BX-C regulatory domains, the bxd ncRNA is transcribed transiently 
during early stages of embryogenesis in the parasegments in which the bxd/pbx 
domain is active from PS6 to PS12. In 2006, Petruk et al. demonstrated that the pbx1 
deletion discussed above (and pbx2) removes the promoter and most of the template 
sequences encoding the bxd ncRNA. In agreement with this observation, the bxd 
ncRNA is absent in embyros homozygous for these two deficiencies. While pbx1 
and pbx2 deletions have no detectable effects on the spatio-temporal distribution of 
the Ubx protein throughout embyogenesis, Petruk et al. (2006) discovered that the 
onset of Ubx transcription was disturbed in embryos lacking the bxd ncRNA. In WT 
embryos, the first elements of Ubx transcription are visible in PS6 and then addi­
tional domains appear progressively in PS7, PS8 and PS9. In embyros lacking the 

32
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
bxd ncRNA, the lag between PS6 appearance and the posterior domains is greatly 
shortened. As the bxd/pbx transcription unit is located upstream from the Ubx pro­
moter and in the same polarity, the authors suggested that its transcription interferes 
with Ubx expression by transcriptional interference. The short period of activity of 
the early bxd/pbx transcription unit explains why this repression is transient, delay­
ing thereby the appearance of the Ubx transcripts in PS7, 8 and 9. It should be noted 
that this early and transient derepression of Ubx transcription in PS7, 8 and 9 cannot 
account for the pbx phenotype, which results from a loss of Ubx expression in the 
posterior part of T3 in the adult fly.
Another study by Pease, Borges and Bender (2013) has investigated whether the 
bxd/pbx transcription unit is involved in activation and/or maintenance of the bxd/
pbx regulatory domain. Of particular interest was the presence of the bxd PRE in 
the middle of the bxd/pbx transcription unit that offers the possibility of testing if 
transcription across MEs is required to prevent the assembly of a Polycomb repres­
sive complex. To test this hypothesis while interfering as little as possible with the 
organization of the bxd/pbx domain, the authors simply reversed the orientation of 
the promoter within the domain. In this new context, the promoter fires correctly 
during early embryogenesis, but the transcript travels in the opposite direction, 
away from the bxd PRE and Ubx promoter. Without transcriptional interference, the 
Ubx promoter fires concomitantly in PS6, 7, 8 and 9. But other than this transient 
effect, Pease, Borges and Bender (2013) do not observe any apparent gain- or loss-
of-­function phenotypes. In their article, the authors find a strong correlation between 
the sites of initiation of transcription of the early ncRNAs of the BX-C and regions 
bound by products of the gap and pair-rule genes (like in our study of the iab-6 ini­
tiator). Given the very high concentration of these gap and pair-rule gene products 
during the initiation phase in the syncytial blastoderm embryo, the authors favor the 
idea that the early ncRNAs are side effects of domain activation, firing from cryptic 
promoters in the proximity of strong enhancers.
2.3  ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF REGULATION
2.3.1  The iab-8 ncRNA “Gene”
Among the various ncRNAs generated by the Hox clusters are two microRNAs 
referred as to miR-10 located within the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) and 
­miR-iab-4 (miR-196) located within the BX-C. Remarkably, both microRNAs are 
located in homologous positions in Hox clusters in flies and vertebrates (Aravin et al. 
2003; Yekta, Tabin, and Bartel 2008). Initially, miR-iab-4 was found to match to 
the 3'end of a cDNA derived from the iab-4 region discovered by (Cumberledge, 
Zaratzian, and Sakonju 1990), hence its name. Detailed characterization by Bender 
(2008) showed that it is actually located in the iab-3 domain, but for the sake of sim­
plification, its name was not changed. In agreement with its location within a domain 
that is open from PS8/A3, miR-iab-4 is expressed from PS8 through PS12.
Like other microRNAs, miR-iab-4 is transcribed from both strands (Stark 
et al. 2008; Tyler et al. 2008). The transcript that gives rise to the complementary 
microRNA is very large (92 kb-long), with its promoter mapping within the iab-8 

33
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
regulatory domain, just downstream from the Abd-B transcription unit and its 3′ 
terminal exon is located just upstream from the abd-A promoter (Bender 2008; 
Graveley et al. 2011; Gummalla et al. 2012; see Figure 2.3). In accordance with 
its promoter position within the iab-8 regulatory domain, the transcript is synthe­
sized in PS13 and PS14 (Figure 2.3) and was accordingly named the iab-8 ncRNA4. 
The transcript is composed of eight exons that are spliced together. Exons 1–7 
appear evenly spaced, with one exon derived from each iab domain (Figure 2.3). 
Comparisons with other Drosophila species revealed that these structural features 
are conserved. However, the exon sequences do not show more conservation than 
the intron sequences. Only the exon/intron splice sites seem to be conserved, as 
if it is the act of splicing that is important for the function of the transcript (or the 
timing of completion; Gummalla et  al. 2012). The complement of the miR-iab4 
microRNA, miR-iab-8, is encoded within the fifth intron of the transcription unit. 
Like for the microRNAs of the mammalian Hox clusters, Hox genes appear to be 
the primary targets regulated by miR-iab-4 and miR-iab-8. While the Ubx 3’ UTR 
sequence matches better with miR-iab-4, its abd-A counterpart is a better target for 
miR-iab-8 (Ronshaugen et al. 2005; Bender 2008; Stark et al. 2008; Tyler et al. 2008; 
Gummalla et al. 2012; Garaulet et al. 2014, 2020; Garaulet and Lai 2015). Garaulet 
et al. (2014, 2015, 2020) have also identified the Hox co-factors extradenticle (exd) 
and homothorax (hth) as strong miR-iab-8 targets.
Transcription of the iab-8 ncRNAs begins in the epidermis of the blastoderm 
embryo (Figure 2.3). By about 10 hours of development, when the CNS becomes 
visible, the transcripts decay and disappear from the epidermis. However, the tran­
scripts remain at a constant level in the CNS throughout the life of the fly (Bender 
2008; Gummalla et al. 2012, 2014; Figure 2.3). In 2008, Welcome Bender described 
a precise deletion of miR iab-4/iab-8 in the BX-C (Bender 2008). The phenotype 
of this mutant was male and female sterility. The sterility phenotype was shown to 
be neuromuscular in nature: males were unable to bend their abdomen enough to 
properly mate with the females and females were unable to lay eggs, which got stuck 
in the oviduct. By using this deletion in trans to numerous iab rearrangement breaks 
that prevent the formation of either the iab-4 or iab-8 transcripts, Bender was able 
to show that it was the lack of miR-iab-8 that was linked to the sterility phenotype 
in both sexes (Bender 2008; for review see Gummalla et al. 2014). The association 
of miR-iab-8 mutations with reproductive behavior is not surprising since copulation 
is regulated by neurons in both the central brain and the most posterior region of 
the ventral nerve cord (Hall 1979; Ferveur and Greenspan 1998). More recently, the 
laboratory of Eric Lai elegantly showed that females lacking miR-iab-8 are unable 
to convert from the virgin state behavior into a subjective post-mating behavioral 
state (Garaulet et al. 2020). Remarkably, they demonstrate unambiguously that the 
4	 In the first paper describing this transcript, Bender (2008) named it “iab8 RNA”.  In 2012, Gummalla 
et al used the term “iab8 ncRNA” (see also Gummalla et al. 2014). In more recent studies, Immarigeon 
et al. (2021) discovered that the iab8 RNA transcript contained a 63 nucleotide-long open-reading-
frame in its last exon. While this ORF does not seem to be translated from the iab8 RNA template, it is 
translated into 21 and 9 amino acids long peptides in the secondary cells of the male accessory gland 
from a truncated transcript initiating at an alternate promoter.

34
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
problem in switching mated state behavior is associated with a failure to properly 
repress homothorax (hth), a target of miR-iab-8, in specific neurons within PS13 
(Garaulet et al. 2020). With regards to miR-iab-4, the laboratory of Claudio Alonso 
has shown that its absence is also associated with a behavioral phenotype in which 
larvae have difficulties in returning to their normal orientation after they have been 
turned upside down (the so-called self-righting behavior). In this case, the phenotype 
results from a failure to properly down-regulate Ubx in the ventral nerve chord in 
more anterior parasegments where miR-iab4 is expressed (Picao-Osorio et al. 2015).
2.3.2  abd-A Regulation by the iab-8 ncRNA
During the course of our studies on the Fab-8 boundary, we isolated a relatively 
large boundary deletion (Fab-864) that happened to also remove the promoter of 
the iab-8 ncRNA (Barges et al. 2000). Staining this mutant for abd-A and Abd-B, 
we came across the unexpected observation that abd-A is expressed in the CNS in 
PS13 where high levels of Abd-B protein is present. This observation came as a big 
surprise because of the phenomenon of posterior dominance (see above) and our 
previous report that Abd-B activity was repressing abd-A in PS13 (Karch, Bender, 
and Weiffenbach 1990). While Abd-B does repress abd-A in the epidermis, we failed 
to notice that this is not the case in the CNS where abd-A is in fact repressed by the 
iab-8 ncRNA. In fact, close examination of the neuronal cells in the embryo shows 
that there are a number of cells in PS10–PS12 that express high levels of both ­abd-A 
and Abd-B. The microRNA miR-iab-8, embedded within the fifth intron of the 
­iab-8 ncRNA, is an obvious candidate for the repression of abd-A in PS13. However, 
­abd-A is only stochastically expressed in a few neurons in PS13 in embryos lacking 
the microRNA. This is in contrast to a complete loss of the iab-8 ncRNA transcript 
(through the deletion of its promoter) that shows a complete derepression of abd-A 
in PS13. This indicated that a second repressive mechanism mediated by the iab-8 
ncRNA transcript exists (Figure 2.3). Using internal deficiencies affecting all of the 
different regions of the iab-8 ncRNA template did not uncover the second repressive 
element. We now have compelling evidence that the second repressive mechanism 
does not rely on sequence-specific elements and is mediated by transcriptional inter­
ference of the iab-8 ncRNA over the abd-A promoter (Gummalla et al. 2012, 2014). 
We have recently shown that the CNS specificity of this repressive mechanism is 
achieved through a 3' extension of the iab-8 ncRNA transcript, mediated by the 
neuronal-specific, RNA-binding protein, ELAV (Castro Alvarez et al. 2021).
2.3.3  The Roles of Abd-B and miR-iab-8 in Male Reproductive Success
As it is difficult to perform antibody staining, in situ hybridization or classical histo­
chemistry during the larval and pupal stages, the only available readouts of the BX-C 
activity we had for decades were the embryonic expression patterns or the cuticular 
phenotypes of mutant larvae and adult flies. As mentioned above, the emergence 
in the early 2000s of the ΦC31 site-specific integration system in flies opened up 
the possibility of integrating large pieces of DNA into the Drosophila genome. In 
order to discover new tissues and developmental processes in which the Abd-B gene 

35
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
functions, we decided to create a transgenic reporter gene that accurately reproduced 
the Abd-B expression pattern (Gligorov et al. 2013). Abd-B is expressed as two iso­
forms called m and r. The m form results from the short transcription unit referred 
to as “A” in Figure 2.1, which is expressed from PS10 to PS13 under the control of 
the iab-5, iab-6, iab-7 and iab-8 regulatory domains respectively (m stands for mor­
phogenic, reflecting the segment identity function). The r form is transcribed only in 
PS14 from alternative upstream promoters named B, C and γ in Figure 2.1 (r stands 
for regulatory function; Casanova, Sanchez-Herrero, and Morata 1986; Zavortink 
and Sakonju 1989; Celniker et al. 1990; Boulet, Lloyd, and Sakonju 1991). As the 
r form is expressed only in a single parasegment, we decided to concentrate on the 
m form and its well-characterized 3' regulatory domains (iab-5 through iab-8). By 
recombineering, we assembled a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) spanning 
a genomic region from iab-4 to a region upstream from the Abd-BA promoter that 
did not include the B, C and γ promoters (unfortunately, at the time we designed the 
BAC, we were not aware of the existence of miR-iab8 and of the iab8 ncRNA; Figure 
2.4). The integration of this 102-kb-long BAC within an integration platform on the 
second chromosome can rescue a number of mutations affecting the iab-5 through 
iab8 domains. Thus, we concluded that the BAC carried enough sequences to reca­
pitulate a normal expression pattern of the Abd-Bm form. We then created a reporter 
by inserting the sequence coding for the yeast Gal4 activator in place of the first 
codon of the Abd-B open-reading-frame and integrated the resulting Abd-B-Gal4 
BAC into the genome. After establishing lines containing the Abd-B-Gal4 BAC 
and a UAS-GFP transgene on the same chromosome, we were able to study Abd-B 
expression live by following the fluorescence. The system appears to recapitulate 
most of the wild-type embryonic Abd-B expression pattern, even though we could 
detect slight ectopic expression in the ventral nerve chord which likely results in part 
from an amplification effect due to the strength of the Gal4 transcription factor and 
the perdurance of the GFP protein (Gligorov et al. 2013).
2.3.4  Abd-B Expression in the Secondary Cells 
of the Male Accessory Gland
When we first observed flies carrying the Abd-B-Gal4 BAC + a UAS-GFP chromo­
some under a fluorescent microscope, we were struck by the appearance of males 
with extremely bright abdomens (Gligorov et al. 2013). This intense fluorescence 
came from a group of about 80 very large cells present at the tips of the male acces­
sory glands (AG), which are known as secondary cells (Figure 2.4). In Drosophila, 
the male AG is analogous to the mammalian seminal vesicle and prostate. The AG 
has two lobes, each mostly composed of a monolayer of hexagonally shaped main 
cells with about 40 round, secondary cells scattered around the distal tip. AGs are 
the site of synthesis of numerous accessory-gland-specific proteins (Acps; more 
than 100 have been identified) that elicit several post-mating behaviors in females. 
In brief, these behaviors range from increasing egg production, ovulation and ovi­
position, regulating sperm utilization and storage and reducing female remating. 
The best characterized Acp, the sex peptide (SP) is known to coat the sperm and is 
slowly released in the female from the sperm storage organs to elicit the post-mating 

36
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
response (PMR) (for reviews see Kubli 2003; Wolfner 2009). Absence of SP from 
the seminal fluid results in reduced oocyte production and in a decrease in female 
rejection of mating attempts by subsequent males.
Having confirmed that Abd-B was indeed expressed in the secondary cells of 
the AGs by antibody staining (Figure 2.4), we embarked on the identification of the 
enhancer responsible for Abd-B expression in these cells with the knowledge that it 
would be uncovered by one (or only a few) of the overlapping deficiencies affecting 
the iab-5 through iab-8 domains (Mihaly et al. 2006). But what could be the conse­
quence of the loss of Abd-B in the secondary cells? Given the homeotic function of 
Abd-B, the first hypothesis that came to mind was a transformation toward a main 
cell fate, resulting in the loss of secondary cells. However, Abd-B could also play a 
role in the differentiation process that leads to the acquisition of the secondary cell 
fate. If this second hypothesis is true, a loss of Abd-B would affect the composition 
of the secondary cells, but would not lead to their loss. To distinguish between these 
two possibilities and to localize the secondary cell-specific enhancer, we generated 
mutant males carrying various deletions affecting the iab-5 to iab-8 domains in the 
presence of the Abd-B-Gal4 BAC and UAS-GFP chromosomes to specifically mark 
the secondary cells. In a set of deficiencies overlapping the iab-6 domain, we found 
AGs in which fluorescence is still detected but in which the secondary cells lost their 
characteristic large intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles (Gligorov et al. 2013; Prince et al. 
2019). This observation confirms the second hypothesis, and we conclude that ­Abd-B 
is involved in the morphological differentiation of the secondary cells and does not 
function as a switch transforming main cells into secondary cells. Thanks to the 
­iab-6 integration platform described above, we were able to localize the enhancer to 
a 1 kb interval within the iab-6 domain (Gligorov et al. 2013).
Previously, we reviewed how the activity of the iab-6 regulatory domain was 
dependent on the IAB6 initiator (see above). Surprisingly, the secondary cells of 
males homozygous for the IAB6 initiator deletion are normally differentiated despite 
the fact that their A6 is completely transformed into A5. From this result, we con­
clude that Abd-B expression in these cells of mesoderm origin does not follow the 
initiator paradigm developed for the segment identity function. It is worthwhile not­
ing that the Ubx gene had been found to be differentially regulated in two germ 
layers (Bienz et al. 1988). These results indicate the existence of different layers of 
regulatory organization of the BX-C: while the organization of the regulatory land­
scape into segment-specific regulatory domains appears to work in the epidermis 
and nervous system, the system appears less hierarchical, with cell type-specific 
enhancers working autonomously in the mesoderm. Using our mutation, we were 
able to demonstrate that the secondary cells are essential for the maintenance of 
the female’s post-mating changes in egg laying, receptivity, sperm competition and 
sperm storage. Similar results had been obtained concomitantly by (Minami et al. 
2012) from their studies of dve mutations. With the discovery of the secondary cell 
phenotype and the increased receptivity to additional courting males, we have named 
this particular allele iab-6cocu. In addition to being binucleated (like the main cells), 
secondary cells are filled with large vacuole-like structures. In more recent studies, 
we have determined the assortment of Rab proteins expressed in the secondary cells 
and their regulation relative to Abd-B function. We find that secondary cells are the 

37
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
site of intense trafficking, exchanging and recycling with their neighboring main 
cells as well as secreting substances into the lumen (Prince et al. 2019).
2.3.5  Msa, a Male-Specific Variant of the iab-8 ncRNA Plays a Critical 
Role in Accessory Gland Development and Male Fertility
To follow expression of the iab-8 ncRNA during developmental stages that are less 
accessible by fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) methods, we inserted an expres­
sion cassette encoding mCherry within the third exon of the lncRNA (Figure 2.5; 
again thanks to our ∆iab-6 integration platform). To our surprise and disappoint­
ment, we failed to detect any fluorescence in the embryonic CNS in PS13 and PS14 
(and even at later stages). From the first large-scale RNAseq study to be published in 
flies (Graveley et al. 2011) as well as from our own work (Gummalla et al. 2012) we 
were aware of the existence of a male-specific transcript (male-specific abdominal, 
msa) that is a splice variant of the iab-8 ncRNA, initiating from a promoter located 
within iab-6 (Figure 2.5). Interestingly, the msa promoter initiates upstream from 
exon 3 of the iab-8 ncRNA, with this exon 3 of iab-8 ncRNA then becoming the 
second exon of msa (Figure 2.2). This prompted us to investigate whether we could 
detect any mCherry expression in males. To our delight, we observed expression in 
the secondary cells of the male AG (Figure 2.5).
According to our mCherry expression data, the secondary cells of the AG are the 
only site of expression of msa in the male reproductive tract. Given the structure of 
the msa transcription unit, the secondary cells should also express miR iab-8. Using 
a GFP sensor line designed to respond to inhibition by miRiab-8 (Garaulet et al. 
2014) we confirmed miRiab-8 expression in the secondary cells (Maeda et al. 2018). 
Interestingly, the msa promoter lies within the fragment that is deleted in the iab-
6cocu mutant, raising the possibility that the phenotype associated with the mutations 
results from the loss of both Abd-B and miRiab-8 and not from Abd-B alone as we 
had previously concluded (Gligorov et al. 2013; see above). Once more, by drawing 
on the extensive fly line collections of Ed Lewis and Ian Duncan, we were able to 
generate individuals impaired either for miRiab-8 or Abd-B alone in the secondary 
cells and learned that the loss of either of them alone has consequences on the cytol­
ogy of the secondary cells, which harbor much smaller and more numerous vacuoles. 
Thus, the complete loss of vacuoles that we previously reported in iab-6cocu mutant 
males is due to a synergistic effect of losing both miRiab-8 and Abd-B. In collabora­
tion with the laboratory of Marian Wolfner at Cornell University in Ithaca, we found 
that males impaired for miRiab-8 in the secondary cells alone are unable to elicit a 
PMR in the females they fertilize (Maeda et al. 2018).
2.3.6  Small ORFs and Micro-Peptides in the iab-8/msa RNAs
We previously reported the presence of a putative 9 amino acid-long peptide with 
appropriate initiation and termination signals encoded by exon 8 of the iab-8 ncRNA 
(or exon 7 of msa, see Figure 2.5). This peptide sequence is well conserved in 17 
Drosophila species including D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura and D. willistoni, but 
absent in D. virilis and more distantly related species (Gummalla et al. 2012). Some 

38
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
species lacking the ATG of this 9-amino acid peptide harbor an alternative ATG, 33 
nucleotides upstream that is also present in D. melanogaster, raising the possibility 
of the existence of an alternative conserved peptide of 20 amino acids. During the 
course of our studies of the iab-8 ncRNA, we have created an integration platform 
that allow us to replace sequences including the entire exon 8 of the iab-8 ncRNA. 
With this tool, we created a number of in situ GFP fusions to demonstrate that the 
micro-peptide is translated from the msa RNA template in the secondary cells of 
the AG (but not from the iab-8 ncRNA in the CNS, see below). We have named this 
micro-peptide MSAmiP (Immarigeon et al. 2021). We then created a small deletion 
within exon 8 to delete the ORFs encoding MSAmiP and tested for a phenotype in 
the PMR. We found no differences in egg production, ovulation and ovodeposition. 
There were also no differences in receptivity and four days after the first mating 
with males deficient for MSAmiP, females were as recalcitrant to a second mat­
ing as if they had mated first with a WT male. We then tested to see if the males 
mutant in MSAmiP also resumed the sperm-competition phenotype that we had pre­
viously observed for iab-6cocu males. Generally, if a Drosophila female mates with 
two males, the second male will sire most of the progeny because the first male’s 
sperm are displaced by those of the second male (Parker 1970). Interestingly, we 
found that the sperm issued by MSAmiP-deficient males were much more resistant 
to displacement by a second mating. This seems counterintuitive, as one might think 
that the relative competition success of males lacking MSAmiP might have led to the 
loss of the peptide coding sequence during evolution. However, this is not the first 
occurrence of a sperm competition phenotype in mutations in seminal protein genes. 
Perhaps, the sperm issued from MSAmiP-deficient males is more sticky, thereby 
being more resistant to displacement by sperm from a second male. This stickiness, 
however, may slow down sperm release in normal conditions, a problem that might 
be deleterious for fertility in the long run (Avila et al. 2010).
It is worthwhile noting that the knocked-in MSAmiP-GFP sequence in exon 
8 is not translated in the CNS from the iab-8 ncRNA template. This observation 
is reminiscent of that made upon the insertion of the mCherry-encoding cassette 
within exon 3 of the iab-8 ncRNA. We now believe that exons 1 and 2 of the iab-8 
ncRNA exert a negative effect on the translation of downstream ORFs (Frei et al, in 
preparation). Whether this activity is instrumental in preventing the translation of 
the MSAmiP in the CNS remains to be determined.
2.4  EVOLUTIONARY CONSIDERATIONS
The correspondence between the genomic organization of the Hox gene complexes 
and the anteroposterior axis of the embryo in which they act (collinearity) and its 
conservation through evolution of most Bilateria is regularly mentioned in all recent 
textbooks of developmental biology. It is therefore ironic to think that in Drosophila, 
where collinearity was first discovered by Ed Lewis, is an organism that deviates 
significantly from the observations and rules deduced for the rest of the bilaterians. 
A first deviation lies in the nature of the elements that are orderly arranged along the 
chromosome. In general, collinearity refers to the orderly arrangement of the tran­
scriptional units encoding the Hox proteins. In the BX-C, this rule is respected with 

39
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
the order of Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B genes. However, Ed Lewis discovered collinear­
ity when he observed that the mutations affecting the segment-specific functions 
were arranged along the chromosome in the same order as the segments they were 
affecting. We have seen above that these mutations affect the enhancers regulating 
Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B. In other words, collinearity is represented in two layers 
within the chromatin of the BX-C; first at the level of the orderly arranged transcrip­
tion units, and second, at the level of the orderly arranged regulatory domains con­
trolling these transcription units. In D. melanogaster, very few homeotic mutations 
were identified within the ANT-C. Perhaps this scarcity of mutations reflects the fact 
that the ANT-C specifies head segments and mutations affecting these anterior seg­
ments cause embryonic lethality. Alternatively, the regulatory landscape within the 
ANT-C may be much simpler because each of the Hox genes (labial, proboscipedia, 
Deformed, Sex combs reduced and Antennapedia) specify only one or at most two 
segments. For example, the Antp gene is only responsible for the specification of 
PS4. In contrast, the BX-C encodes only three Hox genes, but specifies nine para­
segments. Beside Drosophila, various homeotic mutations have been identified in 
the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Beeman 1987) and the silkworm Bombyx 
mori (Ouweneel 1976), but the molecular lesions associated with these mutations 
remain largely unknown.
While it is likely that the BX-C regulatory landscape is similarly organized in 
closely related species, there are no clues on how it arose through evolution. Perhaps, 
each regulatory domain is a remnant of an ancient Hox gene. In this respect, it is 
intriguing to note that there are multiple (five) paralogs of Abd-B like genes in the 
mouse HoxD and HoxC clusters (D9-D13 and C9-C13) and multiple (four) regula­
tory domains for the Abd-B gene alongside the Abd-B gene itself in D. melanogas­
ter (iab-5 to iab-8). In 1978, Ed Lewis proposed that the “genes” affected by the 
segment-specific mutations arose by duplication events during evolution. While this 
prediction was verified after the discovery of the homeobox, the first entire sequence 
determination of the BX-C in 1995 did not reveal any repeated motifs that could 
support the proposal that the regulatory domains arose through duplication events 
(Martin et al. 1995). Similarly, no sequence remnants of a Hox coding sequence 
are present within the entire regulatory sequences of the BX-C and the question of 
how the regulatory domains have appeared and evolved remains a complete mystery 
(Martin et al. 1995).
2.4.1  Splitting the Hox Cluster in Drosophila
In D. melanogaster, the finding that the Hox genes are split into two clusters, the 
ANT-C and the BX-C, constitutes a second deviation from the ancestral organization 
of the bilaterian Hox cluster. In brief, two major splits in the Hox cluster occurred 
independently during evolution of the Drosophila groups. In the Sophophora 
group, to which D. melanogaster belongs, the split separated the ancestral cluster 
between Antp and Ubx. Another, separate split occurred between Ubx and abd-A 
in the Drosophila group to which D. virilis belongs (Von Allmen et al. 1996; Lewis 
et  al. 2003; Negre et  al. 2003; Negre and Ruiz 2007). An additional, third split 
was observed in two species belonging to the D. virilis group, separating the two 

40
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
most anterior Hox genes labial and proboscepedia (Negre et al. 2003). Additional 
micro rearrangements also occurred and two Hox genes of the ancestral cluster lost 
their Hox function, becoming active much earlier during development (see Garcia-
Fernandez 2005).
Rather than drawing the evolutionary tree that can be deduced from these rear­
rangements, we will speculate here on the possible reasons that allowed the loos­
ening of the structural constraints of collinearity in Drosophila. This loss likely 
stems from two major differences that distinguish Drosophila from the rest of the 
insects, arthropods and vertebrates in their mode of developing their anteroposterior 
axis. Drosophila belongs to the class of insects with long germband development. 
Their entire anteroposterior axis is generated simultaneously. More primitive insects 
follow the mode of development called short germband development, where only 
the anterior segments are present at the start of gastrulation. The remaining pos­
terior segments are formed during a later growth phase (Krause 1939; see Liu and 
Kaufman 2005). In this respect, the short germband mode of development more 
closely resembles embryogenesis in vertebrates, where the body develops in an ante­
rior to posterior temporal progression with new structures developing from cells that 
emerge from a posterior growth zone. In vertebrates, the linear order of the Hox clus­
ters is mechanistically linked to the temporal order of their activation (Duboule 1994; 
see Gaunt 2018 for a recent review). Given the temporal progression of the forma­
tion of the anterior-posterior axis, the temporal order of activation of the Hox genes 
translates into a spatial order of expression, with the earlier expressed genes being 
expressed in the more anterior segments. In Drosophila and other long germband 
insects, there is an almost synchronized appearance of the whole anterior-posterior 
axis, and with it, the Hox genes expression can appear simultaneously. Perhaps, the 
implementation of the regulatory network of gap and pair-rule genes that allow the 
Drosophila embryo to develop so rapidly has freed the Hox cluster from the con­
straint of a collinear cluster organization being required to activate their expression 
properly along the anterior-posterior axis (Von Allmen et al. 1996). In this view, Hox 
gene clustering is a relic of evolution in long germband insects such as Drosophila. 
If collinearity is not a prerequisite for proper activation along the anterior-posterior 
axis in Drosophila, any chromosomal rearrangements interrupting it can occur as 
long as it does not separate the segment-specific regulatory domains from their tar­
get promoter. This is the case with the break that occurred between the bxd/pbx and 
iab-2 regulatory domains in D. virilis, splitting the BX-C between the domain neces­
sary for Ubx expression and the domain required for abd-A expression. It is worth­
while noting that, so far, the regulatory domains associated with abd-A regulation 
have never been found separated from the regulatory domains associated with Abd-B 
regulation. Perhaps the Mcp boundary separating iab-4 from iab-5, which forms the 
border between the abd-A and Abd-B domain, is too small to be disrupted without 
interfering with either abd-A or Abd-B regulation (or both). However, the existence 
of the iab-8 ncRNA is probably more likely the reason that the BX-C has never been 
split between abd-A and Abd-B in Drosophila and related species, because any chro­
mosomal break within the iab-8 ncRNA transcription units would probably cause 
sterility. We have shown that the genomic features of the iab-8 ncRNA transcription 
unit are conserved in the Sophophora group and that a similar transcript exists in 

41
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
D. virilis (Gummalla et al. 2012). Furthermore, Wang et al described the existence 
of a similar transcript in Bombyx mori (Wang et al. 2019) and it may well be that the 
integrity of the iab-8 ncRNA transcription unit has been a selective pressure to keep 
the abdominal region of the BX-C intact.
As mentioned above, there is an additional conserved feature among Hox gene 
clusters whereby the gene expressed in more posterior structures represses the 
expression of the gene expressed more anteriorly. This rule has been dubbed the pos­
terior dominance rule. As we already previously pointed out, the repression of abd-A 
by the iab-8 ncRNA fits with the posterior dominance rule. But there is a difference 
here because this anterior gene repression is not mediated by a posterior Hox protein, 
but instead it is mediated by transcriptional interference. In this respect, it is possible 
that ancestral Hox genes turned off their more anterior neighbors by readthrough 
transcription and that the iab-8 ncRNA is a remnant from such a mechanism where 
the coding sequence has been lost. Echoing this hypothesis, it is worthwhile men­
tioning that transcriptional readthrough of Antp to Ubx has been reported in crusta­
ceans (Shiga et al. 2006).
2.4.2  Polycomb-Mediated Silencing As a Mechanism 
to Keep Hox Genes Clustered
While there is compelling evidence indicating that collinearity is not necessary 
for the spatial activation of the Hox genes in Drosophila anymore, there are also 
arguments suggesting that Polycomb-mediated silencing exerts a pressure to keep 
the complex intact. A clue in support of this hypothesis comes from a rule that Ed 
Lewis had extracted from his observations on the phenotypic consequences of chro­
mosomal rearrangement breaks that split the BX-C; he dubbed this rule the Cis-
OverExpression rule (COE, Lewis 1985). COE states that in addition to disrupting 
the segment-specific function in which a rearrangement break occurs, it tends to 
hyperactivate in cis the segment-specific function lying immediately anterior to that 
affected by the break. For example, a lesion affecting iab-3 will give rise to flies that 
have their A3 developing like a copy of A2 (an anteriorly oriented LOF transforma­
tion toward the ground state). Surprisingly, however, when this iab-3 chromosome is 
heterozygous, the resulting flies harbor a dominant phenotype in which A1 is trans­
formed toward A2 (a posteriorly oriented GOF transformation). Similarly, in hetero­
zygous conditions, a chromosome carrying a break interrupting iab-6 will give rise 
to a fly with A4 transformed toward A5, because the remaining iab-5 domain cannot 
be properly silenced in A4. In each case, it is as if the last more-anterior domain 
relative to the break cannot be properly silenced when separated from the posterior 
part of the complex. A first clue about the molecular mechanisms behind the COE 
phenomenon was published in 1995 by the laboratory of Welcome Bender, where 
they described the existence of at least one PRE in each regulatory domain of the 
BX-C (Chiang et al. 1995). Their results suggested that Pc MEs in adjacent regula­
tory domains are cooperating across boundaries, thereby re-enforcing Pc-mediated 
repression. Rearrangement breakpoints splitting the continuity of the BX-C interrupt 
such cooperative interactions. In the case of the iab-3 break mentioned above, ­iab-2 
silencing in A1 might be weakened by the loss of cooperativity originating from 

42
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
iab-3 and the more posteriorly acting domains iab-4, 5 etc. Partial loss of silencing 
will invariably result in GOF phenotypes. If the COE rule is a general feature of Pc-
mediated silencing, a rearrangement break between the bxd/pbx and iab-2 regula­
tory domains, as has occurred in D. virilis, should compromise bxd/pbx repression 
in PS5/T2 (where it is normally inactive) and lead to a transformation of PS5/T2 into 
PS6/T3 (similar to some kind of Cbx phenotype). However, if the new DNA that is 
juxtaposed next to the bxd/pbx regulatory domain by the rearrangement breakpoint 
comes from a locus that is also silenced by Pc repressive mechanisms, it may heal 
the lesion by bringing new MEs into the vicinity, thereby preventing COE. Such 
rearrangements bringing foreign DNA regulated by Pc-silencing into the vicinity of 
the BX-C may not be that rare in light of the existence of the so-called Polycomb 
bodies. In 1998, Buchenau et al described for the first time that Polycomb repres­
sive complexes form about 100 foci in the interphase nuclei of Drosophila embryos. 
These foci are thought to result from the coalescence of loci that are silenced by 
Pc-repressive complexes thereby reinforcing the strength of repression. For example, 
in anterior segments where both Antp and the BX-C are silenced, Bantignies et al. 
(2011) found the two complexes in close proximity despite being located 10 Mb 
apart in the genome. The homeotic genes are silenced in the germline and are likely 
associated with other remote silenced chromatin sites by Polycomb body assembly. 
In case of the occurrence of a chromosomal break within the BX-C, DNA in the 
proximity has an increased probability to serve as templates to heal the free DNA 
ends. If the BX-C resides with other chromatin sites within a Polycomb body, the 
chance of interacting with DNA also associated with Polycomb silencing is quite 
likely to occur. Such a phenomenon may have allowed the splitting of the BX-C at 
the Fub boundary in D.virilis. Nevertheless, we favor the idea that the nature of the 
Polycomb repressive complexes imposes a selective pressure to keep Hox genes in 
clusters in Drosophila.
2.5  CONCLUDING REMARK
Given the essential roles played by the Hox proteins during the early steps of 
embryogenesis, it would seem that LOFs in Hox genes should be disruptive and 
lead to lethality. If that was true, Hox gene mutations should have remained unno­
ticed during the early days of Drosophila genetics, when screens and functional 
inferences were mostly scored in adult flies. However, we have now learned that the 
homeotic phenotypes observed in adults of the numerous BX-C mutations recovered 
during a century of research were the results of very slight alterations in the spatio-
temporal expression patterns of the Hox genes of the BX-C. These dynamic and 
complex spatio-temporal expression patterns are generated by multiple regulatory 
elements that are spread over large distances of DNA from upstream, downstream 
or internal positions relative to the Hox transcription units. It turned out that the 
large size of these regulatory regions offers a fantastic target for disruptive chromo­
somal rearrangement mutations that separate the various regulatory elements from 
their target promoters, disturbing, in this manner, the expression pattern of the target 
gene. Hence, the BX-C is probably the best-characterized complex genetic locus 
in a higher eukaryote with more than 60 mutations that have been localized on the 

43
Multiple Layers of Complexity in Regulation of the Bithorax Complex
DNA map (one mutation every 5,000 bp). A corollary to these properties explains 
why the vast majority of homeotic mutations that Ed Lewis recovered during his 
career were chromosomal breaks such as translocations, inversions or deficiencies, 
as well as insertions of transposable elements. Thanks to these properties, Ed Lewis 
discovered the fascinating collinearity property whereby the order of the homeotic 
lesions on the chromosome corresponds to the order of the segments affected along 
the anterior-posterior axis of the fly (Lewis 1978). This collinearity is written on top 
of another collinearity in which the order of the transcription units encoding the Hox 
proteins reflects their expression pattern along the anterior-posterior axis. Whether 
these two layers of collinearity are related to each other remains to be determined. 
At the molecular level, we now know that the sequential activation along the chromo­
some of the segment-specific regulatory regions results from the progressive removal 
of the me3K27H3 repressive mark from the nucleosomes associated with the BX-C 
(Bowman et al. 2014). Every segment-specific regulatory domain is composed of the 
same type of cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs) which include initiator elements, cell-
type or tissue-specific enhancers, MEs (such as Polycomb and trithorax response 
elements, PRE/TRE) and finally boundary/insulator elements. How these various 
types of CRMs communicate with each other, to coordinate their regulatory output 
remains a mystery for the moment. Studies focusing on the boundary elements sug­
gest that in addition to orchestrating the autonomy of adjacent regulatory domains, 
boundaries also play a structural role in organizing the 3D structure of the chroma­
tin, thereby enabling long-distance enhancer-promoter communication. (Cleard et al. 
2006; Li et al. 2011; Kyrchanova et al. 2019; Mateo et al. 2019). Such detailed char­
acterization of a complex regulatory region into segment-specific domains is rather 
unique in the biology of higher eukaryotes and it is extremely challenging to draw a 
plausible scenario as to how it arose during evolution. The regulatory landscape of 
the BX-C has been deduced from the analysis of the adult cuticle phenotypes associ­
ated with the homeotic transformations and from the observation of the expression 
patterns of Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B in the epidermis and CNS in embryos. From what 
has been observed in other germlayers (gut, visceral mesoderm and in the male 
AG), expression of Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B in these tissues does not depend on the 
segment-specific regulatory domain paradigm. The role of Ubx, abd-A and ­Abd-B 
in these tissues cannot be inferred from forwards genetic screens, because the phe­
notypes caused by their loss-of-function mutations are too discrete to be noticed by 
simple examination of the fly. However, the many existing chromosomal breaks or 
deficiency mutations located on the DNA sequence allows for quick localization of 
the enhancers responsible for expression in those tissues and to perform an in-depth 
analysis in mutant conditions. Like in other arthropod and vertebrate Hox clusters, 
a microRNA is imbedded within the BX-C region. Once again, the available set of 
localized BX-C chromosomal rearrangement breaks mutations has been instrumen­
tal in understanding that this micro-RNA is processed from at least three transcripts 
with very different spatio-temporal regulation in Drosophila. Throughout a century 
of research, the BX-C has constantly provided scientists with exciting new findings. 
The collection of mutations that have been accumulated over this long period form a 
powerful patrimony that will undoubtedly remain useful in unraveling new discover­
ies that still await us.

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
3.1  INTRODUCTION
The discovery of Hox genes and their remarkable degree of conservation and orga­
nization transformed our understanding of the origins of animal diversity. It marked 
the beginning of an intellectual journey away from organisms and their component 
parts as uniquely constructed by taxon-specific information and toward animal 
diversity as arising from conserved, deeply homologous building blocks (Carroll, 
Grenier, and Weatherbee 2005). Initially, this deep level of conservation posed a 
challenge to our understanding of the origins of phenotypic diversity: if genes, their 
products, and the pathways they contribute to are so conserved, how could evolution 
not be severely constrained? This challenge was overcome through the realization 
that development is also extraordinarily modular across levels of biological organi­
zation. Consequently, relatively simple evolutionary changes in the location, timing, 
amount of product, and governance of developmental processes were found to be 
sufficient to beget tremendous diversity, emerging not despite the conservation of 
developmental building blocks, but because of it (reviewed in Moczek 2019).
The revolution initiated by the discovery of Hox genes also forced a reassess­
ment of our understanding of the origins of novelty in evolution. Prior, evolution­
ary novelty was considered to start when homologous relationships ended. In fact, 
with respect to morphological novelties, one of the most commonly used defini­
tions explicitly requires the absence of homology and homonomy: “A morphological 
novelty is a structure that is neither homologous to any structure in the ancestral 
species nor homonomous to any other structure in the same organism” (Müller and 
Wagner 1991, p. 243). However, over the past three decades, the evo-devo revolution 
thoroughly reworked the concept of homology away from a binary concept (two 
structures either are or are not homologous) and toward what essentially amounts to 
a layered gradient: structures can share homology on some level of biological orga­
nization but not others, and even what they share can be partial. As such, evo-devo 
re-conceptualized the relationships between homology and innovation and diversi­
fication in ways that fully aligned with the one concept that founded evolutionary 
biology over 150 years ago – descent with modification (Wake, Hall, and Olson 
2006; Moczek 2008). It also put researchers in a position to stop debating what does 
and does not qualify as a novelty (though of course some still do) and focus more on 
the process of innovation in developmental evolution and the rules that govern when 
and how increasingly divergent phenotypes may be allowed to rise from within the 
confines of ancestral variation.
Our understanding of Hox genes also underwent significant transformations over 
recent decades. Specifically, increasing knowledge about when, how, and where in 
development Hox genes execute their functions resulted in a shift away from the 
notion of master regulators, i.e., genes acting as a switch turning on or off a gene 
network module and its resulting developmental process, and toward the concept of 
conditional regional specifiers, in which the presence of specific transcription fac­
tors conveys spatial information and enables region-specific regulation of downstream 
effectors of developmental processes. This became even more evident when experi­
ments showed that Hox proteins need to be present throughout ontogeny to complete 
developmental trajectories, rather than only at their onset (Weatherbee et al. 1998); 

55
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
in other words, Hox genes seem to be acting more like persistent micromanagers 
than master genes (Akam 1998).
These views were reinforced by the many examples of novel traits and func­
tions emerging from gene cooption, neofunctionalization, or gene network rewiring. 
These scenarios all share that they necessitate the ancestral expression of co-opted 
genes at the same developmental time or location, or both, as well as the existence of 
mechanisms that permit genes to be recruited into novel contexts without interfering 
with their ancestral functions (McQueen and Rebeiz 2020). One such mechanism, 
discussed in more detail below, is latency of expression, i.e., gene expression lin­
gering on beyond the precise developmental stages and spatial domains in which it 
is ancestrally required (Rebeiz et al. 2011). Thus, genes contributing to successful 
cooption events may be those that, rather than being subject to a tightly choreo­
graphed turning on (or upregulation) in precise locations, are more promiscuously 
expressed (in space or time, or both) than strictly necessary to support their ancestral 
roles. Hox genes, whose layered pattern of antero-posterior functions results from 
the successive inhibition of anteriorly expressed genes by more posteriorly expressed 
ones (Duboule and Morata 1994), fit this scenario quite well.
The subsequent development of new techniques such as high throughput sequenc­
ing, RNA interference (RNAi), and now CRISPR-Cas9, alongside the establishment 
of diverse new model systems, further revolutionized the field. Researchers are now 
in a position to apply these perspectives well beyond Hox genes and to probe the 
existence of common themes, such as the role of gene latency in cooption events dur­
ing the genesis of novelty in animal developmental evolution. In this chapter, we will 
highlight one such new model system, horned beetles in or closely related to the 
genus Onthophagus, and what we have learned (through the study of Hox genes 
and other transcription factors) regarding the nature of what we call the innovation 
gradient: starting with the baby steps of developmental evolution, followed by sub­
sequent elaboration, eventually yielding structures that at least on the surface strike 
us as entirely novel. We begin with a brief primer on the biology of horned beetles.
3.2  A PRIMER ON BEETLE HORNS AND HORNED BEETLES
Horns or horn-like structures can be observed in diverse beetle families, with the 
majority of species, morphological diversity, and degree of exaggeration being 
concentrated in two subfamilies within the Scarabaeidae, the Dynastinae (rhinoc­
eros beetles), and Scarabaeinae (true dung beetles) (rev. in Snell-Rood and Moczek 
2013). In the vast majority of species, horns extend from either the dorsal head or the 
dorsal first thoracic segment, or both. As such, beetle horns are not modified legs, 
mouthparts, or antennae and instead form in body regions normally not tasked with 
producing appendages or any other type of outgrowth (Moczek and Nagy 2005). 
Consequently, beetle horns were generally viewed as lacking obvious homology 
to other structures in insects or non-insect arthropods, a notion we will challenge 
below, at least for thoracic horns.
Beetle horns are also well known for their extraordinary diversity among and 
within species (Figure 3.1; Moczek 2005). Among species, even closely related 

56
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
species within a single genus, horns may differ widely in relative size, location, num­
ber, and shape (Figure 3.1A–F). This interspecific variation is a reflection of evolved, 
developmentally canalized differences between species. However, much diversity 
also exists within species (Figure 3.1G–L), predominantly on two levels: first, horns 
are commonly restricted to, or greatly elaborated in, males compared to females, a 
consequence of sex-specific development following XX/XY sex determination com­
mon in many beetle families (Kijimoto et al. 2013). Second, males are frequently 
variable in horn development themselves, in many cases resulting in the formation of 
relatively discrete horned or hornless, or major and minor, morphs. In the latter cat­
egory, male dimorphisms can sometimes be so extreme and discrete that the result­
ing morphs have initially been described as belonging to separate species (Paulian 
1935). Variation in horn growth among conspecific males is primarily a consequence 
of nutritional variation experienced during the larval stage: male larvae with access 
to optimal feeding conditions grow to body sizes that permit metamorphosis into 
large male adults, which exhibit fully formed horns, whereas male larvae with access 
to suboptimal feeding conditions metamorphose into smaller male adults, often with 
greatly reduced degrees of horn development (Moczek and Emlen 1999). The result­
ing variation in horn growth in males is thus closely tied to adult body size and 
larval nutrition, in contrast to females in which reduced or absent horn growth is a 
reflection of canalized, sex-specific development regardless of larval nutrition and 
adult female size. This extraordinary diversity of horn phenotypes on different lev­
els of biological organization (among species, sexes, individuals) due to different 
proximate reasons has motivated much research into the mechanisms that facilitate 
species-, sex-, and nutrition-specific development, its interactions, and its evolution 
FIGURE 3.1  Onthophagine beetles boast tremendous diversity in the number, shape, and

The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
(Wasik and Moczek 2011, 2012; Wasik, Rose, and Moczek 2010; Kijimoto, Andrews, 
and Moczek 2010; Kijimoto, Moczek, and Andrews 2012; Casasa and Moczek 2018; 
Casasa, Zattara, and Moczek 2020).
The tremendous diversity in horn phenotypes notwithstanding, all horns – when 
present – appear to be used for the same purpose: aggressive male combat over access to 
females directly, or breeding opportunities females depend on, such as nesting sites and 
burrows. In each species studied so far, “males were found to use their horns to push, 
block, prod, stab, lift, dislodge or otherwise impede rival males from accessing females” 
(Kijimoto et al. 2013). Such fights are often intense, energetically expensive, time con­
suming, but rarely cause injury (Snell-Rood and Moczek 2013). Horns are effective, 
and large-horned males enjoy an advantage in fights, whereas small males, by virtue 
of their body size, generally fail to succeed in fights against larger rivals (Moczek and 
Emlen 2000). However, in many taxa such males have instead specialized to employ 
alternate reproductive “sneaker” tactics: for example, minor males invest heavily into 
testes development and sperm competition, and utilize non-aggressive behaviors to cir­
cumvent physically superior rival males (Moczek and Emlen 2000; Simmons, Emlen, 
and Tomkins 2007). In these males, the absence of horns may not just reflect the lack 
of utility for a weapon, but has also been shown to improve agility of small sneaker 
males (Moczek and Emlen 2000; Madewell and Moczek 2006). Taken together, fully 
horned, large, fighter males on one side, and largely hornless, smaller, sneaker males 
on the other, thus reflect alternative morphological and behavioral adaptations to com­
petition over a limited resource – females. Note, however, that horned and hornless 
males do not reflect different genotypes: instead, they embody alternate, polyphenic, 
morphs, expressed in a context-dependent manner, much like castes in social insects 
or seasonal morphs in butterflies. Nor do small hornless males reflect starvation phe­
notypes. Instead, past work has shown that hornlessness in these males does not result 
from the inability to make horns, but from the active repression of horn formation (via 
Hedgehog signaling; Kijimoto and Moczek 2016). In the sections that follow, we first 
introduce what is currently known about the Hox gene cluster in Onthophagus horned 
beetles, and then focus on the developmental mechanisms that induce horns in the first 
place, regardless of whether they are elaborated or reduced, form in a male or female, 
or represent singular, paired, or otherwise formed structures. The only distinction that 
will emerge as absolutely critical is one of location: we will try to convince the reader 
that the diversity of head and thoracic horns may be underlain by many of the same 
developmental mechanisms, yet that their origin itself is not.
3.3  HOX GENES IN HORNED BEETLES
Current knowledge of Hox gene genomic organization and developmental function 
within Coleoptera comes mostly from studies in the flour beetle Tribolium cas­
taneum. In this species, Hox genes are tightly linked into a single cluster span­
ning approximately 756 Kb and contain all eight members originally described 
in Drosophila fruit flies – labial (lab), proboscipedia/maxillipedia (pb/mxp), 
Deformed (Dfd), Sex combs reduced/Cephalothorax (Scr/Cx), Antennapedia/pro­
thoraxless (Antp/ptl), Ultrabithorax/Ultrathorax (Ubx/Utx), abdominal A (abdA), 
and Abdominal B (AbdB) – plus fushi tarazu (ftz) and zerknült (zen) (Figure 3.2A; 
Shippy et al. 2008). Functional evidence so far suggests Hox genes play similar roles

59
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
in beetle and fly embryonic development, and that at least some of those roles (e.g., 
specifying appendage anteroposterior identities) are also important during post­
embryonic development (Smith and Jockusch 2014). Among horned beetles of the 
genus Onthophagus, only the genome of the bull-headed dung beetle Onthophagus 
taurus is currently available (Zattara et al. 2016c; Thomas et al. 2020). Through a 
combination of automatic (Zattara et al. 2016b) and manual annotation, single-copy 
orthologues of all eight fly genes plus ftz and zen have been identified; however, the 
assembly quality of the current draft is too low to adequately assess the size and 
degree of conservation of the Hox cluster itself, and re-sequencing of this genome 
(and de novo sequencing of two additional onthophagine genomes) is currently in 
progress. Although expression of Hox genes during embryonic development has 
only been described for Dfd and Scr, the patterns at least for these two genes are 
similar to those found in Tribolium (Figure 3.2B–D). Given their well-known role 
in specifying the identity of many structures along the body axis, it would be rea­
sonable to expect that Hox genes are playing a corresponding role in the formation 
of horned beetles during post-embryonic development (Figure 3.2D–F). In the 
following sections, we show how recent assessments of the role of Hox and other 
embryonic patterning transcription factors in Onthophagus beetles has provided 
surprising insights into the developmental and evolutionary origins of thoracic and 
head horns.
3.4  THE ORIGINS OF THORACIC HORNS
The term thoracic horn(s) is a shortcut to refer to projections emanating from the 
pronotum, the dorsal most thoracic sclerite of the first thoracic, aka prothoracic seg­
ment, also often abbreviated as T1. This prothoracic segment, in contrast to the sec­
ond (T2, mesothoracic) and third (T3, metathoracic) segment, never bears wings in 
extant insects, though fossil evidence shows that in some early lineages it supported 
the formation of at least wing-like structures (Grimaldi and Engel 2005). However, 
present-day insects actively suppress the formation of such structures on T1, an 
inhibitory function executed in all insects studied to date by the prothorax-­specific 
Hox gene Sex-combs reduced (Scr) (Struhl 1982; Hughes and Kaufman 2000; 
Curtis et al. 2001; Tomoyasu, Wheeler, and Denell 2005). Interestingly, the insect 
prothorax has emerged as a remarkable hotspot for innovation across insect orders 
(Figure 3.3). Apart from the formation of prothoracic horns in beetles, innovations 
include the prothoracic, often leaf-like enlargements in many grasshoppers (e.g., 
Tetrigidae), the extraordinarily diverse “helmets” of treehoppers (Membracidae), 
and pattern formation, such as the eye spots of click beetles (Elateridae) enabled 
through the two-dimensional arrangement of colored scales, akin to butterflies. To 
probe the very origins of these T1-specific innovations, recent work has focused on 
the role of the gene network underpinning the formation of insect wings, themselves 
perhaps one of the most enigmatic of innovations in animal evolution. Before we 
review the main insights gained from this approach, it will be helpful for us to take a 
brief detour and summarize recent developments in our understanding of the origins 
of insect wings.

60
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
3.4.1  Wings and Wing Serial Homologs
The origin of insect wings has fueled a century-long debate, with two hypotheses 
polarizing the discussion. Accordingly, insect wings arose as expansions of the 
notum, the dorsal plate of thoracic segments (Hamilton 1971; Rasnitsyn 1981), or 
alternatively, from the exite of an ancestral additional proximal leg segment pres­
ent prior to the origin of insects and since absorbed into the (pleural) side wall of 
segments (Kukalová-Peck 1983; Averof and Cohen 1997). These competing notal 
expansion and exite hypotheses recently became united in the dual origin hypothesis 
which posits that wings are composite structures (Figure 3.3, green), contributed 
to by both notal and pleural sources, and hence two distinct wing serial homologs 
(Clark-Hachtel, Linz, and Tomoyasu 2013). Studies on a diversity of insects (Niwa 
et al. 2010; Medved et al. 2015; Elias-Neto and Belles 2016; Prokop et al. 2017; 
Clark-Hachtel and Tomoyasu 2020), including paleontological, morphological, gene 
expression, and gene function approaches, collectively now provide strong support 
for this hypothesis. Further work in Tribolium (Linz and Tomoyasu 2018; Hu et al. 
2018) and Tenebrio (Ohde, Yaginuma, and Niimi 2013) beetles also shows that 
homologous source tissues and resulting morphological structures are not restricted 
to currently wing bearing (T2, T3) segments but instead can also be found in the 
prothoracic segment (T1) as well as all abdominal segments: for instance, structures 
FIGURE 3.3  Hotspots of innovation within the insect body plan. Four regions from a 
hypothetical ancestral apterygote insect from which a diversity of morphological novelties 
has emerged: the anterior, presumptively Hox-free dorsal head (blue) that evolved into the 
reduced head capsule of cyclorraphan flies, the eye stalks of stalked-eye flies or the cephalic 
horns of scarab beetles; the first thoracic segment T1 (leftmost green) that evolved structures 
ranging from the modest marginal carinae of tenebrionids to the spectacular prothoracic 
horns of scarab beetles or the helmets of tree-hoppers; the second and third thoracic seg­
ments (T2 and T3) in which pterygote wings evolved and were further elaborated into, for 
example, halteres and elytra; or the lateral margins of the abdominal segments (purple) 
where functionally important structures like gin traps or pupal support structures have 
originated.

61
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
known as gin traps which can be found laterally on each abdominal segment during 
the pupal stage (Figure 3.3, purple) are now understood to constitute partial wing  
serial homologs. We will return to specifically focus on these structures later in 
this chapter.
Collectively, these findings support the notion that the presence of two distinct 
sets of wing serial homologs per segment may reflect the ancestral condition of tho-
racic and abdominal segments, that the existence of these wing serial homologs pre-
date the actual origin of wings, and that at least some insect lineages succeeded in 
utilizing wing serial homologs to evolve structures other than wings outside T2 and 
T3 (Linz and Tomoyasu 2018; Hu et al. 2018; Ohde, Yaginuma, and Niimi 2013; 
Hu and Moczek 2021). A related argument was put forth years earlier to explain the 
origin of the helmet of treehoppers, hemipteran insects famous for the highly diver-
sified elaborations of the prothorax (Figure 3.3). In a landmark study, Prud’homme 
et al. (2011) posited that a de-repression of the T1 wing homolog network through 
unknown mechanisms enabled its re-use in the context of helmet evolution. However, 
subsequent work (Mikó et al. 2012; Yoshizawa 2012) challenged the validity of the 
data presented (anatomical and gene expression data, but no functional analyses), 
and to date the homology status of the treehopper helmet remains heavily debated 
(e.g., Fisher et al. 2020). In contrast, the work on Tribolium and Tenebrio highlighted 
above yielded results that fully meet the standards needed to establish wing serial 
homology: (i) functional analysis of cardinal wing genes documenting their involve-
ment in a hypothesized wing serial homolog, as well as (ii) transformation of puta-
tive wing serial homologs into structures with unambiguous morphological wing 
identity. These same standards were recently applied to understand the origins of 
prothoracic beetle horns.
3.4.2  On Horns and Wings
Prothoracic horns form outside wing bearing thoracic segments, and superficially 
bear no resemblance to wings: horns are heavily sclerotized, non-hinged outgrowths, 
and in many instances singular, and medially positioned, in contrast to the paired 
and bilaterally positioned wings found on T2 and T3. Nevertheless, several sets of 
evidence now provide strong support for the hypothesis that thoracic horns on T1 and 
bona fide wings on T2 and T3 are at least partially serially homologous. First, diverse 
genes required for the formation and proper patterning of wings are also function-
ally required for the formation of thoracic horns in three horned beetle species: these 
include the wing selector gene vestigial, genes critical to the early patterning of wing 
formation (apterous, homothorax, decapentaplegic, abrupt), and key members of 
the hedgehog (patched, cubitus interruptus) and wingless signaling pathways (pan-
golin, disheveled) (Hu, Linz, and Moczek 2019; Moczek and Rose 2009; Wasik and 
Moczek 2011; Wasik and Moczek 2012; Kijimoto and Moczek 2016). Second, hypo-
morphic downregulation of a subset of these target genes resulted in the retention of 
paired, bilateral vestiges of the thoracic horn similar to what can also be observed 
in wildtype individuals late in larval development, suggesting that even single horns 
medially positioned in the adult may derive from paired, bilateral source tissues (Hu, 
Linz, and Moczek 2019).

62
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Perhaps the most critical evidence came from functional analyses of the 
T1-specific Hox gene Sex combs reduced (Scr). In line with results from a diversity 
of studies in other taxa (Struhl 1982; Hughes and Kaufman 2000; Curtis et al. 2001), 
RNAi-mediated transcript depletion of Scr induces large, ectopic T1 wings, and, 
as in Tribolium, these ectopic T1 wings take on the identity of forewings, or elytra 
(Clark-Hachtel, Linz, and Tomoyasu 2013). However, in horned beetles this induc­
tion is paralleled by a loss or reduction of the prothoracic horn, consistent with the 
hypothesis that in wild-type individuals, Scr may be mediating a transformation of 
bilateral T1 wing homologs into dorso-medial prothoracic horn tissue (Hu, Linz, 
and Moczek 2019). Moreover, analysis of hypomorphic ScrRNAi phenotypes shows 
an inverse relationship between prothoracic horn tissue retained and size of the 
ectopic wing induced. Lastly, joint functional perturbation of pannier (pnr) and Scr 
established a correspondence between thoracic horn tissue in wildtype individuals 
and ectopic T1 wing tissue in ScrRNAi animals: by itself, pnrRNAi removes dorso-
medial projections, including the thoracic horn, yet does not affect the formation 
of T2 or T3 wings. As such, it provides an experimental opportunity to genetically 
ablate thoracic horn tissue without impacting wing formation. Ectopic T1 wings 
formed as a consequence of Scr knockdown alone are prominent, large structures, 
yet ectopic wings formed in a pnrRNAi background are consistently and measurably 
smaller, and further lack the dorsal surface traits observed in Scr single-knockdown 
individuals (Hu, Linz, and Moczek 2019). Collectively, these results support that 
prothoracic horn primordia contribute to ectopic, bilateral T1 wings, and by exten­
sion, that thoracic horns, ectopic wings, and regular fore and hind wings are all at 
least partially serially homologous to each other.
More generally, these findings may help explain why the insect prothorax has 
emerged as a hotspot of evolutionary innovation: as now demonstrated for beetle tho­
racic horns, and hypothesized for many other insect groups, prothoracic wing serial 
homologs under the control of Scr may serve as critical substrate toward the forma­
tion of diverse novel features in this body region (Figure 3.3). If correct, the evolution 
of the gene network governed by Scr must be playing a critical role in this process. 
For example, the same study that assessed the function of diverse wing-related genes 
in thoracic horn formation (Hu, Linz, and Moczek 2019) also executed a compara­
tive RNAseq study of wings, as well as known or presumed wing serial homologs, 
and tissues unrelated to wing formation. While all wing-related tissues were found 
to share the expression of vestigial, expanding this approach to 41 genes known to 
be functionally required for some aspect of wing formation showed a significant 
transcriptional divergence of thoracic horn tissue from other wing serial homologs. 
Furthermore, transcriptome-wide clustering of all 4191 differentially expressed tran­
scripts revealed no clustering pattern corresponding to wing relatedness among any 
of the tissues examined. This result suggests that wing serial homologs such as those 
existing in T1 may serve as developmental-genetic starting points, followed later in 
development by the establishment of structure-specific transcriptional repertoires, in 
turn facilitating morphological differentiation events specific to each trait. If correct, 
this suggests that the downstream repertoire of Scr must exhibit remarkable evolu­
tionary lability, able to support the independent evolution of highly diversified out­
growths in diverse hemi- and holometabolous orders. In the next section, we explore 

63
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
how a similar interplay between Hox genes, wing serial homologs, or other target 
genes may also contribute to morphological diversification and innovation outside 
the thorax.
3.4.3  Hox Gene–Mediated Innovation Outside the Thorax
Work on the beetle genera Tribolium (Linz and Tomoyasu 2018; Hu et al. 2018) and 
Tenebrio (Ohde, Yaginuma, and Niimi 2013) showed that wing serial homologs and 
corresponding morphological structures need not be restricted to thoracic segments 
but instead can also be found in all the abdominal segments: for instance, gin traps, 
which can be found bilaterally on each abdominal segment during the pupal stages of 
Tribolium and Tenebrio, consist of bifurcated, strongly sclerotized outgrowths with 
toothed flanges, and are used as defensive structures (Hinton 1946; Wilson 1971; 
Eisner and Eisner 1992). Work by Hu et al. (2018) showed that most of the upstream, 
but not downstream genes, within the hierarchy of the wing gene regulatory network 
are indeed required for the correct formation of gin traps, and established that much 
like thoracic horns in Onthophagus, gin traps in both Tribolium and Tenebrio share 
partial serial homology with other wing-related tissues (Ohde, Yaginuma, and Niimi 
2013). Intriguingly, while abdominal appendages and projections are restricted to 
the posterior-most abdomen in most adult insects (e.g., genitalia, ovipositors, cerci), 
such outgrowths are common throughout abdominal segments in immature stages: a 
great diversity of pupae, nymphs, and larvae possess bilateral and segmentally reiter­
ated spikes, blades, or gin trap-like outgrowths (Figure 3.3, purple). This raises the 
question whether the extraordinary diversity found in these abdominal projections 
might similarly be enabled through the reuse and subsequent diversification of wing 
serial homologs.
The first additional data able to put this intriguing hypothesis to the test are now 
available from horned beetles. Ignoring the possession of horns for the moment, the 
subfamily Scarabaeinae, or true dung beetles, to which a large fraction of horned 
beetles belong, is also famous for the formation of pupae with bilateral and seg­
mentally reiterated projections. These so-called pupal support structures are taxo­
nomically widespread and have been proposed to facilitate the correct positioning of 
pupae in underground pupation chambers and distancing from substrate to minimize 
microbial infections (though experimental testing of these hypotheses is still pend­
ing). A first functional genetic analysis of these structures (Hu and Moczek 2021) 
found that out of 14 genes prominently positioned within the wing gene regulatory 
network, at least 10 were functionally required for the proper formation of 2 types of 
pupal support structures; 8 of those genes were also required for the proper forma­
tion of thoracic horns. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that pupal 
support structures also constitute partial wing serial homologs, as might the extraor­
dinary diversity of abdominal outgrowths so common in arthropods. Here the func­
tional significance of abdominal Hox genes such as abdA or AbdB in establishing 
structure-specific transcriptional landscape and their lineage-specific diversification 
is largely unknown and constitutes a promising avenue for future research. Yet at 
least some functional perturbations already hint at intriguing interactions: for exam­
ple, in bioluminescent Photuris fireflies, downregulation of AbdB not only results in 

64
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
a spectacular homeotic transformation of genitalia to legs, but also a severe disrup­
tion of lantern formation in the 6th and 7th abdominal segments, including a deletion 
of the bioluminescent lantern and a loss of transparent cuticle that normally overlays 
this organ (Stansbury and Moczek 2014).
3.5  THE DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION OF HEAD HORNS: 
PARALLEL INNOVATION IN A HOX-FREE SPACE?
Horned beetles are also well known for a great diversity of horns located on the 
dorsal surface of the head, usually referred to as head (or cephalic) horns. Recall 
that like their thoracic counterparts, head horns are elongated, often pointed, non-
articulated extensions of the body wall, and show a diversity of shapes and nutrition-
responsiveness across species (Figure 3.1). In fact, many species sport both thoracic 
and head horns which often function in a tightly integrated manner as pincers or 
clamps able to grab, secure, lift, and throw opponents during combat (reviewed in 
Hu et al. 2020; Moczek 2005). All of this would suggest both horn types are likely to 
be serial homologs, or at least to be regulated by a common regulatory gene network. 
However, current evidence not only fails to support that thoracic and cephalic horns 
are serial homologs, or homologs of any kind, but instead points at their completely 
independent evolution through their reliance on discrete gene regulatory networks, 
one operating within a Hox expression region governed by Scr and the other within 
a presumptively Hox-free space.
3.5.1  Head Horn Development and Diversity
Like thoracic horns (see above), head horns form as folded outgrowths of the devel­
oping pupal epidermis during the prepupal stage, underneath the head capsule 
of the last larval instar. After shedding the larval head capsule at pupation, head 
horns unfold and inflate as the internal hemolymph pressure pushes them outward 
(Moczek, Cruickshank, and Shelby 2006; Gotoh et al. 2021); during the pupal stage, 
pupal horns are further sculpted into their final, adult morphology (Moczek 2006, 
Kijimoto et al. 2010).
The extraordinary diversity of head horn shapes found within the Onthophagini 
can nonetheless be categorized into two main types of horns: far more common 
posteriorly placed horns (as seen, for example, in Digitonthophagus gazella, O. 
taurus) and much rarer anterior horns (as seen in male O. sagittarius) (Figure 3.1) 
(Emlen et al. 2005). Cell fate mapping experiments using ablation of epidermal tis­
sue from the dorsal larval head established that despite their large morphological 
diversity, posterior horns derive from tissue located along the boundary between 
two embryonic head “segments”, the posterior ocular and the anterior clypeolabral 
regions (Busey, Zattara, and Moczek 2016). Anterior horns, in contrast, derive from 
larval head regions fully contained within the clypeolabral region. Studies in O. 
taurus, a species with male-specific posterior horns, have shown that at the prepupal 
stage, when future horns first develop, anterior and posterior head regions exhibit 
marked differences in their transcriptional landscapes: the anterior region presents 
a more homogeneous landscape with little medial-to-lateral differentiation, while 

65
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
the posterior region presents a much more heterogeneous profile and more marked 
medial-to-lateral differentiation (Linz and Moczek 2020). Intriguingly, these differ­
ences are observed in both horn-bearing males and hornless females, suggesting that 
it may reflect a general property of the dorsal beetle head irrespective of the presence 
or absence of horns.
3.5.2  The Dorsal Head: A Hox-Free Space?
Given that anterior Hox genes are important for proper specification of several struc­
tures in the arthropod head (e.g., mouthparts), they were likely candidates for a role 
in the spectacular elaborations of cephalic structures found in many insect species 
in general (Figure 3.3, blue), and specifically for a role in head horn development. 
However, most experiments to date have consistently failed to produce evidence for 
their involvement in instructing head horns; in fact, the dorsal region of the head 
of most insects has proven surprisingly oblivious to Hox gene manipulations, even 
when corresponding ventral regions had shown a phenotype. Such lack of response 
of dorsal head tissues to Hox manipulation stands in stark contrast to other parts of 
the body, in which both ventral and dorsal regions are affected by homeotic transfor­
mations (e.g., the transformation of halteres to wings and T3 to T2 legs in Drosophila 
Ubx mutants; Weatherbee et al. 1998) and strongly suggests that the assembly of the 
insect dorsal head differs fundamentally from that of the rest of the body.
Currently, the best explanation for these differences is the “bend-and-zipper” 
model of head development, which posits that during insect embryonic development, 
the anterior-most region of the embryo – the future clypeolabral region – bends 
dorsally, then is bilaterally overtaken by the ocular region, followed by the medial 
fusion (“zipping”) of the left and right ocular region into one continuous ocular “seg­
ment” (Figure 3.4A; Posnien et al. 2010). Evidence for this model comes primarily 
from detailed studies of “anterior” gene expression during embryonic development 
in the flour beetle T. castaneum (Schinko et al. 2008; Posnien, Bashasab, and Bucher 
2009; Posnien 2009; Posnien and Bucher 2010; Posnien et al. 2011). Importantly, 
the anterior-most region of the body of most bilaterians, including arthropods, is 
ancestrally free of Hox gene expression and is instead patterned by an independent 
and unique gene network, which includes optix/six3 and orthodenticle (otd), two 
transcription factor-encoding genes exhibiting complementary expression domains 
at the clypeolabral-ocular boundary (Figure 3.4B; Li et al. 1996; Posnien et al. 2011). 
Both genes have been shown to be ancestrally expressed at the anterior end of bila­
terians (Steinmetz et al. 2010), including beetles; in insects, the process envisioned 
by the “bend-and-zipper” model introduced above therefore results in a head with 
a ventral compartment formed by Hox expressing regions, yet a seemingly comple­
mentary dorsal compartment comprised by a Hox-free space; i.e., a head in which 
dorsal and ventral tissues located in the same antero-posterior position have origi­
nated from sources located at initially different, even non-adjacent, antero-posterior 
positions in the early embryo. This model explains the resilience of the dorsal head to 
Hox gene manipulations and implies that structures evolving within the dorsal head 
domain should not be able to link to gene regulatory networks that depend on Hox 
gene expression. In other words, dorsal head structures – like head horns – cannot 

66
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
be expected to be serially homologous to structures developing from Hox regulated 
body regions – like thoracic horns.
This is confirmed by experimental observations: experimental knockdown of reg-
ulatory members of the gene networks directing the development of wings, thoracic 
horns and their serial homologs do not affect head horn development (Hu, Linz, and 
Moczek 2019). In contrast, head horn development is disrupted after interference 
with any of several genes ancestrally tasked with instructing embryonic head forma-
tion (Zattara et al. 2016a; Zattara et al. 2017; Linz and Moczek 2020). For example, 
postembryonic knockdown of otd drastically alters adult dorsal head patterning 
including the formation and positioning of horn development, causes severe reduc-
tion of normal posterior head horns, and even more strikingly, induces the formation

67
The Role of Hox Genes in the Origins and Diversification of Beetle Horns
of additional ectopic horns in the anterior region of the dorsal head (Zattara et al. 
2016a). Importantly, the effects of otd knockdown on head horns do not appear to 
be a collateral result of broader effects on beetle head development, since the same 
manipulations have no effect in the head of Tribolium (however, RNAi phenotypes 
outside the head are shared in both taxa). Additionally, two independent studies 
implicate components of the gene network underlying eye patterning: Linz and  
Moczek (2020) documented sex-specific expression of eye patterning genes in poste-
rior head compartments (note, actual eye forming regions were removed during sam-
ple preparation) and Zattara et al. (2017) demonstrated that otdRNAi in Onthophagus 
(but not Tribolium) induces the formation of functional ectopic compound eyes in 
the posteromedial dorsal head. More generally, these findings demonstrate that head 
horns are not serial homologs of thoracic horns, wings, or any other segmentally 
reiterated structure, and thus neither rely on wing nor Hox genes in their develop-
ment. Instead, head horns emerge as patterned at least in part by genes ancestrally 
tasked with instructing the formation of the embryonic head, and possibly genes 
otherwise well-studied for their role in the formation of compound eyes and ocelli. 
Intriguingly, while ocelli (typically three single-lens eyes located on the posterior 
medial head of most insect orders) are positioned similar to posterior head horns, 
they constitute a structure secondarily lost in the early stages of beetle evolution 
(Leschen and Beutel 2004).
But, is the dorsal head truly and entirely a Hox-free space? In contrast to Tribolium, 
there are very few data that would permit an assessment of embryonic Hox gene 
expression in Onthophagus, yet preliminary work suggests congruence between 
anterior Hox gene expression between Onthophagus and what has been described for 
flour beetles and flies (Figure 3.2B–C; D. Linz and A. Moczek, unpublished data), 
at least for embryos. Available expression data on postembryonic development come 
mainly from RNAseq experiments, and here things become more complicated. In a 
study in which four tissues located at different positions along the body were sam-
pled at an early pupal stage (Ledón-Rettig, Zattara, and Moczek 2017), transcrip-
tion of all eight O. taurus Hox genes showed a distribution pattern similar to that 
described for many insect embryos (Figure 3.4C). Notably, anterior Hox genes not 
only remain transcriptionally active as late as metamorphosis, but they seem to be 
expressed even in the dorsal head. Additional confirmation comes from the genome-
wide study of the transcriptional landscape of prepupal dorsal head regions (Linz 
and Moczek 2020) highlighted already, showing that several Hox genes seem to have 
expanded their expression beyond their presumed gnathal domains (Figure 3.4D): 
labial, proboscipedia, and deformed exhibit compartment-specific expression in the 
dorsal head in clear contradiction to Tribolium’s bend and zipper model and findings 
in diverse other taxa (Posnien and Bucher 2010), making the dorsal Onthophagus 
head a not-so-Hox-free space. Functional analyses are currently ongoing.
3.5.3  Developmental Inertia and Gene Latency
To date, all evidence points to a separate and independent origin of head and tho-
racic horns in scarab beetles, even though both horn types do share at least some 
patterning genes (e.g., the proximodistal polarity genes homothorax and Distal-less; 

68
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Moczek and Nagy 2005). Similarly, otdRNAi affects both head horns and pupal/
adult thoracic horns (Zattara et al. 2016a), though the latter is likely a consequence of 
otd’s general and evolutionarily conserved function in patterning dorsal and ventral 
midline structures along the body axis. Nevertheless, had this gene been the first or 
only gene to be investigated, it would have likely prompted the conclusion that both 
types of horns were serial homologs. Thus, claims of serial or even “deep” homology 
stemming from finding a common role for one or few genes should be approached 
with caution.
Although otd has a critical role during embryonic head formation in (ancestrally 
hornless) Tribolium beetles (Schröder 2003; Kotkamp, Klingler, and Schoppmeier 
2010), otd seems to play no role in their post-embryonic head development, in stark 
contrast to Onthophagus beetles. Interestingly, otd is expressed in both Tribolium 
and Onthophagus heads at larval, prepupal, pupal, and adult stages (Zattara et al. 
2016a). While a different, yet to be described role for otd in postembryonic heads of 
Tribolium cannot be ruled out, it is tempting to speculate that through developmental 
inertia (defined as a tendency for expression of a given gene to remain on past the 
developmental stages in which it had a function), genes such as otd (and possibly 
the Hox genes discussed above) may retain latent, non-adaptive, yet tissue-specific 
expression in the dorsal head of beetles. Additional evidence for such a scenario 
derives from the transcriptional assessment of dorsal head compartments by Linz 
and Moczek (2020) in O. taurus: a subsequent functional analysis of 22 genes show­
ing robust localized expression in the dorsal head, including 9 genes well known 
for their role in embryonic head patterning, failed to document a functional role 
in head and/or horn formation, despite unambiguous knockdown phenotypes else­
where in the body. A study using the same approach in a distantly related horned 
species, the rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus, reported a similar result: a 
majority of genes found to be differentially expressed in horn-producing tissues and 
tested for function failed to show evidence of a role in horn development (Ohde et al. 
2018). This pattern, however, may be evolutionarily labile: despite lacking a role 
in horn development in O. taurus, knockdown of three genes (retinal homeobox, 
cap’n’collar, and Sp8) in the closely related O. sagittarius strongly reduced the size 
of the anterior horns found in males of this species (Linz and Moczek 2020). Taken 
together, current data thus strongly support a scenario whereby horn development 
evolves by dynamically adding and removing gene network members that exhibit 
latent, non-adaptive, tissue-specific expression as a result of developmental inertia.
3.6  WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED, AND WHERE 
DO WE GO FROM HERE?
The study of horned beetles has further confirmed emerging themes in the study 
of innovation in developmental evolution, as well as expanded our perspectives in 
directions that we hope will motivate future research. For instance, the study of 
thoracic horns has added a spectacular example underscoring the potential of how 
a deeply ancestral gene network, one best known for instructing the formation of 
insect wings, can fuel extensive innovation in insect development outside traditional 
wing-bearing segments. This now includes — besides beetle horns – the bilateral 

69

projections of scarab pupae, Tribolium and Tenebrio gin traps, and very likely the 
helmets of membracid treehoppers as well as other bilateral and medial elabora­
tions in the prothorax and abdomen of many insects. And just like Antp and Ubx 
play critical roles in the formation of fore- and hind wings, as does Scr in the for­
mation of prothoracic beetle horns, Hox genes in general are likely to emerge as 
crucial players in the regulation and evolution of the segment-specific transcriptional 
landscapes that underpin the elaboration of a given wing serial homolog. Does this 
mean the prothoracic horns of beetles or helmets of treehoppers no longer count as 
morphological novelties? We posit that instead, discoveries such as these add to the 
growing call to – once and for all – abandon a definition of evolutionary novelty that 
necessitates the absence of homology and to instead focus on the genesis of novelty 
as a gradual process of innovation that allows descent with modification to seed the 
initiation of a novel trait, which once in existence can then diversify into its variant 
forms (Linz, Hu, and Moczek 2020). Viewed through the lens of such an innovation 
gradient, novelty emerges through homology, rather than somehow in its absence. 
Doing so then redirects our attention to begin investigating the taxonomic, anatomi­
cal, developmental-genetic, but also ecological conditions, and their interactions, that 
determine the circumstances in which ancestral homologies are enabled, or alterna­
tively constrained, to fuel innovation.
The study of beetle head horns further confirms some of the same notions (Hu 
et al. 2020), but also necessitates additional nuances (Linz, Hu, and Moczek 2020). 
Rather than being instructed by the same core gene network underpinning the for­
mation of wing serial homologs, the positioning and initiation of head horns appear 
to rely on the postembryonic re-deployment of embryonic head patterning mecha­
nisms (Zattara et al. 2016a; Linz and Moczek 2020). If confirmed, this suggests that 
the evolutionary and developmental reach of the innovation gradient may be quite 
extraordinary: embryonic head patterning is among the most conserved of develop­
mental genetic mechanisms across phyla, yet in Onthophagus beetles heterochronic 
changes in the interactions among select gene regulatory network components and 
their functions facilitated the origin of cephalic horns – all in rather evolutionarily 
recent times. The same work also suggested a possibly widespread yet easy to over­
look mechanism that may facilitate the heterochronic redeployment of gene regu­
latory networks that execute key, conserved roles at earlier developmental stages: 
latent yet functionless expression. In both Onthophagus (Linz and Moczek 2020) 
and Tribolium (Zattara et al. 2016a), diverse postembryonic head patterning genes 
exhibit robust, regionally well-defined expression amenable to RNAi-mediated tran­
script depletion yet without resulting in any morphological effects in the dorsal head 
(though in many cases such effects are clearly discernable elsewhere in the body). 
Recall that one of these genes, otd, appears functionless in the dorsal head of adult 
Tribolium, but has acquired a critical new function in Onthophagus as a crucial 
regulator in the positioning of head horn. More generally, these and other results 
suggest that latent yet ancestrally functionless expression may act as a developmen­
tal scaffold for morphological innovation, allowing suites of genes with their (at 
least initially) region-specific expression and local interactors to become available 
for corresponding repurposing. Lastly, while Onthophagus head horns form in the 
dorsal head, and thus a body region generally assumed to be unaffected by Hox gene 

70

function, a role of Hox genes cannot in fact be completely ruled out just yet. More 
generally, the broader significance of gene expression latency and the frequency of 
functional repurposing enabled by it and its contribution to the innovation gradient 
clearly deserve further scrutiny.

4.1  THE PHYLOGENETIC SIGNIFICANCE OF CHELICERATA
Within Arthropoda, the subphylum Chelicerata encompasses a broad swath of diver­
sity, with over 120,000 described species to date. The most familiar members of 
Chelicerata include groups like spiders, scorpions, mites, ticks, and horseshoe crabs. 
Yet this lineage spans an array of rarely encountered and unusual groups, such as sea 
spiders (Pycnogonida), hooded-tick spiders (Ricinulei), and palpigrades (Palpigradi). 
The extant diversity of chelicerates is divided into 14 orders, with 2 marine groups 
(horseshoe crabs and sea spiders) and 12 terrestrial orders (collectively known as 
the arachnids). The rich fossil history of Chelicerata includes some extinct orders, 
including some of the largest known arthropod taxa (e.g., Eurypterida). Molecular 
dating based on this fossil record has supported an ancient diversification of 
Chelicerata that began in the Cambrian (Lozano-Fernández et al. 2020; Ballesteros 
et al. 2021).
In the context of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), chelicerates 
have been targeted as exemplars in comparative analyses, largely due to their phy­
logenetic position (Figure 4.1). Upon the resolution of a historical debate over their 

78
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
phylogenetic position within arthropods, Chelicerata are presently understood to be 
the sister group to the remaining Arthropoda (collectively known as Mandibulata), a 
result that has been robustly recovered by analyses of morphological data (Legg et al. 
2013), genome-scale molecular datasets (Meusemann et al. 2010; Borner et al. 2014), 
and rare genomic changes (i.e., a phylogenetic data class that is typically homoplasy-
free; Rota-Stabelli et al. 2011). Thus, although the majority of arthropod datasets 
in the evo-devo literature are drawn from insect models, polarizing developmental 
phenomena and establishing ancestral states toward the base of Arthropoda requires 
the inclusion of chelicerate data. In this regard, seminal works in arthropod evo-
devo have tackled the developmental biology of spider species, focusing on recon­
struction of the ancestral parasegment (Damen 2002), segment-addition mechanisms 
(Stollewerk et al. 2003; McGregor et al. 2008), neurogenesis (Stollewerk et al. 2001; 
Stollewerk 2002), and appendage development (Abzhanov and Kaufman 2000a; 
Prpic and Damen 2009).
4.2  HISTORICAL STUDIES OF CHELICERATE HOX GENES
Evo-devo datasets played an especially important role in understanding body plan 
evolution in chelicerates and mandibulates, specifically through the lens of Hox 
gene expression surveys (Damen et al. 1998; Telford and Thomas 1998; Damen and 
Tautz 1999; Popadic and Nagy 2001; reviewed by Hughes and Kaufman 2002a). Hox 
expression data were historically brought to bear upon the arthropod head problem,

Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
which pertains to the homology of the anterior-most arthropod head segments. 
Whereas the mandibulate head consists of six segments and only bears sensory 
and feeding appendages, the anterior tagma of Chelicerata (the prosoma) typically 
comprises seven segments, which harbor feeding, sensory, and locomotory append­
ages; the prosoma is therefore more comparable to, and often synonymized with, a 
cephalothorax. Furthermore, it was previously thought that the brain of Mandibulata 
was tripartite, whereas the chelicerate brain putatively consisted only of two seg­
mental ganglia, due to the loss of the deutocerebral (mid-brain) segment (reviewed 
by Popadic et al. 1998). This bipartite arrangement was considered comparable to 
Onychophora (velvet worms), the sister group of Arthropoda (Meusemann et  al. 
2010; Borner et al. 2014; Laumer et al. 2019). The alignment and homology of head 
segments of extant chelicerates, mandibulates, and various extinct groups was there­
fore unclear.
The first expression surveys of anterior Hox genes in a spider and a mite resolved 
the homology of the anterior-most segments (Damen et al. 1998; Telford and Thomas 
1998). It was shown that both chelicerate exemplars retained the deutocerebrum, 
which innervates the chelicerae (feeding appendages). These works inferred that 
the cheliceral segment was homologous to the antennal segment of insects (or the 
first antennal segment of “crustaceans”); the positional homology of the deutocer­
ebral segment was substantiated by both (1) the absence of Hox gene expression (in 
both chelicerates and mandibulates, Hox expression commences in the tritocerebral 
segment), and (2) the innervation of the anterior-most pair of appendages by the 
deutocerebrum.
Similarly, Hox gene data were effectively used to address the homology of ante­
rior segments of sea spiders. The anterior-most pair of appendages of Pycnogonida 
(the chelifores) were previously thought to be innervated by the protocerebrum, 
based upon immunohistochemical investigations of the sea spider protonymphon 
larva (Maxmen et al. 2005). This proposed alignment of segments would make the 
chelifores homologous to the “great appendages” of extinct groups like megachei­
rans and Radiodonta (e.g., the raptorial anterior appendages of anomalocaridids). 
However, surveys of Hox gene expression showed that the sea spider chelifore, like 
the deutocerebral appendages of other arthropods, are innervated by the second head 
segment ganglia and also lack Hox gene expression (Jager et al. 2006). This inter­
pretation was subsequently validated by reexamination of sea spider larval neuro­
anatomy (Brenneis et al. 2008).
While Hox gene surveys proved useful for establishing an understanding of the 
chelicerate bauplan, these early works were limited in two ways. First, the sampling 
of Hox gene expression was taxonomically restricted to two orders: spiders, initially 
represented by the araneomorph species Cupiennius salei and Steatoda triangulosa 
(Damen et al. 1998; Abzhanov and Kaufman 2000a), and acariform mites, repre­
sented by the model species Archegozetes longisetosus (Telford and Thomas 1998). 
Occasional works addressing Hox expression of groups like sea spiders, scorpions, 
and horseshoe crabs generated data only for a subset of the Hox genes, either due to 
peculiarities of these groups’ ontogeny (e.g., the protonymphon larva of sea spiders 
has only four segments; Jager et al. 2006) or limited availability of cross-reactive 
antibodies for immunohistochemical assays specific to Hox genes (e.g., application 

80
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
of UbdA antibody to survey Ubx boundaries in scorpions and horseshoe crabs; 
Popadic and Nagy 2001). Initially, limitations in taxonomic sampling had little 
impact on the Hox survey literature, as the goal was to establish chelicerate datasets 
as points of comparison to mandibulates, with emphasis on insects (Beeman 1987; 
Averof and Patel 1997; Abzhanov and Kaufman 2000b; Brown et al. 2002; Hughes 
and Kaufman 2002b; Angelini and Kaufman 2005; Brena et al. 2006; Janssen and 
Damen 2006). Nevertheless, the limited representation of chelicerates as model 
systems for comparative development hindered exploration of body plan disparity 
within diverse groups like the arachnids.
In addition to the narrow taxonomic scope of early studies, sampling of Hox 
gene expression was limited by the methodology available at the time. Acquisition 
of chelicerate Hox data relied heavily upon degenerate primer design, RACE PCR, 
and cloning for sequencing (reviewed by Hughes and Kaufman 2002a). Such Hox 
surveys risked omitting some genes in the event of failed amplifications, nor could 
such works guarantee that all Hox genes present in chelicerates had been discov­
ered. As a corollary of the methodology, no information was available about the 
architecture of the chelicerate Hox cluster. While insect genomes were becom­
ing available at the turn of the 21st century, the first chelicerate genome was not 
sequenced until 2011 (Tetranychus urticae; Grbic et al. 2011) and the first spider 
genomes until 2014 (Stegodyphus mimosarum and Acanthoscurria geniculata; 
Sanggaard et al. 2014). Classical model systems had already provided examples of 
Hox cluster disruption, such as the well-known division of the Drosophila melano­
gaster cluster into Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes, or the atomization of the 
cluster in Caenorhabditis elegans and Oikopleura dioica (Aboobaker and Blaxter 
2003; Seo et al. 2004; reviewed by Monteiro and Ferrier 2006; Duboule 2007). 
Across Bilateria, the Hox cluster is presently understood to be somewhat conserved 
with respect to spatial and temporal collinearity, despite the loss or duplication of 
Hox genes, or genomic rearrangements to the ancestral architecture (Ferrier and 
Holland 2001, reviewed by Ferrier and Minguillón 2003). The exceptions to this 
rule tend to comprise rapidly developing taxa that retained spatial collinearity, 
but not temporal collinearity (Ferrier and Holland 2001; Ferrier and Minguillón 
2003; Negre et  al. 2005). Given the incidence of numerous rapidly developing 
arachnid groups in Chelicerata (especially parasitic groups within Parasitiformes 
and Acariformes), it was conceivable that Hox cluster evolution would be dynamic 
within Chelicerata, but such ideas could not be tested in the absence of genomic 
resources.
Since the publication of the first chelicerate genome (Grbic et al. 2011), the advent 
of short-read sequencing and whole-genome projects radically altered this land­
scape. Beyond providing the first insights into chelicerate Hox cluster architecture, 
next-generation sequencing transformed the understanding of chelicerates, with the 
discovery of multiple whole genome duplication events within this clade, successful 
resolution of some parts of the chelicerate tree of life through phylogenomic data­
sets, and even the unusual case (for metazoans) of reciprocal illumination between 
genomics and phylogeny, with Hox cluster duplications informing phylogenetic 
placement of some chelicerate orders.

Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
4.3  THE DISCOVERY OF DUPLICATED 
CHELICERATE HOX CLUSTERS
Though it was initially thought that Hox genes occurred as single-copy orthologs in 
Chelicerata, hints of Hox gene duplications in chelicerates are scattered throughout 
the early Hox literature. PCR surveys of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus 
revealed at least 28 homeobox fragments, corresponding to one to four paralogs per 
Hox class (Cartwright et al. 1993). Subsequently, Abzhanov et al. (1999) extended 
the PCR survey approach using universal Hox primers to spiders, discovering dupli­
cates of proboscipedia and Deformed in Parasteatoda tepidariorum. They inferred 
that a single Hox cluster likely represented the ancestral condition of Chelicerata, 
with a subsequent duplication in the branch subtending modern horseshoe crabs. 
Despite the duplications discovered in P. tepidariorum, Abzhanov et al. (1999) ten­
tatively suggested that a single Hox cluster was the most parsimonious inference for 
spiders, given the absence of evidence for widespread paralogy in the two spider 
exemplars they surveyed.
Intriguingly, a nearly contemporaneous survey of Hox expression domains in the 
spider C. salei had revealed a duplication of Ultrabithorax as well, with the two cop­
ies exhibiting slightly differing expression domains (Damen et al. 1998). Schwager 
et al. (2007) reexamined the two Ultrabithorax copies, in addition to detailing the 
expression patterns of duplicates of Deformed and Sex combs reduced in C. salei. 
Schwager et al. (2007) therefore speculated that a major duplication event, possibly 
a Hox cluster duplication or a whole genome duplication, may have occurred in the 
common ancestor of spiders. However, the limited efficiency of PCR-based surveys 
of Hox genes obscured direct tests of Hox cluster duplication and hindered the rec­
onciliation of Hox duplications in spiders and horseshoe crabs.
The influx of genomic resources made possible by short-read sequencing technol­
ogy greatly accelerated the potential for understanding the evolution of Hox clusters 
in Chelicerata. The first chelicerate genome, for the acariform mite species T. urti­
cae, revealed a single Hox cluster, albeit with tandem duplications of fushi tarazu and 
Antennapedia, and loss of abdominal-A (and possibly Hox3; Grbic et al. 2011). The 
loss of abdominal-A in acariform mites has been linked to the loss of segmentation 
posterior to the second opisthosomal segment, both in T. urticae (Grbic et al. 2011) 
and A. longisetosus (Barnett and Thomas 2013). Nevertheless, the single Hox cluster 
established by the T. urticae genome supported the inference of an unduplicated Hox 
cluster in the common ancestor of hexapods and chelicerates. Meanwhile, a series 
of increasingly sophisticated genome assemblies for horseshoe crabs strongly sup­
ported the inference of a two-fold whole genome duplication in the common ancestor 
of Xiphosura (Nossa et al. 2014; Kenny et al. 2016; Gong et al. 2019; Liao et al. 2019), 
with more recent studies suggesting a three-fold whole genome duplication, based 
on the occurrence of additional isolated Hox genes on smaller scaffolds (Shingate 
et al. 2020a, 2020b; Nong et al. 2021). RT-PCR data from L. polyphemus have addi­
tionally supported the interpretation that the Hox duplicates have undergone sub­
functionalization, as inferred from surveys of expression levels in individual body 
segments (Kenny et al. 2016).

82
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Transcriptomic and genomic data for emerging arachnid model systems gradu­
ally illuminated the scale of whole genome duplications across Chelicerata. The first 
developmental transcriptome of a harvestman (order Opiliones) revealed ten single-
copy Hox genes in Phalangium opilio (Sharma et al. 2012), making harvestmen and 
ticks (e.g., Ixodes scapularis) the only known chelicerate models that reflect the 
ancestral Hox complement of Panarthropoda (Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016). More recently, 
a draft genome of this harvestman species supported the inference of a single Hox 
cluster, albeit with four of the ten Hox genes on small scaffolds, due to fragmentation 
of the assembly; the remaining six Hox genes exhibited the expected pattern of col­
linearity, with locations of microRNAs consistent with the panarthropod groundplan 
(Gainett et al. 2021).
By contrast to groups like harvestmen or mites, the first developmental transcrip­
tome of a scorpion recovered an unexpected result; embryos of the bark scorpion 
Centruroides sculpturatus were shown to retain 19 Hox genes—two copies of each 
Hox gene except for Hox3 (Sharma et al. 2014b). The body plan of scorpions is 
notable in that they exhibit the greatest degree of heteronomous segmentation in 
the opisthosoma (the posterior tagma of chelicerates); this region of their body is 
further divided into the mesosoma (commonly called the “abdomen”) and the meta­
soma (the “tail”). The scorpion opisthosoma is remarkable among chelicerates in 
having the largest number of appendage types within Chelicerata, with embryonic 
limb buds giving rise to the genital operculum, the pectines, the four pairs of book 
lungs, and the narrowed metasomal segments. Using whole mount in situ hybrid­
ization data, Sharma et al. (2014b) showed that the four pairs of duplicated Hox 
genes of C. sculpturatus all exhibited unique spatiotemporal expression domains, 
with anterior boundaries corresponding to shifts in segmental or appendage identity. 
These data were suggestive of subfunctionalization of duplicated Hox genes in the 
scorpion. The expression domains of scorpion anterior Hox genes remain unknown.
With Hox duplications encountered in Xiphosura, spiders, and scorpions, a strictly 
traditional view of chelicerate evolution might have inferred these phenomena to 
reflect three separate duplications. Morphological phylogenies of chelicerates tradi­
tionally placed Xiphosura as the sister group to Arachnida; scorpions with Opiliones 
near the base of the arachnid tree of life; and spiders and the other tetrapulmonate 
orders (Amblypygi, Uropygi, and Schizomida) constituting a distantly related lin­
eage (Shultz 2007; Garwood and Dunlop 2014). However, the proliferation of new 
sequencing technologies had begun to transform approaches to molecular phylogeny 
around this time as well, and a recurrent result in molecular phylogenomic studies 
of Chelicerata was the sister group relationship of scorpions and tetrapulmonates 
(Regier et al. 2010; Borner et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2014a). This clade, termed 
Arachnopulmonata (Sharma et al. 2014a), placed spiders and scorpions much closer 
than previously thought, prompting the question of whether these groups underwent 
a shared genome duplication (Sharma et al. 2014b). While the first genomes of spi­
ders and scorpions had been published by that time (Cao et al. 2013; Sanggaard et al. 
2014), these works focused more on the genomics of venoms and silks and did not 
explore comparative genome architecture. The matter of shared genome duplication 
was duly addressed in a comparative genomic work based on the genomes of the 
spider P. tepidariorum and the scorpion C. sculpturatus (Schwager et al. 2017). This 

83
Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
study revealed that P. tepidariorum retained 19 Hox genes organized on two clusters, 
like the 19 Hox genes of C. sculpturatus, albeit with some pseudoscaffolding to over­
come fragmentation of the assembly (see also Pace et al. 2016; note that Schwager 
et al. 2017 reported 20 Hox genes in the C. sculpturatus genome). The expression 
patterns of spider Hox genes were shown to reflect similar dynamics as those of 
C. sculpturatus, and gene tree surveys across chelicerates supported the inference 
that spiders and scorpions shared a whole genome duplication, to the exclusion of 
the independent duplication events in Xiphosura (Schwager et al. 2017). Due to the 
lower quality of the C. sculpturatus genome, analyses of synteny were restricted to 
P. tepidariorum, and these showed evidence of syntenic blocks throughout the spider 
genome. Further support for these inferences was drawn from independent analyses 
of microRNA families (Leite et al. 2016) and patterns of paralogy in the homeobox 
gene family at large (Leite et al. 2018). More recently, chromosome-level genome 
assemblies of the spider species Dysdera silvatica and Trichonephila antipodiana 
have corroborated the inference of ancient whole genome duplication in this lineage 
(Sánchez-Herrero et al. 2019; Fan et al. 2021).
Recent efforts to broaden developmental genetic resources for chelicerates have 
further tested the inference of a shared genome duplication in the common ances­
tor of Arachnopulmonata. Gainett et al. (2020) generated the first developmental 
transcriptomes of two species of Amblypygi (whip spiders), adding a third shortly 
thereafter (Gainett and Sharma 2020). Ballesteros et al. (2021) similarly generated 
the first developmental transcriptomes of five species of Pycnogonida (sea spiders). 
Taken together, these works have reinforced the evolutionary scenario of an undu­
plicated genome in the common ancestor of Chelicerata, and whole genome duplica­
tions subtending Xiphosura and Arachnopulmonata constituting separate events. In 
addition, Ontano et al. (2021) generated similar resources for pseudoscorpions, with 
the goal of testing whether pseudoscorpions constitute derived arachnopulmonates 
(discussed below).
At the time of this writing, genomes or developmental transcriptomes are missing 
for only five chelicerate orders (one of which, Schizomida, is an arachnopulmonate; 
Figure 4.1). These datasets provide a refined understanding of the evolution of the 
Hox cluster across Arthropoda. In a comparative analysis of arthropod genomes, 
Pace et al. (2016) previously demonstrated that chelicerate and myriapod genomes 
generally tended to retain Hox genes in a single cluster, albeit with great variation 
across lineages with regard to the size of intergenic regions. With respect to che­
licerates, that study compared the genomes of I. scapularis, the scorpion Olivierus 
martensii (formerly Mesobuthus martensii), and the acariform mites T. urticae and 
Galendromus occidentalis. The Hox cluster of G. occidentalis exhibited atomization 
(sensu Duboule 2007; Hoy et al. 2016), whereas I. scapularis retained a single Hox 
cluster, albeit with large intergenic regions. T. urticae exhibited a split cluster, with 
labial and proboscipedia separated from the rest of the Hox genes. The scorpion 
O. martensii was thought to possess two Hox clusters, but this reconstruction was 
impaired by the quality of the O. martensii assembly (Cao et al. 2013).
As shown in Figure 4.2, a revised view of Hox cluster organization across 
Chelicerata with recently published datasets supports the inference that the ances­
tral arthropod and the ancestral chelicerate Hox cluster consisted of ten genes. In 

84
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
contrast to insects, wherein Hox3 has undergone sequential tandem duplication fol­
lowed by subfunctionalization, as well as neofunctionalization (i.e., the role of zen 
in dorsoventral patterning and bicoid as an anteroposterior morphogen), chelicerate 
genomes tend not to exhibit a history of ancient and shared tandem Hox duplicates 
(note that the duplications of fushi tarazu and Antennapedia in T. urticae appear to 
be lineage-specific). In systems where expression and genomic data are both avail­
able, it also has been shown that chelicerate Hox genes tend to retain temporal and 
spatial collinearity (Sharma et al. 2012, 2014b; Schwager et al. 2017).
4.4  HOX GENES IN CHELICERATE PHYLOGENOMICS
In contrast to the botanical literature, it is not common that WGD events inform 
metazoan phylogeny. In part, this is because WGD events are comparatively rare in 
Metazoa. WGD events at the base of the vertebrates and the teleosts are well under­
stood, but had little impact as arbiters of phylogenetic hypotheses, as the monophyly

Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
of groups like Vertebrata and Teleostei were historically strongly supported by both 
morphological and molecular phylogenetic datasets.
By contrast, chelicerate phylogeny remains one of the most obdurate challenges 
for phylogenomics. Despite the pursuit of chelicerate relationships with genome-
scale datasets (Regier et al. 2010; Borner et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2014a; Ballesteros 
and Sharma 2019; Ballesteros et al. 2019; Lozano-Fernández et al. 2019; Ballesteros 
et al. 2022), the backbone of Chelicerata is a de facto soft polytomy, consistent with 
an ancient rapid radiation (likely a Cambrian radiation; Lozano Fernández et al. 
2016). Further challenges to chelicerate phylogeny come in the form of multiple 
fast-evolving orders that are prone to a systematic artifact called long branch attrac­
tion (LBA), a form of statistical inconsistency wherein rapidly evolving branches are 
artificially resolved as sister groups, with stronger support for spurious relationships 
despite the addition of more genes (and particularly, rapidly evolving genes). The 
combination of an ancient rapid radiation and LBA is especially difficult to resolve 
because the genes best suited to informing higher-level chelicerate relationships 
must evolve (1) fast enough that they capture the signature of the rapid sequence 
of speciation events, but also (2) slow enough that this phylogenetic signal is not 
eroded by saturation over much of the Phanerozoic, and (3) in a manner that evolu­
tionary rates are homogeneous across all chelicerate orders, such that LBA is not 
exacerbated.
As a result, the composition of genes in a phylogenetic dataset, the substitution 
model, and the algorithmic approach all strongly affect the inference of chelicerate 
relationships (Sharma et al. 2014a). Chelicerate phylogeny is contentious, with histori­
cal and recent molecular matrices disputing the status of arachnid monophyly, due to 
the nested placement of Xiphosura within the arachnids (Wheeler and Hayashi 1998; 
Giribet et al. 2002; Ballesteros and Sharma 2019). It was previously shown that genes 
supporting arachnid monophyly are in the minority across phylogenetic datasets and 
these genes do not exhibit statistically better properties (e.g., saturation rate; taxon 
occupancy; compositional heterogeneity) than genes recovering horseshoe crabs as 
derived arachnids (Sharma et al. 2014a; Ballesteros and Sharma 2019). By contrast, 
Lozano-Fernández et al. (2019) discovered a matrix supporting arachnid monophyly 
when analyzed under a particular approach, but this result was sensitive to model, 
taxon, and matrix choice. One of the shortcomings of these previous works was that 
they lacked representation of all extant chelicerate orders, namely, miniaturized groups 
like palpigrades and schizomids. These taxa were sequentially added to phylogenomic 
matrices in later works (e.g., Ballesteros et al. 2019; Howard et al. 2020). However, 
the recovery of arachnid monophyly remained contentious, with some works unable 
to recover this relationship altogether (e.g., Ballesteros et al. 2019; Noah et al. 2020; 
Ontano et al. 2021; Ballesteros et al. 2022; Ban et al. 2022) and others able to recover 
it only with certain models and upon excluding some arachnid orders (e.g., Howard 
et al. 2020). While the monophyly of Arachnida continues to be widely accepted in 
the literature, the most comprehensive phylogenetic datasets of Chelicerata to date 
have been unable to recover this relationship and have observed little evidence that 
arachnid non-monophyly is attributable to an artifact (Ballesteros et al. 2022). Apart 
from the monophyly of Chelicerata, Euchelicerata (the non-Pycnogonida chelicerates), 
Tetrapulmonata (spiders and four other arachnid orders that plesiomorphically bear 

86
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
four book lungs), and relationships within the tetrapulmonates, few higher-level nodes 
in the chelicerate tree of life have been satisfactorily resolved.
Given these disputes and the inherent recalcitrance of the basal phylogeny of 
chelicerates in the phylogenomic era, it may be surprising that any further prog­
ress has been made in chelicerate phylogeny. Nevertheless, Hox (and other devel­
opmental patterning) genes have played a central role in resolving two additional 
nodes within Chelicerata. The first phylogenomic analyses of chelicerates recov­
ered the sister group relationship of Scorpiones + Tetrapulmonata with strong sup­
port (Regier et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2014a). This clade, Arachnopulmonata (sensu 
Sharma et al. 2014a), was united by the presence of book lungs (eight book lungs 
occur in scorpions). This relationship was initially considered counterintuitive, given 
the historical interpretation that scorpions were the sister group of the remaining 
arachnids (Weygoldt and Paulus 1979; but see Shultz 1990, 2007). The discovery of 
duplicated Hox genes in scorpions as well as spiders, together with Hox expression 
data, strongly suggested a shared rare genomic change uniting these taxa (Schwager 
et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2014b), to the exclusion of groups like mites and harvest­
men (Telford and Thomas 1998; Sharma et al. 2012). This paralogy was shown to 
be systemic, affecting the rest of the homeobox family, as well as miRNA families 
(Leite et al. 2016, 2018). The extent of this shared rare genomic change was revealed 
through the genomes of the model spider P. tepidariorum and scorpion C. sculptu­
ratus (Schwager et al. 2017). Additional expression data and gene tree analyses from 
non-Hox homeobox genes (e.g., extradenticle, homothorax) from spider, scorpion, 
and harvestman exemplars supported the inference of a systemic duplication, fol­
lowed by ancient subdivision of spatiotemporal domains (Pechmann and Prpic 2009; 
Turetzek et al. 2017; Nolan et al. 2020). Taken together, the systemic evidence of the 
shared genome duplication served as a complex phylogenetic meta-character, poten­
tially consisting of hundreds or thousands of synapomorphies; postulating parallel or 
convergent acquisition of these genomic and developmental traits in tetrapulmonates 
and scorpions became an untenable position.
Drawing upon this approach, Ontano et al. (2021) reexamined the position of 
Pseudoscorpiones, one of three fast-evolving arachnid orders that are highly prone 
to LBA. Across phylogenomic datasets, pseudoscorpions typically clustered with 
Acariformes or Parasitiformes, another pair of long-branch orders (Figure 4.3). 
However, certain subsets of phylogenomic matrices, especially those filtered for 
slowly evolving genes, would recover pseudoscorpions within Arachnopulmonata, 
as the sister group to scorpions (Figure 4.3). Reasoning that a placement within 
Arachnopulmonata would be evidenced by the signature of whole genome dupli­
cation, Ontano et al. (2021) generated the first developmental transcriptome and 
draft genome for Pseudoscorpiones and examined these for the retention of ancient 
paralogs. To these surveys, they added the first developmental transcriptomes for 
Pycnogonida (Ballesteros et  al. 2021a), Amblypygi (Gainett and Sharma 2020; 
Gainett et al. 2020), and a mygalomorph spider (Setton et al. 2019). Consistent with 
the placement of pseudoscorpions within Arachnopulmonata, Ontano et al. (2021) 
discovered in the developmental transcriptome of the species Conicochernes 
crassus (1) two paralogs of every Hox gene except for Hox3 (Figure 4.3), (2) reten­
tion of 40% of homeobox gene duplicates that were shared with at least one other 

FIGURE 4.3  Hox gene duplications as rare genomic characters in chelicerate phylogeny.

arachnopulmonate order, and (3) retention of duplicates of all leg-patterning 
genes with known arachnopulmonate-specific division of spatiotemporal expres­
sion patterns (Turetzek et al. 2017; Nolan et al. 2020). These inferences of shared 
duplication were substantiated by the topologies of gene trees, particularly of 
leg-patterning genes. Despite the degree of fragmentation of the draft genome 
of Cordylochernes scorpioides, Ontano et al. (2021) also discovered the retention 
of duplicated miRNA families previously shown to be duplicated in spiders and 
scorpions (Leite et  al. 2016), further supporting the inference that pseudoscor­
pions ­constitute derived arachnopulmonates. Intriguingly, phylogenomic analy­
ses conducted by Ontano et al. (2021) showed that the clade Pseudoscorpiones + 
Scorpiones could be consistently recovered by traditional molecular matrices, 
but only if pseudoscorpions were densely sampled (effectively, breaking the long 
branch subtending this order).
The work of Ontano et al. (2021) was able to leverage Hox gene duplications 
(a de facto readout of whole genome duplication) as an arbiter of phylogenetic place­
ment, resolving a relationship that traditional phylogenomic methods could not 
redress conclusively. While such uses of partial or whole genome duplication are 
well known in botanical and mycological phylogenomics (e.g., Salichos and Rokas 
2013; Leebens-Mack et al. 2019), they are rarer in the metazoan literature, due to 
the comparative scarcity of WGD events in Metazoa. Notably, an unusual change 
in the sequence of Hox6 (fushi tarazu) was similarly used to argue for the place­
ment of chaetognaths, another enigmatic taxon, within Gnathifera (Fröbius and 
Funch 2017), with subsequent validation from phylogenomic analyses (Marlétaz 
et al. 2019).
The utility of Hox gene duplications as phylogenetic characters in Chelicerata 
may not yet be fully expended. It is generally presumed that the shared whole 
genome duplication initially identified in spiders and scorpions is restricted to 
Arachnopulmonata (i.e., the common ancestor of these two orders). This is sub­
stantiated by the absence of systemic paralogy (e.g., duplicated Hox clusters) in 
Acariformes (Grbic et al. 2011), Parasitiformes (Pagel Van Zee et al. 2007; Hoy 
et al. 2016; Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016), and most recently, the first Opiliones genome 
(Gainett et al. 2021). In fact, it is entirely possible that the putative “arachnopulmo­
nate duplication” occurred more deeply in the tree. Currently, developmental tran­
scriptomes and genomes are missing for the arachnid orders Solifugae (sun spiders), 
Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders), and Palpigradi (microw hip scorpions)—all three 
of which exhibit unstable phylogenomic placements (Ballesteros and Sharma 2019; 
Ballesteros et al. 2019; Ballesteros et al. 2022). The hypothetical discovery of shared 
genome duplication between arachnopulmonates and any of these poorly studied 
trio of orders would similarly affix them as part of a strongly supported clade in the 
chelicerate tree of life. Given that some phylogenomic analyses consistently recover 
Ricinulei as the sister group of horseshoe crabs (which exhibit their own indepen­
dent whole genome duplication events), developmental transcriptomes and genomes 
for this order are of especially high priority for higher-level chelicerate phylogeny. 
Specifically, the hypothetical discovery of rare genomic changes uniting Ricinulei 
(or other arachnid orders) with Xiphosura would effectively sound the death knell of 
the Arachnida concept.

Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
4.5  IMPACT OF GENE DUPLICATIONS ON 
DIVERSIFICATION DYNAMICS
The evolutionary significance of whole genome duplications is that a swath of new 
genes and modules (e.g., Hox genes; MADS-Box genes) is thought to provide new 
potential for diversification—either in terms of speciation or complexity of body 
plans and gene regulatory networks (Ohno 1970; Wagner 1994; Taylor and Raes 2004; 
Magadum et al. 2013). The majority of genes is typically lost after a whole genome 
duplication, with the probability of gene loss estimated around 80% in vertebrate 
genomes (Dehal and Boore 2005; Pasquier et al. 2017). However, a subset of retained 
duplicated genes can undergo subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, in addi­
tion to simply being retained as two “similar” copies (Lynch and Conery 2000). As 
a result, gene family expansions and genome duplications are associated with evolv­
ability (Holland et al. 1994; Conant and Wagner 2003; Wagner et al. 2003; Irish 
and Litt 2005) and increased rates of evolution via the unlocking of developmental 
innovations (Irish 2003; Fried et al. 2004; Wagner et al. 2005; Pasquier et al. 2017).
Despite the intuitive logical bridge between genome duplication and evolvability, a 
clear link between gene duplication and diversification (either of species-level diver­
sity or of morphology) has not been well established. Much of the debate concern­
ing this correlation has focused on the vertebrate and angiosperm literature (Meyer 
and Schartl 1999; Zhou et al. 2001; Donoghue and Purnell 2005; Crow and Wagner 
2006). Teleost fishes exhibit the highest proportion of species-level diversity within 
the vertebrates, concomitant with a cumulative three-fold whole genome duplica­
tion (Crow et al. 2005). However, as a group, vertebrates are greatly outnumbered 
by lineages with single Hox clusters, such as nematodes and insects. Outgroups to 
vertebrates, such as echinoderms or mollusks, exhibit much greater disparity of 
body plans and no dearth of morphological innovations (Crow and Wagner 2006). 
Moreover, at a more granular level, the impact of gene family expansion on diver­
sification rate is not always intuitive, even in the case of gene families thought to 
bear directly upon the ecological success of organisms. As an example, it was previ­
ously thought that recent expansion of neurotoxins in Conus snails, together with 
diversifying selection, had facilitated the rapid diversification of this group (Duda 
and Palumbi 1999). However, a recent investigation of Conus venom complexity 
showed no clear statistical association between toxin gene diversity and speciation 
rate (Phuong et al. 2019). By contrast, in plants, multiple episodes of polyploidization 
have been identified across the angiosperm tree of life (Soltis and Soltis 1999; Soltis 
et al. 2009), and it has long been thought that there is a positive association between 
species richness and incidence of polyploidy (Otto and Whitton 2000; Vamosi and 
Dickinson 2006; Walden et al. 2020; but see Wood et al. 2009; Mayrose et al. 2011). 
Crow and Wagner (2006) proposed that heightened net diversification rates in the 
wake of an angiosperm whole genome duplication may reflect different mechanisms 
that reduce risks of lineage extinction, such as functional redundancy of gene copies, 
robustness to deleterious mutations, and increased potential for adaptation.
The identification of multiple whole genome duplication events in Chelicerata 
offers badly needed data points within Metazoa for understanding the impact of gene 
duplication on net diversification rate. Described species richness in Chelicerata is 

90

strongly asymmetrical, with the largest orders (Araneae; Acariformes) dwarfing the 
smallest (Xiphosura; four extant species) by four orders of magnitude (Figure 4.1). 
Comparison of these lineages’ extant species richness immediately disfavors the 
interpretation that whole genome duplication is causally linked to speciation rate or 
morphological disparity; horseshoe crabs, despite a likely threefold whole genome 
duplication, are the epitome of low net diversification rate, high lineage turnover, 
and external morphological stasis. The relatively recent estimated age of at least 
one of the Xiphosura duplications (Cretaceous; Obst et al. 2012), as compared to 
the arachnopulmonate duplication event (pre-Silurian; Schwager et al. 2017), does 
not mitigate this observation; the horseshoe crab genome duplications are older 
than most of the angiosperm whole genome duplication events, giving this relictual 
arthropod lineage sufficient time for morphological innovation after rapid accrual 
of new genes. The fossil record also discourages extending to Xiphosura the mecha­
nisms for lowered extinction rate proposed by Crow and Wagner (2006); fossils of 
Xiphosura show that this lineage included a large number of species and genera 
since their appearance in the Ordovician, but this record does not support a post-
Mesozoic increase in net diversification rate.
Within the terrestrial chelicerates, the correlation between species richness and 
a history of whole genome duplication (i.e., membership in the clade Arachno­
pulmonata) buckles further. Spiders (ca. 50,000 spp.) are slightly more diverse 
than acariform mites (ca. 42,000 spp.) with respect to the number of described spe­
cies (Zhang 2013), but it is likely that the true diversity of Acariformes is much 
greater. Within arachnopulmonates, three smaller orders (Amblypygi, Uropygi, 
and Schizomida) each include fewer than 300 species, whereas pseudoscorpions 
(ca. 4,000 spp.) and scorpions (ca. 2,400 spp.) are comparatively larger groups. Outside 
of arachnopulmonates, diverse orders include the aforementioned Acariformes as 
well as Parasitiformes (ca. 15,000 spp.) and Opiliones (ca. 7,000 spp.). But the apul­
monate arachnids also include taxa like Palpigradi and Ricinulei, small orders with 
less than 100 described species. These patterns suggest no clear correlation between 
whole genome duplications and extant diversity.
The link between whole genome duplication and body plan disparity (and/or com­
plexity) is also disfavored by macroevolutionary patterns within Chelicerata. Spiders 
exhibit marked body plan disparity and an array of evolutionary innovations that are 
anatomical, biochemical, and behavioral (e.g., venoms; silks; web morphology). But the 
body plan disparity of mites is no less complex, with specific reference to their mouth­
parts, cuticular ornamentation, and appendage modifications (Evans 1992). Inversely, 
arachnopulmonate groups like Amblypygi and Uropygi exhibit conserved patterns of 
morphological evolution (without major differences in body plan organization across 
families), whereas Opiliones exemplify comparatively greater body plan disparity, 
with constituent lineages exhibiting remarkable modifications of specific appendage 
pairs, patterns of dorsal sclerotization, and a plethora of sexually dimorphic traits.
What impact, then, did Hox gene duplication have on the evolution of Arachno­
pulmonata? In the case of posterior patterning of scorpions, Sharma et al. (2014b) con­
tended that the duplication of Hox genes and their subsequent subfunctionalization 
was essential to establishing the heteronomous segmentation and novel appendage 
identities of the scorpion opisthosoma. This hypothesis, while consistent with the 
expression patterns of scorpion posterior Hox genes, cannot be tested further at

Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
present due to the lack of functional tools in C. sculpturatus. Intriguingly, a compara­
ble set of expression dynamics, as shown in Figure 4.4, occurs during embryogenesis 
in P. tepidariorum, with each of the 19 Hox genes exhibiting unique spatiotemporal 
domain boundaries (Schwager et al. 2017). As a result, a unique combination of Hox 
transcripts occurs in the first five opisthosomal segments, which consist of the pedi­
cel (the reduced stalk-like segment connecting the prosoma to the opisthosoma), the 
first and second pairs of respiratory organs, and the first and second pairs of spin­
nerets. One possibility is that the differentiation of the spinnerets, which vary widely 
in structure, number, and arrangement across the spider tree of life, was a key step to 
unlocking the evolutionary potential of this highly successful group of chelicerates. 
Specifically, duplicates of the Hox genes Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A, whose 
anterior boundaries span the second through the fifth opisthosomal segments, must 
be investigated functionally in the context of spinneret-bearing segment fate speci­
fication. Such an investigation is imperative for linking the evolutionary origins of 
spiders with the deployment of duplicated Hox genes. As a corollary, the expression 
patterns of these genes must also be investigated in tetrapulmonates like Uropygi 
and Amblypygi, which bear respiratory organs on the same segments as spiders, 
but lack paired ventral organs on the remaining posterior segments. The establish­
ment of the first developmental genetic resources for a whip spider species proffers 
a ready avenue for such a comparative investigation (Gainett and Sharma 2020). 
Overall, a revitalized and concerted effort to understand the functions of every Hox 
gene of model species like P. tepidariorum and P. opilio is sorely needed. Such 
FIGURE 4.4  Hox gene duplications correlate with complexity (heteronomous segmenta­
tion) of the chelicerate opisthosoma (the posterior tagma). References provided in text.

an effort is imperative for testing hypotheses about the role of sub-/neofunctional­
ized Hox gene duplicates as drivers of developmental and body plan innovations in 
Arachnopulmonata.
4.6  STUDIES OF HOX FUNCTION IN CHELICERATA
Within arthropods, broad understanding of Hox cluster architecture, gene func­
tion, and regulation is largely informed by datasets from insects (e.g., Lewis 1978; 
McGinnis et al. 1984; Merrill et al. 1987, 1989; Brown et al. 2002; Angelini et al. 
2005; Shippy et al. 2008) and the crustacean model Parhyale hawaiensis (Liubicich 
et  al. 2009; Pavlopoulos et  al. 2009; Martin et  al. 2016). By contrast, functional 
data are comparatively limited in chelicerates and altogether nonexistent for 
Myriapoda. A seminal work in the chelicerate Hox literature first addressed the role 
of Antennapedia (Antp) in patterning opisthosomal identity in the spider P. tepidari­
orum. Khadjeh et al. (2012) showed that knockdown of Antp (via maternal RNA 
interference [RNAi]) resulted in an ectopic appendage pair on the first opisthosomal 
segment (the pedicel), whereas double-knockdown of Antp and Ultrabithorax (Ubx) 
resulted in ectopic appendages on both the first and second opisthosomal segments 
(with the latter bearing a small, rudimentary appendage bud). These ectopic append­
ages expressed both Deformed (Dfd) and Sex combs reduced (Scr), which are associ­
ated with the walking legs in wild type spider embryos; these results suggested that 
Antp and Ubx suppressed the expression of prosomal Hox genes in the opisthosoma. 
Khadjeh et al. (2012) concluded that the function of spider Antp reflected convergence 
with respect to the function of insect Ubx (i.e., repressing appendages on posterior 
segments). While a triple knockdown of Antp, Ubx, and abdA was trialed, this experi­
ment did not yield a phenotype discernible from the Antp+Ubx double knockdown.
At the time, the scale of Hox gene duplications was not known in P. tepidar­
iorum; a previous work had reported the duplication of some Hox genes, but not 
Antp (Abzhanov et al. 1999). The Hox genes analyzed by Khadjeh et al. (2012) cor­
responded to the “-A” copies designated by Schwager et al. (2017). It is presently 
unknown how knockdown of Antp-A affected its paralog (Antp-B), as well as Dfd-B 
and Scr-B. Subsequently, Pechmann et al. (2015) showed that knockdown of labial-1 
(lab-A, sensu Schwager et al. 2017) resulted in the loss of the pedipalps and first 
walking leg, and the diminution of those appendages’ segments. At the time of that 
study, the existence and expression pattern of the lab-2 paralog was known, but 
RNAi against lab-2 did not result in a phenotype. Moreover, knockdown of lab-1 
did not abrogate the expression of lab-2 or Dfd in the walking leg segments. In that 
same work, Pechmann et al. (2015) showed that knockdown of Dfd (Dfd-A, sensu 
Schwager et al. 2017) resulted in the homeotic transformation of the first walking 
leg into pedipalpal identity, with corresponding ectopic expression of lab-1 in the 
transformed first walking leg. Pechmann et al. (2015) interpreted these data to mean 
that lab-1 was necessary for tissue development in the pedipalpal and first walk­
ing leg segments, as well as for establishing pedipalpal fate. Curiously, no homeotic 
pedipalp-to-chelicera transformations were recovered in the phenotypic spectrum for 
lab-1. Pechmann et al. (2015) suggested that these data closely paralleled the dynam­
ics of lab in the fruit fly D. melanogaster, wherein lab mutants exhibit defects in head 

93
Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
involution during embryogenesis, but not homeosis (Merrill et al. 1989); homeotic 
transformations are only observed in the posterior adult head of the fruit fly for a 
subset of hypomorphic lab alleles. By contrast, in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus 
fasciatus, neither maternal nor embryonic RNAi against lab resulted in a phenotype. 
Pechmann et al. (2015) postulated that a homeotic function for lab in the chelicerate 
head may occur later in embryogenesis, but this observation could not be tested due 
to embryonic lethality incurred by lab-1 knockdown in developing spiders.
To date, these two works remain the only published studies of Hox function in 
spiders. Knockdowns of P. tepidariorum Dfd-B, pb, and Scr have been trialed in 
unpublished experiments, but resulted in no phenotypes (M. Pechmann, personal 
communication). I previously attempted to knockdown the P. tepidariorum paralogs 
of Abdominal-B (both individually and targeting the two copies simultaneously), 
but these experiments similarly yielded no phenotypes, either in my hands or in a 
colleague’s (E.E. Schwager, personal communication). Thus, of the 19 Hox genes of 
P. tepidariorum, functional data are only available for four.
Part of the difficulty may be related to the penetrance of RNAi via maternal 
injection of double-stranded RNA in P. tepidariorum. It is generally known that 
numerous candidate genes will frequently not yield discernible loss-of-function phe­
notypes in this species, with estimates of knockdown success ranging from 5% to 
20% across experimental screens (Y. Akiyama-Oda and H. Oda, personal commu­
nication; M. Pechmann, personal communication; E.E. Schwager, personal com­
munication). Genes that are strongly maternally expressed are thought to be more 
resistant to knockdown, as are genes that exhibit consistently high expression levels 
late in embryogenesis (Pechmann et al. 2011; N.M. Prpic-Schäper, personal communi­
cation), whereas one research team that has pioneered the understanding of chelicerate 
appendage development has experienced greater success with RNAi (~80% of genes 
yielding discernible phenotypes; N.M. Prpic-Schäper, personal communication). 
Embryonic injection is feasible in P. tepidariorum, but is technically challenging, 
with typical experiments exhibiting lower rates of penetrance than successful mater­
nal injections (e.g., Pechmann et al. 2011). For genes that retain their duplicates, it is 
also possible that knockdown of one paralog is rescued by the compensatory function 
of the other (or that the two copies exert combinatorial effects), though few empirical 
cases of this phenomenon have been published in chelicerates (Benton et al. 2016).
The recently established harvestman model system P. opilio offers a chelicerate 
exemplar with an unduplicated genome and the ancestral complement of ten Hox 
genes. Notably, whereas the walking legs of P. tepidariorum are morphologically 
very similar at the completion of embryogenesis, individual leg pairs of P. opilio are 
distinguished from one another by their relative lengths and the unique number of 
tarsomeres (subdivisions of the last leg segment) of each leg pair. Gainett et al. (2021) 
recently leveraged these features of harvestman biology to address the functions of 
Dfd and Scr via embryonic RNAi. They found that knockdown of Dfd resulted in 
homeotic transformations of the first and second walking legs to pedipalpal identity. 
This contrasts with the function of spider Dfd-A, which only affects the first walking 
leg (Pechmann et al. 2011). The discrepancy may reflect subfunctionalization of the 
two spider Dfd copies, although a test of this hypothesis via double knockdown of 
Dfd-A and Dfd-B has not yet been performed to my knowledge.

94
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Gainett et al. (2021) also found that knockdown of harvestman Scr had no dis­
cernible impact on prosomal patterning. To test for the possibility of functional 
redundancy with Dfd, they performed a double knockdown of both Dfd and Scr. This 
experiment resulted in homeotic transformation of the first three walking leg pairs 
into pedipalpal identity, suggesting that both Dfd and Scr are necessary for the speci­
fication of third walking leg identity in chelicerates. These dynamics closely parallel 
the functional redundancy of other pairs of adjacent Hox genes in arthropods (e.g., 
Ubx and abdA in suppressing appendage identity in the insect abdomen; Antp-A and 
Ubx-A in suppressing appendage identity in the spider opisthosoma; Angelini and 
Kaufman 2005; Khadjeh et al. 2012).
Outside of these few data points (Figure 4.5), studies on the function of chelicer­
ate Hox genes remain unexplored. Capitalizing upon the advent of CRISPR-Cas9-
mediated mutagenesis in mites (Dermauw et al. 2020) and ticks (Sharma et al. 2022), 
FIGURE 4.5  Summary of Hox RNAi experiments in Chelicerata and known regulatory 
interactions (right of corresponding experiment). While expression domains of prosomal Hox 
genes are shown for reference, note that no functional data exist for chelicerate homologs of pb, 
Hox3, or ftz. Purple icons indicate structures affected by homeosis. References provided in text.

95
Duplication and Evolution of Hox Clusters in Chelicerata (Arthropoda)
Sharma et al. (2022) recently trialed knockouts of pb, Antp, and the leg pattern­
ing gene dachshund in I. scapularis. Oddly, while on-target mutagenesis of these 
target genes was demonstrated through genotyping by sequencing, dac and Antp 
mutants of I. scapularis exhibited no morphological phenotypes. For the pb experi­
ment, Sharma et al. (2022) reported that a small number of mutant ticks exhibited an 
enlarged hypostome (cheliceral complex). This phenotype is unexpected and counter­
intuitive because arthropod Hox genes are not expressed in the deutocerebral segment 
(the chelicera-bearing segment) in early development (Damen et al. 1998; Telford and 
Thomas 1998; Jager et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2012). Neither the absence of pheno­
types in the Antp and dac experiments, nor the effect of pb knockout on the chelicerae, 
are easily explained in this study. One possibility is that the categorization of the phe­
notypic spectrum may have been impacted by the decision to score these experiments 
only at hatching; it is possible that Sharma et al. (2022) did not observe a considerable 
portion of knockout phenotypes that led to embryonic lethality. As examples, severe 
RNAi phenotypes of lab-1 in the spider, or of the Hox co-factor homothorax, do not 
survive to hatching at all (Pechmann et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2015).
Regardless, future studies must endeavor to fill in the gaps in the knowledge of 
chelicerate Hox function, as a prerequisite to understanding gene regulation, espe­
cially in groups with duplicated Hox clusters. The condition of single-copy Hox 
genes in the harvestman, together with the high rate of penetrance of embryonic 
RNAi in P. opilio (80% of trialed genes, across experiments), makes this system a 
promising platform for illuminating the Hox logic of the chelicerate body plan, as 
well as examining the regulatory architecture of chelicerate Hox genes that retain 
the ancestral unduplicated condition.
4.7  CONCLUSION
The field of chelicerate evo-devo and phylogenomics, and the attendant understand­
ing of Hox cluster evolution in this lineage, is quintessentially a celebration of the 
power of genomics and modern sequencing approaches. The present proliferation 
of ultra-long read sequencing technologies heralds the beginning of taxonomically 
comprehensive comparative genomic approaches to understanding Hox cluster evo­
lution in this curious and ancient group of animals (e.g., Sánchez-Herrero et al. 2019; 
Fan et al. 2021). Such approaches break the impasse imposed by small-bodied, rare, 
and/or cryptic chelicerate groups like Ricinulei, Palpigradi, and a broad swath of 
acariform and parasitiform mite families, for which obtaining cDNA or develop­
mental transcriptomes from embryos is improbable or practically unfeasible. Beyond 
informing the evolution of Hox clusters and gene families, a broader genomic rep­
resentation for Chelicerata holds the potential for providing new sources of phy­
logenetic characters. Rare genomic changes such as WGD events, shared tandem 
duplications and gene family expansions, and acquisition of microRNAs may adju­
dicate between competing hypotheses at the base of the euchelicerate radiation (i.e., 
the relationships of Xiphosura and the apulmonate arachnid orders), which consti­
tutes one of the most recalcitrant soft polytomies in the metazoan tree of life.
Yet, advances in genomics must be paralleled by concomitant developments 
in functional genetics and expansion of toolkits in chelicerate emerging model

organisms. The recent advent of Cas9-mediated gene editing in a mite and a 
tick model are promising developments for chelicerate evo-devo. Adapting such 
approaches may circumvent limits to phenotypic penetrance and knockdown effi­
ciency posed by dsRNA-mediated RNA interference in the spider P. tepidariorum. 
A high-value target for future research efforts remains an understanding of regula­
tory interactions between Hox genes of the same cluster versus regulation across 
clusters in groups like spiders and scorpions.
The discovery of the chelicerate WGD events, together with the establishment 
of new emerging model organisms and the proliferation of genomic and functional 
resources in the decade since the first chelicerate genome (Grbic et al. 2011), bespeak 
an ideal study system for deciphering the genetic and evolutionary consequences of 
gene duplications in a variety of developmental contexts. It is all the more propitious 
that the age of the arachnopulmonate duplication is approximately equal to those 
at the base of the vertebrate tree; future comparisons of chelicerate and vertebrate 
genomic and functional datasets may lead to further insights and emergent patterns 
of the consequences of metazoan WGD events. Taken together, the next decade of 
revitalized research on the comparative development, genomics, and functional 
genetics of Chelicerata will likely be one of transformative insights that stem from a 
once poorly-studied group of arthropods.

5.1  INTRODUCTION: CAN A SINGLE SPECIES REPRESENT 
THE WHOLE CHONDRICHTHYES?
In the vertebrate taxonomy, sharks (Selachimorpha) and rays (Batoidea) are cat­
egorized into the subclass Elasmobranchii in the vertebrate class Chondrichthyes 
(Figure 5.1) (Naylor et al., 2012; Nelson, 2006). The other subclass in the class

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Chondrichthyes is Holocephali, including chimaeras and ratfishes. Molecular 
phylogenetics has shown that the class Chondrichthyes is a monophyletic group 
(Kikugawa et al., 2004), which substantiates the importance of studying this group, 
as a complement to all of the knowledge that has been gained from ray-finned fishes 
(Actinopterygii) in their separate evolutionary lineage. The significance of study-
ing chondrichthyans is doubled by a key genomic feature―chondrichthyans seem to 
have undergone no additional whole genome duplication (WGD), unlike some teleost 
fish lineages (Van de Peer et al., 2009). Another advantage of studying chondrich-
thyans is their relatively slow evolution at the molecular level, which was initially 
suggested for mitochondrial genome sequences (Martin et al., 1992), but has now 
been shown to apply to nuclear genomes as well (Hara et al., 2018).
The class Chondrichthyes contains more than 500 shark species and more than 
700 rays, skates, and torpedoes, while the class Holocephali contains only about 
50 species. The divergence times for the Holocephali-Chondrichthyes split and for 
the shark-ray split trace back to more than 400 and 300 million years ago, respec-
tively (Irisarri et  al., 2017; Renz et  al., 2013). The antiquity of their divergence 
demands a careful assessment of molecular traits, which is expected to be covered 
by multiple chondrichthyan species. Most of the developmental studies conducted so 
far on chondrichthyan species encompassed a single species, mainly because of low

accessibility to species with high fecundity. Taking these factors into consideration, 
this chapter will focus on expected and unexpected features of shark and ray Hox 
clusters revealed to date.
5.2  CHONDRICHTHYAN HOX GENES IDENTIFIED 
BEFORE WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING
Early studies on chondrichthyan Hox genes were based mostly on the screening 
and sequencing of DNA clones in genomic libraries (PAC or BAC) (also see Kim 
et al., 2003). The first documented attempt was on the horn shark Heterodontus 
francisci (Figure 5.1), which revealed two clusters of Hox genes, designated Hox M 
and N (Kim et al., 2000). These two horn shark Hox clusters later turned out to be 
orthologous to Hox A and D clusters, respectively (Prohaska et al., 2004). The Hox 
A cluster was also sequenced for a batoid species, the little skate Leucoraja erina­
cea (Figure 5.1) (Mulley et al., 2009). In the Batoidea, egg-laying species that allow 
us to perform repeated developmental analysis occur only in the order Rajiformes 
(Figure 5.1), and above all, L. erinacea is one of the extremely limited number of 
species that can be maintained in a research facility. It was not until Oulion et al. 
reported a comprehensive study on the small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula 
(Figure 5.1) in 2010 that the entire picture of Hox cluster organization (except the 
Hox C cluster―see below) in an elasmobranch species was unveiled by exhaustive 
BAC clone sequencing (Oulion et al., 2010).
5.3  HOX CLUSTER ORGANIZATION REVEALED 
BY WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING
Chondrichthyans have been one of the vertebrate classes with the smallest amount 
of information from whole genome sequencing, which was mainly caused by large 
genome sizes as well as inaccessibility of fresh samples, as mentioned above. 
Venkatesh et al. circumvented this obstacle by focusing on a species with a rela­
tively small genome size (1.9 Gb), the elephant fish (also called ‘elephant shark’ even 
though this species is not included in the group of true sharks), Callorhinchus milii 
(Figure 5.1) (Venkatesh et al., 2005, 2007)―some elasmobranchs have much larger 
genomes of more than 10 Gb (reviewed in Yamaguchi et al., 2021). In parallel with 
whole genome sequencing, Ravi et al. reported the four Hox clusters of this species 
based on BAC clone sequencing with the support of genome sequencing (Ravi et al., 
2009). Even after this species opened up the realm of genome-scale chondrichthyan 
study, subsequent attempts on other chondrichthyan species did not yield sufficient 
completeness of genome sequences (Read et al., 2017; Wyffels et al., 2014), thus 
obstructing concrete progress on Hox gene identification. Later, in 2018 Hara et al. 
reported a whole-genome investigation of three shark species, the cloudy catshark 
Scyliorhinus torazame, the brownbanded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum, 
and the whale shark Rhincodon typus, supplemented with transcriptome data of the 
zebra bullhead shark Heterodontus zebra and the ocellate spot skate Okamejei keno­
jei (Figure 5.1) (Hara et al., 2018). Genomic sequence resources have kept increas­
ing with more species being sampled, including the white shark Carcharodon 

106

carcharias (Marra et al., 2019) and the thorny skate Amblyraja radiata (Figure 5.1; 
Rhie et al., 2021).
Whole genome sequencing itself does not yield readily interpretable annotation 
of individual Hox genes as well as all other genes, and careful validation of gene 
identification is required, with the support of transcripts and cross-species homol-
ogy. In fact, the Hox clusters are conventionally recognized as genomic regions 
that are typically amongst the ten most deeply sequenced and easily assembled in 
short-read-based whole genome sequencing. Interestingly, as for elasmobranchs, 
this applies to Hox A, B, and D clusters described here, but not to the Hox C cluster 
that is detailed later.
5.4  HOX A, B, AND D CLUSTERS
For the Hox A, B, and D gene repertoires, there is no variation reported to date 
among the chondrichthyan species, even when the species with partial information 
are taken into consideration (Figure 5.2), such as the little skate L. erinacea and the 
horn shark H. francisci (Figure 5.1). The high similarity of Hox gene repertoires 
FIGURE 5.2  Summary of gene repertoires in chondrichthyan Hox clusters. (A) Conservation 
in the chondrichthyan lineage. For the elasmobranch Hox C cluster, a hypothetical organization 
of the elasmobranch ancestor is shown based on the information in (B). See Kuraku and Meyer 
(2009) for the inference of the ancestral chondrichthyans that takes non-­chondrichthyan lineages 
into account. (B) Hox C gene repertoire. (This figure panel was modified from Kuraku, 2021.)

107
Structural Constraints in Hox Clusters
among chondrichthyans contrasts with the substantial differences between human 
and coelacanth (with a comparable divergence time to deep chondrichthyan diver­
gences) of four genes (A14, B10, C1, and C3 that are retained in the coelacanth 
genome but absent in the human genome). The identical gene organization suggests 
its early establishment and long-term preservation with high constraint during chon­
drichthyan evolution.
Apart from simple gene repertoire comparison, genomic architecture of elasmo­
branch Hox clusters suggested the early establishment of some structural features 
comparable to those previously documented in mammalian Hox clusters. First, the 
lengths of the Hox clusters are nearly 100 Kbp as in C. milii and many other verte­
brates (reviewed in Kuraku, 2021). Second, the interval between HoxB13 and HoxB10 
is large at close to 100 Kbp in these elasmobranch species (Figure 5.3). This large 
distance between HoxB10-13 was originally observed in mammals, which delayed the 
discovery of HoxB13 (Zeltser et al., 1996). Also, available shark genome sequences 
consistently show the proximity of the Lunapark locus to the Hox D cluster as well as 
the absence of non-Hox protein-coding genes in the long stretch flanking the Hox A 
cluster (Figure 5.3).
The early establishment of the structural features of the Hox clusters is also found 
in the genomic signature of their epigenomic regulation. In diverse metazoans, the 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) that contains the C2H2 Zn finger-type DNA-binding 
domains plays a pivotal role in chromatin organization as an insulator. Previously, 
the binding landscape of the insulator protein CTCF in the Hox gene clusters was 
explored with a reference to vertebrate phylogeny (Kadota et al., 2017). In these 
FIGURE 5.3  Whale shark Hox cluster organization. Coding exons of Hox genes are shown 
with colored boxes, while those of non-Hox genes are shown in gray. Entire genomic scaf­
folds are shown when the scaffold sequences are shorter than 400 Kbp, while only a part of 
the scaffold containing the full Hox cluster and several neighboring genes is shown when its 
sequence is longer than 400 Kbp. Regions filled with undetermined bases (‘N’) and those 
covered by repetitive elements are shown below the horizontal line. This figure was modified 
from Hara et al. (2018), and the equivalent figures for the bamboo shark and cloudy catshark 
are also found in this literature.

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
studies, CTCF binding sites, particularly the one between HoxA5 and HoxA6, were 
shown to play crucial roles in conformational regulation of Hox gene expression 
(Narendra et al., 2015, 2016). Interestingly, there are few CTCF binding sites with 
conspicuous peaks in the HoxA1-A5 region in the amniote samples, whereas the 
lamprey Hox clusters were revealed to possess more prominent peaks within the 
Hox clusters, including this genomic region (Kadota et al., 2017). This difference 
would explain the possible distinction in global regulation of Hox clusters (Acemel 
et al., 2016) between the lamprey (with elongated Hox clusters harboring abundant 
repetitive elements) and amniotes (with <100 Kbp–long, compressed Hox clusters 
harboring few repeats) (Kadota et al., 2017).
To investigate which of the two distinct types of chondrichthyans are classified 
(i.e., lamprey-like or amniote-like), ChIP-seq was employed for profiling CTCF 
binding in the bamboo shark and the cloudy catshark, using a cross-reactive anti­
body (Hara et al., 2018). This experiment with different species and tissues consis­
tently resulted in highly similar distributions of CTCF binding sites, regardless of 
the tissues used (e.g., catshark embryo versus juvenile stomach) (Figure 5.4). This 
analysis revealed that the most upstream and the most downstream CTCF binding 
sites in Hox clusters are oriented outwards and that there are few CTCF binding sites 
between Hox1 and Hox4 (Figure 5.4). Because the CTCF binding site distribution in 
the shark Hox clusters, including these features, highly resembles that reported from 
amniotes and is distinct from that of the lamprey (Kadota et al., 2017), it is likely that 
the CTCF-based epigenomic regulation of Hox gene expression seen in mammals 
was established at the last common ancestor of modern jawed vertebrates.
5.5  ELASMOBRANCH HOX C GENE REPERTOIRE
Previously, it was hypothesized that elasmobranchs lost the entire Hox C cluster at 
the point of their common ancestor (King et al., 2011), but this hypothesis was not 
drawn from a genome-wide survey. This hypothesis turned out not to be true, but 
instead it has a lot to do with the characteristics of the nucleotide sequences of elas­
mobranch Hox C genes that make them highly elusive.
To test this hypothesis with whole genome sequences, the author’s team performed 
intensive searches for Hox C genes as a part of the genome-wide study (Hara et al., 
2018). This survey of the elasmobranch genome and transcriptome sequences identified 
at least one putative ORF of a Hox C gene per species (Hara et al., 2018). Remarkably, 
two of the putative Hox C loci of the whale shark included a stop codon in the homeo­
box in their deduced amino acid sequences, which are regarded as pseudogenized 
(ψHoxC9 and ψHoxC10 in Figures 5.2 and 5.5). The greatest number of putative Hox 
C genes were identified in the zebra bullhead shark H. zebra for which only embry­
onic transcriptome sequences were available (HoxC6, -C8, -C9, -C10, -C11, -C12, and 
-C13), while only one has been identified in the cloudy catshark S. torazame (HoxC11) 
(Figure 5.2). To date, no sequence has been identified as derived from putative Hox 
C genes in the small-spotted catshark S. canicula for which Hox gene repertoire and 
cluster structure were previously intensively analyzed (Oulion et  al., 2011; Oulion 
et al., 2010). Also, our attempt to amplify a cDNA of a putative HoxC11 ortholog using 
embryonic material from this species did not yield any positive results. The recently 

109
Structural Constraints in Hox Clusters
sequenced genome of the thorny skate A. radiata (Rhie et al., 2021) does not seem to 
harbor any Hox C genes either, based on the genome assembly version available as of 
July 2021. The genomic sequences harboring Hox C genes might be retrieved in the 
future by using a high-fidelity long-read sequencing platform even in those species.
In the genome of the cloudy catshark S. torazame, the only putative Hox C 
member identified in the species so far, HoxC11, was located in an approximately 
FIGURE 5.4  Distribution of CTCF binding sites in the Hox clusters. Only the peaks vali­
dated with replicates are shown. CTCF binding sites are indicated with the black arrowheads 
and bars. The arrowheads indicate the orientations of core motifs, and black bars indicate 
CTCF binding sites without a core motif. The cloudy catshark Evx1 ortholog was identified 
on a separate genomic scaffold from the one containing the Hox A cluster, which is indicated 
with the broken horizontal line. The result from lamprey embryos was adapted from the pre­
vious study by Kadota et al. (2017). The chondrichthyan Hox C clusters are excluded.

50 Kbp–long scaffold, which also harbors a putative protein-coding gene whose 
deduced amino acid sequence shows similarity to G protein-coupled receptors (Hara 
et al., 2018). More putative Hox C genes were identified in both the bamboo shark 
and the whale shark, but they were almost all located in the genomic scaffolds with 
lengths of less than 10 Kbp in our first genome assemblies (Hara et al., 2018). Later 
in the bamboo shark, genome assembly improved by the Chicago method that is 
mediated by an in vitro chromatin reconstruction method (Kadota et al., 2020), one 
scaffold included HoxC6 and HoxC8 (Kuraku, 2021). In addition, the white shark 
genome sequences assembled solely with short reads (Marra et al., 2019) succeeded 
in retrieving scaffold sequences harboring multiple putative Hox C genes (HoxC6-
HoxC8, HoxC9-HoxC10-HoxC11, and HoxC12-HoxC13). Altogether, it is highly 
probable that all relict Hox C genes are located in a cluster in individual genomes, 
but with reduced structural constraints that led to cluster elongation and massive 
repeat invasion (see below). The erosion of canonical constraint on a Hox cluster

might be operating differentially among the elasmobranch lineages and account for 
different Hox C gene repertoires between the species analyzed.
5.6  GENE EXPRESSION: ARE THE DIVERGENT 
HOX C GENES FUNCTIONAL?
Despite the early arrival of the whole genome sequences of the elephant fish C. milii, 
this species has not attracted developmental biologists interested in Hox genes much 
(Jung et al., 2018). On the other hand, expression localization analysis of elasmo­
branch Hox genes has been conducted in different contexts, but always in egg-laying 
species (mainly in the catsharks and skates). Many of these studies focused on fin 
development (Onimaru et al., 2021) or clasper formation (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). 
Above all, one remarkable landmark study was again the one by Oulion et al. that 
comprehensively documented expression patterns of all Hox A, B, and D genes of the 
small-spotted catshark (Oulion et al., 2011). This study highlighted a spatio-temporal 
collinearity―namely, the correspondence of the onset timing and anterior boundary 
of Hox gene expression with the chromosomal location of those genes. Later, digital 
expression profiling of Hox genes, including the putative Hox C members, was per­
formed at different selected developmental stages with RNA-seq, although it targeted 
whole embryos (Hara et al., 2018). This analysis detected the expected time-course 
gradualism of the expression levels of individual Hox genes―the closer a Hox gene 
is to the 3′-end of the cluster (with lower paralog group number), the earlier its tran­
scription is initiated (Figure 5.6). This pattern is consistent with the canonical ‘Hox 
code’ scheme previously shown with whole-mount in situ hybridization staining in 
the small-spotted catshark (Oulion et al., 2011), as well as in other vertebrates.
Are the elasmobranch Hox C genes with their unexpectedly high sequence diver­
gence really functional? This question is primarily addressed by quantification of 
synonymous substitutions versus non-synonymous substitutions (see Hurst, 2002). 
This analysis revealed more substitutions (both synonymous and non-synonymous 
substitutions) occurring in the coding regions of elasmobranch Hox C genes (except 
for the whale shark ψHoxC9 and ψHoxC10 genes with nonsense mutations in the 
homeodomain) than in other genes, but also revealed more synonymous substitutions 
than non-synonymous substitutions (KS > KA), suggesting that those Hox C genes 
encode proteins that are under purifying selection. Interestingly, the onset timing of 
HoxC11 expression coincided with that of HoxA11 and -D11 at stage 17 (Figure 5.6). 
For the cloudy catshark HoxC11 as well as the brownbanded bamboo shark HoxC8 
and HoxC11, in situ hybridization was performed to investigate tissue-level expression 
localization. This analysis confirmed their embryonic expression and localization of 
transcripts in axial elements, including neural tube and somite (or its derivatives) with 
the expected positioning of anterior boundaries inferred from the other genes in the 
respective paralog groups (paralog groups 8 and 11) (Hara et al., 2018).
5.7  REPETITIVE ELEMENTS IN CHONDRICHTHYAN HOX CLUSTERS
Hox clusters of some vertebrates have long been known to be almost devoid of repeti­
tive elements (Fried et al., 2004; Lander et al., 2001). In contrast, the elasmobranch 
genome scaffold sequences containing the putative Hox C genes underwent massive 

112
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
invasion of repetitive sequences (Figure 5.3). In this fraction of the genomes, a higher 
occurrence of the repetitive elements categorized as DNA elements and low com­
plexity sequences, including simple repeats, was observed (Figure 5.7). This sug­
gests that the identified Hox C genes are embedded in genome regions free from 
canonical constraints that reduce the repeat frequency in typical jawed vertebrate 
Hox clusters. Also, our reanalysis of repeat contents revealed that the C. milii Hox C 
cluster harbors more repeats than the Hox A, -B, and -D clusters (16% versus 2–6%) 
(Figure 5.7). This suggests that the Hox C cluster might have already experienced 
FIGURE 5.6  Temporal Hox gene expression in cloudy catshark embryos. Relative expres­
sion levels of cloudy catshark Hox genes were quantified in biological triplicates with RNA-
seq (see Hara et al., 2018) for selected developmental stages. The highest expression levels for 
individual Hox genes are set at 1.0, and their relative expression levels of the other stages are 
shown with gradual color intensity.

113
Structural Constraints in Hox Clusters
repeat invasion in early chondrichthyan evolution or even earlier, which might later 
have led to variable patterns of gene retention in the bamboo shark (HoxC6, HoxC8, 
HoxC11, HoxC12, and HoxC13 retained), whale shark (HoxC8, HoxC11, HoxC12, 
and HoxC13 retained), the catshark (that retains only HoxC11), and C. milii (that 
retains the whole cluster) (Figure 5.2).
5.8  NON-CODING RNA IN CHONDRICHTHYAN HOX CLUSTERS
A search of non-coding transcript sequences in shark genome analysis revealed a 
few candidates located in Hox gene clusters. They included a putative homolog of 
Hottip, which was previously reported exclusively in tetrapod lineages (Wang et al., 
FIGURE 5.7  Proportion of repetitive elements in Hox-containing genomic scaffolds. This 
figure is based on repeat detection with RepeatModeler/RepeatMasker and was modified 
from Hara et al. (2018). For the elasmobranch scaffolds containing putative Hox C genes, 
the whole scaffold sequences reported by Hara et al. (2018) were used separately for repeat 
detection, and the results are summed in this figure. For the Hox A, B, and D clusters, the 
sequences containing Hox genes and intervals between them (namely, from the translation 
initiation codon of Hox13 to the stop codon of Hox1) were used for repeat detection. The 
repeat abundance in the Hox B cluster was shown with and without the regions between 
HoxB10 and HoxB13, because this region has a distinctly higher repeat coverage than the rest 
of the Hox B cluster (Figure 5.2). Note that the abundance of repetitive elements in Hox C 
clusters can be underestimated if undetermined regions in them tend to be repeat-rich.

114

2011). Mapping the RNA-seq reads to the bamboo shark genome confirmed the anti­
sense transcription of the putative Hottip homolog on a locus adjacent to HoxA13. 
Interestingly, in these mapped reads, antisense transcripts of HoxA11, possibly 
homologous to mammalian HoxA11-AS, which was not identified in our search 
based on sequence similarity, were identified. Although the antisense HoxA11 tran­
scription was recently suggested to be specific to the tetrapod lineages and proposed 
to underlie the evolution of the pentadactyl limb (Kherdjemil et al., 2016), these find­
ings indicate that the antisense HoxA11 transcription likely has a more ancient origin 
than previously thought. Together, these findings highlight that because of both the 
slow evolutionary rate and the accessibility to embryonic materials, elasmobranchs 
can provide valuable insight into lncRNA evolution in vertebrates.
5.9  HOX14: CRYPTIC PAN-VERTEBRATE GENES
One memorable context that featured shark Hox genes was the late discovery of 
Hox14 (Powers and Amemiya, 2004). This novel paralog group of vertebrate Hox 
genes, first identified in the horn shark H. francisci and the Australian lungfish 
Neoceratodus forsteri, was later shown not to have one-to-one orthology to amphi­
oxus Hox14 (Kuraku et al., 2008), to be absent from the human and model species, 
and to be possessed by some other species, including lamprey, shark, and elephant 
fish C. milii (Feiner et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2009). Thus, Hox14 genes of verte­
brates can be regarded as ‘cryptic pan-vertebrate genes’ that existed at the verte­
brate ancestor but were later lost multiple times in subsequent lineages (reviewed 
in Kuraku, 2021; Kuraku et al., 2016). The cryptic pan-vertebrate genes character­
ized so far include Bmp16 (Feiner et al., 2009, 2019), Fgf24 (Jovelin et al., 2010), 
Fgf17 (Abramyan, 2015), Sox15 (Ogita et al., 2021), Mrf7 (Aase-Remedios et al., 
2020), and Wnt11b (Kuraku and Kuratani, 2011). Expression patterns of Hox14 
genes have been studied only in the embryos of the Australian lungfish, the Arctic 
lamprey, the cloudy catshark, and the small-spotted catshark, and have all been 
localized in the cloacal region (Feiner et al., 2011; Kuraku et al., 2008; Oulion 
et al., 2011).
Later, Hox14 orthologs were identified in the paddlefish Polyodon spathula (Crow 
et al., 2012) and some species whose whole genome sequences were made avail­
able, such as white shark C. carcharias, the sterlet Acipenser ruthenus, and West 
African lungfish Protopterus annectens. It should be noted that the descriptions of 
the Hox14 gene entries in NCBI Nucleotide/Protein tend to be confusing, probably 
because the automated pipeline at NCBI usually refers to the gene description for 
human orthologs. If the human orthologs are not present, as is the case for this gene 
(as well as other ‘cryptic pan-vertebrate genes’), the description of close paralogs 
(still possessed by humans) tends to be given. In fact, the vertebrate Hox14 genes, 
as confirmed with molecular phylogeny, are designated in the database as ‘Mox2-
like’ (Petromyzon marinus, XP_032814148), ‘HoxD12-like’ (Latimeria chalum­
nae, XP_005993151), ‘HoxA7-like’ (Rhincodon typus, XP_020375106; Amblyraja 
radiata, XP_032879362), ‘HoxA4-like’ (Carcharodon carcharias, XP_041056252), 
‘Hhex2-like’ (Scyliorhinus canicula, XP_038646325), and ‘HoxC8-like’ (Acipenser 
ruthenus, XP_033900481) (Figure 5.8A).

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
The sequence alignment in Figure 5.8B includes deduced amino acid sequences 
of these relatively new and pre-existing entries in the NCBI Protein database for 
putative orthologs of vertebrate Hox14. The hallmark of this group of genes at the 
primary sequence level is the insertion of an intron immediately before the amino 
acid stretch VKIWFQN in the homeodomain (Figure 5.8B). Even after the Hox14 
orthologs were reported for more species, this feature still holds as a commonality of 
Hox14 genes identified in vertebrates (Figure 5.8B). It is worth investigating whether 
this hallmark provides any clue for disentangling the origin and phylogeny of verte­
brate Hox14 genes as well as any relevance to their functions.
5.10  SUMMARY
The last ten years have witnessed remarkable progress of molecular-level studies 
on elasmobranchs at a genome scale. Surveys of Hox genes in sharks and rays have 
revealed a contrasting pattern between Hox A, B, and D with high conservation and 
Hox C with reduced structural constraints that resulted in sequence elongation and 
massive repeat invasion. The former clusters would be categorized as ‘organized’ clus­
ters and the latter as ‘disorganized’ clusters, according to the previously proposed clas­
sification (Duboule, 2007). The possible collinearity of the Hox C gene expression, 
which may be achieved even with such reduced structural constraint, should be exam­
ined in the light of transcriptional and epigenomic data for more Hox C genes that are 
not currently available. Another current limitation is the incompleteness of the genomic 
sequences, particularly in intronic and intergenic regions, which is caused primarily by 
frequent repetitive sequences. Ongoing efforts for obtaining more complete genome 
sequences partly made by the project Squalomix (Nishimura et al., 2022; https://github.
com/Squalomix/info) are expected to establish the basis of further developmental stud­
ies on variable morphology among chondrichthyans, such as fin number and position.

6.1  INTRODUCTION
Hagfish and lampreys are the only living representatives of jawless vertebrates, or 
agnathans, a group of vertebrates that diverged before the advent of the articulated 
jaw, a trait that defines the group of jawed vertebrates or gnathostomes. Although 
hagfish and lampreys have traditionally been considered to form a paraphyletic 
group from a morphological point of view, with lampreys considered more closely 
related to gnathostomes and thus excluding hagfish from vertebrates, advances 
in both morphological and molecular phylogenetics have clearly shown that both 
form a monophyletic group, called Cyclostomata (from “round mouth”), which is 
the extant sister group of all gnathostomes (Figure 6.1A). Moreover, most of the 
morphological evidence used to support the paraphyly of hagfish and lamprey has 
been revised with the most recent works on hagfish development, mainly coming 
from the laboratory of Shigeru Kuratani (Higuchi et al., 2019; Oisi et al., 2013; Ota 
et al., 2007, 2011; Sugahara et al., 2016; see Kuratani, 2021, for a review). However, 
despite the monophyletic character of cyclostomes now being the most widely

Evolution of Cyclostome Hox Clusters
accepted view, the phylogenetic position of the hagfish is still surprisingly debated 
by some, and the previous morphology-based tree is still considered, although only 
occasionally in current studies (see Figure 6.1 in Theofanopoulou et al., 2021, for a 
relevant recent example). Clearly, a deep phylogenomic analysis taking advantage of 
whole genome data from the hagfish would likely solve the debate about the hagfish 
position definitively (currently, an early, fragmented version of a hagfish genome is 
publicly available at https://www.ensembl.org/Eptatretus_burgeri/; Pascual-Anaya 
et al., 2018). In either case, hagfish and lampreys are fundamental models in com­
parative analyses with gnathostomes to infer ancestral conditions of vertebrates from 
genomic, morphological, and evolutionary developmental perspectives (Shimeld and 
Donoghue, 2012).
Despite their key phylogenetic position, cyclostome models have been, probably 
together with chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), the least studied ver­
tebrate groups, mainly due to the difficulty with accessing samples of both adults 
and eggs, especially from the hagfish. In the case of cyclostomes, the lamprey is 
relatively easier to access, and it has therefore been the model of choice by labo­
ratories studying the early evolution of vertebrates (see Shimeld and Donoghue, 
2012, for a review). Lampreys can provide thousands of eggs in the ­laboratory—
although seasonally and during a short period of the year—and this has permitted, 
in recent years, the adaption of state-of-the-art functional techniques for applica­
tion to their embryos, such as the introduction of gene reporter constructs (Parker 
et al., 2014b) or more recently the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing 
(Square et al., 2015).
Cyclostome and gnathostome lineages diverged over 500 million years ago (mya), 
with hagfish and lamprey lineages splitting from each other relatively soon after, 
around 400 mya (Kuraku and Kuratani, 2006). Despite having evolved for almost 
the same amount of time as gnathostomes, cyclostomes are generally wrongly con­
sidered more primitive than gnathostomes (Omland et al., 2008), which has contrib­
uted to the misperception that what is observed in cyclostomes is primitive while 
gnathostome characters display derived states. The striking differences we observe 
today between cyclostome and gnathostome body plans are, however, consistent with 
the long and independent evolution of both lineages, which include both primitive 
and derived character states in both groups. This is also the case between lampreys 
and hagfish, since both lineages are characterized by striking differences, the most 
conspicuous being that hagfish are direct developers, while all living lamprey spe­
cies have a larval stage in their life cycles. Nonetheless, both the hagfish and the 
lampreys display some common features during development, suggesting a common 
ground plan that is consistent with their common ancestry (Kuratani, 2021). These 
long, independent evolutionary histories are likely behind the acquisition of radically 
different body plans, rather than one being ancestral and the other derived, and these 
differences must be somehow reflected in the genomes, including the Hox genes 
(Figure 6.1A), as these are expected to have had an important contribution to the evo­
lution of morphological diversity (Wagner et al., 2003). Here, we review and bring 
together all the current knowledge pertaining to Hox genes of cyclostomes: the gene 
complements, their expression during cyclostome development, and their regulation 
and integration into gene regulatory networks (GRN) that are associated with key 

124

morphological traits of vertebrates. We conclude that, despite having retained con­
served features, which originated in an ancestral vertebrate that possessed two rather 
than four Hox clusters, the independent expansion and evolution of Hox clusters in 
cyclostomes and gnathostomes are likely behind their morphological differences and 
their respective novelties (such as the jaw and paired appendages of gnathostomes) 
and, importantly, illustrates that there are two ways, rather than one, of making a 
vertebrate.
6.2  EVOLUTION OF CYCLOSTOME HOX COMPLEMENTS
It has been proposed that the genomes of vertebrates have been shaped by several 
whole genome duplication (WGD) events early in their evolution (Figure 6.1A). For 
instance, it is generally accepted that the gnathostome genome is the result of two 
ancestral tetraploidization events, classically known as the 2R Hypothesis (Dehal 
and Boore, 2005). As a result of these 2R events, the ancestral gnathostome genome 
contained four paralogous Hox clusters (Figure 6.1A), which are more specifi­
cally ohnologous, in reference to Susumo Ohno, who was the first to propose these 
WGD events and their importance in genome karyotype evolution (Ohno, 1970). 
Invertebrates typically have one pre-duplicative Hox cluster (Pascual-Anaya et al., 
2013). Most groups of jawed vertebrates have retained these four clusters, with dis­
tinct gene complements depending on differential Hox gene losses (Figure 6.1A). The 
2R are, however, not the only duplicative events that have contributed to shape ver­
tebrate genome architecture, and some lineages, particularly fish, have experienced 
extra rounds of WGD in the past, the most well-known being that of teleost fishes 
(teleost-specific genome duplication or TGD; Amores et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 2001) 
(Figure 6.1A). Due to this TGD, the teleost last common ancestor possessed 8 Hox 
clusters, and species deriving from that ancestor nowadays have retained >4 Hox 
clusters, with numbers ranging from 5 to 8, depending on whether one or more 
Hox clusters eroded or not: the African butterfly fish Pantodon buchholzi with 5 clus­
ters (Martin and Holland, 2014); the zebrafish Danio rerio, 7 clusters (Amores et al., 
1998) (Figure 6.1A); and the European eel Anguilla anguilla, 8 clusters (Henkel 
et al., 2012), to mention some examples. An additional WGD after the TGD has 
occurred independently in the carp/goldfish (Luo et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2019) and 
salmonid (Berthelot et al., 2014; Lien et al., 2016) lineages, increasing their numbers 
of Hox clusters even further up to 13 (Moghadam et al., 2005a, b; Mungpakdee et al., 
2008; Xu et al., 2014). Other non-teleost fish lineages have experienced an indepen­
dent WGD event, namely paddlefish (Cheng et al., 2021) and sturgeon (Cheng et al., 
2019; Du et al., 2020), and their genomes also contain eight Hox clusters.
There thus seems to be a clear trend relating the number of WGD events to the 
number of Hox clusters in a lineage. This is important because whether the 2R hap­
pened before or after the cyclostome divergence has been, and continues to be, a 
matter of much debate. Several hypotheses have been proposed, based on different 
approaches. One that gained early, and the most recent support is that cyclostomes 
diverged after the 1R but before the 2R, making the 2R a gnathostome-specific event 
(Escriva et al., 2002; Nakatani et al., 2021; Simakov et al., 2020). An alternative 
hypothesis considers that the 2R is ancestral to all vertebrates (Kuraku et al., 2009; 

125
Evolution of Cyclostome Hox Clusters
Sacerdot et al., 2018). A minority view is that the 2R never occurred, and the ver­
tebrate karyotype is the result of a 1R followed by extensive segmental duplica­
tions (Smith and Keinath, 2015; Smith et al., 2018). Before the current genomic era, 
describing the full complement of Hox clusters of cyclostomes provided early hints 
toward answering this long-standing question. The first studies aiming at describing 
the Hox clusters of cyclostomes utilized degenerate PCRs to find Hox genes in both 
hagfish and lamprey. In lampreys, these surveys were carried out in different spe­
cies: Petromyzon marinus (Carr et al., 1998; Force et al., 2002; Irvine et al., 2002; 
Pendleton et al., 1993), Lampetra planeri (Sharman and Holland, 1998), and the 
Arctic lamprey Lethenteron camtschaticum (syn. Lethenteron japonicum; Kuraku 
et al., 2008; Takio et al., 2004, 2007). In the case of the hagfish, the first PCR-based 
assay (Stadler et al., 2004) described the presence of 33 Hox genes in the Pacific 
hagfish Eptatretus stoutii, which was one of the lowest counts of Hox genes for 
any vertebrate up to that date, but was still indicative of multiple clusters. Without 
whole genome sequence information, all these studies were far from conclusive and 
the 2R conundrum remained unsolved. Stadler and colleagues hypothesized, based 
on their very short sequence information, that cyclostomes diverged at least after 
the first WGD and that subsequent independent gene/cluster duplications expanded 
the Hox inventory. The analysis of the somatic genome of P. marinus, the first of a 
cyclostome species, did not solve this problem either, contributing only scattered 
information regarding Hox clusters (Smith et al., 2013). The description of the com­
plete Hox repertoire of lampreys had to wait until the analysis of the genome of 
L. camtschaticum (Mehta et al., 2013) and was later confirmed with the analysis of 
the germ line genome sequence of P. marinus (Smith et al., 2018); in total, lampreys 
have a conserved set of 42 Hox genes arranged in 6 intact clusters (Figure 6.1A). The 
presence of more than four clusters suggested the existence of additional WGDs in 
lampreys, independently from whether the 2R was shared with gnathostomes or not 
(Mehta et al., 2013). Interestingly, the recent analysis of a preliminary draft genome 
assembly of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri together with its developmental 
transcriptome identified 40 Hox genes in at least 6 Hox clusters (Figure 6.1A), very 
similar to the lamprey and thus implying the possibility that their origin preceded 
the divergence of the lamprey and hagfish lineages (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018). 
Intriguingly, cyclostome Hox clusters are much larger in size than their gnathostome 
counterparts (with reported sizes ranging from 145 to 526 kb in L. camtschaticum, 
compared to the 100–200 kb average size for gnathostomes) and contain higher lev­
els of interspersed repetitive elements (Mehta et al., 2013).
More recent, robust chromosome-level macrosynteny analyses of gnathostomes 
and several lamprey genomes have eventually confirmed that cyclostomes diverged 
after a pan-vertebrate ancestral 1R, but before the gnathostome-specific, classic 2R; 
secondarily, at least lampreys have evolved after an independent 2R–3R (Nakatani 
et al., 2021; Simakov et al., 2020) (Figure 6.1A), which is supported by phylogenetic 
and synteny analyses, including linked non-Hox genes, that suggest that lamprey 
Hoxβ and -ε clusters and—although less likely— Hoxα and -δ clusters come from 
a lamprey duplication (Parker et al., 2019a; Smith et al., 2018). Due to the generally 
weak phylogenetic signal between lamprey and hagfish Hox genes and the lack of a 
hagfish chromosome-level genome assembly to use for a more robust macrosynteny 

126

analysis (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2018), whether the hagfish shares 
these additional WGD events with lampreys or not remains unclear (Figure 6.1A). 
The presence of six Hox clusters implies that some whole clusters have been lost 
during cyclostome evolution: either one cluster was lost after the lamprey/hagfish/­
cyclostome-specific 2R, resulting in three clusters before a 3R, or two losses occurred 
in an eight-cluster ancestor (Figure 6.1B).
6.3  ANCESTRAL LOSS OF HOX12 PARALOGS
Analyses of both the lamprey and the hagfish Hox catalogues revealed the strik­
ing lack of all members of the Hox12 paralogy group (PG). Given that orthology 
relationships between posterior Hox genes of invertebrate chordates and vertebrate 
PGs do not correspond with each other (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2013), a remote formal 
possibility is that at least two gnathostome Hox12 genes could have originated through 
independent tandem duplications from another posterior Hox gene in a stem gna­
thostome with two Hox clusters after divergence from cyclostomes, meaning that 
a Hox12 PG would have never existed in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. 
However, the paralogy of all gnathostome Hox12 genes is strongly supported by phy­
logenetic analyses, which unequivocally implies the presence of a Hox12 gene in a 
pre-duplicative ancestral Hox cluster. Therefore, the most plausible scenario is that at 
least two Hox12 genes were lost in the last common ancestor of cyclostomes, one per 
each of the two ancestral Hox clusters. Phylogenetic analyses done using Hox pro­
tein sequences from both the hagfish and lamprey together with gnathostomes have 
clearly shown that cyclostomes have members of the other posterior PGs, strongly 
supporting the gene loss scenario (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018). This is the only case 
in which one of the two major vertebrate groups lacks all members of a single Hox 
PG, and the impacts such losses could have had on the early divergence of cyclo­
stomes remain unclear. Hox12 genes have important roles in patterning not only the 
posterior body, but also secondary structures like the distal parts of paired append­
ages of jawed vertebrates (fins and limbs). Since these paired appendages are not 
present in cyclostomes, this suggests that PG12 genes might have gained selective 
pressures in the gnathostome lineage while the genes could be lost in cyclostomes, 
potentially due to overlapping functionality with other posterior genes, for example 
in the tailbud (Kuraku et al., 2008; Takio et al., 2007).
6.4  SPATIAL COLLINEARITY AND THE HOX 
CODE IN CYCLOSTOMES
In most animals, Hox genes are expressed following a nested pattern where the 
expression domain of each gene correlates with its position in the cluster, from 3′/
rostral toward 5′/caudal (Gaunt, 2015). In this way, a distinct combination of Hox 
genes, or Hox code, is created along the anterior-posterior axis of the animal. In 
jawed vertebrates, this pattern is most clearly observed in the hindbrain and the neu­
ral crest (NC) derived mesenchyme of pharyngeal arches, where the rostral border 
of anterior Hox gene expression sharply corresponds with or is restricted to these 
morphologically distinct segments (rhombomeres and pharyngeal arches), with the 

127
Evolution of Cyclostome Hox Clusters
exceptions of rhombomere (r) 1 and the first pharyngeal arch (PA) 1, which are char­
acterized by the absence of Hox expression. On the other hand, posterior Hox genes 
are involved in the patterning of more caudal regions of the embryo.
Most of the expression data in cyclostomes comes from studies using mainly two 
species of lampreys, L. camtschaticum (Kuraku et al., 2008; Murakami et al., 2004; 
Onimaru et al., 2011; Takio et al., 2004, 2007) and P. marinus (Parker et al., 2014a, 
2019a). A comprehensive expression analysis of all PG1-4 genes in P. marinus has 
shown that these Hox genes are expressed similarly to their gnathostome counter­
parts, including segmentally restricted expression patterns of some of them in the 
hindbrain and the NC of pharyngeal arches (Parker et al., 2019a) (see Figure 6.1C). 
For instance, the rhombomere-restricted expression of hoxβ1 in r4 is reminiscent of 
that of Hoxb1 in gnathostomes (Parker et al., 2014a, 2019a). In total, 8 out of 14 lam­
prey PG1-4 genes are expressed with a rhombomere registration, i.e., their anterior 
borders of expression coincide with the anatomical borders of rhombomeres, like in 
gnathostomes (Figure 6.1C). For instance, at stage 23, lamprey hoxα2 is expressed 
up to the r1/2 border with high levels of expression in r3 and r5, like gnathostome 
Hoxa2 (Parker et al., 2014a, 2019a). Importantly, Parker et al. also found that some 
lamprey Hox4 genes (hoxα4 and hoxζ4) are expressed from the r6/7 border, like in 
gnathostomes (Parker et al., 2019a) (Figure 6.1C). In the hagfish, very similar pat­
terns to those of the lamprey and gnathostome have also been found more recently, 
with hox2.IV expressed in the hindbrain with an anterior limit at the r1/2 border, 
hox3.II at the r4/5 border, and hox4.IV at the r6/7 border (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018) 
(Figure 6.1C). Contrary to gnathostomes, however, this segmental registration of 
anterior Hox genes in the hindbrain seems to be transient and dynamic, at least in the 
lamprey, where the domain-restricted expression of some of the Hox genes seems to 
disappear as development progresses (Parker et al., 2019a). For instance, sea lamprey 
hoxα3 has an initial rostral limit of expression at the r4/5 border, like gnathostome 
paralogues Hoxa3, -b3 and -d3, but becomes more restricted into r4 at later stages, 
as also observed in the Arctic lamprey (Murakami et al., 2004; Parker et al., 2019a).
Five of the lamprey PG2-4 Hox genes are also expressed in nested domains within 
the pharyngeal arches, like in gnathostomes. Curiously, only genes from hoxα and 
hoxδ clusters are expressed in the pharyngeal arches’ NC: hoxα2, -δ2, -α3, -δ3, and 
-δ4, but, unlike in gnathostomes, with little redundancy between genes of the same 
PG (Parker et al., 2019a; 2019b; Takio et al., 2007, 2004). In the hagfish, genes of 
the PG2-5 are also expressed collinearly in the pharynx, although the exact associa­
tion of Hox genes with specific pharyngeal arches is not clear (Pascual-Anaya et al., 
2018). In the lamprey, two Hox genes, hoxδ2 and hoxζ4, are also expressed in the 
endostyle, a structure that during metamorphosis will give rise to the thyroid (Parker 
et al., 2019a).
Less is known about the expression patterns of other central and posterior Hox 
genes and their possible functions in the morphological patterning of cyclostomes. 
Again, most of our knowledge comes from work with lampreys, in this case, the 
Arctic lamprey. Several studies on L. camtschaticum have reported the expression 
patterns of 13 out of 28 PG5-14 genes (hoxα5, -γ5, -α6, -β7, -α8, -ε8, -β9, -β10, -ε10, 
-ε11, -γ13, -δ13, and -ε14; Kuraku et al., 2008; Takio et al., 2007, 2004). For most 
of these genes, they found colinear expression in the neural tube but not in the PA 

128
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
ectomesenchyme, as in gnathostomes. Posterior PG9-11 genes that were analyzed 
were expressed in the progressing tailbud and the neural tube, where they acquire a 
fixed anterior boundary, with the notable exception of hoxε10, whose expression in 
the neural tube remains continuously restricted to the level of the tailbud, therefore 
displaying a dynamic anterior boundary that moves posteriorly throughout devel­
opment, unlike in gnathostomes, where Hox genes have fixed rostral limits (Takio 
et al., 2007). hoxδ13 is also expressed in the tailbud. Finally, hoxγ13, -δ13, and -ε14 
are all found in the most posterior region surrounding the hindgut, where hoxγ13 was 
found in the cloacal region (Kuraku et al., 2008). Consistent with its lamprey coun­
terparts, hagfish hox13.II and -13.VI genes have been found in the cloacal region of 
the hagfish E. burgeri, although not hox14.I, at least in the stage and region assayed 
(Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018). These hindgut/cloacal-associated expression patterns 
have been found in gnathostomes as well (Theodosiou et al., 2007; Yokouchi et al., 
1995), suggesting that this was the case for the most posterior Hox genes in the com­
mon ancestor of living vertebrates.
In conclusion, the broad similarities between gnathostomes, lampreys, and hag­
fish strongly suggest that a nested expression of anterior Hox genes associated with 
the morphological segmentation of the hindbrain and the pharynx, including Hox 
absence from r1 and PA1 (Figure 6.1C). In addition, colinear expression in the rest 
of the neural tube and the most posterior regions of the body are all traits that were 
established in the last common ancestor of crown vertebrates before cyclostomes 
and gnathostomes diverged. Interestingly, this implies that this integration occurred 
in a vertebrate that most likely possessed only two Hox clusters. This system then 
evolved independently in both cyclostomes and gnathostomes through lineage-
specific duplications and divergence of paralogs, such as the dynamic expression 
boundaries observed in some cyclostome Hox genes, ultimately underlying the mor­
phological differences we observe in both groups.
6.5  REGULATORY EVOLUTION OF HOX GENES IN THE LAMPREY
Gnathostome Hox colinear expression is tightly integrated to the morphologi­
cal segmentation of both the hindbrain and the pharynx through conserved GRN 
(Alexander et al., 2009; Green et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2019b; Parker and Krumlauf, 
2020), and the similarities found between gnathostome, lamprey, and hagfish 
expression patterns of anterior Hox genes, together with the transient segmenta­
tion of the lamprey and hagfish hindbrain into rhombomeres (Kuratani et al., 1998; 
Oisi et al., 2013), strongly suggest the conservation of these GRNs in vertebrates. 
Indeed, reporter assays with gnathostome enhancers from Hox1–4 genes resulted in 
a temporally activated, segmental reporter activity in the hindbrain of lamprey and 
zebrafish embryos reflecting that of the genes these enhancers control endogenously 
(Parker et al., 2014a). Importantly, this activation seems to be mediated by the same 
regulatory inputs, since mutations of specific transcription factor binding sites for 
known segmental regulators, such as Krox20 and Kreisler, eliminated or reduced the 
reporter expression of a Hoxb3 r5 enhancer in both zebrafish and lamprey embryos 
(Parker et al., 2014a). Consistently, lamprey kreisler and krox20 are expressed in 
hindbrain segments similarly to Hox genes and reminiscent of their gnathostome 

129
Evolution of Cyclostome Hox Clusters
counterparts (Parker et al., 2014a). Furthermore, the dissection of the regulatory 
landscape of lamprey hoxα2 revealed that, despite the lack of sequence conserva­
tion, this gene is controlled by discrete cis-regulatory elements equivalent to those 
of gnathostome Hoxa2, strikingly including an exonic/intronic element that controls 
the expression in r2 and r4 (Parker et al., 2014a; Tümpel et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). 
Further characterization of the lamprey hoxα2 regulation found an enhancer with 
shared activity in r4 and its NC, like its Hoxa2 mouse counterpart, which demon­
strated that the NC GRN is also conserved to the base of vertebrates (Parker et al., 
2019b). As in the hindbrain, this activity seems to be mediated by deeply conserved 
transcription factor binding sites in both the lamprey and gnathostomes that involves 
Meis and Pbx-Hox factors (Parker et al., 2019b). At the same time, some divergence 
of these regulatory elements seems to have occurred independently in paralogs in 
both jawed and jawless vertebrates. For instance, while the NC enhancer in lamprey 
hoxα2 has a shared activity in r4, that of gnathostome Hoxa2 is separated into dis­
tinct enhancers (but remains shared in Hoxb2) (Parker et al., 2019b). Taken together, 
the data by Parker and colleagues suggests that the implementation of the NC GRN 
in the lamprey is mediated, as in the hindbrain, by conserved regulatory inputs and 
cis-regulatory elements.
Interestingly, although the GRNs for the patterning of the vertebrate NC and hind­
brain are well conserved in all major vertebrate lineages, none of the extant groups 
represent the ancestral condition particularly well, as these had to be established in 
a vertebrate that possessed only two Hox clusters, rather than the four that have usu­
ally been considered until now. There is no doubt that the independent WGDs taking 
place separately in the gnathostome and lamprey/hagfish/cyclostome lineages had a 
major impact on the divergence of the regulatory activity of these networks, while 
selective pressures and constraints on, for instance, cranial structures have broadly 
kept these GRNs intact.
More recently, an analysis of the global presence of active binding sites for 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the lamprey has demonstrated their presence in 
the Hox clusters, like in gnathostomes. However, unlike in gnathostomes, these seem 
to be abundant in the anterior regions of the clusters, which could be reflecting dif­
ferent modes of global regulation between amniotes and lampreys. However, the spe­
cific evolutionary implications of these differences remain unknown (Kadota et al., 
2017; see Chapter 5).
6.6  WHOLE-CLUSTER TEMPORAL COLLINEARITY 
OF CYCLOSTOME HOX GENES
Hox genes are also expressed following temporal collinearity (TC), meaning that 
genes in more anterior regions of the cluster are expressed at earlier developmental 
stages than genes in more posterior regions (Dollé et al., 1989; Izpisúa-Belmonte 
et al., 1991). In jawed vertebrates, this feature is usually observed across the whole 
cluster in order, which has recently been called whole-cluster TC (WTC; Wang 
et al., 2017). In contrast, in some protostomes, subgroups of Hox genes are expressed 
according to TC in parallel, and this has been called sub-cluster TC (STC; Wang 
et al., 2017). This raised the question of what mode of expression the Hox clusters of 

130
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
an ancestral vertebrate followed; either a more invertebrate-like mode, or WTC as 
seen in amniotes. Information from the cyclostomes could therefore help to resolve 
this. The first reports from the lamprey were unclear, since while the expression 
patterns observed from some genes belonging to the same cluster in the Arctic lam­
prey depicted no traces of TC (Takio et al., 2007), reporter assays with anterior 
regulatory elements pointed to the presence of temporally ordered expression of 
Hox1-3 (Parker et al., 2014a). A recent comprehensive analysis of all Hox genes from 
the lamprey L. camtschaticum and the hagfish E. burgeri, in comparison with the 
catshark Scyliorhinus torazame, has demonstrated that, at least in the lamprey, Hox 
genes of several clusters are expressed following WTC during development, clearly 
suggesting that the last common ancestor of vertebrates possessed Hox genes that 
were expressed according to the WTC mode (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018).
Again, it is noteworthy that vertebrate TC had to be established in an ancestor 
with two Hox clusters, and therefore we can infer the presence of strong constraints 
that maintained it in all four Hox clusters of gnathostomes, while in the lamprey, 
this seems to disappear from some gene-poor clusters (like hoxy), probably reflect­
ing the disappearance of such constraints in some paralogous clusters after the extra 
duplications in the cyclostome lineage (Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018). The implications 
for the morphological evolution of the lamprey remain obscure, but future functional 
experiments altering the TC in the lamprey will shed light on this question.
6.7  PERSPECTIVES ON A PUTATIVE HOX CODE IN 
THE ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR PATTERNING OF 
THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN LAMPREYS
The anterior-posterior patterning along the animal’s body axis is reflected in its ver­
tebral column. Vertebrae are somite-derivatives (Ebner, 1889; Remak, 1855), and 
while somites are morphologically similar, they produce vertebrae with different 
morphologies. Each vertebra has a distinct form and function depending on its posi­
tion along the anterior-posterior body axis (Gadow, 1933). The number of morpho­
functional regions as well as the number of vertebrae that contribute to one region 
vary across vertebrates (e.g., Bergmann and Irschick, 2012; Berio et al., 2021; Bui and 
Larsson, 2020; Jawad, 2015; Johanson et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 
2021; Morin-Kensicki et al., 2002; Müller et al., 2010; Sallan, 2012; Scheyer et al., 
2019; Ward and Mehta, 2014). Mostly, it has been assumed that vertebral regional­
ization is a gnathostome innovation, but there is evidence suggesting that it occurred 
earlier in vertebrate evolutionary history (Chevrinais et al., 2018; Tretjakoff, 1926).
Lampreys have cartilaginous vertebral arches that dorsally surround the spinal 
cord from head to tail (Tretjakoff, 1926) (Figure 6.2A). Traditionally, hagfish were 
thought to lack true vertebrae. However, a recent developmental study supports the 
observations made by Ayers and Jackson (1901) that they do have vertebra-like ele­
ments homologous to gnathostome vertebrae (Ota et al., 2011) (Figure 6.2A). These 
cartilaginous elements lie ventral to the notochord but are restricted to the tail region 
in hagfish. It may be possible that the vertebral column in lampreys and hagfish is 
secondarily reduced because the extinct relative Euphanerops had vertebral elements 

131
Evolution of Cyclostome Hox Clusters
at the dorsal and ventral aspects of the notochord (Janvier, 2011; Ota et al., 2014). 
Initially present in the common ancestor of all vertebrates, the ventral elements were 
then lost in lampreys and the dorsal elements were lost in hagfish (Ota et al., 2011) 
(Figure 6.2A). In contrast to the hagfish, in which the vertebral elements are con­
fined to the post-cloacal region, Tretjakoff (1926) noted that the vertebral column 
of lampreys is quite variable along its length, and identified five morphofunctional 
regions based on distinct characteristics (Figure 6.2B): (1) the vertebral arches of 
the gill region (“Kiemengebiet”) have an additional hole for the motor nerves; (2) in 
the cranial trunk region, the vertebral arches of the heart and liver region (“Herz-
Lebergebiet”) are characterized by being bipartite with a cranial and caudal half. 
The vertebral elements in this region are more or less vertical but become increas­
ingly bent caudally; (3) the middle trunk region (“mittleres Rumpfgebiet”) coincides 
with the cranial part of the dorsal fin. The vertebral arches are slightly S-shaped 
and always present as discrete structures; (4) in the caudal trunk region (“hinteres 
Rumpfgebiet”), the vertebral elements are taller compared to the preceding verte­
brae. They are irregular in shape partly forming N- and H-formed structures; (5) the 
vertebral arches become increasingly smaller in the tail region (“Schwanzgebiet”). 
Chevrinais et al. (2018) later supported this observation, identifying a branchial, pre­
dorsal, dorsal 1, dorsal 2, and caudal region that correspond to the regions defined by 
Tretjakoff (1926). In total, there are about 130 vertebral arches forming the vertebral 
column in the lamprey (Tretjakoff, 1926). The absolute number of segments is pri­
marily controlled by the process of somitogenesis (e.g., Gomez et al., 2008; Schröter 
and Oates, 2010), whereas the morphofunctional regionalization is the result of the 
sequential expression of Hox genes (i.e., Hox code) in the somites (reviewed by Mallo 
et al., 2010). In tetrapods, for instance, the transition from the cervical vertebral

chord (gray rod) lying ventrally to the neural tube (beige rod). The hypothetical last common 
ancestor of hagfish, lampreys, and gnathostomes had cartilaginous vertebrae consisting of 
dorsal and ventral elements. Potentially, dorsal elements got lost during evolution in hagfish 
and ventral elements got lost in lampreys. After Ota et al. (2011). (B) Top, schematic repre­

region (neck) to the thoracic vertebral region (trunk) correlates with the anterior 
expression limit of the Hox PG 6 (Böhmer et al., 2015b; Burke et al., 1995; Mansfield 
and Abzhanov, 2010; Woltering et al., 2009). A longer neck with more cervical ver­
tebrae is associated with a posterior shift of Hox-6 gene expression transposing the 
neck-trunk transition posteriorly. The correlation between regional identity of the 
vertebrae and the Hox gene expression pattern even allows for inference of evolution­
ary modifications in the Hox code based on quantitative morphological differences 
in the vertebral column (Böhmer, 2017; Böhmer et al., 2015a, 2018; Böhmer and 
Werneburg, 2017; Guinard and Marchand, 2010; Head and Polly, 2015; Johnson and 
O’Higgins, 1996; Szczygielski, 2017). This prompts the question of whether there is 
a relationship between vertebral regionalization and a Hox code in the lamprey as 
well (Figure. 6.2B).
In lampreys, information on the somitic Hox gene expression is incomplete to 
date. Onimaru et al. (2011) reported on two Hox genes that are expressed in the 
primitive paraxial mesoderm: at stage 22, the anterior expression limit of hoxα5 
was found at somites 9–10 and that of hoxα6 at somites 14–15. This data is clearly 
not sufficient to provide robust evidence, but it may hint at a spatial collinearity in 
the somitic expression of Hox genes in lampreys. To date, we can only hypothesize 
a correlation between a Hox code and regionalization in the vertebral column of 
lampreys (Figure 6.2B).
6.8  SUMMARY AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In the last decade, significant efforts toward understanding cyclostome genomics 
have enabled unprecedented comparative analysis with jawed vertebrates, permit­
ting probably the most accurate depiction of the last common vertebrate ancestor 
to date. It is important to note that this ancestor likely possessed two Hox clusters 
instead of the previously hypothesized four. Unfortunately, no lineage of vertebrates 
with this condition has survived to the present day, meaning that reconstructing this 
hypothetical animal will be more complicated than previously thought. Here we have 
seen how cyclostome and gnathostome Hox clusters have originated following inde­
pendent lineage-specific WGDs, while the main features of the clusters have been 
broadly retained in both lineages, especially those involved in the patterning of cra­
nial structures (e.g., conserved hindbrain and NC GRNs). There are also differences 
observed between the two groups, with distinct expression and regulatory divergence 
of paralogous Hox genes in each lineage. For instance, the dynamic nature of the 
anterior border of some cyclostome Hox genes versus the fixed pattern in gnathos­
tomes, expression of Hox genes in lineage-specific organs (e.g., lamprey endostyle), 
and differences in paralog expression (e.g. functionally overlapping in the pharynx 
in gnathostomes but not in the lamprey). Whether these differences are behind the 
morphological divergence and the origin of novelties in each of the lineages (e.g., jaw 
versus cyclostome velum) is not clear. We anticipate that further analyses of the Hox 
code, especially in non-cranial structures, is still necessary to better understand the 
Hox system of cyclostomes. This, together with more functional approaches using 
lamprey embryos, such as the mutation of specific Hox genes with the CRISPR/Cas9 
system and high-throughput analyses (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, in whole 

133

embryos and single cells), will enable an unprecedented dissection of the roles of 
cyclostome Hox genes. Ultimately, this will provide a deeper understanding of the 
ancestral roles of Hox genes in vertebrates, how these have changed and if those 
changes are responsible, at least in part, for vertebrate morphological diversification.

7.1  GENERAL FEATURES OF ECHINODERMS
Despite their unique body plan, echinoderms, together with hemichordates, are the 
sister group of chordates (Figure 7.1). Species in the phylum Echinodermata are 
exclusively marine invertebrates, and the phylum contains approximately 7,300 
known living species and approximately 15,000 fossil species (Brusca et al. 2016). 
Extant echinoderms consist of five classes: Crinoidea (sea lilies and feather stars), 
Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars and basket stars), Echinoidea 
(sea urchins, heart urchins, and sand dollars), and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) 
(Figure 7.1). Among these classes, Crinoidea are the most basal lineage and are part 
of the Pelmatozoa, which includes several fossil classes. The other four extant classes 
are grouped as Eleutherozoa, which are divided into two clades: Asterozoa com­
prising of Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea, and Echinozoa comprising of Echinoidea 
and Holothuroidea (Reich et al. 2015). They are generally characterized by a cal­
citic skeleton composed of numerous ossicles, a coelomic water vascular system that 
serves as the main organ for feeding and locomotion, mutable collagenous tissue with 
special structures to adjust their thickness under nervous control, and pentameral 
body organization in adults. Their affinity with the bilaterians is evident from their 
bilaterality during the embryo and larval stages, and they then develop the pentam­
erally symmetric body plan during metamorphosis (Figure 7.2A). Metamorphosis

usually includes or follows the development of the pentameral water vascular sys­
tem, suggesting the importance of this unique structure in forming the pentameral 
body of echinoderms. Paleontological studies indicate that the pentameral body plan 
originated evolutionarily from a unique bilateral ancestor, the 2-1-2 symmetric spe­
cies, in which only three rays radiate from the mouth and two of them split into two 
rays (Hotchkiss 1998; Sumrall and Wray 2007) (Figure 7.2B, C). Indeed, all non-
eleutherozoan echinoderms, including many extinct clades and extant crinoids, have 
2-1-2 symmetry (Sumrall and Wray 2007). Only extant crinoids retain a distinct gan­
glion in the central body, which works as the nerve center to integrate the motion of 
the arms (Marshall 1884) and thus has been thought to be the homologous structure 
of the brain of other bilaterians, which is an “anterior” structure. However, no evi­
dence supporting the homologous relationship between the ganglion of crinoids and 
the brain structure of bilaterians was obtained in a recent study (Omori et al. 2020). 
On the other hand, fossil and extant eleutherozoans are pentameral. Among eleu­
therozoans, sea cucumbers bear a clear anterior-posterior (AP) axis, with the mouth 
on the anterior tip and anus on the posterior tip. However, this AP axis is regarded 
as a secondarily derived state with no clear brain structures (Mooi and David 2008); 
thus, it is not directly comparable to the AP axis of other bilaterians. As we can see 
from the outline above, the evolutionary process of the bilateral to pentameral transi­
tion in echinoderms remains obscure, although there are many good fossil records

143
Hox Genes in Echinoderms
that suggest the transition from a bilateral ancestor to a pentameral extant echino­
derm body plan through the 2-1-2 symmetric species is well founded (Sumrall and 
Wray 2007; Kammer et al. 2013; Smith and Zamora 2013).
7.2  GENOMIC STRUCTURES OF HOX GENES 
IN BILATERIANS AND ECHINODERMS
Hox genes are involved in patterning along the AP axis through their temporally 
sequential or spatially arranged expression in many bilaterians. For example, Hox 
genes are clustered and linearly arranged on a chromosome that correlates to their 
temporal (early to late) or spatial (anterior to posterior) expression patterns in hemi­
chordates (Freeman et al. 2012), cephalochordates (Holland et al. 2008), vertebrates 
(Krumlauf 1994), arthropods (Shippy et al. 2008; Serano et al. 2016), and anne­
lids (Fröbius et al. 2008). Although urochordates do not show clustered genomic 
structures of Hox genes (Ikuta et al. 2004; Seo et al. 2004; Sekigami et al. 2017; 
Blanchoud et al. 2018; DeBiasse et al. 2020), broadly distributed clusters and col­
linearity of Hox genes indicate that a single Hox cluster with collinearity might have 
existed in both the last common ancestors of deuterostomes and bilaterians (Lemons 
and McGinnis 2006; Pascual-Anaya et al. 2013; David and Mooi 2014). Hox genes

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
are classified into several orthology groups based on the similarity of conserved 
residues in their encoded homeodomain sequences and their locations within the 
Hox cluster. An example of the above is the 14 paralogy groups (PGs) of Hox genes 
in vertebrates, which are further classified into three groups: anterior (Hox1–Hox3), 
medial (Hox4–Hox8), and posterior (Hox9–Hox14) (Powers and Amemiya 2004; 
Pascual-Anaya et al. 2013). Although the number of orthology groups varies among 
phyla, almost all known Hox genes from various bilaterians are classified into these 
three groups: anterior, medial, and posterior. In the ambulacrarian (echinoderm + 
hemichordate) clade, anterior and medial Hox genes are named Hox1–3 and ­Hox4–8, 
respectively, as in vertebrates, whilst posterior Hox genes are named Hox9/10 and 
Hox11/13a–e because of their similarity to vertebrate PG9 and 10 and PG11-13 genes, 
respectively (Martinez et al. 1999; Szabó and Ferrier 2018).
The first echinoderm Hox gene was isolated from the indirectly developing 
Hawaiian sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla (Dolecki et al. 1986), which was originally 
named TgHbox1, but was later identified as a Hox7 gene (Table 7.1). Three additional 
Hox genes (Hbox3, Hbox4, and Hbox6, which are classified as Hox6, 9/10, and 8, 
respectively) were identified in T. gratilla (Dolecki et al. 1988; Wang et al. 1990); 
however, the genomic structure of the Hox cluster was not examined in this species.
A purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is one of the most widely 
used model organisms in the field of developmental biology of echinoderms, and 
this indirectly developing sea urchin is the first echinoderm whose whole genome 
was sequenced (Sodergren et al. 2006). S. purpuratus has been found to have 13 
Hox genes, Hox1–3 in the anterior group, Hox5–8 in the medial group, and Hox9/10 
and Hox11/13a–e in the posterior group (Angerer et al. 1989; Ruddle et al. 1994; 
Dobias et al. 1996; Martinezet al. 1997, 1999; Arenas-Mena et al. 1998; Cameron 
et al. 2006; Thomas-Chollier et al. 2010; Szabó and Ferrier 2018). Hox4 is absent 
from the genome of S. purpuratus. These genes, except Hox11/13d and Hox11/13e, 
are clustered in the genome, however, the structure of the cluster is unique compared 
to other animals. In the Hox cluster of S. purpuratus, the anterior group Hox1-3 is 
translocated to the 5' end of the cluster (adjacent to Hox11/13c) in reverse transcrip­
tional orientation, resulting in the gene order of Hox1, 2, 3, 11/13c, 11/13b, 11/13a, 
9/10, 8, 7, 6, and 5. In addition, the transcriptional directions of Hox5 and Hox11/13b 
are inverted with respect to adjacent genes (Cameron et al. 2006) (Figure 7.3). These 
translocations and inversions of the genes in the Hox cluster were also observed 
in the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus, although the cluster was separated 
into two chromosomal regions between Hox11/13a and Hox11/13b (Li et al. 2020) 
(Figure 7.3).
Based on the highly modified Hox cluster in sea urchins in comparison to other 
deuterostomes, a hypothesis was that the modified Hox cluster is related to the derived 
pentameral body plan of echinoderms (Mooi and David 2008; David and Mooi 
2014). However, counter evidence for this idea was obtained in other echinoderms; 
a genomic study of a crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci revealed that the 
Hox cluster of this species generally resembles that of chordates and hemichordates 
(Baughman et al. 2014). The A. planci Hox cluster contains 11 genes (Hox1–5, 7, 8, 
9/10, and 11/13a–c), and these genes are sequentially arranged along the chromo­
some in the same transcriptional orientation, except for the inversion of Hox11/13b.

Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Moreover, recent genomic studies revealed that Hox clusters of the feather star 
Anneissia japonica and the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus possess similar 
gene orders and directions to the A. planci Hox cluster (Zhang et al. 2017; Li et al. 
2018, 2020), suggesting that the significant modification of the Hox cluster occurred 
specifically in the sea urchin clade (Figure 7.3) and thus was not associated with the 
evolution of the pentameral body plan.
Among the known Hox clusters of echinoderms, the feather star A. japonica has 
the largest number of Hox genes, with 12 genes in the cluster, which consist of Hox1-
8, 9/10, and 11/13a–c. This is comparable to the hemichordate Hox cluster (Freeman 
et al. 2012; Li et al. 2020). These genes are sequentially arranged in both the feather 
star and hemichordates. The difference between these species is that Hox11/13b and 
11/13c are inverted in the hemichordate cluster (Freeman et al. 2012), whereas only 
Hox11/13b is inverted in the feather star cluster; thus, the gene order is not modi-
fied in the feather star cluster (Li et al. 2020). The inversion of Hox11/13b has been 
observed in the genomes of sea stars (Baughman et al. 2014), sea urchins (Cameron

colored digits as Hox gene numbers. The colors indicate the following: red/orange–­anterior 
Hox, light green/green–central Hox, blue/purple–posterior Hox, and gray–echinoderm spe-
cific Hox. Black horizontal lines represent chromosomal DNAs, and dashed black lines indi-
cate the unconfirmed parts of the genome structure. Black numbers with vertical lines on the  
phylogenetic tree represent putative evolutionary events in the evolution of the ambulacrar-
ian Hox cluster. Each event is as follows: (1) Inversion of Hox11/13b–11/13c. (2) Evolutionary 
origin of Hox11/13d and 11/13e. (3) Inversion of Hox11/13b. (4) Loss of Hox6. (5) Loss of 
Hox4. (6) Translocation of Hox1–3 to the opposite end of the cluster, including their inversion.  
(7) Inversion of Hox5. Note that the Hox cluster of one of the two sea urchins shown here 
(L. variegatus) is split onto two separate chromosomes (Li et al. 2020). The representative 
species of each clade are Saccoglossus kowalevskii (hemichordate), Anneissia japonica  
(crinoid), Acanthaster planci (asteroid), Ophiothrix spiculata (ophiuroid), Strongylocentrotus 
purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus (echinoid), and Apostichopus japonicus (holothurian).

et al. 2006; Li et al. 2020), and sea cucumbers (Zhang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018). 
This suggests a complete sequential cluster of 12 genes in the common ancestor 
of Ambulacraria and inversion events occurred for Hox11/13b at the base of the 
Echinodermata clade and for Hox11/13b and 11/13c at the base of the Hemichordata 
clade (Figure 7.3).
Hox gene cloning has been conducted in sea urchins other than T. gratilla, S. pur­
puratus, and L. variegatus; including Hox8 of Parechinus angulosus (Pfeffer and 
von Holt 1991), Hox3 of Paracentrotus lividus (Di Bernardo et al. 1994), five Hox 
genes of Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Popodi et al. 1996; Wilson et al. 2005), eight 
Hox genes of Holopneustes purpurescens (Morris et al. 1997; Morris and Byrne 
2005), Hox7 and Hox11/13b of Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus (Ishii et  al. 1999), 
11 Hox genes of Peronella japonica (Hano et al. 2001; Tsuchimoto and Yamaguchi 
2014), and Hox11/13b of Heliocidaris tuberculata (Wilson et al. 2005) (Table 7.1). 
Although the genomic sequences around these Hox genes and their cluster organiza­
tion have not been examined in these species, Hox4 has not been reported in any of 
them. Consistent with this, Hox4 is absent from the Hox cluster of the sea cucumbers 
A. japonicus (Zhang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018) and Holothuria glaberrima (Méndez 
et al. 2000). Considering that Hox4 exists in the crinoids (Hara et al. 2006; Li et al. 
2020) and sea stars (Mito and Endo 1997; Long et al. 2000, 2003; Baughman et al. 
2014), it would be reasonable to conclude that the loss of Hox4 occurred in the com­
mon ancestor of echinoids and holothurians (Figure 7.3).
Hox6 is absent from the A. planci genome (Baughman et al. 2014) and cloned Hox 
genes of other sea stars (Mito and Endo 1997; Long et al. 2000, 2003), suggesting 
the generality of this feature in Asteroidea. Also, although the genomic structures of 
Hox genes are not completely understood for ophiuroids, the absence of Hox6 also 
appears to be the case for brittle stars (Zhang et al. 2017; Szabó and Ferrier 2018), 
suggesting that Hox6 was lost in the common ancestor of asteroids and ophiuroids. 
Sea cucumbers lack Hox6 (Méndez et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018); 
however, this seems to be an independent loss in this lineage, as some sea urchins 
appear to have functional sequences of Hox6 (Dolecki et al. 1988; Ruddle et al. 1994; 
Hano et al. 2001) (Figure 7.3).
Recently, two non-clustered posterior Hox genes (Hox11/13d and 11/13e) were 
found in all echinoderm classes (Szabó and Ferrier 2018). These genes are not found 
in the hemichordates; thus, they are considered to be echinoderm-specific genes 
(Figure 7.3). Further studies are needed to reveal the evolution and function of these 
dispersed Hox genes.
Taken together, the evolution of the Hox cluster in Ambulacraria is thought to be 
as follows: the common ancestor of Ambulacraria might have had a single colinear 
Hox cluster with 12 genes (Figure 7.3). After divergence of the hemichordates, two 
posterior Hox genes (Hox11/13d and 11/13e) emerged, together with the inversion 
of Hox11/13b at an early stage of echinoderm evolution (Figure 7.3, events 2 and 3). 
In the Eleutherozoan clade, Hox6 was lost in the Asterozoa and Holothuroidea 
clades (Figure 7.3, event 4), and Hox4 was lost in the Echinozoa clade (Figure 7.3, 
event 5). Finally, in the Echinoidea clade, Hox5–11/13c was translocated and Hox5 
was inverted (Figure 7.3, events 6 and 7). Given that the difference between the Hox 
clusters of hemichordates and the putative echinoderm ancestor is the inversion of 

152
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Hox11/13b and the emergence of Hox11/13d and 11/13e, these changes seem less 
dramatic than the difference between the Hox cluster of sea urchins and other echi­
noderm classes. Thus, the genomic structure of Hox genes may not be the main 
factor in the evolution of the pentameral body.
7.3  DEVELOPMENTAL FEATURES OF ECHINODERMS 
AND THEIR AXIS FORMATION
As mentioned above, while the adult body plan of many echinoderms is pentameral, 
their larval stages show a bilateral body plan. Figure 7.4 shows the general morphol­
ogy of the larvae of echinoderm classes. In this section, we provide an overview of 
the larval development of echinoderms. Although there are several exceptions in 
each class, echinoderm larvae are roughly classified into two types. The first is the 
“dipleurula” type larva (Semon 1888; Garstang 1894), which shows a bilaterally sym­
metrical body plan and has one or two complex bands of cilia on its body surface that 
usually includes an area surrounding the mouth. The dipleurula-type larvae include 
the auricularia (or dipleurula) larvae of the sea lily crinoid, bipinnaria and brachio­
laria larvae of asteroids, and auricularia larvae of holothurians. The pluteus larvae 
of the ophiuroids and echinoids (which are named ophiopluteus and echinopluteus, 
respectively) and the tornaria larva of the hemichordates are broadly regarded as 
dipleurula-type larvae. The position of mouth and anus varies among these dipleu­
rula-type larva (Figure 7.4). In pluteus larvae, the mouth opens at the anterior side 
of the larval AP axis, which corresponds to the ventral side. The anus first opens 
at the vegetal side and then moves to the ventral side as the pluteus grows, result­
ing in the L-shaped and subsequent U-shaped guts. In bipinnaria and sea cucumber 
auricularia, both mouth and anus open at the ventral side, thus the gut is U-shaped. 
In crinoid auricularia, the position of the mouth is the same as in bipinnaria and sea 
cucumber auricularia, however, the anus does not open until the larva attaches to the 
substrate. The vegetal side corresponds to the posterior side in the crinoid larva, thus 
the coelomic gut resembles an L-shape. The second type of echinoderm larva is the 
doliolaria, which is a barrel-shaped larva with multiple ring-shaped ciliary bands on 
its body surface. The doliolaria-type larva is only found or defined in crinoids, ophi­
uroids, and holothurians, which usually emerge after the dipleurula-type larva with 
rearrangement of the one or two complex bands of cilia into the several ring-shaped 
ciliary bands. Although feather star crinoids do not form dipleurula-type larvae, and 
asteroids and echinoids do not form the doliolaria-type larvae, the developmental 
process with dipleurula-type larvae and doliolaria-type larvae is regarded as a basal 
feature of echinoderm development because this process is shared with sea lily cri­
noids, ophiuroids, and holothurians (Nakano et al. 2003).
The morphological changes that occur to get from the bilateral larvae to the pen­
tameral adult vary among classes and even among species. However, in most cases, 
the rudiments of the pentameral structures are formed at the bilateral larval stages. 
In indirectly developing sea urchins, the pentameral adult rudiment is formed on the 
left side of the bilateral pluteus larva, with the adult oral side adjacent to the larval 
gut and the adult aboral side next to the larval body wall (Figure 7.2A). This type 
of axis reorganization, in which the adult oral-aboral (OA) axis is perpendicular 

153
Hox Genes in Echinoderms
to the larval AP axis, is observed in asteroids and ophiuroids as well as in directly 
developing sea urchins with a non-feeding larva. Meanwhile, the remaining two 
classes show different types of tissue and axis reorganization from larvae to adults. 
In crinoids, bilateral larvae attach to the substrate at the anterior tip of the ventral 
ectoderm, and the mouth opens at the larval posterior side after a 180° rotation of 
mesendodermal structures. Thus, the adult OA axis is reversed relative to the larval 
AP axis. In sea cucumbers, the OA axis is identical to the AP axis in adults, which 
is identical to the larval AP axis.

7.4  EXPRESSION PATTERNS OF HOX GENES IN ECHINODERMS
7.4.1  Temporal Expression Patterns
Temporally sequential expression of Hox genes from the anterior to the posterior 
group is known in some bilaterians. While gene number and structure of the Hox 
cluster are different between echinoderms and other bilaterians that show temporally 
sequential Hox expression, partially sequential expression is observed in a sea lily 
crinoid, Metacrinus rotundus. In M. rotundus, Hox7 is first expressed in the gas­
trula at 40 hours after fertilization (40 h gastrula), followed by Hox8 and Hox9/10 
expression at the 2.2 days hatched (late) gastrula (Hara et al. 2006). The expression 
level of Hox8 is higher than that of Hox9/10 in the hatched gastrula, suggesting the 
temporally sequential expression of Hox7, 8, and 9/10 in the early development of 
M. rotundus.
In other echinoderms, however, no temporal expression patterns of Hox genes 
have been reported to show sequential expression. In the sea urchin S. purpuratus, 
Hox11/13b is the first Hox gene detected at the 12 h late cleavage stage, followed 
by Hox7, which starts its expression at the 24 h mesenchyme blastula stage, and 
Hox2, 3, 5, 8, 9/10, and 11/13a, which start their expression after 2–3 weeks of devel­
opment (Arenas-Mena et al. 1998). In the sea cucumber A. japonicus, Hox11/13a 
and 11/13b are primarily expressed at the 12 h blastula stage, followed by Hox7 and 
8 expression in 20 h hatching embryos, Hox1 and 5 expression at the 24 h gastrula 
stage, and Hox9/10 expression at 3 days in auricularia larvae (Kikuchi et al. 2015). 
The partially sequential expression in a crinoid and the non-sequential expression 
in eleutherozoans suggests the loss of temporal collinearity of Hox genes during the 
evolution of echinoderms.
7.4.2  Spatial Expression Patterns
Spatial expression patterns of the Hox genes have been examined in a crinoid (Hara 
et al. 2006), sea stars (Cisternas and Byrne 2009), sea urchins (Arenas-Mena et al. 
1998, 2000; Peterson et al. 2000; Morris and Byrne 2005, 2014; Tsuchimoto and 
Yamaguchi 2014), and sea cucumbers (Kikuchi et al. 2015).
In the sea star Parvulastra exigua, Hox4 is expressed in developing coeloms in 
the larval stages and presumptive hydrocoel in the rudiment stage (Cisternas and 
Byrne 2009). However, no other Hox genes have been examined for their spatial 
expression, and thus it is difficult to infer the potential roles of Hox genes in AP pat­
terning in the sea star. In an indirectly developing sea urchin, S. purpuratus, Hox7, 
and Hox11/13b are expressed at the early pluteus stage in the posterior and anal 
regions, respectively (Angerer et al. 1989; Arenas-Mena et al. 1998) (Figure 7.5). 
Other examined Hox genes are not expressed at the early developmental stages, indi­
cating that Hox genes are not widely involved in AP patterning during the early 
larval stages of the sea urchin.
Several species show partial sequential expression of Hox genes along the AP 
or OA axis in bilateral larval stages. In the stalked crinoid M. rotundus, four Hox 
genes (Hox5, Hox7, Hox8, and Hox9/10) are expressed sequentially along the AP 
axis in straightened mesodermal somatocoels and their precursors in planktonic 

155
Hox Genes in Echinoderms
preauricularia and auricularia stages (Hara et al. 2006) (Figure 7.5). Hox7 and Hox8 
are expressed in the vegetal half of the closed archenteron of the hatched gastrula, 
which develops into somatocoels in the later stages. In addition, Otx, a gene that 
plays an important role in the development of the anterior central nervous system 
in vertebrates (Acampora et  al. 2001), is expressed in the middle of the closed 
FIGURE 7.5  Spatial expression patterns of Hox genes in echinoderms. In these three classes, 
medial and posterior Hox genes are expressed sequentially in mesendodermal tissues along 
AP or OA axes. Radial (pentameral) Hox expression is observed in the adult rudiment of sea 
urchins. No data is available for the stage after the metamorphosis of Crinoidea. The species 
referred to are Metacrinus rotundus (Crinoidea, Hara et al. 2006), Apostichopus japonicus 
(Holothuroidea, Kikuchi et al. 2015), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (larvae of Echinoidea, 
Arenas-Mena et al. 2000), and Peronella japonica (adult rudiment of Echinoidea, Tsuchimoto 
and Yamaguchi 2014). The Otx expression pattern is shown in Crinoidea (Omori et al. 2011), 
Holothuroidea (Shoguchi et al. 2000), and the adult rudiment of Echinoidea (Tsuchimoto and 
Yamaguchi 2014). Abbreviations: A, anterior; P, posterior; es, enteric sac; sc, somatocoel;

archenteron of the hatched gastrula, anterior to Hox7, and its expression remains in 
the enteric sac of preauricularia and auricularia stages, which develops anterior to 
the somatocoels (Omori et al. 2011). These findings suggest the involvement of these 
medial and posterior Hox genes and Otx in AP patterning of the mesendoderm of 
bilateral M. rotundus larvae.
Similar sequential expression of Hox genes in the mesendoderm has been observed 
in sea urchins, S. purpuratus, and P. japonica, and in the sea cucumber A. japonicus 
(Arenas-Mena et al. 2000; Tsuchimoto and Yamaguchi 2014; Kikuchi et al. 2015). 
S. purpuratus shows the sequential expression of Hox7, 8, 9/10, 11/13a, and 11/13b 
in the somatocoels of an eight-arm pluteus larva. The expression shows a curved 
pattern along the somatocoels, with Hox7 in the most oral region and Hox11/13b 
in the most aboral region (Arenas-Mena et al. 2000) (Figure 7.5). Similar curved 
sequential expression of five medial and posterior Hox genes was observed in the left 
somatocoel of P. japonica larvae (Tsuchimoto and Yamaguchi 2014). In A. japoni­
cus, four Hox genes (Hox7, Hox8, Hox11/13a, and Hox11/13b) are expressed sequen­
tially along the digestive tract in the early larval stages. Hox1 is expressed in the 
endodermal esophagus, which is anterior to the expression area of these four medial 
and posterior Hox genes. In addition, after metamorphosis, eight Hox genes (Hox1, 
Hox5, Hox8, Hox7, Hox9/10, Hox11/13a, Hox11/13b, and Hox11/13c) are expressed 
sequentially along the AP axis in the mesendodermal tissues in doliolaria and pen­
tactula stages (Kikuchi et al. 2015) (Figure 7.5). Moreover, Otx is expressed in the 
buccal cavity (Shoguchi et al. 2000), which is anterior to the Hox1 expressing region. 
Although there are some differences in developmental processes among these spe­
cies, similar sequential expression of medial and posterior Hox genes in mesendo­
dermal tissues indicates the involvement of these genes in the AP or OA patterning 
of mesendoderm in the common ancestor of echinoderms.
In addition to the sequential expression of Hox7, 8, 9/10, 11/13a, and 11/13b in 
somatocoels, Hox1, 3, 5, 11/13b, and Otx are radially expressed in the vestibular 
ectoderm of P. japonica larvae (Tsuchimoto and Yamaguchi 2014) (Figure 7.5). 
Among them, Hox1, 11/13b, and Otx are expressed in the ambulacral region, whereas 
Hox3 and 5 are expressed in the interambulacral region, suggesting the involvement 
of these genes in the development of the ambulacral/interambulacral states. Radial 
expression of Hox3, 5, 11/13b, and Otx was observed in the rudiment stage of other 
directly developing sea urchins, such as H. purpurescens (Morris and Byrne 2005, 
2014). The expression domains of these genes in H. purpurescens are spatially sepa­
rated along the adult OA axis, consistent with a role for these genes in specifying 
OA identity (Morris and Byrne 2014). It has been reported that Hox3 is expressed in 
five patches of cells, in the ventral region of the adult rudiment of an indirect devel­
oper, S. purpuratus (Arenas-Mena et al. 1998), and Hox4 is expressed in a pentamer­
ous pattern in the hydrocoel of the juvenile sea star P. exigua (Cisternas and Byrne 
2009). Although the radial expression of Hox genes has only been reported in sea 
urchins and sea stars, a preliminary study revealed that some Hox genes are radially 
expressed in the juvenile tissues of a feather star (Tsurugaya et al. unpublished), sug­
gesting the involvement of Hox genes in the patterning of pentameral adult tissues.
Taken together, echinoderm ancestors might have two phases of Hox expression 
for patterning their body organization: linear expression along the AP or OA axis 

157

in the mesendoderm of larval stages and radial expression in the adult rudiment. 
Although there are no functional analyses for these Hox genes, these conserved 
expression patterns among certain echinoderm classes suggest the involvement of 
Hox genes in the evolution of pentameral body organization to some extent. Further 
examination of more species with functional analyses will reveal the relationship 
between the two-phase expression of Hox genes and the evolution of echinoderm 
pentameral bodies.

8.1  INTRODUCTION
Although being the most species-rich and morphologically diverse group among 
Spiralia (animals that are thought to have derived from a last common ancestor with 
a spiral mode of cleavage such as Mollusca, Annelida, and Platyhelminthes), mol­
lusks have so far received relatively little attention with respect to studies on Hox 
gene identity and expression. The phylum is composed of two subclades, Conchifera 
(containing Cephalopoda, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Scaphopoda, Monoplacophora) 
and Aculifera (containing Solenogastres or Neomeniomorpha, Caudofoveata or 
Chaetodermomorpha, Polyplacophora) (Figure 8.1; Kocot et al. 2011; Smith et al. 
2011), with a foot as major locomotory organ, a mantle covering the visceral mass, 
a radula, and a tetraneurous nervous system as major morphological landmarks 
(Wanninger and Wollesen 2015). While gastropods such as snails, slugs, and limpets 
together with the bivalves and cephalopods are well-known conchiferan representa­
tives, the tusk-shelled infaunal scaphopods and the cryptic cap-shelled monoplacoph­
orans are far less investigated (Wanninger and Wollesen 2015). This is also true for the 
aculiferans with pronounced anterior-posterior axes (Figure 8.1). Polyplacophorans 
exhibit eight shell plates surrounded by a spicule-bearing girdle, while the worm-
shaped aplacophoran taxa Neomeniomorpha and Chaetodermomorpha are shell-less 
and instead are covered by mineralized spicules (Wanninger and Wollesen 2015; 
Figure 8.1). Most indirect-developing mollusks have a trochophore-like larva, how­
ever, additional secondary larval types such as veliger larvae (Gastropoda, Bivalvia) 
or pericalymma/test-cell larvae (protobranch bivalves, neomeniomorphs) are pres­
ent (Wanninger and Wollesen 2015). Cephalopoda is the only class-level taxon that

exclusively shows direct development. The above-mentioned phenotypic diversity 
renders mollusks an interesting clade to study the role of Hox genes.
Research into characterization and developmental expression of molluscan Hox 
genes largely began at the turn of the century. One of the first studies, on Hox5 
expression in the veliger larva of the vetigastropod Haliotis asinina, concluded that 
Hox genes play a role during the development of the central nervous system (CNS), 
as postulated previously for other spiralian and bilaterian taxa (Giusti et al. 2000). 
Subsequent work revealed that the molluscan Hox complement comprises eleven 
Hox genes (Callaerts et al. 2002; Barucca et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2003; Carpintero 
et al. 2004; Canapa et al. 2005; Pernice et al. 2006; Salamanca-Dìaz et al. 2021). 
Comparative expression studies showed that in cephalopods and gastropods the 
majority of Hox genes is not (only) expressed along the anterior-posterior axis dur­
ing early ontogenesis, but also in specific morphological structures such as the shell, 
foot, prototroch, or the arm crown (see Wanninger and Wollesen 2015 for review). 
Among conchiferan mollusks, a near-to staggered Hox gene expression has only 
been found in scaphopods (Wollesen et  al. 2018) and recently in the gastropod 
Lottia goshimai (Huan et al. 2020), while in bivalves, Hox gene expression appears 
to be restricted to the gastrula and trochophore stage with largely overlapping, 
FIGURE 8.1  With their diverse body plans mollusks are an ideal group to study the role of 
Hox genes in body plan patterning. All groups except for Monoplacophora, Neomeniomorpha, 
and Chaetodermomorpha have been investigated with respect to Hox gene expression.

Hox Genes in Mollusca
non-staggered (and thus also non-collinear) domains. This apparent plasticity of 
Hox expression in Conchifera is in contrast to the situation in the aculiferan clade 
Polyplacophora, which shows a “classic” staggered mode of expression as seen in the 
majority of bilaterian animals (Fritsch et al. 2015; Huan et al. 2020).
In this chapter, we review our current knowledge on the Hox gene complement 
and Hox gene expression in Mollusca and focus particularly on the diversity of 
Hox expression domains in the various class-level sublineages. We also highlight 
the putative involvement of individual Hox genes during ontogenetic establishment 
of key morphological structures, discuss potential evolutionary trends of Hox gene 
expression and function, and highlight crucial questions that may be addressed in 
future studies.
8.2  HOX GENES WITH UNIQUE LOPHOTROCHOZOAN 
IDENTITIES
A group of anterior Hox genes such as Hox1 (Lab), Hox2 (Pb), Hox3 (Zen), Hox4 
(Dfd), and Hox5 (Scr), a central group including Lox5, Hox7, Lox2, and Lox4 as 
well as a posterior paralog group with Post2 and Post1 are common in lophotrocho­
zoans (de Oliveira et al. 2016). The central and posterior Hox genes are character­
ized by distinct lophotrochozoan signature motifs and amino acid residues in the 
homeodomains and their flanking regions (de Oliveira et al. 2016). Accordingly, the 
orthogroups Lox5 (Lox5-parapeptide), Lox2, and Lox4 (Ubd-A-parapeptide) show 
highly conserved C-terminal parapeptide motifs, and Post1 and Post2 exhibit dis­
tinct homeodomain residues (de Rosa et al. 1999; Balavoine et al. 2002; de Oliveira 
et al. 2016). Although the last common molluscan ancestor most likely possessed the 
full complement of eleven Hox genes, certain taxon-specific differences are notable 
(Figure 8.2). For example, while all Hox genes, with the exception of Hox2 and 
Post1, have been identified in the cephalopod Nautilus using the degenerate primer 
approach (Pernice et al. 2006), a recent study on the Nautilus genome proved the 
presence of all eleven Hox genes (Zhang et al. 2021; Figure 8.2). This is an interest­
ing finding since the studied genomes of coleoid cephalopods, i.e., all cephalopods 
except the nautiluses that form the sister clade to the coleoids, do not contain Hox2.
8.3  THE GENOMIC ARRANGEMENT OF HOX GENES
The molluscan genomes investigated so far show various arrangements of Hox genes 
(Figure 8.2). While there is no indication for temporal and spatial collinearity for 
any mollusk investigated so far, both aculiferan genomes from the polyplacophorans 
Acanthopleura granulata and Acanthochitona fascicularis1 exhibit an intact Hox 
gene cluster (Varney et al. 2020; own unpublished data). Conchiferan mollusks show 
a more diverse scenario with species having either an intact or a disrupted Hox clus­
ter (Figure 8.2). Among bivalves, an intact Hox cluster is present in Mizuhopecten 
yessoensis (Wang et al. 2017), Anadara broughtonii (Li et al. 2020), Pecten maximus 
1	 Formerly erroneously identified as Acanthochitona crinita.

(Li et al. 2020), but not in Dreissena rostriformis (Calcino et al. 2019; Salamanca-
Díaz et al. 2021) and various other species (Li et al. 2020). The gastropod Lottia 
gigantea (Li et al. 2020) and Achatina fulica (Li et al. 2020) have an intact Hox 
cluster, while a number of other gastropod species do not (Li et al. 2020). Among 
cephalopods, the giant squid Architeuthis dux exhibits a Hox cluster with interven-
ing non-Hox genes (da Fonseca et al. 2020), while the bobtail squid Euprymna scol-
opes shows a split Hox cluster separated into two parts (Belcaid et al. 2019) and 
the Hox genes of the octopod Octopus bimaculoides are each located on different 
scaffolds (Albertin et al. 2015). Interestingly, the partial Hox cluster of E. scolopes 
exhibits intergenic distances that belong to the largest identified so far in the animal 
FIGURE 8.2  Genomic arrangement of Hox genes in molluscan representatives. Collinearity 
of genomic arrangement and tempo-spatial expression has not been shown for any mollusk 
so far. Hox genes are, however, arranged sequentially on the same scaffold (indicated by a 
continuous horizontal line) in two polyplacophorans, the gastropod Lottia gigantea, and the 
bivalve Mizuhopecten yessoensis. The cephalopod Euprymna scolopes exhibits a partial Hox 
cluster located on two scaffolds, while each Hox gene is situated on its own scaffold in the 
octopod Octopus bimaculoides. No Hox genes have been identified for Monoplacophora and 
only transcriptomic information is known for Neomeniomorpha, Chaetodermomorpha, and 
Scaphopoda (indicated by lack of lines that interconnect Hox genes which are not arranged in  
genomic order). Data on the polyplacophoran Acanthochitona fascicularis from own unpub-
lished data. Other data from Simakov et al. 2013; Albertin et al. 2015; de Oliveira et al 2016; 
Wang et al. 2017; Belcaid et al. 2019; Calcino et al. 2019; Varney et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021. 
Note that information on more gastropod and bivalve species is available (Li et al. 2020). Figure

kingdom (1.5–2 Mb). It has therefore been speculated that these arrangements gave 
rise to unique regulatory mechanisms in cephalopods (Belcaid et al. 2019). No infor­
mation on the genomic arrangement of Hox genes is available for Monoplacophora, 
Scaphopoda, and both aplacophoran clades.
8.4  STAGGERED HOX EXPRESSION IN THE LAST 
COMMON MOLLUSCAN ANCESTOR
Although the first studies on gastropod and cephalopod Hox genes described a non-
staggered (and thus non-collinear) expression in Mollusca, research on the polypla­
cophoran A. fascicularis suggested that at least aculiferan mollusks retained staggered 
Hox gene expression as a plesiomorphic trait (Figure 8.3; Hinman et al. 2003; Lee 
et al. 2003; Fritsch et al. 2015, 2016). A subsequent study on the scaphopod Antalis 
entalis concluded that mid-stage trochophore larvae exhibit a near-to-staggered 
expression in a partially overlapping fashion of all nine Hox genes identified, render­
ing it more likely that the last common ancestor of mollusks exhibited staggered Hox 
expression (Figure 8.3; Wollesen et al. 2018). Developmentally advanced scaphopod 
trochophores also show traces of staggered expression, although here Lox5 and Post1 
do not follow this scheme (similar to Hox3 and Post2 in mid-stage trochophores). 
Notably, all other developmental stages investigated lack apparent hints of staggered 
expression. In polyplacophorans, Hox genes are expressed in a staggered fashion 
in all three germ layers (Fritsch et al. 2015, 2016; Huan et al. 2020). Strikingly, a 
re-evaluation of previous cephalopod data revealed that all Hox genes except for 
Lox5 and Post1 are expressed in a staggered fashion in stage 19/20 embryos, i.e., the 
earliest developmental stage of E. scolopes with distinct anlagen of all major organ 
systems such as the mantle or eyes (Wollesen et al. 2018; Figure 8.3). In E. scolopes, 
all studied Hox genes are expressed in the arms which are sometimes considered 
cephalopod foot homologs and which house the brachial nerve cords. These hints of 
staggered Hox expression are perfectly in accordance with the finding that Hox genes 
are arranged in the expected ancestral order on two scaffolds in E. scolopes (Belcaid 
et al. 2019). Furthermore, a re-evaluation of data on the vetigastropod H. asinina 
(Samadi and Steiner 2009, 2010) suggested that the pre-torsional gastropod veliger 
larva also exhibits traces of staggered Hox expression (Figure 8.3), a finding that has 
been corroborated by the recent data on near-to staggered Hox gene expression of the 
patellogastropod Lottia goshimai (Huan et al. 2020). According to a recent phylo­
genetic analysis, Vetigastropoda and Patellogastropoda form a monophylum and are 
sister to all other gastropods (Angiogastropoda) (Cunha and Giribet 2019), a notion 
calling for studies on Hox expression in the latter neglected clade.
Notably, staggered Hox expression is most visible in the molluscan nervous sys­
tem, an observation that is most evident in the scaphopod A. entalis but also in the 
polyplacophoran Acanthochitona rubrolineata (Wollesen et al. 2018; Huan et al. 
2020). While in the scaphopod, neural Hox gene expression domains are associated 
with distinct ganglia, polyplacophorans exhibit neural Hox expression in their lateral 
and ventral nerve cords as well as in connecting commissures (Fritsch et al. 2015, 
2016; Wollesen et al. 2018; Huan et al. 2020). The vast majority of investigated Hox 
genes of the decapod cephalopod E. scolopes are expressed in the nervous system, 

FIGURE 8.3  Various degrees of staggered Hox gene expression in molluscan developmental

representatives of all class-level taxa investigated to date, except for Bivalvia. The anterior to

Hox Genes in Mollusca
many of them in the developing brachial nerve cords of the arms, but also in individ­
ual ganglia such as the pedal and palliovisceral ganglia (Lee et al. 2003; Table 8.1).
As in other bilaterians, the molluscan anterior Hox genes are not expressed to a 
high degree in the anterior-most body region, but are instead in the hyposphere, i.e., 
the larval region posterior to the prototroch that forms the prospective adult body 
region (Lichtneckert and Reichert 2005; Schiemann et al. 2017). Notably, cepha­
lopods, which do not possess a larval stage, also do not express Hox genes in the 
anterior-most brain region, the cerebral ganglia (Lee et al. 2003). Only scaphopod 
trochophore larvae express the anterior Hox genes Hox1-3 in their anterior-most 
region of the CNS, the cerebral ganglia (Wollesen et al. 2018), a condition that is 
so far only known for the annelid Capitella teleta (Fröbius et al. 2008). Also, some 
central Hox genes are expressed in the episphere in the polyplacophoran A. fascicu­
laris (Lox5) and the gastropod G. varia (Lox5, Lox4, and Lox2) (Samadi and Steiner 
2010; Fritsch et al. 2016).

8.5  HOX GENE EXPRESSION AND MOLLUSCAN 
EVOLUTIONARY NOVELTIES
Although their predominant role is usually considered in defining territories along 
the longitudinal axis of bilaterian animals (including, e.g., specification of segment 
identity in arthropods), Hox genes have also been shown to be expressed during the 
ontogeny of taxon-specific, apomorphic features (often referred to as “morphological 
novelties”) (see respective chapters in this book). Apart from certain neuroanatomi­
cal features (see above for Hox expression in the nervous system; see Hox1 expres­
sion in the cephalopod palliovisceral ganglia in Figure 8.4A), major mollusk-specific 
morphological landmarks where Hox genes are expressed include the external armor 
(shells, plates, spicules; Figure 8.5), the foot, mantle, cephalic appendages (cephalo­
pod arm crown, scaphopod captacula, various tentacles, and lappet-like structures; 
Figure 8.4A–D). In addition, class- and subclass-level features such as the cephalo­
pod funnel, the coleoid ink sac, or the epithelium that gives rise to the larval oper­
culum of gastropods, have also been shown to express certain Hox genes in distinct 
conchiferan clades (Figure 8.4E; see Wanninger and Wollesen 2015 for summary). 
In contrast, polyplacophorans and bivalves show very few signs of Hox gene expres­
sion during development of specific morphological structures. Here, these genes are 
instead broadly expressed in various germ layers (see detailed confocal laser scan­
ning analysis by Fritsch et al. 2015, 2016). In bivalves, Hox expression domains are 
largely restricted to the developing mesoderm, where expression is in overlapping 
domains in a non-staggered manner (Salamanca-Díaz et al. 2021). An exception is 
Hox1 that – congruent with other mollusks – marks the developing bivalve shell field 
(Figure 8.5). In polyplacophorans, Hox genes show clear staggered expression in all 
three germ layers in the larval hyposphere (Fritsch et al. 2015). A relatively large 
comparative body of gene expression data exists for the gastropods, where most Hox 
genes are expressed in distinct organ systems (Giusti et al. 2000; Hinman et al. 2003; 
Samadi and Steiner 2009, 2010; Hashimoto et al. 2012; Huan et al. 2020). Here, sev­
eral Hox genes (Hox2, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5) were found to be expressed in, or close 
to, the region of the developing foot in the patellogastropod Lottia, the vetigastro­
pod H. asinina, and the trochid G. varia (Hinman et al. 2003; Samadi and Steiner 
2009, 2010; Huan et al. 2020) (Figure 8.4E). The mantle shows distinct expression 
domains of Hox4, Hox5, Post1, and Post2 in G. varia only. In the scaphopod A. 
entalis, Hox genes are also prominently expressed in the developing foot, in particu­
lar Hox2, Hox3, Lox5, Lox4, Post1, Post2, while Post1 and Post2 are also found in 
the posterior-most region of the mantle, the scaphopod-specific so-called pavillion 
(Wollesen et al. 2018; Figure 8.4D). Hox4 is expressed in the paired anlage of the 
future captacula, the multiple anterior appendages used to capture prey (Wollesen 
et al. 2018; Figure 8.4B).
Without doubt, the cephalopods are the mollusks that morphologically and devel­
opmentally deviate most widely from a proposed last common molluscan ancestor, 
having evolved a number of striking novel features (Wanninger and Wollesen 2015). 
Interestingly, Hox genes are widely found to be expressed in at least some of these 
evolutionary novelties, such as the arm crown (Hox1, Hox3, Hox5, Hox7, Lox4, Lox5, 
Post1, Post2), the funnel (Hox3, Hox5, Lox4, Lox5), or cephalopod-specific parts

of the nervous system such as the stellate ganglia (Hox1, Hox3, Lox4) (Figure 8.4). 
Even the light organ, a structure that houses photon-emitting bacteria and that is 
found in, e.g., the Hawaiian bobtail squid E. scolopes, was found to express at least 
one Hox gene (Post1) during development.
Interestingly, in the gastropod G. varia Hox genes are also expressed in larval 
features not confined to mollusks alone, such as the prototroch or the apical organ 
(for details and summary, see Wanninger and Wollesen 2015; Wollesen et al. 2018). 
These expression domains, as well as others, e.g., in putative epispheral sensory cells 
of the polyplacophoran A. fascicularis (Figure 8.4F), appear to be highly plastic even 
among closely related taxa (e.g., within Gastropoda), thus calling for more detailed 
analyses using a broader taxon sampling and including more developmental stages 
in order to truly appreciate the full range of involvement of Hox genes in tissue and 
organ system formation of this morphologically diverse phylum.
8.6  HOX GENES PLAY A ROLE IN MOLLUSCAN 
SHELL FORMATION
Early studies on the gastropod H. asinina suggested that Hox genes also play a role 
in shell formation (Hinman et al. 2003). This was confirmed by data on another gas­
tropod, G. varia (Samadi and Steiner 2009), as well as for representatives from other 
class-level taxa, although the individual Hox genes involved and their topographi­
cal position varies between species and/or developmental stages (Figure 8.5). For 
example, Hox1 expression was documented for five different trochophore and veliger 
stages of the gastropod L. goshimai and a trochophore and veliger stage for G. varia 
(Figure 8.5D, G; Samadi and Steiner 2009; Huan et al. 2020). While Hox1 expres­
sion is restricted to cells encircling the shell field in the trochophore of G. varia and 
H. asinina, Hox1 is only expressed in cells of the posterior shell field in L. goshimai 
(Figure 8.5D; Hinman et al. 2003; Samadi and Steiner 2009; Huan et al. 2020). In 
the latter species, Hox7 is only expressed in the shell field, which is not the case in 
G. varia, where Hox7 is instead expressed in the prototroch and velum (Samadi and 
Steiner 2010; Huan et al. 2020).
A taxonomically broader survey demonstrates that almost all Hox genes studied 
by in situ hybridization are expressed at some time during ontogeny in (parts of) the 
shell fields of Polyplacophora and Gastropoda (Figure 8.5D, F, G, I), while only five 
out of nine studied Hox genes are expressed in the shell field of the scaphopod A. 
entalis (Figure 8.5A–C, H), and only three out of eleven Hox genes are expressed in 
the shell fields of the bivalve D. rostriformis (Figure 8.5E; Table 8.2). A Hox gene 
that is consistently expressed in molluscan shell fields, but not in the cephalopod 
shell sac, is Hox1, suggesting that it had a similar expression domain in the last com­
mon ancestor of Aculifera and Conchifera (Figure 8.5A–F).
No single Hox gene has been identified to be expressed in the shell sac of the 
cephalopod E. scolopes. A recent genomic study on Nautilus pompilius revealed that 
Hox4 and Hox5 are expressed in adult mantle tissue, however, it remains unknown if 
their expression domains include shell secreting epithelia (Zhang et al. 2021). Loss 
of Hox2 in E. scolopes, Hox2-4 in O. bimaculoides, and Hox2, Hox4, Hox7 in the 

172

gastropod Aplysia californica (all species that lack an external shell) has been linked 
to shell-loss in these species (Zhang et al. 2021). However, A. californica does form 
an embryonic shell (protoconch I) in the veliger stage that is lost during subsequent 
development, thus raising the question as to what degree embryonic and adult shells 
(teleoconch) may use different regulatory genes during ontogenetic patterning (see 
Salamanca-Diaz et al. 2022).
8.7  CONCLUSION
Molluscan Hox genes share expression domains with other bilaterians (e.g., in the 
nervous system), but have expanded their expression repertoire toward so-called 
morphological novelties such as shell fields, the foot, funnel, and the cephalopod arm 
crown. Comparative data suggest that the last common molluscan ancestor prob­
ably exhibited staggered Hox gene expression, most probably predominantly in the 
nervous system. The expression of Hox1 in the shell fields of all studied mollusks 
except for coleoid cephalopods suggests that this gene probably already patterned 
the shell fields of the last common molluscan ancestor. A number of Hox genes

Hox Genes in Mollusca
have been co-opted into patterning of the shell fields of different taxa, suggesting 
a high plasticity of certain genes. All in all, it appears that Hox gene recruitment 
into taxon-specific morphological features occurred several times independently at 
least within Conchifera. This might have facilitated the evolution of at least some 
morphological novelties on various taxonomic levels such as the conchiferan shell or 
the cephalopod ink sac and arm crown. However, and this holds true for all Hox gene 
expression data available to date, further assessment of this notion depends on func­
tional genetic studies using gene silencing, knockout, or genomic editing techniques. 
Key topics to address these issues include:
•	 Hox gene expression in Chaetodermomorpha, Neomeniomorpha, and 
Monoplacophora.
•	 Assessment of plasticity of Hox gene expression in Mollusca by in-depth 
comparative analysis throughout development.
•	 Do Hox genes also pattern aculiferan spicules and the nautiloid shell?
•	 Functional studies on Hox genes using experimental genetics (gene silenc­
ing, knockdowns, Crispr/Cas technology).
•	 Which effector genes are regulated by Hox genes in Mollusca?
•	 Expression and role of Hox genes in juvenile and adult mollusks as well as 
in pre-trochophore developmental stages.

9.1  INTRODUCTION
After thorough studies in arthropods (Ecdysozoa) and chordates (Deuterostomia), 
a better understanding of the evolution and function of Hox genes in Spiralia—one 
of the three major lineages of bilaterian animals—is beginning to emerge, qualify­
ing, as we will demonstrate in this review many of the previous assumptions about 
the roles of these iconic genes in animal development and evolution. Spiralia (or 
Lophotrochozoa) is a diverse and fascinating clade of animals that comprise an 
incredible diversity of animal forms, from tiny interstitial protostomes (e.g., gastro­
trichs and rotifers) to many worm-shaped creatures (e.g., nemerteans, annelids) and 
shell bearing groups (mollusks and brachiopods). Their last common ancestor also

gave rise to the impressive cephalopods, with a larger body size and complex ner­
vous systems. The Spiralia are, however, keeping the secret of how this morphologi­
cal, functional and ecological diversity evolved, as well as the set of characters that 
were present in their last common ancestor. Given the conserved role of Hox genes 
in patterning animal body plans, it is thus tempting to study the role of these genes 
in Spiralia and the interplay between changes in the genomic organization, regula­
tion and expression of these genes and the diversification of spiralian body plans. An 
extensive body of work has been conducted over the last two decades and the results 
are as diverse as the spiralian body plans themselves. While the first comparative 
studies between fruit flies and vertebrates offered a seemingly consistent pattern of 
Hox gene organization and role during development, the addition of an increasing 
number of spiralian species is delivering a complex, but captivating picture of the 
role of Hox genes in animal evolution. Yet the limited understanding of the internal 
phylogenetic relationships of Spiralia is also complicating this endeavor, sometimes 
hampering the identification of the direction of evolutionary change. Here, we sum­
marize the current knowledge of and more recent findings on the evolution and roles 
of spiralian Hox genes, putting forward some evolutionary conclusions and working 
hypotheses that we hope might help clarify and advance the study of Hox genes in 
this and other animal groups.
9.2  HOX CLUSTER EVOLUTION
The genomic arrangement of Hox genes in some animal lineages is intimately con­
nected to the temporal and spatial expression of these genes during embryogenesis—­
and is known as temporal and spatial collinearity (Duboule 2007, 1994; Ferrier 
and Minguillon 2003; Monteiro and Ferrier 2006). The genomic organization and 
chromatin 3D architecture of the Hox genes influence their expression during devel­
opment. Changes in the complement and genomic linkage of these genes, as well 
as deviation from a temporal/spatial collinearity correlate with morphological and 
developmental evolution in animals (Smith et  al. 2016; Gonzalez, Uhlinger, and 
Lowe 2017; Schiemann et  al. 2017; Mallo 2018; Mallo, Wellik, and Deschamps 
2010). The advent of more affordable, high throughput sequencing technologies has 
facilitated genomic investigations in a broader taxonomic span of spiralian lineages, 
ultimately providing a better-resolved picture of Hox gene evolution in this bilaterian 
clade. Currently, there is transcriptomic and/or genomic data on Hox genes for 11 of 
the 15 major animal groups that comprise Spiralia (Figure 9.1), with data missing for 
Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Gastrotricha and Cycliophora. Together, these 
new datasets clarify the ancestral Hox gene complement of Spiralia—likely com­
prising Hox1/lab, Hox2/pb, Hox3, Hox4/Dfd, Hox5/Scr, Lox5, Antp, Lox4/Lox2 and 
at least one posterior Hox—demonstrating that distinct patterns of central and poste­
rior Hox evolution co-occurred with the phylogenetic split of Spiralia into Gnathifera 
and Lophotrochozoa (Figure 9.1).
Gnathifera comprises Chaetognatha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa and 
Rotifera (Marlétaz et al. 2019; Laumer et al. 2015), but information on Hox comple­
ments and their expression only exists for Chaetognatha and Rotifera (Fröbius and 
Funch 2017; Papillon et al. 2005, 2003; Flot et al. 2013). Our understanding of Hox 

179
The Evolution of Hox Genes in Spiralia
complements in chaetognaths—arrow worms—is currently based on transcriptomic 
data and targeted searches (Papillon et al. 2003), and thus whether Hox genes are 
organized in a cluster in this group is unknown. Genomic data is available for roti­
fers however, indicating that a Hox cluster is absent in this group (Flot et al. 2013), 
which correlates with a lack of temporal and spatial collinear expression of rotiferan 
Hox genes (Fröbius and Funch 2017). Both chaetognaths and rotifers share the pres­
ence of a unique type of Hox gene phylogenetically related to both medial/central 
and posterior Hox genes in other non-gnathiferan taxa, referred to as MedPost genes, 
as well as a unique motif in the Hox6/Lox5 group (Fröbius and Funch 2017; Mauer 
et al. 2021). Other than that, Hox gene complements differ significantly between 
these two lineages, with chaetognaths apparently lacking Hox2 and rotifers missing 
Hox7/Antp, Hox8/Lox4/Lox2 and posterior genes (Figure 9.1). Altogether, the shared 
idiosyncratic signatures of Hox gene complements observed in chaetognaths and 
rotifers back the phylogenetic relationships among gnathiferan clades, suggesting 
that lineage-specific diversification of Hox complements might underpin phenotypic 
evolution in Gnathifera (Fröbius and Funch 2017).
Lophotrochozoa (sensu; Marlétaz et  al. 2019) is the second major lineage of 
spiralian taxa, and its internal phylogenetic relationships are still debated (Kocot 
2016; Kocot et  al. 2017; Marlétaz et  al. 2019; Laumer et  al. 2015; Struck et  al. 
2014). Gastrotricha, Platyhelminthes and Dicyemida have often been related in 
phylogenomic analyses (Struck et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2017). These are molecularly

fast-evolving lineages, which is also reflected in their highly divergent Hox gene 
complements (Figure 9.1). While data for Gastrotricha is absent, genome sequenc­
ing of the dicyemid Dicyema japonicum uncovered only four Hox genes belonging 
to three orthogroups: Hox1, Lox5 and Posterior, with no genomic linkage (Lu et al. 
2019; Zverkov et al. 2019) (Figure 9.1). Platyhelminthes have lost Hox5, Antp and 
Lox2, with recent analysis identifying both Post1—previously thought to be absent 
in flatworms—and Post2 genes in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (Currie 
et al. 2016; Koziol, Lalanne, and Castillo 2009; Barucca, Canapa, and Biscotti 2016) 
(Figure 9.1). Expression data is only available for free-living planarian flatworms, 
which do not exhibit temporal and spatial collinear deployment of Hox genes along 
the anteroposterior axis (Currie et al. 2016). However, planarians exhibit a medial—
instead of anterior—oral opening and lack an anal opening, which are morphologi­
cal divergences along the main body axis that might account for the lack of spatial 
collinearity in Hox genes. Altogether, this data indicates that the evolution of these 
fast-evolving lophotrochozoan lineages appears to correlate with the disintegration 
of the ancestral Hox cluster, the loss of a variable number of Hox genes (followed 
by the duplication of others; Currie et al. 2016) and possibly the loss of spatial col­
linearity (Figure 9.1).
The lophotrochozoan groups Bryozoa, Brachiopoda and Phoronida are often 
grouped within Lophophorata (Marlétaz et al. 2019; Nesnidal et al. 2013; Emig 1984; 
Laumer et al. 2015), with the latter two being the most studied clades. Studies on 
bryozoan genomes are scarce (Rayko et al. 2020) and have not focused on Hox gene 
organization. Transcriptomic and targeted searches have, however, revealed the likely 
loss of several Hox gene classes in this group, including Hox1, Hox5, Antp, Lox4, Lox2 
and potentially Post1 (Passamaneck and Halanych 2004) (Figure 9.1). The absence of 
Lox2 is shared with Phoronida and Brachiopoda (Luo et al. 2018, 2015; Schiemann 
et al. 2017; Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020) (Figure 9.1), however it remains unclear 
whether the gene was lost in the common ancestor of Lophophorates, or originated 
after the split of them from the remaining Lophotrochozoa (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 
2020). Phoronids seem to have lost Post1 and Scr (Luo et al. 2018; Gąsiorowski and 
Hejnol 2020). Regardless of these losses, an ordered Hox cluster appears ancestral for 
both Brachiopoda and Phoronida, with the lineage of the brachiopod Lingula having 
experienced a genomic inversion of the cluster (Luo et al. 2018, 2015; Schiemann et al. 
2017). In some phylogenomic analyses, Nemertea has been related to Brachiopoda 
and Phoronida, in the group Kryptochozoa (Hejnol et al. 2009), yet a more recent 
phylogeny places this group together with Annelida and Platyhelminthes (Marlétaz 
et al. 2019). The nemertean Notospermus geniculatus exhibits expansions of nearly 
all Hox gene classes (Hox1, Hox2, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5 and Post2) and lacks Post1 
and a Hox cluster (Luo et al. 2018). Transcriptomic searches in other nemerteans—­
Pantinonemertes californiensis and Micrura alaskensis—uncovered a more reduced 
complement of Hox genes, which exhibit spatial collinearity during juvenile develop­
ment (Hiebert and Maslakova 2015a, 2015b) (Figure 9.1). Similarly, traces of spatial 
collinearity are observed in Brachiopoda (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019; Schiemann 
et al. 2017) (Figure 9.1), demonstrating that coordinated expression of Hox genes has 
been retained in this spiralian clade—at least during certain stages of their life cycle—
and despite changes in the complement and genomic organization of Hox genes.

The Evolution of Hox Genes in Spiralia
Mollusca and Annelida are two of the most species-rich and morphologically 
diverse spiralian lineages. As the spiralian taxon with most sequenced genomes, 
the evolutionary history of Hox genes in Mollusca is well understood. Chapter 8 
covers this topic in detail, demonstrating that the ancestral molluscan condition 
was an intact Hox gene cluster with at least one copy of each lophotrochozoan Hox 
orthogroup and signs of spatial and sub-cluster temporal collinearity (Wang et al. 
2017; Huan et al. 2019) (Figure 9.1). Interestingly however, closely related mollus­
can species show distinct genomic organizations of Hox genes (e.g., intact vs bro­
ken Hox clusters), indicating that weak selective pressures act on maintaining Hox 
genes clustered in this group. Recently, Entoprocta has been phylogenetically associ­
ated with Mollusca (Marlétaz et al. 2019). Although both genomic information and 
expression data are not available for entoprocts, transcriptomic analyses indicate that 
all lophotrochozoan Hox orthogroups were present in their last common ancestor 
(Merkel et al. 2018) (Figure 9.1). Therefore, if the Mollusca + Entoprocta association 
is true, a full Hox gene repertoire was likely ancestral for this clade.
In Annelida, the species Capitella teleta, Alitta virens, Platynereis dumerilii 
(Kulakova et al. 2007; Fröbius, Matus, and Seaver 2008; Hui et al. 2012) and Owenia 
fusiformis (Martín-Zamora et al. 2022) have complete Hox gene complements and 
exhibit an ordered Hox cluster, except for Post1, which is separate (Figure 9.1). This 
is likely the ancestral annelid condition, and signs of spatial and temporal collinear­
ity have been described for C. teleta, A. virens, P. dumerilii (Fröbius, Matus, and 
Seaver 2008; Bakalenko et al. 2013; Kulakova et al. 2007) (Figure 9.2) and O. fusi­
formis (Martín-Zamora et al. 2022). Similar Hox complements are also observed in 
three lineages of morphologically divergent annelids: Vestimentifera, which have an 
intact Hox cluster but lack Antp (Sun et al. 2021); Dimorphilus gyrociliatus, which 
exhibits an intact Hox cluster lacking Lox2 and Post1 despite its miniaturized genome 
(Martin-Duran et al. 2021); and Echiura (spoon worms) that have a split cluster and 
lack Post1 gene (Wei et  al. 2022). However, Clitellata—leeches, earthworms and 
allies—has divergent Hox complements with both multiple independent duplications 
(e.g., Hox1, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5, Lox5, Lox4, Lox2) and losses (Hox2 and an unclear 
orthology of posterior Hox genes) and no Hox cluster (Simakov et al. 2013; Zwarycz 
et al. 2016). Recently, the parasitic group Orthonectida has been assigned to Annelida 
(Schiffer, Robertson, and Telford 2018). As with the parasitic Dicyemida, orthonec­
tids have a reduced Hox complement only comprising Hox2, Hox4 and an ortholog to 
Lox5/Antp/Hox8/Lox4/Lox2, without a clustered organization (Mikhailov et al. 2016; 
Slyusarev et al. 2020). Therefore, the ancestral annelid condition suggests a genomic 
organization and expression similar to that observed in Mollusca, with subsequent 
morphological and ecological diversification in annelids occurring with either conser­
vation of this Hox arrangement or the complete disintegration of the Hox gene cluster.
In summary, the recent genomic characterization of a broader array of spiralian 
lineages has uncovered two different dynamics of Hox evolution in this group, con­
comitant to the Gnathifera/Lophotrochozoa split (Figure 9.1). The presence of an 
ordered Hox cluster with 11 orthogroups exhibiting spatial collinearity and temporal 
collinearity in blocks—as observed in other major bilaterian lineages—is probably 
ancestral to Lophotrochozoa, yet the poor understanding of the internal phylogenetic 
relationships of this group makes reconstructing the exact evolutionary history of 

182
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Hox genes difficult. Interestingly, Lox2 and Post1 have been repeatedly lost during 
spiralian evolution, which as discussed below might be associated with the cooption 
of these Hox genes to morphological novelties.
9.3  ANCESTRAL AND DIVERGENT ROLES 
OF HOX GENES IN SPIRALIA
Hox genes represent one of the most comprehensively studied families of animal 
transcription factors and their expression has been investigated in numerous Spiralia 
(Barucca, Canapa, and Biscotti 2016), representing diverse evolutionary lineages, 
FIGURE 9.2  Comparison of Hox gene expression in selected spiralian larvae. For each 
larva, the antero-posterior Hox gene expression gradients along the body axis are indicated. 
All larvae are shown from the left side (with exception of Alitta virens, which is shown in 
the dorsal view) with the anterior (apical) side oriented to the top. Note that in brachiopod 
larvae pb, Hox3 and Dfd exhibit staggered A-P expression, while lab is expressed in chaetal 
sacs. In Phoronida and Nemertea, the Hox genes are not expressed in the larval tissues but 
only in the rudiments of adult worms. Additionally, the nemertean Hox genes show staggered 
expression along the A-P axis of the worm rudiment (note that larval and adult body axes are 
not aligned). In the annelid A. virens most of the Hox genes are expressed in colinear manner 
while lab is additionally expressed in the developing parapodia of each segment. In Lottia 
goshimai, Hox genes show spatial collinearity within the ventral neuroectoderm but not in 
the dorsal shell field. See main text for references.

183
The Evolution of Hox Genes in Spiralia
such as flatworms (Currie et al. 2016; Martín-Durán, Amaya, and Romero 2010; 
Arnold et al. 2021), rotifers (Fröbius and Funch 2017), chaetognaths (Papillon et al. 
2005), dicyemids (Kobayashi, Furuya, and Wada 2009), nemerteans (Hiebert and 
Maslakova 2015a, 2015b), lophophorates (Schiemann et al. 2017; Gąsiorowski and 
Hejnol 2019, 2020; Fuchs, Martindale, and Hejnol 2011), annelids (Bakalenko 
et al. 2013; Kulakova et al. 2007; Kulakova et al. 2002; Fröbius, Matus, and Seaver 
2008; Martin-Duran et al. 2021; Irvine and Martindale 2000; Novikova et al. 2013; 
Kourakis et al. 1997, Martín-Zamora et al. 2022; Wei et al. 2022) and mollusks (Lee 
et al. 2003; Samadi and Steiner 2009, 2010; Fritsch et al. 2015; Fritsch, Wollesen, 
and Wanninger 2016; Wollesen et al. 2018; Huan et al. 2019; Salamanca-Díaz et al. 
2021; Hinman et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2017). However, the function of particular 
Hox genes in those studied species is inferred only from expression patterns, since 
among spiralians the functional studies of Hox genes have been conducted thus far 
only on adult planarians (Arnold et al. 2021). The level, to which Hox expression 
has been studied, varies a lot from clade to clade and for some spiralians expression 
of only single orthogroups has been investigated thus far (e.g., for chaetognaths, 
dicyemids and bryozoans), while for others the expression of full, or almost full 
Hox complements has been described throughout several developmental stages (e.g., 
for rotifers, nemerteans, brachiopods, phoronids, annelids and mollusks; Figure 9.2). 
Fortunately, the comprehensively studied species are widely spread across phylog­
eny, which allows insight into evolution of the Hox function in the morphologically 
diverse clade of Spiralia.
In several nemertean and annelid species, Hox genes generally show typical 
staggered expression along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis (Figure 9.2) and 
are expressed predominantly in the ectoderm and developing nervous system 
(Bakalenko et al. 2013; Kulakova et al. 2007; Kulakova et al. 2002; Irvine and 
Martindale 2000; Hiebert and Maslakova 2015a, 2015b; Fröbius, Matus, and 
Seaver 2008; Martin-Duran et al. 2021; Wei et al. 2022), which possibly reflects the 
ancestral Hox expression in Bilateria (Hejnol and Martindale 2009; Fröbius and 
Funch 2017; Deutsch and Le Guyader 1998). Moreover, in the nereid annelids, the 
colinear Hox gene expression is retained in the adult worms, and it has been sug­
gested that during postmetamorphic growth, Hox genes provide positional infor­
mation for the morphologically homonomous segments (Bakalenko et al. 2013) 
and play a role in establishing segmental identity during posterior regeneration 
(Novikova et al. 2013; Kostyuchenko and Kozin 2021; Pfeifer, Dorresteijn, and 
Fröbius 2012). The latter function has also been reported in other annelids based 
on in situ RNA hybridization (de Jong and Seaver 2016) and regeneration stage-
specific transcriptomics (Ribeiro et al. 2019). Traces of the A-P-staggered expres­
sion are also evident in rotifers, where Hox genes are expressed almost exclusively 
in the developing nervous system (Fröbius and Funch 2017). In mollusks, the Hox 
genes seem to have dual functions (Figure 9.2; Huan et al. 2019): several of them 
are expressed in a non-collinear way in the dorsal domain, where they are involved 
in the patterning of the shell field (Huan et al. 2019; Hinman et al. 2003; Samadi 
and Steiner 2009, 2010; Wollesen et al. 2018; Salamanca-Díaz et al. 2021), while 
ventrally they are expressed in the ectoderm, neuroectoderm and mesoderm and, 
at least in some of the developmental stages of some species, they show canonical 
staggered expression along the A-P axis (Fritsch et al. 2015; Fritsch, Wollesen, 

184
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
and Wanninger 2016; Wollesen et al. 2018; Huan et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2017). 
The lophophorates show more derived Hox expression patterns. The Hox genes 
seem to not be expressed in any neural structures neither in phoronids nor bra­
chiopods (which probably correlates with the extensive reduction of the central 
nervous system in those sessile animals) and instead they are expressed in vari­
ous ectodermal and mesodermal domains in a non-collinear manner (Figure 9.2; 
Schiemann et al. 2017; Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019, 2020). Interestingly, three 
Hox genes (pb, Hox3 and Dfd) show staggered mesodermal expression along the 
A-P axis in larval brachiopods (Schiemann et al. 2017), while after metamorphosis 
they are expressed in specific muscles (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019), indicat­
ing co-option of a subset of the Hox gene system into mesodermal A-P speci­
fication in this clade. Additionally, several Hox genes are expressed in specific 
morphological structures of both brachiopods (lab and Post1 in chaetal sacs, Scr 
in shell field; Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019; Schiemann et al. 2017) and phoronids 
(pb in protonephridia and Lox4 at the junction between midgut and proctodeum; 
Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020) suggesting that the Hox genes, released from their 
putative ancestral function in the patterning of neuroectoderm, became widely and 
independently coopted into morphogenesis of various organs in Lophophorata. 
Another interesting example of the evolution of new functions for Hox genes can 
be found in planarians. Although at least HoxD plays a role in the A-P patterning 
during planarian embryogenesis (Martín-Durán, Amaya, and Romero 2010), the 
Hox genes are also widely expressed in the adult worms, some of them in the A-P 
axis and others in radial gradients (Currie et al. 2016). Recently, it has been demon­
strated that Hox genes play a role in the asexual reproduction of S. mediterranea, 
by regulating behavior and tissue segmentation in this well-studied planarian spe­
cies (Arnold et al. 2021).
Altogether, the comparison of Hox gene expression across Spiralia (Figure 9.2) 
shows that unprecedented morphological diversity of this clade correlates well 
with the evolutionary lability of Hox gene expression and function. In several 
spiralian clades, the Hox genes are expressed not only in ectoderm, but also in 
the mesoderm and its derivatives. However, a detailed comparison of mesodermal 
Hox expression shows that the set of Hox genes expressed in the mesodermal 
derivatives differs markedly from clade to clade and that their temporal tran­
scription in the mesodermal tissues can occur at very different developmental 
stages. Therefore, it remains likely that Hox genes became co-opted indepen­
dently many times into patterning of the mesoderm and its derivatives in Spiralia 
(Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019, 2020). Clades that exhibit canonical expression of 
Hox genes along the A-P axis also seem to retain the ancestral function of Hox 
genes in the patterning of ectoderm and central nervous system. On the other 
hand, the co-option of Hox genes into morphogenesis of novel structures or regu­
lation of postembryonic processes exemplifies evolution of new, less constrained 
functionalities for the Hox system in Spiralia. In the case of lophophorates, the 
evolutionary reduction of the central nervous system correlates with the diver­
sification of functions of particular Hox genes within this clade. However, the 
processes that favored analogous evolutionary trends in other spiralians remain 
largely unknown.

185
The Evolution of Hox Genes in Spiralia
9.4  HOX GENES AND SPIRALIAN NOVELTIES
The co-option of Hox genes into the morphogenesis of particular structures and 
organs is an important evolutionary mechanism well studied in numerous animals. 
The Hox genes might be re-wired into patterning of the pre-existing organs but they 
can also contribute to the origin of morphologically and molecularly novel struc­
tures, the so-called evolutionary novelties (Müller and Wagner 1996; Wagner and 
Lynch 2010). The latter, as evident from the preceding summary of the Hox expres­
sion in Spiralia, is also a widespread phenomenon in this animal clade. The most 
famous examples of Hox gene co-option into spiralian morphological novelties can 
be found in mollusks, where Hox genes have been co-opted into patterning of the 
shell in Conchifera (Samadi and Steiner 2009, 2010; Hinman et al. 2003; Huan et al. 
2019; Salamanca-Díaz et al. 2021; Wollesen et al. 2018) and subsequently into pat­
terning of brachial crown, funnel tube and stellate ganglia in cephalopods (Lee et al. 
2003). Since a separate chapter of this book is devoted to the evolution of the Hox 
genes and their function in mollusks (see Chapter 8), we focus here on other, less-
acknowledged examples of Hox co-option into spiralian evolutionary novelties.
The hard, external shell is a hallmark of the mollusk body plan, however, a simi­
lar structure evolved independently also in lophophorates and is present in all extant 
brachiopod species. The investigation of Hox gene expression in larval, juvenile and 
adult brachiopods showed that the Hox gene Scr is expressed in the epithelial cells 
that produce both larval (Schiemann et al. 2017) and adult shell (Luo et al. 2015; 
Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019), indicating that Scr has been co-opted for the pattern­
ing of the shell-forming epithelium in brachiopods. Even though extant phoronids, 
the other lophophorates, for which Hox gene complement and expression have been 
studied, lack any shell-like structures, their closest known fossil relative, a tommotid 
Eccenthrotheca, possessed a hard mineralized exoskeleton, which reinforced a tube 
in which the animal dwelled (Skovsted et al. 2008, 2011). This indicates that the 
biomineralization capacities have been lost in the lineage of phoronids, which coin­
cides with the absence of Scr in the otherwise well-conserved phoronid Hox cluster 
(Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020; Luo et al. 2018).
Hox expression studies in annelids revealed that expression of Post1 deviates 
from the neuroectodermal A-P expression witnessed for other Hox genes and instead 
the gene is expressed in the developing chaetal sacs (Fröbius, Matus, and Seaver 
2008; Kulakova et al. 2007; Kulakova et al. 2002), the morphological structures 
that secrete chaetae—stiff bristles used by annelids for locomotion and protection. 
Expression of Post1 in the chaetae-related territories has also been reported in bra­
chiopods (Schiemann et al. 2017; Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2019) in concert with the 
morphology-based hypothesis on the homology of chaetae in both clades (Gustus 
and Cloney 1972; Lüter 2001; Hausam and Bartolomaeus 2001). In brachiopods, 
another Hox gene, lab, is also expressed in the chaetal sacs (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 
2019; Schiemann et al. 2017), however, this co-option seems to be restricted only to 
the brachiopod lineage. Since chaetae-like structures are also present in some fossil 
mollusks (Thomas, Runnegar, and Matt 2020), it seems plausible that chaetae were 
already present in the last common ancestor of annelids, mollusks and brachiopods 
and that Post1 was already co-opted for the patterning of the chaetal sacs in the 

186
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
lineage leading to this hypothetical ancestral animal. Interestingly, Post1 is miss­
ing from the genomes of phoronids (Luo et al. 2018; Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020), 
which—according to this evolutionary scenario—have secondarily lost the chaetae 
forming apparatus. This suggests that the gene, and the morphological structure pat­
terned by it, had been lost in unison in the phoronid lineage.
Another possible example of co-option of Hox genes into patterning of evolution­
ary novelties can be found in the serpulid annelid, Spirobranchus lamarcki. As for 
other Serpulidae, S. lamarcki possess an operculum—an unpaired head appendage 
with a biomineralized shield used to plug the tube where the worm dwells (Bok 
et al. 2017). The operculum is considered an evolutionary novelty of serpulids and 
many species are capable of its regeneration. Analysis of gene expression during 
operculum regeneration in S. lamarcki indicates that among many homeotic genes 
expressed in the regenerating organ, there is also a Hox gene Antp (Barton-Owen 
et al. 2018). While the role of Antp in operculum formation is still unclear, these 
observations highlight the plasticity of Hox gene expression in spiralians, even in 
those clades exhibiting a marked and conserved spatial collinearity.
As Hox expression is studied in more spiralian species in the future, additional 
examples of Hox cooption into patterning of morphological novelties are expected to 
be found. However, even those which are currently known, help to understand evolu­
tion of such important spiralian novelties as shells or chaetae. Combination of Hox 
expression studies, comparative morphology and paleontology provides a compre­
hensive picture of evolution of these complex characters and points toward possible 
evolutionary mechanisms which lead to the reduction of morphological characters in 
certain clades. Most importantly, the functional analyses, using e.g., RNAi or CRISPR 
gene editing, are still needed to confirm that expression of particular Hox genes in the 
developing morphological structures is really indispensable for their morphogenesis.
9.5  HOX GENES AND LIFE HISTORY STAGES
Studies of Hox gene expression during development of animals with complex life 
cycles can also inform about the evolution of life histories (Hejnol and Vellutini 
2017). Spiralia are a particularly interesting clade in this respect, since many of them 
develop through distinct larval types (Haug 2020; Wanninger 2015), some of which 
represent clade-specific innovations (e.g., pilidium of pilidiophoran nemerteans, 
actinotrocha of phoronids or mitraria of oweniid annelids), while others are highly 
conserved over long phylogenetic distances (e.g., trochophore present in numerous 
annelids, kamptozoans and mollusks).
In the pilidiophoran nemertean Maculaura (Micrura) alaskensis, the Hox genes are 
not expressed until late developmental stages when their expression is initiated in the 
ectodermal rudiments, from which the juvenile worm develops (Figure 9.2; Hiebert 
and Maslakova 2015b). Comparison of Hox gene expression between M. alaskensis 
and the direct developing hoplonemertean P. californiensis showed that juveniles of 
both species are patterned in a similar way, while the pilidial development represents 
the derived condition (Hiebert and Maslakova 2015a). This observation, combined 
with other gene expression studies and phylogenetic distribution of pilidium larvae, 
indicates that the pilidium represents a new body plan likely intercalated into an 

187
The Evolution of Hox Genes in Spiralia
ancestral, more direct nemertean life cycle (Hiebert and Maslakova 2015a, 2015b). 
Since Hox genes were already used for the patterning of the adult body plan, another, 
yet unknown, molecular system had to be deployed in the pilidiophoran ancestor for 
the patterning of this new life stage (Hiebert and Maslakova 2015b).
Hox genes are also not expressed during the development of the actinotrocha, the 
highly specialized phoronid larva (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020). Their expression is 
delayed until later larval stages with most of the Hox genes being expressed in the rudi­
ment of the adult trunk and in other posterior structures, which contribute to the adult 
body after metamorphosis (Figure 9.2). A similar expression dynamic of Hox genes 
is observed in the mitraria larva of the palaeoannelid O. fusiformis (Martín-Zamora 
et al. 2022), which also undergoes catastrophic metamorphosis (Wilson 1932). The 
broad expression of head-specific genes in the larval phoronid indicates that the acti­
notrocha represents a so-called head-larva (Gąsiorowski and Hejnol 2020). This would 
explain why the actinotrocha forms without input from the Hox patterning system—in 
many animals Hox gene expression is restricted to the post-head body regions, while 
heads develop from the anterior, Hox-free territory (Gonzalez, Uhlinger, and Lowe 
2017; Hiebert and Maslakova 2015a; Luo et al. 2018; Lowe et al. 2003; Steinmetz et al. 
2010; Aronowicz and Lowe 2006). The evolution of new larval types by precocious 
development of head structures or delayed development of the trunk has been pro­
posed for several other animal clades, e.g., crustaceans and hemichordates (reviewed 
recently in Strathmann 2020). In the latter clade, the tornaria larva also develops with­
out expression of Hox genes, which become activated only after onset of the trunk 
development (Gonzalez, Uhlinger, and Lowe 2017), showing convergent expression 
dynamics of Hox genes between indirectly developing hemichordates and phoronids.
Lack of Hox gene expression during development of pilidium, actinotrocha and 
mitraria contrasts with the regular Hox expression in larval brachiopods (Schiemann 
et al. 2017) and trochophores of mollusks and annelids (Samadi and Steiner 2010; 
Fritsch et al. 2015; Fritsch, Wollesen, and Wanninger 2016; Wang et al. 2017; Huan 
et al. 2019; Kulakova et al. 2007; Salamanca-Díaz et al. 2021), in which both larval 
and adult bodies exhibit similar Hox gene patterns. The fact that those larvae are 
patterned by the conserved Hox system, as well as their phylogenetic distribution, 
suggest that all of those larval stages are eventually derived from the ancestral larval 
type present in the last common lophotrochozoan ancestor. Therefore, the future 
investigation of Hox gene expression during embryonic and larval development of 
other indirectly developing spiralians could help to resolve whether their larvae rep­
resent modification of the ancestral spiralian larva or more recent evolutionary inno­
vations resulting from the intercalation of new head-larvae. This would be especially 
interesting in the cases of some strange spiralian larvae, whose evolution and homol­
ogy to the other larval types remain obscure, such as the Müller’s larva of polyclads, 
creeping larva of kamptozoans or cyphonautes of gymnolaemate bryozoans.
9.6  CONCLUSIONS
A high conservation of Hox clusters in some lineages together with the dissociation 
of the cluster and loss of certain genes in some sublineages characterizes the evolu­
tion of Hox genes in Spiralia. It remains unclear however, which forces prevent the 

188
Hox Modules in Evolution and Development
Hox cluster from atomizing in this animal group, yet genome regulatory aspects have 
likely played a major role. Despite the conservation of the Hox cluster in major spi­
ralian lineages, neofunctionalization of Hox genes—even of those existing as single 
copies—is not uncommon. Therefore, Hox genes are often used for axial patterning, 
but also deployed in novel structures in later stages of development. Contrary to what 
is generally observed in arthropods and chordates, spiralians exhibit many cases 
in which Hox clusters repeatedly disintegrate without reproducible patterns, nor 
are Hox genes connected to specific germ layers, body regions or cell types. When 
looking at the life cycle, many spiralian larvae do not involve Hox genes in their 
patterning, or if they do, then only in tissues that are transferred to the adult body 
plan during metamorphosis. Together, the evolution and diversification of Spiralia 
for more than 500 million years is a showcase of Hox gene evolution, where defining 
a general pattern is difficult. Moreover, Spiralia teaches us a lesson about the impor­
tance of using more taxon sampling to test—and sometimes reject—­hypotheses 
based on observations on a few animal lineages. In this context, the diverse patterns 
of Hox expression and genomic organization that we find in Spiralia provide a novel 
resource to discover new mechanisms of genome regulation and organization and 
the interplay between the two, along with the correlation of these phenomena with 
morphological evolution.
