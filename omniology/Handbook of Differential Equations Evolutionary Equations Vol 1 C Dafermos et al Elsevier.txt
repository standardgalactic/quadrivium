Preface
The aim of this Handbook is to acquaint the reader with the current status of the theory
of evolutionary partial differential equations, and with some of its applications. This is
not an easy task: Unlike other mathematical theories which exhibit a tree-like structure,
with clearly distinguishable trunk, main and secondary branches, the theory of partial dif-
ferential equations has the appearance of a bush with very complex structure. Its roots as
well as its ﬂowers are often related to the physical world, and it is fertilized by ideas and
techniques borrowed from virtually every other area of mathematics.
Evolutionary partial differential equations made their ﬁrst appearance in the 18th cen-
tury, in the endeavor to understand the motion of ﬂuids and other continuous media. It is
remarkable that this research program is still ongoing and many fundamental questions
remain unanswered. Beyond this area, however, evolutionary partial differential equations
have become ubiquitous, as they seem to govern the dynamics of any physical, chemical
biological, ecological or economic system whose state is described by spatially depen-
dent variables.
The active research effort over the span of two centuries, combined with the wide vari-
ety of physical phenomena that had to be explained, has resulted in an enormous body of
literature. Any attempt to produce a comprehensive survey would be futile. The aim here is
to collect review articles, written by leading experts, which will highlight the present and
expected future directions of development of the ﬁeld. The emphasis will be on nonlinear
equations, which pose the most challenging problems today. The various articles will offer
the reader the opportunity to compare and contrast the behavior of hyperbolic and parabolic
equations. Hyperbolic equations are typically associated with media exhibiting “elastic”
response, and encompass the notoriously difﬁcult class of “hyperbolic conservation laws”.
Parabolic equations are associated with various diffusive mechanisms. An extremely im-
portant and challenging example is the Navier–Stokes equation.
Volume I of this Handbook will focus on the abstract theory of evolutionary equations,
addressing questions of existence, uniqueness and other general qualitative properties of
solutions. Future volumes will consider more concrete problems relating to speciﬁc appli-
cations. Our hope is that the handbook will provide a panorama of this amazingly complex
and rapidly developing branch of mathematics.

Abstract
This is a survey on recent developments of the theory of one-parameter semigroups and
evolution equations with special emphasis on functional calculus and kernel estimates. Also
other topics as asymptotic behavior for large time and holomorphic semigroups are discussed.
As main application we consider elliptic operators with various boundary conditions.

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
3
Introduction
The theory of one-parameter semigroups provides a framework and tools to solve evolu-
tionary problems. It is impossible to give an account of this rich and most active ﬁeld.
In this chapter we rather try to present a survey on a particular subject, namely functional
calculus, maximal regularity and kernel estimates which, in our eyes, has seen a most
spectacular development, and which, so far, is not presented in book form. We comment
on these three subjects:
1. Functional calculus (Section 4).
If A is a self-adjoint operator, one can deﬁne f (A)
for all bounded complex-valued measurable functions deﬁned on the spectrum of A. It was
McIntosh who initiated and developed a theory of functional calculus for a less restricted
large class of operators, namely sectorial operators; i.e., operators whose spectrum is in-
cluded in a sector and whose resolvent satisﬁes a certain estimate. Negative generators
of bounded holomorphic semigroups are sectorial operators and are our main subject of
investigation. And indeed, for these operators f (A) can be deﬁned for a large class of
holomorphic functions deﬁned on a sector containing the spectrum. Taking f (z) = e−tz
leads to the semigroup e−tA, the function f (z) = zα to the fractional power of such an
operator A. One important reason to study functional calculus is the Dore–Venni theorem.
In its hypotheses functional calculus plays a role; the conclusion is the invertibility of the
sum of two operators A and B. Thus, the Dore–Venni theorem asserts that the equation
Ax + Bx = y
has a unique solution x ∈D(A)∩D(B). To say that the solution is at the same time in both
domains can be rephrased by saying that the solution has “maximal regularity”, a crucial
property in many circumstances.
2. Form methods (Section 5).
On Hilbert space the functional calculus behaves particu-
larly well as we show in Sections 4 and 5. Most interesting is the close connection with
form methods. Basically, the following is true: an operator is associated with a form if
and only if it has a bounded H ∞-calculus. Form methods, based on the fundamental Lax–
Milgram lemma, allow a most efﬁcient treatment of elliptic and parabolic problems as we
show later.
3. Maximal regularity and Fourier transform (Section 6).
The following particular prob-
lem of maximal regularity is important for solving nonlinear equations: The genera-
tor A of a semigroup T is said to have property (MR) if T ∗f ∈W 1,2((0,1);X) for
all f ∈L2((0,1);X). On Hilbert spaces every generator of a holomorphic semigroup
has (MR); but a striking result of Kalton–Lancien asserts that this fact characterizes
Hilbert spaces (among a large class of Banach spaces). On the other hand, in recent
years it has been understood which role “unconditional properties” play for operator-
valued Fourier transform and Cauchy problems. So one may characterize property (MR)
by R-boundedness, a property deﬁning “unconditional boundedness” of sets of operators.

4. Kernel estimates (Section 7).
Gaussian estimates for the kernels of parabolic equations
have been investigated for many years. It is most interesting in its own right that the solu-
tions of a parabolic equation with measurable coefﬁcients are very close to the Gaussian
semigroup. But Gaussian estimates have also striking consequences for the underlying
semigroup. For example, we show that they do imply boundedness of the H ∞-calculus.
5. Elliptic operators (Section 8).
The theory presented here can be applied to elliptic op-
erators with measurable coefﬁcients to which Section 8 is devoted. We will explain Kato’s
square root problem, the most difﬁcult question of coincidence of form domain and the
domain of the square root, which has been solved recently by Auscher, Hofmann, Lacey,
McIntosh and Tchamitchian.
We start the chapter by putting together some basic properties of semigroups which
are particularly useful in the sequel. Special attention is given to holomorphic semigroups
(Section 2) and to the theory of asymptotic behavior (Section 3). As prototype example
in this account serve the Laplacian with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions:
On spaces of continuous functions this operator will be considered in Section 2, later its
Lp-properties are established. Concerning the results on asymptotic behavior we concen-
trate on those which can be applied to parabolic equations in Section 8.
Most of the results are presented without proof, referring to the literature. Frequently,
only particular cases which are easy to formulate are presented; and in a few cases we give
proofs. Some of them are new, not very well known or particularly elegant. The article
presents a special choice, guided by personal taste, even in this narrow subject. We hope
that the numerous references allow reader to go beyond that choice and that the list of
monographs at the end helps them to view the subject in a broader context.
1. Semigroups
In this introductory section we present semigroups from three different points of view.
We mention few properties but refer to the various text books concerning the theory.
1.1. The algebraic approach
Let X be a complex Banach space, let C(R+,X) be the space of all continuous functions
deﬁned on R+ := [0,∞) with values in X. A C0-semigroup is a mapping T :R+ →L(X)
such that
(a) T (·)x ∈C(R+,X) for all x ∈X;
(b) T (0) = I;
(c) T (s + t) = T (s)T (t), s,t ∈R+.
Given a C0-semigroup T on X, one deﬁnes the generator A of T as an unbounded operator
on X by
Ax = lim
t↓0
T (t)x −x
t

with domain D(A) := {x ∈X: limt↓0 T (t)x−x
t
exists}. Then D(A) is dense in X and A is
closed and linear. In other words, A is the derivative of T in 0 (in the strong sense) and for
this reason one also calls A the inﬁnitesimal generator of T .
The second approach involves the Cauchy problem.
1.2. The Cauchy problem
Let A be a closed linear operator on X. Let J ⊂R be an interval. A mild solution of the
differential equation
˙u(t) = Au(t),
t ∈J,
(1.1)
is a function u(t) ∈C(J,X) such that
 t
s u(r)dr ∈D(A) for all s,t ∈J and A
 t
s u(r)dr =
u(t) −u(s). A classical solution is a function u ∈C1(J,X) such that u(t) ∈D(A) and
˙u(t) = Au(t) for all t ∈J. Since A is closed, a mild solution u is a classical solution if and
only if u ∈C1(J,X).
THEOREM [[ABHN01], 3.1.12]. Let J = [0,∞). The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) A generates a C0-semigroup T ;
(ii) for all x ∈X, there exists a unique mild solution u of (1.1) satisfying u(0) = x.
In that case u(t) = T (t)x, t ⩾0.
The theorem implies in particular that the generator A determines uniquely the semi-
group. Here is the third approach.
1.3. Semigroups and Laplace transforms
Let T be a C0-semigroup with generator A. Then the growth bound
ω(T ) := inf

ω ∈R: ∃M such that
T (t)
 ⩽Meωt for all t ⩾0

satisﬁes −∞⩽ω(T ) < ∞, and if λ ∈C, Reλ > ω(T ), then λ is in the resolvent set ρ(A)
of A and
R(λ,A)x =
 ∞
0
e−λtT (t)x dt := lim
τ→∞
 τ
0
e−λtT (t)x dt
for all x ∈X, where R(λ,A) = (λ −A)−1.
THEOREM [[ABHN01], Theorem 3.1.7, p. 113]. Let T :R+ →L(X) be strongly continu-
ous. Let A be an operator on X, λ0 ∈R such that (λ0,∞) ⊂ρ(A) and
R(λ,A)x =
 ∞
0
e−λtT (t)x dt,
λ > λ0,

6
W. Arendt
for all x ∈X. Then T is a C0-semigroup and A its generator.
Thus generators of C0-semigroups are precisely those operators whose resolvent is a
Laplace transform. Laplace transform techniques play an important role in semigroup the-
ory (see [[ABHN01]] for a systematic theory).
1.4. More general C0-semigroups
In order to talk about Dirichlet boundary conditions we need more general semigroups (cf.
Section 2.5). A strongly continuous function T :(0,∞) →L(X) is called a (nondegenerate
locally bounded) semigroup if
(a) T (t)T (s) = T (t + s), t,s > 0;
(b) sup0<t⩽1 ∥T (t)∥< ∞;
(c) T (t)x = 0 for all t > 0 implies x = 0.
As a consequence ω(T ) < ∞and there exists a unique operator A such that (ω(T ),∞) ⊂
ρ(A) and R(λ,A)x =  ∞
0 e−λtT (t)x dt for all x ∈X and λ > ω(T ). We call A the gener-
ator of T (see [[ABHN01], 3.2]). Then T is a C0-semigroup if and only if D(A) = X. If
X is reﬂexive, then this is automatically true.
1.5. The inhomogeneous Cauchy problem
If A generates a C0-semigroup T , then also the inhomogeneous Cauchy problem
 ˙u(t) = Au(t) + f (t),
t ∈[0,τ],
u(0) = x
(1.2)
is well posed. More precisely, let x ∈X, f ∈L1((0,τ);X). A mild solution of (1.2) is a
continuous function u:[0,τ] →X such that
 t
0 u(s)ds ∈D(A) and
u(t) −x = A
 t
0
u(s)ds +
 t
0
f (s)ds
for all t ∈[0,τ]. Deﬁne T ∗f by T ∗f (t) =
 t
0 T (t −s)f (s)ds.
PROPOSITION. The function u given by u(t) = T (t)x + T ∗f (t) is the unique mild solu-
tion of (1.2).
1.5.1. Classical solutions.
Thus, in the particular case where x = 0, the mild solution
of (1.2) is u = T ∗f . It is very rare that this u is a classical solution for all f . Let T be
a C0-semigroup on X with generator A.
THEOREM (Baillon; see [EG92]). Assume that X is reﬂexive or X = L1 (or more generally
that c0 ̸⊂X). If for all f ∈C([0,τ];X) one has T ∗f ∈C1([0,τ],X), then A is bounded.

2. Holomorphic semigroups
A semigroup T :(0,∞) →X (in the sense of Section 1.4) is called holomorphic if there
exists θ ∈(0,π/2] such that T has a holomorphic extension T :Σθ →L(X) which is
bounded on {z ∈Σθ: |z| ⩽1}. In that case, this holomorphic extension is unique and
satisﬁes T (z1 + z2) = T (z1)T (z2) for all z1,z2 ∈Σθ. If T is a C0-semigroup, then
lim
z→0
z∈Σθ
T (z)x = x
for all x ∈X, and we call T a holomorphic C0-semigroup. If the extension T is bounded
on Σθ, we call T a bounded holomorphic semigroup. Thus, for this property, it does not
sufﬁce that T is bounded on [0,∞). Take for example, T (t) = eit on X = C.
2.1. Characterization of bounded holomorphic semigroups
Let A be an operator on X. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) A generates a bounded holomorphic semigroup T ;
(ii) one has λ ∈ρ(A) whenever Reλ > 0 and supReλ>0 ∥λR(λ,A)∥< ∞;
(iii) there exists α ∈(0,π/2) such that e±iαA generates a bounded semigroup.
In that case (T (e±iαt))t⩾0 is the semigroup generated by e±iαA. Moreover, T is a
C0-semigroup if and only if D(A) is dense. This is automatic whenever X is reﬂexive.
2.2. Characterization of holomorphic semigroups
An operator A generates a holomorphic semigroup T if and only if there exists ω such that
A −ω generates a bounded holomorphic semigroup S. In that case T (t) = eωtS(t), t ⩾0.
2.3. Boundary groups
Let A be the generator of a C0-semigroup T having a holomorphic extension to the
half-plane C+ = {λ ∈C: Reλ > 0}. Then iA generates a C0-group U if and only if
supRez>0,|z|⩽1 ∥T (z)∥< ∞.
In that case we call U the boundary group of T and write U(s) =: T (is), s ∈R.

2.4. The Gaussian semigroup
Consider the Gaussian semigroup G deﬁned on L1 + L∞:= L1(Rn) + L∞(Rn) by
G(z)f 	(x) = (4πz)−n/2

Rn f (y)e−(x−y)2/4z dy
(2.1)
for all x ∈Rn, f ∈L1 + L∞, Rez > 0. Then G is a holomorphic semigroup which is
bounded on Σθ for each 0 < θ < π/2. The generator 1+∞of G is given by
D(1+∞) =

f ∈L1 + L∞: f ∈L1 + L∞
,
1+∞f = f
in D

Rn	′.
Let E be one of the spaces Lp(Rn), 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, Cb(Rn) = {f ∈L∞(Rn): f is
continuous};
BUCRn	 := f ∈CbRn	: f is uniformly continuous,
C0

,
which are all subspaces of L1 + L∞. Then the restriction G(t)|E deﬁnes a holomorphic
semigroup GE on E which is bounded on Σθ for each θ ∈(0,π/2). Its generator is E
given by
D(E) = {f ∈E: f ∈E},
Ef = f
in D

Rn	′.
On E = Lp(Rn), 1 ⩽p < ∞, BUC(Rn) and C0(Rn) the semigroup GE is a C0-semi-
group.
2.5. The Dirichlet Laplacian
In this section we introduce the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
space C( 
Ω). It is a most basic example and we show in an elementary way that it gen-
erates a holomorphic semigroup.
Let Ω ⊂Rn be open and bounded. We assume that Ω is Dirichlet regular; i.e., for all
ϕ ∈C(∂Ω) there exists a solution of
D(ϕ)
h ∈C
 
Ω
	
,
h|∂Ω = ϕ,
h = 0
in D(Ω)′.
Such a solution is unique and automatically in C∞(Ω). If Ω has Lipschitz boundary, then
Ω is Dirichlet regular, but much milder geometric assumptions sufﬁce (see, e.g., [[DL88],

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates

Chapter II]). We consider the operator A deﬁned on C( 
Ω) by
D(A) =

u ∈C0(Ω): u ∈C
 
Ω
	
,
Au = u
in D(Ω)′,
where C0(Ω) := {u ∈C( 
Ω): u|∂Ω = 0} and D(Ω)′ denotes the space of all distributions.
We call A the Dirichlet Laplacian on C( 
Ω).
THEOREM. The operator A generates a bounded holomorphic semigroup T on C( 
Ω).
For the proof we need the following form of the maximum principle.
MAXIMUM PRINCIPLE. Let v ∈C( 
Ω) such that λv −v = 0 in D(Ω)′, where Reλ > 0.
Then
sup
x∈∂Ω
v(x)
 = sup
x∈
Ω
v(x)
.
PROOF. Suppose that ∥v∥L∞(Ω) > supx∈∂Ω |v(x)|. Let K := {x ∈Ω: |v(x)| = ∥v∥∞} and
vε = ρε ∗v, where ρε is a molliﬁer. Then vε →v, vε = ρε ∗v →v uniformly on
compact subsets of Ω as ε ↓0. Let Ω1 ⊂Ω be relatively compact such that K ⊂Ω1 and

Ω1 ⊂Ω. Then, for small ε > 0, there exists xε ∈Ω1 such that |vε(xε)| = supx∈Ω1 |vε(x)|.
Then
Revε(xε)vε(xε) ⩽0.
(2.2)
In fact, consider the function f (y) = Revε(y)vε(xε). Then f has a local maximum in xε.
Hence f (xε) ⩽0. Let xεn →x0. Since vεn →v uniformly on Ω1, it follows that x0 ∈K.
From (2.2) we deduce that Re[v(x0)v(x0)] ⩽0. Hence,
Reλ
v(x0)
2 ⩽Reλ
v(x0)
2 −Rev(x0)v(x0)
= Re

v(x0)

λv(x0) −v(x0)
	
= 0.
Since x0 ∈K, it follows that v = 0, contradicting the assumption.
□
PROOF OF THE THEOREM. (a) Similarly as the Maximum principle above, one shows that
A is dissipative.
(b) We show that 0 ∈ρ(A). Let f ∈C( 
Ω). Denote by ˜f the extension of f to Rn
by 0 and let v = E ∗˜f , where E is the Newtonian potential. Then v ∈C(Rn) and v = f
in D(Ω)′. Let ϕ = v|∂Ω and consider the solution h of the Dirichlet problem D(ϕ). Then
u = v −h ∈D(A) and Au = f . We have shown that A is surjective. Since the solution of
D(0) is unique, the operator A is injective. Since A is closed, it follows that 0 ∈ρ(A).
(c) It follows from (a) and (b) that A is m-dissipative. In particular, λ ∈ρ(A) whenever
Reλ > 0.

W. Arendt
(d) Denote by 0 the Laplacian on C0(Rn) which generates a bounded holomorphic
semigroup by 2.4. Thus there exists M ⩾0 such that
λR(λ,0)
 ⩽M
if Reλ > 0.
We show that ∥λR(λ,A)∥⩽2M if Reλ > 0 which proves the Theorem. In fact, let
Reλ > 0, f ∈C( 
Ω), g = R(λ,A)f . Let ˜g = R(λ,∞) ˜f . Then v = g −˜g ∈C( 
Ω). More-
over, v|∂Ω = −˜g|∂Ω and λv −v = 0 in D(Ω)′. By the Maximum principle, one has
sup
x∈
Ω
v(x)
 = sup
x∈∂Ω
v(x)
 = sup
x∈∂Ω
˜g(x)

L∞(Rn) = M
|λ|∥f ∥L∞(Ω).
Consequently,
∥g∥L∞(Ω) ⩽∥v∥L∞(Ω) +

L∞(Ω)
⩽2 M
|λ|∥f ∥L∞(Ω).
□
FURTHER PROPERTIES. One has ω(T ) < ∞and T (t) is positive and compact for all
t > 0. The restriction T0 of T to C0(Ω) is a C0-semigroup.
REFERENCE. The elegant elementary argument above is due to Lumer and Paquet [LP79],
where it is given for more general elliptic operators. See also [[ABHN01], Chapter 6] for
a different presentation, and [LS99] for more general results.
2.6. The Neumann Laplacian on C( 
Ω)
Let Ω ⊂Rn be open. There is a natural realization N
Ω of the Laplacian on L2(Ω) with
Neumann boundary conditions. The operator N
Ω is self-adjoint and generates a bounded,
holomorphic, positive C0-semigroup (etN
Ω)t⩾0 on L2(Ω). We refer to Section 5.3.3 for
the precise deﬁnition.
THEOREM [FT95]. Let Ω be bounded with Lipschitz-boundary. Then C( 
Ω) is in-
variant under the semigroup (etN
Ω)t⩾0 and the restriction is a bounded holomorphic
C0-semigroup T on C( 
Ω).
The main point in the proof is to show invariance of C( 
Ω) by the semigroup or the
resolvent. Holomorphy can be shown with the help of Gaussian estimates (Section 7.4.3).
We also mention that the semigroup T induced on C( 
Ω) is compact, i.e., each T (t) is
compact for t > 0. This follows from ultracontractivity (Sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.7).

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
11
Not for each open, bounded set Ω the space C( 
Ω) is invariant: the Theorem is false on
the domain
Ω =

(x,y) ∈R2: |x| < 1,|y| < 1

\ [0,1) × {0};
see [Bie03].
The Theorem also holds for Robin boundary conditions, we refer to [War03a].
2.7. Wentzell boundary conditions
As a further example we mention a very different kind of boundary condition. Let
m ∈C[0,1] be strictly positive. Let
(Lu)(x) = m(x) · x(1 −x)u′′(x),
x ∈(0,1),
for u ∈C2(0,1). Deﬁne the operator A on C[0,1] by
D(A) =

u ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1): lim
x→0
x→1
(Lu)(x) = 0

,
Au = Lu.
Then A generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup T of angle π/2. Moreover, T is positive
and contractive.
We refer to Campiti and Metafune [CM98] for this and more general degenerate elliptic
operators with Wentzell boundary conditions.
2.8. Dynamic boundary conditions
Let Ω ⊂Rn be a bounded, open set of class C2. We will introduce a realization of the
Laplacian in C( 
Ω) with Wentzell–Robin boundary conditions. By C1
ν( 
Ω) we denote the
space of all functions f ∈C( 
Ω) for which the outer normal derivative
∂f
∂ν (z) = −lim
t↓0
f (z −t · ν(z)) −f (z)
t
exists uniformly for z ∈∂Ω; see [[DL88], Vol. 1, Sect. II.1.3b]. Let β,γ ∈C(∂Ω) and
suppose that β(z) > 0 for all z ∈∂Ω. Deﬁne the operator A on C( 
Ω) by
D(A) :=

THEOREM. The operator A generates a positive, compact and holomorphic C0-semigroup
on C( 
Ω).
Favini, Goldstein, Goldstein and Romanelli [FGGR02] were the ﬁrst to prove that A is
a generator with the help of dissipativity. An approach by form methods was then given
in [AMPR03]. Warma [War03b] proved analyticity in the case where Ω is an interval.
It was Engel [Eng04] who succeeded to prove that the semigroup is holomorphic in the
general case.
The boundary conditions incorporated into the domain of A express in fact dynamic
boundary conditions for the evolution equation. To see this, denote by T the semigroup
generated by A. Let f ∈C( 
Ω) and let u(t) = T (t)f . Then u ∈C1((0,∞),C( 
Ω)) and
˙u(t) = u(t), t > 0, on Ω. Moreover, u(t) ∈C( 
Ω) and u(t) = −β ∂u
∂ν (t) −γ u(t)
on ∂Ω. Hence,
˙u(t) = −β ∂u
∂ν (t) −γ u(t)
on ∂Ω,t > 0.
3. Asymptotics
Most important and interesting is the study of the asymptotic behavior of a semigroup T (t)
for t →∞. The philosophy is, as for other questions, that one knows better the generator
and its resolvent than the semigroup. Thus the challenge is to deduce the asymptotic behav-
ior from spectral properties of the generator. Here we will describe some principal results
with emphasis on those which can be applied to parabolic equations in Section 8. We re-
fer to [[ABHN01]] and [[Nee96]] for a systematic theory of the asymptotic behavior of
semigroups and to [[EN00]] for other kinds of examples.
3.1. Exponential stability
Let T be a C0-semigroup with generator A. By
s(A) = supReλ: λ ∈σ(A)
we denote the spectral bound of A. We say that T is exponentially stable if ω(T ) < 0; i.e.,
if there exist ε > 0, M ⩾0 such that
T (t)
 ⩽Me−εt,
t ⩾0.
It is easy to see that T is exponentially stable if and only if
lim
t→∞
T (t)
 = 0.

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
13
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. Does s(A) < 0 imply that T is exponentially stable? In gen-
eral this is not true. The realization of the Cauchy problem
 ∂u
∂t (t,s) = s ∂u
∂s (t,s),
t > 0,s > 1,
u(0,s) = u0(s),
s > 1,
in the Sobolev space W 1,2(1,∞) leads to a C0-semigroup T whose generator A has spec-
tral bound s(A) < −1
2 but T is unbounded [[ABHN01], p. 350]. An example of a hyper-
bolic equation is given by Renardy [Ren94].
However, additional hypotheses are known, which lead to a positive answer. Here we
consider three important cases corresponding to a regularity assumption, semigroups on
Hilbert space and a positivity assumption.
3.1.1. Eventually norm continuous semigroups.
A C0-semigroup T is called eventu-
ally norm-continuous if limt↓0 ∥T (t0 + t) −T (t0)∥= 0 for some t0 > 0, and T is called
norm-continuous if this holds for all t0 > 0. Of course, each holomorphic semigroup has
this property.
THEOREM. Let A be the generator of an eventually norm-continuous semigroup T .
If s(A) < 0, then T is exponentially stable.
For further extensions we refer to [[ABHN01], Chapter 5], [Bla01], [BBN01].
We mention some perturbation results: If A generates an eventually norm continu-
ous C0-semigroup T on X and B ∈L(X) is compact, then A + B also generates an
eventually norm-continuous C0-semigroup. The compactness assumption cannot be omit-
ted, in general. It can be omitted if T is norm-continuous on (0,∞). Eventually norm-
continuous semigroups appear in models for cell growth. We refer to [[Nag86], A-II.1.30
and C-IV.2.15].
3.1.2. The Gearhart–Prüss theorem.
Let H be a Hilbert space. Assume that s(A) < 0
and supReλ>0 ∥R(λ,A)∥< ∞. Then T is exponentially stable.
There are several proofs of this result which all depend on the fact that the vector-valued
Fourier transform is an isomorphism for Hilbert spaces. Prüss’ proof [Prü84] uses Fourier-
series. The above result is not true on Lp-spaces for 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, p ̸= 2; see [ArBu02],
Example 3.7.
3.1.3. Positive semigroups on Lp-spaces.
In the next result we consider a C0-semigroup
T on Lp(Ω,Σ,μ), where (Ω,Σ,μ) is a measure space and 1 ⩽p < ∞. The semigroup
is called positive if T (t)f ⩾0 for each 0 ⩽f ∈Lp(Ω,Σ,μ). Of course, here f ⩾0
means that f (x) ⩾0 μ-a.e. For positive semigroups, there is an easy criterion for negative
spectral bound: One has
s(A) < 0 if and only if A is invertible and A−1 ⩽0.

14
W. Arendt
THEOREM (Weis [Wei95]). Let A be the generator of a positive C0-semigroup T
on Lp(Ω), 1 ⩽p < ∞. If s(A) < 0, then T is exponentially stable.
For a proof and further references we refer to [[ABHN01], 5.3.6] and [[Nee96]]. A sim-
ilar result is true on C0(Ω), where Ω is a locally compact space [[ABHN01], 5.3.8], but
false on a space Lp ∩Lq [[ABHN01], 5.1.11].
3.2. Ergodic semigroups
Let T be a bounded C0-semigroup on a Banach space X. Denote by A the generator of T
and by A∗the adjoint of A. We say that T is ergodic if
Px = lim
t→∞
1
t
 t
0
T (s)x ds
exists for all x ∈X.
ERGODIC THEOREM. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) T is ergodic;
(ii) X = kerA ⊕R(A);
(iii) kerA separates kerA∗.
In that case P is the projection onto kerA along R(A).
Here we denote by R(A) = {Ax: x ∈D(A)} the range of A. One has always
kerA ∩R(A) = {0}. To say that kerA separates kerA∗means that for all x∗∈kerA∗,
x∗̸= 0, there exists x ∈kerA such that ⟨x∗,x⟩̸= 0. Note that kerA∗always separates
kerA (by the Hahn–Banach theorem). Thus on reﬂexive spaces, ergodicity is automatic.
THEOREM. Every bounded C0-semigroup on a reﬂexive space is ergodic.
It is interesting to know whether reﬂexivity is the best possible hypothesis on the Ba-
nach space in order to guarantee automatic ergodicity. And indeed it is, under some ad-
ditional hypothesis. In fact, on a general Banach space no method is known to construct
nontrivial C0-semigroups. For this reason one has to suppose some geometric property.
We will assume that X has a Schauder basis. See Section 4.5.2 for the precise deﬁni-
tion and also for a method to construct diagonal semigroups under this hypothesis. The
following theorem is a semigroup version of a result on power bounded operators by Fonf–
Lin–Wojtaszcyk [FLW01] which was recently given by Mugnolo [Mug02].
THEOREM. Let X be a Banach space with a Schauder basis. Assume that each bounded
C0-semigroup on X is ergodic. Then X is reﬂexive.
We conclude by an example. Denote by Gp the Gaussian semigroup, on Lp(Rn),
1 ⩽p ⩽∞, and by p its generator (see Section 2.4). Then G1 is not ergodic since

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
15
ker1 = 0 and ker∞= R · 1. The semigroup Gp is ergodic for 1 < p < ∞. But one
can even show that limt→∞Gp(t) = 0 strongly in Lp(Rn), 1 < p < ∞. Strong conver-
gence, and not merely convergence in mean, is the subject of the next section and the result
for the Gaussian semigroup follows from Section 3.3.2.
3.3. Convergence and asymptotically almost periodicity
In the preceding section we described when a semigroup converges in mean. Now we in-
vestigate a stronger property, namely strong convergence (see Theorem 2 of Section 3.3.2).
More generally, we consider semigroups which can be decomposed into a semigroup con-
verging strongly to zero and an almost periodic group.
Let T be a bounded C0-semigroup on X with generator A. We say that T is asymptoti-
cally almost periodic if X = X0 ⊕Xap, where
X0 :=

x ∈X: lim
t↓0 T (t)x = 0

Xap := spanx ∈X: ∃η ∈R,T (t)x = eiηtx.
Note that X0 and Xap are invariant under the semigroup. Moreover, there exists a bounded
C0-semigroup U on Xap such that T (t)|Xap = U(t), t ⩾0. Let σp(A) := {λ ∈C: ∃x ∈
D(A),x ̸= 0,Ax = λx} be the point spectrum of A. If σp(A)∩iR ⊂{0}, then Xap = kerA.
In that case T is asymptotically almost periodic if and only if Px := limt→∞T (t)x con-
verges for all x ∈X (and not just only in mean as considered in the previous section).
3.3.1. Compact resolvent.
Let A be an operator with nonempty resolvent set ρ(A).
We say that A has compact resolvent if R(λ,A) is compact for all (equivalently one)
λ ∈ρ(A). This is equivalent to saying that the injection D(A) →X is compact where
D(A) carries the graph norm. It implies that σ(A) = σp(A) is a sequence converging to ∞
(unless dimX < ∞).
THEOREM [[ABHN01], p. 361]. Let T be a bounded C0-semigroup whose generator has
compact resolvent. Then T is asymptotically almost periodic.
This result can be generalized to the case where σ(A) ∩iR is countable with more
involved proofs, though.
3.3.2. Countable spectrum.
Let T be a bounded C0-semigroup with generator A.
THEOREM 1. Assume that X is reﬂexive and σ(A) ∩iR is countable. Then T is asymptot-
ically almost periodic.
If X is not reﬂexive, one needs an ergodicity hypothesis.
THEOREM 2. Assume that
(a) σ(A) ∩iR is countable;

16
W. Arendt
(b) σp(A∗) ∩iR ⊂{0};
(c) T is ergodic.
Then Px = limt→∞T (t)x converges for all x ∈X.
REFERENCES: [[ABHN01], Chapter 5], [Vu97]. So far, there does not exist a (spectral)
characterization of strong convergence. But we refer to Chill and Tomilov [CT03,CT04]
for very interesting (not purely spectral) conditions.
3.4. Positive semigroups
The asymptotic behavior of positive semigroups is most interesting and has applications
to many areas, for example population dynamics and transport theory (see [[EN00]],
[[Mok97]], [[Nag86]]). Here we think more of applications to parabolic equations and
establish a result on convergence to a rank-1-projection which will be applied to a second-
order parabolic equation (see Section 3.5.1 and (8.5)). We also present some other results
which are obtained by putting together the results on countable spectrum of Section 3.3
and Perron–Frobenius theory for positive semigroups. Throughout this section we assume
that X is a space of the following two kinds:
(a) X = Lp(Ω), 1 ⩽p < ∞, where (Ω,Σ,μ) is a σ-ﬁnite measure space, or
(b) X = C0(K), where K is locally compact.
Here we let C0(K) := {f :K →C continuous: for each ε > 0 there exists a compact
set Kε ⊂K such that |f (x)| ⩽ε for x ∈K \ Kε}. Of course, if K is compact, then
C0(K) = C(K).
By X+ we denote the cone of all functions f in X which are positive almost everywhere
if X = Lp and everywhere if X = C0(K). Let T be a positive C0-semigroup on X; i.e.,
T satisﬁes T (t)X+ ⊂X+ for all t > 0. Denote by A the generator of T . At ﬁrst we recall
that
s(A) = ω(T )
(3.1)
and s(A) ∈σ(A) if σ(A) ̸= ∅, two important special properties of positive C0-semigroups
on X (see Section 1.3 for the deﬁnition of ω(T ), and [[ABHN01], Theorems 5.3.6
and 5.3.1] for the proofs).
THEOREM. Let T be a bounded, ergodic, eventually norm-continuous, positive C0-
semigroup on X. Then
Pf = lim
t→∞T (t)f
exists for all f ∈X.
As a consequence P is a positive projection, the projection onto kerA along R(A).
Recall that each holomorphic semigroup is eventually norm-continuous and ergodicity is
automatic if X = Lp, 1 < p < ∞.

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates

It is a remarkable result of Perron–Frobenius theory that σ(A) ∩iR ⊂{0} whenever
T is positive, bounded and eventually norm-continuous, [[Nag86], C-III.2.10, p. 202 and
A-II.1.20, p. 38]. Thus the theorem follows from Theorem 2 in Section 3.3.
3.5. Positive irreducible semigroup
We assume again that X = Lp(Ω), 1 ⩽p < ∞, or X = C0(K) as in Section 3.4. An
element f ∈Lp(Ω) is called strictly positive if f (x) > 0 a.e. An element f ∈C0(K) is
called strictly positive if f (x) > 0 for all x ∈K. Finally, a functional ϕ ∈C0(K)∗is called
strictly positive if
⟨ϕ,f ⟩> 0
for all f ∈C0(K)+ \ {0}.
Let u ∈X and ϕ ∈X∗be strictly positive such that ⟨ϕ,u⟩= 1. Then Pf = ⟨ϕ,f ⟩u deﬁnes
a projection on X. We call P a strictly positive rank-1-projection.
DEFINITION [[Nag86], p. 306]. A positive C0-semigroup is irreducible if for some
(equivalently all) λ > s(A) the function R(λ,A)f is strictly positive for all f ∈X+ \ {0}.
Irreducibility has many remarkable consequences (see [[Nag86], p. 306]). For exam-
ple, if X = C0(K), it implies that σ(A) ̸= ∅. This also remains true on X = Lp(Ω),
1 ⩽p < ∞, if in addition we assume that T (t0) is compact for some t0 > 0. However,
this case is more difﬁcult and depends on a deep result of de Pagter [[Nag86], C-III-3.7].
3.5.1. Convergence to a rank-1-projection.
In the following theorem we assume that
T (t0) is compact for some t0 > 0. This implies that T (t) is compact for all t > t0 and that
T is norm-continuous on [t0,∞). For example, if T is holomorphic and A has compact
resolvent, then T (t) is compact for all t > 0.
THEOREM. Let T be a positive, irreducible C0-semigroup on X. Assume that T (t0) is
compact for some t0 > 0. Then s(A) > −∞and there exists a strictly positive rank-1-
projection P such that
e−s(A)tT (t) −P
 ⩽Me−εt,
t ⩾0,
for some M ⩾0, ε > 0.
Thus the rescaled semigroup converges exponentially to a rank-1-projection. Such
rescaled convergence is sometimes called balanced exponential growth and plays an im-
portant role for models describing cell growth (see [Web87]). Here the theorem will be
applied to parabolic equations (see Section 8.5).
PROOF OF THEOREM. Since σ(A) ̸= ∅we can assume that s(A) > −∞. Since T (t0) is
compact, T is quasicompact [[Nag86], B-IV.2.8, p. 214]. Now the result follows from
[[Nag86], C-IV.2.1, p. 343, and C-III.3.5(d), p. 310].

3.5.2. Convergence to a periodic group.
The following result is a combination of Perron–
Frobenius theory for positive semigroups and the results on countable spectrum of Sec-
tion 3.3. Let T be a bounded C0-semigroup with generator A. Assume that A has compact
resolvent. Then we know from Section 3.3 that X = X0 ⊕Xap, where X0 and Xap are
invariant under T . Moreover, there exists a C0-group U on Xap such that U(t) = T (t)|Xap
for t ⩾0.
THEOREM. In addition to the assumptions made above, if T is positive and irreducible,
then U is periodic.
PROOF. If s(A) < 0, then Xap = {0}. If σ(A) ∩iR = {0}, then Xap = kerA; i.e., U(t) ≡I.
If σ(A) ∩iR ̸= {0}, it follows from [[Nag86], C-III.3.8, p. 313] that σ(A) ∩iR = i 2π
τ Z for
some τ > 0. It follows from the deﬁnition of Xap that T (t + τ)x = T (t)x, t ⩾0, for all
x ∈Xap.

4. Functional calculus
In this section we consider sectorial operators. These are unbounded operators whose spec-
tra lie in a sector. Generators of bounded C0-semigroups are of this type. If A is such an
operator, we will deﬁne closed operators f (A) for a large class of holomorphic functions
deﬁned on a sector. Of particular importance are fractional powers Aα. We will introduce
the class BIP which is important to establish theorems of maximal regularity but also for
results on interpolation. Throughout this chapter X is a complex Banach space.
4.1. Sectorial operators
Given an angle 0 < ϕ < π, we consider the open sector
Σϕ :=

reiα: r > 0,|α| < ϕ

.
Let X be a Banach space. An operator A is called ϕ-sectorial if
σ(A) ⊂Σϕ
(4.1)
and
sup
λ∈C\Σϕ
λR(λ,A)
 < ∞.
(4.2)
An operator A on X is called sectorial if there exists 0 < ϕ < π such that A is
ϕ-sectorial. In that case we deﬁne the sectoriality angle ϕsec(A) of A by
ϕsec(A) := inf

ϕ ∈(0,π): (4.1) and (4.2) are valid

.
(4.3)
Note that ϕsec(A) ∈[0,π).

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
19
4.1.1. Simple criterion.
If (−∞,0) ⊂ρ(A) and
λR(λ,A)
 ⩽c for all λ < 0 and some c ⩾0,then A is sectorial.
This follows from the power series expansion of the resolvent.
4.1.2. Bounded holomorphic semigroups.
An operator A is sectorial with ϕsec(A) < π
2
if and only if −A generates a bounded holomorphic semigroup T . It is a C0-semigroup if
and only if D(A) is dense. This is automatically the case if X is reﬂexive.
4.1.3. Bounded semigroups.
If −A generates a bounded C0-semigroup, then A is secto-
rial and ϕsec(A) ⩽π
2 .
4.1.4. Injective operators.
Let A be a sectorial operator with range R(A) := {Ax: x ∈
D(A)}. If A is injective, then A−1 with domain D(A−1) = R(A) is sectorial and
ϕsec(A−1) = ϕsec(A).
4.1.5. Reﬂexive spaces.
If A is an injective sectorial operator on a reﬂexive space, then
D(A) ∩R(A) is dense.
4.1.6. Warning.
The notion of sectorial operators is not universal in the literature. In par-
ticular, it does not coincide with Kato’s deﬁnition in [[Kat66]]. In [PS90], [DHP01]
and [[Prü93]] the additional assumption that A is injective, densely deﬁned with dense
image is incorporated into the deﬁnition of sectorial. This implies in particular that
D(A) ∩R(A) is dense.
4.2. The sum of commuting operators
Many interesting problems can be formulated in the following form. Let A and B be oper-
ators on a Banach space: Under which conditions is the problem
Ax + Bx = y
(P )
well posed? This means that for all y ∈X there exists a unique x ∈D(A) ∩D(B) solv-
ing (P). In this section we will establish a spectral theoretical approach which leads to a
“weak solution”. We deﬁne the operator A+B on the domain D(A+B) := D(A)∩D(B)
by (A + B)x = Ax + Bx.
Assume that ρ(A) ∩ρ(B) ̸= ∅. We say that A and B commute if R(λ,A)R(λ,B) =
R(λ,B)R(λ,A) for all (equivalently one) λ ∈ρ(A) ∩ρ(B). This is equivalent to saying
that for some (equivalently all) λ ∈ρ(A) one has R(λ,A)D(B) ⊂D(B) and BR(λ,A)x =
R(λ,A)Bx for all x ∈D(B). For example, if A and B generate C0-semigroups S and T ,
then A and B commute if and only if S(t)T (t) = T (t)S(t) for all t ⩾0. In that case
U(t) = T (t)S(t) is a C0-semigroup, the operator A + B is closable and A + B is the
generator of U.

20
W. Arendt
THEOREM. Let A, B be two commuting sectorial operators such that
ϕsec(A) + ϕsec(B) < π.
Then A + B has a unique extension (A + B)∼such that (ω,∞) ⊂ρ((A + B)∼) for some
ω ∈R and such that (A + B)∼commutes with A. Moreover,
σ

(A + B)∼	
⊂σ(A) + σ(B).
(4.4)
If D(A) is dense in X, then A + B is closable and (A + B)∼is the closure of A + B.
Note that by (4.4), (A + B)∼is invertible if 0 ∈ρ(A) or 0 ∈ρ(B). This result is due to
Da Prato and Grisvard [DPG75], Théorème 3.7, under the assumption that D(A) is dense.
The spectral inclusion (4.2.1) was proved in [[Prü93], Theorem 8.5] and in [ARS94], where
also nondensely deﬁned operators are considered.
If A or B is invertible, then by the Theorem, for each y ∈X, there exists a unique
x ∈D((A + B)∼) such that
(A + B)∼x = y.
One aim of the functional calculus to be developed here is to establish conditions un-
der which x ∈D(A) ∩D(B), which is expressed by saying that the solution has maxi-
mal regularity.
4.3. The elementary functional calculus
Let A be a sectorial operator and let ϕsec(A) < ϕ < π.
4.3.1. Invertible operators.
By H ∞
1 (Σϕ) we denote the space of all bounded holomor-
phic functions f :Σϕ →C such that
f (z)
 ⩽c|z|−γ ,
|z| ⩾1,
(4.5)
where c ⩾0,γ > 0 depend on f . Then H ∞
1 (Σϕ) is an algebra for pointwise operations.
Let ϕsec(A) < ϕ1 < ϕ. Consider the path
Γ (r) =
−re−iϕ1
if r < 0,
reiϕ1
if r ⩾0.
For f ∈H ∞
1 (Σϕ) we deﬁne f (A) ∈L(X) by
f (A) =
1
2πi

Γ
f (λ)R(λ,A)dλ.
(4.6)

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
21
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of ϕ1. The mapping f →f (A) is an algebra
homomorphism from H ∞
1 (Σϕ) into L(X) such that
fλ(A) = R(λ,A)
for λ ∈C \ Σϕ,
where fλ(z) =
1
λ−z. Now let x ∈D(A). Then
f (A)x = (I + A)g(A)x,
(4.7)
where g(λ) = f (λ)
1+λ . This follows from Cauchy’s theorem since R(λ,A)−
1
1+λR(λ,A)(I +
A) =
1
1+λI. For f ∈H ∞(Σϕ) we deﬁne f (A) by
f (A) = (I + A)g(A)
(4.8)
with g(λ) = f (λ)
1+λ . Since g ∈H ∞
1 (Σϕ), one has g(A) ∈L(X) and so f (A) is a closed
operator with domain
Df (A)	 := x ∈X: g(A)x ∈D(A).
This deﬁnition is consistent with (4.6) if f ∈H ∞
1 (Σϕ). Next we relax the hypothesis of
invertibility.
4.3.2. Injective operators.
Let A be a sectorial operator and ϕ > ϕsec(A). Denote
by H ∞
0 (Σϕ) the algebra of all bounded holomorphic functions f :Σϕ →C satisfying
an estimate
f (z)
 ⩽c|z|−γ ,
|z| > 1,
f (z)
 ⩽c|z|γ,
|z| ⩽1,
where c ⩾0 and γ > 0 depend on f . For f ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ) we deﬁne f (A) ∈L(X) by (4.6).
Now assume that A is injective. The operator B = A(I + A)−2 is bounded and injec-
tive with range D(A) ∩R(A). Hence, A + 2I + A−1 = B−1 with domain D(A) ∩R(A)
is a closed, injective operator. Now let f ∈H ∞(Σϕ). Let g(λ) =
λ
(1+λ)2f (λ). Then
g ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ). Hence, g(A) ∈L(X). We deﬁne f (A) by
f (A) =

A + 2I + A−1	
g(A)
= (I + A)2A−1g(A).
(4.9)
Then f (A) is a closed operator. A similar argument as in Section 4.3.1 shows that this
new deﬁnition is consistent with the previous one (4.6) if f ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ). Moreover, if A is
invertible, then the deﬁnition is consistent with Section 4.3.1.
In this way we deﬁned a closed operator f (A) for each f ∈H ∞(Σϕ). We may extend
the deﬁnition to an even larger class of holomorphic functions. Let Ψ (λ) =
λ
(1+λ)2 and let

22
W. Arendt
L(A) = (I + A)2A−1. Denote by B(Σϕ) the space of all holomorphic functions f on Σϕ
such that Ψ nf ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ) for some n ∈N. Then we deﬁne the closed operator f (A) by
f (A) = L(A)n
Ψ nf
	
(A).
(4.10)
This deﬁnition is consistent with the previous ones.
We call the functional calculus deﬁned in Sections 4.3.1 or 4.3.2 the elementary func-
tional calculus. The following properties justify this name.
4.3.3. Properties of the functional calculus.
Let A be an injective sectorial operator.
For λ ∈C \ Σϕsec(A) one has
R(λ,A) = fλ(A),
where fλ(z) =
1
z−λ. The set H(A) := {f ∈B(Σϕ): f (A) ∈L(X)} is a subalgebra
of B(Σϕ) and
f →f (A)
is an algebra homomorphism [McI86,LeM98b].
4.3.4. Strip-type operators.
Instead of sectors we consider here a horizontal strip
Stω :=

z ∈C: |Imz| < ω

where ω > 0. We say that an operator B on X is of strip type, if there exists a strip Stω
such that
(a) σ(B) ⊂Stω and
(b) sup|Imλ|⩾ω ∥R(λ,B)∥< ∞.
We denote by
ωst(B) = inf

ω > 0: (a) and (b) hold

the strip-type of B. Two kinds of examples are important: the case where iB generates
a C0-group and B = logA to which the two following subsections are devoted.
4.3.5. Groups.
Let B be an operator such that iB generates a C0-group U. Denote by
ωU := inf

ω ∈R: ∃M ⩾0 such that
U(t)
 ⩽Meω|t| for all t ∈R

the group type of U. Since the resolvent of ±iB is the Laplace transform of the semigroup
(U(±t))t⩾0, it follows that B is a strip type operator and
ωst(B) ⩽ωU.
(4.11)

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
23
In general, it may happen that
ωst(B) < ωU
(see [Wol81]). But on Hilbert space, strip type and group type coincide by the Gearhart–
Prüss theorem; i.e.,
ωst(B) = ωU
(4.12)
whenever iB generates a C0-group U on a Hilbert space. Next we give another important
example of a strip-type operator.
4.3.6. The logarithm.
Let A be an injective sectorial operator. Let ϕ > ϕsec(A). Let
g(λ) =
λ
(1+λ)2 logλ. Then g ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ). We deﬁne
logA = (I + A)2A−1g(A).
Thus logA is a closed operator by the same argument as in Section 4.3.2. We note some of
the properties of the logarithm. Recall that A−1 is sectorial. One has
logA−1 = −logA.
(4.13)
THEOREM (Haase [Haa03a], Nollau [Nol69]). Let A be a sectorial operator. Then logA is
a strip-type operator and
ωst(logA) = ϕsec(A).
Now it may happen that ilogA generates a C0-group. Then this group is given by the
imaginary powers of A, which we consider in Section 4.4.
Further references: [Oka99,Oka00a,Oka00b].
4.4. Fractional powers and BIP
In the section we introduce fractional powers Aα of a sectorial operator A. We ﬁrst consider
the case where A is invertible which is simpler to present.
4.4.1. Fractional powers of invertible operators.
Let A be an invertible sectorial opera-
tor. Let α ∈C such that Reα > 0. Then the function fα(z) = z−α is in H ∞
1 (Σϕ) for all
0 < ϕ < π. Thus we may deﬁne
A−α = fα(A) ∈L(X),
Reα > 0,
(4.14)
by (4.6). It follows that
A−αA−β = A−(α+β),
Reα,Reβ > 0.
(4.15)

24
W. Arendt
In fact, (A−α)Reα>0 is a bounded holomorphic semigroup. Its generator is −logA (which
was deﬁned in Section 4.3.6). The operator A is densely deﬁned if and only if logA is so
(i.e., if and only if (A−α)Reα>0 is a C0-semigroup).
A particular case of Section 4.4.1 occurs when −A generates an exponentially stable
C0-semigroup T (i.e., ∥T (t)∥⩽Me−εt for all t ⩾0 and some M ⩾0, ε > 0). Then A is
invertible and A−α can be expressed in terms of the semigroup instead of the resolvent as
above, namely,
A−α =
1
Γ (α)
 ∞
0
tα−1T (t)dt
(4.16)
for Reα > 0.
Next we consider a more general class of sectorial operators.
4.4.2. Fractional powers of injective sectorial operators.
Let A be an injective sectorial
operator and let π > ϕ > ϕsec(A). Let α ∈C, fα(z) = zα, z ∈Σϕ. Then fα ∈B(Σϕ). Thus
Aα = fα(A),
α ∈C,
is deﬁned according to Section 4.3.2. It is a closed injective operator and the following
properties are valid:
A−α =

Aα	−1 =

Aα	−1,
α ∈C;
(4.17)
AαAβ ⊂Aα+β,
α,β ∈C;
(4.18)
AαAβ = Aα+β,
Reα,Re β > 0.
(4.19)
If Reα > 0, then
D

(A + ω)α	
= D

Aα	
for all ω ⩾0.
(4.20)
Moreover, for 0 < α <
π
ϕsec(A), the operator Aα is sectorial and
ϕsec

Aα	
= αϕsec(A)
and
log

Aα	
= α logA;
(4.21)
moreover,

Aα	β = Aαβ,
Reβ > 0.
(4.22)
Formula (4.21) is interesting: it shows in particular that −Aα generates a bounded holo-
morphic semigroup if 0 < α is small enough.
There is an enormous amount of literature on fractional powers and we refer in particular
to the recent monograph [[MS01]].
Next we consider imaginary powers Ais of an injective sectorial operator. They play an
important role for regularity theory and also for interpolation theory.

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
25
4.4.3. Characterization of BIP.
Let A be a sectorial injective operator on X. Then by
Section 4.4.2 we can deﬁne the closed operators Ais, s ∈R, and also the closed operator
logA (by Section 4.3.6).
THEOREM. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) D(A) ∩R(A) is dense and Ais ∈L(X) for all s ∈R.
(ii) The operator ilogA generates a C0-group U.
In that case U(s) = Ais, s ∈R.
DEFINITION. We say that A has bounded imaginary powers and write A ∈BIP, if A is
injective, sectorial and if the two equivalent conditions of Theorem are satisﬁed.
Note that this includes the hypothesis that D(A) ∩R(A) be dense in X. Recall however,
that D(A)∩R(A) is automatically dense in X if X is reﬂexive and A is a sectorial, injective
operator. It is obvious that
A ∈BIP
if and only if
A−1 ∈BIP,
(4.23)
References: [Haa03a], [[Prü93]].
4.4.4. BIP for invertible operators.
Property BIP can be formulated in a different way if
the operator is invertible. Let A be sectorial of dense domain. Assume that 0 ∈ρ(A). Then,
for Reα > 0, the operator A−α ∈L(X) was deﬁned in Section 4.4.1, and we had seen that
(A−α)Reα>0 is a holomorphic C0-semigroup which is bounded on Σϕ for each 0 < ϕ < π
2 .
The generator of this semigroup is −logA. Now it follows from Section 2.3 that A ∈BIP
if and only if the holomorphic C0-semigroup (A−α)Reα>0 has a trace. We formulate this
as a theorem.
THEOREM. Let A be a sectorial densely deﬁned operator with 0 ∈ρ(A). The following
assertion are equivalent:
(i) A ∈BIP;
(ii) there exists c > 0 such that ∥A−α∥⩽c whenever Reα > 0, |α| ⩽1.
4.4.5. The BIP-type.
Let A ∈BIP. Then we denote by
ϕbip(A) = infω ∈R: ∃M ⩾0 such that
Ais ⩽Meω|s| for all s ∈R
the group-type of the C0-group (Ais)s∈R. We call ϕbip(A) the BIP-type of A. One al-
ways has
ϕsec(A) ⩽ϕbip(A).
(4.24)
Recall from (4.10) that ϕsec(A) = ωst(logA). If X is a Hilbert space, then ωst(logA) =
ϕbip(A) (by (4.12)). Thus we obtain
ϕbip(A) = ϕsec(A)
on Hilbert space.
(4.25)

26
W. Arendt
This is McIntosh’s result with a new proof due to Haase. The identity (4.25) is no longer
true on Banach spaces. Recently, an example is given by Haase [Haa03a,Haa03b] where
ϕsec(A) < π < ϕbip(A)
on a UMD-space X.
(4.26)
In fact, X = Lp(R,ω1 dx) ∩Lq(R,ω2 dx) for 1 < p < 2 < q < ∞and ω1,ω2 strictly
positive measurable functions. Another example of different sectorial and BIP-angle is
given independently by Kalton [Kal03], where the operator has a bounded H ∞-calculus,
in addition.
4.4.6. An inverse theorem for BIP operators.
If A ∈BIP, then (Ais)s∈R is a C0-group.
Which groups occur in this manner? There is a very satisfying answer if the underlying
Banach space has some geometric properties. We refer to Section 6.1.3 for the deﬁnition
of UMD-spaces. Here we just recall that each space Lp,1 < p < ∞, is a UMD-space. Let
(U(s))s∈R be a C0-group with generator iB. Then B is a strip-type operator. Recall the
deﬁnition of ωst(B) from Section 4.3.4.
THEOREM (Monniaux). Let iB be the generator of a C0-group U on a UMD-space X.
Assume that
ωst(B) < π.
Then there exists a unique sectorial operator A such that Ais = U(s) for all s ∈R.
We call A the analytic generator of U.
This theorem is due to Monniaux [Mon99] for the case where ωU < π (the group-
type of U). It was Haase [Haa03b] who observed that the weaker assumption ωst(B) < π
sufﬁces. Of course, in the situation of the theorem one has B = logA. One may ask more
generally which strip type operators B are of the form logA for some sectorial operator A.
This seems to be unknown. It is known though, that the hypothesis on the Banach space
cannot be omitted in the above theorem (see [Mon99] for an example). More precisely,
on each Banach space X, to each C0-group U one can associate the analytic generator A.
If A is sectorial, then Ais = U(s), s ∈R. But if the space X is not a UMD-space, then it may
happen that ρ(A) = ∅. In particular, A is not sectorial. The notion of analytic generators
is due to Cioranescu and Zsidó [CZ76] before the notion and properties of UMD-spaces
were known. Their aim was to treat Tomita–Takesaki theory for von Neumann algebras.
4.4.7. Bounded analytic generators.
We now describe when the C0-group (Ais)s∈R is
the boundary group of a holomorphic semigroup (see Section 2.3 for this notion).
PROPOSITION [Mon99]. Let U be a C0-group of type < π on a UMD-space X. The fol-
lowing assertions are equivalent:
(i) The analytic generator A of U is bounded;
(ii) there exists a holomorphic C0-semigroup (T (z))Rez>0 such that U(t)x =
limr↓0 T (it + r)x for all x ∈X.
In that case one has A = T (1).

4.4.8. The Dore–Venni theorem.
Next we establish the famous Dore–Venni theo-
rem [DoVe87] on maximal regularity. It gives an answer to the question of closedness
of A + B which arose in Section 4.2. We refer to Section 6.1.3 for the deﬁnition and
properties of UMD-spaces.
The following version of the Dore–Venni theorem is due to Prüss and Sohr [PS90].
THEOREM. Let X be a UMD-space. Let A,B ∈BIP such that ϕbip(A) + ϕbip(B) < π.
Assume that A and B commute. Then A + B is closed. Moreover, A + B ∈BIP and
ϕbip(A + B) ⩽maxϕbip(A),ϕbip(B).
If one of the operators is invertible, it is possible to deduce this result from Monniaux’
inverse theorem (Section 4.4.6). We sketch the proof.
PROOF [MON99]. Assume that 0 ∈ρ(B). Then by Section 4.4.7 the group (B−is)s∈R is
the boundary of a holomorphic C0-semigroup T and B−1 = T (1). Let W(t) = AitB−it. By
Monniaux’ inverse theorem there exists a sectorial operator C such that Cit = AitB−it. It is
not difﬁcult to show that C = AB−1 with domain D(C) = {x ∈X: B−1x ∈D(A)}. In par-
ticular, (AB−1 + I) is invertible. Let y ∈X. We have to ﬁnd x ∈D(A) + D(B) such that
Ax + Bx = y; i.e., (AB−1 + I)Bx = y. Thus x = B−1(AB−1 + I)−1y is a solution.

4.4.9. A noncommutative Dore–Venni theorem.
The assumption that A and B commute
can be relaxed by imposing a growth condition on the commutator of the resolvent.
THEOREM (Monniaux and Prüss [MP97]). Assume that X is a UMD-space. Let
A, B ∈BIP with ϕbip(A) + ϕbip(B) < π. Assume that 0 ∈ρ(A). Let ψA > ϕbip(A),
ψB > ϕbip(B) be angles such that ψA + ψB < π. Assume that there exist constants
0 ⩽α < β < 1 and c ⩾0 such that

(1 + |λ|1−α)|μ|1+β
for all λ ∈Σπ−ψA and all μ ∈Σπ−ψB . Then there exists ω ∈R such that A + B + ω is
closed and sectorial.
This result can be applied to Volterra equations [MP97], to nonautonomous evolu-
tion equations [HM00a,HM00b] and also to prove maximal regularity of the Ornstein–
Uhlenbeck operator [MPRS00].

PROPOSITION ([[Tri95], p. 103], [Yag84], [[MS01], Theorem 11.6.1]). Let A ∈BIP. Then
the complex interpolation space [X,D(A)]α is isomorphic to D(Aα) for 0 < α < 1.
Now assume in addition that A is invertible. Then Dore [Dor99a] (see also [Dor99b]
for the noninvertible case) showed that the part of A in the real interpolation space
(X,D(A))α,p has a bounded H ∞-calculus whenever 0 < α < 1, 1 < p < ∞. (See Sec-
tion 4.5 for the deﬁnition of H ∞-calculus.) If X is a Hilbert space, then (X,D(A))α,2 =
[X,D(A)]α. Thus, if X is a Hilbert space, the part of A in [X,D(A)]α has a bounded
H ∞-calculus. Observe that the part of A in D(Aα) is similar to A. Thus, if D(Aα) =
[X,D(A)]α, then A has a bounded H ∞-calculus.
We have proved the converse of the above proposition and may formulate the following
characterization on Hilbert spaces.
THEOREM. Let A be a sectorial, invertible operator on a Hilbert space and let 0 < α < 1.
The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) A ∈BIP;
(ii) D(Aα) = [X,D(A)]α;
(iii) the H ∞-calculus is bounded.
For further results on Hilbert spaces we refer to Section 5 and to the paper by Auscher,
McIntosh and Nahmrod [AMN97].
This interesting relation between BIP and interpolation spaces seemed to be the mo-
tivation of much research on operators with bounded imaginary powers in the seventies
(see, e.g., Seeley’s paper [See67]). Long time after this, the Dore–Venni theorem lead to a
different direction, namely regularity theory.
4.5. Bounded H ∞-calculus for sectorial operators
Let A be an injective sectorial operator on a Banach space X and let π ⩾ϕ > ϕsec(A).
Then for f ∈H ∞(Σϕ) the closed operator f (A) was deﬁned in Section 4.3.
DEFINITION. We say that A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus if
f (A) ∈L(X)
for all f ∈H ∞(Σϕ).
(4.27)
In that case, the mapping
f →f (A)
is a continuous algebra homomorphism from H ∞(Σϕ) into L(X).
We note the following: Let ϕsec(A) < ϕ1 < ϕ2 ⩽π. If A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ1)-cal-
culus then also the H ∞(Σϕ2)-calculus is bounded. Thus, the weakest property in this con-
text is to have a bounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus for the cut plane Σπ = C \ {x ∈R: x < 0}.

DEFINITION. We write A ∈H ∞to say that A is injective, sectorial and has a bounded
H ∞(Σπ)-calculus. We let
ϕH ∞(A) := infσ ∈ϕsec(A),π: A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus.
4.5.1. Characterization via H ∞
0 .
Let A be an injective sectorial operator with dense do-
main and dense range, and let ϕ > ϕsec(A). Then A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus if
and only if there exists c > 0 such that
f (A)
L(X) ⩽c∥f ∥H ∞(Σϕ)
(4.28)
for all f ∈H ∞
0 (Σϕ). Note that H ∞
0 (Σϕ) is not norm-dense in H ∞(Σϕ). Still, there is
a canonical way to extend the calculus.
4.5.2. Unbounded H ∞-calculus.
It is not an easy matter to decide whether a given oper-
ator has a bounded H ∞-calculus. Later we will give several criteria and examples. Here we
show a way to construct counterexamples. Let X be a Banach space. A sequence (en)n∈N is
called a Schauder basis of X if, for each x ∈X, there exists a unique sequence (xn)n∈N ⊂C
such that
∞

n=1
xnen = x.
(4.29)
The Schauder basis is called unconditional if for each x = ∞
n=1 xnen ∈X the sequence
∞
n=1 cnxnen converges in X for each c = (cn)n∈N ∈ℓ∞. Otherwise we call (en)n∈N a con-
ditional Schauder basis. If X has an unconditional Schauder basis it also has a conditional
Schauder basis [[Sin70], Chapter II, Theorem. 23.2]. In particular, each separable Hilbert
space has a conditional Schauder basis. Thus the following example is in particular valid
in a separable Hilbert space.
EXAMPLE (Unbounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus). Let X be a Banach space with a conditional
Schauder basis (en)n∈N. Deﬁne the operator A on X by
Ax =
∞

n=1
2nxnen
(4.30)
with domain the set of all x = ∞
n=1 xnen ∈X such that (4.30) converges. Then A is
sectorial with ϕsec(A) = 0. However, A does not have a bounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus.
For the proof it is helpful to consider more general diagonal operators. Denote by BV
the space of all scalar sequences α = (αn)n∈N such that
∥α∥BV = |α1| +
∞

n=1
|αn+1 −αn| < ∞.

30
W. Arendt
Then BV is a Banach space (isomorphic to ℓ1). If ∞
n=1 yn converges in X, then
∞
n=1 αnyn converges for each α ∈BV . This follows from Abel’s partial summation rule

n=2
sn(αn−1 −αn) + sm+1αm −s1α1,
where s1 = 0, sn = n−1
k=1 yk for n ⩾2. Thus, if α ∈BV , then
Dαx =


n=1
αnxnen
(4.31)
for x = ∞
n=1 xnen deﬁnes an operator Dα ∈L(X). Moreover,
∥Dα∥⩽c∥α∥BV ,
α ∈BV,
(4.32)
by the closed graph theorem (or a direct estimate). Next we consider unbounded diagonal
operators. Let (αn)n∈N ⊂C. Then
Dαx =
∞

n=1
αnxnen
(4.33)
with D(Dα) := {x = ∞
n=1 xnen: (4.33) converges} deﬁnes a closed operator on X. This
is obvious since the coordinate functionals

are continuous.
PROPOSITION. Let 0 < α1 < αn < αn+1 such that limn→∞αn = ∞. Then Dα is a sector-
ial operator of type ϕsec(Dα) = 0. Moreover, 0 ∈ρ(Dα) and Dα has compact resolvent.
PROOF. Let 0 < ϕ < π. Let π ⩾|θ| > ϕ, λ = reiθ, r > 0. Consider the sequence
βn =

where cϕ does not depend on θ or r. Thus ∥Dβ∥⩽c

(λ −Dα)−1. This shows that Dα is sectorial of type 0. We omit the proof of compact-
ness of Dβ (see [LeM00]).
□
Now let A be the operator of the example; i.e., A = Dα with αn = 2n. In order to
show that A has no bounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus we use the following (see [[Gar81], The-
orem 1.1. on pp. 287 and 284 ff ]).
INTERPOLATION LEMMA. Let b = (bn)n∈Z ∈ℓ∞(Z). Then there exists f ∈H ∞(Σπ)
such that
f 2n	 = bn
for all n ∈Z.
Let f ∈H ∞(Σπ). It is easy to see from the deﬁnition that en ∈D(f (A)) and
f (A)en = f 2n	en.
Now assume that f (A) ∈L(X). Then it follows that

xnen

converges for all x ∈X. Thus, by the Interpolation Lemma, ∞
n=1 bnxnen converges for
all b ∈ℓ∞and all x ∈X. This contradicts the fact that the basis is conditional.
A ﬁrst example of this kind had been given by Baillon and Clément [BC91]. Further
developments are contained in [Ven93], [LeM00] and [Lan98].
4.5.3. BIP versus bounded H ∞-calculus.
It is clear from the deﬁnition that A ∈H ∞
implies A ∈BIP whenever A is a sectorial, injective operator. It is remarkable that in
that case
ϕbip(A) = ϕH ∞(A)
(4.34)
(see [CDMY96]). Conversely, if X is a Hilbert space, then BIP implies boundedness of the
H ∞-calculus by Section 4.4.10. This is not true on Lp-spaces for p ̸= 2 as the following
example shows.
EXAMPLE [Lan98]. Let 1 < p < ∞, p ̸= 2. There exists a sectorial injective opera-
tor A ∈BIP on Lp which does not have a bounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus. We consider
the space Lp
2π of all scalar-valued 2π-periodic measurable functions on R such that

32
W. Arendt
∥f ∥p :=
1
2π (
 2π
0
|f (t)|p dt)1/p < ∞. By en we denote the nth trigonometric polynomial
en(t) = eint, n ∈Z. For f ∈Lp
2π, we denote by
ˆf (n) := 1
2π
 2π
0
f (t)eint dt
the nth Fourier coefﬁcient. Then {en: n ∈Z} is a Schauder basis of Lp
2π; i.e.,
f = lim
n→∞
m

n=−m
ˆf (n)en =:
+∞

n=−∞
ˆf (n)en
for all f ∈Lp. Moreover, the Riesz-projection
R :f →
∞

n=0
ˆf (n)en
is bounded on Lp
2π. Consider the operator A on Lp
2π given by
Af =
+∞

n=−∞
2n ˆf (n)en
(4.35)
with domain D(A) = {f ∈Lp
2π: (4.35) converges}. Since the Riesz-projection is bounded
we can write A as the direct sum of A1 ⊕A2, where
A1f =
∞

n=0
2n ˆf (n)en,
A2f =
∞

n=1
2−n ˆf (−n)e−n
with appropriate domains. The ﬁrst is injective and sectorial by Section 4.5.2 the sec-
ond is the inverse of an operator of the Proposition in Section 4.5.2. Thus A is sec-
torial and injective. By the same argument as in Section 4.5.2 one sees that A has no
bounded H ∞(Σπ)-calculus if p ̸= 2. Now for a ∈R consider the shift operator La
given by (Lau)(t) = u(t + a) for u ∈Lp
2π. Then La ∈L(Lp
2π) and ∥La∥= 1. Moreover,
(Lau)∧(n) = eina ˆu(n). Let a = s log2. Then it follows that
Ais = La.
Thus A ∈BIP and ∥Ais∥L(Lp
2π) = 1, 1 < p < ∞.

4.6. Perturbation
Let A be a sectorial operator on a Banach space X. We consider perturbations A+B where
B :D(A) →X is linear. We say that B is A-bounded if B is continuous with respect to the
graph norm on D(A); i.e., if there exist constants a ⩾0, b ⩾0 such that
∥Bx∥⩽a∥Ax∥+ b∥x∥,
x ∈D(A).
(4.36)
The inﬁmum over all a > 0 such that there exists b > 0 such that (4.36) holds is called
the A-bound of B. A small perturbation of A is a linear mapping B :D(A) →X with
A-bound 0. This is equivalent to limλ→∞∥BR(λ,A)∥= 0 as is easy to see. Here we
consider the following two stronger conditions.
BR(λ,A)
 ⩽c
λβ ,
λ ⩾1;
(4.37)
R(λ,A)Bx
 ⩽c
λβ ∥x∥,
λ ⩾1,x ∈D(A).
(4.38)
THEOREM. Assume that B :D(A) →X is linear such that (4.37) or (4.38) is satisﬁed
for some β > 0, c ⩾0. Assume that A and A + B are invertible and sectorial. Then the
following holds:
(a) A ∈H ∞⇒A + B ∈H ∞;
(b) A ∈BIP ⇒A + B ∈BIP.
We refer to [AHS94] or [ABH01] for the proof. Given a sectorial operator A there exists
a constant εA > 0 such that A + B + ω is sectorial for some ω ∈R whenever B has an
A-bound smaller than εA. However, the properties H ∞and BIP are not preserved.
COUNTEREXAMPLE [MY90]. There exists an invertible operator A ∈H ∞on a Hilbert
space X such that, for each ε > 0, there exists an operator Bε :D(A) →X with A-bound
less than ε > 0 such that A + Bε + ω /∈BIP for any ω ∈R.
In view of the counterexample one would not expect that the properties H ∞or BIP are
preserved under small perturbations. This seems to be unknown, though.
4.7. Groups and positive contraction semigroups
In this section we give two classes of examples of operators with bounded H ∞-calculus.
4.7.1. Groups.
Generators of bounded C0-groups and their squares yield an interesting
class of examples.
THEOREM [HP98]. Let B be the generator of a bounded C0-group on a UMD-space X.
Then

34
W. Arendt
(a) B has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for each ϕ > π/2;
(b) −B2 has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for each ϕ > 0.
We give an example.
4.7.2. The abstract Laplace operator.
Let Uj,j = 1,...,n, be n commuting C0-groups
on a UMD-space X with generators Bj,j = 1,...,n. By Section 4.7.1 the operators −B2
j
have an H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for all ϕ > 0,j = 1,...,n. It follows from the Dore–Venni
theorem (Section 4.4.8) that the operator A := B2
1 + ··· + B2
n is closed with domain
D(A) =
n

j=1
D

B2
j
	
.
Moreover, −A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for all ϕ > 0. We may consider A as
an abstract Laplace operator. Indeed, a concrete example is given by (Uj(t)f )(x) =
f (x + tej) on Lp(Rn), 1 < p < ∞, where ej denotes the jth unit vector in Rn. Thus
Af = f with D(A) = W 2,p(Rn). For a more general noncommutative setting on Lie
groups see ter Elst and Robinson [tER96a].
4.7.3. Positive contraction semigroups on Lp.
Next we consider positive semigroups.
The following result is due to Duong [Duo89] after a more special result was proved by
Cowling [Cow83]. Vector-valued versions are given in [HP98].
THEOREM. Let −A be the generator of a positive, contractive C0-semigroup on Lp(Ω),
1 <p <∞, where (Ω,Σ,μ) is a measure space. Then A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus
for each ϕ > π/2.
This result can be extended to semigroups on Lp which are dominated by a positive
contraction semigroup. The proof can be reduced to the group case (Section 4.7.1) by an
interesting dilation theorem due to Fendler extending the Akcoglu dilation theorem for
single operators to semigroups. We give more details.
4.7.4. r-contractive semigroups on Lp.
Let S be an operator on Lp(Ω), 1 ⩽p ⩽∞.
We say that S is regular, if S is a linear combination of positive operators; or equivalently,
if S is dominated by a positive operator T on Lp(Ω), i.e.,
|Sf | ⩽T |f |,
f ∈Lp(Ω),
where |f |(x) = |f (x)|, x ∈Ω. In that case there exists a smallest positive operator |S|
which dominates S. We call ∥S∥r := ∥|S|∥the r-norm of S. If p = 1 or ∞, then every
bounded operator S on Lp(Ω) is regular and ∥S∥= ∥S∥r, but if 1 < p < ∞this is false
(if Lp(Ω) has inﬁnite dimension). We refer to [[Sch74], Chapter IV].
THEOREM. Let 1 < p < ∞. Let T be a C0-semigroup on Lp(Ω) such that ∥T (t)∥r ⩽1
for all t ⩾0. Denote by −A the generator of T . Then A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus
for each ϕ > π/2.

PROOF [LeM98b]. By Fendler’s dilation theorem [Fen97] there exist a space Lp( 
Ω), con-
tractions j :Lp(Ω) →Lp( 
Ω), P :Lp( 
Ω) →Lp(Ω) and a contraction C0-group U on
Lp( 
Ω) such that T (t) = PU(t)j for all t ⩾0. Let −
A be the generator of U. By Sec-
tion 4.7.1 the H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for 
A is bounded (ϕ > π/2). It is obvious that this carries
over to the H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus of A, cf. Section 5.2.2.
□
4.7.5. Holomorphic positive contraction semigroups.
The angle obtained in Section 4.7.3
can be improved if the semigroup is bounded holomorphic. In fact, the following result due
to Kalton and Weis [KW01], Corollary 5.2, is proved with the help of R-boundedness tech-
niques which will be presented in Section 6.
THEOREM. Let 1 < p < ∞. Let −A be the generator of a bounded holomorphic
C0-semigroup T on Lp(Ω). Assume that
T (t) ⩾0,
T (t)
L(Lp(Ω)) ⩽1
for all t ⩾0.
Then A has a bounded H ∞-calculus and ϕH ∞(A) < π/2.
5. Form methods and functional calculus
On Hilbert space generators of contraction C0-semigroups are characterized by m-accreti-
vity. This most convenient criterion also implies boundedness of the H ∞-calculus, as an
easy consequence of the Spectral Theorem after a dilation to a unitary group. If the semi-
group is holomorphic, then conversely, a bounded H ∞-calculus also implies m-accretivity
after rescaling and changing the scalar product. In addition, the generator is associated
with a closed form. The interesting interplay of forms, m-accretivity and H ∞-calculus on
Hilbert space, this is the subject of the present section.
5.1. Bounded H ∞-calculus on Hilbert space
Things are much simpler on Hilbert space than on general Banach spaces. The BIP property
is equivalent to bounded H ∞-calculus and all angles can be chosen optimal as was shown
in Section 4.4.10, (4.26) and (4.34). We reformulate this more formally.
THEOREM (McIntosh). Let A be an injective, sectorial operator on a Hilbert space. The
following are equivalent:
(i) A ∈BIP;
(ii) for all ϕ > ϕsec(A), the H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus is bounded;
(iii) the H ∞(Σπ)-calculus is bounded.
In that case ϕbip(A) = ϕsec(A).
This optimal situation in Hilbert space contrasts the Lp-case, p ̸= 2, where we had
seen that property BIP does not imply boundedness of the H ∞(Σπ)-calculus (see Sec-
tion 4.5.3). Also had we seen that it can happen that ϕsec(A) < π < ϕbip(A) on Lp, p ̸= 2.

36
W. Arendt
Also the Dore–Venni theorem needs fewer hypotheses on Hilbert space.
THEOREM (Dore–Venni on Hilbert space [DoVe87]). Let A and B be two commuting
injective, sectorial operators on a Hilbert space such that ϕsec(A) + ϕsec(B) < π. Assume
that A ∈BIP. Then A + B is closed.
We mention that this result does not hold on Lp for p ̸= 2 ([Lan98], Theorem 2.3).
5.2. m-accretive operators on Hilbert space
The simplest unbounded operators are multiplication operators. Let (Ω,Σ,μ) be a mea-
sure space and let m:Ω →R be a measurable function. Deﬁne Am on L2(Ω) by
Amu = mu with domain
D(Am) =

u ∈L2(Ω): m · u ∈L2(Ω)

.
For the operator Am one has the best possible spectral calculus. For each f ∈L∞(R),
we may deﬁne f (A) = Af ◦m ∈L(L2(Ω)). It is not difﬁcult to see that this deﬁnition is
consistent with our previous one whenever f ∈H ∞(Σϕ) for some ϕ > π/2.
5.2.1. The Spectral theorem.
The spectral theorem says that each self-adjoint operator is
unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator.
SPECTRAL THEOREM. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then there exists a
measure space (Ω,Σ,μ), a measurable function m:Ω →R and a unitary operator
U :H →L2(Ω) such that
(a) UD(A) = D(Am);
(b) AmUx = UAx, x ∈D(A).
Thus, multiplication operators and self-adjoint operators are just the same thing.
Now recall that an operator A generates a unitary group (i.e., a C0-group of unitary
operators) if and only if iA is self-adjoint. Thus iA is equivalent to a multiplication opera-
tor. This shows in particular that each generator A of a unitary group on H has a bounded
H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for all ϕ > π/2. In fact, it is easy to show that for f ∈H ∞(Σϕ) one has
f (A) = U−1Af ◦mU.
5.2.2. Bounded H ∞-calculus for m-accretive operators.
Recall that an operator A on
a Hilbert space H is called m-accretive if
(a) Re(Ax|x) ⩾0 for all x ∈D(A);
(b) I + A is surjective.
The Lumer–Phillips theorem asserts that an operator A is m-accretive if and only if
−A generates a contractive C0-semigroup. In particular, if A is m-accretive, then A is
sectorial and ϕsec(A) ⩽π
2 .

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
37
THEOREM. Let A be an m-accretive operator on H . Then A has a bounded
H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for each ϕ > ϕsec(A).
PROOF. Denote by T the semigroup generated by −A. By the dilation theorem [[Dav80],
p. 157] there exist a Hilbert space 
H containing H as a closed subspace and a unitary
group U on 
H such that
P ◦U(t) ◦i = T (t),
t ⩾0,
where i :H →
H is the injection of H into 
H and P : 
H →H is the orthogonal pro-
jection. Denote by 
A the generator of U. Then i
A is selfadjoint. Thus 
A has a bounded
H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for any ϕ > π/2. It is easy to see from the deﬁnitions that
f (A) = P ◦f

A
	
◦i.
Thus f (A) ∈L(H) for all f ∈H ∞(Σϕ) (and even ∥f (A)∥⩽∥f (
A)∥⩽∥f ∥L∞(Σπ/2)).
Thus A has a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for all ϕ > π
2 . Now by McIntosh’s result in
Section 5.1 the H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus is also bounded for ϕ > ϕsec(A).
□
5.2.3. Equivalence of bounded H ∞-calculus and m-accretivity.
Let (·|·)1 be an equiva-
lent scalar product on H , i.e., there exist α > 0,β > 0 such that
α∥u∥2
H ⩽(u|u)1 ⩽β∥u∥2
H
for all u ∈H . Of course, having a bounded H ∞-calculus is independent of the equivalent
norm on H we choose. Thus, if A is a sectorial operator on H which is m-accretive with
respect to some equivalent scalar product, then A ∈H ∞. This describes already the class
of all operators A with bounded H ∞-calculus.
THEOREM (Le Merdy [LeM98a]). Let A be an injective, sectorial operator on H such
that ϕsec(A) < π/2. The following are equivalent:
(i) A ∈H ∞,
(ii) there exists an equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H such that Re(Au|u)1 ⩾0 for
all u ∈D(A);
(iii) let 0 ⩽ϕ < ϕsec(A); then there exists an equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H such
that (Au|u) ∈Σϕ for all u ∈D(A).
Denote by T the C0-semigroup generated by −A. Then (ii) means that

The proof of Le Merdy [LeM98a] uses the theory of completely bounded operators and
a deep theorem of Paulsen. A more direct proof, based directly on “quadratic estimates”,
is given by Haase [Haa02].
The theorem gives a very satisfying characterization of the boundedness of the
H ∞-calculus; see also Section 5.3 for a description by forms. However, it is restricted
to sectorial operators of sectorial type smaller than π/2:
5.2.4. Counterexample.
There exists an invertible, sectorial operator A on a Hilbert
space H such that −A generates a bounded C0-semigroup T on H . Moreover, A has
a bounded H ∞(Σϕ)-calculus for any ϕ > π/2. But for all ω > 0, A + ω is not accretive
with respect to any equivalent scalar product.
The counterexample is due to Le Merdy [LeM98a] (based on a famous example of Pisier
solving the Halmos problem) with an additional argument by Haase [Haa02] (taking care
of the case where ω > 0).
5.3. Form methods
A most efﬁcient way to deﬁne generators of holomorphic semigroups on a Hilbert space
H is the form method (sometimes it is also called “variational method”).
Let H be a Hilbert space. If V is another Hilbert space we write V →H if V is a sub-
space of H such that the embedding is continuous. We write V →d H if in addition V is
dense in H .
DEFINITION. A closed form on H is a sesquilinear form a :V × V →C which is contin-
uous, i.e.,
a(u,v)
 ⩽M∥u∥V ∥v∥V ,
u,v ∈V,
(5.1)
for some M ⩾0 and elliptic, i.e.,
Rea(u,u) + ω∥u∥2
H ⩾α∥u∥2
V ,
u ∈V,
(5.2)
for some ω ∈R, α > 0. The space V is called the domain of a.
Properly speaking, a closed form is a couple (a,V ) with the properties stipulated in the
above deﬁnition. Note that by (5.2),
∥u∥a :=

Rea(u,u) + ω∥u∥2
H
	1/2
deﬁnes an equivalent norm on V . Sometimes we will write D(a) instead of V and will use
the norm ∥· ∥a on D(a) for which D(a) is complete by hypothesis.

39
REMARK. Let a :D(a) × D(a) →C be sesquilinear, where D(a) is a subspace of H .
Assume that a is bounded below, i.e.,
∥u∥2
a := Rea(u,u) + ω∥u∥2
H ⩾∥u∥2
H
for all u ∈D(a) and some ω ∈R. Then ∥· ∥a deﬁnes a norm on D(a). The form is contin-
uous with respect to this norm if and only if a(u,u) ∈ω1 + Σθ for some ω1 ∈R and some
θ ∈(0,π/2], i.e., if and only if the form a is sectorial in the terminology of Kato [[Kat66]].
5.3.1. The operator associated with a closed form.
Let a be a closed form on H with
dense domain V . Then we associate an operator A with a, given by
D(A) = u ∈V : ∃v ∈H such that a(u,ϕ) = (v|ϕ)H for all ϕ ∈V ,
Au = v.
Note that v is well deﬁned since V is dense in H . We call A the operator associated
with a. It is not difﬁcult to see that A + ω is sectorial with angle ϕsec(A + ω) < π/2.
Moreover, A + ω is m-accretive (where ω is the constant occurring in (5.2)). Thus we
obtain the following.
THEOREM. Let A be an operator associated with a closed form. Then there exists ω ∈R
such that A + ω ∈H ∞.
5.3.2. Example: self-adjoint operators.
Let a be a densely deﬁned closed form on H
with domain V . Assume that a is symmetric; i.e., a(u,v) = a(v,u) for all u,v ∈V . Let
A be the operator associated with a. Then A is bounded below (i.e., (Au|u) ⩾−ω∥u∥2
H
for all u ∈D(A) and some ω ∈R) and self-adjoint. Conversely, let A be a self-adjoint
operator which is bounded below. Then A is associated with a densely deﬁned symmetric
closed form.
We give a classical concrete example right now. Later we will study elliptic operators in
more detail.
5.3.3. Example (The Laplacian with Dirichlet and with Neumann boundary conditions).
Let Ω ⊂Rn be open and H = L2(Ω). Let W 1,2(Ω) := {u ∈L2(Ω): Dju ∈L2(Ω),
j = 1,...,n} be the ﬁrst Sobolev space and let W 1,2
0
(Ω) be the closure of the space D(Ω)
of all test functions in W 1,2(Ω). Deﬁne a :W 1,2(Ω) × W 1,2(Ω) →C by
a(u,v) =

Ω
∇u∇v dx.
(a) Let V = W 1,2
0
(Ω). Then a is a closed symmetric form. Denote by −D
Ω the oper-
ator associated with a. Then it is easy to see that D(D
Ω) = {u ∈W 1,2
0
(Ω): u ∈L2(Ω)},
D
Ωu = u, in D(Ω)′. We call D
Ω the Dirichlet Laplacian on L2(Ω).

40
W. Arendt
(b) Let V = W 1,2(Ω). Then a is closed and symmetric. Denote by −N
Ω the op-
erator associated with a. Then N
Ω is a self-adjoint operator, called the Neumann
Laplacian. This can be justiﬁed if Ω is bounded with Lipschitz boundary. Then
D(N
Ω) = {u ∈W 1,2(Ω): u ∈L2(Ω); ∂u
∂v = 0 weakly}, where the weak sense has to be
explained. We omit the details. And indeed, for many purposes it is not important to know
in which sense the Neumann boundary condition ∂u
∂v = 0 is realized. The interesting point
is that the Neumann–Laplacian can be deﬁned for arbitrary open sets without using the
normal derivative.
5.3.4. Characterization of operators deﬁned by forms.
Let A be an operator on H .
We say that A is induced by a form, if there exists a densely deﬁned closed form a on H
such that A is associated with a. It is easy to describe such operators by an accretivity-
condition.
THEOREM [[Kat66]]. Let A be an operator on H . The following are equivalent:
(i) A is induced by a form;
(ii) there exist ω ∈R and 0 < θ < π
2 such that
(a) (ω + A)D(A) = H ;
(b) e±iθ(ω + A) is accretive.
(iii) −A generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup T of angle θ ∈(0, π
2 ) such that for
some ω ∈R,
T (z)
 ⩽eω|z|,
z ∈Σθ;
(iv) the numerical range W(A) := {(Ax|x): x ∈D(A),∥x∥= 1} is contained in
Σθ + ω for some θ ∈(0,π/2), ω ∈R and (−∞,ω) ∩ρ(A) ̸= ∅.
Property (ii) is sometimes formulated by saying that A is strongly quasi-m-accretive
(and strongly m-accretive if ω = 0).
5.3.5. Changing scalar products.
Let a :V × V →C be a closed densely deﬁned form
on H . The deﬁnition of the associated operator A depends on the scalar product on H .
Let (·|·)1 be another equivalent scalar product on H . Then there exists a self-adjoint oper-
ator Q ∈L(H) such that
(Qu|v)1 = (u|v)
for all u,v ∈H,
and Q is strictly form-positive. By this we mean that (Qu|u) ⩾ε∥u∥2
H for all u ∈H and
some ε > 0. Let u ∈D(A). Then u ∈V and a(u,ϕ) = (Au|ϕ) = (QAu|ϕ)1 for all ϕ ∈V .
This shows that the operator A1 associated with a on (H,(·|·)1) is given by A1 = QA. With
the help of Le Merdy’s theorem in Section 5.2.3 one obtains the following characterization
of the class H ∞.
THEOREM [ABH01]. Let A be an operator on H . The following are equivalent:
(i) A + ω ∈H ∞for some ω ⩾0;

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
41
(ii) there exists an equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H such that A is induced by
a form on (H,(·|·)1);
(iii) there exists a strictly form-positive self-adjoint operator Q ∈L(H) such that QA
is induced by a form.
We remark that the rescaling A + ω is needed to obtain a sectorial operator. From Sec-
tion 4.6 we know that for an invertible sectorial operator A and ω > 0 one has
A ∈H ∞
if and only if
A + ω ∈H ∞.
5.3.6. More on equivalent scalar products.
In the Section 5.3.5 we characterized those
operators A which come from a form on (H,(·|·)1) for some equivalent scalar product.
What happens if we replace “some” by “all ”?
THEOREM (Matolcsi [Mat03]). Let A be an operator on H . The following are equivalent:
(i) A is bounded;
(ii) for each equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H , the operator A is induced by a form
on (H,(·|·)1).
5.4. Form sums and Trotter’s product formula
There is a natural way to deﬁne the sum of closed forms leading to a closed form again.
Here we want to allow also nondense form domains. Let H be a Hilbert space.
5.4.1. Closed forms with nondense domain.
We deﬁne closed forms on H as before but
omit the assumption that the form domain be dense in H . Thus, a closed form a on H
is a sesquilinear form a :D(a) × D(a) →C, where D(a) is a subspace of H (the form
domain) such that, for some ω ∈R, α ∈[0,π/2):
(a) a(u,u) + (ω −1)∥u∥2
H ∈Σα, u ∈D(a);
(b) (D(a),∥· ∥a) is complete, where ∥u∥2
a = Rea(u,u) + ω∥u∥2
H .
Then one can show that a is a continuous sesquilinear form on V = (D(a),∥· ∥a). Thus
(5.1) and (5.2) are satisﬁed.
Denote by A the operator on D(a) (the closure of D(a) in H ) associated with a. Then
−A generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup (e−tA)t⩾0 on D(a). We extend this semigroup
by 0 to H deﬁning
e−tax :=
e−tAx
if x ∈D(a),
0
if x ∈D(a)⊥,
(5.3)
for t > 0 and letting e−0a the orthogonal projection onto D(a). Then t →e−ta :
[0,∞) →L(H) is strongly continuous and satisﬁes the semigroup property
e−tae−sa = e−(t+s)a,
t,s ⩾0.

42
W. Arendt
We call (e−ta)t⩾0 the semigroup on H associated with the closed form a. Before giving
examples we consider form sums.
5.4.2. Form sums.
Now let a and b be two closed forms on H . Then D(a) ∩D(b) is
a Hilbert space for the norm (∥u∥2
a + ∥u∥2
b)1/2. Hence, a + b with domain D(a + b) =
D(a) ∩D(b) is a closed form again.
THEOREM. Let a and b be two closed forms on H . Then Trotter’s formula
e−t(a+b)x = lim
n→∞

e−(t/n)ae−(t/n)b	nx
(5.4)
holds for all x ∈H , t ⩾0.
This result is due to Kato [Kat78] for the case of symmetric forms and it was generalized
to closed forms by Simon (see [Kat78], Theorem and Addendum).
It is interesting that this result can be applied in particular when e−tb ≡P , where P is
an orthogonal projection. This is done in the following section.
5.4.3. Induced semigroups.
Let a be a closed form on H . Let H1 be a closed subspace
of H . Even if H1 is not invariant under (e−ta)t⩾0 there is a natural induced semigroup
on H1. In fact, let D(b) = H1 and b ≡0. Then e−tb ≡P , the orthogonal projection
onto H1. Thus by Trotter’s formula (5.4),
e−ta1x = lim
n→∞

e−ta/nP
	nx
(5.5)
converges for all x ∈H , where D(a1) = D(a) ∩H1 and a1(u,v) = a(u,v) for all
u,v ∈D(a1). Then (e−ta1)t⩾0 is a C0-semigroup on H1 if and only if D(a) ∩H1 is dense
in H1.
5.4.4. Nonconvergence of Trotter’s formula.
Before giving a concrete example we want
to point out that this way to induce a semigroup on closed subspaces via (5.5) does not
work for arbitrary contraction semigroups.
THEOREM (Matolcsi [Mat03]). Let −A be the generator of a contraction C0-semigroup T
on H . The following assertion are equivalent:
(i) A is induced by a form;
(ii) limn→∞(T (t/n)P)nx converges for each t > 0, x ∈H , and each orthogonal pro-
jection P .
5.4.5. From the Gaussian semigroup to the Dirichlet Laplacian.
Denote by G the
Gaussian semigroup on L2(Rn), i.e.,
G(t)f (x) = (4πt)−n/2

Rn e−(x−y)2/4tf (y)dy

for all t > 0, f ∈L2(Rn), x ∈Rn. Then G is associated with the form a(u,v) =

Rn ∇u∇v dx with domain D(a) = W 1,2(Rn). Now let Ω ⊂Rn be an open subset of Rn.
We identify L2(Ω) with the space {f ∈L2(Rn): f (x) = 0 a.e. on Ωc}. Then the or-
thogonal projection P onto L2(Ω) is given by Pf = 1Ωf for all f ∈L2(Rn). Now let
W 1,2
0
( 
Ω) = W 1,2(Rn) ∩L2(Ω) = {u ∈W 1,2(Rn): u(x) = 0 a.e. on Ωc}. Consider the
form b on W 1,2
0
( 
Ω) given by b(u,v) =

Ω ∇u∇v. Then, by (5.5), we have
e−tbf = lim
n→∞
G(t/n)1Ω

(5.6)
for all f ∈L2(Rn). Now we consider the more familiar space W 1,2
0
(Ω). For u ∈W 1,2
0
(Ω)
let ˜u(x) = u(x) for x ∈Ω and ˜u(x) = 0 for x ∈Ωc. Then ˜u ∈W 1,2
0
( 
Ω) and Dj ˜u = 
Dju.
Thus we may identify W 1,2
0
(Ω) with a subspace of W 1,2
0
( 
Ω). One says that Ω is stable, if
W 1,2
0
(Ω) = W 1,2
0
( 
Ω). For example, if Ω has Lipschitz boundary, then Ω is stable. Thus
Ω is stable if and only if (e−tb)t⩾0 is the semigroup generated by the Dirichlet Laplacian
with the canonical extension to L2(Rn), i.e.,

Thus, if Ω is stable, then the semigroup generated by the Dirichlet Laplacian is obtained
from the Gaussian semigroup via Trotter’s formula (5.6).
Stable open sets can be characterized as follows. Let Ω be an open, bounded set in Rn.
We assume that the boundary ∂Ω of Ω is a null-set (for the n-dimensional Lebesgue
measure), and that

Ω = Ω. By

( 

(ii) cap(G \ 

(iii) for each function u ∈C( 
Ω), which is harmonic on Ω, there exist un harmonic on
an open neighborhood of 
Ω which converge to u uniformly on 
Ω as n →∞.
It is interesting that these properties do not imply Dirichlet regularity. In fact, if Ω is the

5.5. The square root property
Let H be a Hilbert space. During this section we consider a continuous sesquilinear form
a :V × V →C which is coercive with respect to H , i.e.,
Rea(u,u) ⩾ν∥u∥2
V ,
u ∈V,
where V →d H and ν > 0. This means that the ellipticity condition (5.2) is satisﬁed
for ω = 0. We consider the operator A on H which is associated with a. Thus A is a sec-
torial operator and 0 ∈ρ(A).
5.5.1. The square root property.
We say that the operator A (or the form a) has the square
root property if V = D(A1/2). It is easy to see that this is the case if a is symmetric (see the
Example below). But an example of McIntosh [McI82] shows that the square root property
does not hold for all closed, coercive forms. Here is an easy characterization of the square
root property.
PROPOSITION. The following are equivalent:
(i) D(A1/2) = V ,
(ii) D(A∗1/2) = V ,
(iii) D(A1/2) = D(A∗1/2).
In that case the three norms ∥· ∥V , ∥A1/2x∥and ∥A∗1/2x∥are equivalent. This is an im-
mediate consequence of the Closed Graph theorem since all three spaces are continuously
embedded into H . Of course one may also ask whether (iii) is valid for other powers α
than α = 1
2. Surprisingly, by a result of Kato [[Kat66]] one always has
D

Aα	
= D

A∗α	
for all 0 < α < 1
2 for each m-accretive operator. Thus α = 1
2 is the critical power for which
things may go wrong.
5.5.2. Induced operators on V and V ′.
Since V →d H , we may identify H with a sub-
space of V ′. Indeed, given x ∈H , we deﬁne jx ∈V ′ by jx(y) = (x|y)H. Then j :H →V ′,
x →jx is linear, continuous and has dense image. We will identify x and jx so that
V →
d H →
d V ′.
By the Lax–Milgram theorem, there is an isomorphism AV ′ :V →V ′ given by ⟨AV ′u,v⟩=
a(u,v), u,v ∈V . Here V ′ denotes the space of all continuous, anti-linear forms on V
(i.e., V ′ = { ¯ϕ: ϕ ∈V ∗}, V ∗the dual space of V ). The operator −AV ′ generates a
bounded holomorphic C0-semigroup TV ′ on V ′ (see [[Tan79], Section 3.5]). Moreover,
TV ′(t)|H = T (t), the semigroup generated by −A on H and, clearly, A is the part of AV ′
in H . Finally, the part of AV ′ in V , i.e., the operator AV given by AV u = Au with do-
main D(AV ) = {u ∈D(A): Au ∈V } is similar to AV ′ and −AV generates a holomorphic

45
C0-semigroup TV which is the restriction of T to V . Thus, AV and AV ′ are always similar;
but AV and A are not, unless A has the square root property:
THEOREM. The following are equivalent:
(i) D(A1/2) = V ;
(ii) AV ∈H ∞;
(iii) AV ′ ∈H ∞;
(iv) AV and A are similar.
Thus, one can describe the square root property by the boundedness of the H ∞-calculus
of AV (or AV ′).
Before giving a proof of the Theorem we determine the diverse notions in the case of
self-adjoint operators.
EXAMPLE (Self-adjoint operators). Assume that the form a deﬁned at the beginning of the
section is symmetric. Then the associated operator A is self-adjoint. Thus, by the spectral
theorem, we may assume that H = L2(Ω,Σ,μ) and Au = m · u, D(A) = {u ∈L2(Ω):
mu ∈L2(Ω)}, where m:Ω →[ν,∞) is measurable. Then V = L2(Ω,mdμ) and
a(u,v) =

ω mu¯v dμ. Moreover, V ′ = L2(Ω,1/mdμ) and ⟨u,v⟩=

Ω u¯v dμ for all
u ∈V ′, v ∈V . The operator AV ′ is given by D(AV ′) = V = L2(Ω,mdμ), AV ′u = mu,
and AV is given by AV u = mu with domain D(AV ) = {u ∈V : mu ∈V } = L2(Ω,m3 dμ).
Now, A−α is a bounded operator on H given by A−αu = m−αu. Thus D(Aα) =
{m−αu: u ∈L2(Ω)} = L2(Ω,m2α dμ). It is clear that D(Aα) = [H,D(A)]α for all
0 < α < 1.
REMARK (Deﬁnition of the complex interpolation space). Let V →d H . It is possible
to deﬁne the complex interpolation spaces with help of the spectral theorem. Indeed,
a(u,v) = (u|v)V deﬁnes a continuous, coercive form on V . Then we can assume that
V = L2(Ω,mdμ) and H = L2(Ω,dμ). Then [H,V ]α = L2(Ω,mα dμ) for 0 < α < 1,
where [H,V ]α denotes the complex interpolation space.
PROOF OF THE THEOREM. The operator A−1/2 :H →D(A1/2) is an isomorphism. If
V = D(A1/2), then AV = A−1/2AA1/2, i.e., A and AV are similar. This shows that
(i) ⇒(iv). Since A ∈H ∞, (iv) implies (ii). And (ii) implies (iii) since AV and AV ′
are always similar. Finally we show that (iii) implies (i). From the previous remark it
is clear that H = [V ′,V ]1/2. Now if AV ′ ∈H ∞, then, by Section 4.4.10, D(A1/2
V ′ ) =
[V ′,D(AV ′)]1/2 = [V ′,V ]1/2 = H , i.e., H = A−1/2

(V ′). This implies that

5.6. Groups and cosine functions
In the preceding sections we have characterized those sectorial operators A on a Hilbert
space with sectorial angle ϕsec(A) < π/2 which have a bounded H ∞-calculus. This is

46
W. Arendt
equivalent to saying that A is deﬁned by a closed form on (H,(·|·)1) for some equiva-
lent scalar product (·|·)1. Now we will see that squares of group generators are always of
this form.
5.6.1. Groups on Hilbert spaces.
Let U be a bounded C0-group on a Hilbert space H .
Then, by a classical result of Sz.-Nagy, there exists an equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H
such that the group is unitary in (H(·|·)1). Concerning arbitrary C0-groups the following
holds (see, e.g., [Haa03a]).
PROPOSITION. Let B be the generator of a C0-group on H . Then there exists a bounded
operator C on H such that B + C generates a bounded C0-group.
Thus, on Hilbert space, up to equivalent scalar product, each generator of a C0-group
B is of the form
B = iB0 + C,
where B0 is self-adjoint and C bounded.
5.6.2. Squares of generators of C0-groups.
Let B be the generator of a C0-group. Then
B2 generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup of angle π/2. Thus, for each 0 < θ < π/2,
there exists ω ∈R such that −B2 + ωI is sectorial and ϕsec(−B2 + ωI) < θ.
THEOREM (Haase [Haa03a]). Let A = −B2, where B generates a C0-group on a Hilbert
space. Then there exists ω ∈R such that A + ω ∈H ∞.
Operators of the form B2 −ω with B a group generator are the same as generators
of cosine functions. This holds in Hilbert spaces, and more generally on UMD-spaces.
We describe these facts, starting on arbitrary Banach spaces ﬁrst and concluding with the
square root property.
5.6.3. Cosine functions.
Let X be a Banach space. A cosine function on X is a strongly
continuous function C :R →L(X) satisfying
2C(t)C(s) = C(t + s) + C(t −s),
s,t ∈R,
C(0) = I.
In that case there exist M ⩾1, ω ∈R such that
C(t)
 ⩽Meωt,
t ⩾0.
Moreover, there is a unique operator A such that (ω,∞) ⊂ρ(A) and

for all x ∈X, λ > ω. We call A the generator of C. The cosine function C generated by A
governs the second-order Cauchy problem deﬁned by A
 ¨u(t) = Au(t),
t ∈R,
u(0) = x,
˙u(0) = y.

We will make this more precise. Introducing the function v = ˙u, problem (5.7) can be

However, the operator

with domain D(A)×X generates a C0-semigroup on X×X
if and only if A is bounded (see [[ABHN01], Section 3.14.9]). Thus, another space than
X × X has to be considered.
THEOREM [[ABHN01], Section 3.14.11]. Let A be an operator on a Banach space X.
The following assertions are equivalent:

In that case the Banach space W is uniquely determined by property (ii). We call
W × X the phase space of problem (5.7). The phase space is important to produce classical
solutions:

u ∈C2(R,X) ∩C(R,D(A)) of (5.7).
So far we have described well-posedness of the second-order Cauchy problem (5.7) in
arbitrary Banach spaces. Now we come back to the initial subject of this section.
5.6.4. Squares of group generators and cosine functions.
On UMD-spaces one has the
following characterization.
THEOREM (Fattorini [[ABHN01], Section 3.16.8]). Let A be an operator on a UMD-spa-
ce X. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) A generates a cosine function;

48
W. Arendt
(ii) there exist a generator B of a C0-group on X and ω ⩾0 such that
A = B2 + ωI.
In that case, the phase space is D(B) × X, where D(B) carries the graph norm.
This theorem explains why Lp-spaces for p ̸= 2 are not so good as functional frame-
work for hyperbolic problems: There are not many groups operating on Lp for p ̸= 2. For
example, the Laplacian  generates a cosine function on Lp(Rn) if and only if p = 2
or n = 1. On the other hand, on Hilbert spaces there are many C0-groups since there are
many self-adjoint operators. This explains from an abstract point of view why many exam-
ples of well-posed second-order problems exist on Hilbert space (see Section 8.9). In view
of the results mentioned so far, they all are related to self-adjoint operators.
5.6.5. Forms and cosine functions.
Let H be a Hilbert space. If −A generates a co-
sine function, then it follows from Sections 5.6.4 and 5.6.2 that A + ω ∈H ∞for ω large
enough. Thus, after changing the scalar product on H , the operator A is associated with
a closed form. Now let us assume that A is associated with a coercive, continuous form
a :V × V →C, where V →d H . Assume in addition that −A generates a cosine function.
Then by Fattorini’s theorem [[ABHN01], Section 3.16.7] B = iA1/2 generates a C0-group.
Thus, the phase space is D(A1/2)×H . Now it becomes apparent why the square root prop-
erty is interesting in this context. The given known space is V (for example in applications,
V may be a Sobolev space). One would like to know whether V × H is the phase space of
the second-order Cauchy problem.
5.6.6. Numerical range in a parabola.
If A is an operator on a Hilbert space, then
A comes from a form if and only if the numerical range of A
W(A) =

(Ax|x)H: x ∈D(A),∥x∥= 1

is contained in a sector Σθ + ω for some ω ∈R, θ ∈[0,π/2) and (−∞,ω) ∩ρ(A) ̸= ∅
(see Section 5.3.4). Now assume that −A is the generator of a cosine function. Then the
spectrum σ(A) is contained in a parabola
Pω =

ξ + iη ∈C: ξ ⩽ω2 −η2/4ω2
for some ω ∈R [[ABHN01], Section 3.14.18]. Recall that σ(A) ⊂W(A) by [[Kat66],
Section V.3.2].
THEOREM (McIntosh [McI82], Theorems A and C). Let a be a closed densely deﬁned
form on H with associated operator A. Assume that the numerical range W(A) of A is
contained in a parabola Pω for some ω ∈R. Then A has the square root property.
Generators of cosine functions can be characterized by a real condition on the resolvent
[[ABHN01], Section 3.15.3] which is however of little practical use. Much more interesting
is the following most remarkable new criterion:

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
49
THEOREM (Crouzeix [Cro03]). Let a :V × V →C be a closed densely deﬁned form on
a Hilbert space H such that
a(u,u) ∈Pω,
u ∈V,∥u∥H = 1,
for some ω ∈R. Then the associated operator generates a cosine function.
Haase [Haa03a], Corollary 5.18, proved that also the converse implication holds: If
A generates a cosine function on a Hilbert space, then there exist an equivalent scalar
product (·|·)1 on H , a closed form a : V × V →C on H with V →d H such that −A is
associated with the form a on (H,(·|·)1) and
a(u,u) ∈Pω,
u ∈V,∥u∥H = 1,
for some ω ∈R. Thus, in view of Section 5.3.4 we can formulate the following beautiful
characterization.
COROLLARY. Let A be an operator on a Hilbert space H . The following assertions are
equivalent:
(i) A generates a cosine function;
(ii) there exists an equivalent scalar product (·|·)1 on H and ω ∈R such that
−(Au|u)1 ∈Pω,
u ∈D(A),∥u∥H = 1,
and ρ(−A) ∩Pω ̸= ∅.
6. Fourier multipliers and maximal regularity
The Fourier transform is a classical tool to treat differential equations. In order to apply
it to partial differential equations, vector-valued functions have to be considered. Prob-
lems of regularity, but also of asymptotic behavior, can frequently be reformulated as the
question whether a certain operator is an Lp-Fourier multiplier. Michlin’s theorem gives
a most convenient criterion for this. It was Weis [Wei00a] (after previous work by Clément
et al. [CPSW00]) who discovered the right formulation of Michlin’s theorem in the vector-
valued case.
We describe the situation in the periodic case which is technically easier, and ideas
become more transparent in this case. Still, the periodic case leads to the main application,
namely characterization of maximal regularity for the nonhomogeneous Cauchy problem.
6.1. Vector-valued Fourier series and periodic multipliers
It was the study of the heat equation which lead Fourier to the introduction of one of the
most fundamental concepts of Analysis. In the same spirit, vector-valued Fourier series
help us to understand arbitrary abstract evolution equations.

tion f ; i.e.,

for all k ∈Z
if and only if
f (t) = 0 a.e.
(6.1)
DEFINITION. Let 1 ⩽p ⩽∞. A sequence (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(X) is an Lp
2π-multiplier if, for
each f ∈Lp
2π(X), there exists a function g ∈Lp
2π(X) such that
Mk ˆf (k) = ˆg(k),
k ∈Z.
In that case, by the closed graph theorem, the mapping M := (f →g) deﬁnes a
bounded linear operator from Lp
2π(X) into Lp
2π(X), which we call the operator associ-
ated with (Mk)k∈Z.
Let ek(t) = eikt, t ∈R, k ∈Z, and for x ∈X, denote by ek ⊗x the function t →eiktx.
Linear combinations of such functions are called trigonometric polynomials. By Fejér’s
theorem [[ABHN01], Theorem 4.2.19], the space of all trigonometric polynomials is dense
in Lp
2π(X). Note that the associated operator M acts on trigonometric polynomials by

6.1.1. Multipliers on Hilbert spaces.
If H is a Hilbert space, then the Fourier transform
f →ˆf is an isometric isomorphism of L2
2π(H) onto ℓ2(H) (the space of all sequences
(xk)k∈Z in ℓ2(H) such that 
k∈Z ∥xk∥2 < ∞). This follows easily from the scalar case by
considering an orthonormal basis of H . As a consequence, if H is a Hilbert space, then a
sequence (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(H) is an L2
2π-multiplier if and only if it is bounded. If 1 < p < ∞
and p ̸= 2, then multipliers can no longer be characterized in a satisfying way, even in

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
51
the scalar case. An important subject of harmonic analysis is to ﬁnd sufﬁcient conditions.
In the scalar case the following is a special case of Marcinkiewicz’ multiplier theorem.
We state it on Hilbert space (where it is a special case of the Theorem in Section 6.1.5).
THEOREM. Let H be a Hilbert space and let (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(H) be a bounded sequence
satisfying
sup
k∈Z
k(Mk+1 −Mk)
 < ∞.
(M1)
Then (Mk)k∈Z is an Lp
2π-multiplier for 1 < p < ∞.
6.1.2. Characterization of Hilbert spaces.
Even if p = 2, the Theorem in Section 6.1.1
does no longer hold for Banach spaces other than Hilbert space.
THEOREM. Let X be a Banach space and let 1 < p < ∞. Assume that each bounded
sequence (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(X) satisfying (M1) is an Lp
2π-multiplier. Then X is isomorphic to
Hilbert space.
An explicit proof of this theorem is given in [ArBu03b], Proposition 1.17. It is based on
a deep characterization of Hilbert spaces due to Kwapien. It was Pisier (unpublished) who
had discovered that certain classical operator-valued multiplier theorems hold merely on
Hilbert spaces.
6.1.3. UMD-spaces and the Riesz-projection.
In order to obtain an operator-valued mul-
tiplier result one has to replace boundedness in operator norm in (M1) by a stronger as-
sumption (R-boundedness), and a restricted class of Banach spaces has to be considered.
DEFINITION. Let X be a Banach space. For k ∈Z, let
Mk =
I
if k ⩾0,
0
if k < 0.
(6.3)
We say that X is a UMD-space if the sequence (Mk)k∈Z is an Lp
2π(X)-multiplier for all
(equivalently one) p ∈(1,∞). The associated operator R is called the Riesz-projection.
Note that the sequence (6.3) satisﬁes condition (M1) of Section 6.1.1.
The letters UMD stay for “unconditional martingale differences” and refer to an equiv-
alent property introduced and studied by Burkholder [Bur83]. Here we will not be con-
fronted with martingales and use the term UMD just for saying that the Riesz-projection is
bounded.
EXAMPLES. (a) The space Lq(Y) is a UMD-space if 1 < q < ∞for any σ-ﬁnite measure
space (Y,Σ,μ).
(b) Every closed subspace of a UMD-space is a UMD-space.

52
W. Arendt
(c) Each UMD-space is reﬂexive (even superreﬂexive).
(d) It follows from (a)–(c) that, for any nonempty open subset Ω of Rn, the Sobolev
space W k,p(Ω) is a UMD-space if and only if 1 < p < ∞, where k ∈N0.
(e) If Ω ⊂Rn is a nonempty open bounded set, then C( 
Ω) is not a UMD-space.
6.1.4. R-boundedness.
In order to formulate an operator-valued version of Marcinkie-
wicz’s theorem we need a new notion of boundedness for sets of operators. Recall that
a series ∞
k=1 xk in a Banach space is called unconditionally convergent if the series
∞
k=1 εkxk converges for any choice of signs (εk)k∈N ∈{−1,1}N. This implies conver-
gences of ∞
k=1 αkxk for each α = (αk)k∈N ∈ℓ∞. But in general, this does not imply that
∞
k=1 ∥xk∥< ∞, unless X is ﬁnite dimensional. We introduce the means over all signs

(6.4)
DEFINITION. Let X,Y be Banach spaces. A subset T of L(X,Y) is called R-bounded if
there exists a constant c ⩾0 such that
(T1x1,...,Tnxn)

R ⩽c
(x1,...,xn)

R
(6.5)
for all T1,...,Tn ∈T , x1,...,xn ∈X, n ∈N. The least constant c such that (6.5) is satis-
ﬁed is called the R-bound of T and is denoted by R(T ).
The notion of R-boundedness was introduced by Berkson and Gillespie [BG94], where
the “R” stands for ‘Riesz’. Since the mean
(x1,...,xn)

R
can be expressed in terms of Rademacher functions some pronounce it “Rademacher
bounded”. Finally, the Rademacher functions may be replaced by other independent ran-
dom variables which leads some to use “randomized boundedness”. In any case, it is some
sort of unconditional boundedness.
R-boundedness clearly implies boundedness. But if X = Y, the notion of R-bounded-
ness is strictly stronger than boundedness unless the underlying space is a Hilbert space
[ArBu02], Proposition 1.17.
6.1.5. The operator-valued Marcinkiewicz theorem.
On an arbitrary Banach space, in
general it is a difﬁcult task to verify R-boundedness (we will come back to this point
later). Nevertheless, for multipliers it is the right notion as the following two results show.
First of all, we state that it is a necessary condition.
PROPOSITION ([ArBu02], [CP01]). Let (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(X) be an Lp
2π-multiplier for some
1 < p < ∞. Then the set {Mk: k ∈Z} is R-bounded.

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
53
If in Marcinkiewicz’s theorem we replace boundedness by R-boundedness, the theorem
remains true on UMD-spaces (see [ArBu02], Theorem 1.3).
THEOREM (The operator-valued Marcinkiewicz theorem). Let X be a UMD-space. Let
(Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(X) be R-bounded. Assume that

k(Mk+1 −Mk): k ∈Z

is R-bounded. Then (Mk)k∈Z is an Lp
2π-multiplier whenever 1 < p < ∞.
We remark that a set of scalar operators (i.e., operators of the form c · I, where c ∈C)
is bounded if and only if it is R-bounded. In that case, the Theorem had been proved by
Clément, de Pagter, Sukochev and Witvliet [CPSW00]. It was Weis [Wei00a] who proved
the ﬁrst operator-valued multiplier theorem on UMD-spaces, namely the operator-valued
version of Michlin’s theorem on the real line.
6.1.6. The variational Marcinkiewicz’ condition.
Finally we state the original, more gen-
eral version of Marcinkiewicz’s theorem. It holds in Hilbert spaces as was shown by
Schwartz [Schw61].
THEOREM. Let X be a Hilbert space and let (Mk)k∈Z ⊂L(X) be a bounded sequence
satisfying
sup
n∈N

2n−1⩽|k|<2n
∥Mk+1 −Mk∥< ∞.
(MV)
Then (Mk)k∈Z is an Lp
2π-multiplier for 1 < p < ∞.
We call (MV) the variational Marcinkiewicz condition. There is a version on UMD-spa-
ces due to Strkalj and Weis [SW00]. But the “R-version” of being of uniform bounded
variation on dyadic intervals is more complicated to formulate.
Finally we mention a remarkable difference between the variational Marcinkiewicz con-
dition and the stronger condition (M1) of Section 6.1.1. In the scalar case, if (M1) is sat-
isﬁed the associated operator is of weak type (1,1). This does not hold, if merely the more
general condition (MV ) is satisﬁed (see Fournier’s example [[EG77], Section 7.5]).
6.2. Maximal regularity via periodic multipliers
Let A be a closed operator and let τ > 0. For f ∈L1((0,τ);X) and x ∈X we consider
the problem
Px(f )
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t),
t ∈[0,τ],
u(0) = x.

54
W. Arendt
6.2.1. Mild and strong Lp-solutions.
Recall the notion of mild solution of Px(f )
given in Section 1.5. We now deﬁne a stronger notion of solution. Let 1 ⩽p < ∞.
By W 1,p((0,τ);X) we denote the space of all u ∈C([0,τ];X) such that there exists
u′ ∈Lp((0,τ);X) such that
u(t) = u(0) +
 t
0
u′(s)ds,
t ∈[0,τ].
(6.6)
Then u′(t) is the derivative of u a.e. Let f ∈Lp((0,τ);X). A strong Lp-solution u
of Px(f ) is a function u ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X) ∩Lp((0,τ);D(A)) such that u(0) = x and
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t) a.e. on (0,τ). Each strong solution is also a mild solution. Con-
versely, since A is closed, a mild solution u of Px(f ) is a strong Lp-solution if and only
if u ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X). Now assume that A is the generator of a C0-semigroup T . Then,
by Section 1.5, u = T (·)x + T ∗f is the unique mild solution of Px(f ). Thus, we are lead
to investigate under which conditions T (·)x ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X). We start to consider the
case f = 0.
6.2.2. An interpolation space and strong Lp-solutions of the homogeneous problem.
Let
X,Y be Banach spaces such that Y →X. For 1 < p < ∞one may deﬁne the real interpo-
lation space
(X,Y)1/p∗,p =

u(0): u ∈W 1,p
(0,τ);X
	
∩Lp
(0,τ);Y
	
,
where 1/p∗+ 1/p = 1. In particular, if A generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup T on X,
then

X,D(A)
	
1/p∗,p =

x ∈X: AT (·)x ∈Lp
(0,τ);X
	
.
(6.7)
Thus, the mild solution u = T (·)x of Px(0) is in W 1,p((0,τ);X)) if and only if
x ∈(D(X),A)1/p∗,p.
6.2.3. Strong solutions of periodic problems.
Let A be a closed operator on a Banach
space X. For f ∈Lp((0,2π);X), we consider the periodic problem
Pper(f )
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t),
t ∈[0,2π],
u(0) = u(2π).
A strong Lp-solution of Pper(f ) is a function u ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X) ∩Lp((0,τ);D(A))
such that (Pper) is satisﬁed t-a.e. We may identify Lp((0,2π);X) and Lp
2π(R,X). Then it
is not difﬁcult to see the following.
PROPOSITION. Let 1 < p < ∞. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) For each f ∈Lp((0,2π);X), there exists a unique strong Lp-solution of Pper(f );
(ii) iZ ⊂ρ(A) and (kR(ik,A))k∈Z is an Lp-multiplier.

Let us consider a Hilbert space H . Then we obtain the following theorem.
THEOREM. Let 1 < p < ∞. Let A be a closed operator on a Hilbert space H . The fol-
lowing are equivalent:
(i) iZ ⊂ρ(A) and supk∈Z ∥kR(ik,A)∥< ∞;
(ii) for all f ∈Lp, there exists a unique strong Lp-solution of Pper(f ).
For the implication (i) ⇒(ii) one considers Mk = kR(ik,A). The resolvent identity
implies that (k(Mk+1−Mk))k∈Z is bounded. Thus assertion (ii) follows from Section 6.1.1.
Similarly, one obtains from Section 6.1.5 the following characterization on UMD-spaces.
THEOREM [ArBu02]. Let A be a closed operator on a UMD-space X and let 1 < p < ∞.
The following are equivalent:
(i) iZ ⊂ρ(A) and {kR(ik,A): k ∈Z} is R-bounded;
(ii) for all f ∈Lp((0,2π);X), there exists a unique strong Lp-solution of (Pper).
Two things are remarkable:
1. Condition (ii), i.e., well-posedness of the periodic problem in the sense of strong
Lp-solutions, is p-independent for 1 < p < ∞.
2. Whereas no characterization of Lp-multipliers seems possible in general (if 1 <
p < ∞, p ̸= 2), in the context of resolvents, it is.
Finally, we remark that A satisﬁes the equivalent conditions of the theorem if and only
if −A does so. In particular, A need not be the generator of a C0-semigroup.
6.2.4. Maximal regularity on Hilbert space.
Let X be a Banach space. Assume that
A generates a holomorphic semigroup T . Then, for f ∈L1((0,τ);X), x ∈X,
u = T (·)x + T ∗f
is the unique mild solution of Px(f ). We want to investigate when the solution is strong.
If f ≡0, this is done in Section 6.2.2. Thus we may consider x = 0, i.e., we want to
investigate P0(f ).
THEOREM. Let A be the generator of a holomorphic C0-semigroup T on a Hilbert
space H . Then
T ∗f ∈W 1,p
(0,τ);X
	
for all f ∈Lp
(0,τ);X
	
,
1 < p < ∞.
(6.8)
PROOF. Let τ = 2π. Replacing A by A −ω we may assume that λ ∈ρ(A) when-
ever Reλ ⩾0 and ∥λR(λ,A)∥⩽M. Let f ∈Lp((0,τ);H). Then by the ﬁrst the-
orem of Section 6.2.3 there exists a unique strong Lp-solution v of Pper(f ). Then
v(0) ∈(H,D(A))1/p∗,p by Section 6.2.2. Let u(t) = v −T (t)v(0). Then u is a strong
Lp-solution of P0(f ).

W. Arendt
Property (6.8) is frequently called maximal regularity, or (MR) for short. Thus, on
Hilbert space, every generator of a holomorphic C0-semigroup does enjoy this prop-
erty (MR). It is also known that (MR) implies holomorphy of the semigroup (see Sec-
tion 6.2.6).
6.2.5. Characterization of Hilbert space.
For a long time it has been an open problem
whether the preceding theorem holds more generally on UMD-spaces. However, the an-
swer is negative.
THEOREM (Kalton and Lancien [KL00]). Let X be a Banach space possessing an uncon-
ditional basis. Let 1 < p < ∞. If X is not isomorphic to a Hilbert space, then there exist
a holomorphic C0-semigroup T and f ∈Lp((0,τ);X) such that T ∗f /∈W 1,p((0,τ);X).
The semigroup T is not constructed directly, the existence of such semigroup T is proved
implicitly using several deep results of geometry of Banach spaces. However one can say
that the generator A of T is a block-diagonal operator with respect to some conditional
basis in X.
It is an open problem whether the Theorem does also hold in Banach spaces with condi-
tional bases. Also, so far no explicit counterexample, and in particular, no model is known
for which (MR) fails.
6.2.6. Maximal regularity on UMD-spaces.
On UMD-spaces, with the same proof as in
Section 6.2.4 based on the periodic operator-valued multiplier theorem of Section 6.1.5
one obtains the following characterization.
THEOREM (Weis). Assume that X is a UMD-space. Let A be a closed operator, τ > 0,
1 < p < ∞. The following are equivalent:
(i) for all f ∈Lp((0,τ);X), there exists a unique u ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X) ∩Lp((0,τ);
D(A)) such that
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t)
a.e.,
u(0) = 0;
(ii) there exist ω ∈R such that λ ∈ρ(A) whenever Reλ > ω and the set {λR(λ,A):
Reλ > ω} is R-bounded.
It was Weis [Wei00a] who proved that (ii) implies (i), Clément and Prüss [CP01] showed
necessity of the condition. Weis gave a different proof (than we indicated here), based on
his operator-valued Michlin’s theorem on the real line.
DEFINITION. We say that an operator A satisﬁes condition (MR) (for maximal regularity)
if condition (i) is satisﬁed.
It can be seen from the Theorem that property (MR) is independent of p ∈(1,∞) and
of τ > 0. Moreover, (MR) implies that A generates a holomorphic semigroup T . Thus, the

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
57
solution u of (i) is given by u = T ∗f . If A satisﬁes (MR) then the existence of strong
Lp-solutions on the entire half-line (0,∞) is merely a question of the asymptotic behavior
of T as the following result shows. See Section 1.3 for the deﬁnition of ω(T ).
THEOREM. Let A be the generator of a holomorphic C0-semigroup T on a Banach
space X. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) A satisﬁes (MR) and ω(T ) < 0;
(ii) T ∗f ∈W 1,p((0,∞),X) ∩Lp((0,∞);D(A)) for all f ∈Lp((0,∞);X).
PROOF. (ii) ⇒(i) follows from Datko’s theorem [[ABHN01], p. 336]. For (ii) ⇒(i),
see [Dor00], Theorem 5.2.
□
Finally, we mention that the restriction to p ∈(1,∞) is essential. If A generates
a C0-semigroup T on a reﬂexive space X such that T ∗f ∈W 1,1((0,1);X) for all
f ∈L1((0,1);X), then A is bounded (see [Gue95]).
6.2.7. Perturbation of (MR).
In general it is not at all easy to prove R-boundedness.
However, it is not difﬁcult to see that condition (ii) of the preceding theorem is stable
under small perturbation (see [KuWe01], [ArBu02]).
THEOREM. Let A be an operator satisfying (MR) on a UMD-space X. Then there exists
ε > 0 such that, for each linear B :D(A) →X,
∥Bx∥⩽ε∥Ax∥+ b∥x∥,
x ∈D(A),
for some b ⩾0, also A + B satisﬁes (MR).
6.2.8. BIP and maximal regularity.
An important criterion for maximal regularity is
property BIP. The following theorem is due to Dore and Venni [DoVe87].
THEOREM. Let A ∈BIP on a UMD-space X such that ϕbip(A) < π/2. Then −A has
property (MR).
We sketch two different proofs.
FIRST PROOF. One can show directly that BIP implies that for ϕbip < ϕ < π/2 one has
σ(A) ⊂Σϕ and that the set {λR(λ,A): λ ∈C\Σϕ} is R-bounded, [DHP01], Theorem 4.5.
Thus the ﬁrst theorem of Section 6.2.6 can be applied.
□
SECOND PROOF [DOVE87]. The space Y = Lp((0,τ);X) has the UMD-property and
the operator A on Lp((0,τ);X) given by (Au)(t) = Au(t) with domain D(A) =
Lp((0,τ);D(A)) obviously inherits BIP from A with angle ϕbip(A) ⩽ϕbip(A). On the
other hand, the operator B on Lp((0,τ);X) given by D(B) = W 1,p
0
((0,τ);X),Bu = u′,
has BIP with angle ϕbip(B) = π/2 (see [HP97] or [DoVe87]). Assuming that 0 ∈ρ(A), it
follows from the Dore–Venni theorem (Section 4.4.8) that A + B is closed. The Theorem
of Section 4.2 shows that A + B is invertible. This is exactly property (MR).

6.2.9. Maximal regularity for positive contraction semigroups on Lp(Ω).
The character-
ization of maximal regularity by R-sectoriality 6.2.11 (and Section 4.7.5) has the following
interesting consequence [Wei00b].
THEOREM (Lamberton and Weis). Let 1 < p < ∞. Let −A be the generator of a positive
contractive C0-semigroup T on Lp(Ω). If T is holomorphic, then A has (MR).
This result had been ﬁrst proved by Lamberton [Lam87] in the case where T is also
contractive for the L∞- and L1-norm.
6.2.10. Maximal regularity and quasi-linear problems.
The property of maximal regu-
larity is most important in order to solve quasi-linear problems. Here we give a result on
local existence.
Let X be a UMD-space and let D be a Banach space such that D →d X. Let 1 < p < ∞
and Y = (X,D)1/p∗,p, where 1/p + 1/p∗= 1. Let A:Y →L(D,X) be Lipschitz contin-
uous on each bounded subset of Y. Let u0 ∈Y and assume that the operator −A(u0) on X
with domain D(A(u0)) = D has property (MR). Then the following result holds.
THEOREM (Clément and Li [CL94]). For each f ∈Lp
loc((0,∞);X), there exist τ > 0 and
a solution u ∈W 1,p((0,τ);X) ∩Lp((0,τ);D) of
u′(t) + A

u(t)
	
u(t) = f (t),
t ∈(0,τ),
u(0) = u0.
(P )
Observe that W 1,p((0,τ);X) ∩Lp((0,τ);D) ⊂C([0,τ];Y) so that the condition on
the initial value of u makes sense.
SKETCH OF THE PROOF OF THE THEOREM. We show how maximal regularity is used to
give a ﬁxed point argument. Rewrite the problem as
u′(t) + A(u0)u(t) = f (t) +

A(u0) −A(u)
	
u.
Let MR(τ) := Lp((0,τ);D) ∩W 1,p((0,τ);X). Then S1v = f + (A(u0) −A(v))v deﬁnes
a mapping S1 :MR(τ) →Lp((0,τ);X). Consider S2 :Lp((0,τ);X) →MR(τ) deﬁned by
S2g = u, where u ∈MR(τ) is the solution of ˙u+A(u0)u = g, u(0) = u0. Then S = S2 ◦S1
is a mapping from MR(τ) into MR(τ). One can show that S is a strict contraction if τ > 0
is small enough. Thus the Banach ﬁxed point theorem shows that S has a ﬁxed point which
is a solution of (P).

6.2.11. R-sectorial operators.
As we mentioned before, on Hilbert space (and only
on Hilbert space), boundedness and R-boundedness are the same. On the other hand,
it turns out that many results known for Hilbert spaces can be carried over to Lp-spaces,
1 < p < ∞, if boundedness is replaced by R-boundedness. The operator-valued
Marcinkiewicz of Section 6.1.5 and the Michlin multiplier theorem [Wei00a] are of this
kind. We mention some further results. We say that an operator A is R-sectorial if there

59
exists 0 < ϕ < π such that σ(A) ⊂Σϕ and such that the set {λR(λ,A): λ ∈C \ Σϕ} is
R-bounded. In that case let ϕR sec(A) be the inﬁmum of all angles with these properties.
On a UMD-space an operator A has property (MR) if and only if A + ω is R-sectorial
for some ω ∈R.
In analogy to Section 5.1 one has the following results. Assume that X = Lp(Ω),
1 < p < ∞.
If A has a bounded H ∞-calculus, then A is R-sectorial and ϕH ∞(A) = ϕR sec(A).
Moreover, if B is a second R-sectorial operator commuting with A such that ϕH ∞(A) +
ϕR sec(B) < π, then A + B is closed.
For this and many other interesting properties we refer to [Wei00a], [Wei00b]
and [KW01].
7. Gaussian estimates and ultracontractivity
Frequently it is easy to deﬁne a semigroup on L2(Ω) with the help of form methods for ex-
ample. In this section we discuss under which conditions such a semigroup can be extended
to Lp(Ω). An important item is to investigate whether semigroup properties (as holo-
morphy, maximal regularity, H ∞-calculus) extrapolate to Lp. Integral representations by
Gaussian kernels play a big role.
7.1. The Beurling–Deny criteria
For simplicity we consider real spaces in this section. Let H be a real Hilbert space. Let
V →d H be another Hilbert space and a :V × V →R a continuous bilinear form which is
H -elliptic, i.e.,
a(u,u) + ω∥u∥2
H ⩾α∥u∥2
V ,
u ∈V,
for some ω ∈R, α > 0. Recall that this is the same as saying that a is a closed form with
form domain D(a) = V . Denote by A the operator associated with a (see Section 5.3.1).
Then −A generates a C0-semigroup T on H which has a holomorphic extension to HC,
the complexiﬁcation of H . In the following we assume that H = L2(Ω) for some measure
space (Ω,Σ,μ) so that HC = L2(Ω,C). We let V+ = V ∩L2(Ω)+.
7.1.1. Theorem (First Beurling–Deny criterion).
The semigroup T is positive if and only
if u ∈V implies u+ ∈V and
a

u+,u−	
⩾0.

60
W. Arendt
Here, for u ∈L2(Ω), we let u+(x) = max{u(x),0}, u−= (−u)+. The next condition
characterizes L∞-contractivity. An operator S on L2(Ω) is called submarkovian if S ⩾0
and ∥Sf ∥∞⩽∥f ∥∞for all f ∈L2(Ω) ∩L∞(Ω). A semigroup T on L2(Ω) is called
submarkovian if each T (t) is submarkovian.
7.1.2. Theorem (Second Beurling–Deny criterion).
Assume that the semigroup T is pos-
itive. Then T is submarkovian if and only if u ∧1 ∈V for each u ∈V+ and
a

u ∧1,(u −1)+	
⩾0.
Here we denote by 1 the function identically equal to 1. Note that u ∧1 + (u −1)+ = u.
We refer to [Ouh92], [[Ouh04]] for a proof of these criteria. Note that T ∗is associated with
a∗:V × V →R given by a∗(u,v) = a(v,u). If T and T ∗are submarkovian, then
T (t)f

Lp ⩽∥f ∥Lp
(7.1)
for all f ∈Lp(Ω) ∩L2(Ω), t ⩾0 and p = 1,∞at ﬁrst; but by interpolation also for all
p ∈(1,∞). The form a is called a Dirichlet form if the two criteria of Beurling–Deny are
satisﬁed. If in addition the form a is symmetric (i.e., a = a∗), then the semigroup T consists
of self-adjoint operators satisfying (7.1). Each C0-semigroup of symmetric submarkov-
ian operators is associated with a symmetric Dirichlet form. The monographs [[FOT94]],
[[MR86]], [[BH91]] are devoted to the theory of Dirichlet forms and their important and
interesting interplay with stochastic processes. Here we are merely interested in analyti-
cal properties.
7.1.3. Domination [Ouh96].
Let a and b be two closed forms on L2(Ω) with associ-
ated semigroups S and T , respectively. Assume that S and T are positive. The following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) S(t) ⩽T (t), t ⩾0;
(ii) (a) D(a) ⊂D(b) and for u ∈D(b), if 0 ⩽u ⩽v ∈D(a), then u ∈D(a) (ideal
property), and
(b) a(u,v) ⩽b(u,v) for all 0 ⩽u, v ∈D(a) (monotonicity).
We mention two prototype examples.
7.1.4. Examples.
Let Ω ⊂Rn be an arbitrary open set. The Dirichlet Laplacian D
Ω
and the Neumann Laplacian N
Ω generate symmetric submarkovian semigroups satisfy-
ing 0 ⩽etD
Ω ⩽etN
Ω , t ⩾0.
7.2. Extrapolating semigroups
Now we consider complex spaces. Let (Ω,Σ,μ) be a measure space and T a C0-semi-
group on L2(Ω). We assume throughout this section that
T (t)
L(Lp) ⩽M,
0 < t ⩽1,
(7.2)

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
61
for p = 1,∞and hence for all p ∈[1,∞] by interpolation. Here, given an operator
S ∈L(L2(Ω)) and 1 ⩽p, q ⩽∞, we let
∥S∥L(Lp,Lq) = sup

∥Sf ∥Lq: f ∈Lp ∩L2,∥f ∥Lp ⩽1

.
(7.3)
Note that T and T ∗are submarkovian if and only if M = 1. It follows from (7.2) that for
suitable constants M1, ω1,
T (t)
L(Lp) ⩽M1eω1t,
t ⩾0,
(7.4)
for all p ∈[1,∞]. From this we deduce that, for 1 ⩽p < ∞, there exist bounded operators
Tp(t) ∈L(Lp(Ω)) which are consistent, i.e.,
Tp(t)f = Tq(t)f,
f ∈Lp ∩Lq,t > 0,
(7.5)
and such that T2(t) = T (t), t > 0. It is clear that Tp(t + s) = Tp(t)Tp(s) for t, s ⩾0,
1 ⩽p < ∞. If 1 < p < 2, we deduce from the interpolation inequality
Tp(t)f −f

Lp ⩽
T1(t)f −f
θ
L1
T2(t)f −f
1−θ
L2 ,
where 1
p = θ
1 + 1−θ
2 , so that limt↓0 Tp(t)f = f in Lp for f ∈L2 ∩L1. Thus Tp is
a C0-semigroup for 1 < p ⩽2, and also for 2 < p < ∞by a similar argument. It is
clear that T1 :(0,∞) →L(L1(Ω)) is strongly measurable, and hence strongly continu-
ous [[Dav80], p. 18]. However, it seems to be unknown whether T1 is a C0-semigroup, in
general. It is if one of the following conditions is satisﬁed.
7.2.1. Conditions for T1 being a C0-semigroup.
Assume that one of the following condi-
tions is satisﬁed:
(a) M = 1;
(b) Ω has ﬁnite measure;
(c) T (t) ⩾0, t > 0;
(d) there exist an open set Ω′ ⊃Ω and a C0-semigroup S on L1(Ω′) such that
T (t)f
 ⩽S(t)|f |
on Ω for all f ∈L1(Ω).
(7.6)
Then T1 is a C0-semigroup.
See [Voi92] for the cases (a)–(c) and [AtE97] for (d).
We assume throughout that one of the four conditions (a)–(d) is satisﬁed. Then T1 is
a C0-semigroup. Observe that also T ∗satisﬁes (7.2) and one of these conditions. This
allows us to deﬁne the extension of T to L∞(Ω). In fact, (T ∗)1 is a C0-semigroup. Now
deﬁne T∞(t) = (T ∗)1(t)∗. Then T∞is a weak*-continuous semigroup whose generator
we deﬁne by A∞= (A∗
1)∗. The consistency property (7.5) remains valid for p = 1 and
1 ⩽q ⩽∞. If Ω has ﬁnite measure, then of course, T∞(t) = T (t)|L∞(Ω).

W. Arendt
We call Tp the extrapolation semigroup of T on Lp, 1 ⩽p ⩽∞.
Now we want to investigate how properties of the semigroup T = T2 are inherited by the
extrapolation semigroups Tp. We denote by Ap the generator of Tp. Note that A∞= (A∗
1)∗.

7.2.3. Proofs and comments.
We comment on the diverse properties. The ﬁrst three
(a)–(c) concern regularity of the semigroup.
(a) Let 1 < p < 2, 1
p = θ
1 + 1−θ
2 . Then by the Riesz–Thorin theorem ∥Tp(t) −I∥⩽
∥T1(t) −I∥θ∥T2(t) −I∥1−θ →0 as t ↓0. This implies that Ap is bounded.
(b) This is a consequence of Stein’s interpolation theorem (cf. [[Dav90], Theo-
rem 1.4.2]). But a similar proof as for (a) can be given for contraction semigroups
using the following result (see [[Paz83], p. 68]).
THEOREM (Kato–Neuberger–Pazy). Let 1 < p < ∞and let T be a C0-semigroup
on Lp(Ω) such that ∥T (t)∥⩽1, t ⩾0. Then T is holomorphic if and only if
limt↓0∥T (t) −I∥< 2.
Now the argument of (a) also gives a proof of (b).
(c) The argument of (a) also gives a proof of (c).
(d) This is [[Dav90], Theorem 1.6.1 and Corollary 1.6.2]. Properties (f ) and (g) are
trivial. Here a semigroup is called positive, if it leaves the real space invariant and
its restriction to the real space is positive.
(i) Example 4.5.3 provides a counterexample where the semigroups extrapolate to
Lp merely for 1 < p < ∞, the operator A2 has H ∞-calculus, but Ap has not
H ∞-calculus for p ̸= 2. We do not know such an example where the semigroups
extrapolate to Lp for 1 ⩽p ⩽∞.
Next we give some interesting examples showing, in particular, that the positive results
in (b), (c) or (d) cannot be extended to p = 1.

7.2.4. The harmonic oscillator [[Dav90], Section 4.3].
Consider the operator given by
Apu = 1
2

−u′′ + x2u −u
	
on Lp(R,e−x2 dx) with maximal domain. Then Ap generates a C0-semigroup Tp on
Lp(R,e−x2 dx), 1 ⩽p < ∞. This family is consistent. Moreover, Tp is holomorphic
for 1 < p < ∞, but T1 is not norm continuous on [t0,∞) for any t0 > 0. Ap has
a compact resolvent for 1 < p < ∞. One has σ(Ap) = N0 for 1 < p < ∞but
σ(A1) = {λ ∈C: Reλ ⩾0}. Thus A1 has not a compact resolvent.
7.2.5. Black–Scholes equation.
For 1 ⩽p < ∞, let the operator Bp on Lp(0,∞) be
given by
(Bp)(x) = x2u′′(x) + 2xu′(x),
D(Bp) =

u ∈Lp(0,∞): xu′ ∈Lp(0,∞),x2u′′ ∈Lp(0,∞)

.
Then B2 is associated with the symmetric Dirichlet form a given by
a(u,v) =
 ∞
0
u′v′x2 dx,
D(a) = u ∈L2(0,∞): xu′ ∈L2(0,∞)
and thus generates a symmetric Markovian semigroup T2. The extrapolation semigroup Tp
has Bp as generator. The spectrum of Bp is the parabola σ(Bp) = {(1/p −1/2 + is)2 −
1/4: s ∈R}, 1 ⩽p < ∞. In particular,
σ(Bp) ∩σ(Bq) = ∅
if 1 ⩽p < q ⩽2.
Note that Tp governs the Black–Scholes partial differential equation
ut = x2uxx + 2xux.
Reference: [Are94], Section 3, Example 3.
7.2.6. Symmetric submarkovian semigroups, optimal angles and the Neumann Laplacian
on horn domains.
Let A2 be the generator of a symmetric submarkovian semigroup T2
on L2(Ω) and denote by Tp the C0-semigroup on Lp(Ω) with generator Ap extrapolat-
ing T2, 1 ⩽p < ∞. Then Liskevich and Perelmuter [LP95] showed that the angle ob-
tained by the Stein interpolation theorem can be improved. In fact, Tp has a holomorphic,
contractive extension to the sector Σθp, where 0 ⩽θp < π
2 such that cosθp = |1 −2/p|.
In particular, the spectrum of Ap is contained in the sector
Sp :=

reiθ: r ⩾0, π
2 + θp ⩽|θ| ⩽2π

,
1 ⩽p ⩽∞.

W. Arendt
It was Voigt [Voi96] who ﬁrst showed that this sector is optimal. In fact, modifying Ex-
ample 7.2.5 he constructed a degenerate elliptic operator Ap on Lp(0,∞)2 such that the
spectrum of Ap is equal to Sp.
Another interesting example in this context is the symmetric Ornstein–Uhlenbeck op-
erator Ap on Lp(Rn,μ), where μ is the invariant measure. It generates a symmetric sub-
markovian semigroup Tp on Lp(Rn,μ). Metafune, Pallara and Priola [MPP02] computed
explicitly the spectrum and showed that it is independent of p ∈[1,∞). In particular,
the spectrum of Ap is real for all p ∈[1,∞). However, Chill, Fašangová, Metafune and
Pallara [CFMP03] showed that Σθp is the sector of holomorphy of Tp, i.e., the worst case
is realized for the symmetric Ornstein–Uhlenstein semigroup.
Kunstmann [Kun02] constructed an open unbounded domain Ω in Rn (which is com-
posed by inﬁnitely many “horn domains”) such that the Neumann Laplacian has bad in-
terpolation properties. In particular, for a domain Ω composed by inﬁnitely many horn
domains the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian N
Ω,p in Lp(Ω) depends on p. Moreover,
the semigroup (etN
Ω,1)t⩾0 is not holomorphic in L1(Ω). In fact, it is not even eventually
norm continuous since the spectrum of N
Ω,1 is the left-half plane.
Concerning the functional calculus, one can say the following: given a symmetric sub-
markovian semigroup T2 with extension semigroups Tp on Lp(Ω), by Section 4.7.5 the
negative generator Ap of Tp has a bounded H ∞-calculus and
ϕR sec(Ap) = ϕH ∞(Ap),
1 < p < ∞.
Cowling [Cow83] showed that ϕH ∞(Ap) ⩽ϕs(Ap), where ϕs(Ap) = π/2 −π|1/2 −1/p|
is the angle obtained by the Stein interpolation theorem. However Kunstmann and Strkalj
[KS03] showed that ϕH ∞(Ap) < ϕs(Ap) for 1 < p < ∞, p ̸= 2. Still, it seems to be open
whether always ϕH ∞(Ap) = θp.
7.3. Ultracontractivity, kernels and Sobolev embedding
In this section we consider a semigroup T on L2(Ω) which is regularizing in the Lp-sense:
We will ask that T (t)L2(Ω) ⊂Lq(Ω) for some q > 2. This property implies in particular
that T (t) is an integral operator. Throughout this section (Ω,Σ,μ) is a measure space.
7.3.1. The Dunford–Pettis criterion.
Let K ∈L∞(Ω × Ω). Then
(SKf )(x) =

Ω
K(x,y)f (y)dy
(7.7)
deﬁnes a bounded operator SK ∈L(L1(Ω),L∞(Ω)).
THEOREM (see, e.g., [AB94]). The mapping K →SK is an isometric isomorphism from
L∞(Ω × Ω) onto L(L1(Ω),L∞(Ω)). Moreover, K(x,y) ⩾0 a.e. if and only if SK ⩾0.

7.3.2. Ultracontractive semigroups.
Let T be a C0-semigroup on L2(Ω). We assume
that (7.2) is satisﬁed and denote by Tp the extrapolation semigroup of T on Lp(Ω). Thus
Tp is a C0-semigroup for 1 < p < ∞, we suppose that this be true also for p = 1 (cf.
Section 7.2.1). Denote by Ap the generator of Tp. It follows from (7.2) that
Tp(t)
 ⩽M1eωt,
t ⩾0,
(7.8)
for some M1 ⩾1, ω ∈R and all p ∈[1,∞]. Thus (ω −Ap) is sectorial for all 1 ⩽p < ∞
by Section 4.1.3 and the fractional powers (ω −Ap)α are deﬁned for all α ⩾0. Note that
D

(ω −Ap)α	
= D

(ω1 −Ap)α	
= (ω1 −Ap)−αLp(Ω)
for all ω1 > ω.
THEOREM. Let n > 0 be a real number. Consider the following conditions.
(i) There exist c > 0, 1 ⩽p < q ⩽∞such that
T (t)
L(Lp,Lq) ⩽ct−n
2 | 1
p −1
q |
for all 0 < t ⩽1.
(ii) There exists a constant c > 0 such that for all 1 ⩽p < q ⩽∞,
T (t)
L(Lp,Lq) ⩽ct−n
2 | 1
p −1
q |,
0 < t ⩽1.
(iii) There exist 1 < p < ∞and 0 < α < n
2p such that D((ω −Ap)α) ⊂Lq, where q is
deﬁned by α = n
2( 1
p −1
q ).
(iv) For all 0 < α < n
2p and all 1 < p < ∞one has D((ω −Ap)α) ⊂Lq, where q is
deﬁned by α = n
2( 1
p −1
q ).
Then (i) ⇔(ii) ⇒(iv) ⇒(iii). If T is holomorphic then all four assertions are equivalent.
If the generator A of T is associated with a closed form with form domain V →L2(Ω)
such that V ∩L1(Ω) is dense in L1(Ω) and if n > 2, then these four conditions are also
equivalent to
(v) V →L2n/(n−2)(Ω).
We call a semigroup ultracontractive if the equivalent conditions (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed.
The number dim(T ) = inf{n > 0: (i) is valid} is called the semigroup dimension. Note
that n is not entire, in general. It was Varopoulos who startet a systematic investigation
of the dimension of a semigroup, mainly in the framework of symmetric submarkovian
semigroups. We refer to [[VSC93]], [[Sal02]], [[Dav90]] for the historical references and
further results.

The Riesz–Thorin theorem allows one to go from (ii)′ to (ii). The following trick due to
Coulhon [Cou90] allows one to show that (i) implies (ii)′. It is done in two steps. We as-
sume (i).
(a) We show that ∥T (t)∥L(L1,Lq) ⩽const · t−n
2 (1−1
q ), 0 ⩽t ⩽1. Let α = n
2( 1
p −1
q ),
β = n
2(1 −1
q ). Choose 0 < θ < 1 such that 1
p = θ
1 + 1−θ
q . Then 1
p −1
q = θ(1 −1
q ),
i.e., α = θβ. By the hypothesis (i), ∥T (t)∥L(Lp,Lq) ⩽const · t−α and we want to
show that
T (t)
L(L1,Lq) ⩽const · t−β.
Let
f ∈L1 ∩L∞,
∥f ∥L1 ⩽1,
cf := sup



Then

Hence,
cf = suptβ∥T (t)f ∥Lq ⩽const · (cf )1−θ. Thus cf ⩽const1/θ, where
const does not depend of f . This proves the claim.
(b) It follows from (a) by duality that
T (t)
L(Lq′,L∞) ≤const · t−n

Applying (a) to this gives (ii)′.
(i) ⇒(iv). The proof of [[Dav90], Theorem 2.4.2] based on the Marcinkiewicz interpo-
lation theorem carries over to this case.
(iii) ⇒(i). Assume that T is holomorphic. Replacing A by A −ω we can assume that
T is exponentially stable. Let q =

Since α = n

Now assume that A is associated with a closed form.

is as in the previous implication for p = 2.
(i) ⇒(v). As we know from Section 5.5.1 it may happen that V ̸= D(A1/2). Thus we
cannot use the previous implication (i) ⇒(iv). However, for forms, ultracontractivity can

by the proof of [[Dav90], Theorem 2.4.6]. Thus, assuming (i), Nash’s inequality holds.
Consider the symmetric form b(u,v) = 1
2(a(u,v) + a(v,u)) with domain V . Denote
by B the operator associated with b and by S the semigroup generated by −B. It fol-
lows from the characterization via Nash’s inequality we just mentioned that S satisﬁes (i).
Hence, D(B1/2) ⊂L2n/n−2 by the implication (i) ⇒(iv). But V = D(B1/2) since B is
self-adjoint.
□
Now we show some further properties of ultracontractive semigroups and give examples.
7.3.3. Kernels and compactness.
Assume that T is an ultracontractive semigroup
on L2(Ω). Then
T (t)
L(L1,L∞) ⩽M2t−n/2eω2t
for all t > 0
(7.9)
and for some M2 ⩾1, ω2 ∈R. Thus, by the Dunford–Pettis criterion there exists a kernel
Kt ∈L∞(Ω × Ω) such that

Tp(t)f
	
(x) =

Ω
Kt(x,y)f (y)dy,
x-a.e.
(7.10)
for all f ∈Lp(Ω) ∩L1(Ω). Moreover,
Kt(x,y)
 ⩽M2eω2t · t−n/2,
t > 0.
(7.11)
Now assume that Ω has ﬁnite measure. Then T (t) is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator and hence
compact. This property extends to the entire Lp scale, 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, in virtue of ultracon-
tractivity. In fact, given t > 0, 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, we can factorize Tp(t) as follows:
Lp Tp(t/3)
−→L∞→L2 T2(t/3)
−→L2 T2(t/3)
−→L∞→Lp.
Thus Tp(t) is compact. We have shown the following.

68
W. Arendt
PROPOSITION. Let T be an ultracontractive semigroup on L2(Ω) with extrapolating
semigroups Tp, 1 ⩽p ⩽∞. If Ω has ﬁnite measure, then Tp(t) is a compact operator
on Lp(Ω) for all t > 0, 1 ⩽p ⩽∞.
7.3.4. The Gaussian semigroup and Sobolev embedding.
As an illustrating example
we consider the Gaussian semigroup Gp on Lp(Rn) given by the kernel
KG
t (x,y) = (4πt)−n/2e−|x−y|2/4t.
(7.12)
Thus (i) is satisﬁed for p = 1,q = ∞, and in this case the semigroup dimension n is the
dimension of the space Rn. Denote the generator of Gp by p. Then D(p) = W 2,p(Rn),
1 < p < ∞.
PROOF. The operator Gp(t) is a Fourier multiplier with symbol e−ξ2t. Thus R(1,p) has
symbol (1 + ξ2)−1. Since for
f ∈ϕ

Rn	′,
F(Djf ) = iξjFf,
we have to show that ξiξj(1 + ξ2)−1 is an Lp-Fourier multiplier (in order to deduce that
D(p) = R(1,p)Lp(Rn) ⊂W 2,p(Rn)). This follows from Michlin’s theorem.
□
Similarly, one sees with the help of Michlin’s theorem that
Dm
p
	 = W 2m,pRn	,
1 < p < ∞,m ∈N.
Thus, the conclusion (iv) of the Theorem in Section 7.3.2 is the usual Sobolev embedding
theorem. We remark that such results are of particular interest if they are applied to the
Laplace–Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold (see [[VSC93]]).
7.3.5. The Dirichlet Laplacian.
Let Ω ⊂Rn be an arbitrary open set and consider the
Dirichlet Laplacian D
Ω on L2(Ω). Then (etD
Ω) is self-adjoint, submarkovian and ultra-
contractive since the form domain W 1,2
0
(Ω) is in Lq, where q =
2n
n−2 if n > 2 and ar-
bitrary q < ∞if n ⩽2. Denote by D
Ω,p the generator of the extrapolation semigroup,
1 ⩽p ⩽∞. Then we deduce from the Theorem in Section 7.3.2 that
D

−D
Ω,p
	α	
⊂Lnp/(n−2αp)
(7.13)
whenever 0 < α <
n
2p. On the other hand, if Ω is irregular, then it can happen that
D(D
Ω,p) ̸⊂W 1,p(Ω) for p > 2, see [[Gri92]]. Thus Sobolev embedding results cannot
be used here to prove (7.13).
7.3.6. The extension property.
An open set Ω ⊂Rn has the extension property if the re-
striction mapping R :W 1,2(Rn) →W 1,2(Ω) is surjective. Then R0 :(kerR)⊥→W 1,2(Ω)
is an isomorphism and E := R−1
0
is a bounded operator from W 1,2(Ω) into W 1,2(Rn) such

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
69
that (Eu)|Ω = u for all u ∈W 1,2(Ω). We call E an extension operator. If Ω is bounded
and has Lipschitz boundary, then Ω has the extension property. If Ω has the extension
property then
W 1,2(Ω) ⊂Lq(Ω)
(7.14)
for q =
2n
n−2 if n > 2 and for all q < ∞if n ⩽2. This follows from the case Ω = Rn.
Property (7.14) implies ultracontractivity in many interesting examples. Here we consider
the Neumann Laplacian as prototype:
7.3.7. The Neumann Laplacian.
Let Ω ⊂RN be open. The Neumann Laplacian N
Ω
generates a symmetric submarkovian semigroup on L2(Ω). If Ω has the extension prop-
erty then (etN
Ω)t⩾0 is ultracontractive. However, this is not true without this hypothesis.
For example, in dimension 1, we may consider Ω = (0,1) \ {1/n:n ∈N}. Then 0 is an
eigenvalue of inﬁnite multiplicity of N
Ω, hence, the resolvent is not compact. In particu-
lar, the semigroup is not ultracontractive.
7.3.8. Asymptotic behavior of Tp(t) as t →∞.
Let T be an ultracontractive, positive,
irreducible C0-semigroup on L2(Ω,μ), where Ω has ﬁnite measure. Then there exist
u,ϕ ∈L∞(Ω) such that u(x) > 0, ϕ(x) > 0 a.e.,

Ω u(x)ϕ(x)dμ = 1 and ω ∈R, ε > 0,
M ⩾0 such that
e−ωtTp(t) −P
L(Lp(Ω)) ⩽Me−εt,
t ⩾0,
for 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, where Pf = 
Ω f (x)ϕ(x)dμ(x) · u, f ∈L1(Ω).
PROOF. By Section 7.3.3 the operators Tp(t) are compact for 1 ⩽p ⩽∞, t > 0. It follows
that Ap has compact resolvent. Thus σ(Ap) is independent of p ∈[1,∞] (see [[Dav90],
p. 36]). In particular, ω := s(Ap) is independent of p ∈[1,∞]. Now the claim follows
from Section 3.5.1 for 1 ⩽p < ∞. For p = ∞one may use a duality argument.
□
A particular example is T (t) = etn
Ω where Ω is a connected, bounded open set in Rn
with Lipschitz boundary. In this case Pf =
1
|Ω|

Ω f dx · 1Ω for all f ∈Lp(Ω).
7.4. Gaussian estimates
Let Ω ⊂Rn be an open set and let T be a C0-semigroup on L2(Ω) (the L2-space of
complex-valued functions). We identify L2(Ω) with a subspace of L2(Rn) extending func-
tions on Ω by 0 on RN \ Ω. Consider the Gaussian semigroup G on L2(Rn).
DEFINITION. The semigroup T admits a Gaussian estimate if there exist constants c > 0,
b > 0 such that
T (t)f
 ⩽cG(bt)|f |,
0 < t ⩽1,
(7.15)

70
W. Arendt
for all f ∈L2(Ω).
Note that (7.15) is an inequality between measurable functions in the almost everywhere
sense. It is not difﬁcult to show that it implies an estimate of the form
T (t)f
 ⩽MeωtG(bt)|f |
(7.16)
for all t > 0, f ∈L2(Ω). By the Dunford–Pettis criterion this is equivalent to saying that
T (t) = SKt , where Kt ∈L∞(Ω × Ω), is a kernel satisfying
Kt(x,y)
 ⩽const · eωtt−n/2e−|x−y|2/4bt,
(x,y)-a.e.
(7.17)
for all t > 0. If T admits a Gaussian estimate then by Section 7.2 (and in particular, Sec-
tion 7.2.1(d)) there exist consistent extrapolation semigroups Tp on Lp(Ω), 1 ⩽p ⩽∞,
such that T2 = T . For 1 ⩽p < ∞, Tp is a C0-semigroup, T∞is w∗-continuous. By Ap we
denote the generator of Tp. These notations will be used in the following without further
notice. Our aim is to establish consequences of Gaussian estimates for Tp which allow us
in particular to replace some of the negative answers in the heritage list of Section 7.2.2 by
positive assertions. Later we will see that a large class of elliptic operators generate semi-
groups which satisfy Gaussian estimates. But before that we give two prototype examples.
7.4.1. Examples.
(a) Let Ω ⊂Rn be an arbitrary open set. The semigroup generated by
the Dirichlet Laplacian D
Ω on L2(Ω) satisﬁes
etD
Ωf
 ⩽G(t)|f |,
t > 0,
(7.18)
for all f ∈L2(Ω).
(b) Assume that Ω has the extension property. Then the semigroup (etN
Ω)t⩾0 gener-
ated by the Neumann N
Ω Laplacian admits a Gaussian estimate.
PROOF. (a) Let 0 ⩽f ∈L2(Rn). It sufﬁces to show that u := R(λ,D
Ω)f ⩽R(λ,
)f =: v on Ω. By the deﬁnition via forms we have
λ

uϕ +

(Ω),
λ

Rn vϕ +

Rn f ϕ,ϕ ∈W 1,2
Rn	
.
Hence, λ

Ω(u −v)ϕ +

Rn ∇(u −v)∇ϕ = 0 for all ϕ ∈W 1,2
0
(Ω). Taking ϕ = (u −v)+
one obtains that (u −v)+ = 0.
(b) In this generality, this is due to Ouhabaz [Ouh03]. For a stronger version of the
extension property the result is proved in [[Dav90], p. 90].

7.4.2. Remark (Proper domination).
There is a signiﬁcant difference between the two
examples: For the Dirichlet Laplacian we have proper domination; i.e., the constant c
in (7.15) is equal to 1. But this is the only realization of the Laplacian with this property:
Let Ω ⊂Rn be open. We assume that Ω is stable (see Section 5.4.5). Let S be a positive,
symmetric C0-semigroup on L2(Ω) such that S(t) ⩽G2(t), 0 < t ⩽1. Assume that the
generator A of S satisﬁes D(Ω) ⊂D(A) and Au = u for all u ∈D(Ω). Then A = D
Ω.
PROOF. (a) We consider L2(Ω) as a subspace of L2(Rn), extending functions by 0. Then
S(t) = (1ΩS(t/n))n ⩽(1ΩG2(t/n))n for all n ∈N. Since limn→∞(1ΩG(t/n))n = etD
Ω
strongly by Section 5.4.5, we conclude that S(t) ⩽etD
Ω, 0 < t < ∞.
(b) Denote by a :V × V →R the symmetric closed form associated with −A. It fol-
lows from (a) and Section 7.1.3 that V ⊂H 1
0 (Ω). For u, v ∈D(Ω), we have a(u,v) =
−(Au|v)L2 =

∇u∇v dx. Note that ∥u∥2
L2 + a(u,u) deﬁnes an equivalent norm on V .
Thus ∥· ∥V and ∥· ∥H 1 are equivalent. Since D(Ω) is dense in H 1
0 (Ω), it follows that
H 1
0 (Ω) ⊂V . Thus V = H 1
0 (Ω) and a(u,v) =

Ω ∇u∇v dx for all u,v ∈H 1
0 (Ω).
□
The fact that the constant c in (7.15) might be larger than 1 makes it difﬁcult to prove
Gaussian estimates, and no such simple criteria as in Section 7.1.3 are available. We com-
ment on techniques to prove Gaussian estimates in Section 8.7. Now we establish heritage
properties made possible by Gaussian estimates.
7.4.3. Gaussian estimates and extrapolation of holomorphy.
Let T be a C0-semigroup
on L2(Ω) which admits a Gaussian estimate. Assume that T is holomorphic of angle
θ ∈(0,π/2]. Then also the extrapolation semigroups Tp are holomorphic of the same
angle θ for each p ∈[1,∞].
This result due to Ouhabaz [Ouh95] (see [AtE97], Theorem 5.4, in the nonsymmetric
case) contrasts the examples in Sections 7.2.4 and 7.2.6, where, in absence of Gaussian
estimates, the angle depends on p and where T1 is not holomorphic.
7.4.4. Gaussian estimates and maximal regularity.
Let T be a C0-semigroup on L2(Ω)
which has Gaussian estimates. If T is holomorphic, then Tp has property (MR) for
1 < p < ∞.
This result is most important for applications to nonlinear equations. We refer to Sec-
tion 6.2.6 for the deﬁnition of (MR) and to [HP97], [CP01], [CD00], [Wei00b] and
[ArBu03a], Corollary 4.5, for proofs of this result.
Recall that holomorphy is a necessary condition for (MR). It may happen that a
semigroup T on L2(Ω) has Gaussian estimates without being holomorphic. In fact,
Voigt showed that the operator  + ix on L2(R) with suitable domain generates a
C0-semigroup S such that |S(t)f | ⩽G(t)|f |, but S is not holomorphic,cf. [LM97], p. 303.
However, so far no example of a nonholomorphic positive semigroup with Gaussian esti-
mates is known.
7.4.5. Gaussian estimates and H ∞-calculus.
Let −A be the generator of a holomor-
phic C0-semigroup on L2(Ω) admitting a Gaussian estimate. Assume that (A + ω) has

72
W. Arendt
a bounded H ∞-calculus for some ω ∈R. Then also (Ap +ω) has a bounded H ∞-calculus
for some ω ∈R, for all 1 < p < ∞.
This result is due to Duong and Robinson [DR96]. The restriction on Ω (doubling prop-
erty) made there was removed later by Duong and McIntosh [DM99]. We do not try to op-
timize the rescaling constant ω in our formulation, but rather refer to [DR96] and [AtE97],
pp. 118 and 122, for this.
We recall that on Hilbert space it sufﬁces that the semigroup T be quasicontractive to
insure (A + ω) to have a bounded H ∞-calculus for some ω.
7.4.6. Gaussian estimates and p-independence of the spectrum.
Let T be a C0-semi-
group on Lp(Ω) admitting a Gaussian estimate. Denote by Tp the extrapolation
C0-semigroup on Lp(Ω) and by Ap its generator. Then σ(Ap) = σ(A2), 1 ⩽p ⩽∞.
In [Are94] it was proved that the connected component of ρ(Ap) is p-independent,
the general result was obtained by Kunstmann [Kun99]. An example of special interest
are Schrödinger operators for which the result had been obtained before by Hempel and
Voigt [HV86].
8. Elliptic operators
In this section we apply the results obtained before to semigroups generated by elliptic op-
erators of second order. If the coefﬁcients and the domain in Rn are smooth, then classical
estimates of Agmon–Douglis–Nirenberg give precise information on the domain. Here we
consider merely measurable coefﬁcients. Then the domain can no longer be determined.
Under some mild conditions, however, Gaussian estimates can still be proved and lead to
a variety of semigroup and spectral properties. At the end of this chapter we mention also
some results for higher order operators and systems.
Let Ω ⊂Rn be an open set. Let aij, bi, ci, a0 ∈L∞(Ω), i,j = 1,...,n, be complex-
valued coefﬁcients. We assume the ellipticity condition
Re
n

i,j=1
aij(x)ξi ¯ξj ⩾α|ξ|2
for all ξ ∈Cn,x-a.e.,
where α > 0. Then we consider the elliptic operator

Lu = −

With the help of forms we will deﬁne various realizations of L in L2(Ω) corresponding to
diverse boundary conditions.

Let V be a closed subspace of W 1,2(Ω) containing W 1,2

Then aV is continuous and L2(Ω)-elliptic. Denote by AV the operator on L2(Ω) asso-
ciated with aV . Then −AV generates a holomorphic C0-semigroup TV on L2(Ω), and
we will investigate various properties of TV . At ﬁrst we describe the operator AV more
precisely. It follows from the deﬁnition of the associated operator that
AV u = Lu
for all u ∈D(AV ). We will consider in particular three different boundary conditions which
we describe in the following section.
8.1. Boundary conditions
(a) Let V = W 1,2
0
(Ω). Then we call AV the elliptic operator with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. In that case one has D(AV ) = {u ∈W 1,2
0
(Ω): Lu ∈L2(Ω)}.
(b) Let V = W 1,2(Ω). Then we call AV the elliptic operator with Neumann boundary
conditions. If coefﬁcients and domain are smooth, then for u ∈C2( 
Ω) one has u ∈D(AV )
if and only if

where ν = (ν1,...,νn) is the outer normal. This is a consequence of Green’s formula.
(c) Mixed boundary conditions are realized by taking
V = u|Ω: u ∈DRn \ Γ 	−W 1,2(Ω),
where Γ is a closed subset of ∂Ω.
8.2. Positivity and irreducibility
By Section 7.1.1 the semigroup TV generated by −AV is positive if and only if all coefﬁ-
cients are real valued and
u ∈V
implies
(Reu)+ ∈V.
(8.1)
This is, in particular, the case for all three boundary conditions considered in Section 8.1.
Moreover, if Ω is connected, then the semigroup is irreducible.

8.4. Quasicontractivity in Lp
Assume that all coefﬁcients are real valued. Assume furthermore that (8.1) and
u ∈V+ ⇒1 ∧u ∈V
(8.3)
hold. Then for each p ∈(1,∞) there exists ωp ∈R such that
TV (t)
L(Lp) ⩽eωpt,
t ⩾0.
(8.4)
This assertion is false though for p = 1 or p = ∞. However, if bj, cj ∈W 1,∞(Ω),
j = 1,...,n, then there exists ω ∈R such that
TV (t)
L(Lp) ⩽eωt,
t ⩾0,
(8.5)
for all p ∈[1,∞].
References: [Ouh92], [ABBO00], [Dan00], [[Ouh04]].
8.5. Gaussian estimates: real coefﬁcients
Assume that all coefﬁcients are real valued. Let V be one of the three spaces considered
in Section 8.1. In the case of Neumann or mixed boundary conditions assume that Ω has
the extension property (in the weak sense of Section 7.3.6). Then TV admits Gaussian
estimates; see [AtE97], [Dan00], [Ouh03]. In particular, we have the following conse-
quences: Denote by Tp the extrapolation semigroup of TV in Lp(Ω) and by −Ap its gen-
erator. Then
(a) Tp is a holomorphic C0-semigroup, 1 ⩽p < ∞.
(b) The operator Ap satisﬁes (MR), 1 < p < ∞.
(c) The operator (Ap + ω) has a bounded H ∞-calculus for ω large enough and
ϕH ∞(Ap + ω) < π/2, where 1 < p < ∞.
(d) The spectrum σ(Ap) is independent on p ∈[1,∞].

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
75
(e) Asymptotic behavior: Assume that Ω is connected and bounded. Then there exist u,
ϕ ∈L∞(Ω) such that
u(x) > 0,ϕ(x) > 0 a.e.,

Ω
u(x)ϕ(x)dx = 1,
and such that
e−ωtTp(t) −P
L(Lp(Ω)) ⩽Me−εt,
t ⩾0,
for all 1 ⩽p < ∞and some ε > 0, M ⩾0, where ω = s(Ap) and Pf =

Ω f (x)ϕ(x)dx · u.
This follows from Sections 7.4.3 for (a), 7.4.4 for (b), 7.4.5 for (c), 7.4.6 for (d) and
7.3.8 for (e) observing that Gaussian estimates imply ultracontractivity. We remark that
assertion (c) can already be deduced from (8.4) by Section 4.7.5.
8.6. Complex second-order coefﬁcients
If the coefﬁcients aij are complex-valued, the situation is more complicated. For Ω = Rn,
there are always Gaussian estimates if the aij are uniformly continuous [Aus96] or if
n ⩽2; but otherwise there are counterexamples (see Auscher, Coulhon and Tchamitchian
[ACT96] and Davies [Dav97]). If Ω is a Lipschitz domain and V = W 1,2
0
(Ω) or W 1,2(Ω),
then the existence of Gaussian estimates depends on the Lipschitz constant even for con-
stant complex aij : For small Lipschitz constant Gaussian estimates are valid in that case
[AT01a], but a counterexample based on [MNP85] is given for large Lipschitz constant.
However, if the imaginary parts of the aij are symmetric then Gaussian estimates are valid:
THEOREM ([Ouh03], Theorem 5.5). Assume that the imaginary parts of the coefﬁ-
cients satisfy
Imaij ∈W 1,∞,
Im(aij + aji) = 0.
Let V = W 1,2
0
(Ω) or W 1,2(Ω) assuming the extension property in the latter case. Then
TV admits Gaussian estimates.
8.7. Further comments on Gaussian estimates
Gaussian estimates were ﬁrst proved by Aronson [Aro67] for real nonsymmetric ellip-
tic operators on Rn with measurable coefﬁcients. He used Moser’s parabolic Harnack in-
equality [Mos64]. New impetus to the subject came from Davies [Dav87] who introduced
a perturbation method (“Davies’ trick”) which provides an efﬁcient tool to prove Gaussian
estimates via ultracontractivity.One of Davies’ motivations was to ﬁnd optimal constants in
the estimates, and the results are presented for symmetric operators in his book [[Dav90]].

76
W. Arendt
Here we do not explain how the Gaussian estimates are proved but refer to the correspond-
ing articles mentioned above and to [[Fri64]], [AER94], [AMT98], [DHZ94]. Some of
the semigroup properties put together here carry over to estimates valid for higher-order
equations, see, for example, [Are97], [Hie96], [HP97], [tER98].
8.8. The square root property
Assume that Ω ⊂Rn is open, bounded with Lipschitz boundary. Consider the operator AV
with
V = W 1,2
0
(Ω)
or
V = W 1,2(Ω),
i.e., Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are imposed. Let ω ∈R be large so that
AV + ω is sectorial. Then
D

(AV + ω)1/2	
= V.
This is an extremely deep result. For Rn, it is the famous Kato’s conjecture which was
solved recently by Auscher, Hofmann, Lacey, McIntosh and Tchamitchian [AHLMT02].
The result for the boundary conditions mentioned here is proved in [AT01a]. We refer to
these articles as well as [[AT98]] for the sophisticated techniques from harmonic analysis
leading to this result and also for various connections of these results with other areas.
We mention that Kato’s square root problem has also been solved for higher order elliptic
operators in Rn [AHMT01]. Finally, we mention an elegant short proof of the square root
property by ter Elst and Robinson [tER96b] (after previous work by McIntosh [McI85]) in
the special case where the second-order coefﬁcients are Hölder continuous.
8.9. The hyperbolic equation
We keep the notations and assumptions made in the beginning of this section, but we as-
sume in addition that
aij = aji,
i,j = 1,...,n.
Then the following holds.
THEOREM. The operator −AV generates a cosine function on L2(Ω) with phase space
V × L2(Ω).
The proof [[ABHN01], Theorem 7.1] given for V = W 1,2
0
(Ω) carries over to arbitrary
closed subspaces V of W 1,2(Ω) containing W 1,2
0
(Ω). The assertion of the Theorem im-
plies in particular the square root property D((AV + ω)1/2) = V (for ω large). However,
here AV is a certain perturbation of a self-adjoint operator [[ABHN01], Corollary 3.14.12]
for which the square root property is easy in comparison with the general result mentioned

Semigroups and evolution equations: Functional calculus, regularity and kernel estimates
77
8.10. Nondivergence form
Let aij ∈C(Rn) such that
Re

aij(x)ξiξj ⩾α|ξ|2
for all x ∈Rn, ξ ∈Rn and some α > 0. Consider the operator A on L2(Rn) given by
Af =
n

i,j=1
aijDiDju
with domain D(A) = H 2(Rn). If the coefﬁcients aij are Hölder continuous, then A gen-
erates a holomorphic C0-semigroup on L2(Rn) admitting Gaussian estimates [[Fri64],
Theorem 9.4.2]. However, there are no Gaussian estimates in general, if the coefﬁcients
are merely uniformly continuous and bounded, even if they are real [Bau84]. However,
by other methods (viz. the T 1 Theorem) Duong and Simonett [DS97] show that the
Lp-realization of the above operator is sectorial and has a bounded H ∞-calculus. Fur-
ther generalizations to VMO-coefﬁcients are given by Duong and Yan [DY01] by wavelet
methods and by Heck and Hieber [HH03] via weighted estimates.
8.11. Elliptic operators with Banach space-valued coefﬁcients
Elliptic operators with coefﬁcients in a Banach space and the associated parabolic equa-
tions were introduced and investigated by Amann [Ama01]. Further regularity results were
obtained by Denk, Hieber and Prüss [DHP01] where a comprehensive presentation of the
subject is given. A basic result is the following.
THEOREM ([DHP01], Section 5.5). Let X be a UMD-space, n, m ∈N, 1 < p < ∞,
aα ∈L(X) for multiindices α of order |α| = m. Assume the ellipticity condition
σ

A(ξ)
	
∈Σθ
for all ξ ∈Rn such that |ξ| = 1, and some θ ∈[0,π/2), where we set
A(ξ) =

|α|=m
aαξα,
ξ ∈Rn.
Consider the operator A on Lp(Rn,X) with domain D(A) = W m,p(Rn,X) given by
Au =

|α|=m
aαDαu.
Then A has a bounded H ∞(Σθ)-calculus. In particular, A is R-sectorial.

W. Arendt
This result can be extended to elliptic operators on Lp(Ω,X) with diverse boundary
conditions. It is remarkable that it is possible to characterize precisely those boundary con-
ditions for which maximal regularity (MR) is valid; viz. by the Lopatinskii–Shapiro con-
dition; see [DDHPV04].

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
89
1. Introduction
A scalar conservation law in one space dimension is a ﬁrst-order partial differential equa-
tion of the form
ut + f (u)x = 0.
(1.1)
Here u is called the conserved quantity while f is the ﬂux. Equations of this type often
describe transport phenomena. Integrating (1.1) over a given interval [a,b] one obtains
d
dt
 b
a
u(t,x)dx =
 b

ut(t,x)dx
= −
 b

f

u(t,x)
	
x dx
= f

u(t,a)
	
−f

u(t,b)
	
= [inﬂow at a] −[outﬂow at b].
In other words, the quantity u is neither created nor destroyed: the total amount of u con-
tained inside any given interval [a,b] can change only due to the ﬂow of u across boundary
points (see Figure 1). By the knowledge of the ﬂux function f (u), one should thus be able
to determine the evolution of u in future times.
Throughout the following, we shall be concerned with an n × n system of conservation
laws
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
∂
∂t u1 + ∂
∂x f1(u1,...,un) = 0,
...
∂
∂t un + ∂
∂x fn(u1,...,un) = 0.
For simplicity, this will still be written in the form (1.1), but keeping in mind that now
u = (u1,...,un) is a vector in Rn and that f = (f1,...,fn) is a map from Rn into itself.
The components u1,...,un are now called the conserved quantities, while f1,...,fn are
the ﬂuxes.
Systems of this form are often used in order to express the fundamental balance laws
of continuum physics, assuming that small viscosity or dissipation effects are neglected.
A primary example is provided by the Euler equations describing the evolution of a com-
pressible, nonviscous ﬂuid:
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
ρt + (ρv)x = 0
(conservation of mass),
(ρv)t +

ρv2 + p
	
x = 0
(conservation of momentum),
(ρE)t + (ρEv + pv)x = 0
(conservation of energy).
Here ρ is the mass density, v is the velocity while ρE = ρe + ρv2/2 is the energy density,
obtained as the sum of an internal energy ρe and the kinetic energy ρv2/2. The system is

closed by a constitutive relation of the form p = p(ρ,e), giving the pressure as a function
of the density and of the internal energy. The particular choice of p depends on the gas
under consideration.
Using the chain rule, the system (1.1) can be written in the quasilinear form
ut + A(u)ux = 0,
(1.2)
where A(u) .= Df (u) is the Jacobian matrix of ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of f . For
smooth solutions, the two equations (1.1) and (1.2) are entirely equivalent. However, if
u has a jump at a point ξ (see Figure 1), the left-hand side of (1.2) will contain a product
of the discontinuous function A(u) with the distributional derivative ux, which in this case
contains a Dirac mass at the point ξ. In general, such a product is not well deﬁned. Hence,
(1.2) is meaningful only within a class of continuous functions. On the other hand, the sys-
tem (1.1) is in divergence form and can be always interpreted in distributional sense. More
precisely, a locally integrable function u = u(t,x) is a weak solution of (1.1) provided that
  uφt + f (u)φx
dx dt = 0
(1.3)
for every differentiable function with compact support φ ∈C1
c .
We say that the above system is strictly hyperbolic if every matrix A(u) has n real,
distinct eigenvalues, say λ1(u) < ··· < λn(u). In this case, by a standard result of lin-
ear algebra one can ﬁnd dual bases of left and right eigenvectors of A(u), denoted by
l1(u),...,ln(u) and r1(u),...,rn(u), normalized according to
ri(u)
 = 1,
li(u) · rj(u) =

1
if i = j,
0
if i ̸= j.
(1.4)
To appreciate the consequences of the nonlinearity of the equations, consider ﬁrst the
case of a linear system with constant coefﬁcients:
ut + Aux = 0.
(1.5)

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
91
As before, we call λ1 < ··· < λn the eigenvalues of the matrix A and let {l1,...,ln},
{r1,...,rn} be dual bases of left and right eigenvectors, as in (1.4). One can then write
the general solution of (1.5) as a superposition of independent linear waves:
u(t,x) =

i
φi(x −λit)ri.
(1.6)
The functions φi can here be determined by decomposing the initial data u(0,·) with re-
spect to the given basis of eigenvectors:
u(0,y) =

i
φi(y)ri,
φi(y) .= li · u(0,y).
Notice that the solution (1.6) is completely decoupled along the eigenspaces of A. Each
component travels with constant speed, given by the corresponding eigenvalue of A.
In the nonlinear case (1.2) where the matrix A is not constant but depends on the state u,
new features will appear.
(i) The eigenvalues λi now depend on u. Since these eigenvalues determine the speeds
of propagation of the wave fronts, as a result the shape of the various components
in the solution will vary in time. In particular, rarefaction waves will decay, and
compression waves will become steeper, possibly leading to shock formation in
ﬁnite time (see Figure 2).
(ii) The eigenvectors ri also depend on u. These vectors determine the basis along which
the solution is decomposed. As a result, the various components are no longer inde-
pendent, and nontrivial interactions between waves of different families will occur.
In particular, the strength of the interacting waves may change and new waves can
be created, as the result of an interaction.
Of all these features, the most important for the mathematical theory is the possible loss
of regularity in the solutions, related to the formation of shocks [J]. This happens also be-
cause in our model equations we neglect small second-order terms that could provide a
smoothing effect. The strong nonlinearity of the equations, together with this lack of regu-
larity in the solutions, is responsible for many of the difﬁculties encountered in a rigorous
mathematical analysis. Indeed, most of the well established, powerful techniques of func-
tional analysis do not apply in this context. The theory of hyperbolic conservation laws has
thus progressed mainly by developing ad hoc methods.

A. Bressan
Toward the construction as well as the analysis of solutions, a basic building block is the
so called Riemann problem, where the initial data is piecewise constant:
u(0,x) =

u−
if x < 0,
u+
if x > 0.
(1.8)
This particular initial value problem was ﬁrst introduced in 1860 in a fundamental paper
of Riemann [Rm], who studied its solution in the context of isentropic gas dynamics. The
case of more general n × n systems was considered by Lax [Lx] nearly a century later. The
solution is assumed to be self-similar, having the form
u(t,x) = U(x/t).
The central position taken by the Riemann problem is related to a symmetry of the equa-
tions (1.1). If u = u(t,x) is any solution, then, for each θ > 0, the rescaled function
uθ(t,x) .= u(θt,θx)
provides another solution. The special solutions which are invariant under the above
stretching of coordinates are precisely the ones which solve a Riemann problem.
For the Cauchy problem with general initial data
u(0,x) .= ¯u(x),
(1.7)
the ﬁrst global existence theorem was proved in a fundamental paper by Glimm [G]. Ap-
proximate solutions are constructed by solving a family of Riemann problems, one for
each node of a ﬁxed grid in the t–x plane. The convergence of a sequence of approxi-
mations is guaranteed by a compactness argument, based on a priori bounds on the total
variation. A key idea in Glimm’s approach, which remained fundamental in nearly all sub-
sequent developments, is to control the total variation by means of a quadratic interaction
functional. Roughly speaking, this functional measures the amount of possible future inter-
actions among waves in a given solution. It is monotonically decreasing in time, provided
that the total variation is small enough. For this reason Glimm’s result, as well as most of
the present theory for n × n conservation laws, is restricted to the case of small BV data.
An alternative method for constructing approximate solutions to the general Cauchy
problem is by front tracking. This method was ﬁrst proposed by Dafermos [D1] to study
scalar conservation laws, then adapted by DiPerna to the case of 2 × 2 systems. More
recently, it has been reﬁned and extended to n × n systems in [B2,Ri,BaJ,AM2].
The underlying idea is quite simple. We seek approximate solutions which are piecewise
constant, having jumps along a ﬁnite number of straight lines in the t–x plane. For this
purpose, at time t = 0 we start with an initial data which is piecewise constant. At each
point of jump, we construct a piecewise constant approximate solution of the corresponding
Riemann problem. Piecing together these local solutions, we obtain a solution u = u(t,x)
which is well deﬁned until the ﬁrst time t1, where two lines of discontinuity interact. In this
case, the solution can be further prolonged in time by solving the new Riemann problem

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
93
determined by the interaction. This yields an approximation valid up to the next time t2 > t1
where two more fronts interact. Once again we solve the corresponding Riemann problem,
thus extending the solution further in time, etc.
This approach shares many features in common with the Glimm scheme. The Riemann
solutions remain the basic building blocks, and the control of the total variation relies on
exactly the same wave interaction functional introduced in [G]. However, there are some
distinct advantages:
• In the Glimm scheme, at each time step tj .= jt one has to replace the constructed
solution u(tj−,·) with a piecewise constant function u(tj,·), having jumps exactly
at the nodes of a ﬁxed grid. This is achieved by a random sampling procedure. As a
consequence, the approximate solution t →u(t,·) is not continuous as a map with
values in L1
loc. Moreover, the sum of all the errors

j⩾1
u(tj) −u(tj−)

L1
remains uniformly large as the mesh size t tends to zero. The convergence to an
exact solution stems from the fact that the differences u(tj) −u(tj−) are somehow
“random”: in the long run they tend to cancel each other out, according to the law of
large numbers. However, the analysis of the convergence rate is not an easy task.
The front tracking algorithm, on the other hand, constructs approximate solutions
u(t,·) whose jumps move with constant speed. Therefore, the map t →u(t,·) is now
Lipschitz continuous with respect to the L1 distance. This makes it much easier to
derive error estimates and properties of the limit solution.
• For the Glimm scheme, the dependence of the approximate solution on the initial data
is not continuous, and extremely difﬁcult to study. On the other hand, for a solution
u constructed by front tracking there is a natural class of perturbations which can
be analyzed in detail. Namely, one can slightly shift the locations of the jumps in
the initial data u(0,·) and estimate at a later time the corresponding shifts of the
wave fronts in u(t,·). This approach yields a basic understanding of the Lipschitz
continuous dependence of solutions on their initial data, in the L1 norm. In the 2 × 2
case, a rigorous proof along these lines was worked out in [BC1].
• A very effective tool in the analysis of smooth solutions to hyperbolic systems is the
method of characteristics. For a ﬁxed i ∈{1,...,n}, one looks at the curves x = xi(t)
in the t–x plane which satisfy the ordinary differential equation (ODE)
˙x(t) = λi
ut,x(t)		.
This method works perfectly well also for solutions constructed by front tracking.
In this case, the analysis is particularly simple because the characteristic curves are
polygonals.
• For a front tracking solution, to each front one can assign a generation order, count-
ing the number of interactions needed to produce it. Fronts originating at time t = 0
are the “primal ancestors”, and have order 1. When these interact, to the new fronts
emerging from the interaction we assign order 2, etc. This provides an additional,
useful tool for the analysis of solutions.

• Front tracking approximations have an elementary structure, being piecewise constant
in the t–x plane, with exactly 2 incoming wave fronts at each interaction point. Hence,
all of the relevant estimates can be obtained by the careful analysis of one single
building block: the Riemann problem generated by the interaction of two wave fronts.
By proving suitable estimates on front tracking approximations and passing to the
limit, relying on a general uniqueness theorem one can now obtain detailed results on
the existence, stability, local and global structure, and asymptotic behavior of weak
solutions.
On the negative side, one must mention one technical problem that has slowed down the
development of the front tracking method for several years. If the algorithm is implemented
in a straightforward way, it may well produce a solution with inﬁnitely many wave fronts
within ﬁnite time (see Figure 3). When this happens, the whole construction breaks down.
This unpleasant situation does not occur for scalar conservation laws, and can be easily
avoided in the 2 × 2 case. But for general n × n systems it represents a real difﬁculty. To
prevent the number of wave fronts from blowing up, some new technical provision must be
inserted. As shown in [B2,BaJ], this can be achieved by occasionally solving a Riemann
problem in a simpliﬁed way, which is not very accurate but involves a minimum number of
outgoing fronts. In the end, this modiﬁcation of the algorithm is a purely technical device,
which does not affect in any way the results which can be obtained by the method. Yet, it
lengthens a bit every proof, requiring one more case to consider before the punch line. For
this reason, we feel it somewhat detracts from the elegance of the whole approach.
2. Weak solutions
2.1. Basic deﬁnitions
A basic feature of nonlinear hyperbolic systems is the possible loss of regularity: solutions
which are initially smooth may become discontinuous within ﬁnite time. In order to con-
struct solutions globally in time, we are thus forced to work in a space of discontinuous
functions, and interpret the conservation equations in a distributional sense.

DEFINITION 2.1. Let f :Rn →Rn be a smooth vector ﬁeld. A measurable function u =
u(t,x) from an open set Ω ⊆R × R into Rn is a distributional solution of the system of
conservation laws
ut + f (u)x = 0
(2.1)
if, for every C1 function φ :Ω →Rn with compact support, one has
 
Ω

uφt + f (u)φx

dx dt = 0.
(2.2)
Observe that no continuity assumption is made on u. We only require u and f (u) to be
locally integrable in Ω. Notice also that weak solutions are deﬁned up to L1 equivalence.
A solution is not affected by changing its values on a set of measure zero in the t–x plane.
An easy consequence of the above deﬁnition is the closure of the set of solutions with
respect to convergence in L1
loc.
LEMMA 2.1. Let (um)m⩾1 be a uniformly bounded sequence of distributional solutions
of (2.1). If um →u in L1
loc, then the limit function u is itself a distributional solution.
PROOF. Indeed, the assumption of uniform boundedness implies f (um) →f (u) in L1
loc.

□
In the following, we shall be mainly interested in solutions deﬁned on a strip [0,T ]×R,
with an assigned initial condition
u(0,x) = ¯u(x).
(2.3)
In this case, it is convenient to require some additional regularity with respect to time.
DEFINITION 2.2. A function u:[0,T ] × R →Rn is a weak solution of the Cauchy
problem (2.1), (2.3) if u is continuous as a function from [0,T ] into L1
loc, the initial
condition (2.3) holds and the restriction of u to the open strip ]0,T [×R is a distributional
solution of (2.1).
2.2. Rankine–Hugoniot conditions
Let u be a weak solution of (2.1). If u is continuously differentiable restricted to an open
domain Ω′, then at every point (t,x) ∈Ω′, the function u satisﬁes the quasilinear system
ut + A(u)ux = 0,
(2.4)

96
A. Bressan
with A(u) .= Df (u). Indeed, from (2.2) an integration by parts yields
  
ut + A(u)ux

φ dx dt = 0.
Since this holds for every φ ∈C1
c (Ω′), the identity (2.4) follows.
Next, we look at a discontinuous solution and derive some conditions which must be
satisﬁed at points of jump. Consider ﬁrst the simple case of a piecewise constant function,
say
U(t,x) =

u+
if x > λt,
u−
if x < λt,
(2.5)
for some u−,u+ ∈Rn, λ ∈R.
LEMMA 2.2. If the function U in (2.5) is a weak solution of the system of conservation
laws (2.1), then
λ

(2.6)
PROOF. Let φ = φ(t,x) be any continuously differentiable function with compact support.
Let Ω be a ball containing the support of φ and consider the two domains
Ω+ .= Ω ∩{x > λt},
Ω−.= Ω ∩{x < λt},
as in Figure 4. Introducing the vector ﬁeld v .= (Uφ,f (U)φ), the identity (2.2) can be
rewritten as
 
Ω+∪Ω−divv dx dt = 0.
(2.7)
We now apply the divergence theorem separately on the two domains Ω+,Ω−. Call
n+,n−the outer unit normals to Ω+,Ω−, respectively. Observe that φ = 0 on the bound-
ary ∂Ω. Denoting by ds the differential of the arc-length, along the line x = λt we have
n+ds = (λ,−1)dt,
n−ds = (−λ,1)dt,

□
The vector equations (2.6) are the famous Rankine–Hugoniot conditions. They form a
set of n scalar equations relating the right and left states u+,u−∈Rn and the speed λ
of the discontinuity. An alternative way of writing these conditions is as follows. Denote
by A(u) = Df (u) the n × n Jacobian matrix of f at u. For any u,v, deﬁne the averaged
matrix
A(u,v) .=
 1
0
A

θu + (1 −θ)v
	
dθ
(2.8)
and call λi(u,v), i = 1,...,n, its eigenvalues. We can then write (2.6) in the equivalent
form
λu+ −u−	 = f u+	 −f (u−) =
 1
0
Df θu+ + (1 −θ)u−	 · u+ −u−	dθ
= A

u+,u−	
·

u+ −u−	
.
(2.9)
In other words, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions hold iff the jump u+ −u−is an eigen-
vector of the averaged matrix A(u+,u−) and the speed λ coincides with the corresponding
eigenvalue.
We now consider a more general solution u = u(t,x) of (2.1) and show that the
Rankine–Hugoniot equations are still satisﬁed at every point (τ,ξ) where u has an ap-
proximate jump, in the following sense.

98
A. Bressan
DEFINITION 2.3. We say that a function u = u(t,x) has an approximate jump discontinu-
ity at the point (τ,ξ) if there exist vectors u+ ̸= u−and a speed λ such that, deﬁning U as
in (2.5), there holds
lim
r→0+

r2
 r
−r
 r
−r
u(τ + t,ξ + x) −U(t,x)
dx dt = 0.
(2.10)
Moreover, we say that u is approximately continuous at the point (τ,ξ) if the above rela-
tions hold with u+ = u−(and λ arbitrary).
Observe that the above deﬁnitions depend only on the L1 equivalence class of u. Indeed,
the limit in (2.10) is unaffected if the values of u are changed on a set N ⊂R2 of Lebesgue
measure zero.
EXAMPLE 2.1. Let f −,f + :R2 →Rn be any two continuous functions and let x = γ (t)
be a smooth curve. Deﬁne the function
u(t,x) .=

f −(t,x)
if x < γ (t),
f +(t,x)
if x > γ (t).
At a point (τ,ξ), with ξ = γ (τ), call u−.= f −(τ,ξ), u+ .= f +(τ,ξ). If u+ = u−, then u is
continuous at (τ,ξ), hence also approximately continuous. On the other hand, if u+ ̸= u−,
then u has an approximate jump at (τ,ξ). Indeed, the limit (2.10) holds with U as in (2.5)
and λ = ˙γ (τ).
We now prove the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions in the more general case of a point of
approximate jump.
THEOREM 2.1. Let u be a bounded distributional solution of (2.1) having an approximate
jump at a point (τ,ξ). In other words, assume that (2.10) holds, for some states u−,u+
and a speed λ, with U as in (2.5). Then the Rankine–Hugoniot equations (2.6) hold.
PROOF. For any given θ > 0, one easily checks that the rescaled function
uθ(t,x) .= u(τ + θt, ξ + θx)
is also a solution to the system of conservation laws. We claim that, as θ →0, the conver-
gence uθ →U holds in L1
loc(R2;Rn). Indeed, for any R > 0, one has
lim

because of (2.10). Lemma 2.1 now implies that U itself is a distributional solution of (2.1),
hence, by Lemma 2.2, the Rankine–Hugoniot equations (2.6) hold.
□
2.3. Admissibility conditions
To motivate the following discussion, we ﬁrst observe that the concept of weak solution is
usually not stringent enough to achieve uniqueness for a Cauchy problem. In some cases,
inﬁnitely many weak solutions can be found.
EXAMPLE 2.2. For Burgers’ equation
ut +

u2/2
	
x = 0,
(2.11)
consider the Cauchy problem with initial data
u(0,x) =

1
if x ⩾0,
0
if x < 0.
For every α ∈]0,1[, a weak solution is
uα(t,x) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
0
if x < αt/2,
α
if αt/2 ⩽x < (1 + α)t/2,
1
if x ⩾(1 + α)t/2.
Indeed, the piecewise constant function uα trivially satisﬁes the equation outside the jumps.
Moreover, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions hold along the two lines of discontinuity {x =
αt/2} and {x = (1 + α)t/2}.
From the previous example it is clear that, in order to achieve the uniqueness and con-
tinuous dependence on the initial data, the notion of weak solution must be supplemented
with further “admissibility conditions” along shocks, possibly motivated by physical con-
siderations. A standard way to impose additional conditions is through the use of convex
entropies.
DEFINITION 2.4. A continuously differentiable function η :Rn →R is called an entropy
for the system of conservation laws (2.1), with entropy ﬂux q :Rn →R, if for all u ∈Rn
there holds
Dη(u) · Df (u) = Dq(u).
(2.12)
An immediate consequence of (2.12) is that, if u = u(t,x) is a C1 solution of (2.1), then
η(u)t + q(u)x = 0.
(2.13)

100
A. Bressan
Indeed,
Dη(u)ut + Dq(u)ux = Dη(u)

−Df (u)ux
	
+ Dq(u)ux = 0.
In other words, for a smooth solution u, not only the quantities u1,...,un are conserved
but the additional conservation law (2.13) holds as well. However, one should be aware
that, when u is discontinuous, the quantity η(u) may not be conserved.
A standard admissibility condition for weak solutions of (1.1) can now be formulated as
follows.
DEFINITION 2.5. Let η be a convex entropy for the system (2.1), with entropy ﬂux q.
A weak solution u is entropy-admissible if
η(u)t + q(u)x ⩽0
(2.14)
in distribution sense, i.e.,
  
η(u)ϕt + q(u)ϕx

dx dt ⩾0
(2.15)
for every function ϕ ⩾0 continuously differentiable with compact support.
For a bounded solution, we now show that the entropy admissibility condition (2.14)
poses additional restrictions every point of approximate jump.
THEOREM 2.2. Let u = u(t,x) be a bounded, entropy admissible solution of the system
of conservation laws (2.1). Let η be a convex entropy with ﬂux q. Assume that u has an
approximate jump at the point (τ,ξ), so that (2.10) holds. Then the left and right states
u−,u+ and the speed λ satisfy
ληu+	 −η(u−) ⩾qu+	 −q(u−).
(2.16)
PROOF. By the same rescaling argument used in the proof of Theorem 2.3, we conclude
that the function U in (2.5) is itself an entropy admissible solution. Given any nonnegative
function ϕ ∈C1
c , using the divergence theorem we ﬁnd
0 ⩽
 
η(U)ϕt + q(U)ϕx dx dt
=
 ληu+	 −η(u−) −qu+	 + q(u−)ϕ(t,λt)dt.
Therefore (2.16) must hold.
□
Of course, the entropy admissibility condition can be useful only if some nontrivial
convex entropy for the system (2.1) is known. Observe that (2.12) represents a ﬁrst-order
system of n partial differential equations for the two scalar variables η, q. For n ⩾3, this

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
101
system is overdetermined. In general, one should thus expect to ﬁnd solutions only in the
case n ⩽2. In mathematical physics, however, one encounters several special cases of
systems where a nontrivial convex entropy exists.
An alternative admissibility condition, due to Lax [Lx], is particularly useful because it
can be applied to any system and has a simple geometrical interpretation. We recall that a
function u has an approximate jump at a point (τ,ξ) if (2.10) holds, for some U deﬁned as
in (2.5). In this case, by Theorem 2.3 the right and left states u−,u+ and the speed λ of the
jump satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot equations. In particular, λ must be an eigenvalue of the
averaged matrix A(u−,u+) deﬁned at (2.8), i.e., λ = λi(u−,u+) for some i ∈{1,...,n}.
DEFINITION 2.6. A solution u = u(t,x) of (2.1) satisﬁes the Lax admissibility condition
if, at each point (τ,ξ) of approximate jump, the left and right states u−,u+ and the speed
λ = λi(u−,u+) of the jump satisfy
λi(u−) ⩾λ ⩾λi
u+	.
(2.17)
To appreciate the geometric meaning of this condition, consider a piecewise smooth
solution, having a discontinuity along the line x = γ (t), where the solution jumps from a
left state u−to a right state u+. According to (2.9), this discontinuity must travel with a
speed λ .= ˙γ = λi(u−,u+) equal to an eigenvalue of the averaged matrix A(u−,u+). If we
now look at the i-characteristics, i.e., at the solutions of the ODE
˙x = λi

u(t,x)
	
,
we see that the Lax condition requires that these lines run into the shock, from both sides.
3. The Riemann problem
In this section we construct the solution to the Riemann problem, consisting of the system
of conservation laws
ut + f (u)x = 0
(3.1)
with the simple, piecewise constant initial data
u(0,x) = ¯u(x) .=

u−
if x < 0,
u+
if x > 0.
(3.2)
This will provide the basic building block toward the solution of the Cauchy problem with
more general initial data. Throughout our analysis, we shall adopt the following standard
assumption, introduced by Lax [Lx].
(H) For each i = 1,...,n, the ith ﬁeld is either genuinely nonlinear, so that Dλi(u) ·
ri(u) > 0 for all u, or linearly degenerate, with Dλi(u) · ri(u) = 0 for all u.

102
A. Bressan
Notice that, in the genuinely nonlinear case, the ith eigenvalue λi is strictly increasing
along each integral curve of the corresponding ﬁeld of eigenvectors ri. In the linearly de-
generate case, on the other hand, the eigenvalue λi is constant along each such curve. With
the above assumption we are ruling out the possibility that, along some integral curve of an
eigenvector ri, the corresponding eigenvalue λi may partly increase and partly decrease,
having several local maxima and minima.
EXAMPLE 3.1. Denote by ρ the density of a gas, by v = ρ−1 its speciﬁc volume and by
u its velocity. A simple model for isentropic gas dynamics is then provided by the system

vt −ux = 0,
ut + p(v)x = 0.
Here p = p(v) is a function which determines the pressure in terms of the speciﬁc volume.
An appropriate choice is p(v) = kv−γ , with 1 ⩽γ ⩽3. In the region where v > 0, the
Jacobian matrix of the system is
A .= Df =

0
−1
p′(v)
0

.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found to be
λ1 = −

−p′(v),
λ2 =

−p′(v),
r1 =

1,

−p′(v)
	T ,
r2 =

−1,

−p′(v)
	T .
It is now clear that the system is strictly hyperbolic provided that p′(v) < 0 for all v > 0.
Moreover, observing that
Dλ1 · r1 =
p′′(v)
2

−p′(v)
= Dλ2 · r2,
we conclude that both characteristic ﬁelds are genuinely nonlinear if p′′(v) > 0 for all
v > 0.
As we shall see in the sequel, if the assumption (H) holds, then the solution of the
Riemann problem has a simple structure consisting of the superposition of n elementary
waves: shocks, rarefactions or contact discontinuities. This considerably simpliﬁes all fur-
ther analysis. On the other hand, for strictly hyperbolic systems that do not satisfy the
condition (H), basic existence and stability results can still be obtained but at the price of
heavier technicalities. See [L4] for an approach based on the Glimm scheme, or the recent
paper [BiB] for the vanishing viscosity approach.

3.1. Shock and rarefaction waves
Fix a state u0 ∈Rn and an index i ∈{1,...,n}. As before, let ri(u) be an i-eigenvector of
the Jacobian matrix A(u) = Df (u). The integral curve of the vector ﬁeld ri through the
point u0 is called the i-rarefaction curve through u0. It is obtained by solving the Cauchy
problem in state space:
du
dσ = ri(u),
u(0) = u0.
(3.3)
We shall denote this curve as
σ →Ri(σ)(u0).
(3.4)
Clearly, the parametrization depends on the choice of the eigenvectors ri. In particular, if
we impose the normalization |ri(u)| ≡1, then the rarefaction curve (3.4) will be parame-
trized by arc-length.
Next, for a ﬁxed u0 ∈Rn and i ∈{1,...,n}, we consider the curve of states u which can
be connected to the right of u0 by an i-shock, satisfying the Rankine–Hugoniot equations
λ(u −u0) = f (u) −f (u0).
(3.5)
As in (2.9), we can write these equations in the form
A(u,u0)(u −u0) = λ(u −u0),
(3.6)
showing that u −u0 must be a right i-eigenvector of the averaged matrix
A(u,u0) .=
 1
0
A

su + (1 −s)u0
	
ds.
By a theorem of linear algebra, this holds if and only if u −u0 is orthogonal to every
left j-eigenvector of A(u,u0), with j ̸= i. The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions can thus be
written in the equivalent form
lj(u,u0) · (u −u0) = 0
for all j ̸= i,
(3.7)
together with λ = λi(u,u0). Notice that (3.7) is a system of n −1 scalar equations in
n variables (the n components of the vector u). Linearizing at the point u = u0 one obtains
the linear system
lj(u0) · (w −u0) = 0,
j ̸= i,
whose solutions are all the points w = u0 + cri(u0), c ∈R. Since the vectors lj(u0) are
linearly independent, we can apply the implicit function theorem and conclude that the set

104

of solutions of (3.7) is a smooth curve, tangent to the vector ri at the point u0. This will be
called the i-shock curve through the point u0 and denoted as
σ →Si(σ)(u0).
(3.8)
Using a suitable parametrization (say, by arc-length), one can show that the two curves
Ri,Si have a second-order contact at the point u0 (see Figure 5). More precisely, the fol-
lowing estimates hold.

Ri(σ)(u0) = u0 + σri(u0) + O(1) · σ 2,

(3.11)
Here and throughout the following, the Landau symbol O(1) denotes a quantity whose
absolute value satisﬁes a uniform bound, depending only on the system (3.1).
3.2. Three special cases
Before constructing the solution of the Riemann problem (3.1) and (3.2) with arbitrary data
u−,u+, we ﬁrst study three special cases.
Case 1 – Centered rarefaction waves.
Let the ith ﬁeld be genuinely nonlinear, and as-
sume that u+ lies on the positive i-rarefaction curve through u−, i.e., u+ = Ri(σ)(u−) for
some σ > 0. For each s ∈[0,σ], deﬁne
λi(s) = λi

Ri(s)(u−)
	
.

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
105
Observe that, by genuine nonlinearity, the map s →λi(s) is strictly increasing. Hence,
for every λ ∈[λi(u−),λi(u+)], there is a unique value s ∈[0,σ] such that λ = λi(s).
For t ⩾0, we claim that the function
u(t,x) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
u−
if x/t < λi(u−),
Ri(s)(u−)
if x/t = λi(s) ∈

λi(u−),λi

u+	
,
u+
if x > tλi

u+	
,
(3.12)
is a piecewise smooth solution of the Riemann problem, continuous for t > 0. Indeed, from
the deﬁnition it follows
lim
t→0+
u(t,·) −¯u

L1 = 0.
Moreover, (3.1) is trivially satisﬁed in the sectors where x < tλi(u−) or x > tλi(u+),
because here ut = ux = 0. Next, assume x = tλi(s) for some s ∈]0,σ[. Since u is constant
along each ray through the origin {x/t = c}, we have
ut(t,x) + x
t ux(t,x) = 0.
(3.13)
We now observe that the deﬁnition (3.12) implies x/t = λi(u(t,x)). By construction, the
vector ux has the same direction as ri(u), hence it is an eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix
A(u) .= Df (u) with eigenvalue λi(u). On the sector {λi(u−) < x/t < λi(u+)} we thus
have
ut + A(u)ux = ut + λi(u)ux = 0,
proving our claim. Notice that the assumption σ > 0 is essential for the validity of this
construction. In the opposite case σ < 0, the deﬁnition (3.12) would yield a triple-valued
function in the region where x/t ∈[λi(u+),λi(u−)].
Case 2 – Shocks.
Assume again that the ith family is genuinely nonlinear and that the
state u+ is connected to the right of u−by an i-shock, i.e., u+ = Si(σ)(u−). Then, calling
λ .= λi(u+,u−) the Rankine–Hugoniot speed of the shock, the function
u(t,x) =

u−
if x < λt,
u+
if x > λt,
(3.14)
provides a piecewise constant solution to the Riemann problem. Observe that, if σ < 0,
then this solution is entropy admissible in the sense of Lax. Indeed, since the speed is
monotonically increasing along the shock curve, recalling (3.11) we have
λi

u+	
< λi

u−,u+	
< λi(u−).
(3.15)

106
A. Bressan
If η is a strictly convex entropy with ﬂux q, one can also prove that the entropy admis-
sibility conditions (2.16) hold, for all σ ⩽0 small. In the case σ > 0, however, one has
λi(u−) < λi(u+) and the admissibility conditions (2.16) and (2.17) are both violated.
Case 3 – Contact discontinuities.
Assume that the ith ﬁeld is linearly degenerate and that
the state u+ lies on the ith rarefaction curve through u−, i.e., u+ = Ri(σ)(u−) for some σ.
By assumption, the ith characteristic speed λi is constant along this curve. Choosing
λ = λ(u−), the piecewise constant function (3.13) then provides a solution to our Riemann
problem. Indeed, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions hold at the point of jump:
f

−f (u−) =


Ri(s)(u−)

= λi(u−) ·

Ri(σ)(u−) −u−
.
(3.16)
In this case, the Lax entropy condition holds regardless of the sign of σ. Indeed,
λi

u+	
= λi

u−,u+	
= λi(u−).
(3.17)
Moreover, if η is a strictly convex entropy with ﬂux q, one can show that the entropy
admissibility conditions (2.16) hold, for all values of σ.
Observe that, according to (3.16), for linearly degenerate ﬁelds the shock and rarefaction
curves actually coincide, i.e., Si(σ)(u0) = Ri(σ)(u0) for all σ.
The above results can be summarized as follows. For a ﬁxed left state u−and i ∈
{1,...,n} deﬁne the mixed curve
Ψi(σ)(u−) =

Ri(σ)(u−)
if σ ⩾0,
Si(σ)(u−)
if σ < 0.
(3.18)
In the special case where u+ = Ψi(σ)(u−) for some σ, the Riemann problem can then be
solved by an elementary wave: a rarefaction, a shock or a contact discontinuity.
3.3. General solution of the Riemann problem
Relying on the previous analysis, the solution of the general Riemann problem
(3.1) and (3.2) can be obtained by ﬁnding intermediate states ω0 = u−,ω1,...,ωn = u+
such that each pair of adjacent states ωi−1,ωi can be connected by an elementary wave,
i.e.,
ωi = Ψi(σi)(ωi−1),
i = 1,...,n.
(3.19)
This can be done whenever u+ is sufﬁciently close to u−. Indeed, for |u+ −u−| small, the
implicit function theorem provides the existence of unique wave strengths σ1,...,σn, such
that
u+ = Ψn(σn) ◦··· ◦Ψ1(σ1)(u−).
(3.20)

In turn, these determine the intermediate states ωi in (3.19). The complete solution is now
obtained by piecing together the solutions of the n Riemann problems
ut + f (u)x = 0,
u(0,x) =

ωi−1
if x < 0,
ωi
if x > 0,
(3.21)
on different sectors of the t–x plane. By construction, each of these problems has an
entropy-admissible solution consisting of a simple wave of the ith characteristic family.
More precisely:
Case 1.
The ith characteristic ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear and σi > 0. Then the solution
of (3.21) consists of a centered rarefaction wave. The ith characteristic speeds range over
the interval [λ−
i , λ+
i ], deﬁned as
λ−
i
.= λi(ωi−1),
λ+
i
.= λi(ωi).
Case 2.
Either the ith characteristic ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear and σi ⩽0, or else
the ith characteristic ﬁeld is linearly degenerate (with σi arbitrary). Then the solution
of (3.21) consists of an admissible shock or a contact discontinuity, traveling with Rankine–
Hugoniot speed
λ−
i
.= λ+
i
.= λi(ωi−1,ωi).
The solution to the original problem (3.1) and (3.2) can now be constructed (see Fig-
ure 6) by piecing together the solutions of the n Riemann problems (3.21), i = 1,...,n.
Indeed, for σ1,...,σn sufﬁciently small, the speeds λ−
i ,λ+
i introduced above remain close
to the corresponding eigenvalues λi(u−) of the matrix A(u−). By strict hyperbolicity and
continuity, we can thus assume that the intervals [λ−
i ,λ+
i ] are disjoint, i.e.,
λ−
1 ⩽λ+
1 < λ−
2 ⩽λ+
2 < ··· < λ−
n ⩽λ+
n .
Therefore, a piecewise smooth solution u:[0,∞) × R →Rn is well deﬁned by the assign-
ment

3.4. Some estimates
We conclude this section by proving two types of estimates, which will play a key role in
the analysis of front tracking approximations.
Fix a left state u−and consider a right state u+ .= Rk(σ)(u−) on the k-rarefaction curve.
In general, the function
u(t,x) .=

u−
if x < λk(u−),
u+
if x > λk(u−)
(3.23)
is not an exact solution of the system (3.1). However, we now show that the error in the
Rankine–Hugoniot equations and the possible increase in a convex entropy are indeed very
small.

Here O(1) denotes a quantity which remains uniformly bounded as u−ranges on bounded
sets.

PROOF. Call E(σ) the left-hand side of (3.24). Clearly E(0) = 0. Differentiating with
respect to σ at the point σ = 0 and recalling that dRk/dσ = rk, we ﬁnd
dE

σ=0
= λk(u−)rk(u−) −Df (u−)rk(u−) = 0.
Since E varies smoothly with u−and σ, the estimate (3.24) easily follows by Taylor’s
formula.
The second estimate is proved similarly. Call E′(σ) the left-hand side of (3.25) and
observe that E′(0) = 0. Differentiating with respect to σ we now obtain
dE′

σ=0
= λk(u−)Dη(u−)rk(u−) −Dq(u−)rk(u−) = 0,
because Dηλkrk = DηDf rk = Dqrk. Taylor’s formula now yields (3.25).
□
Next, consider a left state ul, a middle state um and a right state ur (see Figure 7).
Assume that the pair (ul,um) is connected by a j-wave of strength σ ′, while the pair
(ul,um) is connected by an i-wave of strength σ ′′, with i < j. We are interested in the
strength of the waves (σ1,...,σn) in the solution of the Riemann problem where u−= ul
and u+ = ur. Roughly speaking, these are the waves determined by the interaction of the
σ ′ and σ ′′. The next lemma shows that σi ≈σ ′′, σj ≈σ ′ while σk ≈0 for k ̸= i,j.
A different type of interaction is considered in Figure 8. Here the pair (ul,um) is con-
nected by an i-wave of strength σ ′, while the pair (ul,um) is connected by a second i-wave,
say of strength σ ′′. In this case, the strengths (σ1,...,σn) of the outgoing waves satisfy
σi ≈σ ′ + σ ′′ while σk ≈0 for k ̸= i.

Here O(1) denotes a quantity which remains uniformly bounded as u−ranges n
bounded sets.
PROOF. For u−,u+ ∈Rn, k = 1,...,n, call Ek(u−,u+) .= σk the size of the kth wave
in the solution of the corresponding Riemann problem. By our earlier analysis, the func-
tions Ek are C2 with Lipschitz continuous second derivatives.
For a given left state u−, we now deﬁne the composed functions Φk, k = 1,...,n, by
setting

The Φk are C2 functions of σ ′,σ ′′ with Lipschitz continuous second derivatives, depending
continuously also on the left state u−. Observing that

for all σ ′,σ ′′, k = 1,...,n,
by Taylor’s formula (see Lemma A.2 in the Appendix) we conclude that

Therefore

Moreover, by (3.30) the continuity of the second derivatives implies

4. Front tracking approximations
4.1. Global existence of entropy weak solutions
In this section we describe in detail the construction of front tracking approximations and
give the main application of this technique, proving the global existence of weak solutions.
Consider the Cauchy problem
ut + f (u)x = 0,
(4.1)
u(0,x) = ¯u(x),
(4.2)
where the ﬂux function f is smooth, deﬁned on a neighborhood of the origin. We always
assume that the system is strictly hyperbolic, and the assumption (H) holds, so that each

112
A. Bressan
characteristic ﬁeld is either genuinely nonlinear or linearly degenerate. The following basic
theorem provides the global existence of an entropy weak solution, for all initial data with
suitably small total variation.
THEOREM 4.1. There exists a constant δ0 > 0 such that, for every initial condition ¯u ∈
L∞(R;Rn) with
Tot.Var(¯u) ⩽δ0,
∥¯u∥L∞⩽δ0,
(4.3)
the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2) has a weak solution u = u(t,x) deﬁned for all t ⩾0. If
η is a convex entropy with entropy ﬂux q, one can construct a solution which also satisﬁes
η(u)t + q(u)x ⩽0.
(4.4)
The above theorem was ﬁrst proved in the fundamental paper of Glimm [G], where
approximate solutions are constructed by piecing together Riemann solutions on the nodes
of a ﬁxed grid. Here we shall describe an alternative construction, based on wave-front
tracking.
Roughly speaking, a front tracking ε-approximate solution (see Figure 9) is a piece-
wise constant function u = u(t,x) whose jumps are located along ﬁnitely many segments
x = xα(t) in the t–x plane. At any given time t > 0, all these jumps should approximately
satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions, namely

Moreover, if η is a convex entropy with ﬂux q, at each time t > 0 in view of (2.16) we also

ηu(t,xα+)	 −ηu(t,xα−)	
⩽O(1) · ε.
For didactical purposes, the proof of Theorem 4.1 will be given in two steps. In the ﬁrst
part of the proof we describe a naive front tracking algorithm and derive uniform bounds on
the total variation of the approximate solutions. Relying on Helly’s compactness theorem,
we also prove that a suitable subsequence of front tracking approximations converges to an
entropy weak solution. This ﬁrst step thus contains all the “heart of the matter”. It would
provide a complete proof, except for one gap: we are not considering here the possibility
that inﬁnitely many wave-fronts appear within ﬁnite time (see Figure 3). If this happens,
the naive front tracking algorithm breaks down, and solutions cannot be further prolonged
in time.
The only purpose of the second part of the proof is to ﬁx this technical problem. We
show that a suitable modiﬁed front tracking algorithm will always produce approximate
solutions having a ﬁnite number of wave-fronts for all times t ⩾0. This will achieve a
completely rigorous proof of Theorem 4.1.
4.2. A naive front tracking algorithm
Let the initial condition ¯u be given and ﬁx ε > 0. We now describe an algorithm which pro-
duces a piecewise constant approximate solution to the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2).
The construction (see Figure 9) starts at time t = 0 by taking a piecewise constant approx-
imation u(0,·) of ¯u, such that

(4.5)
Let x1 < ··· < xN be the points where u(0,·) is discontinuous. For each α = 1,...,N, the
Riemann problem generated by the jump (u(0,xα−),u(0,xα+)) is approximately solved
on a forward neighborhood of (0,xα) in the t–x plane by a piecewise constant function,
according to the following procedure.

Recalling (3.18), let ω0,...,ωn be the intermediate states and σ1,...,σn be the strengths
of the waves in the solution, so that
ω0 = u−,
ωn = u+,
ωi = Ψi(σi)(ωi−1),
i = 1,...,n.
(4.7)

Fig. 10. Partitioning a rarefront wave.
Fig. 11. See Figure 10.
If all jumps (ωi−1,ωi) were shocks or contact discontinuities, then this solution would be
already piecewise constant. In general, the exact solution of (4.6) is not piecewise con-
stant, because of the presence of centered rarefaction waves. These will be approximated
by piecewise constant rarefaction fans, inserting additional states ωi,j as follows (see Fig-
ure 10).
If the ith characteristic ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear and σi > 0, we divide the centered
i-rarefaction into a number pi of smaller i-waves, each with strength σi/pi. Since we want
σ/pi < ε, we choose the integer
pi .= 1 + [[σi/ε]],
(4.8)
where [[s]] denotes the largest integer less or equal to s. For j = 1,...,pi, we now deﬁne
the intermediate states and wave-fronts (see Figure 11)
ωi,j = Ψi(jσi/pi)(ωi−1),
xi,j(t) = ¯x +

t −¯t
	
λi(ωi,j−1).
(4.9)
For notational convenience, if the ith characteristic ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear and σi ⩽0,
or if the ith characteristic ﬁeld is linearly degenerate (with σi arbitrary), we deﬁne pi .= 1
and set
ωi,1 = ωi,
xi,1(t) = ¯x +

t −¯t
	
λi(ωi−1,ωi).
(4.10)
Here λi(ωi−1,ωi) is the Rankine–Hugoniot speed of the jump connecting ωi−1 with ωi,
so that
λi(ωi−1,ωi) · (ωi −ωi−1) = f (ωi) −f (ωi−1).
(4.11)
As soon as the intermediate states ωi,j and the locations xi,j(t) of the jumps have been
determined by (4.9) or (4.10), we can deﬁne a piecewise constant approximate solution to
the Riemann problem (4.6) by setting (see Figure 12)
v(t,x) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩

if x < x1,1(t),

if x > xn,pn(t),
ωi (= ωi,pi )
if xi,pi(t) < x < xi+1,1(t),
ωi,j
if xi,j(t) < x < xi,j+1(t),
j = 1,...,pi −1.
(4.12)

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
115
Fig. 12. Approximate solution to a Riemann problem.
We observe that the difference between this function v and the exact solution is only
due to the fact that every centered i-rarefaction wave is here divided into equal parts and
replaced by a rarefaction fan containing pi wave-fronts. Because of (4.8), the strength of
each one of these fronts is less than ε.
We now resume the construction of a front tracking solution to the original Cauchy prob-
lem (4.1) and (4.2). Having solved all the Riemann problems at time t = 0, the approximate
solution u can be prolonged until a ﬁrst time t1 is reached, when two wave-fronts inter-
act (see Figure 9). Since u(t1,·) is still a piecewise constant function, the corresponding
Riemann problems can again be approximately solved within the class of piecewise con-
stant functions. The solution u is then continued up to a time t2 where a second interaction
takes place, etc. We remark that, by an arbitrary small change in the speed of one of the
wave fronts, it is not restrictive to assume that at most two incoming fronts collide, at each
given time t > 0. This will considerably simplify all subsequent analysis, since we do not
need to consider the case where three or more incoming fronts meet together.
4.3. Bounds on the total variation
In this section we derive bounds on the total variation of a front tracking approximation
u(t,·), uniformly valid for all t ⩾0. These estimates will be obtained from Lemma 3.2,
using an interaction functional.
We begin by introducing some notation. At a ﬁxed time t let xα, α = 1,...,N, be the
locations of the fronts in u(t,·). Moreover, let |σα| be the strength of the wave-front at xα,
say of the family kα ∈{1,...,n}. Consider the two functionals
V (t) .= V

u(t)
	 .=


Q(t) .= Q

u(t)
	 .=

(α,β)∈A
|σασβ|,
(4.14)
measuring the wave interaction potential. In (4.14), the summation ranges over the set A
of all couples of approaching wave-fronts.
DEFINITION 4.1. Two fronts, located at points xα < xβ and belonging to the characteristic
families kα,kβ ∈{1,...,n}, respectively, are approaching if kα > kβ or else if kα = kβ and
at least one of the wave-fronts is a shock of a genuinely nonlinear family.
Roughly speaking, two fronts are approaching if the one behind has the larger speed
(and hence it can collide with the other, at a future time).
Now consider the approximate solution u = u(t,x) constructed by the front tracking
algorithm. It is clear that the quantities V (u(t)), Q(u(t)) remain constant except at times
where an interaction occurs. At a time τ where two fronts of strength |σ ′|,|σ ′′| collide, the
interaction estimates (3.27) or (3.29) yield
V (τ) .= V (τ+) −V (τ−) = O(1) ·
σ ′σ ′′,
(4.15)
Q(τ) .= Q(τ+) −Q(τ−) = −
σ ′σ ′′ + O(1) ·
σ ′σ ′′ · V (τ−).
(4.16)
Indeed (see Figure 13), after time τ the two colliding fronts σ ′,σ ′′ are no longer approach-
ing. Hence the product |σ ′σ ′′| is no longer counted within the summation (4.14). On the
other hand, the new waves emerging from the interaction (having strength O(1) · |σ ′σ ′′|)
can approach all the other fronts not involved in the interaction (which have total strength
⩽V (τ−)).
If V remains sufﬁciently small, so that O(1) · V (τ−) ⩽1/2, from (4.16) it follows
Q(τ+) −Q(τ−) ⩽−|σ ′σ ′′|
2
.
(4.17)
By (4.15) and (4.17) we can thus choose a constant C0 large enough so that the quantity
Υ (t) .= V (t) + C0Q(t)
decreases at every interaction time, provided that V remains sufﬁciently small.
We now observe that the total strength of waves is an equivalent way of measuring the
total variation. Indeed, for some constant κ one has
Tot.Varu(t) ⩽V u(t)	 ⩽κ · Tot.Varu(t).
(4.18)
Moreover, the deﬁnitions (4.13) and (4.14) trivially imply Q ⩽V 2. If the total variation
of the initial data u(0,·) is sufﬁciently small, the previous estimates show that the quantity
V + C0Q is nonincreasing in time. Therefore

This provides a uniform bound on the total variation of u(t,·) valid for all times t ⩾0.
An important consequence of the bound (4.19) is that, at every time τ where two fronts
interact, the corresponding Riemann problem can always be solved. Indeed, the left and
right states differ by the quantity
u+ −u− ⩽Tot.Var


which remains small.
Another consequence of the bound on the total variation is the continuity of t →u(t,·)

[t,t′] is handled in the same way, observing that the map t →u(t,·) is continuous across
interaction times.
4.4. Convergence to a limit solution
Fix any sequence εν →0+. For every ν ⩾1 we apply the front tracking algorithm and
construct an εν-approximate solution uν of the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2). By the

118
A. Bressan
previous analysis, the total variation of uν(t,·) remains bounded, uniformly for all t ⩾0
and ν ⩾1. Moreover, by (4.20) the maps t →uν(t,·) are uniformly Lipschitz continu-
ous with respect to the L1 distance. We can thus apply Helly’s compactness theorem (see
Theorem A.1 in the Appendix) and extract a subsequence which converges to some limit
function u in L1
loc, also satisfying (4.20).
Since uν(0) →¯u in L1
loc, the initial condition (4.2) is clearly attained. To prove that u is
a weak solution of the Cauchy problem, it remains to show that, for every φ ∈C1

compact support contained in the open half plane where t > 0, one has

Choose T > 0 such that φ(t,x) = 0 whenever t /∈[0,T ]. For a ﬁxed ν, at any time t call

4.4. A modiﬁed front tracking algorithm
For general n × n systems, the analysis given in the previous sections does not provide a
complete proof of Theorem 4.1, because the naive front tracking algorithm can generate in
ﬁnite time an inﬁnite number of wave-fronts, in which case the whole construction breaks
down.
We thus need to modify the algorithm, to ensure that the total number of fronts
remains uniformly bounded. Following [B2], we shall use two different procedures for

solving a Riemann problem within the class of piecewise constant functions: the Accurate
Riemann Solver (see Figure 15(a)), which introduces several new wave-fronts, and a Sim-
pliﬁed Riemann Solver (see Figure 15(b)), which involves a minimum number of outgoing
fronts. In this second case, all new waves are lumped together in a single nonphysical front,
traveling with a ﬁxed speed ˆλ strictly larger than all characteristic speeds. The main feature
of this algorithm is illustrated in Figures 16(a) and (b). If all Riemann problems are solved
accurately, the number of wave-fronts becomes inﬁnite (see Figure 16(a)). On the other
hand, if at a certain point we use the Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver, the total number of fronts
remains bounded for all times (see Figure 16(b)).
The Accurate Riemann Solver was described at (4.12). Next, we introduce a simpliﬁed
way of solving a Riemann problem, with ⩽3 outgoing fronts. Throughout the following,
ˆλ will denote a ﬁxed constant, strictly larger than all characteristic speeds λj(u).

122
A. Bressan
Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver
Consider again the Riemann problem (4.6) at a point (¯t, ¯x), say generated by the interaction
of two incoming fronts, of strength σ,σ ′. We distinguish two cases.
Case 1.
Let j,j′ ∈{1,...,n} be the families of the two incoming wave-fronts, with
j ⩾j′.
Assume that the left, middle and right states ul,um,ur before the interaction are related
by
um = Ψj(σ)(ul),
ur = Ψj′
σ ′	
(um).

(ul)
if j > j′,
Ψj


(ur)
if j = j′.
(4.35)
Let ˜v = ˜v(t,x) be the piecewise constant solution of the Riemann problem with data ul, ˜ur,
constructed as in (4.12). Because of (4.35), the piecewise constant function ˜v contains
exactly two wave-fronts of sizes σ ′,σ if j > j′, or a single wave-front of size σ + σ ′
if j = j′. It is important to observe that ˜ur ̸= ur, in general. We let the jump (˜ur, ur)
travel with the ﬁxed speed ˆλ, strictly bigger than all characteristic speeds. In a forward
neighborhood of the point (¯t, ¯x), we thus deﬁne an approximate solution v as follows (see
Figures 17(a) and (b))
v(t,x) =

˜v(t,x)
if x −¯x <

t −¯t
	ˆλ,
ur
if x −¯x > t −¯t 	ˆλ.
(4.36)
Notice that this Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver introduces a new nonphysical wave-front,
joining the states ˜ur,ur and traveling with constant speed ˆλ. In turn, this front may interact
with other wave-fronts. One more case of interaction thus needs to be considered.
Case 2.
A nonphysical front hits from the left a wave front of the ithe family (see Fig-
ure 17(c)), for some i ∈{1,...,n}.
Let ul,um,ur be the left, middle and right state before the interaction. If
ur = Ψi(σ)(um),
(4.37)
deﬁne the auxiliary right state
˜ur = Ψi(σ)(ul).
(4.38)
Call ˜v the solution to the Riemann problem with data ul, ˜ur, constructed as in (4.12).
Because of (4.38), ˜v will contain a single i-wave with size σ. Since ˜ur ̸= ur in general, we

let the jump (˜ur,ur) travel with the ﬁxed speed ˆλ. In a forward neighborhood of the point
(¯t, ¯x), the approximate solution u is then deﬁned again according to (4.36).
By construction, all nonphysical fronts travel with the same speed ˆλ, hence they never
interact with each other. The above cases therefore cover all possible interactions between
two wave-fronts.
To complete the description of the algorithm, it remains to specify which Riemann
Solver is used at any given interaction. For this purpose, to each wave-front we attach
a generation order, counting how many interactions were needed to produce it.
DEFINITION 4.2. The generation order of a front is inductively deﬁned as follows (see
Figure 18).
• All fronts generated by the Riemann problems at the initial time t = 0 are the “primary
ancestors” and have generation order k = 1.
• Let two incoming fronts interact, say of the families i,i′ ∈{1,...,n}, with generation
orders k,k′. The orders of the outgoing fronts are then deﬁned as follows.
Case 1: i ̸= i′.
Then
– the outgoing i-wave and i′-wave have the same orders k,k′ as the incoming ones;
– the outgoing fronts of every other family j ̸= i,i′ have order max{k,k′} + 1.
Case 2: i = i′.
Then
– the outgoing front of the ith family has order min{k,k′};
– the outgoing fronts of every family j ̸= i have order max{k,k′} + 1.
In the above, we tacitly assumed that at most two incoming wave-fronts interact at any
given time. This can always be achieved by an arbitrarily small change in the speed of the
fronts. We shall also adopt the following important provision:
(P) In every Riemann Solver, rarefaction waves of the same family as one of the incom-
ing fronts are never partitioned.

124
A. Bressan
Fig. 18. Generation orders of various wave-fronts.
In other words, if one of the incoming fronts belongs to the ith family, we set pi = 1 re-
gardless of the strength of the ith outgoing front. This guarantees that every wave-front can
be uniquely continued forward in time, unless it gets completely canceled by interacting
with other fronts of the same family and opposite sign.
To complete the description of the algorithm, given an integer ν ⩾1, at each point of
interaction we choose:
• The Accurate Riemann Solver, if the two incoming fronts both have generation order
less than ν.
• The Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver, if one of the incoming fronts has generation order
greater than or equal to ν, or if it is a nonphysical front.
In the remainder of this section we will show that, with the above modiﬁcations, the
front tracking algorithm yields a completely rigorous proof of Theorem 4.1. The proof is
given in several steps.
(1) Bounds on the number of wave-fronts.
Let N0 be the number of jumps in the initial
condition u(0,·). At every point where the Accurate Riemann Solver is used, we clearly
have an upper bound on the number of outgoing fronts, say less than or equal to M. By the
provision (P), after its birth no front is ever partitioned any further. Therefore,
[total number of fronts of ﬁrst generation] ⩽MN0.
Fronts of second generation can appear only because of an interaction among two fronts of
the ﬁrst generation. Hence,
[number of fronts of second generation] ⩽M(MN0)2.
By induction, we ﬁnd
[# of fronts of generation k + 1]
⩽M[# of fronts of generation k] · [# of fronts of generation ⩽k].

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
125
Hence, for each k = 1,...,ν + 1, there can be at most ﬁnitely many fronts of generation k.
We now observe that all physical fronts must have generation ⩽ν, while the fronts of
generation ν + 1 are precisely the nonphysical ones. Moreover, when a nonphysical front
interacts with a physical one, no additional front is generated (see Figure 17(c)). We thus
conclude that the total number of all wave-fronts is bounded.
(2) Bounds on the total variation.
The uniform estimates on the total variation are
obtained as in Section 4.2, with only minor changes that we describe here. The func-
tional (4.13), measuring the total strength of waves, must now include also the nonphysical
fronts. The strength of such fronts is simply deﬁned as the size of the jump, i.e.,
|σα| .=
u(xα+) −u(xα−)
.
The wave interaction potential (4.14) now takes into account also the nonphysical fronts.
For this purpose, our Deﬁnition 4.1 of approaching waves is supplemented by
• A nonphysical front located at a point xα approaches all other physical wave-fronts
(shocks, rarefactions or contact discontinuities) located at points xβ > xα.
Observe that all nonphysical fronts travel with exactly the same speed ˆλ. Hence (by
deﬁnition), they do not approach each other.
To establish the inequalities (4.15)–(4.19) in this more general case, the interaction es-
timates given in Lemma 3.2 must be supplemented with two additional estimates, holding
when the Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver is used.
LEMMA 4.1.
(i) Let σ,σ ′ be the sizes of two incoming fronts, say of the families j,j′. Let ul,um
and ur be the left, middle and right states before interaction, so that (4.34)
holds. Introducing the auxiliary right state ˜ur as in (4.35), one has (see Fig-
ures 17(a) and (b))
˜ur −ur
 = O(1) ·
σσ ′.
(4.39)
(ii) Let a nonphysical front connecting the states ul,um interact with an i-wave of
size σ, connecting um,ur, so that (4.37) holds. Deﬁning the auxiliary right state ˜ur
as in (4.38), one has (see Figure 17(c))
˜ur −ur
 −|um −ul| = O(1) · |σ||um −ul|.
(4.40)
PROOF. To establish the ﬁrst estimate, in the case where j > j′ we consider the map

σ,σ ′	
→Φ

σ,σ ′	 .= ˜ur −ur
= Ψj′
σ ′	
◦Ψj(σ)(ul) −Ψj(σ) ◦Ψj′

(ul).
(4.41)
This map is C2 with Lipschitz continuous second derivatives and satisﬁes
Φ(σ,0) = Φ

0,σ ′	
= 0
for all σ,σ ′.
(4.42)

126
A. Bressan
The estimate (4.39) is thus a consequence of Lemma A.2 in the Appendix.
In the case where j = j′, we apply the same arguments to the map
σ,σ ′	 →Φσ,σ ′	 .= ˜ur −ur = Ψj
σ + σ ′	(ul) −Ψj
σ ′	 ◦Ψj(σ)(ul).
(4.43)
To establish the second estimate, for a given left state ul, consider the map
Φ :Rn × R →Rn,
(v,σ) →Φ(v,σ) .=

Ψi(σ)(ul) + v
	
−Ψi(σ)(ul + v).
Observe that Φ is well deﬁned in a neighborhood of the origin, and twice continuously
differentiable with Lipschitz continuous second derivatives. Moreover,
Φ(v,0) = Φ(0,σ) = 0
for all v,σ.
(4.44)
Applying once again Lemma A.2, we conclude
Φ(v,σ) = O(1) · |v||σ|.
(4.45)
Choosing v = um −ul, we have
Φ(v,σ) = ˜ur + (um −ul)	 −ur = ˜ur −ur
	 −(ul −um)
and (4.40) follows immediately.
We observe that, in the above proofs, the various functions Φ together with their ﬁrst
two derivatives depend continuously on the left state ul. By Remark 2 in the Appendix, the
quantities O(1) thus remain uniformly bounded as ul ranges over a compact set.
□
Using the above estimates at every point where the Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver is used,
we can repeat exactly the same arguments in Section 4.2 and deduce the uniform bound
(4.19) on the total variation. In turn, this again implies the estimate (4.21) on the uniform
Lipschitz continuity with respect to time.
(3) Strength of each rarefaction front is small.
Whenever a new rarefaction front is intro-
duced, its strength is always less than ε. Because of the provision (P), this front is never
again partitioned, even if, as a result of subsequent interactions, its size becomes greater
than ε. The following analysis will show that, if the total strength of waves remains small,
the size of each rarefaction front never grows bigger than 2ε.
By construction, at a time t0 where a new rarefaction front is introduced by the Accurate
Riemann Solver, its size is σα(t0) ∈]0,ε]. We now examine how its strength can change
at times t > t0. Clearly, our front will never interact with rarefaction fronts of the same
family. When it hits a shock of the same family, its size will decrease due to a cancellation.
When it crosses a nonphysical wave, by construction its size remains unchanged. On the

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
127
other hand, by subsequent interactions with fronts of other families, our rarefaction front
may increase its initial strength. To keep track of its size σα(t) at any time t > t0, consider
the quantity
Vα(t) =

β∈A(α)
|σβ|,
where the summation is restricted to the set A(α) of all wave-fronts which are approach-
ing σα. Consider any interaction time τ > t0.
Case 1: The interaction does not involve the front σα.
Using the interaction estimates in
Lemma 3.2 or in Lemma 4.1, we obtain
σα(τ) = 0,
Vα(τ) + C0Q(τ) ⩽0.
Case 2: At time τ, the rarefaction front σα interacts with another front of strength |σβ|.
In this case, the interaction estimates imply that for some constant C′ there holds
Vα(τ) = −|σβ|,
Q(τ) < 0,
σα(τ) ⩽C′σα(τ−)
|σβ|.
By the previous analysis, the map
t →σα(t)exp

C′
Vα(t) + C0Q(t)

is nonincreasing in time. As a consequence, for all t > t0, we have

Vα(t0) + C0Q(t0)

⩽ε exp

C′
V (0) + C0Q(0)

⩽2ε,
provided that the total strength of waves remains sufﬁciently small.
(4) Total strength of all nonphysical fronts is small.
Let u be a front tracking approxi-
mation constructed by using the Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver whenever one of the incoming
fronts has generation greater than or equal to ν. Observing that an interaction involving an
incoming nonphysical front does not produce any new front, is becomes clear that:
• Physical fronts are precisely those of generation less than or equal to ν.
• Nonphysical fronts have generation order ν + 1.
• No front of generation order greater than or equal to n + 2 is ever created.
In the following, we show that the total strength of fronts of generation order ⩾k satisﬁes
a uniform bound which approaches zero as k →∞. For k ⩾1, call
Vk(t) .=

order(α)⩾k
|σα|

128
A. Bressan
the sum of the strengths of all waves of order greater than or equal to k in u(t,·). To obtain
a priori bounds on Vk we also deﬁne
Qk(t) .=

max{order(α),order(β)}⩾k
|σασβ|,
where the sum extends over all couples of approaching waves in u(t,·), say of order kα,kβ,
with max{kα,kβ} ⩾k. Moreover, call Ik the set of times where two waves of order kα,kβ
interact, with max{kα,kβ} = k. Repeating the arguments used to derive (4.15) and (4.16),
but now keeping track of the order of the wave-fronts involved in the interactions, we obtain
Vk(t) = 0,
t ∈I1 ∪··· ∪Ik−2,
Vk(t) + C0Qk−1(t) ⩽0,
t ∈Ik−1 ∪Ik ∪Ik+1 ∪···,
Qk(t) + C0Q(t)Vk(t−) ⩽0,
t ∈I1 ∪··· ∪Ik−2,
Qk(t) + C0Qk−1(t)V (t−) ⩽0,
t ∈Ik−1,
Qk(t) ⩽0,
t ∈Ik ∪Ik+1 ∪···.
(4.46)
Observe that (4.46)1 says that the total strength of waves of order greater than or equal to k
is unaffected by interactions involving wave-fronts of order less than or equal to k −2.
When one of the incoming waves has order greater than or equal to k −1, according
to (4.46)2 the growth of Vk is counterbalanced by the decrease of the interaction po-
tential Qk−1. The remaining estimates (4.46)3–5 provide bounds on the increase of the
potentials Qk.
In the following, we write [s]+ = max{s,0} and [s]−= max{−s,0} for the positive
and negative parts of a real number s. Observing that V1 = V, Q1 = Q and Vk(0+) =
Qk(0+) = 0 if k ⩾2, from (4.46) we deduce the two estimates

From (4.48) we deduce

= [total strength fronts of order ν + 1] ⩽C0V 2(0)γ ν−1.
(4.49)
Since γ < 1, the right-hand side of (4.49) approaches zero as ν →∞.
(5) Convergence to an entropy weak solution.
The remainder of the proof again follows
closely the arguments given in Section 4.4. Fix any sequence εν →0+. For every ν ⩾1,
we apply the modiﬁed front tracking algorithm and construct an approximate solution uν,
dividing all new rarefactions into fronts of size < εν and using the Simpliﬁed Riemann
Solver whenever one of the incoming fronts has generation order ⩾ν. By the previous
analysis, the total variation of uν(t,·) remains bounded, uniformly for all t ⩾0 and ν ⩾1.
Moreover, by (4.21) the maps t →uν(t,·) are uniformly Lipschitz continuous with re-
spect to the L1 distance. We can thus apply Theorem A.1 in the Appendix and extract a
subsequence which converges to some limit function u in L1
loc, satisfying (4.20).
To show that u is actually an entropy weak solution, we ﬁrst need to supplement
Lemma 3.2 with new error estimates concerning nonphysical fronts. Consider any such

To prove (4.22), or equivalently (4.23), we use again the divergence theorem. We
estimate the summation in (4.25), considering physical (shocks or rarefactions) and non-
physical fronts separately:

Indeed, the total strength of waves in uν remains uniformly bounded, while the total
strength of nonphysical fronts approaches zero as ν →∞. The limit (4.23) now follows
from (4.52). Therefore, u is a weak solution to the Cauchy problem.
Finally, consider a convex entropy η with ﬂux q. Given a nonnegative test function

Notes
The ﬁrst proof of global existence for weak solutions with small total variation appeared in
the fundamental paper of Glimm [G]. The striking new ideas introduced in this work have
been deeply inﬂuential, providing the foundation for much of the subsequent literature
on the subject. The original proof in [G] was based on the construction of approximate
solutions generated by Riemann problems along the nodes of a ﬁxed grid, with a restarting

131
procedure deﬁned through a random sampling. The convergence of a deterministic version
of this algorithm was later proved by Liu [L1]. An excellent presentation of the Glimm
scheme can be found in the book of Smoller [Sm].
The front tracking method for scalar conservation laws was introduced by Dafermos
[D1]. The technique was extended to 2 × 2 systems by DiPerna [DP1]. In this case, a naive
form of the algorithm already sufﬁces, since it produces only ﬁnitely many wave-fronts.
For general n × n systems, some technical adjustment in order to prevent the blow up of
the number of fronts becomes necessary. The use of a Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver, and the
deﬁnition of generation number of a wave-front were introduced in [B2]. Several variants
of this technique are found in the literature.
In [Sc2], Schochet chooses the speed of nonphysical fronts to be ˆλ = +∞. In other
words, when the Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver is used at a point P (see Figure 19), the non-
physical front is immediately sent to +∞, by solving a sequence of Riemann problems at
all points P1,P2,... to the right of P . This has the advantage of eliminating nonphysical
fronts altogether. The price to pay is that now the solutions have no longer ﬁnite propaga-
tion speed, while the map t →u(t,·) is no longer continuous with values in L1
loc.
In [BaJ], Baiti and Jenssen show that, instead counting the generation number, the choice
between Accurate and Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver can be based solely on the strengths
σ,σ ′ of the two incoming waves. Given a small threshold value ρ > 0, one can use the
Accurate Solver if |σσ ′| ⩾ρ and the Simpliﬁed Solver if |σσ ′| < ρ.
Yet another possibility, considered in [Ri,HR], is to deﬁne a Simpliﬁed Riemann Solver
by attaching all new waves to one of the two main fronts involved in the interaction (see
Figure 20). This method appears to be numerically efﬁcient, because it completely avoids
the introduction of nonphysical wave-fronts, and all the computations connected with them.
A rigorous analysis of this algorithm requires interaction estimates slightly more general
than Lemma 3.2. Indeed, one must keep in mind that each front can now contain waves of
several different families.
Early applications of the front tracking algorithm to special systems are found in the
papers of Alber [Al], Lin [Ln] and Wendroff [W].
The above global existence result has been generalized by Liu [L4] to general n × n
systems, without the hypothesis (H) of genuine nonlinearity or linear degeneracy, using
the Glimm scheme. A front tracking algorithm for these more general systems was recently
developed in [AM2].

The smallness assumption on the total variation is essential. For large initial data, a local
existence theorem was proved by Schochet [Sc1]. A counterexample to global existence,
showing that the L∞norm of solutions can blow up in ﬁnite time, was constructed by
Jenssen [Je].
5. Uniqueness and stability
In the previous section, the existence of a global weak solution was proved by a compact-
ness argument, which did not provide any information on the uniqueness of the limit. Our
next goal is to show that front tracking approximations converge to a unique limit solution,
continuously depending on the initial data.
5.1. A Lyapunov functional
In order to estimate the distance between two front tracking solutions, we introduce a func-
tional Φ = Φ(u,v), uniformly equivalent to the L1 distance, which is “almost decreasing”
along pairs of solutions. Throughout the following, it will be convenient to use an alterna-
tive parametrization of shock and rarefaction curves, in terms of the characteristic speeds.
• If the ith ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear, the i-shock and i-rarefaction curve through a
point u0 are parametrized so that
λi

Si(σ)(u0)
	
−λi(u0) = σ,
(5.1)
λi

Ri(σ)(u0)
	
−λi(u0) = σ.
• For a linearly degenerate ﬁeld, the shock and rarefaction curves are always parame-
trized by arc-length.
Thanks to this choice of the parametrization, we now have the identity
Si(−σ) ◦Si(σ)(u0) = u0,
(5.2)
which could have failed otherwise. We also observe that the second-order tangency con-
dition (3.10) between shock and rarefaction curves still holds, while (3.11) now takes the
form
λi
Si(σ)(u0), u0
	 = λi(u0) + σ
2 + O(1) · σ 2.
We now begin the construction of the functional Φ. Given two piecewise constant func-
tions u,v, consider the scalar functions qi deﬁned implicitly by (see Figure 21)
v(x) = Sn

qn(x)
	
◦··· ◦S1

Intuitively, qi(x) can be regarded as the strength of the ith component of the jump
(u(x),v(x)), measured along shock curves. On a compact neighborhood of the origin we
clearly have

provides an equivalent way to measure the L1 distance between u and v. Unfortunately,
this integral may well increase in time, along a pair of front tracking solutions. To achieve
our goal, suitable weights Wi must be inserted. We thus consider the functional

134
A. Bressan
We recall that Q is the interaction potential introduced at (4.14). The total strength of
wave-fronts approaching qi(x) is deﬁned as follows. If the ith ﬁeld is linearly degenerate,
we simply take
Ai(x) .=
!

xα<x,i<kα⩽n

|σα|.
(5.8)
The summations here extend to waves both of u and of v. Notice that here we are consid-
ering fronts located behind x with a faster speed, and fronts located ahead of x with slower
speed.
On the other hand, if the ith ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear, our deﬁnition of Ai will contain
an additional term, accounting for waves in u and in v of the same ith family:
Ai(x) .=


(5.9)
Here and in the sequel, J (u) and J (v) denote the sets of all jumps in u and in v, while
J .= J (u) ∪J (v). Notice that the strengths of nonphysical waves do enter in the deﬁni-
tion of Q. Indeed, a nonphysical front located at xα approaches all shock and rarefaction
fronts located at points xβ > xα. On the other hand, nonphysical fronts play no role in the
deﬁnition of Ai.
The values of the large constants κ1,κ2 in (5.7) will be speciﬁed later. Observe that, as
soon as these constants have been assigned, we can then impose a suitably small bound on
the total variation of u,v so that
1 ⩽Wi(x) ⩽2
for all i,x.
(5.10)
From (5.4), (5.6) and (5.10) it thus follows
1
C1
∥v −u∥L1 ⩽Φ(u,v) ⩽2C1∥v −u∥L1.
(5.11)
In the following, by an ε-approximate front tracking solution of the system (4.1) we
mean a piecewise constant function u = u(t,x) constructed as in the previous section,
such that:
• Every shock front satisﬁes the Rankine–Hugoniot equations exactly, and is entropy
admissible.

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
135
• Every rarefaction front has strength σα ∈]0,ε] and travels with speed ˙xα =
λi(u(xα−)), i.e., with the characteristic speed of its left state.
• All nonphysical front travel with the ﬁxed speed ˆλ. The total strength of all nonphys-
ical fronts in u(t,·) is always lees than or equal to ε.
The existence of ε-approximate solutions was discussed in the previous section. One
should mention that, to prevent three or more fronts interacting at a same point, we may
need to slightly change the speed of one of the incoming fronts. To avoid pointless techni-
calities, in all future estimates we neglect this additional error term, since it clearly can be
made arbitrarily small. Recalling the deﬁnition Υ (u) .= V (u) + C0Q(u), the basic L1 sta-
bility estimate for front tracking approximations can now be stated as follows.
THEOREM 5.1. For suitable constants C2,κ1,κ2,δ0 > 0 the following holds. Let u,v be
ε-approximate front tracking solutions of (4.1) having small total variation, so that
Υ

u(t)
	
< δ0,
Υ

v(t)
	
< δ0
for all t ⩾0.
(5.12)
Then the functional Φ in (5.6)–(5.9) satisﬁes
Φu(t),v(t)	 −Φu(s),v(s)	 ⩽C2ε(t −s)
for all 0 ⩽s < t.
(5.13)
Toward a proof, the key point is to understand how the functional Φ evolves in time.
Outside interaction times, the change in Φ is only due to the fact that the locations xα of
the jumps in u and v move with constant speeds ˙xα. Therefore

Recalling the decomposition (5.3), at each point x we deﬁne the intermediate states

the speed of the i-shock connecting ωi−1(x) with ωi(x). For convenience, we shall use the

The assumption that u(t,·) and v(t,·) are integrable and piecewise constant implies

As usual, by the Landau symbol O(1) we denote a quantity whose absolute value satisﬁes
a uniform bound, depending only on the system (4.1). In particular, this bound should not
depend on ε or on the functions u,v.
From (5.19) and (5.20), recalling that the total strength of nonphysical fronts is less than
or equal to ε and the total strength of shock and rarefaction fronts satisﬁes the uniform
bound (5.12), we obtain
d

(5.21)
Moreover, at each time τ where two fronts in u or two fronts in v interact, by (4.17) the
corresponding functional Q(u) or Q(v) is strictly decreasing. Therefore, if the constant κ2
in (5.7) is chosen large enough, all weight functions Wi(x) will decrease at each time τ
where two fronts of u or two fronts of v interact. Observing that the maps t →qi(t,·) are
continuous with values in L1 also at interaction times, we conclude
Φ

u(τ+), v(τ+)

proving the theorem. All the remaining work is thus aimed at establishing the key esti-
mates (5.19) and (5.20). In the remainder of this section we illustrate some features of the
functional Φ, pointing out the leading terms that contribute to its decrease in time.
Given two piecewise constant functions u,v with compact support, for i = 1,...,n, we
can deﬁne the scalar components ui,vi by induction on the jump points of u,v. We start
by setting ui(−∞) = vi(−∞) = 0. If xα ∈J (u) is a jump point of u, then we let vi be
constant across xα and set
ui(xα+) .= ui(xα−) −

qi(xα+) −qi(xα−)

.
On the other hand, if xα ∈J (v) is a jump point of v, then we let ui be constant across xα
and set
vi(xα+) .= vi(xα−) + qi(xα+) −qi(xα−).
These deﬁnitions trivially imply
qi(x) = vi(x) −ui(x)
for all x ∈R, i = 1,...,n.
Observe that, according to the deﬁnition (5.9), the i-waves in u and v which approach
qi(x) are those located within the thick portions of the graphs of ui, vi in Figure 22. Vice
versa, for a given i-wave σα located at xα, the regions where the jumps qi(x) approach σα
are represented by the shaded areas in Figure 23.
Inserting the expressions for the weights (5.8) or (5.9) inside (5.7) and interchanging the
summation with the integral, the functional Φ in (5.6) can be written in the equivalent form
Φ(u,v) =

To understand why the expression (5.23) should decrease in time, assume ﬁrst that v has
a wave-front at xα with strength σα, say in the kth family. To ﬁx the ideas, assume that
uk(xα) < vk(xα+) < vk(xα−). In connection with this front (see Figure 24), for every
i < k, the functional Φ(u,v) contains a term of the form
Φα,i .= κ1|σα|[area of the region between
the graphs of ui and vi, to the right of xα].
By strict hyperbolicity, the ith and kth characteristic speeds are strictly separated, say
λk −λi ⩾c > 0. We thus expect

up to higher-order terms. Here λα

In addition, for every i > k, the functional Φ(u,v) contains a term of the form
Φα,i .= κ1|σα|[area of the region between
the graphs of ui and vi, to the left of xα].

139
Fig. 25. Decrease of the functional due to genuine nonlinearity.
Entirely similar estimates can be proved also for these terms. In our future estimates
(5.50) and (5.54), the leading negative terms on the right-hand sides correspond to (5.24)
and are motivated by Figure 24.
Next, if the kth ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear, according to (5.23) the functional Φ(u,v)
also contains a term of the form (see Figure 25)
Φα,k .= κ1|σα|[area of the region between
the graphs of uk and vk, to the right of xα].
Notice that, because of genuine nonlinearity, the points on the graphs of uk and vk move
with different speeds. As a consequence, the shape of these graphs changes in time. In
particular, while the area enclosed by the two graphs may remain constant, the portion
of this area located to the right of a given front σα will decrease. In Figure 25, the two
points P,Q lie initially on the same vertical line. At a later time this is no longer true.
The area of the shaded region, enclosed by the graphs of uk and vk and by a vertical line
through P , has decreased by an amount roughly equal to the area of the triangular region
with vertices P,P ′,Q.
Recalling the parametrization (5.1), the difference between the speed ˙xα of the jump σα
at P and the average speed λα−

Fig. 26. Decrease of the functional due to a shock.
Yet another kind of estimate is needed in the case where the jump in vk crosses the
graph of uk, say vk(xα+) < uk(xα) < vk(xα−). This happens when v has a shock of the
kth family, say of strength σα, with

where the above area includes points both on the right and on the left of xα.

In our future estimate (5.66), the leading negative term on the right-hand side corresponds
to (5.27) and is motivated by Figure 26. Notice that in this last case the decrease of the
functional Φ is simply due to the decrease of the L1 distance between the kth components
of u and v. In this occasion, the weights Wk play no role.

In this section we establish the key estimates (5.19) and (5.20), thus completing the proof
of Theorem 5.1. We shall always assume that xα is a point where v has a jump in the kαth
family, of size σα. The case of a jump in u is entirely similar. In the following, since all
computations refer to a ﬁxed jump α ∈J (v), we shall often drop the superscript “α” and
simply write W +
i
.= W α+
i
, q−
kα
.= qα−
kα , v−.= v(xα−), v+ .= v(xα+), etc. The proof will be
given in several steps.
(1) Nonphysical fronts.
If α ∈NP is a nonphysical front, the jump travels with the ﬁxed
speed ˙xα = ˆλ and σα .= |v+ −v−|. Hence, for i = 1,...,n, one has
q+
i −q−
i = O(1) · σα,
(5.28)
λ+
i −λ−
i = O(1) · σα.
Moreover, from the deﬁnitions (5.7)–(5.9) and the bound (5.10) it follows
W +
i −W −
i
 ⩽1
for all i.
(5.29)
If q−
i and q+
i have the same sign, then
W +
i = W −
i .
If q−
i and q+
i have opposite signs, then (5.28) implies
|q−
i | +
q+
i
 = O(1) · σα.
Writing

the estimate (5.19) is now clear.
(2) Reduction to the shock case.
We now work toward the estimate (5.20). In order to
reduce the number of cases that must be considered, we now show that rarefaction fronts
can be replaced by shock fronts of the same size. More precisely, in the case of a physical
front α ∈R ∪S of strength σα, consider the auxiliary state and speed
v⊕.= Skα(σα)(v−),
˙x∗

We now consider two cases.
Case 1: The jump at xα is a shock or a contact discontinuity.
In this case v⊕= v+ and
hence we trivially have
˙x∗
α = ˙xα,
q⊕
i = q+
i ,
ω⊕
i = ω+
i ,
λ⊕
i = λ+
i
(5.33)
for all i = 1,...,n.
Case 2: The jump at xα is a rarefaction, hence 0 < σα ⩽ε.
In this case, since shock and
rarefaction curves have a tangency of second order, we have v⊕−v+ = O(1) · |σα|3 and
hence
q⊕
i −q+
i = O(1) · |σα|3,
ω⊕
i −ω+
i = O(1) · |σα|3,
(5.34)
λ⊕

i = O(1) · |σα|3
for all i. Moreover,

In view of the estimates (5.33) and (5.34), for each i = 1,...,n, we have
E′′
α,i =

0
if σα < 0,
O(1) · |σα|3
if σα ∈[0,ε].
(5.37)
Toward a bound for E′′′
α,i, observe that the deﬁnitions (5.7)–(5.9) of the weights imply
W +
i −W −
i = O(1) · κ1σα
if q+
i q−
i > 0.
Moreover, we have the estimates
q+
i −q−
i = O(1) · |σα|,
q−
i = O(1) · |σα|
if q+
i q−
i ⩽0.
By (5.10), the bound (5.29) always holds. Using (5.35) together with the above estimates,
we deduce
E′′′
α,i = O(1) · ε|σα|.
(5.38)
Thanks to (5.37) and (5.38), the proof of (5.20) is reduced to showing that
n

i=1
E′
α,i ⩽O(1) · ε|σα|,
(5.39)
with E′
α,i deﬁned at (5.36). In our future estimates, we can thus replace v+ with v⊕and
˙xα with ˙x∗
α. In essence, this reduces the problem to the case (5.32) where the right state v⊕
is connected to the left state v−by a kα-shock, traveling with the exact Rankine–Hugoniot
speed. From now on, we will work toward a proof of (5.39) in the case α ∈R ∪S.
(3) A technical tool.
We describe here a simple technique for deriving a number of a priori
bounds. First of all, observe that, as soon as the state u−= u(xα−) is assigned, all quan-
tities v−,v+,λ−
i ,q⊕
i ,λ⊕
i ,ω−
i ,ω⊕
i ,... can then be recovered as functions of q−
1 ,...,q−
n
and σα. Indeed, v−is obtained from (5.3), while v⊕and ˙x∗
α are obtained by (5.30). In turn,
the components q⊕
i are implicitly determined by (5.31), while (5.14) and (5.32) deﬁne the
intermediate states ω−
i and ω⊕
i , respectively. Introducing the variables
˜q .= (q−
1 ,...,q−
kα−1,q−
kα+1,...,q−
n ) ∈Rn−1,
q∗.= q−
kα,
σ .= σα,
one can thus apply Lemma A.3 or Lemma A.4 to functions of the form
Ψ = Ψ (q−
1 ,...,q−
n ,σα) = Ψ

˜q,q∗,σ
	
and derive useful a priori estimates.

For example, if the kαth ﬁeld is linearly degenerate, then each of the functions
Ψi .= q⊕
i −q−
i ,
i ̸= kα,
Ψkα
.= q⊕
kα −q−
kα −σα,
satisﬁes the assumptions (A.18) and (A.20) of Lemma A.3. Therefore, (A.21) yields the
estimate

(5.40)
On the other hand, if kαth ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear, then the above functions Ψi,Ψkα
satisfy only the assumptions (A.18) of Lemma A.3. In this case, (A.19) yields the weaker
estimate

Ψ ′′

so that the identities in (5.33) hold. For notational convenience, consider the two sets of

In all cases, the above analysis shows that the bound (5.39) holds, provided that we ﬁrst
choose the constants κ1,κ2 suitably large, then we let the total variation be sufﬁciently
small. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.1.
5.3. A semigroup of solutions
Recalling the deﬁnitions (4.13) and (4.14), consider a domain of the form
D = cl

u ∈L1
R;Rn	
; u is piecewise constant,
Υ (u) .= V (u) + C0 · Q(u) < δ0
,
(5.71)
where cl denotes closure in L1. For a suitable choice of the constants C0 and δ0 > 0, within
the proof of Theorem 4.1 we showed that, for every ¯u ∈D, one can construct a convergent

151
sequence of front tracking approximationstaking values inside D. Relying on Theorem 5.1,
we now show that the limit of these approximate solutions is unique and depends Lipschitz
continuously on the initial data.
THEOREM 5.2. Fix ¯u ∈D and consider a sequence εν →0. Then every sequence of
εν-approximate solutions uν :[0,∞[ →D of the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2) con-
verges to a unique limit solution u:[0,∞[ →D. The map (¯u,t) →u(t,·) .= St ¯u is a
uniformly Lipschitz semigroup, satisfying
S0 ¯u = ¯u,
Ss(St ¯u) = Ss+t ¯u,
(5.72)
∥St ¯u −Ss ¯v∥L1 ⩽L∥¯u −¯v∥L1 + L′|t −s|
for all ¯u, ¯v ∈D, s,t ⩾0.
(5.73)
PROOF. Let ¯u ∈D be given. Consider any sequence {uν}ν⩾1, such that each uν is a front
tracking εν-approximate solution of (4.1), with εν →0 and
uν(0,·) −¯u

L1 ⩽εν,


uν(t)

for all t ⩾0,ν ⩾1.
For every μ,ν ⩾1 and t ⩾0, by (5.4), (5.10) and (5.13), it now follows
uμ(t) −uν(t)

L1 ⩽C1 · Φ

⩽2C2

uμ(0) −uν(0)

L1 + C1C2t max{εμ, εν}.
(5.74)
Since the right-hand side of (5.74) approaches zero as μ,ν →∞, the sequence is Cauchy
and converges to a unique limit.
The semigroup property (5.72) is an immediate consequence of uniqueness. To prove
the continuous dependence on the initial data, let ¯u, ¯v ∈D be given. For each ν ⩾1, let
uν,vν be front tracking εν-approximate solutions of (4.1) with
uν(0) −¯u

L1 < εν,
vν(0) −¯v


(5.75)
Using again (5.4) and (5.13), we deduce

(5.76)
This establishes the uniform Lipschitz continuity of the semigroup with respect to the
initial data. The uniform Lipschitz continuity with respect to time is an immediate conse-
quence of (4.20).

5.4. Notes
The continuous dependence of solutions on the initial data was ﬁrst proved in [BC1], in the
case of 2×2 systems. A construction valid for n×n was then given in [BCP]. These earlier
works rely on a technique based on linearization + homotopy. As a ﬁrst step, one estimates
the distance between a reference solution u and an inﬁnitesimal perturbation (see [B1,B4]).
This is achieved by constructing a Lyapunov functional %
Φ which is nonincreasing along all
solutions to a linearized system, describing the evolution of a ﬁrst-order perturbation (see
[B1,B4]). In a second step, to compare two solutions u,v, one constructs a one-parameter
family of solutions uθ connecting u with v. For each time t, the distance ∥u(t) −v(t)∥L1
can then be bounded in terms of the length of the curve t →uθ(t). A drawback of this
approach comes from the possible loss of regularity of the solutions uθ. In order to retain
the minimal regularity (piecewise Lipschitz continuity) required for the existence of tan-
gent vectors, in [BC1] and [BCP] various approximation and restarting procedures had to
be devised. These yield entirely rigorous proofs, but at the price of heavy technicalities.
An entirely different approach was introduced by Liu and Yang [LY2,LY3], deﬁning
a functional Φ(u,v) which is equivalent to the L1 distance and decreases along couples
of solutions of the hyperbolic system. In their construction, a key role is played by a new
entropy functional for genuinely nonlinear scalar ﬁelds, introduced in [LY1] and here illus-
trated in Figure 25. This approach was developed into its ﬁnal form in [BLY]. For solutions
generated by the Glimm scheme, an equivalent version of these estimates can be found
in [LY4]. Our proof of Theorem 5.1 follows [BLY] with some reﬁnements suggested by
Guerra. For yet another proof of continuous dependence, see [HLF] or [LF]. Further results
and references in this direction can be found in the monograph [B5].
All of the above results on continuous dependence rely on the assumption (H) of genuine
nonlinearity or linear degeneracy of each characteristic ﬁeld. If this condition fails, the
analysis becomes far more difﬁcult. For 2 × 2 systems, a proof was worked out by Ancona
and Marson [AM1]. More recently, the uniform Lipschitz continuous dependence on initial
data has been established in [BiB] for all n × n strictly hyperbolic systems, by a vanishing
viscosity approach.
6. Further properties of solutions
This ﬁnal section collects various results concerning the uniqueness and qualitative prop-
erties of entropy weak solutions. For the proofs we mainly refer to [B5].
6.1. Viscosity solutions and characterization of semigroup trajectories
We begin by reviewing some properties that characterize the weak solutions obtained as
limits of front tracking approximations. In [B3] the author introduced a deﬁnition of “vis-
cosity solution” for a system of conservation laws, based on local integral estimates. This
deﬁnition was fully validated only recently, when in [BiB] it was proved that these viscos-
ity solutions actually coincide with the limits of vanishing viscosity approximations. These
results will now be brieﬂy described.

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
153
In connection with the hyperbolic system (4.1), we ﬁrst introduce some notations. Given
a function u = u(t,x) and a point (τ,ξ), we denote by U♯
(u;τ,ξ) the solution of the Riemann
problem with initial data
u(0,x) =

u−
if x < 0,
u+
if x > 0,
(6.1)
where
u−= lim
x→ξ−u(τ,x),
u+ = lim
x→ξ+u(τ,x).
(6.2)
Assuming that the two states u+,u−are sufﬁciently close, this solution was constructed
at (3.22).
In addition, we deﬁne U♭
(u;τ,ξ) as the solution of a linear hyperbolic Cauchy problem
with constant coefﬁcients:
wt + 
Awx = 0,
w(0,x) = u(τ,x),
(6.3)
with 
A .= Df (u(τ,ξ)). Observe that (6.3) is obtained from the quasilinear system
ut + A(u)ux = 0,
A(u) .= Df (u),
(6.4)
by “freezing” the coefﬁcients of the matrix A(u) at the point (τ,ξ) and choosing u(τ) as
initial data.
The notion of “viscosity solution” is now deﬁned by locally comparing a function u with
the self-similar solution of a Riemann problem and with the solution of a linear hyperbolic
system with constant coefﬁcients.
DEFINITION 6.1. A function u = u(t,x) is a viscosity solution of the system (4.1) if
t →u(t,·) is continuous as a map with values into L1
loc, and moreover, the following inte-
gral estimates hold.
(i) At every point (τ,ξ), for every β′ > 0, one has
lim

 ξ+β′h
ξ−β′h
u(τ + h, x) −U♯

dx = 0.
(6.5)
(ii) There exist constants C,β > 0 such that, for every τ ⩾0 and a < ξ < b, one has
limsup

dx
⩽C · Tot.Varu(τ); ]a,b[	2.
(6.6)
The next result shows that the viscosity solutions coincide precisely with the limits of
front tracking approximations.

154
A. Bressan
THEOREM 6.1 (Characterization of semigroup trajectories). Let S :D × [0,∞[→D be
the semigroup whose trajectories are the limits of front tracking approximations for the
system (4.1). A map t →u(t,·) taking values inside the domain D is a viscosity solution
of (4.1) if and only if it coincides with a semigroup trajectory, i.e.,
u(t) = Stu(0)
for all t ⩾0.
(6.7)
For a proof see [B5], p. 178.
Together with the hyperbolic system (4.1), consider the viscous approximations
uε
t + f (uε)x = εuε
xx.
(6.8)
Letting the viscosity parameter ε →0+, it is natural to expect that the viscous solutions uε
should converge to an entropy solution of the hyperbolic system (4.1). This long stand-
ing conjecture was indeed proved in [BiB]. We summarize here the main results in this
direction.
THEOREM 6.2 (Convergence of vanishing viscosity approximations). For every ε > 0 and
every initial data u(0) = ¯u with small total variation, the viscous solutions uε of (6.8) are
well deﬁned, for all t ⩾0. Their total variation remains uniformly bounded. Moreover,
letting ε →0, for each t ⩾0, one has
u(t) = lim
ε→0+uε(t) = St ¯u,
(6.9)
the convergence taking place in L1
loc. Indeed, the limit coincides with the unique solution
of the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2) obtained as limit of front tracking approximations.
6.2. Error estimates
According to Theorem 5.2, the hyperbolic system (4.1) generates a continuous semigroup
S :D ×[0,∞[→D, deﬁned on a domain D of functions with small total variation. Thanks
to the uniform Lipschitz continuity of the semigroup, error estimates for front tracking
approximations can be derived.
In the following, by an ε-approximate front tracking solution of the Cauchy problem
(4.1) and (4.2) we mean an approximation u = u(t,x) constructed as in Section 4, such
that: ∥u(0,·) −¯u∥L1 ⩽ε, each shock front satisﬁes the Rankine–Hugoniot and entropy
conditions, each rarefaction front has strength less than or equal to ε and the total strength
of all nonphysical fronts is less than or equal to ε.
THEOREM 6.3 (Error estimates for front tracking approximations). Let S :D ×
[0,∞[→D be the semigroup generated by the system (4.1) as in (5.72) and (5.73). For
some constant C, every ε-approximate front tracking solution u:[0,∞[→D satisﬁes
u(τ,·) −Sτ ¯u

L1 = Cε(1 + τ),
τ ⩾0.
(6.10)

To prove the theorem it now sufﬁces to show that, for some constant C′ independent of ε,
one has
lim
h→0+
∥u(t + h) −Shu(t)∥L1
h
⩽C′ε
(6.11)
at each time t > 0 where no wave-front interaction takes place. To ﬁx the ideas, let
u(t,·) have jumps at points x1 < ··· < xN. Call S the set of indices α ∈{1,...,N}
such that u(t,xα−) and u(t,xα+) are connected by a shock or by a contact discontinu-
ity. Moreover, call R the set of indices α corresponding to a rarefaction wave of a gen-
uinely nonlinear family. Finally, call NP the set of indices α corresponding to nonphysical
fronts.
For each α, call σα the strength of the jump at xα and let ωα(·) be the self-similar
solution of the Riemann problem with data u± = u(t, xα±). We observe that, for h > 0
small enough, the semigroup trajectory h →Shu(t) is a solution of (4.1), obtained by
piecing together the solutions of these Riemann problems (Figure 27). Choosing ρ > 0
suitably small, we can write

Indeed, along shocks the front tracking approximation is exact, while along rarefactions
the error is quadratic with respect to the front strength. The last estimate follows from the
deﬁnition of ε-approximate solution. This establishes (6.11), completing the proof.
□
For approximate solutions constructed by the Glimm scheme, the above approach does
not yield useful information, because of the additional errors introduced by the restarting
procedures at times tk .= kt. However, relying on a careful analysis of Liu [L1], one can

construct a front tracking approximate solution having the same initial and terminal values
as the Glimm solution. By this technique, in [BM] the authors proved the estimate
lim
x→0
∥uGlimm(τ,·) −uexact(τ,·)∥L1
√
x · |lnx|

(6.12)
for every τ ⩾0. In other words, letting the mesh sizes x,t →0 while keeping their
ratio x/t constant, the L1 norm of the error in the Glimm approximate solution tends
to zero at a rate slightly slower than
√
x.
6.3. Uniqueness of entropy weak solutions
For scalar conservation laws, a very general uniqueness and stability result was proved in
the fundamental paper of Kruzhkov [K]. In the case of n × n systems, under some mild
regularity assumptions, the uniqueness of entropy weak solutions with small total variation
has also been established. For sake of clarity, a complete set of assumptions is listed below.
(A1) (Conservation equations.) The function u = u(t,x) is a weak solution of the
Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2), taking values within the domain D of a semi-
group S. More precisely, u:[0,T ] →D is continuous with respect to the L1 dis-
tance. The initial condition (2.2) holds, together with
  uϕt + f (u)ϕx
	dx dt = 0
(6.13)
for every C1 function ϕ with compact support contained inside the open strip
]0,T [×R.

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
157
(A2) (Lax entropy condition.) Let u have an approximate jump discontinuity at some
point (τ,ξ) ∈]0,T [×R. More precisely, let there exists states u−,u+ ∈Ω and a
speed λ ∈R such that, calling
U(t,x) .=

u−
if x < λt,
u+
if x > λt,
(6.14)
there holds

r→0+

 r

u(τ + t, ξ + x) −U(t,x)
dx dt = 0.
(6.15)
Then, for some i ∈{1,...,n}, one has the inequalities
λi(u−) ⩾λ ⩾λi

u+	
.
(6.16)
(A3) (Tame oscillation condition.) For some constants C, β the following holds. For
every point x ∈R and every t,h > 0, one has
u(t + h,x) −u(t,x)
 ⩽C · Tot.Varu(t,·);[x −βh,x + βh].
(6.17)
(A4) (Bounded variation condition.) There exists δ > 0 such that, for every space-like
curve {t = τ(x)} with |dτ/dx| ⩽δ a.e., the function x →u(τ(x),x) has locally
bounded variation.
REMARK. The condition (A3) restricts the oscillation of the solution. An equivalent, more
intuitive formulation is the following. For some constant ˆλ larger than all characteristic
speeds, given any interval [a,b] and t ⩾0, the oscillation of u on the triangle (Figure 28)
△.= {(s,y):s ⩾t,a + β(s −t) < y < b −β(s −t)}, deﬁned as
Osc{u;△} .=
sup
(s,y),(s′,y′)∈△
u(s,y) −us′,y′	,
is bounded by a constant multiple of the total variation of u(t,·) on [a,b].
Fig. 28. Geometry of the regularity assumptions.

158
A. Bressan
The assumption (A4) simply requires that, for some ﬁxed δ > 0, the function u has
bounded variation along every space-like curve γ as in Figure 28, of the form {t =
τ(x);x ∈[a,b]} with slope ⩽δ, i.e., with
τ(x) −τx′	 ⩽δ
x −x′
for all x,x′ ∈[a,b].
One can prove that all of the above assumptions are satisﬁed by weak solutions obtained
as limits of front tracking approximations (see [B5], p. 85). The following result shows
that the entropy weak solution of the Cauchy problem (4.1) and (4.2) is unique within the
class of functions that satisfy either the additional regularity condition (A3) or (A4).
THEOREM 6.4 (Uniqueness of entropy weak solutions). Let the map u:[0,T ] →D be
continuous (with respect to the L1 distance), taking values in the domain of the semigroup
S generated by the system (2.1). If (A1), (A2) and (A3) hold, then
u(t,·) = St ¯u
for all t ∈[0,T ].
(6.18)
In particular, the weak solution that satisﬁes these conditions is unique. The same conclu-
sion holds if the assumption (A3) is replaced by (A4).
The proof relies on the error estimate

for almost every t ∈[0,T ]. For details we again refer to [B5], p. 188.
6.4. Qualitative structure of solutions
In the following we assume that every characteristic ﬁeld is genuinely nonlinear. All results
refer to solutions of (4.1) with small total variation, obtained as limits of front tracking
approximations.
THEOREM 6.5 (Local structure of solutions). Let u = u(t,x) be a solution of (1.1). Fix a
point (τ,ξ) and consider the rescaled functions
uη(t,x) .= u(τ + ηt,ξ + ηx),
η > 0.
(6.20)

Front tracking method for systems of conservation laws
159
Then, as η →0+, the functions uη converge in L1
loc for all t ∈R to a self-similar solution
˜u:R×R →Rn of (4.1). On the upper half plane {t ⩾0}, the function ˜u coincides with the
standard solution of the Riemann problem with data u−.= u(τ,ξ−) and u+ .= u(τ,ξ+).
On the lower half plane {t < 0}, ˜u contains only negative waves, i.e., shock waves and
centered compression waves.
A proof can be found in [BLF2].
THEOREM 6.6 (Global structure of solutions). Let u be a solution of the Cauchy prob-
lem (4.1) and (4.2) obtained as limit of front tracking approximations. Then there ex-
ists a countable set Θ .= {(tℓ,xℓ);ℓ⩾1} of interaction points and a countable family
of Lipschitz continuous curves (shocks or contact discontinuities) Γ .= {x = ym(t);t ∈
]am,bm[,m ⩾1} such that the following holds. For each m and each t ∈]am,bm[ with
(t,ym(t)) /∈Θ, there exist the derivative ˙ym(t) and the right and left limits

6.5. Notes
The deﬁnition of viscosity solution for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, based on
local integral estimates, was introduced in [B3]. In the same paper the author proved the
error estimate (6.10) for front tracking approximations, and the uniqueness of solutions ob-
tained as limits of Glimm approximations. The uniqueness results collected in Theorem 6.4
were obtained in [BLF1,BG] and [BLw]. The qualitative structure of solutions constructed
by the Glimm scheme was ﬁrst studied by DiPerna [DP2] and Liu [L4]. Theorem 6.5 was
proved in [BLF2], while Theorem 6.6 is taken from [B5]. A detailed analysis of the large
time asymptotic behavior of solutions can be found in the papers of Liu [L2,L3].

A.2. An elementary error estimate
Let D be a closed subset of a Banach space E and consider a Lipschitz continuous semi-
group S :D × [0,∞[→D. More precisely, assume that:
(i) S0u = u, SsStu = Ss+tu;
(ii) ∥Stu −Ssv∥⩽L · ∥u −v∥+ L′ · |t −s|.
Given a Lipschitz continuous map w :[0,T ] →D, we wish to estimate the difference
between w and the trajectory of the semigroup S starting at w(0).
THEOREM A.2. Let S :D × [0,∞[ →D be a continuous ﬂow satisfying the properties
(i) and (ii). For every Lipschitz continuous map w :[0,T ] →D, one then has the estimate
w(T ) −ST w(0)

Fig. 29. The basic error estimates.
REMARK 1. The integrand in (A.6) can be regarded as the instantaneous error rate for w
at time t. Since the ﬂow is uniformly Lipschitz continuous, during the time interval [t,T ]
this error is ampliﬁed at most by a factor L (see Figure 29).
PROOF OF THEOREM A.2. We ﬁrst show that the integrand function
φ(t) .= liminf
h→0+
∥w(t + h) −Shw(t)∥
h
is bounded and measurable. Indeed, for every h > 0, the function
φh(t) .= ∥w(t + h) −Shw(t)∥
h
(A.7)
is continuous. By the continuity of the maps h →φh(t), we have
φ(t) = lim
ε→0+
inf
h∈Q∩]0,ε]φh(t),
where the inﬁmum is taken only over rational values of h. Hence the function φ is Borel
measurable. Its boundedness is a consequence of the uniform Lipschitz continuity of w
and of all trajectories of the semigroup S.
Next, deﬁne
Φ(t) .=
ST −tw(t) −ST w(0)
,
(A.8)
z(t) .= Φ(t) −L
 t

φ(s)ds.
(A.9)
We need to show that z(T ) ⩽0. Since z is Lipschitz continuous and z(0) = 0, it sufﬁces to
show that the time derivative satisﬁes ˙z(s) ⩽0 for almost every s ∈[0,T ]. By the theorems
of Rademacher and of Lebesgue, there exists a null set N ⊂[0,T ] such that, for each

s /∈N , both functions z,Φ are differentiable at time s while φ is quasicontinuous at s. For
s /∈N we thus have
˙z(s) = lim
h→0
z(s + h) −z(s)
h
= lim
h→0
Φ(s + h) −Φ(s)
h
−L · φ(s).
(A.10)
By the deﬁnition of Φ and the properties of S it follows
Φ(s + h) −Φ(s) =
ST −s−hw(s + h) −ST w(0)
 −
ST −sw(s) −ST w(0)

⩽
ST −s−hw(s + h) −ST −sw(s)

⩽
ST −s−hw(s + h) −ST −s−hShw(s)

⩽L ·
w(s + h) −Shw(s)
.
Therefore
lim
h→0+
Φ(s + h) −Φ(s)
h
⩽L · liminf
h→0+
∥w(s + h) −Shw(s)∥
h
= L · φ(s).
By (A.10) this implies
˙z(s) ⩽0
for all s /∈N.
Hence, z(T ) ⩽0, proving the theorem.

A.3. Taylor estimates
This ﬁnal section contains some useful bounds on the size of a function Ψ of several vari-
ables, valid in a neighborhood of the origin. The assumption that Ψ vanishes on certain
sets, such as the coordinate axes or the diagonals, implies that some of the Taylor coefﬁ-
cients of Ψ at the origin are equal to zero. Writing a Taylor approximation and using this
additional information, one obtains the desired estimates. As usual, the Landau notation
O(1) here indicates a function whose absolute value remains uniformly bounded.
LEMMA A.1. Let Φ :Rm →Rn be differentiable with Lipschitz continuous derivative. If
Φ(0) = 0,
∂Φ
∂x (0) = 0,
(A.11)
then one has
Φ(x) = O(1) · |x|2.
(A.12)

163
LEMMA A.2. Let Φ :Rp × Rq →Rn be twice differentiable, with Lipschitz continuous
second derivatives. If
Φ(x,0) = Φ(0,y) = 0
for all x ∈Rp, y ∈Rq,
(A.13)
then
Φ(x,y) = O(1) · |x||y|
(A.14)
for all x,y in a neighborhood of the origin. If in addition there holds
∂2Φ
∂x ∂y (0,0) = 0,
(A.15)
then one has the sharper estimate
Φ(x,y) = O(1) · |x||y||x| + |y|	.
(A.16)
PROOF. Observe that (A.13) implies
Φ(x,y) =

This gives (A.14). If (A.15) also holds, then the Lipschitz continuity of the second deriva-
tive implies

∂2Φ

Using this bound inside the double integral in (A.17), we obtain (A.16).
□
LEMMA A.3. Let Φ = Φ(˜q,q∗,σ) be a C2 mapping from Rn−1 × R × R into R, with
Lipschitz continuous second derivatives. Assume that, for all ˜q ∈Rn−1, s,q∗,σ ∈R there
holds
Φ ˜q,q∗,0	 = Φ(0,s,−s) = Φ(0,0,σ) = 0.
(A.18)
Then one has the estimate

If, in addition, for all q∗,σ there holds
Φ

(A.20)
then one has
Φ

˜q,q∗,σ

˜q

(A.22)
By (A.18), for all ˜q,q∗one has
∂Φ
∂˜q

˜q,q∗,0
	
= 0.
Hence, by the Lipschitz continuity of the ﬁrst derivative,
∂Φ
∂˜q

˜q,q∗,σ
	
= O(1) · |σ|.
Using this last estimate we obtain

q∗+ σ
.
(A.24)
Observe that (A.18) implies
∂2Φ
∂q∗∂σ (0,0,0) = 0.
In the case where q∗and σ have the same sign, one has |q∗+ σ| = |q∗| + |σ|. There-
fore (A.24) follows from Lemma A.2, being equivalent to the estimate (A.16).
To see what happens when q∗and σ have opposite signs, to ﬁx the ideas assume q∗<
0 < σ, |q∗| < σ, the other cases being entirely similar. We consider two possibilities:
If |q∗| < σ/2, then
q∗+ σ
 ⩾|σ|
2 ⩾|q∗| + |σ|

and (A.24) again follows from (A.16) in Lemma A.2.
In the remaining case where σ/2 ⩽|q∗| ⩽σ, we write
Φ

This yields again (A.24), completing the proof of (A.19).
If the additional assumption (A.20) holds, then the estimate (A.21) is an immediate
consequence of (A.22) and (A.23).

REMARK 2. In the above lemmas, assume that the functions Φ and their derivatives de-
pend continuously on an additional parameter ω and satisfy the given assumptions for all
values of ω. Then all of the above estimates are still valid, for quantities O(1) which remain
uniformly bounded as ω ranges on compact sets.

Let Ω be an open set in RN and consider the quasilinear parabolic partial differential
equation of the second order

(1.1)p
Here T > 0 is given, ΩT = Ω × (0,T ) and ∇denotes the gradient with respect to the
space variables x = (x1,...,xN). The functions A = (A1,...,AN) and B are real valued,
measurable with respect to their arguments, and satisfying the structure conditions

(1.2)p
where C0 and C are given positive constants. The quantity C0|∇u|p−2 is the modulus of
ellipticity of the equation. If p > 2 it vanishes whenever |∇u| = 0 and the equation is said
to be degenerate at those (x,t) ∈ΩT , where this occurs. If 1 < p < 2 the modulus of
ellipticity becomes inﬁnity whenever |∇u| = 0 and the equation is said to be singular at
those (x,t) ∈ΩT , where |∇u| = 0.
Along with (1.1)p–(1.2)p, consider also the quasilinear equation,

where m is a given positive number. The prototype example of (1.1)m–(1.2)m is
ut −|u|m−1u = 0
for some m > 0,
(1.3)m
and the prototype example of (1.1)p–(1.2)p is
ut −div|∇u|p−2∇u = 0
for some p > 1.
(1.3)p
The ﬁrst is called the porous medium equation. If m > 1 the modulus of ellipticity van-
ishes for u = 0 and the equation is degenerate at those points of ΩT where the solution u
vanishes. If 0 < m < 1 the modulus of ellipticity is inﬁnity whenever u = 0 and the equa-
tion is singular at those points of ΩT where u = 0. If m > 1 the equation is referred to
as the slow diffusion case of the porous medium equation. The case 0 < m < 1 is the fast
diffusion.

172
E. DiBenedetto et al.
The equation in (1.3)p is the p-Laplacian equation and its modulus of ellipticity
is |∇u|p−2. If p > 2 such a modulus vanishes whenever |∇u| = 0 and at such points the
equation is degenerate. If 1 < p < 2 the modulus of ellipticity becomes inﬁnity whenever
|∇u| = 0 and the equation is singular at these points.
If m = 1 in (1.3)m or p = 2 in (1.3)p one recovers the classical heat equation for which
information are essentially encoded in the fundamental solution

The porous medium equation in (1.3)m admits an explicit similarity solution that “resem-
bles” the fundamental solution of the heat equation. Such a solution is called the Barenblatt
similarity solution and it is given by [17]

An examination of this solution reveals that it is well deﬁned for all positive values of m for
which λ > 0. One also veriﬁes that Γm →Γ as m →1. In this sense Γm is the fundamental
solution of the porous medium equation.
Also the p-Laplacian equation (1.3)p admits explicit similarity solutions,

This is well deﬁned for all p > 1 such that κ > 0 and Γp →Γ as p →2. In this sense,
Γp is the fundamental solution of the p-Laplacian equation.
Issues of compact support and regularity.
Assume ﬁrst m > 1 and p > 2. The ﬁrst differ-
ence between these fundamental solutions and the fundamental solution of the heat equa-
tion is in their support with respect to the space variables. For ﬁxed t > τ and y ∈RN,
the functions x →Γm(x),Γp(x) are compactly supported in RN, whereas x →Γ (x) is

positive in the whole RN. The moving boundaries separating the regions where Γm and Γp
are positive from the regions where they vanish are,
(t −τ)2/λ = γm|x −y|2
for Γm,
(t −τ)p/κ = γ p−1
p
|x −y|p
for Γp,
τ ∈R,y ∈RN ﬁxed.
The second difference is in their degree of regularity. For ﬁxed t > τ and y ∈RN, the
function x →Γm(x) is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent 1/(m −1). The function
x →Γp(x) is differentiable and its partial derivatives are Hölder continuous with Hölder
exponent 1/(p −2). Such a modest degree of regularity is in contrast to the fundamental
solution of the heat equation which is analytic in the space variables.
Let now 0 < m < 1 by keeping λ > 0. Then Γm is positive and locally analytic in the
whole RN × {t > τ}. Thus Γm seems to share the same properties as Γ .
If 1 < p < 2 by keeping κ > 0 then Γp is positive in the whole RN × {t > τ} but still it
maintains a limited degree of regularity.
Issues of Harnack inequalities.
Nonnegative, local solutions of the heat equation in ΩT
satisfy the Harnack inequality. This is a celebrated result of Hadamard [89] and Pini [144]
and it takes the following form. Fix (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and for ρ > 0 consider the ball Bρ(x0)
centered at x0 and with radius ρ and the cylindrical domain
Qρ(x0,t0) = Bρ(x0) × t0 −ρ2,t0 + ρ2	.
(1.5)
These are the parabolic cylinders associated with the heat equation and also to (1.3)m
since these equations remain unchanged under a similarity transformation of the space–
time variables that keeps constant the ratio |x|2/t.
There exists a constant C depending only upon N and independent of (x0,t0) and ρ,
such that
Cu(x0,t0) ⩾sup
Bρ(x0)
u

x0,t0 −ρ2	
provided
Q2ρ(x0,t0) ⊂ΩT .
(1.6)
The proof is based on local representations by means of the heat potentials (1.4). In partic-
ular, for ﬁxed τ ∈R and y ∈RN, the fundamental solution (x,t) →Γ (x,t) satisﬁes such a
Harnack estimate. It is then natural to ask whether the fundamental solution (1.4)m would
satisfy a Harnack estimate. Take for example the Γm for τ = 0 and y the origin of RN.
Assume ﬁrst that m > 1 and ﬁx (x0,t0) on the moving boundary, so that Γm(x0,t0) = 0. If
ρ and |x0| are sufﬁciently large, the ball Bρ(x0) intersects the support of Γm at t = t0 −ρ2.
Therefore for such choices the left-hand side of (1.6) is zero and the right-hand side would
be positive.
If 0 < m < 1 and λ > 0, take x0 = 0 and t0 > 4ρ2. Then a direct calculation shows
that (1.6) cannot be veriﬁed for a constant C independent of ρ and t0.

174
E. DiBenedetto et al.
Consider now (1.3)p and the corresponding Γp. The similarity rescaling that
keeps (1.3)p invariant is |x|p/t = const. Therefore the natural parabolic cylinders as-
sociated with (1.3)p are of the type
Qρ(x0,t0) = Bρ(x0) × t0 −ρp,t0 + ρp	.
(1.5)p
Similar arguments show that Γp does not satisfy the Harnack inequality for all p > 1 such
that κ > 0, even in its own natural parabolic geometry (1.5)p.
Local behavior of solutions.
These issues suggest a unifying theory of the local behavior
of weak solutions of degenerate or singular parabolic equations. A cornerstone of such a
unifying theory would be that weak solutions of (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p are Hölder continuous.
Another key component would be an understanding of the Harnack estimate in the de-
generate or singular setting of (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p. Whether, for example, there is a form
of such an estimate that replaces (1.6) and that would reduce to it when either m →1
or p →2. The general structure in (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p is not an artiﬁcial requirement. To
illustrate this point we return brieﬂy on the issue of regularity of solutions of (1.3)p. We
have observed that the space–gradient of the fundamental solution Γp, for p > 2, is locally
Hölder continuous in RN × (τ,∞). It is then natural to conjecture that the same would be
true for local solutions u of (1.3)p. For such solutions, it turns out that v = |∇u|2 formally
satisﬁes [55,165]
vt −aijv(p−2)/2vxi
	
xj ⩽0,
where aij = δij + (p −2)
uxiuxj
|∇u|2 .
This is a quasilinear version of (1.3)m with m = p/2. Thus an investigation of the local reg-
ularity of solutions of (1.3)p requires an understanding of degenerate or singular equations
with the general quasilinear structure (1.1)m and (1.2)m.
1.1. Historical background on regularity and Harnack estimates
Considerable progress was made in the early 1950s and mid 1960s in the theory of elliptic
equations, due to the discoveries of De Giorgi [47] and Moser [132,133]. Consider local
weak solutions of
(aijuxi)xj = 0
weakly in Ω,u ∈W 1,2
loc (Ω),
(1.7)
where the coefﬁcients x →aij(x),i,j = 1,2,...,N, are only bounded and measurable
and satisfying the ellipticity condition
ajiξiξj ⩾C0|ξ|2
a.e. in Ω ∀ξ ∈RN,for some C0 > 0.
(1.8)
De Giorgi established that local solutions are Hölder continuous and Moser proved that
nonnegative solutions satisfy the Harnack inequality. Such inequality can be used, in turn,

to prove the Hölder continuity of solutions. Both authors worked with linear PDEs. How-
ever the linearity has no bearing in the proofs. This permits an extension of these results to
elliptic quasilinear equations of the type
divA(x,u,∇u) + B(x,u,∇u) = 0
weakly in Ω;u ∈W 1,p
loc (Ω),p > 1,

(1.10)
for a given C0 > 0 and a given nonnegative constant C. By using the methods of De Giorgi,
Ladyzhenskaja and Ural’tzeva [121] established that weak solutions of (1.9)–(1.10) are
Hölder continuous, whereas Serrin [157] and Trudinger [163], following the methods of
Moser, proved that nonnegative solutions satisfy a Harnack principle. The generalization
is twofold, i.e., the principal part A(x,u,∇u) is permitted to have a nonlinear dependence
with respect to ∇u, and a nonlinear growth with respect to |∇u|. The latter is of particular
interest since the equation in (1.9) might be either degenerate or singular.
A striking result of Moser [134] is that the Harnack estimate (1.6) continues to hold for
nonnegative, local, weak solutions of

in ΩT ,
(1.11)
where aij ∈L∞(ΩT ) satisfy the analog of the ellipticity condition (1.8). As before, it
can be used to prove that weak solutions are locally Hölder continuous in ΩT . Since the
linearity of (1.11) is immaterial to the proof, one might expect, as in the elliptic case, an
extension of these results to quasilinear equations of the type
ut −divA(x,t,u,∇u) = B(x,t,u,∇u)
in ΩT ,
(1.12)
where the structure condition is as in (1.10). Surprisingly, however, Moser’s proof could
be extended only for the case p = 2, i.e., for equations whose principal part has a linear
growth with respect to |∇u|. This appears in the work of Aronson and Serrin [16] and
Trudinger [164]. The methods of De Giorgi also could not be extended. Ladyzhenskaja
et al. [120] proved that solutions of (1.12) are Hölder continuous, provided the principal
part has exactly a linear growth with respect to |∇u|. Analogous results were established
by Kruzkov [110–112] and by Nash [136] by entirely different methods. Thus it appears
that unlike the elliptic case, the degeneracy or singularity of the principal part plays a pe-
culiar role, and for example, for the p-Laplacian equation in (1.3)p one could not establish
whether nonnegative weak solutions satisfy the Harnack estimate or whether a solution is
locally Hölder continuous.
In the mid-1980, some progress was made in the theory of degenerate partial differential
equations (PDEs) of the type of (1.12), for p > 2. It was shown that the solutions are locally

176
E. DiBenedetto et al.
Hölder continuous (see [51]). Surprisingly, the same techniques can be suitably modiﬁed to
establish the local Hölder continuity of any local solution of quasilinear porous medium-
type equations. These modiﬁed methods in turn, are crucial in proving that weak solutions
of the p-Laplacian equation (1.3)p are of class C1,α
loc (ΩT ).
Therefore understanding the local structure of the solutions of (1.12) has implications to
the theory of equations with degeneracies quite different than (1.12).
In the early 1990s the theory was completed [37] by establishing that solutions
of (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p are Hölder continuous for all p > 1 and all m > 0. For a complete
account see [55].
1.2. A new approach to regularity
These results follow, one way or another, from a single unifying idea which we call intrinsic
rescaling. The diffusion processes in (1.3)m,p evolve in a time scale determined instant by
instant by the solution itself, so that, loosely speaking, they can be regarded as the heat
equation in their own intrinsic time-conﬁguration. A precise description of this fact as
well as its effectiveness is linked to its technical implementations which we will present in
Section 2.
The indicated regularity results assume the solutions to be locally or globally bounded.
A theory of boundedness of weak solutions of (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p is quite different from the
linear theory and it is presented in Section 3. For example, weak solutions of (1.1)p–(1.2)p
are locally bounded only if κ = N(p −2) + p > 0 and weak solutions of (1.1)m–(1.2)m
are locally bounded only if λ = N(m −1) + 2 > 0. It is shown by counterexamples that
these conditions are sharp.
The same notion of intrinsic rescaling is at the basis of a new notion of Harnack in-
equality for nonnegative solutions of (1.3)m,p established in the late 1980s and early
1990s [54,66]. Consider nonnegative weak solutions of (1.3)m for m > 1. The Harnack
inequality (1.6) continues to hold for such solutions provided the time is rescaled by the
quantity um−1(x0,t0). Similar statements hold for (1.3)p in their intrinsic parabolic geom-
etry (1.5)p. In Section 4 we present these intrinsic versions of the Harnack inequality and
trace their connection to the Hölder continuity of solutions.
A major open problem is to establish the Harnack estimate for nonnegative solutions
of (1.1)m,p with the full quasilinear structure (1.2)m,p. The proofs in [54,66] use in an
essential way the structure of (1.3)m,p as well as their corresponding fundamental solu-
tions Γm,p. The leap forward of Moser’s Harnack inequality was in bypassing the classical
approaches based on heat potentials, by introducing new harmonic analysis methods and
techniques. It is our belief that a proof of the intrinsic Harnack estimate for nonnegative
solutions of (1.1)m,p–(1.2)m,p that would bypass the potentials Γm,p, would have the same
impact.
The values of p > 1 for which nonnegative solutions of (1.3)p satisfy Harnack’s in-
equality are those for which κ = N(p −2) + p > 0. Likewise the values of m > 0 for
which nonnegative solutions of (1.3)m satisfy Harnack’s inequality are those for which
λ = N(m −1) + 2 > 0. These limitations are sharp for a Harnack estimate to hold (Sec-
tion 4).

177
1.3. Limiting cases and miscellanea remarks
The cases κ,λ ⩽0 are not well understood and form the object of current investigations.
The case 1 < p ⩽2N/(N + 1) seems to suggest questions similar to those of the limit-
ing Sobolev exponent for elliptic equations (see Brézis [30]) and questions in differential
geometry. As p ↘1, (1.3)p tends formally to a PDE of the type of motion by mean cur-
vature. Investigations in this directions are due to Evans and Spruck [79]. As m →0 the
porous medium equation (1.3)m for u ⩾0 tends to the singular equation
ut −lnu = 0
weakly in ΩT .
(1.13)
When N = 2 the Cauchy problem for this equation is related to the Ricci ﬂow as-
sociated to a complete metric in R2 [59,60,90,182]. A characterization of the initial
data for which (1.13) is solvable has been identiﬁed and the theory seems fairly com-
plete [46,59,78]. The case N ⩾3, however, is still not understood and while solvability has
been established for a rather large class of data [59], a precise characterization of such a
class still eludes the investigators.
Degenerate and singular elliptic and parabolic equations are one of the branches of mod-
ern analysis both in view of the physical signiﬁcance of the equations at hand [8,10,11,
91,92,113,114,119,126,127,161,183] and the novel analytical techniques that they gener-
ate [55].
The class of such equations is large, ranging from ﬂows by mean curvature to Monge–
Ampére equations to inﬁnity-Laplacian. These are implicitly degenerate or singular
equations in that the solution itself determines, implicitly, the regions of degeneracy. Ex-
plicitly degenerate equations would be those for which the degeneracy or singularity is a
priori prescribed in the coefﬁcients. For example if the modulus of ellipticity C0 in (1.8)
were a nonnegative function of x vanishing at some speciﬁed value x∗, such a point would
be a point of explicit degeneracy. There is a vast literature on all these aspects of degenerate
equations. We have chosen to present a subsection of the theory that has a unifying set of
techniques, issues, physical relevance, and future directions.
1.4. Singular equations of the Stefan-type
In this framework fall singular parabolic evolution equations where the singularity occurs
on the time-part of the operator. These take the form

u ∈Cloc

0,T ;W 1,2

β(u)t −divA(x,t,u,∇u) ∋B(x,t,u,∇u)
in D′(ΩT ),
(1.14)
where A and B have the same structure conditions as (1.2)m for m = 1 and β(·) is a
coercive, maximal monotone graph in R × R. The prototype example is
β(u)t −u ∋0
in D′(ΩT )
(1.15)

178

for a β(·) given by
β(s) =
s
for s < 0,
[0,1]
for s = 0,
1 + s
for s > 0.
(1.16)
Graphs β(·) such as this one, i.e., exhibiting a single jump at the origin, arise from a weak
formulation of the classical Stefan problem modeling a solid/liquid phase transition such
as water–ice. In the latter case a natural question would be to ask whether the transition of
phase occurs with a continuous temperature across water/ice interface. This issue, raised
initially by Oleinik in the 1950s and reported in the book [120] is at the origin of the
modern and current theory of local regularity and local behavior of solutions of degenerate
and/or singular evolution equations. The coercivity of β(·) for a solution to be continuous
is essential, as pointed out by examples and counterexamples in [63].
It was established in [31,48,149,150,184] that for β(·) exhibiting a single jump, the
solutions of (1.14) are continuous with a given quantitative modulus of continuity (not
Hölder). This raises naturally the question of a graph β(·) exhibiting multiple jumps and or
singularities of other nature (Section 5). For these rather general graphs, in the mid 1990s
it was established in [72] that solutions of (1.14) are continuous provided N = 2. For
dimension N ⩾3 the same conclusion holds provided the principal part of the differential
equation is exactly the Laplacian, as in the ﬁrst of (1.15). Several recent investigations have
extended and improved these results for speciﬁc graphs [86,87]. It is still an open question
however, whether solutions of (1.14) with its full quasilinear structure and for a general
coercive maximal monotone graph β(·) and for N ⩾3, are continuous in their domain of
deﬁnition.
1.5. Outline of these notes
The issues touched on here will be expanded in the next sections. We will provide precise
statements and self-sufﬁcient structure of proofs.
In Section 2 we deal with the question of the regularity of the weak solutions of singular
and degenerate quasilinear parabolic equations, proving their Hölder character. We start
with the precise deﬁnition of weak solution and the derivation of the building blocks of the
theory: the local energy and logarithmic estimates. In Section 2.2 we brieﬂy present the
classical approach of De Giorgi to uniformly elliptic equations. We introduce De Giorgi’s
class and show that functions in De Giorgi’s class are Hölder continuous. The two main
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 deal, respectively, with the degenerate and the singular case. There
we present in full detail the idea of intrinsic scaling and, at least in the degenerate case,
prove all the results leading to the Hölder continuity. We have decided to present the theory
for the model case of the p-Laplace equation to bring to light what is really essential in
the method, leaving aside technical reﬁnements needed to deal with more general equa-
tions. We close the section with remarks on the possible generalizations, namely to porous
medium type equations.
Section 3 addresses the boundedness of weak solutions. The theory discriminates be-
tween the degenerate and the singular case. If p > 2, a local bound for the solution is

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
179
implicit in the notion of weak solution. If 1 < p < 2, local or global solutions need not be
bounded in general.
In Section 4, we ﬁrst give a review about classical results concerning Harnack inequali-
ties. Then we consider the degenerate case and we point out the differences with respect to
the nondegenerate one. We sketch a proof of the Harnack inequality both in the degenerate
and singular case. We show that for positive solutions of the singular p-Laplace equation
an “elliptic” Harnack inequality holds. We also analyze the phenomenon of the extinction
of the solution in ﬁnite time. Through a suitable use of the Raleigh quotient, we are also
able to give sharp estimates on the extinction time and to describe the asymptotic proﬁle of
the extinction. In the whole section we point out the major open questions about Harnack
inequalities for singular and degenerate parabolic equations.
In Section 5 we give physical motivations concerning Stefan-like equations and show,
through the Kruzkov–Sukorjanskitransformation, the deep links between degenerate equa-
tions and Stefan-like equations. Then, we describe the approaches made by Aronson,
Caffarelli, DiBenedetto, Sachs and Ziemer in the 1980s. Thanks to their contributions the
case of only one singularity was completely solved. Lastly we analyze the new pioneering
approach of [72] where, through a lemma of measure theory, the case of multiple singu-
larities was totally solved in the case N = 2. Moreover, we show that this approach also
works in the case N ⩾3 but only under strong assumptions. In this section we also point
out the major open questions.
We have chosen not to present existence theorems for boundary value problems asso-
ciated with these equations. Theorems of this kind are mostly based on Galerkin approxi-
mations and appear in the literature in a variety of forms. We refer, for example, to [120]
or [123]. Given the a priori estimates presented here these can be obtained alternatively
by a limiting process in a family of approximating problems and an application of Minty’s
lemma.
These notes can be ideally divided in three parts:
1. Hölder continuity and boundedness of solutions (Sections 2 and 3).
2. Harnack-type estimates (Section 4).
3. Stefan-like problems (Section 5).
These parts are technically linked but they are conceptually independent, in the sense
that they deal with issues that have developed in independent directions. We have attempted
to present them in such a way that they can be approached independently.
2. Regularity of weak solutions
We address the question of the regularity of weak solutions of singular and degenerate
parabolic equations by proving that they are Hölder continuous.
We will concentrate on quasilinear parabolic equations, with principal part in divergence
form, of the type
ut −div|∇u|p−2∇u = 0,
p > 1.
(2.1)

180
E. DiBenedetto et al.
If p > 2, the equation is degenerate in the space part, due to the vanishing of its modulus of
ellipticity |∇u|p−2 at points where |∇u| = 0. The singular case corresponds to 1 < p < 2:
the modulus of ellipticity becomes inﬁnity at points where |∇u| = 0.
The results in this section extend to a variety of equations and, in particular, to equations
with general principal parts satisfying appropriate structure assumptions and with lower-
order terms. We have chosen to present the results and the proofs for the particular model
case (2.1) to bring to light what we feel are the essential features of the theory. Remarks
on generalizations, which in some way or another correspond to more or less sophisticated
technical improvements, are made at the end of the section.
Results on the continuity of solutions at a point consist basically in constructing a se-
quence of nested and shrinking cylinders with vertex at that point, such that the essential
oscillation of the function in those cylinders converges to zero when the cylinders shrink to
zero. At the basis of the proof is an iteration technique, that is a reﬁnement of the technique
by De Giorgi and Moser (cf. [47,120,132]), based on energy (also known as Cacciopolli)
and logarithmic estimates for the solution, that we brieﬂy review in Section 2.2. In the
degenerate or singular cases these estimates are not homogeneous in the sense that they
involve integral norms corresponding to different powers, namely the powers 2 and p. The
key idea is then to look at the equation in its own geometry, i.e., in a geometry dictated by
its intrinsic structure. This amounts to rescale the standard parabolic cylinders by a factor
that depends on the oscillation of the solution. This procedure, which can be called accom-
modation of the degeneracy, allows one to recover the homogeneity in the energy estimates
written over these rescaled cylinders. We can say heuristically that the equation behaves
in its own geometry like the heat equation. In the sequel, we ﬁrst treat the degenerate case
in Section 2.3 and then the more involved singular case in Section 2.4. We conclude the
section with some remarks on generalizations, namely to porous medium-type equations.

a modest degree of time-regularity and in general ut has a meaning only in the sense of
distributions. To overcome this limitation we introduce the Steklov average of a function

We will show that locally bounded solutions of (2.1) are locally Hölder continuous
within their domain of deﬁnition. No speciﬁc boundary or initial values need to be
prescribed for u. Although the arguments below are of local nature, to simplify the pre-
sentation we assume that u is a.e. deﬁned and bounded in ΩT and set
M ≡∥u∥L∞(ΩT ).
See Section 3 for results on the boundedness of weak solutions.
2.1.1. Local energy and logarithmic estimates.
Given a point x0 ∈RN, denote by Kρ(x0)
the N-dimensional cube with centre at x0 and wedge 2ρ:
Kρ(x0) :=

x ∈RN : max
1⩽i⩽N |xi −x0i| < ρ

,
given a point (x0,t0) ∈RN+1, the cylinder of radius ρ and height τ > 0 is
(x0,t0) + Q(τ,ρ) := Kρ(x0) × (t0 −τ,t0).
Consider a cylinder (x0,t0) + Q(τ,ρ) ⊂ΩT and let 0 ⩽ζ ⩽1 be a piecewise smooth
cutoff function in (x0,t0) + Q(τ,ρ) such that
|∇ζ| < ∞
and
ζ(x,t) = 0,
x /∈Kρ(x0).
(2.4)
We start with the energy estimates. Without loss of generality, we will state them for
cylinders with “vertex” at the origin (0,0), the changes being obvious for cylinders with
“vertex” at a generic (x0,t0).

2.1.2. Some technical tools.
We gather a few technical facts that, although marginal to
the theory, are essential in establishing its main results.
Given a continuous function v : Ω →R and two real numbers k < l, we deﬁne
[v > l] ≡

x ∈Ω: v(x) > l

,
[v < k] ≡

x ∈Ω: v(x) < k

,
[k < v < l] ≡

x ∈Ω: k < v(x) < l

.
(2.7)
LEMMA 1 (De Giorgi [47]). Let v ∈W 1,1(Bρ(x0)) ∩C(Bρ(x0)), with ρ > 0 and x0 ∈RN
and k < l ∈R. There exists a constant C, depending only on N and p (so independent of
ρ, x0, v, k and l), such that
(l −k)
[v > l]
 ⩽C ρN+1
|[v < k]|

[k<v<l]
|∇v|dx.
REMARK 1. The conclusion of the lemma remains valid, provided Ω is convex, for func-
tions v ∈W 1,1(Ω) ∩C(Ω). We will use it in the case Ω is a cube. In fact, the continuity
is not essential for the result to hold. For a function merely in v ∈W 1,1(Ω), we deﬁne
the sets (2.7) through any representative in the equivalence class. It can be shown that the
conclusion of the lemma is independent of that choice.
The following lemma concerns the geometric convergence of sequences.
LEMMA 2. Let {Xn}, n = 0,1,2,..., be a sequence of positive real numbers satisfying
the recurrence relation
Xn+1 ⩽CbnX1+α

where C,b > 1 and α > 0 are given. If
X0 ⩽C−1/αb−1/α2,

With C or Cj we denote constants that depend only on N and p and that might be
different in different contexts.
2.2. The classical approach of De Giorgi
Results concerning the Hölder continuity of weak solutions u consist essentially in showing
that for every point (x0,t0) ∈ΩT we can ﬁnd a sequence of nested and shrinking cylinders
(x0,t0) + Q(τn,ρn) such that the essential oscillation of u in these cylinders approaches
zero as n →∞in a way that can be quantiﬁed.
The approach to regularity introduced by De Giorgi is based on the following embedding
theorem (see [47] for the elliptic case and [120] for the parabolic case):
PROPOSITION 3. Assume that u ∈L2
loc(0,T ;W 1,2
loc (Ω)) ∩W 1,2
loc (0,T ;L2
loc(Ω)) is locally
bounded and satisﬁes the Caccioppoli inequalities (2.5) with p = 2. Then u is locally
Hölder continuous, with the modulus of continuity depending only upon the data.
A solution of a nondegenerate parabolic equation with the full quasilinear structure sat-
isﬁes these inequalities. One uses the structure of the equation to prove the Caccioppoli
estimates for a solution u and this is the only role of the equation. Once such inequalities
are derived, the Hölder continuity of u is solely a consequence of (2.5) for p = 2.
Alternative approaches are in Kruzkov [110–112] and, through the use of the Harnack
inequality, in Moser [132,134], Trudinger [164], Aronson and Serrin [16] and, for equa-
tions in nondivergence form, in Krylov and Safonov [117].
Set Qr = Q(r2,r), ﬁx a point (x0,t0) ∈ΩT , and let ρ0 be the largest radius so that
(x0,t0) + Qρ0 is contained in ΩT . For a constant δ ∈(0,1), consider the sequence of
decreasing radii,
ρn = δnρ0,
n = 0,1,2,...,
(2.8)
and the family of nested shrinking cylinders, with the same “vertex”
(x0,t0) + Qρn,
n = 0,1,2,....

PROPOSITION 4. Let u satisfy the Caccioppoli inequalities (2.5) for p = 2. Then there
exist constants C > 1 and δ,η ∈(0, 1
2), that can be determined a priori only in terms of
the data, such that, for every (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and every n ∈N, at least one of the following
two inequalities holds

u ⩽μ+
n −ηωn,
(2.10)
essinf
(x0,t0)+Qρn+1
u ⩾μ−
n + ηωn.
(2.11)
A nontrivial proof can be found in [120]. This proposition can be interpreted as a weak
maximum principle. For example (2.10) asserts that the supremum of u over the cylinder
Qρn+1 is strictly less than the supremum of u over the larger coaxial cylinder Qρn. In other
words, the supremum of u over Qρn can only be achieved in the parabolic shell Qρn \Qρn+1
that can be considered as a sort of parabolic boundary of Qρn.
A consequence of such a weak maximum principle is:
PROPOSITION 5. Let u be as above. Then there exist constants C > 1 and δ,η ∈(0, 1
2),
that can be determined a priori only in terms of the data, such that, for every (x0,t0) ∈ΩT
and every n ∈N,
ωn+1 ⩽(1 −η)ωn.
(2.12)
This in turn implies that u is locally Hölder continuous in ΩT .
PROOF. Fix (x0,t0) ∈ΩT . Assume that (2.10) holds. By subtracting μ−
n+1 from the left-
hand side and μ−
n from the right-hand side,
ωn+1 = μ+
n+1 −μ−
n+1 ⩽μ+
n −μ−
n −ηωn = (1 −η)ωn.
If (2.11) holds one can argue in a similar way. By iteration,
ωn ⩽(1 −η)nω0
∀n ∈N.
(2.13)
The numbers η and δ are related by (1 −η) = δα and α = ln(1−η)
lnδ
∈(0,1). Therefore,
ωn ⩽ω0
ρn
ρ0
α
∀n ∈N.
(2.14)

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
187
Since (x0,t0) ∈ΩT is arbitrary, we conclude that u is locally Hölder continuous in ΩT
with exponent α.
□
REMARK 2. The cylinder (x0,t0) + Qρ0 must be contained in ΩT . Thus from (2.14) it
follows that the Hölder continuity can be claimed only within compact subsets of ΩT and
that the Hölder constant ω0ρ−α
0
deteriorates as (x0,t0) approaches the parabolic boundary
of ΩT .
2.3. The degenerate case p > 2
We go back to equation (2.1) and focus on the degenerate case p > 2. The energy and
logarithmic estimates of Section 2.1 are not homogeneous in the space and time parts due
to the presence of the power p ̸= 2. To go about this difﬁculty we will consider the equation
in a geometry dictated by its own structure, which is designed, roughly speaking, to restore
the homogeneity of the various parts of the Caccioppoli inequalities (2.5). This means that,
instead of the usual cylinders, we have to work in cylinders whose dimensions take the
degeneracy of the equation into account, in a process that we call intrinsic rescaling. Let
us make this idea precise.
2.3.1. The geometric setting and the alternative.
Consider R > 0 such that Q(R2,R) ⊂
ΩT , deﬁne
μ+ := esssup
Q(R2,R)
u,
μ−:= essinf
Q(R2,R)
u,
ω := essosc

and construct the cylinder
Qa0Rp,R	 ≡KR(0) × −a0Rp,0	
with a0 =
 ω
2λ
2−p
,
(2.15)
where λ > 1 is to be ﬁxed later depending only on the data (see (2.55)). Note that for
p = 2, i.e., in the nondegenerate case, these are the standard parabolic cylinders reﬂecting
the natural homogeneity between the space and time variables.
We will assume, without loss of generality, that
R < ω
2λ
(2.16)
because if this does not hold there is nothing to prove since the oscillation is comparable
to the radius.
Now, (2.16) implies the inclusion
Q

a0Rp,R
	
⊂Q

R2,R
	

188
E. DiBenedetto et al.
and the relation
essosc
Q(a0Rp,R)u ⩽ω,
(2.17)
which will be the starting point of an iteration process that leads to our main results. Note
that we had to consider the cylinder Q(R2,R) and assume (2.16), so that (2.17) would
hold for the rescaled cylinder Q(a0Rp,R). This is in general not true for a given cylinder
since its dimensions would have to be intrinsically deﬁned in terms of the essential oscil-
lation of the function within it – the stretching procedure is commonly referred to as an
accommodation of the degeneracy.
We now consider subcylinders of Q(a0Rp,R) of the form

0,t∗	
+ Q

dRp,R
	
with d =
ω
2
2−p
(2.18)
that are contained in Q(a0Rp,R) if

2p−2 −2λ(p−2)	 Rp
ωp−2 < t∗< 0.
(2.19)
The proof now follows from the analysis of two complementary cases. We brieﬂy de-
scribe them in the following way: in the ﬁrst case we assume that there is a cylinder of
the type (0,t∗) + Q(dRp,R) where u is essentially away from its inﬁmum. We show that
going down to a smaller cylinder the oscillation decreases by a small factor that we can ex-
hibit. If that cylinder cannot be found then u is essentially away from its supremum in all
cylinders of that type and we can compound this information to reach the same conclusion
as in the previous case. We state this in a precise way.
For a constant ν0 ∈(0,1), that will be determined depending only on the data, we will
assume that either:
The ﬁrst alternative.
There is a cylinder of the type (0,t∗) + Q(dRp,R) for which
|{(x,t) ∈(0,t∗) + Q(dRp,R): u(x,t) < μ−+ ω/2}|
|Q(dRp,R)|
⩽ν0
(2.20)
or
The second alternative.
For every cylinder of the type (0,t∗) + Q(dRp,R),
|{(x,t) ∈(0,t∗) + Q(dRp,R): u(x,t) > μ+ −ω/2}|
|Q(dRp,R)|
< 1 −ν0.

the function u(x,−ˆt ) is strictly above the level μ−+ ω

this time level as an initial condition to make the conclusion hold up to t = 0. As an
intermediate step we need the following lemma.
LEMMA 4. Assume (2.20) holds for some t∗as in (2.19) and that (2.16) is in force. Given

Assume now that the second alternative (2.21)
holds true. We will show that a conclusion similar to (2.38) can be reached. Recall that
the constant ν0 has already been quantitatively determined by (2.27), and it is ﬁxed. We
continue to assume that (2.16) is in force.

REMARK 3. Observe that the choice of λ was made so that (2.44) holds, and a larger λ
is admissible. Choosing λ determines the length of the cylinder Q(a0Rp,R), since a0 =
(ω/2λ)2−p. The proposition has a double scope: we determine a level μ+ −ω/2λ+1 and
a cylinder (ﬁxing λ and consequently a0) such that the conclusion holds in that particular
cylinder.

REMARK 4. The proof of Proposition 9 shows that it would have been sufﬁcient to work
with a number ω and a cylinder Q(a0Rp,R) linked by (2.17). This relation is in general not
veriﬁable a priori for a given cylinder, since its dimensions would have to be intrinsically
deﬁned in terms of the essential oscillation of u within it.
The role of having introduced the cylinder Q(R2,R) and having assumed (2.16) is
that (2.17) holds true for the constructed box Q(a0Rp,R). It is part of the proof of Propo-
sition 9 to show that, at each step, the cylinders Qn and the essential oscillation of u within
them satisfy the intrinsic geometry dictated by (2.17).
LEMMA 7. There exist constants γ > 1 and α ∈(0,1), that can be determined a priori in
terms of the data, such that, for all the cylinders

with 0 < ρ ⩽R,
essosc
Q(a0ρp,ρ)u ⩽γ ω

PROOF. Let 0 < ρ ⩽R be ﬁxed. There exists a nonnegative integer n such that
C−(n+1)R ⩽ρ ⩽C−nR.
So, putting α = −lnσ
lnC , we deduce
C−(n+1) ⩽ρ

⇐⇒

Thus

To conclude the proof, observe that the cylinder Q(a0ρp,ρ) is contained in the cylinder
Qn ≡Q(anRp

THEOREM 2. Let u be a bounded local weak solution of (2.1) in ΩT and M = ∥u∥∞,ΩT .
Then u is locally Hölder continuous in ΩT , i.e., there exist constants γ > 1 and α ∈(0,1),
depending only upon the data, such that, for every compact subset K of ΩT ,
u(x1,t1) −u(x2,t2)
 ⩽γ M

p −dist(K;Γ )
α
for every pair of points (xi,ti) ∈K, i = 1,2.
PROOF. Fix (xi,ti) ∈K, i = 1,2, such that t2 > t1 and construct the cylinder (x2,t2) +
Q(M2−pRp,R) ⊂ΩT . This is realized if we choose
R ⩽
inf
x∈K,y∈∂Ω |x −y|
and
M(2−p)/pR ⩽inf
t∈K t1/p.
Thus, in particular, we may choose
2R = p −dist(K;Γ ).
To prove the Hölder continuity in the t-variable assume ﬁrst that (t2−t1) < M2−pRp. Then
there exists ρ ∈(0,R) such that (t2 −t1) = M2−pρp, i.e., ρ = M(p−2)/p|t2 −t1|1/p. The
oscillation inequality of Lemma 7, applied in the cylinder (x2,t2) + Q(a0ρp,ρ) implies
u(x2,t2) −u(x2,t1)

The Hölder continuity in the space variables is proved analogously.
□
REMARK 5. The theory extends to full quasilinear equations and includes statements of
regularity up to the parabolic boundary of ΩT (see [55]).
2.4. The singular case 1 < p < 2
We now turn to the singular case 1 < p < 2, still for the model equation
ut −div|∇u|p−2∇u = 0,
1 < p < 2.
(2.59)
The analysis for this case is somehow more involved, but several of the previous techniques
apply. As before the Hölder continuity of u will be solely a consequence of the Caccioppoli

210

inequalities (2.5) and the logarithmic inequalities (2.6). Throughout this section the func-
tion u is merely assumed to satisfy such inequalities. To avoid repetition of arguments, we
will outline the approach to regularity emphasizing the main differences with respect to the
degenerate situation.
A key point is again the choice of the appropriate intrinsic geometry in which to carry
the iteration argument. Fix a point (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and, as before, assume (x0,t0) = (0,0).
Consider a cylinder
BRp/2(0) × −Rp,0	 ≡QRp,Rp/2	 ⊂ΩT ,
where R > 0 is taken such that the inclusion holds. Now, let

with c0 =

(p−2)/p
,
(2.60)
where λ is to be determined only in terms of the data (we use the same letter as in the case
p > 2 but the λ’s are different in the two cases).
To start the iteration, we assume
 ω

and

(2.62)
Cylinders of the type (2.60) have the space variables stretched by a factor (ω/2λ)(p−2)/p
which is intrinsically determined by the solution. Note that, if p = 2, these are just the
standard parabolic cylinders. The geometry chosen is not the only possible. We could have
introduced, for example, a scaling with different parameters in the space and the time
variables. Another possibility would be to work with a scaling formally identical to the one
used in the degenerate case. Our option here was dictated only by a matter of simplicity.
The main result leading to the Hölder continuity of solutions is the following proposi-
tion.

PROPOSITION 10. There exist constants η ∈(0,1) and C,λ > 1, that can be determined

This proposition implies an analogue to Lemma 7 from which the Hölder continuity
follows as in the proof of Theorem 2.
The proof of the proposition is, as in the degenerate case, based on the analysis of an
alternative. To begin, consider inside of Q(Rp,c0R) subcylinders of smaller size
(¯x,0) + Q

Rp,d0R
	
,
d0 =

(p−2)/p

(2.63)

ω
2
(p−2)/p
R = L0d0R
(2.64)
for L0 = (2λ−1)(2−p)/p −1.
We can regard these cylinders as boxes moving inside Q(Rp,c0R) as the coordinates ¯x
of their centers range over the cube KR(ω). We may arrange L0 to be an integer and con-
sider the cube Kc0R as the union, up to a set of measure zero, of LN
0 disjoint cubes each
of them congruent to Kd0R. Analogously, Q(Rp,c0R) is the disjoint union, up to a set
of measure zero, of LN
0 open boxes each congruent to Q(Rp,d0R). Then we can view
(¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R) as the blocks of a partition of Q(Rp,c0R) (see [55], Figure 3.1,
p. 82).
Let ν0 ∈(0,1); then either
The ﬁrst alternative.
There exists a cylinder of the type (¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R) for which
|{(x,t) ∈(¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R): u(x,t) < μ−+ ω/2}|
|Q(Rp,d0R)|
⩽ν0
(2.65)
or

212
E. DiBenedetto et al.
The second alternative.
For every cylinder of the type (¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R),
|{(x,t) ∈(¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R): u(x,t) < μ−+ ω/2}|
|Q(Rp,d0R)|
> ν0.
(2.66)
In both cases, we will conclude that the essential oscillation of u within a smaller cylin-
der, centered at the origin, decreases in a way that can be quantitatively measured.
2.4.1. Rescaled iterations.
The study of both alternatives makes crucial use of a rescaled
iteration technique which applies to any subcylinder of ΩT . Let m > 0 be given by
m = m1 + m2,
where m1 ⩾1 and m2 ⩾0,
and consider the cube

REMARK 6. Note that, for (¯x, ¯t ) = (0,0), m1 = λ and m2 = 0, the cylinder (¯x, ¯t ) +
QR(m1,m2) coincides with the cylinder Q(Rp,c0R). Analogously, if m2 = 0, m1 = 1
and ¯t = 0 then, for a suitable choice of ¯x, the cylinder (¯x, ¯t ) + QR(m1,m2) coincides with
one of the boxes (¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R) making up the partition of Q(Rp,c0R).

Assume that there exists a cylinder of the type (¯x,0) +
Q(Rp,d0R), making up the partition of Q(Rp,c0R), for which (2.65) holds. Applying

As a consequence we may rephrase the ﬁrst alternative in the following way.

making up the partition of Q(Rp,c0R). There exists a positive number s1 that can be

To prove Proposition 11 we regard ¯x as the center of a larger cube ¯x + K8c0R which we
may assume to be contained in KRp/2. Otherwise we would have

This contains Q((R/8)p,c0R), regardless of the location of ¯x in the cube KR(ω).

which maps (¯x,0) + Q((R/2)p,8c0R) into Q4 ≡K4 × (−4p,0), and the new unknown
function

(2.72)
Denoting again with x and t the new variables, the function v satisﬁes the PDE

We regard Q(h0) as a thin cylinder sitting at the center of Q4. We prove that the relative
largeness of v in Q(h0) spreads sidewise over Q2 ≡K2 × (−2p,0), thus obtaining the
desired result. Indeed, we want to show that

Proposition 11 will then be a consequence of the following lemma.
LEMMA 9. For every ν ∈(0,1), there exists a positive number δ∗∈(0,1), that can be
determined a priori only in terms of ν, N, p and the data, such that

x ∈K2: v(x,t) ⩽δ∗ ⩽ν|K2|
(2.76)
for all time levels t ∈[−2p,0].
REMARK 9. The key feature of the lemma is that the set where v is small can be made
arbitrarily small for every time level in [−2p,0].
The proof of this lemma is rather technical, involving the manipulation of appropriate
integral inequalities, and will be omitted; the interested reader is referred to the book [55],
Chapter IV, Sections 6–9, for a detailed proof.
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 11 ASSUMING LEMMA 9. Let ν0 be the number claimed by
Lemma 8, take ν = ν0 in Lemma 9 and determine the corresponding δ∗= δ∗(ν0). Let
m2 be deﬁned by

as long as they are contained in Q2, i.e., for ¯t satisfying

for all ¯t ∈(2m2(p−2)2p −2p,0). Since

we conclude that

□
REMARK 10. We comment further on the expansion of positivity of Proposition 11. A cru-
cial point in the proof of Lemma 9 (which was omitted) is the use of the information
contained in (2.74) and (2.75) to apply a Poincaré inequality. But for this it is not truly
necessary to know that the set {v ⩾1

it sufﬁces to have the following information:

2.4.3. The second alternative.
We will omit most of the proofs in this section; for the
details see [55].

of Q(Rp,c0R). Since

we can rephrase (2.66) as
|{(x,t) ∈(¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R): u(x,t) > μ+ −ω

|Q(Rp,d0R)|
⩽1 −ν0
(2.77)
for all boxes (¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R) making up the partition of Q(Rp,c0R).
Let n be a positive number to be chosen and arrange that 2n(2−p)/p is an integer. Then
we combine 2(n(2−p)/p)N of these cylinders to form boxes congruent to

We next consider cylinders of the type (˜x,0) + Q(Rp,d∗R). These are contained in
Q(Rp,c0R) if the abscissa ˜x of their vertices ranges over the cube KR1(ω), where

We will take λ > n + 1 and arrange that L1 is an integer. Then we regard Q(Rp,c0R) as
the union, up to a set of measure zero, of LN
1 pairwise disjoint boxes each congruent to
Q(Rp,d∗R). Since each box (˜x,0) + Q(Rp,d∗R) is the pairwise disjoint union of boxes
(¯x,0) + Q(Rp,d0R), each of them satisfying (2.77), we can rephrase again (2.66), this
time as
|{(x,t) ∈(˜x,0) + Q(Rp,d∗R): u(x,t) > μ+ −ω/2}|
|Q(Rp,d∗R)|
⩽1 −ν0
(2.79)
for all cylinders (˜x,0) + Q(Rp,d∗R) making up the partition of Q(Rp,c0R).
REMARK 11. The need of introducing a larger cylinder than the one involved in (2.66) is
justiﬁed by the appearance of the factor 2n(2−p) in the logarithmic estimates (2.6) employed
in the proofs. The use of a geometry in which the space dimensions are stretched by this
factor accommodates the singularity and restores the homogeneity in (2.5) and (2.6).

The next lemma asserts that a property similar to (2.80) still holds for all time levels
from t∗up to 0. The proof of the lemma, that we omit, will also determine the number n.

The information of Lemma 11 will be exploited to show that in a small cylinder
about (0,0), the solution u is strictly bounded above by
μ+ −ω
2m
for some m > n + 1.
The process also determines the number λ which deﬁnes the size of Q(Rp,c0R). To make
this quantitative consider the box

E. DiBenedetto et al.
We view Q(βRp,c0R) as being partitioned into subboxes (˜x,0) + Q(βRp,d∗R), where
˜x takes ﬁnitely many points within the cube KR1(ω). For each of these cylinders Lemma 11
holds.
LEMMA 12. For every ν ∈(0,1), there exists a number m, depending only on the data
and independent of ω and R, such that, for all cylinders (˜x,0) + Q(βRp,d∗R) making up
the partition of Q(βRp,c0R),

(2.82)
REMARK 12. The proof shows that m must be chosen so that
m ⩾n + 1 +
C
νp/(p−1) .
This estimate deteriorates as p ↘1, i.e., m ↗∞as p ↘1. Nevertheless the choice of m
is stable as p ↗2.
To proceed we return to the box Q(βRp,c0R) and recall that it is the ﬁnite union, up
to a set of measure zero, of pairwise disjoint boxes (˜x,0) + Q(βRp,d∗R). Therefore,
Lemma 12 implies the following:

(2.83)
We ﬁnally determine the size of the cylinder Q(βRp,c0R) and consequently the num-
ber λ. First, in Corollary 5, take ν = ν0 and determine m accordingly. Then let m2 be given
by
β = ν0
2 = 2m2(p−2)
(2.84)
and assume that m ⩾m2 (if necessary take m even larger). Determine λ from
λ = m1
and
m = m1 + m2.
(2.85)
With these choices, the cylinder Q(βRp,c0R) coincides with the cylinder QR(m1,m2)
introduced in (2.67). By Corollary 5, we have

The process can now be repeated inductively starting from such relation. This yields the
Hölder continuity of u as in the degenerate case p > 2.
2.5. The porous medium equation and other generalizations
As indicated earlier, the Hölder continuity of u is solely a consequence of the Caccioppoli
inequalities (2.5) and the logarithmic inequalities (2.6). For this reason the techniques just
presented are rather ﬂexible and adjust to a variety of singular and degenerate parabolic
partial differential equations. The ﬁrst generalization we want to mention is to equations
with the full p-Laplacian type quasilinear structure
ut −diva(x,t,u,∇u) = b(x,t,u,∇u)
in D′(ΩT ),
(2.89)
where a :ΩT × RN+1 →RN and b :ΩT × RN+1 →R are measurable and satisfy the
structure assumptions:
(A1) a(x,t,u,∇u) · ∇u ⩾C0|∇u|p −ϕ0(x,t);
(A2) |a(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C1|∇u|p−1 + ϕ1(x,t);
(A3) |b(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C2|∇u|p + ϕ2(x,t),
for p > 1 and a.e. (x,t) ∈ΩT . The Ci, i = 0,1,2, are given positive constants and the ϕi,
i = 0,1,2, are given nonnegative functions, deﬁned in ΩT and subject to the integrability
conditions
ϕ0,ϕp/(p−1)

,ϕ2 ∈Lq,r(ΩT )
with q,r ⩾1 satisfying
1
r + N
pq ∈(0,1),
1 < p ⩽N.
See [55] for the details.
Another family of equations to which the theory applies are degenerate or singular
equations of porous medium type that can be cast in the form (2.89), for the structure
assumptions:
(B1) a(x,t,u,∇u) · ∇u ⩾C0|u|m−1|∇u|2 −ϕ0(x,t),m > 0;
(B2) |a(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C1|u|m−1|∇u| + ϕ1(x,t);
(B3) |b(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C2|∇|u|m|2 + ϕ2(x,t),

and the functions ϕi, i = 0,1,2, satisfy the same conditions as before with p = 2. We
require
u ∈L∞

and

There is a wide literature concerning this problem. We refer the reader to the Proceed-
ings [12,29,82,94], as well as the references therein.
Further generalizations can be obtained by replacing sm−1, s > 0, with a function that
blows up like a power when s ↘0 and is regular otherwise. To be speciﬁc, consider doubly
degenerate equations of the form (2.89) with structure assumptions:
(C1) a(x,t,u,∇u) · ∇u ⩾C0Φ(|u|)|∇u|p −ϕ0(x,t);
(C2) |a(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C1Φ(|u|)|∇u|p−1 + Φ1/p(u)ϕ1(x,t);
(C3) |b(x,t,u,∇u)| ⩽C2Φ(|u|)|∇u|p + ϕ2(x,t).
Here ϕi, i = 0,1,2, satisfy the same conditions as before and the function Φ(·) is degen-
erate near the origin in the sense that
∃σ > 0:
γ1sβ1 ⩽Φ(s) ⩽γ2sβ2
∀s ∈(0,σ),
for given constants 0 < γ1 ⩽γ2 and 0 ⩽β2 ⩽β1. For s > σ, i.e., away from zero it is
assumed that Φ is bounded above and below by given positive constants. We require that
u ∈Cloc

0,T ;L2
loc(Ω)
	
and
Φ1/(p−1)(u)|∇u| ∈Lp
loc(ΩT )
and, denoting with F(·) the primitive of Φ1/(p−1)(·), that
F(u) ∈Lp
loc

0,T ;W 1,p
loc (Ω)
	
,
which allows for an interpretation of the equation in the weak sense. One recognizes that if
Φ(s) ≡1 the equation is of p-Laplacian type and if Φ(s) = sm−1 and p = 2 the equation
is of porous medium type. The Hölder continuity of solutions was obtained independently
in [96] and [147].
3. Boundedness of weak solutions
The regularity theorems of the previous section apply to bounded weak solutions of (2.1).
The theory of local boundedness discriminates between the degenerate case p > 2 and the
singular case 1 < p < 2. If p > 2, a local bound for the solution is implicit in the notion
of weak solution. If 1 < p < 2, local or global solutions need not be bounded in general.

The following weak maximum principle is common to both cases.

In the next sections we let u be a nonnegative weak subsolution of (2.1) and will state
several upper bounds for it. The assumption that u is nonnegative is not essential and is
used here only to deduce that u is locally or globally bounded. If u is a subsolution, not
necessarily bounded below, our results supply a priori bounds above for u. Analogous
statements hold for nonpositive local supersolutions and in particular for solutions.
3.1. The degenerate case p > 2
THEOREM 5. Let p > 2. Every nonnegative, local weak subsolution u of (2.1) in ΩT is
locally bounded in ΩT . Moreover, for all ε ∈(0,2], there exists a constant γ depending
only upon N,p,Λ and ε, such that, ∀(x0,t0) + Q(τ,ρ) ⊂ΩT and ∀σ ∈(0,1),

REMARK 13. In the linear case p = 2 and τ = ρ2 such an estimate holds for any positive

It is of interest to have sup-estimates that involve “low” integral norms of the solution.
The next theorem is a result in this direction.

3.1.1. Global estimates for solutions of the Dirichlet problem.
Consider a nonnegative
weak subsolution of the Dirichlet problem (3.1) and let p > 2. If the boundary data are
bounded then the weak maximum principle of Theorem 3 holds true. If, however, u+
0 is not
bounded, it is of interest to investigate how the supremum of u behaves when t →0.
THEOREM 7. Let u be a nonnegative weak subsolution of the Dirichlet problem (3.1).

Results of this kind could be used to construct solutions of the Dirichlet problem with
initial data in L1(Ω) or even ﬁnite measures. Indeed the regularity results of the previous
section supply the necessary compactness to pass to the limit in a sequence of approximat-
ing problems.
3.1.2. Estimates in ΣT .
Consider a nonnegative weak subsolution u of the Cauchy prob-
lem (3.2) in the whole strip ΣT . By this we mean that u is a local weak subsolution of the
PDE in (3.2) in ΩT for every bounded domain Ω ⊂RN. To derive global sup-estimates, we
must impose some control on the behavior of u as |x| →∞. We assume that the quantity
|||u|||{r,t} ≡sup

Bρ
u(x,s)
ρλ/(p−2) dx,
λ = N(p −2) + p,

is ﬁnite for some r > 0 and for all t ∈(0,T ). This assumption is not restrictive. It is shown
in [64] that it is necessary and sufﬁcient for a nonnegative solution of (3.2) to exist in ΣT .
The subsolution u at hand, is not necessarily bounded. However, it is locally bounded
and as |x| →∞grows no faster that |x|p/(p−2). This is the content of the next theorem.

228
E. DiBenedetto et al.
THEOREM 8. Let u be a nonnegative subsolution of (3.2) in ΣT , and assume (3.3) holds.

Information of this kind are of interest in investigating the behavior of the solutions for t
near zero and in studying the structure of the nonnegative solutions in ΣT . In this estimate,
the functional dependence as t ↘0 is sharp as it can be veriﬁed from the explicit Barenblatt
solution (recall (1.4)p in the Introduction). The functional dependence as |x| →∞is also
optimal as it follows from the explicit solution

where A and T are two positive parameters.
3.2. The singular case 1 < p < 2
We will give below an example of a solution with p = 2N/(N + 1), that is unbounded.
Thus in the singular range 1 < p < 2, the boundedness of a weak solutions is not a purely
local fact and, if at all true, it must be deduced from some global information. One of them
is the weak maximum principle of Theorems 3 and 4. Another is a sufﬁciently high order
of integrability. A sharp sufﬁcient condition can be given in terms of the numbers
λr = N(p −2) + rp,
r ⩾1.
We assume that u satisﬁes
u ∈Lr
loc(ΩT )
for some r ⩾1 such that λr > 0.
(3.5)
The global information needed here is
u can be constructed as the weak limit in Lr
loc(ΩT ) of a
sequence of nonnegative bounded subsolutions of (2.1).
(3.6)
The notion of weak subsolution requires u to be in the class u ∈V 2,p
loc (ΩT ). This space
is embedded into Lq
loc(ΩT ), where q = p(N + 2)/N. Therefore if p is so close to one that
λq ⩽0, the order of integrability in (3.5) is not implicit in the notion of subsolution and
must be imposed.

A peculiar phenomenon of these equations is
that, unlike their degenerate counterparts, local and global estimates take essentially the

Next we return to (3.9) and observe that by the comparison principle u ⩾v and there-
fore u is not bounded.
4. Intrinsic Harnack estimates
In this section we present some results about Harnack inequalities. More precisely, we
consider nonnegative weak solutions of the type:

∩Lp


0,T ;W 1,p

,
p > 1,
ut −div|∇u|p−2∇u = 0
in ΩT .
(4.1)
The ﬁrst parabolic version of the Harnack inequality is due to Hadamard [89] and
Pini [144]. Their result is the following:
Let u be a nonnegativesolution of the heat equation in ΩT . Let (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and assume
that the cylinder (x0,t0) + Q2ρ ⊂ΩT , where Qρ ≡Bρ × (−ρ2,0). Then there exists a
constant γ , depending only upon N, such that
u(x0,t0) ⩾γ sup
Bρ(x0)
u

x,t0 −ρ2	
.
(4.2)
The proof is based on local representations by means of heat potentials. A breakthrough in
the theory is due to Moser, who in his celebrated paper [134] proved that (4.2) continues
to hold for nonnegative weak solution of the type

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations

with ν a positive constant. The result of Moser can be extended (see [16,163,164]) to
nonnegative weak solutions of the quasilinear parabolic equation
ut −diva(x,t,u,∇u) + b(x,t,u,∇u) = 0
in ΩT ,
(4.5)
where the diffusion ﬁeld a and the forcing term b are real valued and measurable over
ΩT × R × RN and satisfy the structure conditions considered in Section 2.4 for m = 1 or
for p = 2.
The proof of Moser’s result is based on suitable integral estimates for powers and log-
arithm of the solution u; the general structure follows the same one Moser used in his
earlier work on Harnack’s inequality in the elliptic case [133] and it is basically articulated
in three steps.
First Step (Estimates on positive powers of u).
Let u be a nonnegative solution; then for
all ε > 0 there exists a positive constant γ , depending only upon N and ε, such that, for
every cylinder Qρ(x0,t0) ⊂ΩT and for every σ ∈(0,1),
sup
Qσρ(x0,t0)
u ⩽

|Qρ(x0,t0)|
 
Qρ(x0,t0)

.
(4.6)
Let us remark that this estimate holds also for nonnegative subsolutions.
Second Step (Estimates on negative powers of u).
Let u be a positive solution; then, for
all ε > 0, there exists a positive constant γ , depending only upon N and ε, such that, for
every cylinder Qρ(x0,t0) ⊂ΩT and for every σ ∈(0,1),
sup
Qσρ(x0,t0)

u ⩽

|Qρ(x0,t0)|
 
Qρ(x0,t0)

uε dx dτ
1/ε
.
(4.7)
Quite analogously to what happened in the ﬁrst step, this estimate holds also for positive
supersolutions.
If we consider the mean values
M(p,D) =
 1
|D|
 
D
up dx dτ
1/p
,
it is obvious that (4.6) and (4.7) can be rewritten as
M(+∞,Qσρ) ⩽γ1M(ε,Qρ),
M(−ε,Qρ) ⩽γ2 M(−∞,Qσρ).

232
E. DiBenedetto et al.
The main point is then to establish a so-called “crossover inequality”, namely
M(p,D−) ⩽γ3M(−p,D+),
for sufﬁciently small p > 0 and appropriate domains D−,D+. Indeed this is the result of
the following:
Third Step (Crossover lemma).
Let u be a positive solution, D+ = {|x| < 1, 1
2 < t < 1}
and D+ = {|x| < 1,−1 < t < −1
2}. Then there exist constants δ > 0 and C > 0, depending
only on N, such that

D+
u−δ dx dτ

⩽C.
(4.8)
We stated (4.8) in a normalized form just for the sake of simplicity.
It is worth saying that the third step is the most difﬁcult part of Moser’s proof. Inequal-
ity (4.8) is a straightforward consequence of an adaptation to the parabolic case of the
well-known lemma of F. John and L. Nirenberg, which concerns the exponential decay
of the distribution function of a function with bounded mean oscillation. Going from the
elliptic to the parabolic situation the difﬁculty lies in the special role played by the time
variable. In fact as clearly stated in (4.2), the Harnack inequality for a nonnegative solu-
tion of a parabolic equation is an inf-bound on the value of such a solution at a given time
in terms of its value at a previous time and this necessary time lag has to be reﬂected in
a proper parabolic John–Nirenberg lemma. This is precisely what Moser did in his main
lemma in [134]. Indeed Moser’s proof is hard to follow and the need for a possible simpli-
ﬁcation was immediately felt.
Moser himself published a new proof of the Harnack inequality in 1971 (see [135]), with
the expressed purpose to avoid the use of his parabolic John–Nirenberg lemma; through
estimates on the logarithm of the solution and via a measure lemma based on a result
of Bombieri [27,28], he showed that it is possible to estimate in a quantitative way the
supremum of u. Repeating the same argument for u−1 one gets the quantitative estimates
for the inﬁmum of u. By combining these results the Harnack estimates are proved.
A few years later Fabes and Garofalo [80] came back to Moser’s main lemma and
gave a simpliﬁed proof, using Calderon’s proof of the original John–Nirenberg lemma,
see also [81].
In Moser’s approach the main feature that makes the method work is the homogeneity
of the time and space terms of the equation; in fact Trudinger ([164], Section 5) shows that
things run in the same way in the proof of the Harnack inequality for doubly nonlinear
equations of the type

up−1	
t −div

|∇u|p−2∇u
	
= 0
in ΩT ,
(4.9)
which is p-homogeneous, exactly as (4.3) is 2-homogeneous.
On the other hand, coming back to (4.1), quite surprisingly Moser’s method does not
work when p ̸= 2 and this is not simply a matter of technique. As already discussed in the

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
233
Introduction, as (4.1) is invariant by the scaling x →hx and t →hpt, one would guess
that Harnack estimates would hold in the cylinder [(x0,t0) + Bρ × (−ρp,0)], but this is
not the case. Let us consider the explicit solution of (4.1) introduced by Barenblatt in [17]:
B(x,t) = t−N/λ

1 −γp
 |x|
t1/λ
p/(p−1)(p−1)/(p−2)
+
,
t > 0,p > 2,
(4.10)
where γp = λ1/(1−p)(p −2)/p and λ = N(p −2) + p. Let (x0,t0) be a point of the free
boundary {t = |x|λ}. If t0 is large enough, the ball Bρ(x0) taken at the time level t0 −ρp
intersects the support of x →B(x,t0 −ρp) in an open set. Hence,
sup
Bρ(x0)
B

x,t0 −ρp	
> 0
and
B(x0,t0) = 0
which contradicts (4.2) and we conclude that things must be more complicated.
However, a comparison between (4.4) and (4.1) suggests that one may heuristically re-
gard (4.1) as if it were written in a time scale intrinsic to the solution itself and, loosely
speaking, of the order of t[u(x,t)]2−p. Indeed if one looks at the Barenblatt solutions
once more, one realizes that for such speciﬁc functions a Harnack estimate holds with an
intrinsic time scale exactly of the order u(x0,t0)2−p.
A general result of this kind for (4.1) is proved in [40,54,66]:
THEOREM 11. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.1) and let p > 2N/(N + 1).
Fix (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and assume that u(x0,t0) > 0. There exists constants γ > 1 and C > 0,
depending only upon N and p, such that
u(x0,t0) ⩽γ
inf
Bρ(x0)u(·,t0 + θ),
(4.11)
where
θ ≡
Cρp
[u(x0,t0)]p−2
(4.12)
provided that the cylinder (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (−4θ,4θ) is contained in ΩT .
In the next sections we will give a sketch of the proof both for the degenerate and sin-
gular cases. For the moment let us make some general remarks and point out some open
questions.
REMARK 15. There is a big difference between the degenerate case (p > 2) and the
singular case (p < 2) and this is due to the different behavior of the modulus of el-
lipticity |Du|p−2. In the degenerate situation the modulus vanishes when Du is zero;
hence, the evolution phenomenon dominates over the diffusion process and this holds
more and more as p grows to inﬁnity. We have a direct consequence in (4.11), as the

234
E. DiBenedetto et al.
constant C is larger than 1, when p > 2; moreover, C →∞as p →∞. Roughly speak-
ing the Harnack inequality states that the original positivity of u at (x0,t0) is spread over
the full ball Bρ(x0) and is preserved for a large time. On the other hand, when p →2+,
γ (N,p), C(N,p) →γ (N,2), C(N,2) so that, at least formally, we recover the classical
Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions of the heat equation. On the contrary, in the
singular case the modulus blows up when Du vanishes, so that now the previous situation
is reversed, the diffusion dominates over the evolution phenomenon and this is felt more
and more as p →(2N)/(N + 1). Once more we can see this clearly expressed in (4.11),
since C ∈(0,1) and C →0+ as p →(2N)/(N + 1): under a geometrical point of view,
we can say that the original positivity of u at (x0,t0) spreads over the full ball Bρ(x0) but
is now preserved only for a relatively small time. Exactly as in the degenerate case, when
p →2−, we have that γ (N,p),C(N,p) →γ (N,2),C(N,2), so that once again we re-
cover the classical results in the limit situation. Finally one may naturally ask about the
lower bound for p: why p > (2N)/(N + 1) and not just p > 1? Indeed p > (2N)/(N + 1)
is optimal for Harnack inequality to hold, as we will see in the next sections, discussing
the phenomenon of extinction in ﬁnite time.
REMARK 16. Let apart the intrinsic height of the cylinder, inequality (4.11) is obvi-
ously equivalent to (4.2). Let us just remark that in the case of parabolic equations in
nondivergence form, Krylov and Safonov gave to Harnack inequality exactly the same
formulation as in (4.11).
In Theorem 11 the level θ is deﬁned in terms of u(x0,t0) by (4.12). Notwithstanding
the previous discussion about the intrinsic scaling, it is natural to ask if an estimate holds
where the geometry can be a priori prescribed independent of the solution. In [54] a positive
answer is given when p > 2 by the following
THEOREM 12. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.1) and let p > 2. There exists
a constant B = B(N,p) > 1 such that,
∀(x0,t0) ∈ΩT ,∀ρ,θ > 0 s.t. (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (−4θ,4θ) ⊂ΩT ,

(4.13)
where λ = N(p −2) + p.
At ﬁrst glance Theorems 11 and 12 could look markedly different, as in the second one
the positivity of u(x0,t0) is not required and θ > 0 can be assumed arbitrarily. Indeed (4.13)
holds trivially when u(x0,t0) = 0 and both statements are equivalent when u(x0,t0) > 0 in
the sense that (4.11) ⇒(4.13) in any case and (4.13) ⇒(4.11) with a constant γ (N,p)
which may not be stable as p →2+.

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
235
Assuming u(x0,t0) > 0, let us prove the second implication. Under the hypothesis
that (4.13) is valid for all θ > 0 s.t. (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (−4θ,4θ) ⊂ΩT , if we choose
θ = (2B)p−2ρp
[u(x0,t0)]p−2 ,
we immediately conclude that
u(x0,t0) ⩽γ
inf
Bρ(x0)u(·,t0 + θ)
with γ = 2BN(p−2)+λ.
We postpone the proof of the opposite implication to the next section.
A consequence of Theorem 12 is the following:
COROLLARY 7. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.1) and let p > 2. There exists
a constant B = B(N,p) > 1 such that,
∀(x0,t0) ∈ΩT ,∀ρ,θ > 0 s.t. (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (−4θ,4θ) ⊂ΩT ,

In particular, Theorem 11 becomes:
THEOREM 13. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.15) and let m > (N −2)+/
(N + 2). Fix (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and assume that u(x0,t0) > 0. There exists constants γ > 1

The different behavior of the constant C dependent upon p > 2 or (2N)/(N + 1) <
p < 2 discussed in Remark 15 comes up in this context too, where the degenerate case is
given by m > 1 and the singular case by (N −2)+/(N + 2) < m < 1.
REMARK 17. Similar estimates have been proved also for the solutions of doubly nonlin-
ear parabolic equations of the type
ut = div

|∇u|p−2|u|m−1∇u
	
(see [177]). Equations of this type are classiﬁed as doubly nonlinear [123] or with implicit
nonlinearity [103]. This class of equations have their own mathematical interest (the porous
medium equation and the p-Laplacian equations belong to this larger class) and physical
interest (see the review paper [103]). Also for this larger class, local Hölder continuity
results hold (see [96,97,147,175]).
REMARK 18. The theory of Harnack estimates is fragmented and incomplete. The es-
timates for p ̸= 2 hold only for homogeneous PDEs and this strongly depends on the
method we will present in the following, which basically relies on the construction of spe-
cial solutions and subsolutions. The shortcoming of such a technique is evident even in the
framework of homogeneous equations since a Harnack-type estimate is not known to hold
for nonnegative weak solutions of (see [123])

The open question is if it is possible to extend the Harnack estimates to the case of
parabolic equations with the full quasilinear structure, as it happens when p = 2. Results
of this kind would probably require a new method independent of local representations and
local subsolutions. Whenever developed, such a technique would parallel the discovery of
the Moser estimates [134], based on real and harmonic analysis tools, versus the estimates
by Hadamard [89] and Pini [144], based on local representations.
4.1. Harnack estimates: the degenerate case
First of all, let us brieﬂy comment upon the assumption that the cylinder (x0,t0) + B4ρ ×
(−4θ,4θ) is contained in ΩT . Under a geometrical point of view, this means that t0 should
be of the order of θ and this is essential. In fact if we consider the Barenblatt solution
given in (4.10) with x0 = 0 and t0 arbitrarily close to the origin, it is evident that it cannot
satisfy (4.13). One might think that this is due to the pointwise nature of (4.12) and (4.13),
but this is not the case and the reason actually lies in the local character of the solutions we
are considering. Indeed quite surprisingly also the averaged form of the Harnack inequal-
ity (4.14) does not hold without the assumption that the cylinder (x0,t0)+B4ρ ×(−4θ,4θ)

is contained in ΩT . To see this, let u be the unique weak solution of the boundary value

2 and ρ = 1
4, for t > 1 we would have
1 ⩽const

→0
as t →+∞.
In the sequel we will see that the limitation on t0 in (4.14) can be dropped when (4.1) is
considered in the whole RN.
We can now ﬁnally come to the proof of Theorem 11 when p > 2. The technical tools
used in the proof are only two: the Hölder continuity of solutions as proved in Section 2 and
the comparison principle. This point of view is somehow reversed with respect to Moser’s
approach where the Hölder continuity is implied by the Harnack estimate. Even though not
so explicitly stated, a method similar to ours is already present in the work of Krylov and
Safonov [117].
We can basically recognize four steps.

238
E. DiBenedetto et al.
First Step (Renormalization of the solution).
Let (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and ρ > 0 be ﬁxed, as-
sume u(x0,t0) > 0 and consider the box
Q4ρ =

where C is a positive constant to be determined later. We render the equation dimensionless
by the change of variables
ξ = x −x0
ρ
,
τ = (t −t0)[u(x0,t0)]p−2
ρp
,
v =
u
u(x0,t0).
This maps Q4ρ into Q = Q+ ∪Q−, where Q+ ≡B(4)×[0,4C), Q−≡B(4)×(−4C,0].
We denote again the new variables with x and t and observe that the rescaled function v is
a bounded nonnegative solution of the equation
vt −div|∇v|p−2∇v = 0
in Q,
with v(0,0) = 1. To prove the Harnack inequality it is enough to ﬁnd constants 0 < γ0 < 1
and C > 1, depending only upon N and p, such that, for each x ∈B(1), we have
v(x,C) ⩾γ0.
(4.19)
As a matter of fact if u(x0,t0) = 0, no rescaling is possible and we are led to consider
Theorem 12, which is trivially satisﬁed in this case as already remarked.
Second Step (Determination of the largest value of v in Q−).
Construct the family of
nested boxes Qτ ≡Bτ ×(−τ p,0]. Deﬁne the numbers Mτ = supQτ v and Nτ = (1−τ)−β,
where β > 1 will be chosen later. Let 0 ⩽τ0 < 1 be the largest root of the equation
Mτ = Nτ . Such a root is well deﬁned, since M0 = N0 and as τ →1−Mτ remain bounded
and Nτ blow up. By construction supQτ v ⩽Nτ for all τ > τ0. Moreover, from the conti-
nuity of v in Q, there exists at least a point (x1,t1) ∈Nτ0, where v(x1,t1) = (1 −τ0)−β.
Third Step (Lower bound on v at the same time-level t1).
Relying on the Hölder con-
tinuity of v [51], we can determine a small ball of radius r0 about (x1,t1), where
v ⩾(1 −τ0)−β/2. Roughly speaking, we have found a small ball Br0(x1) at time t1, close
to (0,0), where the largeness of v(·,t1) is qualitatively determined. The proof is concluded
once we choose the constant β > 1 and C > 1 in such a way that we come up with a quanti-
tative lower bound on v over the full ball B1 at a later time C: otherwise stated, we have to
spread the positivity of v and this is the crucial step in the proof of the Harnack inequality.
Fourth Step (Expansion of the positivity set).
The spread of positivity is achieved by
means of a proper comparison function. For t ⩾t1 consider the function

where as usual λ = N(p −2) + p, S(t) = B(N,p)kp−2ρN(p−2)(t −t1) + ρλ, b(N,p) =
λ(p/(p −2))p−1 and choose k = (1 −τ0)−β/2 and ρ = r0. By direct calculation one ver-
iﬁes that Bk,ρ(x,t;x1,t1) is a weak solution of (4.1) in RN × {t1,t}. This comparison
function was introduced in [17,54,143].

REMARK 19. The constant γ0 tends to 0 as p →2+. Therefore in order to have the con-
stants under control as p approaches the nondegenerate case, a comparison function other
than Bk,ρ is used for p close to 2.
Once we have proved Theorem 11, we can show how it implies Theorem 12 and
therefore conclude about the equivalence between the two different Harnack estimates.
Let (x0,t0) ∈ΩT , ρ > 0 and θ > 0 be ﬁxed in such a way that the cylinder (x0,t0) +
B4ρ × (−4θ,4θ) is contained in ΩT . Without loss of generality we can assume that
(x0,t0) ≡(0,0) and set u∗= u(0,0). With C and γ as determined in Theorem 11, we
can assume that
t∗≡Cρp

otherwise there is nothing to prove. Relying on this and using the comparison principle

The assumption that the cylinder Q4ρ(θ) be contained in the domain of deﬁnition of
the solution is essential for the Harnack estimates of Theorems 11 and 12 to hold. When
the solution is deﬁned in RN any restriction on t0 can be avoided because we do not need
to impose any restriction on ρ to have that the cylinder Q4ρ(θ) belongs to the domain of
deﬁnition. More precisely, if we consider nonnegative weak solutions of the type

REMARK 20. Even if we are still dealing with local estimates as with the previous
Harnack inequalities, it is the switch from ΩT to ΣT that gives us a useful piece of global
information and allows us to get arbitrarily close to 0 with t0. Estimate (4.21) contains
information on the initial data of (4.20). Let x0 ∈RN, r > 0 and ε > 0. Apply (4.21) with
(t −t0) = T −ε, divide by ρp/(p−2) and take the supremum of both sides for ρ > r and
τ ∈(0,T −ε). In this way, one obtains that

The previous estimate implies that the nonnegative solutions of (4.21) are locally bounded
and, as |x| →+∞they cannot grow faster than |x|p/(p−2).
4.2. Harnack estimates: the singular case
The proof of the singular case is quite similar to the degenerate case, except for the last
part, relative to the spread of positivity. For the sake of completeness we recall all the steps.
First Step (Renormalization of the solution).
Let (x0,t0) ∈ΩT and ρ > 0 be ﬁxed, as-
sume u(x0,t0) > 0 and consider the box

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
241
This maps Q4ρ into Q = Q+ ∪Q−, where Q+ ≡B(4) × [0,4p), Q−≡B(4) × (−4p,0].
We denote again the new variables with x and t and observe that the rescaled function v is
a bounded nonnegative solution of the equation
vt −div|∇v|p−2∇v = 0
in Q,
with v(0,0) = 1. To prove the Harnack inequality it is enough to ﬁnd constants 0 < γ0 < 1
and 0 < C < 1, depending only upon N and p, such that, for each x ∈B(1), we have
v(x,C) ⩾γ0.
(4.23)
As a matter of fact if u(x0,t0) = 0, no rescaling is possible and we are led to consider the
elliptic-type Harnack inequality, we will discuss in the next section.
Second Step (Determination of the largest value of v in Q−).
Construct the family
of nested boxes Qτ ≡Bτ × (−δτ,0]. Deﬁne the numbers Mτ = supQτ v and Nτ =
(1 −τ)−p/(2−p), where 0 < δ < 1 will be chosen later and has the effect of making ﬂat
the boxes Qτ . If we compare the situation with the analogous one for p > 2, we notice
that the cylinders Qτ are rather thin in the t-variable and the exponent for Nτ is ﬁxed and
depends only on the singularity of the equation. Let 0 ⩽τ0 < 1 be the largest root of the
equation Mτ = Nτ . Such a root is well deﬁned, since M0 = N0 and as τ →1−Mτ remain
bounded and Nτ blow up. By construction
Mτ0 = (1 −τ0)−p/(2−p),
M(1−τ0)/2 ⩽2p/(2−p)(1 −τ0)−p/(2−p).
Moreover, from the continuity of v in Q, there exists at least a point (x1,t1) ∈Qτ0, where
v(x1,t1) = (1 −τ0)−p/(2−p) and
sup
|x−¯x|<(1−τ0)/2
v(x,t1) ⩽2p/(2−p)(1 −τ0)−p/(2−p).
Third Step (Lower bound on v at the same time-level t1).
Relying on the Hölder conti-
nuity of v, we can determine a small ball of radius r0 = ε(1 −τ0) about (x1,t1) where
v ⩾((1 −τ0)p/(p−2)/2). The variable ε is a small constant that tends to 0 as p →2−.
Fourth Step (Time-expansion of positivity).
All the previous arguments are independent
of the quantity δ and now it is ﬁxed. By means of a proper comparison function, the pos-
itivity of v is spread over a small time interval without modifying the space size of the
box we are working in. More precisely, it is proved that there exist small positive numbers
c0 and δ that can be determined a priori only in terms of N and p such that
v(x,t) ⩾c0(1 −τ0)p/(p−2)
∀|x −¯x| < ε(1 −τ0),∀δ ⩽t ⩽2δ.
This step (and the next one, too) is the main difference with respect to the degenerate
case when p > 2. Roughly speaking, in that case the positivity is spread over time and
space in one stroke. Here we need to proceed one step at a time.

242
E. DiBenedetto et al.
Fifth Step (Sidewise expansion of positivity).
Using a new comparison function the pos-
itivity of v is spread over the full ball {|x| < 1} at the time level t = 2δ. This is done by
showing that there exists a constant γ0 = γ0(N,p) such that
v(x,2δ) ⩾γ0
∀|x −¯x| < 2,
and with this we are ﬁnished.
REMARK 21. The comparison functions used in the proof were introduced in [5] and [66].
We also point out that the comparison principle is a consequence of L1-techniques if
ut ∈L1
loc(ΩT ). If ut does not belong to L1
loc(ΩT ) the comparison principle can be proved
adapting a technique introduced by Kalashnikov, Oleinik and Chzhou [104] (see also Ap-
pendix 9 of [66]).
REMARK 22. Exactly as in the degenerate case when p > 2, the constant γ0 tends to 0
as p →2−. Therefore in order to have the constants under control as p approaches the
nonsingular case, a different comparison function is used for p close to 2.
REMARK 23. In the singular case too, it is possible to state an integral Harnack inequality
that holds for all 1 < p < 2: Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.1). Then there
exists a constant γ , depending only upon N and p, such that, for all (x0,t0) ∈ΩT , for all
ρ > 0 such that B4ρ(x0) ⊂Ω and for all t > t0,

(4.24)
with λ = N(p −2) + p. Note that λ might be of either sign. Moreover, a very important
difference with respect to the degenerate case is that in the singular case the L1 norm of
u(·,t) over a ball bounds the L1 norm of u(·,τ) over a smaller ball for any previous or
later time. We stress out that in the nonsingular case it is only possible a control for later
times and NOT for previous times. Accordingly the constant γ deteriorates when p →2−.
4.3. Elliptic-type Harnack estimates and extinction time
In this section we focus our attention on what is peculiar of the case p < 2. As discussed
before, in the singular case, at the points where |∇u| = 0, the modulus of ellipticity be-
comes inﬁnite. Hence, roughly speaking, the elliptic nature of the diffusion dominates the
time-evolution of the process itself and this implies that the positivity of u at some point
(x0,t0) spreads at the same time level. We have already seen a hint of this property in the
ﬁfth step of the proof of Theorem 11 but such a feature can be made quantitatively precise
and assumes the form of an elliptic-type Harnack inequality, where the inﬁmum of u over
the ball Bρ(x0) is bound by the supremum over the same ball at the same time level:

THEOREM 15. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of (4.1) and let 2N/(N + 1) <
p < 2. Let (x0,t0) ∈ΩT , ρ > 0 and t0 > 0. Let θ = C[u(x0,t0)]2−pρp, where the con-
stant C is deﬁned in (4.12). Assume that the cylinder (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (t0 −4θ,t0 + 4θ) is
contained in ΩT . Then

where γ > 1 depends only upon N and p and γ →∞when either p →( 2N
N+1)+ or
p →2−.
This result is proved in [67]. See also [177] for the extension of such a result to more
general operators.
REMARK 24. Estimate (4.25) fails in the case of nonnegative solutions of the heat equa-
tion and also for nonnegative solutions of the p-Laplacian when p > 2. To verify this in
the case of the heat equation, consider the fundamental solution in one space dimension
Γ (x,t) =
1
(4πt)1/2 e−x2/(4t).
If Theorem 15 were to hold, we would have, for some ρ > 0, that Γ (n,1) ⩽Γ (n + ρ,1).
Letting n →∞we obtain a contradiction. That is the reason why the constants in (4.25)
deteriorate when p goes to 2.
The elliptic-like Harnack inequality holds also for the nonnegative solutions of the
porous medium equation. In such a case we get sharp estimates on the solution
THEOREM 16. Let u be a nonnegative weak solution of

(4.26)
and let ((N −2)+)/(N + 2) < m < 1. Let θ = C[u(x0,t0)]1−mρ2 where the constant C is
deﬁned in (4.12). Assume that the cylinder (x0,t0) + B4ρ × (t0 −4θ,t0 + 4θ) is contained
in ΩT . Then, for each multiindex α,
Dαu(x0,t0)

PROOF. We render the equation dimensionless by the change of variables
ξ = x −x0
ρ

τ = (t −t0)[u(x0,t0)]m−1

v =
u
u(x0,t0).
This maps Q4ρ into Q = Q+ ∪Q−, where Q+ ≡B(4)×[0,4C), Q−≡B(4)×(−4C,0].
We denote again the new variables with x and t and observe that the rescaled function v is
a bounded nonnegative solution of the equation
vt −vm	 = 0
in Q,
(4.29)
with v(0,0) = 1. By the integral Harnack inequality (4.24) and the elliptic-like Harnack
inequality (4.25) we have that there exist positive constants r0 and γ > 1, depending only
upon N and m, such that γ −1 ⩽v(x,t) ⩽γ for each (x,t) ∈Q(r2
0,r0). Using this new
piece of information, we have that in such a cylinder we can apply classical results due to
Friedman [83] and Kinderleher and Nirenberg [106] to the equation (4.29) to obtain the
analyticity of the solution. More precisely we get that, for each multiindex α,
Dαv(0,0)
 ⩽C|α|+1

and, for every nonnegative integer k,

∂k

where C > 1 depends only upon N and m.
By the reverse change of variables we deduce (4.27) and (4.28).
□
REMARK 25. Estimate (4.27) not only implies the analyticity of the solution in the space
variables but it also says that when the solution vanishes at a point then all the derivatives
vanish at the same point. Therefore, for the analyticity, the solution vanishes in all the
domain Ω whenever vanishes at a point of Ω. Estimate (4.27) fails in the case of nonnega-
tive solutions of the heat equation. Indeed, consider the fundamental solution in one space
dimension
Γ (x,t) =
1
(4πt)1/2 e−x2/(4t).
If (4.27) were to hold, we would have, for some C > 0,

Letting n →∞we obtain a contradiction.

REMARK 26. The previous estimates say that a bounded nonnegative solution of the
singular porous medium equation is analytic in the space variables and at least Lipschitz
continuous in the time variable. We stress that these estimates are optimal. Indeed let
z be the nonnegative and non trivial solution of the problem zxx =
1
1−mz1/m in the inter-
val (0,1), with boundary conditions z(0) = z(1) = 0. Then u(x,t) = z1/m(T −t)1/(1−m)

solves the equation ut = (um) and satisﬁes the above estimates sharply.
REMARK 27. These estimates hold also in the case of a class of quasilinear parabolic
equations. More precisely for nonnegative, local weak solutions of
ut = 

um	
+ f (x,t,u,∇u),
with (N −2)+/(N + 2) < m < 1, and f locally analytic and such that 0 ⩽f (x,t,
u,∇u) ⩽Fum for some positive constant F (see [67]).
Another peculiarity of the case p < 2 is that the solution can become extinct in a ﬁnite
time. The extinction proﬁle is deﬁned as the set ∂[u > 0] ∩[Ω × (0,∞)]. By the elliptic-
like Harnack principle the extinction proﬁle is a portion of the hyperplane Ω × {t = T ∗}.
Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a bounded domain.

(4.30)
Then there is a ﬁnite time T ∗, depending only upon N, p and u0, such that u(·,t) ≡0 for
all t ⩾T ∗.

REMARK 28. Note that there is an overlap in the range of p in the previous estimates. We

measure of Ω.

REMARK 29. The estimate (4.33) is stable as p →( 2N
N+1)+. As p →2−the boundary
value problem (4.30) tends to the corresponding boundary value problem for the heat equa-
tion, for which the extinction in ﬁnite time does not occur. Accordingly, if p →2−, the

The estimate (4.34) deteriorates as p →( 2N
N+1)−and is stable as p →1+. However, as
the regularity results of the previous sections deteriorate as p →1+, we cannot infer the
convergence of (4.30) to a boundary value problem in some reasonable topology.
REMARK 30. Theorem 17 holds for solutions of variable sign. The only modiﬁcation
occurs in the case 1 < p < 2N/(N + 1), N ⩾2. For this it is enough to work with the
testing functions |u|s−2u.
The Harnack principle gives also an estimate on the way the solution approaches the
extinction. Let M = ∥u∥∞,Ω∞, where Ω∞≡Ω × (0,∞).
THEOREM 18. Let Ω be a bounded domain of RN. Let u be the unique nonnegative weak
solution of (4.30) and let 2N/(N + 1) < p < 2. Then there exists a constant γ , depending

REMARK 31. Theorem 19 holds for solutions of variable sign and for data in Ls(RN) with
s = N 2−p
p . The only modiﬁcation in the proof occurs in making precise in what sense the
solutions of the approximated problems converge to the solution of (4.36).
REMARK 32. Theorem 19 implies that the range 2N/(N + 1) < p < 2 is optimal for a
Harnack estimate to hold. Let Σ∞≡RN × R+. Fix (x0,t0) ∈RN × (0,T ∗), where t0 is so
close to T ∗as to satisfy
T ∗−t0 ⩽C

is contained in Σ∞. If the Harnack inequality (4.11) were to hold for 1 < p < 2N/(N + 1),
N ⩾2, for some constants C and γ independent of ρ, it would give 0 < u(x0,t0) ⩽
γ infx∈Bρ(x0) u(x,T ∗) = 0. We stress that the choice (4.39) is possible in the whole Σ∞.

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
249
The same argument implies that no extinction in ﬁnite time can occur for solutions
of (4.36) if 2N/(N + 1) < p < 2. In such a range the Harnack estimate (4.11) holds
and if a ﬁnite extinction time T ∗were to exists, the choices (4.38) and (4.39) would give
u(x,T ∗) > 0.
4.4. Raleigh quotient and extinction proﬁle
The Harnack estimates play a fundamental role in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of
solutions of singular equations. The physical motivation of such an analysis comes from
the modeling of plasma assuming the Okuda–Dawson diffusion model (see [74,139], see
also [22,23]). In [118] and [67] this analysis was carried out through Sobolev embedding
theorem, Harnack estimates and Raleigh quotient (see also [155], where general singular
operators and general boundary conditions are considered). In this section this application
of Harnack inequalities is described.
Let Ω be a bounded set of RN. Consider the Cauchy–Dirichlet problem:

(4.40)
The main result of this section is the following:
THEOREM 20. Let u be the unique nonnegative weak solution of (4.40) and let T ∗> 0 be
the extinction time. Let u∗(x,t) = u(x,t)(T ∗−t)1/(p−2). Then there is a sequence tn →T ∗
such that u∗(x,t) →v(x), where v is a nontrivial solution of the equation
div|∇v|p−2∇v =
1
2 −p v
in Ω
(4.41)
satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
REMARK 33. The proof of Theorem 20 is heavily based upon the Sobolev embedding
of W 1,p into L2. For this reason we assume Ω bounded and 2N/(N + 1) < p < 2. If
p ⩽2N/(N + 1) the result is false. Indeed if the theorem were to hold for such a range
of p, it would give the existence of a nontrivial solution of (4.41) in contradiction with
known results of the elliptic theory (see [145]). We recall that the existence of a nonzero
solution of (4.41) when p ⩽2N/(N + 1) is not true in general, but depends on topological
properties of the set Ω (see, for instance, [30]).
Before coming to the actual proof of Theorem 20, we consider some auxiliary results.

From the previous calculations, this implies that wt(τn) →0 in Lp(Ω). Hence, we get that
there is a sequence tn →T ∗such that
u(·,tn)
(T ∗−tn) →v,
where v is the solution of (4.41). On the other hand, by Proposition 15, there are two
positive constants c1 and c2, such that, for each tn,

this convergence holds also in Cα( 

have that v satisﬁes (4.25).

REMARK 34. If the asymptotic proﬁle of the singular porous medium equation is con-

The approach through the Raleigh quotient can be applied also in the case of degenerate
parabolic equations using similar arguments (see [125]).
THEOREM 21. Let p > 2 and let u be the unique nonnegative weak solution of (4.40). Let
u∗(x,t) = u(x,t)t1/(2−p). Then there is a sequence tn →∞such that u∗(x,t) →w(x),
where w is a nontrivial solution of (4.41), satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions.
REMARK 35. In the literature there are several papers devoted to the study of the as-
ymptotic behavior of the solutions of the porous medium equation and the p-Laplacian
equation. Among them we quote [14,15,24,25,174]. In these papers the approach is differ-
ent from what we followed here. Indeed they ﬁrst study the elliptic equation (4.41), then
using some comparison principles they analyze the asymptotic behavior of the evolution
equation. With this approach things are somehow reversed: the basic properties of the evo-
lution equation allow for the study of the asymptotic behavior and the elliptic result follows
as a consequence.
REMARK 36. The proofs of Theorems 20 and 21 are based on Sobolev embedding and
weak convergence arguments. For this reason one can apply this approach also in the case
of initial data with variable sign and in the case of Neumann or mixed boundary condi-
tions [155].
5. Stefan-like problems
In this section we present some results about the local and global behavior of weak solution
of singular parabolic equations which model physical phenomena like transitions of phase
and/or the ﬂow of immiscible ﬂuids in a porous medium. More precisely, let us consider
parabolic inclusions of the type
∂
∂t β(u) −divA(x,t,u,∇u) + B(x,t,u,∇u) ∋0
in ΩT ,
(5.1)
where β is a maximal monotone graph in R × R. We assume the coerciveness of the
graph β(·), i.e., there exists a positive constant γ0 such that
β(s1) −β(s2) ⩾γ0(s1 −s2)
∀si ∈R.
(5.2)
We also assume that,
∀M > 0,
sup
−M⩽s⩽M
β(s)
 ≡γ1 < ∞.
(5.3)
We stress that we do not assume any further assumptions on the behavior of β(·). In partic-
ular, in any ﬁnite interval, the graph might exhibit inﬁnitely many jumps or become vertical

inﬁnitely many times with any possible growth (exponentially fast or faster). Examples of
such β(·) are
β(s) =

(5.5)
β(s) = |s|1/m signs,
m > 1,
(5.6)
or
β(s) = 1 + sα1 −(1 −s)α2,
(5.7)
where s ∈[0,1] and αi ∈[0,1].
Equation (5.4) describes the enthalpy function in the weak formulation of a Stefan-like
problem modeling a transition of phase, while (5.5) could be a good prototype to model
the behavior of the enthalpy in a double transition of phase. There is a wide literature
concerning the classical Stefan problem. For a summary of the main results we refer the
reader to the monographs of Meirmanov [129] and Visintin [178], the review papers by
Danilyuk [45], DiBenedetto [57] and by Visintin, Fasano, Magenes and Verdi [179], the
proceedings [29,82,94], as well as the references therein. Here, we consider only the as-
pects related to the local continuity of a weak solution. Equation (5.6) is the classical
porous medium equation, describing the ﬂow of a single ﬂuid in a porous matrix, that was
already mentioned in Section 2.5. Equation (5.7) is a ﬁrst approximation of the ﬂows of
two immiscible ﬂuids in a porous matrix. Once more this is a widely studied problem. For
instance, Van Duijn and Zhang [173] considered a one-dimensional model in hydrology
(see also [93] for an investigation from a numerical point of view). For multidimensional
multiphase models we refer the reader to the monographs [18,19,34,44,156] and to the
references therein.
The diffusion ﬁeld A and the forcing term B in (5.1) are real valued and measurable

In the sequel, when possible and for the sake of simplicity, we will work with the sim-
plest example of (5.1), i.e.,
∂
∂t β(u) −u ∋0,
in ΩT .
(5.17)
We will obviously point out the situations in which the claimed results hold only for this
simplest inclusion.
5.1. The continuity of weak solutions
It is quite natural to investigate if locally bounded weak solutions of (5.2) are continuous
and if their modulus of continuity can be estimated quantitatively. Let us state this more

256
E. DiBenedetto et al.
precisely. For the sake of simplicity, assume that u is a solution of (5.2) and that it is
bounded in ΩT . Set
∥u∥∞,ΩT = M.
(5.18)
We recall that this assumption is not restrictive if we deﬁne ΩT as the domain of deﬁnition
of u. In a similar way, we assume the following integrability assumption
φ0 + φ2
1 + φ2

¯q,¯r,ΩT = Φ.
(5.19)
We set the numbers
N,γi,M,Φ,μi,
i = 0,1,2,
as the data. Consequently, we say that a constant C = C(data) or a continuous function
ω(·) = ωdata(·) if they can be determined a priori only in term of the above parameters.
Let Θ ⊂⊂ΩT be an arbitrary subset. In the sequel we investigate the problem of the
continuity of u in Θ with a modulus of continuity ωdata(·) depending only upon the data
and the distance from Θ and the parabolic boundary of ΩT .
REMARK 37. If β(·) is the identity, we are in De Giorgi’s setting so any locally bounded
weak solution is Hölder continuous in ΩT . The assumptions (5.11)–(5.14) are optimal for
this result to hold (see, for instance, the monograph by Ladyzhenskaja, Solonnikov, and
Ural’tzeva [120], Chapters 1, 2 and 5). In this section we want to study how the singularity
of β affects the regularity of u.
REMARK 38. The assumption that u is bounded is essential. Even in the most favorable
case when β(·) is the identity, weak solutions need not to be bounded (even in the elliptic
case; see a counterexample by Stampacchia [159]). This is due to the critical growth of the
forcing term B(x,t,u,∇u) with respect to ∇u. We recall that in the nonsingular case, if
we assume that
B(x,t,u,∇u) ⩽μ2|∇u|q + φ2(x,t),
where 0 ⩽q < (N + 4)/(N + 2), instead of (5.10), then any weak solution is locally
bounded. This statement follows by means of a simple adaptation of the method of [120]
(see also [47] and [132]). Even when the solution is not necessarily locally bounded, if
one has some a priori qualitative knowledge of the boundedness of the solution such a
qualitative information can, in many cases, be turned into a quantitative one (see, for in-
stance, [26,141,176] and the references therein).
In the sequel we assume in addition that the solutions of (5.1) can be constructed as
the limit in the topology of (5.15) of a sequence of smooth local solutions of (5.1) with
smooth β(·). This assumption is made in order to justify some of the calculations and to
deal with equations instead of inclusions. We stress that the modulus of continuity of u

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
257
must be independent of any approximating procedure and must depend only upon the data.
Such a result gives us some compactness that, in many cases, is fundamental to obtain ex-
istence of a solution. Actually if one approximates the equation with a sequence of regular
ones, through the estimate of the modulus of continuity, one obtains that the approximat-
ing solutions are uniformly continuous. Then, via the Ascoli–Arzelá theorem one gets the
convergence in the uniform norm of a subsequence of approximating functions to a contin-
uous function v. Thus, in many cases, by applying the method exploited by Kinderlehrer
and Stampacchia [107] and based on Minty’s lemma [130], it is possible to prove that v is
a weak solution of the original equation.
Lastly we recall that if
B(x,t,u,∇u) ⩽μ2|∇u|q + φ2(x,t),
where 0 ⩽q < (N + 4)/(N + 2), the questions of existence and uniqueness are well
understood. We refer the readers to the monographs [84,120,123], to the proceed-
ings [29,82,94] and to the references therein.
5.2. A bridge between singular and degenerate equations
The understanding of the physical model requires the analysis of (5.1) in its full generality.
For instance, the ﬂow of two immiscible ﬂuids is described by a system of two parabolic
equations, written in terms of the saturations and pressures of the two ﬂuids (see, for in-
stance, Chapter 9 of [18], Chapter 6 of [19], Chapter 6 of [44], Chapter 10 of [156] and the
article by Leverett [122]). The transformation by Kruzkov and Sukorjanski [115] reduces
the above system of two equations to a system of a degenerate-elliptic equation in terms of
the mean pressure and a parabolic equation of the type
vt −diva(x,t,v,∇v) + b(x,t,v,∇v) = 0
in ΩT
(5.20)
in terms of the saturation v of only one of the two ﬂuids. In (5.20), the forcing term
b(x,t,v,∇v) depends essentially on the mean pressure.
The diffusion ﬁeld a and the forcing term b in (5.20) are real valued and measurable
over ΩT × R × RN and satisfy the structure conditions:
a(x,t,v, ¯v)
 ⩾φ

|v|
	
|¯v|2 −φ0(x,t),
(5.21)
a(x,t,v, ¯v)
 ⩽φ|v|	|¯v| −φ1(x,t)
(5.22)
and
b(x,t,v, ¯v)
 ⩽φ|v|	|¯v|2 −φ2(x,t),
(5.23)
where φ :R+ →R+ is a continuous function and φi,i = 0,1,2, are nonnegative and sat-
isfy assumptions (5.11) and (5.12).
As the function (x,t) →v(x,t) represents the local relative saturation of one of the two
ﬂuids (see, for instance, [5,18,19,44,115,156]), it is natural to assume it is bounded, for

258
E. DiBenedetto et al.
example v ∈[0,1]. The equation is degenerate because φ(·) is allowed to vanish. More
precisely we assume that
φ(v) > 0
∀v ∈[0,1],
φ(0) = φ(1) = 0.
(5.24)
Obviously v satisﬁes (5.20) in the weak sense deﬁned previously and we require that
∇

φ(v)
	
∈L2
loc(ΩT ).
(5.25)
The problem of proving the local continuity of the saturations was studied in [5,53,170],
for example. The continuity of the saturations comes from the continuity of the solution
of (5.20) arguing as in [5] and [53]. Proving the continuity of the solution is difﬁcult, not
only for the double degeneracy of φ(·), but also because of the lack of a precise quan-
titative and qualitative information on its modulus of continuity. Actually the function φ
is related to the permeability of both ﬂuids and the permeability vanishes as one ﬂuid is
totally replaced by the other one (that is, when v = 0 or v = 1); this is the physical origin
of the degeneracy of φ(·). The information on the rate of vanishing is limited because it
is derived only from hydrostatic experiments (see [18,19,44,156]), dimensional analysis
(see [122]) and heuristic arguments. As a matter of fact, such a limited information on the
nature of the degeneracy is typical of models of ﬂows of a mixture of ﬂuids in a porous
medium. Hence φ(·) could degenerate at v = 0 and v = 1 at different rates (exponentially
fast or faster). By the phenomenon of connate water it might be even completely ﬂat in a
small right neighborhood of 0 or in a small left neighborhood of 1 (see Chapter 9 of [18],
Chapter 2 of [44], Chapters 3 and 10 of [156]). So the problem of the continuity of weak
solutions of (5.20) consists in showing that v is continuous whatever the nature of the
degeneracy of φ(·) is.
Let u ∈[0,1] be a solution of (5.1) with β(·) ∈C1(0,1) and singular in 0 and 1. For
example assume
lim
u→0+ β′(u) = lim
u→1−β′(u) = +∞.
Then, by setting v = β(u) and φ(·) = β−1′(·), the singular equation (5.1) in terms of u is
re-casted as the degenerate equation (5.20) in terms of v. Moreover, all the assumptions on
a and b are satisﬁed. Vice versa, putting
u =
 v
0
φ(s)ds,
β(u) = v,
one gets the singular equation from the degenerate one. In this case, however, while the
assumptions on A are veriﬁed, the assumption on the free term B cannot be veriﬁed in the
case of a superlinear growth with respect to ∇v. We refer the reader to [5] for a detailed
technical analysis of this case.

5.3. Parabolic equations with one-point singularity
Let us consider the case where β(·) is singular at only one point (the prototype cases are
given by the examples (5.4) and (5.6)). The local continuity of the solutions was proved in
the papers [31,48,50,52,149,150,184]. However the situations of (5.4) and (5.6) are very
different; actually, for β(·) of the type (5.6) it is possible to repeat De Giorgi’s argument
(i.e., to ﬁnd suitable Caccioppoli and logarithmic estimates such that an embedding in the
space of Hölder continuous functions holds) while that procedure is impossible in the case
of (5.4). In this case, the Caccioppoli and logarithmic estimates are more complicated than
in the nonsingular case:
there exists a constant γ , only depending upon the data, such that, for each

(5.28)
Note that, for the sake of simplicity, we have written the above estimates only in the case
of the prototype equation (5.17).
If N = 2, the existence of the modulus of continuity can be derived from the above
estimates (see [72]). If N ⩾3 there are bounded discontinuous functions satisfying the
previous estimates (see [158]). So in order to prove the local continuity of the solutions
one has to use the structure of the parabolic equation. In [31,48,50,52,149,150,184] the
proof of continuity has this common point: assume that β(·) is singular only at a point,

260
E. DiBenedetto et al.
say, for example, at 0. Fix a cylinder (y,s) + Qρ. There are two possibilities: (i) either
the singularity occupies a small portion of such a cylinder (and in such a case it plays a
negligible role); or (ii) the singularity occupies a large portion. In such a situation, outside
the singular set, the evolution equation is uniformly parabolic so the solution remains close
to 0 because it cannot grow too fast due to the classical regularity properties of non singular
parabolic equations. This gives us a control on the oscillation of the solution and allows us
to obtain some recursive inequalities that will imply the local continuity. As it is absolutely
evident, the whole argument is based on the fact that β(·) has only a singularity. The proofs
of these recursive inequalities differ in [31,48,50,149,150,184]. In [31], the authors use
the local representation in terms of heat potentials (for this reason their approach works
only in the case of the prototype equation (5.17)). In [48] and [50], De Giorgi’s iterations
are used following the setting of [120]. The shrinking technique introduced by Krylov
and Safonov [117] is applied in [149] and [150]. As this method is genuinely based on
the nondivergence structure of the operator, also in this case the approach works only for
the prototype equation (5.17). Lastly in [184] the Harnack-type techniques of Moser are
applied, following the setting of [16,132,134,164].
The singularity of β(·) changes the iterative procedure of the nonsingular case. Actually
the singularity affects the sequence of the radii of the nested cylinders and the reduction of
the oscillation. More precisely, let
η,δ :(0,2M] →(0,1),
η(0),δ(0) = 0,
(5.29)

PROPOSITION 16. Let u be a weak solution of (5.1) with β(·) a graph of Stefan type (5.4).
Then there exist constants C > 1 and λ ∈(0,1), and two continuous functions δ(·) and η(·)
as in (5.29), that can be determined a priori only in terms of data, such that, for every
(x0,t0) ∈ΩT and every n ∈N,

u ⩽ωn,
(5.31)
where λ is a number determined only in terms of the integrability conditions (5.8)–(5.13)
and is independent of δ and η. As a consequence u is locally continuous in ΩT .
PROOF. For a detailed proof we refer the reader to [48]. Here we assume that (5.31) holds
so that to prove the proposition it is sufﬁcient to show that {ωn} →0 when n →∞. From

the deﬁnition, the sequences {ωn} and {ρn} are nonincreasing, so their limits exist when
n →∞. It is clear that limn→∞ρn = 0 because the function δ(·) ∈(0,1).
Now, assume that limn→∞ωn = ω∞> 0. Then

REMARK 39. The constants C and λ appearing in (5.30) are due only to the functions φi
appearing in the structure conditions (5.8)–(5.10),and they are zero for the prototype equa-
tion (5.17).
REMARK 40. With respect to the case of a uniformly parabolic equation, here the modulus
of continuity is not explicit but it can be derived quantitatively from (5.30). More precisely,
in [48], it is proved that δ(s),η(s) have the form K−h/s with K and h large constants, but
it is not obtained an explicit modulus of continuity for u in terms of K and h.
5.4. Parabolic equations with multiple singularities
Graphs β(·) that are singular at multiple points, besides their intrinsic mathematical
interest, arise naturally in phenomena of multiple transitions of phase. An example is a
water–ice–vapor triple point and another one is the Buckley–Leverett model of two im-
miscible ﬂuids in a porous medium (see the previous sections for more details about these
models).
The ﬁrst attempt to prove continuity results in such a setting was made in [5], where
some restrictions were made on the singularities. Actually, the authors considered the case
of the Buckley–Leverett model, i.e., the case of only two singularities. They assumed that
β(·) could be singular at any rate in one point, while in the second point the singularity
allowed was only of logarithmic type. This result was improved in [53], by allowing the
second singularity to have a power-like behavior, and in [170] where Hölder continuity
was proved assuming that both degeneracies are power-like. The alternative argument is
quite similar to the one of only one singularity. Let Qρ be the cylinder where we want
to reduce the oscillation of the solution. If the nonrestricted singularity occupies a small
portion of such a cylinder it means that it plays a negligible role and the continuity results
for porous medium equation hold. If the singularity occupies a large portion, outside the
singular set, the solution cannot grow too fast due to the regularity properties of porous
medium equations. This gives a control on the oscillation of the solution and allows one
to obtain some recursive inequalities that imply the local continuity. It is clear, however,
that any parabolic approach cannot face the case of two unrestricted singularities. In the
pioneering paper [72], the approach is based on the energy estimates and on some measure-
theoretical results. The results obtained in [72] are optimal in the case N = 2 and hold for
the prototype equation (5.17).
THEOREM 22. Let N = 2. Let u be a locally bounded weak solution of (5.1), where β(·) is
any maximal monotone graph satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3), and let the structure

262
E. DiBenedetto et al.
conditions (5.8)–(5.14) be satisﬁed. Then u is continuous in ΩT . Moreover, for every com-
pact subset K ⊂ΩT , there exists a continuous, nonnegative, increasing function
s →ωdata,K(s),
ωdata,K(0) = 0,
that can be determined a priori only in terms of the data and the distance from K to the
parabolic boundary of ΩT , such that

 ⩽ωdata,K

|x1 −x2| + |t1 −t2|1/2	
for every pair of points (xi,ti) ∈K, i = 1,2.
In the case N ⩾3, it is necessary to assume some conditions either on the maximal
graph β(·) or on the structure of the elliptic operator. In [72] the following result is proved.
THEOREM 23. Let N ⩾3. Let u be a locally bounded weak solution of the prototype
equation (5.17), where β(·) is any maximal monotone graph satisfying conditions (5.2)
and (5.3). Then u is continuous in ΩT . Moreover, for every compact subset K ⊂ΩT ,
there exists a continuous, nonnegative, increasing function
s →ωdata,K(s),
ωdata,K(0) = 0
that can be determined a priori only in terms of the data and the distance from K to the
parabolic boundary of ΩT , such that

5.4.1. The statement of the alternative.
For the moment we consider the general equa-
tion (5.1) in any number of dimensions. We assume that β(·) is any maximal monotone
graph satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3) and that the structure conditions (5.8)–(5.14)
hold. Only later we will point the differences between N = 2 and N ⩾3. Without loss of
generality, we assume that the generic point (x0,t0) is equal to (0,0).

where ν ∈(0,1) is a number that will be determined a priori only in terms of the data.
Assume for the moment that one of (5.33) and (5.34) holds. By using an iterative argu-
ment based on the energy estimates, we can show that it is possible to reduce the oscillation
of u in the smaller cylinder (0, ˜t )+Q2δρ if one chooses ν very small and depending upon ω
(see Proposition 2.5± of [72]):
PROPOSITION 17. There exists a number ν ∈(0,1), that can be determined a priori only
in terms of the data and ω, such that, if (5.33) holds for some ˜t ∈(−(1 −16δ2)ρ2,0), then
either ω ⩽Cρλ or
u(x,t) ⩽μ+ −1

(x,t) ∈0, ˜t 	 + Q2δρ.

(5.37)
We recall to the reader that C is a constant depending upon the structure conditions of
equation (5.1).
By using the logarithmic estimates (see Proposition 3.2± of [72]) it is possible to bring
the information of the reduction of the oscillation of the solution up to the level t = 0. More
precisely:
PROPOSITION 18. Assume that there is ˜t ∈(−(1 −16δ2)ρ2,−4δ2ρ2) such that
ux, ˜t 	 ⩽μ+ −1
16ω
∀x ∈K2δρ.
(5.38)
Then there are constants η,λ ∈(0,1) and C > 1, depending upon the data and δ, but
independent of ω and ρ, such that either ω ⩽Cρλ or
u(x,t) ⩽μ+ −ηω,
(x,t) ∈(0,0) + Qδρ.

∀x ∈K2δρ
(5.40)
then either ω ⩽Cρλ or
u(x,t) ⩾μ−+ ηω,
(x,t) ∈(0,0) + Qδρ.
(5.41)
Summarizing, if the alternatives (5.33) and (5.34) are satisﬁed, then respectively
(5.38) and (5.40) hold. Therefore the oscillation of u is reduced in the smaller cylinder
(0,0) + Qδρ. If we are able to prove that even when (5.35) holds we have a reduction
of the oscillation of u in a smaller cylinder, by repeating the arguments of the previous
sections, one can deduce the local continuity of the solution. Therefore, in the sequel, we
assume that, for each small δ and for each ˜t ∈(−(1 −16δ2)ρ2,0),

By using a lemma of measure theory, the above inequalities will imply regions where
the energy is concentrated. From this fact, we are able to ﬁnd a contradiction in assum-
ing (5.35) and hence to prove the regularity of the solutions. In the next section we state
and prove the lemma of measure theory. We feel that it is of intrinsic interest and that it
can be applied in different ﬁelds.

a number δ ∈(0,1), that can be determined a priori only in terms of N,p,γ,α,λ,η, such

If v were continuous, this lemma would be an easy consequence of the permanence
of positivity. For the sake of simplicity, we prove this lemma assuming N = 2 (the case
N ⩾3 can be proved using an inductive procedure) and v ∈C1(Kρ). Obviously we es-
tablish (5.44) with δ independent of the modulus of continuity of v. The assumption
v ∈C1(Kρ) is made only to justify some calculations and can be removed via a limiting
procedure. For more details on this proof, we refer the reader to Proposition A.1 of [72].
Before proving the lemma we stress that δ goes to 0 when either η goes to 0 or λ goes to 1.
PROOF OF LEMMA 14. Let (x,y) be the coordinates in R2. Denote by Y(x) the cross-
section of the set [v < 1] ∩Kρ with lines parallel to the y-axis, i.e.,
Y(x) =

Hence,

As |[v < 1] ∩Kρ| ⩾2αρ, there exists some x0 ∈(−ρ,ρ) such that
Y(x0)
 ⩾2αρ.
(5.45)
For each y ∈Y(x0), consider the segment
Iδ0ρ(y) = [x0 −δ0ρ,x0 + δ0ρ] × {y},
where δ0 will be chosen later. Denote with Yδ0(x0) the set of Y(x0) such that, in the corre-
sponding intervals Iδ0ρ(y), the function v(·,y) is less than 1
2(1 + λ), i.e.,
Yδ0(x0) =

y ∈Y(x0): v(x,y) < 1

Now, we want to prove that , for each η0 < 1 there exists a small δ0 such that

Let Y C
δ0(x0) be the complement of Yδ0(x0). Fix y ∈Y C
δ0(x0) and some x ∈Iδ0ρ(y) such that

Next, ﬁx y∗∈Yδ0(x0). We recall that v(x,y∗) ⩽(1 + λ)/2 for each x ∈Iδ0ρ(y∗). Con-
sider the vertical segment
Jδρ(x) = {x} × y∗−δρ,y∗+ δρ,
where δ will be chosen later. Denote with Hδ(y∗) the set of Iδ0ρ(y∗) such that, in the

Let H C

choosing δ such that δ0 ⩽8γ δ1−1/p/(λ −1)(4δ0)1/p ⩽η.
Without loss of generality (assuming δ smaller) we may assume that δ0/δ is a posi-
tive integer. Consider the interval Iδ0ρ(y∗) and a partition of it with δ0/δ intervals with
length 2δρ. Let (xi,y∗) be the centers of such intervals. Let x∗be one of such indices such
that

Then, from the deﬁnition of Hδ(y∗), the cube Kδρ(x∗,y∗) satisﬁes the assumption of the
lemma.

5.4.3. The geometric approach.
In this section, we will apply the previous lemma to get
some geometric information about the localization of the energy of the solution. This is,
in essence, the novelty of the approach in [72]. We recall that we assumed that, for each
small δ and for each ˜t ∈(−(1 −16δ2)ρ2,0),
Meas

Roughly speaking (for more details see Sections 5–8 of [72]) it means that the region
where the function u is close to μ+ (respectively, to μ−) is relatively large. By applying
the lemma of the previous section (together with energy and logarithmic estimates) one
can get that the set where u is close to μ+ (respectively, to μ−) must have a concentration
region, even though it might be scattered in the whole cylinder. Moreover, it is possible
to prove that these two concentration regions are localized at the same time levels. More
precisely, it is possible to prove:
PROPOSITION 19. Let u be a locally bounded weak solution of (5.1) where β(·) is
any maximal monotone graph satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3) and suppose that the
structure conditions (5.8)–(5.14) are satisﬁed. Assume that the alternative (5.35) holds.
Then there exists a time ˜t ∈(−(1 −16δ2)ρ2,0), and two points x1,x2 ∈K4δρ such that
[xi + Kδ2ρ], i = 1,2, have their cross sections mutually separated by a distance of at

SKETCH OF THE PROOF. Suppose that (5.34) is violated. Then for some time levels t ∈

we have
Measx ∈Kδ2ρ2: v(x,t) ⩽1 ⩾ν|Kδ2ρ2|.
(5.48)
Changing the constant ν into a smaller positive constant α, it is possible to ﬁnd a time τ
such that the following inequalities hold:
Meas

x ∈Kδ2ρ2: v(x,t) ⩽1

⩾α|Kδ2ρ2|,

Kδ2ρ2
∇v(x,τ)
2 dx ⩽γdata(ω)(ρδ)2N−4,
where γdata is independent of τ. Therefore by the lemma of measure theory, there exists
ηδ0 ∈(0,1) and a cube [x∗+ Kδ2ρ2δ0] ⊂Kδ2ρ2, such that
Meas

x ∈

x∗+ Kδ2ρ2δ0

: v(x,τ) ⩽2

⩾(1 −η)|Kδ2ρ2δ0|.
It means that u(x,τ) ⩽μ−+ 1
16ω except, at most, at a set of measure less than η|Kδ2ρ2δ0|.
The information at the time τ is almost complete (with the exception of an arbitrarily small
set). Removing this set of small measure through the energy and logarithmic estimates, it
is possible to get (5.47).
□
Summarizing, if the alternative (5.35) holds, then (5.46) and (5.47) are veriﬁed. There-
fore

∀yi ∈[xi + Kδ2ρ],i = 1,2,
(5.49)
for all time levels
t ∈˜t −δ4ρ2, ˜t 	.
(5.50)
In such temporal range, integrate (5.49) over a path, piecewise parallel to the coordinates
axes and joining y1 ∈[x1 + Kδ2ρ] and y2 ∈[x2 + Kδ2ρ]. Integrate the resulting segment-

integrals over the remaining N −1 variables, and then over the time in the range (5.50).
Therefore
γ (ω)(δρ)N ⩽
 ˜t
˜t−δ4ρ2

Kδρ\Kδ2ρ2
|∇u|2 dx dτ.
(5.51)
This inequality has been derived for all ˜t for which (5.33) and (5.34) are both violated.
Noting that, in the temporal range, the number of cylinders of the type (0, ˜t ) + Q4δρ is of
order δ−2, we add (5.51) over the corresponding boxes to get
γ (ω)δN−2ρN ⩽
 0
−ρ2

Kδρ\Kδ2ρ2
|∇u|2 dx dτ.
(5.52)
We may repeat the argument replacing δ2 with δ. Iterating this procedure, we have that for
each n ∈N,
γ (ω)δn(N−2)ρN ⩽
 0
−ρ2

Kδnρ\Kδn+1ρ2
|∇u|2 dx dτ.
(5.53)
For more details about the estimates of this section, we refer the reader to Sections 9–12
of [72].
5.4.4. The case N = 2.
Adding (5.53) for n = 1,...,n0, one obtains
γ (ω)n0ρN ⩽
 
Qρ
|∇u|2 dx dτ.
(5.54)
On the other hand, via a standard energy estimate, we have
 
Qρ
|∇u|2 dx dτ ⩽CρN,
(5.55)
where C is a constant only depending on the data. Therefore, combining (5.54) and (5.55),
one gets
γ (ω)n0 ⩽C.
This is a contradiction if n0 is sufﬁciently large depending on the data and ω. It follows that
at least one of the alternatives (5.33) or (5.34) holds in the range (5.50) and for some radius
ρ0 ∈[ρ,δn0ρ]. But we have already shown that if one of the alternatives (5.33) or (5.34)
holds, then the oscillation of u is reduced in the cylinder Qρ0/2. Hence, the local continuity
of the solution is proved in the case N = 2.
REMARK 41. The same argument works in the case in which one has information that
essentially reduces the space dimension N to 1 or 2.

270
E. DiBenedetto et al.
REMARK 42. In the case N = 2 the previous argument works for a more general maximal
monotone graph β = βAC + βs of bounded variation, with βAC an absolutely continu-
ous and strictly increasing function, and βs ⩾0 a nondecreasing function where, roughly
speaking, the jumps occur (for more details, see [77]). This method works also for more
general (other than second order) operators (see [152–154]).
5.4.5. The geometric approach continued.
In order to face the case N ⩾3, the geometric
approach needs to be improved. We stress, that all the results of this section hold under the
most general assumptions.
To prove the continuity of u at a point (x,t) ∈ΩT we assume that such a point coincides
with the origin up to a translation. The novelty of this improved approach is that we work
with a longer cylinder Q(θρ2,ρ), where θ is a positive integer number to be chosen. The
idea is to ﬁnd a “long” cylinder where u is away from μ−(and μ+) and this property should
allow a space extension of positivity of the solution. It is clear that the structure itself of
these singular parabolic equations forces us to deal with “long” cylinders. Actually, if one
tries to repeat the argument of intrinsically rescaled cylinders (used in the case of the porous
medium equation) for graphs of the Stefan type, one realizes that β′(·) is the Dirac mass
at the origin. As a consequence the time should be intrinsically rescaled into another one
that would remain constant on the transition set u = 0. In other words, one has to work
with cylinders whose length depends upon the singularity of β(·). We recall that a similar
approach was used for the ﬁrst time in [52] in the context of the boundary regularity in the
case of a single singularity.
Consider the cylinders
(0,ti) + Qρ2,ρ	,
ti = −iρ2,i = 0,1,...,θ −1,
(5.56)
that make a partition of the cylinder Q(θρ2,ρ). Analogously to what was made in the
previous sections we can state an alternative:
there exists i = 0,1,...,θ −1 such that either

(5.58)
Otherwise,
both (5.57) and (5.58) are violated ∀i = 0,1,...,θ −1.
(5.59)
If (5.57) and (5.58) hold then, as shown in the previous sections, one can deduce the re-
duction of the oscillation of the solution. So we assume that (5.59) holds. Analogously this
assumption implies that the solution has regions of concentration in any of the cylinders
(0,ti) + Q(ρ2,ρ).

of the oscillation of the solution in Q(δ0ρ,δ2

such an assumption, (5.60) and (5.61) hold. Therefore, there are 1 ⩽l,r ⩽mN and 1 ⩽

If one is only interested in having, at any time level, a set where the solution is away
from μ+ and μ−(thus losing the geometrical information that this set has the shape of a
very long and thin cylinder) one can prove that the constant ε does not depend on δ0. More
precisely,

SKETCH OF THE PROOF. Reasoning as in the previous proposition, we may assume that
(5.60) and (5.61) hold. Therefore, for each i = 0,...,16m2
0 −1, there are 1 ⩽l,r ⩽mN
and 1 ⩽j,s ⩽16m2 such that
u(x,t) ⩾μ+ −1

43. An

question
is
to
prove
under
general
assumptions
that
(5.62)–(5.65) imply a space extension of positivity. What seems to be missing is some
sort of weak form of the Harnack inequality for solutions of singular parabolic equations.
REMARK 44. The estimates (5.64) and (5.65) give us the same piece of information in the
interior of ΩT that a suitable Dirichlet condition gives on the boundary in [52]. This allows
to extend the techniques introduced in [52] to the case of multiple singularities (see [87]).
If one accepts to work with cylinders whose base is very small with respect to the length,
the previous results can be improved. The next proposition is proved in [72] (see Proposi-
tion 24.1, p. 291) and it is based on a tricky combinatorial argument.
PROPOSITION 22. Let u be a locally bounded weak solution of (5.1), with β(·) any max-
imal monotone graph satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3), and assume that the structure
conditions (5.8)–(5.14) are satisﬁed. Then there exists ε ∈(0,1), depending only upon the
data and ω, such that, for each θ > 0, there exists a δ0 > 0 such that either the oscillation
of u is reduced (in a way that can be quantitatively determined) in Q(δ2
0ρ2,δ0ρ) or there
exists (xi,ti) ∈Q(ρ2,δ0ρ), with i = 1,2, such that the cylinders (xi,ti) + Q(θδ2
0ρ2,δ0ρ) are
contained in the cylinder Q(ρ2,δ0ρ) and
u(x,t) ⩾μ−+ εω
∀(x,t) ∈(x1,t1) + Q(θδ2

(5.66)
and
u(x,t) ⩽μ+ −εω
∀(x,t) ∈(x2,t2) + Q(θδ2
0ρ2,δ0ρ).
(5.67)
Summarizing, the previous proposition says that if one wants that the concentration of
the solution still has the shape of a long cylinder and does not want to pay the price of

having ε depending upon the length of the cylinders, then one looses the information about
the precise localization of such a cylinder.
The next proposition is based on energy estimates, a De Giorgi lemma (see Lemma 2.2
of [55]) and estimates (5.64) and (5.65). For a detailed proof see Lemma 4.10 of [87].
PROPOSITION 23. Let u be a locally bounded weak solution of (5.1), with β(·) any max-
imal monotone graph satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3), and assume that the structure
conditions (5.8)–(5.14) are satisﬁed. Then there exist two continuous strictly increasing
functions δ(·),η(·), δ(0) = η(0) = 0, that can be determined a priori only in terms of the
data and ω, such that either the oscillation of u is reduced (in a way that can be quantita-
tively determined ) in Q(δ2(s)ρ2,δ(s)ρ) or

(5.69)
Summarizing, one is able to estimate the sets where the solution is close to μ+ and μ−
paying the price of considering “thin” cylinders.
5.4.6. The case N ⩾3.
As already stressed, we are not able to prove the regularity in
the general case. We follow the approach of [72] (see also [86] and [160]) and we prove
continuity results using a suitable comparison function.
In [72], the local continuity for weak solutions of the prototype equation (5.17) is proved.
The key point in the proof of the continuity theorem are some estimates on a proper
function v, which is then compared with the solution u of the original singular parabolic
equation. In these estimates the radial symmetry of the problem is heavily used, but a care-
ful examination of the whole procedure shows that this assumption can be done away with,
provided the maximum principle and a Harnack inequality for the corresponding elliptic
operator hold for all time levels (see [86]). Let us just remark that the basic reason to use
the comparison function is to mimic a parabolic Harnack inequality, whose validity is not
known in this context. For a detailed proof of the results of this section we refer the reader
to [72,86,160]).
Consider the singular parabolic equation
β(u)t = Lu,

where L is an elliptic operator with principal part in divergence form. We assume

conditions (5.8)–(5.14) are satisﬁed, while (5.74) is assumed in order to have the maximum
principle in any parabolic cylinder contained in ΩT . Before giving a sketch of the proof, we
stress that the only properties of L(x,t,u,Du) on which we will rely are the following:
(1) L satisﬁes the maximum principle;
(2) the coefﬁcients of L are continuous in t;
(3) in the case of time-dependent coefﬁcients, the elliptic operator L satisﬁes a uniform
Harnack inequality t by t.
The most important of the three assumptions is the last one and this shows once more how
the Harnack inequality is crucial when proving regularity results for solution of PDEs.
For the sake of simplicity we consider only the case of time independent coefﬁcients
(the reader ﬁnds a detailed proof of the general case in [86] and [160]). Without loss of
generality, assume that (5.66) holds, i.e.,
u(x,t) ⩾μ−+ εω
∀(x,t) ∈(x1,t1) + Q(θδ2
0ρ2,δ0ρ)
(if not, it means that the oscillation of the solution is automatically reduced in a smaller
cylinder). As in [72], apply the change of variables

and introduce the function

.
We have that ˜u solves the differential equation
 ˜β

˜u
		
t = ˜L

˜u
	
,
where ˜β and ˜L satisfy the same structural conditions of the operator (5.71) (for more details
see [72]). Moreover, ˜u(x,t) ⩾1 in Kε0 ×(0,θ). Without loss of generality, we may assume
that ε0 ⩽1
2. Deﬁne A(d1,d2) × (t1,t2) as the annulus {d1 < |x| < d2} × (t1,t2). Finally, we
are interested in the behavior of ˜u in an annulus contained in A(ε0,4d) × (0,θ) where we
may assume d ⩾4 (see [72]). For this reason we introduce a proper comparison function.
Namely, let v solve the following boundary value problem
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
 ˜β(v)
	
t = ˜Lv
in A(ε0,4d) × (0,θ),
v(x,t) = 0
on |x| = 4d,
v(x,t) = 1
on |x| = ε0,
v(x,0) = 0.
(5.75)
By the maximum principle, ˜u ⩾v. Hence if we are able to prove that there is a level
t0 ∈(0,θ) such that there is a σ0 > 0, depending only upon the data, such that
v(x,t0) ⩾σ0
∀1 ⩽|x| ⩽2d,
(5.76)
we have that a similar bound works for ˜u. By returning to the original coordinates, we
conclude that there exists a time level t1 such that
u(x,t1) > μ−+ σ0εω
∀x ∈Kδ∗ρ,
with δ∗a positive constant that can be determined a priori only in terms of the data. As
in [72] (Sections 24 and 25), by using the logarithmic estimates, one can bring this piece
of information up to level zero and in this way reduce the oscillation of u in the small
cylinder Q(δ∗ρ).
In order to prove (5.76), let ζ be the solution of the elliptic problem
Lζ = 0
in Aε0,4d,
ζ(x) = 0
on |x| = 4d,
ζ(x) = 1
on |x| = ε0.
(5.77)
By well-known classical results, there is a unique solution ζ satisfying (5.77) (see [88],
Theorems 8.1 and 8.3). Moreover, ζ is Hölder continuous (see [120]). Finally, the hy-
potheses on the coefﬁcients ensure that w belongs to an elliptic De Giorgi’s class, which

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
277
in turn guarantees that w satisﬁes a Harnack inequality (under this point of view, see for
example [124], Chapter 3). Therefore we may assume that there is σ0 such that
ζ(x) ⩾2σ0
∀1 ⩽|x| ⩽2d.
(5.78)
The aim now is to transfer this information to v. With this purpose, put z = v −ζ and set
Γ (x,·) = ˜β(· −ζ(x)). It is easy to see that z satisﬁes
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩

Γ (z)
	
t = Lz
in Aε0,4d × (0,k),
z(x,t) = 0
on |x| = 4d,
z(x,t) = 0
on |x| = ε0,
z(x,0) = −ζ(x)
on x ∈Aε0,4d.
(5.79)
By the energy estimates, one gets that
 k
0

Aε0,4d
|∇z|2 dx dt ⩽C.
(5.80)
There must exist a time level t∗such that

Aε0,4d
|∇z|2 dx ⩽δ0,
(5.81)
with τ0 a proper small quantity. In fact, if it were not so, integrating on (0,k) we obtain
 k
0

Aε0,4d
|∇z|2 dx ⩾kδ0
and it sufﬁces to choose k large enough to get a contradiction.
Now we claim that, if we choose δ0 small enough, a consequence of (5.81) is that
∀x ∈Aε0,2d,
(ζ −v)

x,t∗	
⩽σ0.
(5.82)
In fact, if it were not true, reproducing the same argument of [72], Sections 6–8, and using
the measure lemma, we conclude that there exist a y∗∈Aε0,4d and a small cube Kρ(y∗) ⊂
Aε0,4d such that
∀x ∈Kρ
y∗	,
(ζ −v)x,t∗	 > σ0
2 .
Connecting, through a path, the boundary Kρ(y∗) with the boundary of Aε0,4d, i.e., with
a portion of the boundary where |x| = 4d, and working as in Section 9 of [72] we get a
lower bound for

Aε0,4d |∇z(x,t∗)|2 dx, thus obtaining a contradiction by choosing δ0 small
enough. Therefore (5.82) holds.
The proof of the local continuity of a bounded solution of (5.70) follows from the remark
that estimate (5.76) is a direct consequence of (5.78) and (5.82).

REMARK 45. The boundary regularity for singular equations like the ones we are dealing
with here still presents several open questions. In the case of β with a single jump, interior
regularity is again a matter of energy and logarithmic inequalities and this allows for a
complete solution of boundary regularity for variational data, as in [48].
In the case of a general β it remains an open problem to devise a technique of proof only
based on energy and logarithmic estimates. Therefore, for the moment, it is only possible
to consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions under mild assumptions on ∂Ω,
without taking into account initial conditions. Assume, for instance, the compactness and
the Lipschitz continuity of the boundary. By the compactness of the boundary of Ω, we
can cover ∂Ω with a ﬁnite number of neighborhoods centered at points of ∂Ω. The Lip-
schitz continuity of the boundary allows us to ﬁnd a map from every neighborhood into
a half ball of RN. The transformed equation via this map has coefﬁcients which are still
measurable with respect to x, properly summable with respect to the pair (x,t), and con-
tinuous with respect to t. Now we reﬂect the operator through the entire ball and notice
that this reﬂection does not affect the (β(u))t term, since it is done only with respect to the
x variable. We have therefore reduced the study to a problem in the interior and we can
apply the previous results to prove the boundary regularity.
5.4.7. The case N ⩾3 continued.
In this section, we prove the regularity for
particular cases of (5.1). Here we permit the maximal generality allowed from condi-
tions (5.8)–(5.14), but we consider a very special β of the type
β(s) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
−s −ν1
if s < 0,
[−ν1,0]
if s = 0,
s
if 0 < s < 1,
[1,1 + ν2]
if s = 1,
s + ν2
if s > 1.
This special β allows us to write explicitly the logarithmic and energy estimates. The use
of the estimates, together with the geometrical constructions of the previous sections, will
allow to prove the local continuity of the solutions. This approach is developed in a very
detailed way in [87]. A similar approach can be found in [52] in a different context. We
feel that the right approach to the local continuity is this one, that is, it must be based only
on logarithmic and energy estimates and geometric constructions.
We only give a sketch of the ideas on which the proof is based. Without loss of generality,
we may assume that μ+ = 1 + ε0 and μ−= −ε0, with ε0 very “small”. The idea is to
reduce the oscillation of u such that either u > 0 or u < 1. In this way, the problem has
been reduced to the case of only a singularity. Without loss of generality, we can focus our
attention to ﬁnd a subcylinder where u > 0. Apply Proposition 23. Choose s0 > ε0 such
that either the oscillation of u is so reduced in Q(δ2(s0)ρ2,δ(s0)ρ) that u > 0 in such a
cylinder or
Meas

(x,t) ∈Q(ρ2,δ(s0)ρ): u(x,t) ⩽μ−+ sω

⩾η(s0)|Q(ρ2,δ(s0)ρ)|.
(5.83)
Note that η(s0) is very small (in a quantitatively way that will be clear in the sequel) if ε0 is
chosen really small.

Current issues on singular and degenerate evolution equations
279
Partition the cylinder Q(ρ2,δ(s0)ρ) in subcylinders Q(δ2(s0)ρ2,δ(s0)ρ). Apply the iteration
method based on energy and logarithmic estimates, choosing as test function (u −1
4)−.
There are two possibilities:
(i) either in one of the subcylinders the set where u is less than or equal to zero is
negligible; then the iteration method works as in the nonsingular case. So one can ﬁnd
a small cylinder where u ⩾1
8. Then, via the logarithmic estimates, one can bring this
positivity up to the level zero if ε0 is chosen small enough;
(ii) or, in each of the subcylinders, the set where u is less or equal to zero is not neg-
ligible. Then by (5.83) one can deduce that there exists a subcylinder where the measure
of the set where u is less than 1
8 is a function of η0. So if we choose η0 small enough,
the alternative (5.34) holds. So one can ﬁnd a small cylinder where u ⩾1
16. Then, via the
logarithmic estimates, one can bring this positivity up to the level zero if ε0 is chosen small
enough.
REMARK 46. The fact that β(·) has only two jumps is not essential. Any ﬁnite number of
jumps would be acceptable.
REMARK 47. This approach seems to work not only with jumps but also with singularities
that grow in a very fast way. It could be of some interest to start an investigation on such a
direction.

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems

1. Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to introduce the study on nonlinear systems of partial differential
equations which are of hyperbolic–parabolic type. This kind of system widely arises from
various applied sciences among which we only choose certain fundamental models from
continuum physics: the nonlinear systems of partial differential equations with both hyper-
bolic and parabolic effects from thermoelasticity, thermoviscoelasticity and dynamics of
compressible viscous ﬂuids.
In continuum physics, material bodies are modeled as continuous media whose mo-
tion and equilibrium are governed by balance laws and constitutive relations. The list of
balance laws in force identiﬁes the theory, for example, mechanics, thermomechanics, elec-
trodynamics, etc. The referential (Lagrangian) and the spatial (Eulerian) formulation of the
typical balance laws – the balance laws of mass, momentum and energy, can be presented
as certain nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems of partial differential equations
(see, e.g., the books [17,32] by Carlson and by Dafermos for the detailed derivation). The
type of constitutive relation characterizes the nature of material response. We will discuss
the constitutive equations in thermoelasticity, thermoviscoelasticity and compressible vis-
cous ﬂuid dynamics.
The equations of thermoelasticity describe the elastic and the thermal behavior of elastic
and heat conductive media, in particular, the reciprocal actions between elastic stresses and
temperature differences where the dissipation is induced by thermal diffusion, while the
equations of thermoviscoelasticity as well as the compressible Navier–Stokes equations,
an extension of thermoelasticity, encompass materials with, besides thermal diffusion, in-
ternal dissipation induced by viscosity. In this chapter we consider the classical nonlinear
thermoelastic, thermoviscoelastic systems and the compressible Navier–Stokes equations
which are nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems.
It is well known both for hyperbolic and for parabolic nonlinear equations and systems
that smooth solutions in general might not exist globally in time but develop singularities
in ﬁnite time. The criteria according to which global solutions still exist are different for
hyperbolic and parabolic equations. Hence for a hyperbolic–parabolic coupled system, the
question arises whether the behavior of the system will be dominated by the hyperbolic
or by the parabolic part. The answer will depend on the number of space dimensions, as
well as the strength of the dissipation involved: the combined dissipation of viscosity and
heat diffusion, or the pure heat diffusion. This also applies to the question of asymptotic
behavior of solutions.
In Section 2, we give a brief derivation to the equations of thermoelasticity and thermo-
viscoelasticity, and the compressible Navier–Stokes equations.
Section 3 is devoted to the nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic system in thermoviscoelas-
ticity. We elucidate the inﬂuence of dissipation mechanism in the one-space dimensional
system on qualitative behavior of solutions in this section. We ﬁrst show that the combined
dissipation effects of viscosity and thermal diffusion may counterbalance the destabilizing
inﬂuence of nonlinearity and thus induce the existence of globally deﬁned smooth solu-
tions to the Cauchy problem or initial boundary value problems even for large smooth
initial data. Then, the inﬂuence of dissipation on the large-time behavior of solutions is
discussed, with different kind of materials or with different type of boundary conditions.

L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
The globally deﬁned weak solutions to the one-dimensional system with large discontin-
uous initial data are investigated in Section 4 in which we consider the system for isentropic
viscous ﬂow ﬁrst and turn to the nonisentropic case in the second part. The results on the
well-posedness and large-time behavior of solutions are introduced, as well as certain re-
sults on regularity and stability of solutions. Moreover, it is shown that neither vacuum
nor concentration can occur in the solution if there is neither vacuum nor concentration
initially, no matter how large the external force in the system and how large the oscillation
of the initial data are. Section 5 is devoted to vacuum problems for one-dimensional isen-
tropic viscous gas ﬂow. We consider the compressible Navier–Stokes equations when the
viscosity coefﬁcient is a positive constant ﬁrst and then discuss the case when the viscosity
coefﬁcient depends on the density. In both cases the results on the existence and behavior
of weak solutions to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with vacuum are presented.
For the equations of multidimensional nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity, to our best
knowledge, there are few results on the global existence for general large data. Hence
in this chapter, instead of multidimensional thermoviscoelasticity, we only discuss the
Navier–Stokes equations of multidimensional compressible ﬂuids (which can be consid-
ered as a thermoviscoelastic system for compressible ﬂuids).
Section 6 is concerned with mathematical topics on the Navier–Stokes equations
for multidimensional compressible ﬂuids. The mathematical study of the compressible
Navier–Stokes equations perhaps goes back to the work by Nash [173] on the local in time
existence in the last sixties. Since then, signiﬁcant progress has been made on the mathe-
matical topics, such as the global existence and the time-asymptotic behavior of solutions.
However, a number of important questions still remain open for large data.
Concerning the global well-posedness and the large-time behavior of solutions, the pic-
ture is more or less complete when data are sufﬁciently small. For large data the situation
becomes quite complex. The global well-posedness for the Navier–Stokes equations of
compressible heat-conducting ﬂuids still remains open. On the other hand, the global exis-
tence and the large-time behavior of solutions have been obtained in the case of isentropic
ﬂuids, or heat-conducting ﬂuids with symmetric data in symmetric domains without the
origin in order to avoid the mathematical difﬁculties induced by the singularity at the ori-
gin. We will discuss this issue in more details in Section 6.
The last two sections (Sections 7 and 8) are devoted to the study of the equations of
classical nonlinear thermoelasticity, which are a coupling of the equations of elasticity and
of the heat equation and thus build a hyperbolic–parabolic system. For thermoelasticity,
however, the dissipation is induced only by thermal diffusion, hence weaker than that for
thermoviscoelasticity. We are mainly interested in proving the well-posedness in the class
of smooth solutions and in describing the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as time tends
to inﬁnity. Although the well-posedness in the linear theory has been studied for years, the
description of the general dynamical system with its asymptotic behavior as time tends to
inﬁnity and, in particular, the study of nonlinear systems was only started in the late sixties
and the early eighties, respectively, and led to very interesting features.
In one space dimension the picture is more or less complete. Bounded or unbounded
intervals representing the reference conﬁguration can be dealt with for all the classical
boundary conditions. For small initial data global smooth solutions to the nonlinear system
will exist; large initial data lead to a blow-up, then weak solutions must be considered.

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems
291
These results show that the dissipation induced by thermal diffusion is strong enough for
small data to prevent a smooth solution from a ﬁnite-time blow-up but not for large data,
and that the behavior of the nonlinear thermoelastic system in one space dimension is
dominated by the heat conduction at least with respect to the existence of solutions for
small data and the time-asymptotic behavior of solutions.
In more than one space dimension the local well-posedness is known in most cases,
but concerning the global existence or blow-up, the situation becomes delicate. It is well
known that in the case of pure elasticity there are global small solutions if the nonlinearity
degenerates up to order two, i.e., if the nonlinearity is cubic (near zero values of its ar-
guments). In the “genuinely nonlinear” case, a blow-up in ﬁnite time has to be expected.
On the other hand quadratic nonlinearities in R3 still lead to global, small solutions of the
heat equation. The question remains whether here the dissipative impact through heat con-
duction is strong enough to prevent solutions from blowing up at least for small data. The
answer to this question will be positive for the Cauchy problem if one essentially excludes
those nonlinearities which are responsible for blow-up results in pure elasticity or one con-
siders the radially symmetric case; otherwise a smooth solution generally breaks down for
small data for general (quadratic) nonlinearities in the “genuinely nonlinear” case. We will
present these results in Sections 7 and 8.
Most of the material presented here has only been previously published in original pa-
pers, and some of the material has never been published until now. A long list of references
has been included, although it is not intended to be exhaustive and some of the references
included there are not quoted in the text. Of course the selection of the material follows
personal interests and experiences.
2. The general governing equations
In this section we derive brieﬂy the equations of thermo- and thermoviscoelasticity and the
compressible Navier–Stokes equations.
In continuum physics the mathematical model of an n-dimensional body (n = 1,2, or 3)
is a manifold characterized by a reference conﬁguration, i.e., an open subset B of the ref-
erence space Rn. The typical point in B is called a material particle. A conﬁguration of
the body B is a Lipschitz homeomorphism X = X(x) from B to the physical space Rn.
A motion of B is an evolution X = X(t,x) of conﬁgurations. Thus X(t,x) is the posi-
tion of particle x at time t; the curve X(·,x) is the trajectory of particle x; X(t,·) is the
conﬁguration of B at time t. X(t,x) is called deformation.
In continuum physics one seeks to determine the time evolution of the ﬁelds of vari-
ous physical quantities, such as density, stress, temperature, etc., deﬁned over the moving
body. Since every conﬁguration is homeomorphic to the reference conﬁguration, these ﬁeld
quantities can be represented equally well as functions of (t,x) (Lagrangian or referential
coordinates) or of (t,X) (Eulerian or spatial coordinates). To avoid cumbersome notation,
we denote
F = ∇xX

F ij = ∂Xi
∂xj

,
˙ = ∂
∂t + u · ∇X,
u = ˙X,

292
L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
where F denotes the deformation gradient ﬁeld and u is the velocity ﬁeld, ∇x and ∇X de-
note the gradients of their Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions with respect to x and to X,
respectively, and analogously for divx and divX. In particular, since each conﬁguration of
the body is homeomorphic to its reference conﬁguration B we assume
detF ̸= 0.
Continuum thermomechanics rests upon the balance laws of mass, linear momentum
and energy. The ﬁeld equations in Lagrangian coordinates read

where ρc is the reference density, %S denotes the Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, and ε is the
speciﬁc internal energy, and Q is the heat ﬂux, b and r denote the speciﬁc external body
force and the external heat supply respectively.
The balance law of mass (2.1) simply states that the reference density ρc is a function
of x, in particular, a constant for a homogeneous medium. The balance law of angular
momentum gives SF ′ = FS′, where and in what follows a prime denotes transposition.
If u is Lipschitz continuous, we may combine (2.1) and (2.2) to deduce (2.3) into the

second law of thermodynamics is expressed by the Clausius–Duhem inequality:

Constitutive equations, which express how the ﬁelds appearing in the balance laws are

relations have to comply with a number of requirements stemming from material frame
indifference, material symmetry and the second law of thermodynamics. Here we outline
the theory of constitutive equations for the class of thermoviscoelastic materials of the
differential type and the class of thermoelastic materials.
A material is homogeneous thermoviscoelastic of the differential type when the free
energy, stress, entropy and heat ﬂux at any material particle x and time t are solely deter-
mined by the values of F, ∇xu, θ, ∇xθ at (t,x), i.e., in Lagrangian coordinates and upon
setting W = ∇xu = ˙F , g = ∇xθ:
ψ = ˆψ(F,W,θ,g),
%S = S(F,W,θ,g),
η = ˆη(F,W,θ,g),
Q = 
Q(F,W,θ,g).
(2.8)
As mentioned before, the constitutive relations (2.8) should be consistent with the
requirement that every smooth process compatible with (2.1)–(2.3) must satisfy the
Clausius–Duhem inequality (2.6) (and (2.7)). Substituting (2.8) into (2.7), we obtain after
a calculation that ψ is independent of the velocity and temperature gradients ∇xu,∇xT ,
and (cf. [32])
ψ = ˆψ(F,θ),
%S = ρc

Q(F,W,θ,g) should satisfy
tr
Z(F,W,θ,g)W ′	
−1
θ
ˆQ(F,W,θ,g) · g ⩾0.
(2.10)
We recall that SF ′ = FS′ (the balance law of angular momentum) which reduces here to
Z(F,W,θ,g)F ′ = F Z′(F,W,θ,g). Further reduction on the constitutive relations results
from the principle of material frame indifference, we refer to [32] for the details.
By substituting the relations (2.8) and (2.5) into (2.2) and (2.4), one obtains a complete
system of nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity for the unknown functions X(t,x), θ(t,x). In
Section 3 we will discuss some mathematical issues on the one-dimensional case.
The limiting case of a thermoviscoelasticity material with stress and heat ﬂux inde-
pendent of velocity gradient yields the thermoelastic material. In that case, the left-hand
side of (2.10) is an afﬁne function of W and so this inequality will hold identically only

294

if Z vanishes. Consequently, for a thermoelastic material, the constitutive equations (2.9)
and the inequality (2.10) become

(2.12)
Equation (2.2) is mainly a hyperbolic system of second order for X, while (2.12) is
mainly a parabolic equation for θ. Instead of X and θ, the displacement U and the temper-
ature difference θ −T0, still denoted by θ, i.e.,
U := X −x,
θ := θ −T0
(2.13)
are often used, where T0 is a constant reference temperature. We shall write ˆψ(F,T ) =
ˆψ(∇U,θ) with the same symbol ˆψ, analogously for the other response functions. Then,
the system of thermoelasticity consists of (2.2) and (2.12) together with (2.11), where the
unknown functions are U(t,x) and θ(t,x). The problem of ﬁnding U and θ will become
well posed if additionally boundary (when Ω ̸= Rn) and initial conditions are prescribed.
Mathematical issues on thermoelasticity will be discussed in Sections 7 and 8.
REMARK 2.1. For an extended derivation of the equations of thermoelasticity see
Carlson [17].
As stated in the above, the balance laws of mass, momentum and energy, as well as the
Clausius–Duhem inequality, admit equivalent Eulerian descriptions. In Eulerian coordi-
nates (t,X), the balance laws (2.1)–(2.3) for a compressible viscous heat-conducting ﬂuid
with b = 0 and r = 0 can be written:
∂tρ + divX(ρu) = 0,

Here ρ and u = (u1,...,un) denote the density and velocity of the ﬂuid respectively, being
functions of Eulerian coordinates (t,X), E := ρ|u|2/2 + ρe denotes the total energy, e is

the speciﬁc internal energy, and q is the heat ﬂux, P is the pressure, T denotes the viscous
stress tensor of the form for a Newtonian ﬂuid:
Tij = λdivX uδij + 2μDij,
(2.17)
λ and μ are the constant viscosity coefﬁcients satisfying μ > 0, λ + 2μ/n ⩾0, and
D = {Dij } is the deformation tensor

.
The system (2.14)–(2.16) is also called the Navier–Stokes equations for compressible
heat-conducting ﬂuids in Rn which describe the motion of a compressible viscous heat-
conducting gas. It can be seen that the relations between ρ,q,T and ρc,Q,%S are given
by
ρ = (detF)−1ρc,
q = (detF)−1QF ′,
−P id+T = (detF)−1%SF ′.
In view of thermodynamics (cf. the constitutive relations (2.9)) we have the thermody-
namic equations of the state e = ˆe(ρ,θ), P = ˆp(ρ,θ) with the known functions ˆe and ˆp,
where θ denotes the absolute temperature. In this chapter we restrict our study to the phys-
ical situation where e,P,q have the form
e = cV θ,
P = Rρθ
(polytropic ideal gas),
q = −κ∇θ
(Fourier’s law),
(2.18)
where R,cV and κ are positive constants.
Substituting (2.17) and (2.18) into (2.14)–(2.16), we obtain the complete system for the
unknowns ρ,u,θ in Eulerian coordinates (t,X):
∂tρ + div(ρu) = 0,
(2.19)
∂t(ρu) + div(ρu ⊗u) + R∇(ρθ) = μu + (λ + μ)∇divu,

(2.21)
where the differential operators div,∇and  are with respect to the Eulerian coordinate X.
In the case of isentropic ideal gases, the system (2.19)–(2.21) turns to (see, e.g., [145]):
∂tρ + div(ρu) = 0,
(2.22)

where γ ⩾1 is the speciﬁc heat ratio and a a positive constant. The multidimensional
theory for the compressible isentropic Navier–Stokes equations (2.22) and (2.23) is the
main issue in Section 6.
It can be easily seen that both (2.19)–(2.21) and (2.22), (2.23) are hyperbolic–parabolic
coupled systems in which there is dissipation induced by viscosity and heat-diffusion.
Finally, we introduce some notation used throughout this chapter.
NOTATION. Let Ω be a domain in Rn. Let m be an integer and let 1 ⩽p ⩽∞. By
W m,p(Ω) (W m,p
0
(Ω)) we denote the usual Sobolev space deﬁned over Ω. W m,2(Ω) ≡
H m(Ω) (W m,2
0
(Ω) ≡H m
0 (Ω)), W 0,p(Ω) ≡Lp(Ω) with norm ∥· ∥Lp(Ω). Lp(I,B) resp.
∥· ∥Lp(I,B) denotes the space of all strongly measurable, pth-power integrable (essentially
bounded if p = ∞) functions from I to B resp. its norm, I ⊂R an interval, B a Banach
space. C(I,B) (or C0(I,B)) is the space of all functions which are continuous on I with
values in B. C(I,B −w) denotes the space of all functions which are in L∞(I,B) and
continuous on I with values in B endowed with the weak topology.
Unless there is a statement to the contrary, the Einstein summation convention (i.e.,
repeated indices indicate summation) is used, and a prime “ ′ ” denotes transposition. For
simplicity, we use the abbreviations:
∥· ∥≡∥· ∥L2(Ω),
∥· ∥Lp ≡∥· ∥Lp(Ω),
∥· ∥W m,p ≡∥· ∥W m,p(Ω),
∥· ∥H m ≡∥· ∥H m(Ω),
⟨h⟩2
∂Ω ≡h2|x=1 + h2|x=0
when Ω = (0,1);
D ≡(∂t,∇).
3. Globally deﬁned solutions for one-dimensional continuum medium with large
smooth initial data
The intent of this section is to elucidate the role of dissipation in the continuum physics,
i.e., the inﬂuence of dissipation mechanism on the qualitative behavior of solutions.
Within the framework of thermomechanics, the referential (Lagrangian) description of
the balance laws of mass, momentum and energy for one-dimensional materials with ref-
erence density ρc = 1 can be written, due to the discussion in Section 2, as
⎧

where v,u,e,σ,η,θ and q (≡Q in Section 2) denote deformation gradient (speciﬁc
volume), velocity, internal energy, stress, speciﬁc entropy, temperature and heat ﬂux, re-
spectively. Note that v,e and θ may only take positive values.

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems
297
For one-dimensional, homogeneous, thermoviscoelastic materials, internal energy,
stress, entropy and heat ﬂux are given by the constitutive relations
e = ˆe(v,θ),
σ = ˆσ(v,θ,ux),
η = ˆη(u,θ),
q = ˆq(v,θ,θx),
which, in order to comply with (3.2), must satisfy
ˆσ(v,θ,0) = ˆψv(v,θ),
ˆη(v,θ) = −ˆψθ(v,θ),
 ˆσ(v,θ,w) −ˆσ(v,θ,0)	w ⩾0,
ˆq(v,θ,g)g ⩽0,
(3.3)
where ψ = e −θη is the Helmholtz free energy.
A typical problem is to consider a body with reference conﬁguration the interval [0,1]
whose boundary is stress-free and thermally insulated,
σ(t,0) = σ(t,1) = 0,
q(t,0) = q(t,1) = 0,
0 ⩽t < ∞,
(3.4)
and determine the thermomechanical process, described by the functions (v(t,x), u(t,x),
θ(t,x)), 0 ⩽x ⩽1, t ⩾0, under prescribed initial conditions
v(0,x) = v0(x),
u(0,x) = u0(x),
θ(0,x) = θ0(x),
0 ⩽x ⩽1.
(3.5)
In the absence of dissipation, when the body is a thermoelastic nonconductor, i.e.,
σ = −ˆp(v,θ),e = ˆe(v,θ),q ≡0, (3.1) reduces to a hyperbolic system of conservation
laws which does not generally possess globally deﬁned smooth solutions, even when the
initial data are very smooth.
The question is whether the combined dissipative effects of viscosity and thermal dif-
fusion, when the material is thermoviscoelastic, may counterbalance the destabilizing
inﬂuence of nonlinearity and thus induce the existence of globally deﬁned smooth solu-
tions to the initial-boundary value problem (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) even for large initial data.
This is ﬁrst veriﬁed by Kazhikhov and Shelukhin [137,139] for the case where the ma-
terial is an ideal, linearly viscous, gas with constant speciﬁc heats:
e = cV θ,
σ = −R θ
v + μux
v ,
q = −k θx
v ,
by means of an interesting analysis which depends crucially on the special form of the
above constitutive assumption. For the case of ideal gases, the global existence of smooth
or strong solutions to initial boundary value problems or to the Cauchy problem, with
large initial data have been investigated also by Antontsev, Kazhikhov and Monakhov
in [10,137,138], Kawashima and Nishida in [134], Nagasawa in [169–171], Iskenderova,
Smagulov, Durmagambetov [103,209] (also cf. the references cited therein), etc.

The corresponding results for the material of real gases have been obtained by
Kawohl [140], Jiang [109,115], Luo [153,154], Pan [182], Amosov [3], Qin [186], Qin
and Rivera [187], etc.
On the other hand, Dafermos and Hsiao in [34] and Dafermos in [31] considered the
problem (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) for a fairly general class of solid like linearly viscous materials,
e = ˆe(v,θ),
σ = −ˆp(v,θ) + μux,
q = ˆq(v,θ,θx).
In the paper [34], shear viscosity μv is inversely proportional to density. Consequently,
its dissipative effect is so weak at high density that existence of global solutions is to
be expected only when the initial energy is not too large. To overcome this limitation,
Dafermos [31] considers the problem (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) for linearly viscous materials
e = ˆe(v,θ),
σ = −ˆp(v,θ) + ˆμ(v)ux,
q = −ˆk(v,θ)θx,
(3.6)
where the viscosity ˆμ(v)v is uniformly positive, that is,
ˆμ(v)v ⩾μ0 > 0,
0 < v < ∞.
(3.7)
REMARK 3.1. In the case when viscosity may depend on temperature, a typical prob-
lem to understand the effect, caused by the dependence of viscosity on temperature, has
been studied ﬁrst by Dafermos and Hsiao in [35] for adiabatic shearing of incompressible
ﬂow. See, e.g., Tzavaras [218,219], Belov and Belov [14], Bertsch, Peletier and Verduyn
Lunels [15] and Jiang [111] for related results, and among others.
Assume that ˆe(v,θ), ˆp(v,θ), ˆμ(v) and ˆk(v,θ) are twice continuously differentiable on
0 < v < ∞, 0 ⩽θ < ∞, and are interrelated by
ˆev(v,θ) = −ˆp(v,θ) + θ ˆpθ(v,θ),
(3.8)
so as to comply with (3.3). Furthermore, we require that, at any temperature, the elastic
part of the stress is compressive at high density and tensile at low density, i.e., there are
0 < ˜v ⩽%
V < ∞such that
ˆp(v,θ) ⩾0,
0 < v < ˜v,0 ⩽θ < ∞,
ˆp(v,θ) ⩽0,
%
V < v < ∞,0 ⩽θ < ∞.
(3.9)
Employing an idea of Andrews [7], it can be shown, as a consequence of (3.7) and (3.9),
that the deformation gradient is a priori conﬁned in a bounded interval 0 < ¯v <
v(t,x) < 
V and, hence, no restrictions are necessary on the behavior of ˆe(v,θ), ˆp(v,θ),
ˆk(v,θ) at v = 0+ and v = ∞. As regards growth with respect to temperature, we assume
that, for any 0 < ¯v < 
V < ∞, there are positive constants ν,k0 and N, possibly depending

(An explanation on the above growth rates can be found in [31].)
The existence theorem established in [31] reads as the following:
THEOREM 3.1. Consider the initial-boundary value problem (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) under con-
ditions (3.6)–(3.12).Assume that v0(x), v′
0(x), u0(x), u′
0(x), u′′
0(x), θ0(x), θ′
0(x) and θ′′
0 (x)
are all in Cα([0,1]) and v0(x) > 0, θ0(x) > 0, 0 ⩽x ⩽1. Furthermore, let the initial data
be compatible with the boundary conditions at (0,0) and (1,0). Then there exists a unique
solution {v(t,x),u(t,x),θ(t,x)} on [0,1] × [0,∞) such that, for any T > 0, the func-
tions v, vx, vt, vxt, u, ux, ut, uxx, θ, θx, θxx are all in Cα,α/2(QT ) and vtt, vxt, θxt are
in L2(QT ). Moreover, θ(t,x) > 0, ¯v < v(t,x) < 
V , for 0 ⩽x ⩽1, 0 ⩽t < ∞, where
¯v and 
V are positive constants depending on the initial data, Cα([0,1]) denotes the Ba-
nach space of functions on [0,1] which are uniformly Hölder continuous with exponent α,
while Cα,α/2(QT ) stands for the Banach space of functions on QT = [0,T ] × [0,1] which
are uniformly Hölder continuous with exponent α in x and α/2 in t.
The theorem can be proved by the procedure devised by Dafermos and Hsiao in [34],
namely, solutions to (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) are visualized as ﬁxed points of a map P on
the Banach space B of functions {V (t,x),U(t,x),Θ(t,x)} with V, U, Ux, Θ, Θx in
C1/3,1/6(QT ) and existence is established by means of the Leray–Schauder ﬁxed point
theorem.
The map P carries {V (t,x),U(t,x),Θ(t,x)} into the solution of a complicated linear
“parabolic” system obtained by linearizing (3.1) about {V (t,x),U(t,x),Θ(t,x)}. Due to
the smoothing action of linear parabolic systems, P is completely continuous and its range
is contained in the set of functions {v(t,x),u(t,x),θ(t,x)} with v, vx, vt, vxt, u, ux, ut,
uxx, θ, θx, θt, θxx, in Cα,α/2(QT ).
The construction of P and the precise statements and proofs of its aforementioned prop-
erties can be found in [34]. The detailed discussion to show that any possible ﬁxed point
of P , i.e., any solution {v(t,x),u(t,x),θ(t,x)} of (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) satisﬁes the admissi-
bility condition θ(t,x) > 0, 0 < ¯v < v(t,x) < 
V and is contained in an a priori bounded
set of B can be found in [31] and [99]. This will complete the list of requirements for the
application of the Leray–Schauder ﬁxed point theorem.
The global existence with different boundary conditions to (3.4) have been obtained later
by Jiang [108], Watson [228], Amosov [2], Guo and Zhu [76], etc.
For the study on other thermoviscoelastic systems related to (3.1) (for instance, the
systems for a viscous reactive gas, and shape memory alloys, etc.), we refer to Guo and
Zhu [77], Chen and Hoffmann [26], Shen, Zheng and Zhu [204], Jiang [113], Bressan [16],

The next emphasis of this section is to understand the inﬂuence of dissipation on the
large-time behavior of solutions. Various phenomena may occur on the large-time behavior
of solutions corresponding to different materials in consideration. For instance, with the
same boundary conditions as stress-free and thermally insulated, the solution may go to
inﬁnity as t →∞with certain rate, may approach to a unique state exponentially fast or
may have phase transition phenomena, according to different kind of constitutive relations
to be concerned.
Consider the problem (3.1), (3.4), (3.5). For the material of ideal gas, it has been proved
by Nagasawa in [169] that the solution (v∗,u∗,θ∗) of (3.1), (3.4), (3.5) satisﬁes
v∗(t,x) ⩾C∗log(1 + t),
C∗> 0.
However, totally different phenomena may occur on the large-time behavior of solutions
for other kind of constitutive relations. In the case of isothermal viscoelasticity, the solution
may approach to a unique state exponentially fast as shown by Greenberg and MacCamy
in [74], or phase transition may take place as discovered by Andrews and Ball in [8] with
nonmonotone pressure. It is proved in [8] that the large-time behavior of strain is described
by a Young measure whose support is conﬁned in the set of zeros of pressure. The analysis
used in [74] and [8] is extended to the nonisothermal case by Hsiao and Luo in [102] to
deal with thermoviscoelastic materials.
For simplicity, we consider the kind of solid-like materials with the following constitu-
tive relations
e = cV θ,
σ = −f (v)θ + ˆμ(v)ux,
q = −k(v)θx,
(3.13)
where cV is a positive constant, k(v) and f (v) are twice continuously differentiable
for v > 0 such that
k(v) > 0
for v > 0,
f (v) ⩾0,
0 < v < ˜v,
f (v) ⩽0,
%
V < v < ∞,
(3.14)
for some ﬁxed 0 < ˜v ⩽%
V < ∞, and the viscosity ˆμ(v)v is uniformly positive, namely
ˆμ(v)v ⩾μ0 > 0,
0 < v < ∞.
(3.15)
REMARK 3.2. The example proposed by Ericksen [52] shows that f (v) is not monotone
in v and satisﬁes (3.14). For rubber, it is known that a good model of pressure takes the
form
ˆp(v,θ) = −γ θ

v −1


,
γ is a positive constant,
namely, f (v) = −γ (v −1/v2) which satisﬁes (3.14) with ˜v = %
V = 1.

(3.16)
The global existence of (3.1), (3.4), (3.5), under the assumptions of (3.13)–(3.16), has
been obtained in [31] (also see [99]), which concerns the solid-like material with more
general constitutive relations than (3.13), as stated in Theorem 3.1.
The result on large-time behavior of solutions, obtained in [102], is stated as the follow-
ing theorem.

(t,x) ∈[0,1] × [0,∞) be the globally deﬁned smooth solution of the problem (3.1),
(3.4), (3.5) obtained in the Theorem 3.1. Then, as t →∞,

Thus, we have further results as the following theorem.

REMARK 3.3. Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.5 generalize the results obtained in
[8] and [74], respectively, which concern the case of isothermal viscoelasticity.
We only give the proof of Theorem 3.2 next.
PROOF OF THEOREM 3.2. Let {u(t,x),v(t,x),θ(t,x)} denote the solution obtained in
the global existence theorem from which it is known that
0 < ¯v ⩽v(t,x) ⩽
V ,
θ(t,x) > 0,
x ∈[0,1],t ∈[0,∞).
(3.18)
This, combined with (3.15), yields
0 < μ1 ⩽ˆμv(t,x)	 ⩽μ2,
x ∈[0,1],t ∈[0,∞),k1 ⩽k(v) ⩽k2,
(3.19)
where μ1, μ2, k1 and k2 are positive constants, independent of t.
In the sequel, Λ will denote a generic constant, independent of t.
The conservation laws of total momentum and energy can be easily obtained, namely

This together with (3.39) implies (3.40) directly. The limit (3.41) follows from (3.25)
and (3.40) easily. Thus, the part I of Theorem 3.2 is established by the above estimates.
Next, we employ an idea of Andrews and Ball (see [8]) and the above results to prove
the part II of Theorem 3.2.
Suppose Ψ ∈L2(0,1) with Ψ ⩾0 and Φ ∈C2([¯v, 

Φ′(t)f (z) ⩾0
for z ∈

for x ∈[0,1],t ⩾0.
Multiplying (3.1)2 with ϕ and integrating over [0,t] × [0,1] and using the boundary con-
ditions (3.4), we get, with the help of (3.1) and integration by parts, that

(3.43)
where “ ′ ” denotes the differentiation with respect to v.
To show the existence of the limit of the left-hand side of (3.43) as t →∞, we estimate
each term on the right-hand side of (3.43).
For the ﬁrst term, it is easy to see that

which tends to zero as t →∞, due to (3.37).

for all t ⩾0.
Therefore, the limit of the third term as t →∞exists by (3.24), (3.30) and the dominated
convergence theorem.
It is obvious that the term μ0

since (3.18). Thus, the above estimates imply that

is bounded uniformly in t ⩾0. This, together with (3.42), (3.2) and θ > 0, yields the
existence of

Ψ (x)Φv(t,x)	(τ,x)dx
for all Ψ ∈L2(0,1) with Ψ ⩾0, is established since each term in (3.43), apart from
 1
0 Ψ (x)Φ(v(t,x))(τ,x)dx, is either independent of t or tends to a limit as t →∞. There-
fore, it follows that
Φ

v(t,·)
	
⇀gΦ(·)
in L2(0,1),
as t →∞, for some gΦ ∈L2(0,1).
In view of ∥Φ(v(t,·))∥L∞⩽Λ, we can show that
gΦ ∈L∞(0,1)
and
Φ

v(t,·)
	 ∗⇀gΦ(·)
in L∞(0,1).
(3.44)
Now, let Φ ∈C([¯v, 
V ]) be arbitrary and Ψ ∈L1(0,1). By using the same method in [8]
and the following Lemma 3.6 (which can be proved by the same argument as used for
Lemma 3.1 in [8]), it is easy to verify that
lim

exists for all Ψ ∈L1(0,1) and Φ ∈C([¯v, 

LEMMA 3.6. Let f ∈C(R) and let 0 < ¯v < 
V . Then the set

Φ ∈C2

V
	
: Φ′(z)f (z) ⩾0, if z ∈


is dense in C([¯v, 
V ]).
Thus, it turns that (3.44) holds for an arbitrary Ψ ∈C([¯v, 
V ]). The existence of proba-
bility measures νx follows from (3.44) and Theorem 5 in Tartar’s paper [216]. To prove that
suppνx ⊂K = {z: f (z) = 0} a.e., it sufﬁces to show if Φ is zero on K, then ⟨νx,Φ⟩= 0,
a.e. But, if Φ is zero on K, then Φ(v(t,·)) →0 in measure as t →∞due to (3.40).
Therefore, Φ(v(t,·)) ⇀0 in L∞(0,1) as t →∞, and hence ⟨νx,Φ⟩= 0, a.e., as required.
Thus, the proof of Theorem 3.2 is complete.
□
A similar result on large-time behavior of solutions has been established by Hsiao and
Jian in [100] to deal with the following boundary conditions
σ(t,0) = γ u(t,0),
σ(t,1) = −γ u(t,1),
θ(t,0) = θ(t,1) = T0,
t ⩾0,
where γ = 0 or γ = 1, and T0 > 0 is the reference temperature. Physically, the case with
γ = 1 represents that the endpoints of the interval [0,1] are connected to some sort of dash
pot.
Other study on the large-time behavior of solutions for thermoviscoelasticity can be
found in [194,204], etc.
REMARK 3.4. There is an extensive body of work in the isothermal setting, namely the
equations of viscoelasticity, which addresses the issues of unique global solvability and
temporal-asymptoticbehavior, see, for example, [7–9,30,68,75,130,184]and the references
therein.
The last part of this section is devoted to the study on various behavior of solutions corre-
sponding to different boundary conditions. Such understanding is quite important not only
in mathematical theory but also in applications. For instance, the outer pressure problem,
q(t,0) = q(t,1) = 0,
σ(t,0) = σ(t,1) = −R(t) < 0,
(3.45)
with the outer pressure R(t) being a given function, possesses a completely different large-
time behavior comparing to the problem with classical homogeneous boundary conditions,
e.g.,
q(t,0) = q(t,1) = 0,
σ(t,0) = σ(t,1) = 0,
which has been discussed before. We mention that there are a number of articles dedicating
to the study of the large-time behavior of strong or smooth solutions to initial boundary

value problem with the classical homogeneous boundary conditions and to the Cauchy
problem, we refer, for example, to [10,19,62,116,117,172].
For the outer pressure problem, the large-time behavior is analyzed by Nagasawa [171]
for an ideal gas, by Hsiao and Luo [101] for a real gas, and by Ducomet [42,45] for models
of real reactive ﬂuids arising from astrophysics.
The global existence for the outer pressure problem has been obtained by
Nagasawa [170] and Luo [154], corresponding to the case of an ideal gas and real gas,
respectively.
A real gas is well approximated by an ideal gas within moderate ranges of θ and v.
However, it becomes inadequate for high temperature and density, since the speciﬁc heat,
conductivity and viscosity vary with temperature and density.
The result on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to (3.1), (3.5), (3.45), established
in [101], is for a real gas with the following constitutive relations:
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
σ = −ˆp(v,θ) + μ(v,θ)
v
ux,
q = −k(v,θ)
v
θx,
e = ˆe(v,θ),
(3.46)
where ˆe(v,θ), ˆp(v,θ), μ(v,θ), and k(v,θ) are twice continuously differentiable on
0 < v < ∞and 0 ⩽θ < ∞.
Since the internal energy may only take nonnegative values, we assume
ˆe(v,θ) ⩾0,
0 < v < ∞,0 ⩽θ < ∞.
(3.47)
For compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics (3.2), we need μ(v,θ) > 0,
k(v,θ) ⩾0 and (3.8).
Finally, we impose upon ˆe(v,θ), ˆp(v,θ) and k(v,θ) the following growth condition:
there are exponents r ∈[0,1], s ⩾2 + 2r and positive constants ν, k0,pi (i = 1,2,3,4),
and there are positive constants N(v ) and k1(v ) for any v > 0 such that, for any v ⩾v

The above assumptions are motivated by the facts in [13] and [236]. In these books, it is
pointed out that ˆe grows as θ1+r with r ≈0.5 and k increases like θs with 4.5 ⩽s ⩽5.5.
For simplicity, we only discuss the case of
μ(v,θ) ≡μ0 > 0.
(3.54)
For the outer pressure R(t), we assume that

(3.56)
which implies that there exist 
R and MR such that 
R = limt→∞R(t) > 0 and 0 < MR =
supt∈[0,∞) R(t) < ∞.
The initial data are normalized as in (3.16) and compatible with the boundary condi-
tions (3.45).
The global existence of smooth solutions to the initial-boundary problem (3.1), (3.5),
(3.45) is established in [154] under the above assumptions. The theorem on the asymptotic
behavior of solutions, established in [101], is stated as
THEOREM 3.7. Under the assumptions (3.46)–(3.56) and (3.16), it holds, for the globally
deﬁned solution of (3.1), (3.5), (3.45), that

REMARK 3.5. In contrast with the case of R(t) ≡0, in which the speciﬁc volume v
satisﬁes v(t,x) ⩾C(log(1 + t))¯k with some constants C > 0 and ¯k ⩾1 for the ideal
gas [169], (3.57) disclose that v(t,x) is uniformly bounded even for the ideal gas if the
boundary conditions are (3.45) instead of (3.4).
Equation (3.60) describes the asymptotic relation between v(t,x), θ(t,x) and R(t) as
t →∞. (3.61) can be understood as follows: With a weight function Y(τ)
Y(t) v(τ,x), the
weighted average of [ ˆp(v,θ)(τ,x) −R(τ)] over [0,t] tends to zero as t →∞, uniformly
in x ∈[0,1]. For the weight function, it is known that

PROOF OF THEOREM 3.7. For the proof, we need a sequence of estimates to which we
give an outline in Steps (1)–(6). The detail can be found in [101] and [99].

where C is a generic constant independent of t.
It is easy to get (3.62) and (3.63). To establish (3.64), we need some estimates related to
the Helmholtz free energy function.
Let ψ(v,θ) = ˆe(v,θ)−θη(v,θ) denote the Helmholtz free energy function. It is known
from (3.3) that (see (2.9))
−ψθ(v,θ) = η(v,θ),
ψv(v,θ) = −ˆp(v,θ),
ψθθ(v,θ) = −ˆeθ(v,θ)
θ
.
(3.65)
Deﬁne
E(v,θ) = ψ(v,θ) −ψ(1,1) −ψv(1,1)(v −1) −ψθ(v,θ)(θ −1).
It can be shown, on account of (3.1), (3.46), (3.65), (3.45), (3.54), (3.55) and (3.63), that

(3.66)
In view of (3.48), (3.49) and (3.65), it follows from Taylor’s theorem that
E(v,θ) −ψ(v,θ) + ψ(v,1) + (θ −1)ψθ(v,θ) ⩾0,
ψ(v,θ) −ψ(v,1) −(θ −1)ψθ(v,θ)

ν(θ −logθ −1),
r = 0,
θr+1

r > 0.
Thus,
E(v,θ) ⩾ν(θ −logθ −1),
r = 0,
(3.67)
or
E(v,θ) ⩾Cθ + Cθ1+r −C + ν(θ −logθ −1),
0 < r ⩽1.
(3.68)
This, together with (3.66), yields (3.64).
Step (2).
Let α and β be the two positive roots of equation
θ −logθ −1 = C0
ν ,

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems
315
where C0 is the same positive constant as in (3.66). Then, there exists an a(t) ∈[0,1] for
each t ⩾0 such that
0 < α ⩽θ

a(t),t
	
⩽β.
(3.69)
Furthermore, it holds, for any t ⩾0, that
α ⩽

0
θ(t,x)dx ⩽β.
(3.70)
It is clear that (3.66)–(3.68) yield

θ(t,x) −logθ(t,x) −1

dx ⩽C0,

(3.71)
from which (3.69) follows. Using (3.71) and applying Jensen’s inequality to the convex
function U −logU −1, we deduce
 1
0
θ(t,x)dx −log
 1
0
θ(t,x)dx −1 ⩽C0
ν ,
which implies (3.71).
Step (3).
There exist positive constants v > 0 and ¯v > 0, independent of t, such that for
any (t,x) ∈[0,∞) × [0,1] it holds
v ⩽v(t,x) ⩽¯v.
(3.72)
To prove (3.72), we ﬁnd the expression of v(t,x) ﬁrst, namely
v(t,x) =
v0(x) + 1
μ0
 t

Next, we establish the upper bound of v. With the help of (3.64), it is easy to estimate
B(t,x) as follows
0 < C−1 ⩽B(t,x) ⩽C
for (t,x) ∈[0,∞) × [0,1].

With a similar approach, we can claim that the third term in (3.100) tends to zero as well

□
Another kind of boundary condition is discussed by Jiang in [110] and Wang in [226],
namely,
θx(t,0) = θx(t,1) = 0,
u(t,0) = u(t,1) = 0,
t > 0.
(3.101)
In [110] the exponential stability as t →∞of smooth solutions is obtained, while
in [226] the main issue in the analysis is whether shock waves, vacuum, and concentra-
tion will be developed in the solutions in ﬁnite time without outer pressure, provided that
the initial data are bounded, smooth, and do not contain vacuum. For the solutions with
large initial data in H 1, it is shown that neither shock waves nor vacuum and concentration
will be developed in ﬁnite time. This is also true for a free boundary condition (see [226]).
Related results are given by Ducomet, Zlotnik in a series of papers [40,42,43,45,46,49]
on models with nonmonotone pressure arising from astrophysics and nuclear physics,
where the global existence and time-asymptotic behavior of solutions to initial boundary
value problems with classical and outer pressure boundary conditions are investigated. We
also mention the work by Frid and Shelukhin [67,201,202] where the limit of zero shear
viscosity for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations is studied.
4. Globally deﬁned weak solutions for one-dimensional compressible ﬂow with large
discontinuous initial data
We discuss the one-dimensional isentropic viscous ﬂow ﬁrst in this section and turn to the
nonisentropic case in the second part.
Consider the global existence of weak solutions to the classical Navier–Stokes equations
with external force for one-dimensionalisentropic compressible ﬂow, which can be written,
due to the discussion in Section 2, as

Here ρ and u denote the ﬂuid density and velocity, μ is a positive viscosity constant, and
f = f (t,x) is the external force. P = P(ρ) is the pressure, satisfying
P(ρ),

The proof of Theorem 4.1 consists of four steps.
The ﬁrst three are related to getting the a priori estimates for smooth solutions of (4.1)
with smooth initial data satisfying (4.8), (4.9). That is, to give a bound for ∥ρ(u −¯u)2 +
G(ρ, ¯ρ)∥L1 ﬁrst, which expresses the total energy in the ﬂuid, at least for the special case
when the functions ¯u and ¯ρ are constant. Namely,

t ∈[0,T ], x ∈R.
(4.11)

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems
325
The proof is based on the hyperbolicity which serves to control the growth of ρ along
particle trajectories. These pointwise bounds can be used then to exploit the parabolicity
of the second equation in (4.1) to derive certain higher order regularity estimates for u:

(4.18)
It should be pointed out that the bound given for the quantity μux −P(ρ) has a special
interest. It is known (see [80], for example) that initial discontinuities in ρ persist for
all time, so that ρ(t,·) and ux(t,·) may be locally integrable but no smoother. On the
other hand, the fact that μux −P(ρ) is in H 1
loc →C1/2 evidently implies a cancellation
of singularities. This cancellation of singularities can be shown to prevent oscillations in
weakly converging sequences of solutions of (4.1). These ideas are carried out in the last
step where the proof of Theorem 4.1 is completed by obtaining the solution (ρ,u) as the
strong limit of approximate solutions corresponding to molliﬁed initial data.
More precisely, let (ρ0,u0) be the initial data required in the theorem and deﬁne ρδ
0 =
jδ ∗ρ0, uδ
0 = jδ ∗u0, where jδ(x) = δ−1j(x/δ) is the standard molliﬁer. The estimates
of (4.10)–(4.18) can show that the corresponding smooth solutions (ρδ,uδ) of (4.1) with
initial data (ρδ
0,uδ
0) exist for all time and satisfy all the estimates of (4.10)–(4.18) with
constants C(T ) independent of δ. It can be easily shown that there is a subsequence δ →0,
for which
⎧
⎨
⎩
uδ →u,
uniformly on compact sets in R × (0,∞),
uδ(t,·) −u(t,·) →0,
strongly in L2(R),t ⩾0,
uδ
x(t,·) −ux(t,·) ⇀0,
weakly in L2(R),t ⩾0.
(4.19)
The limiting function u keeps all the above bounds which pertain to u and ux. Although
we could obtain a subsequence for which ρδ converges weakly to a function ρ, but we
could not guarantee that P(ρδ) converges, even weakly, to P(ρ). Therefore we are not

326

able to conclude that the limiting pair (ρ,u) is a weak solution of (4.1). We are required to
obtain the density ρ as a strong limit of ρδ. In fact, it can be proved that there is a further

REMARK 4.3. An important consequence of Theorem 4.1 is that neither vacuum nor con-
centration can occur in this solution, no matter how large the external force or how large
the oscillation of the initial data is.
The recent progress obtained in [94] is motivated by the above result. It is proved by
Hoff and Smoller [94], for the system (4.1) with more general pressure P and weaker
requirement on the external force, that weak solutions of the system (4.1) do not exhibit
vacuum state, provided that no vacuum states are present initially. The solutions and ex-
ternal forces considered are quite general: the essential requirements are that the mass and
energy densities of the ﬂuid be locally integrable at each time, and that the L2
loc−norm
of the velocity gradient be locally integrable in time. It shows that if a vacuum state were
to occur, the viscous force would impose an impulse of inﬁnite magnitude on the adjacent
ﬂuid, thus violating the hypothesis that the momentum remains locally ﬁnite.
The initial-value problem of (4.1), (4.2) has been studied by many people. See, for exam-
ple, Kanel [130], Serre [198] and Hoff [81,88] for the existence of solutions with constant
time-asymptotic states. Also see Liu [149], Hoff and Liu [92], Liu and Xin [150], Szepessy
and Xin [214], Xin [229], Matsumura and Nishihara [160] and [161] for the cases in which
the time-asymptotic state contains a viscous shock or rarefaction wave, usually of small
strength. Finally, there are a large number of results concerning solutions of (4.1) on a ﬁnite
interval with suitable boundary conditions, for example, Hoff and Ziane [96], Matsumura
and Yanagi [162], Shelukhin [200], Ducomet, Straškraba, Valli, Zlotnik [48,211–213,243,
247,248], Nishida [176, survey article] and the references contained in these papers. See
also Hoff and Zarnowski [95], Hoff [87] and Hoff and Ziane [96] for uniqueness and con-
tinuous dependence results for solutions with strictly positive densities.
Let us turn to the nonisentropic case next. We consider the Navier–Stokes equations
for compressible, heat-conducting ﬂow in one space dimension with large, discontinuous
initial data.
The equations under consideration describe the conservation of mass and momentum
and the balance of energy, and take the following form in Lagrangian coordinates

sure, respectively; μ and λ are the ﬁxed positive viscosity and heat conductivity parameters
respectively; and x is the Lagrangian coordinate, so that x = constant corresponds to a par-
ticle trajectory.
We ﬁrst discuss the case with the equation of state for an ideal, polytropic ﬂuid:
e =

γ −1 = cV θ,
(4.22)
where θ is the temperature, and γ > 1 and cV > 0 are constants.
Consider the following initial-boundary value problem for (4.21) with boundary condi-
tions

ex(t,0) = ex(t,1) = 0,

The result on well-posedness and large-time behavior of solutions to (4.21)–(4.25),given
by Chen, Hoff and Trivisa in [22], is states as the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.2. Given initial data (v0,u0,e0) satisfying (4.25), there is a global weak
solution (v,u,e) such that v,u ∈C([0,∞),L2(0,1)), e ∈C([0,∞),L2(0,1)) with
e(t,·) ⇀e0 weakly in L2(0,1) as t →0. Furthermore, there is a positive constant M
depending on C0, but independent of t > 0, such that the following hold:

The proof of this theorem contains two important steps. In the ﬁrst, it is assumed that
v0 is piecewise H 1, having a ﬁnite number of points of discontinuity. Solutions for this case
can be obtained as the limits of approximate solutions derived from a suitable semidiscrete
difference approximation to (4.21). Then in the second step, the uniform total variation
estimate (4.27) is exploited to complete the solution operator for the more general case
that v0 ∈BV . The result in [22] has improved those in [82,83] by allowing for large,
discontinuous initial data, and by obtaining estimates (4.26)–(4.29) which are independent
of time and can be used to show the large-time behavior of solutions. The crucial point
involved here is to get pointwise upper and lower bounds for the speciﬁc volume v. The
idea of Kazhikhov and Shelukhin in [139] with elaborating on it in a new way, is used in
the derivation of these bounds.
REMARK 4.4. The pointwise bounds in (4.26) for the speciﬁc volume (equivalently, the
density) show that neither vacuum nor concentration states occur, no matter how large
the initial data is. This is one of several important differences between the Navier–Stokes
equations and the inviscid Euler equations, for which vacuum states may take place for
large initial data with certain equations of state (cf. [18,21]).
With the help of these pointwise bounds (4.26) on v, the higher-order regularity
assertions of Theorem 4.2 can be obtained similarly as in [82,83]. The asymptotic behav-
ior (4.30) can be derived as a consequence of the time-independent bounds (4.26)–(4.29).
The construction of solutions for the intermediate case when v0 is piecewise H 1, used
as the ﬁrst step in the proof of Theorem 4.2, plays an important role. For this case some
interesting observations concerning the propagation of singularities can be made.

Let v0
be piecewise smooth, having jump discontinuities at isolated points
y1 < ··· < yN. Then we could ﬁnd at the heuristic level that discontinuities in v,p,ux
and ex occur only at x = yi, and satisfy the following jump condition
!

(4.31)
where [w] denotes a jump of the function w across x = yi: [w(t,yi)] = w(t,yi + 0) −
w(t,yi −0).
From (4.31), it follows, with the help of the ﬁrst equation in (4.21) that
[logv]t = μ−1[p] = γ −1

.
Therefore the exponential decay of the magnitudes of these discontinuities as t →∞can
be anticipated, since e is positive and 1/v is a decreasing function of logv. In fact, this is
indeed true, as proved in [22] in the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.3. Assume, in addition to the hypotheses of Theorem 4.2, that v0 is piece-
wise H 1, having isolated jump discontinuities at points y1 < ··· < yN. Then, for t > 0,
each of the quantities v(t,·), p(t,·), ux(t,·) and ex(t,·) has one-sided limits at each yi,
and the jump conditions (4.31) are satisﬁed in a strict pointwise sense. Moreover,

As far as uniqueness is concerned, it is a rather delicate issue for the kind of general
solutions as in Theorem 4.2, due to the absence of uniform regularity in the initial layer
near t = 0. However, we can improve the smoothing rates implicit in the deﬁnitions of
E(t) and F(t) sufﬁciently, by proposing slightly stronger conditions on u0 and e0, to prove
that solutions are indeed unique and depend continuously on their initial values.
THEOREM 4.4 (Regularity and stability). Assume, in addition to the hypotheses of Theo-
rem 4.2, that
T V (u0) + T V (e0) ⩽C0.

(4.32)
Moreover, solutions satisfying (4.26)–(4.29) and (4.32) are unique and depend continu-
ously on their initial data in the sense that, if (v1,u1,e1) and (v2,u2,e2) are any two such
solutions, and if S(t) is deﬁned by

where α and β are small and positive constants, then given T > 0, there is a constant C(T )
such that, for 0 ⩽t ⩽T ,
S(t) ⩽C(T )S(0).
REMARK 4.5. The results of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 can be converted to equivalent state-
ments for the Navier–Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates for which we still use (t,x)
to denote the time and space variable

where E = e + u2/2 is the total speciﬁc energy.
However, the corresponding statements on uniqueness and continuous dependence are
more subtle in view of the fact that the change of variables from Lagrangian to Eulerian
coordinates is solution-dependent, and the solutions concerned are only minimally regular
(also see [126]).
The approach in [22] can also be applied to get the global well-posedness and large-time
behavior of discontinuous solutions with large initial data to the Navier–Stokes equations
for a compressible reacting ﬂow (see [21,23,29,72]).
The Navier–Stokes system (4.21) has been studied by a number of authors in a large va-
riety of contexts. See for example the earlier results of Kazhikhov and Shelukhin [139],
Serre [198], Hoff [83], also the results of Amosov and Zlotnick [4–6,244–246], Jiang
and Zhang [115,125], Fujita-Yashima, Padula and Novotný [71], Liu and Zeng [152] and
Wang [226], and the references contained in these papers.
In [226], the global existence of large discontinuous solutions with large discontinuous
data to the Navier–Stokes system (4.21) for perfect gases is established by a different ar-
gument which is achieved by ﬁrst mollifying the initial data and then using the estimates
obtained for continuous solutions (see the discussion in Section 3 and a convergence argu-
ment in [215,217]). The uniqueness and the Lipschitz continuous dependence on data of

weak solutions to initial boundary value problems in bounded intervals and to the Cauchy
problem are established in [4,244,245] and in [126], respectively.
5. Vacuum problem for one-dimensional compressible ﬂow
The one-dimensional isentropic viscous gas ﬂow is governed by the compressible Navier–
Stokes equations which can be written, in Eulerian coordinates, as (in the case without
external force)

(5.1)
due to the derivation given in Section 2, where x ∈R, t > 0; ρ, u and P(ρ) denote the den-
sity, velocity and pressure, respectively; μ ⩾0 is the viscosity coefﬁcient. For simplicity
we consider only the polytropic gas, i.e., P(ρ) = Aργ with γ > 1, A > 0 being constants.
We consider the case when μ(ρ) = μ > 0 is a constant ﬁrst. This corresponds to the
classical Navier–Stokes equations.
We are interested in the evolution of the interfaces separating the one-dimensional isen-
tropic viscous gases from vacuum when the gases are in contact with the vacuum on a ﬁnite
interval initially, with or without external force. This is a free boundary problem for which
the free boundaries are the interfaces separating the gases from vacuum.
Consider (5.1) with the initial data
ρ(0,x) = ρ0(x),
u(0,x) = u0(x).
(5.2)
The regularity and behavior of solutions of (5.1), (5.2) near the interfaces between the
gas and vacuum are investigated in [155] where it is assumed that the entire gas initially
occupies a ﬁnite interval (a,b) ⊂R1 and is in contact with the vacuum, with the following
assumptions:
(H1) ρ0 ∈C(R1), suppρ0 ⊂(a,b), ρ0(x) > 0 ∀x ∈(a,b);
(H2) ρk
0 ∈H 1([a,b]) for some constant 0 < k ⩽γ −1/2; and the initial velocity u0(x)
has the regularity as

THEOREM 5.1 [155]. Let ρ0 and u0 satisfy (H1)–(H3). Then the free boundary prob-

the solution (ρ(t,x),u(t,x)) has the properties:

It is important and interesting to investigate the regularity of the solution to the above
free boundary problem and the behavior near interfaces due to the degeneracy of vac-
uum. In general, it is not expected to have the global existence of the smooth solution
because of the degeneracy. However, we may expect the smoothness of the solution in the
region {(t,x): ρ(t,x) > 0} when the initial data have certain appropriate regularity and
the smoothness up to the boundary when the initial density is connected to vacuum smooth
enough. This is proved in [155] as the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.2 [155]. Let (ρ,u) be the weak solution to (5.4), obtained in Theorem 5.1.
It holds that:
(1) If ρα
0 (∂2
xρ0)2 ∈L1(a,b), then ρα1(∂2
xρ)2(t,·) ∈L1(a(t),b(t)) with α1 = 2k −3 +
max{2k + 3 + α,6k + 1}. And the weak solution (ρ,u) to (5.4) is smooth in the re-
gion Q =: {(t,x): 0 ⩽t < ∞,a(t) < x < b(t)} with ρ(t,·) ∈C1+λ(a(t),b(t)), u(t,·) ∈
C2+λ(a(t),b(t)) for some 0 < λ < 1 and any t > 0;
(2) uxx(t,a(t)+) = uxx(t,b(t)−) = 0 if k < 1/2; furthermore ρ(t,·) ∈H 2(a(t),b(t)),
0 ⩽t ⩽∞, if α ⩽−4k and k ⩽1/4, and this implies ρx is Hölder continuous in the whole
interval [a(t),b(t)] for any t ⩾0. Also, the gradient of the pressure satisﬁes

To prove Theorem 5.1, one converts the free boundary problem to a ﬁxed boundary
problem by using Lagrangian coordinates and obtains some basic estimates on the corre-
sponding initial-boundary value problem to which the global solution can be constructed
by a slight modiﬁcation of the method of lines used in [80,151,175,178,179].
Based on these estimates, the smoothness result in Theorem 5.2 can be obtained with the
L2-estimate of ρα/2ρxx which is crucial to the improvement of regularity of the solution.
Moreover, the uniqueness result holds.

THEOREM 5.3 [155]. Assume (H1)–(H3). Let (ρ1,u1) and (ρ2,u2) be two weak solu-
tions to the free boundary problem (5.4) in 0 ⩽t ⩽T as described in Deﬁnition 5.1. Then
(ρ1,u1)(t,x) = (ρ2,u2)(t,x) in a(t) < x < b(t) and 0 ⩽t ⩽T .
REMARK 5.1. The above results are stated for the case without external force. However,
similar results hold true also in the presence of external forces such as gravity.
The free boundary problem of the one-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations with one
boundary ﬁxed was investigated earlier by Okada in [178]; see also [175], where the global
existence of the weak solutions was proved and the regularity of (ρ1/2u,ux,ρ−1/2uxx) ×
(t,·) ∈L2, ρ ∈BV was obtained. Similar results were derived in [163] and [179] for
the equations of spherically symmetric motion of viscous gases. Furthermore, the free
boundary problem for the one-dimensional viscous gases which expand into the vacuum
has been studied a lot, see [178,179,230] and the references therein.
Other interesting results of free boundary problems related to the classical Navier–
Stokes equations can be found in [80,85,93,151], also in [4,5,10,88,198], etc.
We turn to the case when the viscosity coefﬁcient depends on the density, μ = μ(ρ),
instead of a positive constant. This modiﬁed Navier–Stokes system (5.1) was proposed
by Liu, Xin and Yang in [151] to study the one-dimensional isentropic viscous gas ﬂow
with vacuum states. This is motivated by certain considerations in both mathematics and
physics. When the viscosity coefﬁcient μ is a constant, the study in [93] shows the fail-
ure of the continuous dependence on the initial data of solutions to the compressible
Navier–Stokes equations with vacuum. As pointed out in [151], the main reason for this
noncontinuous dependence comes from the independence of the kinetic viscosity coefﬁ-
cient on the density. From the physical point of view, one can ﬁnd in the derivation of the
Navier–Stokes equations from the Boltzmann equations through the Chapman–Enskog ex-
pansion to the second order (cf. [73]) that the viscosity is not a constant but depends on the
temperature. For isentropic ﬂow, this dependence is translated into the dependence on the
density by the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac for ideal gases as discussed in [151].
For simplicity, we only discuss the polytropic gas
P(ρ) = Aργ
and assume that
μ(ρ) = Bρα,
(5.5)
where γ > 1, A > 0, B > 0, α > 0 are constants.
Now the viscosity coefﬁcient vanishes at vacuum. This property yields the well-
posedness of the Cauchy problem when the initial density is of compact support. In this
aspect, the local existence of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Navier–Stokes
equations with vacuum was studied in [151] and [156], where the initial density was as-
sumed to be connected to vacuum with discontinuities. This property can be maintained for
some ﬁnite time. Jiang [115] studied the Navier–Stokes equations for a one-dimensional
heat-conducting gas and proved the global existence of smooth solutions provided that

0 < α < 1/4 in (5.5). By using the techniques similar to those in [115] to derive a priori
estimates and the ﬁnite difference method, Okada, Matuš˙u-Neˇcasová and Makino [180]
obtained the existence of global weak solutions with isentropic ﬂow for 0 < α < 1/3. This
result has been improved to the case 0 < α < 1/2 by Yang, Yao and Zhu [233]. In both
[180] and [233] the initial data are required to satisfy ρ0, ∂xu0 ∈Lip[0,1].
Some new progress has been made by Jiang, Xin and Zhang [121] recently under
the conditions ρ0 ∈W 1,p(0,1), u0 ∈Lp(0,1) for some p and 0 < α < 1. Furthermore,
the uniqueness can be established provided u0 ∈H 1(0,1). This result improves those
in [180,233]. First, more general pressure laws can be dealt with in [121]. For example,
it is assumed in [180,233] that 1 < γ < 2 for the perfect ﬂuid to which α = (γ −1)/2,
while the more general situation with 1 < γ < 3 is allowed now. Second, less regularity of
the initial data is required.

To study the free boundary problem (5.1)–(5.6), it is convenient to convert the free bound-
aries to the ﬁxed boundaries by using Lagrangian coordinates. We introduce the coordinate
transformation
ξ =

ρ(t,y)dy,

where

 b

(5.6) becomes, with the notation (τ,ξ)

and the initial conditions
ρ(0,x),u(0,x)	 = ρ0(x),u0(x)	,
x ∈[0,1].
(5.9)
From the boundary conditions (5.8) it is known that for γ > α, ρ(t,0), ρ(t,1) =
O(t−1/(γ −α)) for large t. Hence, the density decreases as t grows. This causes the vis-
cosity (the stabilization mechanism) decreasing to zero, so that a solution may not exist
globally in time. It is shown in [121] that if μ(ρ) does not decrease to zero too rapidly, i.e.,
if α is not large, then a weak solution of (5.7)–(5.9) still exists globally in time. Moreover,
the uniqueness of the weak solution can be obtained under the additional regularity as-
sumption on initial data. More precisely, the result can be stated as the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.4. Assume 0 < α < 1, inf[0,1] ρ0 > 0, ρ0 ∈W 1,2n(0,1), u0 ∈L2n(0,1) for
some n ∈N satisfying n(2n −1)/(2n2 + 2n −1) > α. Then the problem (5.7)–(5.9) has a
global weak solution (ρ,u) in the sense that, for any T > 0,

for some positive constant C = C(∥ρ0∥W 1,2n,∥u0∥L2n,inf[0,1] ρ0,T ), and the following
equations hold:
ρt + ρ2ux = 0,
ρ(0,x) = ρ0(x)

in addition, u0 ∈H 1(0,1), then u satisﬁes the additional estimates:
u ∈L∞[0,T ],H 1(0,1)	 ∩L2[0,T ],H 2(0,1)	,
ut ∈L2

and furthermore, this weak solution is unique in the class:
ρ ∈L∞
[0,T ],H 1(0,1)
	
,
ρt ∈L2
[0,T ],L2(0,1)

u ∈L∞[0,T ],L2(0,1)	 ∩L2[0,T ],H 1(0,1)	,
ρ(t,x) > 0
on [0,T ] × [0,1].
The proof of Theorem 5.4 is based on a priori estimates for the approximate solutions
of (5.7)–(5.9) and a limit procedure. To derive the a priori estimates, the crucial step is to
obtain lower and upper bounds of the density, that is, if the initial density has no vacu-
um and concentration of mass on [0,1], then the same should be true for the density for
all t > 0. By exploiting the high integrability of u, (ρα)x (i.e., u, (ρα)x ∈L∞([0,T ],
L2n(0,1)), un−1ux ∈L2([0,T ],L2(0,1)) for any n ∈N) and the energy conservation, one
gets the boundedness of the density from below and above. The detail can be found in
Section 2 of [121]. As far as the uniqueness is concerned, the regularity of the weak solu-
tion constructed for smooth data is proved ﬁrst, then the uniqueness of the weak solution
under the additional regularity assumption on u0 can be shown. (See Section 3 in [121] for
details.)
One should notice that the analysis, used to deal with the situation when the initial den-
sity was assumed to be connected to vacuum with discontinuities, is based on the uniform
positive lower bound of the density with respect to the construction of the approximate
solutions. This estimate is crucial since the other estimates concerned can be obtained by
standard techniques as long as the vacuum does not appear in the solutions in ﬁnite time.
And this uniform positive lower bound on the density function can only be obtained when
the density function connects to vacuum with discontinuities. In this situation, the density
function is positive for any ﬁnite time. So that the viscosity coefﬁcient never vanishes.
The situation is quite different if the density function connects to vacuum continuously
because there is no positive lower bound for the density any more. The degeneracy in the
viscosity coefﬁcient which vanishes at vacuum gives rise to new difﬁculties in analysis due
to the less regularity effect on the solutions. A local existence result is obtained in [234].
Another difﬁculty comes from the singularity at the vacuum boundary when the density
function connects to the vacuum continuously. This can be found from the analysis used
in [230] on the nonglobal existence of the regular solution to the classical Navier–Stokes
equations with a constant viscosity coefﬁcient when the density function is of compact
support. The proof in [230] is based on the estimation of the growth rate of the support in
terms of the time t. If the growth rate is sublinear, then the nonlinear functional introduced
there could yield the nonglobal existence of regular solutions. It seems that this phenom-
enon comes from the effect of the pressure in the gas. No matter how smooth the initial
data are, the pressure of the gas will build up at the vacuum boundary in ﬁnite time, so
that the gas will be pushed into the vacuum region. It turns out the pressure will have the
effect on the evolution of the vacuum boundary in ﬁnite time so that the density function
at the interface will not be smooth. This singularity at the derivatives cause certain analytic
difﬁculty which can be overcome by introducing some appropriate weights in the energy
estimates.

338
L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
This is carried out by Yang and Zhu in [235], where some weight functions, vanishing at
the vacuum boundary, are introduced and some new a priori estimates on the solutions are
established to prove two new global existence results. The ﬁrst one is for the case when the
density function is of compact support in Eulerian coordinates, and the other is when the
support of gas in Eulerian coordinates is inﬁnite but the total mass is ﬁnite. A nonglobal
existence theorem for regular solutions is also given when the initial data is of compact
support.
To state the result in [235] more precisely, we also choose Lagrangian coordinates on
which the free boundary problem to (5.1) can be written as the following initial-boundary
value problem to (5.7)

result are the following:

(A3) 0 < α < 2/9,
γ > 1.
Under the assumptions (A1)–(A3), the existence of a global weak solution to the initial-
boundary value problem (5.10), when the density function is of compact support in
Eulerian coordinates, is proved as the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.5. Under the conditions (A1)–(A3), the problem (5.10) has a global weak

6. The Navier–Stokes equations for multidimensional compressible ﬂuids
As mentioned in the Introduction, the mathematical study of the compressible Navier–
Stokes equations goes back to the work by Nash [173] in the last sixties. In [173] he
proved the local existence of smooth solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations of com-
pressible heat-conducting ﬂuids. Since then, signiﬁcant progress has been made on the
mathematical topics, such as the global existence and the time-asymptotic behavior of so-
lutions. However, a number of important questions, for example, the existence of global
solutions in the case of heat-conducting gases and the uniqueness of weak solutions, still
remain open for large data.
Concerning the global well-posedness and the large-time behavior of solutions, the pic-
ture is more or less complete when data are sufﬁciently small. In this case, global smooth
and weak solutions exist and converge to the corresponding stationary solutions as time
tends to inﬁnity (see, e.g., [85,158,159,224], and there are a vast amount of literature con-
tributing to this issue, we refer the reader to the extensive bibliography in [146]) and the
survey article [223].
For large data the situation becomes quite complex. The global well-posedness for
the Navier–Stokes equations of compressible heat-conducting ﬂuids still remains open.
On the other hand, the global existence and the large-time behavior of solutions have
been obtained in the case of isentropic ﬂuids or heat-conducting ﬂuids with symmetric
data in symmetric domains without the origin. A global existence result for general large
data was obtained ﬁrst by Lions [146] for isentropic ﬂuids (i.e., for (2.22) and (2.23)),
where he used the method ofweak convergence and established delicate techniques to

340
L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
obtain global weak solutions provided the speciﬁc heat ratio γ is appropriately large, for
example, γ ⩾3n/(n + 2), n = 2,3. Then, by combining Lions’ techniques and convex
analysis to reduce the integrability requirement of the density around the origin, Jiang and
Zhang [122] showed the global existence of weak solutions for any γ > 1 to the Cauchy
problem when the initial data are spherically symmetric. Recently, Feireisl, Novotný and
Petzeltová [60,63] delicately use the curl–div lemma to derive certain compactness, and
apply Lions’ idea [146] and a technique from [122] to extend Lions’ existence result to
the case γ > n/2 (n = 2,3). More recently, the global existence of axisymmetric weak
solutions for γ > 1 and spherically symmetric weak solutions in the two-dimensional
isothermal ﬂuid case (i.e., γ = 1) was studied in [123,124] by combining different ideas
from [60,63,122,146,181], and the result in [123] improves that of Hoff [84]. Further
results on the compressible isentropic Navier–Stokes equations are contained in [59,61]
where the existence of time-periodic weak solutions and the large-time behavior of the
global weak solutions are discussed, in [222] in which strong solutions in two space dimen-
sions are shown to exist globally in time provided that μ varies with ρ in a very speciﬁc
way (i.e., μ = O(ρβ) for some β ⩾3 as ρ →∞), and in [47,55] where self-gravitating
ﬂuids and nonmonotone pressure laws are investigated, in [57] where the motion of rigid
body in a viscous compressible ﬂuid is studied, and in [56,64,65] where the dynamics, such
as bounded absorbing sets, global attractors and the ω-limit sets, are investigated.
There are related results, for example, by Desjardins, Grenier, Lions and Masmoudi
in [39,89,147,157] where the incompressible limit of the compressible isentropic Navier–
Stokes equations is studied, and by Min, Kazhikhov, Ukai and Vaigant in [164,221], where
the potential ﬂow equations at small Reynolds numbers and the Stokes approximation
equations in R2 are dealt with, and by Xin and Yanagisawa in [231,232, etc.], where the
zero dissipation limit and boundary layers are discussed.
The multidimensional theory for the compressible isentropic Navier–Stokes equations
(2.22) and (2.23) is the main issue in this section.
For the heat-conducting gas case, the global well-posedness is known only when the
initial data and the domains are spherically symmetric and the origin is excluded from
the domains in order to avoid the mathematical difﬁculties induced by the singularities at
the origin (see, e.g., [24,112,114,174]). Moreover, the global spherically symmetric solu-
tions are asymptotically stable as time goes to inﬁnity. On the other hand, in [230] Xin
gave a nonexistence result of smooth (small) solutions when there is vacuum initially (also
cf. [220]). So, one can only expect the existence of global weak solutions with the initial
data containing vacuum. There are continuous developments on this issue. In [241] Zheng
and Qin investigated the existence of maximal attractors for the spherically symmetric case
in an annulus, while in [41,44] Ducomet studied the global existence and the large-time be-
havior of spherically symmetric solutions for hydrodynamical models from astrophysics,
and among others.
In Section 6.1 we present a global existence theorem for the compressible isentropic
Navier–Stokes equations (2.22), (2.23) and in Section 6.2 we discuss the nonisentropic
ﬂuid case. Throughout this section we use (t,x) to denote the Eulerian coordinates (t,X)
in Section 2.

341
6.1. The isentropic ﬂuid case
We consider the initial boundary value problem for (2.22), (2.23) with initial and nonslip
boundary conditions
(ρ,ρu)|t=0 = (ρ0,m0),
x ∈Ω,
(6.1)
u|∂Ω = 0,
t ⩾0,
(6.2)
where Ω ⊂Rn (n = 2,3) is a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω, and we have
used (t,x) to denote the Eulerian coordinates (t,X). Now, let us recall the deﬁnition of
weak solutions.
DEFINITION 6.1. We call (ρ,u) a global ﬁnite energy weak solution of (2.22), (2.23),
(6.1), (6.2) on the interval [0,T ], if
(i) ρ ⩾0, ρ ∈L∞((0,T ),Lγ (Ω)), u ∈L2((0,T ),H 1
0 (Ω));
(ii) the energy E(t) is locally integrable on (0,T ) and satisﬁes the following inequality
in D′(0,T ):

(t,x)dx;
(iii) equations (2.22) and (2.23) are satisﬁed in D′((0,T ) × Ω); moreover, (2.22) holds
in D′((0,T ) × Rn) provided ρ,u were prolonged to be zero on Rn\Ω;
(iv) equation (2.22) is satisﬁed in the sense of renormalized solutions, that is, the fol-
lowing equation holds in D′((0,T ) × Ω),

for any b ∈C1(R) such that

It is easy to see from (2.22) and (2.23) that a ﬁnite energy weak solution satisﬁes
ρ ∈C

[0,T ],Lγ (Ω) −w
	
,
ρu ∈C

[0,T ],L2γ/(γ +1)(Ω) −w

(6.5)
and consequently, the initial conditions (6.1) make sense and are satisﬁed in the weak
topology of Lγ (Ω) × L2γ/(γ +1)(Ω).
The global existence reads then [54,58,60,146]:

L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
THEOREM 6.1. Assume that γ > n/2 (n = 2,3), and ρ0 ∈Lγ (Ω), ρ0 ⩾0, m0 = 0 when-
ever ρ0(x) = 0, and |m0|2/ρ0 ∈L1(Ω). Then there exists a ﬁnite energy weak solution
(ρ,u) to the initial boundary value problem (2.22), (2.23), (6.1) and (6.2).
SKETCH OF THE PROOF. Roughly speaking, the proof of Theorem 6.1 is mainly based
on the method of weak convergence, and it is very long and complicated. Here in the
following, we only give the main steps of the proof for the case n = 3, for which γ > 3/2
should be kept in mind. The case n = 2 can be dealt with in the same manner.
Step I.
The ﬁrst step is to solve a regularized approximate system to (2.22), (2.23), (6.1)
and (6.2):

large, n denotes the unit outward normal to ∂Ω.
The existence and uniqueness of solutions to (6.6)–(6.8) are proved by means of a
modiﬁed Faedo–Galerkin approximation, where (6.6)1 is solved directly by applying the
classical theory of parabolic equations, and the solution is then inserted into (6.6)2
while (6.6)2 is replaced by a ﬁnite-dimensional system to give ﬁnite-dimensional ap-
proximate solutions to (6.6)–(6.8). With the help of the a priori estimates that are
obtained by employing the energy estimates and the Lp-theory for parabolic equations
as well as the Lions–Aubin lemma, the approximate solutions converge to a limit which
solves (6.6)–(6.8). The result is summarized in the following lemma (see [60] for the de-
tails).
LEMMA 6.2. Let β > max{4,γ }. Assume that ρ0, m0 satisfy the conditions in (6.7). Then
there exists a weak solution (ρ,u) of (6.6)–(6.8) such that ρ ∈Lβ+1((0,T ) × Ω) and the

Moreover, there exists a r1 > 0 such that ρt, ρ ∈Lr1((0,T ) × Ω) and (6.6)1 holds a.e.
on (0,T ) × Ω.
Step II (Vanishing viscosity limit).
In this step we let the artiﬁcial viscosity terms repre-
sented by the ε-quantities tend to zero. This is a delicate matter due to the lack of suitable
estimates of the density ρ. Here the techniques developed in [60,146] are used.

where C(δ,ρ0,m0) is a positive constant independent of ε.
From (6.9), (6.10) and (6.12), we can extract a subsequence of (ρε,uε), still denoted by
(ρε,uε), such that (also cf. Lemma C.1 of [145], Appendix C, and Lemma 5.1 of [146]),
noticing that the system (6.6) gives bounds of ∂tρε and ∂t(ρεuε) in certain Sobolev spaces
with a negative index,

Hence, letting ε →0 in (6.6), the limit (ρ,u) satisﬁes the initial data (6.7) and

Our next goal is to show that

P = aργ + δρβ,
(6.14)
which is equivalent to strong convergence of ρε in L1((0,T ) × Ω). To this end, we intro-
duce the so-called effective viscous ﬂux
aργ + δρβ −(λ + 2β)divu,
which enjoys many remarkable properties (see, e.g., [85,146,199]). It can be shown that
as ε →0,

(6.15)
in D′((0,T ) × Ω), for β ⩾6γ/(2γ −3). (6.15) plays a key role for the existence in [146].
The property (6.15) was proved by Serre [199] in the one-dimensional case and by
Lions [146] in the multidimensional case, while in [60] Feireisl, Novotný and Petzeltová
gave an elementary (simpliﬁed) proof based on the div–curl lemma and the following com-
pactness lemma on commutators involving the Riesz transforms.
LEMMA 6.3. Assume (vn,wn) ⇀(v,w) weakly in Lp(Rn) × Lq(Rn), 1/p + 1/q =
1/r < 1. Then

where Ri,j[v] = ∂xj −1∂xiv.
To show (6.14), we use (6.15) to prove the strong convergence of ρε. Using the regular-
ization procedure due to DiPerna and Lions, we see that (ρ,u) solves (6.13)1 in the sense
of renormalized solutions, i.e., (6.4) holds. Taking b(z) = zlogz in (6.4) which is possible
by an approximation argument, we ﬁnd that

where the constant C is independent of δ.
Step III (Passing to the limit in the artiﬁcial pressure term).
Our ultimate goal is to take
δ →0 in (6.19)2. We start with the construction of the initial data. Let (ρ0,m0) be the
initial data in (6.1) and satisfy the conditions in Theorem 6.1. Then, it is easy to ﬁnd
a sequence (ρδ
0,mδ
0) that satisﬁes the conditions in (6.7) and converges to (ρ0,m0) in
Lγ (Ω) × L1(Ω) as δ →0; moreover, |mδ

0 is uniformly bounded in L1(Ω). Denote
the ﬁnite energy solution of (6.19) with the initial data (ρδ
0,mδ
0) established in Lemma 6.4
by (ρδ,uδ). Then for (ρδ,uδ), the estimate (6.20) holds uniformly in δ.
Similarly to Step I, one ﬁrst uses the operator B to derive higher integrability of ρδ. Let
b ∈C1 be uniformly bounded and ⟨b(ρδ)⟩ε denote the molliﬁed function of b(ρδ) by the
Friedrichs’ molliﬁer. Thus, using

Consequently, by taking δ →0 in (6.19), the limit (ρ,u) satisﬁes
ρt + div(ρu) = 0,
(6.23)
(ρu)t + div(ρu ⊗u) + a∇ργ = μu + (λ + μ)∇divu,
(6.24)
in D′((0,T ) × Ω).
So, to complete the proof of Theorem 6.1, it remains to prove ργ = ργ , or equivalently,
the strong convergence of ρδ in L1. To this end, since (ρδ,uδ) is a renormalized solution
of (6.19) in D′((0,T ) × Rn), we take b in (6.4) to be the cut-off function Tk(z) = kT (z/k)
with T ∈C∞(R) being concave and satisfying T (z) = z for z ⩽1 and T (z) = 2 for z ⩾3,
and let δ →0 to arrive at

Analogously as in Step II, we can use the div–curl lemma, Lemma 6.3 and (6.25) to
derive the following identity involving the effective viscous ﬂux:


Tk(ρδ) →

aργ −(λ + 2μ)divu

Tk(ρ)
(6.26)
in D′((0,T ) × Ω). In order to show ργ = ργ , we need that the limit (ρ,u) is a renormal-
ized solution of (6.23), i.e., (6.4) holds. The equation (6.4) is proved by regularizing (6.25),
and employing a limit procedure and the crucial observation that
limsup
δ↓0
Tk(ρδ) −Tk(ρ)

Lγ +1((0,T )×Ω) ⩽C
(6.27)
with C being a constant independent of k. The estimate (6.27) is in the spirit of Jiang and
Zhang [122], which means, roughly speaking, that neither the sequence ρδ nor its limit ρ
is square integrable but the amplitude of possible oscillations is.
Introduce a family of functions
Lk(z) =
zlogz
for 0 ⩽z < k,
zlogk + z
 z

Tk(s)

for z ⩾k.
Since (ρδ,uδ) and (ρ,u) are the renormalized solutions of (6.19)1 and (6.23), respectively,
we have by taking b(z) = Lk(z) that
∂tLk(ρδ) + div

Lk(ρδ)uδ
	
+ Tk(ρδ)divuδ = 0,
(6.28)
∂tLk(ρ) + div

(6.29)
and by (6.20), we can assume

and, approximating zlogz ≈Lk(z),
ρδ logρδ →ρ logρ
in C

[0,T ],Lα(Ω) −w
	
for any 1 ⩽α < γ.
Finally, we are able to show strong convergence of {ρδ} by comparing Lk(ρ) with Lk(ρ)
for k →∞. Subtracting (6.29) from (6.28) and letting δ →0, we infer

(6.30)
On the other hand, making use of (6.26), the monotonicity of the pressure and (6.27), we
can show that the second term on the right-hand side of (6.30) tends to zero as k →∞, and
accordingly, we can pass to the limit for k →∞in (6.30) to conclude ρ logρ = ρ logρ
a.e., which implies strong convergence of {ρδ} in L1((0,T ) × Ω) (cf., e.g., [129]). This
completes the proof of Theorem 6.1.
□
The same arguments as used for Theorem 6.1 can be applied and adapted to the Cauchy
problem, initial boundary value problems in exterior domains, the initial boundary value
problem with spatially periodic boundary condition, the problem on self-gravitating ﬂuids
and on nonmonotone pressure laws as well as the motion driven by a periodic external
force, and a similar existence theorem can be proved, see [47,55,59,146].
When 1 < γ ⩽n/2, the global existence is known only for initial data with symmetry
by now. Spherically symmetric solutions are investigated in [122] for any γ > 1, while ax-
isymmetric solutions in [124] for any γ > 1. In these papers, the mathematical difﬁculties
induced by the singularity at the symmetric axis are circumvented by combining differ-
ent techniques from [60,122,146] and the concentrated compactness theory. When γ = 1,
which corresponds to isothermal ﬂuids, we have the global existence only in the case of
spherically symmetric initial data. The global existence of weak solutions was obtained
ﬁrst by Hoff [84] for spherically symmetric BV -initial data, and the two-dimensional re-
sult in [84] was extended to Lp-initial data in [123] by exploiting certain compactness
between the Orlicz and Sobolev spaces.
In the sequel, we present a existence theorem for the axisymmetric case in R3 for
any γ > 1. For axisymmetric ﬂow, there is no ﬂow in the θ-direction and all θ deriva-
tives are identically zero. So we consider only two variables, r – the radial direction and
z – the axial direction, and denote by u1 and u2 the radial and axial components of the
velocity u = (u1,u2), respectively. Then, the Cauchy problem for the system (2.22), (2.23)

∂ru2(t,0,z) = 0,
t ⩾0,z ∈R.
(6.35)
Comparing with the two-dimensional or the spherically symmetric case, the difﬁcul-
ties here lie in the singularity at r = 0, the fact that the singularity set here is the plane
R+
0 × {0} × R in R3 but not a line as in the spherically symmetric case, and the Neumann
boundary condition for u2 which could induce concentration of singularity involving u2
at r = 0 in passing to the limit r ↓0.
For the sake of simplicity of the presentation, let us assume that λ + μ ≡0. It can be
easily seen that the case λ + μ > 0 will not arouse any new difﬁculties. Now we modify
the deﬁnition of the ﬁnite energy solutions in the following way:

REMARK 6.2. If we deﬁne ρ(t,x) := ρ(t,r,z), U(t,x) := ( x ′
r u1(t,r,z),u2(t,r,z)),
where x = (x,y,z) ∈R3, x ′ = (x,y) ∈R2 and r = |x ′|. Then it is easy to see that
(ρ(t,x),U(t,x)) is a weak (ﬁnite energy) solution of the Cauchy problem for the com-
pressible isentropic Navier–Stokes equations in R3 (cf. the proof of Theorem 5.7 in [84]).
Roughly speaking, Theorem 6.5 is proved by adapting the techniques from [60,122,146]
and the concentration compactness principle. In order to exclude the possible concentra-
tion of singularity at the symmetric axis induced by the term ρ(u2)2, namely the possible

in the sense of measures, where (ρε,uε), J and ci are the approximate solutions, an at
most countable set (possibly empty) and constants respectively, besides modifying the ar-
guments in the proof of Theorem 6.1, we have to adapt Lions’ concentration compactness
method for stationary isothermal ﬂows. Moreover, one obtains a new integrability esti-
mate (6.36) of the density near r = 0 simultaneously.
Recently, the dynamics of the compressible isentropic Navier–Stokes equations has been
studied by Feireisl and Petzeltová in a series of papers. In [56,61] they investigated the
large-time behavior of weak solutions driven by a potential external force and the existence
of global attractors by exploiting the weak convergence associated with the existence result
and carefully analyzing the time-evolution of the energy. We summarize these results in
Theorems 6.6 and 6.7.
THEOREM 6.6. Let n = 3 and γ > 3/2, let Ω ⊂R3 be a domain with compact Lipschitz
boundary. Assume that G(x) is bounded and Lipschitz continuous on 
Ω and the upper
level sets {x ∈Ω;G(x) > k} are connected in Ω for any k < supx∈Ω G(x). Moreover,

Then, for any ﬁnite energy weak solution (ρ,u) of the problem (2.22), (2.23), (6.1), (6.2)
with the potential external force of density ∇G on (0,∞)×Ω, there is a stationary state ρs

absorbing sets, complete bounded trajectories and the ω-limit sets are discussed.
6.2. The heat-conducting case
As stated in the Introduction, in the heat-conducting case we have only the global existence
of spherically symmetric solutions in symmetric domains without the origin (in order to
exclude the difﬁculties induced by the singularity at the symmetric axis). Next, we mainly
present the corresponding existence result.
The spherically symmetric form of (2.19)–(2.21) in Lagrangian coordinates in the exte-
rior domain {x ∈Rn; |x| > 1} can be written

where u ≡u(t,y) is the speciﬁc volume, v ≡v(t,y) is the velocity component in the radial
direction, (t,y) and (t,r) denotes the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates respectively,
˜μ = λ + 2μ, and r ≡r(t,y) is determined by

As boundary conditions we consider nonslip and thermally insulated boundary, i.e.,
v(t,0) = 0,
θy(t,0) = 0,
t ⩾0;
(6.40)
and initial conditions

u(0,y),v(0,y),θ(0,y)
	
=

u0(y),v0(y),θ0(y)
	
,
y ⩾0.
(6.41)
For the problem (6.37)–(6.41), we have the following existence theorem [112]:
THEOREM 6.8. Assume that
u0 −1,v0,θ0 −1,rn−1
0
∂yu0,rn−1
0
∂yv0,rn−1
0
∂yθ0 ∈L2(0,∞);
u0(y),θ0(y) > 0
for all y ∈[0,∞),
and that the initial data are compatible with the boundary conditions (6.40). Then the prob-
lem (6.37)–(6.41) has a unique solution {u,v,θ} with u,θ > 0 such that, for any T > 0,
u −1,v,θ −1 ∈L∞
(0,T ),H 1(0,∞)
	
,
ut ∈L∞
(0,T ),L2(0,∞)
	
,
vt,θt,uyt,vyy,θyy,rn−1θy,r2n−2θyy ∈L2
(0,T ) × (0,∞)
	
,
and {u,v,θ} satisﬁes (6.37)–(6.41) almost everywhere in (0,T ) × (0,∞) and takes on
the given boundary and initial conditions in the sense of traces. Moreover, when n = 3,
there are positive constants u, ¯u independent of t and y, such that u ⩽u(t,y) ⩽¯u for all
t,y ⩾0, and for an arbitrary but ﬁxed integer j ⩾2, ∥v(t)∥L2j (0,∞) →0 as t →∞.
IDEA OF THE PROOF. The proof of Theorem 6.8 is essentially based on a careful exam-
ination of a priori estimates and a limit procedure. Since the domain is unbounded and
the coefﬁcients tend to inﬁnity as y →∞, some difﬁculties arise; for example, from the
a priori estimates we could get only v(y,t) = o(y−1/2+1/(2n)) as y →∞; but this is not
sufﬁcient to guarantee integration by parts in the proof where v = o(y−1+1/n) is required.
To overcome such difﬁculties we ﬁrst study an approximate problem in the bounded in-
terval (0,k) and show the a priori estimates independent of k by utilizing some cut-off

function and modifying a technique of Kazhikhov [10,137] for the one-dimensional case,
then letting k tend to inﬁnity and using the obtained a priori estimates, we get a global
spherically symmetric solution as the limit.
The large-time behavior is obtained by adapting an idea of Kazhikhov [137] to derive
a representation of u from which the uniform boundedness of u from below and above
follows, and utilizing tricky energy estimates to derive L2j-bounds for v uniformly in t.
□
REMARK 6.3. The same techniques work and an analogous theorem is obtained
when (6.40) is replaced by the following boundary conditions:
v(t,0) = 0,
θ(t,0) = 1,
t ⩾0
(nonslip, constant temperature).
(6.42)
There are other papers contributing to the mathematical topics on spherically symmetric
solutions in bounded annular domains. Nikolaev in [174] ﬁrst studied the initial boundary
value problem (6.37)–(6.39), (6.41), (6.42) in an annular domain and proved the global
existence of smooth spherically symmetric solutions for strictly positive initial density and
temperature, while the exponential stability as t →∞of the corresponding spherically
symmetric solutions was gotten in [114]. Yashima and Benabidallah [69,70] dealt with
the case of nonnegative initial density and temperature and proved the global existence of
weak spherically symmetric solutions. Using a difference scheme and a limit procedure,
Chen and Kratka obtained the global spherically symmetric solutions for a free boundary
problem in an annulus [24]. In [241] Zheng and Qin studied the existence of maximal
attractors for the spherically symmetric smooth solutions in an annulus.
7. Nonlinear one-dimensional thermoelasticity
We shall study spatially one-dimensional models and prove the global existence of so-
lutions for small data, i.e., for small deviations from the reference conﬁguration, while
for large data blow-up results will be presented. This shows that the dissipation induced
by thermal diffusion is strong enough for small data to prevent a smooth solution from a
ﬁnite-time blow-up but not for large data.
The equations for the displacement u and the temperature difference θ are those given
by (2.2) and (2.12), where we shall assume without loss of generality that the medium is
homogeneous and that the reference density ρc equals one. Write f and f2 for the body
force and for the heat supply, respectively, and for the sake of simplicity, denote q := Q in
Section 2, and
a := ∂%S

(for |θ| < T0). Observing −∂%S/∂θ = ∂η/∂ux and assuming q = q(θx) for simplicity, we
may rewrite the equations (3.1) and (2.12) as follows:
utt −a(ux,θ)uxx + b(ux,θ)θx = f
in (0,∞) × Ω,
(7.2)
c(ux,θ)θt + b(ux,θ)utx −d(θ,θx)θxx = g
in (0,∞) × Ω.
(7.3)
Additionally, we consider the following boundary and initial conditions, respectively:
u(t,0) = u(t,1) = θ(t,0) = θ(t,1) = 0
in [0,∞),
(7.4)
u(0,x) = u0(x),
ut(0,x) = u1(x),
θ(0,x) = θ0(x)
in Ω,
(7.5)
with prescribed data u0, u1 and θ0. The boundary conditions (7.4) mean that the boundary
is rigidly clamped and the temperature is kept constant on the boundary.
Using the energy method and a tricky treatment of some boundary terms with techniques
from the theory of boundary control, we can obtain the global existence and the exponential
decay of smooth small solutions. More precisely, assume:
ASSUMPTION 7.1. Variables a,b,c,d are C2-functions of their arguments. There exist
positive constants γ0,γ1 and K with K < T0, such that if |ux| ⩽K, |θ| ⩽K, |θx| ⩽K, we
have
γ0 ⩽a(ux,θ),
c(ux,θ),
d(θ,θx) ⩽γ1,
b(ux,θ) ̸= 0.
f and f2 satisfy:
f,f2 ∈C2
[0,∞),L2(Ω)
	
∩C1
[0,∞),H 1(Ω)
	
.
And next:
ASSUMPTION 7.2. Suppose u0 ∈H 3(Ω), u1 ∈H 2(Ω), u2 ∈H 1(Ω), θ0 ∈H 3(Ω),
θ1 ∈H 2(Ω) and |θ0(x)| < T0 in 
Ω,
u0 = u1 = u2 = θ0 = θ1 = 0
on ∂Ω,
where u2 := utt|t=0, θ1 := θt|t=0 are given formally through the differential equations,
explicitly in terms of the initial data u0,u1,θ0:

we can assume without loss of generality that the functions a,b,c,d and their derivatives
are bounded.

PROOF. First, for appropriately small ε0, by using the Banach contraction mapping princi-
ple and a standard procedure, one obtains a local smooth solution U = (u,θ) deﬁned on the
time interval [0,T1] for some T1 > 0 which is in the function space given in Theorem 7.1
(cf. Notes at the end of Section 7) and satisﬁes
|ux| < K,
|θ| < K,
|θx| < K
in [0,T1] × 
Ω.
(7.6)
Next we derive a uniform a priori estimate for (u,θ), then with the help of this a priori
estimate, one can continue the local solution globally in time.
Taking ∂j
t (j = 0,1,2) on both sides of (7.2) and (7.3), and multiplying by ∂j
t ut and ∂j
t θ,
respectively, adding then together, integrating with respect to x and integrating by parts,

decay follows easily from (7.21).
□
The arguments in Theorem 7.1 can be modiﬁed and applied to the Cauchy problem to
get the global existence. Moreover, one can utilize the decay of solutions to the linearized
equations to obtain the time-asymptotic behavior of solutions to the nonlinear equations.
To prove the global existence for the Cauchy problem we assume without loss of generality
that f = f2 = 0 and
q = −ˆκ(ux,θ)θx

and introduce the variables w := ux, v := ut to write the system (7.2), (7.3) as a ﬁrst-order

THEOREM 7.2. Let V 0 ∈H 2(R) and ˆκ be a C3-function of its arguments. Assume that
Assumption 7.1 with d replaced by ˆκ is satisﬁed. Then there exists an ε > 0 such that if
∥V 0∥H 2 ⩽ε, then the Cauchy problem (7.22)–(7.25) has a unique global solution V =

SKETCH OF THE PROOF. To obtain the global existence, as in Theorem 7.1, the key point
is to derive a uniform a priori estimate for V . Let (w,v,θ) be a solution of (7.22)–(7.25)
on [0,T ] with the regularities given in Theorem 7.2 and satisﬁes ∥V (t)∥L∞⩽K
for t ∈[0,T ].
To derive the a priori estimate, comparing with the proof in Theorem 7.1, the main
difference lies in the estimate of V in L∞((0,∞),L2(R))-norm which cannot be derived
directly by applying the arguments used in Theorem 7.1 because of the unboundedness of
the domain and the L1 nonintegrability with respect to t of ∥V (t)∥2. The estimate of V in
L∞((0,∞),L2(R)) is obtained by exploiting some relations associated with the 2nd law
of thermodynamics, and this idea is due to Kawashima [131,132] (also cf. [98]).
Setting
Λ(w,θ) := ψ(w,θ) −ψ(0,0) −θψθ(w,θ)
with ψ being the Helmholtz free energy, and using (7.22)–(7.24), one obtains after a
straightforward calculation that

(7.29)
Once (7.29) is shown, the desired a priori estimate can be obtained, using the same
arguments as in Theorem 7.1, and therefore, the global existence of a unique solution
follows. Moreover, the large-time behavior of the global solution (7.26) can be proved by
using the smallness of the solution and the decay-rates of the solutions to the linearized
equations which are obtained by applying the Fourier transform and spectral analysis. It
should be pointed out that the decay of V (t) in other norms can also be given. We refer
to [131,132,240,242] for the detailed proof of Theorem 7.2.
□
We can combine and adapt the techniques in the proof of Theorems 7.1 and 7.2 to deal
with various initial boundary value problems in bounded or unbounded domains, such as

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems

the problem (7.2), (7.3), (7.5) with one of the following boundary conditions:
%S(ux,θ)

∂Ω = 0,
q(ux,θx,θ)

∂Ω = 0
(traction free, thermally insulated);
%S(ux,θ)

∂Ω = 0,
θ|∂Ω = 0
(traction free, constant temperature);
(7.30)
u|∂Ω = 0,
q(ux,θx,θ)|∂Ω = 0
(rigidly clamped, thermally insulated),
where Ω = (0,1) or Ω = (0,∞). In the same way, we can obtain a similar global exis-
tence theorem for small smooth initial data, see, e.g., [104,106,107,131,135,136,192,208,
238,240,242], and [191,203,239] on thermoelasticity with dissipation, also see the mono-
graph [120]. In the case of Ω = (0,1), the exponential stability of the global solution is
proved [106,208], while in the case of Ω = (0,∞), the polynomial decay rates of the
global solution for the boundary conditions (7.30)2, or (7.30)3 or u|∂Ω = θ|∂Ω = 0 is ob-
tained by using the Fourier sine and cosine transforms, the method of spectral analysis
and the Laplace transform (cf. [104,131,242]). The decay of the global solution for the
boundary conditions (7.30)1 in the half line Ω = (0,∞) still remains open.
In the sequel we show by an example that for large data a smooth solution will break
down in ﬁnite time. In other words, the dissipation induced by thermal diffusion is too
weak to prevent a smooth solution from blow-up for large data.
We consider the special constitutive equations of the form
⎧
⎨
⎩
%S(w,θ) := p(w) + γ θ,
ε(w,θ) := P(w) + δθ −γ T0w,
q(w,θ,θx) := −κθx,
(7.31)
where T0,κ,δ > 0, γ ̸= 0 are constants, T0 is the reference temperature; p :(−1,∞) →R
is a given function,
P(w) :=
 w
0
p(ξ)dξ,
w > −1.
(7.32)
It is easy to see that these constitutive equations satisfy εw = %S −(θ + T0)%Sθ and
g q(w,θ,g) ⩽0 and that
ψ(w,θ) = P(w) + γ wθ + δ(θ + T0)log
T0
(θ + T0) + δθ
(7.33)
is a Helmholtz free energy; moreover, the corresponding entropy is given by
η(w,θ) = −γ w −δ log
T0
(θ + T0).
It should be pointed out that we do not claim that the constitutive equations (7.31)–(7.33)
are appropriate to any real material; however, they do satisfy the assumptions used to es-

364
L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
tablish the global existence of smooth solutions (i.e., Theorem 7.2) when the initial data
are sufﬁciently small. Moreover, they are fully compatible with the second law of thermo-
dynamics, in particular, there is a free energy.
Under the constitutive equations (7.31), the system (7.22)–(7.24) becomes
wt = vx,
(7.34)
vt = p′(w)wx + γ θx,
(7.35)
δθt = κθxx + γ (θ + T0)vx.
(7.36)
Thus, the blow-up result on the Cauchy problem (7.34)–(7.36),(7.25) reads as the theorem.
THEOREM 7.3. Assume that p ∈C4(−1,∞), p(0) = 0, p′(ξ) > 0 for ξ > −1 and
p′′(0) ̸= 0. Let β, L, J > 0 be given. Then there exist ε, M > 0 (depending on β,
L, J) with the following property: For each w0, v0, θ0 ∈H 3(R),

the length Tm of the maximal interval of existence of a smooth solution (w,v,θ) of the
Cauchy problem (7.34)–(7.36), (7.25) is less than (or equal to) L; moreover, the local
solution satisﬁes |w(t,x)|,|v(t,x)|,|θ(x,t)| ⩽β for all x ∈R,t ∈[0,Tm).
PROOF. The proof is based on the combination of the techniques for blow-up results in
one-dimensional nonlinear elasticity and a delicate estimate of the temperature gradient
in (7.35). It is well known that a smooth solution of the purely elastic part in (7.34), (7.35)
breaks down in ﬁnite time. On the other hand, the behavior of the elastic part is inﬂuenced
only by the temperature gradient θx in (7.35). Using the semilinear heat equation (7.36)
for θ, we may represent θ in terms of vx. With the help of this representation, one can con-
trol θx by wx and vx, that is, for large data, |θx| grows like O(|wx| + |vx|). Consequently,
the growth of |θx| in the case of large data is slower than that of the elastic part. Therefore,
the elastic behavior dominates in the equations (7.34), (7.35) for large data and singular-
ities of the smooth solution develop in ﬁnite time. See [97] for the details of the proof of
Theorem 7.3.
□
The ﬁrst blow-up result on the thermoelastic system was given by Dafermos and
Hsiao [36]. They studied a slightly different class of thermoelastic materials in [36].

Nonlinear hyperbolic–parabolic coupled systems

They assume that the stress and the heat ﬂux are given by (7.31)1 and (7.31)3, and
that ε(w,θ) = P(w) + δθ. As they point out their constitutive relations comply with
εw = %S −(θ + T0)%Sθ only if T0 = 0 (or γ = 0). For some initial boundary value prob-
lems in a bounded interval or the half line, we have a similar blow-up result, see [78] for
the details.
The blow-up result shows the nonexistence of global classical solutions for large data,
in general. It is not only mathematically interesting and natural to ask for global, large
solutions with weaker regularity, but also from the physical and modeling point of view.
There exists only little work on this subject due to the inherent mathematical difﬁcul-
ties. In [50] Durek proved the global existence of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem
under the simplifying assumption that %S satisﬁes %S(ux,θ) = σ(ux) + θ for a function σ
and that the equation for θ in (7.3) is linear, i.e., δθt −κθxx + γ utx = 0. The basic idea
in [50] is ﬁrst to represent θ in terms of utx by employing the linear heat equation for θ
and to insert this representation into the momentum equation leading to a (perturbed) non-
linear elastic equation for u, and then to apply the method of compensated compactness to
the perturbed elastic equation to get a global weak solution. In [197] Rieger and Zimmer
investigated a nonlinear one-dimensional thermoelastic model with nonconvex energy. Us-
ing the Young measure method and the technique of vanishing regularization terms, they
proved the global existence of a Young measure solution.
Further results for the one-dimensional systems are contained in the papers [53,193] on
periodic small solutions and in [20] on weak solutions for the systems that do not conduct
heat.
NOTES ON THE LOCAL EXISTENCE. There are many papers devoted to the local exis-
tence in Rn. For systems of hyperbolic–parabolic type which are ﬁrst-order hyperbolic
the local existence for the Cauchy problem was studied by Vol’pert and Hudjaev [225]
and by Kawashima [131], see also [165]. For initial boundary value problems in R3 there
are results for systems with ﬁrst-order hyperbolic part for noncharacteristic boundaries,
see [237], or special characteristic boundaries and admissible boundary conditions in the
Friedrichs sense for bounded domains, see [144]. In [133] Kawashima and Matsumura
studied hyperbolic–parabolic systems in both bounded and exterior domains with ﬁrst-
order hyperbolic part and their results may be applied to nonlinear thermoelasticity
after some necessary additional consideration. With a different method, Shibata [207] and
Dan [37] proved a local existence result for the Neumann problem. The Dirichlet problem
was investigated by Jiang and Racke [119]. A similar result was given by Chrz¸eszczyk [28],
using the methods from Dafermos and Hrusa [33].
8. Nonlinear three-dimensional thermoelasticity
The models for one space dimension discussed in the previous section demonstrated that
the behavior of the nonlinear thermoelastic system is dominated by the heat conduction
at least with respect to the existence of solutions for small data and the time-asymptotic
behavior of solutions. In more than one space dimension the situation becomes delicate.
It is known (cf., e.g., [190] and the references therein) that in the case of pure elasticity

366
L. Hsiao and S. Jiang
there are global small solutions if the nonlinearity degenerates up to order two, i.e., if the
nonlinearity is cubic (near zero values of its arguments). In the “genuinely nonlinear” case,
a blow up in ﬁnite time has to be expected; this was proved for plane waves and for radial
solutions, cf. [127,128,190]. On the other hand quadratic nonlinearities in R3 still lead to
global, small solutions of the heat equation, cf. [190]. The question remains whether here
the dissipative impact through heat conduction is strong enough to prevent solutions from
blowing up at least for small data.
The answer to this question will be positive for the Cauchy problem if one essentially
excludes those nonlinearities already responsible for blow-up results in pure elasticity;
this will ﬁrst be shown in this section, and is completed by proving a blow-up result also
for small data for general (quadratic) nonlinearities, in the “genuinely nonlinear” case.
Then, we present a global existence theorem for an initial boundary value problem in Rn
(n = 2,3) for the radially symmetric case.
Without loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to three space dimensions. The sys-
tem (2.2), (2.12) for a homogeneous medium with unit reference density in R3 can be
written as

for some positive constant a0. Here U = (U1,U2,U3)′, q = (q1,q2,q3)′, χ is a C∞-func-
tion such that χ(θ) = θ + T0 for |θ| ⩽T0/2 and 0 < χ1 ⩽χ(θ) ⩽χ2 < ∞, χ1,χ2 are
constants, −∞< θ < ∞. Equations (8.1) and (8.2) are derived for small values of |θ|, i.e.,
for |θ| ⩽T0/2, which is a posteriori justiﬁed by the smallness of the solutions obtained
later on.
We assume that Cijkl(∇U,θ) and q(∇U,θ,∇θ) satisfy the usual ellipticity, i.e.,

we assume that the nonlinearity satisﬁes:
There are no purely quadratic terms only involving ∇U,∇Ut,∇2U
and additionally one of the following two cases is given:
Case I: Only quadratic terms appear.
Case II: Only at least cubic terms appear and
one quadratic term of the type θθ.
(8.11)
Then the global existence for (8.1), (8.2), (8.10) reads:
THEOREM 8.1. Let the nonlinearity satisfy (8.11). Then there exist an integer s0 and a
δ > 0 such that the following holds: If (∇U0,U1,θ0) ∈H s(R3) ∩W s,1(R3) with s ⩾s0
and


then there is a unique global solution (U,θ) of the Cauchy problem (8.1), (8.2), (8.10) with

Moreover, the solution decays polynomially as time goes to inﬁnity.
SKETCH OF THE PROOF. The basic idea of the proof is to derive a uniform a priori esti-
mate for (U,θ) by exploiting the decay of solutions to the related linearized system and
delicate calculations. With the help of the a priori estimate, one can continue a local solu-
tion globally in time. The proof is technical and very long, we refer to [185,188] for the
detail. In the following we give the main Steps A–E.
We ﬁrst transform (8.6) and (8.7) to a suitable ﬁrst-order system by introducing
V (t) := (SDU,Ut,θ)′(t) = V 1,V 2,V 3	′(t),

REMARK 8.1. The case of two space dimensions can be dealt with similarly in the sense
that appropriate assumptions on the nonlinearities will lead to global solutions. But, since
the decay is weaker, the assumptions would have to be stronger.
Next, we give an example to show that one has to expect the development of singularities
in ﬁnite time if there are purely quadratic nonlinear terms only involving derivatives of the
displacement, not involving the temperature, such as ∇U∇2U,∇U∇Ut.
The idea of proving a blow-up is that we decompose (U,θ) into (Uσ,0) + (Uπ,θ)
with the divergence-free Uσ and the curl-free Uπ, and choose an appropriate Helmholtz
free energy ψ, so that Uσ is no longer coupled to θ and satisﬁes a genuinely nonlinear
strictly hyperbolic system. Then the general results from [127,148] will imply that there
are nonlinearities which on the one hand satisfy at least the basic (physical) properties, and
on the other hand are such that for sufﬁciently small smooth data, a plane-wave solution
cannot be of class C2 for all positive t.
We consider a plane wave U(t,x) = %
U(t,τ · x), τ = (1,0,0)′ and assume θ(t,x) =
˜θ(t,τ · x), i.e., U and θ become functions of x1 (and t) only. We may decompose U into
the divergence-free part Uσ and the curl-free part Uπ:
U = (0,U2,U3)′ + (U1,0,0)′ ≡Uσ + Uπ.
Let P σ denote the corresponding projection U →P σ U := Uσ . As stated above, by
taking the projection P σ to (8.1), the aim is to obtain the relation

a222 −a333 −a223 + a233 ̸= 0.
Then, a straightforward calculation implies that for the above deﬁned ψ, (8.17), (8.18),
(8.20) and (8.21) hold in a neighborhood of zero. Moreover, one has a(∇U,θ) ⩾a0 > 0

for some constant a0 and (%
Cij)ij ̸= 0 (“really coupled”!). Therefore, an application of
the general result in [127,148] to the system (8.19) gives the nonexistence of a global
C2-solution to (8.19). Thus, we have proved [189]:
THEOREM 8.2. There exist nonlinearities such that for compactly supported non-
vanishing smooth data (U0,σ,U1,σ) which are sufﬁciently small, i.e.,

is sufﬁciently small, a plane-wave solution of the Cauchy problem (8.1), (8.2), (8.10) cannot
be of class C2 for all positive t.
Concerning initial boundary value problems in bounded domains, the work by
Henry [79], Lebeau and Zuazua [142], Koch [141] shows that in general there is no decay
rate of solutions to the associated linearized equations due to reﬂecting rays. So, the tech-
niques in the proof of Theorem 8.1 cannot be directly applied to the nonlinear problems in
bounded domains. However, in the case of radially symmetric solutions, the divergence-
free part of solutions to the linearized equations vanishes, and consequently, the solutions
decay exponentially as time tends to inﬁnity. This allows us to prove the global existence
for the initial boundary value problem with radially symmetric initial data in radially sym-
metric domains. (Compare this to Theorem 8.2, where the divergence-free part Uσ induces
singularities.)
Consider the initial boundary value problem (8.6), (8.7) with initial and boundary con-
ditions

Moreover, ∥U(t)∥H 4, ∥θ(t)∥H 4 decay to zero exponentially as t →∞.
OUTLINE OF THE PROOF. The ﬁrst step is to prove the exponential decay of solutions to
the linearized equations of (8.6) and (8.7), i.e., (8.6) and (8.7) with f 1 = 0 and f 2 = 0.
Note that under the assumptions of the theorem, the local smooth solution is radially sym-
metric due to the invariance of (8.6) and (8.7) under rotation and uniqueness. For the
radially symmetric solution U, the H 1-norm of U is equivalent to ∥divU∥(= ∥∇U∥).
On the one hand, the exponential decay of θ is expected due to parabolicity of (8.7) with
f 2 = 0 for θ; on the other hand, in view of (8.7) with f 2 = 0, divUt (a “good” term) is
controlled by θ, and that is, ∇Ut is bounded in L2 by θ. Exploiting boundedness of ∇Ut
in L2 and applying (delicate) energy estimates for the elastic equations (8.6) with f 1 = 0,
employing the techniques from boundary control to bound the “ill” behaved terms as in the
one-dimensional case (compare to Theorem 7.1), one obtains the exponential decay for the
linearized equations of (8.6) and (8.7). The next step is to exploit the exponential decay for
the linearized equations and employ (tricky) energy estimates to derive a uniform a priori
estimate for (8.6), (8.7), (8.22) and (8.23), with which one can continue a local radially
symmetric solution globally in time.
□
Other boundary conditions were studied by Rieger [196]. However, there are not yet any
results for unbounded domains with boundary.
NOTES ON THE RELATED RESULTS. There are a number of related results for nonlinear
evolution equations of thermoelastic type. Fully dynamical and quasi-static thermoelastic
contact problems were studied, for example, in [1,38,51,167,168,205,206] and among oth-
ers. The corresponding system models the evolution of temperature and displacement in
an elastic body that may come into contact with a rigid foundation, and consists of the
linearized equations together with nonlinear boundary conditions which reﬂect the contact
situation. Under certain conditions the global well-posedness and the large-time behavior
of solutions are discussed.
In [25,195,227] the propagation of singularities in nonlinear thermoelasticity was inves-
tigated using techniques from the theory of pseudo-differential operators and microlocal
analysis.
The far-ﬁeld behavior of solutions to the equations of nonlinear thermoelasticity is useful
for numerical simulations in unbounded domains, and can be utilized to construct “appro-
priate boundary conditions” on the artiﬁcial boundary. The far-ﬁeld behavior in one and
three space dimensions was investigated with the help of the Fourier transform and the use
of suitable weighted function spaces (cf. [105] and the references cited therein).

Nonlinear parabolic equations and systems

1. Introduction
The theory of nonlinear parabolic problems is so widely developed that it is impossible to
give an overview in a few pages. Therefore in this chapter we consider only a speciﬁc class
of equations and systems with a high degree of nonlinearity, that are called fully nonlinear
because the nonlinearities involve the highest-order derivatives of the unknowns appearing
in the problems. For instance, a simple signiﬁcant example is the Cauchy problem for a
second-order equation,
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
ut(t,x) = Φ

D2u(t,x)
	
,
t ⩾0,x ∈
Ω,
Ψ

Du(t,x)
	
= 0,
t ⩾0,x ∈∂Ω,
u(0,x) = u0(x),
x ∈
Ω,
(1.1)
where the matrix ∂Φ/∂qij(D2u0) is positive deﬁnite at each x ∈
Ω, and the vector with
components ∂Ψ/∂pi(Du0) is nontangential at each x ∈∂Ω. Ω is an open set in RN with
sufﬁciently smooth boundary ∂Ω, D and D2 denote the gradient and the matrix of the
second-order derivatives with respect to the space variables x.
The theory of fully nonlinear parabolic equations and systems is not new. After a few
papers in the sixties and seventies dealing mainly with local existence and uniqueness of
regular solutions [23,25,26,38], big improvements came in the eighties with the papers of
Krylov about a priori estimates and existence large for second-order equations (see, e.g.,
the book [27]), and of Da Prato and Grisvard who initiated the theory of abstract fully
nonlinear parabolic equations in Banach spaces, in [12]. The latter paper was followed by
a series of works about geometric theory of fully nonlinear parabolic equations, an account
of which up to 1995 may be found in Chapters 8 and 9 of the book [33].
In the last years, a further impulse to the general theory was given by the study of mul-
tidimensional parabolic free boundary problems that can be transformed to ﬁxed boundary
ones by suitable changes of coordinates, and the resulting ﬁnal systems are fully nonlinear.
See [6–10,16,18–20,31].
Let us describe the contents of this chapter.
In Section 2 we give an overview on the theory of fully nonlinear parabolic equations
in Banach spaces, including the discussion about stability, instability, and invariant man-
ifolds of stationary solutions. Problems like (1.1) with the nonlinear boundary condition
Ψ (Du(t,x)) = 0 replaced by a linear one, such as u = 0 or ∂u/∂ν = 0, may be turned
into evolution equations in Banach spaces in a standard way. The function u is seen as a
function of the only variable t with values in a Banach space X of functions deﬁned in Ω,
i.e., setting U(t) = u(t,·) we rewrite (1.1) as
U′(t) = F

U(t)
	
,
t ⩾0,
U(0) = u0,
where F(U) = Φ(D2U) is deﬁned in (an open subset of ) a Banach space D ⊂X, and
the linear operator A = F ′(u0):D →X is the generator of an analytic semigroup. The
difference between the above problem and the more popular semilinear problems treated

388
A. Lunardi
for instance in [22] is that the nonlinearity is deﬁned in the domain of A instead of in some
intermediate space between X and D(A). This creates several technical difﬁculties that
will be described in Section 2.
In Section 3 we see in detail second-order equations in smooth domains of RN with fully
nonlinear boundary conditions such as (1.1) and their generalizations that cannot be treated
as immediate applications of the abstract theory. In Section 4 we discuss the principle of
linearized stability and the construction of invariant manifolds near stationary solutions of
these equations.
In Section 5 we show how the general theory may be applied to different parabolic
free boundary problems. As model problems we consider the free boundary heat equation,
arising in combustion theory,
ut = u,
t > 0, x ∈Ωt,
u = 0,
∂u
∂n = −1,
t > 0, x ∈∂Ωt,
(1.2)
and Stefan-type problems like the Hele–Shaw ﬂow,
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
u = 0,
t > 0,x ∈Ωt,
u = 0,
V = −∂u
∂n,
t > 0,x ∈Γt,
∂u
∂n = b,
t > 0,x ∈J,
(1.3)
where the unknowns are the open sets Ωt ⊂RN for t > 0 and the function u(t,x) for
t > 0, x ∈Ωt. In the boundary conditions, n = n(t,x) is the exterior normal vector to ∂Ωt
at x ∈∂Ωt. In the case of problem (1.3) we have N = 2 and the boundary of Ωt is made
by a ﬁxed known interior component J and a moving unknown exterior component Γt,
V represents the normal velocity of the free boundary Γt in such a way that V is positive
for expanding curves, and b ⩾0.
Our procedure is to reduce the free boundary problems to ﬁxed boundary ones by suit-
able changes of coordinates, and then to eliminate one of the unknowns (either u or the
free boundary), expressing it in terms of the other unknown, to get a ﬁnal problem for only
one unknown. In both cases the ﬁnal problem will be fully nonlinear, and nonlocal. In the
case of problem (1.2) we eliminate the free boundary and the ﬁnal problem is studied with
the methods of Sections 3 and 4. In problem (1.3) we eliminate u, and the ﬁnal problem is
studied with the methods of parabolic evolution equations in Banach spaces of Section 2.
2. Abstract parabolic problems
Let D, X be Banach spaces with respective norms ∥· ∥D, ∥· ∥, and such that D is contin-
uously embedded in X. We shall discuss the problem
u′(t) = F

t,u(t)
	
,
t > 0,
u(0) = u0,
(2.1)

Nonlinear parabolic equations and systems
389
where F :[0,T ] × O →X is a sufﬁciently smooth function, T > 0, and O is a neighbor-
hood of the initial datum u0 ∈D.
The abstract parabolicity assumption near u0 is that the operator A:D(A) = D →X,
A = Fu(0,u0) is sectorial.
DEFINITION 2.1. A linear operator A : D(A) →X is called sectorial if the resolvent set
ρ(A) contains a sector Σ = {λ ∈C: λ ̸= ω,|arg(λ −ω)| < θ} with ω ∈R, θ ∈(π/2,π),
and there is M > 0 such that ∥(λ −ω)R(λ,A)∥L(X) ⩽M for each λ ∈Σ.
We recall that if A is sectorial, the analytic semigroup generated by A is deﬁned by
e0A = I,
etA =
1
2πi

ω+γ
etλR(λ,A)dλ,
t > 0,
(2.2)
where r > 0, η ∈(π/2,θ), and γ is the curve {λ ∈C: |argλ| = η,|λ| ⩾r} ∪{λ ∈C:
|argλ| ⩽η,|λ| = r}, oriented counterclockwise. A summary of the general theory of secto-
rial operators and analytic semigroups in Banach spaces may be found in Chapter 2 of [33].
It is easy to see that if A:D(A) = D →X is sectorial and B ∈L(D,X) is small enough,
then A + B :D(A + B) = D →X is still sectorial. So we may assume without much loss
of generality that Fu(t,x):D →X is sectorial for each t ∈[0,T ] and x ∈O.
As a ﬁrst step we look for a local solution u ∈C([0,a];D) ∩C1([0,a];X) for some
a ∈(0,T ]. The most natural way to solve problem (2.1), at least locally, is by linearization
near u0. Setting G(t,x) = F(t,x) −Ax = F(t,x) −Fu(0,u0)x for t ∈[0,T ], x ∈O, we
rewrite problem (2.1) in the form
u′(t) = Au(t) + Gt,u(t)	,
t > 0,
u(0) = u0,
(2.3)
and we try to solve it by a ﬁxed point argument, i.e., we look at a solution as a ﬁxed point
of the operator Γ deﬁned by Γ u = v where v is the solution to the linear problem
v′(t) = Av(t) + G

t,u(t)
	
,
0 ⩽t ⩽a,
v(0) = u0.
(2.4)
The simplest space where to set the ﬁxed point would be (a closed ball in) C([0,a];D).
In this case, for every u in the ball, the function f (t) = G(t,u(t)) is in C([0,a];X), and
unless X and D are special spaces, well-known counterexamples show that in general
v does not belong to C([0,a];D), and Γ cannot map a ball of C([0,a];D) into itself.
Therefore, we turn to Hölder spaces where optimal regularity results and estimates for
linear problems are available.
Such optimal regularity results, needed to solve locally (2.1) and to describe the proper-
ties of the solution, are stated in the next section.
Note that these difﬁculties do not arise in semilinear equations, i.e., equations of the
type (2.4) where G is deﬁned in [0,a] × Y, Y being an intermediate space between

390
A. Lunardi
X and D(A). This is because if f (t) = G(t,u(t)) is in C([0,a];X) and u0 ∈D, the so-
lution v of (2.4) belongs to C([0,a];Y), provided Y satisﬁes the interpolatory embedding
property
∥y∥Y ⩽C

∥y∥X
	1−α
∥y∥D
	α,
y ∈Y,
for some C > 0, α ∈(0,1). In this case we have in fact v ∈C1−α([0,a];Y); see [33],
Chapter 4.
2.1. Optimal regularity in linear problems
Let us consider the problem
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t),
0 < t < a,
u(0) = u0,
(2.5)
where A is a linear sectorial operator in general Banach space X and f :[0,a] →X is
(at least) continuous.
DEFINITION 2.2. A classical solution to problem (2.5) is a function u ∈C([0,a];X) ∩
C((0,a];D(A)) ∩C1((0,a];X) that satisﬁes u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t) for 0 < t ⩽a and
u(0) = u0. A strict solution is a function u ∈C([0,a];D) ∩C1([0,a];X) that satisﬁes
u′(t) = Au(t) + f (t) for 0 ⩽t ⩽a and u(0) = u0.
It is well known that if problem (2.5) has a classical solution, then it is unique and is
given by the variation of constants formula,
u(t) = etAu0 +
 t
0
e(t−s)Af (s)ds,
0 ⩽t ⩽a.
We state below two optimal regularity results in Hölder spaces, whose proofs are due
to [32] and [36], respectively, and may be found in [33], Chapter 4.
We need to introduce a class of real interpolation spaces between X and D(A). For
0 < α < 1, the real interpolation space DA(α,∞) := (X,D(A))α,∞is characterized by
DA(α,∞) = x ∈X :t →v(t) =
t1−αAetAx
 ∈L∞(0,1),
∥x∥DA(α,∞) = ∥x∥+ [x]DA(α,∞) = ∥x∥+ ∥v∥∞.
(2.6)
The weighted Hölder space Cα
α((a,b];X) is deﬁned as the set of all bounded functions
f :(a,b] →X such that t →(t −a)αf (t) is α-Hölder continuous in (a,b]. The norm is
∥f ∥Cαα ((a,b];X) = ∥f ∥∞+ ∥(· −a)αf (·)∥Cα((a,b];X).

THEOREM 2.3. Let 0 < α < 1, f ∈Cα
α((0,T ];X), u0 ∈D(A). Then problem (2.5) has a
classical solution u such that u′ and Au belong to Cα
α((0,T ];X), t →tαu′(t) is bounded
with values in (X,D(A))α,∞, and there is C = C(T ) > 0, increasing in T , such that
u′


(X,D(A))α,∞
⩽C

∥f ∥Cαα ((0,T ];X) + ∥u0∥D(A)
	
.
(2.7)
If in addition f ∈C([0,T ];X) and Au0 + f (0) ∈D(A), then u′, Au ∈C([0,T ];X), and
u is a strict solution to problem (2.5).
THEOREM 2.4. Let 0 < α < 1, f ∈Cα([0,T ],X), u0 ∈D(A) be such that Au0 + f (0) ∈
(X,D(A))α,∞. Then both u′ and Au belong to Cα([0,T ],X), u′ is bounded with values
in (X,D(A))α,∞, and there is C = C(T ) > 0, increasing in T , such that
∥u∥C1+α([0,T ],X) + ∥Au∥Cα([0,T ],X) + sup
0<t<T

(X,D(A))α,∞
	
.
(2.8)
We emphasize that we need Hölder spaces because of the lack of optimal regularity in
spaces of continuous functions, in the sense that if f :[0,T ] →X is continuous, in general
it is not true that the u′ and Au in (2.5) are continuous with values in X. However, we
have optimal regularity in spaces of continuous functions if we replace X and D(A) by the
continuous interpolations spaces E0 = DA(α) and E1 = DA(α + 1), respectively.
For 0 < α < 1, the space DA(α) := (X,D(A))α is deﬁned as the closure of D(A) in
(X,D(A))α,∞. It may be characterized by
X,D(A)	
α =

x ∈X,D(A)	
α,∞: lim
t→0t1−αAetAx = 0

,
and it is a Banach space under the norm of (X,D(A))α,∞. The space DA(α + 1) is the
domain of the part of A in (X,D(A))α:
DA(α + 1) =

x ∈D(A): Ax ∈DA(α)

,
and it is endowed with the graph norm ∥x∥DA(α+1) = ∥x∥DA(α) + ∥Ax∥DA(α).
The following is a well-known result due to Da Prato and Grisvard [12].
THEOREM 2.5. Let 0 < α < 1, and let f ∈C([0,T ],DA(α)), u0 ∈DA(α + 1). Then the
solution u of problem (2.5) belongs to C([0,T ],DA(α + 1)) ∩C1([0,T ],DA(α)), and
there is C such that

2.2. The nonlinear problem
Here we collect several results about problem (2.1), that are proved using Theorems
2.3 and 2.4 as main tools.
The minimal assumptions on F :[0,T ] × O →X, O being an open set in D, are the
following:
(H1) The function (t,u) →F(t,u) is continuous with respect to (t,u) and it is Fréchet
differentiable with respect to u. There exists α ∈(0,1) such that, for all ¯u ∈O,
there are R = R(¯u), L = L(¯u), K = K(¯u) > 0 verifying
Fu(t,v) −Fu(t,w)

L(D,X) ⩽L∥v −w∥D,
F(t,u) −F(s,u)
 +
Fu(t,u) −Fu(s,u)

L(D,X) ⩽K|t −s|α
(2.10)
for all t, s ∈[0,T ], u, v, w ∈B(¯u,R) ⊂D.
(H2) For every t ∈[0,T ] and v ∈O, the Fréchet derivative Fv(t,v) is sectorial in X
and its graph norm is equivalent to the norm of D.
We now state the main local existence theorem.
THEOREM 2.6. Let O ⊂D be an open set. Let F :[0,T ] × O →X satisfy assump-
tions (H1) and (H2). Let u0 ∈O be such that F(0,u0) ∈
D. Then there is a maximal
τ = τ(u0) > 0 such that problem (2.1) has a solution u ∈C([0,τ);D) ∩C1([0,τ);X)
with the following properties.
(i) For every ε ∈(0,τ), u ∈Cα
α((0,τ −ε];D), u′ ∈Cα
α((0,τ −ε];X) and tαu′(t) is
bounded in (0,τ −ε] with values in (X,D)α,∞.
(ii) u is the unique solution of (2.1) belonging to

[0,τ −ε];D
	
for each ε ∈(0,τ).
(iii) u depends continuously on u0, in the sense that, for each ¯u ∈O such that
F(0, ¯u) ∈
D and for each ¯τ ∈(0,τ(¯u)), there are ϵ = ϵ(¯u, ¯τ) > 0, H = H(¯u, ¯τ) > 0 such
that if
u0 ∈O,
F(0,u0) ∈
D,
∥u0 −¯u∥D ⩽ϵ,
then τ(u0) ⩾¯τ and
u(·;u0) −u(·; ¯u)

(iv) If in addition F(0,u0) ∈(X,D)α,∞, then u is more regular up to t = 0, precisely
u ∈Cα([0,τ −ε];D) ∩C1+α([0,τ −ε];X) for each ε ∈(0,τ).

It is possible to obtain several further regularity results, as well as results of dependence
on parameters, stability of stationary solutions and of periodic orbits. See [33], Chapter 8.
The uniqueness part of the statement of Theorem 2.6 is not completely satisfactory.
In a sense it is natural, because we get uniqueness in the same space where we prove
existence of the solution. But a theorem of uniqueness of the strict solution, i.e., uniqueness
in C([0,a];D) ∩C1([0,a];D), is not available (except in special cases, of course), and
uniqueness of the strict solution is still an open problem.
Applying Theorem 2.5 gives well-posedness results for fully nonlinear problems in con-
tinuous interpolation spaces.
Let E1 ⊂E0 ⊂X be Banach spaces, let O be an open subset of E1, and let 0 < θ < 1,
T > 0. F :[0,T ] × O →E0 is a nonlinear function such that
(H3) F and Fx are continuous in [0,T ] × O, for every (¯t, ¯u) ∈[0,T ] × O, the operator
Fx(¯t, ¯u):E1 →E0 is the part in E0 of a sectorial operator L:D(L) ⊂X →X,
such that DL(θ) = E0, DL(θ + 1) = E1 with equivalence of the respective norms.
THEOREM 2.7. Let F satisfy assumption (H3), and let u0 ∈O. Then there is a maxi-
mal τ = τ(u0) > 0 such that problem (2.1) has a unique solution u ∈C([0,τ);E1) ∩
C1([0,τ);E0).
The solution depends continuously on u0, in the sense that, for each ¯u ∈O and for each
¯τ ∈(0,τ(¯u)), there are ϵ = ϵ(¯u, ¯τ) > 0, H = H(¯u, ¯τ) > 0 such that if
u0 ∈O,
∥u0 −¯u∥E1 ⩽ϵ,
then τ(u0) ⩾¯τ and
u(t;u0) −u(t; ¯u)

E1 +
ut(t;u0) −ut(t, ¯u)

E0 ⩽H∥u0 −¯u∥E1.
The original proof due to Da Prato and Grisvard was simpliﬁed and clearly written in [5].
See also [33], Chapter 8.
A geometric theory of fully nonlinear abstract evolution equations may be developed,
see [33], Chapter 9. Here we quote the principle of linearized stability and the construction
of stable, unstable, and center manifolds of stationary solutions made in [13], that will be
used in the applications to free boundary problems of Section 5.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the stationary solution is 0. In next The-
orems 2.8–2.11 we shall assume that F :O →E0 satisﬁes assumption (H3), O being a
neighborhood of 0 in E1, and that F(0) = 0. Moreover, we set
A = F ′(0).
THEOREM 2.8. The following statements hold true.
(i) If ωA := sup{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A)} < 0, then, for every ω ∈(0,ωA), there are r, M such
that if ∥u0∥E1 ⩽r then the solution u of (2.1) is deﬁned in [0,+∞), and

u′(t)

E0 ⩽Me−ωt∥u0∥E1,
t ⩾0.

(ii) If ωA > 0 and inf{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A),Reλ > 0} > 0, then the null solution of u′ =
F(u) is unstable in E1. Speciﬁcally, there exist nontrivial backward solutions of
u′ = F(u) going to 0 as t goes to −∞.
In the case where A is hyperbolic, i.e.,
σ(A) ∩iR = ∅,
(2.11)
a saddle point theorem may be shown. We denote by P the spectral projection associated
to the subset σ +(A) of σ(A) with positive real part,
P =
1
2πi

C
R(λ,A)dλ,
where C is any closed simple regular curve in {Reλ > 0} surrounding σ +(A).
THEOREM 2.9. Assume that (2.11) holds. Then there are positive numbers r0, r1 such
that
(i) There exist R0 > 0 and a Lipschitz continuous function
ϕ :B(0,r0) ⊂P(E0) →(I −P)(E1),
differentiable at 0 with ϕ′(0) = 0, such that for every u0 belonging to the graph of ϕ prob-
lem (2.1) has a unique backward solution v in C((−∞,0];E1), such that
sup
t<0
v(t)

E1 ⩽R0.
(2.12)
Moreover, ∥v(t)e−ωt ∥E1 →0 as t →−∞for every ω ∈(0,inf{Reλ: λ ∈σ +(A)}).
Conversely, if problem (2.1) has a backward solution v which satisﬁes (2.12) and
∥Pv(0)∥E0 ⩽r0, then v(0) ∈graphϕ.
(ii) There exist R1,r1 > 0 and a Lipschitz continuous function
ψ :B(0,r1) ⊂(I −P)(E1) →P(E0),
differentiable at 0 with ψ′(0) = 0, such that, for every u0 belonging to the graph of ψ,
problem (2.1) has a unique solution u in C([0,+∞);E1), such that
sup
t>0
u(t)

E1 ⩽R1.
(2.13)
Moreover, ∥u(t)eωt∥E1 →0 as t →+∞for every ω ∈(0,−supσ −(A)), where σ −(A) :=
{λ ∈σ(A),Reλ < 0}.
Conversely, if problem (2.1) has a solution u which satisﬁes (2.13) and ∥(I −
P)u(0)∥DA(θ+1,∞) ⩽r1, then u(0) ∈graphψ.

(iii) If in addition F ∈Ck(O;E0) and F (k) is Lipschitz continuous for some k ∈N, then
ψ and ϕ are k times differentiable, with Lipschitz continuous kth order derivatives.
As in the case of ordinary differential equations, the construction of center manifolds, or
center-unstable manifolds, is more delicate. In addition to (H3) and to F(0) = 0 we shall
assume that the set {λ ∈σ(A): Reλ ⩾0} consists of a ﬁnite-number of isolated eigenvalues
with ﬁnite algebraic multiplicity. We shall denote by P0 the spectral projection associated
to it. The fact that the range of P0 is ﬁnite-dimensional is of fundamental importance in the
proofs.
Applying P0 and I −P0 we see that problem
u′(t) = F

u(t)
	
,
t ⩾0,
is equivalent to the system

x′(t) = A+x(t) + P0Fx(t) + y(t)	,
t ⩾0,
y′(t) = A−y(t) + (I −P0)F

x(t) + y(t)
	
,
t ⩾0,
(2.14)
with x(t) = P0u(t), y(t) = (I −P0)u(t), A+ = A|P0(E0) :P0(E0) →P0(E0), A−=
A|(I−P0)(E1) :(I −P0)(E1) →(I −P0)(E0).
We modify F by introducing a smooth cutoff function ρ :P0(E0) →R such that
0 ⩽ρ(x) ⩽1,
ρ(x) = 1
if ∥x∥0 ⩽1/2,
ρ(x) = 0
if ∥x∥0 ⩾1.
Since P0(E0) is ﬁnite dimensional, such a ρ does exist. For small r > 0, we consider the
system

x′(t) = A+x(t) + f

x(t),y(t)
	
,
t ⩾0,
y′(t) = A−y(t) + gx(t),y(t)	,
t ⩾0,
(2.15)
with initial data
x(0) = x0 ∈P0(E0),
y(0) = y0 ∈(I −P0)(E0),
(2.16)
where
f (x,y) = P0Fρ(x/r)x + y	,
g(x,y) = (I −P0)Fρ(x/r)x + y	.
System (2.15) coincides with (2.14) if ∥x(t)∥E0 ⩽r/2, and it is possible to show that if
r and the initial data are small enough, then the solution of (2.15) and (2.16) exists in the
large.
A ﬁnite-dimensional invariant manifold M for system (2.15) with small r may be
constructed as the graph of a bounded, Lipschitz continuous function γ :P0(E0) →
(I −P0)(E1).

A. Lunardi
THEOREM 2.10. Under the above assumptions, there exists r1 > 0 such that, for r ⩽r1,
there is a Lipschitz continuous function γ :P0(E0) →(I −P0)(E1) such that the graph
of γ is invariant for system (2.15). If in addition F is k times continuously differentiable,
with k ⩾2, then there exists rk > 0 such that if r ⩽rk then γ ∈Ck−1, γ (k−1) is Lipschitz
continuous, and
γ ′(x)

A−x + f

x,γ (x)
		
= A+γ (x) + g

x,γ (x)
	
,
x ∈P0(X).
(2.17)
Then it is possible to see that the graph M of γ attracts exponentially all the orbits
which start from an initial datum sufﬁciently close to M. Moreover, each one of these
orbits decays exponentially to an orbit in M, in the sense speciﬁed by the next theorem.
THEOREM 2.11. Let F be twice continuously differentiable. For every ω > 0 such that
ω < −sup{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A), Reλ < 0} there are r(ω), M(ω) such that if ∥x0∥E0 and
∥y0∥E1 are sufﬁciently small, then the solution of (2.15) and (2.16) exists in the large
and satisﬁes

(2.18)
Moreover, there is C(ω) > 0 such that if ∥x0∥E0 and ∥y0∥E1 are small enough there exists
¯x ∈P0(E0) such that
x(t) −¯z(t)

(2.19)
where ¯z(t) = z(t;γ, ¯x) is the solution of
z′ = A+z + f

z + γ (z)
	
,
z(0) = ¯x.
(2.20)
As a consequence, the problem of the stability of the null solution to (2.1) in the critical
case
sup

Reλ: λ ∈σ(A)

= 0
(2.21)
is reduced to the stability of the null solution to a ﬁnite-dimensional system.
COROLLARY 2.12. Let O be a neighborhood of 0 in E1, and let F :O →E0 be a
C2 function satisfying (H3), with F(0) = 0. Assume that A = F ′(0) satisﬁes (2.21) and
that σ(A) ∩iR consists of a ﬁnite number of isolated eigenvalues with ﬁnite algebraic
multiplicity.
Then the null solution of (2.1) is stable (respectively, asymptotically stable, unstable) in
E1 if and only if the null solution of the ﬁnite-dimensional system (2.20) is stable (respec-
tively, asymptotically stable, unstable).
These stability results (precisely, Theorems 2.8–2.11 and Corollary 2.12) may be ex-
tended to the case where E0 and E1 are real interpolation spaces DL(θ,∞), DL(θ +1,∞)
instead of continuous interpolation spaces. See [33], Chapter 9.

2.3. Applications and drawbacks
Let us describe the applicability of the abstract theory in a simple signiﬁcant example,
Ω being a bounded open set in RN with regular boundary ∂Ω:
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
ut(t,x) = ΦD2u(t,x)	,
t ⩾0, x ∈Ω,
Bu(t,x) = 0,
t ⩾0, x ∈∂Ω,

x ∈Ω.
(2.22)
Here B is a ﬁrst-order differential operator with regular coefﬁcients,
Bu =

satisfying the nontangentiality condition
N

i=1
βi(x)νi(x) ̸= 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(2.23)
where ν(x) is the unit exterior vector normal to ∂Ω at x. We may consider also a Cauchy–
Dirichlet problem,

t ⩾0, x ∈Ω,
u(t,x) = 0,
t ⩾0, x ∈∂Ω,
u(0,x) = u0(x),
x ∈Ω.
(2.24)
The initial datum u0 is a regular (at least, C2) function satisfying the natural compati-
bility condition Bu0 = 0 at ∂Ω for problem (2.22), or u0 = 0 at ∂Ω for problem (2.24).
Moreover, Φ is a regular nonlinear function deﬁned in a neighborhoodof the range of D2u0
in RN2, satisfying an ellipticity assumption

(2.25)
and the symmetry condition
Φ(Q) = Φ

Q∗	
(2.26)
for every matrix Q with entries close to the range of D2u0.
Let us see how we can apply Theorem 2.6 to problem (2.22). The choice X = Lp(Ω),
D = {ϕ ∈W 2,p(Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω} does not work, because the function
F(ϕ)(x) = Φ

D2ϕ(x)
	
,
x ∈Ω,
(2.27)

398
A. Lunardi
does not map D into X, unless Φ has (not more than) linear growth. For instance, if Φ is
a quadratic polynomial then F maps D into Lp/2(Ω). Much worse, even if Φ has linear
growth, F is not differentiable unless Φ is linear.
After Lp and W 2,p, the simplest choice for the spaces D and X seems to be X = C( 
Ω),
the space of the continuous functions from 
Ω to R, and D = {ϕ ∈C2( 
Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω}.
If Φ is smooth enough, assumption (H1) is easily checked for the function F deﬁned
in (2.27).
But assumption (H2) does not hold, unless N = 1. Indeed, F ′(u0) is the realization of
the elliptic operator A in C( 
Ω) with the above boundary condition, where
(Aϕ)(x) =
N

i,j=1
∂Φ
∂qij

D2u0(x)
	
Diϕ(x)Djϕ(x),
x ∈Ω,
(2.28)
which is sectorial in C( 
Ω) thanks to the Stewart’s theorems [33], Chapter 3, and [39,40],
but whose domain contains properly C2( 
Ω). This is not due to the lack of regularity of
the coefﬁcients, or to the boundary condition, but it is a structural well-known difﬁculty,
shared by all the elliptic operators including the Laplacian: if ϕ and ϕ are continuous in
some open set, ϕ is not necessarily a C2 function. Of course, this difﬁculty disappears in
dimension 1. So, we may apply Theorem 2.6 with X = C( 
Ω) either in dimension N = 1,
or for special nonlinearities, for example, F(u)(x) = Ψ (u(x)), where we can take D as
the domain of the Laplacian in X. For the details, see [33], Chapter 8.
If we replace C( 
Ω) by its subspace Cθ( 
Ω) of the bounded and uniformly θ-Hölder
continuous functions, and we take D = {ϕ ∈C2+θ( 
Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω}, the function F
deﬁned in (2.27) satisﬁes (H1) if Φ is smooth enough, and the classical Schauder-type
theorems plus generation theorems in Hölder spaces (see, e.g., [33], Chapter 3) show that
also assumption (H2) is satisﬁed. So, Theorem 2.6 may be applied, and if the compatibility
condition F(u0) ∈
D holds, we get a local existence and uniqueness result. It is well known
that D is not dense in X, and that the closure of D in X is a set of little-Hölder continuous
functions: 
D = hθ( 
Ω).
The space hθ( 
Ω) may be characterized as the subset of C2+θ( 
Ω) consisting of the
functions ϕ such that
lim
h→0
sup
x,y∈Ω,0<|x−y|⩽h
|ϕ(x) −ϕ(y)|
|x −y|θ
= 0,
and it coincides with the closure of C∞( 
Ω) in Cθ( 
Ω) if ∂Ω is C∞. Similarly, h2+θ( 
Ω) is
the subset of C2+θ( 
Ω) consisting of the functions with second-order derivatives in hθ( 
Ω),
and it coincides with the closure of C∞( 
Ω) in C2+θ( 
Ω) if ∂Ω is C∞.
The assumption F(u0) ∈
D holds provided u0 ∈h2+θ( 
Ω). This extra regularity assump-
tion on the initial datum is preserved throughoutthe evolution because Theorem 2.6 implies
that u′(t) = F(u(t)) belongs to (X,D)α,∞⊂
D for t > 0. Therefore, the choice of working
in Hölder spaces leads naturally to little-Hölder spaces, and we can choose X = hθ( 
Ω),
D = {ϕ ∈h2+θ( 
Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω}, from the very beginning. Indeed, a Schauder-type
theorem and a generation of analytic semigroups theorem hold in the space of the little-
Hölder continuous functions, as follows (see, e.g., [33], Chapter 3):

THEOREM 2.13. Let 0 < θ < 1 and let ∂Ω be of class h2+θ. Assume that the coefﬁcients
aij , bi, c are in hθ( 
Ω) and satisfy the ellipticity condition
N

i,j=1
aij(x)ξiξj > 0,
x ∈

and that the coefﬁcients βi, γ are in h1+θ(∂Ω) and satisfy the nontangentiality condi-
tion (2.23). Let A, B be the differential operators deﬁned by A = N
i,j=1 aij(x)Dij +

i=1 biDi + c and B = N
i=1 βiDi + γ .
If ϕ ∈7
p>1 W 2,p(Ω) is such that Aφ ∈hθ( 
Ω), Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω, then ϕ ∈h2+θ( 
Ω), and
there exists C > 0, independent of φ, such that
∥ϕ∥C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽C

∥Aϕ∥Cθ( 
Ω) + ∥ϕ∥∞
	
.
The same conclusion holds if the boundary operator B is replaced by a trace operator.
THEOREM 2.14. Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.13 hold. Then the realization of the
operator A in hθ( 
Ω), with domain {ϕ ∈h2+θ( 
Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω}, is sectorial in hθ( 
Ω).
The application of Theorem 2.6 gives the following result.
THEOREM 2.15. Let 0 < θ < 1. Assume that ∂Ω is of class h2+θ, let the coefﬁcients βi,
γ ∈h1+θ(∂Ω) satisfy the nontangentiality condition (2.23), and let u0 ∈h2+θ( 
Ω) satisfy
the compatibility condition

βi(x)Diu0(x) + γ (x)u0(x) = 0,
x ∈∂Ω.
Let Φ be a C3 function deﬁned in a neighborhood of the range of D2u0, satisfying the
ellipticity condition (2.25) and the symmetry condition (2.26).
Then there exists a maximal τ > 0 such that problem (2.22) has a solution u(t,x) such
that t →u(t,x) belongs to C([0,τ);h2+θ( 
Ω)) ∩C1([0,τ);hθ( 
Ω)). For every ε ∈(0,τ)
and β ∈(0,1), u(t,·) ∈Cβ
β ((0,τ −ε];h2+θ( 
Ω)) and ut(t,·) ∈Cβ
β ((0,τ −ε];hθ( 
Ω)).
u is the unique solution to (2.22) with such regularity properties. Moreover, it depends
continuously on the initial datum u0 in the sense speciﬁed by statement (iv) of Theorem 2.6.
A further difﬁculty arises if the boundary operator B is replaced by the trace oper-
ator, i.e., if we consider problem (2.24) instead of (2.22). Simple counterexamples in
dimension 1 show that the realizations of second-order elliptic operators with smooth
coefﬁcients and Dirichlet boundary condition in Hölder and little-Hölder spaces are not
sectorial in general. The difﬁculty is due to the Dirichlet boundary condition, and it may
be avoided replacing Cθ( 
Ω) or hθ( 
Ω) by their subspaces consisting of functions that
vanish at the boundary. See [33], Chapter 3, for a discussion. In the case of the choice

400
A. Lunardi
X = hθ
0( 
Ω) = {φ ∈hθ( 
Ω): φ = 0 at ∂Ω}, the domain of F ′(u0) is the subset of h2+θ( 
Ω)
consisting of the functions ϕ such that ϕ and F ′(u0)ϕ vanish at ∂Ω; in general it does
not coincide with the domain of F ′(u1) for u1 ̸= u0. Therefore we are not able to ﬁnd a
common domain D to apply Theorem 2.6, unless Φ is of a special type. For instance, if
instead of a function Φ = Φ(D2u) we have Φ = Φ(D2u,Du,u) and Φ(q,p,0) = 0 for
each q and p, we are done, and a theorem similar to (2.15) holds.
Now let us see how we can apply Theorem 2.7. The space E is still C( 
Ω), F ′(u0) is the
realization of the operator A deﬁned in (2.28) with homogeneous boundary condition, and
DF ′(u0)(α) = h2α 
Ω
	
for α < 1/2, and
DF ′(u0)(α) = ϕ ∈h2α 
Ω 	: Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω
for α > 1/2. See [33], Chapter 3.
If u0 and ∂Ω are smooth enough, that is ∂Ω ∈h2+2α, u0 ∈h2+2α( 
Ω), Theorem 2.13
yields
DF ′(u0)(α + 1) = ϕ ∈h2+2α 
Ω 	: Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω
for α < 1/2, and
DF ′(u0)(α + 1) = ϕ ∈h2+2α 
Ω 	: Bϕ = 0,BF ′(u0)ϕ	 = 0 at ∂Ω
for α > 1/2.
With θ ∈(0,1) ﬁxed, we take α = θ/2 ∈(0,1/2) and we may apply Theorem 2.7, with
E0 = hθ( 
Ω), E1 = {ϕ ∈h2+θ( 
Ω): Bϕ = 0 at ∂Ω}. It is easy to see that the regularity
assumption in (H3) is satisﬁed if Φ is a C2 function, and the other assumptions in (H3) are
satisﬁed thanks to Theorems 2.13 and 2.14. The ﬁnal result is the following.
THEOREM 2.16. Let 0 < θ < 1. Assume that ∂Ω is of class h2+θ, let the coefﬁcients βi,
γ ∈h1+θ(∂Ω) satisfy the nontangentiality condition (2.23), and let u0 ∈h2+θ( 
Ω) satisfy
the compatibility condition

i=1
βi(x)Diu(x) + γ (x)u(x) = 0,
x ∈∂Ω.
Let Φ be a C2 function deﬁned in a neighborhood of the range of D2u0, satisfying the
ellipticity condition (2.25) and the symmetry condition (2.26).
Then there exists a maximal τ > 0 such that problem (2.22) has a unique solution u(t,x)
such that t →u(t,x) belongs to C([0,τ);h2+θ( 
Ω)) ∩C1([0,τ);hθ( 
Ω)). It depends con-
tinuously on the initial datum u0 in the sense speciﬁed in Theorem 2.7.

So, there is not much difference between this theorem and Theorem 2.15. Here we do
not get extra time regularity, but Φ can be taken of class C2 instead of C3. Substantially,
the applications of Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 to problem (2.22) give the same results.
In any case, problems with nonlinear boundary condition of the type G(Du(t,x)) = 0
for x ∈∂Ω, with nonlinear smooth G, cannot be treated by a direct application of The-
orems 2.6 and 2.7, even in the case of linear Φ. First, the boundary condition has to be
incorporated in the domain D (if we use Theorem 2.6) or in the domain E1 (if we use The-
orem 2.7), but D and E1 have to be linear spaces and the boundary condition is nonlinear.
Second, and more important, even if we rewrite the boundary condition as a linear bound-
ary condition plus the rest and then try to get rid of the rest using suitable trace theorems,
the domain of the linearized operator changes with u0. Take for instance Φ(D2u) = u,
X = hθ( 
Ω). Assuming that the linearized operator
ϕ →

Diϕ(x),

is nontangential, the realization of the Laplace operator in hθ( 
Ω), with domain D =
{ϕ ∈h2+θ( 
Ω): N
i=1 DiG(Du0(x))Diϕ(x) = 0 at ∂Ω}, is in fact sectorial but its domain
strongly depends on u0.
For this type of problems, a direct approach in Hölder spaces seems to be simpler and
more fruitful than applying abstract results. This approach is described in the next section.
3. Equations and systems in Hölder spaces
Throughout this section we shall consider an open set Ω ⊂RN with uniform C2+θ bound-
ary, 0 < θ < 1. This means that there is r > 0 such that for each x0 ∈∂Ω there is a C2+θ
diffeomorphism ϕ from the open ball B(x0,r) centered at x0 and with radius r to the unit
open ball in RN with the property that ϕ(Ω ∩B(x0,r)) = {(x,y) ∈R×RN−1: |(x,y)| <1,
x < 0}; moreover, the C2+θ norm of the diffeomorphisms and their inverses are bounded
by a constant independent of x0.
For k ∈N, Ck
b( 
Ω) denotes the space of the functions with continuous bounded deriva-
tives in 
Ω, and for k ∈N, 0 < θ < 1, Ck+θ( 
Ω) denotes the subspace of Ck
b( 
Ω) consisting
of the functions with uniformly θ-Hölder continuous kth order derivatives.
We shall use the parabolic Hölder spaces Cθ/2,θ(I × 
Ω), C1/2+θ/2,1+θ(I × 
Ω),
C1+θ/2,2+θ(I × 
Ω), I being a real interval, 0 < θ < 1, with the usual meanings and norms.
We recall that a function w belongs to Cθ/2,θ(I × 
Ω) if and only if w is bounded and,
moreover,

N

i=1
∥Diw∥∞+ [w]C1/2+θ/2,1+θ(I× 

The space C1+θ/2,2+θ(I × 
Ω) is deﬁned similarly; w belongs to C1+θ/2,2+θ(I × 
Ω)
if and only if w is bounded, there exist the derivatives wt, Dij w for i, j = 1,...N,
and they belong to Cθ/2,θ(I × 
Ω). It is easy to see that in this case w belongs also to
C1/2+θ/2,1+θ(I × 
Ω). The norm is
∥w∥C1+θ/2,2+θ (I× 

by means of a smooth (C2+θ) atlas for ∂Ω. There exists Cθ > 0 such that, for
every w ∈Cθ/2,θ(I × 
Ω), we have ∥w|I×∂Ω∥Cθ/2,θ (I×∂Ω) ⩽Cθ∥w∥Cθ/2,θ (I× 
Ω), and sim-
ilarly, for every w ∈C1/2+θ/2,1+θ(I × 
Ω), we have ∥w|I×∂Ω∥C1/2+θ/2,1+θ(I×∂Ω) ⩽
Cθ∥w∥C1/2+θ/2,1+θ (I× 

Under these conditions, problem (1.1) is the simplest signiﬁcant example of a fully non-
linear parabolic problem with fully nonlinear boundary condition. We give a complete
proof of the local existence theorem for (1.1) because it exhibits the typical difﬁculties of
fully nonlinear problems, but the technical points are reduced to the minimum and it is
easy to see to which extent the proof itself may be generalized.
Also, in this case we need an optimal regularity theorem for linear equations, the popular

Now we are ready for the proof of the local existence and uniqueness theorem.
THEOREM 3.2. Let Ω be an open set in RN with uniform C2+θ boundary, 0 < θ < 1. Let
Φ :O1 →R be a C2 function satisfying (3.2) and (3.1), and let Ψ :O2 →R be a C3 func-

(3.11)
We have to choose T and R in such a way that Γ is well deﬁned, it maps Y into itself,
it is a contraction with constant less than 1, and the unique ﬁxed point of Γ in Y is in fact
the unique solution to (1.1).
For Γ be well deﬁned, for every u ∈Y the ranges of D2u(t,·) and of Du(t,·) need
to be contained in O1 and in O2. If O1 contains the closure of the neighborhood of the
range of D2u0 with radius r1 and O2 contains the closure of the neighborhood of the range
of Du0 with radius r2, we take T , R such that
T θ/2R ⩽r1
2 ,
T 1/2+θ/2R ⩽r2
2 .
(3.12)
So, the compositions Φ(D2u) and Ψ (Du) are well deﬁned for each u ∈Y, and they belong
to Cθ/2,θ([0,T ] × 
Ω) and to C1/2+θ/2,1+θ([0,T ] × 
Ω), respectively. The compatibility
condition (3.8) holds, and then by Theorem 3.1 problem (3.11) has a unique solution w ∈
C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × 
Ω).
Let us prove that Γ is a 1/2-contraction for suitable T and R. The constants C(T ) given
by Theorem 3.1 increase with T . So we take
T ⩽1.

Now we check that Γ maps Y into itself if T , R are suitably chosen. For each u ∈Y, we
write Γ u = Γ (u −u0) + Γ u0. We already know that if (3.12), (3.13), (3.16) hold then
Γ (u −u0)

Therefore, Γ maps Y into itself provided ∥Γ u0 −u0∥C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ]× 
Ω) ⩽R/2. The func-
tion w = Γ (u0) −u0 is the solution to (3.9) with f = Φ(D2u0), g = −Ψ (Du0), w0 = 0,
and its C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × 
Ω) norm is not small in general if T is small. We only have,
by estimate (3.10),

(3.17)
In conclusion, if (3.12), (3.13), (3.16) and (3.17) hold, Γ is a 1/2-contraction that maps
Y into itself, so that it has a unique ﬁxed point u in Y.

To ﬁnish the proof we have to show that u is the unique solution to (1.1) in
C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × 
Ω). This is done in a standard way.
If (1.1) has two solutions u and v, set t0 = sup{t ∈[0,T ]: u = v in [0,t] × 
Ω}. If t0 = T
then u = v in the whole [0,T ] × 
Ω and the proof is ﬁnished; if t0 < T , we consider the
initial-boundary value problem

where w0(x) = u(t0,x) = v(t0,x). The above proof shows that (3.18) has a unique

Ω): w(t0,·) = w0,∥w −

Ω) and than ∥v−v(t0,·)∥C1+θ/2,2+θ ([t0,T ]× 
Ω)
we get u = v in [t0,t0 +T ′]× 
Ω, and this contradicts the deﬁnition of t0. Therefore, t0 = T
and u ≡v.
□
With a little extra effort it is possible to prove that the solution depends continuously on
the initial datum.
COROLLARY 3.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, ﬁx any u0 ∈C2+θ( 
Ω) such
that the range of D2u0 is contained in O1, the range of Du0 is contained in O2, and
Ψ (Du0(x)) = 0 at ∂Ω. Then there exist r > 0, K > 0 such that, for each v0 ∈C2+θ( 
Ω)
with ∥v0 −u0∥C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽r and satisfying the compatibility conditions Ψ (Dv0(x)) = 0
at ∂Ω, the solution v(t,x) of problem (1.1) with initial datum v0 is deﬁned in [0,T ] × 
Ω,
where T > 0 is given by Theorem 3.2, and
∥u −v∥C1+θ/2,2+θ ([0,T ]× 
Ω) ⩽K∥u0 −v0∥C2+θ( 
Ω).
PROOF. We follow the notation of the proof of Theorem 3.2. If we take r < r1/2, r < r2/2
and deﬁne
Y1 = u ∈C1+θ/2,2+θ[0,T ] × 
Ω 	:
u(0,·) = v0,∥u −v0∥C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ]× 
Ω) ⩽R

,
with T and R chosen as in the proof of Theorem 3.2. Then, for each u ∈Y1, the ranges
of D2u and of Du are contained in the neighborhoods of the ranges of D2u0 and of Du0
with radii r1, r2, respectively, according to (3.12). Since u−v is a solution to problem (3.9)
with f (t,x) = Φ(D2u(t,x))−Φ(D2v(t,x))−A(u−v)(t,x), g(t,x) = B(u−v)(t,x)−
Ψ (Du(t,x)) + Ψ (Dv(t,x)), w0 = u0 −v0, combining estimate (3.10) with the estimates
of the proof of Theorem 3.2 we get

and the statement follows with K = 2C.
□
The proofs of Theorem 3.2 and of its corollary indicate that they may be extended to
more general situations.
First of all, we may allow more general nonlinearities, such as Φ = Φ(t,x,u,Du,D2u)
and Ψ = Ψ (t,x,u,Du). See, e.g., [33], Chapter 8. The nonlinear boundary condi-
tion may be replaced by a Dirichlet boundary condition, u(t,x) = g(t,x) with g ∈
C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × ∂Ω), and the proof comes out shorter.
Second, the nonlinearities may also be nonlocal: the essential property of Φ that we used
in the proof was just that the function F(u) = Φ(D2u)−Au is differentiable near u0, with
locally Lipschitz continuous (null at u0) derivative, as a function from C2
b( 
Ω) to Cb( 
Ω),
and from C2+θ( 
Ω) to Cθ( 
Ω), and moreover, that
F ′(u)v

Cθ( 
Ω) ⩽
F ′(u)

L(C2

Ω)
+
F ′(u)

L(C2+θ( 
Ω),Cθ( 
Ω))∥v∥C2
b( 
Ω).
Third, the proof is not conﬁned to a single second-order equation but it works as well
for higher-order equations and systems. This is because optimal regularity theorems in
parabolic Hölder spaces similar to Theorem 3.1 are available for higher-order equations
and systems [34,37]. A detailed proof for a general class of second-order systems with
Dirichlet boundary condition is in [1].
A completely different approach is in [24].
4. Existence at large and stability
Existence at large for arbitrary initial data is a hard task in the fully nonlinear case. The
results available up to now concern only second-order equations. The difﬁculty is due to
the fact that we need a priori estimates in a very high norm, substantially in a C1+θ/2,2+θ
a norm, to get existence at large; therefore the nonlinearities have to satisfy severe restric-
tions. See [27,30] for further detailed discussion and comments.
On the other hand, existence in the large and stability for initial data close to stationary
solutions or more generally to established given solutions, is a quite developed subject.
For initial data close to stationary solutions, the proof of the local existence Theorem 3.2
is easier, and it can be extended to a very general class of perturbations. We quote a result
from [7], concerning problem

Here the stationary solution is u ≡0. In [7] a bounded Ω is taken into consideration, but
the proofs are easily extended to unbounded open sets. The assumptions on F and G are
the following.

THEOREM 4.1. Let Ω and the operators A, B deﬁned in (3.4), (3.6), satisfy the assump-
tions of Theorem 3.1. If (H4) holds, for every T > 0, there are r, ρ > 0 such that (4.1) has
a solution u ∈C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × 
Ω) provided ∥u0∥C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽ρ. Moreover, u is the
unique solution in B(0,r) ⊂C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ] × 

So, if ∥w0∥C2+θ( 

Γ :

Actually, thanks to the compatibility condition Bw0 = G(w0) and the regularity of F(w)
and G(w), the range of Γ is contained in C1+θ/2,2+θ([0,T ]× 
Ω). Moreover, Theorem 3.1

and w0 is so small that

In our example (4.1), assumption (H4) is satisﬁed with F(φ) = Φ(D2φ) −Aφ, G(φ) =
Ψ (Dφ)−Bφ, if Φ, Ψ satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, where O1, O2 are neighbor-

Theorem 4.1 states that if 0 is a stationary solution then the solution to (4.1) is deﬁned in
an arbitrary large time interval provided the initial datum is small enough. The next natural
question is now the stability of the null solution. We shall see that the principle of linearized
stability holds, and that in the hyperbolic case local stable and unstable manifolds may be
constructed, just like in the case of ordinary differential equations. To do this we shall see
again our nonlinear problem as a perturbation of a linear one, and the main tools will be
optimal regularity/asymptotic behavior results for the linear case, stated in the next section.
4.1. Asymptotic behavior in linear problems
Let us consider again the operators A and B deﬁned in (3.4) and (3.6). The realization A

which are always true if Ω is bounded, because in this case the domain of A is compactly
embedded in C( 
Ω), the resolvent operators (λI −A)−1 are compact, and the spectrum
consists of a sequence of eigenvalues.
If (4.4)(ii) holds, σ +(A) is closed. We denote by P + the spectral projection associated
to σ +(A), i.e.,
P + =
1
2πi

C
R(λ,A)dλ,
where C is any closed simple regular curve in {Reλ > 0} surrounding σ +(A).
If (4.4)(i) holds, σ −(A) is closed, and we denote by P −the spectral projection associ-
ated to σ +(A), i.e.,
P −= I −P,
P =

R(λ,A)dλ,
where now C is any closed simple regular curve surrounding σ(A) \ σ −(A) with index 0
with respect to all points in σ −(A). If the spectrum of A does not intersect the imaginary
axis, then P −= I −P +.
We also need a deeper insight into the solution to (3.9). We shall consider a represen-
tation formula for w, that is an extension of the well-known Balakrishnan formula (see,

If B is the normal derivative, we are done. If Bv = β(y)∂/∂x plus derivatives with respect
to y, we deﬁne (Ng)(x,y) = (Ng)(x,y)/β(y).
The case of a general open set with uniform C2+θ boundary is reduced to this one
in a standard way, by locally stretching the boundary and using partitions of unity. See
for instance [34], where more general lifting operators were constructed for systems of
m boundary conditions.

4.2. Principle of linearized stability and local invariant manifolds
With the aid of Theorems 4.3, 4.5 and Corollary 4.4 we may show similar behavior for
the solutions to fully nonlinear problems with initial data close to stationary solutions,
provided the linearized operator near the stationary solution under consideration satisﬁes
assumption (4.4)(i) or (4.4)(ii). For the proofs see [7].
THEOREM 4.6. Let Ω be an open set in RN with uniform C2+θ boundary, 0 < θ < 1,
let the operators A and B satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3.1, and let F, G, satisfy
assumption (H4).
(i) If sup{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A)} < 0 then the stationary solution u = 0 of problem (4.1)
is stable with respect to the C2+θ( 
Ω) norm. More precisely, for every ω ∈
(0,−sup{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A)}), there are C, r > 0 such that for every u0 satisfying (3.8)
and ∥u0∥C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽r, the solution of (4.1) with initial datum u0 exists at large and
satisﬁes

Ω) ⩽Ce−ωt∥u0∥C2+θ( 

(ii) If σ(A) contains elements with positive real part and (4.4)(ii) holds, then u = 0 is
unstable in C2+θ( 
Ω).
We recall that if Ω is bounded then (4.4)(ii) is satisﬁed, and Theorem 4.6 looks like the
usual principle of linearized stability for ordinary differential equations. If Ω is unbounded,
it may happen that (4.4)(ii) is not satisﬁed. However, it is still possible to give an instability
result, relying on the next theorem taken from Henry’s book [22].
THEOREM 4.7. Let X be a real Banach space. Let T be a map from a neighborhood of the
origin in X with T (0) = 0, let M be a bounded linear operator on X with spectral radius r
greater than 1, and let
T (x) = Mx + O

∥x∥p	
as x →0,
for some constant p > 1. Then the origin is unstable for the iterates of T , i.e., there exists
a constant C > 0 and there exists x0 arbitrarily close to 0 such that, if xn+1 = T (xn) =
T n+1(x0) for n ∈N, then for some N (depending on x0), the sequence x1,x2,...,xN is
well deﬁned and ∥xN∥⩾C.
If G≡0 in problem (4.1), we can apply Theorem 4.7 with X= {u0 ∈C2+θ( 
Ω): Bu0 = 0;
at ∂Ω}, T (u0) = u(1;u0) is the solution of (4.1) with initial datum u0, evaluated at time
t = 1 (the lifetime of the solution is bigger than 1 provided ∥u0∥C2+θ( 
Ω) is small enough,
by Theorem 4.1). Then T nu0 = u(n;u0), M = eA, p = 2, and the spectral radius of M is
equal to exp(ωA) where ωA = sup{Reλ: λ ∈σ(A)} because the spectral mapping theorem
holds for analytic semigroups. So, if ω > 0, Theorem 4.7 implies that the null solution
of (4.1) is unstable in C2+θ( 
Ω).
For a nonvanishing function G the set I of admissible initial data for problem (4.1),
I = {u0 ∈C2+θ( 
Ω): ∥u0∥C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽r,Bu0 = G(u0)}, is not a neighborhood of 0 in a
linear space. However, we shall see in Lemma 4.8 that it is the graph of a regular function
deﬁned in a neighborhood of 0 in D(Aθ), where D(Aθ) is the domain of the part of A
in C2+θ( 
Ω):
D(Aθ) =

The already mentioned lifting operator N is a right inverse of the function C2+θ( 
Ω) →
C1+θ(∂Ω), u →Bu, so that C2+θ( 
Ω) is the direct sum D(Aθ) ⊕(I −Π)(C2+θ( 
Ω)),
where Π is the projection on D(Aθ) = KerB given by
Πu = u −NBu.
LEMMA 4.8. There is a neighborhood O of 0 in C2+θ( 

a smooth function

PROOF. Deﬁne J :B(0,r) ⊂C2+θ( 
Ω) →C1+θ(∂Ω),
J(ϕ) = Bϕ −G(ϕ),
with r < R, see assumption (H4). Then J is smooth and J ′(0) = B is an isomorphism from
(I −Π)(C2+θ( 
Ω)) to C1+θ(∂Ω). Moreover, B|D(Aθ) = 0. It is sufﬁcient now to apply the
implicit function theorem.
□
COROLLARY 4.9. Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.6, if σ(A) contains elements with
positive real part then the origin is unstable in C2+θ( 
Ω).

T (x0) = Π

u

1;x0 + H(x0)
		
,
where ρ is given by Theorem 4.1 with T = 1, u(1,x0 +H(x0)) is the solution of (4.1) with
initial condition u(0) = x0 + H(x0).
We shall show that the derivative of T at x0 = 0 is M = eAθ |D(Aθ), and that
T (x0) −eAθ x0

C2+θ( 
Ω) ⩽C∥x0∥2
C2+θ( 

(4.14)
so that the assumptions of Theorem 4.7 are satisﬁed with p = 2 and r = eωA. Applying
Theorem 4.7 gives immediately instability of the null solution to (4.1).
Estimate (4.14) is a consequence of the construction of the solution to (4.1), as a ﬁxed
point of the operator Γ , see Theorem 4.1. Indeed, from the representation formula (4.5)
and estimates (4.2) it follows that

∥u∥C1+θ/2,2+θ ([0,T ]× 

Corollary 4.9 improves part (ii) of Theorem 4.6; however, it is not completely satisfac-
tory because the C2+θ( 
Ω) norm is very strong and consequently the instability result is
rather weak. We can improve the instability result using a reﬁnement of Theorem 4.7, see
proof in [9].
THEOREM 4.10. Let the conditions of Theorem 4.7 be satisﬁed, and assume in addition
that the spectral radius r of M is an eigenvalue. Let ¯u ∈X be an eigenfunction and x′ ∈X′
(the space of all linear continuous functions from X to R) be such that x′(¯u) ̸= 0. Then
there are C′ > 0 and initial data x0 arbitrarily close to 0 such that if xn+1 = T (xn) =
T n+1(x0) for n ∈N, then, for some N (depending on x0), the sequence x1,x2,...,xN is
well deﬁned, x′(xN) has the same sign x′(¯u), and |x′(xN)| ⩾C′.
COROLLARY 4.11. Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.6, suppose moreover that ωA is
an eigenvalue of A, and let ¯u be an eigenvector. If x′ ∈(C2+θ( 
Ω))′ is such that x′(¯u) ̸= 0,
then there is C′ > 0 such that for every δ > 0 there are u0 ∈I with norm less or equal
to δ, and N ∈N such that the corresponding solution u of (4.1) is deﬁned at T = N and
|x′(Πu(N,·))| ⩾C′.
The element x′ ∈(C2+θ( 
Ω))′ may be, for instance, the evaluation of ϕ or of some ﬁrst-
or second-order derivative of ϕ at some point. In this case Corollary 4.11 gives pointwise
instability. Let us show this in a simple example.
EXAMPLE 4.12. Consider the problem

where Ω is either a bounded open set with C2+θ boundary, or a halfplane, F, G are smooth
functions deﬁned in a neighborhood of 0 in RN2, RN, respectively, vanishing at 0 with all
their ﬁrst order derivatives, and a > 0.
Then ωA = a > 0, and Corollary 4.9 implies that the null solution is unstable
in C2+θ( 
Ω).
We get a much better instability result using Corollary 4.11. ωA is an eigenvalue of A
with constant eigenfunctions. Therefore for each x0 ∈
Ω the mapping ϕ →ϕ(x0) is an
element of (C2+θ( 
Ω))′ that does not vanish on the eigenfunction 1. Corollary 4.11 implies
that there is C′ > 0 such that, for every δ > 0, there are u0 ∈I with norm less or equal to δ,
and N ∈N such that the solution u of (4.1) is deﬁned at T = N and |(Πu(N,·))(x0)| ⩾C′.
Since Πu = u −NBu, if N satisﬁes (Ng)(x0) = 0 for each g, we have (Πu(N,·))(x0) =
u(N,x0), and hence
u(N,x0)
 ⩾C′.

From the construction of N in Lemma 4.2 we know that Ng vanishes at ∂Ω for every g.
If x0 ∈Ω, taking δ small enough in the proof of Lemma 4.2 we may let (Ng)(x0) = 0 for
each g, and (4.17) follows.
Now we go further in the description of the behavior of the solutions for small initial
data, showing the existence of the local stable and unstable invariant manifolds. The fol-
lowing results were proved in [7].
THEOREM 4.13. Let the assumptions of Theorem 4.6 hold.

The graph of ϕ is called local unstable manifold. The graph of ψ is called local stable

In the case where the operator A is hyperbolic, i.e., (2.11) holds, both the local stable
manifold and the local unstable manifold exist, and Theorem 4.13 is a saddle point theo-

What is missing up to now is a center manifold theory for problems with fully non-
linear boundary condition. Boundary conditions of the type Bu = G(u) with nonlinear G
may be treated; see [35]. But existence of a center manifold in the case where G depends
nonlinearly on the gradient is still an open problem.
5. The fully nonlinear approach to free boundary problems
A class of free boundary problems of parabolic type may be reduced to abstract evolution
equations of the type treated in Section 2, or to evolution equations in Hölder spaces of the
type treated in Sections 3 and 4.
The prototypes of these problems are (1.2) and (1.3). The different physical nature
of these problems is reﬂected in their different mathematical nature. Equation (1.3) is a
Stefan-type problem, where the velocity of the free boundary is explicit, while in (1.2) it is
implicit.
However, the initial step to reduce the free boundary problems to ﬁxed boundary ones
by natural changes of coordinates that involve one of the unknowns is the same for both
models. After that, the procedures are different: we eliminate the free boundary and arrive
at a ﬁnal problem of the type (4.1) for (1.2), we eliminate u and we arrive at a ﬁnal problem
for the free boundary of the type (2.1) for (1.3).
Equations (1.2) and (1.3) are the simplest signiﬁcant examples of a wide class of par-
abolic free boundary problems, that can be studied with the same methods. We mention the
papers [14,15,19,20] for problems of the type (1.3), arising in several ﬁelds, such as ﬂow
of viscous ﬂuids through porous media, the injection molding process, diblock copolymer
melts; and [6–10,31] for problems of the type (1.2), arising in combustion theory.
5.1. Hele–Shaw models
Let Ω ⊂RN be a bounded open set with smooth boundary, consisting of two disjoint
nonempty parts J and Γ . For each t, the free boundary Γt will be sought as the range of
an unknown function s(t,·) ∈h2+α(Γ ;RN) with small C1 norm, in such a way that the
mapping ξ →ξ + s(t,ξ)ν(ξ) is an h2+α diffeomorphism between Γ and Γt, and Γt and
J are disjoint. Here and in what follows we denote by ν = ν(ξ) the exterior normal vector
to ∂Ω at ξ ∈∂Ω. Ωt will be the open set diffeomorphic to Ω with boundary J ∪Γt.
Problem (1.3) is associated with an initial condition
s(0,ξ) = s0(ξ),
ξ ∈Γ.
(5.1)
Now we transform the free boundary problem (1.3) into a ﬁxed boundary one.
For a > 0, we deﬁne a map
X :Γ × [−a,a] →RN,
X

ξ′,r
	
= ξ′ + rν

ξ′	
.
(5.2)
If a is sufﬁciently small, then (5.2) is a diffeomorphism to a compact neighborhood
R of Γ . In R every ξ can be written in a unique way as ξ = X(ξ′,r) with ξ′ ∈Γ and

Nonlinear parabolic equations and systems
425
r ∈[−a,a]. So, ξ′ = ξ′(ξ) is the nearest point to ξ in Γ , and r = r(ξ) is the signed
distance from ξ to Γ .
We will look for Ωt close to Ω in some time interval I in the sense that its free boundary
Γt will be given by
Γt = x = ξ′ + st,ξ′	νξ′	,ξ′ ∈Γ ,
(5.3)
where s :Γ × I →[−a,a] is a smooth function which is one of the unknowns of the
problem. In other words, Γt is the zero level set of the function
R →R,
ξ →N(t,ξ) = r(ξ) −s

t,ξ′(ξ)
	
.
It follows that the exterior normal vector at Γt is given by ν = DN/|DN|, and the normal
velocity V at x ∈Γt is
V (t,x) = −∂/∂tN(t,x)
DN(t,x)
= ∂s(t,ξ′(x))/∂tN(t,x)
DN(t,x)
.
The equation V = −∂u/∂ν in (1.3) may be rewritten as
Nt(t,x) =
.
Du(t,x),DN(t,x)
/
,
t > 0,x ∈Γt.
It will be convenient to extend the vector ﬁeld
Φ(t,ξ) = s(t,ξ)ν(ξ),
ξ ∈Γ,
(5.4)
to the whole of RN, by setting
Φ(t,ξ) =
α(r)s

t,ξ′	
ν

ξ′	
if ξ ∈R,
0
otherwise,
(5.5)
where r = r(ξ), ξ′ = ξ′(ξ), and α :R →[0,1] is a smooth molliﬁer which is equal to 1
near 0 and has compact support in (−a,a).
The extension Φ is used now to transform (1.3) to a problem on the ﬁxed domain Ω.
We deﬁne the coordinate transformation
x = Θ(t,ξ) = ξ + Φ(t,ξ).
(5.6)
Note that Θ(t,·) differs from the identity only in a small neighborhood of Γ , and it maps
Ω onto Ωt.
Denoting by ˜u the unknown u in the new variables, i.e., ˜u(t,ξ) = u(t,ξ + Φ(t,ξ)), the
couple (s,u) satisﬁes (1.3)–(5.1) if and only if (s, ˜u) satisﬁes

Note that A = A(s), B = B(s) depend on s through Φ.
Now we are able to decouple the system (5.7), expressing ˜u in terms of s.

proved in [18].

THEOREM 5.1. If a > 0 is small enough for each β ∈(0,1), the function F :Vβ := {s ∈
h2+β(Γ ): ∥h∥C1(Γ ) < a} →h1+β(Γ ) is smooth.
Assume that b(x) ⩾0 for each x ∈J, and that b ̸≡0. Then, for each s ∈Vβ, the operator
Aβ = −F′(s):h2+β(Γ ) →h1+β(Γ ) is a sectorial operator in h1+β(Γ ).
Theorem 5.1 allows to apply the theory of Section 2.
We recall that the little-Hölder spaces hβ(Γ ) are stable by continuous interpolation, in
the sense that for nonintegers β1 < β2 we have

hβ1(Γ ),hβ2(Γ )
	
θ = hβ1+θ(β2−β1)(Γ )
for each θ ∈(0,1) such that β1 +θ(β2 −β1) is not integer. In particular, for 0 < β < α < 1
we have
h1+α(Γ ) =

h1+β(Γ ),h2+β(Γ )
	
θ
(5.13)
with θ = α −β.
We ﬁx 0 < β < α < 1 and we set E0 = h1+α(Γ ), E1 = h2+α(Γ ). By Theorem 5.1, the
function F = −F is deﬁned and smooth in an open set O = Vα ⊂E1 with values in E0,
for each s ∈O, F ′(s) = Aα is sectorial, and it may be seen as the part in E0 of the sectorial
operator Aβ :h2+β(Γ ) →h1+β(Γ ). By (5.13) we have DAβ (θ) = h1+α(Γ ) = E0, and by
Theorem 5.1 we have DAβ(θ + 1) = E1, provided θ = α −β. Therefore, assumption (H3)
is satisﬁed and Theorem 2.7 is applicable. We arrive at a ﬁnal well-posedness theorem;
see [18].
THEOREM 5.2. Let Ω ⊂RN be a bounded smooth domain with boundary J ∪Γ , J ̸= ∅
interior to Γ and with positive distance from Γ . Let b ∈h2+α(J) (0 < α < 1) be such that
b(x) ⩾0 for each x ∈J, and b ̸≡0.
Then for each s0 ∈h2+α(Γ ) with small C1 norm there are T > 0 and a classical
solution (s,u) of (1.3)–(5.1) in [0,T ]. The function s is such that t →s(t,·) is in
C([0,T ];h2+α(Γ )) ∩C1([0,T ];h1+α(Γ )), and ∥s(t,·)∥C1(Γ ) ⩽a. Denoting by Ωt the
bounded open set with boundary J ∪Ranges(t,·), u is continuous in {(t,x): 0 ⩽t ⩽T,
x ∈
Ωt} and u(t,·) belongs to h2+α( 
Ωt) for each t ∈[0,T ]. The couple (s,u) is the unique
solution to (1.3)–(5.1) enjoying these regularity properties.
Problem (1.3) is the simplest example of a class of free boundary problems that can
be treated similarly. Among them we quote one- and two-phase Hele–Shaw models with
surface tension, also called Mullins–Sekerka models. See [14,15,18–20].
Let us describe the two-phase problem. Ω is again a bounded open set in RN with
smooth boundary ∂Ω. For t ⩾0, Γt is a compact connected hypersurface which is the
boundary of an open set Ωt ⊂Ω. The normal velocity of Γt and its mean curvature are
denoted by V (t,·) and κ(t,·), respectively. Again, V is taken to be positive for expanding
hypersurfaces, and κ is positive for uniformly convex hypersurfaces. Ω1(t) and Ω2(t) are

428
A. Lunardi
the open subsets of Ω separated by Γt, Ω1(t) being the interior region; n(t,·) is the unit
exterior vector normal to ∂Ω1(t). We consider the system

(5.14)
where the brackets denote the jump across the free boundary: [∂u/∂n] = ∂u1/∂n −
∂u2/∂n, uj being the restrictions of u on Ωj(t). As before, the unknowns are the free
boundary Γt for t > 0 and the function u(t,x) for t > 0, x ∈
Ω, while the initial hypersur-
face Γ0 is given.
The procedure described for the Hele–Shaw ﬂow gives local existence and uniqueness
of a regular solution to (5.14) for each regular (precisely: h2+α) initial hypersurface Γ0.
Any smooth hypersurface Γ ⊂Ω ﬁxed, for initial data close to Γ we look for Γt as the
graph of an unknown function s(t,·) deﬁned on Γ , and we proceed as before. We eliminate
the unknown u, expressing it in terms of s. More precisely, u(t,·) has to be the solution v to

with σ = s(t,·), the ﬁxed open sets Ω1 and Ω2 are the images Ω1(t) and Ω2(t) un-
der the change of coordinates, and K(σ) is the transformed mean curvature opera-
tor after the change of coordinates. The jump condition V = −[∂u/∂n] is transformed
to st + B(s)v = 0, where now B(s) is the transformed jump of the normal derivative
across Γt. So we arrive at a ﬁnal equation for s of the type (5.12), where now F is a third-
order nonlocal operator with quasilinear structure. This is because the curvature depends
on s through its derivatives up to the second-order, in a quasilinear way since it depends
linearly on the second-order derivatives of s. The character of (5.12) is still parabolic and
F is still smooth; more precisely, it was proved in [19] that if a > 0 is small enough, for
each β ∈(0,1) the function F :Uβ := {s ∈h3+β(Γ ): ∥h∥C1(Γ ) < a} →hβ(Γ ) is C∞, and
the operator Aβ = −F′(s):h3+β(Γ ) →hβ(Γ ) is a sectorial operator in h1+β(Γ ).
So, as far as local existence, uniqueness and regularity are concerned, we are not forced
to use Theorem 2.7 but we can use other theories of abstract quasilinear evolution equa-
tions in Banach spaces, that allow less regular initial data. In the paper [19] the theory
developed in [2,3] was used to arrive at a ﬁnal result of existence and uniqueness of
a solution to (5.12), s ∈C∞((0,T ] × Γ ), such that t →s(t,·) ∈C([0,T ];h2+β(Γ )) ∩
C((0,T ];h3+β(Γ )), for each initial datum s0 ∈h2+β+ε(Γ ), ε > 0, with small C1 norm.
The number T > 0 depends on s0. If in addition s0 ∈h3+β(Γ ), then t →s(t,·) ∈
C([0,T ];h3+β(Γ )). (The last statement comes by applying Theorem 2.7 with E0 =
hβ(Γ ), E1 = h3+β(Γ ).)
Returning to (5.14) we get a unique regular local solution (Γt,u).
It is easy to see that (5.14) admits spheres as stationary solutions, and it is of interest to
study their stability. Any sphere S ⊂Ω ﬁxed, we need to know some spectral properties

of the linearized operator A = −F′(0):h3+β(S) →hβ(S). It was proved in [20] that the
spectrum of A consists of a sequence of negative eigenvalues plus the semisimple isolated
eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity N +1. Therefore, this is a critical case of stability. The center
manifold theory of Section 2, with E0 = hβ(Γ ), E1 = h3+β(Γ ), may be applied, and it
gives the existence of an (N + 1)-dimensional locally invariant manifold M ⊂h3+β(S)
which attracts all the small orbits. Going further in the analysis, it was proved in [20]
that the center manifold itself consists of spheres, and for each small initial datum the
solution exists at large and converges to one of these spheres exponentially as t →∞.
The convergence is in the h3+β(S) norm, even for initial data in h2+β+ε(S). See [20] for
the details.
5.2. Models from combustion theory
Perhaps surprisingly, well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for (1.2) is still an open prob-
lem in dimension N ⩾2. The Cauchy problem consists of (1.2) supplemented by an initial
condition,
u(0,x) = u0(x),
x ∈
Ω0,
(5.16)
where Ω0 is a given open set in RN. There are results of existence of weak solutions
without uniqueness [11], of existence and uniqueness of regular classical solutions with
loss of regularity with respect to the inital data [6], of local well-posedness for initial
data close to special solutions such as traveling waves or self-similar solutions [7] and
for special geometries [4,21,29]. But none of them can be considered a standard well-
posedness result.
We describe here the approach leading to the fully nonlinear evolution equations dis-
cussed in Section 3. The change of coordinates used here is the same as in the previous
section, taking as reference set Ω the initial set Ω0. Let us assume that Ω0 is a nonempty
open set in RN with C3+α boundary Γ . The boundary Γt of Ωt is sought again as the
range of an unknown function s(t,·):Γ →RN. The coordinate transformation (5.6) trans-
forms Ωt into the ﬁxed domain Ω0 and it leads to a Cauchy problem for the couple (s, ˜u)
where ˜u(t,ξ) = u(t,x) is again the function u in the new coordinates:

System (5.17) still has to be decoupled. Instead of proceeding like in problem (1.3), we
introduce a new unknown w by splitting ˜u as
˜u(t,ξ) = u0(ξ) + .Du0(ξ),Φ(t,ξ)/ + w(t,ξ).
(5.18)
At t = 0 we have ˜u(0,ξ) = u0(ξ), Φ(0,·) ≡0, so that
w(0,ξ) = 0,
ξ ∈
Ω0.
(5.19)
Equation (5.18) allows to get s in terms of w thanks to the boundary condition u = 0 at Γt,
which gives
s(t,ξ) = w(t,ξ),
t ⩾0,ξ ∈Γ0,
(5.20)
so that

where ˜ν(ξ) is the extension of the normal vector ﬁeld in formula (5.5): ˜ν(ξ) = α(r)ν(ξ′)
if ξ ∈R and ˜ν(ξ) = 0 otherwise. Replacing (5.21) in (5.17) we get
wt = F1

and from

(5.24)
replacing Φ = w(t,ξ′)˜ν(ξ).
Equation (5.22) still contains st, that we eliminate using again the identity s = w at the
boundary which gives st = wt. Replacing in (5.22) for ξ ∈Γ0, we get

1 −F2(ξ,w,Dw)

ξ,w,Dw,D2w

t ⩾0,ξ ∈Γ0.
At t = 0 we have w ≡0, and F2 vanishes at (ξ,0,0), so that, at least for t small,
F2(·,w(t,·),Dw(t,·)) is different from 1 and we get st in terms of w,
st = F3

Note that F(0)(ξ) = u0(ξ) and F(w)(ξ) = w + u0(ξ) if ξ is far from the bound-
ary Γ0.
The function F(v) is deﬁned for v ∈C2( 
Ω0) with small C1 norm; precisely, it is de-
ﬁned for v ∈C2( 
Ω0) such that 1 −F2(·,v(·),Dv(·)) ̸= 0. From formulas (5.20) and
(5.23)–(5.25) we see that F(v)(ξ) depends smoothly on v, Dv, D2v and their traces at
the boundary; therefore the function v →F(v) is continuously differentiable from O =
{v ∈C2( 
Ω0): ∥v∥C1( 
Ω0) ⩽r} to C( 
Ω0), and from Oα = {v ∈C2+α( 
Ω0): ∥v∥C1( 

to Cα( 

The boundary condition for w comes from the boundary condition ∂u/∂n = −1 in (1.2).

t ⩾0,ξ ∈Γ0,
(5.29)
when we replace Φ = w(t,ξ′)˜ν(ξ) in (5.28). The function G(ξ,u,p) is smooth with re-
spect to u and pi, i = 1,...,N, and its derivatives are continuous in (ξ,u,p) and C1/2+α/2
in ξ. It follows that v →G(·,v,Dv) is smooth from a neighborhood of 0 in C1( 
Ω0)
to C(Γ0), and from a neighborhood of 0 in C1+α( 
Ω0) to Cα(Γ0). Moreover, G(ξ,0,0) = 0.
Concerning the linear parts of F and G near 0, the following lemma was proved in [6].
LEMMA 5.3. Fv(0) is the sum of the Laplacian plus a nonlocal differential operator of
order 1. Moreover,
Gv(0)w = Bw := ∂w
∂ν + ∂2u0
∂ν2 w.
The ﬁnal problem for the only unknown w may be rewritten in the form discussed in

(5.30)
The difference between (5.30) and (1.1) is that the linear operator A and the nonlin-
earities F, G contain nonlocal terms. The nonlocal part of A concerns only ﬁrst-order
derivatives, so that it may be considered as a nonimportant perturbation. F depends non-
locally also on the second-order derivatives of w, but it is (at least) quadratic near w = 0.

432
A. Lunardi
The arguments used in the proof of Theorem 3.2 work also for (5.30), and give a local ex-
istence and uniqueness result for w. Precisely, there is R0 > 0 such that for every R ⩾R0
and for every sufﬁciently small T > 0 problem (5.30) has a unique solution in the ball
B(0,R) ⊂C1+α/2,2+α([0,T ] × 
Ω0). For the details of the proof see [6].
Note that we cannot use Theorem 4.1 to get local existence for w because F(0) ̸= 0.
Now we return to the original problem (1.2). Recalling that s(t,ξ) = w(t,ξ) for each
t ∈[0,T ], ξ ∈∂Ω, we can deﬁne Γt. Of course, s has the same regularity of w, i.e., it is
in C1+α/2,2+α([0,T ] × Γ0). Then we deﬁne ˜u through (5.18), where Φ is given by (5.5).
Again, ˜u has the same regularity of w. As a last step we deﬁne u through the change
of coordinates, u(t,x) = ˜u(t,ξ), where x = ξ + Φ(t,ξ). This leads to loss of regularity:
starting with initial data in C3+α we get a local solution with C2+α space regularity. The
ﬁnal result (see [6]) is the following.
THEOREM 5.4. Let Ω0 ⊂RN be a nonempty bounded open set with C3+α bound-
ary Γ0, and let u0 ∈C3+α( 
Ω0) satisfy the compatibility conditions u0 = 0, ∂u0/∂n = −1
at Γ0. Then there is T > 0 such that problem (1.2) has a solution (Ωt,u) such that the
(N + 1)-dimensional hypersurface S = {(t,x): 0 ⩽t ⩽T,x ∈Γt} and each Γt = ∂Ωt
are of class C1+α/2,2+α, and the function u:{(t,x);0 ⩽t ⩽δ,x ∈
Ωt} →R is of class
C1+α/2,2+α.
If in addition Γ0 and u0 are in C4+α, and the further compatibility condition
B(u0) = 0 at Γ0 holds, then S and each Γt are of class C3/2+α/2,3+α, and the func-
tion u is of class C3/2+α/2,3+α. Moreover, the couple (Ωt,u) is the unique solution with
such regularity properties.
If the initial data are close to the initial datum (Ω,U) of a given regular solution, the
same method gives existence and uniqueness of a local classical solution without loss of
regularity. Moreover, we can go further in the investigation of the stability properties of the
established solution.
The free boundary problem is transformed into a ﬁxed boundary problem in Ω by the
change of coordinates (5.6), so that the unknown s is the signed distance from Γ = ∂Ω.
The splitting of (5.18) is replaced by
˜u(t,ξ) = U(ξ) + .DU(ξ),Φ(t,ξ)/ + w(t,ξ),
ξ ∈
Ω.
(5.31)
This gives again s(t,ξ) = w(t,ξ) for ξ ∈Γ . The ﬁnal problem for w has initial datum
w0 = ˜u0 −U −⟨DU,Φ(0,ξ)⟩which does not vanish, but is small.
Let us show how to apply the results of Section 4. The simplest situation would be to
have initial data close to stationary solutions, but (1.2) has no bounded stationary solutions.
So we consider the case where (Ω0,u0) is close to the initial datum of a self-similar
solution. Existence and properties of self-similar solutions have been discussed in [11];
they are solutions of the type (Ωt,u) where

It is easy to see that there exist self-similar solutions only for α = β = 1/2, and that the

that there exist a unique r > 0 and a unique C2 function f :[0,r] →R satisfying (5.32)
and such that f (η) > 0 for 0 ⩽η < r. Moreover, f is analytic.
It is convenient now to transform the problem to self-similar variables

1/2, plus a sequence of negative eigenvalues; moreover, the eigenspace with eigenvalue 1
is one-dimensional, the eigenspace with eigenvalue 1/2 has dimension N.
The principle of linearized stability as stated in Theorem 4.6(ii) shows that the null
solution of (5.37) is unstable in C2+θ( 
Ω), and therefore the self-similar solution of the
original problem (1.2) is unstable. This is not surprising, because the original problem is
invariant under translations in x and t; if we apply a small shift to (5.36), we obtain another
self-similar solution which is transformed by (5.33) and (5.34) into a solution which starts
close to (5.36) but moves far from it. Therefore, the local unstable manifold of (5.36) given
by Theorem 4.13(i) must contain the images under (5.33) of shifts in space and time of
(5.36), that are given by

1 + ϵ2etU
x −ϵ1et/2
√ϵ2et + 1

,
(5.38)
with ϵ1 ∈RN and ϵ2 ∈R. Since the local unstable manifold has to be (N +1)-dimensional,
then it consists only of the images of (5.38) under the transformation (5.33). However, all
the orbits in the unstable manifold have the same self-similar proﬁle, so that the equilibrium
(5.36) looks stable even if it is unstable. Roughly speaking, the proﬁle itself is stable.
The above discussion is taken from [7]. A study of the stability of the (planar) traveling
wave solutions to (1.2) is in the paper [8]. Stability questions for more complicated multi-
dimensional free boundary equations and systems arising in combustion theory have been
studied by these methods in the papers [9,10,31] and in the papers quoted therein.

Kinetic formulations of parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs: From theory to numerics
439
1. Introduction
The method of kinetic formulations can now be understood as a method to handle conserv-
ative Partial Differential Equations with a large family of entropies. By entropies we mean
here conservation laws built on nonlinear functions of the unknown. When these entropies
can be parametrized, the corresponding parameters can be considered as extra variables
and, after simple manipulations, the equation can be linearized or at least reduced to a ‘less
nonlinear’ equation. Why is this useful: simply because in the best cases it rises a linear
equation where linear methods such as convolution, Fourier transform can be used. For the
same reason it also allows to derive numerical schemes in a quite natural way with good
stability properties. From this point of view the systems of gas dynamics (with temperature
or with barotropic pressure) are particularly interesting.
Indeed, the motivation behind the study of kinetic formulations is to understand the
derivation of the compressible Euler equation from Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann
equation for dilute gases is written
∂
∂t fε + ξ · ∇xfε = 1
ε Q(fε,fε),
(1)
where the constant ε represents the mean free path of particles and fε(t,x,ξ) is the density
of particles which at time t and at position x move with the velocity ξ. Also Q(f,f )
is Boltzmann’s quadratic collisional operator; see Cercignani [9], Cercignani, Illner and
Pulvirenti [10], Glassey [28], Lions [43], Villani [63], and for general introductions to
kinetic equations see also Dautray and Lions [14] and Perthame [50]. Equation (1) formally
provides the Euler system of compressible ﬂows as ε →0, the so-called hydrodynamic
limit. For strong solutions, some rigorous results can be found in the above references. It is
an open problem to understand the functional analysis behind this limit for weak solutions
(with shocks) although the case of incompressible limit is now well understood [31]. The
idea behind the kinetic formulation is to pass to the limit as simply as possible in (1). With
some natural a priori bounds on fε, we can extract a subsequence still denoted ε such that
fε →f as ε →0, then we obtain, passing to the limit in (1),
∂
∂t f + ξ · ∇xf = T (t,x,ξ) ∈D′.
(2)
What is this object T := limε→0 1
εQ(fε,fε), what are its properties, how do they char-
acterize the limit and what do they imply on the solution f ? Answering these questions
would provide a kinetic formulation for gas dynamics equations. A question which is still
open. For this reason only simpler examples have been carried out completely.
The idea to use a kinetic variable in quasilinear hyperbolic scalar conservation laws goes
back to two independent works by Brenier [7] and Giga and Miyakawa [27] where a time
discretization and some kind of linearization were introduced where the kinetic formalism
appears. The full kinetic formulation (passing from a time discretization to a continuous
equation with the correct right-hand side) is introduced by Lions, Perthame and Tadmor
[42] in the case of scalar conservation laws, this means that the right-hand side in (2)

440
B. Perthame
is identiﬁed for this case. Bounded domains, and the deﬁnition of traces was treated by
Vasseur [62] using compactness arguments derived form the kinetic formulation. The case
of the 2 × 2 system of barotropic (isentropic) gas dynamics is treated in [46] and the way
to use its kinetic formulation for proving global existence of weak (entropy) solutions is
due to [44] (with an improvement on the possible pressures in [11]). Another but related
approach can also be found in [4] and the references therein. General 2 × 2 systems are
treated in [53]. A recent overview of the subject is given in [49], with more details and
other examples.
This presentation begins with the case of parabolic–hyperbolic equations in the case of
a nonisotropic degenerate diffusion (Section 2). In the case of hyperbolic equations, we
show how to arrive to a regularity result for the solution. We also present a weaker concept
kinetic representation and illustrate it with a class of numerical schemes for gas dynamics
equations, the so-called kinetic schemes.
2. Kinetic formulation of parabolic–hyperbolic conservation laws
Although the kinetic formulation arises naturally as the hydrodynamiclimit of kinetic equa-
tions; see (1) and (2), it can also be seen as a mathematical object related to nonlinear
parabolic–hyperbolic scalar conservation laws, this is the point of view we adopt here. We
also consider degenerate nonisotropic diffusions as they were treated in [12]. We begin
with the nondegenerate case and then consider the degenerate case as a vanishing viscosity
limit.
2.1. Nondegenerate diffusions
To explain this concept, we consider ﬁrst the nondegenerate case, a case where existence
of a unique family of smooth solutions with decay at inﬁnity is standard to establish. Then
the problem is to ﬁnd a smooth, vanishing at inﬁnity, real valued function u(t,x) deﬁned
for t ⩾0, x = (x1,x2,...,xd) ∈Rd, and which solves the quasilinear parabolic equation

At least this inequality makes sense as a measure in ξ, i.e., testing it against nonnegative
continuous functions of ξ.
To proceed further in analyzing the consequences of these entropy inequalities, we in-
troduce the function (from R2 into R),
χ(ξ;u) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
+1
for 0 < ξ < u,
−1
for u < ξ < 0,
0
otherwise.
This function is related to several deep problems especially to weak limits of oscillating
bounded sequences un(x) and to Young measures (see [47,49]). Indeed, it gives a repre-
sentation of any function S(u) as follows

R
S′(ξ)χ(ξ;u)dξ = S(u) −S(0).
(11)
Therefore, when a sequence of functions un converges in L∞−w∗, it allows us to study
the limit of all the limits S(un) for all smooth functions S.
We claim that the family of equalities (5) is equivalent to write in D′((0,∞) × Rd+1)
the so-called kinetic formulation (recall that ξ is a real-valued variable here).
PROPOSITION 2.1. Equation (5) is equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding a function u(t,x)
such that, in the sense of distributions,
∂

In fact, n is a bounded nonnegative measure thanks to (8), also, thanks to (10) and usual
continuity arguments,
n ∈C0

where M1 denotes the Banach space of bounded Radon measures.
We now indicate the reason why the kinetic formulation holds true.
DERIVATION OF THE KINETIC FORMULATION (12). Using the chain rule in (12) we have

= 0;
an equation which is equivalent to the parabolic conservation law (3) for smooth solutions.
Another way to see the equivalence is to multiply (12) by S′(ξ) (a test function) and
integrate dξ. Then one still recovers the entropy equalities (5) which are equivalent to
parabolic equation (3).
□
2.2. Degenerate diffusions
The interest of this formalism appears for degenerate diffusions (ν = 0) and especially in
the hyperbolic case Aij = 0. Then possible singularities of the solution (shock waves for
instance) make that the chain rule is no longer available. The kinetic formulation, however,
holds true with the only difference that the measure in the right-hand side is no longer
deﬁned explicitly by (13). It is replaced by a bounded measure ˜n(t,x,ξ) ⩾n(t,x,ξ). De-
generate diffusions correspond to the assumption,
aij(u) is a symmetric matrix.
(14)
They can be obtained passing to the limit as ε vanishes in the family of solutions uε asso-
ciated with the nondegenerate diffusion matrix εI + (aij). It is possible to prove that this
is a strong limit in any Lp spaces, 1 ⩽p < ∞, when we assume that u0 ∈L1 ∩L∞(Rd) is
ﬁxed independently of ε. In order to state correctly the limit problem we need the notations

A fundamental remark is that this equality still holds in the limit ε →0, and this allows to
deﬁne, for weak solutions, the nonlinear term arising in the entropy relation. Then, we end

Before we give consequences of this deﬁnition, we give some explanations. The entropy
dissipation measure m appears here because we have to take into account the weak limit

A consequence of this deﬁnition is the following theorem.

This is a linear kinetic equation, with analogies with the Boltzmann equation (1), which
acts on the function χ(ξ :u). The nonlinearity is hidden in the nonlinearity of this func-
tion χ and also in the singular right-hand side m + n.
2.3. Applications of the kinetic formulation
Several applications of the kinetic formulation exist. We list them without further details
on the proofs and simply give references for the proofs.
Regularity of the solutions is a real issue in the degenerate case. This kind of equations
are L1 contractions and thus they propagate initial regularity because, for all h ∈Rd, we
have
u(t,x + h) −u(t,x)

L1(Rd) ⩽
u0(x + h) −u0(x)

L1(Rd).
A more interesting question is therefore the possibility of regularizing effects. Such effects
can be deduced from the method in Section 3 for the hyperbolic case under a nondegen-
eracy condition on the hyperbolic ﬂux a(·). The parabolic part helps in the arguments and
thus the same results hold in the degenerate parabolic case. However, more elaborate non-
degeneracy conditions can be found that combine both the hyperbolic ﬂux ai(·) and the
diffusion matrix aij(·). They can be proved using tools as averaging lemmas. See [45] and,
for more recent and elaborate results, Tao and Tadmor [57].
Another range of applications is to uniqueness of the solution. This question has raised
much interest since Kruzkov’s [39] variable doubling method in the hyperbolic case which
was extended to parabolic–hyperbolic equations by Carillo [8] for isotropic diffusions (see
also Eymard et al. [24]). Another method in the hyperbolic case [49] is based on the ki-
netic formulation and differs technically from Kruzkov’s original method. In [12] it was
extended to the entropy solutions to the parabolic–hyperbolic nonisotropic case.
The kinetic formulation also introduces a natural tool to treat L1 datas withdrawing
the L∞assumption; in Theorem 2.4 we call them kinetic solutions. Indeed, (23) makes a
perfect sense when u(t,x) ∈L∞([0,∞);L1(Rd)) while quantities like ai(u) or aij(u) do
not belong to L1
loc, when ai or aij have superlinear growth at inﬁnity (although regularizing
effects in Lp can be derived related to the growth of the ﬂux function at inﬁnity; see [49]).
As a summary, the following result holds:
THEOREM 2.4 [12]. Assume that a(·) ∈L∞
loc(R;Rd) and (14), (15) hold for some ma-
trices σ ∈L∞
loc(R;Rd×d). For u0 ∈L1(Rd), there exists a unique kinetic solution u ∈
C([0,∞);L1(Rd)) for the Cauchy problem (3). If u0 ∈L∞∩L1(Rd), then the kinetic
solution is the unique entropy solution and |u(t,x)| ⩽∥u0∥L∞(Rd).
As another application of kinetic formulations, we mention that the construction of solu-
tions can also be performed by a kinetic approximation. This is a rather simple and efﬁcient

approximation, again related to the basically linear structure of the kinetic formulation. The
idea is to use a semilinear relaxation method of the type

.
(24)
The convergence of this kind of approximation can be studied by methods à la Kruzkov;
see [49] and Belhadj et al. [3] for a nonisotropic diffusion.
Related to this relaxation method is the time splitting method that motivated Brenier [7]
and Giga and Miyakawa [27] in their earlier work (see also [61,62]). These authors propose
the following procedure in order to approximate (5) (actually, these papers deal with the
hyperbolic cases aij = 0). Being given the initial data u0(x) and a time step t > 0, one
solves successively (for n = 0,1,...) the linear kinetic equations
∂

dξ.
This method can be viewed as a ﬁrst step towards a full space–time discretization. The
L1 contraction argument allows to show that this method converges as t →0 towards a
solution to (5). Extensions to systems is a much harder topic which has been carried out by
Vasseur [59,60].
3. Hyperbolic scalar laws: Regularizing effects



∂

Ai(u) = 0,
u(t = 0,x) = u0(x).

Such an equation admits several weak solutions because of the nonuniqueness related to
appearance of singularities (shocks) in ﬁnite time. The continuation of a solution after the

448
B. Perthame
shock can be performed in different way, leading to several possible solutions. The unique
entropy solution is a natural one but entropy dissipation is not true for all solutions; cf.
Dafermos [13], Serre [56], Hwang and Tzavaras [32] and Godlewski and Raviart [29]. For
instance, one could consider the limit ε →0 of diffusion–dispersion equations as (say in
one space dimension to simplify)
∂
∂t u + ∂
∂x A(u) = ε ∂2
∂x2 u + βε2 ∂3
∂x3 u,
which limit depends on the parameter β because nonclassical, i.e., nonentropic shocks are
obtained in the limit (see Freistühler [26] and Leﬂoch [41]).
This consideration leads us to assume that the entropies can be controlled but in a weaker
way that we did it in Section 2. Namely, we assume a condition on the family of Kruzkov’s
entropies (9)
∂
∂t Sξ(u) +


Rd |m|(t,x,ξ)dt dx ⩽μ(ξ)
∀ξ ∈Rd, μ ∈L∞
0 (R),
(27)
where L∞
0 (R) denotes the Banach space of bounded functions that vanish at inﬁnity. In
the entropy case we recall that m is nonnegative and that the above bound is available as
we proved it in (22) and (10). This leads, following the arguments of previous section to a
kinetic formulation
∂
∂t χ(ξ;u) + a(ξ) · ∇xχ(ξ;u) = ∂
∂ξ
m(t,x,ξ).
(28)
Actually, such a situation arises passing to the limit in several types of examples. Multi-
dimensional relaxation of hyperbolic systems or diffusive–dispersive limits, see Hwang
and Tzavaras [32]. Another, and unexpected such situation also arises in a model for
thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms. More precisely several constrained variational problem arising in
Ginzburg–Landautheory lead, in a singular limit, to a hyperbolic equation similar to (25) in
one space dimension (Ambrosio et al. [1] and Desimone et al. [18]). A kinetic formulation
thus holds true which can be used to analyze the problem; see the papers [15,33,34,39].
We also refer to [23] for another nonentropic situation.
Below we present a typical example of application of the kinetic formulation and we
derive regularity in Sobolev spaces. We have the following:
THEOREM 3.1 [34]. Let u(t,x) ∈L∞(R+ × Rd) satisfy (26), (27) and assume the nonde-
generacy condition, for all (k,τ) ∈Rd × R with |k|2 + τ 2 = 1,
meas

ξ such that |ξ| ⩽R and
a(ξ) · k −τ
 ⩽ε

⩽Cε.

2.
REMARK 3.2. A recent counterexample by De Lellis and Westdickenberg [16] shows
that the exponent 1/3 is sharp even in dimension d = 1. Therefore weak solutions to (25)
which are not entropy solutions may lack BVloc regularity. Their argument is based on
the construction of a family of solutions with nonentropic shocks in which the size of the
discontinuity, and the distance in between, are controlled in a clever asymptotic way. It
is also related, but not so directly, to another example given in [1] on the regularity of
minimizers in the above mentioned micromagnetism problems.
REMARK 3.3. Kinetic formulation is also a step in order to provide another type of reg-
ularity which is not expressed in terms of Sobolev spaces. More precisely the paper [15]
actually shows that the singularity set of a solution u(t,x) is d-dimensional in Haussdorf
sense. The proof relies on the geometric theory of measures. A similar characterization of
the singularity set can be found in [2] for the related variational problem.
We do not detail here the proof of Theorem 3.1. It is an improvement of a similar conclu-
sion in [45] for the entropy solution (with a proof using strongly the contraction property
of entropy solutions). The idea is that ξ regularity of the function χ can improve the expo-
nents of averaging lemmas as explained in Section 3.2.
Another related result goes in the direction of reducing as much as possible the nonde-
generacy condition on the ﬂuxes A(·). Of course we still have to discard the linear case
where no regularizing effect can hold true because initial oscillations propagate. The next
statement extends a previous result of Tartar [58] in dimension 1 based on compensated
compactness [48] or the books [13,56,47].
THEOREM 3.4 [45]. Let un be a bounded sequence in L∞(R+ × Rd) of distributional
solutions to (25). Assume also the nondegeneracy condition,
meas

ξ such that |ξ| ⩽R and
a(ξ) · k −τ
 = 0

= 0 ∀τ ∈R,k ∈Sd−1,
(30)
with R = supn ∥u0
n∥L∞. Then, un is locally relatively compact in Lp(R+ × Rd) for all
1 ⩽p < +∞.
The proof is also based on the theory of averaging lemmas for kinetic equations and we
present it now.
3.2. Averaging lemmas for kinetic equations
In order to show the various ways one can work in order to arrive at the above results we
would like to present several stages of averaging lemmas. First, what averaging lemmas

450
B. Perthame
say, second why the derivative structure of the right-hand side looses some regularity, and
how one can use the regularity of χ to arrive to Theorem 3.1.
We restrict our presentation to the L2 case for the simplicity of notations and to the
case of usual kinetic equations where the transport velocity is denoted by ξ. We refer to
DiPerna et al. [21,52] and Bouchut [5,34] for other cases of interest. Especially to work
in Lp spaces requires interpolation arguments that cannot be used directly on the solution
itself but has to be realized at the level of Fourier multipliers that appear naturally in the
proof. Interpolation between L2 and L1 lead to understand Calderòn–Zygmund theory
in the framework of kinetic equations and, to be optimal, this uses special Hardy spaces
(product H1 spaces). This is one of the most technical issues behind averaging lemmas.
Recently, Jabin and Vega [35] introduced another method for averaging based on T ◦T ∗
type of arguments and which improve the Lp spaces in which regularizing effects hold
true.
The most elementary averaging lemma is as follows:
THEOREM 3.5 [30]. Let ψ ∈L∞(Rd), suppψ ⊂B(R) (ball of radius R centered at ori-
gin). Let f,g ∈L2(R1+2d) satisfy
∂
∂t f + ξ · ∇xf = g,
(31)
and set
ρψ(t,x) :=

Rd ψ(ξ)f (t,x,ξ)dξ.
(32)
Then we have
∥ρψ∥˙H 1/2(Rd+1) ⩽C

d,R,∥ψ∥L∞	
∥f ∥1/2
L2(R2d+1)∥g∥1/2
L2(R2d+1).
(33)
REMARK 3.6. As it is, this statement does not apply to the Cauchy problem because
of the lack of global L2 integrability in time. But after time truncation we recover the
situation (33) and thus the result can be applied in usual situations.
In order to give an idea of the ingredients behind averaging lemma, we give a proof of
this simple case.
PROOF OF THEOREM 3.5. The proof is based on Fourier transform in space and time. We
deﬁne
ˆf (τ,k,ξ) =

Rd f (t,x,ξ)ei(tτ+x·ξ) dx dt,
and similarly ˆg, ˆρψ. We use below the property that
ˆρψ(τ,k) =

Rd ψ(ξ) ˆf dξ.

Kinetic formulations of parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs: From theory to numerics
451
Equation (31) becomes very simple after Fourier transform and reads
i(τ + k · ξ) ˆf = ˆg,
(τ,k,ξ) ∈R2d+1.
This allows us to invert the symbol and in order to avoid the singular hyperplane
τ + ξ · k = 0, we add β ˆf on each side of the equality, with β a positive real number to
be chosen later. We obtain
ˆf (τ,k) =
ˆg + β ˆf
β + i(τ + ξ · k).

and thus Theorem 3.5 is proved. Notice simply that the Hilbert space H 1/2 is deﬁned by

We leave this lemma without proof.
Considering the kinetic formulation (28), we are in a situation to apply this result be-
cause
u(t,x) =

R
χ(ξ;u)dξ,
which is equivalent to a truncated integral in (32) because u is bounded and thus χ(ξ;u)
has compact support in ξ. Here, let us only mention that a difﬁculty arises from the only
M1 regularity of the kinetic defect measure m. Because averaging lemma do not win any
derivative in L1 this case is the worst and the L2 case provides much more regularity.
Additionally, Theorem 3.5 cannot be used directly because, in particular, of the ξ derivative
that appears in the right-hand side of (28). It can be handled by the following result:
THEOREM 3.8 [30]. Let ψ ∈C1(Rd), suppψ ⊂B(R) (ball of radius R centered at ori-
gin). Let f,g ∈L2(R1+2d) satisfy
∂
∂t f + ξ · ∇xf = ∂
∂ξ g.
(34)
Then, using notation (32), we have
∥ρψ∥˙H 1/4(Rd+1) ⩽C(d,ψ)∥f ∥1/4
L2(R2d+1)∥g∥3/4
L2(R2d+1).
(35)
As a consequence, the regularity of averages is not lost but just weaker in presence of a
singular right-hand side. Also, the gain of regularity is already of only weak 1/4 derivative
in L2 while we want to prove 1/3 in the real situation. To improve the regularity result in
case of the kinetic formulation, the idea consists in taking advantage of the ξ regularity of
the function χ (denoted by f in the above general averaging lemmas).

4. Kinetic formulation of isentropic gas dynamics
In this section we present an example of a system with a kinetic formulation. We consider
one-dimensional isentropic gas dynamics, a hyperbolic system which admits a full family
of entropies.
The system of isentropic gas dynamics consists in two equations that express physically
the conservation of mass and the conservation of momentum for a barotropic gas (this
refers to compressible gases where the pressure only depends on the density and thus the
temperature effects do not act directly on the dynamics). It reads
⎧
⎨
⎩
∂
∂t ρ + ∂
∂x (ρu) = 0,
t ⩾0, x ∈R,
∂
∂t (ρu) + ∂
∂x
ρu2 + p(ρ)	 = 0.
(39)
The density ρ should be nonnegative, u denotes the velocity of the gas and p is the pres-
sure. Here we consider the case of a polytropic gas, where the equation of state is simply
given by
p(ρ) = κργ ,
1 < γ < +∞,
(40)
and we normalize the constant κ as follows (for the simplicity of formulas below)
κ = θ2
γ ,
θ = γ −1
2
.
4.1. Entropy structure of isentropic gas dynamics
This system falls in the class of strictly hyperbolic systems but it degenerates at the vacuum
state (it looses hyperbolicity), ρ(t,x) = 0. Vacuum may arise even when the initial data

454
B. Perthame
satisﬁes ρ0 > 0 in a simple Riemann problem [13,56]. To deal with general global solutions
to the system of isentropic gas dynamics, we face the difﬁculty of dealing with the vacuum
state. This implies especially that the velocity u, for instance, is not deﬁned as ρ(t,x) = 0,
but more generally all quantities depending upon ρ and u that make sense should vanish at
the vacuum state.
Again the method is based on using a family of entropies. Let us recall that in general
2 × 2 systems admit two families of entropies. But the above mentioned degeneracy of
isentropic gas dynamics at vacuum makes that only a single family can be used. For non-
degenerate 2×2 systems it is possible to ﬁnd the kinetic structure and for instance the case
of elasticity is completely treated in [53].
A ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd the families of entropy inequalities. We call an entropy pair (or
also a pair: entropy/entropy ﬂux) and we denote it by (S(ρ,u), η(ρ,u)), functions of the
unknowns ρ and u such that the equality
∂
∂t Sρ(t,x),u(t,x)	 + ∂
∂x ηρ(t,x),u(t,x)	 = 0
holds for all smooth solutions (ρ,u). Simple algebraic manipulations show that such en-
tropies are characterized by the differential relations
⎧
⎨
⎩
Sρρ −p′(ρ)
ρ2 Suu = 0,
ηu = ρSρ + uSu.
The ﬁrst equation can be seen as a wave equation in the variables ρ ⩾0 which plays
the role of time and u ∈R which plays the role of one-dimensional space. The ﬁrst step
consists in concentrating on the initial value problem for this wave equation. Recalling that
all quantities we consider should vanish at vacuum state, we consider the so-called weak
entropies family deﬁned by
⎧
⎨
⎩
Sρρ −p′(ρ)
ρ2 Suu = 0,
S(ρ = 0,u) = 0
and
Sρ(ρ = 0,u) = g(u).

The solution operator to this problem can be analyzed completely and yields the following
lemma which relies on the power law assumed for p(ρ) (otherwise see [11]).
LEMMA 4.1. We set λ =
3−γ
2(γ −1).
(i) There is a fundamental solution, corresponding to g = δ the Dirac mass in (41),
given by the explicit formula with α(λ) a normalizing constant,
χ(ρ,u) =

(ii) Therefore the weak entropies in (41) are given by the formula
S(ρ,u) =

R
g(ξ)χ(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
(iii) The corresponding entropy ﬂux is given by
η(ρ,u) =

R
g(ξ)

θξ + (1 −θ)u

χ(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
(iv) The entropy S is strictly convex in the variables (ρ,ρu) if and only if g is a strictly
convex function.
As an example, we mention for future reference that the physical entropy is the energy
of the system given by
SE(ρ,u) = 1
2ρu2 +
κ
γ −1ργ .
(42)
It enters the family of weak entropies and can be recovered as
SE(ρ,u) =

R
ξ2
2 χ(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
Also density and momentum can be recovered as
ρ =

R
χ(ρ,u −ξ)dξ,
ρu =

R
ξχ(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
We refer to [46,49] for a proof of the above lemma.
As we have seen in the scalar case (see Section 2.2), for degenerate problems the van-
ishing viscosity method yields inequalities in the entropy relations which take into account
possible singularities as shock waves. Therefore we now complete the system (39) by the
full family of entropy inequalities for weak and convex in (ρ,ρu) entropies deduced from
Lemma 4.1

4.2. Kinetic formulation
We are now ready to state the kinetic formulation for the system of isentropic gas dynamics.
We call an entropy solution to the system (39), a couple (ρ(t,x), ρu(t,x)), such that the
inequality (43) holds for all convex entropy pairs given in the Lemma 4.1.

We claim that entropy solutions (ρ(t,x), ρu(t,x)) to isentropic gas dynamics are equiv-
alently described by the single and singular kinetic equation

and the right-hand side is nonpositive for all g convex (i.e., all convex weak entropy S by
Lemma 4.1(iv)) if and only if m is nonpositive (and is therefore a measure).
The bound on the measure can be obtained using g(ξ) = |ξ|2

thanks to the kinetic deﬁ-
nition of the energy after (42). Indeed, we remark that the above equality also gives

and it remains to integrate in time since SE ⩾0.
□
By opposition to the scalar case, (44) for the function χ(t,x,ξ) is not anymore a purely
kinetic equation because the advection velocity is now (θξ + (1 −θ)u) which contains
explicitly the macroscopic velocity u(t,x). Therefore linear operations are not allowed
here. This class of semikinetic equation is not as handy as purely kinetic equations although
they arise in many physical contexts.

4.3. Applications of the kinetic formulation
As a ﬁrst application, we mention the existence of a solution to the system of isentropic
gas dynamics including vacuum. It can be obtained by the vanishing viscosity method con-
sidering the viscous system of two equations on the density ρε(t,x) and on the momentum
qε(t,x) = ρεuε(t,x) given by the equations:
⎧
⎨
⎩
∂
∂t ρε + ∂
∂x (ρεuε) = ε ∂2
∂x2 ρε,
t ⩾0, x ∈R,
∂
∂t (ρεuε) + ∂
∂x

ρεu2
ε + p(ρε)
	
= ε ∂2
∂x2 (ρεuε).
(45)
Here the pressure p(ρ) is still assumed to be a polytropic law (40). Also, we assume that
the initial datum satisfy
ρ0
ε ,u0
ε are smooth, uniformly bounded and uniformly of ﬁnite energy,
ρ0
ε (x) ⩾ε exp

−|x|2	
.
(46)
Then, it is proved in [19,46,49], that the system (45) admits a smooth solution with a lower
bound on the density
ρε(t,x) ⩾ε exp−C(ε,t)|x|2	,
where the constant C(ε,t) can be computed explicitly (this is a delicate point; see [49] for
instance).
The convergence result as ε vanishes is stated in the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.2 [46,44]. Let 1 < γ < ∞and assume ρ0
ε ⩽C, |u0
ε| ⩽C. Then, the solutions
(ρε,uε) to the system (45) are uniformly bounded and we may extract a subsequence,
such that (ρε,ρεuε) converges almost everywhere and thus in Lp
loc((0,∞) × R) for all
1 ⩽p < +∞, to an entropy solution to (39).
The proof of the strong compactness for this subsequence uses the method of compen-
sated compactness [48,58,20] combined with its kinetic formulation.
As other applications, we can mention a priori bounds for the hyperbolic system (in L∞)
and more unusual regularizing effects in Lp
(t,x) spaces (see [49] for details). This last result
can be stated as follows. For all y ∈R, we have, for some constant which only depends
on γ ,
 ∞
0

ρ|u|3 + ργ +θ	
(t,y)dt ⩽Cγ

R

E(x)dx
(recall the deﬁnition of the energy SE in (42)). An open question is however to derive from
the kinetic formulation some regularizing effect on the solutions in Sobolev spaces as this
was done in the scalar case, see Section 3.1.

458
B. Perthame
We also mention that Bouchut and Berthelin [4] (see also the related works in the refer-
ences) handled the relaxation approximation to isentropic gas dynamics. It is not possible
to prove directly the convergence for the relaxation equation
∂
∂t f (t,x,ξ)
+ ∂
∂x
θξ + (1 −θ)uf (t,x,ξ) + 1
ε
f (t,x,ξ) −χ(ρ,u −ξ)
= 0,
as an approximation of (44). Indeed, the entropy structure is not fulﬁlled by this equation
because it is not true that χ(ρ,u−ξ) minimizes the 
R ξ2f (ξ)dξ subject to the constraints
that

R f (ξ)dξ = ρ and

R ξf (ξ)dξ = ρu. To achieve a relaxation approximation Bouchut
and Berthelin introduced a model with two kinetic variables and which provides a pure
kinetic relaxation approximation. They also prove, using all the entropies and compensated
compactness, that this model converges to the system of isentropic gas dynamics. Another
approximation is by time splitting, and the convergence proof is given by Vasseur [59,60].
5. Kinetic schemes of isentropic gas dynamics
In this section we wish to illustrate some numerical applications of the kinetic approach
to macroscopic conservation laws. Namely we show how ideas from kinetic theory allow
to derive ﬁnite volume schemes for macroscopic equations. For the sake of simplicity, we
restrict our presentation to isentropic gas dynamics. We ﬁrst present a formalism to repre-
sent the system of isentropic gas dynamics which is simpler than the kinetic formulation in
Section 4 (ﬁrst subsection). It is used to build ﬁnite volume solvers in a second subsection
and numerical results are presented in a third subsection.
5.1. Kinetic representation
We consider again the system of isentropic gas dynamics treated in previous section,
 ∂
∂t ρ + ∂
∂x (ρu) = 0,
t ⩾0, x ∈R,
∂
∂t (ρu) + ∂
∂x
ρu2 + p(ρ)	 = 0,
(47)
for a polytropic gas, i.e., when the pressure p is given by the barotropic and polytropic
equation of state. For our present purpose, we restrict ourselves to the values (cf. with (40))
p(ρ) = κργ ,
1 < γ ⩽3,
(48)
with κ > 0 a given constant. We now complete this system with a single entropy inequa-
lity for the total energy of the system (total energy = kinetic energy + potential energy).

(49)
∂
∂t E + ∂
∂x

(E + p)u

⩽0.
(50)
A kinetic representation of this system can be given. It only uses the single entropy
given by energy. This representation has the advantage to lead to a purely kinetic equation
(cf. with (44)), but the concept is much weaker than that of kinetic formulation, and es-
pecially the singular right-hand side carries little information. Also, this representation is
based on a minimization problem which only holds for γ ⩽3; this explains this limitation
on γ that does not appear in Section 4.
The kinetic representation is an equation equivalent to the original hyperbolic system
(47)–(48), and is based on the representation formula
⎛
⎜⎝
ρ

ρu2 + κργ
⎞
⎟⎠=

R
⎛
⎜⎝

ξ

⎟⎠M(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
(51)
It is fulﬁlled when the function M is given, for instance, as
M(ρ,ξ) = ρ1−θχ
 ξ

,
θ = γ −1
2
,
χ is an even nonnegative function, and

R
χ(w)dw = 1,

R
w2χ(w)dw = κ.
(52)
With these notations, one can readily check by ξ integrations against the weights 1 and ξ,
that the solutions to (47)–(48) are also the solutions to the kinetic equation
∂
∂t M(ρ,u −ξ) + ξ ∂
∂x M(ρ,u −ξ) = Q(t,x,ξ),
(53)
for some unknown “collision term” Q(t,x,ξ) (a distribution) which satisﬁes,

R
Qdξ = 0,

R
ξQdξ = 0.
(54)
Indeed, integrating (53) in ξ against the weights 1 and ξ, we obtain (47)–(48) just using
the property (54) for Q. Conversely, being given a solution (ρ,u) to (47)–(48), we obtain
an explicit right-hand side Q (which we do not compute here) and which satisﬁes (54).

460
B. Perthame
Again, by opposition to the kinetic formulations, the right-hand side Q does not vanish for
smooth solutions here, whatever is the choice of χ.
A possible motivation for this kinetic representation comes from a relaxation model.
Equation (53) can be considered as the limit as λ →∞(but it is an open problem to give
a rigorous proof) of the relaxation model
∂
∂t f (t,x,ξ) + ξ ∂

ρu(t,x) =


R
ξM(ρ,u −ξ)dξ.
From this we infer that Q(t,x,ξ) = limλ→∞λ[f (t,x,ξ) −M(ρ,u −ξ)].
Next, we indicate the relation to the entropy inequality (50). This is more involved and
is related to a Gibbs principle for the microscopic energy

ity relations with the γ -law isentropic gas dynamics system, (51), are fulﬁlled. The former
deﬁnition (49) of the macroscopic energy E is also satisﬁed.
A consequence of this microscopic representation of energy is an additional property
of the collision term Q in the kinetic equation (53). For this choice of ME, we have (in

and (56) follows by ξ integration since this equation reduces then to the entropy inequality
(50) thanks to the relations (deduced from Proposition 5.1 and easy calculations)

Of course, the multiplication of the distribution Q by ME(ρ,u −ξ)1/λ does not make
a real sense. It can be made rigorous by a convolution argument. We denote by ME,ε the
space and time regularization of ME(t,x,ξ) and we notice that the kinetic equation (53)
(by opposition to the hyperbolic system itself ) can be regularized. We obtain the equation
∂
∂t ME,ε(ρ,u −ξ) + ξ ∂
∂x ME,ε(ρ,u −ξ) = Qε(t,x,ξ),
which holds in a classical sense; the terms in the left-hand side are regular enough in
(t,x,ξ), therefore Qε is regular also. Hence, we can perform the nonlinear operation and
obtain

Since ME,ε →ME strongly, we may pass to the limit in the left-hand side and obtain

regularization kernel, we have

with the following deﬁnitions: we are given cells Ci = (xi+1/2,xi−1/2) of size hi =
xi+1/2 −xi−1/2 > 0 and we deﬁne σi = t
hi for some time step t which is chosen
small enough using a Courant–Friedrichs–Levy (CFL) condition (see Theorem 5.2). We
set h = mini∈Z hi. Also, the principle of ﬁnite volume methods is to use approximation

We refer to [29] for a general presentation of ﬁnite volume schemes in ﬂuid dynamics and
[24,38,42] for general mathematical and numerical introductions.
The difﬁculty in ﬁnite volume methods is to ﬁnd stable interpolation formulas called
solvers to compute the numerical ﬂuxes Aρ,n
i+1/2 and Aq,n
i+1/2 from the cell values ρn
i , ρn
i+1,
qn
i and qn
i+1. Especially the intuitive centered formulas are unstable and cannot be used in
practice (as for instance, Aρ,n
i+1/2 = 1
2[ρun
i + ρun
i+1]).
The idea to use kinetic theory in order to derive solvers for ﬂuid equations is very natural
and has been used by many authors, let us mention, for instance, [17,36,54,55,64], and
additional references in [49].
5.3. Kinetic solvers
A family of ﬁrst-order approximation solvers Aρ,n
i+1/2, Aq,n
i+1/2 in (60) can be derived from
the kinetic representation of the system of isentropic gas dynamics. Using the notations
(51)–(52), they correspond to an upwind scheme for the kinetic-transport equation (53)
where the collision terms Q is not kept (it is only used implicitly in order to provide from

Since the kinetic representation only provides a single entropy inequality, we are unable
to prove the convergence of these schemes. We recall that the only known argument for
proving convergence is based on using compensated compactness on the full family of
weak entropy inequalities (see [49]). The above theorem gives a weak stability criteria, in
the case of the choice ME, since it provides lγ bounds for ρn

This stability, based on a single entropy, seems enough to guarantee convergence of the

REMARK 5.3. The natural speeds of propagation u ±

κγργ −1 for system (57) are usu-
ally related to CFL conditions like (63). Here we notice that we always have wM ⩾κ,
with equality for χ(w) = 1
2[δ(w = √κ ) + δ(w = −√κ )]. This proves that some choices
of χ should not converge and the statement (i) is too weak. The choice of χE leads to a
compatible CFL condition, then we have indeed
wM =

2κγ
γ −1 ⩾√κγ.
PROOF OF THEOREM 5.2. We use the kinetic representation (61) of the method (60), (62),
that we write

From the assumption on the support of the function χ, all the terms in the right-
hand side vanish for |ξ| > supi∈Z[|un

condition, on the complementary interval, f n+1

(ξ) is a convex combination of Mn
i (ξ),
Mn
i−1(ξ) and Mn
i+1(ξ). Therefore, since M is nonnegative, we deduce that f n+1
i
is non-
negative too and thus, by ξ integration, we deduce that ρn+1
i
is nonnegativetoo. This proves
statement (i).
As for statement (ii), we use again the convex combination to deduce, since γ +1
3−γ > 1,
that

5.4. Numerical comparisons
In this section we compare the results given by two different choices of the function χ
in the construction of kinetic schemes for Saint-Venant system which consists in the case
γ = 2, κ = g
2 in previous section. The different tests we have performed show that the
various choices of χ lead to rather similar results as long as its support is ‘large enough’.
We have selected two functions to illustrate this.
Firstly, we have used Kaniel’s function [37] which speed of propagation is exactly the
correct eigenvalues of the hyperbolic system. The function χ is
χK(w) = 1
g |w|1{|w|⩽√g}.
(64)

467
A narrower support leads to an inconsistency with the limiting system.
Secondly, we have used the very simple, piecewise constant, function
χC(w) =
9
1
6g 1{|w|⩽√3g/2}.
(65)
Notice that the entropic choice χE in (55) has a larger support and is used in [51] for nonﬂat
bottoms (and the results are very close to those given by χC).
Both functions lead to very simple formulas and the codes are efﬁcient. We denote by
Fr = u/√gh the Froud number (no dimension), then the ﬂuxes are given by

For Kaniel’s choice the values are C = √g, D = g, and with

The numerical tests we present now have been performed with g = 2.
Figure 1 gives the computed Riemann decomposition for initial values u = 0, hleft = 2,
hright = 0.5 at time t = 0.18 with 100 grid points. We use a CFL number of 0.95. We draw
the height of water h (left) and the water velocity u (right). The continuous line represents
the exact solution and the crosses the computed solution. Here we have used the piecewise
constant equilibrium χC(w) in the ﬂuxes formulae. Kaniel’s choice leads to very close
results χK(w).
Figures 2 and 3 give the computed Riemann decomposition for initial values u = 0,
hleft = 2, hright = 0.000005. This right state is equivalent to vacuum and shows the ability

of the schemes to handle smoothly the case h = 0 at time t = 0.12 with 100 grid points.
We use again a CFL number of 0.95. In Figure 2 we have used χC(w). In Figure 3 we have
used χK(w).
Both schemes give a usual ﬁrst-order accurate result. The main difference is that the
results obtained with χK exhibit a slight jump at the sonic point for the particularly sharp
Riemann problem with vacuum.
6. Conclusion
The kinetic approach to macroscopic conservation laws relies ﬁrstly on the physical de-
scription of a gas at the kinetic level thanks to Boltzmann’s formalism. However, it goes
much beyond in two directions.
The ﬁrst direction is that of kinetic formulations, restricted to systems with many en-
tropies, which systematically provides a way to handle full families of entropies by single
equations. For scalar hyperbolic–parabolic equations it is a way to prove strong (and op-
timal) regularizing effects using the method of kinetic averaging lemmas which use the
Fourier transform (it may be applied here because the kinetic formulation is a linear equa-
tion on nonlinear quantities).
The second direction is that of kinetic representations, which only uses one entropy,
is much less demanding than the kinetic formulation. It allows to represent a hyperbolic
system by integrating the underlying kinetic equation and maybe uses, for instance, to
produce ﬁnite volumes solvers.

Abstract
We consider various scalar conservation laws with dissipation. The Cauchy problem gener-
ates a (nonlinear) semigroup that satisﬁes a maximum principle, a contraction property with
respect to the L1-distance, and preserves the total mass (hence the word “conservation law”).
A crucial role is played by traveling waves, also called shock proﬁles, that tend to distinct
constants as x · ν →±∞(ν ∈Sd−1 a direction of propagation). In particular, their stability is
a good criterion for the relevance of the underlying inviscid shock waves. The precise question
that we address in this article is their asymptotic stability with respect to the L1-distance. This
topology turns out to be the most natural one in the context of conservation laws because of
the properties mentioned above. A related question concerns steady solutions of the IBVP,
usually called “boundary layers”.
In one space dimension, the stability of shock proﬁles is, up to some extent, a matter of
dynamical systems theory. However, a complete picture needs the more analytical proof that
constants are also asymptotically stable, with respect to zero-mass initial disturbances. The
latter may or may not hold, depending on the strength of the dissipation involved by a given
model. For instance, it does not in the inviscid case. The multidimensional stability of shock
waves is signiﬁcantly more involved, and is still widely open.
Numerical approximation by conservative and monotone ﬁnite difference schemes pro-
vides another kind of dissipative process. We investigate the existence and stability of discrete
shock proﬁles. We ﬁll a gap in Jennings’ proof of existence and prove that tails are exponen-
tially small.
Throughout this text, we present nine Open Problems that have their own interest.

Notations
Spaces Lp(Rd) are deﬁned with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Their norms are de-
noted ∥· ∥p. The conjugate exponent of p ∈[1,∞] is given by
1
p′ = 1 −1
p.
Sometimes, it may be useful to remember the equality p′ = p/(p −1). Partial derivatives
with respect to t or xα are denoted ∂t and ∂α (∂x in one space dimension). The space of
C∞-functions with compact support in Ω is D(Ω). If E is a functional space, E+ denotes
the cone of nonnegative elements of E; for instance, D+(Ω) is the set of nonnegative
test functions. The space of functions with bounded variations is designated by BV; the
total variation of a function a is TV(a). The sign function is deﬁned on real numbers by
s →sgn(s) = s/|s| is s ̸= 0 and sgn(0) = 0. The positive part s+ of a real number s is
max(s,0). Its negative part is s−:= min(s,0).
Introduction
Scalar conservation laws with dissipation
We are interested in scalar conservation laws of the form
∂tu +
d

α=1
∂αf α(u) = Lu.
(1)
The unknown u(x,t) depends on time t > 0 and a space variable x = (x1,...,xd) ∈Rd.
In most of this chapter, we focus on the case of a single space variable (d = 1). The ﬂuxes
f α are given smooth (at least C2) functions. They represent the nonlinear convection of
some physical problem governed by (1). The linear operator L models the dissipation
process present in the physics. It is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a Markov semigroup
etL on L∞(Rd). The Markov property satisﬁed by any operator of the from T = etL is
summarized by the following list:
Comparison.
If a,b ∈L∞are such that a ⩽b almost everywhere, then T a ⩽T b holds
almost everywhere.
Contraction.
If a,b ∈L∞are such that b −a ∈L1, then T b −T a ∈L1 and
∥T b −T a∥1 ⩽∥b −a∥1.

Conservation.
If a,b ∈L∞are such that b −a ∈L1, then T b −T a ∈L1 and

Rd(T b −T a)dx =

Rd(b −a)dx.
In addition, since the ﬂux f does not explicitly depend on x and thus commutes with
translations, we shall ask that L (or T as well) share this property. In particular:
Constants.
If a is a constant, then T a ≡a.
The four properties described above, whose names (Comparison, Contraction, Conser-
vation, Constant) begin with “Co”, will be referred to as the Co-properties in the sequel.
Such linear semigroups have long been identiﬁed, see, for instance, [50]. Their generator
have the general form
Lu =

α,β
aαβ∂α∂βu +

α
bα∂αu + K ∗u −μu,
where the differential part is a weakly elliptic second-order operator with constant
coefﬁcients:
0d ⩽A = (aαβ)1⩽αβ⩽d,
and the second part is a convolution by a nonnegative integrable kernel K, while the last
term is a multiplication by the constant
μ :=

Rd K(y)dy.
The ﬁrst-order derivatives may be incorporated in the convective term, and thus will be
ignored: b = 0.
An important aspect of a Markov semigroup is its decay, or dispersion, property. For
instance, if L is the Laplacian , we have
eta

p ⩽cp
∥a∥1
td/2p′ .
This decay still holds when we add a convolution term to the Laplacian, but it cannot hold
in the lack of differential terms. As a matter of fact, u →Lu = K ∗u −μu is a bounded
operator on every Lp and thus generate a group of transformations that are automorphisms
within Lp. In particular, etLa belongs to Lp if and only if a does.
The reason that motivates us in considering the perturbation of the so-called inviscid
conservation law
∂tu +
d

α=1
∂αf α(u) =

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws

by such dissipation terms is two-fold. First of all, conservation laws in physics have the
general form ∂tu + divq = 0, where the relation between the ﬂux q and the state u may
be rather complex. In a coarse approximation (large scales), the ﬂux may be represented
by a nonlinear local term f (u), but at smaller scales, additional terms must be taken in
account. For instance, gas dynamics is described at large scales by the Euler equations,
while a reﬁned description needs the Navier–Stokes system. Secondly, the scalar inviscid
conservation law generates a semigroup (see [39]) which displays the four Co-properties
above. In some instances, these properties are inherent to the physics under consideration,
and should not be destroyed by the addition of the dissipative operator L. Considering
small amplitude data, we see that etL must ﬁll the four Co-properties, hence be a Markov
semigroup.
Other motivations have been given in the physics literature. For instance, the choice
(here d = 1)
K0(x) = 1
2e−|x|,
μ0 = 1
represents a coupling with an elliptic equation, since then K0 ∗u−u = ∂xq, where q is the
solution of −∂2
xq + q = ∂xu. Such terms have been considered in radiative gas dynamics;
see [33,34] and the references herein. Of course, the present context of a scalar equation is
not relevant for radiative gas dynamics, but it provides a simpliﬁed model, in the same spirit
than when the Burgers equation was proposed as a simpliﬁcation of full gas dynamics.
Rosenau [52] considered the kernel K0 in a regularized version of the Chapman–Enskog
expansion in hydrodynamics. The study of the Cauchy problem for (1) with Rosenau’s
operator began with [56].
A less simple, at a ﬁrst glance, modiﬁcation of (2) for which we still expect that the
four Co-properties hold in a suitable sense, is the relaxation model designed by Jin and
Xin [32]:
∂tu + ∂xv = 0,
(3)
∂tv + α2∂xu = f (u) −v.
(4)
The ﬁrst equation is the conservation law, where the ﬂux v is related to u through the evo-
lution equation (4). If we ignore the ∂xu term, the latter looks like an ODE v′ = f (u) −v,
which forces v to relax to the equilibrium value f (u); then at equilibrium, we recover (2).
Actually, for stability reasons, we may not afford to ignore the ∂xu term, where α must be
large enough. This model looks much different from scalar ones. For instance, it requires
two data, one for each unknown. That it shares a lot of properties of scalar equations, due
to a weak decoupling, was ﬁrst observed by Hanouzet and Natalini [27].
Given a nonlinear model as above, the proof that the Cauchy problem is well posed
in L∞is more or less well known, although it is never a triviality. We reproduce it in
Section 1, emphasizing that the proof of uniqueness depends heavily on which equation
we are dealing with. As a matter of fact, the well-posedness of the convolution model
in L∞(if d = 1) and in BV (if d ⩾2) are new, and that in L∞remains an open question
when d ⩾2.

We show in the course of the proofs that the semigroups deﬁned by these Cauchy prob-
lem satisfy the Co-properties. It has long been remarked that the L1-contraction allows to
extend them continuously to the larger space L1 + L∞, in a unique way. However, it is
hard to say whether this extension gives weak solutions of the models, since the nonlinear
term divf (u) might not be a distribution if f is super-linear.
Besides the PDEs mentioned above, we also consider the discretization of the inviscid
conservation law by ﬁnite difference schemes. They provide an other kind of dissipation
that, in academic cases like the Lax–Friedrichs and Godunov schemes, gives rise to the
Co-properties. The corresponding shock proﬁles are often named “discrete shock proﬁles”,
a rather inappropriate word since these proﬁles usually depend on the real variable.
The next step (Section 2) is the characterization of shock waves for each model. In
general, these are unique up to a space translation. Their existence is more or less trivial,
except in two cases. The question remains essentially open for the convolution model,
apart for the kernel K0 studied in [34,44]. The situation was uncomfortable for discrete
shock proﬁles: Their existence was claimed by Jennings [31], whose proof covered only
the so-called “rational case”. We ﬁx the state of the art in Section 6 by providing a proof
of the irrational case. Our argument may be viewed as a stability analysis of proﬁles with
respect to various data: The shock parameters as well as the scheme itself. Hence, it can be
used to extend Jennings’ result to schemes that are monotone but not in a strict sense, like
Godunov’s. In the strictly monotonous situation, with the additional assumption that the
shock is noncharacteristic, we also obtain an exponential decay of the tail of the proﬁle.
We begin the stability analysis of shock proﬁles in Section 3. When the values taken by
the initial data lie between the states u−and u+, the L1-stability is proved by arguments
taken form dynamical systems theory: compactness of trajectories, ω-limit set, Lasalle’s
invariance principle. Only when exploiting the latter have we to make a case-by-case study.
The general idea is due to Osher and Ralston [51].
The situation is more involved when the data takes values outside the shock interval. We
show that L1-stability may fail in the borderline inviscid case when the shock is character-
istic on at least one side. This result is optimal, since we also prove the stability whenever
the shock is noncharacteristic, that is Lax’ shock inequalities are strict.
For models with L ̸= 0, Freistühler and the author found that the L1-stability of shock
proﬁles is implied by that of constant states under zero-mass disturbance. The latter prop-
erty is analyzed in details in Section 4. In some sense, it is the most technical part since
we really have to work on a case-by-case basis. The stability is induced by the disper-
sion properties of the linear semigroup etL, which may be pretty strong (L = ) or weak
(convolution model, relaxation).
Section 5 is devoted to the multidimensional viscous case. Since the shift of a given
proﬁle does not belong to the same class modulo L1(Rd) as the proﬁle itself, the total mass
of the initial disturbance becomes a meaningful invariant of the problem. Its nonvanishing
causes a disturbance of the shock front that can be represented at the leading order by a
solution of the heat equation in Rd−1, which enhanced diffusion. A pretty good result has
been established by Hoff and Zumbrun [29], following a preliminary study by Goodman
and Miller [22]. Remaining at a qualitative level, we construct the approximate solution
to which the actual one is asymptotic. Of course, because of the lack of compactness, the

stability result is only known under additional restrictions such as smallness in weighted
spaces. Thus a lot of interesting questions remain open.
Our last Section 7 concerns the Initial-boundary value problem. The waves under con-
sideration are the so-called “boundary layers”. Their stability analysis follows more or less
the same guidelines than that of shock proﬁles. We give a new proof of the stability of
constant in the outgoing case, by using a simple comparison argument with respect to the
characteristic case. This idea actually works in several space dimensions, where the result
seems to be new.
1. The nonlinear semigroup
We are interested in the Cauchy problem for (1), where the initial datum a belongs to L∞.
We wish to construct a semigroup for (1), which enjoys the four Co-properties. The situa-
tion may differ a lot when we vary the choice of the operator L.
1.1. The viscous conservation law
We begin with the viscous equation:
∂tu + divf (u) = u.
(5)
The choice of the Laplace operator  is not restrictive at all, since every elliptic operator
of the form

α,β
aαβ∂α∂β
with constant coefﬁcients may be transformed into  via a suitable linear change of coor-
dinates. Also, such a transformation does not affect the Co-properties.
In (5), the ﬂux term divf (u) may be treated as a lower order perturbation of the
heat equation ∂tu = u. The latter generates a (linear) C0-semigroup (Ht)t⩾0 on Lp
(1 ⩽p ⩽∞), which satisﬁes the four Co-properties. This semigroup is nothing but the
convolution by the Heat kernel:
Hta = Kt ∗a,
Kt(x) :=
1
(2πt)d/2 exp

−∥x∥2
4t

.
This representation immediately gives dispersion estimates, such as
∥Hta∥p ⩽cp,qt
d
2 ( 1
p −1
q )∥a∥q,
p ⩾q,
(6)
and
∥∇xHta∥p ⩽c′
p,qt
d
2 ( 1
p −1
q )−1
2 ∥a∥q,
p ⩾q.

Notice that cp,p = 1. The semigroup of the heat equation is weakly contractive in every Lp.
The theory of the Cauchy problem for (5) is that of mild solutions. One rewrites it as an
integral equation, using the Duhamel’s principle for the heat equation,
u(t) = Kt ∗a −
 t

Kt−s ∗divf u(s)		ds

 t

∇xKt−s

.
Using the estimates (7), one easily ﬁnds that N is a contraction of the ball of radius 2∥a∥∞
in L∞(Rd × (0,T )), provided T = T (∥a∥∞) is small enough. Then Picard’s ﬁxed point
theorem tells that there is a unique local solution. Using again dispersion inequalities, one
ﬁnds that u is smoother and smoother; for instance, u is C∞for positive times if f is C∞.
Then the Maximum principle implies that ∥u(t)∥∞⩽∥a∥∞. Hence, the local existence
can be iterated: The solution exists on (0,2T (∥a∥∞)),.... At the end, we obtain a unique
bounded solution, which is global in time and smooth for positive times.
Since the solution is unique, the nonlinear map a →Vta := u(t) deﬁnes a semigroup
on L∞. Given two data a and b whose difference is integrable, denote v(t) := Vtb and
u(t) = Vta. For the sake of simplicity, we work at the level of solutions, although the rig-
orous analysis consists in doing the same estimate at the level of the approximate solutions
generated by Picard’s ﬁxed point argument. We have

which gives Y(t) ⩽2Y(0), whenever 4c′
1,1M√t < 1. Since M depends only on the L∞
norms, which remain bounded, this estimate may be iterated. We ﬁnd that v(t) −u(t) is
integrable for every positive t, with a rather poor bound
v(t) −u(t)

1 ⩽ceωt∥b −a∥1.
The ﬁrst consequence is the norm conservation. We may write

Rd

v(t) −u(t)
	
dx =

Rd(b −a)dx
because

Rd g ∗hdx =

Rd g dx ·

Rd hdx
for every integrable functions g and h, while

Rd Kt dx = 1,

Rd ∇xKt−s dx = 0.
To prove the contraction property, we work with C2 convex functions u →η(u) (the “en-
tropies”) and vector ﬁelds ψ (their “entropy ﬂuxes”) deﬁned up to a constant by ψ′ = η′f ′.
The smoothness of solutions allows us to writing
∂tη(u) + divψ(u) = η′(u)u = η(u) −η′′(u)|∇xu|2 ⩽η(u).
(9)
Given a real number k, the convex function
u →ηk(u) := |u −k|
is a so-called Kruzkhov entropy. Approaching uniformly ηk by C2 entropies, we observe
that the ﬂuxes converge to the ﬂux
ψk(u) := sgn(u −k)

f (u) −f (k)
	
.
Moreover, one may pass to the limit in (9), whence
∂tηk(u) + divψk(u) ⩽ηk(u),
(10)
in the distributional sense. Actually, using the symmetry ηk(u) = ηu(k), ψk(u) = ψu(k),
we may as well derive the following inequality for two solutions u and v as above:
∂t|v −u| + div

sgn(v −u)

f (v) −f (u)
		
⩽|v −u|.
(11)

482

Since every term is integrable on Rd, we receive the contraction property
v(t) −u(t)

We conclude that the semigroup Vt enjoys the four Co-properties.
Dispersion property.
A rather strange fact, noticed by Bénilan and Abourjaily [1] is
that (5) exhibits a dispersion property which is independent of the ﬂux f , even at a
quantitative level. For instance, let us consider the decay of the L2 norm of u(t) for in-
tegrable initial data. The standard energy estimate, and the fact that udivf (u) = divg(u)
for g′(s) = sf ′(s) yield
d
dt ∥u∥2
2 + 2∥∇xu∥2
2 = 0.
Using the Nash inequality
∥u∥2 ⩽cd∥u∥1−θ

θ = 1 + 2

and using the decay of t →∥u(t)∥1, we obtain

This differential inequality immediately gives

(12)
A generalization of this idea yields the following decay estimates, where again the con-
stants cpqd do not depend on the particular shape of the ﬂux:
∥Vta∥p ⩽cpqd td q−p
2pq ∥a∥q,
1 ⩽q ⩽p ⩽2q < +∞.
(13)
1.2. The inviscid conservation law
The inviscid conservation law
∂tu + divf (u) = 0,
(14)

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
483
faces the problems of shock formation and nonuniqueness of distributional solutions.
Shock formation is caused by the blow-up in the solution of the Ricatti equation along
characteristic

∂t + f ′(u)∂x
	
(∂xu) + f ′′(u)(∂xu)2 = 0.
This equation, supplemented by the fact that u is constant along characteristics dx/dt =
f ′(u), shows that most of C1-solutions blow up in ﬁnite time.
For this reason, we must consider distributional solutions, which are assumed bounded,
at least locally, in order that all the terms in the equation make sense. Typically, solutions
exhibit discontinuities across hypersurfaces. Piecewise smooth functions satisfy (14) in the
weak sense if and only if they are classical solutions away from their discontinuities, the
latter satisfying the Rankine–Hugoniot condition

f (u+) −f (u−)
	
· ν = s(u+ −u−).
(15)
Here, u± are the limits of u at x(t) from both sides of a discontinuity locus of Γ (t). The
unit normal to this hypersurface is oriented from the minus side towards the plus side, and
is denoted by ν. Last, s is the normal velocity of Γ (t): it is deﬁned by
sx(t)	 = νx(t)	dx
dt ,
x(t) ∈Γ (t).
One often writes [g(u)] for an expression g(u+) −g(u−). For instance, (15) reads

f (u)

· ν = s[u].
The Rankine–Hugoniot condition (15) does not depend on the orientation of Γ . In one
space dimension, we choose the natural orientation ν = +1, meaning that
u±(x,t) :=
lim
y→x±0u(y,t).
As it has been well known since the seminal work by Kruzkhov [39], weak solutions are
far from being unique, and one must select a solution through the entropy criterion. The
rigorous formulation of this criterion is that the solution u satisﬁes the integral inequalities

for every constant k ∈R and every nonnegative test function φ ∈D+(Rd × R). Of course,
if we are interested in local-in-time solutions, say on a time interval (0,T ), then the integral
inequalities should be considered for test functions with support in Rd × (−∞,T ) only.
The solutions satisfying (16) are called entropy solutions.

484
D. Serre
An important remark is that, whenever u is bounded, at least locally in space and time,
then (16) contains the fact that u solves (1) in the distributional sense (take k > ∥u∥∞, and
next k < −∥u∥∞). But of course, it tells much more. We shall only sketch the proof of the
following well-known result.
THEOREM 1 (Kruzkhov [39]). Let a ∈L∞(Rd) and T > 0 be given. Then there exists a
unique locally bounded function u in Rd × R, satisfying (16) and
u ∈C[0,∞);L1
loc
Rd		.
In addition, this solution is bounded and the map a →Sta := u(t) deﬁnes a nonlinear
semigroup which satisﬁes the four Co-properties mentioned in the Introduction.
COMMENTS.
1. The fact that the semigroup is L1-contractive had already been noticed by Volpert [73]
in the context of BV data. This fact motivated Kruzkhov in his study.
2. The L1-contractivity, when an equation exhibits a scaling invariance, is the source of
a BV regularization, as shown by Bénilan and Crandall [4]. For instance, the Burgers
equation ∂tu + ∂x(u2/2) = 0, in one space dimension, has the property that u(t)2 is
of bounded variation whenever the datum a is integrable, with
TV

u(t)2	
⩽2∥a∥1
t
.
3. Other selection criteria have been considered for (14) by LeFloch and co-workers
(see [37] and references herein). They may be relevant for speciﬁc problems, mostly
in systems rather than scalar equations. Signiﬁcant examples include nonstrictly hy-
perbolic systems and cases where elliptic regions are enclosed in domains of hy-
perbolicity. In the scalar case, such nonclassical solutions may not enjoy the four
Co-properties. Their uniqueness has not been proved yet. In particular, we still ig-
nore whether they deﬁne a semigroup in any sense. The most important feature for
us is that they are not expected to satisfy the L1-contraction; this is why we shall not
consider them in the sequel.
SKETCH OF PROOF OF THEOREM 1.
Existence.
We begin with integrable data a ∈L1(Rd) ∩L∞(Rd). Let uε be the unique
solution of the viscous model
∂tuε + divf

uε	
= εuε
with data uε(0) = a. Then ∥uε∥∞= ∥a∥∞. Let h be a vector and denote τh the space shift
by this vector: τhg = g(· + h). Since τhuε is the solution associated to the data τha, the
L1-contraction (see the previous subsection) gives the uniform estimate

Since a is integrable, it is known that
lim
∥h∥→0 ω(h) = 0.
Hence, the sequence uε is uniformly (in t and ε) integrable with respect to the space vari-

Using a molliﬁer ρθ(y) = ρ(y/θ), let us choose

Without loss of generality, we may assume1 f (0) = 0. Therefore we obtain, on the
one hand,

with Ω(α) the supremum of ω(y) in the ball ∥y∥< α. Finally, choosing for instance

This gives uniform equiintegrability with respect to space–time variables. Given the
L∞-bound, the sequence (uε)ε>0 is pre-compact in L1
loc. Thus there exists a subsequence,
with ε →0+, which converges boundedly almost everywhere. From (10) (with ε instead
of ) uε satisﬁes an integral inequality for every nonnegative test function φ. Passing to
the limit as ε →0 with the help of the Dominated convergence theorem, we obtain (16).

Therefore, an entropy solution does exist.

Uniqueness.
That part does not follow from the estimates above. It is needed in or-
der to have a well-deﬁned semigroup, and to prove the convergence of the whole se-
quence (uε)ε>0. It follows directly from Kruzkhov’s estimate: Let u and v be two entropy
solutions associated with bounded data a and b. Using the symmetry between u and k
in (16), a tedious and technical computation yields the inequality

for every z ∈Rd, t > 0 and R > 0. The number M is as above, the Lipschitz constant of f
over the interval containing ±∥a∥∞and ±∥b∥∞.
Besides giving uniqueness of an entropy solution, (18) allows us to deﬁne a unique
solution for every bounded data, not only integrable ones. For if a ∈L∞, then truncated
data χDa, with D = B(0;R) the centered ball of radius R, is integrable. Let uR be the
corresponding (unique) entropy solution. If S > R, then (18) tells that uR and uS coincide
on the cone deﬁned by ∥x∥+ Mt < R. Therefore the sequence (uR)R>1 converges as
R →∞, to a bounded function u ∈C([0,∞);L1
loc(Rd)) (because each uR belongs to
C([0,∞);L1(Rd))), obviously an entropy solution. By (18) again, this solution is unique.
We now check the Co-properties in the general case of bounded data. Constants are
obvious entropy solutions. Next, (18) together with Fatou’s lemma gives the contraction
property when b −a ∈L1(Rd). The comparison holds true for L1 data, because it does
at the viscous level and the viscous solution converges a.e. to the entropy solution. By the
procedure above, the comparison property extends immediately to every bounded data.
Last, given a and b with b −a ∈L1(Rd), we integrate the equation against a test function
φR(x) := φ(x/R), where φ has compact support and equals 1 on the unit ball. From

1.3. The relaxation model
We turn towards Cauchy problem for the system (3), (4). Now, the initial datum is a
pair (a,b), where u = a and v = b at initial time. The solution of the linear problem
∂tu + ∂xv = g,
∂tv + α2∂xu = h,
can be diagonalized as
D+w = g + 1
α h,
D−z = g −1
α h,
where w,z := u ± v/α and D± are the transport operators ∂t ± α∂x. This system admits a
unique solution in any reasonable sense, given by the explicit formulas
w(x,t) = w(x −αt,0) +

This allows to express (u,v) in a closed form, reminiscent to the Duhamel’s formula. Such
a formula may be used to state regularity results. For instance, in the homogeneous case
(g ≡h ≡0), the function a ± b/α is just propagated along lines of slope ±α.
When the right-hand side (g ≡0,h = f (u) −v) is given in terms of the unknown itself,
the Duhamel’s formula puts the system in the form of a ﬁxed point problem
w(x,t) =

The technique employed in Section 1.1 (Picard iteration for a contractive map) applies
here and yields a local existence theorem for bounded initial data. The existence time is
bounded by below by a time T0 depending only on ∥(a,b)∥∞.

D. Serre
In order to extend the solution for all times, we need an a priori estimate in the Sup-
norm. This one must be obtained through the maximum principle.2 Following [9], such a
maximum principle must hold simultaneously for the principal part
∂tu + ∂xv = 0,
∂tv + α2∂xu = 0,
and the ODE part
∂tu = 0,
∂tv = f (u) −v.
Let K be a domain in the plane that is positively invariant for both subsystems. The PDE
part imposes (see [9]) that K is a rectangle Iw × Iz = [wmin,wmax] × [zmin,zmax] in the
characteristic coordinates (w,z). In the latter, the ODE part becomes
∂tw = G(w,z),
∂tz = −G(w,z).
Hence, the invariance of K amounts to the inequalities
G(wmax,z) ⩽0,
G(wmin,z) ⩾0,
z ∈Iz,
(21)
and
G(w,zmin) ⩽0,
G(w,zmax) ⩾0,
w ∈Iz.
(22)
In particular, G must vanish at upper-left and lower-right corners, meaning that the vertices
(umin,vmin) and (umax,vmax) belong to the equilibrium curve
Γ :=

u,f (u)
	
;u ∈R

.
Whenever (21) and (22) hold and the initial datum (a,b) takes its values in the domain K,
the local solution remains in K and is therefore bounded. Since its life time was bounded
by below by a constant T0 depending only on the Sup-norm of (a,b), the solution may be
extended for every time t > 0; the solution is global in time.
When dealing with the relaxation model, which is not exactly what we think immediately
about when we speak of scalar conservation laws, we need to interpret the Co-properties
in terms of solutions with data in a box K as above only. Moreover, the order relation
in (L∞)2 and the L1 structure have to be understood in the following sense, introduced by
Hanouzet and Natalini [27]:
Comparison.
We say that a pair (a,b) of bounded functions is smaller than an other
one (A,B) if w(a,b) ⩽w(A,B) and z(a,b) ⩽z(A,B) almost everywhere. Let us write
(a,b) ≺(A,B). In that case, the comparison property for the relaxation model is
(a,b),(A,B):R →K and (a,b) ≺(A,B)
-⇒
(u,v) ≺(U,V ),
(23)
2We are not aware of such estimates, obtained by other means.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
489
where (u,v) and (U,V ) are the corresponding solutions.
In terms of w and z, which satisfy transport equations coupled by nonlinear source
terms, this amounts to saying that, within the box K, G is nondecreasing with respect to z,
while nonincreasing with respect to w. This exactly require the so-called subcharacteristic
condition, which limits by below the choice of the parameter α:
α ⩾supf ′(u)
;u ∈[umin,umax].
(24)
Because borderline cases often rise major difﬁculties or pathologies, we usually assume the
strict subcharacteristic condition, where the inequality is strict. Then the equilibrium curve
can be written, within K, as the graph {z = θ(w)} of a smooth function such that θ′ > 0.
That relation can be rewritten in the similar form {w = θ−1(z)}. Since G increases along
horizontal lines (in variables (w,z)) and decreases along vertical ones, we obtain that G is
positive on the lower-left side of Γ and is negative on the upper-right side. Hence, the in-
equalities (21) and (22) may be viewed as consequences of the subcharacteristic condition.
Contraction.
The integral form of the nonhomogeneous linear problem show immedi-
ately that if a, b, g and h are integrable, then u(t) and z(t) are so, with
d

Applying these differential equations to the difference of two solutions (w,z) and (W,Z)
of the relaxation model, we obtain

dx.
For the integrand to be nonzero, it is necessary that either w ⩽W and Z ⩽z, or W ⩽w
and z ⩽Z. In the ﬁrst case (the second is treated in the same way), the monotonicities of G
in the box K provide G(W,Z) ⩽G(W,z) ⩽G(w,z). Hence, the integrand is nonpositive
and we may conclude to the speciﬁc contraction property:

∂xv = 0, yielding the conservation property

Notice the important fact that the conserved integral is a Lipschitz map with unit Lipschitz
constant with respect to the distance considered in the Contraction property.
Constants.
The only constants preserved by the relaxation model are the equilibrium
constants (a,b), that is those belonging to Γ .
Well-posedness.
As mentioned above, an initial datum taking values in a rectangle K
yields a global-in-time solution that remains in K. The fact that the solution is unique in
the class L∞
loc(R+;L∞) comes from the L1-contraction property. The only point that is
not obvious is the following fact: given two bounded solutions (w,z) and (W,Z) of the
Cauchy problem, such that W(0)−w(0) and Z(0)−z(0) are integrable, then W(t)−w(t)
and Z(t) −z(t) remain integrable forever. To do so, we remark that
 X

and therefore by

Passing to the limit as X goes to inﬁnity, we obtain the desired result. In particular, we
justify the contraction property.
To prove the conservation property, we play the same game, knowing from above that
W(t) −w(t) and Z(t) −z(t) remain integrable. The difference

equals the sum of the integrals of ±(G(W,Z) −G(w,z)) on the triangles T± of vertices
(±X,T ) with slopes ±α. Since W(T ) −w(t) and Z(T ) −z(t) are space integrable, we
know that the integrals along the horizontal sections of T± tend to zero as X →+∞.
Besides, this section integrals are uniformly bounded. Applying the Dominated conver-
gence theorem, we infer that the integrals over T± tend to zero. Hence the conservation.

COMMENT. When the equilibrium model is a system of n ⩾2 equations, most of the
features of the scalar case drop out. For instance, the comparison and the contraction prop-
erties do not hold anymore. A maximum principle persists in a few speciﬁc case, mostly
when n = 2. It was studied in details in [9] at the level of systems of viscous conservation
laws. When it holds true, it extends, in a nontrivial way, to the Jin–Xin relaxation of the
system [63], and allows to extend the solution of the Cauchy problem to all positive times.
A thorough account of the theory of general relaxation models is contained in [49].
1.4. The Rosenau model
We ﬁnish this section by the study of the Cauchy problem for the generalized Rosenau
model
∂tu + divf (u) = K ∗u −u,
(28)
where the nonnegative kernel K has been normalized so that

Rd K(y)dy = 1,
(29)
giving formally the mass conservation3 for L1-solutions.
Loss of smoothness.
In this rather complex model, the diffusion term K ∗u −u does
not prevent from shock formation in ﬁnite time, for general data, though it does for small
and smooth data. We refer to [33,34,41,44,56] for a general study of the Cauchy problem,
including shock formation and existence of shock proﬁles. To explain what is going on,
we ﬁrst remark that L := K ∗−1 = (K −δ)∗is a bounded operator on every Lebesgue or
Sobolev space. Therefore, it generates a uniformly continuous (semi)group etL. In some
sense, the diffusion is a lower order term, which cannot inﬂuence the qualitative feature of
the principal part ∂tu + divf (u).
Let us give a convincing example of blow-up, by choosing d = 1 and the Burgers’ ﬂux
f (u) = u2/2. Let u be a smooth solution of
∂tu + u∂xu = K ∗u −u.
Writing v for ∂xu, and differentiating, we obtain
Dtv + v2 + v = K ∗v,
where Dt := ∂t + u∂x is the convective derivative. If a = u(0) is integrable, then
u(t) remains so, as we shall see in a moment, and therefore m(t) := infx v(x,t) ⩽0 ⩽
3We shall see later on that the vanishing of the ﬁrst moments must be imposed when dealing with L∞-solutions.

492
D. Serre
supx v(x,t) =: S(t). We easily obtain the following differential inequalities for
both m and S:
m′ + m2 + m ⩽S,
S′ + S2 ⩽0.
Let M be the solution of the Ricatti equation M′ + M2 = 0 with data S(0). We have
0 ⩽S ⩽M ⩽S(0). Therefore,
m′ + m2 + m ⩽M
and
(m −M)′ + (m −M)2 + (2M + 1)(m −M) ⩽0.
Since m −M ⩽m −S ⩽0, we deduce
(m −M)′ + (m −M)2 +

2S(0) + 1
	
(m −M) ⩽0,
where (m −M)(0) = m(0) −S(0). It is well known that if this initial data is less than
the smallest root −2S(0) −1 of the polynomial X2 + (2S(0) + 1)X, then m −M must
blow-up, towards −∞, in ﬁnite time. Hence, if
inf
x ∂xa + sup
x
∂xa < −1,
the space derivative of u blows-up in ﬁnite time.
Global smooth solutions.
On the contrary, smallness of smooth initial data ensures the
existence of a global and smooth solution, as we show now. The above analysis showed
that the supremum of ∂xu remains bounded above, by 1/t for instance. Anticipating on the
maximum principle, we have ∥u∥∞⩽∥a∥∞. Besides, the estimate
∥K ∗∂xu∥∞=
(∂xK) ∗u

∞⩽∥∂xK∥1∥u∥∞
yields a uniform bound
∥K ∗v∥∞⩽∥∂xK∥1∥a∥∞,
provided that ∂xK is integrable. There follows
m′ + m2 + m ⩾−∥∂xK∥1∥a∥∞.
Let us make the smallness assumptions that
∥∂xK∥1∥a∥∞< 1
4,
inf
x ∂xa > m−,

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
493
where m−is the smallest root of equation
X2 + X + ∥∂xK∥1∥a∥∞= 0.
Then the differential inequality ensures that
inf
x,t ∂xu ⩾m−.
Hence, the space derivative of u remains bounded. Equation (28) shows that the time deriv-
ative is bounded as well. At last, one can prove, as in the diffusionless case, that the bound-
edness of the ﬁrst derivatives allows to propagate the smoothness of the initial datum.
Construction of the semigroup.
Because of the possibility of shock formation, a semi-
group cannot be deﬁned within spaces like H 1(Rd), C1(Rd). Reasonable spaces are those
already considered in the diffusionless case: Lp-spaces or BV(Rd). Because we are inter-
ested in the Co-properties, we shall work within L1, L∞and their sum L1 + L∞. A spe-
cial interest is given to piecewise smooth solutions, since they encode some of the most
signiﬁcant features. In particular, discontinuities of the solutions obey exactly the same
Rankine–Hugoniot condition as those of (2).
Because of the lack of smoothing effect of the Rosenau diffusion, it seems possible
to construct solutions which behave locally in the same way as piecewise smooth so-
lutions of (2). In particular, (28) must admit unphysical solutions whose discontinuities,
though satisfying the Rankine–Hugoniot condition, are not admissible with respect to (2).
Therefore, we restrict the notion of solution in exactly the same way as in the diffusionless
case. We say that a locally bounded measurable function u(x,t) is an admissible (or an
entropy) solution of the Cauchy problem for (28) if it satisﬁes the integral inequalities

for every constant k ∈R and every nonnegative test function φ ∈D+(Rd × R). Again,
choosing large positive or negative values of k, we obtain that admissible solutions do
satisfy (28) in the distributional sense.
Uniqueness.
The uniqueness of an entropy solution of the Rosenau model is proved in a
way similar to that followed in Section 1.2, but with extra arguments. One derives from (30)

If v(t) −u(t) is known to be integrable in space for every t (a fact that is certainly
true for solutions given by the viscosity method when a and b are integrable), the choice

We are now reduced to proving the integrability of v(t)−u(t), when b −a is integrable.
It has not yet been addressed, up to our knowledge. Several authors content themselves
with the construction of a semigroup, extending by continuity the L1-semigroup, thanks to
its contraction property.
A ﬁrst important case is that of integrable data, because the vanishing viscosity method
(see below) gives integrable solutions. Therefore, we obtain the uniqueness for integrable
data, but only within the restricted class of entropy solutions that are integrable in space.
This is a bit weaker than expected.
When the space dimension equals one, the situation is nevertheless favorable. Since
K has unit mass, we may introduce a function H(x) with the properties that H(±∞) = 0
and
dH
dx = K −δ.
4We warn the reader that an inequality such as (18) does not hold, because the model experiences an inﬁnite
speed of propagation, like the viscous model, due to the convolution term.

Then K ∗w −w = H ′ ∗w. We shall assume that H ∈L1(R), which amounts to saying
that K has a ﬁnite ﬁrst moment. Following Kruzkhov’s paper for conservation laws with
source terms, we have the inequality

.
Since the right-hand side does not depend on R, we deduce that v(t) −u(t) is integrable.
This argument does not extend to several space dimensions because the bound grows
in general like Rd−1. However, if we assume that a and b have ﬁnite total variation, then
there is a way to get home. We ﬁrst remark that the solutions provided by the viscosity
method have ﬁnite total variation, with
TV

u(t)
	
⩽TV(a).
We shall be considering only entropy solutions that have ﬁnite total variation. We introduce
a vector ﬁeld H, vanishing at inﬁnity and satisfying as above
divH = K −δ.
In practice, it is enough to choose H = ∇θ, where θ = K −δ. Then we write as above
K ∗|v −u| −|v −u| = H ˙∗∇|v −u|. Then we have

Since H(x) = θ′(r)x/r, we immediately see that H is integrable if, and only if (1 + |x|)K
is integrable.
A fundamental example is that of the kernel deﬁned by 
K(ξ) = (1 + |ξ|2)−1. In other
words, K ∗u = z, where z is the solution of the elliptic equation −z + z = u. Then
K decays exponentially at inﬁnity, and thus H is integrable.
Existence.
We use the vanishing viscosity method. We begin by constructing the unique
solution uε of the Cauchy problem for the perturbed equation
∂tu + divf (u) = K ∗u −u + εu,
(32)
where ε > 0 is a small number. A local solution is obtained by a ﬁxed point argument ap-
plied to an integral form of the Cauchy problem, written through the Duhamel’s principle
for the heat equation (see Section 1.1). This only requires a ∈L∞. The dispersion proper-
ties of the heat semigroup imply that uε is C∞whenever t > 0. Thus one may apply the
maximum principle, giving the comparison property for (32). In particular,

This uniform estimate allows us to extend uε to all positive times.

We summarize our analysis in the following statement.
THEOREM 2. Let K be a nonnegative, integrable kernel, with unit mass. The Cauchy
problem for the Rosenau model (28) is well posed in the following spaces:
• in L1(Rd) ∩L∞(Rd), in every space dimension;
• in (L1 + BV) ∩L∞(Rd) if H is integrable. For instance, a radial K satisfying
K ∈L1((1 + |x|)dx) works;
• in L∞(Rd) if d = 1 and K ∈L1((1 + |x|)dx).
In the sequel, we denote by (Rt)⩾0 the semigroup generated by the Rosenau model.
General data
• When the data is bounded but does not belong to L1 + BV, the above procedure
does not work. Also, the procedure employed in the diffusionless case is inefﬁcient

because of the lack of ﬁnite propagation velocity. One way to construct an entropy
solution for general L∞data would be to use DiPerna’s theory of measure valued
solutions (see [14]), together with the improvement by Szepessy [69] to pass to the
limit in the viscosity method. We leave this question open, with the remark that the
uniqueness is already an unsolved problem.

then using the uniqueness of the limit in one of the well-posed contexts described in

A dispersion inequality.
The last comment, and the example provided by the viscous
model (see Section 1.1) lead us to explore dispersion properties of the semigroup (Rt)t>0.
For that purpose, we assume that a ∈L1 ∩L∞. Hence, a ∈L2 and we have seen that
u(t) decays in L2. We actually have a little bit more, that is,

Since K is nonnegative and has unit mass, we have m(ξ) > 0 for ξ ̸= 0. In addition, we
know that m tends to 1 at inﬁnity. Last, if K belongs to L1((1 + |x|2)dx), then m is twice

Also, the bound of ∥u(t)∥2 involves both ∥a∥1 and ∥a∥2, though it involved only ∥a∥1 in
the viscous case.
2. Shocks
In the most general acception of this word, a planar shock is a bounded traveling wave of
the form
u(x,t) = U(x · ν −st),
having ﬁnite limits on each sides:
U(−∞) =: u−,
U(+∞) =: u+.
The number s is the normal velocity of the shock while ν ∈Sd−1 is its direction of propa-
gation. A standing shock corresponds to s = 0. It is always possible to restrict to standing
shocks by using a moving frame, that is by changing variables as (x,t) →(x + stν,t),
yielding
(∂t,∇x) →(∂t −sν · ∇x,∇x).
We shall see later on that every shock must satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot relations (15).
Therefore, the corresponding function
uinv(x,t) :=
u−,
x · ν < st,
u+,
x · ν > st
is a discontinuous solution of the inviscid model. We call it an inviscid discontinuity and
denote it shortly (u−,u+;sν).

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
501
The shock proﬁle U obeys to a functional equation. When the latter is an ordinary differ-
ential equation and is resolved in terms of the highest derivative of U, the proﬁle is smooth
and provides an internal structure of the inviscid discontinuity.
A common feature of shock proﬁles for scalar equations satisfying the Co-properties is
the monotony. This monotony must be read at the level of the Riemann invariants w and z
in the relaxation model. The monotony of the proﬁle is intimately related to the underlying
dissipation structure. In general, the dissipation property is due to the particular way the
model approaches the inviscid equation; for instance, it is present in the viscosity ∂2
xu, or in
the Rosenau operator K ∗u−u. However, in the inviscid case, the dissipation cannot come
from an “external term”, and thus must be present in the shock itself, through the Lax shock
inequality. This is why we shall meet counterexamplesto the monotony in the inviscid case.
As we shall see in the next section, such “bad” shocks may have poor stability properties.
2.1. Inviscid shocks
We begin with a characterization of the traveling waves in the inviscid case. Denot-
ing f (v;ν) := ν · f (v) and g(v) := f (v;ν) −sv, the proﬁle is a standing wave of the
one-dimensional conservation law
∂tU + ∂xg(U) = 0.
In particular, g ◦U is constant (say g ◦U ≡¯g) and, since U must satisfy the Kruzkhov
entropy inequalities,
x →

¯g −g(k)
	
sgn

U(x) −k
	
is nonincreasing for every real number k. For instance, if a (respectively b) is an essential
value of u at some point x (respectively y), and if b ̸= a, we obtain an Oleinik-type infor-
mation: If (b −a)(y −x) > 0 (respectively < 0), then g ⩾¯g (respectively g ⩽¯g) between
a and b.
Assume now that U takes three distinct essential values a,b,c in this order. If b is not
in the interval between a and c, say b > max(a,c), then g ⩾¯g on (a,b) while g ⩽¯g on
(c,b), hence g ≡¯g on (max(a,c),b). Therefore, making the generic assumption that g is
not constant on any nontrivial interval, we see that U must be monotonous:
PROPOSITION 1. Assume that f (·;ν) is not afﬁne on any nontrivial interval. Then the
proﬁles of planar shock waves are (not strictly) monotonous. In particular, if u−= u+,
then U is constant.
Assuming without loss of generality that u−⩽u+, the graph of f (·;ν) lies above the
chord between u−and u+.
REMARKS.
• The generic assumption on the ﬂux f is reminiscent to various approaches in the study
of scalar conservation laws. In one space dimension, it ensures the strong conver-
gence in the viscosity method, thanks to a compensated-compactness argument (see

502
D. Serre
Tartar [71,72]). Given in a quantitative form, it yields regularity properties through
the well-known kinetic formulation (see Lions et al. [43]).
• As a matter of fact, the inviscid model is reversible at the level of smooth solutions,
since the change of variables (x,t) →(−x,−t) preserves the equation. However, it
is crucial to observe that this model becomes irreversible at the level of discontinuous
solutions. If a discontinuity (u−,u+;sν) and the reverse one (u+,u−;sν) are admis-
sible, then the Oleinik criterion tells that f (·;ν) is afﬁne along the interval between
u−and u+.
• More generally, if f (·;ν) is afﬁne along some interval J, then any measurable func-
tion U valued in J yields a traveling wave. In this rather trivial situation, nothing deep
can be said.
• On the contrary, if f (·;ν) is convex between u−and u+, then the discontinuity
(u−,u+;sν) is a shock if and only if it satisﬁes both u+ ⩽u−and the Rankine–
Hugoniot relation.
In generic situations, the monotonicity of U and the constancy of g ◦U imply that
U is piecewise constant with ﬁnitely many discontinuities. Each discontinuity in U is a
shock by itself, and we could consider only those which take two values only, thus named
u−and u+. Even with this restriction, we may encounter, as soon as f (·;ν) has inﬂex-
ion points, degenerate situations where the graph of f (·;ν) meets the chord somewhere
(say at c) between a and b. In such a situation, the shock must be understood as two
shocks of equal velocities s glued together, the ﬁrst one linking a to c, the second one link-
ing c to b. Finally, the only situation where U cannot be decomposed in more elementary
blocks is when U takes only the values u−and u+ and the graph of f (·;ν) does not meet
the chord. When u+ ̸= u−(to avoid triviallity), this is what we shall call a strict shock in
the sequel. Hence we have
U(x) =
u−,
x < x0,
u+,
x > x0,
with the following cases, symmetric to each other:
• either u−< u+ and the graph of f (·;ν) in the interval (u−,u+) lies strictly above
the chord,
• or u−> u+ and the graph of f (·;ν) in the interval (u−,u+) lies strictly below
the chord.
The Oleinik criterion implies immediately the Lax shock inequalities:
fu(u+;ν) ⩽s ⩽fu(u−;ν).
(45)
When these inequalities are strict, one speaks of a noncharacteristic shock, or a Lax shock.
Otherwise, it is characteristic. Many people use the term “shock wave” in the case of
noncharacteristic shocks only. But in the sequel, we shall not need to distinguish the char-
acteristic case from the noncharacteristic one.

2.2. Viscous shocks
The viscous case is extremely simple. With the notations of the previous paragraph, the
proﬁle must satisfy the nonlinear ODE
U′′ = (g ◦U)′
in the distributional sense. Integrating once, we obtain
U′ = g ◦U −cst.
By induction, U is a smooth function, say of class Ck+1 if f is Ck. Since U has limits u±
at ±∞, we deduce that the constant of integration equals both of g(u±), hence
g(u+) = g(u−).
This is nothing but the Rankine–Hugoniot relation (15).
Since g −g(u−) has a constant sign between two consecutive zeroes, and since u± are
zeroes of this function, we see that an inviscid planar discontinuity admits a viscous proﬁle
if, and only if, u−and u+ are consecutive zeroes, and if the sign of g −g(u−) equals that
of u+ −u−in the corresponding interval. This is the Oleinik inequality for is a strict shock.
In conclusion, we have the following:
PROPOSITION 2. An inviscid discontinuity admits a viscous proﬁle if and only if it is a
strict shock.
When it exists, a viscous proﬁle is monotonous and is unique up to a shift. Its behav-
ior at inﬁnity depends of the nature of the shock. For a noncharacteristic shock, the pro-
ﬁle U tends exponentially fast to its limits u±. But if it is characteristic, for instance at
right (fu(u+;ν) = s), then the decay of U −u+ is at best algebraic; it is of order 1/x if
fuu(u+;ν) ̸= 0.
In other words, one may say that, up to the decomposition of a discontinuity in elemen-
tary ones, the admissibility condition for a shock can be interpreted as the requirement that
it be realized as the limit of traveling wave solutions in the viscous approximation
∂tu + divf (u) = εu,
As a matter of fact, a shock proﬁle U yields the following solution
uε(x,t) = U
x · ν −st
ε

which is a good approximation of the inviscid shock. It is clear that uε tends pointwise
to u±, according to the sign of x · ν −st.

504
D. Serre
2.3. Relaxation shocks
In the case of a relaxation model, say the Jin–Xin model, the proﬁle consists in a
pair (U,V ), while the space dimension is one. The differential equation that it satisﬁes is
V ′ = sU′,
α2U′ = sV ′ + f (U) −V.
Eliminating V , we obtain the same equation than in the viscous case, up to a scaling,

α2 −s2	
U′′ =

f (U) −sU
	′.
(46)
Notice the importance of the subcharacteristic condition (24), which must be fulﬁlled on
the whole interval [u−,u+] (or [u+,u−] if needed). From the Rankine–Hugoniot condi-
tion, s = f ′(¯u) for some ¯u between u−and u+. When (24) fails on some interval I, there
exist shocks with u± ∈I, for which α2 < s2. Such shocks do not admit relaxation proﬁles,
while the nonadmissible discontinuities (u+,u−;s) do! Notice also the degenerate case
α2 = s2, where both admissible and nonadmissible discontinuities may coexist; to avoid it,
we shall reinforce the subcharacteristic condition into
α > sup
f ′(u)
;u ∈[u−,u+]

.
(47)
Under condition (47), an inviscid planar discontinuity admits a relaxation proﬁle if, and
only if, it is a strict shock. Moreover, V is given by the formula
V = sU + f (u−) −su−= sU + f (u+) −su+.
Again, the relaxation proﬁle is unique up to a shift. Moreover, the Riemann invariants are
monotonous since
U ± 1
α V =

1 ± s
α

U + cst,
and U itself is monotonous.
2.4. Radiative shocks
We shall call radiative proﬁle the proﬁle U of a discontinuity (u−,u+;s) for the gen-
eralized Rosenau model, because the exact Rosenau model, whose kernel K is given by

K(ξ) = 1/(1 + |ξ|2), may serve as a baby model for radiative gases.
There is no general theory for the existence of radiative proﬁles. Up to our knowledge,
the literature consists in the papers [56] by Schochet and Tadmor, and [34] by Kawashima
and Nishibata. In both papers, the kernel is Rosenau’s one and the existence is studied
through the differential equation
f (U)′ −sU′ = Q′,
Q′′ −Q + U′ = 0.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws

In the ﬁrst paper, the ﬂux g is any convex function but the amplitude [u] of the shock is
limited by some threshold. In the second paper, the ﬂux is the simplest one u2/2, but the
amplitude is arbitrary. It is proven that whenever the Rankine–Hugoniot relation and the
Oleinik condition u+ < u−hold, there exists a unique (up to a shift) radiative proﬁle.
The proﬁle cannot be of class C∞; it is of class Ck where k = k(|[u]|) is a decreasing
function. As a matter of fact, the proﬁle is discontinuous as [u] is large enough. This is the
origin of the restriction of the shock strength in [56], since Schochet and Tadmor did not
consider discontinuous proﬁles. The lack of regularity is due to the lack of invertibility of
the map u →f (u) −su between u−and u+.
It must be emphasized that discontinuous proﬁles are perfectly relevant for this model,
whose well-posedness holds in spaces of discontinuous functions (see Section 1.4.) Such
proﬁles have at most one discontinuity, which turns out to satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot
relation and the Oleinik condition. Hence, the discontinuity of a radiative proﬁle is itself
an inviscid shock! This phenomenon reminds us the case of shock proﬁles in full gas dy-
namics, in presence of heat conduction but without viscosity; in this situation, Gilbarg [20]
showed that strong shocks admit discontinuous proﬁles, where the discontinuity is an ad-
missible shock of the isothermal gas dynamics.
Consistency of Rosenau approximation.
The natural way to approach an inviscid scalar
conservation law by a Rosenau model is to take a diffusion operator Lε with
Lεu := 1
ε (Kε ∗u −u),
Kε(x) := 1
εd K
x
ε

.
With this choice, a radiative proﬁle furnishes a sequence
uε(x,t) := U
x · ν −st
ε

of the radiative model
∂tuε + divf

uε	
= Lεuε.
As in the viscous and relaxation cases, such a sequence converges pointwise to the inviscid
shock (u−,u+;sν).
At a formal level, which may be justiﬁed rigorously, the operator Lε is given by the
Fourier multiplier
1
ε
 
K(εξ) −1	.
Since 
K(0) = 1, this multiplier tends to the linear function ξ · ∇ξ 
K(0). Hence, Lε tends to
the drift
L0 = m · ∇x,
m :=

Rd K(x)x dx.

506
D. Serre
Therefore, consistency of the Rosenau approximation requires the vanishing of the ﬁrst
moments of K (recall that we have assumed the existence of ﬁrst moments):

Rd K(x)xα dx = 0,
α = 1,...,d.
(48)
For instance, every even kernel K satisﬁes (48).
Naturally, we encounter condition (48) when searching for radiative proﬁles, as a com-
patibility with the Rankine–Hugoniot relation. For if there exists a radiative proﬁle, then
it satisﬁes
(g ◦U)′ = Kν ∗U −U = (Hν ∗U)′,
where Kν and Hν are one-dimensional kernels obtained from K and H ·ν, after integration
along the hyperplanes normal to ν. We thus obtain
g ◦U = Hν ∗U + cst,
or in other words g(u+) −g(u−) = [Hν ∗U]. Since the convolution term Hν ∗U tends to
(m · ν)u± as y →±∞, we deduce
g(u+) −g(u−) = (m · ν)(u+ −u−).
(49)
Hence, a necessary condition for the existence of a radiative proﬁle for every inviscid shock
is that the ﬁrst moments of K vanish.
Assuming (48), the Rankine–Hugoniot relation becomes a necessary condition for the
existence of a radiative proﬁle, thanks to (49). Similarly, applying the entropy inequali-
ties (30) to a radiative proﬁle, we obtain

g(U) −g(k)
	
sgn(U −k)
	′ ⩽sgn(U −k)Kν ∗(U −k) −|U −k|
⩽Kν ∗|U −k| −|U −k|
= Hν ∗|U −k|	′
for every k ∈R. Integrating, we get
g(u) −g(k)	 sgn(u −k) ⩽Hν ∗|U −k|.
Since Hν ∗|U −k| vanishes at inﬁnity, the right-hand side equals zero. Hence, the Oleinik
condition appears as a necessary condition for the existence of a radiative proﬁle.
OPEN PROBLEM 1. Assume that the kernel K satisﬁes (29) and (48). Prove that every
strict inviscid shock (u−,u+;sν) admits a radiative proﬁle.
We give here a partial result, generalizing that was observed in the viscous and relaxation
approximations.

−H ∗|τhU −U|
is nonincreasing. Since it vanishes at inﬁnity, it must therefore vanish identically. Hence,
the above inequalities are equalities. In particular,
sgn(τhU −U)K ∗(τhU −U) = K ∗|τhU −U|,
which implies that τhU −U has a constant sign. Since its integral equals h[u], we deduce
that h−1(τhU −U) has the sign of [u]. Letting h going to zero, we obtain the monotony.
The same argument can be used for uniqueness. Replacing τhU by any proﬁle V in the
computation above, we see that V −U has a constant sign. Thus V −τhU has a constant
sign for every h ∈R. The uniqueness follows immediately.

3. Shock stability (I)
We now raise the main question of this paper, namely that of L1-stability of the shock
proﬁles. Let U(x · ν −st) be a traveling wave of a scalar diffusive models, as consid-
ered above. Given an initial datum a, being an integrable perturbation of U(·ν), that is,7
a ∈U + L1(Rd), we already know that
t →
Sta −U(·ν −st)

is nonincreasing. This strongly suggests the following stability property, which was
ﬁrst considered by Osher and Ralston [51] in the context of one-dimensional viscous
shock fronts:
lim
t→+∞
Sta −U(·ν −st)

1 = 0?
(50)
7This assumption must interpreted in terms of the model under consideration. For instance, in the Rosenau
model with d ⩾2, TV(a) should also be ﬁnite.

D. Serre
We shall give a complete answer to this question in the one-dimensional case, the multi-
dimensional problem being essentially open.
Warning.
In the sequel, we try to remain at a general level as long as possible, without
distinguishing the model under consideration. It must be understood that in the Shi–Jin
relaxation model, whose unknown is a pair (u,v), the L1-norm is deﬁned in terms of the
Riemann invariants (w,z), since the corresponding distance is that which is contracted
along the evolution. Similarly, a relaxation proﬁle is a pair (U,V ), and when we speak
of “the mass” of the initial disturbance (a −U,b −V ), we mean the integral of a −U,
since that is the conserved quantity along the evolution. At last, the comparison principle,
denoted above by ≺, does not concern (u,v), but (w,z).
Other stability results.
Our goal is not to treat stability in other functional spaces, like
Hilbert ones (L2 or other Sobolev spaces), with or without weights. As mentioned in the
Introduction, we are motivated by the important physical signiﬁcance of the L1-norm and
the fact that it is the norm for which the semigroup of the equation is nonexpansive. On an
abstract level, Bruck and Baillon have long been studying nonexpansive semigroups and
mappings in Banach spaces (see [2,3] for instance), establishing numerous deep theorems.
But their results more or less assume that the norm has some kind of uniform convexity,
a fact that is not true at all in L1. On a more explicit side, one would not underestimate
the voluminous literature where shock stability is obtained in Hilbert spaces through en-
ergy estimates and/or spectral analysis. One may date its beginning with the famous paper
by Sattinger [55]. This method always assumes some kind of smallness of the initial dis-
turbance, some decay rate of the data as x →±∞, and often a special structure of the
nonlinear ﬂux f . This ﬂaw is a cheap price to pay for much more precise results, includ-
ing accurate decay rates as time go to inﬁnity. Also, the method has enough versatility to
be applied in multidimensional situations, for which our approach remains inefﬁcient (see
Section 5 for a convincing example). Let us mention that signiﬁcant difﬁculties arise when
one considers systems of conservation laws instead of a scalar equation. Some of them may
be observed at the level of the linearized operator L around the shock proﬁle U. Even in the
simplest case considered by Sattinger (strict Lax shock, exponentially decaying data), it is
not any more possible to shift the essential spectrum of L strictly to the left of the imaginary
axis. As a by-product, the null eigenvalue λ = 0 associated to the equation LdU/dx = 0
remains embedded in the continuous spectrum, meaning that the translational invariance
cannot be decoupled from the dynamics. This fact reﬂects at the level of the mass trans-
port: the excess mass

R(a −U)dx cannot be absorbed any more by a shift of the proﬁle.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to take in account diffusion waves associated to the char-
acteristics that emerge from the shock. Liu [45] gave a neat description of the expected
asymptotics, which was rigorously proved under less and less restrictive assumptions by
himself, Goodman and Xin [23] and Szepessy and Xin [70]. A reﬁned analysis was per-
formed by Kreiss and Kreiss [38] when the excess mass is null, and by Fries [18,19] in the
general case, as long as the shock is small. A rather new fact in the case of systems is that
a proﬁle of large amplitude may be dynamically unstable. The fact that all scalar shock are
stable can be viewed as a consequence of the Krein–Rutman theorem, applied to the eigen-
value λ = 0 of L, noticing that the eigenfunction U′ has a constant sign. Two mechanisms

may be responsible for a dynamical instability. First of all, the instability of the underlying
inviscid shock is an obstacle to the stability of any reasonable kind of proﬁle (see Zumbrun
and Serre [74]). But, even when the inviscid shock is stable, a viscosity induces a kind of
Reynolds number, as noticed by Grenier and Guès [24] and Serre ([62], Chapter 15.2), and
a large Re could cause a spectral instability. A ﬁrst such example in a conservative setting
is given in [64], while more realistic ones were built in Serre and Zumbrun [68]. In the sta-
bility analysis of large amplitude shock wave, one thus must assume the spectral stability.
The strategy that has been developed by Howard and Zumbrun [30] and followed by many
authors including Rousset [53] is to convert the spectral into linear stability (that is esti-
mates for the semigroup exp(tL)) and then into nonlinear stability. This is an outstandingly
difﬁcult program.
At last, let us mention a recent development that uses Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities
and relative entropy, which applies in the L1 context to the viscous Burgers’ equation. With
such techniques, Francesco and Markovitch prove a trend to self-similar diffusion waves.

and a necessary condition for (50) to hold is that the mass of the initial disturbance vanish:

dx = 0.
We shall write this restriction in the form
a ∈U(·ν) + L1


Rd

(51)
where L1
0(Rd) denotes the set of integrable functions whose integral over Rd vanishes.

510
D. Serre
In a single space dimension, (51) is not a signiﬁcant restriction, because of the following
fact. Since U is monotonous, it has ﬁnite total variation. Hence, τhU −U is integrable and

R
(τhU −U)dx =
lim
A→+∞
 A
−A
(τhU −U)dx

U dx
gives

R
(τhU −U)dx = h(u+ −u−).
(52)
Therefore, our initial datum a is an integrable perturbation of τhU, and the mass of the
corresponding perturbation is

Rd

a −U(·ν)
	
dx −h(u+ −u−).
Thus it is always possible to choose h in such a way that a ∈τhU + L1
0. Speciﬁcally, we
must take
h = 1
[u]

R
(a −U)dx.
For this reason, given an initial datum a ∈U + L1, it is always possible to replace U by
some τhU, in such a way that a ∈U + L1
0. Hence, the one-dimensional problem reduces
to the following:
QUESTION. Let d = 1 and a ∈U +L1
0 be given. Prove (or disprove) the convergence (50).
This problem is solved in this paper. Again, asking the question assumes that the Cauchy
problem is well posed and that the semigroup satisﬁes the Co-properties. For instance, in
the relaxation model (3), (4), we also assume that the initial data takes values in a charac-
teristic box where the subcharacteristic condition (24) is fulﬁlled.
On the contrary, whenever d ⩾2, the difference τhU −U is not integrable (obvious) for
nonzero vectors h. Hence, a ∈U + L1 is not compatible with a ∈τhU + L1. Hence it is
not possible, starting from a general integrable perturbation of U, to restrict to a zero-mass
disturbance. Either the initial disturbance had zero-mass, or it had not. In the latter case,
the answer to the question is deﬁnitively no. Let us mention however the very interesting
results by Goodman and Miller [22] and Hoff and Zumbrun [29] about the viscous shocks
under small perturbations of nonzero mass. These will be describe in Section 5.
OPEN PROBLEM 2. Let d ⩾2 and a ∈U + L1
0 be given. Prove (or disprove) the conver-
gence (50).

Density arguments.
The contraction property offers for free a few useful inequalities.
Deﬁne ﬁrst the L1-distance d(u,v) := ∥v −u∥1 between two functions deﬁned on Rd.
Also, given a traveling wave U(·ν −st) and a data a ∈U(·ν) + L1
0, deﬁne the limit
ℓ0(a) := lim
t→+∞d

Sta,U(·ν −st)
	
.
Since Sτa −U(·ν −sτ) is integrable with a zero total mass, ℓ0(Sτa) makes sense, and we
have on the one hand
ℓ0(Sτa) = ℓ0(a).
(53)
On the other hand, the contraction property and the triangle inequality show that ℓ0 is
Lipschitzian on the afﬁne space U(·ν) + L1
0, with unit constant:
ℓ0(b) −ℓ0(a)
 ⩽∥b −a∥1.
(54)
The ﬁrst applications of (54) concerns the attraction basin of the traveling wave, that is the
set A0(U) of data such that (50) holds.
LEMMA 1. The attraction basin A0(U) of a traveling wave U is closed under the L1-dis-
tance d. Furthermore, for every a ∈U(·ν) + L1
0, we have
ℓ0(a) ⩽d

a;A0(U)
	
.
(55)
In a single space dimension, we may compare a data a ∈U + L1 to the shifted pro-
ﬁles τhU. The distance d(Sta;Υ (U)), to the set Υ (U) of these proﬁles, is nonincreasing
and we call ℓ(a) its limit. The function ℓenjoys the same properties (53) and (54) as ℓ0.
Similarly, we deﬁne the attraction basin A(U) of the set Υ (U). Because Sta may be as-
ymptotic only to the wave whose initial proﬁle τhU is such that a ∈τhU + L1
0, we see that
A(U) is exactly the union of the sets A0(τhU) as h ∈R.
LEMMA 2. Assume d = 1, and let a ∈U + L1
0 be an initial datum, where U is a shock
proﬁle. Then
ℓ0(a) ⩽2d

a;A(U)
	
.
(56)

0 for
h = 1
[u]

R
(b −U)dx = 1
[u]

R
(b −a)dx.
Hence, we have, on the one hand,
h[u]
 ⩽d(a,b).
(57)

512
D. Serre
On the other hand, d(Stb,U(· −h −st)) tends to zero. Using the triangle inequality,
we have
d

Sta,U(· −st)
	
⩽d(Sta,Stb) + d

Stb,U(· −h −st)
	
+ d

U(· −h −st),U(· −st)
	
.
The ﬁrst term in the right-hand side is bounded by d(a,b) (contraction) and the last
one equals


R

U(x −h −st) −U(x −st)

 =
h[u]
.
Using (57) and passing to the limit, we deduce
ℓ0(a) ⩽2d(a,b).
There remains to take the inﬁmum over A(U).
□
3.2. The dynamical system approach
From now on, we restrict to the one-dimensional case. In a ﬁrst instance, we focus on initial
data that lie between two shifts of the proﬁle U. Following Osher and Ralston [51], this
case can be treated by means of tools from dynamical systems theory: ω-limit sets and
Lasalle’s invariance principle. Theorem 3 and Corollary 1 are due to Osher and Ralston
in the viscous case, under the unnecessary assumption that the underlying inviscid shock
satisﬁed the strict Lax inequalities.
Thus let U be a shock proﬁle and let a be an initial datum such that there exist two real
numbers j,k with
τjU ⩽a ⩽τkU.
(58)
Since τkU −τjU is integrable, (58) ensures that a ∈U + L1. Without loss of general-
ity, we may assume that a ∈U + L1
0. Up to the choice of a moving frame, we also may
assume that U is a standing wave, that is a steady solution. In the relaxation case, such a
choice changes slightly the system itself, but what is important is that it does not affect the
Co-properties.
The comparison principle ensures that Sta still satisﬁes (58) for every positive time.
In other words, Sta −U remains pointwise between the integrable functions τjU −U and
τkU −U. Hence, there exists an integrable function F such that
Sta(x) −U(x)
 ⩽F(x)
∀t ∈R.
(59)
Besides, the semigroup commutes with the space shifts. Hence, τhSta = Stτha is another
solution, with initial datum τha, and the contraction principle gives
∥τhSta −Sta∥1 ⩽∥τha −a∥1 =: δa(h).

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
513
Since a −U is integrable, the upper bound δa(h) tends to zero with h. In other words, the
family of integrable functions (Sta −U)t⩾0 is equiintegrable. Together with (59) that con-
stitutes the hypotheses of the Fréchet–Kolmogorov (see Brézis [5]) compactness theorem:
This family is relatively compact in L1(R). In other words, the solution trajectory (Sta)t⩾0
is relatively compact in U + L1(R), equipped with the distance d.
The asymptotic behavior of the solution, with respect to d, is thus entirely encoded in
the ω-limit set, deﬁned as
Ω(a) :=

T ⩾0
{Sta;t > T }.
In other words, Ωa is the set of the strong limits of subsequences (Stma)tm→+∞. Important
properties of the ω-limit set are the following:
• Ωa is a nonvoid compact subset of U + L1.
• Ωa is invariant under the semigroup, forward and backward, meaning that
StΩa = Ωa.
• Ωa is a connected set.
• The elements b of Ωa satisfy
τjU ⩽b ⩽τkU.
(60)
Proving (50) amounts to showing that
Ωa = {U}.
To do that, we apply the Lasalle’s invariance principle (see [40]), which we recall now.
Let J :U + L1 →R be a continuous Liapunov function for our semigroup. Then J takes
a constant value cJ on Ωa. Since Ωa consists in trajectories, these must be rather special
ones, for which the Liapunov functions are just constant. In general, there is no way to com-
pute cJ , and the only information that this principle gives is the constancy. For instance, if
there is some differentiability (but this will not be the case for us), that is, if
d
dt J[Sta] = −R[Sta]
for some dissipation rate R, then every element b of Ωa must satisfy8 R[b] = 0. The
only situation where cJ is explicit is when J is a conserved quantity, in which case we
have cJ = J[a].
In our context, we have precisely one conservation law, namely the total mass of u −U.
Since

R(a −U)dx = 0, we deduce

R
(b −U)dx = 0
∀b ∈Ωa.
(61)
8We warn the reader that this property is a bit weaker than the constancy of J in general. See a striking example
in [66].

514
D. Serre
Besides, there is a one-parameter family of Liapunov functions, given by the contraction
principle and the fact that each τhU is a steady solution:
Jh[u] := ∥u −τhU∥1.
Therefore we may state the following intermediate result.
LEMMA 3. Let U be a proﬁle for a steady shock, and a ∈U +L1
0 be given. Then, for every
h ∈R and every b ∈Ωa, the function of time
t →∥Stb −τhU∥1
is constant.
We have reached a point where we have to treat each model separately, by exploiting
Lemma 3. We shall skip technical details and retain only the main ideas. Though they
differ from model to model, we always get the following conclusion.
LEMMA 4. There holds
Ωa ⊂Υ (U).
Then (61) tells that
Ωa ⊂Υ (U) ∩U + L1
0
	 = {U}.
Since Ωa is nonvoid, we obtain that Ωa = {U}, which implies (50), hence the conclusion:
THEOREM 3. Let d = 1 and U(x −st) be a traveling wave (a shock for the diffusion
model). In the inviscid case, assume that U is a strict shock. Let a be an initial da-
tum satisfying
τjU ⩽a ⩽τkU
for some j,k ∈R. Then a ∈A(U). More precisely,

Sta,U(· −h −st)
	
→0
as t →+∞, where h is given by
h =
1
u+ −u−

R
(a −U)dx.
Using Lemma 1, we have a straightforward extension of Theorem 3.

COROLLARY 1. Let d = 1 and U(x −st) be a traveling wave (a shock for the diffusion
model ). In the inviscid case, assume that U is a strict shock. Let a ∈U + L1 be an initial
datum satisfying
u+ ⩽a(x) ⩽u−,
a.e. x ∈R.
Then a ∈A(U). More precisely,

3.3. Sketch of proof of Lemma 4
Without loss of generality, we may assume9 that u−> u+. Thus the Oleinik condition for
a strict shock tells that f (y) < f (u±) for every y ∈(u+,u−). Given an element b of Ωa,
denote v(t) = Stb.

516
D. Serre
whenever t1 < t2. Hence,
f (u+) + f (u−) −2f ◦v(h,t) ⩽0
(62)
almost everywhere. However, since v takes values in [u+,u−], and since f ⩽f (u±)
on this interval, the traces are less than or equal to f (u±). Hence, (62) implies that
f ◦v ≡f (u±), and therefore ∂tv = 0. Thus v ≡b is a steady solution, in the class U +L1
0.
The general study of steady shocks, made in Section 2.1, shows that b = U.
Viscous case.
Recall that Ωa is backward invariant under the evolution, and that the semi-
group has a smoothing property. We infer that Ωa is made of smooth functions only. For in-
stance, if f ∈C∞, then b ∈C∞. Even with a limited amount of regularity, we always may
write that the decay rate of Jh[v] vanishes. At initial time, that means

R
sgn(b −τhU)∂2
x(b −τhU)dx = 0.
(63)
It is a bit technical, though not too much, to prove that (63) amounts to the following
property (see the details in [61,65]): Every vanishing point of b −τhU is a vanishing point
of its derivative (b−τhU)′. Varying the value of h, that means exactly that, for every points
x,y ∈R,
b(x) = U(y)
-⇒
b′(x) = U′(y).
(64)
Since U :R →(u+,u−) is monotonous, it is a diffeomorphism. Since b lies between
τjU and τkU, it takes values in (u+,u−). Thus it can be written as b = U ◦φ for some
smooth function φ. Applying (64) to the pair (x,y = φ(x)), we obtain on the one hand
b′ = U′ ◦φ. On the other hand, simple differentiation would have given b′ = φ′U′ ◦φ.
Since U′ does not vanish, we deduce from both equalities that φ′ ≡1, that is, φ(x) = x −h
for some h, or b = τhU.
At last, the fact that b ∈L1
0 gives h = 0. This ends the proof of Lemma 4 in this case.
Shi–Jin relaxation.
Theorem 3 was proved, in this case, by Mascia and Natalini [48].
The initial datum, being a pair of functions, is denoted by (a,b). Our assumption is that
a −U and b −V are integrable, and that the total mass of a −U is zero.
Denote by W,Z the Riemann invariants of the shock front (U,V ), and by (w,z) those
of a solution (u,v) under consideration. The Liapunov function Jh is deﬁned by
Jh[u,v] := ∥w −τhW∥1 + ∥z −τhZ∥1.
Its rate of decay is
Rh[u,v] =

R
G(w,z) −G(τhW,τhZ)	sgn(z −τhZ) −sgn(w −τhW)	dx.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
517
This integral involves only the domain where
(z −τhZ)(w −τhW) ⩽0,
|z −τhZ| · |w −τhW| ̸= 0.
(65)
From the strict subcharacteristic condition (47), G is strictly increasing with respect to z
and decreasing with respect to w. Therefore, (65) implies that G(w,z) −G(τhW,τhZ) be
positive. Hence Rh[u,v] ⩾0 (the contraction property), and the equality holds if, and only
if z −τhZ and w −τhW have strictly the same sign (both positive, both negative, or both
zero), almost everywhere.
If (c,d) belongs to Ωa,b, we must have Rh[c,d] = 0. Therefore, for every h, w −τhW
and z −τhZ have strictly the same sign. Moving h, this implies that, given two points
x,y ∈R, the following equivalence holds:
w(x) = W(y)
⇐⇒
z(x) = Z(y).
(66)
Since, as in the viscous case, W :R →(w−,w+) and Z :R →(z−,z+) are diffeomor-
phisms, while w,z take values in (w−,w+) and (z−,z+) respectively, there exist functions
φ and ψ such that
w = W ◦φ,
z = Z ◦ψ.
However, property (66) tells us that ψ ≡φ, hence
(w,z) = (W,Z) ◦φ,
x ∈R.
We now consider11 the solution (u,v) of the relaxation model, whose initial data
is (c,d). We still denote by (w,z) its Riemann invariants. Since (u(t),v(t)) ∈Ωa,b at
each time, there exists a function φ(x,t) such that
(w,z) = (W,Z) ◦φ,
(x,t) ∈R2.
Let us write that (w,z) is a solution of the coupled transport equations:12
δ+w = G(w,z),
δ−z = −G(w,z).
Using the fact that (W,Z) is a steady solution, namely
G(W,Z) = α+W ′ = α−Z′,
there comes

δ+φ −α+
	
W ′ ◦φ = 0,

δ−φ + α−
	
Z′ ◦φ = 0.
11The following argument is distinct from that employed by Mascia and Natalini. It is somehow simpler, as it
does not need to establish some regularity result for the elements of Ωa.
12The differential operators δ± = ∂t ± α±∂x differ from D± because of the moving frame, but we still have
α± > 0.

518
D. Serre
Since W ′ and Z′ do not vanish, we infer that
∂tφ ± α±(∂xφ −1) = 0,
or equivalently
∂tφ = 0,
∂xφ = 1,
since α± > 0. Thus there exists a real number h such that φ ≡x −h. This proves that
(c,d) = τh(U,V ). At last, the property that c −U has zero total mass implies h = 0. This
ends the proof of the lemma.
Radiative model.
The rate of decay of Jh is
Rh[u] =

R

|u −τhU| −sgn(u −τhU)K ∗(u −τhU)
	
dx.
Since (sgn v)K ∗v ⩽K ∗|v| with equality if, and only if, v has a constant sign, Rh[u] is
nonnegative(the contraction property) and vanishes only when u−τhU has a constant sign.
Hence, every b in Ωa is such that b −τhU has a constant sign for every h ∈R. As above,
this implies that b equals one of the shifted proﬁles. At last, the fact that Ωa ⊂U +L1
0 tells
us that this proﬁle is U itself. Whence the Lemma.
3.4. Data with values beyond [u+,u−]; inviscid case
Corollary 1 does not cover the case of general data a ∈U + L1
0, taking some values out-
side the interval [u+,u−]. There does not seem possible to reach the same conclusion by
the use of dynamical systems tools only. As a matter of fact, we shall give an example,
with an inviscid equation, that the L1-stability does not hold. Such a phenomenon is actu-
ally due to the lack of diffusion, and will not occur in other models. We shall then show
that the inviscid stability does hold when the shock is noncharacteristic. At last, we shall
describe a general strategy, based on the diffusion properties of the linear operator L, to
show the L1-stability in other models; we shall explain why this method does not work in
the inviscid case.
In the sequel, it will be useful to denote by A(U) the set of initial data to which Corol-
lary 1 applies. It consists in the functions a ∈U + L1, taking values in the interval13
[u+,u−].
Lack of stability for inviscid characteristic shocks.
Let U = (u−,u+;0) be a steady in-
viscid strict shock with, say, u+ < u−. Assume that it is characteristic at left, that is,
f ′(u−) = 0.
13Exercise: Write down the correct deﬁnition of A(U,V ) in the case of Shi–Jin relaxation.

Fig. 1. A shock that is characteristic at left.
Fig. 2. The shock is characteristic at left. The disturbance travels to the left with unchanged mass.
The Oleinik criterion implies that
f ′′(u−) ⩽0
and, generically, the inequality is strict. Thus, assume
f ′′(u−) < 0.
(67)
Then there is some nontrivial interval (u−,u−+δ) on which f ′ is negative. These assump-
tions are displayed in Figure 1.
Choose an initial datum a in the following way: It coincides with U, except on some
compact interval I ⊂(−∞,0), on which U ≡u−and a takes values in (u−,u−+ δ).
We may see a as the superposition U + b −u−of two distinct data, namely U, and a
data b : R →[u−,u−+ δ], which equals u−outside of J. We claim that the solution Sta
equals the superposition of StU = U and Stb, that is, Sta = U + Stb −u−(see Fig-
ure 2). For, by the maximum principle, u−⩽Stb ⩽u−+ δ. Hence, because of f ′ < 0

520
D. Serre
on (u−,u−+ δ), the support of Stb −u−moves to the left, implying that Stb ≡U at
the right of I. Therefore U + Stb −u−coincides with Stb on (−∞,0) and with U on
some (−ε,+∞), and thus is an entropy solution. Since its initial value is U + b −u−= a,
uniqueness gives the claim.
Let us compute the distance from Sta to τhU, where h is the value given by mass con-
servation:
h =
1
u+ −u−

R

b(x) −u−
	
dx.
It is known (Dafermos [10]) that, because of (67), Stb evolves as an N-wave as time
tends to inﬁnity: The mass of Stb −u−is obviously conserved, while its sup-norm
decays as t−1/2 and its support spreads. In particular, since h is a constant,
d(Sta,τhU) =

−∞
(Stb −τhU)dx ∼

(Stb −u−)dx

Therefore,
ℓ(a) =

and the stability does not hold if b is not trivial.
L1-stability of noncharacteristic inviscid shocks.
Since the situation would be similar, if
the shock was characteristic at right, we know assume that the shock is noncharacteristic:
f ′(u+) < s = 0 < f ′(u−).

Given an initial datum a ∈U + L1, we let

The assumption ensures that there is a δ > 0 such that f ′ > 0 on [u−,u−+δ] and f ′ < 0
on [u+ −δ,u+]. Assuming that ρ < δ, we therefore see that the support of w(t) −u−

D. Serre
Therefore, assuming that ρ is less than (u−−u+)/4, we conclude to stability:
LEMMA 5. Assume that the shock (u−,u+;s = 0) is noncharacteristic. There exists a
δ1 > 0 such that, for every initial data a ∈U + L1
0, satisfying
a(x) ∈[u+ −δ1,u−+ δ1],
a.e. x ∈R,
(71)
there holds ℓ0(a) = 0.
One only has to take δ1 < min(δ,(u−−u+)/4).
We now get rid of the hypothesis (71). Given a ∈U + L1
0, we let R be the smallest
integer such that a takes values in the interval [u+ −R,u−+ R]. If R ⩽δ1, Lemma 5
gives the positive answer. Otherwise, deﬁne p := π ◦a, where π :R →[u+ −δ1,u−+ δ1]
is the projection. From contraction, we have ℓ(a) ⩽ℓ(p)+∥a −p∥1. In view of Lemma 5,
we obtain, on the one hand,
ℓ(a) ⩽∥a −p∥1.
(72)
On the other hand, p and a differ only on a set B, where p equals either u−+δ1 or u+ −δ1.
This implies that
∥a −p∥1 ⩽minda;A(U)	 −δ1|B|,(R −δ1)|B|	.
(73)
We conclude from (73) that
∥a −p∥1 ⩽

Again, we may apply this inequality to u(t) instead. By virtue of (72) and (53), we obtain

Since δ1 < R, this ensures ℓ(a) = 0, that is, ℓ0(a) = 0 since the mass of a −U is zero.
We have thus proved:

3.5. Data with values beyond [u+,u−]; general case
The inviscid case studied above is rather speciﬁc, since it displays counter-examples to
the L1-stability of shock waves. It turns out that a small amount of dissipation is always
enough to ensure the stability. The proof of this fact is pretty long, because it has to be
done in the case-by-case. To begin with, there is a general argument, due to Freistühler
and the author [16], which reduces the question to that of the stability of constant states
under zero-mass initial disturbances.14 The latter is an interesting problem in itself, and its
treatment highly depends on the nature of the dissipation process. It will be addressed in
Section 4.
The general argument.
For deﬁniteness, we assume s = 0, u+ < u−, and that U is a
steady shock for a given diffusive model. Let a ∈U + L1
0 be an initial datum and u be the
corresponding solution to the Cauchy problem. Our goal is to prove that the L1-distance
of u(t) to the set
A(U) :=

z ∈U + L1(R);z(x) ∈[u+,u−] a.e.

tends to zero as t →+∞. Denote
ˆa(x) := max

a(x),u−
	
,
ˇa(x) := min

a(x),u+
	
.
The functions ˆa −u−and ˇa −u+ are integrable. Since U tends to u+ as x →+∞, we have

R
(u−−U)+ dx = +∞.
Hence, there is enough room between the horizontal line of level u−and the graph of U,
in order to select a function b ∈u−+ L1, with the property that

R
(b −u−)dx = 0,
a(x) ⩽b(x)
a.e.
(75)
14We recall that the L1-stability of constants require that the disturbance be of zero mass.

(76)
Let v,w be the solutions of the Cauchy problem associated to the data b,c. From the
comparison property, we have
w(x,t) ⩽u(x,t) ⩽v(x,y).

Then (79) and (78) give d(u(t);A(U)) →0 and therefore d(u(t);A(U)) →0. Using

ℓ0(a) = ℓ0

u(t)

and thus ℓ0(a) = 0. Hence the stability.

COMMENTS.
• For the Jin–Xin relaxation, the data and the shock wave are pairs (a,b) and (U,V ).
The assumptions are that (a,b) takes its values in a characteristic domain where the
subcharacteristic condition (47) holds strictly, and that a −U ∈L1
0.
• Claim 1 does not hold true in the inviscid case. When f ′′(u0) ̸= 0, zero-mass initial
disturbances develop in the form of “N-waves”, that are pairs of bumps of opposite
signs, going to inﬁnity from both sides. Their heights are of order 1/√t, while their
supports have typical length √t. They carry nonzero masses, which may be computed
explicitly from the initial datum when f is either convex or concave. The propagation
of N-waves have been extensively studied, in the scalar case, by Liu and Pierre [46]
and Dafermos [12], Chapter XI.
4. The L1-stability of constants
This section is devoted to the analysis of Claim 1. It turns out that it holds true for the
viscous, relaxation and Rosenau models. The proof for the relaxation case is cumbersome
and will not be presented here; we refer to [57] for the details.
Remark that, up to the choice of a moving frame,15 we may always assume that
f (u0) = f ′(u0) = 0. Also, a translation in the unknown makes u0 = 0. Thus we shall only
treat the case where
b ∈L1
0(R),
f (0) = f ′(0) = 0.
We use a notation similar than above:
ℓ0(b) := lim
t→+∞∥Stb∥1.
15In a moving frame, a constant remains a constant!

The contraction property implies that ℓ0 is Lipschitz continuous on L1, with
ℓ0(b1) −ℓ0(b2)
 ⩽∥b1 −b2∥1.
(80)
4.1. The viscous case
We recall ﬁrst that the Claim holds true for the heat equation
∂tz = ∂xxz.
(81)
As a matter of fact, if b = ∂xβ with β ∈W 1,1(R), then
z(t)

√t ∥β∥1.
Hence, ℓ0(b) = 0. Since ∂xW 1,1(R) is dense in L1
0(R), (80) tells that ℓ0 ≡0 on L1
0(R).
We notice however that the decay rate t−1/2, which occurs for a data in ∂xW 1,1(R), does
not extend to general data. Indeed, given any decreasing function Φ with Φ(+∞) = 0,
we may ﬁnd a data b in L1
0(R) such that
lim
t→+∞
∥z(t)∥1
Φ(t)
> 0.
We now pass to general viscous conservation laws
∂tz + ∂xf (z) = ∂xxz.
Given a data b ∈L1
0 ∩L∞, we have ∥z∥∞= ∥b∥∞and therefore
|f ◦z| ⩽Nf

∥b∥∞
	
|z|2,
where Nf (∥b∥∞)| is twice the Lipschitz constant of f ′ on the interval [−∥b∥∞,∥b∥∞].

However, since ℓ0(b) = ℓ0(z(t)) for every t, we may apply (82) to z(t) instead, and get

Passing to the limit, we improve (82) into

(83)
Fix a real number R > 0 and consider the ball BR deﬁned by ∥b∥∞< R in L1
0 ∩L∞.
On the connected set BR, (83) tells that either ℓ0(b) = 0, or ℓ0 ⩾1/(c3Nf (R)). Since ℓ0 is
continuous and takes the value zero (for b ≡0), this implies that ℓ0 ≡0 on BR; hence on
the union L1
0 ∩L∞of these balls. This ends the proof of the Claim in the viscous case.

REMARK. The above theorem holds true in higher space dimensions d. Its proof is actually
easier when d ⩾2, because of the stronger dispersion effect. The integral with the nonlin-
earity actually decays to zero in L1-norm (instead of being bounded by c3Nf (∥b∥∞)∥b∥2
1),
giving the result that ∥z(t)−Kt ∗b∥1 tends to zero, no matter the mass of the initial distur-
bance is: The solution of the viscous conservation law is asymptotic to mKt, the solution
of the heat equation with same initial mass m. The same phenomenon is true in one space
dimension provided f ′′(0) = 0, since then ∥f ◦z(t)∥1 is bounded by c∥z(t)∥3
3, which de-
cays16 as t−1. However, it fails when d = 1 and f ′′(0) ̸= 0, since then the solution is
asymptotic to the nonlinear diffusion wave Dm(xt−1/2), the (fundamental) solution of
∂tDm + f ′′(0)

D. Serre
See [15] for a far more complete analysis of the asymptotic behavior in the viscous model
and related questions. See also [36] for a reﬁned analysis in the case of the Burgers equation
(f (u) = u2/2), using diffusive N-waves.
4.2. The Rosenau model
The situation here is a bit more difﬁcult, in the sense that a bounded solution of the Rosenau
model
∂tz + ∂xf (z) = K ∗z −z
is not a mild solution in general: The integral term in the Duhamel’s formula does not
make sense in L1 because the semigroup does not convert the distribution ∂xf (z) into an
ordinary function.
Our strategy is therefore different. The way to make use of the assumption of zero-mass
is to introduce the potential p such that
∂tp = H ∗z −f (z),
∂xp = z,
p(±∞,t) = 0.
Since z is bounded, p is Lipschitz, and one may apply the chain rule to derivatives of
nonlinear functions of p. In particular, using the entropy inequality
∂t
z2
2 + ∂xg(z) ⩽zLz
with g′(s) = sf ′(s), one ﬁnds the remarkable inequality

But since ∥z∥1 is a nonincreasing function of time, this property implies that ℓ0(b) = 0.
At this stage, we have proved the L1-stability for those data which have some regularity
and/or decay at inﬁnity, and that are small in L1. The smoothness and decay are non-
essential assumptions, because we know that the attraction basin of the null function is
closed in the L1-topology. Hence, there remains to get rid of the smallness assumption,
a goal that can be reached exactly in the same way as in the viscous case. This completes
the proof of the Claim, that we rewrite as follows.

OPEN PROBLEM 3. Prove that constants are L1-stable under zero-mass initial distur-
bances for the Rosenau model, when d ⩾2.
5. Multidimensional stability
Consider a viscous17 conservation law in dimension d ⩾2. For the sake of simplicity,
we limit ourselves to d = 2. We call x and y the space variables:
∂tu + ∂xf (u) + ∂yg(u) = u.
(87)
The ﬂuxes are smooth functions. We give a planar shock wave φ in the x direction and as-
sume as above that it is steady: φ = φ(x) satisﬁes φxx = (f ◦φ)x and φ(±∞) = u±.
17Much of the analysis of this section hold for various types of diffusion.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
531
The Rankine–Hugoniot condition tells that f (u+) = f (u−), and we may assume that
f (u±) = 0, u+ < u−and f (u) < 0 in (u+,u−). Integrating once, we have
φx = f ◦φ.
(88)
At last, the possibility of choosing a frame moving uniformly in the y direction allows us
to substract a linear function to g, thus permits to ﬁx
g(u±) = 0.
Given a bounded initial datum a ∈φ + L1(R2), the problem of L1-stability does not
receive the same answer as in the case of a single space dimension. For a shifted proﬁle τhφ,
in the x direction, does not belong to the same class φ +L1, while a shift in the y-direction
does not modify φ. Hence there is no mean to absorb the mass
m :=

R2(a −φ)dx dy
(89)
of the initial disturbance through a translation, as it happened for d = 1.
Therefore, while we still may hope for an L1-stability result when m = 0, we must turn
towards a more complicated description when m ̸= 0. We shall describe here, at a formal
level, the asymptotics that was proved by Goodman and Miller [22], and improved by Hoff
and Zumbrun [29]. We emphasize that the obstruction encountered here is strictly limited
to the L1 context; the asymptotics will involve correctors that tend to zero as t →+∞in
every space Lp, but L1. However, taking in account these correctors allows for a better
decay rate in every Lp.
5.1. Formal asymptotics
The fundamental idea of Goodman and Miller is that, under the additional assumption
that the shock is not characteristic (there holds f ′(u+) < 0 < f ′(u−)), the disturbances
are convected towards the shock front, and then remain in this zone where the front is
stiff, where they are diffused with respect to the y variable. Hence, we expect that the
disturbance will, as in the heat equation, be governed by some function
δ(y,t) = 1
√t D
 y
√t

,
where D is smooth and has a rapid decay. Remark that the y integral of such a function is
constant in time.
Typically, δ acts as a translation: Our solution is asymptotic to φ(x + δ(y,t)), or to
φ(x) + δ(y,t)φ′(x), which amounts the same in L1. The following formula shows that
such a shift is well suited for absorbing the mass m:

We shall focus in this section on the derivation of δ, through an asymptotic expansion.
The expansion that we are looking for deﬁnes an approximate solution v of (87), in the
sense that
N[v] := ∂tv + ∂xf (v) + ∂yg(v) −v
is integrable in space and time on R2 × (0,+∞). That goal needs to incorporate several
terms beyond those which are meaningful in L1. To be precise, we need taking into account
all the differential monomials in δ that are integrable in space and time:
v(x,y,t) := φ(x) + δ(y,t)φx(x) + δyθ(x) + 1
2δ2σ(x)
+ δyyρ(x) + δyδψ(x) + δ3χ(x).
The coefﬁcients θ,... are smooth functions with rapid decay at inﬁnity, so that all terms
but the ﬁrst one are “localized” in the zone where the proﬁle varies signiﬁcantly. Hence,
the integrability properties are inherited from those of the monomials in δ. Noting that
∂m
y δ = t−(m+1)/2D(m)(y/√t ), we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst corrector δφ′ is integrable but does
not decay in L1. The two next correctors decay like t−1/2, while the last three ones decay
like t−1. Higher-order terms, being integrable in space and time, would be useless for
our purpose.
When computing N[v], only terms of order at least t−1/2 are present. Since we wish that
N[v] be integrable in space and time, we have to determine θ,... in such a way that the
terms A of order t−1/2 and B of order t−1 vanish. Let us begin with A:
A = δy

θf ′(φ) −θx + g(φ)
	
x + 1
2δ2
σf ′(φ) −σx + φ2
xf ′′(φ)
	
x.
In order to kill these terms, we take
σ = φxx
and solve
Pθ := θx −f ′(φ)θ = g(φ).
(90)
Notice that the integration constant in (90) has been ﬁxed at zero, because of g(u±) = 0.
Solvability of (90).
This is a ﬁrst-order linear differential equation. Since φx is a non-
trivial solution of the homogeneous equation, the nonhomogeneous one can be solved
explicitly. We ﬁnd
θ = φxz,
zx = g(φ)
φx
= g(φ)
f (φ).

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
533
Since g(u±) = 0 and f ′(u±) ̸= 0, the function g/f is bounded over [u+,u−] and z grows
at most linearly at inﬁnity. Hence θ inherits from φx a rapid decay. Notice that θ is deﬁned
up to a multiple of φx. Since

R φx dx = [u] is nonzero, we may normalize by

R θ dx = 0,
but this is compulsory.
More generally, given a function h(x) with exponential decay at inﬁnity, the equation
PK = h amounts to K = kφx with kx = h/φx. Though k might grow exponentially at
inﬁnity, its growth rate is less than the decay rate of φx, and thus K has a rapid decay at
inﬁnity. This has been well known in the spectral analysis of wave fronts since the seminal
work by Sattinger [55]: though the essential spectrum of P reaches the origin when the
operator is considered within Lp-spaces, it is shifted to the left when working in weighted
spaces with exponentially growing rates. In such spaces, P is onto.
The diffusion equation for δ.
We now turn towards the t−1 terms. We have
B = (δt −δyy)φx + δyy

θg′(φ) −(Pρ)x

g(φ)x + f ′′(φ)φx −Pψ

.
The way to cancel all terms in B is the following. One chooses solutions ψ and χ of
Pψ = g(φ)x + f ′′(φ)φx,
Pχ = 1
6f ′′′(φ)φ3
x.
That makes sense since the right-hand sides are exponentially decaying at inﬁnity.
It is not possible, however, to cancel the term θg′(φ) −(Pρ)x by a choice of ρ;
this would imply an exponential growth of ρ, because ∂xP is not onto. An equation
(PK)x = h, with a rapidly decaying data h, admits a decaying solution if and only if

R h(x)dx = 0. This is not the case here, since

Hence, we reach our target by choosing for δ a solution of the diffusion equation
δt = βδyy.
(92)
Notice that the diffusion coefﬁcient β is strictly larger than the unit. Hence, the transverse
diffusion in the perturbation of the front is stronger than the diffusion of the conservation
law itself.
Having in mind an L1-asymptotics of u, the only freedom degree in the choice of δ is
that of its mass μ :=

we use a one-parameter family vm of approximate solutions, where m := μ[u]. Since most
of the correctors in the deﬁnition of v are negligible in L1, we may as well consider
the family
wm(x,y,t) = φ(x) + δm(y,t)φx(x),
where δm is a solution of (92), whose mass equals m/[u]. We warn however that ∥N[wm]∥1
does not tend to zero as t →+∞. Notice that we may choose v0 = w0 ≡φ.

Since N[vm] is integrable in both space and time, the right-hand side is integrable

Of course, we expect that jm = 0 when m is given by (89).

5.2. Stability results
The previous analysis, though giving a formal asymptotics in L1 (and this asymptotics
can be continued up to every order), does not provide a rigorous proof. There are several
reasons for that ﬂaw, one being the fact that u(t) −φ does not remain in a compact set
of L1, contrary to the one-dimensional case.
Therefore, the method followed in [22] and [29] uses the spectral analysis of the lin-
earized operator around the proﬁle:
Lv := v −∂x

f ′(φ)v
	
−g′(φ)∂yv.
Since its coefﬁcients depend only on the x variable, it is conjugated to a collection of
one-dimensional operators, parametrized by the Fourier variable ξ, dual to y
Lξv :=

∂2
x −ξ2	
v −∂x

f ′(φ)v
	
−ig′(φ)ξv,
that is,
Lξ = ∂xP −ξ2 −ig′(φ)ξ.
Notice that L0 is precisely the linearized operator encountered in the stability analysis of
the one-dimensional case. It has the simple eigenvalue λ = 0, as we have the equation
L0φx = 0,
and φx decays rapidly at inﬁnity.
A fundamental difﬁculty in the stability of viscous shock fronts is that this eigenvalue is
embedded in the essential spectrum, when L0 is associated to a domain Lp. As mentioned
above, Sattinger [55] found that the replacement of Lp by a weighted space shifts the
essential spectrum to the left, so that λ = 0 becomes an isolated eigenvalue. In addition,
Krein–Rutman’s theorem and the fact that φx has a constant sign imply that zero is the
largest eigenvalue and is simple. Therefore standard perturbation theory shows that, within
weighted spaces, Lξ has a unique small eigenvalue λ(ξ) when ξ is small, which is simple.
A classical calculus that we leave to the reader gives
λ(ξ) ∼−βξ2,
where β is the diffusion coefﬁcient found above, conﬁrming our formal asymptotics.
The spectral properties of L are then converted into estimates for the semigroup that it
generates. The nonlinear remainder in (87) is treated with the use of a Duhamel’s principle.
In [22] the linear estimates were obtained by a direct application of Sattinger’s method, so
that the stability result was proved under the assumption that the initial disturbance has a
rapid decay at inﬁnity. Also, for some obscure reason, the result held only for shocks of
moderate amplitude. These ﬂaws were removed in [29], where the linear estimates were
established by a careful analysis of the elliptic and parabolic Green’s functions. There,

536
D. Serre
a stability result is obtained for every noncharacteristic viscous shocks, and for initial dis-
turbances that are small in L1 ∩L∞and have a ﬁnite moment in the x direction. Addition-
ally, the stability result holds true for nonlinear and nonisotropic diffusions

OPEN PROBLEM 4. Prove that a planar scalar multidimensional noncharacteristic shock

REMARKS.
• The stability of constants holds true in every space dimension. See [58]; the proof is
easier in dimension d ⩾2 than in one space dimension, because of stronger disper-
sion. Therefore, it would be sufﬁcient to consider data a which satisfy comparisons
ταφ ⩽a ⩽τβφ.
• When the shock is characteristic, the integral in (91) diverges. Hence the perturbation
of the front obeys to a different asymptotic. Hence the problems:

• The viscous model does not at all exhaust the interesting situations. Each other model
should be studied in details. The most basic question concerns of course the inviscid

waves, under bounded integrable initial disturbances. Describe the asymptotics of the


Rd(a −U)dx dy is nonzero.
6. Discrete shock proﬁles
We go back to a single space variable and consider a discretization by ﬁnite differences,
instead of “continuous” models. The numerical scheme will be chosen in a conservative
form. Writing un
j for the approximation of u(jx,nt), one computes inductively:
un+1
j
= Gun
j−1,un

j+1
	 := un

(96)
The numerical ﬂux F depends on the mesh ratio λ := δt/δx. The consistency with
∂tu + ∂xf (u) = 0
(97)
is expressed by
F(λ;u,u) = λf (u).
(98)
Though we have considered in (96) only three-points difference schemes, the present sec-
tion applies to much more general schemes, where F involves an arbitrary number of
points. The only important properties that we require are the translational invariance (clear
in Formula (96)), and the monotonicity in a strict form. The latter means that G is monotone
increasing with respect to each of its arguments. In particular, the derivatives of F satisfy20
F1(λ;u,v) > 0 > F2(λ;u,v),
F2(λ;u,v) + 1 > F1(λ;v,w)
(99)
for every values u,v,w in some relevant interval I. The monotonicity of the scheme im-
plies readily the comparison property: If u0
j ⩽v0
j for every j, then un
j ⩽vn
j for every
j and n. Besides, the conservative form of the scheme implies the conservation of mass:
If v0 −u0 ∈ℓ1, then vn −un ∈ℓ1, and there holds

20We choose here a strict form of monotonicity, which serves for several purposes. Its drawback is that it rules
out such schemes as the upwind (Godunov) scheme. We shall analyze this borderline case in Section 6.4.

because of 0 < F1(λ;u,u) < 1 and −1 < F2(λ;u,u) < 0.
EXAMPLES.
Lax–Friedrichs scheme.
The iteration is deﬁned by
G(a,b,c) = a + c
2
+ λ
2
f (a) + f (c)	.
It has the form (96), with the numerical ﬂux
FL(a,b) = a −b
2
+ λ
2

f (a) + f (b)
	
=: h+(a) + h−(b).
Since G = G(a,c) does not depend on b, the scheme is not strictly monotone, and the
results below do not apply directly. However, iterating twice the scheme, and relabeling
vm
k := u2m
2k , we obtain a new form of the same scheme:
vm+1
k
= H

vm
k−1,vm
k ,vm
k+1
	
,
H(a,b,c) := G

G(a,b),G(b,c)
	
.
In this new form, the scheme is strictly monotonous as long as the CFL is satisﬁed, since it
implies ∂aG > 0 and ∂cG > 0. Besides, using the identity h+(u) + h−(u) = u, we obtain
the conservative form
H(a,b,c) = b + F ′(a,b) −F ′(b,c),
F ′(a,b) := h+(a) −h−

h+(a) + h−(b)
	
.
Hence the results below are valid for the Lax–Friedrichs scheme.
Godunov scheme.
The Godunov scheme, described in Section 6.4, is a generalization of
the upwind scheme when the ﬂux f is nonmonotone. It is monotone but not strictly, except
in the case where f is strictly monotone. We shall provide in Section 6.4 an extension of
the classical results to this scheme.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
539
Lax–Wendroff scheme.
The Lax–Wendroff scheme is second-order accurate. As such,
it cannot be monotone, even in a nonstrict form, according to a theorem of Harten, Hyman
and Lax [28].
6.1. Shock proﬁles
Given a shock (u−,u+;s) of (97), a “discrete” shock proﬁle is an exact solution of (96),
having the form of a traveling wave:
un
j = u(j −sλn).
Such a solution depends only on the variable (j −λsn)x = x −st, hence it has the
velocity s. We shall see that the dimensionless parameter
η := sλ
plays a fundamental role in the analysis. We notice for the moment that (102) and the Lax
condition imply
|η| < 1.
(103)
Plugging our ansatz in (96), we obtain a functional difference equation for the proﬁle:
u(x −η) = u(x) + F

λ;u(x −1),u(x)
	
−F

λ;u(x),u(x + 1)
	
.
(104)
This equation shows that the proﬁle u must be deﬁned a priori on a set of the form
X + Z + ηZ. When η is irrational, such a set is always dense in R, and is it reasonable21
to ask that u be deﬁned on R and satisfy (104) for every real number x.
When η = p/q is rational, one may restrict the domain of u to a discrete subset of R,
for instance Z + ηZ = 1
q Z. However, there is a good reason why the proﬁle would
actually be considered as a function of a real variable instead of a discrete variable.
Let us assume η = 0 as a typical example of the rational case. Then (104) reduces to
F(λ;u(x −1),u(x)) = F(λ;u(x),u(x + 1)), which can be viewed as a discrete dynami-
cal system
F(λ;uj−1,uj) = F(λ;uj,uj+1),
(105)
which tells that F(λ;uj,uj+1) is independent of j. Letting j →±∞, we ﬁnd that its
constant value equals F(λ;u±,u±) = λ(f (u±) −su±). Hence, we recover the Rankine–
Hugoniot condition as a necessary condition for the existence of a proﬁle. Similarly, the
monotonicity assumption tells that (96) is compatible with some discrete form of entropy
21The name “discrete shock proﬁle” is hardly satisfactory, since a proﬁle could have to be deﬁned on a
dense subset!

540
D. Serre
conditions. Using them as above, we ﬁnd that the Oleinik condition, in its strict form, is
a necessary condition for the existence of a proﬁle.
Because of (99), the identity F(λ;uj,uj+1) = λ(f (u−) −su−) may be written in the
explicit form
uj+1 = g(λ,u−;uj),
(106)
where g(λ,u−;·) is increasing. Since it ﬁxes the points u±, it is a diffeomorphism of the
interval (u+,u−). In addition, the Oleinik condition implies that g(λ,u−;·) has no other
ﬁxed point in this interval. Actually, there holds g(λ,u−;u) < u on (u+,u−). Therefore,
every point u∗∈(u+,u−) gives rise to a unique trajectory (a discrete shock proﬁle) such
that u0 = u∗. This trajectory is decreasing and tends to u± at ±∞. Given a decreasing
parametrization
y ∈[0,1] →u(y) ∈[u0,u1],
(107)
we may deﬁne a continuous and monotone proﬁle u:R →(u+,u−), where u(k + y) is the
kth iterate of (106) from the initial value u(y) (k ∈Z,y ∈[0,1)).
The extension of the previous analysis to other rational values of η is nontrivial, and
we skip the proof of Jennings’ theorem (see also the work by Fan [26]):
THEOREM 9 [31]. Given a conservative, strictly monotone difference scheme (96) in an
interval I, and a strict shock (u−,u+;s) of (97), with u± ∈I. Assume that η := sλ is
rational. Then there exists a continuous and monotone discrete shock proﬁle for this shock.
6.2. The function V
The previous construction does not provide a unique up-to-a-shift continuous discrete pro-
ﬁle, since the parametrization (107) is arbitrary. We now show that a canonical proﬁle
can be ﬁxed, up to a shift. To understand what is going on, we go back to the case of an
arbitrary η.
Applying the contraction property to u and shifts τhu, we ﬁnd that (101) must be an
equality, and therefore each restriction of u to a set x0 +Z+ηZ is monotonous nonincreas-
ing and two such restrictions are comparable. There follows that, up to a rearrangement ρ
such that ρ(x + h) = ρ(x) + h for every h ∈Z + ηZ, u may be chosen monotonous.
Given a shock proﬁle u:R →I, we deﬁne as in [59]
V (h) :=

j∈Z

u(j + h) −u(j)
	
.
Since u has bounded variation, V is well deﬁned. For integer values, we have easily
V (m) = m[u],
m ∈Z.

Remark also
V (−η) =


F(λ;uj−1,uj) −F(λ;uj,uj+1)
	
= λ

f (u−) −f (u+)
	
= −η[u],
because of Rankine–Hugoniot condition. More generally, we have
V (h + 1) = V (h) + [u],
V (h + η) = V (h) + η[u],
from which there comes
V (k) −V (h) = (k −h)[u]
∀k −h ∈Z + ηZ.
Besides, V is nonincreasing since u is so. We conclude that, when η is irrational,
V satisﬁes
V (h) = h[u]
∀h ∈R.
(108)
When η = p/q ∈Q, a proﬁle u does not necessary yield (108), as this only needs to
hold for h ∈Z + ηZ. But every homeomorphism ρ :[0,1/q] →[0,1/q] can be extended
to a homeomorphism ˜ρ of R by ˜ρ(y + 1) = ˜ρ(y) + 1. When composing u by ˜ρ, one keeps
a monotone discrete shock proﬁle ˜u, which yields a function %
V = V ◦˜ρ. From Theorem 9,
V is continuous. Therefore, there exists a unique ρ such that %
V (h) ≡h[u], giving a unique
proﬁle ˜u satisfying (108) and such that ˜u(0) = u(0).
An immediate consequence of (108) comes with the remark that if x < y, then
u(y) −u(x) ⩽

= V (y) −V (x) = (y −x)[u].
We have used the monotonicity of u. This inequality shows that the proﬁle is globally
Lipschitz.
We summarize the results that we have obtained in the following statement.
THEOREM 10. Given a conservative monotone difference scheme (96) in an inter-
val I, and a strict shock (u−,u+;s) of (97), with u± ∈I. Let us suppose that there
exists a discrete shock proﬁle u:R →I. Then, up to a rearrangement ρ such that
ρ(x + h) = ρ(x) + h for every h ∈Z + ηZ:
(i) the proﬁle may be chosen monotonous, and therefore we have u+ < u(x) < u−;
(ii) the function V satisﬁes (108);
(iii) the proﬁle is uniquely deﬁned by (104), the two properties above, and the value
u∗∈(u+,u−) that it takes at x = 0;
(iv) the proﬁle is Lipschitz: if y ⩾x, then
(y −x)[u] ⩽u(y) −u(x) ⩽0.

6.3. Existence of discrete shock proﬁles; irrational case
The existence of discrete shock proﬁles has been treated by Jennings [31], who proved it in
the rational case and claimed it in the irrational case. It is widely accepted that his argument
for the passage from rational to irrational values of η is too light for being “a proof”.
We ﬁll below this gap, giving a complete proof of existence in the irrational case, taking
for granted Theorem 9. Our result actually extends that of Fan [25], which is proved for
the Godunov scheme with a convex ﬂux.
For deﬁniteness, we may assume that η > 0. Recall that η < 1. Deﬁne22

Notice that the constant of integration has been determined by letting x →−∞.
Hence, (110) carries not only the fact that u solves (104), but also the values at inﬁnity
u(±∞) = u±.
We now follow Jennings strategy. Let η = λs be an irrational number, associated to
a strict shock (u−,u+;s), u± ∈I. We may ﬁnd a sequence of strict shocks (un
−,un
+;sn),
converging towards (u−,u+;s) and such that ηn is rational. Hence, there exists a shock
proﬁle un for each element of the sequence. Each un is Lipschitz and monotone decreasing,
unique up to a shift. Given some value u∗∈(u+,u−), we ﬁx these proﬁles by un(0) = u∗.
We notice that the Lipschitz constant of un, being un
−−un
+, remains bounded as n →+∞.
From Ascoli’s theorem, we may extract a subsequence, still labeled un, that converges
uniformly on every compact interval of the line. Denote its limit by u. Uniform conver-
gence allows us to pass to the limit in (110). Hence, u is a solution of (104).
There remains to identify the limits u(±∞), which exist since u is monotonous and
bounded. Passing to the limit as x →±∞in (110), we obtain on the one hand
f

u(±∞)
	
−su(±∞) = f (u−) −su−.
(111)
On the other hand, we have u(0) = u∗and therefore u(+∞) ⩽u∗⩽u(−∞). At last,
un
+ < un < un
−gives u+ ⩽u ⩽u−and thus u(+∞) ⩾u+ and u(−∞) ⩽u−. Hence,
u(−∞) is a zero of v →f (v) −f (u−) −s(v −u−) that belongs to [u∗,u−]. From the

Oleinik criterion, there is only one zero of that function in this interval, namely u−. Hence,
u(−∞) = u−and similarly u(+∞) = u+.
Therefore we may state the following.
THEOREM 11. Given a conservative monotone difference scheme (96) in an interval I,
and a strict shock (u−,u+;s) of (97), with u± ∈I, there exists a discrete shock proﬁle
u:R →I. Up to a rearrangement ρ such that ρ(y + h) = ρ(y) + h for every h ∈Z + ηZ
and y ∈R, it may be taken monotonous and such that (108) holds. Under both these prop-
erties, the proﬁle is unique up to a shift.
Continuous dependence.
From the uniqueness of a discrete shock proﬁle, we see that the
whole sequence un converges, locally uniformly, towards u. Likewise, we have seen that
un(±∞) tend to u(±∞). Viewing R ∪{±∞} as a compact interval on which un and u
are monotonous and continuous, we infer from Dini’s theorem that actually un converges
uniformly towards u. Hence, the proﬁle, considered as an element of Cb(R) and normalized
by u(0) = u∗with u∗∈(u+,u−) (say u∗= (u−+ u+)/2), depends continuously on the
strict shock (u−,u+;s).
The tail of discrete proﬁles.
It is remarkable that the present context permits that the
proﬁles tend exponentially to their limits u±, even for irrational parameters, provided that
the shock satisﬁes the Lax inequalities in the strict form. This fact is far from clear in the
case of systems (see [47]).
Given a proﬁle u, we rewrite the right-hand side of (110) in the form

Let γ be the positive root of the quadratic equation

Since W decays monotonically to zero, this implies that W(x) ⩽C(γ/β)x for some con-
stant C. In particular, W(x) ⩽c(γ/β)x. We emphasize that the rate γ/β is strictly less
than unity, since P(β) = β(α + β) is positive and P(0) = −βη is negative. In summary,
there holds:
THEOREM 12. Let the strict shock (u−,u+;s) satisfy the strict Lax inequalities
f ′(u+) < s < f ′(u−).
Given a monotonous and conservative ﬁnite difference scheme (96) in an interval I that
contains u±. Then the discrete proﬁle associated to this shock tends exponentially to its
limits u± at inﬁnity.
6.4. The case of upwind scheme
When f is monotonous, say increasing, it may be advantageous to consider the scheme
deﬁned by the numerical ﬂux F(λ;u,v) := λf (u). For nonmonotonous functions f , it was
generalized by Godunov [21] in the following way:
F(λ;u,v) = λFG(u,v) := λ
minz∈[u,v] f (z),
u ⩽v,
maxz∈[v,u] f (z),
v ⩽u.
This upwind scheme is monotonous, but not strictly. In particular, the construction done
above for steady shocks does not work because F is not invertible with respect to each
of its arguments u and v. A direct analysis of discrete proﬁles for steady shocks can be
done, however, even for systems of conservation laws. Under reasonable assumptions, the
proﬁle does exist, but it has the strange property of being equal to u−or to u+, away from
an interval of unit length (see [59]). This reﬂects the lack of dissipation of the Godunov
scheme, precisely at rest points (namely at solutions of f ′(u) = 0).
The situation must change drastically as soon as η is different from zero. The proﬁle,
if it exists, must not be “compactly supported”, contrary to the steady case. The existence

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
545
and uniqueness of a discrete shock proﬁle in this case is due to Fan [25]. We give here an
alternate, somehow simpler, proof that follows the strategy already used in Section 6.3.
In a ﬁrst instance, we modify the Godunov scheme by adding a small but positive amount
of dissipation ε. This means replacing the numerical ﬂux by a new one
F ε(λ;u,v) := F(λ;u,v) + ε(u −v).
In other words, the linear term v that is present in G(λ;u,v,w) is replaced by
εu + (1 −2ε)v + εw. Because of the CFL condition, the new scheme is strictly monotone
for ε > 0 small enough.
Theorem 11 therefore applies to the modiﬁed scheme. Given a strict shock (u−,u+;s),
there exists a unique shock proﬁle uε with the normalization uε(0) = u∗(u∗chosen in
(u+,u−)) and V ε(h) = h[u]. It is monotone and Lipschitz continuous, the Lipschitz con-
stant being bounded by |[u]|. Again, we may extract a subsequence, still denoted uε, con-
verging uniformly on every compact set. Denote by u the limit. Pass to the limit in the
integrated form (110) of the proﬁle equations, which contains the boundary conditions at
inﬁnity. We obtain that u satisﬁes the integrated form of the proﬁle equation of the Godunov
scheme. Arguing as in Section 6.3 gives that u is monotone with u(±∞) = u±.
REMARK. The same strategy can be employed in order to show the existence of semidis-
crete proﬁles. Consider the upwind semidiscretization
duj
dt = FG(uj−1,uj) −FG(uj,uj+1),
where FG is the ﬂux deﬁned in the Godunov scheme. We have ﬁxed x = 1. The semidis-
cretization is the formal limit of the Godunov scheme as t tends to zero.
Given a strict shock, one may prove the existence of semidiscrete proﬁles uj(t) =
u(j −st) by passing to the limit as t tends to zero in the discrete ones. We just have
shown that the latter exist, and we know that they have Lipschitz constants less than |[u]|.
Hence, the uniform convergence on every compact set, up to extraction of a subsequence.
Passing to the limit in the integrated form of the discrete proﬁle equation, we obtain that
the limit u satisﬁes the identity
 x
x−1
FG
u(y),u(y + 1)	dy −su(x) = f (u+) −su+.
We deduce on the one hand that u is continuously differentiable and satisﬁes the pro-
ﬁle equation
su′(x) = FG
u(x),u(x + 1)	 −FG
u(x −1),u(x)	.
On the other hand, letting x going to +∞, we also get
f

u(+∞)
	
−f (u+) = s

u(+∞) −u+
	
,
and we conclude as usual.

6.5. Stability of discrete shock proﬁles
In the sequel, we consider solutions and proﬁles that depend on a real variable x. One could
restrict to x ∈Z + ηZ, especially if η is rational. In that case, the word “integrable” must
be replaced by “summable”, and ∥· ∥1 becomes the ℓ1-norm.
Let U be a discrete proﬁle of some shock: un
j := U(j −ηn) solves (96) exactly. Hence,
U is a stationary solution of
un+1(x) = G

un(x + η −1),un(x + η),un(x + η + 1)
	
.
(115)
To begin with, let the initial datum a lie between ταU and τβU. The arguments of Sec-
tion 3.2 work, and we only have to consider those data b that lie between ταU and τβU,
such that the distance ∥Snb −τhU∥1 ≡∥b −τhU∥1, S being the iteration operator deﬁned
by (115). But this is easily seen to imply that b −τhU has a constant sign (see the de-
tails in [31]). This, being true for every real number h, implies that b equals some shift
of U. Hence the L1-stability holds true for such a’s. The standard density argument al-
lows to extend this result to data such that a −U is integrable, and that take values in the
interval [u+,u−].
Going beyond requires proving the L1-stability of constant states under zero-mass initial
disturbances. Of course, this depends on the numerical scheme under consideration. For
instance, a scheme such that the one of Lax–Friedrichs is likely to ﬁt this property, because
of his rather strong dissipation. However, it is not so clear for the Godunov scheme, whom
dissipativeness vanishes at points ¯u such that f ′(¯u) = 0.
OPEN PROBLEM 8. Prove the L1-stability of constants under conservative monotone dif-
ference schemes.
7. Initial-boundary value problems
The previous sections dealt with the pure Cauchy problem, the space domain having
been Rd, with often d = 1. An other interesting situation is that of the initial boundary
value problem (IBVP). Let us consider for instance the viscous model
∂tu + divf (u) = u
in a domain Ω. We supplement it with a bounded initial datum a and a (nonnecessarily
homogeneous) Dirichlet boundary condition u(x,t) = ub on ∂Ω. Here, b may depend
on x ∈∂Ω, but not on the time variable since we are searching asymptotic stability results.
The proof that the IBVP generates a unique semigroup St that satisﬁes the comparison
principle and the L1-contraction property is straightforward. However, and it is important
in the analysis, St does no longer preserve the mass: When integrating the conservation
law on Ω, we ﬁnd that the mass varies with time, proportionally to the ﬂux of ∇xu −f (u)
across the boundary. There is no reason why the latter would vanish.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
547
The asymptotic analysis is pretty easy when Ω is bounded, because of the Poincaré
inequality. The solution tends exponentially to the unique steady solution. Hence, we
shall concentrate on unbounded domains, and more speciﬁcally to the case of a half-space
H := (0,+∞) × Rd−1 as a paradigm.
When Ω = H , we distinguish the variable x normal to the boundary, and the tangen-
tial variables y ∈Rd−1. We ﬁx a constant boundary value ub, and a value at inﬁnity, say
u∞= 0. Hence, we are interesting in bounded data that are integrable. Our problem is
to compare a solution Sta =: u(t) to a steady solution called “boundary layer”, using the
L1-distance d.
The layer, denoted by U, is invariant under translations parallel to the boundary:
U = U(x). It thus satisﬁes the differential equation
U′(x) = f (U) −f (0),
(116)
together with the initial condition U(0) = ub. There does not always exist such a boundary
layer. On the one hand, if f ′
1(0) > 0, the origin is a repulsor for (116) and the only possible
boundary layer is obtained for ub = 0, when it is constant. On the other hand, if f ′(0) < 0,
then a boundary layer exists (and is unique) provided there is no zero of f −f (0) be-
tween ub and the origin. This dichotomy shows the important role played by the hyperbolic
wave velocity associated to the state at inﬁnity.
The borderline case f ′(0) = 0 corresponds to a characteristic boundary for the underly-
ing inviscid model. In general, it is expected to create complications. For instance, if we
were interested in decay rates,23 it would certainly weaken drastically the optimal results,
comparing to the noncharacteristic case. It turns out that, in the one-dimensional analy-
sis done by Freistühler and the author [17], the proofs of L1-stability of constants (say of
the solution ¯u ≡0 with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition) were signiﬁcantly
different, according to the case under consideration: characteristic (f ′(0) = 0) or outgoing
(f ′(0) < 0), while the result itself (instability) is different in the incoming case (f ′(0) > 0).
Surprisingly enough, the characteristic case was the easiest one, because it could be con-
verted in a pure Cauchy problem (see below). We give hereafter a new proof of stability of
the outgoing case, by a comparison with the characteristic one. It does not only simplify
the analysis, but it extends the stability result to several space dimensions.
7.1. Stability of constants
The one-dimensional case has been treated by Freistühler and the author in [17]. There is
a complete description, as far as the L1-asymptotic stability is concerned. It turns out that,
as in the shock-stability problem, the L1-stability of constants plays a fundamental role.
Since constant are not solutions in general, this question makes sense only when ub = 0.
We notice also that the total mass is no longer a conserved quantity and therefore one must
not assume that the initial disturbance have a zero mass.
The dichotomy mentioned above reﬂects in the following statement.
23But we deliberately ignored this aspect in this article, focusing only on the stability itself.

THEOREM 13. Consider the viscous IBVP, with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary con-
dition (ub = 0).
(i) Assume f ′
1(0) ⩽0. Then the L1-stability of u0 ≡0 holds true: If a ∈L1(H), then
lim
t→+∞
u(t)

1 = 0.
(ii) Assume on the contrary that f ′
1(0) > 0. Then there exist bounded initial data
a ∈L1(H) such that
lim
t→+∞
u(t)

1 > 0.
PROOF. We shall treat the ﬁrst part (stability) of the theorem, and refer to [17] for the
second one (instability), since the corresponding proof has a straightforward extension to
the multidimensional setting.
Given a bounded integrable data a, the comparison principle tells that Sta−⩽
u(t) ⩽Sta+, where a± are the positive and negative parts of a. Hence
u(t)

1 ⩽∥Sta−∥1 + ∥Sta+∥1.
Therefore it is enough to consider data of constant signs. For instance, we focus on non-
negative data. Corresponding solutions will be nonnegative.
We begin with the characteristic case: f ′
1(0) = 0. We may ﬁx f (0) = 0. Choosing a
frame that moves with a constant speed, parallel to the boundary, we may also ﬁx f ′
α(0) = 0
for α > 1. Let b and v(t) be the extensions of a and u(t) to the whole space Rd that are
odd with respect to x. Similarly, the restriction of f to R+ is extended to R as a ﬂux g, in
such a way that g1 be even, while gα be odd otherwise. It is clear that the new ﬂux is of
class W2,∞
loc
(locally bounded second derivative). One veriﬁes easily that v is the solution
of the pure Cauchy problem
∂tv + divg(v) = v
with initial datum b. Since b is bounded, integrable with zero total mass, and since
g(w) = O(w2), the proof of the multidimensional version of Theorem 6 works out, and
we obtain
lim
t→+∞
v(t)

1 = 0.
This solves the characteristic case.
Consider now the outgoing case f ′
1(0) < 0. Deﬁne a new ﬂux function F by F1(w) :=
f1(w) −f ′
1(0)w and Fα = fα otherwise. Deﬁne also a function
v(x,y,t) :=

u

x + f ′
1(0)t,y,t
	
if x > −f ′
1(0)t,
0
otherwise.

L1-stability of nonlinear waves in scalar conservation laws
549
The distribution T := ∂tv + divF(v) −v is supported by the hyperplane x = f ′
1(0)t.
More precisely, it is given by
T = ∂u
∂ν (0,y,t)δx = f ′
1(0)t	.
Since u is nonnegative (recall that a ⩾0) and vanishes at the boundary, its normal deriva-
tive must be nonpositive and therefore we have T ⩽0. Since v(0) = a, we obtain that v is
a subsolution of the characteristic IBVP (remark that F ′
1(0) = 0):
∂tw + divF(w) = w,
w(x,y,0) = a,
w(0,y,t) = 0.
The maximum principle applies to that kind of evolution problem and gives v ⩽w.
Thus we obtain
u(t)

1 =
v(t)

1 ⩽
w(t)

1.
Since we already treated the characteristic case, we know that ∥w(t)∥1 tends to zero at in-
ﬁnity and this implies the desired result.
□
7.2. Stability of boundary layers
Using Theorem 13, plus arguments of dynamical systems theory, one obtains the same kind
of one-dimensional stability result than for viscous shocks:
THEOREM 14 (d = 1 [17]). Let U(x) be a nontrivial (that is, ub ̸= u(+∞)) bound-
ary layer for the viscous model. Then it is L1-stable: Given any bounded initial data
a ∈U + L1, one has
lim
t→+∞
u(t) −U

1 = 0.
REMARKS.
1. Since U is nontrivial, f ′(0) must be nonpositive. Hence, the ﬁrst part of Theorem 13
can be used.
2. Theorem 14 could not be true for constant U in general, because of the second part
of Theorem 13.
3. When f ′(0) < 0, U is itself integrable (say that u(+∞) = 0) because it decays ex-
ponentially. Hence the assumption on the data is really that a is integrable. However,
in the characteristic case, the boundary layer is not integrable, because it decays at
best as 1/x. Hence, the data are not integrable in this case. It would be interesting of
course to prove Lp-stability results in this case, with p such that U ∈Lp(0,+∞).
For instance, p > 1 is relevant when f ′(0) = 0 ̸= f ′′(0).

In several space dimensions, the situation is curious. Remember that, when studying the
L1-stability of viscous shock waves, we encountered a difﬁculty caused by the conserva-
tion of mass: The convergence ∥u(t) −U(· −st)∥1 →0 could not hold unless the initial
disturbance had zero mass. This is no longer true for boundary layers since mass conserva-
tion does not hold. Hence, we may expect a general stability result, regardless the mass of
initial disturbance. However, we still miss a compactness argument, due to the translational
invariance along directions that are parallel to the boundary. Thus we left the following

Thanks to his friendly pressure, this topic is now presented in a uniﬁed way, after having
been disseminated in several smaller papers. This writing gave me the occasion to solve a
few open question and to ﬁx a few points of which the difﬁculty was underestimated in the
