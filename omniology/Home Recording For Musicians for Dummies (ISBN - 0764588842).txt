Introduction
I
f you’re like most musicians, you’ve been noodling around on your instru-
ment for a while and have finally decided to take the plunge and get seri-
ous about recording your ideas. You may just want to throw a few ideas down
onto tape (or hard drive) or capture those magic moments that you have
with your band. Or you may want to compose, record, produce, and release
the next great platinum album. Either way, you’ll find that having a home
studio can give you hours of satisfaction.
Well, you’ve chosen a great time to get involved in audio recording. Not long
ago, you needed to go to a commercial recording studio and spend thousands
of dollars if you wanted to make a decent-sounding recording. Now you can
set up a first-class recording studio in your garage or spare bedroom and
create CDs that sound as good as those coming out of top-notch studios (that
is, if you know how to use the gear).
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is a great place to
start exploring the gear and techniques you need to create great CDs (if I do
say so myself). This book introduces you to home recording and helps you to
get your creative ideas out into the world.
About This Book
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies not only introduces you to the
technology of home recording but also presents basic multitrack recording
techniques. In the pages to follow, you find out about the many types of digi-
tal recording systems that are available, including computer-based systems,
all-in-one recorder/mixer systems (called studio-in-a-box systems), and stand-
alone recorders that require separate mixers and effects processors.
You get acquainted with the basic skills that you need to make high-quality
recordings. These skills can save you countless hours of experimenting and
searching through owner’s manuals. Some of these skills are as follows:
 You discover the ins and outs of using the various pieces of equipment
in your studio.
 You explore tried-and-true engineering techniques, such as microphone
choice and placement.

 You discover the concepts of multitracking, mixing, and mastering.
 You find out how to turn all your music into complete songs and dis-
cover how to assemble and release an album.
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies puts you on the fast track toward
creating great-sounding CDs because it concentrates on showing you skills
that you can use right away and doesn’t bother you with tons of technical
jargon or useless facts.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
I have to admit that when I wrote this book, I made a couple of assumptions
about you, the reader (and you know what happens when you ASSume 
anything). First, I assume that you’re interested in recording your music 
(or someone else’s) in your home and not interested in reading about under-
water basket weaving (a fascinating subject, I’m sure, but not appropriate for
a book entitled Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies).
I assume that you’ll most likely record your music using a digital hard-drive
recording system because these are the most common types of systems
available. I also assume that you’re relatively new to the recording game and
not a seasoned professional. (Although if you were, you would find that this
book is a great reference for many audio engineering fundamentals.) Oh, and I
assume that you play a musical instrument or are at least familiar with how
instruments function and how sound is produced.
Other than these things, I don’t assume that you play a certain type of music
or that you ever intend to try to “make it” in the music business (or even that
you want to treat it as a business at all).
How This Book Is Organized
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies is organized so that you can find
the information that you want quickly and easily. Each section contains chap-
ters that cover a specific part of the home recording process. In Part I, you
discover the tools of your auditory craft and get them up and running, while
Part II introduces you to general recording practices. Part III helps you get
the best sound that you can from your instruments, and Part IV digs into the
multitrack recording process. Part V shows you how to turn it all into music
and helps you share your music with others, and Part VI gives you tips and
resources to keep your music growing.

later). It also guides you through the process of editing data — moving, fixing,
deleting, and so on. This process can be done in two ways (visually or
aurally), and you explore both in this chapter.
Part V: Turning Your Tracks 
into a Finished Song
Part V helps you to take all your individual tracks and blend them together to
create a finished song. Chapter 13 helps you clean up your tracks with edit-
ing. Both audio and MIDI editing are covered in detail. Chapter 14 shows you
how to get your tracks to fit and sound good as a unit through the process of
mixing. Chapter 15 explores how you can use effects, not only to make your
music sound as natural as possible but also to help you create special effects
that can add interest for your listeners. Chapter 16 demystifies the mastering
process. You discover what mastering is and how to use it to make your
music sound like the CDs at the music store. Chapter 17 helps you break out
of your cocoon so that you can share your finished music with others by
showing you how to make copies of your CD, format your music for Internet
distribution, and promote your music to gain listeners.

 Making sense of mixing and mastering
 Finishing up your project
A
udio recording is a fun and exciting activity. Being able to put down
your musical ideas and craft them into an album is nearly every musi-
cian’s dream. The only problem is the learning curve that comes with being
able to record your music at home; most musicians would rather spend their
time and energy making music.
In this chapter, I help you get a handle on the basics of home recording and
show you what’s involved in the process. You discover the basic components
of a recording studio and get some ideas about the gear you need to get first.
In addition, you explore the multitracking process and find out what’s involved
in mixing your tracks. You move on to explore mastering and find out ways to
get your music to your listeners.
Examining the Anatomy 
of a Home Studio
Whether it’s a $100 portastudio or a million-dollar commercial facility, all
recording studios contain the same basic components. This is an area where
many people get lost and one about which I receive the most e-mails. As you
glimpse into the recording world, you’ll inevitably think that this will cost
way too much and be way too complicated. Well, it can be. But it can also be
pretty simple and cost efficient. In the following sections, I present a list of
the essentials of audio recording and offer some insight into cost-saving and
efficient systems that you can find in the market.

Exploring the recording essentials
To take the mystery out of recording gear, here are the essentials that you
need to know:
 Sound source: The sound source is your voice, your guitar, your ukulele,
or any other of the many sound makers that are out there. As a musician,
you probably have at least one of these at your disposal right now.
 Input device: Input devices are what you use to convert your sound into
an electrical impulse that can then be recorded. Here are the three basic
types of input devices:
• Instruments: Your electric guitar, bass, synthesizer, and drum
machines are typical instruments that you plug into the mixer.
These instruments constitute most of the input devices that you
use in your studio. The synthesizer and drum machine can plug
directly into your mixer or recorder, whereas your electric guitar
and bass need a direct box (or its equivalent, such as a Hi-Z input in
your mixer) to plug into first. A direct box is an intermediary device
that allows you to plug your guitar directly into the mixer. Chapter 7
explores instruments and their connections to your system.
• Microphone: A microphone (mic) enables you to record the sound
of a voice or an acoustic instrument that you can’t plug directly
into the recorder. A microphone converts sound waves into electri-
cal energy that can be understood by the recorder. I detail several
types of microphones in Chapter 6.
• Sound module: Sound modules are special kinds of synthesizers
and/or drum machines. What makes a sound module different from
a regular synthesizer or drum machine is that a sound module con-
tains no triggers or keys that you can play. Instead, sound modules
are controlled externally by another synthesizer’s keyboard or by a
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller (a specialized
box designed to control MIDI instruments). Sound modules — with
the exception of soft-synths — have MIDI ports (MIDI jacks) that
enable you to connect them to other equipment. (Soft-synths are
software programs that don’t need hardware MIDI connections
because the sound modules are stored on your computer’s hard
drive.) Chapter 5 digs into the details about sound modules.
Depending on what your sound source is, it may also be an input device.
For example, an electric guitar has pickups that allow you to plug it
directly into a mixer input without having to use a microphone. On the
other hand, your voice can’t accept a cord, so you need to use a mic to
turn your singing into an electrical impulse that can be picked up by
10
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

your mixer or equivalent device. You can find out more about input
devices in Chapter 7.
 Mixer: A mixer is used to get your input device into your recorder and
to route signals in a variety of ways. Traditionally, a mixer serves the fol-
lowing two purposes:
• To route your signals into your recorder: This allows you to set
the proper level for each input device so that it’s recorded with the
best possible sound. Chapter 4 explores the different mixer-type
devices for this purpose.
• To blend (mix) your individual tracks into a stereo pair (the left
and right tracks of your stereo mix): This role of the mixer is
where your vision as a music producer takes center stage and
where you can turn raw tracks into a polished piece of music.
Chapter 14 explores this use of a mixer.
 Recorder: The recorder is where your audio data is stored. For most
home recordists, this is a digital recorder. You can find out more about
the different types of recorders in the next section of this chapter.
 Signal processors: Most of the time, you have to tweak your recorded
tracks. Signal processors give you the power to do this. Signal proces-
sors can be divided into the following three basic categories:
• Equalizers: Equalizers let you adjust the frequency balance of your
tracks. This is important for making your instruments sound as
clear as possible and for getting all your tracks to blend well.
• Dynamics processors: Dynamics processors are used to control the
balance between the softest and loudest parts of your tracks. They
have many uses in the studio to help you make your tracks sit well
together and to keep from overloading your system. Chapters 7, 15,
and 16 explore ways to use dynamics processors in your music.
• Effects processors: Effects processors allow you to change your
tracks in a variety of ways, to create either a more realistic sound
or unusual effects. Typical effects processors include reverb, delay,
chorus, and pitch shifting. You can find out more about these
processors in Chapter 15.
 Monitors: It’s impossible to know the quality of your recording and
mixing without proper monitors, such as quality headphones or speak-
ers. Monitors come in two basic designs:
• Passive: Passive monitors are like your stereo speakers in that you
also need some sort of amplifier to run them. A ton of options are
available with prices from around $100. Just remember that if you
go this route, you need to budget in money for an amp. This can
run a few hundred or more dollars.
11
Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording

• Active: Active monitors have an integrated amplifier in each speaker
cabinet. Having a built-in amp has its advantages, including just the
right amount of power for the speakers and short runs of wire from
the amp itself to the speakers (this is kind of a tweaky area that
some people claim produces a better sound). You can find quite a
few active monitors on the market starting at just a couple hun-
dred dollars.
Checking out recording system types
With the long list of equipment that I present in the previous section, you
may think that you need to spend a ton money to get everything you need.
Fortunately, a lot of home recording systems are available that contain many
of the components you need without having to buy everything separately. I
go into detail about these systems in Chapter 2, but here’s a basic overview:
 Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: These are all-in-one units that have
everything in them except for the sound source, input device, and moni-
tors. For very little money (starting well under $1,000), you get almost
everything you need to get started recording. These types of systems
are also easy to get started with and are great for musicians that don’t
want to spend a ton of energy tweaking their setup.
 Computer-based systems: These systems use the processing power of
your computer to record, mix, and process your music. Computer-based
systems, like the studio-in-a-box system, perform many of the typical
recording functions at once. When you have one of these systems, you
only need your sound source, your input devices, and your monitors.
 Stand-alone systems: These systems are reminiscent of traditional
recording studios in that all the pieces of gear are separate. The down-
side is that you have to buy all your components separately, which can
cost you more than buying one of the more inclusive systems (for exam-
ple, the SIAB and computer-based systems). For people who already
have a bunch of gear, such as a mixer and signal processors, this can be
a decent option because you’re buying only what you need at the time.
Getting a Glimpse into 
the Recording Process
It’s easy to focus on all the gear that’s used in audio recording and think that
the process must be pretty complicated. Well, it can be if you want it to, but it
doesn’t need to be. The heart of recording over the last 30 years or so has
12
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

been an approach called multitracking. At its core, multitracking involves
recording all the instruments on separate tracks so that you can mix them later
almost any way you want. You can multitrack by recording everything — or
at least most of the instruments — at one time, just like a live performance, or
you can go to the other extreme and record each instrument separately. Either
way, you need a bunch of tracks to be able to record to, and you need to under-
stand how to get all these separate pieces to blend into something musical.
Setting up a song
The first step in recording your music is to set up your system to record.
Because you’re probably using some sort of digital system, you need to con-
figure your song. This usually involves setting the file type, bit depth, and
sample rate. This process is one that you’ll get very good at in no time. To get
the lowdown on setting up songs in various systems, check out Chapter 10.
Getting a great sound
Getting your sound source to sound great in your system is the most impor-
tant aspect of recording quality music (well, aside from the song and the per-
formances). This is also an area where you’ll constantly be growing and learn-
ing. I’ve been recording professionally for almost 20 years, but I still discover
something new every time I set up a mic or plug in an electronic instrument.
The great thing here is that any time you spend tweaking your mic placement
or recording chain setup (configuration and levels) is time well spent and is
often rewarded with added clarity or at least a more interesting sound. To
help you get up to speed on all the intricacies of getting high-quality source
sounds, check out Part III of this book.
Recording
After you have everything set up, the actual process of recording your music
properly is pretty straightforward: You enable your track and press the
Record button. This is easier said than done when the clock is ticking and
you know that every mistake that you make is being documented. Luckily,
digital recording makes it easy to redo a track without costing you anything
in audio fidelity. (It will cost you time though, but because you record at
home, you may have more time to get it right). Check out Chapter 11 for the
specifics on recording using a variety of digital systems.
13
Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording

Overdubbing
With one track recorded, you’re ready to dig into one of the most invigorating
parts of the multitracking process: overdubbing. Overdubbing is the process
of adding new tracks to your existing ones. This feature allows you to be 
the one-man band or to bring in other musicians to spice up your music.
Overdubbing is easily done with digital multitrack recorders, and to get you
going quickly, I cover the details in Chapter 11.
Making Sense of Mixing
For most recordists, the process of mixing is what turns their mish-mash of
musical tracks into a song. Mixing involves the following steps:
 Cleaning up your tracks by getting rid of unwanted noise and perfor-
mance glitches
 Equalizing each track so that it blends well with all the others
 Adding signal processing to enhance each track
 Setting levels for each track to tell the story you want to tell with 
your song
The following sections offer an overview of these steps.
Cleaning up tracks using editing
When you record, you want the best possible sound and performance for
each instrument that you can get, but try as you might, sometimes you run
into problems. These can include picking up unwanted sounds, such as chair
squeaks, coughs, or other instruments, and can include (and often does) mis-
takes on the part of musician that need to be cut out. In the olden days of
tape recording, this editing process took time and skill to physically cut out
the bad parts of the tape with a razor blade. Today, you can do the necessary
editing using the editing functions that are available in digital systems. This is
nice, but it can also tempt you into doing more editing than is necessary to
your tracks and, as a result, can suck the life out of them. To help you under-
stand what you can do with digital recording systems and to help keep you
on track with your editing, check out Chapter 13.
14
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Equalizing your tracks
When you start mixing a bunch of instruments, you often need to adjust the
frequencies present in each instrument so that they all blend without creat-
ing mush (a highly technical term). By adjusting the frequencies of each
instrument in the mix, you can make sure that each can be heard. This
process is simple, but it can be time consuming. To make it easier for you, I
cover equalization in detail in Chapter 14.
Processing your signal
In the world of multitracking and small, acoustically untreated recording
rooms (most home recordists use a spare bedroom or basement to record in
and don’t have a ton of money to make the room sound great), it is almost
essential to process the sound with effects or dynamics processors. Doing so
is usually intended to add some of the live feel of a concert to the recording,
although many people also use signal processing to create interesting effects.
Because the possibilities for processing your track using a digital system are
almost limitless, this is an area where most beginners overdo it. Because this
ability to alter your tracks can be used and abused, I cover some of the basics
of processing in Chapter 15 to help you keep the abuse to a minimum.
Blending your tracks
This is also a process in which most new recordists run into problems.
Properly mixing your tracks means keeping levels from getting out of hand,
placing things where you want them in the sound field (left to right and front
to back), adjusting EQ to blend all your instruments in a pleasing way, and
using signal processors, such as compression and reverb, to make the most
of each track. This process is a circular one and takes some skill and patience
to get right. Cutting corners always results in an end product that falls short
of its potential. To help you make this process easier, I cover mixing in detail
in Chapters 14 and 15.
Adding the Final Touches
After your songs are recorded and mixed, all that’s left to do is add the finish-
ing touches. These include mastering your songs, putting them all on CD, and
getting them out into the world through promotion.
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording

Mastering your mixes
Mastering is an often-misunderstood (and even unknown to many) part of the
music production process that can make or break a CD (well, not literally).
Mastering consists of several important steps that are intended to polish
your songs so that they make up a complete collection on a CD, commonly
referred to as an album. Here are the steps for mastering your songs:
1. Optimize the dynamics.
The goal here is to get the dynamic levels within and between each song
to their best. It also means making your music smooth (no sharp edge to
the music) or punchy (a pronounced attack) — or something in between.
Unfortunately, most people are only concerned with getting their CD as
loud as possible when performing this part of mastering. This isn’t a
good idea, as you find out in Chapter 14.
2. Adjust the overall tonal balance.
The point of this part of the mastering process is to create some tonal
continuity among all the songs on your CD. Because you probably
recorded and mixed all your tunes over a period of months, they each
can have slightly different tonal characteristics. This part of mastering 
is where you make all your songs consistent so that they sound like 
part of an album and not a bunch of disjointed tunes thrown together
haphazardly.
3. Match the song-to-song volume.
When your listeners put on your CD, you don’t want them to have to
adjust the volume of each song as it plays (unless they absolutely love a
particular tune and want to turn it up, of course). The goal with this part
of mastering is to get the volume of all the songs on a CD at pretty much
the same level. This keeps one song from barely being heard while
another threatens to blow the speakers.
4. Set the song sequence.
How your songs are arranged on your CD helps tell your story. To make
the most compelling musical statement, give some serious thought to
the order of each song on your album. This part of the mastering
process involves not only deciding what order everything should be in
but also the steps you take to make it happen.
Putting your music on CD
Recording your finished and mastered songs to a CD for distribution and
sales is one of the most exciting parts of the recording process. At last you
have a product, a complete musical statement that you can share with 
(or sell to) others. Like a lot of audio recording and production, the act of
16
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

making CDs is more involved than simply clicking the Burn button in your CD
recording program (at least if you want to make more than one copy). You
can either duplicate or replicate your CDs to make copies to give or sell to
your fans. Here’s a quick rundown on the differences between these two
approaches (Chapter 16 explains them in detail):
 Duplication: Duplication consists of burning multiple CD-Rs from an
audio file. Duplication requires very little setup, so it doesn’t cost much
to make smaller quantities, such as 50–200 CDs.
 Replication: The replication process starts with producing a glass master
from your finished CD-R. This master CD is then used to create CDs
using special CD presses, just like the major-label releases. Replication
costs a bit more for setup, but the cost to create larger quantities of CDs
is lower than that for duplication. This is a good choice for quantities of
500 or more.
Promoting your music
The final and most grueling step of recording and putting out a CD is the pro-
motion process. This is where you either make it or break it as an independent
artist. To help you along, I offer some ideas and insights in Chapter 17.

Getting the Right Gear
In This Chapter
 Understanding your home recording needs
 Taking a look at digital recorders
 Understanding analog studio equipment
 Exploring a few different recording systems
F
or many people, building a home studio is a gradual thing. You may start
out with a synthesizer and a cassette recorder and add a microphone.
Then you may decide to buy a multitrack recorder. Then you trade in your
stereo speakers for real studio monitors. And before you know it, you’ve
invested thousands of dollars in a first-rate home studio.
When setting up your home studio, you can go a couple of routes. You can
walk into your local musical instrument store or pro audio shop without any
forethought, get the pieces of gear that catch your eye, and then figure out
where you may use them in your studio. (Hey, don’t laugh; I’ve done this.) 
Or, you can determine your goals ahead of time and research each piece of
equipment before you buy it to make sure that it is the best possible solution
for you at the best price point. I recommend the latter approach because you
end up with only the equipment that you need and not a bunch of useless
gear that may only look good sitting in your studio.
The process of choosing the right equipment doesn’t have to be difficult. All
it takes is a little self-assessment and some basic knowledge about the differ-
ent equipment options. This chapter helps you discover these things. Here,
you get a chance to explore a few different system configurations and begin
to understand what can work for your situation. You also get a chance to
familiarize yourself with some of the many analog extras that so many people
who favor digital recording want today.
Digital recording technology is evolving at an incredible rate. As soon as the
ink dries on this paper, the next best thing in recording gear may surpass
much of the technology that I write about in this chapter. It’s tempting to
always look to the next great innovation before you decide on a recording
system, but I caution you against this wait-and-see attitude. Digital recording
technology is now at the point that what you can record in your meager home

studio can sound as fat, as clean, or as (insert your favorite recording adjec-
tive here) as the best recordings that have been released in the last 20 years.
Don’t be afraid to just jump in and start recording. The way to great-sounding
recordings is through hours of recording experience (not to mention having
great songs with which to work).
Some of the equipment that I describe in this chapter isn’t on the top of the
list for most home recordists. I discuss this equipment, though, because
you’ll likely be taken over by a disease that runs rampant in the audio record-
ing world. Yes, I’m sorry to inform you that you’re almost assuredly going to
get a chronic case of GAS (gear acquisition syndrome). Don’t worry; it’s not
terminal (unless, of course, you don’t run your future purchases by your
family first), but it can be uncomfortable. Nothing much is worse than having
your eye on a piece of gear you just can’t afford. “Let’s see, food for a month
or that new compressor I’ve just gotta have? . . . Oh well, I needed to go on a
diet anyway.”
The good news is that you’ll never run out of new equipment to drool over
and you’ll never be alone in your suffering — everyone who owns a recording
studio (private or commercial) suffers from GAS to some extent. The best
way to keep GAS at bay is to decide on a system and buy it. Then stop look-
ing at gear and get to work making some music. After all, that’s why you
bought the stuff in the first place.
Determining Your Home Studio Needs
Home studios can vary tremendously. A home studio can be simple, like a
cassette deck and an inexpensive microphone set up in the corner of your
bedroom. Or you can opt for something elaborate, like a multitrack digital
recorder with thousands of dollars in outboard gear and expensive instru-
ments residing in an acoustically treated addition to your house (whew!).
Whatever your budget, your first step in choosing what type of home record-
ing system to buy is to determine your recording goals. Use the following
questions to help you uncover what you truly need (and want) in your home
studio. As you answer these questions, remember that most recording stu-
dios aren’t built all at once — pieces of equipment are added slowly over
time (a mic here, a preamp there). When getting your first home studio system,
start with only those pieces of gear that you really need and then add on
slowly when you get to know your equipment.
For most home recordists, the weakest link in their recording system is their
engineering know-how. A $2,000 mic is useless until you gain an understand-
ing of the subtleties of mic placement, for instance. (Check out Chapter 8 for
more on such subtleties.) I recommend that you wait to buy that next piece
of gear until you completely outgrow your present piece of equipment.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

To get an understanding of what kind of home studio is best for you, ask
yourself the following questions:
 How much money can I spend on equipment? For most people, money
is the ultimate determining factor in choosing their studio components.
Set a budget and try to stay within it. The sky’s the limit on what you
could spend on recording equipment for your home studio, but you
don’t need to spend a ton of money. If you know your goals and do your
research, you can create top-quality recordings without having the best
of everything.
In fact, your skill as a recording engineer has a much greater effect on
the overall quality of your sound than whether you have a $3,000
preamp. With the techniques that you discover in this book and tricks
that you uncover as you get to know your equipment, you can make
recordings good enough to compete in the marketplace.
Digital recording technology has improved tremendously over the last
few years and will continue to improve in the years to come. Don’t get
sucked into the belief that you have to have the latest, greatest thing to
make great music. After all, great albums and #1 hits throughout history
were recorded on lesser equipment than you can find in most home stu-
dios today. Focus on the song and the arrangement, practicing solid
recording techniques, and you can get by with any of the pro or semipro
recording systems available.
 Is this studio just for me, or do I intend to hire it out to record others?
Your answer to this question may help you decide how elaborate a
system you need. For example, if you eventually want to hire yourself
and your studio out to record other people, you need to think about the
compatibility of your system with other commercial studios. Your
clients need to be able to take the music that they record at your studio
and mix or master it somewhere else. You also may have to buy specific
gear that clients want to use, which often means spending more money
for equipment from sought-after manufacturers that may sound the
same as lesser-name stuff. If you’re interested in going the commercial
studio route, check out other commercial studios in your area and find
out what they use and what type of equipment their clients ask for.
If this studio is just for your use, you can focus on getting the best bang
for the buck on gear without worrying about compatibility or marketabil-
ity issues. (Check out my Web site (www.jeffstrong.com) for a list of
“biggest bang for the least bucks” finds.)
 Will I be recording everything directly into the mixing board, or will I
be miking most of the instruments? Your answer to this question is going
to dictate your choice in how much of your budget goes toward equip-
ment and acoustical treatments for your room. If you intend to plug your
instruments directly into the mixer and you only need a microphone for
the occasional vocal, you have more money to spend on synthesizers or
plug-ins for your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) — or you just won’t
21
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

have to spend as much. (DAWs are covered in detail in the section
“Computer-Based DAW Systems,” later in this chapter.)
Conversely, if you plan to record a band live, you must allocate enough
money for those pieces of gear to allow you to do that effectively, such
as having enough mics and inputs, sound isolation, and available tracks
of simultaneous recording.
 How many tracks do I need? Recorders come with 4, 8, 16, 24, and
sometimes more available tracks. The answer to this question has more
importance if you’re considering a stand-alone recorder or a studio-in-a-
box (SIAB) system because they aren’t as easily expandable. (For the
lowdown on these systems, see the section “Studio-in-a-Box Systems,”
later in this chapter.)
Having more tracks is not necessarily a better thing. The more tracks
you have, the more you think that you need to fill them for every song.
This can make for cluttered arrangements and hard-to-mix songs. No
matter how many tracks you end up with, use only those that you need
to make your recording the best that it can be.
With digital recorders, you can create submixes and bounce several
tracks into one or two without losing sound quality, reducing the need
for more tracks. (Find out more about bouncing in Chapter 11.)
Remember that some great albums were made using just 4 or 8 tracks.
 Will I be sequencing the parts or playing the instruments live? If you
plan on sequencing all your music (that is, programming your part into a
computer or sequencer and having it play your part for you), make sure
that you get a good MIDI controller. You can also consider having less
capability for audio tracks. But if you plan to play and record all the
instruments live, make sure that your recorder has enough tracks for
you to put each instrument on its own track.
Detailing Your Digital Options
Even with the fast pace of today’s technology, one thing is for sure in the home
recording world: Digital is here to stay. Digital recording has become the stan-
dard for home recordists and most commercial studios. And the format of
choice is hard drive because it has many advantages over the other forms of
digital recording. Not only does hard-drive recording create a great sound,
but it’s also relatively inexpensive, especially compared with an equivalent-
sounding studio from 10 to 15 years ago.
In the sections that follow, I examine the main types of digital home studios:
computer-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), the all-in-one SIAB (studio-
in-a-box) systems (such as the Roland V-Studios), and stand-alone recorders
(like the Tascam MX2424). Each has its advantages. What’s right for one person
may not be the best choice for another. (Isn’t it great to have choices?)
22
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Regardless of the type of digital recording system that you like, consider the
following things before buying:
 Editing capabilities: Some systems allow very fine editing of audio data,
while others offer less. If you want so much control that you can edit
down to the waveform — which basically means being able to edit out a
single note or even just a part of a note — look for a system with that
capability. If such control is less important to you, take a pass on such
systems.
Along with the actual editing capabilities, find out how this editing is
done. Is it on a tiny LCD screen or can it be done on a large computer
monitor? Of course, if you won’t be doing a lot of editing, this feature
may not be important to you. If this is the case, you may be able to buy a
system for less money that sounds as good as the one with full editing
capability. It doesn’t make sense to pay for something that you won’t use.
 Compatibility: Compatibility between the various parts of your system
(the recorder and sequencer or the software and sound card, for
instance) or between your studio and other studios (your friend’s or a
commercial studio) is an important issue for many people and one that
may come back to bite you if you don’t consider it before you buy a
system. For example, some plug-ins don’t work with certain software
programs. If you just have to have a certain soft-synth (software synthe-
sizer) or amp simulator plug-in, make sure that you buy a system that
allows you to use it. (Plug-ins are extra sounds, samples, and effects that
you can “plug in” to your computer-based DAW’s software program to
increase its capabilities.) Likewise, some sound cards don’t work well
with certain software programs.
 Number of simultaneous tracks: Even though a recorder may say it has
16 tracks, it may not be able to actually record that number of tracks at
one time. Most studio-in-a-box recorders, for example, record fewer
tracks than they can play back at once. This usually isn’t a problem
because you will likely record only a few tracks at a time and overdub
the rest. This would be a problem if you need to record all 16 tracks of a
16-track recorder, such as recording a band playing live at a club.
 Realistic track count: If you end up considering a computer-based
system, the number of tracks that a computer software program is
advertised to record and how many tracks you can actually record with
your computer are often two very different things. Find out beforehand
what a realistic track count is with the CPU (processor) and RAM
(memory) that you have so that you’re not disappointed after you’ve
forked over your hard-earned money. The best way to do this is to go to
online forums (such as the ones described in Chapter 18) or talk to
other users in your area to see what their real-world experiences are.
 Sample rate and bit depth: The sample rate and the bit depth of the
system determine how good a sound you can get from it. (The bit depth
is the size of the audio sample in binary digits, and the sample rate is
23
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

how often the sample is taken per second — notated as kHz.) Most semi-
pro and pro systems have a 24-bit resolution and the ability to record 
at several bandwidths — 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, and 96 kHz, for instance. 
The number of tracks may vary depending on what bandwidth setting
you choose.
Although most pros still record at 44.1 kHz (the standard for CD audio),
more people now want to record at 96 kHz (the standard for DVD audio).
Even with the most expensive recorder, you have to live with having
about half as many tracks at your disposal when recording at 96 kHz
instead of 44.1 kHz because of the additional processing power it takes
to record at the higher resolution.
 Expandability: As you learn and grow as a musician and recording engi-
neer, your needs can also grow. Knowing this, your best bet is to plan
ahead and choose a system that can grow with you. Can you add more
tracks by synching another machine or increasing available RAM? Can
you easily synchronize the system with other machines? For example, if
you want to record 24 tracks now and you use a stand-alone recorder,
can you add another recorder and have it synch properly? Or, if you buy
an SIAB and you want to add more inputs later, can the system you’re
looking at do that? Some can and some can’t, so do your research and
think about your future needs.
You’ll find that almost all the new semipro and pro systems available are
expandable, but explore these questions carefully if you look at purchas-
ing used gear.
Computer-Based DAW Systems
Computer-based digital recording systems are hardware and software options
that you can connect to your computer. These systems can be pretty straight-
forward, such as simple 2-track recording freeware that you install on your
home computer using a stock sound card. Or, you can go for a sophisticated
system, like built-from-the-ground-up computers optimized to do one thing
and one thing only: record, mix, and play back audio. (Okay, that’s three
things, but you get my point.)
To set up a computer-based DAW, you need the following things:
 A computer (preferably with a speedy processor)
 A bunch of memory and dual hard drives
 A sound card
 An audio interface (the interface between the computer and the outside
world, usually housing the converters and sometimes the preamps)
 The software
24
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Finding the right computer setup
No matter which computer platform you choose (see the sidebar “Mac or
PC?”), the stuff that you find inside your computer plays a major role in
determining how smoothly (or how less-than-smoothly) your Digital Audio
Workstation runs. The following list clues you in on the various pieces of
hardware that you find in your computer:
 CPU: The CPU (processor) is the heart of your computer studio. The
speed of your CPU ultimately dictates how well a program runs on it. As
a general rule, for audio, get the fastest processor that you can afford.
For most audio software, you need at least a Pentium IV for the PC or a
G4 for the Mac. If you can, get a computer that you can dedicate for
recording audio only because running other types of applications (home
finance software, word processors, or video games) can cause problems
with your audio applications and reduce the stability of your system.
 Memory: Computer-based audio programs and all the associated plug-
ins are RAM (random-access memory) hogs. Here’s my advice: Get a lot
of RAM. Okay, that’s not very specific, but how much you really need
depends on your recording style. If you record a lot of audio tracks and
want reverb or some effect on each track, you need more RAM (and a
faster processor). If you record mainly MIDI tracks with instruments that
already have the effects that you want, you can get by with less RAM
(and a slower processor).
25
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Mac or PC?
Whether to buy a Mac or PC is a hotly debated
topic among home recordists. Most profes-
sional studios used to favor Macintosh comput-
ers for recording audio. PCs were thought to
have too many bugs to work well for audio. Even
if this were true in the past, it’s not true any-
more. Your decision between a Mac- or PC-
based recording system should be based more
on your personal preferences in computer plat-
forms and the particular software that you
intend to use than which one is more stable.
Either platform may or may not be stable,
depending on what you’re trying to do.
Choose the software that you want to use, and
buy the computer that has the best track record
for running that software. Most software was
originally developed on either a Mac or PC;
accordingly, such software generally runs
better on that platform. Pro Tools, for instance,
was developed and written for the Mac. Pro
Tools Free for PC software is just not as good —
yet. In time, it most likely will be. But unless you
want to be an unpaid test subject for a piece of
software, your best bet is to research the soft-
ware and decide whether you can deal with any
complications that may arise from using it.
If you already have a computer or if you prefer
one platform over another (PC or Mac), be sure
to determine how well a program works on that
platform before you buy it.

For most software programs, the recommended minimum amount of
RAM is 256MB (256 megabytes), although most programs run much
more smoothly with 512MB or more. RAM is relatively inexpensive, so
get as much as you can.
Regardless of the platform that you choose (PC or Mac), keep in mind
that you can never have a processor that’s too fast or have too much
memory.
 Hard drives: To record audio, make sure that you get the right type of
hard drives. Notice that I said hard drives (plural). Yep, you should get
more than one if you want to record more than a few tracks of audio.
You need one hard drive for all the software and the operating system
and another drive for the audio data. Having this setup greatly increases
the likelihood that your system remains stable and doesn’t crash, espe-
cially if you try to run 16 or more tracks.
As for the size of the hard drive, bigger is better, at least in the drive
where you store your music. For the core system drive, you can get by
with a 10GB (10-gigabyte) drive; for the audio drive, having even 20GB 
is pretty conservative because audio data can take up a ton of space.
For example, a 5-minute song with 16 tracks recorded at 24 bits and a
44.1-kHz sample rate takes up about 600MB of hard-drive space (that’s
about 7.5MB per track minute).
Choose your hard drives wisely. For the software hard drive, you can get
by with a stock drive (usually the one that comes with your computer).
But for the audio side, you need a drive that can handle the demands 
of transferring audio data. Here are the main things to look for in an
audio drive:
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at
which the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200-rpm drive
works well for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time that it takes the drive to find
the data that’s stored on it. You want an average seek time of less
than 10 milliseconds.
• Buffer size: Often called a cache buffer, buffers are memory units
that store data as it’s being transferred. According to the audio-
recording software manufacturers, you need a buffer size of at
least 512K (512 kilobytes), but I recommend that you get a drive
with at least a 2MB buffer.
The track count that you get out of your system is directly related to the
speed of your hard drive — the faster the drive, the more tracks you can
record and play back at once. (Of course, the type of drive you get deter-
mines how large a role your processor plays.) My current choice is a Maxtor
7200-rpm ATA IDE hard drive with an 8.5-ms seek time and a 2MB cache
buffer. A 120GB drive currently costs about $120.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Getting the sound in and out
After you have a computer with enough speed and muscle (see the previous
section in this chapter), you need the appropriate hardware to get the sound
into and out of it. This requires a device called an audio interface. Audio inter-
faces are available with three types of connection methods: PCI, FireWire, and
USB. Here’s a quick rundown on the three types (the details are spelled out in
the following sections):
 PCI: PCI interfaces are inserted into one of the PCI slots located inside
your computer’s case.
 FireWire: FireWire interfaces connect to one of the FireWire ports in
your computer.
 USB: USB interfaces connect to your computer — you guessed it —
through one of the USB ports in your computer.
PCI interfaces
PCI is the old standard for getting audio into and out of a computer and has
an advantage over the other interface types because of the fast transfer
speed of PCI technology. This type of interface isn’t without its problems,
which are as follows:
 Many computers (for example, laptops and all Macs except the Power
Mac) don’t have a PCI slot.
 Because PCI technology is changing, all cards don’t fit in all computers,
so make sure that the PCI interface that you’re considering can fit into
your computer.
The advantage of PCI interfaces is that the PCI (the river in which the data
flows) is the fastest of the currently available ways to get audio into and out
of your computer. This means that less delay (called latency) occurs between
the origin of the sound (when you hit a drum, for example) and the time that
the sound gets into the computer and then back out to your monitors. This is
why many pros still prefer PCI to FireWire or USB interfaces.
This doesn’t mean that the delay you can get with FireWire or USB has to be
noticeable or can’t be dealt with. I discuss how to deal with it in the next two
sections of this chapter. The latency issue, therefore, isn’t the reason to go
with PCI. Your decision is going to come down to what interface you like.
PCI interfaces come in the following varieties:
 Separate sound card with no analog inputs and outputs: In this case, you
need to buy separate preamps, direct boxes, and AD (analog-to-digital)
and DA (digital-to-analog) converters. For most home recordists, the
27
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

separate-sound-card route isn’t the best solution. In fact, even for the
pros, this isn’t the most popular choice — so much so that this option is
quickly falling from the marketplace. Figure 2-1 shows examples of PCI
sound cards.
 Analog inputs and outputs within the card: Having the analog connec-
tion located in the card used to cause interference with the other com-
ponents in the computer’s housing (such as fans and hard drives),
which caused low-level hums in the recorded audio. (Not a sound you
would want, I can assure you.) This is generally no longer the case
unless you buy a really inexpensive card, but the bad rap led buyers to
shy away from this approach and it has become uncommon as a result.
You can find some less expensive audio interfaces configured this way,
but the higher end of the market has generally abandoned it. Figure 2-2
shows an example of a PCI card with analog connections.
 Analog inputs and outputs housed in a separate box: This box is called
a breakout box. Because of the low-level hum problems in the early inter-
faces, most manufacturers of PCI-based audio interfaces put their analog
circuitry in a separate box with a cord attached to the PCI card. One
advantage to this — besides eliminating the hum in early models — is
that you can tweak the input and output levels without having to use a
software menu. The dials for the levels are placed on the breakout box
within easy reach, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

If you have a laptop computer but can’t use a PCI-based system and you want
the high transfer speed of PCI, you can buy an audio-interface card that uses
the laptop’s PCMCIA card slot. Of course, this only works if you have a laptop
that’s equipped with a PCMCIA slot.

Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

If you want to go the PCI route, make sure that your computer has PCI slots
that are compatible with the PCI interface that you’re considering. For exam-
ple, the Digidesign 001 doesn’t work with the PCI slots that you find in the
Mac G5 computers.
Quite a few PCI-based audio interfaces are available, and they cost from a
couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.
FireWire interfaces
FireWire interfaces connect to the FireWire port in your computer. (Figure 2-4
shows a typical FireWire interface.) FireWire ports are inexpensive and are
available on laptop computers as well as desktops, which makes FireWire
interfaces more versatile than PCI-based systems. For example, you can
easily move the interface from computer to computer. If you have a laptop
and a desktop computer, using a FireWire interface allows you to switch
between the two computers by simply moving the FireWire cable from one
computer to the other. If you want to do some location recording, this is a 
big plus because you can take your interface and laptop to a great recording
room, record the drums, for example, and then bring the audio back home for
mixing and editing in your studio.
Even though PCI-based systems have a faster pathway for sending and receiv-
ing audio data, FireWire is fast enough for most users. With FireWire, the
latency that you can expect is only marginally more than what you would 
get with PCI-based systems.
FireWire interfaces generally come with eight to ten inputs and outputs and
cost from about $500 to $1,500.
When using a FireWire interface — and if you want a lot of inputs and/or out-
puts — a problem can arise if you also have a FireWire hard drive to which
you want to record audio. Basically, having the FireWire interface and the
FireWire hard drive on the same FireWire bus is asking for trouble, because
Figure 2-4:
A FireWire
interface
connects to
the FireWire
port in your
computer.
30
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

you’re sure to reach the data-transfer limit of FireWire. So make sure that the
two FireWire devices are on different buses (data channels).
USB interfaces
USB interfaces (see Figure 2-5) are handy because most computers have at
least one USB port. These interfaces also represent a low-cost solution for
people who need only a couple of inputs and outputs. The only problem with
USB for recording audio is the relatively slow transfer speed. This slower
speed translates into higher latencies than those found with either FireWire
or PCI interfaces. The latency is significant enough that you’re likely to hear it
when you record.
To get around this deficit, most USB-interface manufacturers have incorpo-
rated some sort of “no latency” monitoring option. With such an option, you
can record without hearing a delay between the tracks that you’ve already
recorded and the one you’re currently recording. The problem is that with
such an option, your newly recorded track gets placed out of synch with the
previously recorded tracks. To correct the synchronization, you must move
your overdubbed tracks within your song file. Admittedly, this process is pretty
easy, but it takes time. (I explain how to correct synchronization in detail 
in Chapter 11.) If you don’t want to deal with the latency in USB interface–
based systems, you should use a PCI, FireWire, or USB 2.0 interface.
Figure 2-5:
A USB
interface
connects 
to your

31
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

At the time of this writing, USB 2.0 interfaces are just becoming available. USB
2.0 features a much faster transfer speed than the original USB standard, so
the latency issue is, well, a nonissue.
USB interfaces can be found for under $200, and USB 2.0 interfaces currently
cost about $700.
Choosing the right software
When setting up a recording system, I always recommend that you start by
exploring the software that you want to use. Whatever program you decide
on will work better on one type of computer compared to another. By choos-
ing the software first, you can use the software manufacturer’s guidelines to
help you set up your computer. Most software is written for either a Mac or a
PC and will have been tested with a variety of hardware configurations.
Unless you’re very computer savvy, I recommend starting with a system
that’s been tested to run smoothly with the program that you’re interested in.
For the most part, audio-production software falls into the following two 
categories:
 Audio-recording programs: These programs allow you to record numer-
ous tracks (the number depends on the program) and let you edit,
equalize, and mix those tracks as well as add effects.
 MIDI-sequencing programs: These programs allow you to record MIDI
performance data (without the sounds) and edit and mix the data. The
difference between audio and MIDI recording is covered in detail in
Chapter 5.
Many entry-level programs allow you to either record audio or do MIDI
sequencing, but not both. Higher-end programs offer both audio and MIDI
recording and generally do a good job of both (and they’re getting better all
the time). Choose the program based on its features and whether it fits with
your working style.
Researching a program you’re interested in
If you already own a computer and you want to get some audio recording or
sequencing software to go with it, do the following research on the software
you’re interested in:
 Find out the product’s compatibility with your system: Visit the soft-
ware manufacturer’s Web site for information about whether your
system will work with that program as well as what additional hardware
you may need to get the software up and running.
32
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

 Find out what other users are saying: On the Internet, you can find an
online discussion board for each of the major audio-recording software
programs. Before you buy a program, go to the sites of the choices that
interest you and see what people are saying about the program. Ask
questions and explore the issues that other people are having with the
program. Doing so can save you lots of time dealing with bugs in your
system and allow you to record a lot more music. You can find these
sites by using the product name as the keyword in your favorite search
engine or by checking out the Internet forums that I list in Chapter 18.
One great way to see whether a particular program is right for you is to
find out what people who play your type of music are using. For instance,
a lot of people who compose with synthesizers and MIDI use Logic Audio
because using MIDI and software synthesizers is quick and easy in this
program. It also keeps them from needing a bunch of hardware synthe-
sizers to get the sounds they want, which saves space in their studio
and money in being able to bypass the hardware to get their synthesizer
sounds.
Checking out some popular programs
You can choose from numerous music-production software programs, includ-
ing the ones in the following list:
 Apple (www.apple.com): Makes Logic Pro Audio and Logic Express.
These programs run on both PC and Mac systems. Logic Pro Audio has
been around for a while and is one of the top programs available. The
downside is that it’s for Macs only. Like all the programs, Logic has its
way of working — some people like it while others have a hard time
grasping the way the user interface functions. (I love it.)
 Cakewalk (www.cakewalk.com): Makes SONAR, SONAR XL, and Metro 5,
among other programs. These are designed to run on a PC. SONAR is a
redesigned version of Cakewalk Pro Audio (some would say a completely
new program). SONAR does a great job of recording (and editing and
mixing) both audio and MIDI.
 Digidesign (www.digidesign.com): Makes Pro Tools and Pro Tools LE.
These programs work on both Mac and PC systems. Digidesign’s Pro
Tools Mix systems (the company offers several versions) are arguably
the standard for digital audio in pro studios, although more pro studios
are using any one (or more) of the other programs that I list in this sec-
tion. Pro Tools is great for recording and editing audio tracks but has
been a little behind the rest of the programs for MIDI. If MIDI is impor-
tant to you, you may want to wait for future upgrades or try a different
program.
33
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

 Mark of the Unicorn (www.motu.com): Makes Digital Performer. This
program requires a Mac to run. Digital Performer is a powerful program
that does MIDI and audio equally well. One advantage of this program is
that MOTU makes very good audio interfaces that are designed to work
well with its software. You end up with a better chance of having a
system that is stable.
 Sony Media Software (mediasoftware.sonypictures.com): Makes
Sound Forge, Vegas Audio, and Acid. These programs only run on
Windows (PCs). Acid is a very popular program that is strong in loop-
based recording. As a result, a lot of hip-hop and techno artists use this
program.
 Steinberg (www.steinberg.net): Makes Nuendo, Cubase, WaveLab, and
Cubasis. These programs run on both Mac and PC platforms. Nuendo is
Steinberg’s best program, and it is excellent for recording audio.
(Nuendo is one of the best-sounding programs available; it is made to
compete with Pro-Tool’s top-of-the-line offering.) It’s not very strong in
MIDI sequencing, though, so if this feature is important to you, this may
not be the best program to use. In that case, if you like the Steinberg
line, you may want to try Cubase, which is a great program that’s on par
with SONAR, Logic, and the others and is stronger in MIDI sequencing
than Nuendo.
Most of these manufacturers offer program demos that you can download for
free to see whether you like them. These demos work just like the full ver-
sions except that you generally can’t save or print your work.
Some of these manufacturers also make audio-interface/sound-card hardware
optimized for their systems; this hardware can generally work on other sys-
tems (check with the manufacturer to make sure). You may find an easy and
great-sounding solution by choosing a software and hardware setup from a
single manufacturer. If you do, you are likely to have fewer compatibility
problems.
Studio-in-a-Box Systems
Integrated mixers/recorders/effects processors have become quite common.
Cassette port-a-studios, first introduced in the 1970s, enabled the home
recordist to compose music at home without spending a fortune on equipment.
But it wasn’t until the Roland VS-880 came out in 1997 that great-quality record-
ings could be made at home using a single piece of equipment. Okay, you still
needed an instrument and microphone to plug into it, but everything else fit
into this one little box, which is now referred to as a studio-in-a-box system.

Taking a look at the benefits
One of the biggest advantages of using a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system is that
you don’t need to be computer literate — just turn it on and start to record.
SIAB systems are also portable — you can take them almost anywhere to
record, so you’re not limited to just your studio room. (You can get a view of
an SIAB system in Figure 2-6.) Think about this for a second: If you want a big
drum sound and all you have is a small converted bedroom for a studio, you
can load up your SIAB system, a few microphones, and your drummer’s drum
set (don’t forget the drummer) and go to an empty warehouse, gymnasium,
church, or anywhere you want. In fact, if you’re inventive, you don’t even need
to have electricity to do this. Most of these recorders draw very little power
and can be hooked up to a solar panel or battery. (You have to figure out how
to do this, but a quick search on the Internet should give you some ideas.)
I love these SIAB contraptions. The only real drawback is expandability,
although this is changing. Early versions of SIAB systems were somewhat lim-
ited in what they offered and weren’t very friendly when it came to adding
more effects (although they’re easy to synch). The new generation of SIAB

35
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

systems is being designed to accept third-party effects — for example, the
Yamaha AW machines accept an effect card made by Waves — and other
options, such as additional input and output cards — again available on the
Yamaha SIAB systems. They can also save audio files in formats that you can
open on other manufacturers’ recorders, freeing you to transfer files between
different systems.
Examining some popular SIAB systems
Many of the major recording manufacturers make SIAB systems. Check out
these companies and compare the specifications of each unit:
 Akai (www.akaipro.com): Akai was one of the original makers of stand-
alone hard-drive recorders. (The DR-4, DR-8, and DR-16 were excellent
machines.) Akai has dropped the stand-alone line and is focusing on an
SIAB system called the DPS-24. This is a high-end 24-track unit with 24-
bit recording at a variety of sample rates, motorized faders, and internal
expansion slots for future upgrades and third-party products.
 Boss (www.bossus.com): Boss is the entry-level line made by Roland
(read more about Roland later in this section). Boss makes several basic
all-in-one recorders, such as the 8-track BR864 or the 16-track BR1600,
which are inexpensive and easy to use. These units record in 16 bits at a
44.1-kHz sample rate.
 Fostex (www.fostex.com): Fostex has been in the hard-drive recording
business for a while — although not as long as Akai — and Fostex has
released several SIAB devices in the last few years. Currently, its top-of-
the-line SIAB system is the VF-160 16-track recorder. The Fostex units
have a lot of features, but they are limited to recording at 16 bits — a
real drawback for serious recording. Still, for their prices, these units are
a good value.
 Korg (www.korg.com): Korg has quite a few recorders, from basic units
such as the D-1200 12-track unit to the full-featured D32XD 32-track
recorder. The Korg units sound good — they all record in 24 bits — and
are easy to use.
 Roland (www.rolandus.com): Roland defined the SIAB recorder with its
VS-880 in 1997. The company currently offers several SIAB systems,
including the new flagship VS-2480 24-track recorder. Roland has the
largest user base of all the SIAB systems, so if user support is important
to you, you can’t go wrong with one of Roland’s machines. These units
record at 24 bits but use a compression scheme that reduces the file sizes.
 TASCAM (www.tascam.com): TASCAM has been in the home recording
market for a long time, first with cassette port-a-studios and now with
digital systems. You can find two units — the DP-01FX 8-track recorder,
36
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

which records at 16 bits, and the 2488 24-track recorder, which records
in 24 bits.
 Yamaha (www.yamaha.com): Yamaha currently has two SIAB systems:
the AW4416 and the AW2816. Both are 16-track recorders that have
excellent sound quality. The AW4416 has a 44-channel mixer, motorized
faders, and two expansion slots for expandability, while the AW2816 has
a 28-channel mixer and only one expansion slot. Yamaha is the first SIAB
system manufacturer to develop a third-party card for its expansion slots.
The AW4416 records in 24 bits, whereas the AW2816 records in 16 bits.
Stand-alone Recorders
The first affordable stand-alone digital recorder to hit the market was the
Alesis ADAT (which stands for Alesis Digital Audio Tape) in 1992. This
machine revolutionized home recording, making it possible for the home
recordist to make some pretty high-quality recordings without having to
spend a fortune. Many commercial studios used ADATs as well. In fact, a lot
of hit records from the last decade were recorded on ADATs. The ADAT uses
digital tape cartridges, which look much like VHS videotapes, and they func-
tion much like analog tapes. And like analog tapes, the digital tape cartridges
have limited editing capabilities. (For more details on editing, see Chapter 13.)
Stand-alone digital recorders are the least common type of home studio
recorder because they require a separate mixer and other outboard gear,
such as external effects units or preamps. This makes the cost of this type of
system higher than a comparable number of tracks that you get in a studio-
in-a-box or computer-based system. The advantage is that you can swap out
these recorders as newer models come out without having to update your
whole system. This is one reason why stand-alone recorders are so popular
in commercial studios. Figure 2-7 shows a typical stand-alone recorder.

37
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

The following major manufacturers produce stand-alone hard-drive
recorders:
 Alesis (www.alesis.com): Alesis makes the 24-track HD24 hard-drive
recorder. This unit is the company’s follow-up to the hugely popular
ADAT recorders of the nineties.
 Mackie (www.mackie.com): Mackie makes the HDR-2496 and MDR-2496
recorders. They are both 24-track machines, but the HDR has many
more editing capabilities and an output for a video monitor. (This makes
editing much easier.)
These stand-alone units cost from about $1,500 to $2,000 or more dollars. You
also have to buy other necessary gear, such as mixers, and signal processors,
separately, which raises the overall cost of these systems considerably.
Because these companies’ product offerings are constantly changing, your
best bet is to check out each of these manufacturers’ Web sites and compare
their specifications with one another. The next step would be to try a demo
of each product that has the features that you want to see whether you like
the way that they sound. Also, be sure to check out the compatibility of the
system with other systems, if that’s important to you.
Analyzing Analog
Analog recording has definitely taken a backseat to digital. This is mainly a
bang-for-the-buck thing. For just slightly more money than you would pay for
a cassette 4-track recorder, you can get a digital 4-track unit that produces a
far superior sound. And for a lot less than the cost of a full-blown pro analog
setup, you can achieve the same-quality product using a digital system. (Of
course, you still need great songs, top-notch engineering skills, and pricey
outboard gear.) In spite of this, you may as well know what your options are
for analog recording.
Cassette port-a-studio
For the budding songwriter who is just starting out, a 4-track cassette port-a-
studio can be a good choice: You don’t need to be technologically proficient
to use one. For little money, you can be laying down tracks and putting your
ideas onto tape — you can find a basic 4-track for about $100. Another bene-
fit of the cassette 4-track units is that they provide a great introduction to the
world of multitrack recording without having to invest a lot of time or money.
If you use one of these and find that you like the process of creating your own
music, you can easily move on to another system.
38
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Open-reel multitracks
The standard for multitrack recording 20 years ago was the open-reel (reel-
to-reel) tape deck. These recorders came in 4-, 8-, 16-, and 24-track configura-
tions. They produced varying levels of sound quality, depending on the width
of the tape. Semipro recorders used narrower tape (half-inch and 1-inch for
16 tracks), which have more background noise such as hiss, whereas pro
recorders used a wider 2-inch tape that, in the hands of a good engineer, cre-
ated a world-class sound.
The semipro reel-to-reel multitrack recorders have mostly been superseded
by digital hard-drive recorders because the digital recorder is less expensive
and better sounding. The wide-format (2-inch) reel-to-reel recorders, on the
other hand, are still in use in many top-notch commercial studios. In fact,
many great albums are still being recorded using these systems. The down-
side to the wide-format-tape multitrack units is that they’re prohibitively
expensive to buy and maintain for the home recordist.
39
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Oh, how I yearn for that analog sound
An interesting trend in digital recording is the
quest for analog sound. In the marketplace, you
find new pieces of gear being marketed as
having warmth or a vintage sound. What exactly
is this sound?
This sound is . . . (wait for it) . . . distortion. Yep,
good ol’ noise and distortion. Why would some-
one want to duplicate that now?
When the mild distortion that’s inherent in good
analog recordings was eliminated in digital
recordings, we missed it (sigh). In analog
recording, you find a technique that’s used to
add something wonderful and beautifully pleas-
ing to a recording: tape saturation. This is
caused by recording the sound onto a tape
recorder at a high enough level that the tape
becomes saturated (hence the term tape satu-
ration), and certain aspects of the sound
change.
For the most part, tape saturation adds even
harmonics to the sound. Not to get too techni-
cal, but these are the tones present in the music
but, for the most part, hidden behind the main
tone. Tape saturation brings those tones out just
a little, and we find them pleasing to listen to.
Tape saturation also mellows out the high fre-
quencies by smearing them together a little.
Without this sound, many listeners (certainly not
all) find digital recordings somewhat harsh or
cold. In case you didn’t know, these are highly
technical terms meaning, “I don’t hear that thing
I’m used to hearing in an analog recording.”
Digital recording can’t duplicate this sound. In
fact, if you try to use the tape-saturation tech-
nique with a digital recorder (by overriding the
input levels), all you get is more harshness and
a horrible clipping sound. (The sound is clipped
off by the digital converters, and you hear
crackles and clicks.)

If you’re in the market for a used narrow-format multitrack recorder because
you just gotta have analog (see the sidebar “Oh, how I yearn for that analog
sound”), know that you not only need to be proficient in good engineering
practices, but you also need to be able to maintain the recorder — align and
clean the heads, for instance, and perform other housecleaning chores. If you
can’t do this yourself, you need to have the bucks to hire someone to do it
for you. Also, finding analog tape is getting more difficult. In fact, anything
but 1⁄4-inch, 1⁄2-inch (both for mastering decks) and 2-inch tapes are nearly
impossible to find new, and even these sizes (1⁄4-inch, 1⁄2-inch, and 2-inch) are
getting hard to find.
Analog goodies
So you find that you gotta have that analog sound, too, but you don’t want to
(or can’t) deal with the expense of a complete analog system. Well, you’re in
luck! Do I have a deal for you! You, too, can add some of the warmth to your
digital recordings if you’re willing to shell out the green. Yep, come on down
and I’ll set you up!
Seriously, you can buy some analog extras to help you add a little of that
analog distortion to your music. Don’t get me wrong; many of these products
are great and have a place in a home studio. Just don’t get so hooked by the
need to have warmth in your recordings that you go out and buy everything
that you can to add mild distortion. This warmth is just distortion, after all.
Most of the time people use tube gear on their instruments to get them to
sound warmer. (Sounds like California surfer lingo, dude.) In sound recording,
tube gear refers to components that still use the ancient technology of vacuum
tubes to get them up and running — and up and running with all that distor-
tion that some listeners describe as warm. Tube microphones, preamps, com-
pressors, and equalizers are only a few of the types of products available to
add some semblance of the much-sought-after analog sound.
If you want to go tubeless, look for special tape-saturation emulators on the
market to give you that analog edge. See the section “Tape-saturation emula-
tors,” later in this chapter, for more info.
The tube stuff
Vacuum-tube microphones, preamps, compressors, and equalizers have been
around for decades. In fact, before solid-state (transistor) technology was
developed, everything electronic had vacuum tubes in it — both good-quality
and bad-quality audio gear. Vacuum-tube equipment definitely had a sound to
it, and tube technology definitely had its limitations — the main one being
the coloration that was added to the music. This coloration is highly sought
after in today’s world of digital recording (see the sidebar “Oh, how I yearn
for that analog sound”), so the tube stuff has become increasingly popular.
40
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

To get the pleasing analog distortion that’s so popular today, you don’t need
to buy gear with vacuum-tube circuitry. Some top-quality solid-state gear can
get you the same sound as the vintage tube stuff. In fact, some of the most
sought-after vintage preamps, equalizers, and compressors — particularly
those bearing the “Neve” name — are solid state, and they still have a beauti-
fully colored (distorted) sound. So, when you go in search of the tube sound
for your studio, remember that you can get the sound you’re after without
having to buy actual vacuum-tube gear.
Not all “tube” gear produces a pleasing sound. Sometimes the distortion that
a piece of gear adds to your music creates more noise and mud (lack of clar-
ity in the sound) than it adds warmth. Be sure to listen to the equipment that
you’re interested in before you buy it. Make your purchase decision based on
how you like the way the equipment sounds for your particular music. Do
your homework before adding any tube gear — or any new equipment that
you spend your hard-earned money on. Read reviews and specifications, talk
to people, and above all, listen to the equipment before you buy.
Many audio-recording retailers allow you a certain amount of time after you
buy a piece of equipment to return it if you don’t like it. Of course, you have
to pay for it before you leave the store, but you usually get some time in
which you can return it. Ask your music retailer to be sure of its return policy
before you buy.
Tape-saturation emulators
The new great thing in audio recording is the analog tape emulator, also known
as a tape-saturation emulator. These are designed to add the characteristics
that you get from recording high levels onto tape, such as the mild distortion
that analog aficionados love (see the sidebar “Oh, how I yearn for that analog
sound”). You can find both stand-alone analog emulators and plug-ins for
your computer-based system. These can be expensive (over $2,000 in some
cases), but many pros swear by them. As I write this book, this technology is
in its infancy, so expect the prices to drop dramatically and the choices to
expand exponentially over the next few years.
Since the first edition of this book was published a few years ago, one really
decent tape-saturation plug-in for computer-based systems has appeared.
This emulator, called the Vintage Warmer (www.pspaudioware.com), can add
some pleasing distortion to your tracks for about $150. If you use it, be care-
ful not to overdo it. It is easy to use too much saturation and ruin an other-
wise good track.
Reality check
Do you need any tube or analog emulator gear in your studio? The short
answer is: No, you don’t. You can make great recordings without any of 
this stuff. All you need is an instrument, a microphone, a mixer, a recorder,
and some monitors — oh, and some good, solid engineering skills.
41
Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

What really counts is your music. People who listen to music don’t care
whether you use (insert gotta-have gear here) to record your masterpiece. 
All they care about is whether they like the music. So don’t make yourself
nuts (or go broke) over any of this stuff.
Exploring Sample Setups
In this section, I help you get some ideas about the best system configuration
for your needs. Whether you’re an electronic musician who only needs a
sequencer, some MIDI instruments, and a 2-track recorder or you’re a purist
who wants 16 tracks of simultaneous recording and needs dozens of micro-
phones to record your whole band live, I help you figure it out in this section.
Because I don’t know what type of recording you want to do, I outline three
basic systems to give you an idea of what may work for you. You can see a
system that works well for both live recording and MIDI sequencing, a system
for MIDI sequencing and the occasional instrument or vocal overdub, and a
live rig that contains little or no MIDI instrumentation. This is only a starting
point, but as you shop around for a system, you’ll be able to find a setup that
best meets your needs.
You can configure your home recording system in almost unlimited ways. Part
of what will influence your decisions is your initial budget and how you like to
work. Look around and talk to other people who have a home studio. Join an
Internet forum and discover the different ways that people are recording —
find out what works for them and what doesn’t. (Check out Chapter 18 for
some great resources on the Internet.) Then jump in and don’t look back. The
most important component in your studio is you!
Live and MIDI studio
The live and MIDI studio is your best choice if you want to incorporate both
MIDI-sequenced parts and live instruments (such as guitar, electric bass, and
drums). For this type of system, you need a recorder, a mixer, and a MIDI con-
troller. You also need a few microphones and any instruments that you plan
to record — generally at least one synthesizer or sound module, an electric
guitar and bass, and a drum machine or real drum set. Figure 2-8 illustrates a
setup that’s centered around an SIAB recorder with a computer for sequenc-
ing. Of course, you could use a stand-alone recorder instead (you need a sep-
arate mixer), or you could incorporate the whole system into a computer if
you choose.
You want a system with a fair amount of tracks (at least 8) that allows you to
record at least 2 tracks of MIDI instruments as well as several tracks of guitar,
bass, drums, and vocals.
42
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

MIDI-intensive studio
Are you a one-man band? Do you prefer to program a performance rather
than to play it? If so, you may want to have a MIDI-intensive studio. The
advantage of the MIDI studio is that one person can “play” many instruments

Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

at the same time. A disadvantage is that the music can sound somewhat stiff.
(See Chapter 12 for advice on how to overcome this.) And you may lose
touch with what it feels like to play with other musicians, which is not always
a bad thing, especially if you’re into that whole reclusive artist thing.
Because MIDI instruments can be programmed to play the part perfectly, with
all the dynamic variations that you want, you can spend your time working
on the parts (composing, setting levels, and creating effects) without actually
having to record them. As a result, you can get by with fewer audio tracks in
your system, but you need to have more MIDI tracks available. An advantage
to this approach is that MIDI tracks take less CPU power and RAM to run
compared to the same number of audio tracks. So, you can get by with a less
expensive computer (or use the one you already have) and save your bucks
for more synthesizers or plug-ins.
For a MIDI-intensive studio, such as the one shown in Figure 2-9, you need a
sequencer (a device that allows you to record and play back MIDI perfor-
mance information) and at least one sound source. This could be a keyboard
synthesizer, sound module, sampler, or computer equipped with sounds,
called soft-synths. You also need a drum machine or drum sounds in your
computer if you intend to make any music other than ambient or classical-
type music. In addition, you need a MIDI controller to, well, control these
sound sources. This, too, could be part of the computer software, or it could
be the synthesizer. Check out Chapter 5 for more on MIDI controllers. If you
end up using a computer-based sequencer, you’ll also need a MIDI interface.
In addition to the MIDI stuff, you need some sort of recorder. Again, this
could be included in your computer setup. If you plan to sequence all the
parts and don’t want to include any vocals, you could get by with a decent 2-
track recorder. On the other hand, if you see yourself including vocals or any
non-MIDI instruments — such as an electric guitar, for example — you need a
microphone (for the vocals) and the ability to record more tracks.
Live studio
Thirty years ago, when a band wanted to record, the members all went into a
studio together, set up their gear in one large room (with maybe a few
dividers between them), and played as if they were at a concert. Then they
would overdub a guitar solo, backup vocals, and maybe a few percussion
instruments.
The beauty of this type of recording for a band is that you have a better
chance of capturing the magic of a live performance. The disadvantage is that
it takes a little more recording skill to get a good sound. (Of course, you dis-
cover many of these skills in this book.)
44
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

For the live studio, you need a recorder with at least as many available simul-
taneous tracks as you think you need for your band. Eight tracks are usually
enough for most bands. The tracks would break down as follows:
 Rhythm guitar: 1 track
 Bass guitar: 1 track
 Piano, organ, or synthesizer: 1 or 2 tracks

Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear

 Rough vocals: 1 track
You generally record this track over again after the rest are done to get 
a cleaner track.
 Drums: 2–4 tracks
The number of tracks varies depending on the type of sound that you
want. You may need a separate mixer to create a submix of the drums if
you’re only using 2 tracks. (For more on submixes, check out Chapter 14.)
Aside from the simultaneous track count, you probably want some extra
tracks available to record a guitar solo, some background vocals, and maybe
some percussion instruments. In this case, a 16-track recorder is a great solu-
tion. If you want more flexibility in getting your band’s sound, you could get a
recorder that can record as many as 16 simultaneous tracks.
Figure 2-10 shows a system that can work well for live recording. This setup
is illustrated using a stand-alone recorder. The reason for this is that most
stand-alone recorders can record all their available tracks simultaneously.
With this system, you need a separate mixer and all the cords to connect
them. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details on cords.)
If you’re one of those many people who like to record 1 or 2 tracks at a time
but still want to play all the instruments live (with no MIDI sequencing), your
need for lots of simultaneous tracks is reduced. An SIAB system is probably
your best solution because it costs less and takes up less space.
You could also use a computer-based system to record all the instruments
live. Just make sure that you have both the inputs and available tracks that
you need.
If you record all the instruments live (all at once or one at a time), you also
need to get enough microphones and mic stands. And you have to contend
with making your room conducive to recording live instruments (I discuss
this more in Chapter 3).
With the many ways to configure a home recording system, you’ll probably
lean more toward one type of system than another (computer-based, SIAB, or
stand-alone). Then it’s just a matter of weeding through the options until you
find one that resonates with you (and your budget).

 Getting to know the various types of connectors
 Plugging in your equipment
 Creating an efficient workstation
 Making your room sound great (or at least decent)
O
kay, so you’re ready to turn that spare bedroom or basement into a
recording studio. You need to unpack all your shiny new gear and get it
plugged in properly, and you need to get your room to work for you. This
involves creating an efficient place to work, but above all it means getting
your room to sound good. This can be tricky; after all, pro studios spend tons
of time and money getting their studios to sound great. You’re going to need
to do the same. You may not need to spend a ton of money (as if you could),
but you do need to spend some time.
After you decide on a space for your home recording system, the next steps
involve setting up the system and getting your space to work for you. In this
chapter, I help you make sense of all those analog or digital connectors and
help you get them all plugged in properly. You probably have experience with
analog connectors and cords, such as the ones on your stereo system. But
you may have never come in contact with digital connectors, unless you’ve
plugged a DVD player into your TV or had a chance to go into a recording
studio using digital gear.
This chapter also shows you how to find the best way for you to work in your
environment, with a fair measure of tips and tricks thrown in to make your
room sound as good as possible.

Understanding Analog Connections
You’ve probably had a chance to see and use a variety of analog connectors.
If you play a guitar or keyboard (synthesizer), for example, you’re familiar
with a 1⁄4-inch analog plug. Some microphones use an XLR analog plug.
Keeping all these connectors straight can be a little confusing: Why do you
have to use one plug for one thing and another for something else? And
what’s a TRS plug, anyway?
Read on to discover the most common analog connectors: 1⁄4-inch (mono/TS
and stereo/TRS), XLR, and RCA.
The 1⁄4-inch analog plug
The 1⁄4-inch plug is the most common audio connector and one of the most
versatile. These plugs come in two varieties: mono/TS and stereo/TRS.
Mono/TS
The plug on a cord that you use for your guitar or synthesizer is an example
of a mono 1⁄4-inch plug. The mono part of the name refers to the fact that you
have only one channel with which to send the signal. This type of plug is also
referred to as a TS plug (short for Tip/Sleeve). The tip is the end of the plug,
and the sleeve is the rest of the metal part. A plastic divider separates these
two sections. Check out Figure 3-1 to see this familiar plug.
TS plugs are used for a variety of purposes — to go from your guitar to your
guitar amp, from your synthesizer to your mixer, from your mixer to your
power amplifier (amp), and from your power amp to your speakers. You would
expect that one cord could work for all these applications. After all, a TS plug
is a TS plug, right? Well, not really. The same plug can be wired differently,
and it can carry different levels of power. For example, here are the differ-
ences between instrument and speaker cords:

 Instrument cord (the one you use for your synthesizer or guitar): This
cord contains one wire and a shield — the wire is connected to the tip,
and the shield is connected to the sleeve. You need the instrument
cable’s shield to minimize noise. If you use a speaker cord (discussed
next) for your instrument, you may end up with some noise (that is, you
may hear a hiss or a buzz — or even a radio station — coming out of
your amp or coming from where you’ve plugged in your instrument).
Instrument cords are often called unbalanced lines because of the way
that they’re wired. An unbalanced cord has one wire surrounded by a
braided shield; the wire is connected to the tip of the TS plug, and the
shield is connected to the sleeve. The signal is sent through the wire, and
the shield is used for the ground. (It keeps the noise down.) You can also
find balanced lines, which I explain in the next section of this chapter.
 A speaker cord: This cord contains two wires and no shield — one wire
is connected to the tip and the other to the sleeve. The speaker cord
carries a lot more current (power) than the instrument cable. This is the
reason that it doesn’t have a shield. The signal level covers noise that’s
present in the cord. Because you have much less current present in an
instrument, you don’t want to use a speaker cord for your instrument.
When buying cords with TS plugs, first be sure to look at (or ask about) what
purpose the cord is designed for. Then, when you get the cord home, be sure
to make a note of what type it is so that you use it correctly. You can mark
your cord in a number of ways: You can put colored tape on it (red for speaker
or blue for instrument, for example), put a tag on it, or — gasp — dot it with
nail polish.
You generally don’t need to worry about which end of the cord you plug into
your instrument — the signal can travel equally well in either direction.
However, you can buy cords that are designed to send the current in one
direction. (This cord has an arrow on it, designating in which direction the
signal should flow.) I call these designer cords, and two of the most common
brands are Monster and Planet Waves. The theory behind these cords is that
they do a better job of preserving the sound qualities of the instrument for
which they’re designed. These cords are specifically designed for almost
every instrument and application known to man.
Stereo/TRS
A stereo/TRS (short for Tip/Ring/Sleeve) 1⁄4-inch plug looks like a stereo head-
phone plug (take a look at Figure 3-2). The tip is the end of the plug, the ring
is the small middle section located between the two plastic dividers, and the
sleeve is the rest of the metal part of the plug. A TRS plug can be used for the
following three types of cords:
51
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

 Stereo cord: A stereo cord is used for signals that contain two separate
portions: one for the right channel and the other for the left channel.
This type of cord is generally wired with the left-channel signal attached
to the tip, the right-channel signal connected to the ring, and the shield
wired to the sleeve. This type of cord is typically used for headphones.
 Balanced cord: A balanced cord is used on professional audio gear to
join the various pieces of equipment (to connect the mixer to the
recorder, for example). The advantage with a balanced cord is that you
can have longer cord runs without creating noise.
Why are balanced cords so conveniently noise free? The balanced cord
has two wires and a shield inside and has the same signal running
through both wires. One signal is 180 degrees out of phase with the
other (that is, their waveforms are opposite one another), and when the
signals get to the mixer (or whatever they’re plugged into), one of the
signals is flipped and added to the other. When this happens, any noise
that built up in the signal is cancelled out.
 Y cord: A Y cord consists of a TRS plug on one end and two TS plugs on
the other, forming — you guessed it — a nice representation of the letter
Y. This cord allows you to insert an effect processor — a compressor or
equalizer, for example — in the line of a mixer (more specifically, into the
insert jack of the mixer). Check out Chapter 4 for details on mixers. The
TRS plug both sends and receives a signal. This cord is wired so that the
tip sends the signal and the ring receives it (see Figure 3-3). The sleeve is
connected to the shield of each cable.
XLR
The XLR connector is used for microphones and some line connections
between professional gear. This cable has a female and a male end (see 
Figure 3-4). The cord is wired much like a TRS connector and is balanced 
to minimize noise. The XLR microphone cable is also called a low Z cable
because it carries a low-impedance signal.

(TRS) plug

RCA
RCA plugs — named for good old RCA and also called phono plugs — are
common on home stereos and on some semipro audio gear (see Figure 3-5).
They function much like a TS plug but aren’t very common in professional
audio equipment. However, you find them on some mixers so that you can
connect a tape deck. They are also used for digital S/PDIF signals (see the
next section for more details on these babies).

Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

Delving into Digital Connections
If you’re going to record using a digital recorder or mixer, you’re going to run
into digital connectors (plugs and cables/cords). Digital audio equipment is a
recent invention, and as such, no one standard has emerged. Because of this
lack of standardization, a variety of digital connection methods are on the
market, only a few (or one) of which may be on the equipment that you own
or intend to purchase. Regardless, knowing about the most common types of
connectors and their purposes can help you decide what equipment is right
for you.
MIDI
MIDI, short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a handy communication
protocol that allows musical information to pass from one device to another.
To allow the free passage of such information, MIDI jacks are located on a
whole host of electronic instruments — synthesizers, drum machines, sound
modules, and even some guitars have MIDI jacks. And, to connect all these
instruments, you need some MIDI cables. The MIDI connector contains five
pins (male) that plug into the female MIDI jack (port) on the instrument or
device (see Figure 3-6).
AES/EBU
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcasting Union) cables are
much like S/PDIF cables (described in the next section). The AES/EBU standards
require these cables to transmit two channels of data at a time. They differ
from S/PDIF cables in that they consist of XLR plugs and use balanced cables.
(Figure 3-7 shows what the inputs look like on the recording equipment.)
Figure 3-5:
An RCA 
plug is used
mainly on
consumer
stereo and

audio
equipment.
54
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

AES/EBU was developed to be used with professional audio components; hence
the use of balanced cords — the kinds used in professional-level equipment.
S/PDIF
S/PDIF (short for Sony/Phillips Digital Interface Format) cables consist of an
unbalanced coaxial cable (one wire and a shield) and RCA plugs. (Figure 3-7
shows what the inputs look like on the machine.) These cables can also be
made from fiber-optic cable and a Toslink connector. The S/PDIF format can
transmit two channels of digital data at one time. S/PDIF protocols are similar
to AES/EBU standards, except S/PDIF was originally designed for the con-
sumer market — which explains why unbalanced cords are used. In spite of
being developed for the consumer market, S/PDIF connectors are found on a
lot of pro recording gear along with (or instead of) AES/EBU.

Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

If you want to use cords that are longer than 3–4 feet when using an S/PDIF
connector — or about 15 feet for AES/EBU connectors — your best bet is to
use video or digital audio cables. Regular audio cables degrade the sound at
longer distances because they can’t transmit the type of signal that digital
produces without affecting the quality of the sound. If you use audio cables
for longer distances, you lose some of the sound’s definition. Some people
describe this sound as “grainy.”
ADAT Lightpipe
The ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) Lightpipe format allows eight tracks 
of digital audio to be sent at once. Developed by Alesis, ADAT Lightpipe (or
simply Lightpipe for short) has become a standard among digital audio prod-
ucts. It consists of a fiber-optic cable that uses a special connector developed
by Alesis.
TDIF
TDIF (Teac Digital Interface Format) is Teac’s return volley to the ADAT
Lightpipe format. TDIF uses a standard computer cable with a 25-pin connec-
tor. Like the ADAT Lightpipe, TDIF cables can transmit eight channels of digi-
tal data at a time. TDIF isn’t nearly as common as ADAT Lightpipe because
Alesis made its Lightpipe technology available to other companies to use for
free. Alesis encouraged these companies to adopt it as a “standard” because
the Alesis ADAT recorders were so common.
USB
USB, which stands for Universal Serial Bus, is a common component in nearly
all modern computers. In fact, your computer probably has more than one
USB port. In case it’s been a while since you’ve had to use your USB connec-
tion, take a look at Figure 3-8. As you can see, USB has the following different
plugs that fit different jacks:
 Rectangular connector: This is called the “A” connector and is for any
receiving device, such as your PC or a USB hub.
 Square connector: Called the “B” connector, this is used for a sending
device, such as your USB audio interface or printer.
56
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Aside from having two different types of jacks and plugs, USB also has two
different standards, as follows:
 USB 1.1: This, the original, standard can handle a data rate of up to 12
Mbps (megabits per second).
 USB 2.0: This standard can handle 40 times the data flow of the earlier
standard — 480 Mbps.
Currently, USB interfaces primarily use the USB 1.1 standard and, because of the
relatively slow transfer speed, have limited input and output options. USB 2.0
has considerably faster transfer rates, so expect more audio interfaces to use
this approach in the future. (Chapter 2 has more details on audio interfaces.)
FireWire
Developed by Apple Computer, FireWire (also known as IEEE 1394 or iLink) is
a high-speed connection that is used by many audio interfaces, hard drives,
digital cameras, and other devices. Even though FireWire was developed by
Apple, you can find FireWire ports on devices from many manufacturers.
FireWire cables, unlike USB cables (see the preceding section), have the same
connector (see Figure 3-9) on both ends.
Figure 3-8:
USB uses
two types of
connectors:
the “A”
connector
(left) and 
the “B”
connector
(right).
57
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

Like USB, FireWire comes in two flavors, which are described as follows:
 FireWire 400: This standard supports data-transfer speeds of up to 400
Mbps. Many audio interfaces currently use FireWire 400 as a way to con-
nect with your computer. These interfaces can handle quite a few inputs
and outputs.
 FireWire 800: Yep, you guessed it — this standard can handle data-
transfer rates of 800 Mbps. You should see interfaces supported by
FireWire 800 in the not-too-distant future. (I admit that this isn’t exactly a
risky assumption.)
Sampling Some Studio Setups
Everyone’s studio setup is a little different. Because I can’t come into your
home to help you set yours up, in this section I show you some typical setups
that you can use to configure your system.
I outline these three systems in the sections that follow:
Figure 3-9:

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

 Audio with some MIDI: This system is designed to record audio tracks
and run MIDI tracks simultaneously using stand-alone components.
 MIDI-intensive setup: This setup relies heavily on MIDI, using a com-
puter to run audio and MIDI.
 Live audio: This setup optimizes live-instrument recording with no MIDI
devices, which consists of a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system.
Whenever you connect or disconnect cables within your system, make sure
that the power to the equipment is turned off or that the volume on the
device is turned all the way down.
Audio with some MIDI
The most common home studio setup includes one or two MIDI devices con-
nected to a digital recorder and one or two microphones plugged in to record
vocals or an instrument. Figure 3-10 shows this typical setup. Here, the guitar
and bass may be either miked from the amp or plugged directly into the
mixer using one of the following three techniques:
 Use a direct box, a device that changes the impedance level of your
guitar so that the mixer can process the signal.
 Plug your guitar into your amp and run a cord from the line output of
the amp to the mixer’s channel input.
 Use the Hi Z input of your mixer, if this input is available.
The setup in Figure 3-10 consists of a stand-alone recorder, a separate mixer,
and a computer running MIDI sequencing software. Here’s how you connect
the equipment in this scenario:
 Plug all your instruments into the channel inputs of the mixer. For
example, insert a TS plug into a 1⁄4-inch jack and an XLR plug into an 
XLR jack.
 To connect the synthesizer to the MIDI controller (computer), run 
a MIDI cable from the MIDI-output jack of the MIDI interface to the
MIDI-input jack of the synthesizer.
The connection between the MIDI interface and computer depends on
your MIDI interface. This connection is usually made using a USB port,
but you can find MIDI ports in many audio interfaces. In this case, the
connection type depends on the type of interface you use. Chapter 2 
has more details on audio interface connection types.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

 To connect the mixer to the recorder, run 1⁄4-inch line cords from the
direct-output jacks of the individual channels to the line (track)–input
jacks of the recorder.
Figure 3-10 shows only one cord running from the mixer to the recorder
(and one running from the recorder back to the mixer), but you can have
as many cords as you have direct-output jacks in your mixer or line-input
jacks in your recorder. For example, if you have an 8-track recorder, you
have cords running from channels 1–8 of your mixer into the track-input
jacks 1–8 of your recorder. Of course, if your system consists of a studio-
in-a-box or a computer-based system, you don’t need to run these cords
because the connections are made within the box (see the section “Live
audio,” later in this chapter).
 To monitor the tracks of the recorder, run cords from the individual
line-output jacks of the recorder back to the mixer. You would gener-
ally plug these cords into channel inputs 9–16. Again, if you have a
studio-in-a-box or a computer-based system, you don’t need to do this.
If you connect your recorder and mixer as I just outlined, you have chan-
nels 1–8 on your mixer controlling all the inputs and channels 9–16 con-
trolling the recorded tracks. If you don’t have that many channels in
your mixer, you need to jockey some cords around. The routing possibil-
ities are almost endless with a mixer. Check your owner’s manual for
some recommended setups and routing suggestions.
As an example, suppose that you have a 12-channel mixer and an 8-track
recorder. If you don’t intend to record more than 4 tracks at a time, you
can use tracks 1–4 for your channel inputs from your instruments and
tracks 5–12 for the track inputs from your recorder.
If you need more inputs and don’t want or need to listen to the tracks as
you record, you can allocate fewer channels for track monitoring and
more for instrument inputs.
 Run line cords from the main left and right output jacks of the mixer
to your power amp (or powered speakers).
 Run speaker cords from the power amp to the speakers. (You obvi-
ously don’t need these if you have powered speakers because the con-
nection is internally wired.)
MIDI-intensive setup
The MIDI-intensive setup has numerous MIDI devices hooked up to a mixer
and a microphone occasionally plugged in to record vocals. The system
shown in Figure 3-11 features a computer running audio and sequencing soft-
ware as well as an audio and MIDI interface. The mixer is housed within the
software program. All your instrument and microphone audio outputs are
plugged into the audio inputs of the interface, and the MIDI connections are
made using the MIDI input and output jacks.
61
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

The diagram shows both MIDI input and output connections on all the sound
modules and synthesizers. This allows two-way communication between the
MIDI controller (located in the computer) and the instruments, which gives
you more flexibility with sequencing.
Because all routing is done within the computer, you don’t need as many
cords as you would with a stand-alone system.

Live audio
If you intend to record a live band, you are likely to use this setup. The live
audio setup requires more microphone connections and rarely has MIDI
devices running into it. Figure 3-12 shows how you would make the connec-
tions for this type of application.

Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

The setup in Figure 3-12 consists of a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system (a Roland
VS-1880, for instance). Because all the routing takes place within the box,
your setup is simple. All your instruments and microphones plug directly into
the SIAB (most units even have one Hi-Z input for a guitar or bass). If you
want to plug both the electric guitar and bass in at the same time, you still
need one direct box or line output from your amp.
If you plan to use more than two microphones at once, make sure that you
have enough inputs because most SIAB systems only have two XLR jacks. If
you want to plug in more mics than you have XLR jacks, you have the follow-
ing options:
 Use a separate analog mixer for plugging in extra mics. Then run an
instrument cord from the channel output of the mixer to the channel’s
line input on your SIAB system.
 Use one or more external preamps to convert the low-impedance mic
cords to high-impedance TS cords. Just plug your mic into the preamp
and run an instrument cord from the preamp to the channel’s line input
of your SIAB system.
 Use line converters, such as a direct box or an adapter. Plug your mic
cord into the direct box or adapter and then plug into the channels’ line
input of your SIAB system’s mixer. (You can find an adapter at Radio
Shack for about $12 — part no. 910-0913.) This is the least expensive
option, but it costs you more in terms of sound quality — it doesn’t
sound as good as the previous two options.
All that’s left is to run line cords from the main outputs of your SIAB system
to the inputs of your powered speakers. In this case, you use 1⁄4-inch instru-
ment cords (T/S) rather than speaker cords because the input on your pow-
ered speakers is actually the input to the amplifier and not the speakers. The
connection from the amp to the speakers is made internally in the speaker
cabinets.
Working Efficiently
I hope that you’ll spend many hours in your studio creating some great music
(possibly to the dismay of the rest of your family). One important thing to
keep in mind is that you need to be comfortable. Get a good chair and set up
your workstation to be as easy to get around as possible. Figure 3-13 shows a
classic L setup. Notice how everything that you need is within arm’s reach. If
you have enough room, you may want to consider a U-shaped setup instead,
which is shown in Figure 3-14.
64
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

If you use a lot of outboard gear — such as preamps or effects processors —
and you think that you need to plug and unplug a lot, invest in a good patch
bay (see Figure 3-15) so that you don’t have to strain to get at the cords that
are tucked away behind your mixer. A patch bay is a device that has a bunch
of inputs and outputs in it that allows you to route your gear in (and out) in
an almost infinite variety of ways. If you’re going to do much plugging and
unplugging, you’ll quickly find out that a patch bay is an indispensable item.
It can save your back — and your cords (repeated plugging and unplugging
wears them out quickly and produces buzzes that can be hard to locate).

Taming heat and dust
The number one enemy of electronic equipment is heat. Dust is a close second.
Try to set up your studio in a room that you can keep cool and fairly dust
free. Air conditioning is a must for most studios. Be careful with a window air
conditioner, though, because it can make a lot of noise, requiring you to shut
it off when you record. Depending on where you live, this could quickly warm
your room. Regarding dust, try to cover your equipment when you’re not
using it, especially your microphones. A plastic bag placed over the top of a
mic on a stand works well.
You could also just put your mics away when you’re not using them. However,
if you use a particular mic a lot, you’re better off leaving it on a stand rather
than constantly handling it — some types of mics are pretty fragile. (You can
find more details on caring for your mics in Chapter 6.)
Monitoring your monitors
If you have a set of near-field monitors (speakers) — the kind that are
designed to be placed close to you — they should be set up so that they are
the same distance from each other and from you, forming an equilateral trian-
gle (see, high school math has some real-world applications). The monitors
should also be placed at about the height of your ears.
Figure 3-16 illustrates the best placement for your monitors. Placing your
monitors this way ensures that you hear the best possible sound from them
and that you can accurately hear the stereo field. (For more on the stereo
field, see Chapter 14.)
Optimizing Your Room
Your studio probably occupies a corner in your living room, a spare bed-
room, or a section of your basement or garage. All of these are less-than-ideal
recording environments. Even if you intend to record mostly by plugging
your instrument or sound module directly into the mixer, how your room
sounds has a big effect on how good your music turns out.
As a home recordist, you probably can’t create a top-notch sound room.
Professional studios spend serious cash — up to seven figures — to make
their rooms sound, well, professional. Fortunately, you don’t need to spend
near that much money to get great-sounding recordings. All it takes is a little
understanding of the way sound travels, some ingenuity, and a little bit of work.
67
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

Isolating sound
One of the concerns that you (and your neighbors) are probably going to
have when you start recording in your home is the amount of sound that gets
into and out of your room. Sound waves are nasty little buggers. They get
through almost any surface, and you can’t do a lot to stop that from happening.
You’ve probably noticed this phenomenon when somebody with a massive
subwoofer in his car drives by your house blasting some obnoxious music.
(Ever notice how someone else’s music is obnoxious whereas your music
never is, no matter how loud you play it?) Your windows rattle, your walls
shake, and your favorite mug flies off the shelf and breaks into a thousand
pieces. Well, this is one of the problems with sound.
The best (and classic) way to isolate your studio room from everything
around it is to build a room within a room. I don’t have the space to go into
detail here, but you can visit my Web site (www.jeffstrong.com) to find
some resources to get you started. If you don’t have the money or space to
build a room within a room, the best thing you can do is to try to understand
what noises are getting in and getting out and deal with those noises. For
example, if you live in a house or apartment with neighbors close by, don’t
record live drums at night. You could also consider using a drum machine or
electronic drum set instead.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

Another idea is to choose a room in your house or apartment that is the far-
thest away from outside noise (an interior room, for instance). Basements also
work well because they’re underground, and most of the sound gets absorbed
by the ground. Placing a little fiberglass bat insulation in the ceiling — the
typical house insulation that you can find at your local home center — can
isolate you pretty well from your neighbors. Detached garages are generally
farther away from other buildings, so sound has a chance to dissipate before
it reaches your neighbors (or before your neighbors’ noise reaches your
garage).
Also, keep the following points in mind when trying to isolate your studio:
 Dead air and mass are your friends. The whole concept of a room
within a room is to create mass and dead air space so that the sound
gets trapped. When you work on isolating your room, try to design in
some space that can trap air (dead air) — such as a suspended ceiling
or big upholstered furniture — or use double layers of drywall on your
walls (mass).
 Don’t expect acoustical foam or carpet to reduce the noise. Using these
items helps reduce the amount of sound that bounces around inside the
room, but acoustical foam or carpet does little toward keeping the
sound in or out of the room.
 Isolate the instrument instead of the room. Isolating the sound of your
guitar amp can be much less expensive than trying to soundproof your
whole room. Most commercial studios have one or more isolation booths
that they use for recording vocals and other acoustic instruments. You
can use that concept to create your own mini-isolation booths.
One idea for a truly mini–isolation booth is to make an insulated box for your
guitar (or bass) amp. If you just have to crank your amp to get the sound that
you want, you can reduce the amount of noise that it makes by placing it
inside an insulated box. Check out Figure 3-17 to see what I mean.
You can also create an isolated space in a closet by insulating it and closing
the door when you record, or you can put your guitar amp (or drums) in
another room and run a long cord from there to your recorder. If you do this,
remember that for long cord runs, you need to use balanced cords; otherwise,
you may get a bunch of noise and your signal may be too low to record well.
Controlling sound
After you create a room that’s as isolated from the outside world as possible,
you need to deal with the way sound acts within your room.
69
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

Sound travels through the air in the form of waves. These waves bounce
around the room and cause reflections (reverberations or echoes). One of the
problems with most home studios is that they’re small. And because sound
travels very fast (about 1,130 feet per second — the exact speed depends on
the humidity in the environment), when you sit at your monitors and listen,
you hear the reflected sound as well as the original sound that comes out of
your speakers. With big rooms, you can hear the original sound and reflec-
tions as separate sounds, meaning that the reflections themselves become
less of a problem. For a good home studio, you need to tame these reflections
so that they don’t interfere with your ability to clearly hear the speakers.
How all these reflections bounce around your room can get pretty compli-
cated. Read up on acoustics (the way sound behaves) to discover more
about different room modes: axial (one dimension), tangential (two dimen-
sions), and oblique (three dimensions). Each relates to the way that sound
waves interact as they bounce around a room. Knowing your room’s modes
can help you come up with an acoustical treatment strategy, but very compli-
cated formulas are used to figure out your room’s modes, especially those

You can find out more on room modes, as well as discover some room mode
calculators, by using your favorite Internet search engine and searching for
room modes. I recommend that you research these modes; this topic alone
could fill an entire book.
At the risk of offending professional acoustical engineers, I’m going to share
some tricks that I’ve been using in my studios. My main goal has been to
create a room with a sound I like that gives me some measure of control over
the reflections within the room. Because I (and most home recordists) both
record and mix in one room, it’s helpful to be able to make minor adjustments
to the acoustics to get the sound I want.
Sound control plays a major role in two aspects of recording — tracking and
mixing — and each requires different approaches for you to get the best pos-
sible sound from your recordings. I cover both of these aspects in the sec-
tions that follow.
Sound control during tracking
Tracking is what you’re doing when you’re recording. Two things that can
make a room a bad environment for tracking are not enough sound reflection
and too much sound reflection.
When tracking, your goal is to have a room that’s not so dead (in terms of
sound reflection) that it sucks the life out of your instrument and not so alive
that it overcolors the sound. The determining factors in how much reflection
you need in your room are the instrument that you record and the way it
sounds in the room. If your room is too dead (with not enough sound reflec-
tion), you want to add some reflective surfaces to liven things up (the room,
that is). If your room is too alive (with too much sound reflection), you need
to add some absorptive materials to tame those reflections.
You could buy a bunch of foam panels to catch the reflections or install a
wood floor or attach some paneling to the walls to add some life, but then
you would be stuck with the room sounding only one way. It may end up
sounding good for recording drums or an acoustic guitar, but it would proba-
bly be too alive for getting a great vocal sound — which requires a deader
space. One solution that works well is to get (or make) some portable panels
that can either absorb or reflect the sound.
Figure 3-18 shows an absorber/reflector that I’ve used and have found to
work well. (Go to my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com, for plans to build your
own.) One side has an absorptive material (dense fiberglass insulation), and
the other has a reflective surface (wood). They are assembled in an attractive
frame and designed to stack easily. Even with minimal woodworking experi-
ence, you can crank out a set of them in a weekend for very little money
(about $30 per panel). I guarantee that if you make them (or hire someone to
make them for you), you’ll find dozens of uses for them around your studio. 
(I outline a bunch of ways to use them in Chapter 8.)

Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

Sound control during mixing
The following sections detail the steps that can help you control the sound of
your (probably less-than-perfect) room during mixing.
Get a good pair of near-field monitors
Near-field monitors are designed to be listened to up close (hence the near in
their name) and can lessen the effects that the rest of the room has on your
ability to accurately hear them and to get a good mix.
Mix at low volumes
I know; mixing at low volumes takes the fun out of it, right? Well, as fun as it
may be to mix at high volumes, it rarely translates into a great mix. Great
mixing engineers often listen to their mixers at very low levels. Yes, they
occasionally use high levels, but only after the mixing is almost done and
only for short periods of time. After all, if you damage your ears, you’ll end
up with a short career as a sound engineer (hey, that rhymes!). I don’t want
to sound like your mother, but try to resist the temptation to crank it up.
Your ears will last longer, and your mixes will sound better.
Use panels to tame sound
Even with these two things (near-field monitors and low mixing levels), you
still need to do something to your room to make it work better for you. The

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 

secret to getting a good mixing room is to tame the sound reflections coming
out of your speakers. Dealing with high and midrange frequencies is pretty
easy — just put up some foam panels or the absorptive side of the panels
from Figure 3-18. (See, I told you that you would have a use for those panels.)
Here’s a rundown on how to place absorption panels in your studio:
 Start by hanging two panels (or by putting them on a stand or table)
so that they’re at the level of your speakers on the wall behind you.
 Put one panel on each side wall, right where the speakers are
pointed. This positioning, shown in Figure 3-19, gets rid of the higher 
frequencies and eliminates much of the echo.

 You may need to put some type of panel on the ceiling right above
your head. This is especially important if you have a low (8-feet-high or
less) or textured ceiling (you know, one with that popcorny stuff that
gets sprayed on).
You may not want to mount one of the absorber panels over your head
because they’re fairly heavy. A couple of 2-×-4-foot dense fiberglass
panels (the same ones that you used in the absorber/reflectors)
wrapped with fabric would work perfectly. In fact, you can easily make
some overhead diffusers like the ones shown in Figure 3-20. (The plans
for these are also on my Web site — www.jeffstrong.com.)
 You can also place a set of fiberglass panels in the corners of your
room behind the speakers. Just hang the panels at the same height as
your speakers so that they cut off the corner of the room. If you don’t
have enough room to fit the panels at an angle in the corner, you can
eliminate the backing from the fiberglass and bend the fabric-covered
panel to fit right in the corner. Either approach absorbs sound that may
bounce around behind the speakers.
Use bass traps to tame standing waves
You also need to consider standing waves when mixing. Standing waves are
created when bass tones begin reflecting around your room and bounce into

each other. Standing waves can either overaccentuate the bass from your
speakers (resulting in mixes that are short on bass) or cancel out some or all
of the bass coming out of your speakers (resulting in mixes with too much
bass). One problem with standing waves is that they can really mess up your
mixes, and you may not know that they are there.
To find out whether you have a problem with standing waves in your studio,
sit in front of your monitors and carefully listen to one of your favorite CDs.
Okay, now lean forward and backward a bit. Does the amount of bass that you
hear change as you move? Next, get up and walk around the room. Listen for
places within the room where the bass seems to be louder or softer. You may
find places where the bass drops out almost completely. If either inspection
proves to be true, you are the proud owner of standing waves. Don’t worry,
though. You can tame that standing-wave monster with a pair of bass traps.
Bass traps absorb the energy in the lower frequencies so that they don’t
bounce all over your room and throw off your mixes. You can buy bass traps
made of foam from some music stores or (yep, you guessed it) you can make
your own out of wood and insulation. Check out Figure 3-21 for a look at
some homemade bass traps. (The plans to make these are located on my
Web site: www.jeffstrong.com.)

75
Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio

The most common placement for bass traps is in the corners behind you
when you’re sitting at your mixer (see Figure 3-22). Placing a set of bass traps
in the other corners of the room can help even more.
After you place the bass traps, do the listening test again. If you notice some
areas where the bass seems to get louder or softer, try moving the bass traps
around a little. With some trial and error, you can find a place where they
work best.
Try not to get stressed out about the sound of your room. As important as your
room’s sound may be, it has a lot less impact on the quality of your recordings
than good, solid engineering practices. I know, I keep saying this, but it’s impor-
tant to remember. So do what you can and then work with what you have.

I
f you’ve ever been to a recording studio and watched a great recording
engineer create a mix, you’ve probably been entranced by the way that he
or she interacted with the mixing board: a dance around the mixer, a twist of
a knob here, a push of a slider there. All this works to the beat of the music.
It’s like watching a genius painter paint, or a great orchestra conductor con-
duct, or a brilliant surgeon surge . . . er, operate. I’ll even bet that one of the
reasons that you got interested in home recording is so that you could have 
a chance to play with those knobs and sliders yourself. Go ahead and admit 
it — you’ll feel better.
Well, you get your chance in this chapter. Not only do you discover what all
those knobs and sliders do, but you also begin to understand all the functions
that the mixer fulfills in the studio. You discover what makes up a channel
strip and how it’s used. You get a chance to see how busing and routing work
and even discover what these terms mean. But first you start by examining
the different types of mixers that are used in home studios.
Meeting the Many Mixers
For the home recordist, mixers come in several varieties: the analog desk, the
digital mixer or computer control surface with or without sliding faders and
fader banks, and software mixers controlled by your computer mouse and
keyboard.

Your choice of mixer mostly depends on the other equipment that you use in
your studio and on your budget. Here’s the lowdown for the three basic types
of recording systems:
 Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system: These all-in-one units come with a digital
mixer — just plug in your instrument or microphone and you’re ready 
to go. Most mixers in these units offer quite a bit of flexibility in routing
your signal, so you’ll likely be able to do quite a bit with little hassle.
The features of the mixer in each SIAB system vary, so look at the specs
of the unit you’re interested in before you buy.
 Computer-based system: All recording software includes a digital mixer
that’s controlled by your keyboard and mouse. Most of these programs
also allow you to connect an external bit of hardware called the com-
puter control surface. This gives you real knobs and sliders to tinker 
with as you work.
 Stand-alone components: Because everything is separate in this type of
system, you need to buy a mixer before you can use your recorder. Here
you can choose between an analog or digital mixer, and you need to
invest in the cords necessary to make the proper connections (this
alone can get expensive). The type of mixer you choose will partly be
based on your budget, but it will mostly be based on your working style
and whether you prefer analog or digital mixing. I talk more about these
mixers in the next two sections.
Analog mixer
The analog mixer, shown in Figure 4-1, enables you to route the signals within
the analog domain. Analog mixers tend to have many knobs, lights, and
faders — a set for each channel. If you want to change from mixing inputs
(your instruments) to mixing sounds recorded on the recorder, you need to
plug and unplug cords, or you need to get a mixer with twice as many chan-
nels as your recorder.
Analog mixers are quickly becoming relics of the past for most home recordists.
This is because digital mixers offer more functions for the price and generally
sound just as good — if not better — than their analog counterparts. That
said, many commercial studios still use (and prefer) large analog desks for
their mixing needs. This is because top-notch analog mixers ($100,000+ to
over $1 million) have a sound that many pros prefer. They also look impres-
sive, and many engineers are used to the workflow they get with them.
80
Part II: Recording 101 

Digital mixer
The digital mixer, shown in Figure 4-2, is a great option for home studio
owners because it can perform the same functions as a conventional analog
mixer in a lot less space. Routing — the process of sending your signals to
various places within the mixer — becomes almost easy using one of these
mixers. You can switch between input and track channels without having to
change a single cord.
Digital mixers handle all the busing and routing tasks within the digital
domain. With no cords to mess with, you have a lot less possibility for noise
to enter the system. And if noise does enter the system, it’s easier to find and
eliminate.

Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

One of the great things about digital mixers is the ability to automate your
mix. You can set up complex fader and effects changes to run automatically.
Some digital mixers even have motorized faders, which are really fun to watch!
Software mixer
If you want the flexibility of a digital mixer and don’t have an overpowering
need to physically touch the faders and knobs, a software mixer (shown in
Figure 4-3) may work for you. The software mixer is included with any com-
puter audio or MIDI production software. The advantage of a software mixer
is that after you have the computer and audio software that you want, you
have nothing else to buy.
Software mixers work much the same way as digital mixers. Because software
mixers are digital, you have an almost infinite variety of routing choices that
you can make without having to patch and repatch cables. Still, some people
may not be too keen on having to use a keyboard and a mouse to get mixing
work done rather than working with the more traditional knobs or slide faders.
For those of you who want the best of both worlds — high-tech computer
software and tactile stimulation — you can find control surfaces that allow
you to control the software’s mixer using real faders and knobs, as described
in the next section.

Computer control surface
If you end up with a computer-based system with a software mixer, you’ll
have some knobs, buttons, and faders to play around with on the computer
control surface, as shown in Figure 4-4. Aside from being able to fiddle with
some knobs, you’ll find that a computer control surface is a handy tool if you
decide to use a computer-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and want
(or need) to control the virtual mixer with some hardware.
These controllers send MIDI messages — messages encoded using the
Musical Instrument Digital Interface communications protocol — to the com-
puter that tells it which parameters to change. These controllers can easily
be programmed to work like a separate digital mixer.
Not all software works with each computer control surface, so check with the
software or computer control surface manufacturer before you buy to make
sure that the computer control surface is compatible with your system.

Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

Understanding Mixer Basics
The mixer is an extremely versatile piece of equipment, allowing you a stag-
gering variety of input and output configurations. And digital mixers (both
hardware and software) are even more flexible than their analog counterparts.
In fact, many digital mixers can be programmed to do almost anything that
you can imagine. Regardless of the type of mixer that you use, some mixing
aspects are universal: the inputs, the channel strip, busing (also known as
routing), and the outputs. The rest of the chapter explores these functions.
Think of a mixing board as a sort of air-traffic controller for the audio world.
Just as the guys (and gals) in the towers near an airport communicate with
all the planes in the air, making sure that collisions are avoided and that traf-
fic moves quickly and efficiently, the mixer routes all the incoming and outgo-
ing signals from the instruments, effects, and recording devices so that the
signals get to their desired destination without any problems.
Examining Inputs
To move your audio signal around within your mixer, you need to first get the
signal into the system and then you need to adjust the signal level. You per-
form these steps with the input jacks and the trim control.

84
Part II: Recording 101 

Inputs
You find the following three basic types of inputs, which are generally located
in the back of your system:
 Microphone: This is the XLR input (the three-pin thingy). It’s used for
microphones and often also has phantom power as part of its connection
(which generally can be turned off if you want). Phantom power is nec-
essary for condenser mics to function. See Chapter 6 for more on phan-
tom power.
 Line/instrument: This is a 1⁄4-inch jack (generally TS but sometimes TRS-
balanced) that accepts line-level signals from a synthesizer, drum
machine, or the line output from your guitar amp.
 Hi-Z: This is a relatively new input that’s designed for the home recordist.
This type of input uses a mono 1⁄4-inch (TS) jack and allows you to plug
your electric guitar (or bass or fiddle — anything with an electronic
pickup) directly into your system without having to mic it or run it
through a direct box first.
For more on the different connector types, check out Chapter 3.
Many digital mixers, computer audio interfaces, and SIAB systems are wired
to let you plug your electric guitars and similar instruments into one or more
of the instrument inputs instead of having a dedicated Hi-Z input.
A direct box (or DI box, short for direct injection) is traditionally used to con-
nect your guitar or bass directly to the mixer without having to run it through
your amp first. A direct box’s purpose is twofold:
 To change the guitar’s impedance level so that the mixer can create the
best sound possible (otherwise, it can sound thin or noisy)
 To change the cord from unbalanced 1⁄4-inch to balanced XLR so that you
can use a long cord without creating noise
For more on cord types and balanced versus unbalanced signals, see Chapter 3.
If you use a computer-based system, the inputs and outputs are located in
your audio interface — the hardware you use to connect the analog world to
the computer world. Chapter 2 has more on the various types of available
interfaces.
Trim control
The Trim control is a knob that’s used to adjust the level of the input signal
as it enters the mixer. You usually find the Trim control at the top of the front
85
Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

panel of your hardware unit. On SIAB systems and analog and digital mixers,
this control is generally located at the top of the mixer section for each chan-
nel, and on audio interfaces, it’s often found on the front panel. The amount
that you adjust the Trim control depends on the instrument that you have
plugged into the channel strip. If the Trim control is set too high, you get dis-
tortion; if it’s set too low, you get a signal that’s too weak to record. So be
sure to listen as you make your adjustments.
Most Trim controls have a switch or markings for Line or Mic(rophone) sig-
nals, with the Line level to the right and the Mic level to the left. Turn the
knob all the way to the left for line sources or slowly keep turning it to the
right for microphone sources until you get a nice, clean sound coming into
the mixer. See Chapter 7 for more on setting input levels.
For microphone sources, you use the Trim control to adjust the level for
recording. Turning the control up (turning the knob clockwise) activates an
internal preamp in the mixer, which boosts the level of the signal coming
from the mic. The internal preamp in pro mixers is usually fairly decent (it
can sound pretty good). However, many professionals prefer to use an exter-
nal preamp because it can often sound better or have a sound characteristic
that they want.
If you use an external preamp, check the owner’s manual of your mixer to see
whether you can bypass the internal preamp. Most professional mixers
enable you to do this. Sometimes just turning the Trim control all the way
down (to the Line marking) disengages the preamp from the circuit.
Checking Out the Channel Strip
The mixer is composed of numerous channels through which you route your
signal when you record or mix. This is called the channel strip. The channel
strip contains a lot of information, and the visual position of the various func-
tions often doesn’t correspond with the actual flow of the signal. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain both the elements of a typical digital channel strip
and the path of the signal through this part of the mixer.
Viewing the channel strip layout
Figure 4-5 shows the channel strip in a typical analog mixer, and Figure 4-6
shows the channel strip for a software mixer. Even though the mixer may
look confusing with all its knobs or buttons, lights, and sliders, you only need
to understand the basic makeup of one channel to understand them all. The
channel strip’s job is to take the signal from an instrument or microphone
and send it where you want it to go.

Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

Because most home recordists use a digital mixer of some sort — whether
software or hardware — I explain the channel strip in Pro Tools to give you
an idea of the functions of digital mixers in the channel strip window (as
shown in Figure 4-6). Your mixer may have some different features (and a dif-
ferent layout), but the basic functions are pretty universal. These features are
as follows:
 Input: This is where you choose the input that’s assigned to the channel
strip. In most systems, making the selection is as simple as clicking the
Input button and choosing from a menu that opens on-screen. You can
generally choose between a physical input from your hardware interface
or a bus (an internal signal). For more on routing an input, see the sec-
tion “Recognizing Mixer Routing,” later in this chapter.
 Output: This button controls the output of the track — where the sound
goes when it leaves the track. This can be a hardware output or any of
the buses (internal signal paths) that are available in your system.
 Automation Mode: In digital systems, automation means having certain
channel strip parameters, such as volume, panning, mute, send level,
and insert level, adjust dynamically throughout the song. Using this
button, you can choose among the different automation modes. These
vary depending on the type of system you have.
 Panning Slider: Use this slider (or a knob in many systems) to pan your
track to the left or the right in the stereo field. (For more on panning, see
Chapter 14.)

Part II: Recording 101 

 Panning Display: This display shows your track’s panning position —
its place to the left, right, or center in the stereo field.
 Solo and Mute: These buttons either solo or mute the track. Solo means
that every other track in your song is silenced (muted). Muting means
that only the selected track is silenced.
 Record Enable: Pressing the Record Enable button enables the track for
recording. When enabled, this button flashes red. In digital mixers, SIAB
systems, and computer control surfaces, this button is located on the
physical unit and not on the screen.
 Voice On/Off: This selector lets you choose between Off, where the
track does not play, or Auto, where the track plays if data is present.
This feature is unique to Pro Tools. In its place on some SIAB systems,
you may find a virtual track selector, where you can choose from a list of
additional tracks called, logically enough, virtual tracks.
 Volume Fader: This is the control for setting the volume of the audio
that’s contained in this track.
 Velocity/Volume Meter: This display, located to the right of the Volume
Fader, shows you the volume (Pro Tools calls this velocity) of the track
as the music plays. If you have a color display, any notes above digital 0
usually show in red at the top of the display.
 Group: The little red G is present if this track is grouped with others.
You can find out which group the track belongs to by clicking and hold-
ing over the icon. This feature is unique to Pro Tools as well.
 Track Type: This icon shows you the type of track. This is handy with
systems that can record and play back audio and MIDI tracks.
 Numerical Volume: This display shows you the volume of the track 
in decibels.
 Track Name: Many digital mixers allow you to customize the name of
your tracks to make it easier to remember what you have recorded on
them. This is the place where the name is listed. You can change the
name at any time by clicking the name and typing in a new one.
Following the flow of the signal
One of the most important things to understand when recording is how the
signal moves within your system. This knowledge lets you make the most of
your tracks and helps you to tailor the sound to match the music you hear in
your head as you compose, engineer, or produce your masterpiece.
Using the ubiquitous Pro Tools as an example again, here’s how the signal
flows through the channel strip (shown from top to bottom in Figure 4-7):
89
Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

 Source audio or input: This is the signal that is coming from your hard-
ware input or that is recorded to your hard drive. The signal starts here
and enters the track’s channel strip.
 Insert: This function lets you insert effects into your track. This function
is for effects, such as equalizers or dynamics processors, where you
want to change the sound of the entire signal. Some SIAB systems, such
as the Roland boxes, have separate EQ sections.
 Send Prefader: The Send function lets you route part of your signal out
to an Aux bus, where you can then insert an effect such as reverb. With
effects such as reverb, you don’t want to use the Insert function — as
you would with a compressor — because you want to be able to control
how much of the effect you hear. (Compressors only enable you to affect
the entire signal, not some portion of it.)
Adjust this slider or knob to send as much or as little of the signal to the
appropriate auxiliary component (Aux, get it?) for effects processing,
applying as much or as little of that effect to your final sound. Turning
the knob to the left produces less effect, and turning it to the right gives
more effect.
Along with being able to set the Effect Send level at each channel (you
can send more than one channel’s signal to each effect), you can also
adjust the level of the affected signal that’s brought back into the mixer
by using the Aux bus fader (which is described in the next section).
The Aux Send function can often be set to send the track’s signal either
prefader or postfader. Having this option gives you more flexibility to
control the affected sound. For example, you can send the dry signal of a
kick drum to a reverb (with the switch in the Pre position) and then
boost the bass on the dry signal. Doing this gives you some reverb on
the higher frequencies without adding it to the lower ones, which would
create some mud in the final mix.
The downside to this is that you can’t control the level of the signal
being sent to the effect using the fader. (You bypassed the fader in the
Pre position.) In this case, if you raise and lower the channel fader, the
amount of effect that you hear in relation to the dry signal changes as
well. For example, when you lower the fader, you hear more effect
because less dry signal is mixed in, and when you raise the fader, you
hear less effect because the dry signal is louder and the effect level is
the same.
 Solo and Mute: These buttons let you solo (silence all other tracks) and
mute (silence) the output of the track.
 Fader: This function lets you control the level (volume) of your signal
leaving the track and going to the output(s) you have chosen in the
Output section of the channel strip.
 Send Postfader: When you have the Pre button disengaged, your Send
signal is sent from your track after it passes through the track fader.

Adjusting the volume of the track also adjusts the level going through
your Send function.
 Pan: This control lets you adjust the amount of your signal that goes to
the left or right channel of your stereo output.
 Output: This is where your signal goes as it leaves the track’s channel
strip. This can be the master bus (connected to one of your physical
outputs) or an aux or a submix bus, where it will later be sent to the
master bus.

Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

Recognizing Mixer Routing
After you have an instrument plugged into the mixer channel strip, you want
to send that signal somewhere. This is referred to as routing or busing. (The
place where the signal ends up is, conveniently enough, referred to as a bus.)
Most mixers offer numerous busing possibilities, as follows:
 Master bus: This is where your signal goes before it leaves your system
and where you mix all your tracks.
 Submix bus: This is where you can mix several tracks before they go to
the master bus.
 Auxiliary bus: This is where you can add an effect to your signal and
then move it along to the master bus.
In the next few sections, I introduce you to some of the most-used busing
options and describe some ways to make this process easier.
Master bus
The master bus is where your music gets mixed and where you choose which
of the physical outputs this stereo mix goes to. The Pan knob setting for each
channel strip (how far to the left or right) dictates how much signal is sent to
the left or right channels of the master bus.
The master bus has a channel strip of its own where you can insert effects
such as a compressor or EQ. (I’m not a big fan of this, as you find out in
Chapter 16.) The master bus channel strip looks like a, ahem, stripped-down
version of a regular channel strip — it doesn’t have some routing options
such as an input selector, sends, or solo and mute buttons. This is because,
as the final stage of your signal flow, these functions aren’t necessary.
Faders for each channel control how much level is sent to the master bus and
how the volume of each channel relates to the other. The master fader only
determines the amount of overall volume of all channels that are routed to it
(for sending out to your speakers or to the stereo mix level).
Sub (submix) bus
Sometimes you have a group of instruments (such as drums) that you want
to control as a group independently of the master fader. Sending these tracks
92
Part II: Recording 101 

to another track and submixing them there enables you to adjust the overall
volume of the drums without affecting the volume of any other instruments
that aren’t assigned to this channel. This is called a submix, and signals sent
this way are sent (wait for it . . .) through the submix bus. When your signal
exits this bus, it goes to the master bus, where it’s blended with the rest of
your tracks.
Software mixers, such as the one in Pro Tools, often don’t have submix buses
per se. Instead, you can simply route your signal to any of the internal buses,
where you can adjust the level of all the signals coming to that bus using the
channel strip fader associated with the bus.
Auxiliary (aux) bus
The aux bus is where you send your signal when you use one of the Send
functions in your channel strip. This bus often has a channel strip of its own,
where you can insert the effect you want to use. From this bus, your signal
goes to the master bus, where it’s mixed with the rest of your tracks.
Opting for Outputs
Most mixers have a bunch of output jacks that are located on the left side of
the back of your hardware. You often find output jacks for the master bus,
headphones, and monitors.
Master Out jack
The Master Out jack goes to the power amp for your speakers or goes directly
to powered monitors, if you have any. This jack is generally controlled by the
master fader and sends the signal that’s routed through the master bus.
Phones jack
The Phones jack is for your headphones and is fed by the Phones knob on
the master console. This jack carries the same signal as the master bus —
only you get to control the volume separately.
93
Chapter 4: Meeting the Mixer

Monitors jack
The monitors jack generally contains that same signal as the headphones and
master outs but gives you another place to be able to plug in some speakers
or headphones. Oftentimes, the Monitor Out jack is also used for “hardware
monitoring” in systems that have it. Hardware monitoring is common on
computer-based audio interfaces and is designed to allow you to monitor
directly from the interface without having to wait until the audio signal goes
into the computer and back out again before it reaches your ears. This reduces
the latency that is often heard when listening to yourself as you record.

M
y first job in a recording studio was in 1985. I can still remember the
first time I walked into that studio. The owner was sitting, arms
crossed, in a chair in front of the mixing console (it was called a console in
those days because the mixer took up nearly the whole room). He looked at
me and pressed a key on the Macintosh computer sitting next to him. Then
all of a sudden, a synthesizer started playing, then another, and yet another.
This is cool, I thought. But then I heard my nemesis — the drum machine.
Drum machines made me lose my recording gigs as a drummer and drove me
to expand my career to that of a recording engineer as well. However, I even-
tually came to love that drum machine and the many others to follow (sigh).
In fact, over the years, I became so captivated by the whole MIDI/drum
machine thing that I assembled a whole series of electronic drum sets using
drum machines and samplers — all controlled through MIDI.
In this chapter, you find out how MIDI enables synthesizers and computers to
communicate with one another — a revolutionary thing for a musician. You
get your hands dirty in the world of sequencing — the process of recording
MIDI performance information so that you can play your performance auto-
matically. You also peruse a variety of MIDI-capable instruments and explore
the ins and outs of controlling your MIDI gear.

Like audio recording, MIDI can be a deep subject. You can go nuts trying to
understand every little nuance of MIDI. (I know some guys who are not quite
the same after plunging head first into this stuff.) The reality is that to use
MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know every little thing about it. In this
chapter, I focus on what you need to know to get started.
Meeting MIDI
MIDI is a protocol that musical instruments use to communicate with one
another. They do this through a cabled connection and a language that allows
each one to understand the other, regardless of the manufacturer or instru-
ment. All that’s required is an instrument equipped with MIDI ports (jacks).
MIDI data is different from an audio recording because it contains no sound
as such; rather, it’s limited to performance information. This includes infor-
mation about various performance characteristics, including the following:
 Note-on and note-off: What note is played and when
 Velocity: How hard someone presses a key
 After-touch: Whether the key pressure changes after the initial press
 Vibrato and pitch bend: Whether the pitch changes while a key is
pressed
This information allows the MIDI musician to potentially create a perfor-
mance that is as rich in texture as those of the world’s finest players.
Digital messages that are sent from one device to another across a cable
(called the MIDI cable, of course) create MIDI data. The cable connects to
MIDI ports on each device, and the messages are sent in the form of binary
digits. Each instrument can understand and respond to these messages.
Perusing MIDI ports
Three types of MIDI ports exist:
 The out port sends messages.
 The in port receives incoming messages.
 You use the thru port when you create a daisy chain to connect more
than two devices. The thru port sends the messages that one device
receives directly to the in port of another instrument. Figure 5-1 shows a
daisy chain setup.
96
Part II: Recording 101 

MIDI signals travel in only one direction. Data flows from the out port of a
device to an in port of another device, but not the other way around. Likewise,
data going through the thru port originates from the first device in the chain
and not the device whose thru port is being used. The way that data flows
allows a lot of flexibility in how you can connect different devices. Here are
some examples:
 Example 1: In Figure 5-1, three synthesizers are connected in a daisy
chain lineup. A cable connects device A’s out port to device B’s in port.
Another cable connects device B’s thru port to device C’s in port. In this
scenario, device A controls devices B and C. Devices B and C can’t con-
trol any other device, because neither device B nor device C has a con-
nection from its out port.
 Example 2: Suppose you connect device B to device C by using device
B’s out port instead of its thru port. In this case, device A sends mes-
sages to device B but not to device C. Device B controls device C. Device
C has no control over either A or B because neither one is connected to
device C’s out port.
 Example 3: Now take a look at Figure 5-2. In this figure, two devices (a
synthesizer and a computer sequencer) have MIDI cables running from
the out port of each to the in port of the other. (The MIDI interface in
this figure is necessary to make MIDI connections in a computer.) This
allows the communication to go both ways. For example, a master syn-
thesizer and a computer sequencer are frequently connected this way so
that you can send performance information from the synthesizer to the
sequencer when you’re recording your part and from the sequencer
back to the synthesizer when you want to play the part back.

Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

A connection to a MIDI device’s in port or through a device’s thru port doesn’t
allow the device to control another device. A MIDI device can control another
device only if the cable is connected from its out port to the other device’s in
port.
Understanding MIDI channels
Okay, so you have a daisy chain of MIDI instruments all hooked together and
you want to control them from your master keyboard or sequencer program.
Now you want the drum machine to play the drum part and a sound module
to play the string part. This is where the MIDI channels come in handy.
The MIDI channels allow you to designate which messages go to a particular
machine. You can program each machine to receive messages on one or more
of the 16 MIDI channels. For instance, you can set your drum machine to
receive messages on channel 10 (the default channel for drum sounds) and
set the sound module with the string sounds to receive data on channel 1.
(You set the MIDI channels on your instrument by using the System
Parameters menu. Check your owner’s manual for specific procedures.) After
you assign your channels, your master keyboard sends the performance
information for both the drum machine and the sound module playing the
string sounds across one MIDI cable. Each receiving device responds only to
the messages directed to the MIDI channel that it’s assigned to receive.
In this scenario, the sound module with the string sounds receives all the
data from the master keyboard, responds to the messages on channel 1, and
simultaneously sends the data from the master keyboard to the drum

machine (via the sound module’s thru port). The drum machine receives the
same messages from the master keyboard as the sound module but only
responds to those sent for channel 10.
Having 16 MIDI channels allows you to have up to 16 separate instruments
playing different parts at the same time. You may use 16 different devices or
16 different parts from the same device if you have a multitimbral sound gen-
erator. (For details, see the section “Synthesizer,” later in this chapter.)
You would think that each MIDI channel would be sent along its own wire in the
MIDI cable, but this is not the case. Inside the MIDI cable are three wires. Two
wires are used for data transmission, and one is a shield. MIDI messages are
sent across the two wires using a channel code, which tells the receiving device
what channel the data following the code applies to. So a MIDI channel mes-
sage, called a channel voice message, precedes each performance command.
Appreciating MIDI messages
For MIDI instruments to communicate with one another, they need to have a
common vocabulary. This is where MIDI messages come in. MIDI messages
contain an array of commands, including the following:
 Performance data messages: These messages consist of note-on and
note-off, velocity, after-touch, vibrato, and pitch-bend messages.
MIDI performance data messages each have 128 different values. For
example, each note that you play on the keyboard has a number associ-
ated with it (middle C is 60, for instance). Likewise, velocity is recorded
and sent as a number between 0 and 127, 0 being the softest volume 
(no sound) and 127 being the loudest that you can play.
 Control change messages: These are a type of performance data message.
These messages contain data about expression, including modulation,
volume, and pan.
 System-common messages: These messages contain data about which
channel the performance data is sent to and what sound in the sound
library to play. System common messages also include information
about timing data, master volume, and effects settings.
 System-exclusive messages: These messages contain information that is
exclusive to the system or device. The messages can include data trans-
fers of new sound patches, among other things.
To use MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know all (or many, really) of the
MIDI messages that a device can recognize. If you hook up your gear and
play, your MIDI devices generate and respond to the messages for you.
99
Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

Not all MIDI devices recognize all the MIDI commands. For example, a sound
module generally can’t send performance data messages, such as after-touch
messages, because a sound module doesn’t have triggering mechanisms that
produce these commands.
Check your instrument’s manual for a MIDI Implementation Chart. All MIDI
instruments come with this chart. In it, you can find a list of all the MIDI com-
mands that the device can send or receive. The chart also includes informa-
tion on polyphony, which refers to how many notes the instrument can play
at once, and multitimbrality, or how many different sounds the instrument can
produce at the same time.
Managing modes
Your synthesizer, drum machine, or other MIDI module has the following four
operating modes that dictate how your instrument responds to the MIDI mes-
sages it receives:
 Mode 1 — Omni on/poly: In omni on/poly mode, your instrument
responds to all the MIDI messages coming across the wires (well, except
the MIDI channel data). This means that your synthesizer or other
device tries to play the parts of all the instruments hooked up to your
MIDI controller. In this mode, your device also plays polyphonically
(more than one note at a time).
Some older MIDI devices default to omni on/poly mode (mode 1) when
you turn them on. In this case, you need to reset your instrument if it’s
one of several in your MIDI setup because if you don’t, the instrument
responds to any MIDI messages sent from the controller, not just the
ones directed toward it.
 Mode 2 — Omni on/mono: Omni on/mono allows your device to receive
messages from all MIDI channels but only lets it play one note at time
(monophonically). This mode is rarely, if ever, used.
 Mode 3 — Omni off/poly: In the omni off/poly mode, your device can
play polyphonically but responds only to MIDI signals on the channels
that it’s set to. This is the mode you use most often when sequencing.
 Mode 4 — Omni off/mono: In the omni off/mono mode, your instrument
responds only to the messages sent on the MIDI channel that it’s set to
and ignores the rest. Rather than play polyphonically, as in mode 3, your
instrument plays only one note at a time. This can be advantageous if
you’re playing a MIDI controller from an instrument that can play only
one note at a time, such as a saxophone.
100
Part II: Recording 101 

Taking a look at General MIDI
If you compose music for other people to play on their MIDI instruments or if
you want to use music from another composer, General MIDI is invaluable to
you. General MIDI (GM) is a protocol that enables a MIDI instrument to pro-
vide a series of sounds and messages that are consistent with other MIDI
instruments. With General MIDI, you can take a Standard MIDI File (SMF) of a
song that was created on one sequencer program, transfer the file to another
program, and use that other program to play the exact performance —
sounds, timing, program changes, and everything else.
GM instruments contain numerous sound patches that the MIDI community
has standardized. Not all of these sounds are exactly the same as far as
sound quality goes, but their sound type and location (acoustic grand piano
on patch #1, for instance) are the same on all GM-compatible machines.
Not all MIDI-capable instruments follow the GM standards. If this feature is
important to you, be sure to find out whether the instrument that interests
you is GM compatible before you buy.
GM standards dictate not only the particular sounds of a synthesizer but also
which drum sounds are located on which keys, how many notes of polyphony
the instrument has, and how many different channels the instrument can
receive and send instructions on. Here are the two levels of GM compatibility:
 GM level 1 compatibility: Level 1 protocols were developed in 1991 and
consist of a minimum of 128 instrument patches, 24 notes of polyphony,
receiving and sending capability for all 16 MIDI channels, 16-part multi-
timbrality, and a host of controller and performance messages.
 GM level 2 compatibility: Level 2 was implemented in 1999 and includes
more sounds, polyphony, and features. A GM-compatible device has 32
notes of polyphony, 16-channel support, up to 16 simultaneous instru-
ment sound patches, and a host of additional sounds (384, to be exact),
including 2 channels of simultaneous percussion sounds. Also added to
the GM2 standard are reverb and chorus effects.
Gearing Up for MIDI
Okay, so this MIDI thing sounds kind of interesting to you, and you want to know
what you’re going to need to buy to do some MIDIing yourself. Well, I’m sorry
to inform you that you can’t do any of this cool MIDI stuff with your vintage
101
Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

Stratocaster guitar or your acoustic drum set (unless you do some fancy rig-
ging to your gear). Here’s the equipment that you need to have to record
using MIDI:
 Sound generator: This device enables you to hear the music and may be
a synthesizer, drum machine, sound module, or sampler.
 MIDI controller: This device controls the MIDI instruments in your studio.
 Sequencer: This device records and plays the MIDI performances that
are programmed into it. The sequencer allows you to program your part
into the synthesizer and have it play back automatically (much like the
old-time player piano).
 MIDI interface: This interface enables your computer to send and
receive MIDI data.
I know this sounds like a lot of stuff, but most of this gear performs more
than one function in the MIDI studio. For example, nearly all synthesizers
come with drum sounds, and some synthesizers even include a sequencer. 
In this case, this one synthesizer can do the job of a sound generator, drum
machine, MIDI controller, and sequencer all in one.
In the following sections, I discuss the different types of sound generators.
Although you may find one piece of equipment that does everything you
want, in this section, I separate all the features that different equipment may
have to help you understand the function of each feature and decide how to
configure your studio.
Sound generators
The sound generator is the core of the MIDI studio. This is what produces the
sounds that you hear. Without it, you may as well skip the rest of the stuff
because, of course, you can’t hear any of your work.
Sound generators can come in many different shapes and sizes: You find the
fully functional keyboard synthesizer, the independent drum machine, the
stand-alone sound module, samplers, software synthesizers (soft-synths),
and the computer sound card. Each of these devices has its strengths and
weaknesses (read on for the details).
Synthesizer
A synthesizer, like the one shown in Figure 5-3, consists of not only sounds
but also a keyboard on which you can play these sounds. Synthesizers come
in a variety of sizes and configurations. For example, some keyboards come
with 61 keys (5 octaves) while others provide as many 88 keys — the size of
an acoustic piano keyboard.
102
Part II: Recording 101 

If you’re in the market for a synthesizer, you need to consider the following
things:
 Polyphony: This is the number of keys that sound at one time. Most
decent modern synthesizers have at least 16 notes of polyphony,
although ones with 32 notes are not uncommon.
Each manufacturer treats polyphony differently, and the GM standards
(discussed in the section “Taking a look at General MIDI,” earlier in this
chapter) allow some variations on the effective use of this parameter.
For instance, a synth patch may use more than one sound to create the
sound that you hear. The synth patch that you love so much may, in fact,
consist of four different sounds layered on top of one another. In this
case, you just reduced your polyphony to one-fourth with that one
patch. If your synthesizer has 16-note polyphony, it’s now down to 4-
note polyphony because each of those 4 notes has four “sounds” associ-
ated with it. If you use this patch, you can play only 4 notes (a simple
chord) at a time, not the 16 that you thought you had to work with.
Your best bet is to buy a synthesizer (or sound module) with the highest
polyphony you can afford, especially if you want to layer one sound on
top of another or do multitimbral parts with your synth.
 Multitimbrality: Most decent keyboards allow you to play more than
one sound patch at a time. This is called multitimbrality, which basically
allows you to have your keyboard divided into several groups of sounds.
For example, a multitimbral synth can divide a song’s chords, melody,
bass part, and drum-set sounds into different groups of sounds and then
play all those groups at once.
If you do any sequencing, a multitimbral synth is a must-have.
Otherwise, you would need a separate synthesizer for each type of
sound that you want to play. Fortunately, with the GM standards, com-
patible synthesizers made in the last ten years have the ability to play 16
sounds at once.
 Keyboard feel: Some keyboards have weighted keys and feel like real
pianos, while other keyboards have a somewhat spongy action. If you’re
a trained piano player, a spongy keyboard may feel uncomfortable to
Figure 5-3:

thesizer

103
Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

you. On the other hand, if you have no training in piano and don’t need
weighted keys, you don’t have to pay the extra money for that feature.
 Sound quality: This is a subjective thing. Choose the synthesizer that
has the sounds that you think you’ll use. I know this seems kind of obvi-
ous, but buy the synthesizer whose sounds you like even if this means
waiting and saving some more money before you can buy. If you buy a
synth that was a good deal but you don’t love the sounds, you are wast-
ing your money because you’ll just end up buying the more expensive
one later anyway.
 Built-in sequencer: Many keyboards contain a built-in sequencer, which
allows you to program and play back your performance. These are usu-
ally called keyboard workstations or MIDI workstations because they con-
tain everything you need to create a song. If you’re considering buying
one of these complete workstations, take a good, hard look at the
sequencer and the user interface to make sure that you like the way it
works. Each manufacturer treats the process of sequencing a little differ-
ently; you can probably find a sequencer that fits your style of working.
Drum machine
A drum machine contains not only the sounds of the drum set and other more
exotic drums but also a sequencer to allow you to program rhythms. Figure 5-4

Part II: Recording 101 

Most drum machines contain hundreds of drum sounds, numerous preset
rhythm patches, and the ability to program dozens of songs. All stand-
alone drum machines have pads on which you can play the part. The more
advanced drum machines can give your rhythms a more human feel. Effects,
such as reverb and delay, are also fairly common on the more advanced drum
machines.
Sound module
A sound module is basically a stripped-down version of a synthesizer or drum
machine. Sound modules don’t contain triggering devices, such as the keys
for the keyboard or pads for the drum machine. What they do contain is a
variety of sounds (often hundreds) that a master controller or sequencer trig-
gers. The advantage of sound modules is that they take up little space and
cost considerably less than their fully endowed counterparts (the synths and
drum machines, that is).
If you already have a master keyboard, adding sound modules can be a cost-
and space-effective way to add more sounds to your system.
Samplers
A sampler is a sound module that contains short audio samples of real instru-
ments. Most samplers come with sound libraries that contain hundreds of dif-
ferent types of sounds, from acoustic pianos to snare drums to sound effects.
These sounds are often much more realistic than those that come in some
synthesizers.
The real purpose of a sampler is to allow you to record your own sounds. For
example, in the ’80s, it was cool to make a drum set out of unusual percussive
sounds. A snare drum could be the sound of a flushing toilet (don’t laugh; I
actually did this) or breaking glass. Tom-toms could be grunts set to certain
pitches. You would be amazed at the strange stuff that people have turned
into music — all with the help of a sampler.
Another common use of a sampler is for recording short sections of already-
recorded songs. This can be a melodic or rhythmic phrase, a vocal cue, or a
single drum or synth sound. Sampling other songs is common in electronic
music, rap, and hip-hop (be careful of copyright issues before doing this,
however). If you’re into electronic music or hip-hop, you may find a sampler
a necessary addition to your studio.
Soft-synths
If you’ve chosen a computer-based system to run your home studio on, your
DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software enables you to produce great
sounds by using soft-synth plug-ins. Soft-synths are basically software equiva-
lents of stand-alone synthesizers, sound modules, or samplers. As you can see
in Figure 5-5, a soft-synth’s graphical user interface (GUI) is often designed to
look just like a piece of regular hardware, complete with buttons and knobs.
105
Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

Of course, soft-synths have advantages and disadvantages, as follows:
 Advantages: Soft-synths cost less than stand-alone units because no
hardware is involved.
 Disadvantages: Unlike regular synthesizers, soft-synths need a computer
to run and require quite a bit of processing power to work effectively.
This can slow your computer system and prevent you from recording as
many audio tracks or applying as many effect patches as you would like.
Countless soft-synth plug-ins are available for most DAW programs. The best
way to find the soft-synths for your DAW program is to visit an Internet news-
group or message board that covers your software. Then do a search for soft-
synths or ask the other members what software they use.
Sound card
Most sound cards that you can install in your computer (or that come with a
computer) have General MIDI sounds in them. Depending on the quality of
your sound card, the sound may be decent or border on the unbearable.
To find out whether the GM sounds in your computer’s sound card are any
good, play a MIDI file on your computer. First, do an Internet search for MIDI
files (just type MIDI in your favorite search engine). Some sites require you to
pay to download a song — especially for popular or familiar tunes — but
many sites allow you to choose a song to listen to without downloading or

paying a fee. Click a song and it should start playing automatically. You’ll
immediately know whether you like the sound of your sound card.
If you bought a new sound card for your computer to record audio with,
you’ll generally find that the sounds are pretty good. And with your audio
program, you have access to soft-synth patches.
MIDI controller
A MIDI controller is a device that can control another MIDI device. MIDI con-
trollers come in many different formats. In fact, a MIDI controller can be any-
thing from a synthesizer to a drum machine or a computer to a xylophone.
When MIDI first came out, your controller choice was limited to a keyboard,
but now you can choose among keyboards, wind controllers (for saxophones
or other wind instruments), guitars, and drums. So even if you don’t play
piano, you can find a controller that resembles an instrument that you know
how to play. Look around, and you may find one (or more) MIDI controllers
that allow you to create music your way.
Sequencer
Although you can get stand-alone sequencers and sequencers integrated into
a synthesizer, you probably want a computer-based sequencer for your home
studio. The reasons for this are many, but the overriding factor is that you
can have your MIDI and audio tracks in one place, and a computer-based
sequencer gives you more-powerful editing capabilities than a sequencer
that’s contained in a box and that uses a tiny LCD screen.
Of course, if you want to do only a minimal amount of MIDI in your studio,
you don’t necessarily need all the power of a computer-based sequencer 
program.
For example, imagine that you have a drum machine and an 8-track recorder
that has synchronization capabilities (your owner’s manual describes whether
the recorder can synchronize with other devices) and that you play guitar-
based music. Being a guitar freak, you want to use six tracks for your guitars
and two for your singing. With a MIDI connection from your drum machine to
your recorder, you may be able to synch these two machines and wait to
record your drum parts until the final mix. This effectively gives you a lot
more tracks — one for each drum sound that you’re using because you 
can adjust the volume, pan, and sound of each instrument in your drum
machine. This setup is similar to recording each instrument on a separate
track in your recorder.

Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments

MIDI interface
The MIDI interface allows you to send and receive MIDI information from a
computer. Many sound cards have a MIDI port, but if you end up doing a lot of
MIDI sequencing and use more than one sound module or external controller,
you need a separate MIDI interface, such as the one shown in Figure 5-6.
MIDI interfaces come in a staggering variety of configurations, so you need to
consider several things when you buy a MIDI interface. The following ques-
tions can help you to determine your needs:
 What type of computer do you own? MIDI interfaces are usually config-
ured to connect to your computer using either a USB port or an audio
interface, and MIDI interfaces use one of three available options: PCI,
FireWire, or USB. (Chapter 2 has more details on audio-interface connec-
tion types.) You determine which option to use by the type of port(s)
you have in your computer. For example, new Macs only have a USB
port, although you can add a serial port if you remove the internal
modem. A PC has either a parallel port or a USB port (and sometimes
both). PCs also have a joystick port that accepts a special MIDI joystick
cable (no MIDI interface is needed).
 How many instruments do you intend to connect? MIDI interfaces
come with a variety of input and output configurations. Models are avail-
able with two ins and two outs, four ins and four outs, and even eight ins
and eight outs. You can also buy “thru” boxes, which have one or more
inputs and several outputs. If you have only one or two instruments, you
can get by with a smaller interface (in this case, a 2×2 interface — two
ins and two outs — would work great). If you have many instruments
that you want to connect, you need a larger box.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the various type of microphones
 Positioning microphones for the best sound
 Exploring a variety of preamps
 Understanding how to care for your microphones
A
microphone’s job is generally to try to capture, as closely as possible, 
the sound of an instrument. But you can also use a microphone to
infuse a specific sound characteristic into a performance. Likewise, a preamp,
which boosts the signal of a microphone as the signal travels to the recorder,
can be used to accurately represent a sound or to add texture and dimension
to it. Microphones and preamps are the center of the sound engineer’s
palette. Just as a painter has his paints and brushes, you have your micro-
phones and preamps. And just as a painter can create a stunning variety of
visual textures with his tools, you too can make your creative statement with
the judicious use of these two pieces of equipment.
In this chapter, I explore the two most versatile tools of your auditory craft.
You look at the various types of microphones and preamps, and you gain an
understanding of each one’s role in capturing a performance. You also dis-
cover what types of mics and preamps work for particular situations. To top
it off, this chapter guides you through purchasing and caring for your pre-
cious new friends (the mics and preamps, that is). You can find out how to
use your mics in Chapter 8, where I discuss specific mic placement options.
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
When you start looking at microphones, you basically find three different
types of construction methods (condenser, dynamic, and ribbon) and three
basic polarity patterns (omnidirectional, cardioid, and figure-8). The follow-
ing sections explore these various constructions and patterns and help you
make sense out of them.

Construction types
Whether a microphone is a $10 cheapie that has a cord permanently attached
to it or a $15,000 pro model with gold-plated fittings, all microphones convert
sound waves to electrical impulses that the preamp or mixer can read and
the recorder can store. Each of the three construction types captures this
auditory signal in a different way, and as such, each adds certain characteris-
tics to the sound. Here’s how the different mics affect sound:
 Condenser: This type tends to have a well-rounded shape to its fre-
quency response and a fast response, allowing it to often pick up high
transient material, such as the initial attack of drum, very well. These
mics can sound more natural, but they can also be somewhat harsh if
placed too close to a high transient source.
 Dynamic: Dynamic mics tend to accentuate the middle of the frequency
spectrum because the thick diaphragms (relatively speaking when com-
pared to a condenser mic) take longer to respond.
 Ribbon: Because the ribbon mic is relatively slow to respond to an audi-
tory signal, it tends to soften the transients (the initial attack of an instru-
ment) on instruments such as percussion and piano. The high end isn’t
as pronounced as with other construction types, so these mics tend to
have a rounder, richer tone.
I detail these aspects in the following sections. In most cases, the type of con-
struction dictates the general cost category in which the mics fit.
Condenser microphones
The condenser microphone is without a doubt the most popular style of
microphone used in recording studios (home or commercial). Condenser
mics are sensitive and accurate, but they can also be expensive. Recently,
however, condenser mics have come down in cost, and you can buy a decent
one for about $200. Very good ones start at about $500.
110
Part II: Recording 101 
Phantom power
Phantom power is a term used to describe the
small amount of voltage that is applied to a con-
denser microphone. This power enables the mic
to function properly. In most cases, the phantom
power comes from your mixer or preamp and is
sent to the microphone through one of the wires in
the XLR cable. (I cover XLR cables in Chapter 3.)
Some condenser mics have an internal battery or
separate power supply that provides this power.
A switch, which is usually located on the preamp
or mixer, enables you to turn the phantom power
off and on. Even though dynamic microphones
don’t use phantom power, this small amount of
voltage doesn’t damage them.

The condenser microphone has an extremely thin metal (or metal-coated
plastic or Mylar) diaphragm (the part that senses the signal). The diaphragm
is suspended in front of a metal plate (called a backplate). Polarizing voltage
is applied to both the diaphragm and the backplate, creating a static charge
in the space between them. When the diaphragm picks up a sound, it vibrates
into the field between it and the backplate. This produces a small signal that
can then be amplified. Figure 6-1 shows how a condenser mic is constructed.
Condenser mics need a small amount of voltage (from 9 to 48 volts) to func-
tion. If you use a condenser mic, make sure that either it has its own internal
battery or you have a preamp or mixer equipped with phantom power, which
is described in the nearby sidebar.
Here are a few additional decisions you need to make when selecting a con-
denser mic:
 Tube or solid-state? Condenser mics can be made with either transistors
(known as solid-state) or vacuum tubes. As with all the tube or solid-state
gear, base your decision on the sound characteristics that you prefer. 
For the most part, tube condenser mics have a softer high end and a
warmer overall tone. Solid-state mics, on the other hand, are often more
transparent — the sound is captured by them with less coloration.
 Large- or small-diaphragm? Condenser mics come in two broad cate-
gories: small-diaphragm and large-diaphragm (see Figure 6-2). Large-
diaphragm mics are more popular than their smaller-diaphragm
counterparts, partly because large-diaphragm condenser mics have a
more pronounced bottom end (low frequencies). Large-diaphragm mics
also possess a lower self noise, that is, noise created by the microphone.

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Before you buy only large-diaphragm mics, consider this: Small-diaphragm
condenser mics often have an even frequency response and can more
accurately capture instruments with a pronounced high-frequency compo-
nent (violins, for instance).
Dynamic microphones
You’ve probably had the chance to use a dynamic mic. The hugely popular
Shure SM57 and SM58 often characterize this type of mic. Dynamic micro-
phones have several qualities that make them unique. They can handle a lot of
volume (technically known as SPL, meaning sound pressure level), which
makes them perfect for extremely loud signals, such as drums, amplifiers, and
some rock vocalists. Dynamic mics are also not as transparent (they don’t
accurately represent high frequencies) as condenser mics, so they often
impart a “dirty” or gritty” sound to the signal.
The dynamic microphone uses a magnetic field to convert the sound impulse
from the diaphragm into electrical energy, as shown in Figure 6-3. The
diaphragm is often made of plastic or Mylar and is located in front of a coil of
wire called a voice coil. The voice coil is suspended between two magnets.
Figure 6-2:
Condenser
mics can
have either
small or
large
diaphragms.
112
Part II: Recording 101 

When the diaphragm moves (the result of a sound), the voice coil moves as
well. The interaction between the voice coil’s movement and the magnets
creates the electrical signal.
The sound of a dynamic mic can be described as somewhat boxy, meaning
that these mics don’t represent the highest or lowest frequencies of your
hearing spectrum accurately (not necessarily a bad thing). They are also
durable. Rough treatment probably won’t damage them much, aside from the
diaphragm, and a tough metal screen protects it. Dynamic mics are typically
used for live shows. These mics are often very inexpensive to buy and main-
tain; you can get a good dynamic mic for about $100.
Ribbon microphones
A ribbon microphone produces its sound in much the same way as a dynamic
mic. The diaphragm is suspended between two magnets. The ribbon mic dif-
fers from the dynamic mic in that it uses a thin ribbon of aluminum instead of
plastic or Mylar (see Figure 6-4). Ribbon mics were popular from the 1930s
through the 1960s but have, for the most part, now taken a backseat to con-
denser mics in today’s studios. This is mainly because ribbon mics are fragile
and expensive and aren’t as transparent as condenser mics. In fact, a gust of
wind or a strong breath blown into the diaphragm is all it takes to break an
aluminum ribbon in one of these mics. (It’s not the end of the world, though;
ribbons aren’t that expensive to replace — they generally cost $100 to $150.)
Ribbon mics are experiencing a renaissance because of the number of record-
ing engineers who are searching for an old, vintage sound. Ribbon mics have
a unique sound that is often described as silky or smooth. This essentially
means that the high frequencies tend to roll off slightly (gradually reduce)
and the lower frequencies smear together a bit.

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Ribbon mics used to be fairly expensive (at least $1,000), but as interest in
them has increased from digital recordists, you can now find some decent
ones for just a few hundred dollars.
Polarity patterns
Microphones pick up sounds in different ways, which are known as polarity
patterns. Here’s how the various patterns work:
 Omnidirectional mics can capture sounds all around them.
 Cardioid (or directional) mics pick up sounds just in front of them.
 Figure-8 (or bidirectional) mics pick up sounds from both the front and
back.

Part II: Recording 101 

The polarity patterns on microphones are represented on a chart that often
comes with the microphone (or is part of its spec sheet). This chart is often
called a polar graph, and the graph shows how well the microphone picks up
various frequencies in front of or behind it.
Omnidirectional
The omnidirectional mic can pick up sounds coming from anywhere around
it. Omnidirectional mics are useful for situations where you want to capture
not only the source sound but also the sound of the room that the source is
coming from. You can find omnidirectional mics used in stereo pairs for drum
overheads and groups of acoustic instruments, such as orchestras.
Omnidirectional mics are not generally used for close miking — when you
place the mic less than a foot from the sound source — because they tend to
catch too much background noise. You can see the pickup pattern of an
omnidirectional mic in Figure 6-5. The round pattern shows that the mic picks
up sound from all directions.

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Cardioid
Cardioid microphones pick up the sound in front of them and reject sounds
that come from behind. Cardioid mics are the most common types for live
bands because you can control the sound that they pick up. If you have a car-
dioid mic on the tom-tom of a drum set, the mic picks up only the sound of
that drum and not the sound from the other instruments around it.
The three types of cardioid microphones are cardioid, super-cardioid, and
hyper-cardioid. The differences among the types of cardioid patterns of each
mic aren’t that great. Check out the graphs in Figure 6-6 to see how the polar-
ity patterns of cardioid microphones differ.
Generally, you don’t need to think about the minor polarity-pattern differ-
ences among the types of cardioid mics when you buy or use a microphone.
You won’t notice the practical differences in the way these three types of
mics work.
Cardioid mics all produce more bass when they are close to the sound
source. This is called the proximity effect. Essentially, the closer the mic is to
its source, the more bass the mic picks up. You don’t find the proximity effect
in omnidirectional or figure-8 mics. Many cardioid condenser mics have a
bass roll-off switch that allows you to eliminate added bass that may occur
from having the mic close to the source.
Figure-8
Figure-8 mics (also called bidirectional mics) pick up sound from both the front
and back, but not all the way around. If you look at the graph in Figure 6-7, you
can see that sound is not effectively picked up from areas on the sides of the
microphone.

Figure-8 mics are often used to record two instruments simultaneously. For
example, you can place the microphone between two horn players with the
side of the mic perpendicular to the players. This allows you to capture both
instruments while eliminating any sound in front of the musicians.
Most figure-8 condenser mics have the same frequency response for both the
front and back sides, but some ribbon mics produce very different responses,
depending on whether the sound is coming from the front or the back. For
instance, a Royer r121 mic picks up more high frequencies from the back side
of the mic than the front. You can use this to your advantage when recording
an instrument. If the sound has too many low frequencies, just turn the mic
around a little or a lot, depending on how many high frequencies you want to
add (more on this in Chapter 9).

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Multiple-pattern mics
Some condenser microphones can switch among various pickup patterns.
These are generally large-diaphragm mics. These mics have a switch that
allows you to choose from cardioid, omnidirectional, or figure-8 (refer to the
right image in Figure 6-2). These mics can do this because they generally con-
tain two sets of diaphragms and backplates, which are positioned back to
back. You may want to have at least one of these types of microphones
around to give you more variety in microphone positions.
The omnidirectional pattern in a multiple-pattern microphone works (and
sounds) differently from a true omnidirectional mic. So for critical applica-
tions (recording an orchestra, for instance), the multiple-pattern mic may not
be a fair substitute for an exclusively omnidirectional mic.
Assessing Your Microphone Needs
Buying microphones is, without a doubt, one of the most critical decisions
that you make when setting up your home studio. Using the right microphone
for the job can mean the difference between recording okay tracks and truly
spectacular ones.
As recently as just a few years ago, you had to choose between inexpensive
dynamic mics (what most home recordists could afford) and expensive con-
denser or ribbon mics (what the pro studios had). But, as luck would have it,
you’ve entered a time in home recording where you have many more options.
In fact, a whole line of project studio mics has recently emerged. This is a
new market that manufacturers have found to be hugely profitable, so the
choices are expanding almost daily. In some cases, a $500 project studio mic
can rival a $2,000-plus pro mic — at least for the home recordist’s purposes.
So the question that you’re inevitably going to ask is, “What microphones
should I get for my home studio?” Good question. And the answer is, “Well, it
depends on what you need.” So before I go into detail about what mics may
be best for you, you should spend a minute assessing your needs. The follow-
ing questions may help you in your assessment:
 What type of music will you record? If you play rock or pop music, you
should probably start with dynamic mics because they’re inexpensive
and their limitations in high or low frequencies don’t matter as much as
if, for example, you wanted to record your string quartet. In this case, a
pair of condenser mics would do the trick.
 What instruments will you record? Loud amps, drums, and screaming
singers beg to be recorded with dynamic mics, whereas light percussion,
vocals, and stand-up basses shine through with large-diaphragm con-
denser mics.
118
Part II: Recording 101 

 How many mics will you use at once? If you need to record your whole
band at once, budget constraints may dictate your choice between
dynamic and condenser mics or a condenser or ribbon mic for vocals. If
you need only a couple of mics to record the occasional vocal or instru-
ment, you can invest more in each mic.
Deciding How Many Microphones 
and What Kind
You will likely build your microphone collection over time rather than buying
all your mics at once. This is the best way to buy mics, because it gives you
time to develop an understanding of what you can do with the microphone
that you have before you plunk down your money for another one. You’re
better off having a few mics that best fit your situation than having a whole
bunch of mics that just sorta work for you.
If you’re like most people, your budget dictates how many mics you can buy
and what kind they may be. In the following sections, I try to help you get the
best mics for your recording needs and guide you through the process of
slowly accumulating microphones.
Before you buy a ton of mics, know this: Many digital systems have an effect
called a mic simulator. The mic simulator allows you to use a relatively inex-
pensive mic and get the sound of a much more expensive one. If your system
has a mic simulator program (you can find out by searching through your
system’s effects patches), I recommend that you get a basic dynamic mic
first. You may find that you like the way the mic simulator sounds and dis-
cover that you don’t need as many mics as you thought.
Getting started
A basic mic setup consists of a couple of dynamic mics for drums, guitar
amps, or other loud instruments and a decent large-diaphragm condenser
mic for vocals or other acoustic instruments. The next sections lay out the
mics that I would consider if I were starting out on a budget.
Dynamic mics
A Shure SM57 is hands down the best choice for your first dynamic mic. This
is a great dynamic mic for very little money — about $80. This mic works well
for miking amps and drums and the occasional gritty vocal. Everyone should
have at least one of these mics.
119
Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Large-diaphragm condenser mics
Your choice here depends on your voice and the acoustic sound that you’re
looking for. I would check out the following mics:
 Studio Projects B1: This inexpensive mic is a good choice for your first
large-diaphragm condenser mic. You can find one for about $80.
 MXL 990: This mic has a slightly different sound than the Studio
Projects B1 and costs about the same ($70 to $80). Buy the mic that
sounds better to you.
 MXL V63M: This mic is a step up from the MXL 990 — its street price is
about $100 — and you may like this one better than its less expensive
brother. Again, only buy the more expensive mic if you think it sounds
better.
 Octava MK319: This mic is a little more expensive than the previous
three — about $125 — but it’s still at the lower end of the price spec-
trum and may work better for your vocals than the others.
 Audio Technica AT3035: This mic is more expensive than the others I
list here (about $200), but if you can afford it, check it out. Some people
prefer the sound of this mic over that of the other mics.
A large-diaphragm condenser mic is the first condenser mic for most home
recordists. These good all-around mics can work well for a lot of applications.
Movin’ on
After you have your basic mics, you can start to add a few more. If you intend
to record your band, you need to at least mic the drum set (four mics can get
you around the set). In this case, you can add a couple more dynamic mics
and perhaps get one or two that are designed for particular applications. For
instance, mics are made to work best on the kick drum of a drum set. At this
point, you can also get a second condenser mic — maybe a small-diaphragm
condenser mic this time or a large-diaphragm tube condenser mic. You may
want to choose one that sounds different from the one you already have, or if
you love the one that you have, you can get a second one just like it to use as
a stereo pair.
Dynamic mics
For additional dynamic mics, I would add one or two more SM-57s and try
one of the following:
 Sennheiser e609: I like Sennheiser mics; this is one of my favorite (and
inexpensive) amp or kick drum mics. It has a different sound than the
venerable SM-57 and doesn’t cost much more — a little over $100 — so
adding one of these lets you cover some more bases.
120
Part II: Recording 101 

 Audio Technica ATM25: This is a pretty good kick drum mic for not a lot
of money — about $200 — although it is more costly than some other
dynamic mics. If you record drums live, this mic is worth trying.
Large-diaphragm tube condenser mics
If you’re on a budget (and who isn’t?), try out the following inexpensive large-
diaphragm tube condenser mics:
 Rode NTK: This is an awesome mic regardless of price, but for about
$400, it’s one of the best deals available. This mic is good for vocals 
and acoustic instruments. I’ve even used a pair for the overheads on a
drum set.
 Studio Projects T3: This mic has an advantage over the Rode NTK
because it has a variable polar pattern selector, allowing you to choose
among cardioid, figure-8, and omnidirectional patterns — and patterns
in between. The NTK are cardioid only. This variability gives you more
options when recording and increases the versatility of the mic, making
this $600 mic worth checking out.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics
Though not sexy to most recordists, small-diaphragm condenser mics can
come in handy. Here are a few inexpensive ones that are worth checking out:
 Octava MK012: This mic is a great buy. It’s inexpensive (under $100) and
sounds good on many types of acoustic instruments — guitars, violins,
cellos, double basses, drum overheads, and percussion. The only draw-
back to this mic is that quality control has been known to be, shall we
say, variable. You need to try out each mic carefully before you buy it
because some just don’t sound good.
 MXL 993: I don’t like this mic as much as the Octava, but if you can’t
find the Octava or are squeamish about testing a bunch of mics to find a
good one, the MXL 993 is worth considering. At about $80, it’s a pretty
good-sounding mic.
Going all out
As your mic collection grows, you’ll probably start looking for a vocal mic
that works best for you. In this case, you may look at large-diaphragm tube
condenser mics or even a ribbon mic.
Choosing a vocal mic is a personal thing. If you’re a singer, audition a bunch of
mics by using your voice to see what sounds best to you. If you record more
than one singer and each has a different type of voice (tenor or soprano, for
instance), you may need to look for more than one vocal mic.
121
Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

After this, consider buying a stereo pair of small-diaphragm condenser mics for
drum overheads (mics placed over the drum set) or other multi-instrument
applications. You may also want to start adding some higher-quality (and more
expensive) mics to your collection. The following sections detail some mics
that offer a good bang for the buck.
Dynamic mics
Here are a couple of higher-end dynamic mics that I use:
 Sennheiser MD421: This is arguably the industry-standard tom mic. It’s
been used on tons of recordings over the years. If you intend to record
drums with more than the basic 3- or 4-mic setup (see Chapter 9 for
more details), having a couple of these tom mics is a necessity. They
aren’t cheap — at about $350 each — but for their purpose, they are
worth every penny.
 EV RE20: This is a common kick drum mic that is also used for amps
and some vocals. You can get this mic for about $400 to $450.
Large-diaphragm condenser mics
You can find a ton of good large-diaphragm condenser mics, and the sky’s the
limit on how much you can spend on them. That said, consider the following
reasonably priced options:
 Shure KSM-44: I really like this mic. It’s a multipattern mic that offers
cardioid, figure-8, and omnidirectional configurations. The sound is
pretty neutral by today’s standards — many manufacturers like to boost
the top and bottom ends of their mics to make them sound “sexy.” The
KSM-44 doesn’t have this feature, and as a result, the mic is very versa-
tile. I often use one for drum overheads and other acoustic sources such
as big percussion instruments (like surdos, congas, and djembes) and
acoustic string instruments — and even as a room mic for ensembles.
This mic costs about $650.
 AKG C414B: This is another industry-standard mic that sounds great on
a lot of sources — vocals, acoustic instruments, drums, and others. Like
the KSM-44, this mic has selectable polar patterns. In this, you have five
choices: omnidirectional, cardioid, wide-cardioid, hyper-cardioid, and
figure-8. This mic sells for about $800.
 Soundelux U195: This is an awesome mic for a lot of sources, including
many vocalists, percussion, and drums. (I love to use this as a room mic
placed 6 to 8 feet in front of the kick drum.) This mic isn’t cheap — at
about $1,200 — but you’ll never need to upgrade it.

Ribbon mics
Ribbon mics used to be very expensive and required a great preamp with lots
of clean gain (volume) because they don’t produce a very strong signal. This
is changing. You can now find a ribbon mic for just a few hundred dollars,
and if you don’t have a high-gain preamp, you can find a mic that produces a
stronger signal (called active-ribbon mics). Here are some ribbon mics that I
recommend:
 Octava ML19: This is the least expensive ribbon mic available, and it
sounds pretty good, especially for the price (roughly $400). For the
budget-minded recordist who needs a ribbon mic, you can’t go wrong
with this one.
 AEA R84: This is one sexy mic. It looks gorgeous and sounds great. For
classic “silky” vocals or to take the edge off instruments such as trum-
pets and other horns, this mic is awesome. Of course, awesome doesn’t
come cheap — about $1,000 plus a good high-gain preamp. Still, if you
like the vocals sound that you can only get from a ribbon mic or if you
record a lot of horns, you need to try this mic.
 Royer Labs 122: This is the first active-ribbon mic. It has electronics
that boost the mic’s signal, so you don’t need a super high-gain preamp
to get a good sound. Royer Labs ribbon mics are known as great mics,
and this one costs about $1,500.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics
If your budget allows you to get a pair of great small-diaphragm condenser
mics, the following two provide good value:
 Josephson C42: I can’t recommend this mic highly enough, especially
the matched pair (model no. C42mp). A pair of these mics is great for
drum overheads and almost every acoustic instrument I’ve tried them
on. I love to use a single mic on double bass, a pair on piano, and a pair
on a live ensemble. These mics run about $475 each, but you would be
hard-pressed to find a mic at double the price that sounds better.
 Peluso CEMC6: The CEMC6 mic is a nice unit, especially for under $300
each. These mics rate almost as highly as the Josephson. But if you’re
on a tight budget, try one or a pair of these mics.
You won’t find either of these mics at the big music retailers, so if you’re
interested in them, you’ll need to look around a bit. I suggest doing a search
on Google (www.google.com) to find an Internet retailer. You can find a
bunch of reputable dealers who carry them.

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Finding the Right Mic for the Situation
Certain mics work better than others for particular situations. In this section,
I present some typical applications to give you an idea of what types of mics
are traditionally used for various purposes. (You can find more ideas about
mic usage in Chapter 8, where I discuss specific miking techniques.)
When you consider a mic, think about the frequency spectrum that the
instrument encompasses. If you use a dynamic mic for a symphonic orches-
tra performance, for example, you’ll be disappointed by the results because it
lacks an accurate high-frequency response. On the other hand, using a small-
diaphragm condenser mic on the tom-toms of a drum set makes them sound
thin and is a waste of money because you can get by with a much less expen-
sive dynamic mic for this purpose.
Microphone choice is fairly subjective. The following list contains some basic
suggestions based on what is typically used:
 Vocals: Most people prefer the sound of a large-diaphragm condenser
mic for vocals. If you have the budget, you may also want to audition
some ribbon mics for your voice. A dynamic mic is best when you’re
going for a dirty or raw sound (excellent for some harder rock, blues, or
punk music) or if your singer insists on screaming into the mic. A small-
diaphragm condenser mic is rarely the first choice for most singers, but
it’s not out of the question for some vocalists if you don’t mind a bright,
present (high-frequency) sound.
 Electric guitar amp: A dynamic mic or a small-diaphragm condenser mic
works well on an electric guitar amp. Some people use large-diaphragm
condenser mics on guitar amps and like the added low frequencies that
can result. A ribbon mic can sound great, but take care in placing the
mic so that you don’t overload it and blow the ribbon. Move the mic
back a bit or off to the side and you should be fine.
 Electric bass amp: Your first choice when miking an amplified electric
bass is either a large-diaphragm condenser mic or a dynamic mic. Either
one can capture the frequency spectrum that the bass guitar encom-
passes. Small-diaphragm condenser mics aren’t a good choice because of
their inherent high-frequency focus. I like ribbon mics for electric bass,
but you need to take the same care as you would with a guitar amp.
 Acoustic guitar and other stringed instruments: A large- or small-
diaphragm condenser mic or a ribbon mic works well in most instances.
A dynamic mic has too limited a frequency response to create a natural
sound (but may create an effect that you like). Choose the large- or
small-diaphragm type based on the overall frequency spectrum of the
instrument. For example, to capture the depth of a guitar’s tone, choose
a large-diaphragm mic, but for an instrument with a higher register, such
as a violin or mandolin, a small-diaphragm mic works great. I’m partial
124
Part II: Recording 101 

to small-diaphragm condenser mics for these instruments because I can
get more clarity and I don’t have to fight the low-end bump that often
occurs with a large-diaphragm condenser mic.
 Horns: I’m partial to ribbon mics for horns. These types of mics can
soften the tone slightly and make the horns sound more natural, espe-
cially if you mic closely (within a couple feet or so). My second choice is
a large-diaphragm condenser mic in a figure-8 or omnidirectional pattern
placed off to the side of the instrument a bit. For this, you need a large-
diaphragm condenser mic that has multiple patterns, such as the AKG
C414B or the Shure KSM-44. Some people like a tube condenser mic, so if
you’re on a budget, the Studio Projects T3 is a good place to start.
 Piano: Both large- and small-diaphragm condenser mics are generally
used for piano. Your choice depends on where you place the mics and
how the room sounds. For example, a great-sounding room begs for a
pair of omnidirectional small-diaphragm mics placed away from the
piano a bit. I’m not a fan of ribbon or dynamic mics for this instrument.
 Drum set: The tom-toms, snare drum, and kick (bass) drum all sound
good with dynamic mics because they don’t contain high frequencies.
You can also use large-diaphragm condenser mics, but be careful where
you place them because if your drummer hits them, they’re toast.
 Cymbals: For the cymbals of a drum set, a pair of small-diaphragm
condenser mics works well, although some people prefer to use a
large-diaphragm mic instead. A ribbon mic also sounds pretty good
and can take some of the harshness of cymbals when recorded digi-
tally. A dynamic mic would lack the high-frequency response to make
the cymbals shine through in a mix.
 Miscellaneous percussion: Now, here’s a broad category. By miscella-
neous, I mean shakers, triangles, maracas, and other higher-pitched 
percussion toys. For these instruments, either small- or large-diaphragm
condenser mics can work well. If it’s a very quiet instrument, a large-
diaphragm mic would be preferable because of the higher self-noise of
the small-diaphragm mic.
You may choose a different type of mic, especially if you try to create a cer-
tain effect. For instance, using a ribbon mic on a metallic shaker rather than a
small-diaphragm condenser mic softens the highest frequencies of the instru-
ment and gives it a mellower sound.
If you intend to record loud instruments — drums, amplified guitars, or
basses, for example — look for a mic with a high SPL (sound pressure level)
rating. This is a rating of how much volume (listed in decibels) the micro-
phone can handle before distorting. A high SPL is above 130 decibels.
Some professional condenser mics have a pad switch that allows you to
reduce the sensitivity of the mic, thereby increasing its ability to handle high
sound pressure levels.
125
Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Partnering Mics with Preamps
One of the most important relationships in your home studio is the one
between your microphones and the preamp — the nice bit of hardware that
boosts the mic’s signal so that it can be recorded. The greatest microphone in
the world run through a cheap preamp won’t sound good. By the same token, a
cheap mic plugged into a great preamp sounds only as good as the bad mic.
If your mixer includes XLR inputs (low-impedance microphone inputs), you
already have internal preamps in the channels with the XLR jacks. For the
most part, these preamps are of lesser quality than the external variety, but
they may work for you. For instance, some home recordists swear by the
internal preamps in the Mackie VLZ-Pro mixers.
Plug in your mic and listen to the sound that you get. If you like it, you may
not need to buy external preamps right away. If not, you may have to allocate
some of your gear money for an external preamp.
You can find three types of preamps in the marketplace — solid-state,
vacuum tube, and hybrid — and each has its own characteristics. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explore some preamp styles and discuss how each relates
to the sounds that are produced by the types of microphones I discuss ear-
lier in the chapter. This can help you to understand the relationship between
the microphone and preamp in your studio.
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone.
These preamps can be designed to produce as clear and detailed a sound as
possible (often referred to as “transparent”) or can be designed to create a
pleasing level of distortion (warmth) to your music. Solid-state preamps cost
from a couple hundred to several thousand dollars.
A clean and clear solid-state preamp (such as the Earthworks or GML brands)
is a great choice if you want as natural a sound as possible on your recording
of an instrument or if you are using a microphone that has a sound quality
that you want to hear as clearly as possible. For example, I particularly like
the way that a solid-state preamp works in conjunction with a tube condenser
or ribbon mic. The warmth and smoothness of these types of microphones
shine through clearly with a clean solid-state preamp.
On the other hand, a more aggressive (warm or pleasingly distorted) solid-
state preamp, such as those modeled after the classic Neve designs, can add
just a touch of “grit” to certain instruments. These types of preamps are great
with dynamic, ribbon, or condenser mics, especially when recording drums,
guitar, and some vocals.
126
Part II: Recording 101 

Vacuum tube
These preamps use vacuum tubes to process and amplify the microphone’s
signal. This generally adds some coloration to the sound of your mic (how
much and what kind of coloration depends on the particular preamp). As
you’ve undoubtedly discovered after reading any other chapter in this book,
digital recording aficionados love the sound of tube gear, especially tube pre-
amps. The advantage of a tube preamp is that it can add a warm sound to
your mics. The disadvantage is that you often can’t get rid of this colored
sound. Professional recording engineers often have several tube preamps in
their studios to give them different coloration options.
The preamps that are included in your mixer are solid-state. If you find that you
want the colored sound of a tube preamp, you need to buy an external one.
Tube preamps are great for imparting a subtle low-frequency addition to the
sound of the microphone signal. Tube preamps also seem to slightly soften
the higher frequencies. If you’re like most people, you’ll like the addition of a
tube preamp, especially if you intend to record rock, blues, or acoustic jazz
music. The downside is that all-tube preamps are expensive, with the least
expensive costing about $1,000 (the Peavey VMP-2) and most running several
thousand dollars (brands like Manley Labs, for instance).
I prefer to use tube preamps with drums and any “woody” instrument (acoustic
guitar, for instance). In this case, I often reach for a large-diaphragm condenser
mic, and in extreme cases, I may even use a large-diaphragm tube condenser mic
with the tube preamp (for an extra dose of “tubiness”).
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components to boost the
mic’s signal. Most of the inexpensive (under $1,000) “tube” preamps that you
find in the marketplace are actually hybrids. An advantage to this design
approach is that the preamp can often be adjusted to have varying degrees of
that warm tube sound. The disadvantage is that these relatively inexpensive
tube preamps don’t have as clear a sound as a great solid-state preamp and
they don’t have quite the same pleasing character as an expensive all-tube
preamp.
For most home recordists, this type of preamp offers a lot of flexibility and
can allow you to get either the fairly clear, open sound of a solid-state preamp
or the warm, colored sound characteristic of a classic tube preamp. If you
can afford only one external preamp, one of these hybrid versions may be
right for you.
127
Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

The countless hybrid preamps on the market vary widely. (In fact, most of
the hybrid preamps are marketed as tube preamps.) Your best bet in choos-
ing a hybrid — or any preamp for that matter — is to do some research. Talk
to people, read reviews, visit Internet forums, and then audition the two or
three that stand out to you. Choose the one that you think sounds best for
your needs.
Considering Compressors
A compressor enables you to alter the dynamic range (that is, the difference
between the softest and loudest sound) of an instrument. Along with the
microphone and preamp, the compressor is often added to the signal chain
before it goes to the mixer. The advantage of using a compressor in the signal
chain before it hits the mixer is that you can control the transients and have
a hotter (higher) signal level going into the converters or recorder. This
hotter level used to be necessary when recording at 16 bits, but with 24-bit
recording, you don’t need to worry as much about getting the highest signal
into your system. I discuss setting optimal levels in more detail in Chapter 7.
If you record a lot of vocals or real drums, a decent external compressor may
be a good idea — just go easy with it (again check out Chapter 7). You can
find some great-sounding compressors for as little as $200. My favorite is the
FMR Audio RNC-1773 (a really nice unit).
As long as you’re looking at preamps and compressors, take a look at some
channel strip devices, which are integrated preamp, compressor, and equal-
izer combos. For some people (and maybe you), a channel strip device is the
way to go. It allows you to have just one unit, reducing the amount of cords,
and it’s designed to make the three parts function well together. Quite a few
great-sounding channel strip devices are available for under $500.
Analyzing Some Microphone Accessories
Along with your new mics, you’re going to need a few accessories. These
include mic cords, mic stands, and pop filters.
Microphone cords
Microphone cords can cost from about $10 to several hundred dollars. You’re
probably asking yourself, “Is there really a difference between a $10 or $20
mic cable and one that sells for hundreds of dollars?”
128
Part II: Recording 101 

My answer is, “Supposedly — but chances are, you’ll never hear it.” Let me
qualify this answer a little. Unless you have a very good mixer, recorder,
microphones, preamps, analog/digital and digital/analog converters, and
monitors, you’re wasting your money on expensive microphone cords. I know
only one sound engineer (not me though — I’ve spent too many years behind
the drums) who claims that he can hear the difference between an average
mic cord and one of the expensive ones. And even he says that the difference
is very subtle. (It would have to be; otherwise, I would hear the difference,
too.)
Don’t waste your money on an expensive mic cord (or any cord) until the
cord is the weakest link in your signal chain. By then, spending a couple hun-
dred dollars on a cord will seem trivial because you’ll already have invested
tens of thousands of dollars in top-quality gear.
Microphone stands
A sturdy mic stand is essential for your studio. Mic stands are relatively inex-
pensive, so resist the temptation to buy a flimsy one. A good mic stand has a
sturdy base and can securely hold your mics.
Good mic stands cost about $30 and have either a round cast iron base (great
for getting into tight spaces) or a tripod base. Either one works well.
Pop filters
A pop filter is a nylon screen that eliminates the “pops” (technically called
plosives) that singers make when they sing. Plosives are the result of sudden
bursts of air projected into the mic (from singing words starting with Ps and
Ts, for example). If you record vocals, a pop filter is a must-have.
Pop filters are relatively inexpensive (starting at about $20), but if you want
to make your own, use a pair of tights or pantyhose and a coat hanger. Bend
the coat hanger into a circle and stretch the nylons or pantyhose over it. You
can attach the coat hanger to the mic stand by using duct tape. Adjust the
coat hanger so that the pop filter is 4 to 6 inches away from the microphone,
and then have the vocalist sing through it. Check out Figure 6-8 to see a
homemade pop filter.

Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones

Caring for Your Microphones
After investing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in microphones, you
probably want to know how to take care of them properly. Caring for or stor-
ing your microphones isn’t rocket science. Just follow the general guidelines
and ideas that follow, and you’ll keep your mics in tip-top shape.
A good microphone lasts a lifetime. Take care of your mics, and they’ll give
you years of service.
Daily care
The most important thing to keep in mind when using your mics is to resist
the temptation to blow into them. I know you’ve probably seen someone on
stage blow into a mic and yell “Test” to see whether it is working. And you
figure that’s how the pros must check their mics. Well, it isn’t. Blowing into a
mic is a sure way to literally blow out the diaphragm in some mics, especially
those expensive ribbon mics. To determine whether a mic is working, just
speak into it in a normal voice.
Figure 6-8:

130
Part II: Recording 101 

You don’t need to blow or yell into any mic unless, of course, your singer’s
style is to yell into the mic and you’re trying to set the input level. In this
case, offer him or her your trusty dynamic mic and keep that expensive
ribbon mic hidden.
Another thing to remember when handling your mics is that they can be frag-
ile. Condenser and ribbon mics don’t survive rough handling well. In fact, if you
drop a condenser or ribbon mic, you may break it (this is another good reason
to have a sturdy stand). Dynamic mics, on the other hand, are more durable,
which is why they are often used for live applications and on drums. (It’s not
uncommon for an overzealous drummer to whack them by accident — as a
drummer, I know about this firsthand).
Try to keep your mics away from dust and high humidity. Dust is probably the
number-one enemy of a microphone because the dust can settle on the
diaphragm and reduce the sensitivity of the mic — and even alter its frequency
response. Always cover your mics or put them away when you’re not using
them.
Storage
Most professionals have mic lockers, where they can safely keep their mics
when they’re not in use. Mic lockers come in several varieties. You can make
a special locked box fitted with foam padding that has a cutout for each mic,
or you can keep your mics in their pouches or cases (if the mic came with a
case) in a closet or cabinet.
Regardless of the type of storage cabinet that you have, try to handle your
mics as little as possible. In fact, if you have a mic that you use a lot, I recom-
mend leaving it on a secure stand rather than repeatedly dragging it out of its
case or storage cabinet.
If you do leave your mic out on its stand, cover the mic with a plastic bag and
close the open end around the mic when it’s not in use (see Figure 6-9). This
keeps out the dust.
Humidity can also be a problem for microphones. If you live in a humid envi-
ronment, store your mics with a bag of silica gel next to them. (Silica gel,
which absorbs moisture, is the stuff that comes in the packaging of a lot of
electronic gear.) You can find silica gel listed as desiccant packets (Desi Paks)
by the manufacturer. You can order silica gel in quantities of as little as ten
from the following manufacturer:

tion marks) into your favorite search engine.

specifics of microphone placement for a variety of
common instruments to give you a leg up on getting

T
he quality of your recording relies heavily on two things: how your instru-
ments sound and how well you get that sound into your computer with-
out messing it up. The problem is that anyone can easily mess up the sound
or at least fall short of getting the best possible sound.
This chapter gives you the knowledge to keep bad sound — or sound that’s
not as good as it could be — from happening. In this chapter, I describe signal
flow and the role that it plays in shaping the sound of your instrument. I also
give you tips on how to get great guitar sounds and killer keyboard sounds
without hassle. To top it off, I spend a few pages getting you up to speed on
miking effectively.
Making Sense of the Signal Chain
The signal chain is the path that your sound travels from its creation (your
guitar, keyboard, or voice) to your recorder. This path often includes several
steps — and pieces of gear — that need to be optimized so that you don’t
end up with too much or too little sound going to your system. I cover the
flow of various signal chains in detail in Chapter 4, but here’s an overview of
the process. Figure 7-1 shows the straightforward signal chain for a mic going
into a studio-in-a-box recorder.

In this example, the sound originating from your voice enters the micro-
phone, travels to a preamp-equipped input in your device where it’s ampli-
fied, is converted into digital information within the device, and finally gets
sent into the recording software section of your recorder and the hard drive,
where it’s stored.
The key to a good instrument or mic sound is getting each signal in the chain
set to its optimal level. This particular signal chain involves just two places
where you can make adjustments to your signal levels, as follows:
 The source: In the example shown in Figure 7-1, the microphone’s place-
ment has a huge effect on the signal level that goes into your computer.
Moving the mic just a couple inches can have a significant impact on your
signal level at the preamp. A good, solid level keeps you from having to
crank up your preamp too far, which causes noise. If the level is too hot,
though — hot in the sense of a solid signal between –12dB and –6dB —
you risk getting distortion at the mic. This same concept holds true for
keyboards or other electronic instruments, as well as guitars plugged
directly into your interface.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 The preamp-equipped input: You adjust this level to get the right level in
your recorder. I discuss the optimal signal level for different systems in
the next section.
Setting Optimal Signal Levels
Getting a sound signal to the recorder takes several steps. The path that the
sound takes from the instrument or microphone to the recorder is called 
the signal chain (see the previous section). You need to be aware of the signal
level at all of these steps to get the best sound possible. Too much gain at one
stage forces you to reduce the gain at another. Likewise, too little gain at one
point may require you to overdrive (bump up the gain) during the next stage.
Incorrect gain structuring results in a signal that’s too low, which creates
noise, or a signal that’s too high, which causes distortion. In fact, with poor
gain structuring, you can have a signal that is both too quiet and distorted.
How you set the levels that you record to disk has a lot to do with how good
(or bad) your performance sounds. The key to getting good recording levels
is to get as hot (high) a signal as you can without going over the maximum
that the converter or recorder can handle. If you use analog tape, you have
some leeway in how hot your signal can get, but if you record digitally, you
don’t have that luxury. Anything over the baseline of 0dB is going to clip — a
nice recording term that means distort. 0dB, by the way, doesn’t mean “no
sound.” Instead it refers to the highest level that a digital system can handle
without clipping the signal.
How hot is hot enough, you ask? Well, it depends on who you talk to and at
what bit depth you record. Because you’re reading my book, here’s my take
on the best levels at which to record:
 16-bit systems: By this point in the book (assuming that you’ve read
other sections on digital recording), you know that I’m not a fan of 16-bit
recording. This is because to record with enough headroom, you need to
turn the incoming level down so much that you start to lose sound qual-
ity; that is, you’re using fewer than 16 bits and lowering the resolution of
your system. In this case, I usually recommend setting your level higher
in a 16-bit system than in a 24-bit system — usually with peaks no higher
than –6dB. This allows some room for transients (check out the section
“Making the Most of Microphones,” later in this chapter) while preserv-
ing as much resolution as possible.
 24-bit systems: Because plenty of bits are available, you have more
wiggle room before you start to lose sound quality. For 24-bit systems, I
suggest that you record with your peak level at or below –12dB. This
gives you enough room for transients to sneak through without clipping
your system.
137
Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound

138
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
When you set your recording levels (do this by playing a section of your
song), keep the following points in mind:
 Keep an eye on the clip light on your preamp/input. Not all inputs have
a clip light, but if yours does, it’s most likely located next to the trim knob.
Sending too hot a signal through your preamp/input is the first way you
can create distortion. Your clip light should illuminate only faintly once in
a while, if at all. If your clip light is glowing red, your signal is way too hot,
and you may end up with distortion. (Check the owner’s manual for your
preamp to see when the clip light is set to activate. Some clip lights are set
to go off at –6dB, others illuminate at –3dB, and still others light at 0dB.)
 Use the meters as a guide. Both your mixer and recorder have meters
that show you the level of the signal going in. Both of these levels are
important, so keep an eye on them. Make sure that the meters never go
above 0dB and that they peak out at a maximum of –12dB to –6dB. Also,
be aware of whether you’re monitoring pre or post levels, which I dis-
cuss in the next section.
 Trust your ears. Even with the clip light and meters, you still need to
listen carefully to the signal. Many of the level meters on digital recorders
are fairly slow to respond and can often miss sudden, extreme transients.
If you hear any clipping or occasional harshness in the sound, turn the
level down, regardless of what your meters tell you.
 When in doubt, turn down the level. If you can’t tell whether the
sound is clean, don’t be afraid to turn the level down a little. Recording
at –16dB instead of –12dB isn’t going to ruin your track, but a clipped
note can.
The straight-line rule
Most professional engineers are taught to
record by using the straight-line rule. This rule
comes from the old days of analog recording. It
is thought of as being not only good engineer-
ing practice but also a courtesy to any other
engineer who may handle your tracks.
The straight-line rule basically involves setting
up your input levels so that they roughly match
the levels that you want when you mix the song.
You do this by setting your channel fader at 0dB
(also marked as Unity on some mixers) and
adjusting your input gain (the trim knob on your
mixer or preamp) until you have a clean signal
(no distortion) on the recorder’s meters. The
signal’s level needs to be approximately the
same as the level of the instrument in the final
mix. For some instruments, such as a snare drum,
the level peaks close to 0dB, but on other instru-
ments, such as the string section, the level may
be near –10dB. If you follow the straight-line rule,
when you’re ready to mix your tracks, set all your
faders at 0dB — and you’ll have a rough mix.
The courtesy is that if someone then takes your
recorded tracks to another system with another
engineer, that engineer only has to set the
faders at 0dB and everything is ready for final
adjustments.

Understanding Pre and Post Levels
Most digital systems provide several options for monitoring meter levels. You
can have prefader input levels, postfader input levels, prefader track levels,
postfader track levels, and master bus levels (see Figure 7-2). Even with the
same signal, different kinds of levels (prefader, postfader, input, track master
bus, and so on) may end up showing different readings on your meters.

Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound

Interpreting the various levels
I try to clear up what all these different levels mean in the following list:
 Prefader input levels: The prefader input level shows you the level of
the signal going into the mixer’s channel strip before the signal hits the
EQ or fader (hence the term prefader). Your sound source and trim
adjustment (either on the mixer or a separate preamp) control the level
shown on this meter.
If your signal is too low or too hot and you don’t have a separate preamp,
adjust the trim knob on your mixer. If you’re using a separate preamp,
adjust the trim knob on your outboard preamp. You can also make adjust-
ments to this level at the sound source. This could be either the output
level of your instrument or the placement of your microphone.
 Postfader input levels: The postfader input level shows your signal level
after the signal has traveled through the input channel’s channel strip,
that is, after the EQ and fader settings.
This level is different from the prefader input level only if your fader is
somewhere other than unity gain (or 0dB) or if you’ve made some
adjustments to the EQ. To be specific, if you’ve removed any frequencies
with the EQ or set your fader below 0dB, your postfader level is lower
than the prefader level. Likewise, if you’ve added frequencies with the
EQ or placed your fader above unity, your level is higher than it was
going in.
 Prefader track levels: This is the most important level of your input
signal chain (that is, if a most important level exists). This meter shows
you what is actually recorded to the hard drive of the recorder.
If you’re using an analog mixer and a stand-alone recorder, you see this
level on the recorder, not the mixer.
This level matches the level of the postfader input channel routed to the
recorder channel. If you have more than one input channel routed to a
recorder track, this level is generally higher than each of the individual
input postfader levels. This is because the signals combine to produce a
higher overall level (called summing). If this is the case and the prefader
track level is too high, you need to adjust the levels on all the tracks that
are routed to this channel in order to drop the level coming in (the submix
fader level, if you have these tracks run through the submix bus).
 Postfader track levels: The postfader track level shows you the level
after you make adjustments to the track channel’s fader or EQ settings.
Like the postfader input level, the postfader track level is different from
the prefader track level if you’ve made adjustments to either the EQ 
or the channel fader settings.
140
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 Master bus levels: This level shows you the sum of all the levels being
routed to the master bus. Unless you have only one channel going to the
master bus, this level is different than any of the individual levels going
to it because all levels from all the instruments are taken into account
(summed). This is the level that is most important when you’re mixing
because this is the level that the 2-track master records.
Not all types of systems have all these level-monitoring options. For example,
if you have an analog mixer, you may not have meters on anything except the
recorder (prefader track level) and the master bus (master bus level).
Looking at some examples
You can use the various monitoring sources to find out where in your signal
chain you may be introducing distortion or where you need to boost the
signal. If you find the source of the signal problem, you don’t have to over-
compensate at a different part of the signal path. For example, perhaps you
connect a microphone to an external preamp and set the trim on the preamp
for a good, hot signal. The prefader track level going to the recorder, how-
ever, is too low. In this case, you can check the postfader input level to see
whether something is squashing your signal. The fader may be set too low, or
some EQ may be set to reduce some frequencies. To fix the problem, you can
either raise the fader or adjust your EQ until your level at the prefader track
meter is where you want it to be.
Another scenario is when you have a recorded track that has even levels (as
seen on the prefader track level) but you’re getting distortion at the master
bus (master bus level). In this case, check the postfader track level to see
whether it looks different than the prefader level. It most likely will, and you
can fix the problem by adjusting either the fader or the EQ until the level is
tamed. If both the prefader and postfader track levels look the same, the
combined levels that come from more than one track to the master bus are
probably causing the distortion. In this case, you need to reduce the levels
from all the tracks going to the master bus to bring the master bus level
down a bit.
Don’t get too stressed about your levels. Use your ears and trust yourself. If
you get noticeable digital clipping (distortion), just record the part again.
One of the great things about digital recording is that you can erase and rere-
cord a performance as many times as you want without compromising sound
quality.

Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound

Getting a Great Guitar Sound
Do you wanna know how to get the absolute best, most rich, engaging guitar
sound? Well, I wish I could tell you, but alas I can’t. This is something you’re
going to need to figure out by listening as you tweak your gear. That said, you
can get your sound into your computer in four ways, and each way has its
plusses and minuses, as I describe in the following list:
 Directly from your guitar into your instrument input: The instrument
input in your system could be located in your analog mixer (stand-
alone systems), your recorder (SIAB systems), or your audio interface
(computer-based systems). This assumes that your instrument input
can handle a direct connection from a guitar. (Most can, but check to
make sure that the one you have or want has this capability. If it doesn’t,
you need to get a direct box to put between your guitar and your instru-
ment input. I talk about direct boxes in Chapter 1.) By using this method,
the sound you get from your guitar is pretty much the same sound
you’re going to get recorded.
You may not like the sound — in fact, I’ll bet you won’t. The solution to
this unfortunate state of affairs is to use a plug-in (or more than one) in
your recording program to get the sound you want. This is a common
way to get a guitar sound, and tons of good plug-ins can help, including
plug-ins for providing distortion, delay, chorus, and even special amp
simulators that are designed to sound like popular guitar amplifiers. One
advantage to this approach is that you can tweak the sound of your
guitar as much as you want after it’s recorded. The disadvantage is that
you can easily become afflicted with indecision disorder and be unable
to pick the sound you want. Also, many guitar-tone connoisseurs feel
that getting the sound this way isn’t as good as miking up an amp with
the sound you want.
 From your guitar to an amp simulator and from the amp simulator
into your instrument input: Amp simulators are like the plug-ins that
you can get for your software, only they’re stand-alone units that already
have the various sounds in them. A bunch of stand-alone amp simula-
tors are available on the market, and most offer decent simulations of
the most popular guitar amps. This can be a good solution for many
people, but the disadvantage of doing this — instead of adding your
effects in the computer — is that after you record your sound through
an amp simulator, you’re stuck with that sound. Of course, if you often
get hit with indecision disorder, this may be a good solution for you.
 From your guitar into your amp and from your amp’s line output to
your instrument input: Recording a guitar this way is great for people
who have an amp that they like the sound of but who don’t want to mic
a speaker. When you follow this approach, you have three volume con-
trols to adjust to get your level into your recorder — your guitar, your
amp, and your interface. You may have to take some time tweaking these
settings to get the best possible sound.
142
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 From your guitar into your amp with a mic picking up the speaker’s
sound: This is the old standby approach because you get to record the
actual sound you’re used to hearing coming out of your amp. With this
method, having the right mic and mic placement makes all the difference
in the world. I offer some specific guitar-amping mic techniques in
Chapter 9.
There is no single way to get a great guitar sound. Don’t be afraid to experi-
ment. You may just come up with a sound that really moves you.
Creating a Killer Keyboard Sound
The key to getting a killer keyboard sound is making sure that you get the
sound into your system without messing it up (no pressure here). Depending
on your gear, keyboard sounds can be brought into your system in one of the
following ways:
 Using the analog outputs in your keyboard: For an external keyboard
that contains the sounds you want to record, plug an instrument cord
from the main outputs of your keyboard to the corresponding number of
inputs in your system. Turn your keyboard volume up between 1⁄2 and 3⁄4
or until you get a decent signal to register in your recorder. If your
instrument input has a volume (gain) control, adjust it and the volume of
your keyboard until you get a solid sound without distortion.
Follow the guidelines that I list in the section “Setting Optimal Signal
Levels,” earlier in this chapter, to get your best signal levels.
 Recording MIDI data and adding the sound later: If you have a MIDI-
capable keyboard and a MIDI sequencer, you can record your musical
performance as MIDI data and assign the sound later. In this case, con-
nect your keyboard to your MIDI sequencer. This can be done using a
MIDI cable connected to MIDI ports in each device, or it can be done
with a USB connection if you have a USB-equipped keyboard and MIDI
sequencer (such as a software program in a computer). Chapter 5
explains how to make the connections for this.
Because you’re recording MIDI data instead of an audio signal, you don’t
need to worry about setting the record level. Chapter 12 explains the
process of recording MIDI sequences in detail.
Making the Most of Microphones
Finding a great sound from a mic is key to getting a great-sounding recording.
To do this, you need to use the best mic for the application and place it
where it can sound its best. This requires not only knowledge of the different
143
Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound

types of mics that are available (see Chapter 6) but also an understanding of
how these mics are used for a variety of instruments (see Chapter 9). In the
following sections, I give you a quick tutorial on setting optimal levels of your
microphones to help you get the most out of the mics and techniques I pre-
sent in the other miking chapters.
The most difficult part of getting a good sound by using a microphone is deal-
ing with sudden, extreme increases in the sound signal. These blips are called
transients, and they regularly happen when a drum is first struck, when a
vocalist sings certain syllables (for example, those that begin with a P), and
when a guitar player picks certain notes. In fact, because you can’t always
control the amount of force that you apply to an instrument, transients can
happen at any time, with any instrument, and without warning. (Highly
trained musicians produce fewer extreme transients because they have a
greater mastery over their muscular movements.)
In digital recording, all it takes is one slight, unexpected note to cause clip-
ping and distortion, ruining what may otherwise be a perfect musical perfor-
mance. Believe me, nothing is so heart-wrenching as listening to the perfect
take (recorded performance) and hearing the unmistakable sound of digital
distortion. Although you can’t eliminate transients (they are part of an instru-
ment’s character), you can tame extreme transients that often cause clipping
(distortion). You can do this in the following three ways:
 Set your levels with enough headroom to handle these transients. I
cover this step in the section “Setting Optimal Signal Levels,” earlier in
this chapter.
 Minimize transients with proper mic placement. I explain this process
in the next section.
 Run the signal through a compressor when recording. The section
“Compressing carefully,” later in this chapter, gives you the lowdown on
this process.
Placing mics properly
A microphone that’s placed too close to a loud sound source or pointed too
directly toward the point of attack can easily pick up extreme transients. In
most cases, you just need to pull the mic away from the instrument a little or
turn it ever so slightly to avoid a signal that’s too high. I don’t go into detail
here because I cover mic placement thoroughly in Chapter 9.
The main thing to keep in mind when placing your microphones is to experi-
ment. Don’t be afraid to spend time making small adjustments. After all, the
track you save could be your own.
144
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Compressing carefully
Compressors are processors that allow you to control the dynamics of a
signal — and boy, are they ever versatile. You can use compressors on the
front end while tracking (recording) instruments to make sure that you don’t
have stray transients. You can use them to level off an erratic performance.
And you can use compressors to raise the overall apparent level of a mixed
song. In the following sections, I discuss the first use of compression: the
control of transients. (You can find out about the other ways to use compres-
sion in Chapters 14 and 15.)
If you have an SIAB (studio-in-a-box) system or a computer-based system,
you probably have a compressor included with the effects in the unit.
Although you can use this compressor to track with, your signal has to go
through the A/D converter first. (The A/D converter changes your signal from
analog to digital form.) Because these systems are digital, the A/D converter
is the first in line after the preamp. This often defeats the purpose of using a
compressor to control transients because the A/D converter is where you
often get your first dose of distortion. If you’re serious about using compres-
sion on the front end to tame transients, you may want to insert an external
preamp into the signal chain before the A/D converter.
Getting to know compressor parameters
Compressors have a series of dials that allow you to adjust several parame-
ters. They are as follows:
 Threshold: The threshold setting dictates the level that the compressor
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in decibels (dB). For the most
part, you should set the threshold level so that the compressor acts
only on the highest peaks of the signal.
 Ratio: The ratio is the amount that the compressor affects the signal.
The ratio — such as 2:1, for instance — means that for every decibel
that the signal goes over the threshold setting, it is reduced by two deci-
bels. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor will only be 1⁄2dB louder. The ratio is the one
parameter that varies considerably from instrument to instrument
because the level of the transient varies.
 Attack: The attack knob controls how soon the compressor starts, well,
compressing. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and the lower
the number, the faster the attack. For the most part, you’re trying to con-
trol transients, and they happen at the beginning of a note. Therefore,
you should set the attack to act quickly.
 Release: The release parameter controls how long the compressor contin-
ues affecting the note after the note starts. Like the attack, the release is
defined in milliseconds. Because transients don’t last for very long, you
usually use a short release time when using compression on the front end.
145
Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound

 Gain: The gain knob allows you to adjust the level of the signal coming
out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels. Because adding com-
pression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use this
control to raise the level back to where it was going in.
 Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of
choosing between a hard knee and a soft knee (or they do it for you
based on the setting that you’ve chosen). Hard knee and soft knee each
refer to how the compressor behaves as the input signal passes the
threshold. More details descriptions are as follows:
• Hard knee applies the compression at an even rate, regardless of
the level present over the threshold. So if you choose a compression
setting of 4:1, the compressor applies this ratio for any signal over
the threshold limit. Hard knee compression is used for instruments
like drums, where you need to quickly clamp down on transients.
• Soft knee applies the compression at a varying rate depending on
the amount the signal is over the threshold setting. The compres-
sor gradually increases the ratio of the compression as the signal
crosses the threshold until it hits the level that you set. Soft knee
compression is used on vocals and other instruments where the
signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Creating compressor settings
When you use a compressor to keep transients at bay, you only want to com-
press the highest transient levels — the ones that would overload your
system or eat up your headroom — and you want to do this so that you don’t
hear the compressor kicking in. Even though every instrument contains dif-
ferent levels of transient signals and each person who plays an instrument
creates different amounts of extreme transients when he or she plays, here
are some things to keep in mind as you create your settings:
 Keep the threshold high. With a high threshold setting, your compressor
only kicks in as the signal gets close to distorting. For most instruments, I
would use a setting of about –6dB. Some instruments with very high tran-
sients, such as percussion and drums, can handle a setting like –10dB. Set
your threshold so that when the extreme transient happens, it only trig-
gers the compressor a couple of decibels, and the nontransient material
(the main sound of the instrument) doesn’t trigger the compressor.
 Adjust the ratio to the material. For high-transient material (such as
drums and percussion), choose a higher ratio, and for lower-transient
material (like strummed or bowed string instruments), choose a lower
ratio setting. Try to use a ratio that relates to the level of the transient
over the nontransient signal. Because percussion instruments have ini-
tial signal peaks (transients) that are much stronger than the body of the
instrument’s sound, you can compress this peak without affecting the
main sound of the instrument. By matching the ratio to the degree of the
transient this way, you can create a more even level without changing
the sound characteristics of the instrument.
146
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 Use a short attack. Transients happen at the initial attack of the instru-
ment. This means that if you want to compress the transient, the com-
pressor must kick in right away when this signal happens. A setting of 1
millisecond or less is optimal.
 Use a short release. Transients happen quickly and they last a very
short amount of time. When you try to control these signals during
tracking, you only want to catch the transient itself — and no other part
of the instrument’s sound. Setting a short release time — start with
about 10 milliseconds — ensures that your compressor doesn’t linger on
to affect the body of the instrument.
 Don’t mess with the gain. Because you’re only catching the highest
transient signals and you’re only compressing them a tiny bit, you don’t
need to add or reduce any of the signal that’s going through the com-
pressor. Leave the gain control at 0dB.
When using a compressor during tracking, keep the following two points in
mind:
 You can always add compression to a recorded track, but you can
never take it away. If you’re not sure how much compression to apply
to a particular situation, you’re much better off erring on the side of too
little because you can always run the sound through another compres-
sor later.
 If you can hear a change in the sound of your signal, you probably
have the compressor set too high. The reason that you use a compres-
sor on the front end is to eliminate extreme transients, which you can’t
hear when you play. If your compression setting changes the sound, you
should slightly reduce the compression setting (unless you’re going for
that effect).

T
o record acoustic instruments — that is, any instrument that doesn’t
have an electronic output — you need to use a microphone. The sound
that you ultimately get can vary considerably based on where you place the
mic in relation to the instrument and the room that you record in. I spend
quite a bit time — three chapters, in fact — talking about microphones
because they’re so important to the quality of your final recordings. See
Chapters 6 and 9 for more miking details.
In this chapter, I take a look at some of the most common microphone tech-
niques that are used in professional recording. You get a chance to see, up
close, how spot miking works. You also get a broad view of distant miking
and take a look at the big picture on ambient miking. As well, this chapter
explores some common stereo miking techniques and explains what to look
for when combining these various approaches.
Regardless of the style of microphone that you use or the type of instrument
that you record, you can use one or more of the following mic-placement
techniques to capture the sound that you want:
 Spot (or close) miking: Put your microphone within inches of the sound
source.
 Distant miking: Pull your mic back a few feet from the sound.

 Ambient miking: Place your mic way back in a room.
 Stereo miking: Set up two mics at various distances from one another.
 Combined miking: Use a combination of the four traditional placement
strategies listed here.
This chapter introduces you to the four traditional mic-placement strategies
that are used in recording. You discover the characteristics and purposes of
each of these four methods and gain an understanding of how each relates to
a particular tonal or sound quality. I also discuss how you can combine these
strategies.
Singling Out Spot Miking
Spot miking (also called close miking) involves placing your microphone
within a couple of feet of the sound source. Home recordists use this tech-
nique most often because it adds little of the room (the reverb and delay) to
the recorded sound. Figure 8-1 shows the close miking placement.

150
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Spot miking tends to create a less natural sound and can compromise the
quality of your recordings if you’re not careful. It can also offer you some
advantages if you record multiple instruments in one pass or if your room
doesn’t sound good. Here are some things to consider when using spot
miking:
 Transients are more extreme. Distance from a sound source tames the
initial attack of an instrument. Spot miking picks up more transient mate-
rial, which can make the sound of the instrument seem harsh and can
overload your mic, preamp, or converter without your seeing it on your
level meters. You need to listen closely to your recorded sound to make
sure that you don’t have distortion. A solution to this problem is to
move the mic back a bit or point it slightly away from the instrument.
 The room isn’t part of the recording. This can be good or bad depend-
ing on the sound of your room:
• On the plus side, it can keep a bad-sounding room from ruining the
sound of your track by putting it so far in the background of the
recording that it isn’t really heard on your tracks.
• On the downside, you lose the natural ambience of an instrument
that gives it its character, so if you have a nice-sounding room, this
technique may not be the best choice (depending on how many
instruments are playing at once — see the next bullet).
 You can isolate each instrument. Spot miking can help you keep multi-
ple instruments separated in your tracks, so if you record your band
live, you can create some isolation among instruments. (This assumes
that you use a microphone with a cardioid polar pattern. Chapter 6 has
more details on this). This makes mixing a lot easier. Because of the
downside that I list in the previous bullet, I’m a big fan of using room
mics (using the ambient technique described in the section “Assessing
Ambient Miking,” later in this chapter) in conjunction with spot mics to
create a more realistic sound.
 Even minor adjustments in mic placement can have a huge impact on
your recorded sound. Because the mic is so close to the sound source,
small adjustments to the mic’s placement make a noticeable difference,
and the mic may not capture the complete sound of the instrument.
Finding the spot that sounds the best may take you a while.
 The closer you put your mic, the more bass you record. I mention this in
Chapter 6, but it bears repeating here. As you move a mic with a cardioid
polar pattern in close to the sound source, the mic picks up more bass
energy. This is called the proximity effect. It can be an advantage for some
applications — rounding out the sound of a vocal, for instance — but it
can also cause problems with some instruments such as acoustic strings,
where you don’t want the extra bass muddying the sound. To counter this
effect, use an omnidirectional or figure-8 mic or move the cardioid-pattern
mic away from the sound source until the bass is more manageable. (See
Chapter 6 for a rundown of the different types of mics.)
151
Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques

Detailing Distant Miking
When you use distant miking, you place mics about 3 or 4 feet away from the
sound source, as shown in Figure 8-2. Distant miking enables you to capture
some of the sound of the room along with the instrument. An example of a
distant-miking technique is the overhead drum mic. With it, you can pick up
the whole drum set to some extent. Coupling the distant mic with a few select
spot mics, you can record a natural sound.
Distant miking has its plusses and minuses. Here are some things to remem-
ber if you use this technique:
 You can get a more natural sound. By moving the mic back a few feet
from its source, you give the instrument a chance to breathe a bit and
allow the sound to blend a little with the room in which it’s played. You
also eliminate the impact of the proximity effect (see the previous sec-
tion) and correct the balance between the body of the instrument’s
sound and the transient from the initial attack. This often creates a more
pleasing, natural sound.
 Other instruments may bleed into your track. If you record more than
one instrument at the same time, distant miking increases the bleed of
other instruments into the track of the instrument that you want to
record. The solution to this is to use the spot-miking technique instead,
move the instruments farther apart, adjust the mics so that the blind
spot of the mic is facing the instrument you don’t want to record, or
place gobos (acoustic baffles, as discussed Chapter 3) between the
instruments.
 The sound of the room is important. With the mic farther away from
the instrument, more of the room sound is picked up in relation to the
Figure 8-2:

phone is

4 feet from

ment in the

152
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

instrument. As a result, you hear more of the room in your tracks. This
can be nice if your room sounds good, but it can get in the way if your
room doesn’t.
 Multiple mics can cause phase problems. Whenever you use more than
one mic on a source such as a band or drum set, the relationship of these
mics to the source and to one another plays a significant role in the sound
you get. If the mics are not placed properly, some frequencies may drop
out. Called phase cancellation, this is the result of the recorded waveforms
reaching each mic at slightly different times. The sidebar “Problems with
stereo miking” and the section “Creating Miking Combinations,” later in
this chapter, explain this phenomenon in more detail.
Assessing Ambient Miking
Ambient miking is simply placing the mic far enough away from the sound
source so that you capture more of the room sound (the reverb and delay)
than the sound of the actual instrument (see Figure 8-3). You may place the
mic a couple of feet away from the source but pointed in the opposite direc-
tion, or you may place it across the room. You can even put the mic in an
adjacent room, although I admit this is an unorthodox technique. The dis-
tance that you choose varies from instrument to instrument.
Ambient miking definitely has its place, but using this technique requires
some forethought. Consider the following items when you use this technique:
 You lose the attack of the instrument. Because the mic is so far from
the sound source, it picks up more of the ambience of the room than the
attack of the instrument (hence the name of the technique). To counter
this effect, use distant or spot mics for the instruments that you want to
have a more pronounced presence and blend these mics with the ambi-
ent mic when you mix.
 You need a good room. Ambient miking relies on the sound of the room
to create a pleasing ambience. If your room doesn’t sound great, you’re
better off using a closer miking technique instead. On the other hand, if
you can find a great room in which to record — a church or auditorium,
for instance — setting up a mic in the middle of the room (you must
listen for the best placement by walking around the room as the music
plays) can give your tracks that extra something that can set them apart
from the run-of-the-mill home recordings.
 Placement is key. Just as each instrument has a sweet spot, each room
has a place that sounds best. Take your time finding this location and
put your ambient mic there.
153
Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques

 Watch for phase problems. Because an ambient mic is typically used in
conjunction with another mic or two (or more), you must keep the rela-
tionship among the mics correct; otherwise, you’ll have problems with
the phase of the recorded waveforms.
Ambient mic placement works well in those places where the room adds to
the sound of the instrument. The sound that you record is ambient (hence
the name). If you mix an ambient mic with a spot mic, you can end up with a
natural reverb. So if your room doesn’t add to the sound of the instrument,
you’re better off not using an ambient mic. You can always add a room sound
by using effects in the mixing process (see Chapter 15 for more details).

Selecting Stereo Miking
Stereo miking involves using two mics to capture the stereo field of the instru-
ment. You find a variety of stereo-miking techniques and some pretty compli-
cated ways of using two mics to record. The three most common approaches
are X-Y (coincident) pairs, the Blumlein technique, and spaced pairs. You can
also find stereo mics that do a good job of capturing the stereo field of an
instrument.
Stereo miking has the advantage of capturing a fairly natural stereo image,
though not as good as what your ears capture. When you listen to perfor-
mances that were recorded with well-placed stereo miking, you can hear
exactly where each instrument performed on the stage. Of course, such won-
derful stereo miking is an art. You can’t just set up a couple of mics in a room
and automatically get a good stereo sound. Capturing a stereo image with
two mics requires some careful planning.
X-Y pairs
X-Y (coincident) stereo miking consists of using two mics that are placed
right next to each other so that the diaphragms are as close together as pos-
sible without touching one another. X-Y stereo miking is the most common
type of stereo mic setup and the one that you’ll likely use if you do stereo
miking. Figure 8-4 shows a basic X-Y setup. Notice how the mics in this figure
are attached to a special mounting bracket. This bracket makes positioning
the mics easy.

Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques

When you record using the X-Y technique, keep these points in mind:
 The stereo image (the placement of the instruments in the sonic envi-
ronment) isn’t as wide or realistic as it is in real life. The X-Y tech-
nique is easy to set up and get a decent sound, so like all things in life,
you have to deal with the compromise this ease creates. No solution to
this exists, so if a wide stereo image is important to you, consider using
a different stereo technique, such as the spaced pair or perhaps a
Jecklin disk. (For details on building a Jecklin disk for less than $20, visit
my Web site — www.jeffstrong.com.)
 Don’t use two mics when one is enough. After you get a pair of nice
mics to do some X-Y miking, you’ll want to use them on everything. A
stereo-mic approach to a classical guitar composition is nice, but hon-
estly, recording the acoustic guitar in a rock ballad with five other instru-
ments playing isn’t necessary and just makes life more complicated
when you mix the song (see the section “Creating Miking Combinations,”
later in this chapter).
 Keep some distance between the mics and the sound source. The X-Y
technique has no benefit over a single mic if you place your mics within
a couple feet of the sound source. You simply don’t have enough space
for a stereo image to develop until you’re at least 6 feet from the instru-
ment or group of instruments. In fact, I would be at least 10 feet from the
sound source before I use this approach.
Blumlein technique
The Blumlein technique is named after Alan Dower Blumlein, who patented this
approach in 1931. Blumlein stereo miking involves placing two figure-8 mics in
much the same way as the X-Y pattern (at right angles to one another with the
diaphragms as close together as possible). The two mics are mounted on sepa-
rate stands, one above the other. Figure 8-5 shows this technique.
The advantage of this technique is that the figure-8 mics pick up signals from
both the front and back. This produces a natural sound. You also don’t have
to contend with proximity effects (enhanced bass response due to being
close to the sound source) because figure-8 mics don’t produce these effects.
Here are some suggestions for when you should use this technique:
 The room sound is important. Because the Blumlein technique uses
figure-8 mics that can pick up the sound on the other side of the mics
than your instruments, you end up recording quite a bit of room sound
with your instruments. This is one of the reasons that this technique
sounds as good as it does, but your room must add to the quality of
your sound, not hinder it.
156
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 Find the best place in the room. Take some time to find the best place
to put the mics. The placement may not be in the center of the room or
the front of the band. Instead, it may be off to one side or closer to the
back or front. This advice holds true for all miking, but with the Blumlein
technique (or when using omnidirectional mics with the other tech-
niques), correct mic placement can make the difference between a
decent recording and a truly awesome one.
 Get a sturdy stand that can handle both mics. Using two stands to hold
both mics makes moving them around (to find the sweet spot in the
room) a real pain in the you-know-what. You can easily find mic-stand
adapters that hold both mics. These can be an invaluable investment.
Spaced pairs
Spaced-pair stereo miking involves placing two mics at a distance in front of
the instrument(s) that you want to record and at a distance from one another.
This approach can work well if you record an ensemble that takes up a lot of
room. Figure 8-6 shows a top view of a typical spaced-pair stereo mic setup.

on separate stands, one
above the other.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Problems with stereo miking
When you do stereo miking, watch out for
phase cancellation and poor stereo imaging. I
describe these thorny issues in the following
paragraphs.
Phase cancellation happens when the two
microphones are placed so that they each
receive the sound at slightly different times.
When this occurs, you don’t hear the bass as
well because the low frequencies drop off.
Improper mic placement or two mics that are
out of phase with one another can cause phase
cancellation.
Most digital recorders have a phase switch that
allows you to reverse the phase of the signal
(even after it’s recorded). To test whether two
mics are out of phase, just reverse the phase on
one mic (don’t do both) and listen to see whether
the low frequencies become more apparent:
 If they do, you’ve corrected the problem and
you’re good to go.
 If this doesn’t correct the problem, try
changing cords on one of the mics because
some mic cords are wired differently than
others. If this doesn’t work either, you need
to adjust the relationship between the two
mics. Just move one mic around a little and
listen for changes in the bass response.
When the missing bass appears, you know
you’ve solved the problem.
Poor stereo imaging occurs when you can’t tell
where things fall from left to right (or right to left,
if that’s the way you think) or when you can’t
hear a clear center point in the sound. Poor
stereo imaging is a little more difficult to correct
than phase cancellation, but you can fix it.
The solution depends on the stereo-miking
technique that you use. If you use the X-Y tech-
nique, you’ve probably placed your mics too
close to the sound source. If you use the
spaced-pair technique, you’ve probably placed
the mics too close to one another in relation to
the distance from the instruments. In either
case, adjusting the placement of your mics
should clear up the problem.

Keep the following things in mind when using the spaced-pair stereo-miking
technique:
 Follow the rule. One of the most important things to consider when
stereo miking with spaced pairs is that you will experience phase prob-
lems if you don’t space the mics properly. Fortunately, experienced
recordists have discovered a basic guideline that makes it easier to place
the mics. Called the 3:1 rule, this guideline says that you should place the
mics three times farther apart than they are from the sound source.
Doing so minimizes potential phase problems.
 Break the rule if necessary. As handy as the 3:1 rule is, it isn’t foolproof.
At times, this rule doesn’t produce the best sound. In the next chapter, I
offer one of these instances for placing drum overheads in a three-mic
technique. Use the rule as a guide, but trust your ears to determine the
best place to put a spaced pair of mics (or a single mic, pair, or group 
of mics).
Stereo microphones
If you want to record an instrument in stereo and don’t want the hassle of
learning how to set up stereo pairs, you can use a stereo mic. Stereo mics
have two diaphragms in them and use a special cord that allows you to
record the output from each diaphragm on a separate track. An inexpensive
stereo condenser mic is shown in Figure 8-7. This type of microphone acts
like an X-Y pair, so follow the guidelines and suggestions that I offer in the
section “X-Y pairs,” earlier in this chapter, when using one of these.

Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques

Creating Miking Combinations
Many times, you’ll want to use more than one mic. The possible combina-
tions are almost limitless: You can use several spot mics on one instrument,
you can use a spot mic and an ambient mic, you can have a distant mic and a
spot mic, or . . . well, you get my point. As exciting as these possibilities can
be, keep the following points in mind to get the best sound when you com-
bine multiple mics:
 Be aware of phase relationships. Each mic interacts with all the other
ones when you record, and you need to take the time to set up each
mic so that it doesn’t interfere with any others. This means honoring
the 3:1 rule for stereo mics (see the section “Spaced pairs,” earlier in
this chapter). The only way to ensure that your phase is good is to
record a snippet of a song (or a whole song if you want) and then listen
to your tracks.
Listen to each mic individually and then together to see whether any fre-
quencies drop out. If frequencies drop out, finding the problem mics will
take some detective work. You need to play pairs of mics that you
recorded and until you find the problem; then you need to adjust each
mic until the problem goes away. If you do this enough, you’ll get pretty
good at placing mics and making phase relationships work.
 Be aware of bleed between mics. This is mainly for bands that want to
play together while still maintaining as much isolation as possible. A
string quartet rarely needs isolation because all the instruments blend
well together live; this blending is integral to the overall sound.
However, a rock band with miked amps usually needs enough isolation
so that you can do some tweaking to each instrument when you mix.
As well, a band that plays well together and can nail the performances
can have more bleed, whereas a band with a marginal player or two (you
know whether you have one in your band) that needs to perform addi-
tional takes or punch-ins to fix a weak performance requires much more
isolation. Doing a punch-in of your bass player (for instance, someone
who flubbed a few notes into a live bleed-filled performance) can sound
wrong in the mix.
 Use only as many mics as you need. Every additional mic that you add
to your setup complicates your recording process considerably. To keep
things simple, use as few mics as possible to get the sound that you want.
If you’re using a digital recorder, it probably has a phase switch that enables
you to fix the phase problems later if you missed them as you recorded. This
isn’t as optimal as recording without this problem, but it may allow you to
save an otherwise good set of tracks.

Miking Your Instruments
In This Chapter
 Exploring microphone techniques
 Miking drums
 Miking amplified instruments
 Miking acoustic instruments
T
he location of a microphone in relation to your instrument or a singer has
a huge impact on the sound of your recording. In fact, just a movement of
an inch or two or even a slight turn of the mic can bring out different charac-
teristics in the sound. The art of placing mics is one that you will undoubt-
edly spend a lifetime discovering.
In this chapter, you discover the fundamentals of using microphones to get a
good source sound. You explore tried-and-true miking methods along with
some practical miking tips and tricks that you can use right away. You also
examine the use of compression and mic placement to control and eliminate
transients — the usual peaks in the instrument’s sound.
In Chapter 7, I present ways to get the best sound from your mics and to keep
extreme transients from ruining an otherwise nice recording by overloading
your inputs and clipping your audio, so check it out if you haven’t done so yet.
Just remember, you don’t need to use a compressor when tracking — simply
keep your levels low enough to leave room for these unexpected signals. If
you do decide to use a compressor during tracking, keep the attack and
release times short (Chapter 7 has more on this). You only want to catch the
initial signal and not mess with the rest of the instrument’s sound. If you want
to use a compressor to sculpt the sound of your instruments, you can do that
easily during the mixing stage of producing your song. I cover this approach
in detail in Chapter 15, where I offer a bunch of sample settings to get you
started.

Getting a Great Lead Vocal Sound
Regardless of the type of home studio you have or the style of music that you
record, you’ll probably record vocals at some point. And unfortunately, 
vocals are one of the most challenging sounds to do well. You have to find the
right mic for the person who’s singing, and then you need to try different
approaches to get the best sound out of him or her. Fortunately, you’re in luck.
In the following sections, I lead you through the (sometimes complicated)
process of getting good lead vocal sounds.
Making the most of the room
To get the best possible recording of vocals, you need a dead room, which is
another way of saying a room that has no reverberation. (Chapter 3 has some
tips on how to deaden your room.) Recording vocals in a dead room gives a
sense of “presence” and allows you to add compression to the vocals without
making them sound distant (this is because the compressor raises the level
of the background noise, particularly the reverberation from a live room).
The easiest way to deaden your room for vocal recording is to hang curtains,
carpet, or blankets around the room or to use the absorbent side of the
reflector/absorber panels that I discuss in Chapter 3. Try to get the front and
both sides of the vocal area covered with absorbent materials. If you use the
reflector/absorber panels that I describe in Chapter 3, you need to use the
stands, because the panels are only 4 feet tall.
Choosing the best mic
You have a lot of options for miking vocals. The type of mic that you use dic-
tates where you place it.
Dynamic mic
Dynamic mics sound best when you place them close to the singer’s mouth.
The effect that you get is gritty. Huh? Okay, by gritty I mean dirty. That’s no
help either? Let me see . . .
Sound: Dynamic mics produce a midrange sound (the high frequencies aren’t
reproduced well). When someone sings with the mic right in front of her
mouth, the sound lacks even more high frequencies due to the proximity
effect (an enhanced low-frequency response at close range). What you get is
a deep, bass-heavy sound that’s often described as gritty or dirty. This type
of sound can be great for some styles of rock and blues music.
162
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Setup: To set up a dynamic mic for this purpose, just put it on a stand so that
the singer can get his mouth right up against the windscreen.
Large-diaphragm condenser mic
Large-diaphragm condenser mics are the most common types of mics for
vocals.
Sound: These mics can clearly reproduce the entire audible frequency spec-
trum and slightly accentuate the low mid frequencies (200–500Hz) at the
same time. What you get is a nice, warm, full-bodied sound (that sounds like
I’m describing a wine). The proximity effect (how close the singer is to the
mic) determines how nice and warm-bodied the sound is. The closer the
singer, the deeper and richer the tone.
Setup: When you set up a large-diaphragm condenser mic for vocals, you
need to place the mic so that nasty sibilances (the sound from singing s and 
t sounds) and pesky plosives (pops from singing p syllables) don’t mess up
your recordings. To deal with plosives and sibilance, you can either use a pop
filter (see Chapter 6) or have the singer sing past the mic. If you want the
singer to sing past the mic, you can do one of the following things:
 Place the mic above the singer and set it at an angle pointing away from
him (Figure 9-1, left).
 Set up the mic below the singer and angle it away from him (Figure 9-1,
right).
 Put the mic off to the side and face it toward the singer (Figure 9-1,
center).
Small-diaphragm condenser mic
The small-diaphragm mic won’t be your first choice in a vocal mic, unless
you are recording a female vocalist with a soprano voice and you want to
catch the more ethereal quality of her higher frequencies.

163
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

Sound: The small-diaphragm condenser mic creates a much more bright or
airy sound than the large-diaphragm mic. This means that it doesn’t contain
the low-mid (200–500 Hz) warmth of its larger-diaphragm counterpart.
Setup: You set up the small-diaphragm mic in the same way that you set up
the large-diaphragm mic.
Ribbon mic
The ribbon mic is a good choice if you’re looking for a crooner-type sound
(think Frank Sinatra).
Sound: The ribbon mic is thought to add a silky sound to the singer’s voice.
By silky, I’m referring to a slight drop-off in the high frequencies (not as severe
as a dynamic mic, though). To my drum-abused ears, ribbon mics have a kind
of softness that the large-diaphragm condenser mics don’t have. The sound is
more even, without the pronounced low-mid effect.
Setup: If you use a ribbon mic, you can set it up in the same way that you
set up a condenser mic. Just be more careful about singing directly into a
ribbon mic because the ribbon can break if you sing, speak, or breathe too
hard into it.
Many digital studios (the SIAB and computer-based systems, especially) con-
tain mic simulator programs as part of their effects packages. Mic simulators
allow you to use a relatively inexpensive mic (a Shure SM57, for instance) and
make it sound like a much more expensive vocal mic. The mic simulator
doesn’t match the sound of a great mic perfectly, but it does give you more
options, especially if you don’t have the bucks to buy a handful of top-notch
vocal mics.
One of the great things about using a mic simulator is that you can choose
the exact sound you want after you’ve recorded the vocal part. This way, you
can spend less time trying to choose the perfect mic and get down to the
business of recording before your singer gets worn out.
Getting Good Backup Vocals
To record backup vocals, you can either track each part separately by using
the same mic-placement techniques that I describe earlier or you can have all
the backup singers sing at once into one or two mics. If you do the latter, you
can either use a stereo pair of mics, a figure-8 mic, or an omnidirectional mic.
If you use a stereo pair of mics, I recommend setting them up in a coincident
X-Y pattern. Have the vocalists stand next to each other facing the mics at 
3 or 4 feet away. Either large- or small-diaphragm mics work best for this
setup. Check out Figure 9-2 for a neat top view of this arrangement.
164
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

If you choose to use a figure-8 mic, the singers can stand on opposite sides of
the mic (Figure 9-3). The advantage of this setup is that the singers can look
at each other while they sing.
An omnidirectional mic can also work well for backup vocals. In this case, the
singers stand in a circle around the mic, as shown in Figure 9-4.

Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

Examining Electric Guitar Miking
Miking your electric guitar is a personal thing. It seems to me that every
guitar player spends a lot of time getting his or her “sound” (although I don’t
play guitar, so what do I know?). If you’re a real guitar player, you undoubt-
edly take great pride in getting your sound exactly right on tape, er, disk. You
likely spend countless hours tweaking your amp and adjusting the mic to get
the sound just right. On the other hand, if you’re not a real guitar player, you
may just want to record the part and get it over with. Either way, you can
start looking for that perfect guitar sound by placing your mics in one (or
more) of the ways that I outline later in this chapter.
Using the room
Whether you play through a small jazz chorus amp or power-chord your way
through a six-foot-tall Marshall stack, the room that you play in has less
impact on your sound than if you play drums or sing. For the most part, look
for a room that is fairly dead — a room without natural reverberation. You
can always add effects later.
Guitar miking involves mostly spot mics, so your only consideration when
recording a guitar using an amp is how your neighbors feel about noise, er,
your most-excellent guitar playing.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

If you have finicky neighbors, you can put your guitar amp inside an amp-
isolator box (see Chapter 3) to reduce the noise. You can find the plans to
build one of these boxes on my Web site: www.jeffstrong.com.
Getting the most out of the mics
The type of mic that you choose largely depends on the type of sound you’re
looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a distorted rock guitar sound with
effects, you can get by just fine with a dynamic mic. If you favor a clean sound,
a small-diaphragm condenser mic may work better for you. If you’re going for a
warm, full-bodied sound, try using a large-diaphragm condenser mic.
No matter which type of mic you use, you get the best sound from your amp
speakers by putting a mic about 2 to 12 inches from the cabinet, with the mic
pointing directly at the cone of one of the amp speakers (the cone is located
in the center of the speaker). You can see this positioning in Figure 9-5.
You may want to experiment with how far the mic is from the amp and the
angle at which you point it. Sometimes just a slight movement in or out, left
or right, can make all the difference in the world. You can even try pointing
the mic at different speakers if your amp has more than one, because each
speaker has a slightly different sound.
Figure 9-5:
Start by
placing a
mic near the

167
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

I know some engineers who disconnect all but one speaker in the cabinet
(assuming that you have more than one speaker) to lower the volume and
still have an intense, distorted sound. This can be especially beneficial if you
have one of those amp stacks with a volume knob that goes to 11, and you
need to crank the amp to get your “tone” (come on, rockers, you know who
you are). This way you don’t overdrive the mic — creating distortion — and
you can still get that nasty sound that you’re looking for.
If you can’t quite get the sound that you want from your amp with the one
mic pointed at the speaker cone, you may want to add a second mic 3 or 4
feet away. You also point this mic directly at the speaker cabinet for a more
ambient sound. This may also give your sound more life, especially if you
have a room with natural reverberation. If you add a second mic, remember
to watch for phase differences between the mics and make adjustments
accordingly. (I discuss phase cancellation in Chapter 8.)
Are you sick of the same old sound coming out of your amp? Do you wanna
really shake things up (and I mean this literally)? Well, put your guitar amp in
a tiled bathroom and crank it up. You can put a mic in the bathroom with
your amp (a couple of feet away) and maybe another one just outside the
door (experiment by how much you close or open the door). The effect is,
well . . . try it and find out for yourself.
On most digital recording systems, you can use an effect called an amp simu-
lator to give your guitar a variety of sounds. The amp simulator can make
your guitar sound like it was played through any number of popular amplifier
setups. This can save you the hassle of trying to mic your guitar amp and
keep your neighbors happy. Just plug your guitar into the Hi-Z jack in your
mixer. If you don’t have a Hi-Z jack, you can use a direct box or the line-out
jack of your amp (more on this in Chapter 4).
Exploring Electric Bass Miking
When you mic an electric bass, getting a good sound can be a real bear. Your
two adversaries are muddiness (lack of definition) and thinness (a pronounced
midrange tone). These seem like almost polar opposite characteristics, but
they can both exist at the same time. I outline the best way to avoid these
problems in the following sections.
Running your bass guitar directly into the board — via a direct box, your
amp’s line-out jack, or a Hi-Z jack on the mixer — gives the guitar a punchier
sound. Some recorders have amp-simulator programs for bass guitar as well
as guitar. So don’t be afraid to skip the amp and go directly into the mixer.
168
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Managing the room
The sound of an electric bass guitar can quickly get muddy. Your best bet is
to choose a room that doesn’t have a lot of reflective surfaces (for example,
paneled walls and wooden floors that the sound can bounce off of). A dead
room is easier to work with. Don’t make your room too dead, however, or it
just sucks the life out of your amp’s tone. If you can get your amp to sound
good in your room, placing the mic properly is easy.
Don’t be afraid to be creative and to try recording your bass in different
rooms. Look for a room with a warm sound to it. One thing though — the
bathroom amp trick doesn’t work well on bass guitar (but it can be fun to try
anyway).
Getting the most from the mic
Because the bass guitar produces low frequencies, a dynamic mic or a large-
diaphragm condenser mic works well. I avoid small-diaphragm condensers
and ribbon mics for the electric bass, but try them if you want. Who knows —
you may end up with an awesome bass track.
Mic placement for the electric bass is similar to the guitar: You place a single
mic 2 to 12 inches away from one of the speakers. Sometimes with bass, if you
angle the mic and let the speaker’s sound kind of drift past the diaphragm, you
can get a great sound. For a bass, skip the distant mic, which generally just
adds muddiness to the sound.
Miking Acoustic Guitars 
and Similar Instruments
At the risk of offending banjo, dobro, harp, or ukulele players, I’m lumping all
strummed or picked string instruments together. I know, they all sound and
play differently, but the microphone-placement techniques for all these
instruments are similar. Allow me to explain.
Because all these instruments have a resonating chamber, you can pretty
much use the same mic placement for any of them. You use different types of
mics for different instruments, and I get to that in a minute.
169
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

Making the most of the room
Because these are acoustic instruments, the room plays a role in the sound
that you end up recording. Unless you have a great-sounding room, you want
to minimize its impact on your instrument’s sound. You can do this by
recording with spot mics or by placing absorber/reflectors in strategic places
around your room. Put the absorber side out if the room is too live or the
reflector side out if the room is too dead.
For example, if your home studio resides in a spare bedroom with carpeting
and that awful popcorn stuff on the ceiling, you can put a couple of the reflec-
tor panels around your guitar player and the mic. This adds some reverbera-
tion to your guitar. Any unwanted reflections from the ceiling or walls are
shielded from the mics, because the absorber sides of the panels are facing
the rest of the room.
Using your mics
I often prefer to use condenser mics when recording acoustic instruments.
The type of condenser mic you use depends on the overall tonal quality that
you want to capture or accentuate. For example, if a guitar has a nice woody
sound that you want to bring out in the recording, a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re trying to capture
the brightness of a banjo, a small-diaphragm mic is a better choice.
You can position your microphone in a variety of ways, and each accents cer-
tain aspects of the instrument’s sound. Even a slight adjustment to the mic
can have a significant impact on the sound. You may have to experiment
quite a bit to figure out exactly where to put a mic.
To help with your experimentation, listen to the instrument carefully and
move the mic around (in and out, left and right) until you find a spot that
sounds particularly good. You need to get your ears close to the instrument
to do this.
Here are some suggestions to get you started:
 Put the mic 6 to 18 inches away from and 3 to 4 inches below the
point where the neck meets the body of the instrument. Then make
minor adjustments to the direction in which the mic points. Pointing it
toward the sound hole(s) often gives you a richer, deeper tone. (This
can translate to muddiness on some instruments.) Turning the mic more
toward the neck brings out the instrument’s brighter qualities. See the
image on the left in Figure 9-6.
 Place the mic about 3 feet away from the instrument and point it
directly at the sound hole. At this distance, you capture the rich sound
170
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

from the sound hole and the attack of the strings. See the center image
in Figure 9-6.
 Put the mic about 6 inches out from the bridge of the instrument. Try
pointing the mic in different directions (slight movements of an inch or
less can make a huge difference) until you find the spot that sounds best
to you. See the image on the right in Figure 9-6.
 Set up the mic at about the same distance and angle from the instru-
ment as the player’s ears. Point the mic down toward the instrument so
that the mic is a couple of inches away from either side of the musician’s
head. This is an unorthodox approach that I like because the player
adjusts his playing style and intonation to correspond to what she is
hearing when she plays. With this technique, you’re trying to capture
exactly what the musician hears.
Getting a Handle on Miking Horns
There’s nothing like the sound of a horn played by a skilled player. Sure, you
can use a synthesizer or sampler to play horns, but it’s not quite the same.
Luckily, horns, such as trumpets, trombones, and saxophones, use similar
miking techniques, so if you want to mic some horns, you don’t have to
understand a ton of different techniques.
Understanding the role of the room
Because of the high volume levels of most horns and the fact that you mic
them fairly closely, you don’t get a ton of impact from the acoustics of the
room. Unless your room sounds really bad (for example, a small spare bed-
room with carpeting and a low ceiling), you can deal with any room sound
that bleeds into the mic.

sound.
171
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

If you have a small room that adds an unwanted sound to the instrument, sur-
round the horn player with acoustic panels, similar to what I describe in the
section “Getting a Great Lead Vocal Sound,” earlier in this chapter. You can
experiment with using either the reflective or absorptive side of the panels to
get the sound that you want. Generally speaking, err to the side of a more
dead room — you can always add some reverb later.
Making the most of the mics
For most horns, a decent condenser mic — large- or small-diaphragm —
works well. If you want a richer tone, a ribbon mic is the way to go. In fact,
whenever I mic horns, I pull out a ribbon mic first, and it usually stays out
until the session is over.
You can place the mic from 3 inches to a foot or more from the instrument,
depending on the instrument and the sound you’re looking for. For example, a
trumpet, because of its high sound pressure levels (SPLs, or volume), would
sound best with the mic a little farther away than the placement for a tenor
sax. This is especially true with ribbon mics, where too much pressure can
blow the ribbon.
Most horns generally sound better if the mic is placed just to the side of the
bell (the part where the sound comes out). This keeps the SPL that the mic
picks up low enough to avoid distortion and not blow your precious ribbon.
For some of the louder instruments, choose a condenser mic with a high SPL
rating and/or a pad switch, or move the mic away from the instrument a bit.
(A pad switch reduces the amount of sound — usually by 10–20db — that the
mic’s internal circuits process, allowing you to have a louder signal without
distortion.)
If you want to record more than one horn instrument at a time (a couple of
trombones, for instance), you can use a figure-8 condenser mic and have
each horn player positioned on either side of the mic. As an alternative, use
one or more mics a couple of feet away from the players.
Placing Mics for a Piano
If you’re lucky enough to have a real piano to record, you’ll probably want to
record it live rather than use some piano patch on a synthesizer. The follow-
ing sections give you some suggestions on how to effectively mic a piano.
172
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Harnessing the sound of the room
Pianos can be tough to record if your room doesn’t sound great. Because of the
size of the instrument — especially if it’s a grand or a baby grand piano — you
need a large room with a high ceiling to get the best sound. If you have an
upright piano in a living room, for example, you may find it easier to just record
a piano patch (sound) on a decent synthesizer.
If your room doesn’t add to the sound of the piano, use a closer mic place-
ment that you would if your room sounds great.
Managing the mics
Condenser mics are a must for recording piano. Either small- or large-
diaphragm mics work well. Your mic placement depends largely on the sound
you’re going after. Here are a few examples:
 Funky rock or ragtime sound: Place your mic close in toward the ham-
mers. In this case, I would use two mics — one over the higher register
and one over the lower, 6 to 12 inches away from the hammers.
 Natural classical-type sound: Move the mics out from the instrument —
2 to 6 feet is usually good, depending on how much room sound you
want in the mix. The farther you move the mics outside of the lid, the
higher you should place the mics because the sound moves up as it goes
out. A good reference is to use the lid as guide.
The farther outside the instrument you put the mics, the more room sound
you pick up.
If you don’t want to use a traditional condenser mic or if you want to try
another approach to piano miking, you can use a boundary mic. A boundary
mic is an omnidirectional mic that attaches to the instrument. You can find a
decent-sounding boundary mic for about $50 from Radio Shack (Cat. #33-3022)
or for a few more dollars from most other microphone manufacturers. Just
mount the boundary mic to the underside of the piano’s lid (consult your mic’s
manual for details on mounting it) to get the best sound. You can also use two
boundary mics — one over the lower register and one over the higher one.
Setting Up Mics for Strings
Stringed instruments — violin and fiddle, viola, cello, and acoustic bass —
can be a lot of fun to mic. They have a rich tone and produce an almost
unlimited variety of textures. Each instrument has a different tonal spectrum,
173
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

but because they all have the same basic shape and design (f-holes, strings,
bows, and so on), they can all be thought of similarly. You can try any of the
techniques that I describe for one of these instruments on the rest of them.
For example, try the mic technique from the cello on the fiddle and see what
you think. Your options are many, so experiment and use what you like.
Making the most of the room
As with any other acoustic instrument, the room can have profound impacts
on the sound that you capture. Unless you have a really nice-sounding room,
try to isolate the instrument from the room’s sound. In this case, spot miking
is the best choice. On the other hand, if you have access to a great-sounding
room or concert hall in which to record, by all means add some room mics or
use a stereo-miking technique.
Making sense of the mics
My favorite type of mic for classical string instruments is a small-diaphragm
condenser unit, although on occasion I reach for a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic. A dynamic mic may produce an interesting effect, but it doesn’t
capture the most natural sound.
You can place the mic for each of the string instruments as follows:
 Violin, fiddle, and viola: These all sound great with a mic placed 1 to 2
feet above and behind the instrument and facing down at the instru-
ment’s body.
 Cello and double bass: For these instruments, place the mic several feet
away from the instrument (between 4 and 8 feet) and point it toward the
f-hole in the instrument. This allows you to capture the sound of the
entire instrument. The only drawback is that you also get a fair amount
of the sound of the room. If you don’t want the effects of your room
recorded, you can place acoustic panels on either side of the mic.
 Ensembles: Ensembles sound best when miked with a stereo pair placed
between 8 and 20 feet away. You can use any of the stereo-miking tech-
niques that I described earlier in this chapter. If you are miking soloists,
you may also need to add a spot mic or two for their instruments. If so,
follow the recommendations that I provide earlier in this list and watch
for phase problems.

Digging into Drum Set Miking
If you’re like most musicians, getting great-sounding drums seems like one of
the world’s great mysteries (you know, along the lines of how the pyramids
were built or how to cure cancer). You can hear big, fat drums on great albums
but when you try to record your drums, they always end up sounding more like
cardboard boxes than drums. Fret not, for I have solutions for you.
First things first: Tuning your drums
The most important part of getting killer drum sounds is to make sure that
your drums are tuned properly and that they have good heads on them
(okay, those are two important things). Seriously, if you spend some time get-
ting the drums to sound good in your room, you’re halfway to the drum
175
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
What type of drum set?
If you want to buy a drum set for your home
studio, here are some guidelines that have
worked for me:
 Smaller drums can sound bigger. At one
point, I had two top-notch Gretsch drum
sets in my studio. One was a rock kit that
had a 24-inch kick; 13-, 14-, and 18-inch
tom-toms; and a 61⁄2-inch deep metal snare
drum. The other was a small jazz kit con-
sisting of an 18-inch kick, 10- and 14-inch
tom-toms, and a 5-inch deep-wood snare.
Guess what? Even for the hardest rock
music, the small kit sounded much bigger.
You can tune the small drums down a bit
and they just sing!
 Choose your heads wisely. Not all heads
are equal. Some sound great on stage while
others are better suited for the studio.
Because the heads that come with a kit are
most likely not the ones that sound the best
on a recording, invest some money in test-
ing different drumheads on your kit. I prefer
either Remo pinstripes (great for rock and
R&B) or coated Ambassadors (great for
jazz) on the top and either clear or coated
Ambassadors (I choose based on aesthet-
ics) on the bottom of the drum.
 Use cymbals with a fast decay. Cymbals
that sound great on stage are different from
those that sound great in the studio. Stage
cymbals often have long decays and slow
attacks. This causes bleeding, especially
through the tom-tom mics, and correcting
the problem can be a headache. If you buy
cymbals for your studio, choose those that
have a very fast attack and a short decay.
 More expensive isn’t always better. For
recording, my favorite drum sets are used kits
from the late ’60s and early ’70s. My all-time
favorite recording set is a late-’60s Gretsch
jazz drum set with an 18-inch kick drum, a 
10-inchmounted tom-tom, and a 14-inchfloor
tom. For a snare, I love old 5-inch wooden
snare drums (for example, Gretsch, Ludwig,
or Slingerland). The last one of these sets that
I bought cost $350, including all the mounting
hardware and the snare drum. It wasn’t
pretty, but it sure sounded great.

sound of your dreams. I don’t go into detail here, but if you want specific
drum-tuning guidance, you can do an Internet search or check out my book
Drums For Dummies (published by Wiley).
You’re looking for a clear, open tone on your drums. Resist the temptation to
apply duct tape or other dampeners to the drumheads. Drums that are dead-
ened and don’t ring clearly definitely sound like cardboard boxes when you
record them.
After you get your drums tuned as well as you can, the next step is to take
care of rattles that may be coming from the stands or mounting hardware.
Tighten any loose hardware and move any stands that may be touching one
another. You may need to make some small adjustments to the pitches of
your drums if they are causing hardware to rattle.
If you still have some ringing or unwanted overtones, you can damp them
slightly. Cotton gauze taped lightly on the edge of the head (away from the
drummer) is often enough. If you want a real dry sound on your snare drum,
you can use the wallet trick: Have the drummer place his wallet on the head.
(Use the drummer’s wallet because it probably doesn’t have any money in it.)
When your drums have been tuned perfectly, you’re ready to start placing
some microphones. You can choose from an unlimited number of miking con-
figurations, only a few of which I can cover here (it would take a whole book
to cover them all).
Using the room to your benefit
The room influences the drums’ sound more than it influences that of other
instruments. If you’re looking for a big drum sound, you need a fairly live
room (one with lots of reflection).
I know, you’re thinking, “But I just have a bedroom for a studio, and it’s car-
peted.” No worries, you can work with that. Remember, you have a home
studio, so you potentially have your whole home to work with. Here are a
couple of ideas to spark your imagination:
 Buy three or four 4-×-8-foot sheets of plywood and lean them against the
walls of your room. Also, place one sheet on the floor just in front of the
kick drum. This adds some reflective surfaces to the room.
 Put the drums in your garage (or living room, or any other room with a
reverberating sound) and run long mic cords to your mixer. If you have a
studio-in-a-box system, you can just throw it under your arm and move
everything into your garage or, better yet, take all this stuff to a really
great-sounding room and record.
176
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

 Set up your drums in a nice-sounding room and place an additional mic
just outside the door to catch an additional ambient sound. You can
then mix this with the other drum tracks to add a different quality of
reverberation to the drums.
Picking up the kick (bass) drum
When recording a kick drum, most recording engineers choose a dynamic
mic. In fact, you can find some large-diaphragm dynamic mics specifically
designed to record kick drums.
No matter where you place the mic, you can reduce the amount of boominess
that you get from the drum by placing a pillow or blanket inside the drum.
Some people choose to let the pillow or blanket touch the inside head. I
prefer to keep it a couple of inches away from the inside head, but I find it
can be beneficial to let it touch the outside head.
That said, you can place your mic in several ways: 
 Near the inside head (see Figure 9-7, left): If you take off the outside
head or cut a hole in it, you can put the mic inside the drum. Place the
mic 2 to 3 inches away from the inside head and a couple of inches off
center. This is the standard way to mic a kick drum if you have the out-
side head off or if a hole is cut in it. This placement gives you a sharp
attack from the beater hitting the head.
 Halfway inside the drum: You can modify the preceding miking tech-
nique by moving the mic back so that it’s about halfway inside the drum.
In this case, place the mic right in the middle, pointing where the beater
strikes the drum. This placement gives you less of the attack of the
beater striking the head and more of the body of the drum’s sound.
 Near the outside head (see Figure 9-7, right): If you have both heads on
the drum, you can place the mic a few inches from the outside head. If
you want a more open, boomy sound (and you have the drum’s pitch set
fairly high), point the mic directly at the center of the head. If you want
less boom, offset the mic a little and point it about two-thirds of the way
toward the center.
If your drum sounds thin after trying these mic-placement approaches, you
can try these two things:
 Tune the drum slightly up. In your quest for a deep bass tone, you may
have tuned the drum too low. (This is especially common if you have a
large bass drum.) In this case, the drum’s fundamental tone may be too
low to be heard clearly. Raising the pitch a bit usually solves the problem.
177
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

 Create a tunnel with acoustic panels. Putting the mic in the tunnel often
helps if you have a room that’s too dead. Place two of the panels on their
sides (reflective surfaces facing in) with one end of each panel near the
outside of the drum. Angle the panels out so that, where they are far-
thest from the drum set, the distance between them is just under 4 feet.
Then lay the other two panels (reflective surface facing down) across
the side panels to create a tunnel. You can also place a piece of plywood
on the floor under these panels to further increase the resonance. Place
the mic halfway into the tunnel, facing the center of the drum.
Setting up the snare drum
The snare drum is probably the most important drum in popular music. The
bass guitar can cover the kick drum’s rhythm, and the rest of the drums aren’t
part of the main groove. A good, punchy snare drum can make a track, whereas
a weak, thin one can eliminate the drive that most popular music needs.
Because the snare drum is located so close to the other drums, especially the
hi-hats, a cardioid-pattern mic is a must. The most common mic for a snare
drum is the trusty Shure SM57. The mic is generally placed between the 
hi-hats and the small tom-tom about 1 or 2 inches from the snare drum head
(see Figure 9-8). Point the diaphragm directly at the head. You may need to
make some minor adjustments to eliminate bleed from the hi-hats. This posi-
tion gives you a nice punchy sound.
If you want a crisper tone, you can add a second mic under the drum. Place
this mic about an inch or two from the head with the diaphragm pointing at
the snares. Make minor adjustments to minimize leakage from the hi-hats.
If you have the available tracks, record each snare mic to a separate track
and blend the two later during mixdown. If you don’t have the available
tracks, blend them until you have the sound that you want.

178
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Tackling the tom-toms
The tom-toms sound best when using a dynamic mic. For the mounted toms
(the ones above the kick drum), you can use one or two mics. If you use one
mic, place it between the two drums about 4 to 6 inches away from the heads
(Figure 9-9 shows this placement option). If you use two mics, place one
above each drum 1 to 3 inches above the head.
If you want a boomy sound with less attack, you can place a mic inside the
shell with the bottom head off the drum.
Floor toms are miked the same way as the mounted tom-toms. Use the follow-
ing setup:
 Place a single mic a couple of inches away from the head near the rim.
 If you have more than one floor tom, you can place one mic between
them or mic them individually.
If you want to apply compression to the tom-toms, you can start with the set-
tings that I listed for the snare drum in the preceding section.

placement

Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

Handling the hi-hats
The hi-hats are generally part of the main groove, and as such, you want to
spend time getting a good sound. You may have problems with a few other
mics on the drum set picking up the hi-hats, particularly the snare drum mic
and overhead mics. Some people don’t bother miking the hi-hats for this
reason.
I like to mic hi-hats because, to me, these cymbals often sound too trashy
through the snare drum mic. If you mic hi-hats, make sure that the snare
drum mic is picking up as little of the hi-hats as possible by placing the mic
properly and/or using a noise gate (a dynamic processor used to filter
unwanted noise).
You can use either a dynamic mic or, better yet, a small-diaphragm condenser
mic for the hi-hats. The dynamic mic gives you a trashier sound, and the small-
diaphragm condenser mic produces a bright sound. You can work with either
by adjusting the EQ. I usually add just a little bit (4dB or so) of a shelf EQ set at
10 kHz to add a little sheen to the hi-hats.
Place the mic 3 to 4 inches above the hi-hats and point it downward. The
exact placement of the mic is less important than the placement of the other
instrument mics because of the hi-hats’ tone. Just make sure that your mic
isn’t so close that you hit it.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Creating the best cymbal sound
You want to know one secret to the huge drum sound of Led Zeppelin’s drum-
mer, John Bonham? Finesse. He understood that the drums sound louder and
bigger in a mix if the cymbals are quieter in comparison (I’m guessing this is
true, because I never really talked to him about this). So he played his cym-
bals softly and hit the drums pretty hard. This allowed the engineer to raise
the levels of the drums without having the cymbals drown everything else
out. Absolutely brilliant.
Because having the drums bleed into the overhead mics is inevitable and the
overhead mics are responsible for providing much of the drums’ presence in
a mix, playing the cymbals softly allows you to get more of the drums in
these mics. This helps the drums sound bigger.
Ask (no, demand) that your drummer play the cymbals quieter. Also, use
smaller cymbals with a fast attack and a short decay. Doing these things cre-
ates a better balance between the drums and cymbals and makes the drums
stand out more in comparison.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics capture the cymbals’ high frequencies well,
though many digital recordists like the way a ribbon mic mellows the cym-
bals. You can mic the cymbals by placing mics 12 to18 inches above each
cymbal or by using overhead mics set 1 to 3 feet above the cymbals (see the
next section).
Miking the whole kit
Most of the time, you want to have at least one (but preferably two) ambient
mics on the drums, if for no other reason than to pick up the cymbals.
Assuming that you use two mics, they are called overhead mics, and as the
name implies, they are placed above the drum set. The most common types
of mics to use for overheads are large- and small-diaphragm condenser mics
because they pick up the high frequencies in the cymbals and give the drum
set’s sound a nice sheen (brightness). You may also want to try a pair of
ribbon mics to pick up a nice, sweet sound on the overheads.
To mic the drum set with overhead mics, you can use either the X-Y coincident
technique or spaced stereo pairs. Place them 1 to 2 feet above the cymbals,
just forward of the drummer’s head. Place X-Y mics in the center and set up
spaced stereo pairs so that they follow the 3:1 rule (for example, the mics
should be set 3 to 6 feet apart if they are 1 to 2 feet above the cymbals). This
counters any phase problems. Point the mic down toward the drums, and
you’re ready to record. Figure 9-10 shows both of these setups.
181
Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments

Getting Your Hands on Hand Drums
Hand drums can be anything from the familiar conga to unusual drums, such as
the North African tar. Because you may encounter many types of hand drums,
this section gives you some general guidelines when recording any hand drum.
Your selection in mics depends on the type of drum and its tonal characteris-
tics. For example, conga drums occupy the middle of the frequency spectrum
and produce a loud sound that a large-diaphragm condenser mic can capture
well. Or, if you want a tighter, drier sound, you can use a dynamic mic. If you
choose the dynamic mic, the mic colors the sound of your recording.
If you want to record any of the smaller, higher-pitched hand drums, use
either a large- or small-diaphragm condenser mic and skip the dynamic mic
altogether.
Mic placement also varies considerably among the various hand drums. Listen
to the sound of the drum, and find a place where you like what you hear. For
the most part, placing the mic from 1 to 3 feet from the drum creates the fullest
sound. If you want a lot of attack, you can place the mic closer. You lose some
of the drum’s depth, however, when you place the mic closer than a foot.
Perfecting Percussion Miking
Miscellaneous percussion instruments, such as shakers and triangles, are
nice additions to many styles of music. These instruments sound best with a
good condenser mic. I choose a large- or small-diaphragm mic, depending on
the characteristics that I want to pick up. For instance, a shaker can sound
great with a large-diaphragm mic because this mic slightly brings out the
lower frequencies of the instrument and softens the overall sound a bit.
X-Y mics 1-2 feet above cymbals
Spaced-pair mics 1-2 feet above cymbals
and 3-6 feet apart

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 

Exploring the impact of the room
Most of the time, the room doesn’t have a huge impact on percussion instru-
ments because you mic them closely. If your room does get in the way, use
the acoustic panels in much the same way that I suggest for vocals earlier in
this chapter in the “Getting a Great Lead Vocal Sound” section (partially sur-
round the mic and musician with baffles).
Choosing and using the mics
Both large- and small-diaphragm mics work well for percussion. When record-
ing percussion instruments, the main thing to remember is that they can have
a high SPL (sound pressure level, or just plain volume), so you may need to
pad the mic, move it back, or turn it sideways from the sound source.
I like to put a single mic from 6 to 36 inches away from percussion instru-
ments, depending on the size of the instrument and how much room I want in
the sound. For example, because maracas are loud, I put the mic back a bit
(18 inches), whereas with an egg shaker, I find that 6 to 8 inches often sounds
best. But when I record an agogo bell or an Afuche I like to have a little room
in the mix to give the instrument more depth. In this case, I mic from a couple
feet away.

A
s recently as the 1960s, when someone wanted to record a song, he or
she had to assemble a band, rehearse, and then perform the song live. If
one of the musicians made a mistake, the whole band had to start over and
record the song again. Not so anymore. You’re lucky enough to have gotten
into recording in an age where you can not only write the song but also record
it yourself and play all the instruments. If you like, you can make lush, layered
music without involving anyone else. In other words, you can multitrack.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of multitrack recording, a process
that enables you to assemble a song by recording one part at a time. You dis-
cover how to set up a new song in a variety of systems, and you find out how
to set up the monitoring source and sound to help you inspire a great perfor-
mance. This chapter also walks you through the process of saving files and
transferring data between systems.
Understanding Multitracking
Multitrack recording is the process of recording each instrument (or group of
instruments) individually and keeping those performances separate until a
later date. Consider the CD or cassette player that you have at home or in
your car. All the instruments are contained on a pair of stereo tracks. You 
can adjust the volume or equalization of these tracks, but you can’t adjust
the sound qualities of the individual instruments contained on these two
tracks. The multitrack recorder, on the other hand, allows you to keep all

these instruments separate (see Figure 10-1). Multitrack recording lets you do
the following things:
 Make adjustments to the sound of the instrument on each track
 Adjust the levels (volume) of the instruments in relation to one another
 Assemble a “performance” that never happened
Getting Ready to Record
Before you can press the Record button on your system, you need to set up 
a few things. First, you need to find and choose the instrument or sound that
you want to record, then you need to set the optimum volume level going 
to the recorder, and last, you need to decide what you want to hear while
recording your performance. These steps are covered in detail in the follow-
ing sections.
Setting up a song
If you’re using a digital recording system, you need to open a new song file.
When you do this, you may be asked (or prompted) to choose the sampling

rate and resolution of this new song. (Some systems have you provide this
information when you choose a track to record to rather than when opening
a song file.)
You generally have the option to choose a sampling rate, which is the number
of times every second that the digital recorder or converter takes a snapshot
of the sound (check out Chapter 2 for details on sampling rates). Your options
include 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, or 96 kHz. Some digital recorders don’t allow you to
make a CD if you record with anything but a 44.1-kHz sampling rate. Check
your owner’s manual if you intend to eventually put your music on a CD.
Some systems may also let you choose the bit depth — the size, in binary
digits, of the sample that the converter or recorder takes — that you want to
record in. For this parameter, I usually choose the highest bit depth available
to capture the best sound possible. If you choose 20 or 24 bits, you need to
convert the final mix to 16-bit if you want to put your music on a CD, but the
advantages you gain from recording at a higher bit depth far outweigh the
conversion factor. (Go to Chapter 2 for more on bit depth.)
Finally, name your file, and you’re ready to select a source signal to record.
Selecting a sound source
When you select a sound source, you simply set up your instrument or micro-
phone so that it records to the track of your choice. Here’s how to select a
sound source:
1. Turn the input trim knob and fader on the channel strip of your mixer
all the way down to avoid hearing an unpleasant noise.
2. Plug your instrument or microphone into the appropriate input jack
of your system.
For a microphone, this may be a separate preamp or the internal preamp
in your mixer, SIAB system, or audio interface. For an electric guitar or
bass, use the Hi-Z input or a direct box, and for a keyboard or other elec-
tronic instruments (such as a drum machine or sound module), use any
of the instrument inputs.
3. Choose the track that you want to record the signal to.
This procedure varies from system to system. Here’s how to route the
signal in the following systems:
Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: You can route the signal from any mixer
input to any recorder track by pressing a button. For example, on the
Roland VS-1680, just press and hold the Status button for the track that
you want to record to. When the routing screen appears, continue holding
189
Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording

the track’s Status button and press the Select button for the input chan-
nel that you want to route to that track. Release the Status button, and
you’re all set.
Computer-based systems: You need to open the Input window to choose
your input source. This process is pretty simple and is similar for most
programs. Here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:
a. Choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪I/O View.
The I/O section of the Edit window appears, showing the inputs
and outputs for each of your tracks.
b. Click and hold your mouse button on the Input selector until the
Input menu pops up.
c. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse
over the Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want.
d. Release the mouse button to select the input listing.
This menu closes, and the input you’ve selected appears in the
Input selector.
Stand-alone systems: If you have a stand-alone recorder with a separate
analog mixer, you need to connect a cord from the input channel that
your instrument is plugged into to the track that you want to record to
(use the direct line outputs from the input channel).
4. Arm the track that you want to record to (that is, set it to the 
Record mode).
This procedure also varies from system to system. Here’s how to arm
the track on the following systems: 
Studio-in-a-box systems: A Selector button glows various colors,
depending on the mode that the channel is in. Press the button on the
track number that you’re recording to until you see a red glow. This
means that the track is ready to record.
If you are using an SIAB system and want to record to a different track
number than the input channel you’re plugged into, make sure that you
arm the track that you want to record to and not the track associated
with the input channel. If you don’t do this, you either record your
music to the wrong track (and possibly erase something else) or you
don’t record anything, depending on the routing of your system.
Computer-based system: Arm the track within the software by clicking
the Record Enable button in the main window of your program. In Pro
Tools, for example, this button is located in both the Edit window and
the mix window for each track.
Stand-alone systems: Press the Track Selector button located near the
Track Level meter on the front of the machine until the button blinks red.

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

Setting levels
Getting a sound signal to the recorder takes several steps. The path that the
sound takes from the instrument or microphone to the recorder is called the
signal chain (or the gain structure). For example, if you want to record your
voice, you first capture your voice with a microphone and then you feed that
signal to a preamp. From the preamp, you send the signal to the channel strip
of your mixer, which sends the signal to the analog/digital (A/D) converter
and then to the recorder. (Chapter 7 has more on this.) The signal chain may
have all or just a couple of these steps, however. For example, a synthesizer
is connected to the mixer, which is in turn connected to the recorder.
You need to be aware of the signal level at all of these steps to get the best
sound possible. Too much gain at one stage forces you to reduce the gain at
another. Likewise, too little gain at one point may require you to overdrive
(bump up the gain) during the next stage. See Chapter 7 for more on setting
optimal signal levels.
Getting the sound you want
After your levels are set, you can concentrate on fine-tuning the sound of the
instrument before you record it. Here you can either adjust the EQ or apply
effects to your sound.
EQ
I reserve EQ at this point for getting rid of any seriously unwanted frequen-
cies that I’m picking up in a mic. For example, I generally cut some low
midrange frequencies on the bass guitar and kick drum because I know that
these frequencies will be a problem later. Otherwise, I pretty much leave the
EQ alone when tracking.
Don’t get too anal about getting the EQ of a recorded instrument just right at
this point. All you want is a good, clean sound that approximates what you
want in the final mix. You have another chance to make adjustments to the
sound of your recorded instrument in the mixing phase.
Check the levels going to the recorder after you’ve made adjustments to the
EQ because the levels may change.
Effects
The question of whether to record effects — reverb, delay, chorus, and so 
on — along with an instrument is a long-debated topic. Professional record-
ing engineers caution you against recording your instruments wet (with effects)
191
Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording

because this limits your options when you mix the song. On the other hand,
by recording an instrument with an effect, you can use that effect processor
on another instrument during the mixing process. Ultimately, you have to
decide whether adding an effect to an instrument on the front end (before
recording) is the way to go. (I describe effects in greater detail in Chapter 15.)
If you record using a computer-based system, adding an effect during track-
ing may stress your computer’s processor to the point where it affects your
recording. This can cause audio dropouts, pops, clicks, or other unwanted
interruptions or corruptions to your audio data. If you have a slower com-
puter or if you record a lot of tracks at once, you may find that you can’t
record with effects. In this case, your headphone mix while you track has no
effect added to the sound, but you can still add effects during the mixing
process (as described in Chapter 14).
If you’re sure about the sound you want, you can add the effect on the front
end. If you’re not sure, you’re probably better off waiting until later. You can
always print (record) the effect during a bounce procedure, a neat trick where
you re-record one or more tracks to another track. Bouncing is a common
procedure if you don’t have enough tracks in your system to record each of
your instruments to its own track. I cover the bounce process in Chapter 11.
If you decide that you want to record your instrument with effects, you need
to route the instrument through the effect processor and route the effect to
the recorder. If you have an SIAB system, this is pretty easy. For example, to
do this in a Roland VS-1880, follow these steps (most SIAB systems are similar):
1. Select the input channel that your instrument is plugged into and
route the channel to the track that you want to record to.
If you have a computer-based system, you need to use the Input menu
on your screen to do this. On an SIAB system, your manual spells out 
the specific routing procedure.
2. Arm the recorder’s track (press the recorder’s Status button until the
button blinks red).
3. Select the effect that you want to use and assign it to one of your
effects buses.
Go to the Effect A menu by pressing Shift+F3. Choose Effect 1 from the
menu. Next, scroll through the Effects list and highlight the effect that
you want to use. Press the Select button. Your chosen effect is now
assigned to Aux Bus 1.
4. Choose prefader or postfader on your Aux Send and turn the knob
until you have the right amount of the instrument’s signal sent to 
the effect.
You do this by going to the channel mixer settings menu on your screen.
5. Route the effect return to the track channel that you want to record to.
192
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

Press and hold the Status button for your track until the Routing menu
pops up (this takes about 3 seconds). Next, while still pressing the Status
button, press the Effect button for the effect number (1, 2, 3, or 4) that
you want to use. Note: This step may not be necessary on some systems.
6. Start recording.
See Chapter 11 for the lowdown on recording.
On some systems, if you want to hear your recorded track, you may have to
“unroute” the effect from that track. Your owner’s manual spells this out for you.
Adding an effect in a computer-based system, such as Logic Pro, involves
these steps:
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in each track’s channel
strip that you want to route to the effect.
You can view a track’s channel strip in the Environment window (choose
Windows➪Environment if the window isn’t open) or in the Arrange
window. To open a track’s channel strip in the Arrange window, click the
track name in the Arrange window to highlight it. The channel strip
appears on the left.
When you release your mouse button after selecting the bus, the bus is
listed, and a trim pot (knob) appears next to the bus number.
2. Adjust the trim pot to a moderate level.
I usually start with about –15dB.
3. Double-click the bus number.
You’re taken to the Bus Channel strip in the Environment window, where
you can choose the effect to insert into the bus.
4. By using the Insert selector pop-up menu in the Bus Channel strip,
select the effects plug-in that you want to use from the Inserts 
pop-up menu.
The Effect Plug-In window opens. Here you set your parameters, such as
predelay, reverb time, and room type (for a reverb plug-in, for example).
5. Play your track by clicking the Play button in the Transport window.
Your session plays, and you hear the effect of your plug-in on your track.
You can then tweak the plug-in parameters or the send level for your
track as your song plays to get the sound that you want.
To record an effect with an analog mixer and a stand-alone recorder, you have
to route things differently. You can do this one of two ways: by running cables
from the master output of your mixer to the track input of your recorder or
by creating a submix and connecting the recorder’s track input to the submix
output on your mixer. Your owner’s manual should clearly explain these 
procedures.
193
Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording

Choosing a monitoring source
To record effectively, you need to hear what you’re doing. This requires you
to set up your monitoring source so that you can hear what you want to hear.
You want to monitor the sound that’s going through the recorder. This way,
you can hear any distortion that may be present. Here’s how monitoring
works on the following systems:
 Computer-based systems: Set the output for your track(s) to the output
that you have your monitor speakers plugged into. If you use the main
outputs in your interface, these are usually assigned to outputs 1 and 2
in your system. (You can assign them however you want — check your
manual for the specifics on doing this.) Set your outputs to channels 1
and 2 and turn on your monitors.
 Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: Because SIAB systems have fader banks,
make sure that you designate the track channel to monitor rather than
the input channel. After you’ve chosen the track channel that you want
to listen to, bring up the fader to a level that allows you to hear what’s
going to disk.
 Stand-alone systems with an analog mixer: You need to have the track
output from the recorder connected to an input channel of your mixer.
Check out your owner’s manual or go to Chapter 4 to find out how to 
do this.
Saving Your Work
After you record a track that you want to keep, you can save the song. Stand-
alone recorders automatically save a track after you record it (much like a
tape recorder). If you use an SIAB system or a computer-based system, how-
ever, you need to save the file just as you save a file when you’re working in a
computer program. And like other files in other computer programs, it’s a
good idea to save your work often so that you don’t lose any of the music
that you worked so hard to record. Check your owner’s manual for your
system’s procedures.
In addition to basic file-saving commands, most digital systems (computer-
based and SIAB) allow you to save individual “scenes” or “snapshots” within
each song that contain things such as mixer and effects settings.
194
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

Sharing Files with Others
Because your music is stored on a hard drive, you can transfer the data to
other systems. The advantages of file sharing are far-reaching. You can col-
laborate with other people without ever being in the same room together. In
fact, I’m working on several projects where I’ve never sat down with the
other musicians. One such musician is even across the country from me. We
just create CDs with our parts on them and send the CDs back and forth.
This disadvantage of file sharing is that digital recording technology is rela-
tively new and, as such, a single standard for saving data hasn’t emerged.
Some recorders use proprietary file formats that only a system from the same
manufacturer can open. This is the case for all the Roland SIAB systems
except the newest machine, the VS-2480. Computer-based systems, on the
other hand, often allow you to save your data in a number of file formats.
All is not lost if you have a system that has a proprietary file format. All digi-
tal recorders have jacks in them that enable you to transfer the data from one
system to another. This means that you can send your file from your system
to a computer and then use software to convert the file into a format that
another person’s recorder can read. (The software that you choose varies
depending on the systems that you want to transfer the files to and from.) If
you’re doing a lot of transferring, this can be time consuming, but for the
occasional transfer, it’s no big deal.
If you work with a system that can save files in the WAV or AIFF format, you
don’t have this problem, and you can easily transfer your stuff from one
machine to another. Also, if you’re transferring songs from one system to
another system of the same type (a Roland VS-890 to a Roland VS-1880, for
instance), you don’t have to worry about file conversion either.

O
kay, you’ve plugged in your instrument, set up your routing the way you
want it, gotten the levels just so, and chosen what you want to hear while
you play. Congratulations, you’re ready to record. Now the fun begins. . . .
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of recording some tracks for
your song. You start with your first take, move on to some overdubbing by
adding more tracks, and do some punching in and out to redo some parts.
You also explore the process of submixing to record multiple instruments
into just a couple of tracks.
Performing Your First Take
Your palms are sweaty, your pulse rate is up, and you’re hands are shaking as
you get ready to press the Record button. I know the feeling; I’ve been record-
ing for almost 20 years and still get a little tense when the tape, er, disk starts
to roll. There’s something about knowing that what you’re about to play is for
keeps (or at least could be).
Relax. Take a deep breath and remember that you’re both the artist and the
producer. You can take as many “takes” as it takes you to get a good “take.”
(Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. A take, by the way, is an attempt at a perfor-
mance.) Anyway, it’s normal to get a little nervous when you know the recorder
is capturing every sound that you make.

To do your first take, follow these steps:
1. Cue the beginning of the song.
Press 0 (zero) on a Roland VS-1680 or press the Stop button twice in
Logic or Cubase, for example.
2. Arm your track by pressing the Record Enable button or, in the case
of a Roland SIAB system, the Status button until it blinks red. Next,
arm the recorder by pressing the Record button until it flashes red,
and then press the Play button.
Presto, you’re recording.
3. When you’re done, press the Stop button and then press 0 or the Stop
button again to rewind.
4. To listen to your recorded track, you need to disarm the track that
you recorded to and set it to play. You accomplish this by pressing the
Track Status button until it turns green (or by deselecting the track —
just click the track bar).
Now you’re in playback mode.
5. Now, just adjust your channel fader on the track channel that you
recorded to and press the Play button.
Well, how does it sound? Good? Then you’re ready to record a different track.
If you don’t like the sound, you can record the part over again by rewinding,
rearming the track (press the Status button until you get the red blinking
light again), and pressing the Record button followed by the Play button. If
you’re like I am and make lots of mistakes, you’ll figure out how to do this
procedure at lightning speed.
Punching In and Out
Punching in and out refers to being able to overdub a section of a performance
(that guitar lick you keep missing, for example) while keeping the part of the
performance that you like. Punching in and out can be pretty simple: Play the
track and press the Record button when you want to start. Then press the
Stop button when you’re done. At least that’s how it used to be done.
With a digital recorder, you can set up the system to punch in and out a
number of ways. You can punch in and out manually either by using a nimble
finger to punch buttons or by using a foot switch. You can also program the
recorder to punch in and out automatically. If you go the automatic route,
you usually set up your system to punch in and out once, but in some cases,
you may want to re-record over the same part of the song a certain number
of times — a process known as loop recording.
198
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

Manual punching
Manual punching in and out is exactly what it sounds like: You manually press
the Record button when it’s time to start the punch, and you manually press
the Stop button when you’re done. This is the type of punch you do if you
have enough time between when you press the Record button and when you
need to start playing as well as when you stop playing the part and when you
can get to the Stop button. You may also do manual punching if you’re acting
as the engineer and someone else plays the instrument.
Punching with a foot switch
On most recorders, you can use a foot switch to punch in and out. This frees
your hands so that you can play your instrument while you do the actual
punching in and out.
Automatic punching
Automatic punching in and out is one of the many gifts from the digital
recording gods. This process allows you to fully concentrate on getting your
part right without having to worry about getting the punch right. With auto-
matic punching, you can replace very small passages or get into really tight
places with your punch.
For example, suppose you have one bad snare drum hit (I’ve been there many
times) that you want to replace. With automatic punch in/out, you can set it
to start recording right before that bad note and stop immediately after it,
leaving the rest of the notes untouched.
Even though each recorder is a little different in its autopunch procedure, all
recorders follow these basic steps:
1. Select the track you want to punch in and out of.
2. Arm the track by pressing the Select button until you get the red
blinking light.
3. Locate the punch-in point on your recorder.
You do this either by playing the song until you get to the point that you
want to punch in or by keying in the numbers for that section of the song.
4. Press the In Point (punch in) button on your recorder.
199
Chapter 11: Recording Audio

5. Locate the punch-out point on your recorder.
You do this either by playing the song until you get to the point that you
want to punch out or by keying in the numbers for that section of the song.
6. Press the Out Point (punch out) button on your recorder.
7. Press the Auto-Punch button on your recorder.
8. Rewind the recorder to just before the punch-in point.
9. Press the Record button followed by the Play button (some recorders
don’t require you to press the Record button first).
10. Play your part.
When you’re done, your newly recorded part is neatly placed in the song.
Repeated punching (looping)
If you have a tricky part to record and you know it will take you a few tries to
get it right, you can use the repeated punching (also called loop recording)
function. During the repeated punching procedure, the recorder keeps repeat-
ing the section within the loop until you press the Stop key, so you can try
recording your part as many times as you want without having to set up the
punch in and out procedure again.
This procedure uses the same basic steps as the automatic punch in and out
procedure, except that you also need to choose the section of the song that the
recorder plays before and after the actual punch times (called the loop start
and loop end points). For some systems, you can do this the following way:
1. Locate the place where you want to start the loop on your recorder.
2. Press the Locator button.
This stores the locate point you chose in Step 1.
3. Locate the place where you want the loop to end.
4. Press another Locator button to store this value.
5. Press and hold the Loop button.
6. While still holding the Loop button, press the Locator button that you
used to store the loop start point (Step 2).
7. While still holding the Loop button, press the Locator button that you
used to store the loop end point (Step 4).
8. Follow the steps for the automatic punch in and out that I list in the
previous section of this chapter.
200
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

Exploring Overdubbing
After you record one useable track, you can move to the next step: overdub-
bing. Overdubbing is simply adding another track to an already-recorded one.
Overdubbing is the heart of the multitrack recording process for most home
recordists and a technique that you will undoubtedly use and occasionally
abuse.
The overdubbing process is pretty straightforward. You simply follow the
procedures for recording a take while making sure that you’re monitoring the
recorded tracks that you’ve already made.
When you record an overdub, hearing certain parts that you recorded earlier
may throw you off. If this becomes a problem, you can turn down certain
parts in a mix and only listen to those parts that help you to perform the
overdub. For example, if you’re overdubbing the lead vocal and a dobro part
breaks your concentration on your lines or on hitting a note correctly, just
slide the fader for the dobro’s channel down a little (or a lot).
Submixing
At times, you may want to record a bunch of instruments, such as the drums
of a drum set, to one or two tracks. In this case, you need to create a submix of
the inputs before you commit them to disk.
201
Chapter 11: Recording Audio
Multitrack abuse
You have a recording system with 16 or more
audio tracks, a couple dozen MIDI tracks, and
countless virtual tracks (additional tracks in a
digital system that are hidden behind the main
tracks for recording variations of a part). What
do you do? Well, you do what anyone else in
your shoes would do — you try to fill all your
available tracks with instruments. After all,
that’s how you get really lush recordings, right?
Yeah, sometimes, but this could also be a recipe
for a bunch of mud. In fact, you can end up with
a super-lush recording by using just a handful
of tracks. Lushness is a product of the song’s
arrangement (how all the parts fit together)
rather than just the number of tracks.
One of the most difficult things about multitrack
recording is knowing how to use your tracks
most effectively and having the discipline to quit
when the song is done, regardless of whether
you’ve used all your tracks. So, remember that
just because you have the tracks available to
you, you don’t need to use them all.

Submixing is essential if you have a recorder with fewer tracks than you have
instruments. The advantage with creating submixes is that you can get by
with fewer tracks. The disadvantage is that you can’t make many changes to
the sound or volume of the individual instruments after you record them.
Recording by using submixes presents challenges that overdubbing doesn’t.
Here are some points to keep in mind:
 Make sure that each instrument sounds the way that you want it to
sound on the final mix. You can make minor adjustments to EQ and
effects, but only to the entire submix group.
 Before you record, make sure that each instrument’s volume is where
you want it relative to the volume of the other instruments.
 Decide where in the stereo field you want each instrument. This is called
panning and it determines how far left or right each instrument can be
heard. Panning is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.
This can take time to set up, but if you’re limited on available tracks, you can
record a lot of instruments on few tracks.
If you’re not sure exactly how you want the final submix to sound, you can
record more than one version onto separate tracks and use a bounce proce-
dure (see the following section) after you’ve recorded. This gives you more
time to experiment with alternate versions of your submix.
Bouncing
Bouncing is like submixing, but you do bouncing after you record the tracks.
For instance, you can record all your drum mics onto separate tracks initially
and then bounce (or combine) all those tracks onto one or two tracks later. In
most cases, you want to bounce to two tracks rather than one so that you
can maintain panning information in your final mix.
Bouncing has some advantages over submixing. You can take your time get-
ting each instrument to sound right before you group them together. On the
downside, you may not have this option if you are recording live and can only
put the drums on two tracks initially. In this case, you need to create a submix.
202
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

If you have the space to record the instruments to separate tracks initially,
here’s how you bounce the tracks down to two:
1. Decide which tracks you want to bounce, and route these tracks to the
tracks that you want to bounce to.
2. Adjust the EQ of each instrument to get the sound you want.
3. Adjust the panning of each instrument — use the panning knob
located above your mixer’s channel fader — so that the instrument is
where you want it in the stereo field.
Remember that you need to be bouncing to two tracks for panning 
to work.
4. Set the levels of each instrument relative to one another.
5. Add any effects that you want to record with the instruments.
6. Press the Record button.
You can use virtual tracks (see the next section) to record several different
versions of your bounce. This gives you some options later when you’re
mixing. For example, set the track levels differently for each bounce — raise
the snare drum in one, change the EQ of the hi-hats in another, and so on.
Keeping Track of Your Tracks
One of the great things about digital recording systems is the number of
tracks that are often available. Computer-based systems, for example, often
have unlimited numbers of tracks (or obscenely high numbers), and many
SIAB systems offer virtual tracks. Virtual tracks are additional tracks that are
hidden behind the basic tracks of the system. They allow you to record vari-
ous takes of a performance on separate tracks, but only one virtual track can
be played at a time. Virtual tracks are great when you’re not sure whether
you like a particular take and it’s not bad enough to record over.
Having all these tracks is great except it can be daunting to keep (ahem)
track of all of them. My recommendation: Use track sheets to document all
your tracks. Track sheets are forms where you enter basic information for
each of your recorded tracks, such as what instrument, take, and performance

section are included. This gives you a visual representation of your song’s
components and makes it easier to choose which performances to include in
your final mix. Here are some Internet resources to get you started:

R
ecording and editing MIDI tracks are similar to the process you under-
take with audio. The main difference is that MIDI tracks contain perfor-
mance data instead of sound. This offers the advantage of being able to
choose the sound or instrument you want to “play” your data on later, after
you’ve finished recording. Of course, this also provides the temptation not to
make a decision on your sound.
In this chapter, I get you started recording MIDI by walking you through the
process of synchronizing a variety of MIDI devices. Then I give you the low-
down on recording your tracks, adding to them with overdubs, and editing it
all in some of the many ways that most sequencers allow you to. To top it off,
I offer a little advice about saving and transferring MIDI data.
Synchronizing Your Devices
To do any kind of music with MIDI, you need to synchronize your devices to
one another. The first thing you have to do is decide which device is going to
send the MIDI commands (called the master) and which devices are to receive
them (called the slave). The process for synchronizing MIDI devices varies
slightly from configuration to configuration. You can get a glimpse into a few
possibilities in the following sections.

Synchronizing two (or more) synthesizers
In this first scenario, you synchronize a synthesizer and a sound module (or
another synthesizer). In this case, your keyboard is the master because this
is the instrument that you actually play. Start by attaching the MIDI cable to
the out port of the keyboard and to the in port of the sound module. Figure
12-1 shows the setup for two synthesizers. If you have more than two devices,
you can run a cable from the thru port of the second device to the in port of
the next one, and so on. You can connect up to 16 devices this way.
The next steps involve configuring each device in the chain so that each device
recognizes its place and responds only to those messages that you assign to
it. Keep in mind that all devices operate differently, so I can’t walk you through
the exact steps for your instruments. Be sure to read your owner’s manual for
your device’s specific procedures. The following steps give you a general idea
of the process involved in synchronizing two synthesizers:
1. Go into your master keyboard’s system parameters and choose Master.
This is generally a dialog box located within the software of your device.
2. Choose Slave for each of your other devices.
You usually do this by going into the MIDI synchronization menu in your
software.
3. Make sure that each device in your chain is set to mode 3 or 4,
depending on whether you want polyphony.
4. Assign a MIDI channel for each device that’s down line (connected to
the out port) from the master.

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

You can find channel assignments within your device’s system parame-
ters. For example, in a ddrum4 sound module, you press the System
button until the light next to the word “MIDI” illuminates. You then use
the dial to choose the MIDI channel that you want to use.
You can choose from 16 channels (1–16), but if you have a drum
machine, set it to channel 10 because this is the default drum channel
for GM (General MIDI) devices.
5. Play the master keyboard.
This makes your other MIDI devices play the appropriate sounds (hope-
fully). If you don’t hear anything, make sure that you have the appropri-
ate MIDI channel selected.
Synchronizing a computer sequencer 
and a synthesizer
If you’re using a computer or sequencer and want to synchronize it to a
sound module or synthesizer, you need to go through some additional steps.
These are:
1. Connect your synthesizer to the MIDI interface, and connect the MIDI
interface to your computer.
Run the appropriate cable from the MIDI interface to the appropriate
jack of your computer. For example, this can be a USB cable if you have
a USB computer and USB MIDI interface.
2. Connect the MIDI interface to your synthesizer.
You do this by connecting a cable from the MIDI out port of your synthe-
sizer to the MIDI in port of the interface. Then connect another cable
from the MIDI out port of the interface to the MIDI in port of the synthe-
sizer. This allows the MIDI communication to go both ways, as shown in
Figure 12-2.
3. If you’re using a synthesizer to play your MIDI sequences from your
computer, you need to set your synthesizer to local off mode. Then
enable the thru function in your sequencer program so that the MIDI
information that you send from the keyboard to the sequencer is sent
back to the keyboard.
Local off mode disables the keys from the sounds and makes the
sequencing process go much smoother. Enabling the thru function 
in your sequencer program enables you to hear what you’re playing
while you record your part.
207
Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

If you don’t set your synthesizer on local off, you create a feedback loop.
In a feedback loop, both your synthesizer’s keys and the sequencer are
sending the same messages to the sound generator in your synthesizer
and causing it to play each note twice. The best that can happen is that
you trigger each note twice and use up your polyphony faster. The worst
that can happen is echoed or stuck notes and possibly jammed messages,
which may cause your system to lock.
4. After you connect all the cables, be sure to choose the MIDI channel
that you want the track recorded to and set both the sequencer and
instrument to that channel.
You can find the MIDI channel selector within your device’s software.
Sometimes it is a combination of key commands (such as repeatedly
pressing the System button in a ddrum4 sound module). Other times, it
is a pull-down menu that you access from the top of your computer
screen. In Cubase, the channel selector for the sequencer is located just
to the right of the track name.
After you have your channel setup and your local off business out of the way,
you can play your synthesizer, see it register in the sequencer, and hear it
play. If you don’t, check all your settings.
Synchronizing a sequencer 
and an audio recorder
If your system does the sequencing inside the computer and your audio tracks
are recorded on either a stand-alone recorder or an SIAB (studio-in-a-box)

system, like the Roland VS-1880, you need to synchronize them. In this case,
your devices use timing data rather than communicating/responding with the
help of performance data.
You need to get both your sequencer and your recorder to recognize the
same timing data. You start this process by determining which device is the
master and which one is the slave.
The process that I describe in this section also works if you’re connecting a
synthesizer to a drum machine. Select the sequencer as the master device
and the drum machine as the slave.
You can choose either device to be the master. In this example, I outline set-
ting up your system with the SIAB system as the master and the sequencer as
the slave, as shown in Figure 12-3. You may be able to set up your system the
other way around (particularly if you have a stand-alone recorder connected
to a sequencer), but I chose this way because doing so allows you to use the
faders and transport functions (play, record, stop, and so on) in your SIAB
system. With some systems, you may be able to use your sequencer’s trans-
port and automation functions with this setup as well, which I discuss in the
section “Sequencing,” later in this chapter.
After you’ve chosen which device is the master and which is the slave, you
can start synchronizing your systems. These steps help you get going:
1. Choose Internal Synch in your master device’s Synchronization 
dialog box.

Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

Each device has a different procedure for this, so read your device’s
manual to find out how to choose the synchronization mode. In a Roland
VS-1680, press Shift+F5. Then press Synch (F6). A dialog box appears.
Use the dial to choose Internal Synch. Click the Exit button to return to
the main menu.
2. Choose External Synch in your slave device.
This can be a dialog box within the MIDI synchronization menu. For
example, in Cubase, choose Options➪Synchronization from the main
menu on the top of your screen. The external or internal synch choice is
on the upper left of the dialog box.
3. Choose either MIDI Time Code (MTC) or MIDI Clock for the timing
method.
In Cubase, for example, this option appears directly below the external
or internal synch option.
You ultimately want to choose the timing method that you prefer and the
one that works best for your gear. You can find out about these timing
methods in the nearby sidebar “MIDI Time Code, MIDI Clock, huh?”
4. If you chose the MTC mode, you need to choose a frame rate to go
with it.
For this example, set your frame rate at 24 fps (frames per second). You
should be synchronized at this point.
5. If you chose MIDI Clock in Step 3, you need to choose between tempo
map and synch track.
For more on these options, see the nearby sidebar “MIDI Time Code,
MIDI Clock, huh?”
6. Press the Play key in your master device to see whether your slave
device responds.
If it does, you’re set to go; if it doesn’t play, double-check your settings.
Your timing settings probably aren’t exactly the same.
Using the transport function from 
one device to control another
Another aspect of synchronization can enable you to use the transport func-
tion (play, stop, record, and so on) from each device to control the other.
This is the MIDI Machine Control (MMC) function. The MMC function is
located within the Synchronization menu of your device’s software. (You can
find this in the same place as the MTC synch in most systems.) MMC allows
210

Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
MIDI Time Code, MIDI Clock, huh?
When you try to synchronize two devices using
MIDI timing messages, you’re met with several
choices. One is between MIDI Time Code (MTC)
and MIDI Clock. The other is frame rates and
tempo map or synch track. This can be confus-
ing, so this sidebar contains a brief overview of
these options.
MIDI Time Code uses absolute time in its mes-
sages (the actual time on the clock from the
beginning of the song or reference point in
hours, minutes, seconds, frames, and sub-
frames). This data can then be translated into
SMPTE messages (the kind of synchronization
data used in film and television). If you choose
MTC, you also have to decide the frame rate for
the time code. Several frame rates are avail-
able, and each is associated with certain medi-
ums. They are as follows:
 24 fps (frames per second): This rate is
mainly used for films.
 25 fps: This is for audio, video, and film
equipment used in Europe and other places
that use the SECAM or PAL formats.
 29.97 fps: This is for color televisions used
in the United States, Japan, and other
places that employ the NTSC format.
 30 fps: This rate is used for black-and-white
television in the United States (Europe’s
black-and-white TVs use the 25-fps rate).
If this isn’t confusing enough, both the 29.97-
and 30-fps rates also have either drop frame or
nondrop frame formats. This gets pretty tech-
nical, but drop frame formats basically drop 
two frames every minute, except for the tenth
minute, so that the timing data match the clock
exactly. These are generally used for live 
video feeds.
MIDI Clock is different from MTC in that it tracks
the time of a song in beats and measures rather
than minutes and seconds. MIDI Clock mes-
sages are generally sent every 1⁄24 of a beat, but
you can set most sequencer programs to much
higher resolutions than that. Cubase VST ver-
sion 5 can be set as high as, get this, 1,920 PPQ
(pulses per quarter note).
When you choose MIDI Clock, you need to
choose between using tempo map or synch
track, as follows:
 Tempo map: This is basically a layout of the
tempos and time signatures used in a song.
To use a tempo map to synchronize your
SIAB system and sequencer, you need to
create the map itself. Every system is a little
different in this procedure so I don’t go into
detail here.
 Synch track: A synch track is a track (at
least was a track on analog recorders) that
follows along with the tempo and measures
of a song. To use a synch track, you need to
first record one. If you have a digital
recorder, you most likely don’t need to take
up an actual track to do this.
So which do you choose? Unfortunately, that
question doesn’t have a clear answer. The
equipment that you have dictates part of your
answer. (For instance, the Roland VS-1680 SIAB
system can send MIDI Clock and MTC mes-
sages, but it doesn’t always effectively respond
to those messages.) The goals you have for 
your music dictate the other part. If you’re com-
posing music for film or TV, your choice is clear 
(24 fps and 29.97 fps, respectively).
If your equipment and musical goals don’t limit
your choice, choose what you like. Just make
sure that both machines have the same settings.

you to send machine control messages from the slave device to the master
device. For example, in the setup shown earlier in Figure 12-3, you can set
the sequencer to send MMC messages and the SIAB system to receive them.
Your sequencer must be set as follows:
 MTC slave – External synch
 24 fps
 MMC master
Your SIAB system in turn must be set as follows:
 MTC master – Internal synch
 24 fps
 MMC slave
These settings enable you to use either device’s transport functions to con-
trol the other. The MTC master sends the timing data, but each device sends
control messages to the other. Check with your system’s manuals to see
whether you can do this with your gear.
Sequencing
Sequencing is the heart of most home recordists’ MIDI studios because
sequencing allows you to actually record your instrument’s part and play it
back. If you’re like most people, the sequencing part of MIDI is what excites
you the most. With sequencing, you can play as many instruments as your
room can handle (or more, if you have long cords).
Sequencing is not unlike audio recording: You have the same transport func-
tions (start, stop, record, rewind, and so on), and you have the ability to
record each instrument on a separate track. This is where the similarities
between audio tracks and MIDI tracks end, however. As I’ve mentioned
before, MIDI sequencing deals with performance commands and not audio
waveforms. This opens a few doors that can come in mighty handy in the fol-
lowing situations:
 If you aren’t the greatest player in the world
 If you’re not sure what key you want the song to be in
 If you don’t know (or haven’t decided) what sounds you want to use
With MIDI sequencing, you can make a whole host of changes to your perfor-
mance after you’ve recorded it. You can change the placement or volume of
individual notes, you can change the song’s key, and you can change the
212
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

instrumentation (for example, you can have a brass ensemble play a part that
you originally wrote for the strings). One of the other great things about MIDI
sequencing is that you can capture a performance that you don’t have the
chops (skills) to pull off live.
Recording MIDI data
You can record a MIDI track in one of the following ways:
 Real-time recording: Play the part as you would for a regular audio
recording.
 Step-time sequencing: Manually input the music one note at a time.
Step-time sequencing is a great tool if you don’t have the skills to per-
form that part in real time.
The MIDI tracks in most sequencer software programs look virtually the same
as the audio tracks except for a small icon. Logic, for instance, has an M icon,
and in Cubase, you find a small musical note. Each icon is located to the left
of the track name. You generally engage the track that you want to record to
by clicking it once.
Preparing to record
Before you start to record a MIDI track, you need to make the following
adjustments to your setup:
 Make sure that your MIDI gear is synchronized. For details on how to
do this, check out the section “Synchronizing Your Devices,” earlier in
this chapter.
 Set your levels and the patch (sound) that you want to hear. Setting
levels simply means setting the volume that you hear through your 
monitors at a comfortable level.
To choose the sound that you want to hear, you can select the sound in
your synthesizer, in which case the sequencer recognizes this setting, or
choose the sound within the sequencer program. This process is done
differently for each type of sequencer, but most of them have a track
menu located to the left of the screen that applies to the track you 
have engaged.
Figure 12-4 shows a basic track menu setup in a sequencer program. In
this figure, the patch is set for program 58, bank 0 (short for Sound #58
in one of the sound module’s banks of sounds). Most sound modules
also give you the patch name, such as “program 1, bank 0, acoustic
grand piano.” (My ddrum4 doesn’t show the patch name, so it’s not
included in the figure).
213
Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

 Set your metronome to the tempo that you want to record to. You do
this by opening the Metronome Settings menu (which is often located on
the Options menu). Choose the tempo and time signature for your song,
and you’re set to go.
Within the Metronome Settings menu, you can also choose the MIDI note
that the metronome sounds on, whether you have a count in before the
song actually starts (called a preroll), and more.
You don’t need to set the tempo for a song ahead of time. You can always
adjust this later. In fact, you can set the tempo slower than the final version
so that you can play the part slower and get the notes right. This can be
especially beneficial if the part is difficult or if you’re not the greatest player
in the world. Just be sure to set the tempo to its final speed before you start
recording audio tracks because you can’t change the tempo of the audio
tracks later like you can with MIDI tracks.
Real-time recording
If you’re recording in real time, just press the Record button and start playing.
You can find the Record button on the Transport Bar if you use a computer-
based software program (this can be found on the Windows menu in Logic,
for example). On a Roland VS-1680, it’s the red button on the lower left of the
device. (Don’t forget to wait until the preroll is finished if you have that func-
tion engaged.)

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

If your recorded performance is the way you want it, you can move on to
another instrument’s part. Just set up a new track to record the sound that
you want on the MIDI channel that you prefer. If you don’t like your perfor-
mance, you have the following options:
 Re-record your part from the beginning.
 Re-record only those sections that don’t sound right. Re-recording
parts of a performance is generally referred to as punching in and out.
This involves setting your recorder to just record a section of your per-
formance, as described in Chapter 11.
 Edit the performance. I discuss the details of editing in the section
“Editing your data,” later in this chapter.
Step-time sequencing
Step-time recording involves entering your part one note at a time. This can
take a long time to do, especially if it’s a difficult part (one with lots of notes).
But step-time recording may be your only option if you don’t have the skills
to play the part live.
Most sequencer programs include a step-time recording mode. Select this mode
and then click the Record button. You enter your part by selecting the note
value (eighth note or sixteenth note, for example) for the first note or chord.
Then when you play the note on your keyboard, it is entered into the sequencer.
Choose your next note, press the key(s) you want to record, and so on.
Some sequencers allow you to go into a score window and enter your notes
that way. If you can read music, this can be much easier and faster than the
traditional step-time mode. Just choose the note’s duration from the menu
bar and click the place where you want that note to be. After you get the
hang of this method, step timing can be pretty quick. Check your sequencer
program’s manual for details.
Overdubbing
After you record some MIDI performances, you can easily add to or change
them. The time-honored name for this kind of recording is overdubbing.
Overdubbing MIDI performance data is similar to overdubbing your audio
data. Most programs allow you to overdub in several ways: manually punch-
ing in and out, punching automatically, and loop punching. In addition,
because MIDI is strictly performance information with no actual sound, most
recording programs allow you to either replace or merge existing MIDI data
when you overdub.
215
Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

Using MIDI Merge/Replace
When you overdub to a MIDI track, many MIDI recording programs offer you
the option to either replace existing material or add new data to it. For exam-
ple, in Pro Tools, you make this selection by clicking the MIDI Merge/Replace
button. This button is located in the Transport window, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Here’s how it works:
 When the Merge/Replace button is engaged (MIDI Merge mode), new
material is merged with existing MIDI data on the record-enabled track(s).
 When the Merge/Replace button is disengaged (MIDI Replace mode), new
MIDI data replaces existing information on the record-enabled track(s).
To engage MIDI Merge in Pro Tools, follow these steps:
1. Open the MIDI controls section of the Transport window by choosing
Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls.
The Transport window expands to include the MIDI controls section.
2. Click the MIDI Merge button.
The button becomes highlighted.
Most MIDI sequencers have a similar function, but by default, any overdubs
you do are placed in a new sequence — leaving the original intact.
Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and want to record over only part of it,
you can set points at which to start and stop recording within the session.
This is called punching in and out.
As is the case with audio tracks, most programs allow you to punch into MIDI
tracks in several ways. These include punching in and out manually, automati-
cally, and repeatedly (looping). With the exception of being able to choose to
merge your punched data with your original performance or being able to
Figure 12-5:

there.
216
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

replace it, punching into and out of MIDI tracks is the same as punching into
and out of audio tracks. I detail the exact procedures for performing these
punches in Chapter 11.
Editing your data
The editing capabilities for MIDI tracks are quite extensive. Not only can you
perform the typical cut, copy, and paste functions, but you can also quantize
(adjust the timing of a note) and transpose (adjust the pitch of a note), which
I cover in the sections to follow. Heck, you can even fix a single bad note if
you want to.
In most newer sequencer programs, you have the following three ways of 
performing edits:
 Piano-roll graphic window: This is the most common way to edit MIDI
performances. Look at Figure 12-6. In this window, the horizontal bars in
the center are the MIDI notes recorded on the track. Each of these notes
can be lengthened, shortened, and moved. Also, just above the note
grid, a bar tells you the note’s start time and length, pitch, velocity
(volume — both on and off), and MIDI channel. Each of the parameters
can be adjusted by typing a value. The top of this window contains navi-
gation tools, more editing options, and quantization values (the note
value used to adjust the timing of a performance). Just select the note
and you can do any of these editing functions.
Figure 12-6:
The piano-
roll window
lets you do 
a variety 
of editing
functions.
217
Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

 Score window: If you read music, the score window may be your choice
for editing. This window looks just like a piece of sheet music. Within
this window, you can move notes around in much the same way as the
piano-roll window. The only difference is that you get to see the musical
score as you do it. Some sequencers allow you to print the score as well.
This can be handy if you’re composing music that you want other
people to play.
 Events list: If you’re a real computer geek (you know who you are), you
may prefer the data-filled look and feel of the Events list editing menu.
This menu shows you the list of MIDI events that make up your track.
Look at Figure 12-7. This menu shows all the performance and MIDI com-
mands for that track. The only thing you may not find in this menu,
depending on the sequencer program that you have, is the actual note
that you played, so you may not be able to change that data. But you
can edit every other part of your performance.
Quantization
Quantization is simply allowing the sequencer to fix your rhythmic timing.
Say you recorded a drum pattern, and because you played it on your key-
board, the timing kinda stinks. The bass drum missed the downbeat, and the
snare drum is inconsistent. Don’t worry — you don’t need to re-record your
Figure 12-7:

them.
218
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 

part. You can just move all those notes into their proper places — and you
don’t even have to touch each of those notes to do it. Just choose the quanti-
zation value and click a button.
The quantization value determines the subdivision to which the quantization
feature moves the notes. For example, if you choose a quantization value of
16, all your notes are moved to the nearest sixteenth note. With most
sequencers, you can choose a number of quantization values, including
eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and thirty-second notes.
Most new quantizers also allow you to assign a percentage to the quantization
value. For example, a setting of 50 percent moves the note halfway between
where you played it and the next quantization point designated by your quan-
tization value. The higher the number, the closer to the actual quantization
point your note will go. This feature is essential in keeping quantized music
from sounding stiff.
Double-check your track after you’ve quantized it because it may have moved
a misplaced note in the wrong direction. This happens if your note is farther
away from where you want it to be than it was to another quantization point.
If a note has moved in the wrong direction, select that note and move it to
where you want it.
Transposing
Imagine that you write a song that you plan to sing but then you meet someone
with a great voice who wants to sing it. The only problem is that you already
recorded all the parts and this great singer’s voice is in a completely different
range than yours. The song would sound so much better if it were raised a
couple of keys. Well, if your recorded tracks are MIDI, you simply go to the
Options menu, choose Transpose, and type in the change of key. Presto, your
whole song has changed key, and you didn’t have to re-record a single part!
Try doing that with your audio tracks.
Saving Your Data
For the most part, saving data in your sequencer program is like saving data
in any computer program. Yep, you need to click the Save button (or press 
Ô-S if you have a Mac). Don’t forget to save your work regularly, lest your
computer crashes and you lose several hours’ work.
The main thing to know about saving data in a sequencer program is that
most programs have their own proprietary file format. You generally can’t
take a saved file from your program and play it on another one.
219
Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data

If you want to play your MIDI tracks on another sequencer program or make
it available on the Internet for other people to play, make sure that you save
your music as an SMF (Standard MIDI Format) file. Nearly all sequencer pro-
grams allow you to save in this format. Some even do this by default. Check
your owner’s manual to see how to do this. Then you can give your MIDI
tracks to anyone who can play an SMF file, and if you recorded your stuff by
using a GM standard, it sounds just how you intended it to sound, regardless
of the listener’s gear.
Transferring Data Using MIDI
Another great thing about MIDI is that you can use the cable and ports to
send more than just MIDI performance information. Many manufacturers allow
you to send sound patches through the MIDI connection by using system-
exclusive messages. This can be a great tool. In fact, I own an electronic drum
set whose sounds can be changed and updated by connecting a MIDI cable
between the sound module (brain) and my computer. I can store gazillions of
sounds on my computer without cluttering up (or overloading) my drum
set’s brain. But wait, it gets even better. This manufacturer makes new
sounds available on its Web site to download for free! Yep, I can add new
sounds to my drum set without having to buy anything. You gotta love it!
Performing a data transfer via your MIDI connection is easy. Just connect
your device to the MIDI interface on your computer, open the data-transfer
software provided by the manufacturer, and follow the directions.

can edit to your heart’s content without sacrificing sound quality and without
losing your original tracks.
In this chapter, you discover the joys of fixing a performance with editing. I
cover the basics and try to help you find out whether your editing style is
visual or auditory. You also explore the ways that you can use the editing
capabilities of your digital system to create a performance that never hap-
pened by creating loops, assembling song sections, and making composites
from virtual tracks.
The way you edit your tracks depends on your digital recording system.
Some systems, such as computer-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations),
use tools similar to those in word processing programs. Other systems, such
as stand-alone systems and SIAB (studio-in-a-box) systems, base their editing
methods on traditional audio approaches. I can’t possibly cover all the vari-
ables that exist in the many types of systems, but what I can do is show you
the basics so that you understand what possibilities exist. Hopefully you get
enough of a glimpse into the world of audio editing that you can then apply
these skills to the system that you own.
Some people never do any editing of a recorded performance except to get
rid of unwanted noise. What gets to disk is what they use. I rarely do any edit-
ing except for making the occasional loop and/or getting rid of a stray bad
note. You may be like I am and have little use for the amazing tools available
in most digital systems’ editing menus. That’s okay; don’t feel like you have

to use every capability of your system. On the other hand, if editing fits your
style, don’t be afraid to pull out all the stops and get creative.
Understanding Digital Editing
In the old days of analog tape, you needed to break out the razor blade and
adhesive tape to do audio editing. Cutting out a performance was exactly 
that — physically cutting the performance from the tape that contained the
audio. The problem was that after you finished the cut and taped the open
ends back together, you couldn’t reassemble the original performance. (Well,
I suppose you could try to peel that tape off the new joint and tape the part
you cut out back in again.)
And it got even worse. If you wanted to edit a single track, you had to cut a
little window in the tape where that part was, only in the track you were
working on. You were left with a hole in the tape.
And then consider this: While you were cutting and taping the tape, you were
touching it with your fingers and getting oils all over your precious tracks. The
result: sound degradation. In all, analog tape editing was messy work that
introduced unneeded stress on the tape (and perhaps the recordist) and
degraded the sound of the music.
Lucky for you, there’s a better way — digital editing. You can edit digitally by
using your hard-drive recording system. Digital hard-drive recording allows
you to do a staggering variety of things to your recorded tracks. You can cut,
copy, delete, erase, insert, move, and paste your music, among other things.
And the best part is that you can do any of these procedures and still change
your mind when you’re done.
This aspect of digital editing is called nondestructive editing, which means
that your original recording is kept intact (the recorder often makes a copy of
the original data before it makes the edits). On the other hand, the no-returns
policy of analog editing is referred to as destructive editing, and after it’s done,
you’re committed to the results, regardless of whether you like them.
Editing can be done in a variety of ways, and almost every recording system
does it a little differently. In the following sections, I list many of the basic
editing functions that a digital hard-drive system can perform.
Copy
The Copy command is universal in digital audio and does exactly what you
think — it makes a copy of a selected performance. Here’s how the different
systems generally work:
224
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Computer-based systems: Copy can work much like the Copy function
of your computer’s word processing program. A copy of your selection
is made and put into a clipboard section of your system. You can then
take that copy and paste it somewhere else in the song.
 Stand-alone or SIAB systems: These systems don’t necessarily place
copied material on a clipboard. Instead, you’re prompted to choose a
place to paste your work before you make the copy.
Many systems also allow you to choose how many times you want to copy
the part and choose whether you want to override the existing material
where you copy it or insert the new material into that section instead. If you
insert the copy, the existing material moves over and makes room for the
copied section.
Cut/Delete/Erase
The Cut, Erase, and Delete commands all do the same thing to the selected
section — it goes away. The difference is what happens to that material after it
disappears and what happens to the remaining material on the track; Figure
13-1 illustrates these differences. Here’s the lowdown on the commands:
 Cut: Lifts the selected audio section and puts it on a clipboard so that
you can place it somewhere else. On some systems, such as Cubase VST,
the rest of the audio track stays put, leaving an empty space where the
cut section was. On other systems (Logic Audio, for example), the exist-
ing material is brought forward to fill the space left by the cut material,
similar to the way that your word processing software deals with the Cut
command. Some systems, such as Cakewalk, allow you to choose
whether the existing material moves forward.
 Delete: Eliminates the selected material, keeping you from placing it 
anywhere else. Delete acts like an analog audio cut-and-tape procedure:
The material following the deleted section is brought forward to fill the
empty space. The Delete command is common among stand-alone
recorders like the Akai DR-16Pro and among SIAB systems such as the
Roland VS-1880.
Some computer-based systems, such as Pro Tools, have a Snap option
that treats existing material the same way as Delete. The Snap option
snaps existing material back to fill any space left by a cut section.
 Erase: Like Delete, Erase gets rid of the selected section and doesn’t
allow you to put the section anywhere else. Unlike Delete, Erase leaves a
hole in the audio where the selected section used to be. The remaining
audio stays put.
Most computer-based systems have a Silence procedure that acts just
like Erase. When material is “silenced,” an empty space is left where the
material used to be.
225
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Insert
The Insert function is common among stand-alone and SIAB systems. It
allows you to place a selected piece of music in a track (or multiple tracks)
and moves the music that exists after the insert point so that there’s room for
the inserted material (see Figure 13-2). This is a handy feature that lets you
add to a section without losing data.

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

For example, say you have a bridge section of a song that you wrote and
recorded to be 8 bars long, but after you’ve finished the song, you want to
add a guitar solo to the bridge and 8 bars just isn’t long enough (you guitar
monster, you!). You want the bridge to be 16 bars long instead. Well, rather
than having to re-record the entire song with the new bridge section, you can
copy the 8 bars that you have for the bridge and insert them at the end of the
existing bridge section, making the bridge 16 bars long. This only takes a
second to do, and you don’t have to plug in any mics or play any instruments.
If you have a computer-based system that doesn’t have an Insert function,
just select all the music immediately after the current bridge section and
move it over 8 bars by using your mouse. This leaves an 8-bar space that you
can then fill using the procedure I described previously.
If you have a song with a lot of tempo changes and you use a tempo map
(a function that allows you to set the tempo and time signature for each sec-
tion of the song), make sure that you double-check your tempo map after
you’ve made your edits because the tempo map won’t adjust automatically.
For example, if you add 8 bars to the bridge (like I describe in the earlier
example), you need to add 8 bars to that section of the tempo map to make
sure that the rest of the song remains accurate.
Paste
As obvious as this may sound, pasting is just placing your selected music some-
where. Like the Cut and Copy functions, this function is a staple for computer-
based systems, but it isn’t common among stand-alone or SIAB systems. In
most cases, Paste overwrites the existing material where you put it, as shown
in Figure 13-3, unless you have an Insert option and you use it. Some computer-
based systems treat Paste like a word processing program does — the exist-
ing material moves over and makes room for the pasted section.

227
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Like all computer Paste functions, whatever you put on the clipboard stays
there until you replace it with something else. So you can paste the same
selection as many times as you like.
Move
Nearly all digital recording systems have some sort of Move function. In most
cases, you can just choose the audio section that you want to move and
choose a destination for it. If you don’t have a Move function key, your system
probably has the Cut, Copy, and Paste options that you can use the same way.
Cut and Paste can move your music just as effectively as the Move function.
Moving audio data can be performed several ways depending on the system,
but you probably move data by using a Move menu or by clicking and drag-
ging. On the Move menu, you designate the section to be moved and where
you want to move it to. This can be within a particular track or from one
track to another. Within this menu, you may have the choice between over-
writing the material at the destination point with your selection or moving
the existing material to make space for the stuff that you moved. The latter is
sometimes called a Move/Insert procedure.
If you have a system that uses a large video monitor, a mouse, and a key-
board, you may have the option to just click and drag the selection where
you want it. In most cases, your moved selection overwrites the existing
material in its new place, effectively erasing it (although it may still be hidden
underneath — but you can’t hear it when you play back the track). In other
systems, the moved material is inserted in its new place, moving existing
material in the process. Your system’s owner’s manual should spell out how
this procedure is treated.
Export/Import
Exporting and importing involve moving music from one song file to another.
Some systems enable you to import a single track from another song,
whereas on other systems, you have to import everything in a song file.
If you can import only a whole song file but you just want a single track, just
make a copy of the song that you want to import and erase everything you
don’t need from that song. Then when you import the song file, you import
only the stuff that you want. Doing it this way rather than importing the
whole song file and then erasing the unwanted stuff afterward is quicker
because the computer doesn’t have to import more than you need.
228
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Undo
Undo is the most important key/function that you have in your digital system.
It allows you to, well, undo what you just did. Without it, you may as well be
trying to edit with analog tape, a razor blade, and adhesive tape.
How much you can undo depends on your system. Most systems give you at
least 99 levels of undo — that is, you can make 99 consecutive edits and
reverse them all (or just some of them). Some systems even go as far as
giving you 999 undos. How’s that for insurance? So edit at will, because you
can always change your mind later.
On the other hand, some systems, such as older versions of Logic Audio, have
only one level of undo. This isn’t a deficit, however, because this program
gives you the option of saving your selection before you make the edit. If you
choose to do this before each edit, you are essentially allowed as many
undos as you want, as long as you have the hard drive space to store all
those copies of your audio track.
Some systems, such as the Roland V-Studios, have a Song Optimize function.
Song Optimize enables you to save the song and throw away junk that you
don’t think you need, thus reducing the size of the song file. This is a nice fea-
ture except, after you optimize your song, you lose the ability to undo any-
thing you did before you optimized. So, if you think that you may want to
undo something you’ve done, don’t click that Optimization button!
As you can see by all the different ways that various programs use and define
editing procedures, you need to read your owner’s manual and be familiar
with your program to use these functions properly.
Finding the Section You Want to Edit
To use an editing function, you need to find the section of music that you
want to change. It can be the whole song from one track, a short musical
phrase from several tracks, or even a single note. The following sections deal
with the two basic ways that you can find the beginning and end of the sec-
tion that you want to edit. These are editing aurally and editing visually.
Each method has its advantages, and you’ll probably prefer one method over
the other for your working style. I’m from the old school and much prefer
editing by listening to the section I work with. I trust my ears much more
than my eyes. You may find that the opposite is true for you. But chances are
that you’ll use a little bit of both approaches for your music.
229
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Editing aurally
The traditional way to perform an edit is to play the song on the tape deck
until you reach the general area of the music that you want to edit. You then
stop the tape and manually rock it back and forth against the play head to
find the precise place to make the cut. You mark the back of the tape with a
wax pencil and go looking for the next edit point. This process requires care-
ful listening, and finding the exact spot to edit often takes quite a while.
For predigital people, such as myself, the manufacturers of digital systems
make this process similar to editing analog tape (yeah). Finding an edit point
aurally is often a two-step process: First you need to find and mark the general
section that you want to edit using a marker (also called an anchor point),
and then you need to identify the exact spot for your beginning and end
points. You do this with the Scrub function, as detailed in the following steps:
1. Listen to the song and place a marker (sometimes called an anchor
point) on the fly as the section you want to edit passes.
Do this by clicking the appropriate Marker button (the Tap key on a
Roland VS-1680, for instance). Mark both the beginning and end points
as accurately as you can. Your markers will be a little off, but don’t
worry about that now. Your next step involves honing those points using
the Scrub function.
2. Use the Scrub function that’s associated with your system to zero in
on the spot you need.
The Scrub function works much like analog tape where you can “rock”
the music back and forth (this is called scrubbing, hence the name) to
find the precise spot that you’re looking for. In some systems, such as
the Akai DR-16, you can use the Jog wheel to scrub with. Start from the
marker points that you set on the fly and dial the wheel back and forth
until you find the exact spot to edit. This may take a while, so be patient.
Do this for both the beginning and end points for your edit.
Other systems, such as the Roland VS-1880, don’t allow you to scrub like
analog tape. Instead, the Scrub function uses a short loop — from 25 to
100 milliseconds — that you scrub with. The overall process of scrub-
bing is the same, except you have a couple more steps to follow. The
Scrub feature on most digital recorders works pretty well; each just
works a little differently and one approach may work better for you.
Not all digital recorders have a Scrub feature that works as well as the old
analog tape rocking technique. So if being able to scrub is important to you,
be sure to test this feature on the systems you’re looking at before you buy.
230
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

If you have a computer-based system, you may find a scrub-type feature on
the Tool palette. In Cubase, for instance, the Scrub tool uses an icon that
looks like a small speaker. Look at your system to see whether you have this
function.
Editing visually
Digital recording systems, especially those that use large video monitors,
enable you to edit your music visually. This can be a great asset when you
want to edit sounds down to the waveform level or if you don’t want to
hassle with aural searching.
In visual editing, you choose your edit points by viewing the audio waveform
of a track on-screen. The audio waveform shows the amplitude (volume) of
the sound that’s recorded to disk. Check out Figure 13-4 for an example.
You can use the waveform as a guide to show you where a particular sound is
located. For example, if you pull up the waveform of a drum rhythm and set
the track to play, you can see where the various sounds of the drum set
(snare drum, kick drum, and so on) are located. Then just put a marker on
Figure 13-4:
The wave-
form editor
lets you see
the music,
making
editing
pretty easy.
231
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

the fly or stop the playback roughly where you want to be. As you get used to
hearing the music and seeing the waveform pass by on your computer
screen, you’ll be able to tell by looking at a waveform where a sound starts
and stops.
Take a look a Figure 13-4 again and find the cursor that’s located just before
the third large waveform. This is a snare drum note. You can select that sec-
tion in the following ways (some systems offer you several ways, while others
just have one):
 Click and drag to create a box around the section you want to edit.
This is generally the easiest way to choose a section of audio.
 Choose the numerical location points. On SIAB systems, which typically
don’t have a cursor or mouse to work with, you can do this quickly by
finding the point in the waveform and clicking a button (called the Now
button in the Roland SIAB systems). The data is entered into the box,
and you don’t have to type the numbers.
 Type the beginning and ending edit points in the appropriate dialog
box. This is an option if you have a computer-based system. If you have
a keyboard and you’re a fast typist, this may be the most efficient way
for you to choose edit points.
On most systems, you can zoom in or out on the waveform graphic for a
better look. You can often increase both the height (amplitude) and width
(time frame) of the image of the waveform that you see.
With most instruments that have slow attacks — a slow initial sound, as with
vocals or guitars — you can see the start of the sound by looking at the wave-
form. The beginning in the rise of the waves matches the beginning of the
sound. But on drums and other instruments with very fast attacks, the attack
of the instrument happens before the rise in amplitude. In fact, if you look
again at Figure 13-4, you can see a vertical dotted line just to the left of the
snare drum’s part in the waveform. This is where the attack starts for that
drum sound. If you were to rely only on your eyes and choose the waveform
part that you see, you would miss the initial point of the stick hitting the
drum (and all the character that it contains). What you would hear is a
mushy-sounding snare drum.
Even though you use the waveform screen to do editing, you still need to find
the beginning of that sound by using the Scrub function (described in the
preceding section). Just search the space before your drum note until you
hear where the attack starts. It’s usually about 40 to 50 milliseconds before
the waveform jumps up.
232
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Editing to Improve the Sound 
of a Performance
If you’re going to be editing your music, you need to know a couple of useful
skills. These include being able to edit individual notes and phrases, finding
and replacing notes that are too loud or too soft, getting rid of noise and dis-
tortion, and correcting pitch problems.
Replacing a bad note
Replacing a bad note is one editing procedure that I use frequently. Here’s an
example: A few weeks ago, I played the drum part of a new song for the band
I’m currently recording with. I really got into the groove — the feel was right,
I made all the changes, and I even did some really cool fills and stuff. When I
listened to the part after I finished recording, it sounded fine, so I went on to
record some other parts. But when I listened to it again a week later, I heard
one snare drum hit in which I caught the rim, and it sticks out in the mix like
the proverbial sore thumb. I could just punch in a new snare drum note, but
I’m lazy. Besides, I had already put away my mics, and there’s no way I could
set them up the way I did the day I recorded the drums, not to mention
tuning the drums exactly the same way I had them that day.
Well, here’s a time when I’m thanking my lucky stars that I have a digital
system that allows me to make minute edits (just try slicing a single snare
drum note out of an analog tape). Hopefully you won’t have to do this proce-
dure, but if you do, follow these steps:
1. Copy the track that you want to fix to another track in your system.
This way, you can reference the original track.
2. Place the copy on a track or virtual track that allows you to hear both
the original and the copy at the same time.
3. Listen for a snare drum hit that you especially like and select it by
using one of the techniques that I describe in the section “Editing
aurally,” earlier in this chapter.
4. Make a copy of the selection.
5. Find and mark the bad note.
6. Place the copy of the good note right where the bad note is.
The procedure for this varies depending on your system.
233
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Make sure that the Insert function is turned off. Otherwise, you add an
extra note and move the bad note over, along with the rest of the music
from that track.
7. After you have the good note in the place of the bad one, turn up the
volume of both versions of your track and listen to them again.
You should hear an exact copy of the track, except for that one note.
Listen carefully at the place of the replaced note for any timing prob-
lems. The two tracks should match perfectly. If they don’t, just use the
Undo function and try again. Also, check the rest of the song after that
note to make sure that you didn’t accidentally insert the note rather
than replace it.
If your system doesn’t allow you to make such a fine edit or if you can’t suc-
cessfully select a single note, you can replace a whole measure instead of just
the single note. Just follow the same steps and use a larger phrase instead of
the one note.
Evening out a performance
Evening out a performance means making adjustments to the levels of a note
or phrase within the song. Sometimes it can also mean changing the empha-
sis of certain notes to change the meaning or “feel” of a part. This section
covers these areas using two functions called Normalize and Quieten. It’s not
uncommon for a track to contain a stray note that is either much louder or
much softer than the rest of the notes around it. In this case, you don’t need
to cut it out and replace it with another note, like I did in the example in the
preceding section. Instead you can just make a change to the volume (or
level) of that note, as follows:
 To raise the volume of a note: Select the note that you want to change
and choose Edit➪Normalize. In most cases, Normalize allows you to
choose the maximum dynamic level (in dB) that you want the section to
be, the amount below clipping (0dB) that you want, or the minimum
headroom you want to have left (also in dB). These last two options are
essentially the same thing.
 To lower the volume of a note: Select the note that you want to change
and choose Edit➪Quieten. This lowers the amplitude of the selected 
section by a predetermined amount. On some systems, you can choose
this amount.
234
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

If you know where your levels are in decibels (dB), you can also choose
Edit➪Normalize to reduce the level of a note. In the dialog box that appears,
choose a value that’s lower than the peak of your selected note. For example,
if you have a drumbeat that is too loud — right at 0dB — and the surrounding
notes are at –6dB, you can then choose 6dB for either the minimum head-
room you want to have left or the amount below clipping. This drops your
signal by 6dB — the level of the rest of the notes. If you don’t know where
your levels are in dB, you can experiment until you get the level where you
want it. Using the Normalize function to reduce the volume of a note may be
better than using the Quieten function if you want to control exactly how
much quieter you want the note and your system doesn’t allow you to set the
value used by the Quieten function.
You’re not limited to making adjustments to single notes. You can also use
Quieten or Normalize to adjust the levels of short phrases or an entire track.
Normalize and Quieten only adjust the levels of the section that you choose
to work with. So when you use these functions, be aware of how your edits
relate to the music in and around your edits. For example, if you normalize or
quieten a section of the waveform, the softest notes increase in volume only
by the level that the highest note increases. For example, Figure 13-5 shows a
saxophone line before and after normalizing to maximum dB. The view on the
left shows the levels before normalization. The one on the right is after the
normalization procedure. The notes were raised a bit, and the overall
dynamic range remains the same.
Next, take a look at Figure 13-6. This shows what happens when you choose
the quietest section to normalize. As you can see, the relationship between
the various notes has changed dramatically. Played back, this passage now
sounds unnatural, and the original performance is altered beyond recognition.
Figure 13-5:

235
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

You can use normalization to change the emotional content of a piece of
music — even its meaning — by changing where the emphasized (accented)
notes are located. For example, take the phrase “I love your music” (a phrase
that I hope you hear a lot). Depending on which word of the phrase is empha-
sized, you get a slightly different meaning:
I love your music.
I love your music.
I love your music.
I love your music.
These are slight variations but ones that can alter how the listener perceives
something. In the same way, by changing the level of a note or phrase, you
can change the emotion of the performance.
Getting rid of distortion
In Chapter 10, I am adamant about getting your levels set so that you don’t
get digital distortion. Even if you follow my advice and are extremely diligent
in making sure that you didn’t get any digital clipping, one note may have
snuck through anyway. Well, it may not be the end of the world.
If you have a system that allows you to adjust the individual waves of a wave-
form, just reduce the level of the single clipped note. You do this by zooming
in as close as you can to the distorted note and choosing only that one note
to quieten. (Your system’s manual should clearly explain this procedure.) If
you can’t adjust the waveform, you need to replace that note with a good,
undistorted one (if you can find one) or reduce the level of that note until the
distortion is hidden.

236
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

If this is the lead vocal, you probably don’t have the option to reduce the
level, and replacing a bad note in a vocal part generally sounds unnatural. If
you can replace the section with another phrase from the song, this is your
best bet. If you don’t have that option and you can’t re-record the part, you
can mask the distortion by adding a little distortion as an effect to the entire
vocal track — a procedure that’s performed more often than you may expect.
Getting rid of noise
No matter what you do when recording, you’re going to end up with extra
noise, such as a chair squeak, a cough, or too much breath from the singer.
To get rid of the noise, just select the noise and follow your system’s proce-
dures for erasing or silencing a selection. When you do this, be sure that you
don’t have a Snap function engaged; you don’t want the material following
the erasure to move.
Correcting pitch problems
It used to be that if you sang or played an out-of-tune note, you had to record
it over again. If you’re singing is mediocre (like mine on a good day), you
could spend hours trying to get every note just right. And after all these
hours of fixing out-of-tune notes, you’re often left with a performance that
lacks “feel” (emotional impact). Well, those days are behind you. You can now
edit your sour notes using a pitch-correction program. You can find pitch cor-
rection on nearly all digital recording systems that have effects processors
included in them (computer-based and SIAB systems in particular).
To correct pitch, choose the note or notes that you want to correct and then
choose the pitch-correction option on your editing menu. In the dialog box
that appears, choose the amount of change that you want. You may need to
experiment a little to find just the right pitch.
Some devices, such as Antares Autotune, make the correction for you auto-
matically. (Antares Autotune is available as both a stand-alone processor and
as a plug-in for a computer-based system. You can find these components at
most major musical instrument retailers.) And some pitch-correction pro-
grams, such as the one in Logic Audio, allow you to adjust not only the
change in fundamental pitch but also the pitch change of that note’s harmon-
ics. This can produce a much more natural sound.
Unless you’re going for a particular effect, be judicious in your use of pitch
correction because it can suck the life out of a performance. Sometimes the
slightly out-of-tune notes are what give a performance its character.
237
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Pitch correction is often part of the system’s editing functions, but it can be
used as an effect as well. Check out Chapter 15 to find some ways that you
can use pitch shifting to add depth to your music.
Creating a Performance 
That Never Happened
Editing can be much more than just fixing a bad note or phrase — editing can
consist of assembling a performance that never really happened. In the fol-
lowing sections, I walk you through the often-timesaving process of putting
together a song from small parts: one or two measure loops, single sections
such as verses and choruses, and parts of separate performances from vir-
tual tracks (called a composite take). Doing these procedures has some
advantages for you as a recording engineer. For example:
 By creating loops, you don’t have to play the same 1- or 2-bar phrase
over and over again for the duration of the song.
 By assembling song parts, you can alter the song’s structure any way
that you want.
 By making composite takes, you can create a performance that you
could never play in one pass.
Creating loops
Loops are repeated phrases within a song. Looping has been around since the
beginning of multitrack recording. You used to have to make an actual loop of
tape containing the music that you wanted to repeat — thus the name loop —
and load the loop into an analog tape deck to play repeatedly. This tape deck
was then connected to the multitrack deck, and the looped performance was
recorded onto that deck.
Now all that looping can be done digitally. You can make loops of any instru-
ment, but the most common ones involve drum rhythms. For example, each
section of a song usually contains a short 1- or 2-bar rhythm that repeats
many times. By using loops, you can just play the drum part once and make
copies of it for the rest of the measures in that section. This saves you from
having to play for the whole song. Looping can be a great feature if you play
an instrument live and if keeping the part steady is fairly difficult.
238
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Making loops is easy: Just select the section that you want and copy it to the
end of your existing rhythm for as many times as necessary. Keep the follow-
ing points in mind when looping, however:
 Make sure that your beginning and end points are accurate. If you
choose beat 1 of the measure, choose beat 1 of the next measure (that
is, if you want a 1-bar loop). If you’re off just a little bit, this affects the
feel and timing of the rhythm.
 Choose a point in the rhythm with a sharp attack. An example is the
downbeat with the kick drum or the snare drum back beat on beat 2.
This helps you find the exact beginning and ending points for your loop.
 When you record the part, set a metronome (click track) in your
system and play along to it. This creates a clear point from which you
can find your edit points.
 Give your looped music a more human feel. To do this, overdub fills
and embellishments onto another track (Chapter 11 covers overdubbing
in detail). Then either adjust the mix so that you mute the main groove
when the fill happens or place your fill directly into the groove track
(Chapter 14 has details on mixing). Some songs and styles of music can
work well if you let the fills and the groove happen at the same time, so
experiment and use the approach that you prefer.
Assembling a song
Okay, you’ve recorded all the parts for your new song and have the arrange-
ment and structure the way that you thought you wanted it. But suddenly (or
maybe not so suddenly), you wonder what the song would sound like if you
started with the chorus instead of the first verse. (I know this isn’t common,
but go along with me here.) All you have to do is choose the chorus from all
the tracks in the song and copy or move the tracks to the place where you
want them to be.
Today, many musicians play just a portion of a song and assemble the song
from there. For instance, except for the lead vocal, you can just record one
verse and one chorus on each instrument. You then go into your editor
palette and put the song together. This lets you alter the song’s structure
quickly and easily.
This procedure is pretty simple: Just choose your musical section and then
cut, copy, or paste it to where you want it. If your system doesn’t have the
Cut and Paste functions, you can use the Copy and Move functions instead.
(All of these functions are described earlier in the chapter.)
239
Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Making composites of your tracks
If you used your digital system to record several versions or takes of a part
onto different tracks (also known as virtual tracks in some systems — tracks
hidden behind a main track), you can use the editing function of your system
to blend the best parts of each performance into one perfect track. Take, for
example, a lead guitar part that may be used throughout the song to act as a
counterpoint to the lead vocal. Now assume that you weren’t sure when you
recorded the part what you wanted to do for each phrase. In this case, you
would have recorded several versions of this guitar part onto different tracks
in your system (or onto several virtual tracks of one track). I explain this pro-
cedure in Chapter 15.
To make a composite track of the best parts of your various lead guitar takes,
choose the parts that you want to use and move them all onto one more track
(assuming that you have another empty track or virtual track to put them on).
Keep in mind that you need to move each of the good parts one at a time
because they’re each on separate virtual tracks.
You can move your guitar parts in one of the following ways:
 Click and drag your selection to the new virtual track.
 Use the Move function in your recorder to simply move the part from
one virtual track to another.
 Use the Cut and Paste functions to cut the part from one virtual track
and paste it to another.
When you’re done assembling all the parts of one track, such as the lead
guitar track, you can make adjustments to volume differences between the
various assembled pieces using the Normalize or Quieten functions
(described earlier in the chapter in the section “Evening out a performance”).
Discovering Other Ways to Use Editing
Aside from being able to fix problems in your tracks or to make changes to
the structure of a song, you can use editing to make some of your other work
easier. The following sections cover a couple of ways that the editing capabil-
ities of your digital system can be used outside the box, so to speak.
240
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Making adjustments to the 
length of a performance
Time compression and expansion allow you to make small adjustments to the
length of a section of music. This can be useful if you’re trying to match your
music to a video or if you want to change the feel of a vocal performance. For
example, you can slow the last word in a phrase to give it a more crooner-
type sound, or you can match certain words to rhythmic accents in the
music. You can also fix a poorly performed drum fill (one that speeds up 
or slows down).
To compress or expand a section, you use a function called — at least on
some systems — Time Stretch. To use it, select the music that you want to
edit and fill in the parameters in the Time Stretch dialog box. You see the
Time Stretch dialog box from Cubase in Figure 13-7.
Reversing a phrase
Being able to change the waveforms of your music can open a lot of possibili-
ties for experimentation. I’m sure you’ve listened to a recording and been
told that a subliminal message was hidden within the music. Of course, The
Beatles were famous for putting reversed vocals in the back of the mix, and
you can do this easily as well. Just record a vocal phrase like “Buy Jeff
Strong’s CDs,” select it, and then choose Edit➪Reverse. Presto, you have a
subliminal message (sit back and watch my CD sales go through the roof!).

Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance

Reversing a musical phrase can be used in many more ways than to peddle
my sorry music, however. For example, you can add a reversed drumbeat or
cymbal crash to add anticipation. This was overused in the ’80s, but I think it
can still be effective, depending on the style of music that you play.
To do this procedure, follow these steps:
1. Select a drumbeat (be sure to get the initial attack) and copy it to an
empty track.
2. Place the end of your selection where the drumbeat that you want to
anticipate begins.
3. Choose Edit➪Reverse to reverse the phrase.
If you play both tracks, you hear a reversed snare go right into a regular
snare hit. Both attacks should happen at the same time. If they aren’t
exact, just move the reversed one over until the attacks are the same.

A
fter you have all your tracks recorded, edited, and cleaned up as much
as possible, it’s time to turn all those individual parts into music. This is
the act of mixing. Mixing involves setting levels, setting EQ (equalization, or
adjusting the frequency response of your tracks), using stereo panning (plac-
ing your instruments from left to right in your mix), and adding effects so that
your song tells the story that you want it to tell. How you mix your song has
as much impact on the way it sounds as each of the individual parts that
you’ve recorded — more so, in fact. Even minor adjustments in the relation-
ship between the various instruments in your song can have dramatic
impacts on how the song affects your listeners.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the process of mixing your music. You get a
chance to take advantage of neat tools like the aforementioned EQ, effects,
and stereo panning to make all your instruments fit in the mix. You discover
how to reference your music to other people’s recordings and how to train
your ears so that your mix “translates” to different types of playback systems.
Mixing music is a subjective thing. How you have one instrument relate to
another can be done in an almost infinite variety of ways. You may find that
several mixes work equally well for your song. Allow yourself to experiment,
and don’t be afraid to record several different mixes.

Understanding Mixing
Think about all the time it took you to record all the tracks for your song. You
spent countless hours setting up mics; getting good, “hot” (high, but not dis-
torting) levels on your instruments; and making sure that each performance
was as good as you could get it. You would think that most of your work is
done. Well, on the one hand, it is — you no longer have to set up and play
each instrument. On the other hand, you still have to make all the parts that
you recorded fit together. This process can take as long as it took you to
record all the tracks in the first place.
Your main tool during the mixing process is the mixer. Figure 14-1 shows a
basic mixer setup in a software mixer program. The screen shot on the left
shows the main mixer menu — with faders for each of your tracks. The
screen shot on the right shows the channel strip section of the mixer. (For
details on how the mixer functions, check out Chapter 4.)
Mixing involves making sure that each instrument can be heard in the mix —
the recorded whole that’s the result of blending all your recorded parts —
without covering up something else or sounding out of place. You do this in
the following ways:
 Choose the recorded parts that add to the emotional impact of the
music and build intensity throughout the song. Also, don’t use parts that
are unnecessary or that clash with parts that have a greater impact.
 Set the levels (volume) of each of the instruments relative to one
another so that nothing is buried so far back in the mix that you 
can’t hear it and no instrument is so loud that it overpowers the other
instruments.

244
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Adjust the equalization (EQ — frequency response) of each instrument
so that each leaves room for the other instruments in the mix. This
means getting rid of any frequencies of an instrument that clash with
another or adding certain frequencies that define the sound of that
instrument so that it can be heard clearly in the mix.
 Take advantage of stereo panning to put each instrument in its proper
place in the stereo field — left or right — where it can either sound as
natural as possible or can produce an effect that you want. Also, stereo
panning allows you to make room for each instrument in the mix, espe-
cially those that have similar frequency ranges.
 Add effects, such as reverb or delay, to the instruments in the mix to
either place them in front or in back relative to other instruments or to
create a desired sound.
The mixing process is where you can get really creative in crafting your song.
The stress of capturing great performances is over — you now have to mas-
sage all the parts of your song into a cohesive whole. Don’t be afraid to try
new things. Experiment with different EQ, panning, and effect settings. Take
your time and have fun. The great thing about mixing is that you can make as
many versions as you want and you can always go back and try again.
Getting Started Mixing Your Song
Before I start to mix a song, I do a few things to prepare myself for the process.
My goal before I mix is to get in the headspace of mixing. This often means
taking a step back from the song and approaching it as a listener rather than
as the musician who recorded the tracks. Start the mixing process by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Determine the overall quality that you want from the song.
This can be defined as a musical style or a feeling. You probably don’t
need to think about this too hard because, when you started recording,
you probably had a definite sound in mind. In fact, most composers hear
a song in their heads before they even start recording.
2. Listen to a song or two from a CD that has a similar sound or feel as
the song you’re trying to mix.
Listen on your studio monitors if you can and try to get a sense of the
tonal and textural quality of these songs. Listen to them at fairly low
volume and be careful not to tire your ears. All you’re trying to do at this
point is to get your ears familiar with the sound that you’re trying to
produce in your music.
245
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

3. Set up a rough mix using no EQ or effects and listen through it once.
For this listening session, don’t think like a producer; rather, try to put
yourself in the mindset of the average listener. Listen to the various
parts that you’ve recorded and see whether anything sticks out as being
particularly good or bad. You’re not listening for production quality.
You’re trying to determine whether some instruments, musical phrases,
licks, melodies, or harmonies grab you as a listener.
4. Get a piece of paper and a pen to jot down ideas as you work.
As you listen to the song, take notes on where certain instruments should
be in the mix. For example, you may want the licks you played on the
lead guitar throughout the song to be muted during the first verse. Or
maybe you decide that the third rhythm-guitar part that you recorded
would be best put way to the right side of the mix while the other two
rhythm-guitar parts may be closer to the center. Write these ideas down
so that you can try them later. You’re likely to have a lot of ideas as you
listen through the first few times.
After you follow these steps, go through the song and adjust the EQ, panning,
and effect settings until you get all the instruments to fit nicely together. I
outline these procedures in the following sections.
Exploring Equalization
The most useful tool that you have for mixing is equalization (EQ). Equalizers
allow you to adjust the various frequencies of your instruments so that you
have enough room for each of them in your stereo tracks. Three types of
equalizers are used in a recording studio — graphic, shelf, and parametric. Each
has its strengths and weaknesses, which I outline in the following sections.
Graphic
The graphic EQ has a prescribed number of frequencies that you can adjust.
Graphic EQs generally have between 5 and 31 frequency bands, each affect-
ing a small range of frequencies. (The manufacturer determines the range,
which can’t be adjusted.) Graphic EQs are useful for eliminating an offending
frequency from the signal or for making other adjustments to the tonal qual-
ity of the source signal. You probably won’t use a graphic EQ much in the
mixing process because the parametric EQ can do what the graphic EQ can
do — and a whole lot more.
246
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Shelf
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above or below the target fre-
quency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the top or bottom end of the
frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a shelf EQ to roll off the fre-
quencies below 250 hertz (Hz) to reduce the amount of rumble (low-frequency
noise) in a recording. You generally use the shelf EQ for the lowest and high-
est frequencies and the parametric EQ for any in-between frequencies when
you mix.
Parametric
The parametric equalizer allows you to choose the frequency that you want
to change as well as the range of frequencies around that frequency. With a
parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency that you want to change and then
you set the range (referred to as the Q) you want to affect.
The Q is a number that signifies the number of octaves that the EQ affects.
Generally, you can adjust the Q setting to affect frequencies between 1⁄2 and 2
octaves wide. Not all parametric EQs use the same reference numbers for their
Q settings. Some have ranges from 0.7 (2 octaves) to 2.8 (1⁄2 octave), while
others use numbers from 0.5 to 16 without indicating what the numbers relate
to in terms of octaves. The one constant among parametric EQs is that lower
numbers affect larger ranges of frequencies than the higher numbers do.
The fact that each brand of parametric EQ uses slightly different numbers to
reference its Q settings shouldn’t matter much to you, because you choose
your Q setting based on what you hear in the mix. Just as you can experiment
with different frequencies to adjust in the mix, you can also try different Q
settings to find the best possible frequency range to use.
The beauty of a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band (range) of
frequencies and boost (increase) or cut (decrease) them. This capability
enables you to get the various instruments in a mix to fit in with one another
(called carving out frequencies). When you’re mixing, the parametric EQ is
the most useful one because you can adjust the frequency response of each
instrument so that the other instruments can be heard clearly in the mix. The
downside to parametric EQs is that some systems don’t offer you many
bands (sometimes just one with the addition of a couple of shelf EQs), so you
have to make your EQ decisions based on the type and number of EQs you
have to choose from.
247
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Equalizing Your Tracks
Only so many frequencies are available for all the instruments in a mix, and if
more than one instrument occupies a particular frequency range, they can
get in each other’s way and make the mix sound muddy. Your goals when
equalizing (EQing) during the mixing process are to reduce those frequencies
that add clutter and/or to enhance those that define an instrument’s sound.
To do this, make a little space for each instrument within the same general
frequency range. You do this by EQing the individual tracks as you mix. The
following sections explore this process in detail.
Dialing in EQ
Before you start EQing your tracks, you need to know how to find the fre-
quencies you intend to adjust and how to make those adjustments. Figure 14-2
shows an EQ plug-in for Logic Audio. Although each EQ will look a little differ-
ent, they all end up performing the same basic function. In this section, I walk
you through Logic’s Channel EQ.
Logic’s Channel EQ is an 8-band EQ with four parametric bands, one high-
shelf EQ, one low-shelf EQ, one high-pass filter, and one low-pass filter. As you
can see in Figure 14-2, the EQ types are listed at the top of the graph, but the
adjustments for these bands are located under the main graph.
Logic’s EQ has a really great feature where you can see the frequency response
of your track. This function is engaged by clicking the Analyzer button on the
left side of the plug-in window. This is handy because, with the Analyzer
Figure 14-2:

you to

248
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

button engaged, you can actually see the changes you’re making to your
track as you make them. This is also a potential problem because many
people rely on their eyes instead of their ears. Be careful not to let what you
see affect what you hear.
Using parametric EQ
To use the parametric EQ, click the Peak EQ button (it looks like a circle with
a line coming from the left and right sides) in the EQ plug-in window you have
open. You have three settings to adjust:
 Gain: This is the amount of boost (increase) or cut (decrease) that you
apply to the signal. In Pro Tools, you can either type in the amount in the
text box next to the Peak EQ button or use the slider to the right. In
Logic, to get your boost (gain) amount, either you can point your mouse
over the parameter and click and drag up or down, or you can click in
the EQ graph above the parameter controls and drag up or down.
 Freq: This frequency is the center of the EQ. You select the range of fre-
quencies above and below this point by using the Q setting (see next
bullet). In Pro Tools, you can either type the frequency in the text box on
the left or use the slider to make your adjustment. In Logic, to get the
desired frequency, either you can point your mouse over the parameter
and click and drag up or down, or you can click in the EQ graph above
the parameter controls and drag left or right.
 Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. In Pro Tools, you
adjust this setting either by moving the slider or by clicking in the text
box and typing a value between 0.33 and 12. In Logic, you can point your
mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down to get the Q
value you want. Your settings can be anywhere from 0.10 to 100.
Using low-shelf/high-shelf EQ
To use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, click the Low Shelf and High Shelf buttons in
the EQ plug-in window. These buttons look like sideways tuning forks located
second from the left and second from the right above the EQ graph in Figure
14-2. When you use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, you have two parameters to
adjust in Pro Tools and three on Logic:
 Gain: This is the amount of boost or cut that you apply to the signal. In
Pro Tools, you can either type in the amount in the text box next to the
shelf button or use the slider to the right. In Logic, to set the boost
(gain), either you can point your mouse over the parameter and click
and drag up or down, or you can click in the EQ graph above the para-
meter controls and drag up or down.
 Freq: This is the starting frequency for the shelf. In Pro Tools, you can
either type in the frequency in the text box or use the slider to make
249
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

your adjustment. In Logic, to set your desired frequency you can either
point your mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down or
you can click in the EQ graph above the parameter controls and drag left
or right.
 Q: This is the steepness of the shelf of your EQ in Logic. (Pro Tools 
doesn’t have this option.) The higher the number, the steeper the shelf
that’s applied — meaning that the range of frequencies that are affected to
get the gain change of the shelf is narrower. To adjust this parameter, you
can point your mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down
to get the Q value you want. Your settings can be anywhere from .10 to 2.
Using low-pass/high-pass EQ
Here’s where you tell your plug-in which frequencies to avoid in the course of
adjusting the EQ. The low- and high-pass buttons are located at the far left
and far right above the EQ graph in Figure 14-2.
To use the low- or high-pass filter, click the appropriate button in the EQ
window. In Pro Tools, the only option to set is Freq, which is the frequency
that the filter begins filtering. Any frequency below (high-pass) or above (low-
pass) the setting is removed from the track. You can either type the fre-
quency in the text box or use the slider to make your adjustment.
In Logic, you have the same three settings — frequency, gain/slope, and Q — as
the rest of the EQ types. And as with the other EQ types, you adjust the set-
tings by pointing your mouse over the column of the setting and clicking and
dragging the parameter that you want to adjust. With the high-pass and low-
pass EQ (filters), the gain/slope parameter adjusts the slope of the filter —
how quickly it totally cuts off the frequency.
Deciding which frequencies to boost or cut
Here’s a good trick to use when initially trying to decide which frequencies to
boost or cut:
1. Solo the track(s) you’re working on by clicking the Solo button in the
track’s channel strip and set your parametric EQ to a narrow Q setting
(a high number).
2. Next, turn the boost all the way up (turn the EQ knob all the way to
the right) and sweep the frequency setting as you listen (to sweep, just
dial the EQ knob’s frequency dial to the left and right).
3. Notice those areas where the annoying or pleasing sounds are located.
This can help you better understand the frequencies that your instru-
ment produces.
4. After you find a frequency to adjust, experiment with the Q setting to
find the range that produces the best sound and then adjust the
amount of boost or cut to where it has the effect that you want.
250
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

After you determine the frequencies that you want to work with, do your
EQing to the individual track while the instrument is in the mix (not soloed).
You’re trying to make that instrument fit as well as possible with the rest of
the instruments, and to do this, you need to know how your instrument
sounds in relation to all the stuff (music) going on around it.
When making adjustments in EQ, your goal is to make all the tracks blend 
as well as possible. In some instances, this means making some radical EQ
moves. Don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to make your mix sound good,
even if this means having cuts or boosts as great as 12dB.
General guidelines
Although some instruments call for specific EQ guidelines, you should con-
sider some general issues when EQing, regardless of the instrument involved.
When it comes to the audible frequency spectrum (which is generally about
20 Hz to 20 kHz), certain frequencies always have certain characteristics.
Table 14-1 describes these frequencies.
Table 14-1

You’re generally better off cutting a frequency than boosting one. This think-
ing goes back to the early days of analog EQs, which often added noise when
boosting a signal. This can still be a factor with some digital EQs, but it is much
less of an issue. I still try to cut frequencies before I boost them just out of
habit, and I recommend that you do the same (not out of habit, of course, but
because if a noise difference exists between cutting and boosting, you may as
well avoid it).
251
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

The exact frequencies that you end up cutting or boosting depend on the
sound you’re after, the tonal characteristic of the instrument, and the rela-
tionship between all the instruments in the song. In the following sections, I
list a variety of frequencies to cut or boost for each instrument; Table 14-2
shows an overview. You may not want to follow all the suggestions. Just
choose the ones that help you meet your goals.

Vocals
For most popular music, the vocals are the most important instrument in the
song. You need to hear them clearly, and they should contain the character of
the singer’s voice and style. One of the most common mistakes in mixing
vocals is to make them too loud. The next most common mistake is to make
them too quiet. (This is especially true if you’re the singer and are even slightly
self-conscious of your vocals skills.) You want the lead vocals to shine through,
but you don’t want them to overpower the other instruments. The best way
to do this is to EQ the vocal tracks so that they can sit nicely in the mix and
still be heard clearly. The following guidelines can help you do this.
Lead
You can use several techniques with the lead vocal, depending on the singer
and the style of music. For the most part, I tend to cut a little around 200 Hz
and add a couple dB at 3 kHz and again at 10 kHz. In general, try following
these guidelines:
 To add fullness, try adding a few dB at 150 Hz.
 To get rid of muddiness, cut a few dB at 200–250 Hz.
 To add clarity, boost a little at 3 kHz.
 For more presence, add at 5 kHz.
 To add air or to brighten, boost at 10 kHz.
 To get rid of sibilance, cut a little between 7.5 and 10 kHz.
Backup
To keep backup vocals from competing with lead vocals, cut the backup
vocals a little in the low end (below 250 Hz) and at the 2.5–3.5-kHz range. 
To add clarity, you can boost a little around 10 kHz without getting in the 
way of the lead vocal.
254
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Guitar
For the most part, when it comes to guitars, you want to avoid getting a
muddy sound, and you want to make sure that the attack comes through 
in the mix.
Electric
Electric guitars can often use a little cutting below 100 Hz to get rid of muddi-
ness. A boost between 120 and 250 Hz adds warmth. A boost in the 2.5–4-kHz
range brings out the attack of the guitar, and a boost at 5 kHz can add some
bite to the guitar.
Acoustic
Acoustic guitars often do well with a little cut below 80 Hz and again around
800 Hz to 1 kHz. If you want a warmer tone and more body, you can try boost-
ing a little at 150–250 Hz. Also try adding a few dB around 3–5 kHz if you want
more attack or punch. A few dB added at 7 kHz can add a little more bright-
ness to the instrument.
Bass
This instrument can get muddy pretty fast. The mud generally happens in the
200–300-Hz range, so I either leave that alone or cut just a little if the bass
lacks definition. I rarely add frequencies below 100 Hz but boost some
between 100 and 200 Hz if the instrument sounds flat or thin. Adding a little
between 500 Hz and 1 kHz can increase the punch, and a boost between 2.5
and 5 kHz accentuates the attack, adding a little brightness to the bass.
With the bass guitar, one of the most important things is to make sure that it
and the kick drum can both be heard. You need to adjust the frequencies of
these two instruments to make room for both. For the most part, try cutting
frequencies from the bass that you may add to the kick.
Drums
The guidelines for EQing the drums depend on whether you use live acoustic
drums or a drum machine. (The drum machine probably requires less EQ
because the sounds were already EQed when they were created.) Also, the
type and placement of your mic or mics also affect how you EQ the drums.
(You can find out more about mic placement in Chapters 8 and 9.)
255
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Kick
You want the kick drum to blend in with the bass guitar. To do this, reduce
the frequencies that the bass guitar takes up. For example, if I boost a few dB
between 100 and 200 Hz for the bass guitar, I generally cut them in the kick
drum (and maybe as high as 250 Hz). To bring out the bottom end of the kick,
I sometimes add a couple of dB between 80 and 100 Hz. The kick drum can get
boxy sounding (you know, like a cardboard box), so I often cut a little between
400 and 600 Hz as well to get rid of this boxiness. To bring out the click from
the beater hitting the head, try adding a little between 2.5 and 5 kHz. This
increases the attack of the drum and gives it more presence.
Snare
The snare drum drives the music, making it the most important drum in pop-
ular music. As such, it needs to really cut through the rest of the instruments.
Although the adjustments that you make depend on the pitch and size of the
drum and whether you used one mic or two during recording, you can usu-
ally boost a little at 100–150 Hz for added warmth. You can also try boosting
at 250 Hz to add some depth and cutting at 800 Hz to 1 kHz if the drum
sounds too boxy. A little boost at around 3 to 5 kHz increases the attack, and
an increase in the 8–10-kHz range can add a crispness to the drum.
If you used two mics during recording, consider dropping a few dB on the top
mic in both the 800-Hz to 1-kHz range and the 8- to 10-kHz range. Allow the
bottom mic to create the crispness. I generally roll off the bottom end of the
bottom mic below, say, 250 to 300 Hz. Depending on the music (R&B and pop,
for instance), I may add a little sizzle to the bottom mic by boosting frequen-
cies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ.
For many recording engineers/producers, the snare drum sound is almost a
signature. If you listen to different artists’ songs from the same producer,
you’ll likely hear similarities in the songs’ snare drum sound. Don’t be afraid
to take your time getting the snare drum to sound just right. After all, if you
become a famous producer, you’ll want people to recognize your snare drum
sound too.
Tom-toms
Tom-toms come in a large range of sizes and pitches, but for mounted toms,
you can boost a little around 200 to 250 Hz to add depth to the drum. A boost
in the 3–5-kHz range can add more of the sticks’ attack, and for some addi-
tional presence, try adding a little in the 5–8-kHz range. If the drums sound
too boxy, try cutting a little in the 600-Hz to 1-kHz range.
For floor toms, you can try boosting the frequency range 40 to 125 Hz to add
some richness and fullness. You may also find that cutting 400–800 Hz can get
rid of any boxy sound that the drum may have. To add more attack, boost the
2.5- to 5-kHz range.
256
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Hi-hats
Most of the time, the hi-hats are pretty well represented in the rest of the
mics in the drum set, but depending on which mics are picking up the hi-hats,
you can use the hi-hat mic to bring out their sheen or brightness. To do this,
try boosting the frequencies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ. You may also find
that cutting frequencies below 200 Hz eliminates any rumble created by other
drums that the hi-hat mic picked up.
Cymbals
With the cymbals, I usually cut anything below 150–200 Hz with a shelf EQ to
get rid of rumbling that these mics may pick up. I also drop a few dB at 1–2 kHz
if the cymbals sound kind of trashy or clanky. Adding a shelf EQ above 10 kHz
can add a nice sheen to the mix.
Overhead mics
If you used overhead mics to pick up both the drums and the cymbals, be
careful about cutting too much low end — this can just suck the life out of
your drums. Also, if the drums coming through the overhead mics sound
boxy or muddy, work with the 100–200-Hz frequencies for the muddiness and
400-Hz to 1-kHz frequencies for the boxiness.
Percussion
High-pitched percussion instruments, such as shakers, sound good when the
higher frequencies are boosted a little bit — over 10 kHz, for instance. This
adds some brightness and softness to their sound. You can also roll off many
of the lower frequencies, below 500 Hz, to eliminate any boxiness that may be
present from miking too closely (see Chapter 8 for more on mic placement).
Lower-pitched percussion instruments, such as maracas, can also have the
lower frequencies cut a little — use 250 Hz and lower. Try boosting frequen-
cies between 2.5 and 5 kHz to add more of the instrument’s attack. To brighten
them up, add a little bit in the 8–10-kHz range.
Piano
For pianos, you often want to make sure that the instrument has a nice attack
as well as a warm-bodied tone. You can add attack in the 2.5–5-kHz range, and
warmth can be added in the 80–150-Hz range. If your piano sounds boomy or
muddy, try cutting a little between 200 and 400 Hz.
257
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Horns
You find a variety of horns, from tubas to soprano saxophones, so to offer
blanket recommendations for all of them would be ridiculous (although I’m
no stranger to ridiculous). So with this thought in mind, I often start the EQ
process for these instruments by looking at the 100–200-Hz range to add
warmth to thin-sounding instruments. Next, I approach the 400–800-Hz range
to get rid of any muddiness that occurs unless it’s a really low horn like a
tuba. In this case, I often look for the muddiness a little lower — say, in the
200–400-Hz range. To add some more attack to a horn, you can tweak the
2.5–5-kHz range a bit, and to add some of the breath of the instrument, look
toward the 7–9-kHz range.
Using the Stereo Field
When you’re at a live concert and you close your eyes, you can hear where
each instrument is coming from on-stage. You can hear that certain instru-
ments are on the left side of the stage, others are on the right, and still others
seem to come from the center. You can also generally discern whether an
instrument is at the front or the back of the stage. Put all these sounds
together, and you have a stereo field.
The stereo field consists of placement from left to right and front to back.
When you mix a song, you can set your instruments wherever you want them
on the “stage” that’s created by your listeners’ speakers. You can do this with
panning, which sets your instruments from left to right, and you can use
effects, such as reverb and delay, to place your instruments from front to
back in your mix. When you mix your song, try to visualize where on-stage
each instrument may be placed.
Some people choose to set the panning and depth of their instruments to
sound as natural as possible, while others use these settings to create other-
worldly sounds. There is no right or wrong setting when panning and adding
effects to simulate depth — just what works for your goals. Don’t be afraid to
get creative and try unusual things.
Left or right
You adjust each instrument’s position from left to right in a mix with the pan-
ning knob. The panning knob is generally located just above each channel’s
fader. This can either be a knob that you turn left or right or a slider that you
move to the left or right. Panning for most songs is pretty straightforward,
and I outline some settings in the following list:
258
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Lead vocals: Lead vocals are usually panned directly in the center.
 Backup vocals: Because backup vocals are often recorded in stereo,
they are panned hard left and hard right. If you recorded only one track
of backup vocals, you can make a duplicate of the track and pan one to
each side, just as you can with stereo tracks.
In addition to tracks panned to each side, some mixing engineers also
have a third backup vocal track that’s panned in the center to add more
depth. Your choice of doing this depends on how you recorded your
backup vocals and how many tracks you have available for them.
 Guitar: Lead guitar is often panned to the center (or just slightly off-
center if the sound in the center of the stereo field is too cluttered).
Rhythm guitar, on the other hand, is generally placed somewhere just
off-center. It doesn’t matter which side you place it, but it’s usually the
opposite side from other background instruments, such as an additional
rhythm guitar, synthesizers, organs, or pianos.
 Bass: Most of the time, the bass guitar is panned in the center, but it’s
not uncommon for mixing engineers to create a second track for the
bass and pan one to the far left and the other to the far right. This gives
the bass a sense of spaciousness and allows more room for both the
bass guitar and kick drum in the mix.
 Drums: As a general rule, I (and most other people) pan the drums so
that they appear in the stereo field much like they would on-stage (but
this doesn’t mean you have to, too). The snare drum and kick drum are
typically panned right up the center, and the tom-toms are panned from
right to left slightly. Hi-hat cymbals often go just to the right of center,
the ride cymbal just left of center, and crash cymbals sit from left to
right, much like the tom-toms.
 Percussion: Percussion instruments tend to be panned just off to the left
or right of center. If I have a shaker or triangle part that plays through-
out the song, for instance, I pan it to the right an equal distance from
center as the hi-hat is to the left. This way, you hear the hi-hat and per-
cussion parts playing off one another in the mix.
 Piano/synthesizers/organs: These instruments are usually placed just
off-center. If your song has rhythm guitar parts, the piano or organ usu-
ally goes to the opposite side. Synthesizers can be panned all over the
place. In fact, it’s not uncommon for the synths to be actively panned
throughout the song (that is, they move from place to place).
Some mixing engineers like to keep their instruments toward the center of
the mix, while other engineers prefer spreading things way out with instru-
ments on either end of the spectrum. There’s no right or wrong way to pan
instruments. In fact, no one says that you have to leave any of your instru-
ments in the same place throughout the entire song.
259
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Front or back
As you probably discovered when you were placing your mics to record an
instrument, the quality of sound changes when you place a mic closer to or
farther away from the instrument. The closer you place a mic to the instru-
ment, the less room ambience you pick up, thus making the instrument
sound close to you, or “in your face.” In contrast, the farther from the instru-
ment you place your mic, the more room sound you hear. As a result, your
instrument sounds far away.
If you’ve ever stood in a large room and talked to someone, you have seen
(well, heard, actually) how this relationship works. When your friend stands
close to you, you can hear him clearly. You hear very little of the reflections
of his voice from around the room. As he moves farther away from you, the
room’s reflections play an increasing role in the way that you hear him. By
the time your friend is at the other side of the room, you hear not only his
voice but also the room in which you are talking with him. In fact, if the room
is large enough, your friend probably sounds as if he were a mile away from
you, and all the reflections from his voice bouncing around the room may
make it difficult to understand what he says.
You can easily simulate this effect by using your reverb or delay effects proces-
sors. In fact, this is often the purpose of reverb and delay in the mixing
process. With them, you can effectively place your instruments almost any-
where that you want them, from front to back, in your mix.
The less reverb or delay that you use in conjunction with your instrument,
the closer it appears on the recording, whereas the more effect you add to an
instrument, the farther away it seems from you.
The type of reverb or delay setting that you use has an impact on how close
or far away a sound appears as well. For example, a longer reverb decay or
delay sounds farther away than a shorter one. In Chapter 15, I go into detail
about the various effects processors to help you understand how best to use
them. I also present settings that you can use to create natural-sounding
reverb and delay on your tracks, as well as some unusual settings that you
can use for special effects.
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing 
the Emotion of the Song
After you have a rough mix and have your EQ and panning settings where you
want them, your next step is to determine which parts of which tracks are
260
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

used when — and sometimes, whether a part or track is used at all. If you’re
like most musician/producers, you try to get all the wonderful instrumental
and vocal parts you recorded as loud as possible in the mix so that each can
be heard clearly all the time. After all, you didn’t go through all the time and
effort to record all those great tracks just to hide them in the mix — or worse
yet, mute them — right?
Well, I feel your pain. But when you get to the mixing point of a song, it’s time
to take off your musician’s hat and put on the one that says producer. A pro-
ducer’s job is to weed through all the parts of a song, choose those that add
to its impact, and dump those that are superfluous or just add clutter. Your
goal is to assemble the tracks that tell the story that you want to tell and that
carry the greatest emotional impact for the listener.
This can be the toughest part of mixing your own songs because you aren’t
likely to be totally objective when it comes to determining what to use. Try
not to get stressed out. You aren’t erasing any of your tracks, so you can
always do another mix later if you just have to hear the part that you muted
before.
One of the great joys when listening to music (for me, anyway) is hearing a
song that carries me away and pulls me into the emotional journey that the
songwriter had in mind. If the song is done well, I’m sucked right into the
song, and by the end, all I want to do is rewind it and listen to it again.
What is it about certain songs that can draw you in and get you to feel the
emotion of the performers? Well, aside from a good melody and some great
performances, it’s the way that the arrangement builds throughout the song
to create tension, release that tension, and build it again. A good song builds
intensity so that the listener feels pulled into the emotions of the song.
Generally, a song starts out quietly, becomes a little louder during the first
chorus, and then drops in level for the second verse (not as quiet as the first,
though). The second chorus is often louder and fuller than the first chorus,
and is often followed by a bridge section that is even fuller yet (or at least dif-
ferent in arrangement than the second chorus). The loud bridge section may
be followed by a third verse, where the volume drops a little. Then a super-
heated chorus generally follows the last verse and keeps building intensity
until the song ends.
You have two tools at your disposal when crafting your song to build and
release intensity. They are dynamics and instrumental content (the 
arrangement).
261
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Dynamics
Dynamics are simply how loud or soft something is. Listen to a classic blues
tune (or even some classical music), and you can hear sections where the
song is almost deafeningly silent and other sections where you think the
band is going to step out of the speakers and into your room. This is an effec-
tive and powerful use of dynamics. The problem is that this seems to be a
lost art, at least in popular music.
It used to be that a song could have very quiet parts and really loud ones.
Unfortunately, a lot of modern CDs have only one level — loud. This often
isn’t the fault of the musicians or even the band’s producer. The radio sta-
tions and record-company bean counters have fueled this trend because they
want to make sure that a band’s music is as loud as (or louder than) other
CDs on the market. (You can read more about this trend in Chapter 16.)
Try recording a song with a lot of dynamic changes. I know this bucks the
trend, but who knows, you may end up with a song that carries a ton of emo-
tional impact. Also, as you mix your song, incorporate dynamic variation by
dropping the levels of background instruments during the verses and bring-
ing them up during the chorus and bridge sections of the song. You can
always eliminate your dynamic variation by squashing your mix with com-
pression during the mastering process.
The biggest mistake that most people make when they mix their own music is
to try to get their song to be as loud as commercial CDs. This is the mastering
engineer’s job, however, not yours, so don’t worry about it. Get your song to
sound good with a balance between high and low frequencies and loud and
soft sections. Let the mastering engineer make your music as loud as it can
be. He or she definitely has gear that is better designed to raise the volume 
of a recording without making it sound squashed or harsh.
The arrangement
Building intensity with the arrangement involves varying the amount of
sound in each section. A verse with just lead vocal, drums, bass, and an
instrument playing the basic chords of the song is going to have less inten-
sity (not to mention volume) than a chorus with a wash of guitars, backup
vocals, drums, percussion, organ, and so on. Most songs that build intensity
effectively start with fewer instruments than they end with.
When you mix your song, think about how you can use the instruments to
add to the emotional content of your lyrics. For example, if you have a guitar
262
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

lick that you played at every break in the vocal line, think about using it less
to leave space for lower levels at certain points in your song. If you do this,
each lick can provide more impact for the listener and bring more to the
song’s emotion.
Automation, or Riding the Faders
When you have the levels of each instrument set so that you can hear each of
them when the song plays, you would think that you can pretty much leave
the levels that way during the whole song. Well, you can, but that often limits
the amount of dynamics that you get in your mix.
Rarely do you set the levels of each instrument at the beginning of the song
and not move the various instrument levels up and down throughout the
song. For example, you may find that you want the rhythm guitar parts
louder during the chorus, or maybe you have a short guitar lick in the second
verse that you want to bring up a little in the mix.
To adjust levels during the song, you used to need several hands (or at least
one more person to help), and you jumped from one fader to another and
constantly made changes to the effect settings while you recorded the final
mix. One mistake and you had to start recording over again. This is no longer
the case for most digital recorders because most of them have an automix
feature. Automix enables you to record the fader moves and effects changes
that happen throughout the mix so that you don’t have to actually move the
faders when you record to two tracks.
Depending on your system, you have one of two types of automation features
(or both): real-time automation and scene or snapshot automation.
Real-time automation
Real-time automation is also referred to as dynamic automated mixing. This
feature allows you to record the fader, panning, effects settings, and other
things in real time to each track as the song plays. The advantage of this type
of automation is that you can seamlessly get volume changes, and you can
record these changes while the song plays. The disadvantage of real-time
automation is that it takes you a while to do, especially if you have a lot of
tracks to automate. Real-time automation can also take up a lot of hard-drive
space and can tax your processor if you have a complicated mix with lots of
tracks, effects, and mixer-setting changes.
263
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

Snapshot automation
Snapshot automation involves saving the mixer data at intervals rather than
throughout the entire song. To do snapshot automation, just set your mixer
(levels, EQ, effects, and so on) the way you want it for a particular section in
your song (the verse, for instance) and take a “snapshot” of it. Whenever you
make a mixer move, you take another snapshot, and so on. Snapshot automa-
tion can be useful if you have a song without a ton of complex mixer changes.
The advantage of snapshot automation is that it takes up a lot less hard-drive
space and requires less processor power. The disadvantage is that it can take
much longer to automate the song (you have to program each instance into
the mixer), and any complex mixer moves, such as fade-ins and fade-outs,
may not sound as smooth.
If you’re going to mix your music and have more than eight tracks, get a
system that enables you to do automated mixing (I say eight tracks because,
for the most part, you can handle mixing up to eight tracks the old-fashioned
way). Research the automation features of the system that interests you
before you buy it. For example, a given system may offer real-time automa-
tion, but it may tax the system’s processor and add to your song’s file size so
quickly that using it becomes more hassle than it’s worth. Likewise, some
systems (the Roland VS-1680, for example) don’t allow you to change the
effects patch during automation. The more you know about your mixing
needs, the better you can tell what automation approach will work for you.
Tuning Your Ears
To create a mix that sounds good, the most critical tools you need are your
ears, because your ability to hear the music clearly and accurately is essen-
tial. To maximize this ability, you need a decent set of studio monitors and a
good idea of how other people’s music sounds on your speakers. You also
need to make sure that you don’t mix when your ears are tired. The following
sections explore these areas.
Listening critically
One of the best ways to find out how to mix music is to listen to music that
you like and listen for the way that it’s mixed. Put on a CD of something simi-
lar to your music (or music that has a sound that you like) and ask yourself
the following questions:
264
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 What is the overall tonal quality or texture of the song? Notice how
the frequencies of all the instruments cover the hearing spectrum. Does
the song sound smooth or harsh, full or thin? Try to determine what you
like about the overall production.
 How does the song’s arrangement contribute to its overall feel? Listen
for licks or phrases that add to the arrangement. Notice whether the
song seems to get fuller as it goes on.
 Where are the instruments in the stereo field? Notice where each
instrument is, from left to right and front to back, in the mix. Listen to
see whether the instruments stay in one place throughout the song or
whether they move around.
 What effects are being used on each instrument? Listen for reverb 
and delay lengths as well as the effect level compared to the dry (unaf-
fected) signal.
 What tonal quality does each instrument have? Try to determine the
frequencies from each instrument that seem dominant. Pay particular
attention to the way the drums sound, especially the snare drum.
Even if you’re not mixing one of your songs, it’s a good idea to occasionally
sit down and listen to music on your monitors to get used to listening to
music critically. Also, the more good music you hear on your monitors, the
easier it is for you to know when your music sounds good on them, too.
A good mix should sound good on a variety of systems, not just through the
speakers in your studio. Before you decide that a mix is done, copy it to a CD
and play it in your car, your friend’s stereo, and a boom box. In fact, try to
listen to your music on as many different kinds of systems as you can. As you
listen, notice whether the bass disappears or becomes too loud or whether
the treble becomes thin or harsh. Basically, you’re trying to determine where
you need to make adjustments in your mix so that it sounds good everywhere.
Unless you spent a lot of time and money getting your mixing room to sound
great, you have to compensate when you mix to get your music to sound
good on other people’s systems. If your room or speakers enhance the bass
in your song, the song will sound thin on other people’s systems. On the
other hand, if your system lacks bass, your mixes will be boomy when you
listen to them somewhere else.
Choosing reference CDs
A reference CD can be any music that you like or that helps you to hear your
music more clearly. For the most part, choose reference CDs that have a good
265
Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music

balance between high and low frequencies and that sound good to your ear.
That said, some CDs are mixed really well, which can help you get to know
your monitors and train your ears to hear the subtleties of a mix. I name a
few CDs in the following list. (Disclaimer: I try to cover a variety of music
styles in this list, but I can’t cover them all without a list that’s pages long.)
 Steely Dan, Two Against Nature
 Peter Gabriel, So
 Sarah McLachlan, Surfacing
 No Doubt, Return of Saturn
 Los Lobos, Kiko
 Marilyn Manson, Mechanical Animals
 Depeche Mode, Ultra
 Bonnie Raitt, Fundamental
 Macy Gray, Oh How Life Is
 Pearl Jam, Yield
 Metallica, S&M
 Dr. Dre, 2001
All commercial CDs have been mastered. This is going to affect the sound of
them a little — most importantly, they will be louder than your music. If you
toggle back and forth between your mix and a reference CD, adjust the rela-
tive levels so that each sounds equally as loud coming through your speakers
because the louder song always sounds “better.” And remember: Don’t try to
match the volume of your mix to a reference CD.
Dealing with ear fatigue
If you’ve ever had a chance to mix a song, you’ve probably found that you
often do a better mix early in the process, and the longer you work on the
song, the worse the mix gets. In most cases, this is because your ears get
tired, and when they do, hearing accurately becomes harder. To tame ear
fatigue, try the following tips:
 Don’t mix at the end of the day, especially after doing other record-
ing. Save your mixing for first thing in the morning, when your ears have
had a chance to rest.
 Keep the volume low. I know you’ll be tempted to crank the volume on
your song as you work on it, but doing so only tires your ears prema-
turely and can cause damage, especially if you have monitors that can
get really loud.

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Take an occasional break. Just 10 or 15 minutes of silence can allow
you to work for another hour or so. Also, don’t be afraid to walk away
from a mix for a day or more.
 Try not to mix under a deadline. This suggestion fits with the preced-
ing one. If you’re under a deadline, you can’t give yourself the time you
may need to rest and reassess your mix before it goes to print.
Making several versions
One great thing about digital recording is that it costs you nothing to make
several versions of a mix. All you need is a little (or a lot of) hard-drive space.
Because you can make as many variations on your song’s mix as your hard
drive allows, you can really experiment by trying new effects settings or
trying active panning in your song. You may end up with something exciting.
At the very least, you end up discovering more about your gear. That’s
always a good thing.
Print (record) a mix early on. Most of the time, your best mixes happen early
in the mixing process. Print (or save) the first good mix that you make before
you try making creative ones. This way, if you get burned out or run out of
time, you have a decent mix to fall back on.

 Exploring signal processing
U
nless you record your songs using a live band in a perfect acoustic
environment, your music will sound a little flat without the addition of
some type of effects. Effects allow you to make your music sound like you
recorded it in just about any environment possible. You can make your
drums sound as if they were recorded in a cathedral or your vocals sound as
if you were singing underwater. Effects also have the ability to make you
sound better than you actually did. For example, you can add harmony parts
to your lead or backup vocals, or you can make your guitar sound like you
played it through a number of great amplifiers.
In this chapter, you discover many of the most common signal processors
used in recording studios. (Signal processors are the neat hardware behind all
the effects you can achieve in a recording studio.) You discern the difference
between insert (line) and send/return effects, dynamics processors, and
effects processors. You also get a chance to explore ways of using these
processors, with recommendations for using reverb, delay, chorus, pitch
shifting, compression, noise gates, and expanders.
All effects have presets. Presets are factory settings that enable you to dive
right into using the effects processor without having to know how each para-
meter works. Presets are a good place to start when you’re not really sure
how to get the sound that you want. Most presets are named, and the name
may give you a hint about where you may use it. For example, a reverb with a
preset called vocal plate lets you know that it may be worth trying on vocals.
After you choose a preset, don’t be afraid to tweak it a little to get the sound
you’re after. Most decent effects processors allow you to save any changes
that you make to the preset.
The best way to discover how to use effects on your music is to experiment.
The more you play around with the different settings, the more familiar you’ll
become with how each effect operates. Then you can get creative and come
up with the best ways of using effects for your music.

The Bypass button on your effects processor is your friend. With a press of
this button, you can quickly turn off the effect to your signal. Use it to check
your effect settings against your original signal. Sometimes you’ll like the
original sound better.
Connecting Effects
For an effects processor to work on your sound source, you need to connect
the processor properly. Regardless of the type of signal processor or recording
system you’re using, you have the option of connecting your processor directly
into the channel strip (called a line or insert effect) or routing it through your
aux bus (a send/return effect).
Insert
Insert (line) effects are placed in the signal path so that all the instrument’s
sound passes through the effect, as shown in Figure 15-1. Line effects alter
the entire signal of the instrument and don’t allow you to mix the amount of
effect that you have with the original dry (unaffected) signal at the mixer.
(Some insert effects allow you to adjust the balance of dry and affected signal
using a Mix dial.) Line effects are generally dynamics processors like com-
pression or gates, which are great for evening out signal levels and getting rid
of noise on your tracks, but they can also be the useful new effects, such as
amp or microphone simulators, that are available to the home recordist.

Send/return
Send/return effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, and flange, allow you to
mix both the affected and unaffected sound separately. The send/return
effect is connected to the aux bus in your mixer (through the aux jack), as
shown in Figure 15-2, and as a result, you can adjust both the dry signal and
the affected signal separately. This enables you to do the following things
that you can’t do with a line effect:
 Run as many instruments through the same processor as you want. For
example, you can have your snare drum, kick drum, bass guitar, and
backup vocals all run through the same reverb.
 Have as much or as little of the affected sound in your music as you
want. This can be an advantage if you want just a little reverb on your
vocal track, for instance.
 Pan the dry signal to one side of the mix and the affected signal to the
other side. This can add depth to an instrument and can be used for a
variety of cool effects.
Dynamics Processors
Dynamics processors allow you to control the dynamic range of a signal. The
dynamic range is the difference between the softest and loudest signals that a
sound source produces. This range is listed in decibels (dB). The larger the
dynamic range, the more variation between the softest and loudest notes.

Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

The three types of dynamics processors are compressor/limiters, gates, and
expanders. The following sections give you the lowdown on each item, but
suffice it to say that, with the help of dynamics processors, you can do a
number of important things to your music. You can add punch or smooth out
an instrument’s sound, you can eliminate noise from a track, or you can even
out an erratic performance.
Figure 15-3 shows the dynamics processors section of a popular computer-
based recording program. Although each dynamics process works a little dif-
ferently, they all use some of the same controls. In this figure, you use the
sliders in the middle of the window to control the different parameters for
the processor. The upper section’s level meters show you how much process-
ing of the dynamic range that you’re doing.
Introducing compressors/limiters
The compressor’s job is to compress the dynamic range of the sound being
affected. The compressor not only limits how loud a note can be, but it also
reduces the difference between the loudest and softest notes (it compresses
the dynamic range).
The limiter works much like the compressor except it limits the highest level
of a sound source. Any signal above the threshold is chopped off rather than
compressed, as with the compressor.
Compressor/limiters are used for the following three main purposes
(although other purposes certainly exist as well):

272
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 To keep transients from creating digital distortion during tracking:
This is common with drums that have a very fast attack (initial signal)
that can easily overload the recorder (or converters or preamps).
 To even out a performance that shows a high degree of unwanted
dynamic variation: You do this during either the mixing or tracking
stage. An example is a singer who has poor mic control (moves con-
stantly in front of the mic), and as a result, some recorded passages
become loud while others are very quiet.
 To raise the overall apparent level of the music during mastering: For
example, listen to a CD recorded ten years ago and one from the last
year or so, and you’ll notice that the newer CD sounds louder than the
older one.
I cover purpose 1 in Chapter 7, and I explore purpose 3 in Chapter 16. So that
leaves purpose 2 to explore with sample settings later in this chapter.
In Chapter 7, I explain the purpose of the various parameters of a compres-
sor, but to keep you from having to flip through the book to find that informa-
tion, I present those parameters here as well:
 Threshold: The threshold setting dictates the level that the compressor
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in dB (decibels). This setting is
often listed as dB below peak (0dB). In other words, a setting of –6dB
means that the compressor starts to act when the signal is 6 decibels
below its calibrated 0dB mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest
level a signal can go before clipping.)
 Ratio: The ratio is the amount that the compressor affects the signal.
The ratio, such as 2:1 for instance, means that for every decibel that the
signal goes over the threshold setting, the signal is reduced by a factor
of 2. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor is only 1⁄2dB louder. With ratios above 10:1,
your compressor starts to act like a limiter.
 Attack: The attack knob controls how soon the compressor kicks in. 
The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and the lower the number,
the faster the attack.
 Release: The release parameter controls how long the compressor con-
tinues affecting the signal after it has dropped back below the threshold
setting. Like the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds. The lower
the number, the faster the release time.
 Gain: The gain knob allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the signal
going out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels. Because adding
compression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use
this control to raise the level back to where it was going in.
273
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

 Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of
choosing between a hard knee and a soft knee (or they do it for you
based on the setting that you’ve chosen). Hard knee and soft knee refer
to how the compressor behaves as the input signal passes the thresh-
old. They are defined as follows:
• Hard knee applies the compression at an even rate regardless of
the level present over the threshold. So if you choose a compres-
sion setting of 4:1, the compressor applies this ratio for any signal
over the threshold limit. Hard knee compression is used for instru-
ments like drums, where you need to clamp down on any tran-
sients quickly.
• Soft knee, by contrast, applies the compression at a varying rate,
depending on the amount the signal is over the threshold setting.
A soft knee setting gradually increases the ratio of the compres-
sion as the signal crosses the threshold until it hits the level that
you set. Soft knee compression is used on vocals and other instru-
ments where the signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Some two-channel compressors have a link function that allows you to connect
the two separate channels and control them from one set of controls. Having
the two channels linked ensures that you end up with the same settings on
both channels. This is useful when you want to compress a stereo signal.
Some compressors have a sidechain jack located on the back panel. This jack
allows you to insert an equalizer into the signal path of the compressor (you
use a Y cord). The sidechain option is used to “de-ess” vocals (get rid of the
nasty s sounds of sibilance).
Multiband compression
Multiband compressors allow you to designate the frequency range that you
want to compress. Most multiband compressors have three or four bands.
The four-band versions have low, low-mid, high-mid, and high band versions.
The three-band versions have low, mid, and high band versions. You often get
to choose where your frequency ranges are.
Multiband compressors are used most often during the mastering process,
but they can be handy on individual tracks as well. The main advantage of
these types of compressors is that you can compress a specific frequency
range without affecting the sound of the rest of the track. This can be helpful
if you have an instrument that’s either buried or is overpowering a mix. You
just add a little (or a lot) of compression to the bass, for example, to bring it
up in the mix, without affecting the higher-frequency instruments.
274
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Getting started using compression
The compressor is one of the most useful — and one of the most abused —
pieces of gear in the recording studio. The most difficult part of using com-
pression is that every instrument reacts differently to the same settings. So,
instead of presenting specific settings for you to use, I offer you some guide-
lines and ideas for using the compressor effectively. (You can find sample set-
tings and more ideas in the “Sampling some compression settings” section,
later in this chapter.)
The following steps show you one good way to get familiar with the 
compressor:
1. Dial in a high setting (an 8:1 to a 10:1 ratio), and set the threshold all
the way up by turning the dial fully to the right.
2. Slowly turn down the threshold, watch the meters, and listen carefully.
As you dial the threshold down, notice where the meters are when you
start hearing a change in the sound of the track. Also notice what hap-
pens to the sound when you have the threshold really low and the
meters are peaked (the sound is very different from where you started).
3. Slowly dial the threshold back up again, and notice how the sound
changes back again.
After you get used to how the sound changes as you adjust the threshold, try
using different attack and release settings and do this procedure again. The
more you experiment and critically listen to the changes made by the differ-
ent compressor settings, the better you’ll be able to understand how to get
the sound that you want. The following guidelines can also help you get the
sound you want:
 Try to avoid using compression on your 2-track mix while you mix
your music. This is the job for the mastering phase of your project. If
you compress your stereo tracks during mixdown, you limit what can be
done to your music in the mastering stage. This is true even if you
master it yourself and think you know what you want during mixdown.
 If you hear noise when you use your compressor, you’ve set it too high.
You’re compressing the loud portions enough to make the level of the soft-
est sections of the music (including any noise) much louder in compari-
son. To get rid of the noise, turn down the ratio or the threshold settings.
 To increase the punch of a track, make sure that the attack setting
isn’t too quick. Otherwise, you lose the initial transient and the punch
of a track.
275
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

 To smooth out a track, use a short attack setting and a quick release
time. This evens out the difference in level between the initial transient
and the body of the instrument and results in a smoother sound.
 When using limiting to raise the volume of a track or mix, only limit
2 to 3dB at a time. This way, the limiter doesn’t alter the sound of your
signal; it just reduces the highest peaks and raises the volume.
Less is more when using compression. Resist the temptation to dial too much
in — it just squashes your music. On the other hand, if that’s an effect that
you’re going for, don’t be afraid to experiment.
Sampling some compression settings
Because compressors are used and abused so frequently, I thought it may be
helpful for you to have some basic settings to get you started. This will hope-
fully save you the headache of ruining a few tracks before you get the hang of
this powerful tool.
Lead vocals
Some recording engineers think compression is a must for vocals. It evens
out the often erratic levels that a singer can produce and tames transients
that can cause digital distortion. You can use compression on vocals to just
even out the performance and to create an effect.
If you use a compressor to even out a vocal performance, you don’t want to
hear the compressor working. Instead, you just want to catch the occasional
extremely loud transient that would cause clipping. A good compression set-
ting has a fast attack to catch the stray transient, a quick release so that the
compression doesn’t color the sound of the singer, and a low ratio so that
when the compressor does go on, it smoothes out the vocals without squash-
ing them. Typical settings may look like this:
Threshold: –8dB
Ratio: 1.5:1 to 2:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
If you want to use a compressor that pumps and breathes — that is, one that
you can really hear working — or if you want to bring the vocals way up front
in the mix, try using the following settings. These settings put the vocals “in
your face,” as recording engineers say:
276
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Threshold: –2dB
Ratio: 4:1 to 6:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need to
add a fair amount of gain at this setting.
As you can see, the two parameters that you adjust the most are the thresh-
old and ratio. Experiment with these settings and check the effects of them
by toggling between the affected and unaffected sound (use the Bypass
switch on your compressor).
Backup vocals
What about compressor settings for backup vocals, you may ask? I recom-
mend a setting that’s midway between the invisible compressions and the
pumping and breathing compressions that I describe in the previous section.
Such a setting brings your background vocals forward slightly. Your settings
may look like this:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2:1 to 3:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need to add too much gain.
Electric guitar
Generally, electric guitar sounds are pretty compressed. You don’t need addi-
tional compression when you track the guitar unless you use a clean (undis-
torted) setting on your guitar. If you want to use a little compression to bring
the guitar forward and give it some punch, try these settings:
Threshold: –1dB
Ratio: 2:1 to 3:1
Attack: 25 to 30 ms
Release: About 200 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
277
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

The slow attack is what gives the guitar a bit of punch. If you want less punch-
iness, just shorten the attack slightly. Be careful though, because if you shorten
it too much, you end up with a mushy sound. (Sorry . . . ahem . . . the guitar
has no definition.)
Electric bass
Another way to get a handle on the potential muddiness of the amplified bass
guitar is to use a little compression. Compression can also help control uneven
levels that result from overzealous or inexperienced bass players. Try these
settings for a start:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2.5:1 to 3:1
Attack: 40 to 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
When using compression on bass, make sure that your attack setting isn’t too
short or the sound becomes muddy.
Strummed or picked acoustic stringed instruments
You don’t generally need a lot of compression on acoustic stringed instru-
ments, especially if you want a natural sound. You can use the compressor to
even out the resonance of the instrument to keep the main character of the
instrument from getting lost in a mix and to avoid a muddy sound. These are
good settings for strummed or picked acoustic instruments:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 3:1 to 4:1
Attack: Around 150 ms
Release: About 400 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
The release is set very high because of the amount of sustain that these
acoustic instruments can have. If you play an instrument with less sustain,
like a banjo, you may find that a shorter attack and release work just fine. In
this case, try the following settings:
278
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 2.5:1 to 3:1
Attack: 40 to 50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much, if any, added gain.
Horns
It’s rare that I use a compressor on horns. The only time I may use one is if an
unnatural variation exists in levels due to poor playing (although I usually
prefer to ride the faders to even the levels instead of trying to fix the problem
with compression). Still, if I were to use a compressor, I would start with
these settings:
Threshold: –8dB
Ratio: 2.5:1 to 3:1
Attack: Around 100 ms
Release: About 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
Piano
As with other acoustic instruments, I don’t often use compression on a piano
unless I’m going for a specific effect or I want to even out an erratic perfor-
mance. Settings for effect can run the gamut; just dial in some settings and
see what you get. Using compression to even an erratic piano performance
takes a little more finesse. In this case, start with these mild settings:
Threshold: –10dB
Ratio: 1.5:1 to 2:1
Attack: 100 to 105 ms
Release: About 115 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much, if any, added gain.
279
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

Classical strings
For the most part, adding compression to string instruments played with a
bow isn’t necessary. However, you will find that using a compressor on a
plucked acoustic bass and fiddle can bring them out in a mix.
A starting point for compressor settings for a fiddle would be as follows:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2:1 to 3:1
Attack: 40 to 50 ms
Release: About 100 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much, if any, added gain.
Try these settings for the acoustic bass:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 5:1 to 8:1
Attack: 40 to 50 ms
Release: About 200 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need a
bit of added gain here.
Kick drum
The kick drum responds well to a compressor when tracking. For the most
part, you can get by with settings that allow the initial attack to get through
and that tame the boom a little. Sample settings would look like this:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 4:1 to 6:1
Attack: 40 to 50 ms
Release: 200 to 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
Snare drum
Adding compression to the snare drum is crucial if you want a tight, punchy
sound. You have a lot of choices with the snare. The following settings are
common and versatile:
280
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 4:1 to 6:1
Attack: 5 to 10 ms
Release: 125 to 175 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
Hand drums
Compression is usually a good idea with hand drums because the drum can
produce unpredictable transients. For most hand drums, start with the fol-
lowing settings:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 3:1 to 6:1
Attack: 10 to 25 ms
Release: 100 to 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t
need much added gain.
Percussion
Because percussion instruments have high sound levels and are prone to
extreme transients, I often like to use a little compression just to keep these
transients from eating up headroom in the mix. Here are good starting points:
Threshold: –10dB
Ratio: 3:1 to 6:1
Attack: 10 to 20 ms
Release: About 50 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need a
bit of added gain here.
Introducing gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter. Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out
sound below the threshold while allowing notes above it to be passed
through unaffected.
281
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

Gates are useful to filter out unwanted noise that may be present in the
recording environment. A classic place to use gates is when you record
drums. You can set the gate to filter any sound (other drums for instance)
except for the sounds resulting from the hits to the particular drum that you
have miked.
The following settings are similar to the ones for compressors/limiters:
 Threshold: The threshold sets the level (in dB) at which the gate opens
(stops filtering the signal). The gate allows all signals above the thresh-
old setting to be passed through unaffected, whereas signals below the
threshold setting are reduced by the amount set by the range control.
 Attack: Like with the compressor/limiter, the attack time sets the rate at
which the gate opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for instru-
ments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums, whereas slow attacks are
better suited for instruments with slow attacks, like vocals.
For the most part, try to match the gate’s attack time with that of the
instrument you’re gating. If you don’t do this well, you may hear a click
when the signal crosses the gate’s threshold. This is generally a result of
having the attack set too slow for the instrument. Adjust the attack time
until this click goes away.
 Hold: The hold setting controls the amount of time that the gate stays
open after the signal drops below the threshold. After the hold time is
reached, the gate closes abruptly. This parameter is listed in millisec-
onds (ms). The hold parameter allows you to get the gated drum sound
that was so popular in the 1980s (Phil Collins, anyone?).
 Release: The release setting dictates the rate at which the gate closes
after the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the
hold feature, the release setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather, it slowly
closes (according to the release setting). This produces a more natural
sound. You should set the release time so that it matches the natural
decay time of the instrument. Otherwise, you can get a clipped-off
sound. (If you want the clipped-off sound, use the Hold feature.)
 Range: The range is similar to the ratio setting on the compressor
except you choose the amount (in dB) that you want the signal to be
attenuated (reduced) by the gate. For example, a setting of 40dB drops
signals below the threshold setting by 40 decibels.
Getting started using gates
Noise gates can be extremely useful in getting rid of unwanted noise. The
most common use for a gate is to eliminate bleeding from drum mics. For
example, you may get bleed from your snare drum into your tom-toms mics.
When using noise gates, keep the following tips in mind:
282
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 When the threshold is reached, the gate allows the signal through. If
your background noise is high enough, when the gate opens, you still
hear not only the intended sound but also the background noise. This
can be a problem if you’re using gates to eliminate the noise of your
hard drive fan or other room noise. Your best bet is to use acoustic
panels to eliminate the noise rather to use than gates.
 When gating drums, be sure to set the attack very fast. Otherwise, the
initial transient is lost, and you end up with mushy-sounding drums.
 Take your time setting the release time of the gate so that it sounds nat-
ural and doesn’t clip the end of your instrument’s sound.
 Only set the range high enough to mask unwanted noise. If you set it too
high, the sound becomes unnatural because the natural resonance of
the instrument may be filtered out.
Introducing expanders
The expander is to the gate what a compressor is to a limiter — instead of
reducing the volume of notes below the set threshold by a specified amount,
the expander reduces them by a ratio. In other words, with the gate, you set a
certain amount, in dB, that a signal is reduced, and with the expander, you
reduce the signal by setting a ratio. The ratio changes the signal gradually,
making the affected signals sound more natural.
You use an expander when you want to subtly reduce noise from a track,
rather than just filtering it out completely. A classic example is when dealing
with the breath sounds from a singer. If you use a gate, you get an unnatural-
sounding track because the breaths are filtered out completely. However, you
can set the expander to reduce the breath sounds just enough to be not so
noticeable, but you can leave a little of the sound in so that the singer sounds
normal. (Everyone has to breathe, right?)
Again, the following settings sound familiar from my previous discussion of
compressors and gates:
 Threshold: The threshold in an expander works the same way as with
the gate — anything below the threshold is affected and signals above
the threshold pass unaffected.
 Ratio: The ratio dictates how much the signal is attenuated by the
expander. When using a ratio of 2:1, for instance, the expander reduces
signals below the threshold by a factor of 2. In this case, a signal that is
10dB below the threshold is reduced to 20dB below it; likewise, a signal
that’s 2dB below the threshold would be reduced to 4dB below it.

Because the expander works much like a gate, you can use the same basic
starting points. Choose the gate or expander based on the type of overall
attenuation of the signal you want. For example, the expander is a good choice
if you have an instrument that contains sounds that are too loud but you don’t
want to get rid of them completely (you just want to reduce them a little).
A vocalist’s breath is the perfect situation for using an expander over a gate.
In this case, you can set the expander’s threshold just below the singer’s soft-
est note and start with a low ratio (1.5:1 or 2:1, for instance). See whether the
breath sounds improve, and if they don’t, slowly dial up the ratio until you
get the effect that you want. Be careful not to overdo it though. If the breath
sound drops too far away from the vocal, the vocal sounds unnatural.
If you use a high ratio in your expander (6:1 or above), the effect you get is
similar in sound to that of the gate, only you end up having less control of the
sound because you don’t have the hold or release parameters to adjust. So, if
you have to use a high ratio on a signal, a gate may be a better choice for that
situation.
Effects Processors
Effects processors can be used as either send/return or insert effects. In both
cases, you can work with both the dry (unaffected) signal and the wet (affected)
signal separately. If you use the effect in a send/return routing, you can adjust
the wet and dry signals with the Aux Send and Aux Return knobs. If you use
the effect in a line configuration, the effect has a Mix parameter on it, where
you can adjust the wet/dry balance. Because most people record in a studio
with a fairly dead environment, acoustically speaking, effects are necessary
to make the music sound more natural. The purpose of effects processors 
is to mimic real-world situations or to add a supernatural feel to the music.
You have quite a few choices in effects processors, and many more show up
every year. The most common effects processors are reverb, delay, chorus,
flange, and pitch shifting, all of which I detail in the following sections.
Introducing reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. Reverb is
a natural characteristic of any enclosed room and is the result of sound
waves bouncing off the walls, floor, and ceiling. A small room produces reflec-
tions that start quickly and end soon, whereas larger rooms, halls, or cathe-
drals have slower start times and the reflections last longer.
284
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

This room effect enables you to place your track from front to back in the
mix. You do this by varying how much of the affected signal you include with
the unaffected one. For example, mixing a lot of reverb with the dry signal
gives the impression of being farther away, so your instrument sounds like
it’s in back in the mix.
You can adjust several parameters when using reverb, which gives you a lot
of flexibility. Check out Figure 15-4. This shows what the reverb processor
looks like in a popular computer-based system.
The following list explains how the parameters, most of which you can see in
Figure 15-4, affect the sound of the reverb:
 Algorithm: Whether you use a reverb patch within your recording system
or a separate outboard reverb unit, you can choose the type of reverb
that you want to use. You have the option of a room, hall, or plate (a type
of reverb that uses a metal plate to create its sound). In addition, you
can choose the size of the room (in this case small, medium, and large).
 Decay: The decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or
more reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
 Predelay: A sound reaches your ears before the sound’s reverb does,
and the predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning and
the start of the reverb, which is described in milliseconds (ms). Because
reverb is made up of reflections of sound within a room, the sound takes
time to bounce around the room and reach your ears. By then, you’ve
already heard the sound because it came directly to you. Predelay helps
to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This
parameter is essential in making your reverb sound natural.
A small room has a shorter predelay than a large room. Predelay times
generally range between 10 and 50 ms.

Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

 Density: The density parameter (not shown in the reverb plug-in in
Figure 15-4) controls the level of the early reflections (the first few mil-
liseconds of the reverb sound). Because the early reflections take less
time to reach your ear than the main body of the reverb, you hear a thin-
ner reverb sound to begin with, followed by the main reverb. The den-
sity parameter enables you to simulate different room sizes because the
main section of a reverb takes longer to reach you in a larger room. The
higher the density setting, the larger the apparent room size. Not all
reverbs have this setting.
Some reverb processors don’t have a density setting (as is the case for
the processor shown in Figure 15-4). In such a case, this parameter is
usually factory set and varies based on the type and size of room para-
meters that you choose.
 Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the main sec-
tion of the reverb sound. A higher diffusion setting results in a thicker
sound. Think of the diffusion parameter as a way to simulate how reflec-
tive the room is. More reflective rooms produce a much higher diffusion.
To simulate a less reflective room, use lower diffusion settings.
Like the density setting, some reverbs don’t have a diffusion parameter;
instead, it’s factory set and depends on the room type/size parameter
that you choose.
 Hi Cut and Low Cut filters: These filters allow you to control the rate at
which the high and low frequencies decay. Most of the time the high fre-
quencies decay faster, so being able to control this effect can result in a
more natural-sounding reverb.
Getting started using reverb
Reverb is like garlic: The more you use, the less you can taste it. Just as the
new chef puts garlic in everything (and lots of it), many budding sound engi-
neers make the same mistake with reverb. Go easy. Remember: Less is more.
Here are some other points to keep in mind:
 Mixes often sound better when you use reverb on only a few instru-
ments instead of them all. For example, it’s common for just the snare
drum of the drum set to have reverb on it. The rest of the drums and
cymbals remain dry (unaffected).
 Think about how you want each instrument to sit in the mix when you
choose reverb. Make sure that the type and amount of reverb fit the
song and the rest of the instruments.
 Try putting the dry sound on one side of the stereo field and the
reverb on the other. For example, if you have a rhythm guitar part that
286
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

you set at 30 degrees off to the right of the stereo field, set the reverb 
30 degrees off to the left. This can produce a nice effect.
 To keep the vocals up front in the mix, use a short reverb setting. A vocal
plate is a great choice because the decay is fast. This adds a fair amount
of the reverb to the vocal without making it sit way back in the mix.
 Experiment with room types, sizes, and decay times. Sometimes a long
decay on a small-room reverb sounds better than a short decay on a
large-room or hall reverb.
Introducing delay
Along with reverb, delay is a natural part of sound that bounces around a
room. When you speak (or sing or play) in a room, you often hear not only
reverb but also a distinct echo. This echo may be short or long depending on
the size of the room. The original sound may bounce back to you as a single
echo or as multiple, progressively quieter delays.
Several types of delay effects exist, including a slap-back echo, tape delay,
and multiple delays, and each of them is designed to add dimension to your
instrument. To create these various effects, you adjust several parameters, as
the following list and Figure 15-5 make clear. Different delay processors have
different parameters, but the three most universal and useful parameters are
time, feedback, and mix/effect level, as follows:
 Gain: This lets you set the signal level going into the delay.
 Mix: This parameter controls the output level of the effect. The higher
you set this parameter, the louder the delayed signal is relative to the
original signal.
 LPF: The low-pass filter (LPF) lets you filter out some of the high fre-
quencies from the delay.

287
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

 Delay: This parameter controls the amount of time between the initial
signal and the repeated sound. The time is listed in milliseconds (ms)
and can be as short as a few milliseconds or as long as several seconds.
 Depth: This parameter lets you add modulation to the delay so that you
can create a chorus effect. (See the “Getting started chorusing” section,
later in this chapter, for more on chorus and flange effects). The higher
the level on this setting, the greater the modulation.
 Rate: This setting lets you adjust the amount of time that the modulation
takes to go one time through its cycle.
 Feedback: The Feedback parameter controls how many times the echo
repeats. A low setting makes the echo happen just once, and higher set-
tings produce more echoes.
Getting started using delay
Delay is used a lot in contemporary music, and many times you don’t hear it
unless you listen carefully. Other times, it is prominent in the mix, like the
snare drum in some reggae music. Here are ways that you can use delay in
your music:
 Use delay as a slap-back echo on vocals. A slap-back echo consists of one
to three repeats spaced very closely together, which fattens the sound
of the vocals. You generally want to set your time parameter between 90
and 120 milliseconds. Set the level so that you barely hear the first echo
when your vocal is in the mix and adjust it from there until you like the
sound. In pop music, a slap-back echo and a vocal plate reverb are com-
monly used on lead vocals (it was really common in the 1950s).
 Use the tempo match feature to have your delay echo in time with the
music. This can add some depth to the mix without creating a muddy or
cluttered sound. Be careful, because if you use this too much, it can
make your music sound annoyingly repetitive.
 To create special effects with delay, try using the pan or shift controls
to move your instruments in the mix. This can be a lot of fun on back-
ground instruments, such as rhythm guitar and synthesizers.
Introducing pitch shifting
Pitch shifting allows you to change the pitch of a recorded instrument. This
gives you a number of different options when you mix. For example, you can
run your backup vocals through a pitch-shifting device to make them sound
288
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

fuller. Or you can create backup vocals from the lead vocal track by multing
(making a copy and putting it on another track or two) the lead vocal and
subjecting it to a pitch shifter.
Using a pitch shifter is pretty easy: Open the program and choose how much
you want to change the pitch either up or down. To use the pitch shifter to
fill out a vocal, just change the pitch (up or down — it doesn’t matter) a few
semitones until you like the sound. You can either create a subtle effect that
sounds like two or more people trying to sing the same pitch, or you can
create harmonies by changing the pitch one or more steps.
Chorus
Chorus takes the original sound and creates a copy that is slightly out of tune
with the original. Unlike the pitch shifter — an effect that remains constant —
the chorus’s shifted pitch varies over time. This variance is called modula-
tion, and the result is an effect that can add interest and variety to an instru-
ment. Chorus is used extensively to add fullness to a sound, particularly
guitars and vocals.
Most chorus effects give you several parameters with which to work, as the
following list makes clear:
 Rate: The rate dictates how fast the modulation happens. This parame-
ter is described as a frequency (usually 0.1 to 10 Hz). The frequency
actually doesn’t refer to a pitch; rather, it describes how many times per
second (Hz) the oscillation happens. The oscillation is controlled by the
depth parameter.
 Depth: The depth parameter controls the amount of pitch modulation
that’s produced by the chorus. The settings are often arbitrary (you can
get a range of 1 to 100). This range relates to a percentage of the maximum
depth to which the particular chorus can go, rather than an actual level.
 Predelay: The predelay setting affects how far out of time the chorus’s
sound is in relation to the original. This setting is listed in milliseconds,
and the lower the number, the closer the chorused sound is to the origi-
nal in time.
 Feedback: The feedback control sends the affected sound from the chorus
back in again. This allows you to extend the amount of chorusing that
the effect creates. This setting can also be called stages in some systems.
 Effect Level: This could also be called mix in some systems. The effect
level controls how much effect is sent to the aux return bus. This allows
you to adjust how affected the sound becomes.
289
Chapter 15: Dialing in Signal Processors

Getting started chorusing
If reverb is like garlic, chorus is like cayenne pepper. You may get away with
adding a little too much garlic in your food, but if you add too much cayenne,
you run the risk of making your food inedible. Such is the case with the
chorus effect. Used sparingly, chorus can add a lot to your music, but if it’s
overdone, it can wreak havoc on a good song. Here are some tips for using
this effect:
 To fill out a vocal track, try setting the rate at 2 Hz, the depth at about 
20 to 30, and the predelay at 10 to 20 ms. Keep the feedback level low.
 Use a chorus on backup vocals to make them fuller and allow you to use
fewer tracks.
 Pan the chorus to one side of the mix and the dry (unaffected) signal to
the other. This can be especially interesting on guitars and synthesizer
patches.
Along with chorus, your system may have other modulating effects, such as
flange and phase shifting. These two effects work much like chorus, except
they alter the original signal in time (flange) and in sound-wave position
(phase shifting) rather than pitch. The parameters you have for such effects
are similar to those that you find for chorus effects. You can use the flange
and phase shifters in many of the same applications as the chorus if you’re
going for a different effect.
Simulating Effects
Recently, effects have emerged that allow you to alter your original signal 
so that it sounds like it was recorded using a different technique or source.
These are simulator effects, and the two most common are microphone and
amplifier simulators (modelers). Both of these effects are intended to be line
effects, but on some systems, you can use them as send/return effects to
create interesting, well, effects.
Microphone simulator
As its name suggests, the mic simulator alters your signal to make it sound
like it was recorded through a different microphone than the one you used
(obviously). The great thing about the mic simulator effect is that you can
290
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

have a bunch of microphone sounds available to you without buying a bunch
of expensive mics.
The only real drawback to mic simulator programs is that they don’t sound
exactly like the mics that they’re trying to model. I mean, making a $100
dynamic mic sound like a $3,000 large-diaphragm condenser mic is pretty
hard, no matter how much computer processing you do. But this is no big
deal, because all you’re trying to do with a mic simulator is to expand the
options that you have with a given mic. So even though the modeler can’t
exactly match the bigger-buck mic, it can provide a pretty decent sound for
your inexpensive mic.
The other possible drawback to using a mic simulator program is that the mic
that you used to record the part in the first place may have an impact on how
well the simulator sounds. Most mic simulator programs designate which mic
was used to model the initial sound and which mic the simulator is trying to
sound like. For example, in the Roland V-Studios, as you scroll through the
various mic simulator patches (effects), you see them listed with one mic name
followed by another (“SM57 – U87,” for instance). If you want to get a sound
like the second mic listed, you need to use the first mic listed.
If you use a different mic than the one listed first, you get a different sound,
but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s just different.
Amp simulator
The amp simulator effect allows you to essentially have access to a whole
roomful of top-notch amps without having to buy, maintain, or store them.
One of the great things about amp simulators is that they allow you to plug
your guitar directly into your mixer (or direct box), and you can eliminate a
lot of noise that miking your guitar amp can cause. You also get to choose the
sound that you ultimately want after you’ve recorded your part. This gives
you more flexibility during mixdown.
The downside to amp simulators, as with mic simulators, is that they may not
sound exactly like the amp they’re trying to model, but this shouldn’t matter
as long as you get the sound that you want. Another downside is that amp
simulators use processing power, and if you have a ton of tracks with a bunch
of effects and other plug-ins, you may find your computer getting bogged
down a bit. The remedy for this is to print (record) the effect onto a separate
track before you mix the song. This frees power for other uses.

Mastering Your Music
In This Chapter
 Understanding mastering
 Knowing when to master your music yourself
 Knowing when to send your music to a mastering house
 Taking a turn at mastering your music
 Putting your music on CD
You’ve spent a lot of time getting all your tracks recorded using the best
mics that you can afford (mics you’ve carefully set up following the guide-
lines in Chapter 9, I hope!). You adjusted your levels just right, EQed, panned,
and added effects to each instrument with great care so that they fit perfectly
in the mix. Now you have awesome-sounding music. So all that’s left is to
burn a CD, create cool cover artwork, and make some copies — and you’re
ready to go platinum, right?
Well, you could do that, but you would be missing one of the most important
steps in getting your music to sound its very best. This is the mastering
process. Mastering can turn your already-good music into a truly great CD.
The only problem is that most people have no idea what mastering is. It’s
been presented as some mysterious voodoo that only people who belong to
some secret society and have access to a magical pile of gear can do.
This isn’t the case. Mastering is, in fact, a pretty simple process that involves
pieces of equipment that you’ve already used. Mastering does require spe-
cialized skills, but you don’t need to go through strange initiation rites to
understand them. All it takes is an idea of what to do, decent ears (you’ve got
a couple of those, right?), and a dose of patience while you work your way
through the process.
In this chapter, you get a chance to understand the “magic” that is mastering.
You discover what’s involved in mastering your music. You explore ways to
master your music yourself and discern when it may be best to find a profes-
sional to do the job for you. You also discover how to burn your mastered
music to CD and to make copies of your finished music.

Demystifying Mastering
The mastering process of recording involves preparing your music for dupli-
cation. Several steps are involved in taking your songs from individual, mixed
tunes to part of a whole album. First, you need to optimize the dynamics and
tonal balance of each song, and then you need to process the songs so that
they are matched in volume to each other. These steps usually involve doing
some EQing, compressing, limiting, and sometimes expanding to the songs.
You also need to sequence your music so that you have the songs in the best
possible order and you have the appropriate amount of time between each
song. Your last step is to put your mastered music onto a format that enables
you to duplicate it. (This is usually a CD. I describe this process in detail in
the “Getting into CD Burning” section, later in this chapter.)
Processing
No matter how well you recorded and mixed your music, you still need to do
some processing during the mastering stage. This usually consists of adjust-
ing levels with compression, limiting, and EQing and using additional pro-
cessing if necessary.
The purpose of the processing stage is to balance the overall tonal character-
istics of each song and optimize the dynamics of each song so that the songs
are at their best overall volume. You can achieve these goals by using the fol-
lowing tools:
 Compression: Some music sounds best when it’s smooth, and other music
is much better when it has a punchy quality to it. Judicious use of com-
pression can produce either of these effects. (I give you some sugges-
tions for compressor settings in the section “Optimizing dynamics,” later
this chapter.) A good mastering engineer knows when and how to make
music punchy or smooth. (Sorry, you can’t have both at the same time.)
Adding compression to the mastering process is an art. Too much or the
wrong type of compression makes your music sound flat. Too little, and
your music may sound weak.
 Limiters: If any instruments are too loud in comparison to the rest of the
mix, a limiter can tame them so that the difference between the song’s
peak level and average level is optimal. This difference varies depending
on the style of music, but it should never be less than 6dB and is usually
between 12dB and 18dB.
 EQ: Because you recorded and mixed each of your songs individually
over a period of time (often a long period of time), each song probably
294
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

sounds a little different. Some may be brighter than others, some may 
be heavier on bass, but one thing’s for sure — each has a different 
tonal quality.
For your compilation of songs to work as a unit, the songs’ tonal quality
needs to be somewhat consistent. The songs don’t have to all sound the
same, but they do need to work well together. The mastering engineer
uses multiband EQs on each song to make them work as separate songs
and gel as a complete artistic statement.
Sequencing
Sequencing involves putting your songs in the order that you want and setting
the blank space between each song so that the CD flows well from one song
to another. Because a CD is supposed to represent a cohesive body of work,
this is one of the most important aspects of mastering.
Leveling
A crucial aspect of mastering a CD is getting the levels of all the songs to be
the same. After all, you don’t want your listener to have to adjust the volume
of his stereo from one song to another. Having consistent levels from song to
song helps with the cohesiveness and flow of a CD. This is done with simple
gain adjustments, compressors, and/or limiters.
Getting Ready to Master
When mastering your music, you can save yourself a ton of time and energy if
you keep a few things in mind during the mixing stage. When you’re wearing
your Mixing Master hat, the following reminders can make the mastering
process go a bit more smoothly:
 Check your levels. Listen to your mix quietly and you can tell whether
one instrument stands out too much in the mix. Also, burn a CD of your
mixed song to test on other systems (your car, a boom box, or your
friend’s stereo system). Listen carefully. If the bass drum is even slightly
too loud, it eats up the headroom of the rest of the instruments, and you
can’t get the volume of the song very high.
 Check your EQ. Even though the mastering engineer EQs the entire
song, make sure that you spend the time getting each instrument EQed
as best as you can in the mix. If you don’t get your EQ just right during
the mixing process and the bass guitar sound, for example, is muddy
295
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

and needs to be EQed during mastering, you lose some of the low end 
on all the instruments. This makes your mix sound thin. If your bass is
EQed properly in the first place, you don’t have to make this adjustment
to the entire mix.
 Test your mix in mono (turn off the stereo panning on your master
bus). This helps you hear whether any instrument’s volume or tonal
characteristics are seriously out of balance with others. I never consider
a mix finished until I monitor it in mono.
 Apply compression to your mix before you record the 2-track mix just
to see what your music sounds like compressed. Don’t record the com-
pression, though. Leave that for the mastering engineer. By testing your
mix with some compression, you may hear whether certain instruments
are too loud in the mix because this becomes more apparent when the
mix is compressed.
 Listen for phase holes. Phase holes occur when you record an instru-
ment (for example, piano or back-up vocals) in stereo and the two tracks
are out of phase. To listen for phase holes, pay attention to how the
instrument sounds in the stereo field. You have a phase hole if you hear
sound coming only from the far right and far left and nothing seems to
be coming from the center of the stereo field. If you have this problem,
just reverse the phase on one of the two channels for that instrument.
Even though a lot can be done to your music in the mastering stage, don’t
rely on mastering to fix problems in your mix. Get your music to sound as
good as you can during mixing. If you do this, the mastering engineer has an
easier job and can make your music sound even better. If you don’t, you’re
stuck with a bunch of compromises in the mastering stage.
Paying a Pro or Doing It Yourself
Whether to master your music yourself or to hire a professional may be one
of your toughest music-making decisions. If you master your music yourself,
you can have complete control from start to finish and save yourself some
bucks. On the other hand, if you hand your mixed music to a skilled profes-
sional, you have the added benefit of another person’s ears and advice, and
you can end up with a finished product that far exceeds your expectations.
So how do you choose? Well, your first consideration is probably based on
economics — do you have the money to spend on professional help (for your
music, that is)? Mastering can cost from a couple hundred to thousands of
dollars. A midline mastering engineer often charges around $500 to master
your CD (about ten songs). This may seem like a lot of money, but if you find
296
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

the right engineer for your music, it can make the difference between a
decent CD and a truly world-class one.
Another consideration for hiring out your mastering is how well you know
your equipment and how capable it is of performing the mastering proce-
dure. To do mastering, you need at least one good (well, preferably great)
multiband compressor, a limiter, and a great multiband parametric EQ. You
also need to have a CD burner of some sort and the software to create a Red
Book CD master (more about this in the section “Recording Your Music to
CD-R,” later in this chapter).
Before you decide, take a look at other benefits of hiring a skilled professional
to do your mastering:
 You get a meticulously tuned room and top-notch monitors. This
enables you to hear what your music actually sounds like.
 The professional has equipment that’s specifically designed to handle
the process of mastering. The EQs, compressors, and other gear that the
mastering house uses can tweak your music so that it can sound its best.
 You get a fresh set of professional ears that may be able to hear things
in your mix that need fixing. You may be so close to the project that
you have a hard time hearing your mix objectively. You may not even
know what adjustments to make to your music so that it sounds its best.
Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
If you decide to use a professional mastering engineer, the following tips can
help you choose one for your project:
 Ask around for referrals. If you know local bands or musicians whose
music you like and whose CD sounds great, ask them who mastered their
music. Call local studios and find out who they recommend for mastering
in your area. Also check out Brad Blackwood’s forum at ProSoundWeb.com
(recforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/f/31/0) and Recording.org’s
mastering forum (www.recording.org/forum-20.html).
 Listen to other recordings that the mastering house has done in a style
of music similar to yours. You’re entrusting your artistic vision to some-
one else, and you need to be sure that this person is the right person for
the job. If you like what the prospective mastering engineer has done on
other people’s music, you’ll probably like what he does with yours. On
the other hand, if he has never worked with music similar to yours or if
you don’t like the way he mastered someone else’s music, he’s probably
not the right person for the job.
297
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

 Clarify the fee for your project before you start working together.
Most mastering engineers charge by the hour and can give you a pretty
good estimate of how many hours they will need to do the job. You’ll
also be expected to pay for materials (reference CDs, for example).
 If you don’t like the way the engineer mastered your music, you’ll
probably be charged the hourly rate to redo it. Some engineers may
redo your project for free, but don’t count on it. Be sure to discuss this
possibility before you start the project so that you’re not met with an
unwanted surprise.
Many mastering engineers can do a demo of one or two of your songs so that
you can hear what kind of job they can do to your music before you hire
them. Ask whether the mastering engineer you’re interested in offers this ser-
vice. This can save both you and the engineer a lot of time and energy if he or
she isn’t right for the job. It can also help you determine whether your mixed
music is ready for mastering or whether you need to go back and make
adjustments.
After you choose the mastering engineer that you think will work well for you
and your music, you can make the process much easier and less stressful for
both you and the engineer if you follow these guidelines:
 Discuss your expectations and desires. This is the best way to ensure
that your mastered music turns out the way you want. People who are
unhappy with the job that the mastering engineer does usually aren’t
clear about what they want or don’t understand what is possible in the
mastering process.
 Take a few CDs whose sound you like with you to the mastering ses-
sion. Talk with the engineer about how you can get your music to sound
similar. A skilled engineer can let you know right away whether the
sound you want is possible.
 Try to be present at the mastering session. Many people send their
music to a mastering engineer and expect him or her to do the job 
without their presence in the studio. Try to go to the studio, but if you
can’t, be sure that the engineer clearly understands your desires and
expectations.
If you’re in the studio during the mastering process and things aren’t going
the way you want, talk with the engineer and try to get things on track again.
If you’re unable to communicate with the engineer, stop the session, have
him burn a ref (reference copy), pay for the time that you’ve used, and listen
to the ref at home. If you don’t like what you hear at home, you may be better
off going somewhere else with your music.

If you’re at the mastering session and the mastering engineer insists on work-
ing on your music while listening at really loud levels (although occasional
checks at high volumes are okay), grab your mix CD and run, don’t walk, from
the session. This is a true sign of an inexperienced (or incompetent) master-
ing engineer. Mastering needs to be done at low to moderate levels because
the tonal balance of music changes at high volumes.
Mastering Your Music Yourself
If you decide that you just have to do the mastering yourself, or at least you
want to try it once before you decide to spend the money on a pro, following
some guidelines can increase your chances of mastering success. I describe
them in this section.
In other chapters, I present some specific techniques and settings to get you
started. Unfortunately, I can’t do that when it comes to mastering. There 
are just too many variables and too many ways to mess up your music when
trying to master it. What I can (and do) help you with in the upcoming sec-
tions is walk you through the process of mastering and show you the tools 
to use for each step. When reading these sections, keep the following points
in mind:
 Less is more when mastering. Do as little as possible to your music. If
you find that you have to make a lot of adjustments, you may want to go
back to the mixing process and try again. When you master your music,
you only need to optimize the dynamics and tonal balance of each song,
get the levels between the songs even, and sequence your songs.
 Mastering is all about compromise. Each adjustment you make to your
mixed music affects all the instruments. If you use EQ to get rid of mud-
diness on the bass guitar, you affect not only the bass guitar but also
every other instrument in the mix.
 Don’t try to master a song right after you mix it. Give yourself time and
space from that song before you do anything. In fact, I recommend that
you take a few days away from any of the songs for your album between
the mixing and mastering stages. A little time to reflect and rest your
ears can do wonders for your ability to hear what your music needs.
 You can only master music if your monitors and monitoring environ-
ment are great. Without a good reference for how your music sounds,
trying to EQ or dynamically process your music does no good. The
music may sound good through your speakers but probably doesn’t
through others’. Before you master, make your room sound as good as
you can and get to know the strengths and weaknesses of your monitor-
ing environment by listening to a ton of commercial CDs that have a
sound that you’re trying to emulate.

Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

Optimizing dynamics
Okay, this is where the magic in mastering happens. This is where you can
make your music shine or where you can royally mess it up. (How’s that for
adding a little pressure?) Before you get tense (okay, breathe), remember that
you can always go back and try again. Oh, did I mention that you should
make backup copies of your individual tracks and your final mix? Well, if you
haven’t already done the backing-up business, now would be a good time to
do that. I’ll wait.
Are you done? Okay, now to the job at hand — getting your music to be as
loud as possible. (I’m just kidding; see the sidebar “Turn it up!”) Seriously,
optimizing the dynamics of your songs doesn’t mean getting it as loud as you
can, but rather getting it to have life and emotion. And, yes, this also means
getting it to be loud enough to sound good.
The style of your music and the arrangements that you use determine how
you optimize the dynamics of your music. For example, classical music has 
a much broader dynamic range than rock music, and the infamous “wall of
sound” type of arrangement has a narrower dynamic range than a song with
sparse verses and thicker choruses.
When you’re optimizing the dynamics of your music, be sensitive to the song
and try not to get sucked into the idea that you need to get the most volume
out of your music. I know I’m beating this volume thing into the ground, but
you would be surprised how seductive it is to try to get just a few more dB
out of the song (no, wait; you’ll soon find out).
You have two main tools to use when you work on the dynamics during mas-
tering — a compressor and a limiter — and each has its purpose. For the
most part, if you’re trying to add punch or smoothness to your music, a com-
pressor does the job nicely. On the other hand, if you’re trying to squeeze a
little more volume out of a song and you don’t want to change the song’s
sound quality, a limiter is your best choice.
Here are suggestions that can help you to use compression and limiting (also
covered in Chapter 15) most effectively during mastering:
 Use a mild compression ratio (between 1.1:1 and 2:1) to keep from
overcompressing your music.
 Apply only 1–2dB of compression or limiting at one time. If you need
more than that, chain more than one compressor together and use these
small amounts on each. If you compress or limit more than 1 or 2dB at a
time, you end up with artifacts (audible changes to your music caused by
the compressor or limiter).
300
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Work with your attack and release times. An attack that’s too short
takes the punch out of your music by cutting off the initial transients.
Likewise, a release time that’s too long doesn’t recover quickly enough,
and the dynamics of the vocals disappear. In contrast, if the release time
is too short, you hear distortion.
 Set the threshold so that your compressor’s meters dance (bounce) to
the rhythm of the music. Only the loudest notes (snare drum or lead
vocal accents, for example) should trigger the meters and then only by 
1 or 2 dB.
 Use a multiband compressor to bring out individual instruments in
the mix. For example, if the bass drum seems to be getting lost, you can
apply mild compression to the lower frequencies (around 80 to 100 Hz).
This brings the instrument forward in the mix slightly.
 When you’re not sure that what you’re doing sounds better, don’t use
the processor. Any dynamics processing is going to affect the quality of
your song’s sound to some extent. If adding this processing doesn’t
improve the overall sound, you’re better off not using it.
A song without a significant difference between its softest and loudest notes
quickly becomes tiring to listen to. Always keep the difference between the
average level and the peak level greater than 6dB. In fact, try to have a peak-
to-average ratio of 12 to 18dB if you can. Your music will have a lot more life
in it and sound much more interesting.
You can get a good idea of the peak-to-average ratio of your song by watching
your meters and noticing where they max out and where they seem to stay
most often. Some systems allow you to switch your meters between Peak and
Average settings. (To find out whether your system has this option, check
your owner’s manual, which should be clear about your metering options.)
Play the song and make note of the highest peaks using the Peak metering
setting. Then listen to your song again using the Average setting on your
meters and make a note of this level. When you’re done, compare the two.
More scientific ways to do this exist, but this technique gives you a good 
idea of your peak-to-average ratio.
When you’re testing your compression or limiter settings (you do this by
comparing the processed and unprocessed versions), be sure to have the
volume of both versions exactly the same. Any difference in volume defeats
the purpose of side-by-side comparison because people almost always prefer
the louder version, regardless of whether it sounds better.
Perfecting tonal balance
The tonal balance of a song is how the various frequencies of the music relate
to one another. You’re not concerned with how each instrument sounds in
the mix (that’s the job for the mixing stage); instead, you’re looking for an
overall balance of frequencies within the hearing spectrum.
301
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

For the most part, a tonal balance consists of an even distribution of frequen-
cies from 20Hz–10 kHz with a slight drop-off (1–2dB) from 10–20 kHz or higher.
That’s great, you say, but what does that sound like? Well, listen to a number
of great CDs, and you’ll hear it.
When you master your music, you want to constantly compare the sound of
your song to that of other CDs whose sound you like. In Chapter 14, I list a
variety of excellent reference CDs for mixing. These CDs work just as well for
mastering, so check them out.
When you adjust the overall tonal balance of your songs, listen carefully for
frequencies that seem too loud or too soft. You can find these frequencies by
listening to the instruments in the mix or by using a parametric EQ and
sweeping the frequency spectrum. To do this, set your Q fairly wide (0.6, for
instance) and turn the gain knob all the way up. Start with the lowest fre-
quency and slowly raise the frequency as the song plays. Adjust annoying fre-
quencies by cutting them by a couple of dB to see whether your overall mix
improves.
Follow these general EQ guidelines:
 If your mix sounds muddy, add high frequencies (above 10 kHz) or cut
low ones (200–400 Hz). Likewise, if your mix is too bright (common with
digital recording), try reducing the frequencies above 10 kHz by using a
shelf EQ or a Baxandall curve.
302
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Turn it up!
Everyone wants his or her music to be as loud as
possible. Louder sounds better. In fact, test after
test has shown that when people listen to two
versions of a song, they nearly always prefer the
louder one (regardless of whether it actually
sounds better). Musicians, producers, and engi-
neers seem to be in a competition to see who
can make the loudest CD. If you compare a CD
made about ten years ago with one made this
year, you’ll notice that the newer one is much
louder. Give them both a good listen though.
Does the louder one really sound better?
You can test this by setting both CDs to play at
the same volume and then switching back and
forth. (You need to turn the volume up a bit on the
older CD to match the volume of the newer one.)
One way to do this is to record both songs into
your DAW and set the levels of each so that
they’re the same. At the same volume, which
song sounds better to you? I’m willing to bet that
nine out of ten times, you’ll prefer the older song.
This is because older recordings have more
dynamic range than newer ones. The variety is
pleasing to listen to, whereas the song with only
a small dynamic range quickly becomes tiring.
Do yourself and your listeners a favor, and resist
the temptation to compress the dynamic variabil-
ity out of your music. Your mix will be much easier
to listen to and have a lot more life and excite-
ment. You can always turn the volume up on your
stereo if it’s not loud enough, but you can’t add
dynamic range after you’ve squashed it out.

To use a Baxandall curve, use a parametric EQ and set the threshold at
20 kHz with a Q setting of about 1. This gradually cuts frequencies above
around 10 kHz. You can adjust the Q to reach as far down as you want.
Your EQ graph shows you what’s happening.
 Use the same EQ adjustments for both the right and left channels. This
keeps the stereo balance intact and doesn’t alter the relative phase
between the channels. For example, if you add some bass frequencies
(100 Hz, for example) to the one channel and not the other, you may
hear a wavering or pulsating sound around this frequency that goes
back and forth between the speakers.
 If you used a multiband compressor on specific frequencies, you may
need to make some EQ adjustments to them. Compression tends to
mess with the frequency response.
 If you need to adjust the EQ of certain instruments in the mix (the
snare drum is buried, for example), note the overall effects of your
adjustments on the rest of the mix. If your adjustments aren’t fixing the
problem, go back to the mixing process and make your adjustments
there. You’ll be glad you took the time to do this.
Any adjustments you make to the EQ during mastering impact more
than just those frequencies; the adjustments alter the entire frequency
spectrum and the relationship between all the instruments. So listen
carefully as you make adjustments, and back off the additional EQ if you
don’t like what you hear.
Some people check the tonal balance of their songs against that of their
favorite CDs. You do this by recording a song into your mastering program
and taking a look at its frequency response by using a spectral analyzer.
(Some programs have a built-in spectral analyzer, but you can also buy one
as a plug-in for many systems.) Then do an analysis of your song and com-
pare it to the spectral analysis of a CD you like. This technique seems to work
for many people (not me though; I like using my ears instead — but alas, I’m
old-fashioned).
Sequencing your songs
Sequencing your songs consists of choosing the order of the songs on the CD
as well as the amount of silence between each song. When you wrote and
recorded your songs, you probably had an idea about the order in which you
wanted them to appear on your CD. If you don’t know how you want to
arrange your songs, here are some things to consider:
 Consider each song’s tempo in the sequencing equation. Some CDs work
well if songs with a similar tempo are placed together, while others work
best when contrasting songs follow one another.
303
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

 Think about a song’s lyrics and how they relate to the lyrics from the
other songs on your CD. If you want to tell your listener a story, consider
how the order of the songs can best tell that story.
 Think about the chords that you used in each song and how they relate
to another song that you may want to place before or after it in the
sequence. The ending chord of one song can conflict with the beginning
chord of another.
Aside from having to decide how your songs are ordered on your CD, you
also have to think about how much time you put between each song in order
to create the most impact. Many people assume that you use a set amount of
time between all the songs on each CD. This isn’t the case. You can put any
amount of silence between each song that you feel is appropriate to set the
mood that you want. Sometimes you may want just a second or two; other
times four or five seconds is more appropriate.
For example, if you have a mellow ballad followed by an upbeat song, you
may want to leave a little more time between these two songs so that the lis-
tener is prepared for the faster song (try leaving a space that’s 4 to 6 beats
long at the slower song’s tempo, for instance). Or, if you want two tunes to
flow together, you can leave less time in between them. Use your ears and
think about how you want your listener to respond when going from one
song to another.
Balancing levels
For a truly professional-sounding CD, you want all your songs to be at nearly
the same relative level so that your listeners (I hope you have more than one)
don’t have to adjust the volume on their stereos from song to song.
Balancing the levels of your songs to one another is pretty easy. In fact, in most
cases, you have very little to do after you EQ and optimize the dynamics of
each song. You balance the levels from one song to the next by playing one
song, then the next, and listening for significant volume differences. (Didn’t 
I say that it was easy?) You can also look at your master bus meters to see
whether each song is at the same level, but your ears are a much better judge.
If you notice any differences, just raise (or better yet, lower) the levels until
they are all roughly the same. Don’t get too finicky. Some variation from song
to song is okay. In fact, minor differences can help to make your CD more
interesting to listen to. When you’re balancing levels, just make sure that 
any differences aren’t enough to make the listener run to his or her stereo 
to adjust the volume knob. If one or two songs seem to be much lower in
304
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

volume than the rest, you may want to go back to the volume-optimizing
stage and raise those songs up a bit to make them more consistent with the
rest of the songs on the CD. This way, you don’t lower the volume of the
entire CD based on one or two quiet songs.
Preparing for CD
After you have all your songs optimized, balanced, and sequenced, it’s time
for the final step. This last step involves saving your music in a format that
enables you to duplicate the music. Generally, duplication plants can take
your mastered music in several formats, but the most popular and easiest is
a Red Book audio CD-R. If you go to a professional mastering house, whoever
you work with will put your mastered music on the format that they prefer
(or you can ask for the format of your choice). If you’re mastering your music
yourself, you’re most likely doing this with a hard-drive recording system, so
you’ll use a CD-R to make a Red Book CD master.
To make a CD master, you need to get your music files to a 16-bit, 44.1-kHz
format. If you’re using any of the newer hard-drive recording systems, you
probably recorded at a higher resolution and possibly higher sampling rate
than this. (You would have set these parameters when you set up your song.
If you can’t remember, check your owner’s manual to find out how to deter-
mine a song’s settings.) If this is the case, you need to translate your music
from the higher rates to the CD rates. This is called dithering.
Don’t worry; dithering is easy to do — a heckuva lot easier than the record-
ing, mixing, and mastering steps you’ve done so far. In fact, you just set your
mastering software to dither for you, and you’re set. Before you take your
master to be duplicated, be sure to listen to the dithered and undithered ver-
sions to make sure that they sound the same (or close enough, because you
lose some audio quality when you dither down).
Getting into CD Burning
Today, one of the coolest things about audio recording is that you can create
music in your home and put it on the same medium that the biggest record
companies use. When I first started as a recording engineer, the best you
could do was put your music on a cassette for other people to listen to.
Pressing vinyl was expensive. But now anyone with a computer, a CD burner,
and a few inexpensive CD-Rs can put his or her music on the same format as
all the best albums in the record store. You gotta love it!
305
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

You probably have a computer with a CD-R or CD-RW drive. If so, you also
have software that you can use to burn your CDs. Most CD-burning software
works fine for putting your mastered music onto CDs. If you don’t already
have a burner and want to add one to your existing computer, check the
system requirements for the burner that interests you to make sure that your
system is capable of using it. For audio CDs, you can use just about any CD
burner on the market (as long as it’s compatible with your system, of
course).
If you have an SIAB (studio-in-a-box) system or a stand-alone system, you can
burn CDs in one of these three ways:
 Connect your recorder to a computer and transfer your music files to
your computer to burn your CDs.
 Get a CD burner that’s designed to work with your recorder. All SIAB
systems have a CD recorder option. This option is mounted inside the
box (a Yamaha AW4416, for instance) or connects to the SCSI port of the
recorder (Roland systems).
 Get a stand-alone CD-burning system. Stand-alone CD recorders come
in a variety of types, from real-time recorders that function like a cas-
sette recorder to hard-drive-based recorders, such as the Alesis
Masterlink.
Regardless of the CD burner you get, make sure that you can create a Red
Book CD. I know that this sounds mysterious, but all the Red Book term
means is that the CD is an audio CD, not a CD-ROM. Red Book is a standard
that dictates that the data is in an audio CD format. This ensures that your
CD can play on all audio CD players. Your CD burner clearly states whether 
it can burn audio, or Red Book, CDs.
Purchasing CD-Rs
A staggering variety of CD-Rs are available. You have green, blue, gold, even
black CDs, and you have data and music CDs. So which ones are best? Well,
that depends.
Unless you have a consumer CD recorder from a few years ago, you can
record your CD onto any data CD-R. You can find these just about anywhere,
and they can cost as little as $0.10 to $0.15 apiece if you buy in bulk. If you
have an older consumer CD recorder, you have to use music CD-Rs. These
CD-Rs have a code in them that allows older consumer recorders to actually
record. These CD-Rs cost a lot more, not because they capture music any
better, but because a royalty, which is about a dollar and goes to the record-
ing industry, is figured into the price of the CD (don’t get me started).
306
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

So, if you have a recent CD-R recorder connected to your computer or SIAB
system, or if you have a professional-grade CD burner, you can get by just
fine using run-of-the-mill data CD-Rs.
As far as which of the countless CD-R brands to use, they’re all pretty much
the same. I always go with the least expensive. The worst thing that can
happen is that an error occurs and you have to record again. Keep in mind
that some CD-Rs work better on some recorders, and the only way to find out
is to try them. When you find a brand that works, try to stick with it.
Recording Your Music to CD-R
Burning a CD is easy. Just open your CD-burning software and follow the
prompts. A few things, however, can be helpful to know to get the best sound
and to create a CD that you can duplicate. I cover these topics in the follow-
ing sections.
Using different CD recorders
If you’re using a computer-based system, burning a CD is as simple as open-
ing your software and following the program’s directions for making a CD. If
you have an SIAB system, you follow similar procedures, but your UI (user
interface) is going to be much different. If you use a stand-alone burner,
things are going to be even more different.
Some systems, such as computer-based programs, allow you to dither your
mix separately, before you burn your CD. (Dithering is described in the sec-
tion “Preparing for CD,” earlier in this chapter.) I highly recommend this
approach because it gives you a chance to hear the dithered music before
you commit it to disc. If your system doesn’t support this approach (SIAB
system users, take note), make sure that you compare your disc with the
original mix file. (Actually, you should always check your burned CD to make
sure that it plays properly and sounds good.) You’ll hear a slight difference in
sound, but that’s what happens when you go from the 24-bit to the 16-bit
format.
Computer-based systems
If you have a CD burner program, such as Toast, Jam, or CD Creator, burning
your CD is easy. One of the advantages of burning a CD by using one of these
programs is that you have quite a bit of flexibility in organizing your songs
and placing space between them.
307
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

You generally just click the Add Track button on the main screen and select
the track you want to add. You are also prompted to choose any silence that
you want to place before the track as well as PQ subcode information. (A PQ
subcode is additional information added to the CD data that includes start
and stop times for each track, among other things.) When you have all your
tracks assembled, you can burn your CD. Pretty simple, huh?
SIAB systems
Studio-in-a-box systems often contain a CD burner as one of their options.
This can be convenient because you can do everything in the SIAB system,
including preparing your master CD for mass production. On most SIAB sys-
tems, making a CD is pretty easy; the only problem is that you often end up
having to do things differently than with a computer-based or stand-alone
system.
For one thing, you can’t dither your file and check it before you record the
CD. The dithering is done during the burning process. This isn’t a big deal
because you’re going to double-check your finished CD before you send it 
out or sell it, anyway, right?
One thing that you often need to do, however, is assemble and sequence your
songs before you enter the CD-burning program. This can be a lot more work
than doing it in a computer-based system, as the following steps show. Here I
list the procedure for assembling, sequencing, and burning a CD in a Roland
SIAB system (other SIAB systems have similar procedures), just to give you
an idea of the process involved (which can go pretty quickly after you get the
hang of it):
1. Create a new “song.”
This opens a new file for you to put all your mastered songs into. You
end up with a “song” that consists of all the songs on your CD.
2. One by one, import your mastered tracks into the new “song” (follow
the track import procedures for this).
You get to the track import menu by pressing Shift+Track. Next, press
Page once to bring up the Track Import function. Press F5 and follow the
prompts to import a track.
The assembly process works best if you work out the order of the songs
beforehand and import each song in succession.
3. Place the amount of space you want to have between songs, well,
between the songs. Use the Track Insert function to insert the space.
You access the Track Insert function by pressing Shift+Track. Next, press
F5 and follow the prompts to insert space in a track.
308
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

4. Place markers for the beginning of each track.
You do this by pressing Shift+Tap (VS-1680) or Play+Tap (VS-880, 890).
5. Open the CD write menu and choose the “song” file that contains the
sequenced songs and tracks on which you imported these songs.
6. Choose Disc at Once mode and 2x write.
7. Press Enter.
Stand-alone CD burners
A variety of stand-alone CD burners are available, and they all work differ-
ently. Some record the CD the same way that a cassette player records — you
connect the input of the CD recorder to the output of the device that contains
your music and press the Record button on the CD recorder while pressing
the Play button on the device with the music. The CD is recorded in real time.
Other stand-alone CD burners, such as the Alesis Masterlink (the CD-burning
standard for many pro studios), work more like computer software programs
than cassette recorders.
With the Masterlink, you need to first copy the music files from your recorder’s
hard drive to the Masterlink’s hard drive. From there, you can edit, sequence,
and even dynamically process each song before you burn all the songs to a 
CD-R. When you’re happy with the order of the songs and the spacing between
them, you can then burn your CD.
If you want to do dynamic processing to your music in the Masterlink, be
sure to send your files to the machine undithered. You can dither in the
Masterlink after you make your changes. This improves the sound of your
final CD. If you’re only sequencing your songs, you can send the files dithered
if you want.
Burning for mass production
If you intend to send your CD-R to a duplication or replication company to
have it mass produced, keep the following suggestions in mind:
 Check for physical defects to the CD-R before you try to burn to it.
Scratches, fingerprints, smudges, and other imperfections on the mirror
side (bottom) of the CD-R can cause errors in the data. Be sure to use a
clean and unblemished CD-R for burning your master.
 Always write your master CD by using the Disc at Once mode. This
allows the CD to be read as a Red Book audio CD. Your other option
when recording a CD is to use Track at Once. Track at Once burns one
song (track) at a time and produces more errors than Disc at Once,
which burns the entire CD at one time. Because of the errors present on
CDs that are burned using Track at Once, a mass producer’s equipment
309
Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

can’t read — and therefore summarily rejects — CDs that people pro-
duce with this method. (In fact, many older CD players for homes and
cars can’t read these CDs either.) So be sure that you use Disc at Once
whenever you make a CD of your mastered music.
 If you can, use an error-detection software program to check for errors
in your recorded CD. If you don’t have access to an error-detection pro-
gram, check the back of the CD for any blemishes (just like you did before
recording onto it).
 Listen carefully to your entire CD after it’s been recorded. Compare it
with your original file and make sure that the CD is perfect. Also, spend
time reevaluating the order of the songs. Make sure that they flow well
together.
 Use a felt-tip marker to label your finished CD master, not a ballpoint
pen or an adhesive label (paper or plastic). A ballpoint pen can damage
the surface of the CD. Adhesive labels can slow the rotational speed of
the CD and can cause errors in the duplication or replication process.
They have also been known to come off inside a duplication machine,
clogging the works (and irritating your duplication technician).
 Label the CD master with the name of your album and all your contact
info. Use a felt-tip marker, of course, and write on the top (nonmirror
side) of the disc. Your contact information should include your name 
(or your band’s name), your phone number, and the date the master 
was made.
 Make three CD-Rs of your mastered music. Keep one copy safe in your
studio and send two to the duplication or replication company. This
ensures that, if one of the two CDs that you send for mass production
has an error, you don’t waste time sending the company a replacement.
 Prepare a PQ subcode log. PQ subcodes are additional information writ-
ten on the CD that provides time code information, such as track num-
bers and start and stop times of each track. If your CD burner software
doesn’t support PQ subcodes, make a list of the start and stop time of
each track (referenced from the start of the CD) on a separate piece of
paper — as well as the track number and length of each track — and
send it along with your CD masters. If your software program can gener-
ate a PQ subcode log, print it and send it with your CD master.
If you’re burning a CD for a major record label, first of all, congratulations,
and second, you need to supply ISRC codes with your CD. ISRC stands for
International Standard Recording Code, and it contains information about the
CD, such as the owner of the song, country of origin, year of release, and
serial number. You enter ISRC codes into a dialog box on most CD-burning
programs, and the information is placed within the PQ subcodes.

Protecting your rights
Before you put your music out into the world, get it copyrighted. Getting a
copyright on your music is easy and relatively inexpensive, so there’s no
reason not to do it. Just fill out an SR (sound recording) form and send it to
the U.S. Copyright Office at the Library of Congress. You can find the SR form
at www.loc.gov/copyright/forms, or you can call the Copyright Office at
202-707-9100 and ask to have it mailed to you. Choose (or ask for) the Form
SR with Instructions. The current cost for filing the form is $30, but double-
check this fee before you send in your form, because the fee has been known
to go up (hey, it’s the government). You can fill out one form for each CD, so
the cost per song isn’t very high.
The form is pretty easy to fill out, but if you find that you have difficulty, you
can call an information specialist to help you out. The number is 202-707-3000.
Be prepared to wait on hold for a little while (again, it’s the government).
Send your completed form, the fee, and a copy of your CD to the address
listed on the form. You’ll receive a certificate in the mail, but you can con-
sider your music copyrighted as soon as you mail the form (as long as you
sent it to the correct address). If you’re especially protective of your music
(paranoid?), you can wait until your check clears your bank. At this point,
you can be almost certain that your form is being processed. If you can’t
sleep at night unless your music is copyrighted, it’s best to wait until your
certificate arrives in the mail before you start selling or distributing your CD.
(This is a good reason to file for your copyright early.)
Making Multiple Copies
When you have a CD that you want to copy, you can either make the copies
yourself or hire someone to make the copies for you. If you do them yourself,
you have to burn CDs one at a time, just like the first one. This can cost little
but takes a lot of time (as you undoubtedly found out when you burned your
first CD).
Doing it yourself
Well, you’ve done everything else yourself, so why not add the copying
process to the list? If you have more time than money and only need a few
CDs, making them yourself may be a good option.

Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music

To make saleable CDs yourself, you need not only the CD burner but also a
graphics design software program and a printer to print the CD labels and
cover material (the CD sleeve and tray card). Even with this equipment, your
package won’t look as professional as the package that a CD duplication or
replication company can create, but what you create is probably good
enough for you to sell a few copies to your friends and acquaintances.
Having someone else do it
Depending on how many copies you want, you can either have them dupli-
cated or replicated. Either process can provide you with a professional-quality
product that you can sell alongside major releases. Your choice between
duplication and replication depends on how many copies you plan to have
made.
Duplication
Duplication involves making copies of your master CD-R the same way you
made the CD-R in the first place. The only difference is that duplication com-
panies use CD burners that enable them to make more than one copy at a
time. Duplication is great if you want to make a small number of copies —
from 50 to 300. CD-duplication companies often provide one-color printing 
on the CD and either a vinyl sleeve or a jewel case to hold the CD. Some com-
panies can prepare retail-ready packages, which look like other commercial
CDs and include CDs with printing on them, jewel cases with color-printed
inserts, and shrink-wrap. You can expect to pay $3 to $5 for each CD, depend-
ing on the quantity that you order.
An advantage to having your CDs duplicated is that they can usually be done
quickly. Many duplication companies can provide you with a finished product
in as little as a few days (although seven days seems to be the average). The
disadvantage is that you usually pay considerably more for each CD than if
you do it yourself or go the replication route.
To have your CDs duplicated, you need to provide a CD-R master, that is, a
CD-R that was recorded as an audio CD. If you want the duplication company
to create retail-ready packages, you also need to provide artwork that’s laid
out to the company’s specifications.
If you’re interested in going the duplication route, here are a few resources to
get you started. You can also do an Internet search for more places by using
the search term CD duplication.

Most of the companies that I list in the following section also provide duplica-
tion services for smaller quantities.
Replication
Replication is used for making commercial CDs and involves burning a glass
master — the master disc from which all your CD copies will be made — from
your master CD-R. The glass master is then used to transfer the data onto CD
media. Replication is designed for larger runs of 500 or more copies.
Quantities less than 300 aren’t cost effective because the glass master often
costs between $100 and $200, and the film needed to print the CD and sleeve
and tray card can cost several hundred dollars more.
CD replication usually comes with printing on the CD in one to four colors
and a tray card and sleeve that are often printed in four colors. Most CD repli-
cation companies have retail-ready CD package deals that cover everything
from the layout of your artwork (some do and some don’t, so be sure to ask
first) to printed CDs, jewel boxes, and shrink-wrap. You can expect to pay
between $1,200 and $2,000 for 500 to 1,000 copies from most manufacturers.
If you want to go the replication route, you need to provide the replication
company with a master audio CD, artwork set to the company’s specifica-
tions, and a completed order form. Oh, and you probably need to pay half the
money for the job up front before the work can start (bummer).
After people at the manufacturing company receive your order form, the CD,
and artwork, they make a reference CD and proofs of your finished printed
material. Be sure to look over the art proofs carefully and listen to every
second of the reference CD. Any mistakes that you don’t catch are your prob-
lem, so take your time and compare the reference CD very closely with the
master recording. (You did make a copy of your master CD before you sent it
out, right?) The master and the reference CD should be identical.
Having your CD replicated is a stressful thing. You’re spending a ton of money
and getting quite a few copies that you’ll need to be proud enough of to go
out in the world and sell them. So choosing a CD-replication company is an
important task. Quite a few companies are out there, so choose the place that
makes you feel the most comfortable and that makes a high-quality product.
Following is a list of the larger CD-replication companies. For more possibili-
ties, input the terms CD replication or CD duplication in your favorite Internet
search engine.

Puerto Rico.
Many CD-replication companies can provide you with great resources, infor-
mation, and even opportunities for promoting your work. Take advantage of
these opportunities if you can, but don’t choose a company based on its pro-
motional promises. Choose a company because of its customer service,
price, and the quality of its product.
Be sure to ask for referrals — or at least a list of satisfied clients — before
you choose a duplication or replication company. As always, your best bet
when entrusting someone with your precious music is to ask friends for rec-
ommendations. Also, take timing estimates with a grain of salt — I’ve had a
couple of occasions where a company promised to finish my CDs by a certain
date and the company missed its date. So leave plenty of time between when
you print your CDs and when you need them.

UPC bar codes
If you make a CD that you intend to sell through
major retailers, such as music stores or Internet
retailers, you need a UPC bar code. A UPC bar
code is a string of numbers that identify your
product. Every CD has its own unique bar code.
You can get a bar code in one of two ways: reg-
ister with and pay $750 to the Universal Code
Council (UCC) or pay $0 to $50 to a CD replicator
or distributor.
Unless you intend to release more than 35 
CDs, your best bet is to buy a bar code from a
replicator or distributor, who can provide bar
codes for a small (or no) fee with your CD order.
Here are additional places where you can get a
UPC bar code:

 Using the Internet to promote your music
C
ongratulations, you have a CD to sell. The hard . . . oops, I’m sorry . . .
the easy part is behind you. I’m sure that you don’t want to be stuck
with boxes of expensive coasters, so now you have to work on getting people
interested in buying your music. You’ve just gone from being a musician-
composer-engineer-producer to being all those plus a record company
owner-businessperson (exactly how hyphenated can a person get, anyway?).
Your friends and some acquaintances will probably buy a few copies, but after
you’ve sold a CD to all of them, you need to get your music to the broader
world. This can be tricky. After all, you’re now competing with the big boys
and, face it, you don’t have nearly the resources that they do. Traditional
channels of distribution and marketing are pretty much out of the question 
for you. So, to succeed in selling your music, you need to try some alternative
approaches.
In this chapter, you explore a variety of ways to get your music out to the
masses. From basic promotional ideas to Internet distribution, this chapter
covers a lot of ground. You discover how to find Web hosting sites, how to
encode your music for Internet distribution, and how to make a few bucks
from music downloads.

Promoting Your Music
I’m no marketing guru, but I have managed to create a nice niche for myself
and my music. So trust me; you can do the same. All it takes is a little imagi-
nation and a lot of hard work. In the following list, I present a few ideas that
have worked for me and other enterprising, independent artists:
 Take yourself seriously. What I mean by this is take the job of promoting
and selling your music seriously — treat it as a business. Getting people
to notice and buy your music is a lot of work, but it doesn’t have to be a
drag (if it is, you’re better off getting someone else to do it for you).
 Get organized. Get your new business off on the right foot by develop-
ing a habit of keeping track of your sales and developing a contact list.
One of the best investments that you can make is to get a contact man-
agement database (Act! is a good one) to keep track of promotion con-
tacts (newspapers, radio stations, and clubs), CD sales, and fans. Also,
do yourself a big favor and keep meticulous records of your income 
and expenses; you’ll be grateful that you did when tax time comes.
 Create a mailing list. This is one of the most cost-effective and powerful
ways that you can start to develop a following. Make a sign-up sheet for
your mailing list available at every public appearance. (Ask people to
include not only their postal mail address but also their e-mail address.)
Then enter those names into your database. You can then either send
out snail mailings or e-mail notices whenever you play or do anything
worth mentioning.
 Get out and be seen. This one is pretty straightforward. Get out in the
world and let people know about your music. This can mean playing 
gigs or talking about your music. I have a good friend who releases an
album each year. He prints a thousand copies, which he sells at his gigs,
and every year he sells out. (Hey, that’s an extra ten grand a year after
expenses — not bad.) He also uses his albums as his calling card to get
more gigs.
 Look beyond the music store. It’s nearly impossible to compete with
the major labels in the music store. Unless you live in a small town or
know of a music shop that has a section devoted to local bands and can
sell your CDs, you need to think of other places to put your music. For
example, another friend of mine has his CD at quite a few of the local
businesses in his neighborhood around the holidays. Everything, from
the local pack-and-ship to the video store, has a countertop display with
his CD. He creates a small poster that fits on the counter describing him
and his music. He sells quite a few CDs and gets a handful more gigs
each year this way.
316
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 Capitalize on your style. Another one of my friends composes folksy,
New Age music, and he managed to get his CDs into a handful of New
Age, gift-type shops. He often puts them in the stores on consignment
and checks each store once a week to refill the countertop display and
collect money that the store took in (minus the store’s cut, of course).
Going into the stores every week helps him to develop a connection
with the store owners, many of who have arranged for him to do perfor-
mances in their stores, increasing exposure and sales.
 Try something different. Years ago, I teamed up with a local author 
and played at her book signings. (This is before I wrote books myself.)
She read a passage from her book, and then I played for a few minutes. 
I always ended up selling a few dozen CDs at these events.
 Don’t be stingy. Give away your CD. I usually count on giving away
about 10 to 15 percent of the CDs that I print. These can be for reviews,
to try to get gigs, or for any purpose that may spread the word about
your music. Giving out your CD as a promotional tool is an inexpensive
way to let people know what you’re doing.
I’m sure you can come up with dozens more ways to promote and sell your
music. Think outside the box and use your imagination. Don’t be shy. Do
whatever you can to get your music out into the world.
Exploiting the Internet
The tried-and-true approach to playing live and getting exposure still holds
today, but now the Internet has opened some new doors — doors that can
lead you to national and international exposure from your computer room.
You just have to get your music on the Internet and promote it well (easier
said than done, I know). You can then make money from your music while
you sleep (or at least make your music available while you sleep).
“How do I do this?” you may ask. Well, that’s the purpose of the remaining
sections of this chapter. Here you explore the ways that you can use the
Internet to promote and sell your music. You discover how to put up music
files so that your potential customers can either download your music or
listen to it online. You find out about some of the best ways to have your
music hosted online, and you take a look at promotional ideas to get you
started.
Understanding MP3
I’m sure you’ve heard about MP3s. In fact, I’m willing to bet that you’ve
already downloaded a few MP3s from the Internet and experienced firsthand
317
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

the immediacy that MP3s offer. You go to a Web site and choose a song to
download. After just a short while, you have a copy on your hard drive that
you can listen to anytime you want. You can even put that song on a CD or
portable player and take it with you.
With all this convenience and immediacy comes a downside. That MP3 song
doesn’t sound as good as one that was mastered to a CD. For most people,
this is a small price to pay for the ability to download a song for free. After
all, most people play their music on less-then-stellar stereos (Walkmans and
boom boxes come to mind). If you’re one of the lucky few with a stellar (or
more-than-stellar) stereo system, you’re going to hear the difference, which
may prompt the following question: “Why doesn’t a song in MP3 format
sound as good as one mastered to a CD?” The answer: data compression.
MP3 is a process that compresses your music so that it takes up less hard-
drive space. Data compression is necessary for MP3s to work. A regular CD
music file can take up 30–40MB (about 10MB per minute). That same song
can take up only 3–4MB in MP3 format. This is important because, if you’re
going to do any promoting of your music on the Internet, a 30–40MB file is
way too big to download or to stream on the Web. For example, dialup users
with a 28-Kbps modem would have to wait over 4 hours to download a 40MB
file! I don’t know about you, but I don’t know anyone who is willing to wait
that long to hear a piece of music.
Although compression causes your MP3 to lose fidelity as well as megabytes,
I think this loss of quality is an advantage. Because your MP3 doesn’t sound
as good as your mastered CD, you give listeners just a taste of your music. By
giving people this taste, along with the opportunity to purchase a CD, you
help them to decide whether they want to buy the high-quality version.
Engine
When you convert a song on your mastered CD to an MP3 file, the engine is
the encoding algorithm (technical term: number cruncher) that is used to
convert your file. Not all engines make your song sound the same. Some
engines make your song sound much better than others, and you may get a
better-quality sound from an engine if you adjust the bit rate and/or record-
ing mode. Some MP3 encoders allow you to choose the engine that you want
to use, as shown in Figure 17-1, while others don’t.
The standard and arguably best encoding engine is the Fraunhofer algorithm,
although LAME is gaining in popularity. The encoding engine that you choose
depends on the results that you get. You need to try a few engines to decide
what works best for your music and your situation.
318
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Bit rate
The bit rate determines the quality of your encoded music. When you encode
your music, you have to choose your file’s bit rate, as shown in Figure 17-2.
Bit rates range from 20 to 320 Kbps (kilobits per second). The higher the bit
rate, the better the sound quality. The downside is that higher bit rates
create larger files. When you convert your music to MP3 format, you’re con-
stantly balancing quality with file size.

Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
What do you mean near-CD quality?
You may have heard the term near-CD quality
when referring to MP3 sound. This is a market-
ing term that means, “It doesn’t sound as good
as a CD, but we’ll make it sound like it’s pretty
darn close and maybe the buyer won’t notice.”
If you sense a note of cynicism in my writing,
you’re right. Don’t delude yourself into believing
that the song you start with is going to sound the
same after MP3 conversion.
The difference between a song on a CD and a
song that’s near-CD quality is like the difference
between playing a CD in your car and then hear-
ing the same song on the radio. You lose some
high end and the bass is thinner. You may even
lose the stereo image, depending on the con-
version mode you choose, and you definitely
lose some of the dynamic range. Overall, the
song has a little less life to it.
This is not a huge difference for most people, but
is noticeable nonetheless. The good news is that
most people don’t seem to care (or are at least
willing to accept it).

The bit rate that you ultimately choose depends on how you plan to use 
your MP3 file. For example, if you want to put your music on an MP3 host 
site (an Internet site that makes people’s MP3 music available for download),
you most likely need to choose the 128-Kbps rate because this is what many
host sites require for Download or Hi-Fi mode. On the other hand, if you want
to stream audio on the Web, you’re better off choosing a much lower rate
(between 20 and 24 Kbps). Otherwise, your song may pause while it’s playing
(for people with dialup modems anyway).
Variable bit rate (VBR) is an option that many encoders offer. VBR allows 
the encoder to change the bit rate as it compresses the file. The advantage 
to this approach is that sections with fewer instruments or less data can be
compressed further than sections with more critical information. The result
is often a better-sounding MP3 file that takes up less space. The only draw-
back — and it’s a big one — is that few MP3 players can read a file created
with VBR. So, you’re probably better off not using this approach for your
Web-based files.
If you’re making MP3s to listen to through your own player and it supports
VBR playback, using VBR keeps your files smaller. If you do choose VBR, you
are prompted to choose an average bit rate or a minimum and maximum bit
rate. Try them both and choose the one that sounds best to you.
Mode
Modes essentially refer to whether your file is in stereo or mono, only your
choices include more than just plain stereo and mono. You have the option to
choose mono, stereo, joint stereo, or sometimes, force stereo (also known as
dual mono), as shown in Figure 17-3. Again, choose the mode based on your
music and how you prefer to balance quality with file size.
Figure 17-2:

320
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

Here’s a look at the various modes and how they relate to quality and file
size:
 Mono: Mono takes up little room because all the stereo data from your
CD is contained on one track. The sound quality can be good, depending
on the bit rate that you choose, but you lose all stereo-imaging data.
Choose mono mode if the loss of the stereo image won’t adversely affect
your song or if the overall sound quality is more important to you than
the stereo information.
 Stereo: Stereo mode consists of two mono tracks. With stereo mode, 
you retain all your stereo information. The drawback is that your two
tracks are at half the bit rate as the mono one that uses the same bit-rate
setting. For example, if you encode in stereo at 128 Kbps, each of your
tracks is only encoded at 64 Kbps. So, if you want each track to be at 
128 Kbps, you need to encode at 256 Kbps. This creates a file that’s
twice as large as the mono file at 128 Kbps and has the same sound 
quality.
Stereo mode is a good choice if you have a song with complex stereo
panning effects that you just can’t live without and you don’t mind a
sound quality that’s slightly lower.
 Joint Stereo: Joint stereo mode is a cross between mono and stereo.
This mode consists of creating one track of audio information and one
track of information that tells the player to send certain sounds through
one speaker or the other (called steering data). You get most of the
stereo information with only a slightly larger file size than with mono
mode.
Figure 17-3:
MP3
encoders

several
modes from
which you
can choose.
321
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

For most songs, the difference between regular stereo and joint stereo is
indistinguishable as far as the stereo image goes, but you end up with a
higher-quality recording because the higher bit rate is used. You may
find that this option works better for you than the regular stereo mode.
Experiment and see whether you can hear a difference.
 Force Stereo: Force stereo (or dual mono) mode is essentially the same
as the mono mode — one track of audio data is recorded and the stereo
panning information is lost. The only difference between mono and force
stereo is that force stereo makes sure that the mono data is sent through
both speakers of the player. You choose force stereo mode if you don’t
mind your music being in mono but you want to ensure that it plays
through both speakers.
Creating MP3 Files
To create MP3 files, you need MP3 encoding software and a CD or audio file of
your music (well, you need a computer, too). To create an MP3 file of your
music, just choose the song to convert and let the encoder do the rest. Certain
variables can make your MP3s sound their best — such as which encoder you
use and what parameters you choose. I cover these variables in the following
sections.
Choosing encoding software
You have a lot of MP3 encoding software choices. Some software encodes
from various file formats as well as from CD, whereas others don’t encode
directly from a CD. Not being able to encode directly from CD isn’t necessar-
ily a bad thing, however, because the process of lifting music from a CD (also
known as ripping) can cause audible artifacts (noise, clicks and pops, and so
on). If you encode from a WAV or an AIFF file, you can first make sure that the
sound going into the encoding process is as good as possible.
If you get an encoder that doesn’t encode from CD and you use a stand-alone
or SIAB system that doesn’t support file importing (or you don’t have your
recorder connected to a computer), you need CD ripping (copying) software
as well.
A couple of popular MP3 programs that both encode and rip are as follows:
 Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com): You can download the
basic version for free, which allows you to play, rip, burn, and convert
MP3s and audio CDs.
322
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

 N2MP3 (www.proteron.com): This is a Mac-only program, but Proteron
has a Windows version called EasyMP3. You can download trial versions
of these programs for free that allow you to encode MP3s. The trial ver-
sions allow you to encode only 20 MP3s at full length (a maximum of one
minute after that), and they put a voice clip at the beginning that says,
“Encoded by N2MP3” that you can’t get rid of. (Of course, if you buy the
program, these limitations disappear.)
A lot of MP3 encoders are available, so if you’re looking for a little more vari-
ety, check out these sites:
 Shareware.com (www.shareware.com): This site contains shareware 
of all sorts, from games to word processing software to MP3 encoders.
From the main page, just type MP3 into the keyword search function and
choose the computer platform that you use (Mac or PC). You can find a
bunch of matches from your search.
 mp3software.com (www.mp3software.com): This site claims to have the
most complete list of MP3-related software products available for down-
load. You can find freeware and shareware versions in this site.
 MP3 for the Mac (www.mp3-mac.com/Pages/Encoders.html): This site
contains tons of software programs (some free, some not) for Macintosh
computer users. You may find one or more programs that meet your
needs.
If you record using a computer-based system and you use one of the more
full-featured popular programs such as Pro Tools or Logic Audio, you can
probably create MP3 files without getting additional software. Most decent
programs offer this capability.
Encoding your music
The actual encoding process is pretty simple. Just open your MP3 encoding
software and choose the parameters that you want for your file. I can’t list
step-by-step details here — every encoding program is a little bit different —
but keep the following points in mind when you encode your music:
 To ensure that you get the best sound quality possible, encode your
MP3s from a WAV or AIFF file instead of directly from your CD. The
process of ripping a song from a CD can create problems in sound qual-
ity. So, by converting your CD to WAV or AIFF files first, you get a chance
to hear your ripped song and to correct problems that ripping may have
caused before your music goes to MP3.
323
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

 Import your WAV or AIFF file into a sound editor. Sound editor pro-
grams, such as Sound Forge XP, work fine. (You can find sound editors
on the Web sites that I list in the preceding section.) When you have
your file in the editor, use the Maximizer plug-in to raise the overall level
of your song. You lose some dynamics, but they don’t come through
with the MP3 file anyway. If you recorded your music in your computer,
you can use the recording software instead of a separate sound editor to
do this procedure.
 Choose the mono or joint stereo modes for a better sound. The regular
stereo option has a lower resolution (bit rate) and doesn’t sound as
good given the same file size. Choosing the force stereo is fine if your
encoder supports it.
 If you want to put your music on the Web, choose the 128-Kbps bit rate
for downloading and a rate between 20 and 24 Kbps for streaming
audio. (I know I said this earlier in this chapter, but it’s worth repeating.)
If your encoder doesn’t allow such a low bit rate (many of the newer
encoders don’t), choose the lowest option available. This is often 32
Kbps.
 Experiment with different modes and encoding engines. Some sound
better than others on certain types of music.
Hosting Your Music
When you have your music in MP3 format, it’s time to get it out into the
world. This involves either putting it on your own Web site or someone
else’s. The following sections explore the pros and cons of — as well as 
the process involved in — both of these options. Chances are you’ll end 
up choosing a combination approach if you’re serious about selling your
music online.
Choosing a host site
An Internet host site is a Web site that allows you to add your music to its list
of available music downloads. Putting your MP3s on a host site can give you
exposure that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get. You can not only direct
people to the site to listen to your music, but you can also benefit from traffic
that the site itself, other musicians, and the site’s fans generate. For some of
the larger sites, that can be a lot of potential listeners. Although MP3 host
sites are constantly changing, a few have managed to hang around for a
while.

Internet music host sites are always coming and going. To find out what sites
are currently available and what they offer, check out compo10.com/Music
Hosts.htm. This site has a comprehensive list that’s updated regularly.
Be sure to read and understand the contracts (often called agreements) that
each of these sites requires you to agree to. Make sure that you don’t sign
away your rights to your music. If you’re not sure that you like a particular
agreement, don’t sign up for the service. You can find plenty of other places
to put your music on the Internet.
Ampcast
www.ampcast.com/artists/signup.php
Ampcast has been around since 1998 and, as its Web site duly states, “is dedi-
cated to introducing and exposing new musicians and bands as well as pro-
viding a forum for the promotion of more established musical artists.” To join
Ampcast, you pay a $75 annual fee. For this, you can put your music and pic-
tures on its site and get 5 cents for each unique download, that is, the first
download of a song by each person (so you can’t have a friend download
your song a hundred times and get paid for each one).
Ampcast also has a one-off CD program where it creates a CD of your music
for you and makes the CD available on its site. The amount you get from each
CD sale depends on the price you set, but it can range from $1 to $3 or more.
The good thing is that you don’t have to have a CD to sell one on this site —
Ampcast creates it for you.
IUMA
www.iuma.com/ArtistsOnly/
IUMA is the oldest MP3 host site, having been around since 1993, and
Vitaminic.com recently bought it. IUMA’s Web site blurb states that it is “the
one place to post your music where actual musicians are watching out for
you — not weasels watching the numbers. You have your own URL with your
band name first. And a custom Web page where you can post all your band
info and MP3s, sell CDs, create message boards, fan lists, and of course, get
e-mail from your fans — all Free.”
You don’t get paid for downloads from IUMA, but the fact that it costs you
nothing to join easily offsets any disadvantage this may cause. Most bands
don’t earn their fees from downloads anyway. IUMA doesn’t actually sell 
CDs on its site, but it enables you to put links from its site to where you sell
your CDs.

Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

Music.download.com
www.music.download.com
Music.download.com is run by CNET and, as a result of its Internet presence,
it’s one of the most visited music sites online. Music.download.com is free to
put your music on, and the listener can download your music for free. This,
of course, means that you can’t make money from your music on this site
unless a listener follows a link to a separate site where your music can be
purchased. Still, with the exposure that this site can provide, you can hope-
fully get some people to go to another site where you have your music for
sale, such as your own site. Check out the section “Setting up your own site,”
later in this chapter.
Vitaminic.com
www.vitaminic.com
Vitaminic is a European company that operates ten different sites. The
address listed here takes you to the English-language site, where you can join
for free and get exposure through all the sites. Vitaminic claims to have 10
million hits per month from 2 million unique users. Vitaminic doesn’t pay you
for downloads, but it does offer to sell your music from its site. Vitaminic cre-
ates CDs on demand and pays you half of the proceeds from your sales.
Setting up your own site
Even if you put your music on an MP3 site, you should consider creating your
own Web site as well. With your own site, you can provide a lot more informa-
tion for visitors. You can also offer more products that may make you more
money than your CDs — T-shirts for instance.
Having your own Web site is not without challenges. For example, you have
to design and maintain the site, which can take a lot of time. You also have to
pay for things like hosting (granted, you can find places to host your site for
free). If you intend to sell products on your site, you need to provide online
ordering, which often involves setting up a merchant account with a credit
card company. In all, having a Web site can be time consuming and expen-
sive, so be prepared to do a fair amount of work if you really plan on making
money from your Web site.
If maintaining a full e-commerce Web site sounds like too much for you, you
can still make money from the Internet using your Web site to promote your
band, especially if you get creative. In fact, with just a few simple steps, you
can have a Web site without the expense or the hassle (at least less hassle)
326
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

and still provide your visitors with a great Web experience. Here are a few
suggestions:
 Create links from your site to your MP3 host site. This keeps you from
having to put MP3s or streaming audio on your Web site, and your visi-
tors can still hear your music.
 Get your CD on Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) or CD Baby (www.cd
baby.com) and link your visitors to those sites to buy your CD. You
don’t get as much money in your pocket, but these other sites take care
of all the ordering hassle for you. (You find out how to sell your music
through CD Baby and Amazon.com in the section “Selling Your CDs,”
later in this chapter.)
Designing your site
Your first step in getting a Web site up and going is to design it. When you
design your Web site, keep the following points in mind:
 Make your site easy to navigate. Make sure that your visitors know
where they are on your site at all times. It’s often a good idea to have a
menu bar on each page so that they can at least get back to the home
page without having to search for it.
 Make sure that your site loads quickly. Most people still use dialup
modems (often 28-Kbps), and sites with a ton of big graphics or stream-
ing videos take forever to download. Most people don’t have the
patience to wait. Think lean and mean. Your visitors will appreciate it
more than a fancy slow-to-load page.
 Make ordering your CD (or other stuff) easy. Put a Buy My CD icon on
every page.
 Double-check all your links. Nothing is worse for a Web surfer than a
bunch of links that don’t work. If you have links on your site, double-
check that each one works. And if you have links to other people’s sites,
check the links occasionally to make sure that the page you’re linking to
still exists.
 Test your site. Before you sign off on your site design, check it from a
slow modem. You instantly get a sense of whether your site is dialup
friendly. If it’s slow to load or confusing, keep working on it until it
works. You may also want to check your site using different Internet
browsers and screen resolutions to make sure that your site still looks
good.
 Make your site your browser’s home page. I had a site down for weeks
because I didn’t have it set as my default site in my browser. I never
found out until I got a call from a friend who told me it was down.

Pages All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Wiley).
327
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

Putting up your site
After you design your site, you need to find an ISP (Internet service provider)
to host it. Most ISPs allow you to put up a personal Web page for free, but if
you want to do any business from it, you generally need to pay to have your
site hosted. The exception is Geocities (geocities.yahoo.com/home),
which lets you put up a site for free. Geocities also has an inexpensive
domain-hosting option ($8.95 per month), where you can have your name as
your URL (www.jeffstrong.com, for instance).
This leads me to the whole domain name thing, that is, a Web address that
contains your name or your band’s name. If you want your own domain
name, you need to register it and pay a fee. It used to be that all domain
names were purchased through Internic (now Network Solutions), but now
you can get a domain name in a lot of places.
To find a place to buy and register your domain name, search for domain reg-
istration in your favorite Internet search engine. You’ll end up with a ton of
matches to get you started.
After you choose an ISP and register a domain name — if you choose to go
that route — it’s just a matter of putting up your site and making sure that it
works. Your ISP may either give you detailed instructions on how to do this
or do it for you.
Getting noticed
If you set up your own Web site, make sure that you submit it to as many
search engines as you can; otherwise, people may not be able to find you.
You can do this one of the following ways:
 Submit your Web site information to each search-engine site by hand.
This means going to each site, such as Yahoo, and filling out the submis-
sion form.
 Hire a submission service to do this for you. These services enter your
Web site information on hundreds (sometimes thousands) of sites for
you. These businesses charge a fee that ranges from about $40 to $150,
depending on the services and other benefits they offer. The range of
services offered by these companies includes one-time submissions to
repeated submissions, sometimes as often as every 48 hours.
 Buy software to automatically submit your Web site information for
you. The software can cost more than the submission service does, but
with this software, you can submit your information more than once and
be sure that your submission goes through. Some software even tracks
your ranking in the various search engines.
328
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

The major search engines used to include any site for free. All you had to do
was complete a submission form describing your Web site and you were set.
This has changed dramatically over the last year or so. Now, for larger search
engines, such as Yahoo, you need to pay a fee if you’re a commercial site —
that is, if you intend to sell anything. These fees can be quite high ($299 on
Yahoo, for instance).
If your site isn’t a commercial site, you can still list for free, but completing
the submission form may not get you into a search engine’s system. You may
have to submit more than once. Also, keep in mind that it can take a month
or more for your site to show up after you’ve placed your submission.
Providing Your Music Online
If you have a Web site, you probably want your visitors to be able to hear
your music. You can make your music available for listening online in two
ways: by download or by streaming audio. Music downloads are files that
your visitors can download to their hard drives and listen to anytime that
they want. Streaming audio, in contrast, is a file that your visitor connects to
that plays without being copied to your visitor’s hard drive. Each of these
options has its advantages, which I outline in the following sections.
Offering downloads
Online promotion of your music almost requires you to make downloads
available to your potential fans. You can talk about your music all you want,
but what people want is to hear your music. The purpose of the download is
to get your listener to buy your CD or to come see your show.
Put only a few of your best songs on your site (or any site for that matter). If
you make your entire CD available, visitors have no incentive to buy the CD.
Streaming audio
Streaming audio is basically an audio file that begins playing before the entire
file is downloaded. The advantage is that it greatly reduces the amount of
time your listener has to wait to hear your music. The downside is that the
quality of the audio can be lower.
329
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

You always want to make the process of navigating your site and listening to
your music as fast as possible. This provides a much better experience than
having to wait. The less time a person has to wait, the more likely he or she is
to return. The more repeat visitors that you get, the better the chance you
have for selling CDs.
You can create streaming audio in a number of ways, but the two most
common are: a RealAudio file (a file format developed by Real Networks) or
an MP3 file. The process is the same with either method, except that your
filenames are going to be different. Note that you need an encoder that can
create a RealAudio file if you want to go that route.
The following steps walk you through the process of getting your MP3 file to
stream on your site:
1. Create an MP3 file using a bit rate from 20 to 32 Kbps — a good range
for streaming audio when used over dialup modems.
2. Save the MP3 file so that you can identify it.
The easiest way to do this is to save your file as songname24.mp3 (the
24 stands for 24 Kbps).
3. Create a pointer file and name it songname24.m3u.
A pointer file is a file that directs your visitor’s audio player to the song
so that it plays without waiting for the entire song to download. This
file contains directions to your MP3 file. For example, your file would
contain the following text: http://www.YourWebSiteAddress/
songname24.mp3.
Keep in mind that if your visitor doesn’t have an audio player, he can’t
listen to your music. It’s a good idea to put a link on your site to another
site where your listener can download an audio player.
4. Create a hyperlink on your Web page to the songname24.m3u file.
For example, you can put the hyperlink in some text, like this: Check
out our new song, songname; then link the text to the file. Or, you
can place the hyperlink in a picture or graphic (or both).
5. Upload your MP3 file, your pointer file, and the new page with your
hyperlink to your Web site.
6. Go to your Web site and see whether it works.
Make sure that your site-hosting service has its MIME types configured for
MP3. Otherwise, your audio files won’t work. (Don’t worry. The people who
work for your hosting service will know what you’re talking about when you
mention MIME types. That’s their job.)
330
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 

If all this sounds like too much work, you can just create a link to the stream-
ing files on your MP3 host site. This way, people can still hear your music,
even if it isn’t available on your site.
Selling Your CDs
Regardless of whether you have your own site, you can always sell your CDs
on the Internet through other outlets. An advantage to selling your music
through other online stores is that you can capitalize on the traffic that the
store generates. A number of online retailers are out there, but the following
list gives you the lowdown on some of the major players:
 CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com): CD Baby is an online music store that spe-
cializes in independent artists. It puts your CD on its site for a small
setup fee ($35). For this, you get a Web page (which the people at CD
Baby design) with pictures, bios, MP3s, and streaming audio. The site
sells your CD for any price you set, takes 9 percent from the sale, and
gives you the rest. You even receive an e-mail whenever someone buys
one of your CDs. Signing up is easy; just direct your browser to www.
cdbaby.com and click the Sell Your CD icon. The instructions are clear,
and a lot of helpful articles on the site can help you to, well, sell your CD.
 GarageBand.com (www.garageband.com/musicians): GarageBand.com
works in partnership with CD Baby. You just set up a membership with
CD Baby and list your music on GarageBand.com. This gives you more
exposure with no extra expense. GarageBand.com also has some great
information to help you sell more of your music and get gigs.
 Amazon.com (www.amazon.com): Yes, you can get your music on
Amazon.com, boasted as the world’s largest online retailer. Amazon.com
has an Advantage program that allows you to put your CD on its site and
compete with the major-label artists. All you need is a professional CD
(retail-ready) package with a UPC code on it. To join, point your browser
to www.amazon.com and click the Join Advantage link at the bottom of
the page. Follow the directions, and you’ll have your music on the most
prominent online retailer in no time.
Because the Internet is constantly changing and growing, you may find other
sites that allow you to sell your music online. Use your favorite search engine
to search for the phrase sell your CD. This gives you a ton of other places to
consider selling your CD online.
331
Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners

Making the Most of the Web
The whole point of making CDs and putting MP3s of your music on the
Internet is to promote and sell your music. To do this, you need exposure. Like
any promotion technique, there are no rules except to use your imagination.
Experience will be your guide, but here are some ideas to get you started:
 Start an e-mail newsletter. An e-mail newsletter is an inexpensive way to
keep your music on people’s minds. Try to be somewhat consistent in
sending it out, but don’t just send out the same message on a regular
basis. Give your subscribers something. Provide new information in your
e-mail, such as a press release about where you’re playing next or a link
to a new song that you’ve just uploaded. Note: Don’t send your newslet-
ter to anyone who hasn’t asked to receive it. This is called spamming, and
it’s not nice. To build a subscriber list, encourage people to fill in your
mailing list sign-up forms at your gigs and on your Web site. Always pro-
vide a way for them to unsubscribe to your list and make it easy to do so.
 Put your Web site address on everything. People can’t come to you if
they don’t know that you exist. So print your Web site address on all
your promotional materials, including the CD itself. Also, include your
Web site address on all e-mails and Internet correspondence that you
send (for example, as a signature on Internet forums).
 Network. Check out as many independent musician sites as you can.
You not only find out a lot about marketing your music, but you also
have an opportunity to spread the word about your music. Check out
GarageBand.com (www.garageband.com), Getsigned.com (www.get
signed.com), and indiecentre.com (www.indiecentre.com) for
starters.
 Stay up to date. Keep track of where you put your music, and check
back often to make sure that everything is working properly. Web sites
change and go out of business often. Unless you check the site occasion-
ally, you may not know whether your music has disappeared. Also, rou-
tinely search for new places to put your music.
 Get linked. Try to get folks to link from their sites to your own. Likewise,
share the wealth and link to other sites that you like. Cross promotion
can be a good thing and allow you to pool your fan base with another
band. This doesn’t take away from your sales (after all, you listen to
more than one band’s CDs, right?). Visitors to your site will appreciate
the link and will probably check back to see whether you have added
new links.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens is a staple of every For Dummies book.
This Part of Tens contains some information and
resources that you can use every day. Chapter 18 contains
ten great home recording resources as you continue your
search for recording excellence. Chapter 19 provides ten
tips that you can use in your studio to improve the quality
of your recordings.

Chapter 18
Ten Home Recording Resources
In This Chapter
 Finding recording information
 Connecting with other recording enthusiasts
 Improving your recording skills
A
s you can probably figure out from this book, audio recording is a com-
plex subject and one that you can spend a lifetime exploring. Given that,
and given that this book can only contain so much information, I’ve included
this chapter so that you can further your pursuit of audio perfection.
In this chapter, you find ten categories for recording resources that can help
you further your audio-recording knowledge (not to mention your desire 
for more gear — a dangerous thing, I know). I introduce you to magazines,
Internet resources, and recording resources in your own backyard, among
other things.
E-Mail Newsletters
Granted, e-mail newsletters are generally sponsored by music retailers or
magazine publishers who want you to go to their sites and hopefully buy
something. As transparent as newsletters are as a means of trying to get you
to shell out some money, many of the articles included in them are neverthe-
less well written and informative. Dozens of e-mail newsletters on recording
are being published, and more are showing up every month. Here are a few to
get you started:
www.digitalprosound.com
www.prorec.com
www.soundonsound.com
www.taxi.com/transmitter/0504/

Friends
Your friends can be invaluable in helping you discover how to make great
recordings. If you have friends who are musicians, you can often talk them
into playing on your songs or even get them to collaborate with you on some
music. Or, you can record your friends’ music to help you find out more
about recording. After all, the experience you gain from recording other
people can translate into better-sounding music of your own.
Even if your friends aren’t musicians, you can often find out a lot about your
music by letting your friends listen to what you’ve recorded. Getting honest
and encouraging feedback from a nonmusician may help you see your music
more clearly. On the other hand, you sometimes need to be careful about 
letting nonmusicians comment on your work if they are unable to offer 
helpful criticism.
Internet User Groups
A user group is a place where people who are interested in a particular product
(like the Roland V-Studios, for example) can go to discuss problems they may
be having with their systems and to share tricks and tips on how to use the
product. A user group exists for almost every audio-recording product made.
On the Internet, you can find user groups by typing the product name and
user group into your favorite search engine or go to groups.google.com. You
may also find a link to a product’s user group on the manufacturer’s Web site.
User groups can be helpful not only if you own the product and want to share
information about it but also if you want to know whether a particular prod-
uct is a good choice for you to buy. You can generally find out all about a
product’s issues, both good and bad, on these sites.
Internet Forums
Dozens of great Internet forums (message boards) cover audio recording,
both home recording and pro audio recording. You can find many of them by
doing an Internet search for recording forum or home recording forum, but
here are a few great sites to get you started:
www.musicplayer.com
www.audioforums.com
www.vsplanet.com
www.homerecording.com
recordingwebsite.com
www.recording.org

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Local Commercial Studios
Sitting in on a recording session run by an experienced engineer who has the
patience to share his or her techniques can save you hundreds of hours of
trying to figure out things, such as gain staging, mic placement, mixing, and
effects usage. Often the owners or engineers of local recording studios let
you sit in on a session (usually for a fee) and may show you some of the tech-
niques that they use.
You can find these studios by looking in your local yellow pages (under
recording studios), or you can ask around at your local music store for com-
mercial studios in your area.
Local Music and Pro Audio Stores
Your local music or pro audio store can be a great place to meet other people
who are interested in recording. Some stores even have user groups where you
can meet and discuss recording without using the Internet forums. You can
find listings for these stores in your local yellow pages under musical instru-
ment retailers or audio recording sales and service. Also, many manufacturers
tour these stores and often offer free clinics on how to use their products.
Magazines
Magazines can not only keep you informed about recording tips and tech-
niques, but can also let you know about new products and product upgrades.
Even if you don’t read the articles, the ads are enough to provide you with
lots of gear lust. (I apologize in advance for any discomfort this may cause
you.) Several recording magazines are on the market, and the most common
are as follows:
 Home Recording: Home Recording magazine is published nine times per
year. You can find out more about it by calling 800-937-0420 or by going
to www.homerecordingmag.com.
 Recording: Published monthly, Recording magazine can be reached by
calling 800-582-8326 or by sending an e-mail to info@recordingmag.com.
 EQ: EQ is a monthly publication with the addition of a yearly buyer’s
guide issue. You can contact EQ by calling 212-378-0449, by sending 
an e-mail to circulation@uemedia.com, or by visiting its Web site
(www.eqmag.com).
337
Chapter 18: Ten Home Recording Resources

 Electronic Musician: Electronic Musician is published monthly. You can
reach the magazine on the Internet at www.emusician.com or by calling
800-245-2737.
 Pro Audio Review: Pro Audio Review is published monthly. You can sub-
scribe by calling 703-998-7600.
 Mix: Mix magazine is published monthly and can be reached at www.
mixmag.com or by calling 800-843-4086.
Online Articles
You can find articles on the Internet about everything from MIDI to miking
and mixing to effects. You can even sign up for full-length online audio engi-
neering courses. Heck, you can find an article on just about any part of audio
recording on the Internet — often for free.
Finding these articles can be challenging, but here are a few ways you can start:
 Join one of the Internet forums and post a topic asking other members
where they find online articles.
 Go to the home page of the Internet forum or e-mail newsletter. You’ll
often find a few articles worth reading.
 Check out online musical instrument retailers. Many of them post arti-
cles online.
Other People’s Music
You can find out a lot by listening to other people’s music. Good or bad, any
music that you hear is going to show you something about recording, playing
an instrument, or songwriting. Listen to as much music as you can.
Recording Schools
Quite a few professional recording schools operate around the country. The
courses that they offer range from intensive two-week courses on basic engi-
neering skills to a full-blown degree program designed to qualify you for a job
in a commercial studio. If you’re interested in a recording school, you can do
a search on the Internet or try these places:
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Berklee College of Music: Boston, MA. You can find out about the 
program at www.berklee.edu or by calling 800-421-0084.
 The Institute of Audio Research: New York, NY. This school can 
be contacted by calling 212-777-8550 or by visiting its Web site at
www.audioschool.com.
 Recording Institute of Technology: Los Angeles, CA. You can contact
this school at www.mi.edu or by calling 323-462-1384.
 SAE Institute: New York, NY, and Nashville, TN. Online, go to www.
sae.edu. You can also call the school at 212-944-9121 (NY) and
615-244-5848 (TN).
 Los Angeles Recording Workshop: Los Angeles, CA. You can reach this
school by calling 818-763-7400 or by going to www.recordingcareer.com.
 The Recording Workshop: Chillicothe, OH. You can find out about the
Recording Workshop at www.recordingworkshop.com or by calling
800-848-9900.
 Music Tech/College of Contemporary Music and Recording Arts:
Minneapolis, MN. The school’s Internet address is www.musictech.com,
and its phone number is 612-338-0175.
Ask around about the benefit of going to a recording school and you’ll find
some strong opinions. Some people believe that having a certificate from one
of these schools can help you land a job, and others will tell you that you’re
wasting your money. The truth is that the recording industry is changing and
jobs aren’t as plentiful as they used to be (and they weren’t that plentiful
back in the heyday of big-budget recording). So if finding stable and steady
employment in the audio industry is your goal, I recommend that you get a
four-year bachelor’s degree in audio engineering, electrical engineering, or
even business administration over getting an associate’s degree from a trade
school. Even with such a four-year degree, you may end up having to find
work in a related field at some point in your career.

Chapter 19
Ten Invaluable Recording Tips
In This Chapter
 Improving the sound of your recordings
 Making your room look and sound good
 Making edits easier
 Capturing and preserving an artistic performance
T
hroughout this book, I suggest things that you can do to make your record-
ings as good as possible. In this chapter, I present you with more simple
and effective tricks that you can use to improve the quality of your recordings.
You find ways to add more of that sought-after analog sound to your music,
fatten up your tracks (add more depth), and increase the overall feel (artistic
interpretation) of your performances. You also discover a couple of tips to
help you improve the sound of your room, make the editing process easier
and quicker, and double-check your mix before you call your song finished.
Using an Analog Tape Deck
If you have a digital recorder and yearn for that analog sound, you can run
the tracks out of your recorder, into an analog tape deck, and back into the
digital recorder. You can do this for drum tracks or even the final two-track
mix. By blending the tape-saturated tracks back in with the original ones, you
can add as much or as little of the distorted analog sound into your clean dig-
ital tracks as you want and reverse anything that you’ve done later.
This procedure is really simple. Just bus (route) the outputs of your recorder
to the inputs of your analog tape deck, and run cords from the outputs of
your tape deck back into two empty tracks in your digital recorder. You can
then mix these two new tracks with your originals.

A slight time delay (a few milliseconds) occurs between the original tracks
and the returned ones. If you have a graphical editor, you can eliminate this
time delay by following these steps:
1. Choose a single snare drum or bass drum stroke on both sets of tracks.
2. Enter the waveform graphical mode and compare the two waveforms
to see where they differ; you can use your cursor to determine the dis-
tance between the two beats.
See Chapter 13 to find out more on editing.
3. Cut that distance from the front of the tape-returned tracks.
4. Double-check your work by listening to both sets of tracks.
If both beats play at exactly the same time, you’re done. If not, just click
the Undo button and try again.
If you don’t have a waveform editor, you eliminate the time delay by listening.
You can start by picking a time, 20 ms for instance, and deleting it from the
front of the tape deck–enhanced tracks. Listen and make any adjustments
from there. With a little experimenting and a dose of patience, you can find
the right amount to cut. Make a note of this amount because this number will
be the same the next time you do this procedure.
Layering Your Drum Beats
If you use a drum machine or an electronic drum set to play your drum
rhythms, you can make these rhythms much fatter by layering one sound on
top of another. Likewise, you can use this technique to add sampled drum
sounds to your acoustic drum tracks to fatten them as well.
If you recorded your drums using MIDI, just duplicate the drum tracks that
you want to add to, select the drum that you want to duplicate, and change
its patch number to match a sound that you want to add. Depending on your
drum machine’s polyphony, you may need to record the original tracks to
audio before you play the second set of drum sounds. (You can find out more
about using MIDI in Chapter 5.)
If your original tracks are from an acoustic drum set, you have to trigger the
sound from the drum machine by hand (press the trigger pads in time to the
music), or if your audio software has the capabilities (Logic Audio, for exam-
ple), you can create a MIDI file from the audio track. Then just choose the
instruments that you want to have triggered from the new MIDI track.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Decorating Your Room
When you set up your studio, think about the types of materials you use for
furniture, floor, and wall treatments. You can improve the sound of your room
simply by using materials and furniture to absorb or reflect sound. For exam-
ple, you can use a couch to catch some of the room’s reflections or a book-
case placed on the wall behind you to deflect some sound waves. Carpet on
the floor or curtains over your windows absorb sound. In contrast, wood
floors and bare walls add reflections and give your room a more live sound.
If you think about how the furniture and decorations in your studio affect
sound, you can save time and money when you optimize your room for
recording.
Setting a Tempo Map
Before you start to record, set a tempo map of the song within your system.
You do this by entering the number of measures (on some systems), the time
signature, and the tempo for each section of the song in the Tempo Map or
Metronome dialog box in your system. Then, when you record, play to this
metronome.
When it’s time to do your editing, just choose the section(s) of your song that
you want to edit by cueing the measure and beat that you want to work with.
This enables you to choose edit points much faster and more accurately and
makes quick work of producing loops or assembling a song from parts.
Listening to Your Mix in Mono
After all the effort that you put into getting each instrument to sit exactly
where you want it in the stereo field, the last thing you probably want to do is
to listen to the song in mono. Doing so, however, enables you to see your mix
differently and to hear whether any of your instruments are crowding out the
others. Even if you like to have stuff moving in the mix, listening to your song
in mono can help you to find problems in the arrangement.
If it sounds good in mono, it generally sounds great in stereo.

Chapter 19: Ten Invaluable Recording Tips

Doubling and Tripling Your Tracks
If a track sounds thin to you in the mix, just make a copy of it onto an empty
track (if you have one) and use both of them in the mix. Doubling or tripling 
a track is called multing and is especially useful for vocals, particularly
backup vocals.
If you don’t have the tracks to spare, make a copy of the track you want to
mult onto a separate virtual track and then combine those two tracks by
using a bounce procedure, which I explain in Chapter 11. You can do this as
many times as you want with digital recorders because you don’t lose sound
quality in the process. If you want, you can mult dozens of times and end up
with really thick tracks (don’t overdo it though — lots of thick tracks added
together can create a muddy mix).
Tapping the Input of Your Mixer
Tapping the input of your mixer means eliminating the mixer’s circuitry from
the signal. Depending on your mixer, this may provide you with a better sound
going to disk. If you have an analog mixer, you may be able to tap the inputs
when you record. Tapping the inputs involves using a Y cable. The TRS plug
of the Y cable connects to the mixer’s input jack, one of the TS plugs goes to
your preamp, and the other TS plug goes to your recorder. Check your
owner’s manual to see whether you can tap the input of your mixer.
The downside to tapping the inserts on your mixer is that your EQ or fader
doesn’t affect the signal, so make sure that you get the best sound you can
from your instrument and get the levels going into the mixer exactly how you
want them going to tape.
Overdubbing Live Drums
If you’re like most home recordists, you record most of your drum tracks with
a drum machine or electronic drum set. You may find them thin-sounding or
a bit stiff. A good remedy for both the thinness and stiffness can be overdub-
bing (adding separate tracks) some real drums or cymbals to add to the elec-
tronic ones.
For example, you can add real hi-hats to a rock song. Eliminate the drum
machine hi-hats, keep the electronic kick and snare, and play the hi-hat part
to the other drums. In many cases, the variable nature of the hi-hats is what
creates the feel of the drumming. I discuss overdubbing in detail in Chapter 11.
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Pressing Record, Even 
During a Rehearsal
Get your instruments, mics, and levels set before you start to rehearse your
part. Then when you start to practice, press the Record button. You may be
surprised when you catch the perfect performance before you plan to record
a serious take.
Leaving the Humanity in Your Tracks
Along the same lines of recording your rehearsals, don’t be so hooked on 
getting every note just right that you miss the feel of a performance. Listen 
to some of the greatest records ever made and you can hear little mistakes. 
In fact, it’s those little mistakes that often make those records so great. So
before you go autotuning and editing the life out of your music, give it a good
listen and see whether that note you want to fix is what gives the part its
character.
