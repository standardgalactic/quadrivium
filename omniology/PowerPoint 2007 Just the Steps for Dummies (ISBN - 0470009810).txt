W
elcome to Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007. This industry-leading
program has an abundance of tools and commands to satisfy all your
presentation needs. Whether you want to present important material to your
colleagues or clients or just show off your latest travel photos, Microsoft
Office PowerPoint 2007 Just the Steps For Dummies has something for you.
About This Book
This book cuts all the fluff out of a computer book and takes you right to
steps to produce an effect, task, or job. The book is not linear. However, in
some cases, you may need to move around a little to understand one con-
cept before moving to another. Each series of steps is defined with headings
to simplify your task of searching for a specific item and finding similar
tasks related to a particular concept. Be certain to look back at the Table of
Contents when you aren’t certain where to find one task or another.
Whenever you want to get something done with this book, try to discipline
yourself to follow this method:
1.
Pick the task. Glance over the Table of Contents to find a category
you want to explore — something like working with pictures, which
we cover in Chapter 9.
2.
Find it fast. This step is easy because the chapters are designed with
coverage of similar items within each chapter. Look over the subhead-
ings listed in the Table of Contents to find a specific task within a
given chapter.
3.
Get it done. Mimic each step and look at the accompanying figures to
help you thoroughly understand a given task.
Why You Need This Book
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 is one of those programs that many people need
and use, but they often know only enough to get by. What happens when
you want to implement something you haven’t used before, like hyperlinks
or sound? Most programs today don’t come with written documentation
anymore. You’ll probably have to search through skimpy online Help files or,
Conventions used

➟We use the ➪symbol for menu commands.
This arrow tells you to follow the path to
choose a menu command. Something like
“Choose Format➪Background” is our way of
saying “Choose the Background command
from the Format menu.” When you select this
particular menu command, the Background
dialog box opens.
➟Web site addresses appear in a monospace
font to make them easy to identify — for
example — www.dummies.com. Type 
the URL in your Web browser’s Location bar
exactly as you see the monospace type. 
➟To help clarify steps, some figures contain a
circle or callout symbol. Look carefully at each
figure to fully understand what we’re talking
about in the text.
Look for this icon to find tips, notes, and
special points of interest throughout the

Introduction

worse, wade through lots of tedious narrative text in a gigantic
reference manual to find the help you need.
This book eliminates background descriptions and detailed
explanations and takes you directly to a series of steps to pro-
duce precisely what you want to do with a presentation. If you
want it simple, fast, and direct, then this book is for you.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into four parts. The following sections
introduce each one.
Part I: Creating a Presentation
If you’re fairly new to PowerPoint, the chapters in this part get
you up and running. First, you find out how to create a pres-
entation. After your presentation is started, we show you how
to add content from scratch, from Word, and from existing
presentations. You then find the necessary steps on how to
edit and format your content to get just the look you want.
We finish this part by giving you information on working with
the various types of masters in PowerPoint.
Part II: Adding Visual Interest to Slides
After you have a basic presentation, you may want to add ele-
ments to increase visual interest. These comprehensive chap-
ters show you how to do just that. You find out how to add
and edit simple graphics like shapes, lines, and arrows. You
then find steps on how to add embellishments, such as shad-
ows, glows, and 3-D effects, to those shapes and also to text. If
that isn’t enough, you discover how to jazz up your text by
using the WordArt feature. We also give you all the steps you
need to know on how to apply color, texture, and pattern to
your slide elements. Pictures score big with added visual punch.
We show you how to bring in both clip art and photos to your
presentations. Finally, we round out this part by giving you
all you need to create and fully edit tables, and SmartArt
such as charts, organizational charts, and diagrams.
Part III: Adding a Dash of Pizzazz with Multimedia
If text, shapes, and pictures aren’t enough for you, you
may want to explore using sound, movies, and animation
in your presentations. Using multimedia isn’t nearly as
complicated as you may think. We give you the steps to
insert sound and movie files from various sources. You
also find out how to use hyperlinks to jump to other
slides and presentations or to a Web site. To make your
presentation flow smoothly, we show you how to imple-
ment transitions between your slides. And lastly, to make
your presentation really come alive, you find steps on
animating slides, objects, and text.
Part IV: Presenting Effectively
When your presentation is ready, we show you how to
prepare and share it with the world. You find important
information on setting up your show options for opti-
mum performance. We give you the steps on printing
your slides, handouts, and notes for your audience. You
find out how to package your presentation on CD and
how to hold an online presentation meeting. We also
give you the lowdown on how to save a presentation in
the new XML Paper Specification format. Finally, you dis-
cover how to give a presentation live or via a kiosk.
Get Ready To . . .
Glance over the Table of Contents to locate the task you
want to perform in Microsoft Office PowerPoint. You
don’t need to grasp any background information; just
jump into the series of steps that defines a solution for a
project you want to complete.

Getting Started
with PowerPoint
T
he first step of any journey through PowerPoint is to start up the 
program and either create a new presentation or open an existing pres-
entation. Obviously, you can’t do anything in PowerPoint until you launch
the program.
In this chapter, we talk about some methods you can use to launch PowerPoint
and how you can immediately begin to create a new presentation. We also
show you how to save a presentation after you’ve created it and safely exit
the program.
Note that, at this point, we assume that you have installed either the entire
Microsoft Office 2007 suite or just Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007. 
If you need to perform an installation, refer to the user documentation
accompanying your installer CD for installation instructions.

Customizing 
the PowerPoint
Interface
P
owerPoint offers you much flexibility in customizing your work envi-
ronment to suit your own personal editing needs. You can organize
toolbars, open frequently used toolbars, and add commands to toolbars.
All these options are available so that you can create a work environment
that accommodates your slide-creation needs.
In addition to customizing the PowerPoint interface, we tossed in a little
information on accessing help documents. After you get a handle on creating
a blank presentation — the stuff we discuss in Chapter 1 — things can get a
little complicated. Fortunately, PowerPoint offers you help every step along
the way as you create your presentations.

Building Your
Presentation and
Adding Content
A
n outliner, among other things, makes PowerPoint the ideal presenta-
tion program. By importing text from a Microsoft Word document or
typing text directly in PowerPoint in outline form, you can quickly apply
text to slides when preparing a presentation. You can select a design tem-
plate, type an outline, and finish your presentation within record time.
When modifying a presentation is necessary, PowerPoint provides you
options for rearranging slides, text on slides, and slide designs without
spending time creating new documents.
In this chapter, you find out how to use PowerPoint’s outliner feature,
assemble quick and easy presentations, and modify your presentation
designs.

• Date And Time: Check the box, choose a date/time
format, and click Update Automatically to make a
choice from the drop-down menu.
If you don’t select the Update Automatically radio button, the drop-
down menu is inaccessible, and PowerPoint assumes that you want
to add your own fixed date format by clicking Fixed and adding a
date to the text box below the Fixed radio button.
• Update Automatically: Check the radio button to
update the current date each time the presentation is
opened.
• Fixed: Click the Fixed radio button and type a date/
time in the text box.
When you include a date and time in your slide show, the date/time
is derived from your system clock. When you add a fixed date/time,
you can add any date/time value you desire in the text box, and that
date remains fixed no matter when the presentation is opened.

aster slides give you options for globally changing the design of your
presentations. With a quick reorganization and formatting for text —
or a change in the graphic images on a master slide — you can apply
changes to all slides in your presentation in a matter of minutes.
PowerPoint provides you with many different master slides that you can
duplicate, revise, and create new masters. The slide master affects the design
of your presentation. The note master and handout master handle the
designs for notes and handouts.
In this chapter, you find out how to edit and change all master slides and

I
f a picture is what you want to use to communicate a message, then
PowerPoint’s drawing options are your ticket to creating graphic represen-
tations of ideas and concepts. Using drawing tools and AutoShapes, you can
create visual messages utilizing free-form drawing tools and predefined
shapes.
With the ease of drawing lines and geometric shapes or selecting graphic
objects from a number of different pop-up menus, you can quickly assemble
a diagram or drawing to illustrate your point. In this chapter, you find out
how to use the many different tools in PowerPoint to create graphic objects
and images.

Click the Text Box button on the Insert tab and drag
open a rectangle to create a text placeholder. Repeat,
adding text placeholders as needed, and type the text to
describe the street names (see Figure 7-18).
As an alternative to creating duplicate sets of lines, you can change
the Format Shape of lines to a compound type of line style. Open
the Format Shape dialog box after creating a line and click Line
Style in the left pane. Open the Compound Type drop-down menu
in the right pane and select a line style that appears similar to the
lines drawn in this exercise. The advantage of this method is that
you can create a map-type drawing much faster. The disadvantages
are that you have no control over the line width on the edges, and
you can’t create intersections with the same appearances as
described in the preceding steps.

Applying Themes 
and Styles
C
olor is an important element in communication. Each color has an
inherent “personality” and can evoke emotion and action. Certain col-
ors also have been historically associated with certain products, industries,
and even messages. The colors you choose and the way you combine colors
can have an effect on your presentation and how your audience perceives it.
You want to ensure that your color choices are never arbitrary but, instead,
are well thought-out.
Fortunately, PowerPoint makes choosing and using color simple. If you’re not
particularly color or graphically savvy, you can rest assured that PowerPoint’s
predefined themes are well designed. If you’re feeling more creative, defining
your own colors is easy. And if you decide color isn’t enough, you also have
the ability to add textures and patterns to your background and graphic ele-
ments. This chapter gives you the know-how to work with all three.

Working with Pictures
T
he old adage, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” is certainly true
when it comes to presentations. Visually conveying information with
images rather than words is often quicker, has more impact, and is more
interesting.
Working with pictures in PowerPoint is easy. You can import a variety of
file types, such as photos you’ve scanned or shot with your digital camera.
You can also import clip art and photographs from stock agencies. Or you
can just use the multitude of art available within PowerPoint’s libraries,
which include thousands pieces of clip art, photos, animations, and sounds.
After you’ve chosen a picture, you can easily modify its size, position, and
even contrast and color to suit your needs. This chapter gives you all the
information necessary to work with pictures of all sorts.

In the Search For box, enter a keyword that describes the
art you’re looking for.
5.
In the Search In box, select the collections from the
drop-down list that you want PowerPoint to search in for
your art. You can choose Everywhere (all collections),
My Collections (clips you’ve stored on your hard drive),
Office Collections (clips that are part of the Office
suite), and Web Collections (clips located on the Web).
6.
In the Results Should Be box, select your desired media
type from the drop-down list. Choose from All Media
Types, Clip Art, Photographs, Movies, and Sounds. For
specific file formats under each media type, click the
plus sign to expand the directory.
7.
Click the Go button.
8.
In the Results box, click the thumbnail of your desired
clip. It is then inserted into your slide, as shown in
Figure 9-1. To find similar clips (if the clip has a defined
style), click the down arrow on the right of the clip and
select Find Similar Style from the pop-up list. Note that
you can also insert, copy, or delete clips from this pop-
up list.
Figure 9-1: Insert clip art into your slide
Click Organize Clips at the bottom of the Clip Art task pane to add,
rearrange, or delete clips from your collections.
For search keywords, you can also enter all or part of the filename of
the art. If you don’t know the exact name, you can use a question mark
to substitute for a single character in a name or use an asterisk to sub-
stitute for multiple characters in the name. If you type two words, such
as yellow leaves, in the Search For box, PowerPoint searches for clips
using the keywords yellow and leaves. If you type two words enclosed
by quotation marks, such as “yellow leaves,” the program searches for
clips that contain the phrase yellow leaves. And if you type in two words
separated by a comma, such as yellow, leaves, PowerPoint searches for
clips with the keywords yellow or leaves.
The Clip Organizer holds your clips. Clips include clip art, photos, sounds,
and videos. In addition to the Office clips that automatically reside in the
Clip Organizer, you can access Office clips on the Web. You can also
import and store your own clips in the Clip Organizer. Use this powerful
tool to organize, find, and insert your clips.

Creating Tables 
and Charts
D
ata is often grasped more quickly and with more understanding and
impact when it’s presented in a simple, organized, and visual way.
In PowerPoint, tables and charts are a couple of ways to effectively present
data, especially quantitative, complex, or tedious data. This chapter describes
the powerful options within PowerPoint to work with charts and tables.
You can create tables and charts from scratch within PowerPoint or import
them from Microsoft Word or Excel.
After you enter your data into a table or chart, PowerPoint provides the 
ability to change virtually all the elements, from modifying a table’s font,
columns and rows, borders, and shading to adding effects. You can even
insert your favorite picture in a table cell. If you’ve created one of the many
types of charts, PowerPoint provides the ability to alter almost all the chart
objects by modifying a chart’s type, font, axis, grid, borders, shading, labels,
legend, and effects.

Creating
Organizational 
Charts and Diagrams
using SmartArt
S
ometimes, trying to figure out who reports to whom and who is respon-
sible for what area can be downright confusing, especially in large 
corporations with multiple divisions, locations, and product lines. Rather
than using running lists of people’s names, titles, and responsibilities, it’s
more effective to use organizational charts. Org charts, as they’re called in
corporate circles, graphically display how a corporate hierarchy is structured.
Viewers can quickly see how the company is organized — either by person-
nel, by function, by product, or by location. Not the corporate type? Well,
organizational-type charts can also be used to display family trees, biological
classifications, and other types of hierarchical information. Similarly, dia-
grams also offer a visual solution to presenting complicated data, especially
data such as processes, workflow, relationships, and causes and effects.
Like tables and graphs, organization charts and diagrams provide important
but complex and sometimes tedious information visually, making it easier
and quicker for the viewer to comprehend. And with Microsoft Office 2007’s
new SmartArt feature, creating these charts and diagrams has never been eas-
ier. This chapter covers everything you need to know to create both effective
and attractive org charts and diagrams.

Integrating Sound
and Movies
I
f photos and illustrations add icing to your presentations, then sound
and movies are the proverbial cherry on top. You can really grab the
attention of your audience by adding audio and video elements to your
presentation. What’s great is that it’s easy to do. A couple of menu com-
mands are all it takes to integrate sound and movies into your slide show.
If you’re short on content, PowerPoint offers quite a few media clips in its
library. Music can also be imported from your own CDs or from MP3 files
you have created or purchased online. Many stock photo Web sites also offer
reasonably priced audio and video clips. In addition to video, you can add
animated GIFs to your presentations. Animated GIFs have small file sizes
and can be very effective in demonstrating a sequence.
This chapter gives you the scoop on how to integrate sound and movies into
your presentations and really bring them to life.

click the sound icon.
7.
To test the sound quality, double-click the sound icon
on your slide. If you are in a Slide Show view, a single
click will do it.
PowerPoint accepts the following sound file formats: WAV, WV, MP3,
MPEG-4, Audio, AIF, AIFF, AIFC, MIDI, MID, KAR, MOV, MOOV, SFIL,
RSRC, ALAW, AU, SND, and ULAW.
Only a .wav (Waveform Audio Format) can be embedded in your
presentation. Note that by default, all .wav files larger than 100 KB
are linked rather than embedded. You can increase the size of an
embedded file up to a max of 50 MB, but you may suffer a per-
formance slowdown. (See the section “Edit Movie and Sound
Options,” later in this chapter, for details.) All other formats are
linked to your presentation, so be sure to include the links with your
presentation by saving it as a PowerPoint Package.
You can also play a sound across multiple slides. (See the upcoming sec-
tion “Edit Movie and Sound Options” for details.)

You may think a basic office program such as PowerPoint is incapable of
adding any snap, crackle, and pop to your presentations. Think again.
Underneath PowerPoint’s conservative attire lies a whole bevy of special
effects that you can apply to your slides. If you need to jump to a Web site
or to another file or presentation during your slide show, you simply insert a
hyperlink. Advancing from one slide to the next can be elegant and unobtru-
sive with slow fades, or dynamic and active with wipes and spins. With this
chapter’s help, your presentations will be snapping, crackling, and popping
to their heart’s content!

Animation
I
f the previous chapter on hyperlinks and transitions doesn’t add enough
pizzazz to your presentations, you may want to step it up a bit and
employ custom animations to the elements on your slides. You can easily
have your text fly in from the left and then hide or change color after it has
played. Or you can create a custom motion path and have your object fol-
low a map on your slide. If motion isn’t enough, you can easily attach
sounds, such as camera clicks or voltage zaps, to your animations.
This chapter shows you how to employ animation for added emphasis and
impact in your presentations.

Preparing the
Presentation
A
fter you’ve done all the hard work of compiling and formatting the
content of your presentation, it’s time to get it ready to share with the
world. Begin by specifying the display options for your show. Determine
how your show will be presented. Will a speaker control it, or will it be self-
running on a kiosk? Choose whether your show will loop continuously and
whether it will include narration and animation. Establish your timings and
optimize your display performance.
When your show is ready to go, print your outline and all your notes and
handouts. And last but not least, be sure to make a backup of your hard-
earned presentation by packaging it to a CD. You want to be prepared if
your original presentation stored on the computer’s hard drive goes awry.

Sharing Your
Presentation
W
hat good is a wonderful presentation if you don’t share it with the
world? PowerPoint offers you many ways to share. You can take
the traditional and most personal route and present the show yourself
(or choose a designated live body). If you’re short on manpower or want
to free up people for other tasks, you can present a self-running show. 
If you need feedback on a presentation, PowerPoint has a great system
of sending a presentation out for review. 
Need to collaborate? PowerPoint also provides a way, with the help of
Microsoft Meeting Space, to hold online meetings. Finally, you can take the
more technical route and share your presentation online via the Internet.
This approach is a great way to disseminate information to a large audience
or to people who are located in geographically diverse locations. This chap-
ter gives you all you need to know to finalize your show and then share it
with others.

or that you can hyperlink to. This can come in handy if you need to
make presentations to several different groups within an organization.
For example, everyone might need to view the main presentation,
but you can create custom shows to present to individual groups
that have slightly different needs.
Figure 16-3: Click Show to preview the new 
custom show
Figure 16-4: Define a custom show
To present a custom show, click Slide Show in the Ribbon and click Custom
Slide Show to open the drop-down menu. From the menu choices,
choose your custom slide show.
For details on hyperlinking to your custom show, see Chapter 13.
