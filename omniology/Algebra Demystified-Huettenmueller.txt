PREFACE
This book is designed to take the mystery out of algebra. Each section con-
tains exactly one new idea—unlike most math books, which cover several
ideas at once. Clear, brief explanations are followed by detailed examples.
Each section ends with a few Practice problems, most similar to the examples.
Solutions to the Practice problems are also given in great detail. The goal is
to help you understand the algebra concepts while building your skills and
conﬁdence.
Each chapter ends with a Chapter Review, a multiple-choice test designed
to measure your mastery of the material. The Chapter Review could also be
used as a pretest. If you think you understand the material in a chapter, take
the Chapter Review test. If you answer all of the questions correctly, then
you can safely skip that chapter. When taking any multiple-choice test, work
the problems before looking at the answers. Sometimes incorrect answers
look reasonable and can throw you oﬀ. Once you have ﬁnished the book,
take the Final Review, which is a multiple-choice test based on material from
each chapter.
Spend as much time in each section as you need. Try not to rush, but do
make a commitment to learning on a schedule. If you ﬁnd a concept diﬃcult,
you might need to work the problems and examples several times. Try not to
jump around from section to section as most sections extend topics from
previous sections.
Not many shortcuts are used in this book. Does that mean you shouldn’t
use them? No. What you should do is try to ﬁnd the shortcuts yourself. Once
you have found a method that seems to be a shortcut, try to ﬁgure out why it
works. If you understand how a shortcut works, you are less likely to use it
incorrectly (a common problem with algebra students).
Because many ﬁnd fraction arithmetic diﬃcult, the ﬁrst chapter is devoted
almost exclusively to fractions. Make sure you understand the steps in this
chapter because they are the same steps used in much of the rest of the book.
For example, the steps used to compute
7
36 þ 5
16 are exactly those used to
compute
2x
x2 þ x  2 þ
6
x þ 2.

Even those who ﬁnd algebra easy are stumped by word problems (also
called ‘‘applications’’). In this book, word problems are treated very care-
fully. Two important skills needed to solve word problems are discussed
earlier than the word problems themselves. First, you will learn how to
ﬁnd quantitative relationships in word problems and how to represent
them using variables. Second, you will learn how to represent multiple quan-
tities using only one variable.
Most application problems come in ‘‘families’’—distance problems, work
problems, mixture problems, coin problems, and geometry problems, to
name a few. As in the rest of the book, exactly one topic is covered in
each section. If you take one section at a time and really make sure you
understand why the steps work, you will ﬁnd yourself able to solve a great
many applied problems—even those not covered in this book.
Good luck.

CHAPTER 1
Fractions
Fraction Multiplication
Multiplication of fractions is the easiest of all fraction operations. All you
have to do is multiply straight across—multiply the numerators (the top
numbers) and the denominators (the bottom numbers).

Multiplying Fractions and Whole Numbers
You can multiply fractions by whole numbers in one of two ways:
1.
The numerator of the product will be the whole number times the
fraction’s numerator, and the denominator will be the fraction’s
denominator.
2.
Treat the whole number as a fraction—the whole number over
one—then multiply as you would any two fractions.

Fraction Division
Fraction division is almost as easy as fraction multiplication. Invert (switch
the numerator and denominator) the second fraction and the fraction divi-
sion problem becomes a fraction multiplication problem.

Reducing Fractions
When working with fractions, you are usually asked to ‘‘reduce the fraction
to lowest terms’’ or to ‘‘write the fraction in lowest terms’’ or to ‘‘reduce the
fraction.’’ These phrases mean that the numerator and denominator have no
common factors.
For example, 2
3 is reduced to lowest terms but 4
6 is not.
Reducing fractions is like fraction multiplication in reverse. We will ﬁrst use
the most basic approach to reducing fractions. In the next section, we will
learn a quicker method.
First write the numerator and denominator as a product of prime
numbers.
Refer to the Appendix if you need to review how to ﬁnd the
prime factorization of a number. Next collect the primes common to both
the numerator and denominator (if any) at beginning of each fraction. Split
each fraction into two fractions, the ﬁrst with the common primes. Now the
fraction is in the form of ‘‘1’’ times another fraction.

Fortunately there is a less tedious method for reducing fractions to their
lowest terms.
Find the largest number that divides both the numerator
and the denominator.
This number is called the greatest common divisor
(GCD) . Factor the GCD from the numerator and denominator and rewrite
the fraction. In the previous examples and practice problems, the product of
the common primes was the GCD.

When the denominators are not the same, you have to rewrite the fractions so
that they do have the same denominator. There are two common methods of
doing this. The ﬁrst is the easiest. The second takes more eﬀort but can
result in smaller quantities and less reducing. (When the denominators have
no common divisors, these two methods are the same.)
The easiest way to get a common denominator is to multiply the ﬁrst
fraction by the second denominator over itself and the second fraction by
the ﬁrst denominator over itself.
Examples
In 1
2 þ 3
7 the ﬁrst denominator is 2 and the second denominator is 7.

Our goal is to add/subtract two fractions with the same denominator. In the
previous examples and practice problems, we found a common denominator.
Now we will ﬁnd the least common denominator (LCD). For example in
1
3 þ 1
6, we could compute

While 18 is a common denominator in the above example, 6 is the smallest
common denominator. When denominators get more complicated, either by
being large or having variables in them, you will ﬁnd it easier to use the LCD
to add or subtract fractions. The solution might require less reducing, too.
In the following practice problems one of the denominators will be the
LCD; you only need to rewrite the other.

There are a couple of ways of ﬁnding the LCD. Take for example 1
12 þ 9
14. We
could list the multiples of 12 and 14—the ﬁrst number that appears on each
list will be the LCD:
12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84.
Because 84 is the ﬁrst number on each list, 84 is the LCD for 1
12 and 9
14. This
method works ﬁne as long as your lists are not too long. But what if your
denominators are 6 and 291?
The LCD for these denominators (which is
582) occurs 97th on the list of multiples of 6.
We can use the prime factors of the denominators to ﬁnd the LCD more
eﬃciently. The LCD will consist of every prime factor in each denominator
(at its most frequent occurrence). To ﬁnd the LCD for 1
12 and 9
14 factor 12 and
14 into their prime factorizations: 12 ¼ 2  2  3 and 14 = 2  7. There are two
2s and one 3 in the prime factorization of 12, so the LCD will have two 2s
and one 3.
There is one 2 in the prime factorization of 14, but this 2 is
covered by the 2s from 12. There is one 7 in the prime factorization of 14, so
the LCD will also have a 7 as a factor. Once you have computed the LCD,
divide the LCD by each denominator. Multiply each fraction by this number
over itself.

Adding More than Two Fractions
Finding the LCD for three or more fractions is pretty much the same as
ﬁnding the LCD for two fractions.
Factor each denominator into its
prime factorization and list the primes that appear in each.
Divide the
LCD by each denominator.
Multiply each fraction by this number over
itself.

Whole Number-Fraction Arithmetic
A whole number can be written as a fraction whose denominator is 1. With
this in mind, we can see that addition and subtraction of whole numbers and
fractions are nothing new. To add a whole number to a fraction, multiply
the whole number by the fraction’s denominator. Add this product to the
fraction’s numerator. The sum will be the new numerator.

Subtract the fraction’s numerator from this

Compound Fractions
Remember what a fraction is—the division of the numerator by the
denominator. For example, 15
3 is another way of saying ‘‘15  3.’’ A com-
pound fraction, a fraction where the numerator or denominator or both are
not whole numbers, is merely a fraction division problem. For this reason
this section is almost the same as the section on fraction division.

Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions
An improper fraction is a fraction whose numerator is larger than its
denominator.
For example, 6
5 is an improper fraction.
A mixed number
consists of the sum of a whole number and a fraction.
For example 11
5
(which is really 1 þ 1
5) is a mixed number. We will practice going back and
forth between the two forms.
To convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, ﬁrst multiply the
whole number by the fraction’s denominator.
Next add this to the
numerator. The sum is the new numerator.

Mixed Number Arithmetic
You can add (or subtract) two mixed numbers in one of two ways. One way
is to add the whole numbers then add the fractions.

Recognizing Quantities and Relationships in
Word Problems
Success in solving word problems depends on the mastery of three skills—
‘‘translating’’ English into mathematics, setting the variable equal to an
appropriate unknown quantity, and using knowledge of mathematics to
solve the equation or inequality. This book will help you develop the ﬁrst
two skills and some attention will be given to the third.
English
Mathematical Symbol
‘‘Is,’’ ‘‘are,’’ ‘‘will be’’ (any form of the verb ‘‘to be’’)
mean ‘‘equal’’
¼
‘‘More than,’’ ‘‘increased by,’’ ‘‘sum of’’ mean ‘‘add’’
þ
‘‘Less than,’’ ‘‘decreased by,’’ ‘‘diﬀerence of’’ mean
‘‘subtract’’

‘‘Of’’ means ‘‘multiply’’

‘‘Per’’ means ‘‘divide’’

‘‘More than’’ and ‘‘greater than’’ both mean the rela-
tion ‘‘greater than’’ although ‘‘more than’’ can mean
‘‘add’’
>
‘‘Less than,’’ means the relation ‘‘less than’’ although
it can also mean ‘‘subtract’’

CHAPTER 2
Introduction to
Variables
A variable is a symbol for a number whose value is unknown. A variable
might represent quantities at diﬀerent times. For example if you are paid by
the hour for your job and you earn $10 per hour, letting x represent the
number of hours worked would allow you to write your earnings as ‘‘10x.’’
The value of your earnings varies depending on the number of hours worked.
If an equation has one variable, we can use algebra to determine what value
the variable is representing.
Variables are treated like numbers because they are numbers. For instance
2 þ x means two plus the quantity x and 2x means two times the quantity x
(when no operation sign is given, the operation is assumed to be
multiplication).
The expression 3x þ 4 means three times x plus four.
This is not the same as 3x þ 4x which is three x’s plus four x’s for a total
of seven x’s: 3x þ 4x ¼ 7x.
If you are working with variables and want to check whether the expression
you have computed is really equal to the expression with which you started,
take some larger prime number, not a factor of anything else in the expression,
and plug it into both the original expression and the last one. If the resulting
numbers are the same, it is very likely that the ﬁrst and last expressions are
equal. For example you might ask ‘‘Is it true that 3x þ 4 ¼ 7x?’’ Test x ¼ 23:
37

3ð23Þ þ 4 ¼ 73 and 7ð23Þ ¼ 161, so we can conclude that in general
3x þ 4 6¼ 7x. (Actually for x ¼ 1, and only x ¼ 1, they are equal.)
This method for checking equality of algebraic expressions is not
foolproof.
Equal numbers do not always guarantee that the expressions
are equal. Also be careful not to make an arithmetic error. The two expres-
sions might be equal but making an arithmetic error might lead you to
conclude that they are not equal.
Canceling with Variables
Variables can be canceled in fractions just as whole numbers can be.
Examples
2x
x ¼ 2
1  x
x ¼ 2
6x
9x ¼ 6
9  x
x ¼ 6
9 ¼ 2
3
7xy
5x ¼ 7y
5  x
x ¼ 7y
5
When you see a plus or minus sign in a fraction, be very careful when you
cancel. For example in the expression 2 þ x
x
, x cannot be canceled. The only
quantities that can be canceled are factors. Many students mistakenly ‘‘can-
cel’’ the x and conclude that 2 þ x
x
¼ 2 þ 1
1
¼ 3 or 2 þ x
x
¼ 2. These equations
are false. If 2 þ x
x
were equal to 2 or to 3, then we could substitute any value
for x (except for 0) and we would get a true equation. Let’s try x = 19:
2 þ 19
19
¼ 21
19.
We can see that 2 þ x
x
6¼ 2 and 2 þ x
x
6¼ 3. The reason that the x cannot be
factored is that x is a term in this expression, not a factor.
(A term is a
quantity separated from others by a plus or minus sign.) If you must cancel
the x out of 2 þ x
x
, you must rewrite the fraction:
CHAPTER 2
Introduction to Variables
38

2 þ x
x
¼ 2
x þ x
x ¼ 2
x þ 1:
Simply because a plus or minus sign appears in a fraction does not auto-
matically mean that canceling is not appropriate.
For instance 3 þ x
3 þ x ¼ 1
because any nonzero quantity divided by itself is one.
Examples
ð2 þ 3xÞðx  1Þ
2 þ 3x
¼ 2 þ 3x
2 þ 3x  x  1
1
¼ x  1:
The reason 2 + 3x can be canceled is that 2 + 3x is a factor of
(2 + 3x)(x  1).

At times, especially in calculus, you might need to write a fraction as a
product of two fractions or of one fraction and a whole number or of
one fraction and a variable.
The steps you will follow are the same as
in multiplying fractions—only in reverse.

Fraction Division and Compound Fractions
Division of fractions with variables can become multiplication of fractions by
inverting the second fraction. Because compound fractions are really only
fraction division problems, rewrite the compound fraction as fraction divi-
sion then as fraction multiplication.

Word Problems
Often the equations used to solve word problems should have only one
variable, and other unknowns must be written in terms of one variable.
The goal of this section is to get you acquainted with setting your variable
equal to an appropriate unknown quantity, and writing other unknown
quantities in terms of the variable.
Examples
Andrea is twice as old as Sarah.
Because Andrea’s age is being compared to Sarah’s, the easiest thing to
do is to let x represent Sarah’s age:
Let x ¼ Sarah’s age.
Andrea is twice as old as Sarah, so Andrea’s age ¼ 2x. We could have
let x represent Andrea’s age, but we would have to re-think the state-
ment as ‘‘Sarah is half as old as Andrea.’’ This would mean Sarah’s age
would be represented by 1
2 x.
John has eight more nickels than Larry has.
The number of John’s nickels is being compared to the number of
Larry’s nickels, so it is easier to let x represent the number of nickels
Larry has.
Let x ¼ the number of nickels Larry has.
x þ 8 ¼ the number of nickels John has.

3 x ¼ Jack’s height (in the given units)
From 6 pm to 6 am the temperature dropped 30 degrees.
Let x = temperature (in degrees) at 6 pm.
x  30 ¼ temperature (in degrees) at 6 am
One-eighth of an employee’s time is spent cleaning his work station.
Let x ¼ the number of hours he is on the job.
1
8 x ¼ the number of hours he spends cleaning his work station
$10,000 was deposited between two savings accounts, Account A and
Account B.
Let x ¼ amount deposited in Account A.
How much is left to represent the amount invested in Account B? If x
dollars is taken from $10,000, then it must be that 10,000  x dollars is
left to be deposited in Account B.
Or if x represents the amount deposited in Account B, then 10,000  x
dollars is left to be deposited in Account A.
A wire is cut into three pieces of unequal length. The shortest piece is

A store is having a one-third oﬀsale on a certain model of air con-
ditioner.
Let x ¼ regular price of the air conditioner. Then 2
3 x ¼ sale price of the
air conditioner.
We cannot say that the sale price is x  1
3 because 1
3 is not ‘‘one-third oﬀ
the price of the air conditioner;’’ it is simply ‘‘one-third.’’ ‘‘One-third
the price of the air conditioner’’ is represented by 1

CHAPTER 3
Decimals
A decimal number is a fraction in disguise: 0:48 ¼ 48
100 and 1:291 ¼ 1 291
1000 or
1291
1000. The number in front of the decimal point is the whole number (if there
is one) and the number behind the decimal point is the numerator of a
fraction whose denominator is a power of ten. The denominator will consist
of 1 followed by one or more zeros. The number of zeros is the same as the
number of digits behind the decimal point.
2:8 ¼ 2 8
10 (one decimal placeone zero)
0:7695 ¼ 7695
10,000 (four decimal placesfour zeros)
Practice
Rewrite as a fraction. If the decimal number is more than 1, rewrite the
number both as a mixed number and as an improper fraction.

There are two types of decimal numbers, terminating and nonterminating.
The above examples and practice problems are terminating decimal
numbers.
A nonterminating decimal number has inﬁnitely many nonzero
digits following the decimal point. For example, 0.333333333 . . . is a non-
terminating decimal number.
Some nonterminating decimal numbers re-
present
fractions—0:333333333 . . . ¼ 1
3.
But
some
nonterminating
decimals, like  ¼ 3:1415926654 . . . and
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
¼ 1:414213562 . . ., do not rep-
resent fractions.
We will be concerned mostly with terminating decimal

You can add as many zeros at the end of a terminating decimal number as
you want because the extra zeros cancel away.

Adding and Subtracting Decimal Numbers
In order to add or subtract decimal numbers, each number needs to have the
same number of digits behind the decimal point. If you write the problem

vertically, you can avoid the common problem of adding the numbers
incorrectly.
For instance, 1:2 þ 3:41 is not 4.43.
The ‘‘2’’ needs to be
added to the ‘‘4,’’ not to the ‘‘1.’’

Multiplying Decimal Numbers
To multiply decimal numbers, perform multiplication as you would with
whole numbers. Then count the number of digits that follow the decimal
point or points in the factors. This total will be the number of digits that
follow the decimal point in the product.
Examples
12:83  7:91
The product will have four digits following the decimal
point.
3499:782  19:41
The product will have ﬁve digits following the
decimal point.

Decimal Fractions
Fractions having a decimal number in their numerator and/or denominator
can be rewritten as fractions without decimal points. Multiply the numerator
and denominator by a power of 10—the same power of 10—large enough so
that the decimal point becomes unnecessary.

Division with Decimals
We can use the method in the previous section to rewrite decimal division
problems as whole number division problems. Rewrite the division problem
as a fraction, clear the decimal, and then rewrite the fraction as a division
problem without decimal points.

6:03
1:2 ¼ 6:03  100

CHAPTER 4
Negative Numbers
A negative number is a number smaller than zero. Think about the readings
on a thermometer. A reading of 108 means the temperature is 108 below 08
and that the temperature would need to warm up 108 to reach 08. A reading
of 108 means the temperature would need to cool down 108 to reach 08.
Let us use a test example to discover some facts about arithmetic with
negative numbers. Suppose you are taking a test where one point is awarded
for each correct answer and one point is deducted for each incorrect answer.
If you miss the ﬁrst three problems, how many would you need to answer
correctly to bring your score to 10? You would need to answer three cor-
rectly to bring your answer up to zero, then you would need to answer 10
more correctly to bring your score to 10; you would need to answer 13
correctly to bring a score of 3 to 10: 10 ¼ 3 þ 3 þ 10 ¼ 3 þ 13. Now
suppose you miss the ﬁrst eight problems and get the next two answers
correct.
You now only need to answer six more correctly to reach zero:
8 þ 2 ¼ 6.
When adding a negative number to a positive number (or a positive num-
ber to a negative number), take the diﬀerence of the numbers. The sign on
the sum will be the same as the sign of the ‘‘larger’’ number.
If no sign
appears in front of a number, the number is positive.

Examples
82 þ 30 ¼ ____. The diﬀerence of 82 and 30 is 52. Because 82 is larger
than 30, the sign on 82 will be used on the sum: 82 þ 30 ¼ 52.
125 þ 75 ¼ ____. The diﬀerence of 125 and 75 is 50. Because 125 is
larger
than
75,
the
sign
on
125
will
be
used
on
the
sum:
125 þ 75 ¼ 50.
10 þ 48 ¼ ____.
The diﬀerence of 48 and 10 is 38.
Because 48 is
larger than 10, the sign on 48 will be used on the sum: 10 þ 48 ¼ 38.

Returning to the test example, suppose you have gotten the ﬁrst ﬁve correct
but missed the next two. Of course, your score would be 5  2 ¼ 3. Suppose
now that you missed more than ﬁve, your score would then become a nega-
tive number. If you missed the next seven problems, you will have lost credit
for all ﬁve you got correct plus another two: 5  7 ¼ 2. When subtracting
a larger positive number from a smaller positive number, take the diﬀerence
of the two numbers. The diﬀerence will be negative.
Examples
410  500 ¼ 90
10  72 ¼ 62
Be careful what you call these signs; a negative sign in front of a number
indicates that the number is smaller than zero. A minus sign between
two numbers indicates subtraction. In 3  5 ¼ 2, the sign in front of 5
is a minus sign and the sign in front of 2 is a negative sign. A minus sign
requires two quantities and a negative sign requires one quantity.
Practice
1: 28  30 ¼

5: 5  90 ¼ 85
Finally, suppose you have gotten the ﬁrst ﬁve problems incorrect. If you miss
the next three problems, you move even further away from zero; you would
now need to get ﬁve correct to bring the ﬁrst ﬁve problems up to zero plus
another three correct to bring the next three problems up to zero. In other
words, you would need to get 8 more correct to bring your score up to zero:
5  3 ¼ 8.
To subtract a positive number from a negative number, add
the two numbers. The sum will be negative.

Double Negatives
A negative sign in front of a quantity can be interpreted to mean ‘‘opposite.’’
For instance 3 can be called ‘‘the opposite of 3.’’ Viewed in this way, we
can see that ð4Þ means ‘‘the opposite of 4.’’ But the opposite of 4 is 4:
ð4Þ ¼ 4.
Examples
ð25Þ ¼ 25
 ðxÞ ¼ x
 ð3yÞ ¼ 3y
Rewriting a Subtraction Problem as an
Addition Problem
Sometimes in algebra it is easier to think of a subtraction problem as an
addition problem. One advantage to this is that you can rearrange the terms
in an addition problem but not a subtraction problem:
3 þ 4 ¼ 4 þ 3 but
4  3 6¼ 3  4. The minus sign can be replaced with a plus sign if you change
the sign of the number following it: 4  3 ¼ 4 þ ð3Þ. The parentheses are
used to show that the sign in front of the 3 is a negative sign and not a minus
sign.
Examples
82  14 ¼ 82 þ ð14Þ
20  ð6Þ ¼ 20 þ 6
x  y ¼ x þ ðyÞ

Multiplication and Division with Negative
Numbers
When taking the product of two or more quantities when one or more of
them is negative, take the product as you ordinarily would as if the negative
signs were not there. Count the number of negatives in the product. An even
number of negative signs will yield a positive product and an odd number of
negative signs will yield a negative product.
Similarly, for a quotient (or
fraction), two negatives yield a positive quotient and one negative and one
positive yield a negative quotient.

Negating a variable does not automatically mean that the quantity will be
negative: x means ‘‘the opposite’’ of x. We cannot conclude that x is a
negative number unless we have reason to believe x itself is a positive num-
ber. If x is a negative number, x is a positive number. (Although in practice
we verbally say ‘‘negative x’’ for ‘‘x’’ when we really mean ‘‘the opposite of
x.’’)
The same rules apply when multiplying ‘‘negative’’ variables.

Because a negative divided by a positive is negative and a positive divided by
a negative is negative, a negative sign in a fraction can go wherever you want
to put it.

CHAPTER 5
Exponents and Roots
The expression 4x is shorthand for x þ x þ x þ x, that is x added to itself
four times. Likewise x4 is shorthand for x  x  x  x—x multiplied by itself
four times. In x4, x is called the base and 4 is the power or exponent. We say
‘‘x to the fourth power’’ or simply ‘‘x to the fourth.’’ There are many useful
exponent properties. For the rest of the chapter, a is a nonzero number.
Property 1
anam ¼ am+n
When multiplying two powers whose bases are the same, add the exponents.
Examples
23  24 ¼ ð2  2  2Þð2  2  2  2Þ ¼ 27
x9  x3 ¼ x12
Property 2
am
an ¼ amn
When dividing two powers whose bases are the same, subtract the denomi-
nator’s power from the numerator’s power.

y7
y3 ¼ y73 ¼ y4
Property 3
(an)m ¼ anm
If you have a quantity raised to a power then raised to another power,
multiply the exponents.
Examples
ð53Þ2 ¼ ð5  5  5Þ2 ¼ ð5  5  5Þð5  5  5Þ ¼ 56
ðx6Þ7 ¼ xð6Þð7Þ ¼ x42
Be careful, Properties 1 and 3 are easily confused.
Property 4
a0 = 1
Any nonzero number raised to the zero power is one. We will see that this is
true by Property 2 and the fact that any nonzero number over itself is one.
1 ¼ 16
16 ¼ 42
42 ¼ 422 ¼ 40
From this we can see that 40 must be 1.

[(x + 11)3]5 = (x + 11)15
ð3x  4Þ7
ð3x  4Þ5 ¼ ð3x  4Þ2
Be careful not to write ð3x  4Þ2 as ð3xÞ2  42—we will see later that ð3x  4Þ2
is 9x2  24x þ 16.

Adding/Subtracting Fractions
When adding fractions with variables in one or more denominators, the LCD
will have each variable (or algebraic expression) to its highest power as a
factor. For example, the LCD for 1
x2 þ 1
x þ 1
y3 þ 1
y2 is x2y3.

Multiplying/Dividing with Exponents
When multiplying (or dividing) quantities that have exponents, use the expo-
nent properties to simplify each factor (or numerator and denominator) then
multiply (or divide).

There are times in algebra, and especially in calculus, when you will need to
convert a fraction into a product. Using the fact that 1
a ¼ a1, we can rewrite
a fraction as a product of the numerator and denominator raised to the 1
power. Here is the idea:
numerator
denominator ¼ ðnumeratorÞðdenominatorÞ1:

Roots
The square root of a number is the nonnegative number whose square is the
root. For example 3 is the square root of 9 because 32 ¼ 9.
Examples
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
16
p
¼ 4 because 42 ¼ 16
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
81
p
¼ 9 because 92 ¼ 81
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
625
p
¼ 25 because 252 ¼ 625
It may seem that negative numbers could be square roots.
It is true that
ð3Þ2 ¼ 9. But
ﬃﬃﬃ
9
p
is the symbol for the nonnegative number whose
square is 9. Sometimes we say that 3 is the principal square root of 9.
When we speak of an even root, we mean the nonnegative root. In

general,
ﬃﬃﬃa
np ¼ b if bn ¼ a. There is no problem with odd roots being
negative numbers:
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
64
3p
¼ 4 because ð4Þ3 ¼ ð4Þð4Þð4Þ ¼ 64:
If n is even, b is assumed to be the nonnegative root.
Also even roots of
negative numbers do not exist in the real number system. In this book, it is
assumed that even roots will be taken only of nonnegative numbers.
For
instance in
ﬃﬃﬃx
p , it is assumed that x is not negative.
Root properties are similar to exponent properties.

Property 1 only applies to multiplication. There is no similar property for
addition (nor subtraction). A common mistake is to ‘‘simplify’’ the sum of
two squares.
For example
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ 9
p
¼ x þ 3 is incorrect.
The following
example should give you an idea of why these two expressions are not
equal. If there were the property
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a þ b
np
¼
ﬃﬃﬃa
np þ
ﬃﬃﬃ

, then we would have
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

p

This could only be true if 102 = 58.

These properties can be used to simplify roots in the same way canceling
is used to simplify fractions.
For instance you normally would not leave
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

p
without simplifying it as 5 any more than you would leave
12
4
without reducing it to 3.

if m is at least as large as n, then

CHAPTER 5
Exponents and Roots
101
Roots of fractions or fractions with a root in the denominator are not
simpliﬁed.
To eliminate roots in denominators, use the fact that
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
an
np
¼ a
and that any nonzero number over itself is one. We will begin with square
roots. If the denominator is a square root, multiply the fraction by the denomi-
nator over itself. This will force the new denominator to be a perfect square.

In the case of a cube (or higher) root, multiplying the fraction by
the denominator over itself usually does not work.
To eliminate the nth
root in the denominator, we need to write the denominator as the
nth root of some quantity to the nth power.
For example, to simplify
1ﬃﬃﬃ
5
3p
we need a 53 under the cube root sign. There is only one 5 under the
cube root. We need a total of three 5s, so we need two more 5s. Multiply
5 by 52 to get 53:

:
When the denominator is written as a power (often the power is 1) sub-
tract this power from the root.
The factor will have this number as a
power.

Roots Expressed as Exponents
Roots can be written as exponents by using the following two properties.
This ability is useful in algebra and calculus.
Property 1

Factoring
Distributing Multiplication over Addition and
Subtraction
Distributing multiplication over addition (and subtraction) and factoring
(the opposite of distributing) are extremely important in algebra. The dis-
tributive law of multiplication over addition, aðb þ cÞ ¼ ab þ ac, says that
you can ﬁrst take the sum ðb þ cÞ then the product (a times the sum of b
and c) or the individual products ðab and ac) then the sum (the sum of ab and
ac). For instance, 12ð6 þ 4Þ could be computed as 12ð6 þ 4Þ ¼ 12ð6Þ þ 12ð4Þ
¼ 72 þ 48 ¼ 120 or as 12ð6 þ 4Þ ¼ 12ð10Þ ¼ 120. The distributive law of
multiplication over subtraction, aðb  cÞ ¼ ab  ac, says the same about a
product and diﬀerence.

Sometimes you will need to ‘‘distribute’’ a minus sign or negative sign:
ða þ bÞ ¼ a  b and ða  bÞ ¼ a þ b. You can use the distributive
properties
and
think
of
ða þ bÞ
as
ð1Þða þ bÞ
and
ða  bÞ
as
ð1Þða  bÞ:
ða þ bÞ ¼ ð1Þða þ bÞ ¼ ð1Þa þ ð1Þb ¼ a þ b ¼ a  b
and
ða  bÞ ¼ ð1Þða  bÞ ¼ ð1Þa  ð1Þb ¼ a  ð1Þb
¼ a  ðbÞ ¼ a þ b:
A common mistake is to write ða þ bÞ ¼ a þ b and ða  bÞ ¼ a  b.
The minus sign and negative sign in front of the parentheses changes the signs
of every term (a quantity separated by a plus or minus sign) inside the
parentheses.
Examples
ð3 þ xÞ ¼ 3  x
ðy  x2Þ ¼ y þ x2
ð2 þ yÞ ¼ 2  y
ð9  yÞ ¼ 9 þ y
ð2 þ x  3yÞ ¼ 2  x þ 3y

minus sign: every sign in the parentheses changes.

Combining Like Terms
Two or more terms are alike if they have the same variables and the
exponents (or roots) on those variables are the same:
3x2y and 5x2y are
like terms but 6xy and 4xy2 are not. Constants are terms with no variables.
The number in front of the variable(s) is the coeﬃcient—in 4x2y3, 4 is the
coeﬃcient. If no number appears in front of the variable, then the coeﬃ-
cient is 1.
Add or subtract like terms by adding or subtracting their
coeﬃcients.

Adding/Subtracting Fractions
With the distributive property and the ability to combine like terms, the
numerator of fraction sums/diﬀerences can be simpliﬁed. For now, we will
leave the denominators factored.

Factoring
The distributive property, aðb þ cÞ ¼ ab þ ac, can be used to factor a quan-
tity from two or more terms. In the formula ab þ ac ¼ aðb þ cÞ, a is fac-
tored from (or divided into) ab and ac. The ﬁrst step in factoring is to
decide what quantity you want to factor from each term.
Second write
CHAPTER 6
Factoring
121
Solution 1 (continued)

CHAPTER 6
Factoring
122
each term as a product of the factor and something else (this step will
become unnecessary once you are experienced).
Third apply the distribu-
tion property in reverse.
Examples
4 þ 6x
Each term is divisible by 2, so factor 2 from 4 and 6x: 4 þ 6x ¼ 2  2 þ
2  3x ¼ 2ð2 þ 3xÞ:
2x þ 5x2 ¼ x  2 þ x  5x ¼ xð2 þ 5xÞ
3x2 þ 6x ¼ 3x  x þ 3x  2 ¼ 3xðx þ 2Þ
8x þ 8 ¼ 8  x þ 8  1 ¼ 8ðx þ 1Þ
4xy þ 6x2 þ 2xy2 ¼ 2x  2y þ 2x  3x þ 2x  y2 ¼ 2xð2y þ 3x þ y2Þ
Complicated expressions can be factored in several steps. Take for
example
48x5y3z6 þ 60x4yz3 þ 36x6y2z,
each
term
is
divisible
by
12xyz. Start with this.
48x5y3z6 þ 60x4yz3 þ 36x6y2z ¼ 12xyz  4x4y2z5 þ 12xyz  5x3z2
þ 12xyz  3x5y ¼ 12xyzð4x4y2z5 þ 5x3z2 þ 3x5yÞ
Each term in the parentheses is divisible by x2:
4x4y2z5 þ 5x3z2 þ 3x5y ¼ x2  4x2y2z5 þ x2  5xz2 þ x2  3x3y
¼ x2ð4x2y2z5 þ 5xz2 þ 3x3yÞ
48x5y3z6 þ 60x4yz3 þ 36x6y2z ¼ 12xyz  x2ð4x2y2z5 þ 5xz2 þ 3x3yÞ

CHAPTER 6
Factoring
125
The associative and distributive properties can be confusing. The associative
property states ðabÞc ¼ aðbcÞ. This property says that when multiplying three
(or more) quantities you can multiply the ﬁrst two then the third or multiply
the second two then the ﬁrst. For example, it might be tempting to write
5ðx þ 1Þðy  3Þ ¼ ð5x þ 5Þð5y  15Þ.
But
ð5x þ 5Þð5y  15Þ ¼ ½5ðx þ 1Þ
½5ðy  3Þ ¼ 25ðx þ 1Þðy  3Þ. The ‘‘5’’ can be grouped either with ‘‘x þ 1’’
or
with
‘‘y  3’’
but
not
both:
½5ðx þ 1Þðy  3Þ ¼ ð5x þ 5Þðy  3Þ
or
ðx þ 1Þ½5ðy  3Þ ¼ ðx þ 1Þð5y  15Þ.
Factors themselves can have more than one term. For instance 3ðx þ 4Þ 
xðx þ 4Þ has x þ 4 as a factor in each term, so x þ 4 can be factored from
3ðx þ 4Þ and xðx þ 4Þ:
3ðx þ 4Þ  xðx þ 4Þ ¼ ð3  xÞðx þ 4Þ:
Examples
2xð3x þ yÞ þ 5yð3x þ yÞ ¼ ð2x þ 5yÞð3x þ yÞ

CHAPTER 6
Factoring

Factoring by Grouping
Sometimes you can combine two or more terms at a time in such a way that
each term has an algebraic expression as a common factor.
Examples
3x2  3 þ x3  x
If 3 is factored from the ﬁrst two terms and x is factored from the last
two terms, we would have two terms with a factor of x2  1.
3x2  3 þ x3  x ¼ 3ðx2  1Þ þ xðx2  1Þ ¼ ð3 þ xÞðx2  1Þ
You could also combine the ﬁrst and third terms and the second and
fourth terms.
3x2  3 þ x3  x ¼ 3x2 þ x3  3  x ¼ x2ð3 þ xÞ  ð3 þ xÞ

Factoring to Reduce Fractions
Among factoring’s many uses is in reducing fractions.
If the numerator’s
terms and the denominator’s terms have common factors, factor them then
cancel. It might not be necessary to factor the numerator and denominator
completely.
Examples
6x2 þ 2xy
4x2y  10xy
Each term in the numerator and denominator
has a factor of 2x:
6x2 þ 2xy
4x2y  10xy ¼ 2xð3x þ yÞ
2xð2xy  5yÞ ¼ 3x þ y
2xy  5y
xy  x
16x2  xy ¼

Factoring

Reducing a fraction or adding two fractions sometimes only requires that 1
be factored from one or more denominators.
For instance in y  x
x  y the
numerator and denominator are only oﬀby a factor of 1. To reduce this
fraction, factor 1 from the numerator or denominator:
y  x
x  y ¼ ðy þ xÞ
x  y
¼ ðx  yÞ
x  y
¼ 1
1 ¼ 1 or
y  x
x  y ¼
y  x
ðx þ yÞ ¼
y  x
ðy  xÞ ¼ 1
1 ¼ 1:
In the sum
3
y  x þ
x
x  y the denominators are oﬀby a factor of 1. Factor
1 from one of the denominators and use the fact that a
b ¼ a
b to write
both terms with the same denominator.

Factoring Quadratic Polynomials
We will now work in the opposite direction—factoring. First we will factor
quadratic polynomials, expressions of the form ax2 þ bx þ c (where a is not
0).
For example x2 þ 5x þ 6 is factored as ðx þ 2Þðx þ 3Þ. Quadratic poly-
nomials whose ﬁrst factors are x2 are the easiest to factor. Their factorization
always begins as ðx 
Þðx 
Þ.
This forces the ﬁrst factor to be x2 when
the FOIL method is used All you need to do is ﬁll in the two blanks and
decide when to use plus and minus signs. All quadratic polynomials factor
though some do not factor ‘‘nicely.’’ We will only concern ourselves with
‘‘nicely’’ factorable polynomials in this chapter.
If the second sign is minus, then the signs in the factors will be diﬀerent
(one plus and one minus). If the second sign is plus then both of the signs will
be the same. In this case, if the ﬁrst sign in the trinomial is a plus sign, both
signs in the factors will be plus; and if the ﬁrst sign in the trinomial is a minus
sign, both signs in the factors will be minus.

Once the signs are determined all that remains is to ﬁll in the two blanks.
Look at all of the pairs of factors of the constant term. These pairs will be
the candidates for the blanks. For example, if the constant term is 12, you
will need to consider 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. If both signs in the
factors are the same, these will be the only ones you need to try.
If the
signs are diﬀerent, you will need to reverse the order: 1 and 12 as well as
12 and 1; 2 and 6 as well as 6 and 2; 3 and 4 as well as 4 and 3. Try the
FOIL method on these pairs. (Not every trinomial can be factored in this
way.)

There is a factoring shortcut when the ﬁrst term is x2. If the second sign is
plus, choose the factors whose sum is the coeﬃcient of the second term. For
example the factors of 6 we need for x2  7x þ 6 need to sum to 7:
CHAPTER 6
Factoring
139

x2  7x þ 6 ¼ ðx  1Þðx  6Þ. The factors of 6 we need for x2 þ 5x þ 6 need
to sum to 5: x2 þ 5x þ 6 ¼ ðx þ 2Þðx þ 3Þ.
If the second sign is minus, the diﬀerence of the factors needs to be the
coeﬃcient of the middle term. If the ﬁrst sign is plus, the bigger factor will
have the plus sign. If the ﬁrst sign is minus, the bigger factor will have the
minus sign.
Examples
x2 þ 3x  10: The factors of 10 whose diﬀerence is 3 are 2 and 5. The
ﬁrst sign is plus, so the plus sign goes with 5, the bigger factor:
x2 þ 3x  10 ¼ ðx þ 5Þðx  2Þ.
x2  5x  14: The factors of 14 whose diﬀerence is 5 are 2 and 7. The
ﬁrst sign is minus, so the minus sign goes with 7, the bigger factor:
x2  5x  14 ¼ ðx  7Þðx þ 2Þ.

This shortcut can help you identify quadratic polynomials that do not factor
‘‘nicely’’ without spending too much time on them. The next three examples
are quadratic polynomials that do not factor ‘‘nicely.’’
x2 þ x þ 1
x2 þ 14x þ 19
x2  5x þ 10
Quadratic polynomials of the form x2  c2 are called the diﬀerence of two
squares. We can use the shortcut on x2  c2 ¼ x2 þ 0x  c2. The factors of
c2 must have a diﬀerence of 0. This can only happen if they are the same, so
the factors of c2 we want are c and c.
Examples
x2  9 ¼ ðx  3Þðx þ 3Þ
x2  100 ¼ ðx  10Þðx þ 10Þ
x2  49 ¼ ðx  7Þðx þ 7Þ
16  x2 ¼ ð4  xÞð4 þ xÞ
When the sign between x2 and c2 is plus, the quadratic cannot be factored
using real numbers.

even number. The factorization is xn  cn ¼ ðxn=2  cn=2Þðxn=2 þ cn=2Þ. [When
n is odd, xn  cn can be factored also but this factorization will not be covered
here.]

When the ﬁrst term is not x2, see if you can factor out the coeﬃcient of x2 . If
you can, then you are left with a quadratic whose ﬁrst term is x2. For example
each term in 2x2 þ 16x  18 is divisible by 2:
2x2 þ 16x  18 ¼ 2ðx2 þ 8x  9Þ ¼ 2ðx þ 9Þðx  1Þ.

5: 6x2 þ 24x þ 24 ¼ 6ðx2 þ 4x þ 4Þ ¼ 6ðx þ 2Þðx þ 2Þ ¼ 6ðx þ 2Þ2
The coeﬃcient of the x2 term will not always factor away. In order to factor
quadratics such as 4x2 þ 8x þ 3 you will need to try all combinations of
factors of 4 and of 3: ð4x þ
Þðx þ
Þ and ð2x þ
Þð2x þ
Þ. The blanks
will be ﬁlled in with the factors of 3. You will need to check all of the
possibilities: ð4x þ 1Þðx þ 3Þ, ð4x þ 3Þðx þ 1Þ, and ð2x þ 1Þð2x þ 3Þ:
Example
4x2  4x  15

CHAPTER 6
Factoring
146
The possibilities to check are
(a)
ð4x þ 15Þðx  1Þ
(b)
ð4x  15Þðx þ 1Þ
(c)
ð4x  1Þðx þ 15Þ
(d)
ð4x þ 1Þðx  15Þ
(e)
ð4x þ 5Þðx  3Þ
(f)
ð4x  5Þðx þ 3Þ
(g)
ð4x þ 3Þðx  5Þ
(h)
ð4x  3Þðx þ 5Þ
(i)
ð2x þ 15Þð2x  1Þ
(j)
ð2x  15Þð2x þ 1Þ
(k)
ð2x þ 5Þð2x  3Þ
(l)
ð2x  5Þð2x þ 3Þ
We have chosen these combinations to force the ﬁrst and last terms of the
quadratic to be 4x2 and 15, respectively, we only need to check the combi-
nation that will give a middle term of 4x (if there is one).
(a)
4x þ 15x ¼ 11x
(b)
4x  15x ¼ 11x
(c)
60x  x ¼ 59x
(d)
60x þ x ¼ 59x
(e)
12x þ 5x ¼ 7x
(f)
12x  5x ¼ 7x
(g)
20x þ 3x ¼ 17x
(h)
20x  3x ¼ 17x
(i)
2x þ 30x ¼ 28x
(j)
2x  30x ¼ 28x
(k)
6x þ 10x ¼ 4x
(l)
6x  10x ¼ 4x
Combination (l) is the correct factorization:
4x2  4x  15 ¼ ð2x  5Þð2x þ 3Þ:
You can see that when the constant term and x2’s coeﬃcient have many
factors, this list of factorizations to check can grow rather long. Fortunately
there is a way around this problem as we shall see in a later chapter.

Quadratic Type Expressions
An expression with three terms where the power of the ﬁrst term is twice that
of the second and the third term is a constant is called a quadratic type
expression. They factor in the same way as quadratic polynomials. The
power on x in the factorization will be the power on x in the middle term.
To see the eﬀect of changing the exponents, let us look at x2  2x  3 ¼
ðx  3Þðx þ 1Þ:
x4  2x2  3 ¼ ðx2  3Þðx2 þ 1Þ

From the ﬁrst fraction we see that the LCD needs x  4 and x þ 1 as
factors. From the second fraction we see that the LCD needs x  1 and
x þ 1, but x þ 1 has been accounted for by the ﬁrst fraction. The LCD
is ðx  4Þðx  1Þðx þ 1Þ.

Once the LCD is found rewrite each fraction in terms of the LCD—multiply
each fraction by the ‘‘missing’’ factors over themselves. Then add or subtract
the numerators.

The factor x  3 is ‘‘missing’’ in the ﬁrst denominator so multiply the
ﬁrst fraction by x  3
x  3. An x  1 is ‘‘missing’’ from the second denomi-
nator so multiply the second fraction by x  1
x  1.

CHAPTER 7
Linear Equations
Now we can use the tools we have developed to solve equations. Up to now,
we have rewritten expressions and added fractions. This chapter is mostly
concerned with linear equations. In a linear equation, the variables are raised
to the ﬁrst power—there are no variables in denominators, no variables to
any power (other than one), and no variables under root signs.
In solving for linear equations, there will be an unknown, usually only one
but possibly several. What is meant by ‘‘solve for x’’ is to isolate x on one side
of the equation and to move everything else on the other side. Usually,
although not always, the last line is the sentence
‘‘x ¼ (number)’’
where the number satisﬁes the original equation. That is, when the number is
substituted for x, the equation is true.
In the equation 3x þ 7 ¼ 1; x ¼ 2 is the solution because 3ð2Þ þ 7 ¼ 1
is a true statement. For any other number, the statement would be false. For
instance, if we were to say that x ¼ 4, the sentence would be 3ð4Þ þ 7 ¼ 1,
which is false.
Not every equation will have a solution. For example, x þ 3 ¼ x þ 10 has
no solution. Why not? There is no number that can be added to three and be
the same quantity as when it is added to 10. If you were to try to solve for x,
you would end up with the false statement 3 ¼ 10:
In order to solve equations and to verify solutions, you must know the
order of operations. For example, in the formula

what is done ﬁrst? Second? Third?
A pneumonic for remembering operation order is ‘‘Please excuse my dear
Aunt Sally.’’
P—parentheses ﬁrst
E—exponents (and roots) second
M—multiplication third
D—division third (multiplication and division should be done together,
working from left to right)
A—addition fourth
S—subtraction fourth (addition and subtraction should be done together,
working from left to right)
When working with fractions, think of numerators and denominators as
being in parentheses.

To solve equations for the unknown, use inverse operations to isolate the
variable. These inverse operations ‘‘undo’’ what has been done to the vari-
able. That is, inverse operations are used to move quantities across the equal
sign. For instance, in the equation 5x ¼ 10, x is multiplied by 5, so to move 5
across the equal sign, you need to ‘‘unmultiply’’ the 5. That is, divide both
sides of the equation by 5 (equivalently, multiply each side of the equation by
1
5). In the equation 5 þ x ¼ 10, to move 5 across the equal sign, you must
CHAPTER 7

165

‘‘unadd’’ 5. That is, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation (equivalently,
add 5 to both sides of the equation).
In short, what is added must be subtracted; what is subtracted must be
added; what is multiplied must be divided; and what is divided must be
multiplied. There are other operation pairs (an operation and its inverse);
some will be discussed later.
In much of this book, when the coeﬃcient of x (the number multiplying x)
is an integer, both sides of the equation will be divided by that integer. And
when the coeﬃcient is a fraction, both sides of the equation will be multiplied
by the reciprocal of that fraction.

Some equations can be solved in a number of ways. However, the general
method in this book will be the same:
CHAPTER 7
Linear Equations
167

1.
Simplify both sides of the equation.
2.
Collect all terms with variables in them on one side of the equation
and all nonvariable terms on the other (this is done by adding/
subtracting terms).
3.
Factor out the variable.
4.
Divide both sides of the equation by the variable’s coeﬃcient (this is
what has been factored out in step 3).
Of course, you might need only one or two of these steps. In the previous
examples and practice problems, only step 4 was used.
In the following examples, the number of the step used will be in parenth-
eses. Although it will not normally be done here, it is a good idea to verify
your solution in the original equation.

When the equation you are given has fractions and you prefer not to work
with fractions, you can clear the fractions in the ﬁrst step. Of course, the
solution might be a fraction, but that fraction will not occur until the last
step. Find the LCD of all fractions and multiply both sides of the equation by
this number. Then, distribute this quantity on each side of the equation.

A common mistake is to fail to distribute the LCD. Another is to multiply
only one side of the equation by the LCD.
In the ﬁrst example,
4
5 x þ 1 ¼ 4, one common mistake is to multiply
both sides by 5 but not to distribute 5 on the left-hand side.

In each case, the last line is not equivalent to the ﬁrst line—that is, the
solution to the last equation is not the solution to the ﬁrst equation.
In some cases, you will need to use the associative property of multiplica-
tion with the LCD instead of the distributive property.

On each side, there are three quantities being multiplied together. On the left,
the quantities are 6, 1
3 and x þ 4. By the associative law of multiplication, the
6 and 1
3 can be multiplied, then that product is multiplied by x þ 4. Similarly,
on the right, ﬁrst multiply 6 and 1

Decimals
Because decimal numbers are fractions in disguise, the same trick can be used
to ‘‘clear the decimal’’ in equations with decimal numbers. Count the largest
number of digits behind each decimal point and multiply both sides of the
equation by 10 raised to the power of that number.
Examples
0:25x þ 0:6 ¼ 0:1
Because there are two digits behind the decimal in 0.25, we need to
multiply both sides of the equation by 102 ¼ 100. Remember to distri-
bute the 100 inside the parentheses.

Formulas
At times math students are given a formula like I ¼ Prt and asked to solve
for one of the variables; that is, to isolate that particular variable on one
side of the equation. In I ¼ Prt, the equation is solved for ‘‘I.’’
The
method used above for solving for x works on these, too. Many people
are confused by the presence of multiple variables. The trick is to think of
the variable for which you are trying to solve as x and all of the other
variables as ﬁxed numbers. For instance, if you were asked to solve for r in
I ¼ Prt, think of how you would solve something of the same form with
numbers, say
100 ¼ ð500ÞðxÞð2Þ:
100 ¼ ð500ÞðxÞð2Þ
100 ¼ ½ð500Þð2Þx
100
ð500Þð2Þ ¼ x:
The steps for solving for r in I ¼ Prt are identical:

Equations Leading to Linear Equations
Some equations are almost linear equations; after one or more steps these
equations become linear equations. In this section, we will be converting
rational expressions (one quantity divided by another quantity) into linear
expressions and square root equations into linear equations. The solution(s)
to these converted equations might not be the same as the solution(s) to the
original equation. After certain operations, you must check the solution(s) to
the converted equation in the original equation.
To solve a rational equation, clear the fraction. In this book, two
approaches will be used First, if the equation is in the form of ‘‘fraction ¼
fraction,’’ cross multiply to eliminate the fraction. Second, if there is more
than one fraction on one side of the equal sign, the LCD will be determined
and each side of the equation will be multiplied by the LCD. These are not
the only methods for solving rational equations.
The following is a rational equation in the form of one fraction equals
another. We will use the fact that for b and d nonzero, a
b ¼ c
d if and only if
ad ¼ bc.
This method is called cross multiplication.
1
x  1 ¼ 1
2
2ð1Þ ¼ 1ðx  1Þ
(This is the cross multiplication step.)
2
þ1
¼ x  1
þ1
3 ¼ x
Check:
1
3  1 ¼ 1
2 is a true statement, so x ¼ 3 is the solution.
Anytime you multiply (or divide) both sides of the equation by an expres-
sion with a variable in it, you must check your solution(s) in the original
equation. When you cross multiply, you are implicitly multiplying both sides
of the equations by the denominators of each fraction, so you must check
your solution in this case as well. The reason is that sometimes a solution to
the converted equation will cause a zero to be in a denominator of the
original equation. Such solutions are called extraneous solutions. See what
happens in the next example.

2

4x ¼ 8
x ¼ 2
But x ¼ 2 leads to a zero in a denominator of the original equation, so x ¼
2 is not a solution to the original equation. The original equation has no
solution.
Have you ever wondered why expressions like 2
0 are not numbers? Let us
see what complications arise when we try to see what ‘‘2
0’’ might mean. Say
2
0 ¼ x.
2
0 ¼ x
1
Now cross multiply.
2ð1Þ ¼ 0ðxÞ
Multiplication by zero always yields zero, so the right hand side is zero.
2 ¼ 0
No value for x can make this equation true.
Or, if you try to ‘‘clear the fraction’’ by multiplying both sides of the equation
by a common denominator, you will see that an absurd situation arises here,
too.
0  2
0 ¼ 0x

CHAPTER 7
Linear Equations
189
So, 0 ¼ 0x, which is true for any x. Actually, the expression 0
0 is not deﬁned.
On some equations, you will want to raise both sides of the equation to a
power in order to solve for x. Be careful to raise both sides of the equation to
the same power, not simply the side with the root. Raising both sides of an
equation to an even power is another operation which can introduce extra-
neous solutions. To see how this can happen, let us look at the equation
x ¼ 4. If we square both sides of the equation, we get the equation x2 ¼ 16.
This equation has two solutions: x ¼ 4 and x ¼ 4.
Example
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x  1
p
¼ 6
Remember that
ﬃﬃﬃa
p

2 ¼ a if a is not negative. We will use this fact to
eliminate the square root sign. So, to ‘‘undo’’ a square root, ﬁrst isolate
the square root on one side of the equation (in this example, it already
is) then square both sides.
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x  1
p

	2
¼ 62
x  1
þ1
¼ 36
þ1
x ¼ 37
Because we squared both sides, we need to make sure x ¼ 37 is a
solution to the original equation.
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
37  1
p
¼ 6
is a true statement, so x ¼ 37 is the solution.
Quadratic equations, to be studied in the last chapter, have their variables
squared—that is, the only powers on variables are one and two. Some quad-
ratic equations are equivalent to linear equations.
Example
ð6x  5Þ2 ¼ ð4x þ 3Þð9x  2Þ
ð6x  5Þð6x  5Þ ¼ ð4x þ 3Þð9x  2Þ
36x2  30x  30x þ 25 ¼ 36x2  8x þ 27x  6
36x2  60x þ 25 ¼ 36x2 þ 19x  6

CHAPTER 7
Linear Equations
190
Because 36x2 is on each side of the equation, they cancel each other, and we
are left with
60x þ 25 ¼ 19x  6;
an ordinary linear equation.
60x þ 25

¼ 19x  6
þ60x

þ6
¼ 79x  6
þ6
31 ¼ 79x

79 ¼ x
Because we neither multiplied (nor divided) both sides by an expression
involving a variable nor raised both sides to a power, it is not necessary to
check your solution. For accuracy, however, checking solutions is a good
habit.

Linear Applications
To many algebra students, applications (word problems) seem impossible to
solve. You might be surprised how easy solving many of them really is. If you
follow the program in this chapter, you will ﬁnd yourself becoming a pro at
solving word problems. Mastering the problems in this chapter will also train
you to solve applied problems in science courses and in more advanced
mathematics courses.
Percents
A percent is a decimal number in disguise. In fact, the word ‘‘percent’’
literally means ‘‘per hundred.’’ Remember that ‘‘per’’ means to divide, so
16% means 16  100 or 16=100 ¼ 0:16. Then 16% of 25 will be translated
into (0.16)(25). (Remember that ‘‘of’’ means ‘‘multiply.’’) So, 16% of 25 is
ð0:16Þð25Þ ¼ 4.
Examples
82% of 44 is ð0:82Þð44Þ ¼ 36:08
150% of 6 is ð1:50Þð6Þ ¼ 9

Increasing/Decreasing by a Percent
As consumers, we often see quantities being increased or decreased by some
percentage. For instance, a cereal box boasts ‘‘25% More.’’ An item might
be on sale, saying ‘‘Reduced by 40%.’’
When increasing a quantity by a
percent, ﬁrst compute what the percent is, then add it to the original quantity.
When decreasing a quantity by a percent, again compute the percent then
subtract it from the original quantity.

Many word problems involving percents ﬁt the above model—that is, a
quantity being increased or decreased. Often you can solve these problems
using one of the following formats:
x þ :
x (for a quantity being increased by a percent)
or
x  :
x (for a quantity being decreased by a percent).
Examples
A $100 jacket will be reduced by 15% for a sale. What will the sale price
be?
Let x ¼ sale price.
Then, 100  ð0:15Þð100Þ ¼ x:
100  15 ¼ x
85 ¼ x
The sale price is $85.
More often, the sale price will be known and the original price is not
known.
The sale price for a computer is $1200, which represents a 20% mark-
down. What is the original price?
Let x represent original price. Then the sale price is x  0:20x ¼ 0:80x.
The sale price is also 1200. This gives us the equation 0:80x ¼ 1200:
0:80x ¼ 1200
x ¼ 1200
0:80
x ¼ 1500

The original price is $1500.
In the ﬁrst example, the percent was multiplied by the number given; and
in the second, the percent was multiplied by the unknown. You must be very
careful in deciding of which quantity you take the percent. Suppose the ﬁrst
problem was worded, ‘‘An item is marked down 20% for a sale. The sale
price is $80, what is the original price?’’
The equation to solve would be
x  0:20x ¼ 80x, where x represents the original price. A common mistake is
to take 20% of $80 and not 20% of the original price.
The data used in the following examples and practice problems are taken
from the 117th edition of Statistical Abstract of the United States. Many
quantities and percentages are approximate.
Examples
The average number of hours of television watched
by U.S. adults
during 1980 was 1470. By 1995, the number of hours of television view-
ing increased by about 7.1%. What was the average number of hours of
television viewing in 1995?
1980 hours þ7:1% of 1980 hours ¼ 1995 hours
1470 þ ð0:071Þð1470Þ ¼ 1470 þ 104:37 ¼ 1574:37
The average number of hours U.S. adults spent watching television in
1995 was about 1574.
On January 1, 1995, the price of a ﬁrst class postage stamp was $0.32,
which is a 60% increase from the cost on November 1, 1981. What was
the cost of a ﬁrst class stamp on November 1, 1981?
Let x ¼ 1st class price on November 1, 1981
$0.32 is 60% more than this quantity.

For some word problems, nothing more will be required of you than to
substitute a given value into a formula, which is either given to you or is
readily available. The most diﬃcult part of these problems will be to decide
which variable the given quantity will be. For example, the formula might
look like R ¼ 8q and the value given to you is 440. Is R ¼ 440 or is q ¼ 440?
The answer lies in the way the variables are described In R ¼ 8q, it might be
that R represents revenue (in dollars) and q represents quantity (in units) sold
of some item. ‘‘If 440 units were sold, what is the revenue?’’ Here 440 is q.
You would then solve R ¼ 8ð440Þ. ‘‘If the revenue is $440, how many units
were sold?’’ Here 440 is R, and you would solve 440 ¼ 8q:
Examples
The cost formula for a manufacturer’s product is C ¼ 5000 þ 2x, where
C is the cost (in dollars) and x is the number of units manufactured.

(a)
If no units are produced, what is the cost?
(b)
If the manufacturer produces 3000 units, what is the cost?
(c)
If the manufacturer has spent $16,000 on production, how many
units were manufactured?
Answer these questions by substituting the numbers into the formula.
(a)
If no units are produced, then x ¼ 0, and C ¼ 5000 þ 2x becomes
C ¼ 5000 þ 2ð0Þ ¼ 5000. The cost is $5,000.
(b)
If the manufacturer produces 3000 units, then x ¼ 3000, and C ¼
5000 þ 2x becomes C ¼ 5000 þ 2ð3000Þ ¼ 5000 þ 6000 ¼ 11;000.
The manufacturer’s cost would be $11,000.
(c)
The manufacturer’s cost is $16,000, so C ¼ 16,000. Substitute
C ¼ 16,000 into C ¼ 5000 þ 2x to get 16;000 ¼ 5000 þ 2x.

What is the proﬁt when 12,000 units were sold?
(b)
What is the loss when 1500 units were sold?
(c)
How many units must be sold for the manufacturer to have a proﬁt
of $3000?
(d)
How many units must be sold for the manufacturer to break even?
(This question could have been phrased, ‘‘How many units must be sold
in order for the manufacturer to cover its costs?’’)
(a)
If 12,000 units are sold, then x ¼ 12,000. The proﬁt equation then
becomes
P ¼ 2ð12;000Þ  4000 ¼ 24;000  4000 ¼ 20,000.
The
proﬁt is $20,000.
(b)
Think of a loss as a negative proﬁt. When 1500 units are sold, P ¼
2x  4000 becomes P ¼ 2ð1500Þ  4000 ¼ 3000  4000 ¼ 1000.
The manufacturer loses $1000 when 1500 units are sold.
(c)
If the proﬁt is $3000, then P ¼ 3000; P ¼ 2x  4000 becomes
3000 ¼ 2x  4000.

A box has a square bottom. The height has not yet been determined, but
the bottom is 10 inches by 10 inches. The volume formula is V ¼ lwh,
because each of the length and width is 10, lw becomes 10  10 ¼ 100.
The formula for the box’s volume is V ¼ 100h.

(b)
If the volume is to be 450 cubic inches, what should its height be?
(c)
If the volume is to be 825 cubic inches, what should its height
be?
(a)
The height is 6 inches, so h ¼ 6. Then V ¼ 100h becomes V ¼

The box’s volume is 600 cubic inches.

Many problems require the student to use common sense to solve them—that
is, mathematical reasoning. For instance, when a problem refers to consecu-
tive integers, the student is expected to realize that any two consecutive
integers diﬀer by one. If two numbers are consecutive, normally x is set
equal to the ﬁrst and x þ 1, the second.
Examples
The sum of two consecutive integers is 25. What are the numbers?
Let x ¼ ﬁrst number.
x þ 1 ¼ second number
Their sum is 25, so x þ ðx þ 1Þ ¼ 25.

The sum of two numbers is 70. One number is eight more than the

Problems such as this are similar to the above in that we are looking
for two or more numbers and we have a little information about how far
apart the numbers are. In the problems above, the numbers diﬀered by
one. Here, two numbers diﬀer by eight.
Let x ¼ ﬁrst number. (The term ‘‘ﬁrst’’ is used because it is the ﬁrst
number we are looking for; it is not necessarily the ‘‘ﬁrst’’ in order.) The
other number is eight more than this, so x þ 8 represents the other
number. Their sum is 70, so x þ ðx þ 8Þ ¼ 70:

CHAPTER 8

If the diﬀerence between two numbers is 13, then one of the numbers
is 13 more than the other. The statement ‘‘The diﬀerence between two
numbers is 13,’’ could have been given as, ‘‘One number is 13 more than
the other.’’ As before, let x represent the ﬁrst number. Then, x þ 13
represents the other. ‘‘Twice the smaller’’ means ‘‘2x’’ (x is the smaller
quantity because the other quantity is 13 more than x). Three times the
larger number is 3ðx þ 13Þ. ‘‘Twice the smaller plus three times the
larger is 129’’ becomes 2x þ 3ðx þ 13Þ ¼ 129.

Let x represent the smaller number. How can we represent the larger

We know that the sum of the smaller number and larger
number is 14. Let ‘‘?’’ represent the larger number and we’ll get ‘‘?’’
in terms of x.
The smaller number plus the larger number is 14.

Algebra students are often asked to compute people’s ages. The steps in
solving such problems are usually the same as those used above.
Examples
Jill is twice as old as Jim and Jim is three years older than Ken. The sum
of their ages is 61. What are their ages?
Three quantities are being compared, so ﬁnd one age and relate the
other two ages to it. Ken’s age is being compared to Jim’s and Jim’s to
Jill’s. The easiest route to take is to let x represent Jim’s age. We can
write Jill’s age in terms of Jim’s age: 2x. Jim is three years older than
Ken, so Ken is three years younger than Jim. This makes Ken’s age as

order to yield an average of 85?
Even though there will be a total of six grades, the last one will count
twice as much as the others, so it is like having a total of seven grades;
that is, the divisor needs to be seven. Let x represent the next grade.

Coin problems are also common algebra applications. Usually the total
number of coins is given as well as the total dollar value. The question is
normally ‘‘How many of each coin is there?’’
Let x represent the number of one speciﬁc coin and put the number of
other coins in terms of x. The steps involved are:
1.
Let x represent the number of a speciﬁc coin;
2.
Write the number of other coins in terms of x (this skill was devel-
oped in the ‘‘age’’ problems);
3.
Multiply the value of the coin by its number; this gives the total
amount of money represented by each coin;
4.
Add all of the terms obtained in Step 3 and set equal to the total
money value;
5.
Solve for x;
6.
Answer the question. Don’t forget this step! It is easy to feel like you
are done when you have solved for x, but sometimes the answer to
the question requires one more step.

Examples
As in all word problems, units of measure must be consistent. In the
following problems, this means that all money will need to be in terms
of dollars or in terms of cents. In the examples that follow, dollars will
be used.
Terri has $13.45 in dimes and quarters. If there are 70 coins in all, how
many of each coin does she have?
Let x represent the number of dimes. Because the number of dimes
and quarters is 70, 70  x represents the number of quarters. Terri
has x dimes, so she has $0.10x in dimes. She has 70  x quarters, so
she has $0:25ð70  xÞ in quarters. These two amounts must sum to
$13.45.

Bobbie has $1.54 in quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. He has twice
as many dimes as quarters and three times as many nickels as dimes.
The number of pennies is the same as the number of dimes. How many
of each coin does he have?
Nickels are being compared to dimes, and dimes are being compared
to quarters, so we will let x represent the number of quarters. Bobbie
has twice as many dimes as quarters, so 2x is the number of dimes he
has. He has three times as many nickels as dimes, namely triple 2x:
3ð2xÞ ¼ 6x. He has the same number of pennies as dimes, so he has
2x pennies.
How much of the total $1.54 does Bobbie have in each coin? He has
x quarters, each worth $0.25, so he has a total of 0.25x (dollars) in
CHAPTER 8

quarters. He has 2x dimes, each worth $0.10; this gives him 0:10ð2xÞ ¼
0:20x (dollars) in dimes. Bobbie has 6x nickels, each worth $0.05. The
total amount of money in nickels, then, is 0:05ð6xÞ ¼ 0:30x (dollars).
Finally, he has 2x pennies, each worth $0.01. The pennies count as
0:01ð2xÞ ¼ 0:02x (dollars).

A vending machine has $19.75 in dimes and quarters. There are 100
coins in all. How many dimes and quarters are in the machine?
2.
Ann has $2.25 in coins. She has the same number of quarters as
dimes. She has half as many nickels as quarters. How many of each
coin does she have?
3.
Sue has twice as many quarters as nickels and half as many dimes as
nickels. If she has a total of $4.80, how many of each coin does she

Some money problems involve one quantity divided into two investments
paying diﬀerent interest rates. Such questions are phrased ‘‘How much was
invested at ___%?’’ or ‘‘How much was invested at each rate?’’
Examples
A woman had $10,000 to invest. She deposited her money into two
accounts—one paying 6% interest and the other 71
2% interest. If at
the end of the year the total interest earned was $682.50, how much
was originally deposited in each account?
You could either let x represent the amount deposited at 6% or at
71
2%. Here, we will let x represent the amount deposited into the 6%
account. Because the two amounts must sum to 10,000, 10,000  x is
the amount deposited at 71
2%. The amount of interest earned at 6% is
0.06x, and the amount of interest earned at 71
2% is 0.075(10,000  x).
The
total
amount
of
interest
is
$682.50,
so
0:06x þ 0:075(10,000  xÞ ¼ 682:50.

The woman deposited $4500 in the 6% account and 10,000  x ¼
10;000  4500 ¼ $5500 in the 71

1.
A businessman invested $50,000 into two funds which yielded
proﬁts of 161
2% and 18%. If the total proﬁt was $8520, how
much was invested in each fund?
2.
A college student deposited $3500 into two savings accounts, one
with an annual yield of 43
4% and the other with an annual yield of
51
4%. If he earned $171.75 total interest the ﬁrst year, how much was
deposited in each account?
3.
A banker plans to lend $48,000 at a simple interest rate of 16% and
the remainder at 19%. How should she allot the loans in order to
obtain a return of 181
2%?
Solutions
1.
Let x represent the amount invested at 161
2%. Then 50,000  x
represents the amount invested at 18%. The proﬁt from the 161
2%
account is 0.165x, and the proﬁt from the 18% investment is
0:18ð50;000  xÞ. The sum of the proﬁts is $8520.

Let x represent the amount deposited at 43

deposited at 51

0.0475x; the interest earned at 51

Mixture problems involve mixing two diﬀerent concentrations to obtain
some concentration in between. Often these problems are stated as alcohol
or acid solutions, but there are many more types. For example, you might
want to know how many pure peanuts should be mixed with a 40% pea-
nut mixture to obtain a 50% peanut mixture. You might have a two-cycle
engine requiring a particular oil and gas mixture. Or, you might have a
recipe calling for 1% fat milk and all you have on hand is 2% fat milk
and 1
2% fat milk. These problems can be solved using the method illu-
strated below.
CHAPTER 8
Linear Applications
235

There will be three quantities—the two concentrations being mixed
together and the ﬁnal concentration. One of the three quantities will be a
ﬁxed number. Let the variable represent one of the two concentrations being
mixed The other unknown quantity will be written as some combination of
the variable and the ﬁxed quantity. If one of the quantities being mixed is
known, then let x represent the other quantity being mixed and the ﬁnal
solution will be ‘‘x þ known quantity.’’ If the ﬁnal solution is known,
again let x represent one of the quantities being mixed, the other quantity
being mixed will be of the form ‘‘ﬁnal solution quantity  x.’’
For example, in the following problem, the amount of one of the two
concentrations being mixed will be known.
‘‘How many liters of 10% acid solution should be mixed with 75 liters of
30% acid solution to yield a 25% acid solution?’’ Let x represent the number
of liters of 10% acid solution. Then x þ 75 will represent the number of liters
of the ﬁnal solution. If the problem were stated, ‘‘How many liters of 10%
acid solution and 30% solution should be mixed together with to produce
100 liters of 25% solution?’’ We can let x represent either the number of liters
of 10% solution or 30% solution. We will let x represent the number of liters
of 10% solution. How do we represent the number of liters of 30% solution?
For the moment, let ‘‘?’’ represent the number of liters of 30% solution. We
know that the ﬁnal solution must be 100 liters, so the two amounts have to
sum to 100: x þ ? ¼ 100.
x þ ?
x
¼ 100
x
? ¼ 100  x
Now we see that 100  x represents the number of liters of 30% solution.
Draw three boxes. Write the percentages given above the boxes and
the volume inside the boxes. Multiply the percentages (converted to deci-
mal numbers) and the volumes. Write these quantities below the boxes;
this will give you the equation to solve. Incidentally, when you multiply
the percent by the volume, you are getting the volume of pure acid/
alcohol/milk-fat/etc.
Examples
How much 10% acid solution should be added to 30 liters of 25% acid
solution to achieve a 15% solution?
Let x represent the amount of 10% solution. Then the total amount
of solution will be 30 þ x.

Work Problems
Work problems are another staple of algebra courses. A work problem
is normally stated as two workers (two people, machines, hoses, drains,
etc.) working together and working separately to complete a task. Often
one worker performs faster than the other. Sometimes the problem
states how fast each can complete the task alone and you are asked
to ﬁnd how long it takes for them to complete the task together. At
other times, you are told how long one worker takes to complete the
task alone and how long it takes for both to work together to complete
it; you are asked how long the second worker would take to complete
the task alone. The formula is quantity (work done—usually ‘‘1’’) ¼ rate
times time: Q ¼ rt. The method outlined below will help you solve
most, if not all, work problems. The following chart is useful in solving
these problems.

CHAPTER 8

There are four equations in this chart. One of them will be the one you will
use to solve for the unknown. Each horizontal line in the chart represents the
equation Q ¼ rt for that particular line. The fourth equation comes from the
sum of each worker’s rate set equal to the together rate. Often, the fourth
equation is the one you will need to solve. Remember, as in all word
problems, that all units of measure must be consistent.
Examples
Joe takes 45 minutes to mow a lawn. His older brother Jerry takes 30
minutes to mow the lawn. If they work together, how long will it take
for them to mow the lawn?
The quantity in each of the three cases is 1—there is one yard to be
mowed. Use the formula Q ¼ rt and the data given in the problem to ﬁll
in all nine boxes. Because we are looking for the time (in minutes) it
takes for them to mow the lawn together, let t represent the number of
minutes needed to mow the lawn together.

Because Q ¼ rt, r ¼ Q=t. But Q ¼ 1, so r ¼ 1=t. This makes Joe’s rate
1/45 and Jerry’s rate 1/30. The together rate is 1=t.

Some work problems require part of the work being performed by one
worker before the other worker joins in, or both start the job and one
ﬁnishes the job. In these cases, the together quantity and one of the
individual quantities will not be ‘‘1.’’ Take the time the one worker
works alone divided by the time that worker requires to do the job
alone, then subtract from 1. This is the proportion left over for both to
work together.

Jerry needs 40 minutes to mow the lawn. Lou can mow the same lawn in
30 minutes. If Jerry works alone for 10 minutes then Lou joins in, how

Distance Problems
Another common word problem type is the distance problem, sometimes
called the uniform rate problem. The underlying formula is d ¼ rt (distance
equals rate times time). From d ¼ rt, we get two other relationships: r ¼ d=t
and t ¼ d=r. These problems come in many forms: two bodies traveling in
opposite directions, two bodies traveling in the same direction, two bodies
traveling away from each other or toward each other at right angles.
Sometimes the bodies leave at the same time, sometimes one gets a head
start. Usually they are traveling at diﬀerent rates, or speeds. As in all applied
problems, the units of measure must be consistent throughout the problem.
For instance, if your rates are given to you in miles per hour and your time is
given in minutes, you should convert minutes to hours. You could convert
miles per hour into miles per minute, but this would be awkward.
Examples
When the bodies move in the same direction, the rate at which the
distance between them is changing is the diﬀerence between their rates.
A cyclist starts at a certain point and rides at a rate of 10 mph. Twelve
minutes later, another cyclist starts from the same point in the same
direction and rides at 16 mph. How long will it take for the second
cyclist to catch up with the ﬁrst?
When the second cyclist begins, the ﬁrst has traveled 10ð12
60Þ ¼ 2 miles.
The ‘‘10’’ is the rate and the ‘‘12
60’’ is the twelve minutes converted to
hours. Because the cyclists are moving in the same direction, the rate at
which the distance between them is shrinking is 16  10 ¼ 6 mph. Then,
the question boils down to ‘‘How long will it take for something travel-
ing 6 mph to cover 2 miles?’’
Let t represent the number of hours the second cyclist is traveling.

A car passes an intersection heading north at 40 mph. Another car
passes the same intersection 15 minutes later heading north traveling
at 45 mph. How long will it take for the second car to overtake the
ﬁrst?
In 15 minutes, the ﬁrst car has traveled 40ð15
60Þ ¼ 10 miles. The second
car is gaining on the ﬁrst at a rate of 45  40 ¼ 5 mph. So the question
becomes ‘‘How long will it take a body traveling 5 mph to cover 10
miles?’’
Let t represent the number of hours the second car has traveled after
passing the intersection.

When two bodies are moving in opposite directions, whether towards each
other or away from each other, the rate at which the distance between them is
changing, whether growing larger or smaller, is the sum of their individual
rates.

For distance problems in which the bodies are moving away from each other
or toward each other at right angles (for example, one heading east, the other
north), the Pythagorean Theorem is used. This topic will be covered in the
last chapter.
CHAPTER 8

Some distance problems involve the complication of the two bodies start-
ing at diﬀerent times. For these, you need to compute the head start of the
ﬁrst one and let t represent the time they are both moving (which is the same
as the amount of time the second is moving). Subtract the head start from the
distance in question then proceed as if they started at the same time.
Examples
A car driving eastbound passes through an intersection at 6:00 at the
rate of 30 mph. Another car driving westbound passes through the same
intersection ten minutes later at the rate of 35 mph. When will the cars
be 18 miles apart?
The eastbound driver has a 10-minute head start. In 10 minutes (10
60
hours), that driver has traveled 30ð10
60Þ ¼ 5 miles. So when the westbound
driver passes the intersection, there is already 5 miles between them, so
the question is now ‘‘How long will it take for there to be 18  5 ¼ 13
miles between two bodies moving away from each other at the rate of
30 þ 35 ¼ 65 mph?’’
Let t represent the number of hours after the second car has passed
the intersection.

In 1

them. So 12 minutes after the second car passes the intersection, there
will be a total of 18 miles between the cars. That is, at 6:22 the cars will
be 18 miles apart.
Two employees ride their bikes to work. At 10:00 one leaves work and

for an additional 5  3

Two boys are 1250 meters apart when one begins walking toward the
other. If one walks at a rate of 2 meters per second and the other,
who starts walking toward the ﬁrst boy four minutes later, walks at
the rate of 1.5 meters per second, how long will it take for them to
meet?
The boy with the head start has walked for 4ð60Þ ¼ 240 seconds.
(Because the rate is given in meters per second, all times will be con-
verted to seconds.) So, he has traveled 240ð2Þ ¼ 480 meters. At the time
the other boy begins walking, there remains 1250  480 ¼ 770 meters to
cover. When the second boy begins to walk, they are moving toward one
another at the rate of 2 þ 1:5 ¼ 3:5 meters per second. The question
becomes ‘‘How long will it take a body moving 3.5 meters per second to
travel 770 meters?’’
Let t represent the number of seconds the second boy walks.
3:5t ¼ 770
t ¼ 770

The boys will meet 220 seconds, or 3 minutes 40 seconds, after the

In 9 minutes the ﬁrst plane has ﬂown 200ð 9

There are some distance/rate problems for which there are three unknowns.
You must reduce the number of unknowns to one. The clues on how to do so
are given in the problem.
Examples
A semi-truck traveled from City A to City B at 50 mph. On the return
trip, it averaged only 45 mph and took 15 minutes longer. How far is it
from City A to City B?

CHAPTER 8
Linear Applications
272
There are three unknowns—the distance between City A and City B,
the time spent traveling from City A to City B, and the time spent
traveling from City B to City A. We must eliminate two of these
unknowns. Let t represent the number of hours spent on the trip
from City A to City B. We know that it took 15 minutes longer traveling
from City B to City A (the return trip), so t þ 15
60 represents the number
of hours traveling from City B to City A. We also know that the dis-
tance from City A to City B is the same as from City B to City A. Let d
represent the distance between the two cities. We now have the follow-
ing two equations.
From City A to City B:
From City B to City A:
d ¼ 50t
d ¼ 45ðt þ 15
60Þ
But if the distance between them is the same, then 50t ¼ Distance from
City A to City B is equal to the distance from City B to City
A ¼ 45ðt þ 15
60Þ. Therefore,
50t ¼ 45 t þ 15

We now know the time, but the problem asked for the distance. The

d ¼ 50t,
so
d ¼ 50ð9
4Þ ¼ 225

2. The cities are 1121

Another approach to this problem would be to let t represent the number
of hours the semi spent traveling from City B to City A. Then t  15
60 would

she rode to the library at the rate of 10 mph and home from the library
at the rate of 12 mph, how far is her house from the library?

Again there are three unknowns—the distance between Kaye’s house
and the library, the time spent riding to the library and the time spent
riding home. Let t represent the number of hours spent riding to the
library. She spent 5 minutes less riding home, so t  5
60 represents the
number of hours spent riding home. Let d represent the distance
between Kaye’s house and the library.
The trip to the library is given by d ¼ 10t, and the trip home is given
by
d ¼ 12ðt  5

Geometric Figures
Algebra problems involving geometric ﬁgures are very common. In algebra,
you normally deal with rectangles, triangles, and circles. On occasion, you will
be asked to solve problems involving other shapes like right circular cylinders
and right circular cones. If you master solving the more common types of
geometric problems, you will ﬁnd that the more exotic shapes are just as easy.
In many of these problems, you will have several unknowns which you
must reduce to one unknown. In the problems above, you reduced a problem
of three unknowns to one unknown by relating one quantity to another (the
time on one direction related to the time on the return trip) and by setting the
equal distances equal to each other. We will use similar techniques here.
Example
A rectangle is 11
2 times as long as it is wide. The perimeter is 100 cm2.
Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by P ¼ 2l þ 2w.
We are told the perimeter is 100, so the equation now becomes
100 ¼ 2l þ 2w. We are also told that the length is 11
2 times the width,
so l ¼ 1:5w. We can substitute this l into the equation: 100 ¼ 2l
þ2w ¼ 2ð1:5wÞ þ 2w.
We
have
reduced
an
equation
with
three
unknowns to one with a single unknown.
100 ¼ 2ð1:5wÞ þ 2w
100 ¼ 3w þ 2w
100 ¼ 5w
100
5 ¼ w

The width is 20 cm and the length is 1:5w ¼ 1:5ð20Þ ¼ 30 cm.

A box’s width is 2

What are the box’s length and width?
2.
A rectangular yard is twice as long as it is wide. The perimeter is 120
feet. What are the yard’s dimensions?

Solutions
1.
The perimeter of the box is 40 inches, so P ¼ 2l þ 2w becomes
40 ¼ 2l þ 2w. The width is
2
3 its length, and w ¼ ð2l=3Þ, so
40 ¼ 2l þ 2w becomes 40 ¼ 2l þ 2ð2l=3Þ ¼ 2l þ ð4l=3Þ.

2.
The perimeter of the yard is 120 feet, so P ¼ 2l þ 2w becomes
120 ¼ 2l þ 2w. The length is twice the width, so l ¼ 2w, and
120 ¼ 2l þ 2w becomes 120 ¼ 2ð2wÞ þ 2w.

The yard’s width is 20 feet and its length is 2l ¼ 2ð20Þ ¼ 40 feet.
Some geometric problems involve changing one or more dimensions. In the
following problems, one or more dimensions are changed and you are given
information about how this change has aﬀected the ﬁgure’s area. Next you
will decide how the two areas are related Then you will be able to reduce
your problem from several unknowns to just one.
Example
A rectangle is twice as long as it is wide. If the length is decreased by 4
inches and its width is decreased by 3 inches, the area is decreased by 88
square inches. Find the original dimensions.
CHAPTER 8

The area formula for a rectangle is A ¼ lw. Let A represent the original
area; l, the original length; and w, the original width. We know that the
original length is twice the original width, so l ¼ 2w and A ¼ lw becomes
A ¼ 2ww ¼ 2w2. The new length is l  4 ¼ 2w  4 and the new width is
w  3, so the new area is ð2w  4Þðw  3Þ. But the new area is also 88
square inches less than the old area, so A  88 represents the new area,
also. We then have for the new area, A  88 ¼ ð2w  4Þðw  3Þ. But
the A can be replaced with 2w2. We now have the equation
2w2  88 ¼ ð2w  4Þðw  3Þ, an equation with one unknown.
2w2  88 ¼ ð2w  4Þðw  3Þ

The width of the original rectangle is 10 inches and its length is 2w ¼
2ð10Þ ¼ 20 inches.
A square’s length is increased by 3 cm, which causes its area to increase
by 33 cm2. What is the length of the original square?
A square’s length and width are the same, so the area formula for the
square is A ¼ ll ¼ l2. Let l represent the original length. The new length
is l þ 3. The original area is A ¼ l2 and its new area is ðl þ 3Þ2. The new
area is also the original area plus 33, so ðl þ 3Þ2 ¼ new area ¼ A þ 33 ¼
l2 þ 33.
We
now

the

A rectangular piece of cardboard starts out with its width being
three-fourths its length. Four inches are cut oﬀits length and two
inches from its width. The area of the cardboard is 72 square inches
smaller than before it was trimmed What was its original length
and width?
2.
A rectangle’s length is one-and-a-half times its width. The length is
increased by 4 inches and its width by 3 inches. The resulting area is
97 square inches more than the original rectangle. What were the
original dimensions?
Solutions
1.
Let l represent the original length and w, the original width.
The original area is A ¼ lw. The new length is l  4 and the
new width is w  2. The new area is then ðl  4Þðw  2Þ. But
the new area is 72 square inches smaller than the original area,
so ðl  4Þðw  2Þ ¼ A  72 ¼ lw  72. So far, we have ðl  4Þ
ðw  2Þ ¼ lw  72.

the new width is w þ 3. The new area is now ðl þ 4Þðw þ 3Þ. But
the new area is also the old area plus 97 square inches, so
A þ 97 ¼ ðl þ 4Þðw þ 3Þ. But A ¼ lw, so A þ 97 becomes lw þ 97.

Linear Inequalities
The solution to algebraic inequalities consists of a range (or ranges) of num-
bers. The solution to linear inequalities will be of the form x < a, x 
 a,
x > a, or x 	 a, where a is a number. The inequality x < a means all numbers
smaller than a but not including a; x 
 a means all numbers smaller than a
including a itself. Similarly the inequality x > a means all numbers larger
than a but not a itself, and x 	 a means all numbers larger than a including a
itself.
The solutions to some algebra and calculus problems are inequalities.
Sometimes you will be asked to shade these inequalities on the real number
line and sometimes you will be asked to give your solution in interval nota-
tion. Every interval on the number line can be represented by an inequality
and every inequality is represented by an interval on the number line. First
we will represent inequalities by shaded regions on the number line. Later we
will represent inequalities by intervals.
The inequality x < a is represented on the number line by shading to the
left of the number a with an open dot at a.
A closed dot is used for x 
 a:

Linear inequalities are solved much the same way as linear equations with
one exception: when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a
negative number the inequality sign must be reversed For example 2 < 3 but
2 > 3. Adding and subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an
inequality never changes the direction of the inequality sign.

The symbol for inﬁnity is ‘‘1,’’ and ‘‘1’’ is the symbol for negative inﬁnity.
These symbols mean that the numbers in the interval are getting larger in the
positive or negative direction. The intervals for the previous examples and
practice problems are called inﬁnite intervals.
An interval consists of, in order, an open parenthesis ‘‘(’’ or open bracket
‘‘[,’’ a number or ‘‘1,’’ a comma, a number or ‘‘1,’’
and a closing
parenthesis ‘‘)’’ or closing bracket ‘‘].’’
A parenthesis is used for strict
inequalities (x < a and x > a) and a bracket is used for an ‘‘or equal to’’
inequality (x 
 a and x 	 a). A parenthesis is always used next to an inﬁnity
symbol.

Applications
Linear inequality word problems are solved much the same way as linear
equality word problems. There are two important diﬀerences. Multiplying
and dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative quantity requires that
the sign reverse. You must also decide which inequality sign to use: <, >, 
,
and 	. The following tables should help.
A < B
A > B
A is less than B
A is greater than B
A is smaller than B
A is larger than B
B is greater than A
B is less than A
B is larger than A
A is more than B

A is less than or equal to B

B is at least A
A is at least B
B is A or more
A is B or more
A is no greater than B
B is no greater than A
B is no less than A
A is no less than B
Some word problems give two alternatives and ask for what interval of the
variable is one alternative more attractive than the other. If the alternative is
between two costs, for example, in order for the cost of A to be more
attractive than the cost of B, solve ‘‘Cost of A < Cost of B.’’ If the cost
of A to be no more than the cost of B (also the cost of A to be at least as
attractive as the cost of B), solve ‘‘Cost of A 
 Cost of B.’’ If the alternative
CHAPTER 9
Linear Inequalities
293

is between two incomes of some kind, for the income of A to be more
attractive than the income of B, solve ‘‘Income of A > Income of B.’’ If
the income of A is to be at least as attractive as the income of B (also the
income of A to be no less attractive than the income of B), solve ‘‘Income of
A 	 Income of B.’’
Some of the following examples and practice problems are business prob-
lems. Let us review a few business formulas. Revenue is normally the price
per unit times the number of units sold For instance if an item sells for $3.25
each and x represents the number of units sold, the revenue is represented by
3.25x (dollars). Cost tends to consist of overhead costs (sometimes called
ﬁxed costs) and production costs (sometimes called variable costs). The over-
head costs will be a ﬁxed number (no variable). The production costs is
usually computed as the cost per unit times the number of units sold. The
total cost is usually the overhead costs plus the production costs. Proﬁt is
revenue minus cost. If a problem asks how many units must be sold to make
a proﬁt, solve ‘‘Revenue > Total Cost.’’
Examples
A manufacturing plant, which produces compact disks, has monthly
overhead costs of $6000. Each disk costs 18 cents to produce and sells
for 30 cents. How many disks must be sold in order for the plant to
make a proﬁt?
Let x ¼ number of CDs produced and sold monthly
Cost ¼ 6000 þ 0:18x and Revenue ¼ 0:30x

The plant should produce and sell more than 50,000 CDs per month in
order to make a proﬁt.

Double Inequalities
Double inequalities represent bounded regions on the number line. The
double inequality a < x < b means all real numbers between a and b, where

a is the smaller number and b is the larger number. All double inequalities are
of the form a < x < b where one or both of the ‘‘<’’ signs might be replaced
by ‘‘
.’’ Keep in mind, though, that ‘‘a < x < b’’ is the same as ‘‘b > x > a.’’
An inequality such as 10 < x < 5 is never true because no number x is both
larger than 10 and smaller than 5. In other words an inequality in the form
‘‘larger number < x < smaller number’’ is meaningless.
The following table shows the number line region and interval notation for
each type of double inequality.

CHAPTER 10
Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation is one that can be put in the form ax2 þ bx þ c ¼ 0
where a, b, and c are numbers and a is not zero (b and/or c might be zero).
For instance 3x2 þ 7x ¼ 4 is a quadratic equation.
3x2 þ 7x
4
¼ 4
4
3x2 þ 7x  4 ¼ 0
In this example a ¼ 3, b ¼ 7, and c ¼ 4.
There are two main approaches to solving these equations. One approach
uses the fact that if the product of two numbers is zero, at least one of the
numbers must be zero. In other words, wz ¼ 0 implies w ¼ 0 or z ¼ 0 (or
both w ¼ 0 and z ¼ 0.) To use this fact on a quadratic equation ﬁrst make
sure that one side of the equation is zero and factor the other side. Set each
factor equal to zero then solve for x.
Examples
x2 þ 2x  3 ¼ 0
x2 þ 2x  3 can be factored as ðx þ 3Þðx  1Þ
x2 þ 2x  3 ¼ 0 becomes ðx þ 3Þðx  1Þ ¼ 0

Not all quadratic expressions will be as easy to factor as the previous
examples and problems were. Sometimes you will need to multiply or divide
both sides of the equation by a number. Because zero multiplied or divided
by any nonzero number is still zero, only one side of the equation will
change. Keep in mind that not all quadratic expressions can be factored
using rational numbers (fractions) or even real numbers. Fortunately there
is another way of solving quadratic equations, which bypasses the factoring
method.
Examples
The equation x2 þ 4x  3 ¼ 0 is awkward to factor because of the
negative sign in front of x2. Multiply both sides of the equation by 1
then factor.

Decimals and fractions in a quadratic equation can be eliminated in the
same way. Multiply both sides of the equation by a power of 10 to
eliminate decimal points. Multiply both sides of the equation by the
LCD to eliminate fractions.

can be used to solve
quadratic equations. For instance, if x2 ¼ 9, then x ¼ 3 or 3 because 32 ¼ 9

memorizing. You might wonder why we bother factoring quadratic expres-
sions to solve quadratic equations when the quadratic formula will work.
There are two reasons. One, factoring is an important skill in algebra and
calculus. Two, factoring is often easier and faster than computing the quad-
ratic formula. The quadratic formula is normally used to solve quadratic
equations where the factoring is diﬃcult.
Before the formula can be used, the quadratic equation must be in the
form ax2 þ bx þ c ¼ 0. Once a, b, and c are identiﬁed, applying the quadratic
formula is simply a matter of performing arithmetic.

The quadratic formula can be messy to compute when any of a, b, or c
are fractions or decimals. You can get around this by multiplying both
sides of the equation by the least common denominator or some power
of ten.

The denominator is divisible by 2 and each term in the numerator is
divisible by 2, so factor 2 from each term in the numerator. Next use this
2 to cancel the 2 in the denominator.

CHAPTER 10
Quadratic Equations

Rational Equations
Some rational equations (an equation with one or more fractions as terms)
become quadratic equations once each term has been multiplied by the least
common denominator. Remember, you must be sure that any solutions do
not lead to a zero in any denominator in the original equation.
There are two main approaches to clearing the denominator(s) in a
rational equation. If the equation is in the form of ‘‘fraction ¼ fraction,’’
cross multiply. If the equation is not in this form, ﬁnd the least common
denominator (LCD). Finding the least common denominator often means
you need to factor each denominator completely. We learned in Chapter 7 to
multiply both sides of the LCD, then to distribute the LCD. In this chapter
we will simply multiply each term on each side of the equation by the LCD. If
the new equation is a quadratic equation, collect all terms on one side of the
equal sign and leave a zero on the other. In the examples and practice
problems below, the solutions that lead to a zero in a denominator will be
stated.
Examples
x  1
x2  2x  8 ¼ 2

cross multiply.

Because all of these problems factor, factoring is used in the solutions. If
factoring takes too long on some of these, you may use the quadratic
formula.

Applications
Most of the problems in this chapter are not much diﬀerent from the word
problems in previous chapters. The only diﬀerence is that quadratic equa-
tions are used to solve them. Because quadratic equations usually have two
solutions, some of these applied problems will have two solutions. Most will
have only one—one of the ‘‘solutions’’ will be invalid. More often than not,
the invalid solutions are easy to recognize.
Examples
The product of two consecutive positive numbers is 240. Find the num-
bers.
Let x represent the ﬁrst number. Because the numbers are consecutive,
the next number is one more than the ﬁrst: x þ 1 represents the next
number. The product of these two numbers is xðx þ 1Þ, which equals 240.
xðx þ 1Þ ¼ 240
x2 þ x ¼ 240

The product of two consecutive even numbers is 528. What are the

Let x represent the ﬁrst number. If x diﬀers from the other number by

matter which representation you use. We will work this problem with
both representations.

Revenue
A common business application of quadratic equations occurs when raising a
price results in lower sales or lowering a price results in higher sales. The
obvious question is what to charge to bring in the most revenue. This pro-
blem is addressed in Algebra II and Calculus. The problem addressed here is
ﬁnding a price that would bring in a particular revenue.
The problem involves raising (or lowering) a price by a certain number of
increments and sales decreasing (or increasing) by a certain amount for each
incremental change in the price. For instance, suppose for each increase of
$10 in the price, two customers are lost. The price and sales level both depend
on the number of $10 increases. If the price is increased by $10, two customers
are lost. If the price is increased by $20, 2ð2Þ ¼ 4 customers will be lost. If the
price is increased by $30, 2ð3Þ ¼ 6 customers will be lost. If the price does not
change, 2ð0Þ ¼ 0 customers will be lost. The variable will represent the num-
ber of incremental increases (or decreases) of the price.
The revenue formula is R ¼ PQ where R represents the revenue, P repre-
sents the price, and Q represents the number sold. If the price is increased,
then P will equal the current price plus the variable times the increment. If the
price is decreased, then P will equal the current price minus the variable times
the increment. If the sales level is decreased, then Q will equal the current
sales level minus the variable times the incremental loss. If the sales level is
increased, then Q will equal the current sales level plus the variable times the
incremental gain.
Examples
A department store sells 20 portable stereos per week at $80 each. The
manager believes that for each decrease of $5 in the price, six more
stereos will be sold.
Let x represent the number of $5 decreases in the price. Then the
price will decrease by 5x:

P ¼ 80  5x:
The sales level will increase by six for each $5 decrease in the price—the
sales level will increase by 6x:
Q ¼ 20 þ 6x:
R ¼ PQ becomes R ¼ ð80  5xÞð20 þ 6xÞ.
A rental company manages an oﬃce complex with 16 oﬃces. Each oﬃce
can be rented if the monthly rent is $1000. For each $200 increase in the
rent, one tenant will be lost.
Let x represent the number of $200 increases in the rent.
P ¼ 1000 þ 200x
Q ¼ 16  1x
R ¼ ð1000 þ 200xÞð16  xÞ
A grocery store sells 300 pounds of bananas each day when they are
priced at 45 cents per pound. The produce manager observes that for
each 5-cent decrease in the price per pound of bananas, an additional 50
pounds are sold.
Let x represent the number of 5-cent decreases in the rent.
P ¼ 45  5x
Q ¼ 300 þ 50x
R ¼ ð45  5xÞð300 þ 5xÞ
(The revenue will be in cents instead of dollars.)
A music storeowner sells 60 newly released CDs per day when the price
is $12 per CD. For each $1.50 decrease in the price, the store will sell an
additional 16 CDs each week.
Let x represent the number of $1.50 decreases in the price.
P ¼ 12:00  1:50x
Q ¼ 60 þ 16x
R ¼ ð12:00  1:50xÞð60 þ 16xÞ
Practice
Let x represent the number of increases/decreases in the price.

Now that we can set up these problems, we are ready to solve them. For each
of the previous examples and problems, a desired revenue will be given. We
will set that revenue equal to the revenue equation. This will be a quadratic
equation. Some of these equations will be solved by factoring, others by the
quadratic formula. Some problems will have more than one solution.
Examples

The owner of an apartment complex knows he can rent all 50
apartments when the monthly rent is $400. He thinks that for
each $25 increase in the rent, he will lose two tenants. What should
the rent be for the revenue to be $20,400?
2.
A grocery store sells 4000 gallons of milk per week when the price
is $2.80 per gallon. Customer research indicates that for each
$0.10 decrease in the price, 200 more gallons of milk will be
sold. What does the price need to be so that weekly milk sales
reach $11,475?
3.
A movie theater’s concession stand sells an average of 500 buckets
of popcorn each weekend when the price is $4 per bucket. The
manager knows from experience that for every $0.05 decrease in
the price, 20 more buckets of popcorn will be sold each weekend.
What should the price be so that $2450 worth of popcorn is sold?
How many buckets will be sold at this price (these prices)?
4.
An automobile repair shop performs 40 oil changes per day when
the price is $30. Industry research indicates that the shop will lose 5
customers for each $2 increase in the price. What would the shop
have to charge in order for the daily revenue from oil changes to be
$1120? How many oil changes will the shop perform each day?

Solve work problems by ﬁlling in the table below. In the work formula
Q ¼ rt ðQ ¼ quantity, r ¼ rate, and t ¼ time), Q is usually ‘‘1.’’ Usually
the equation to solve is
Worker 1’s Rate þ Worker 2’s Rate ¼ Together Rate.
The information given in the problem is usually the time one or both workers
need to complete the job. We want the rates not the times. We can solve for r
in Q ¼ rt to get the rates.

The Height of a Falling Object
The height of an object dropped, thrown or ﬁred can be computed using
quadratic equations. The general formula is h ¼ 16t2 þ v0t þ h0, where h is
the object’s height (in feet), t is time (in seconds), h0 is the object’s initial
height (that is, its height at t ¼ 0 seconds) and v0 is the object’s initial velocity
(that is, its speed at t ¼ 0 seconds) in feet per second. If the object is tossed,
thrown, or ﬁred upward, v0 is positive. If the object is thrown downward, v0
is negative. If the object is dropped, v0 is zero. The object reaches the ground
when h ¼ 0. (The eﬀect of air resistance is ignored.)
Typical questions are:
When will the object be ___ feet high?
When will the object reach the ground?
What is the object’s height after ____ seconds?
Examples
An object is dropped from a height of 1600 feet. How long will it take
for the object to hit the ground?
Because the object is dropped, the initial velocity, v0, is zero: v0 ¼ 0.
The object is dropped from a height of 1600 feet, so h0 ¼ 1600: The
formula h ¼ 16t2 þ v0t þ h0 becomes h ¼ 16t2 þ 1600. The object
hits
the
ground
when
h ¼ 0,
so
h ¼ 16t2 þ 1600

Distance Problems
There are several distance problems that quadratic equations can solve. One
of these types is ‘‘stream’’ problems: a vehicle travels the same distance up
and back where in one direction, the ‘‘stream’s’’ average speed is added to the
vehicle’s speed and in the other, the ‘‘stream’s’’ average speed is subtracted
from the vehicle’s speed. Another type involves two bodies moving away
from each other where their paths form a right angle (for instance, one travels
north and the other west). Finally, the last type is where a vehicle makes a
round trip that takes longer in one direction than in the other. In all of these
types, the formula D ¼ RT is key.
CHAPTER 11
Quadratic Applications

‘‘Stream’’ distance problems usually involve boats (traveling upstream or
downstream) and planes (traveling against a headwind or with a tailwind).
The boat or plane generally travels in one direction then turns around and
travels in the opposite direction. The distance upstream and downstream is
usually the same. If r represents the boat’s or plane’s average speed travel-
ing without the ‘‘stream,’’ then r þ stream’s speed represents the boat’s or
plane’s average speed traveling with the stream, and r  stream’s speed
represents the boat’s or plane’s average speed traveling against the stream.
Example
Miami and Pittsburgh are 1000 miles apart. A plane ﬂew into a 50-mph
headwind from Miami to Pittsburgh. On the return ﬂight the 50-mph
wind became a tailwind. The plane was in the air a total of 41
2 hours for
the round trip. What would have been the plane’s average speed without
the wind?
Let r represent the plane’s average speed (in mph) without the wind.
The plane’s average speed against the wind is r  50 (from Miami to
Pittsburgh) and the plane’s average speed with the wind is r þ 50 (from
Pittsburgh to Miami). The distance from Miami to Pittsburgh is 1000
miles. With this information we can use T ¼ D
R to compute the time in
the air in each direction. The time in the air from Miami to Pittsburgh is

In the following problems people are making a round trip. The average speed
in each direction will be diﬀerent and the total trip time will be given. The
equation to solve is
Time to destination þ Time on return trip ¼ Total trip time.
To get the time to and from the destination, use D ¼ RT and solve for T. The
equation to solve becomes
Distance
Rate to destination þ
Distance
Rate on return trip ¼ Total trip time.
Example
A jogger jogged seven miles to a park then jogged home. He jogged 1
mph faster to the park than he jogged on the way home. The round trip
took 2 hours 34 minutes. How fast did he jog to the park?
Let r represent the jogger’s average speed on the way home. He
jogged 1 mph faster to the park, so r þ 1 represents his average speed
to the park. The distance to the park is 7 miles, so D ¼ 7.

APPENDIX
Factoring is a skill that is developed with practice. The only sureﬁre way to
factor numbers into their prime factors is by trial and error. There are some
number facts that will make your job easier. Some of these facts should be
familiar.

If a number is even, the number is divisible by 2.

If a number ends in 0 or 5, the number is divisible by 5.

If a number ends in 0, the number is divisible by 10.

If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number is
divisible by 3.

If a number ends in 5 or 0 and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, then
the number is divisible by 15.

If a number is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, then the
number is divisible by 6.

If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number is
divisible by 9.

If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9 and the number is
even, then the number is divisible by 18.
Examples
126 is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by 9: 1 þ 2 þ 6 ¼ 9, so
126 is divisible by 18.
4545 is divisible by 5 and by 9 ð4 þ 5 þ 4 þ 5 ¼ 18 and 18 is divisible by 9).

To factor a number into its prime factors (those which have no divisors other
than themselves and 1), start with a list of prime numbers (a short list can be
found on the last page of this appendix). Begin with the smallest prime
number and keep dividing the prime numbers into the number to be factored.
It might be that a prime number divides a number more than once. Stop
dividing when the square of the prime number is larger than the number. The
previous list of number facts can help you ignore 2 when the number is not
even; 5 when does not end in 5; and 3 when the sum of its digits is not
divisible by 3.
Examples
120: The prime numbers to check are 2, 3, 5, 7. The list stops at 7
because 120 is smaller than 112 ¼ 121.
249: The prime numbers to check are 3, 7, 11, 13. The list does not
include 2 and 5 because 249 is not even and does not end in 5. The list
stops at 13 because 249 is smaller than 172 ¼ 289.
608: The prime numbers to check are 2, 7, 11, 13, 19, 23. The list does
not contain 3 because 6 þ 0 þ 8 ¼ 14 is not divisible by 3 and does not
contain 5 because 608 does not end in 5 or 0. The list stops at 23 because
608 is smaller than 292 ¼ 841:
342: The prime numbers to check are 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 17. The list does not
contain 5 because 342 does not end in 5 or 0. The list stops at 17 because
342 is smaller than 192 ¼ 361:

What happens if you need to factor something like 3185? Do you really need
all the primes up to 59? Maybe not. Try the smaller primes ﬁrst. More than
likely, one of them will divide the large number. Because 3185 ends in 5, it is
divisible by 5: 3185  5 ¼ 637. Now all that remains is to ﬁnd the prime
factors of 637, so the list of prime numbers to check stops at 23. The reason
this trick works is that a number will not divide 637 unless it also divides
3185. In other words, every divisor of 637 is a divisor of 3185. Once you
divide the large number, the list of prime numbers to check will be smaller.
