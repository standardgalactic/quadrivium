Preface
Dear Friends of Numbers:
This little book is for you. It should oﬀer an exquisite intel-
lectual enjoyment, which only relatively few fortunate people can
experience.
May these essays stimulate your curiosity and lead you to books
and articles where these matters are discussed at a more technical
level.
I warn you, however, that the problems treated, in spite of be-
ing easy to state, are for the most part very diﬃcult. Many are
still unsolved. You will see how mathematicians have attacked these
problems.
Brains at work! But do not blame me for sleepless nights (I have
mine already).
Several of the essays grew out of lectures given over the course of
years on my customary errances.
Other chapters could, but probably never will, become full-sized
books.
The diversity of topics shows the many guises numbers take to
tantalize∗and to demand a mobility of spirit from you, my reader,
who is already anxious to leave this preface.
Now go to page 1 (or 127?).

The Fibonacci Numbers and
the Arctic Ocean
Introduction
There is indeed not much relation between the Fibonacci numbers
and the Arctic Ocean, but I thought that this title would excite your
curiosity for my lecture. You will be disappointed if you wished to
hear about the Arctic Ocean, as my topic will be the sequence of
Fibonacci numbers and similar sequences.
Like the icebergs in the Arctic Ocean, the sequence of Fibonacci
numbers is the most visible part of a theory which goes deep: the
theory of linear recurring sequences.
The so-called Fibonacci numbers appeared in the solution of a
problem by Fibonacci (also known as Leonardo Pisano), in his
book Liber Abaci (1202), concerning reproduction patterns of rab-
bits. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant work on the subject is by Lucas, with his
seminal paper of 1878. Subsequently, there appeared the classical
papers of Bang (1886) and Zsigmondy (1892) concerning prime
divisions of special sequences of binomials. Carmichael (1913)
published another fundamental paper where he extended to Lucas se-
quences the results previously obtained in special cases. Since then, I
note the work of Lehmer, the applications of the theory in primality
tests giving rise to many developments.

2
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
The subject is very rich and I shall consider here only certain
aspects of it.
If, after all, your only interest is restricted to Fibonacci and Lucas
numbers, I advise you to read the booklets by Vorob’ev (1963),
Hoggatt (1969), and Jarden (1958).

Basic deﬁnitions
A.
Lucas sequences
Let P, Q be non-zero integers, let D = P 2 −4Q, be called the
discriminant, and assume that D ̸= 0 (to exclude a degenerate case).
Consider the polynomial X2 −PX + Q, called the characteristic
polynomial, which has the roots
α = P +
√
D
2
and
β = P −
√
D
2
.
Thus, α ̸= β, α + β = P, α · β = Q, and (α −β)2 = D.
For each n ≥0, deﬁne Un = Un(P, Q) and Vn = Vn(P, Q) as
follows:
U0=0 , U1=1 , Un=P · Un−1 −Q · Un−2
(for n ≥2),
V0=2 , V1=P , Vn=P · Vn−1 −Q · Vn−2
(for n ≥2).
The sequences U = (Un(P, Q))n≥0 and V = (Vn(P, Q))n≥0 are
called the (ﬁrst and second) Lucas sequences with parameters (P, Q).
(Vn(P, Q))n≥0 is also called the companion Lucas sequence with
parameters (P, Q).
It is easy to verify the following formal power series developments,
for any (P, Q):
X
1 −PX + QX2 =
∞

n=0
UnXn
and
2 −PX
1 −PX + QX2 =
∞

n=0
VnXn.
The Lucas sequences are examples of sequences of numbers
produced by an algorithm.
At the nth step, or at time n, the corresponding numbers are
Un(P, Q), respectively, Vn(P, Q). In this case, the algorithm is a linear

recurrence with two parameters. Once the parameters and the initial
values are given, the whole sequence—that is, its future values—is
completely determined. But, also, if the parameters and two consec-
utive values are given, all the past (and future) values are completely
determined.
B.
Special Lucas sequences
I shall repeatedly consider special Lucas sequences, which are im-
portant historically and for their own sake. These are the sequences
of Fibonacci numbers, of Lucas numbers, of Pell numbers, and other
sequences of numbers associated to binomials.
(a) Let P = 1, Q = −1, so D = 5. The numbers Un = Un(1, −1)
are called the Fibonacci numbers, while the numbers Vn = Vn(1, −1)
are called the Lucas numbers. Here are the initial terms of these
sequences:
Fibonacci numbers : 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, . . .
Lucas numbers
: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 99, 322, . . .
(b) Let P = 2, Q = −1, so D = 8. The numbers Un = Un(2, −1)
and Vn = Vn(2, −1) are the Pell numbers and the companion Pell
numbers. Here are the ﬁrst few terms of these sequences:
Un(2, −1): 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, . . .
Vn(2, −1): 2, 2, 6, 14, 34, 82, 198, 478, . . .
(c) Let a, b be integers such that a > b ≥1. Let P = a + b, Q = ab,
so D = (a −b)2. For each n ≥0, let Un = an−bn
a−b
and Vn = an + bn.
Then it is easy to verify that U0 = 0, U1 = 1, V0 = 2, V1 = a+b = P,
and (Un)n≥0, (Vn)n≥0 are the ﬁrst and second Lucas sequences with
parameters P, Q.
In particular, if b = 1, one obtains the sequences of numbers Un =
an−1
a−1 , Vn = an + 1; now the parameters are P = a + 1, Q = a.
Finally, if also a = 2, one gets Un = 2n −1, Vn = 2n + 1, and now
the parameters are P = 3, Q = 2.
C.
Generalizations
At this point, it is appropriate to indicate extensions of the notion
of Lucas sequences which, however, will not be discussed in this
lecture. Such generalizations are possible in four directions, namely,

4
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
by changing the initial values, by mixing two Lucas sequences, by
not demanding that the numbers in the sequences be integers, or by
having more than two parameters.
Even though many results about Lucas sequences have been ex-
tended successfully to these more general sequences, and have found
interesting applications, for the sake of deﬁniteness I have opted to
restrict my attention only to Lucas sequences.
(a) Let P, Q be integers, as before. Let T0, T1 be any integers such
that T0 or T1 is non-zero (to exclude the trivial case). Let
W0 = PT0 + 2T1
and
W1 = 2QT0 + PT1.
Let
Tn = P · Tn−1 −Q · Tn−2
and
Wn = P · Wn−1 −Q · Wn−2
(for n ≥2).
The sequences (Tn(P, Q))n≥0 and Wn(P, Q))n≥0 are the (ﬁrst and
the second) linear recurrence sequences with parameters (P, Q) and
associated to the pair (T0, T1). The Lucas sequences are special, nor-
malized, linear recurrence sequences with the given parameters; they
are associated to (0, 1).
(b) Lehmer (1930) considered the following sequences. Let P, Q be
non-zero integers, α, β the roots of the polynomial X2 −
√
P ·X +Q,
and deﬁne
Ln(P, Q) =









αn −βn
α −β
if n is odd,
αn −βn
α2 −β2
if n is even.
L = (Ln(P, Q))n≥0 is the Lehmer sequence with parameters P, Q.
Its elements are integers. These sequences have been studied by
Lehmer and subsequently by Schinzel and Stewart in several
papers which also deal with Lucas sequences and are quoted in the
bibliography.
(c) Let R be an integral domain which need not be Z. Let P, Q ∈R,
P, Q ̸= 0, such that D = P 2−4Q ̸= 0. The sequences (Un(P, Q))n≥0,
(Vn(P, Q))n≥0 of elements of R may be deﬁned as for the case when
R = Z.
Noteworthy cases are when R is the ring of integers of a number
ﬁeld (for example, a quadratic number ﬁeld), or R = Z[x] (or other

2 Basic properties
5
polynomial ring), or R is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. For this latter situation, see
Selmer (1966).
(d) Let P0, P1, . . . , Pk−1 (with k ≥1) be given integers, usually
subjected to some restrictions to exclude trivial cases. Let S0, S1,
. . . , Sk−1 be given integers. For n ≥k, deﬁne:
Sn = P0 · Sn−1 −P1 · Sn−2 + P2 · Sn−3 −. . . + (−1)k−1Pk−1 · Sn−k.
Then (Sn)n≥0 is called a linear recurrence sequence of order k, with
parameters P0, P1, . . . , Pk−1 and initial values S0, S1, . . . , Sk−1.
The case when k = 2 was seen above. For k = 1, one obtains the
geometric progression (S0 · P n
0 )n≥0.
There is great interest and still much to be done in the theory of
linear recurrence sequences of order greater than 2.
2
Basic properties
The numbers in Lucas sequences satisfy many, many properties that
reﬂect the regularity in generating these numbers.
A.
Binet’s formulas
Binet (1843) indicated the following expression in terms of the roots
α, β of the polynomial X2 −PX + Q:
(2.1) Binet’s formulas:
Un = αn −βn
α −β , Vn = αn + βn.
The proof is, of course, very easy. Note that by Binet’s formulas,
Un(−P, Q) = (−1)n−1Un(P, Q)
and
Vn(−P, Q) = (−1)nVn(P, Q).
So, for many of the following considerations, it will be assumed that
P ≥1.
B.
Degenerate Lucas sequences
Let (P, Q) be such that the ratio η = α/β of roots of X2 −Px + Q
is a root of unity. Then the sequences U(P, Q), V (P, Q) are said to
be degenerate.

6
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Now I describe all degenerate sequences. Since
η + η−1 = α
β + β
α = P 2 −2Q
Q
is an algebraic integer and rational, it is an integer. From |α
β + β
α| ≤2
it follows P 2 −2Q = 0, ±Q, ±2Q, and this gives P 2 = Q, 2Q, 3Q,
4Q. If gcd(P, Q) = 1, then (P, Q) = (1, 1), (−1, 1), (2, 1), or (−2, 1),
and the sequences are
U(1, 1)
:
0,

From the discussion, if the sequence is degenerate, then D = 0 or
D = −3.
C.
Growth and numerical calculations
First, I note results about the growth of the sequence U(P, Q).
(2.2) If the sequences U(P, Q), V (P, Q) are non-degenerate, then
|Un|, |Vn| tend to inﬁnity (as n tends to ∞).
This follows from a result of Mahler (1935) on the growth of
coeﬃcients of Taylor series. Mahler also showed
(2.3) If Q ≥2, gcd(P, Q) = 1, D < 0, then, for every ε > 0 and n
suﬃciently large,
|Un| ≥|βn|1−ε.
The calculations of Un, Vn may be performed as follows. Let

To compute a power Mk of the matrix M, the quickest method is to
compute successively the powers M, M2, M4, . . . , M2e where 2e ≤
k < 2e+1; this is done by successively squaring the matrices. Next, if
the 2-adic development of k is k = k0 +k1 ×2+k2 ×22 +. . .+ke ×2e,
where ki = 0 or 1, then Mk = Mk0 × (M2)k1 × . . . × (M2e)ke.
Note that the only factors actually appearing are those where ki =
1.
Binet’s formulas allow also, in some cases, a quick calculation of Un
and Vn.
If D ≥5 and |β| < 1, then

This applies in particular to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for which

It follows that the Fibonacci number Un and the Lucas number Vn

Algebraic relations
The numbers in Lucas sequences satisfy many properties. A look at
the issues of The Fibonacci Quarterly will leave the impression that
there is no bound to the imagination of mathematicians whose en-
deavor it is to produce newer forms of these identities and properties.
Thus, there are identities involving only the numbers Un, in others
only the numbers Vn appear, while others combine the numbers Un
and Vn. There are formulas for Um+n, Um−n, Vm+n, Vm−n (in terms
of Um, Un, Vm, Vn); these are the addition and subtraction formulas.
There are also formulas for Ukn, Vkn, and Unk, Vnk, Uk
n, cV k
n (where
k ≥1) and many more.
I shall select a small number of formulas that I consider most
useful. Their proofs are almost always simple exercises, either by
applying Binet’s formulas or by induction.

It is also convenient to extend the Lucas sequences to negative
indices in such a way that the same recursion (with the given
parameters P, Q) still holds.
(2.4) Extension to negative indices:

Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
The classical results about prime divisors of terms of Lucas se-
quences date back to Euler, (for numbers an−bn
a−b ), to Lucas (for
Fibonacci and Lucas numbers), and to Carmichael (for other Lucas
sequences).
A.
The sets P(U), P(V ), and the rank of appearance.
Let P denote the set of all prime numbers. Given the Lucas sequences
U = (Un(P, Q))n≥0, V = (Vn(P, Q))n≥0, let
P(U) = {p ∈P | ∃n ≥1 such that Un ̸= 0 and p | Un},
P(V ) = {p ∈P | ∃n ≥1 such that Vn ̸= 0 and p | Vn}.
If U, V are degenerate, then P(U), P(V ) are easily determined sets.
Therefore, it will be assumed henceforth that U, V are non-
degenerate and thus, Un(P, Q) ̸= 0, Vn(P, Q) ̸= 0 for all n ≥
1.
Note that if p is a prime dividing both p, q, then p | Un(P, Q),
p | Vn(P, Q), for all n ≥2. So, for the considerations which will
follow, there is no harm in assuming that gcd(P, Q) = 1. So, (P, Q)
belongs to the set
S = {(P, Q) | P ≥1, gcd(P, Q) = 1, P 2 ̸= Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q}.
For each prime p, deﬁne
ρU(p) =

n
if n is the smallest positive index where p | Un,
∞
if p ∤Un for every n > 0,
ρV (p) =

n
if n is the smallest positive index where p | Vn,
∞
if p ∤Vn for every n > 0.

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
11
We call ρU(n) (respectively ρV (p))) is called the rank of appearance
of p in the Lucas sequence U (respectively V ).
First, I consider the determination of even numbers in the Lucas
sequences.
(3.1) Let n ≥0. Then:
Un even ⇐⇒







P even
Q odd,
n even,
or
P odd
Q odd,
3 | n,
and
Vn even ⇐⇒







P even
Q odd,
n ≥0,
or
P odd
Q odd,
3 | n.
Special Cases. For the sequences of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers
(P = 1, Q = −1), one has:
Un is even if and only if 3 | n,
Vn is even if and only if 3 | n.
For the sequences of numbers Un = an−bn
a−b , Vn = an + bn, with a >
b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1, p = a + b, q = ab, one has:
If a, b are odd, then Un is even if and only if n is even, while Vn is
even for every n.
If a, b have diﬀerent parity, then Un, Vn are always odd (for n ≥1).
With the notations and terminology introduced above the result
(3.1) may be rephrased in the following way:
(3.2) 2 ∈P(U) if and only if Q is odd
ρU(2) =



1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Moreover, if Q is odd, then 2 | Un (respectively 2 | Vn) if and only if
ρU(2) | n (respectively ρV (2) | n).
This last result extends to odd primes:
(3.3) Let p be an odd prime.
If p ∈P(U), then p | Un if and only if ρU(p) | n.
If p ∈P(V ), then p | Vn if and only if ρV (p) | n and
n
ρV (p) is odd.
Now I consider odd primes p and indicate when p ∈P(U).
(3.4) Let p be an odd prime.
If p ∤P and p | Q, then p ∤Un for every n ≥1.
If p | P and p ∤Q, then p | Un if and only if n is even.
If p ∤PQ and p | D, then p | Un if and only if p | n.
If p ∤PQD, then p divides UψD(p) where ψD(p) = p −(D
p ) and (D
p )
denotes the Legendre symbol.
Thus,
P(U) = {p ∈P | p ∤Q},
so P(U) is an inﬁnite set.
The more interesting assertion concerns the case where p ∤PQD,
the other ones being very easy to establish.
The result may be expressed in terms of the rank of appearance:
(3.5) Let p be an odd prime.
If p ∤P, p | Q, then ρU(p) = ∞.
If p | P, p ∤Q, then ρU(p) = 2.
If p ∤PQ, p | D, then ρU(p) = p.
If p ∤PQD, then ρU(p) | ΨD(p).
Special Cases. For the sequences of Fibonacci numbers (P = 1,
Q = −1), D = 5 and 5 | Un if and only if 5 | n.
If p is an odd prime, p ̸= 5, then p | Up−( 5
p), so ρU(p) | (p −( 5
p)).
Because U3 = 2, it follows that P(U) = P.
Let a > b ≥1, gcd(a, b), P = a + b, Q = ab, Un = an−bn
a−b .
If p divides a or b but not both a, b, then p ∤Un for all n ≥1.
If p ∤ab, p | a + b, then p | Un if and only if n is even.
If p ∤ab(a + b) but p | a −b, then p | Un if and only if p | n.
If p ∤ab(a + b)(a −b), then p | Up−1. (Note that D = (a −b)2).
Thus, P(U) = {p : p ∤ab}.

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
13
Taking b = 1, if p ∤a, then p | Up−1, hence p | ap−1 −1 (this is
Fermat’s Little Theorem, which is therefore a special case of the last
assertion of (3.4)); it is trivial if p | (a + 1)(a −1).
The result (3.4) is completed with the so-called law of repetition,
ﬁrst discovered by Lucas for the Fibonacci numbers:
(3.6) Let pe (with e ≥1) be the exact power of p dividing Un. Let
f ≥1, p ∤k. Then, pe+f divides Unkpf . Moreover, if p ∤Q, pe ̸= 2,
then pe+f is the exact power of p dividing Unkpe.
It was seen above that Fermat’s Little Theorem is a special case of
the assertion that if p is a prime and p ∤PQD, then p divides UΨD(p).
I indicate now how to reinterpret Euler’s classical theorem.

Let Ψα,β(p) = p −(α,β

so Ψα,β(pe) = pe−1Ψα,β(p) for each prime p and e ≥1. Deﬁne also
the Carmichael function λα,β(n) = lcm{Ψα,β(pe)}. Thus, λα,β(n)
divides Ψα,β(n).
In the special case where α = a, β = 1, and a is an integer,
then Ψa,1(p) = p −1 for each prime p not dividing a. Hence, if
gcd(a, n) = 1, then Ψa,1(n) = ϕ(n), where ϕ denotes the classical
Euler function.
The generalization of Euler’s theorem by Carmichael is the
following:

(3.7) n divides Uλα,β(n) hence, also, UΨα,β(n).
It is an interesting question to evaluate the quotient ΨD(p)
ρU(p) . It was
shown by Jarden (1958) that for the sequence of Fibonacci numbers,
sup

(as p tends to ∞). More generally, Kiss (1978) showed:

ρU(p)

= ∞.
(b) There exists C > 0 (depending on P, Q) such that

ρU(p) < C

Now I turn my attention to the companion Lucas sequence V =
(Vn(P, Q))n≥0 and I study the set of primes P(V ). It is not known
how to describe explicitly, by means of ﬁnitely many congruences,
the set P(V ). I shall indicate partial congruence conditions that are
complemented by density results.
Because U2n = UnVn, it then follows that P(V ) ⊆P(U). It was
already stated that 2 = P(V ) if and only if Q is odd.
(3.9) Let p be an odd prime.
If p ∤P, p | Q, then p ∤Vn for all n ≥1.
If p | P, p ∤Q, then p | Vn if and only if n is odd.
If p ∤PQ, p | D, then p ∤Vn for all n ≥1.
If p ∤PQD, then p | V 1
2 ΨD(p) if and only if (Q
P ) = −1.
If p ∤PQD and (Q
p ) = 1, (D
p ) = −(−1
p ), then p ∤Vn for all n ≥1.
The above result implies that P(V ) is an inﬁnite set.∗One may fur-
ther reﬁne the last two assertions; however, a complete determination
of P(V ) is not known.
In terms of the rank of appearance, (3.9) can be rephrased as
follows:
∗This was extended by Ward (1954) for all binary linear recurrences

(3.10) Let p be an odd prime.
If p | P, p ∤Q, then ρV (p) = 1.
If p ∤P, p | Q, then ρV (p) = ∞.
If p ∤PQ, p | D, then ρV (p) = ∞.
If p ∤PQD, (Q
p ) = −1, then ρV (p) divides 1
2ΨD(p).
If p ∤PQD, (Q
p ) = 1, (D
p ) = −(−1
p ), then ρV (p) = ∞.
The following conjecture has not yet been established in general,
but has been veriﬁed in special cases, described below:
Conjecture. For each companion Lucas sequence V , the limit
δ(V ) = lim πV (x)
π(x)
exists and is strictly greater than 0.
Here, π(x) = #{p ∈P | p ≤x} and πV (x) = #{p ∈P(V ) | p ≤x}.
The limit δ(V ) is the density of the set of prime divisors of V among
all primes.
Special Cases. Let (P, Q) = (1, −1), so V is the sequence of Lucas
numbers. Then the above results may be somewhat completed. Ex-
plicitly:
If p ≡3, 7, 11, 19 (mod 20), then p ∈P(V ).
If p ≡13, 17 (mod 20), then p /∈P(V ).
If p ≡1, 9 (mod 20) it may happen that p ∈P(V ) or that p /∈P(V ).
Jarden (1958) showed that there exist inﬁnitely many primes p ≡
1 (mod 20) in P(V ) and also inﬁnitely many primes p ≡1 (mod 20)
not in P(V ). Further results were obtained by Ward (1961) who
concluded that there is no ﬁnite set of congruences to decide if an
arbitrary prime p is in P(V ).
Inspired by a method of Hasse (1966), and the analysis of Ward
(1961), Lagarias (1985) showed that, for the sequence V of Lucas
numbers, the density is δ(V ) = 2
3.
Brauer (1960) and Hasse (1966) studied a problem of Sierpi´n-
ski, namely, determine the primes p such that 2 has an even order
modulo p, equivalently, determine the primes p dividing the numbers
2n + 1 = Vn(3, 2). He proved that δ(V (3, 2)) = 17/24. Lagarias
pointed out that Hasse’s proof shows also that if a ≥3 is square-
free, then δ(V (a + 1, a)) = 2/3; see also a related paper of Hasse
(1965).

1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Laxton (1969) considered, for each a ≥2, the set W(a) of all
binary linear recurrences W with W0, W1 satisfying W1 ̸= W0, W1 ̸=
aW0, and Wn = (a + 1)Wn−1 −aWn−2, for n ≥2. This set includes
the Lucas sequences U(a + 1, a), V (a + 1, a). For each prime p, let
ep(a) =

if p | a,

if p ∤a.
Laxton gave a heuristic argument to the eﬀect that if the limit, as

Stephens (1976) used a method of Hooley (1967) who had
proved, under the assumption of a generalized Riemann’s hypothesis,
Artin’s conjecture that 2 is a primitive root modulo p for inﬁnitely
many primes p. Let a ≥2, a not a proper power. Assume the gener-

Primitive factors of Lucas sequences
Let p be a prime. If ρU(p) = n (respectively ρV (p) = n), then p is
called a primitive factor of Un(P, Q) (respectively Vn(P, Q)). Denote
by Prim(Un) the set of primitive factors of Un, similarly, by Prim(Vn)
the set of primitive factors of Vn. Let Un = U∗
n · U′
n, Vn = V ∗
n · V ′
n,
where gcd(U∗
n, U′
n) = 1, gcd(V ∗
n , V 1
n ) = 1, p | U∗
n (respectively p | V ∗
n )
if and only if p is a primitive factor of Un (respectively Vn). U∗
n,
(respectively V ∗
n ) is called the primitive part of Un (respectively Vn).
From U2n = Un · Vn it follows that U∗
2n | V ∗
n , hence, Prim(U2n) ⊆
Prim(V ∗
n ). It is not excluded that U∗
n = 1 (respectively V ∗
n = 1); I
shall discuss this question.
a
Existence of primitive factors
The study of primitive factors of Lucas sequences originated with
Bang and Zsigmondy for special Lucas sequences (see below). The
ﬁrst main theorem is due to Carmichael (1913):
(3.11) Let (P, Q) ∈S and assume that D > 0.
1. If n ̸= 1, 2, 6, then Prim(Un) ̸= ∅, with the only exception
(P, Q) = (1, −1), n = 12 (which gives the Fibonacci number
U12 = 144).
Moreover, if D is a square and n ̸= 1, then Prim(Un) ̸= ∅,
with the only exception (P, Q) = (3, 2), n = 6 (which gives
the number 26 −1 = 63).
2. If n ̸= 1, 3, then Prim(Vn) ̸= ∅, with the only exception
(P, Q) = (1, −1), n = 6 (which gives the Lucas numbers

18
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
V6 = 18).
Moreover, if D is a square and n ̸= 1, then Prim(Vn) ̸= ∅,
with the only exception (P, Q) = (3, 2), n = 3 (which gives
the number 23 + 1 = 9).
In his paper, Carmichael also proved that if p does not divide D
and p ∈Prim(Un), then p ≡±1 (mod n), while if p ∈Prim(Vn),
then p ≡±1 (mod 2n).
The result of Carmichael was extended by Lekkerkerker
(1953):
Even without assuming that gcd(P, Q) = 1, if D > 0, there
exist only ﬁnitely many n such that Un(P, Q) (respectively
Vn(P, Q)) does not have a primitive factor.
Durst (1961) proved:
(3.12) Let (P, Q) ∈S and D > 0. Then, U6(P, Q) has no primitive
factor if and only if one the following conditions holds:
1. P = 2t+1 −3r, Q = (2t −r)(2t −3r) where t ≥1, 2t+1 > 3r,
and r is odd and positive.
2. P = 3sk, Q = 32s−1k2 −2t where s ≥1, t ≥0, k ≡
±1 (mod 6), and 32s−1k2 < 2t+2.
Thus, there exist inﬁnitely many (P, Q) as above with U6(P, Q) hav-
ing no primitive factor. Durst dealt also with parameters (P, Q)
where gcd(P, Q) may be greater than 1.
(3.13) Let I be a ﬁnite set of integers, with 1 ∈I. Then, there
are inﬁnitely many pairs (P, Q), with P ≥1, P ̸= Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q,
P 2 −4Q > 0, such that Prim(U(P, Q)) = I.
If D < 0, the above result does not hold without modiﬁcation.
For example, for (P, Q) = (1, 2) and n = 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 18,
Prim(Un) = ∅.
In 1962, Schinzel investigated the case when D < 0. In 1974, he
proved a general result of which the following is a corollary.
(3.14) There exists n0 > 0 such that for all n ≥n0, (P, Q) ∈S,
Un(P, Q), Vn(P, Q) have a primitive factor.

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
19
The proof involves Baker’s lower bounds for linear forms in log-
arithms and n0 is eﬀectively computable. It is important to stress
that n0 is independent of the parameters. Stewart (1977a) showed
that n0 ≤e452467. Stewart also showed that if 4 < n, n ̸= 6, there
exist only ﬁnitely many Lucas sequences U(P, Q), V (P, Q) (of the
kind indicated), which may in principle be explicitly determined, and
such that Un(P, Q) (respectively Vn(P, Q)) does not have a primitive
factor.
Voutier (1995) used a method developed by Tzanakis (1989)
to solve Thue’s equations and determined for each n, 4 < n ≤30,
n ̸= 6, the ﬁnite set of parameters (P, Q) ∈S such that Ur(P, Q) has
no primitive factor.
The next result of Gy¨ory (1981) concerns terms of Lucas se-
quences with prime factors in a given set. If E is a ﬁnite set of
primes, let E× denote the set of natural numbers, all of whose prime
factors belong to E.
(3.15) Let s > 1 and E = {p prime | p ≤s}. There exist
c1 = c1(s) > 0, c2 = c2(s) > 0, eﬀectively computable, such that
if (P, Q) ∈S, 4 < n, and Un(P, Q) ∈E×, then
n ≤max{s + 1, e452 · 267},
max{P, |Q|} ≤c1, and |Un(P, Q)| ≤c2.
In 1982, Gy¨ory gave an explicit value for the constants. An
interesting corollary is the following:
(3.16) Let s > 1 and E = {p prime | p ≤s}. There exists
c3 = c3(s) > 0, eﬀectively computable, such that if a > b ≥1
are integers, gcd(a, b) = 1, if 3 < n, an−bn
a−b
= m ∈E×, then n < s
and max{a, m} < c3.
Special Cases. The following very useful theorem was proved by
Zsigmondy (1892); the particular case where a = 2, b = 1 had
been obtained earlier by Bang (1886). Zsigmondy’s theorem was
rediscovered many times (Birkhoff (1904), Carmichael (1913),
Kanold (1950), Artin (1955), and L¨uneburg (1981) who gave a
simpler proof). For an accessible proof, see Ribenboim (1994)
Let a > b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1, and consider the sequence of
binomials
(an −bn)n≥0.

1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
If P = a + b, Q = ab, then an −bn = Un(P, Q) · (a −b). The prime p
is called a primitive factor of an −bn if p | an −bn but p ∤am −bm
for all m, 1 ≤m < n. Let Prim(an −bn) denote the set of all
primitive factors of an −bn. Clearly, if n > 1, then Prim(an −bn) =
Prim(Un(P, Q)) \ {p | p divides a −b}.
(3.17) Let a > b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1.
1. For every n > 1, the binomial an −bn has a primitive factor,
except in the following cases:
a = 2, b = 1, n = 6 (this gives 26 −1 = 63),
a, b are odd, a + b is a power of 2, n = 2.
Moreover, each primitive factor of an −bn is of the form
kn + 1.
2. For every n > 1, the binomial an + bn has a primitive factor,
except for a = 2, b = 1, n = 3 (this gives 23 + 1 = 9).
b
The number of primitive factors
Now I consider the primitive part of terms of Lucas sequences and
discuss the number of distinct prime factors of U∗
n, V ∗
n . The fol-
lowing question remains open: Given (P, Q) ∈S, do there exist
inﬁnitely many n ≥1 such that #(Prim(Un)) = 1, respectively
#(Prim(Vn)) = 1, that is, U∗
n (respectively V ∗
n ) is a prime power?
This question is probably very diﬃcult to answer. I shall discuss a
related problem in the next subsection (c).
Now I shall indicate conditions implying
#(Prim(Un)) ≥2
and
#(Prim(Vn)) ≥2.
If c is any non-zero integer, let k(c) denote the square-free kernel
of c, that is, c divided by its largest square factor. If (P, Q) ∈S, let
M = max{P 2 −4Q, P 2}, let κ = κ(P, Q) = k(MQ), and deﬁne
η = η(P, Q) =

1
if κ ≡1 (mod 4),
2
if κ ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
Schinzel (1963a) proved (see also Rotkiewicz (1962) for the case
when Q > 0 and D > 0):
(3.18) There exist eﬀectively computable ﬁnite subsets M0, N0
of S and for every (P, Q) ∈S an eﬀectively computable integer
n0(P, Q) > 0 such that if (P, Q) ∈S, ̸= 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and
n
ηκ is odd,
then #(Prim(Un(P, Q))) ≥2, with the following exceptions:

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
21
1. D = P 2 −4Q > 0:
n = η · |κ| and (P, Q) ∈M0 ;
n = 3 · η · |κ| and (P, Q) ∈N0 ;
(n, P, Q) = (2D, 1, −2), (2D, 3, 2)
2. D = P 2 −4Q < 0:
(n, P, Q) with n ≤n0(P, Q).
Thus, for each (P, Q) ∈S there exist inﬁnitely many n with
#(Prim(Un(P, Q))) ≥2. Schinzel gave explicit ﬁnite sets M, N
containing respectively the exceptional set M0, N0, which were later
completely determined by Brillhart and Selfridge, but this cal-
culation remained unpublished. Later, I shall invoke the following
corollary:
(3.19) Let (P, Q) ∈S with Q a square and D > 0. If n > 3, then
#(Prim(Un(P, Q))) ≥2,
with the exception of (n, P, Q) = (5, 3, 1).
Thus, in particular, Un(P, Q) is not a prime when n > 3 and Q is a
square, except for (n, P, Q) = (5, 3, 1).
Since Prim(Un(P, Q)) ⊆Prim(Vn(P, Q)), it is easy to deduce
from (3.16) conditions which imply that #(Prim(Vn(P, Q))) ≥2;
in particular, for each (P, Q) ∈S there are inﬁnitely many such
indices n.
These results have been strengthened in subsequent papers by
Schinzel (1963), (1968), but it would be too technical to quote
them here. It is more appropriate to consider:
Special Cases. Let a > b ≥1 be relatively prime integers, let P =
a+b, Q = ab, so Un(P, Q) = an−bn
a−b , Vn(P, Q) = an+bn. Even for these
special sequences it is not known if there exist inﬁnitely many n such
that # Prim(Un(P, Q)) = 1, respectively # Prim(Vn(P, Q)) = 1.
Schinzel (1962b) showed the following result, which is a special
case of (3.16). Let κ = k(a, b),
η =

1
if κ ≡1 (mod 4),
2
if κ ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).

22
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
(3.20) Under the above hypotheses:
1. If n > 20 and
n
ηκ is an odd integer, then # Prim(an−bn
a−b ) ≥2.
2. If n > 10, κ is even, and
n
κ is an odd integer, then
# Prim(an + bn) ≥2.
Thus, there exist inﬁnitely many n such that # Prim(an−bn
a−b ) ≥2,
respectively # Prim(an + bn) ≥2. Schinzel also showed:
(3.21) With the above hypotheses, if κ = ch where h ≥2 when
k(c) is odd, and h ≥3 when k(c) is even, then there exist inﬁnitely
many n such that # Prim(an−bn
a−b ) ≥3.
However, for arbitrary (a, b) with a > b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1, it is
not known if there exist inﬁnitely many n with # Prim(an−bn
a−b ) ≥3.
c
Powers dividing the primitive part
Nothing is known about powers dividing the primitive part, except
that it is a rare occurrence. To size up the diﬃculty of the question,
it is convenient to consider right away the very special case where
(P, Q) = (3, 2), so Un = 2n −1, Vn = 2n + 1. Recall that if n = q
is a prime, then Uq = 2q −1 is called a Mersenne number, usually
denoted Mq = Uq = 2q −1. Also, if n = 2m, then V2m = 22m + 1 is
called a Fermat number and the notation Fm = V2m = 22m + 1 is
used.
The following facts are easy to show: gcd(Mq, Mp) = 1 when p ̸= q,
and gcd(Fm, Fn) = 1 when m ̸= n. It follows that Mq, Fm are equal
to their primitive parts.
A natural number which is a product of proper powers is said to
be a powerful number.
I indicate below several statements which are related, but have
never been proved to be true.
(M)
There exist inﬁnitely many primes p such that Mp is square-free.
(M′) There exist inﬁnitely many primes such that Mp is not powerful.
(F)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that Fn is square-free.
(F′)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that Fn is not powerful.
(B)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that the primitive part of
2n −1 is square-free.
(B′)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that the primitive part of
2n −1 is not powerful.
(C)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that the primitive part of
2n + 1 is square-free.

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
23
(C′)
There exist inﬁnitely many n such that the primitive part of
2n + 1 is not powerful.
I shall discuss these and related conjectures in Chapter 9 where
it will be explained why the proof of any of the above conjectures
should be very diﬃcult.
d
The greatest prime factor of terms of Lucas sequences.
The problem of estimating the size of the greatest prime division of
terms of Lucas sequences has been the object of many interesting
papers.
If n is a natural number, let P[n] denote the greatest prime factor
of n, and let ν(n) denote the number of distinct prime factors of n. So,
the number q(n) of distinct square-free factors of n is q(n) = 2ν(n).
There have also been studies to estimate the size of Q[n], the largest
square-free factor of n, but I shall not consider this question.
For every n ≥1, let Φn(X, Y ) ∈Z[X, Y ] be the nth homogenized
cyclotomic polynomial
Φn(X, Y ) =

gcd(i,n)=1
1≤i≤n
(X −ζiY )
where ζ is a primitive nth root of 1; so, Φn(X, Y ) has degree ϕ(n)
(the Euler totient of n).
If P, Q are non-zero integers, D = P 2 −4Q ̸= 0 and α, β the roots
of X2 −PX + Q, then Φn(α, β) ∈Z (for n ≥2) and αn −βn =

d|n Φd(α, β).
It follows easily that
P
αn −βn
α −β

≥P[Φn(α, β)],
P[αn −βn] ≥P[Φn(α, β)],
P[αn + βn] ≥P[Φ2n(α, β)].
Therefore, it suﬃces to ﬁnd lower estimates for P [Φn(α, β)].
The ﬁrst result was given by Zsigmondy (1892) and again by
Birkhoff (1904): If a, b are relatively prime integers, a > b ≥1,
then P[an −bn] ≥n + 1 and P[an + bn] ≥2n + 1 (with the exception
23 + 1 = 9). Schinzel added to this result (1962): If ab is a square

24
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
or the double of a square, then P[an −bn] ≥2n+1, except for a = 2,
b = 1, and n = 4, 6, 12.
In his work on primitive factors of Lucas sequences with D > 0,
Carmichael (1913) showed that if n > 12, then P[Un] ≥n −1 and
P[Vn] ≥2n −1. Erd¨os (1965) conjectured:
lim
n→∞
P[2n −1]
n
= ∞.
This problem, as well as related questions which are still unsolved,
has been extensively studied by Stewart (see Stewart (1975,
1977b); Shorey (1981); Stewart (1982, 1985)). Several of the re-
sults which I shall describe concern the greatest prime factor when
the index n belongs to some set with asymptotic density 1.
A subset S of N has asymptotic density γ, 0 ≤γ ≤1, where
lim
N→∞
#{n ∈S | n ≤N}
N
= γ.
For example, the set P of prime numbers has asymptotic density 0.
Combining the Prime Number Theorem with the fact that each
primitive factor of Φn(a, b) is of the form hn + 1 yields:
(3.22) There exists a set T of asymptotic density 1 such that
lim
n→∞
n∈T
P[Φ(a, b)]
n
= ∞.
In particular, limn→∞,n∈T
P[2n−1]
n
= ∞where T is a set with asymp-
totic density 1. The above result was made more precise and extended
for sequences with arbitrary discriminant D ̸= 0. Let 0 ≤κ ≤1/ log 2
and deﬁne the set
Nκ = {n ∈N | n has at most κ log log n distinct prime factors}.
For example, P ⊂Nκ, for every κ as above. A classical result
(see the book of Hardy and Wright (1938)) is the following: If
0 ≤κ ≤1/ log 2, then Nκ has asymptotic density equal to 1.
In other words, “most” natural numbers have “few” distinct prime
factors.
The following result is due to Stewart (1977b) for α, β real, and
to Shorey (1981) for arbitrary α, β.

3 Prime divisors of Lucas sequences
25
(3.23) Let κ, α, β be as above. If n ∈Nκ, n ≥3, then
P[Φn(α, β)] ≥Cϕ(n)log n
q(n)
where C ≥0 is an eﬀectively computable number depending only on
α, β, and κ.
Recall that q(n) = 2ν(n) and ν(n) ≤κ log log n. It follows, with
appropriate constants C1 > 0 and C2 > 0, that
P[Φn(α, β)] > C1
n log n
2ν(n) log(1 + ν(n))
and
P[Φn(α, β)] > C2
n log n1−κ log 2
log log log n .
In particular, the above estimates hold for n ∈Nκ, n > 3, and
each Lucas sequence Un(P, Q), Vn(P, Q), and αn −βn.
Since ν(p) = 1 for each prime p, then
P[ap −bp] ≥Cp log p,
P[ap + bp] ≥Cp log p
(with appropriate C > 0). In particular, for the Mersenne numbers
Mp = 2p −1,
P[2p −1] ≥Cp log p,
and for the Fermat number Fm = 22m + 1,
P[22m + 1] ≥Cm × 2m,
but this estimate may also be obtained in a more direct way, as
suggested by D. Knayswick.
Stewart obtained also sharper, more technical expressions for
lower bounds of P[Φn(α, β)], and he conjectured that
P[Φ(α, β)] > C[ϕ(n)]2
for α, β real, for all n > 3, where C > 0 is an eﬀectively computable
number (depending on α, β). This statement is true if n is square-
free.
Using a more reﬁned form of Baker’s lower bounds for linear
forms in logarithms (as given by Waldschmidt (1980)), Stewart
(1982) proved the following result, valid for all n > C0 (an absolute
constant):

26
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
(3.24) For every (P, Q) ∈S there exists an eﬀectively computable
number C1 = C1(P, Q) > 0 such that if n > C0, then P[Un], P[Vn]
are bounded below by
max

n −1, C1
n log n
q(n)
4


.
The following result is non-eﬀective, but gives sharper bounds on
sets of asymptotic density 1 (Stewart (1982)):
(3.25) Let f : N →R>0 be any function such that lim f(n) = 0. For
each (P, Q) ∈S there exists a set T ⊆N of asymptotic density 1,
such that if n ∈T, then
P[Un] ≥f(n)n(log n)2
log log n .
Stewart obtained further results about linear recurrence se-
quences other than Lucas sequences, and even for linear recurrence
sequences of order greater than 2, but they fall beyond my scope.
For a comprehensive survey, see Stewart (1985).
An interesting result related to these questions had already been
obtained by Mahler (1966):
(3.26) Let Q ≥2, D = P 2 −4Q < 0, and let E be a ﬁnite set of
primes and denote by E×[Un] the largest factor of Un, where prime
factors all belong to E. If 0 < ϵ < 1
2, there exists n0 > 1 such that if
n > n0, then

Un
E×[Un]
 > Q(1/2−ϵ)n. In particular, lim P[Un] = ∞.
The proof used p-adic methods.
4
Primes in Lucas sequences
Let U, V be the Lucas sequences with parameters (P, Q) ∈S.
The main questions about primes in Lucas sequences are the
following:
1. Does there exist n > 1 such that Un(P, Q), respectively Vn(P, Q),
is a prime?
2. Do there exist inﬁnitely many n > 1 such that Un(P, Q),
respectively Vn(P, Q), is a prime?

4 Primes in Lucas sequences
27
I discuss the various possibilities, indicating what is known in the
most important special cases.
The following is an example of a Lucas sequence with only one
prime term, namely U2:
U(3, 1): 0 1 3 8 21 55 144 377 987 . . .
This was remarked after (3.19). Similarly, if a > b ≥1, with a, b
odd, if P = a + b, Q = ab, then Vn(P, Q) = an + bn is even for every
n ≥1, so it is not a prime.
Applying Carmichael’s theorem (3.11) on the existence of
primitive factors, it follows easily that:
(4.1) If D > 0 and Un(P, Q) is a prime, then n = 2, 4 or n is an
odd prime. If Vn(P, Q) is a prime, then n is a prime or a power of 2.
This result is not true if D < 0, as this example shows:
Let (P, Q) = (1, 2), so D = −7 and
U(1, 2): 0 1 1 −1 −3 −1 5 7 −3 −17 −11 23 45 −1 −91 −89 . . .
In this example, U6, U8, U9, U10, U15, . . . , are primes.
Similarly, in V (1, 2), for example, the terms |V9|, |V10| are primes.
Special Cases. In (1999), Dubner and Keller indicated all the
indices n < 50000 for which the Fibonacci number Un, or the Lucas
number Vn, are known to be prime: Un is known to be a prime for
n = 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29, 43, 47, 83, 131, 137, 359, 431,
433, 449, 509, 569, 571, 2971(W), 4723(M), 5387(M), 9311(DK) [W:
discovered by H. C. Williams; M: discovered by F. Morain; DK:
discovered by H. Dubner and W. Keller].
Moreover, for n < 50000, Un is a probable prime for n = 9677,
14431, 25561, 30757, 35999, 37511 (and for no other n < 50000).
This means that these numbers were submitted to tests indicating
that they are composite.
For n ≤50000, Vn is known to be a prime for n = 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11,
13, 16, 17, 19, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 61, 71, 79, 113, 313, 353, 503(W),
613(W), 617(W), 863(W), 1097(DK), 1361(DK), 4787(DK), 4793(DK),
5851(DK), 7741(DK), 10691(DK), 14449(DK) [W: discovered by H. C.
Williams; DK: discovered by H. Dubner and W. Keller].
Moreover, Vn is a probable prime for n = 8467, 12251, 13963,
19469, 35449, 36779, 44507 (and for no other n ≤50000).

28
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Due to the size of the probable primes, an actual prime
certiﬁcation is required to be done.
The paper of Dubner and Keller contains a lot more factor-
izations; it is a continuation of previous work of numerous other
mathematicians; we call attention to Jarden (1958), the edition of
Jarden’s book by Brillhart (1973), and the paper by Brillhart
(1988) which contains complete factorizations of Un (for n ≤1000)
and of Vn (for n ≤500).
If a = 2, b = 1, the associated Lucas sequences are Un = 2n −1
and Vn = 2n + 1.
Now, if Un is a prime, then n = q is a prime, and Mq = Uq = 2q −1
is a prime Mersenne number. If Vn is a prime, then n = 2m, and
Fm = 22m + 1 is a prime Fermat number.
Up to now, only 37 Mersenne primes are known, the largest one
being M302137, proved prime in 1999; it has more than 2 million
digits. On the other hand, the largest known Fermat prime number
is F4. For a detailed discussion of Mersenne numbers and Fermat
numbers, see my book The Little Book of Big Primes (1991a) or the
up-to-date Brazilian edition (1994).
It is believed that there exist inﬁnitely many Mersenne primes.
Concerning Fermat primes, there is insuﬃcient information to
support any conjecture.

Powers and powerful numbers in Lucas
sequences
In this section, I deal with the following questions. Let U, V be the
Lucas sequences with parameters (P, Q) ∈S. Let k ≥1, h ≥2, and
consider the set
CU,k,h = {Un | Un = kxh, with |x| ≥2}.
Let CU,k = 
h≥2 CU,k,h, so CU,k consists of all Un of the form Un =
kxh for some |x| ≥2 and h ≥2. If k = 1, one obtains the set of all
Un that are proper powers.
Similarly, let
C∗
U,k = {Un | Un = kt where t is a powerful number}.
If k = 1, one obtains the set of all Un which are powerful numbers.

5 Powers and powerful numbers in Lucas sequences
29
Corresponding deﬁnitions are made for the sets CV,k,h and CV,k∗
associated to the sequence V .
The basic question is to ﬁnd out if, and when, the above sets are
empty, ﬁnite, or inﬁnite, and, whenever possible, to determine the
sets explicitly.
A related problem concerns the square-classes in the sequences
U, V .
Un, Um are said to be square-equivalent if there exist integers a, b ̸=
0 such that Uma2 = Unb2 or, equivalently, UmUn is a square. This
is clearly an equivalence relation on the set {Un | n ≥1} whose
classes are called the square-classes of the sequence U. If Un, Um are
in the same square-class, and if d = gcd(Un, Um), then Um = dx2,
Un = dy2, and conversely.
The square-classes of the sequence V are deﬁned in a similar
manner.
Concerning square-classes, the problems are the same: to deter-
mine if there are square-classes which are not trivial, that is, having
more than one element; next, to ascertain if there are only ﬁnitely
many nontrivial square-classes, if a square-class may be ﬁnite and,
if possible, to determine explicitly the square-classes.
If k ≥1, the notation k2 indicates a number of the form kx2, with
x ≥2; thus, 2 indicates a square greater than 1.
The ﬁrst results on these questions were the determinations of
those Fibonacci and Lucas numbers that are squares. This was
achieved using rather elementary, but clever, arguments. In my pre-
sentation, I prefer to depart from the order in which the subject
unfolded, and, instead, to give ﬁrst the general theorems.
A.
General theorems for powers
The general theorem of Shorey (1981, 1983) (valid for all non-
degenerate binary recurrence sequences) was proved using sharp
lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms by Baker (1973), plus
a p-adic version by van der Poorten (1977), assisted by another
result of Kotov (1976).
A result of Shorey (1977) may also be used, as suggested by
Peth¨o.
(5.1) Let (P, Q) ∈S, k ≥1. There exists an eﬀectively computable
number C = C(P, Q, k) > 0 such that if n ≥1, |x| ≥2, h ≥2 and

30
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Un = kxh, then n, |x|, h < C. A similar statement holds for the
sequence V .
In particular, in a given Lucas sequence there are only ﬁnitely many
terms which are powers.
Stewart’s paper (1980) contains also the following result, sug-
gested by Mignotte and Waldschmidt. For h ≥2, n ≥1, let [n]h
denote the h-power closest to n.
(5.2) If Q = ±1, then
lim
n→∞|Un −[Ur]h| = ∞.
This is achieved by showing that for every d, there exists an eﬀec-
tively computable number C = C(P, d) > 0 such that if Un = xh + d
with |x| ≥1, h ≥2, then n, |x|, h < C.
The above general results are not suﬃcient to determine explicitly
all the terms Un of the form kxh, because the bounds indicated are
too big.
Peth¨o (1982) gave the following extension of (5.1) (valid for all
non-degenerate binary recurrences):
(5.3) Let E be a ﬁnite set of primes, E× the set of integers all of
whose prime factors belong to E. Given (P, Q) ∈S, there exists
an eﬀectively computable number C > 0, depending only on P, Q,
and E, such that if n ≥1, |x| ≥2, h ≥2, k ∈E×, and Un = kxh,
then n, |x|, h, k ≥C. A similar result holds for the sequence V .
B.
Explicit determination in special sequences
Now I shall consider special sequences, namely, those with pa-
rameters (1, −1) (the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers), those with
parameters (2, −1) (the Pell numbers), and those with parameters
(a + 1, a), where a > 1, in particular with parameters (3, 2).
The questions to be discussed concern squares, double squares,
other multiples of squares, square-classes, cubes, and higher powers.
The results will be displayed in a table (see page 35).
a
Squares
The only squares in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers are U1 =
U2 = 1 and U12 = 144. This result was proved independently in 1964
by Cohn and Wyler.

5 Powers and powerful numbers in Lucas sequences

The only square in the sequence of Lucas numbers is V3 = 4,
proved by Cohn (1964a).
One proof uses only divisibility properties and algebraic identities
involving the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. Another proof is based
on the solution of the equations X2 −5Y 4 = ±4, X4 −5Y 2 = ±4.
For the parameters (P, Q) = (2, −1), which give the sequences of
Pell numbers, it is easy to see that Vn is never a square. The only
Un (with n > 1) which is a square is U7 = 169. The proof follows
from a study of the equation X2 −2Y 4 = −1, which was the object
of a long paper by Ljunggren (1942c). Robbins reported this re-
sult in (1984) and it was again discovered by Peth¨o (1991) using a
method of Diophantic approximation and computer calculations.
Let a ≥2, P = a + 1, and Q = a. Nagell (1921a) (and Ljung-
gren (1942c), who completed the work) proved: If an−1
a−1 is a square,
and n > 1, then (a, n) = (3, 5) or (7, 4).
Ko (1960, 1964) proved: If an + 1 is a square, then (a, n) = (2, 3).
This result answered a long-standing problem.
A short proof of Ko’s theorem is due to Chein (1976); another
one was given by Rotkiewicz (1983) involving the computation of
Jacobi symbols.
Detailed proofs of the above results are given in my book Catalan’s
Conjecture (1994).
The special case of parameters (3, 2) gives the numbers Un = 2n −
1, Vn = 2n + 1, and it is very easy to see that 2n −1 = 2 only for
n = 1, and 2n + 1 = 2 only for n = 3.
b
Double squares
Cohn (1964b) showed for Fibonacci numbers Un and Lucas
numbers Vn:
If Un = 22, then n = 3 or 6, giving U3 = 2, U6 = 8.
If Vn = 22, then n = 0 or 6, giving V0 = 2, V6 = 18.
I have not found in the literature the determination of the Pell
numbers Un(2, −1), Vn(2, −1), an−1
a−1 , an+1 which are double squares
(apart from the trivial cases).
c
Square-classes
Cohn (1972) determined the square-classes of Fibonacci and Lucas
numbers (and even of more general sequences). In (1989a), I used
another method to solve this problem:

32
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
The square-classes of Fibonacci numbers consist all of one
number, except {U1, U2, U12} and {U3, U6}.
The square-classes of Lucas numbers consist only of one
number, except {V1, V3}, {V0, V6}.
The determination of the square-classes of sequences of Pell
numbers remains to be done.
For the square-classes of the sequences Un = an−1
a−1 , Vn = an + 1
(n ≥1), see Ribenboim (1989b).
The square-classes of the sequence U consist all of only one
number. If a is even, the square-classes of V are also reduced to
one element. Furthermore, there is an eﬀectively computable
number C > 0 such that if
(an + 1)(am + 1) = 2
with m ̸= n, a odd, then a, m, n < C. So, only ﬁnitely many
square-classes are not trivial and they are all ﬁnite.
d
Numbers of the form k2 with k ≥3
Let k ≥3, assumed without loss of generality to be square-free.
Often, k is taken to be an odd prime.
I have mentioned some papers concerning the special Lucas se-
quences with terms of the form k2. On this matter, it is unavoidable
to be incomplete and I wish to apologize to any author whose work
I did not report.
On Fibonacci numbers, respectively Lucas numbers, of the form
p2 (where p is an odd prime) there are papers by Steiner (1980),
Robbins (1983a), and Goldman (1988).
Steiner showed that if Un = 32, then n = 4. Robbins proved
that if Un = p2, where p is a prime, p ≡3 (mod 4) or 3 < p < 10000,
then p = 3001. Goldman showed that if p = 3, 7, 47 or 2207, and
the Lucas number Vn = p2, then Vn = p; note that then n = 2e
(with e = 1, 2, 3, 4).
For the sequence an−1
a−1 , (n ≥0, a ≥2), there is also a partial result
by Rotkiewicz (1983): if a ≡0 or 3 (mod 4) and n > 1, n odd,
then an−1
a−1 ̸= n2. This is obtained using the calculation of Jacobi
symbols.

Cubes
London and Finkelstein (1969) showed that the only Fibonacci
cubes are U1 = U2 = 1 and U6 = 8, while the only Lucas number
which is a cube is V1 = 1. The proof by London and Finkelstein
requires the explicit solution of the cubic diophantine equations
x2 ± 100 = y3, subject to certain conditions. The latter result was
obtained by Lagarias (1981) as well as by Peth¨o (1983) with a dif-
ferent proof using Waldschmidt’s form (1980) of the lower bound
for linear forms in logarithms, followed by computer calculations.
Peth¨o also gave results about Fibonacci numbers of the form px3
or p2x3. For Pell numbers, Peth¨o (1991) showed that for n > 1,
Un(2, −1) is never a cube.
Nagell (1920, 1921b) (work completed by Ljunggren (1942a,
1943)) showed that if an−1
a−1
is a cube, with n = 3, then a = 18;
moreover, if n > 3, then n ̸≡−1 (mod 6), which is just a partial
result.
The work of Nagell and Ljunggren also showed that an + 1 is
a cube only in trivial cases.
These results are of course trivial for the numbers 2n −1, 2n + 1,
which cannot be cubes. They were given by G´erono (1870).
f
Higher powers
Nobody has as yet found any power higher than a cube among
Fibonacci or Lucas numbers (except, trivially, 1).
In (1978) and (1983b), Robbins showed, if q ≥5, q a prime, and
if n is the smallest index such that the Fibonacci number Un is a
qth power, then n is a prime. Thus, if p is a prime dividing Un, then
n = ρU(p), but also pq | Un, a fact which seems very unlikely to
happen. The same result was also obtained in (1983) by Peth¨o.
Peth¨o (1991) showed also that a Pell number Un(2, −1) (with
n > 1) is not a power (higher than a square).
The work of Nagell and Ljunggren already quoted gives: If
an−1
a−1
= ym where m > 3, n ≥3, then n ̸= 3. Moreover, from
Nagell (1920) and Ljunggren (1943), necessarily 3 and 4 do not
divide n when m > 3 (this is a partial result only).
Inkeri communicated to me: If an−1
a−1 is a pth power (with a > 1,
n > 1 and p a prime), then the p-adic value vp(a) ̸= 1 (see the proof
in my book Catalan’s Conjecture (1994), page 120).

34
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
The problem to determine if an+1 can be equal to a higher power,
or the similar problem for an −1, amounts to the determination of
all consecutive powers of integers. Catalan (1844) conjectured that
8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers. This problem remains open,
and my book Catalan’s Conjecture (already quoted) is entirely de-
voted to this question. Let it be said here only that, with a clever use
of Baker’s lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, Tijdeman
(1976) showed:
(5.4) There exists an eﬀectively computable number C > 0 such
that if an + 1 = bm with a, b ≥1, m ≥2, then a, b, m, n < C.
Langevin (1976) calculated an upper bound for C:
C < eeee730
which is beyond what imagination can dare.
It would be desirable to lower his bound so that numerical
computer calculations may eventually conﬁrm Catalan’s conjecture.
Of course, it is easy to show for the special sequence of numbers
2n −1, 2n + 1 that they are not higher powers (diﬀerent from 1).
This was done by G´erono (1870).
g
Addendum on repunits
A number is called a repunit if all its digits in base 10 are equal to 1.
Such numbers are of the form
10n −1
10 −1 = Un(11, 10).
A repunit (diﬀerent from 1) is not a square, nor a ﬁfth power.
This follows from Inkeri’s result, already quoted. An independent
proof was given by Bond (see my book Catalan’s Conjecture (1994),
page 120).
Inkeri (1972) showed that a repunit (diﬀerent from 1) is not a
cube. Another proof was given by Rotkiewicz (1981) (see Catalan’s
Conjecture, pages 119, 120).
The question of the determination of repunits which are pow-
ers has now been completely solved—only the trivial repunit 1 is a
power. This result is in a reprint of Bugeaud (1999). The proof re-
quires bounds in linear forms in two p-adic logarithms plus extensive
computations with modular techniques to solve Thue equations.

Recapitulation
It is perhaps a good idea to assemble in a table the various results
about special Lucas sequences discussed about.
The sign (!) indicates that the problems has been solved; (?) means
the problem is completely open, or that I could not ﬁnd it treated
in the literature; the sign (!?) means that only partial results are
known, cases remaining still unsettled.
C.
Uniform explicit determination of multiples,
squares, and square-classes for certain families of
Lucas sequences
It is an interesting and somewhat unexpected feature in the deter-
mination of squares, double-squares, and square-classes, that certain

36
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
inﬁnite families of Lucas sequences can be treated at the same time,
providing uniform results.
In a series of papers, Cohn (1966, 1967, 1968, 1972) has linked
this problem to the solution of certain quartic equations where he
obtained results for all (non-degenerate) sequences with parameters
(P, ±1), where P ≥1 is odd.
Some results are also valid for a certain inﬁnite, but thin, set of
even parameter P, as will be soon indicated.
McDaniel and I have devised a new method, involving the com-
putation of Jacobi symbols, applicable to parameters (P, Q) with
P, Q odd, P ≥1, gcd(P, Q) = 1, and D > 0.
These results were announced in (1992), and detailed proofs will
soon appear.
a
Squares and double squares
The next results are by McDaniel and Ribenboim .
It is assumed that P ≥1, P, Q are odd, gcd(P, Q) = 1, and
D = P 2 −4Q > 0.
(5.5)
1. If Un = 2, then n = 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12.
2. U2 = 2 if and only if P = 2.
3. U3 = 2 if and only if P 2 −Q = 2.
4. U6 = 2 if and only if P = 32, P 2 −Q = 22,
P 2 −3Q = 62.
5. U12 = 2 if and only if P = 2, P 2−Q = 22, P 2−2Q = 32,
P 2 −3Q = 2, and (P 2 −2Q)2 −3Q2 = 62.
The determination of all allowable (P, Q) for which U3(P, Q) = 2
is obvious, and clearly there are inﬁnitely many such pairs (P, Q).
(5.6) The set of allowable parameters (P, Q) for which U6(P, Q) = 2
is parameterized by the set {(s, t) | gcd(s, t) = 1, s even, t odd,
st ≡1 (mod 3)} by putting
P = (s2 −t2)2
3
,
Q = (a2 −b2)2 −8(a2 + b2 + ab)2
q
with
a = 2(s2 + t2 + st)
3
,
b = s2 + t2 + st
3
,
and three other similar forms for P, Q (not listed here for brevity). In
particular, there are inﬁnitely many (P, Q) for which U6(P, Q) = 2.

(P, Q) = (1, −1) is the only known pair such that U12(P, Q) = 2.
It is not known if the system of equations given in (5.5) part (5)
admits other nontrivial solution.
(5.7)
1. If Un = 22, then n = 3 or 6.
2. U3 = 22 if and only if P 2 −Q = 22.
3. U6 = 22 if and only if P = 2, P 2 −Q = 22, and P 2 −
3Q = 2.
The set of allowable parameters (P, Q) for which U3(P, Q) = 22 is
clearly inﬁnite and easily parameterized.
The set of allowable (P, Q) for which U6(P, Q) = 22 is not com-
pletely known. However, the subset of all (1, Q) for which U6(1, Q) =
22 may be parameterized and shown to be inﬁnite.
Concerning the sequence V , the results are the following:
(5.8)
1. If Vn = 2, then n = 1, 3, or 5.
2. V3 = 2 if and only if P = 2.
3. V3 = 2 if and only if both P and P 2 −3Q are squares, or
both P and P 2 −3Q are 32.
4. V5 = 2 if and only if P = 52 and P 4−5P 2Q+5Q2 = 52.
(5.9) The set of all allowable (P, Q) for which V3(P, Q) = 2 is
inﬁnite and parameterized as follows:
First type: P = s2, Q = s4−t2
3
where s is odd, t even, 3 does not
divide st, gcd(s, t) = 1, and s2 < 2t;
Second type: P = 3s2, Q = 3s4 −t2, where s is odd, t is even, 3
divides s, gcd(s, t) = 1, and
√
3s2 < 2t.
(5.10) The set of all allowable (P, Q) for which V5(P, Q) = 2 is
inﬁnite and parameterized as follows:
First type: P = 5s2t2, Q = −s8−50s4t4+125t8

where s, t are odd, 5
does not divide s, gcd(s, t) = 1, and |s| >

(5.11) 1. If Vn = 22, then n = 3 or 6.
2. V3 = 22 if and only if either P = 2, P 2 −3Q = 22, or
P = 32, P 2 −3Q = 62.

38
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
3. V6 = 22 if and only if P 2 −2Q = 32, and (P 2 −2Q)2 −
3Q2 = 62.
(5.12) The set of all allowable (P, Q) for which V6(P, Q) = 22 is
inﬁnite and parameterized as follows: P = s2, Q = 3s4 −2t2 where
s is odd, gcd(s, t) = 1, 3 does not divide s, and
√
6s2 < 4t.
At my request, J. Top determined the pairs (P, Q) for which
V6(P, Q) = 22 (see the paper of McDaniel and Ribenboim already
quoted):
(5.13) The allowable (P, Q) for which V6(P, Q) = 22 correspond to
the rational points of a certain elliptic curve with group of rational
points isomorphic to (Z/2) × Z. These points give rise to inﬁnitely
many pairs of allowable parameters. (P, Q) = (1, −1) corresponds
to the points of order 2; (5, −1) corresponds to the generator of the
subgroup of inﬁnite order.
Other solutions may be calculated from the group law, that is,
with the classical chord and tangent method. Thus
(P, Q) = (29, −4801), (4009, 3593279), (58585, −529351744321), . . .
are also possible parameters.
It is much more diﬃcult to deal with the case where P or Q is
even. The ﬁrst known results are due to Cohn (1972).
(5.14) Let Q = −1 and P = Vm(A, −1), where A is odd, m ≡
3 (mod 6).
1. If Un(P, −1) = 2, then n = 1 or n = 2, and P = 4 or 36.
2. If Un(P, −1) = 22, then n = 4, P = 4.
3. If Vn(P, −1) = 2, then n = 1, P = 4 or 36.
4. If Un(P, −1) = 22, then n = 2, and P = 4 or 140.
(5.15) Let Q = 1 and P = Vm(A, 1) where A is odd and 3 divides m.
1. If Un(P, 1) = 2, then n = 1.
2. If Un(P, 1) = 22, then n = 2, and P = 18 or 19602.
3. Vn(P, 1) = 2 is impossible.
4. If Vn(P, 1) = 22, then n = 1, and P = 18 or 19602.
Note that there are inﬁnitely many even P = Vm(A, −1) with A
odd, m ≡3 (mod 6), but this set is thin.

5 Powers and powerful numbers in Lucas sequences
39
For example, for P < 6000 the only possibilities are 4, 36, 76, 140,
364, 756, 1364, 2236, 3420, 4964. A similar remark applies to the
numbers P = Vn(A, 1), where A is odd and 3 divides m.
In 1983, Rotkiewicz published the following partial, but remark-
able result:
(5.16) If P is even, Q ≡1
(mod 4), gcd(P, Q) = 1, and if
Un(P, Q) = 2, then either n is an odd square or n is an even
integer, not a power of 2, whose largest prime factor divides the
discriminant D.
McDaniel and Ribenboim (1998b) used the result of Rotkiewicz
to show:
(5.17) Let P be positive and even, let Q ≡1 (mod 4) with D =
P 2 −4Q > 0, gcd(P, Q) = 1 and let Un(P, Q) = 2. Then n is a
square, or twice an odd square; all prime factors of n divide D; if
pt > 2 is a prime power dividing n, then for 1 ≤u < t, Upu = p2
when u is even, and UpU = p2 when u is odd. If n is even and
Un = 2, then, in addition, p = 2 or p = 22.
b
Square-classes
In (1992), together with McDaniel, I proved the following result
was proved:
(5.18) Let (P, Q) ∈S. Then for every n > 0 there exists an eﬀec-
tively computable integer Cn > 0, depending on P, Q, n, such that if
n < m and Un(P, Q)Um(P, Q) = 2, or Vn(P, Q)Vm(P, Q) = 2, then
M < Cn.
In particular, all square-classes in sequences U, V are ﬁnite.
For parameters (P, 1), (P, −1), with P odd, Cohn (1972) used his
results on certain quartic equations of type X4 −DY 2 = ±4, ±1 or
X2 −DY 4 = ±4, ± −1, to obtain results on square-classes:
(5.19) Let P ≥1 be odd.
1. If 1 ≤n < m and Un(P, −1)Um(P, −1) = 2, then
n = 1,
m = 2,
P = 2,
or
n = 1,
m = 12,
P = 1,
or
n = 3,
m = 6,
P = 1,
or
n = 3,
m = 6,
P = 3.

40

2. If P ≥3, 1 ≤n ≤m, and Un(P, 1)Um(P, 1) = 2, then
n = 1,
m = 6,
P = 3,
or
n = 1,
m = 2,
P = 2.
(5.20) Let P ≥1 be odd.
1. If 0 ≤n < m and Vn(P, 1)Vm(P, 1) = 2, then
n = 0,
m = 6,
P = 1,
or
n = 1,
m = 3,
P = 1,
or
n = 0,
m = 6,
P = 5.
2. If P ≥3, 0 ≤n < m, and Vn(P, 1)Vm(P, 1) = 2, then
n = 0, m = 3, P = 3 or 27.
A very special case, but with a more direct proof, was given later
by Andr´e-Jeannin (1992).
The following theorem was proved by McDaniel (1998a):
(5.21) Let P > 0, Q ̸= 0, gcd(P, Q) = 1, D = P 2 −4Q > 0.
Assume that P, Q are odd.

(d) If P, Q are given as above, there exists an eﬀectively

m < C.

Multiples of squares
There are only a few systematic results, mainly due to Cohn (1972).
Let k ≥3 be an odd square-free integer, let P ≥1, with P odd.
Cohn studied the equations Un(P, −1) = k2, Un(P, −1) = 2k2, but
could not obtain complete results.
Clearly, there exists a smallest index r > 0 such that k divides
Ur(P, −1). Since the square-classes have at most two numbers, as
indicated before in this case, there exist at most two indices n such
that Un(P, −1) = k2, respectively 2k2.
(5.22) With the above hypotheses and notations:
1. If r ̸≡0 (mod 3) and Un = k2, then n = r, while Un = 2k2
is impossible.
2. If r ≡3 (mod 6), Un(P, −1) = k2 is impossible, however, no
solution was obtained for Un(P, −1) = 2k2 in this case.
3. If n ≡0 (mod 6), and if the 2-adic value v2(r) is even,
then Un(P, −1) = 2k2 is impossible; if v2(r) is odd, then
Un(P, −1) = k2 is impossible except if P = 5, n = 12,
k = 455. The other cases are left open.
Cohn also stated that for P ≥3, the equations Un(P, 1) = k2,
respectively 2k2, can be treated similarly, with partial results.
D.
Powerful numbers in Lucas sequences
Let (P, Q) ∈S, and let U, respectively V , be the Lucas sequences
with parameters (P, Q). If Un is a powerful number, and if p is a
primitive factor of Un, then p2 divides Un. This suggests that the
set of indices n such that Un is powerful should be ﬁnite. A similar
remark applies to the sequence V .
A proof of this fact, based on Masser’s conjecture, is known for
Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.
Masser’s conjecture (1985), also called the (ABC) conjecture, is
the following statement (see also Oesterl´e (1988)):
Given ϵ > 0, there exists a positive number C(ϵ) such that if a, b,
c are positive integers with gcd(a, b) = 1, a + b = c, if g = 
p|abc p,
then c < C(ϵ)g1+ϵ. It is a great challenge for mathematicians to
prove the (ABC) conjecture. A much weaker form of the tantalizing
(ABC) conjecture was proved by Stewart (1986). Elkies (1991)
showed that the (ABC) conjecture implies the famous theorem of

42
1. The Fibonacci Numbers and the Arctic Ocean
Faltings (establishing Mordell’s conjecture). It is also known that
the (ABC) conjecture implies that there exist at most ﬁnitely many
integers n ≥3, x, y, z ̸= 0, such that xn +yn = zn. This is just short
of proving Fermat’s Last Theorem.
I learned the following from G. Walsh:
(5.23) If Masser’s conjecture is true, and if k ≥1 is a given square-
free integer, there exist only ﬁnitely many indices n such that the
Fibonacci number Un, or the Lucas number Vn, is of the form kt,
where t is a powerful number.
The proof is short and simple.
For any integer N = r
i=1 pei
i (where p1, . . . , pr are distinct primes
and e1, . . . , er ≥1), the powerful part of N is by deﬁnition
w(N) =

ei>1
pei
i .
So, N is powerful exactly when N = w(N).
In 1999, Ribenboim and Walsh proved, assuming the (ABC) con-
jecture to be true,
(5.24) Let U, V be Lucas sequences with positive discriminant. For
every ϵ > 0, the sets {n | w(Un) > Uϵ
n} and {n | w(Vn) > V ϵ
n}
are ﬁnite. In particular, each of the sequences U, V has only ﬁnitely
many terms which are powerful.
Noteworthy special cases arise taking P = 1, Q = −1 (Fibonacci
and Lucas numbers), P = 2, Q = −1 (Pell numbers), P = 3, Q = 2
and more generally P = a + 1 Q = a (while a > 1). In particular,
the (ABC) conjecture implies that there exist only ﬁnitely many
Mersenne numbers Mq and Fermat numbers Fm which are powerful.

Representation of Real
Numbers by Means of
Fibonacci Numbers
Our aim is to derive a new representation of positive real numbers
as sums of series involving Fibonacci numbers. This will be an easy
application of an old result of Kakeya (1941). The paper concludes
with a result of Landau (1899), relating the sum ∞
n=1
1
Fn with
values of theta series. We believe it worthwhile to unearth Landau’s
result which is now rather inaccessible.
1. Let (si)i≥1 be a sequence of positive real numbers such that s1 >
s2 > s3 > · · ·, and limi→∞si = 0. Let S = ∞
i=1 si ≤∞.
We say that x > 0 is representable by the sequence (si)i≥1 if
x = ∞
j=1 sij (with i1 < i2 < i3 < · · ·). Then, necessarily, x ≤S.
The ﬁrst result is due to Kakeya; for the sake of completeness,
we give a proof:
Proposition 1. The following conditions are equivalent:
1. Every x, 0 < x ≤S, is representable by the sequence (si)i≥1,
x = ∞
j=1 sij, where i1 is the smallest index such that si1 < x.
2. Every x, 0 < x ≤S, is representable by the sequence (si)i≥1.
3. For every n ≥1, sn ≤∞
i=n+1 si.
Proof.
(1) ⇒(2). This is trivial.
(2) ⇒(3). If there exists n ≥1 such that sn > ∞
i=n+1 si, let x
be such that sn > x > ∞
i=n+1 si. By hypothesis, x = ∞
j=1 sij with

52
2. Representation of Real Numbers by Means of Fibonacci Numbers
i1 < i2 < . . . . Since sn > x > si1, then n < i1, hence x = ∞
j=1 sij ≤
∞
k=n+1 sk, which is absurd.
(3) ⇒(1). Because limi→∞si = 0, there exists a smallest index i1
such that si1 < x. Similarly, there exists a smallest index i2 such
that i1 < i2 and si2 < x −si1.
More generally, for every n ≥1 we deﬁne in to be the small-
est index such that in−1 < in and sin < x −n−1
j=1 sij. Thus,
x ≥∞
j=1 sij.
Suppose that x > ∞
j=1 sij. We note that there exists N such that
if m ≥N, then sim < x −m
j=1 sij. Otherwise, there exist inﬁnitely
many indices n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · such that sink ≥x −nk
j=1 sij. At
the limit, we have
0 = lim
k→∞sink ≥x −
∞

j=1
sij > 0,
and this is a contradiction.
We choose N minimal with the above property.
We show: for every m ≥N, im + 1 = im+1. In fact,
sim+1 < sim < x −
m

j=1
sij,
so by deﬁnition of the sequence of indices, im + 1 = im+1. Therefore,
{iN, iN + 1, iN + 2, . . .} = {iN, iN+1, iN+2, . . .}.
Next, we show that iN = 1. If iN > 1 we consider the index iN −1,
and by hypothesis (3),
siN−1 ≤
∞

k=iN
sk =
∞

j=N
sij < x −
N−1

j=1
sij.
We have iN−1 ≤iN −1 < iN. If iN−1 < iN −1 this is impossible
because iN was deﬁned to be the smallest index such that iN−1 < iN
and siN < x −N−1
j=1 sij. Thus, iN−1 = iN −1, that is, siN−1 <
x −N−1
j=1 sij and this contradicts the choice of N as minimal with
the property indicated.
Thus iN = 1 and x > ∞
j=1 sij = ∞
i=1 si = S, contradicting the
hypothesis.

2. Representation of Real Numbers by Means of Fibonacci Numbers
53
We remark now that if the above conditions are satisﬁed for the
sequence (si)i≥1, and if m ≥0, then for every x such that 0 < x <
S = ∞
i=m+1 si, x is representable by the sequence (si)i≥m+1, with
i1 the smallest index such that m + 1 ≤i1 and si1 < x.
Indeed, condition (3) holds for (si)i≥1, hence also for (si)i≥m+1.
Since 0 < x < S, the remark follows from the proposition.
Proposition 1 has been generalized (see, for example, Fridy
(1966)). Now we consider the question of unique representation (this
was generalized by Brown (1971)).
Proposition 2. With the above notations, the following conditions
are equivalent:
(2′) Every x, 0 < x < S, has a unique representation x = ∞
j=1 sij.
(3′) For every n ≥1, sn = ∞
i=n+1 si.
(4′) For every n ≥1, sn =
1
2n−1 s1 (hence S = 2s1).
Proof.
(2′) ⇒(3′). Suppose there exists n ≥1 such that
sn ̸= ∞
i=n+1 si. Since (2′) implies (2), hence also (3), then sn <
∞
i=n+1 si. Let x be such that sn < x <
∞
i=n+1 si. By the
above remark, x is representable by the sequence {si}i≥n+1, that
is, x = ∞
j=1,kj≥n+1 skj. On the other hand, (2′) implies (2), hence
also (1), and x has a representation x = ∞
j=1 sij, where i1 is the
smallest index such that si1 < x. From sn < x it follows that i1 ≤n,
and so x would have two distinct representations, contrary to the
hypothesis.
(3′) ⇒(4′). We have sn = sn+1 + ∞
i=n+2 si = 2sn+1 for every
n ≥1, hence sn =
1
2n−1 s1 for every n ≥1.
(4′) ⇒(2′). Suppose that there exists an x such that 0 < x < S
and has two distinct representations

2. Now we give various ways of representing real numbers.
First, the dyadic representation, which may of course be easily
obtained directly:
Corollary 3. Every real number x, 0 < x < 1, may be written
uniquely in the form x = ∞
j=1

2nj (with 1 ≤n1 < n2 < n3 < · · ·).
Proof.
This has been shown in Proposition 2, taking s1 = 1

Corollary 4. Every positive real number x may be written in the
form x = ∞
j=1
1
nj (with n1 < n2 < n3 < · · ·).
Proof.
We consider the sequence (1/n)n≥1, which is decreasing
with limit equal to zero, and we note that ∞
n=1
1
n = ∞and 1
n ≤
2
n+1
for every n ≥1. Thus, by Kakeya’s theorem and the above remark,
every x > 0 is representable as indicated.
2
Corollary 5. Every positive real number x may be written as x =
∞
j=1
1
pij (where p1 < p2 < p3 < · · · is the increasing sequence of
prime numbers).
Proof.
We consider the sequence (1/pi)i≥1, which is decreasing
with limit equal to zero. As Euler proved, ∞
i=1
1
pi = ∞. By Cheby-
shev’s theorem (proof of Bertrand’s “postulate”) there is a prime
in each interval (n, 2n); thus pi+1 < 2pi and
1
pi <
2
pi+1 for every
i ≥1. By Kakeya’s theorem and the above remark, every x > 0 is
representable as indicated.

2. Representation of Real Numbers by Means of Fibonacci Numbers

3. Now we shall represent real numbers by means of Fibonacci
numbers and we begin giving some properties of these numbers.
The Fibonacci numbers are: F1 = F2 = 1, and for every n ≥3, Fn
is deﬁned by the recurrence relation Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2.
Thus the sequence of Fibonacci numbers is
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, . . . .
In the following proposition, we give a closed form expression for
the Fibonacci numbers; this is due to Binet (1843).
Let α =
√
5+1
2
(the golden number) and β = −
√
5−1
2
, so α + β = 1,
αβ = −1, and hence α, β are the roots of X2 −X −1 = 0 and
−1 < β < 0 < 1 < α.
We have
Lemma 6. For every n ≥1, Fn = αn−βn
√
5
and αn−1
√
5 < Fn < αn+1
√
5 .
Proof.
We consider the sequence of numbers Gn =
αn−βn
√
5
for
n ≥1. Then G1 = G2 = 1; moreover,
Gn−1 + Gn−2 = αn−1 −βn−1
√
5
+ αn−2 −βn−2
√
5
= αn−2(α + 1) −βn−2(β + 1)
√
5
= αn −βn
√
5
= Gn
because α2 = α+1 and β2 = β +1. Therefore, the sequence (Gn)n≥1
coincides with the Fibonacci sequence.
Now we establish the estimates.
If n ≥1, then
(−β)n = 1
αn < αn−1 = −αnβ = αn(α −1) = αn+1 −αn,
so
Fn = αn −βn
√
5
≤αn + (−β)n
√
5
< αn+1
√
5 .
Similarly, if n ≥2, then
(−β)n = 1
αn < αn−2 = −αn−1β = n −1(α −1) = αn −αn−1,

56
2. Representation of Real Numbers by Means of Fibonacci Numbers
so
Fn = αn −βn

this is also true when n = 1.

For every m ≥1 let Im = ∞

Proposition 8. For every positive real number x there exists a

Proof.
First, we note that each of the sequences (1/F 1/m
n
)n≥1 is
decreasing with limit equal to zero. By the above proposition, there
exists m ≥1 such that Im−1 < x ≤Im (with I0 = 0).
We observe that

Fn

Fn+1

because Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1 < 2Fn. By Proposition 1 and a previ-

ratio test.
Jacobi theta series, which are of crucial importance (for example,
in the theory of elliptic functions), are deﬁned as follows, for 0 <

θ2(0, q) = 2q1/4 + 2q9/4 + 2q25/4 + · · ·
θ3(0, q) = 1 + 2q + 2q4 + 2q9 + · · ·

Now we need to determine the coeﬃcient of βm (for m odd), re-
marking that since the series is absolutely convergent its terms may
be rearranged.
If m is odd and d divides m, then βm appears in the horizontal
line beginning with −βm/d with the sign



+
when d ≡3 (mod 4),
−
when d ≡1 (mod 4).

2. Representation of Real Numbers by Means of Fibonacci Numbers
59
Thus the coeﬃcient ϵm of βm is ϵm = δ3(m) −δ1(m) where
δ1(m) = #{d | 1 ≤d ≤m, d | m and d ≡1 (mod 4)},
δ3(m) = #{d | 1 ≤d ≤m, d | m and d ≡3 (mod 4)}.
A well-known result of Jacobi (see Hardy and Wright’s book,
page 241) relates the diﬀerence δ1(m) −δ3(m) with the number
r(m) = r2(m) of representations of m as sums of two squares. Pre-
cisely, let r(m) denote the number of pairs (s, t) of integers (including
the zero and negative integers) such that m = s2+t2. Jacobi showed
that
r(m) = 4[δ1(m) −δ3(m)].
It follows that the number r′(m) of pairs (s, t) of integers with
s > t ≥0 and m = s2 + t2 is
r′(m) =



r(m)

when m is not a square,
r(m) −4
8
+ 1 = r(m) + 4

when m is a square;
(the ﬁrst summand above corresponds to the representation of m as
a sum of two non-zero squares).
Therefore,
ϵm = −r(m)
4
=



−2r′(m)
when m is not a square,
−(2r′(m) −1)

Because m is odd, it follows that s ̸≡t (mod 2), and therefore

We may now express this formula in terms of Jacobi series. Namely,

Prime Number Records
The theory of prime numbers can be roughly divided into four main
inquiries: How many prime numbers are there? How can one produce
them? How can one recognize them? How are the primes distributed
among the natural numbers? In answering these questions, calcula-
tions arise that can be carried out only for numbers up to a certain
size. This chapter records the biggest sizes reached so far—the prime
number records.
All the world loves records. They fascinate us and set our imag-
inations soaring. The famous Guinness Book of Records, which has
appeared in surprisingly many editions, contains many noteworthy
and interesting occurrences and facts. Did you know, for example,
that the longest uninterrupted bicycle trip was made by Carlos Vieira
of Leiria, Portugal? During the period June 8–16, 1983, he ped-
alled for 191 hours nonstop, covering a distance of 2407 km. Or
did you know that the largest stone ever removed from a human
being weighed 6.29 kg? The patient was an 80-year-old woman in
London, in 1952. And nearer our usual lines of interest: Hideaki To-
moyoki, born in Yokohama in 1932, quoted 40 000 digits of πfrom
memory, a heroic exploit that required 17 hours and 20 minutes,
with pauses totalling 4 hours. Leaﬁng through the Guinness Book,
one ﬁnds very few scientiﬁc records, however, and even fewer records
about numbers.

3. Prime Number Records
63
Not long ago I wrote The Book of Prime Number Records (Riben-
boim (1996)), in which I discuss the feats of mathematicians in this
domain so neglected by Guinness. How this book originated is a story
worth telling. Approached by my university to give a colloquium
lecture for undergraduate students, I sought a topic that would be
not only understandable but interesting. I came up with the idea of
speaking about prime number records, since the theme of records is
already popular with students in connection with sports. The inter-
est of the students so exceeded my expectations that I resolved to
write a monograph based on this lecture. In the process, I learned
of so many new facts and records that the brief text I had planned
kept on expanding. Thanks to colleagues who supplied me with many
helpful references, I was at last able to complete this work.
I must confess that when preparing the lecture I did not know a lot
(indeed I knew very little!) about the theorems for primes and prime
number records. For me, all these facts, although quite interesting,
were not tied together. They seemed to be just isolated theorems
about prime numbers, and it was not clear how they could be woven
into a connected theory. But when one wishes to write a book, the
ﬁrst task is to shape the subject matter into a coherent whole.
The scientiﬁc method may be considered as a two-step process:
ﬁrst, observation and experiment—analysis; then formulation of the
rules, theorems, and orderly relationships of the facts—synthesis.
Stated in these terms, my task was thus to present a synthesis of
the known observations about prime numbers, with an emphasis on
the records achieved. Any originality of my work undoubtedly lies
in the systematic investigation of the interplay between theory and
calculation. This undertaking needs no justiﬁcation if one keeps in
mind what role the prime numbers have in the theory of numbers.
After all, the fundamental theorem of elementary number theory says
that every natural number N > 1 can be expressed in a unique way
(except for the order of the factors) as a product of primes. Prime
numbers are thus the foundation stones on which the structure of
arithmetic is raised.
Now, how did I go about organizing the theory of prime numbers?
I began by posing four direct, unambiguous questions:
1. How many prime numbers are there?
2. How can one generate primes?
3. How can one know if a given number is prime?

64
3. Prime Number Records
4. Where are the primes located?
As I shall show, out of these four questions the theory of prime
numbers naturally unfolds.
How Many Primes Are There?
As is well known, Euclid in his Elements proved that there are
inﬁnitely many primes, proceeding as follows: Assume that there are
only ﬁnitely many primes. Let p be the largest prime number and P
be the product of all primes less than or equal to p; then consider
the number P plus 1:
P + 1 = (

q≤p
q)+1.
Two cases are possible: either (a) P + 1 is prime, or (b) P + 1 is
not prime. But if (a) is true, P + 1 would be a prime number larger
than p. And if (b) holds, none of the primes q ≤p is a prime factor
of P + 1, so the prime factors of P + 1 are all larger than p. In
both cases the assumption that there is a largest prime p leads to a
contradiction. This shows that there must be an inﬁnite number of
primes.
From this indirect proof one cannot deduce a method for generat-
ing prime numbers, but it prompts a question: Are there inﬁnitely
many primes p such that the corresponding number P + 1 is also
prime? Many mathematicians have devoted calculations to this
question.
Record. p = 24029 is the largest known prime for which P + 1 is
also prime; here, P + 1 has 10387 decimal digits. This was found by
C. Caldwell in 1995.
There are many other proofs (but not quite inﬁnitely many) of the
existence of inﬁnitely many primes; each reveals another interesting
aspect of the set of all prime numbers. Euler showed that the sum
of the reciprocals of the prime numbers is divergent:
 1
p = ∞.

3. Prime Number Records
65
From this we again see that there cannot be only ﬁnitely many
primes. Euler’s proof can be found in many elementary books on
number theory or real analysis, such as Hardy and Wright (1979),
and permits an interesting deduction. For any ϵ > 0, no matter how
small, we know
∞

n=1
1
n1−ϵ < ∞.
Hence the prime numbers are closer together, or are less sparsely
scattered along the number line, than are numbers of the form n1−ϵ.
For example, the primes lie closer together than the squares n2, for
which Euler showed
∞

n=1

n2 = π2
6 .
Another simple and elegant proof that inﬁnitely many primes exist
was given by Goldbach. It clearly suﬃces to ﬁnd an inﬁnite se-
quence F0, F1, F2, F3, . . . of pairwise relatively prime natural numbers
(i.e., no two having a common divisor greater than 1); since each Fn
has at least one prime factor, then there are inﬁnitely many primes.
It is easy to prove that the sequence of Fermat numbers Fn = 22n +1
has this property. Clearly, neither Fn nor Fn+k (k > 0) is divisible
by 2; and if p is an odd prime factor of Fn, then 22n ≡−1 (mod p),
so that 22n−k = (22n)2k ≡1 (mod p). Thus Fn+k ≡2 (mod p), and
since p > 2, it follows that p does not divide Fn+k. I will devote
further attention to the Fermat numbers after the next section.
Generating Prime Numbers
The problem is to ﬁnd a “good” function f : N →{prime numbers}.
This function should be as easy to calculate as possible and, above
all, should be representable by previously well-known functions. One
may place additional conditions on this function, for example:
Condition (a).
f(n) equals the nth prime number (in the natural
order); this amounts to a “formula” for the nth prime number.
Condition (b).
For m ̸= n, f(m) ̸= f(n); this amounts to a
function that generates distinct primes, but not necessarily all the
primes.
One can also seek a function f deﬁned on N with integer values (but
not necessarily positive values) that fulﬁlls

66
3. Prime Number Records
Condition (c).
The set of prime numbers coincides with the set of
positive values of the function. This is a far looser requirement and
one that can be fulﬁlled in unexpected ways, as I shall later show.
To begin, let’s discuss formulas for prime numbers. There are
plenty of them! In fact many of us in younger days sought—often
with success—a formula for the nth prime number. Unfortunately,
all these formulas have one thing in common: They express the
nth prime number through functions of the preceding primes that
are diﬃcult to compute. Consequently, these formulas are useless for
deriving properties of the prime numbers. Nevertheless, I will give
as an illustration one such formula found in 1971. I do so in honor
of its discoverer, J. M. Gandhi, a mathematician who also worked
on Fermat’s Last Theorem.
To simplify the statement of the formula, I will introduce the
M¨obius function µ : N →Z, given by
µ(n) =









1
if n = 1,
(−1)r
if n is square-free and a product of
r distinct prime factors,
0
otherwise.
Now if p1, p2, p3, . . . is the sequence of prime numbers in increasing
order, set Pn−1 = p1p2 . . . pn−1; then Gandhi’s formula is
pn =

1 −log2

−1
2 +

d,Pn−1
µ(d)
2d −1



.
Here, log2 indicates the logarithm in base 2, and [x] denotes, as usual,
the largest integer less than or equal to the real number x. One can
see how diﬃcult it is to calculate pn using Gandhi’s formula!
Now I sketch the construction of a function that generates prime
numbers. E. M. Wright and G. H. Hardy in their famous book
(Hardy and Wright (1979)) showed that if ω = 1.9287800 . . . , and
if
f(n) =

22...2ω 

(with n twos),
then f(n) is prime for all n ≥1. Thus f(1) = 3, f(2) = 13,
and f(3) = 16381, but f(4) is rather hard to calculate and has

67
almost 5000 decimal places. However, as the exact value of ω de-
pends on knowledge of the prime numbers, this formula is ultimately
uninteresting.
Do any truly simple functions generate prime numbers? There
are no such polynomial functions because of the following negative
result:
For every f ∈Z[X1, . . . , Xm] there are inﬁnitely many m-tuples of in-
tegers (n1, . . . , nm) for which |f(n1, . . . , nm)| is a composite number.
Other similar negative results are plentiful.
Well, then, are there polynomials in just one indeterminate for
which many consecutive values are primes? More precisely: Let q be
a prime number. Find a polynomial of degree 1, in fact, a polynomial
of the form fq(X) = dX+q whose values at the numbers 0, 1, . . . , q−1
are all prime. Then fq generates a sequence of q prime numbers in
arithmetic progression with diﬀerence d and initial value q.
For small values of q ﬁnding fq is easy:
q

However, it is not known how to prove that this is possible for every
prime number q.
Records. In 1986, G. L¨oh gave the smallest values of d for two
primes:
For q = 11,
d = 1 536 160 080.
For q = 13,
d = 9 918 821 194 590.
One can also examine the related problem: to search for the longest
sequences of primes in arithmetic progression.
Record. The longest known sequence of primes in arithmetic pro-
gression consists of 22 terms in the sequence with ﬁrst term
a = 11 410 337 850 553 and diﬀerence d = 4 609 098 694 200 (work
coordinated by A. Moran, P. Pritchard, and A. Thyssen, 1993).

68
3. Prime Number Records
Euler discovered quadratic polynomials for which many val-
ues are primes. He observed that if q is the prime 2, 3, 5, 11,
17, or 41, then the values fq(0), fq(1), . . . , fq(q −2) of the polyno-
mial fq(X) = X2 + X + q are prime. (Evidently fq(q −1) = q2
is not prime, so this sequence of consecutive prime values is the
best one can hope for.) For q = 41 this gives 40 prime numbers:
41, 43, 47, 53, . . . , 1447, 1523, 1601.
The next question is obvious: Can one ﬁnd primes q > 41 for which
the ﬁrst q −1 values of Euler’s quadratic are all prime? If inﬁnitely
many such primes q exist, I could generate arbitrarily long sequences
of primes! However, the following theorems say this is not to be:
Theorem. Let q be a prime number. The integers fq(0), fq(1),
. . . , fq(q −2) are all primes if and only if the imaginary quadratic
ﬁeld Q(√1 −4q) has class number 1 (G. Rabinovitch, 1912).
(A quadratic ﬁeld K has class number 1 if every algebraic integer
in K can be expressed as a product of primes in K, and if any two
such representations diﬀer only by a unit, i.e., an algebraic integer
that is a divisor in 1 in K.)
Theorem. Let q be a prime number. An imaginary quadratic ﬁeld
Q(√1 −4q) has class number 1 if and only if 4q−1 = 7, 11, 19, 43, 67,
or 163, that is, q = 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, or 41.
The imaginary quadratic ﬁelds of class number 1 were determined
in 1966 by A. Baker and H. M. Stark, independently and free of
the doubt that clung to Heegner’s earlier work in 1952.
Thus the following unbeatable record has been attained:
Record. q = 41 is the largest prime number for which the values
fq(0), fq(1), . . ., fq(q −2) of the polynomial fq(X) = X2 + X + q are
all primes.
It is worth mentioning that in the solution of this quite harmless-
looking problem a rather sophisticated theory was required. Details
are given in Chapter 5.
I now turn to some polynomials whose positive values coincide with
the set of prime numbers. The astonishing fact that such polynomials
exist was discovered in 1971 by Yu. V. Matijaseviˇc in connection
with the tenth Hilbert problem. Here are the records, which depend
on the number of unknowns n and the degree d of the polynomial:

Recognizing Prime Numbers
Given a natural number N, is it possible to determine with a ﬁ-
nite number of calculations whether N is a prime? Yes! It suﬃces to
divide N by every prime number d for which d2 < N. If the remain-
der is nonzero every time, then N is prime. The trouble with this
method is that a large N requires a large number of calculations.
The problem, therefore, is to ﬁnd an algorithm A where the number
of computations is bounded by a function fA of the number of digits
of N, so fA(N) does not grow too fast with N. For example, fA(N)
should be a polynomial function of the number of binary digits of N,
which is 1+[log2(N)]. Essentially, this number is proportional to the
natural logarithm log N, since log2(N) = log N/ log 2.
This problem remains open—it is not known whether such a
polynomial algorithm exists. On the one hand, I cannot prove the
impossibility of its existence; on the other hand, no such algorithm
has yet been found. Eﬀorts in this direction have produced several
primality-testing algorithms. According to the point of view, they
may be classiﬁed as follows:
Algorithms for arbitrary numbers
Algorithms for numbers of special form
Algorithms that are fully justiﬁed by theorems
Algorithms that are based on conjectures
Deterministic algorithms
Probabilistic algorithms
To clarify these notions I oﬀer some examples.
One algorithm applicable to arbitrary numbers is that of G. L.
Miller (1976), the complexity of which can be estimated only with

70
3. Prime Number Records
the help of the generalized Riemann conjecture. Assuming this con-
jecture, for Miller’s algorithm the estimate fA(N) ≤C(log N)5 is
valid, where C is a positive constant. Thus this is an algorithm whose
polynomial growth rate remains uncertain. By contrast, the algo-
rithm of L. M. Adleman, C. Pomerance, and R. S. Rumely
(1983) possesses a completely assured complexity estimate, and
the number of computation operations as a function of the num-
ber of binary digits of N is bounded by (log N)C log log log N where
C is a constant. The complexity is therefore in practice not far
from polynomial, and this algorithm can be applied to an arbitrary
integer N.
Both of these algorithms are deterministic, unlike those I shall now
describe. First, I must introduce the so-called pseudoprime numbers.
Let a > 1 be an integer. For every prime p that does not divide a, Fer-
mat’s Little Theorem says ap−1 ≡1 (mod p). But it is quite possible
for a number N > 1 with aN−1 ≡1 (mod N) to be composite—in
which case we say N is pseudoprime for the base a. For example,
341 is the smallest pseudoprime for the base 2. Every base a has
inﬁnitely many pseudoprimes. Some among them satisfy an addi-
tional congruence condition and are called strong pseudoprimes for
the base a; they, too, are inﬁnite in number.
An algorithm is called a probabilistic prime number test if its ap-
plication to a number N leads either to the conclusion that N is
composite or to the conclusion that with high probability N is a
prime number. Tests of this type include those of R. Baillie and
S. S. Wagstaff (1980), and M. O. Rabin (1980). In these tests
one examines certain “witnesses.” Let k > 1 (for example, k = 30)
and let a1 = 2, a2 = 3, . . . , ak be primes that will serve as witnesses.
Should a witness fail to satisfy the condition aN−1
j
≡1 (mod N),
then N is surely composite. If for every witness aj the preceding
congruence holds (that is, if N is pseudoprime for the base aj, for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k) then N is with high probability a prime number. Ra-
bin’s test is similar, using more restrictive congruences which lead
to better probabilities. This test leads to the conclusion that N ei-
ther is certainly composite or with probability 1 −(1/4k) is prime.
For k = 30, then, the test gives a false result only once out of every
1018 values of N. These probabilistic tests are clearly very easy to
apply.

3. Prime Number Records
71
Now I turn to prime number tests applicable to numbers of the
form N ± 1, where many if not all of the prime factors of N are
known. The tests for N + 1 depend on a weak converse, due to
Pepin, of Fermat’s Little Theorem, while those for N −1 use the
Lucas sequence.
In 1877, Pepin showed that the Fermat numbers Fn = 22n +1 are
prime if and only if 3(Fn−1)/2 ≡−1 (mod Fn). The search for primes
among the Fermat numbers Fn has produced several records.
Record. The largest Fermat number known to be prime is F4 =
65537.
Record. F11 is the largest Fermat number all of whose prime factors
have been determined (R. P. Brent and F. Morain, 1988)
Record. F303088 is the largest Fermat number known to be compos-
ite; it has the factor 3 × 2303093 + 1 (J. Young, 1998).
Record. F24 is the smallest Fermat number not yet proven prime
or composite.
For the Mersenne numbers, Mq = 2q −1, with q a prime, one
applies the Lucas test (1878): Let S0 = 4, Sk+1 = S2
k −2, for k ≥0.
Then Mq is prime if and only if Mq is a divisor of Sq−2. This test
makes it possible to discover very large primes.
Record. To date, 37 Mersenne primes are known. The largest
Mersenne prime known, which is also the largest known prime to-
day, is Mq where q = 3 021 377 (you may easily compute that it
has more than 2 million digits). It was discovered in January 1998
by R. Clarkson, G. Woltman, S. Kunowski, et. al. The next
smaller Mersenne primes are Mq, with q = 2 976 221, and 1 398 269.
The search for new primes has intensiﬁed with the creation by
G. Woltman of a club (one could almost say) or, better, a true co-
operative research program entitled “The Great Internet Mersenne
Primes Search” (GIMPS). It mobilizes thousands of computers
throughout the world, and has led to the discovery of the three
largest known Mersenne primes. The algorithm implemented is a
modiﬁcation of the one due to R. E. Crandall and has been of
basic importance in this search.

72
3. Prime Number Records
Record. The largest known composite Mersenne number is Mq for
q = 72021 × 223630 −1 (Y. Gallot, 1998).
From 1876, when E. Lucas proved M127 prime, until 1989, the title
“largest prime number” was always held by a Mersenne prime. That
became true again in 1992, but in the three intervening years another
champion reigned: 391581 × 2216193 −1.
Record. The largest prime known today that is not a Mersenne
prime is 302627325 × 2530101 + 1 with 159 585 digits, discovered
in 1999 by R. Burrowes, P. Jobling, and Y. Gallot.
The Distribution of the Prime Numbers
At this point we know the following:
1. There are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.
2. There is no reasonably simple formula for the prime numbers.
3. One can determine whether a given number is prime if it is not
too large.
What can one say about the way the primes are distributed among
the natural numbers? Earlier I gave a hint in connection with Eu-
ler’s proof of the existence of inﬁnitely many primes: The primes
are closer together than are, for example, the squares. A quite simple
way to discuss the distribution of the primes is to count the num-
ber of primes less than a given number. For every real x > 0, set
π(x) = #{prime numbers p | p ≤x}. Thus, π is the function that
counts the prime numbers. To have a good idea of the behavior of π
we can compare it with simpler functions. This approach leads to
results of an asymptotic nature.
When only 15 years old, C. F. Gauss conjectured from his studies
of prime number tables that
π(x) ∼
x
log x.
That is, the limit of the quotient
π(x)
x/ log x,

3. Prime Number Records
73
as x →∞, exists and equals 1. An equivalent formulation is
π(x) ∼
 x
1
dt
log t.
The function on the right is called the logarithmic integral and is
denoted Li. Gauss’s assertion was proved in 1896 by J. Hadamard
and C. de la Vall´ee Poussin ; previously, P. L. Chebyshev had
shown that the limiting value, if it exists, must be 1.
This theorem belongs among the most signiﬁcant results in the
theory of prime numbers, for which reason it is customarily referred
to as the Prime Number Theorem. However, this theorem obviously
says nothing about the exact value of π(x). For that purpose we have
the famous formula that D. F. E. Meissel found in 1871 expressing
the exact value of π(x) in terms of π(y) for all y ≤x2/3 and prime
numbers p ≤x1/2.
Record. The largest value π(N) which has been exactly computed is
π(1020) = 2 220 819 602 560 918 840 done by M. Deleglise in 1997.
He also showed that π(4 185 296 581 467 695 669) = 1017.
The diﬀerences
π(x) −
x
log x

and
|π(x) −Li(x)|
do not remain bounded as x →∞. Evaluating these error terms as
exactly as possible is enormously important in applications of the
Prime Number Theorem. On the basis of tables it was ﬁrst conjec-
tured, and then proved (J. B. Rosser and L. Schoenfeld, 1962),
that for all x ≥17, x/ log x ≤π(x). This is interesting because, by
contrast, the diﬀerence Li(x) −π(x) changes sign inﬁnitely many
times, as J. E. Littlewood (1914) showed. In 1933, S. Skewes
showed that the diﬀerence Li(x) −π(x) is negative for some x0 with
x0 ≤eeee7.7
. As a matter of fact, this change in sign occurs much
earlier:
Record. The smallest x0 for which Li(x) < π(x) must be less than
6.69 × 10370 (H. J. J. te Riele, 1987).
The most important function for studying the distribution of
primes is the Riemann zeta function: For every complex number s

74
3. Prime Number Records
with Re(s) > 1, the series ∞
n=1 1/ns is absolutely convergent; it is
also uniformly convergent in every half-plane {s | Re(s) > 1 + ϵ} for
any ϵ > 0. The function ζ thus deﬁned can be extended by analytic
continuation to a meromorphic function deﬁned in the entire com-
plex plane, with only one pole. The pole is at the point s = 1, has
order 1, and the residue there is 1. It was the study of the properties
of this function that ultimately made the proof of the Prime Num-
ber Theorem possible. The function ζ has zeros at −2, −4, −6, . . ., as
one can easily show with the help of the functional equation satisﬁed
by ζ. All other zeros of ζ are complex numbers σ + it (t real) with
0 < σ < 1.
The so far unproved Riemann hypothesis says: The nontrivial zeros
of the Riemann zeta function are located on the critical line 1
2 + it
(t real). Without going into the details, I will just observe that many
theorems about the distribution of primes can be proved with the
assumption of the Riemann hypothesis. It is therefore of fundamental
importance to determine the nontrivial zeros of ζ. By symmetry
considerations, it suﬃces to determine the zeros with t > 0, which
can be listed in a sequence σn + itn, where tn ≤tn+1, and in case
tn = tn+1 we require that σn < σn+1. (It must ﬁrst be shown that
there are at most a ﬁnite number of zeros of ζ for each value of t.)
Record. For n ≤1 500 000 001 all the zeros σn + itn of the Rie-
mann zeta function are located on the critical line; that is, σn = 1
2.
These calculations were carried out in 1986 by J. van de Lune,
H. J. J. te Riele, and D. T. Winter.
Record. In 1974, N. Levinson showed that at least one third of
the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are on the critical line, and
in 1989, J. B. Conrey improved this result, replacing 1/3 by 2/5.
The foregoing considerations are based on the asymptotic behav-
ior of the function π and on the function ζ, which is very useful
for estimating the error terms. One can say that they deal with
the estimation of π “at inﬁnity.” Next I turn to the local behavior
of π—estimating the gaps between the prime numbers. Here the fun-
damental question is: Knowing the nth prime pn, where will one ﬁnd
the following prime pn+1? Thus, one is concerned with the sequence
of diﬀerences dn = pn+1 −pn. It is easy to see that lim sup dn = ∞,
that is, arbitrarily long blocks of consecutive composite numbers

3. Prime Number Records
75
exist. Here is one: For any N, the N consecutive numbers
(N + 1)! + 2, (N + 1)! + 3, . . . , (N + 1)! + (N + 1)
are composite. It has amused some mathematicians to ﬁnd the
largest blocks of consecutive composite numbers between fairly small
primes—the widest gaps between such primes.
Record. The largest gap between consecutive prime numbers that
has been eﬀectively computed consists of the 1131 composite numbers
which follow the prime p = 1 693 182 318 746 371. This was discovered
by B. Nyman in 1999.
The question about wide gaps between not too large primes can be
made more precise. Let us look at the sequence dn/pn of relative gaps.
As early as 1845, J. Bertrand postulated from a study of tables
that a prime always lies between pn and 2pn, for every n ≥1. It was
Chebyshev who ﬁrst proved this result, which can be written in the
form pn+1 < 2pn or, better, dn/pn < 1. This result, while amusing, is
much weaker than what can be deduced by using the Prime Number
Theorem:
lim
n→∞
dn
pn
= 0.
The investigation of gaps between prime numbers has led to the
following conjecture: For every ϵ > 0 the inequality pn+1 < pn +
p1/2+ϵ
n
holds for all suﬃciently large n.
Record. The latest entry in a long line, the current record is in the
work of S. Lou and Q. Yao in 1993: pn+1 < pn + p6/11
n
.
What about the limit inferior of the diﬀerence sequence dn? Two
prime numbers p and p′ (p < p′) are said to be twin primes if p′−p =
2. It is still not known if there are inﬁnitely many twin primes, i.e.,
if lim inf dn = 2. The question is delicate. In 1919, V. Brun showed
that the sum over all pairs of twin primes
 1
p +
1
p + 2

= B < ∞.
It follows that if there are inﬁnitely many twin primes, which one
expects to be the case, then they are thinly dispersed. In 1976, Brun’s
constant was calculated by R. P. Brent: B = 1.90216054.
Record. The largest known pair of twin primes is 361700055 ×
239020 ± 1 with 11755 digits, discovered by H. Lifchitz in 1999.

Conclusion
Lest this presentation grow to long, I have had to pass over many
fascinating questions, such as the behavior of primes in arithmetic
progression, to say nothing of the Goldbach conjecture. Fortunately,
these and many other facts have been both recorded and amply
explained in a book (Ribenboim (1991)) that is just waiting to be
read! I will close with two curiosities to work into your repertoire.
A repunit is an integer of the form Rn = 111 . . . 1, with n decimal
digits equal to 1. It is not known if there are inﬁnitely many prime
repunits, but there is the following record.
Record. H. C. Williams and H. Dubner showed in 1986
that R1031 is a prime number.
Only four other repunits that are primes are known: R2, R19, R23,
and R317.
I oﬀer one ﬁnal noteworthy record—but if you want to know why
and how it was found, you must ask H. Dubner.
Record. The largest known prime number whose digits are also all
prime is
723 232 523 232 272 325 252 × 103120 −1
1020 −1 + 1.
It has 3120 digits and was discovered by H. Dubner in 1992.
The observation and study of the prime numbers is a fruitful as
well as diverting activity. Mathematicians derive much enjoyment
from it, and that alone is worth the labor. In time, one comes
to consider the prime numbers as friends—friends who bring us
problems!

Selling Primes
I am a big shot in a factory that produces primes.
And I will tell you an interesting dialogue with a buyer, coming
from an exotic country.
The Dialogue
—Buyer: I wish to buy some primes.
—I (generously): I can give to you, free of charge, many primes:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, . . . .
—Buyer (interrupting my generous oﬀer): Thank you, sir; but I
want primes with 100 digits. Do you have these for sale?
—I: In this factory we can produce primes as large as you wish.
There is in fact an old method of Euclid, that you may have heard
about. If I have any number n of primes, say p1, p2, . . . , pn, we mul-
tiply them and add 1, to get the number N = p1p2 . . . pn + 1. Either
N is a prime or, if it is not a prime, we pick any prime dividing N. In
this way, it is easy to see that we get a prime, which is diﬀerent from
the ones we mixed. Call it pn+1. If we now mix p1, p2, . . . , pn, pn+1
as I already said, we get still another prime pn+2. Repeating this
procedure we get as many primes as we wish and so, we are bound
to get primes as large as we wish, for sure with at least 100 digits.

—Buyer: You are very nice to explain your procedure. Even in
my distant country, I have heard about it. It yields primes that may
be arbitrarily large. However, I want to buy primes that have exactly
100 digits, no more, no less. Do you have them?
—I: Yes. Long ago—at the beginning of last century, Bertrand
observed that between any number N > 1 and its double 2N, there
exists at least one prime number. This experimental observation was
conﬁrmed by a rigorous proof by Chebyshev. So I can ﬁnd the
primes p1, p2, p3 where
1099 < p1 < 2 × 1099
2 × 1099 < p2 < 4 × 1099
4 × 1099 < p3 < 8 × 1099.
—Buyer: This means that you have guaranteed 3 primes with
100 digits, and perhaps a few more. But I want to buy many primes
with 100 digits. How many can you produce?
—I: I have never counted how many primes of 100 digits could
eventually be produced. I have been told that my colleagues in other
factories have counted the total number of primes up to 1020. We usu-
ally write π(N) to denote the number of primes up to the number N.
Thus, the count I mentioned has given:
π(108) = 5 761 455
π(109) = 50 847 534
π(1012) = 37 607 912 018
π(1017) = 2 625 557 157 654 233
π(1018) = 24 739 954 287 740 860
π(1020) = 2 220 819 602 560 918 840.
Even though all primes up to 1020 have not yet been produced by
any factory, the count of π(1020) is exact.
—Buyer (a bit astonished):
If you cannot—as I understand—
know how many primes of each large size there are in stock, how can
you operate your factory and guarantee delivery of the merchandise?
—I:
Your country sells oil, does it not? You can estimate the
amount of oil at shallow depths quite accurately, but you cannot
measure exactly the entire amount underground. It is just the same
with us.

Gauss, one of the foremost scientists, discovered that
π(N) ∼
N
log N
for large values of N. This was conﬁrmed, just over a century ago,
with proofs given by Hadamard and de la Vall´ee Poussin.
—Buyer:
Do you mean that π(N) is approximately equal to
N/ log N, with a small error?
—I: Yes. To be more precise, the relative error, namely the ab-
solute value of the diﬀerence |π(N) −N/ log N|, divided by π(N),
tends to 0, as N increases indeﬁnitely.
—Buyer: Then, because of the error, you cannot be very speciﬁc
in your estimate. Unless you estimate the error.
—I: Correct (the buyer is not stupid . . .). Chebyshev showed,
even before the Prime Number Theorem was proved, that if N is
large, then
0.9
N
log N < π(N) < 1.1
N
log N .
To count primes with 100 digits:
0.9
1099
99 log 10 < π(1099) < 1.1
1099
990. log 10
0.9
10100
100 log 10 < π(10100) < 1.1
10100
100 log 10.
It is easy to estimate the diﬀerence π(10100)−π(1099), which gives
the number of primes with exactly 100 digits:
3.42 × 1097 < π(10100) −π(1099) < 4.38 × 1097.
—Buyer:
You are rich! I think you have more primes than we
have oil. But I wonder how your factory produces the primes with
100 digits. I have an idea but I’m not sure how eﬃcient my method
would be.
1. Write all the numbers with 100 digits.
2. Cross out, in succession, all the multiples of 2, of 3, of 5, . . . ,
of each prime p less than 1099. For this purpose, spot the ﬁrst
multiple of p, then cross out every pth number.

4. Selling Primes
81
What remains are the primes between 1099 and 10100, that is, the
primes with exactly 100 digits.
—I:
This procedure is correct and was already discovered by
Eratosthenes (in the 3rd century B.C.). In fact, you may stop
when you have crossed out the multiples of all the primes less than
1050.
However, this method of production is too slow. This explains why
the archeologists never found a factory of primes amongst the Greek
ruins, but just temples to Apollo, statues of Aphrodite (known as
Venus, since the time of Romans) and other ugly remains that bear
witness to a high degree of decadence.
Even with computers this process is too slow to be practical. Think
of a computer that writes 106 digits per second.
• There are 10100 −1099 = 1099 × 9 numbers with 100 digits.
• These numbers have a total of 10101 × 9 digits.
• One needs 1095×9 seconds to write these numbers, that is about
1.5 × 1094 minutes, that is about 25 × 1092 hours, so more than
1091 days, that is of the order of 3 × 1088 years, that is 3 × 1086
centuries!
And after writing the numbers (if there is still an After . . .) there is
much more to be done!
Before the buyer complained, I added:
—I: There are short cuts, but even then the method would still
be too slow. So, instead of trying to list the primes with 100 digits,
our factory uses fast algorithms to produce enough primes to cover
our orders.
—Buyer: I am amazed. I never thought how important it is to
have a fast method. Can you tell me the procedure used in your
factory? I am really curious. [Yes, this buyer was being too nosy.
Now I became convinced that he was a spy.]
—I: When you buy a Mercedes, you don’t ask how it was built.
You choose your favorite color, pink, purple, or green with orange
dots, you drive it and you are happy because everyone else is envious
of you.
Our factory will deliver the primes you ordered and we do better
than Mercedes. We support our product with a lifetime guarantee.
Goodbye, Sir.
[He may have understood: Good buy, Sir . . .]

After the Dialogue
I hope that after the dialogue with the spy-buyer, you became curious
to know about our fast procedure to produce large primes. I shall
tell you some of our most cherished secrets. In our factory there are
two main divisions.
1) Production of primes
2) Control of quality.
Production of Primes
One of the bases of our production methods was discovered long
ago by Pocklington (1914/16). I will state and prove his theorem
in the particular situation adapted to our production requirements.
Then, I shall discuss how it may be used to obtain, in a surprisingly
short time, primes with the required number of digits.
Criterion of Pocklington. Let p be an odd prime, let k be a
natural number such that p does not divide k and 1 ≤k < 2(p + 1);
and let N = 2kp + 1. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1) N is a prime.
2) There exists a natural number a, 2 ≤a < N, such that
akp ≡−1 (mod N)
and
gcd(ak + 1, N) = 1.
Proof.
(1) ⇒(2). Assume that N is a prime. As is known, there
is some integer a, 1 < a < N, such that aN−1 ≡1 (mod N), but
am ̸≡1 (mod N) if 1 < m < N −1; such a number a is called
a primitive root modulo N. Thus a2kp ≡1 (mod N), but akp ̸≡
1 (mod N); then akp ≡−1 (mod N). Also, ak ̸≡−1 (mod N),
otherwise a2k ≡1 (mod N), which is not true; so gcd(ak +1, N) = 1.
(2) ⇒(1). In order to show that N is a prime, we shall prove: If
q is any prime dividing N, then
√
N < q. It follows that N cannot
have two (equal or distinct) prime factors, so N is a prime.
So, let q be any prime factor of N. Then akp ≡−1 (mod q) and
a2kp ≡1 (mod q). Hence, gcd(a, q) = 1. Let e be the order of a

4. Selling Primes
83
modulo q, hence e divides q −1, by Fermat’s Little Theorem. Sim-
ilarly, e divides 2kp = N −1, because a2kp ≡1 (mod q). Note that
ak ̸≡1 (mod q), otherwise akp ≡1 (mod q); from akp ≡−1 (mod q),
it follows that q = 2 and N would be even, which is false.
From gcd(ak + 1, N) = 1, it follows that ak ̸≡−1 (mod q). Hence,
a2k ̸≡1 (mod q), thus e ∤2k = (N −1)/p. But e | N −1, so (N −1)/e
is an integer, hence p ∤(N −1)/e. Since N −1 = e((N −1)/e) and
p | N −1, then p | e, thus p | q −1. Also 2 | q −1, hence 2p | q −1,
so 2p ≤q −1 and 2p + 1 ≤q. It follows that N = 2kp + 1 <
2 × 2(p + 1)p + 1 = 4p2 + 4p + 1 = (2p + 1)2 ≤q2, therefore
√
N < q.
This concludes the proof.
2
The criterion of Pocklington is applied as follows to obtain
primes of a required size, say with 100 digits.
First step: Choose, for example, a prime p1 with d1 = 5 digits.
Find k1 < 2(p1 + 1) such that p2 = 2k1p1 + 1 has d2 = 2d1 = 10
digits or d2 = 2d1 −1 = 9 digits and there exists a1 < p2 satisfying
the conditions ak1p1
1
≡−1 (mod p2) and gcd(ak1
1 + 1, p2) = 1. By
Pocklington’s criterion, p2 is a prime.
Subsequent steps: Repeat the same procedure starting with the
prime p2 to obtain the prime p3, etc. . . . In order to produce a prime
with 100 digits, the process must be iterated ﬁve times. In the last
step, k5 should be chosen so that 2k5p5 + 1 has 100 digits.
Feasibility of the Algorithm
Given p and k, with 1 ≤k < 2(p + 1), k not a multiple of p, if
N = 2kp+1 is a prime, then it has a primitive root. It would be much
too technical to explain in detail the following results, some known to
experts, others still unpublished. It follows from a generalized form
of the Riemann hypothesis that if x is a large positive real number
and the positive integer a is not a square, then the ratio
#{primes q ≤x such that a is a primitive root modulo q}
#{primes q ≤x}
converges; if a is a prime, the limit is at least equal to Artin’s constant

4. Selling Primes
Better, given positive integers, a, b, not squares, and a large prime q,
the probability that a or b is a primitive root modulo q is much larger.
Taking a = 2, b = 3, it is at least 58%. The corresponding probabil-
ity increases substantially when taking three positive integers a, b, c
which are not squares.
This suggests that we proceed as follows. Given the prime p,
choose k, not a multiple of p, 1 ≤k < 2(p + 1). If N = 2kp + 1
is a prime, then very likely 2, 3 or 5 is a primitive root modulo N. If
this is not the case, it is more practical to choose another integer k′,
like k, and investigate whether N′ = 2k′p + 1 is a prime.
The question arises: what are the chances of ﬁnding k, such that
N is a prime? I now discuss this point.
1. According to a special case of Dirichlet’s famous theorem, (see
Ribenboim (1996), Ribenboim (1991)), given p there exist in-
ﬁnitely many integers k ≥1 such that 2kp + 1 is a prime. This
may be proved in an elementary way.
2. How small may k be, so that 2kp + 1 is a prime? A special case
of a deep theorem of Linnik asserts:
For every suﬃciently large p, in the arithmetic progression with
ﬁrst term 1 and diﬀerence 2p, there exists a prime p1 = 2kp + 1
satisfying p1 ≤(2p)L; here L is a positive constant (that is, L is
independent of p) (see Ribenboim (1996)).
3. Recently, Heath-Brown has shown that L ≤5.5.
4. In Pocklington’s criterion, it is required to ﬁnd k < 2(p + 1)
such that p1 = 2kp+1 is a prime. This implies that p1 < (2p+1)2.
No known theorem guarantees that such small values of k lead to
a prime.
5. Recent work of Bombieri, Friedlander, and Iwaniec deals
with primes p for which there are small primes p1 = 2kp + 1.
Their results, which concern averages, point to the existence of a
sizable proportion of primes p with small prime p1 = 2kp + 1.
The problems considered above are of great diﬃculty. In practice,
we may ignore these considerations and ﬁnd, with a few trials, the
appropriate value of k.

Estimated time to produce primes with 100 digits
The time required to perform an algorithm depends on the speed of
the computer and on the number of bit operations (i.e., operations
with digits) that are necessary.
As a basis for this discussion, we may assume that the computer
performs 106 bit operations per second. If we estimate an upper
bound for the number of bit operations, dividing by 106 gives an
upper bound for the number of seconds required.
A closer look at the procedure shows that it consists of a succes-
sion of the following operations on natural numbers: multiplication
ab modulo n, power ab modulo n, calculation of greatest common
divisor.
It is well-known (see LeVeque (1975), Mignotte (1991)) and
not diﬃcult to show that for each of the above operations there
exist C > 0 and an integer e ≥1 such that the number of bit
operations required to perform the calculation is at most Cde, where
d is the maximum of the number of digits of the numbers involved.
Combining these estimates gives an upper bound of the same form
Cde for the method (C > 0, e ≥1, and d is the maximum of the
number of digits of all integers involved in the calculation).
It is not my purpose to give explicit values for C and e, when
p, k, a are given. Let me just say that C, e are rather small, so
the algorithm runs very fast. I stress that in this estimate the time
required in the search of k, a is not taken into account.
The above discussion makes clear that much more remains to be
understood in the production of primes and the feasibility of the
algorithm. This task is delegated to our company’s division of re-
search and development, and I admire our colleagues in the research
subdivision who face the deep mysteries of prime numbers.
Before I rapidly tour our division of quality control, I would like
to make a few brief comments about our preceding considerations.
They concern the complexity of an algorithm.
An algorithm A, performed on natural numbers, is said to run in
polynomial time if there exist positive integers C, e (depending on the
algorithm) such that the number of bit operations (or equivalently,
the time) required to perform the algorithm on natural numbers with
at most d digits is at most Cde.
An algorithm which does not run in polynomial time is deﬁnitely
too costly to implement and is rejected by our factory. It is one

86
4. Selling Primes
of the main subjects of research to design algorithms that run in
polynomial time. The algorithm to produce primes of a given size,
for all practical purposes, runs in polynomial time, even though this
has not yet been supported by a proof.
Quality Control
The division of quality control in our factory watches that the primes
we sell are indeed primes. When Pocklington’s method is used we
need only worry that no silly calculation error was made, because it
leads automatically to prime numbers. If other methods are used, as
I shall soon invoke, there must be a control. The division of qual-
ity control also engages in consulting work. A large number N is
presented with the question: Is N a prime number?
Thus, our division of quality control also deals with tests of pri-
mality. Since this is a cash rewarding activity, there are now many
available tests of primality. I may brieﬂy classify them from the
following four points of view:
1. Tests for generic numbers.
Tests for numbers of special forms, like Fn = 22n + 1 (Fermat
numbers), Mp = 2p −1, (p prime, Mersenne numbers), etc. . . .
2. Tests fully justiﬁed by theorems.
Tests based on justiﬁcation that depends on forms of Riemann’s
hypothesis of the zeros of the zeta function, or on heuristic
arguments.
3. Deterministic tests.
4. Probabilistic or Monte Carlo tests.
A deterministic test applied to a number N will certify that N
is a prime or that N is a composite number. A Monte Carlo test
applied to N will certify either that N is composite, or that, with
large probability, N is a prime.
Before I proceed, let me state that the main problem tempting
the researchers is the following: Will it be possible to ﬁnd a fully
justiﬁed and deterministic test of primality for generic numbers, that
runs in polynomial time? Or will it be proven that there cannot
exist a deterministic, fully justiﬁed test of primality which runs in
polynomial time, when applied to any natural number?
This is a tantalizing and deep problem.

87
It would be long-winded and complex even to try to describe for
you all the methods and algorithms used in primality testing. So, I
shall concentrate only on the strong pseudoprime test, which is of
Monte Carlo type.
Pseudoprimes
Let N be a prime, let a be such that 1 < a < N. By Fermat’s Little
Theorem, aN−1 ≡1 (mod N).
However, the converse is not true. The smallest example is N =
341 = 11 × 31, with a = 2, 2340 ≡1 (mod 341).
The number N
is called a pseudoprime in base a, where
gcd(a, N) = 1, if N is composite and aN−1 ≡1 (mod N). For each
a ≥2, there are inﬁnitely many pseudoprimes in base a. Now observe
that every odd prime N satisﬁes the following property:
For any a, 2 ≤a < N, with gcd(a, N) = 1, writing N −1
in the form N −1 = 2sd (where 1 ≤s, d is odd), either
ad ≡1 (mod N) or there exists r, 0 ≤r < s, such that
a2rd ≡−1 (mod N).
(∗)
Again, the converse is not true, as illustrated by N = 2047 = 23×89,
with a = 2.
The number N is called a strong pseudoprime in base a, where
gcd(a, N) = 1, if N is composite and the condition (∗) is satisﬁed.
It has been shown by Pomerance, Selfridge, and Wagstaff
that for every a ≥2 there exist inﬁnitely many strong pseudoprimes
in base a.
The strong pseudoprime test
The main steps in the strong pseudoprime test for a number N are
the following:
1. Choose k > 1 numbers a, 2 ≤a < N, such that gcd(a, N) = 1.
This is easily done by trial division and does not require the
knowledge of the prime factors of N. If gcd(a, N) > 1 for some a,
1 < a < N, then N is composite.
2. For each chosen base a, check if the condition (∗) is satisﬁed.
If there is a such that (∗) is not satisﬁed, then N is composite.
Thus, if N is a prime, then (∗) is satisﬁed for each base a. The events

88
4. Selling Primes
that condition (∗) is satisﬁed for diﬀerent bases may be legitimately
considered as independent if the bases are randomly chosen.
Now, Rabin proved (see Ribenboim (1996)): Let N be composite.
Then the number of bases a for which N is a strong pseudoprime in
base a is less than 1
4(N −1). Thus, if N is composite, the probability
that (∗) is satisﬁed for k bases is at most 1/4k. Hence, certiﬁcation
that N is a prime when (∗) is satisﬁed for k distinct bases is incorrect
in only one out of 4k numbers; for example if k = 30, the certiﬁcation
is incorrect only once in every 1018 numbers.
The strong pseudoprime test runs in polynomial time and it is
applicable to any number.
If a generalized form of Riemann’s hypothesis is assumed to be
true, Miller showed (see Ribenboim (1996)): If N is composite,
there exists a base a, with gcd(a, N) = 1, such that a < (log N)2+ε,
for which (∗) is not satisﬁed.
A New Production Method
We may use Rabin’s test to produce numbers with 100 digits which
may be certiﬁed to be prime numbers, with only a very small
probability of error.
1. Pick a number N with 100 digits. Before doing any hard work, it
is very easy, with trial division, to ﬁnd out if this number does, or
does not have, any prime factor less than, say, 1000. In the latter
case, keep this number; in the ﬁrst case, discard N, pick another
number N′, and proceed similarly.
2. Use k = 30 small numbers a, prime to N, as bases to verify
if condition (∗) is satisﬁed. Discard N if, for some base a, the
condition (∗) is not satisﬁed and repeat the process with some
other number N′. If (∗) is satisﬁed for all a then, according to
Rabin’s calculation, we may certify that N is prime; in doing so,
we are incorrect only in at most one out of 1018 numbers. How
unlucky can we be and choose, in succession, numbers which are
composite? According to the inequalities of Chebyshev already
indicated, the proportion of numbers with 100 digits that are
prime is not less than
3.42
9×102 ≈
1
260 and not more than
4.38
9×109 ≈
1
205. Unintelligent employees who would pick even numbers, or
numbers divisible by 3, 5, . . . or small primes (say up to 1000) are

sure to be ﬁred. Thus the luck of picking a prime increases and it
becomes quite reasonable to use Rabin’s method of production.
We may sell the number N as if it were a prime, even with a
“money back guarantee” because the probability that we are selling
a composite number is only 1 in every 1 000 000 000 000 000 000
sales! This is a better guarantee than anyone can get in any deal.

Introduction
Can a non-constant polynomial with integral coeﬃcients assume only
prime values?
No! because of the following.
Theorem. If f(X) ∈Z[X], deg(f) > 0, there exist inﬁnitely many
natural numbers n such that f(n) is composite.
Proof.
It is true if f(n) is composite for every n ≥1. Assume
that there exists n0 ≥1 such that f(n0) = p is a prime. Since
limn→∞|f(n)| = ∞, there exists n0 ≥1 such that if n ≥n1 then
|f(n)| > p. Take any h such that n0+ph ≥n1. Then |f(n0+ph)| > p,
but f(n0 + ph) = f(n0) + (multiple of p) = multiple of p, so |f(n0 +
ph)| is composite.

On the other hand, must a non-constant polynomial f(X) ∈Z[X]
always assume at least one prime value?
∗This is the text of a lecture at the University of Rome, on May 8, 1986. The
original notes disappeared when my luggage was stolen in Toronto (!); however,
I had given a copy to my friend Paolo Maroscia, who did not have his luggage
stolen in Rome (!) and was very kind to let me consult his copy. It is good to

5. Euler’s Famous Prime Generating Polynomial
The question is interesting if f(X) is irreducible, primitive (that
is, the greatest common divisor of its coeﬃcients is equal to 1), and
even more, there is no prime p dividing all values f(n) (for arbitrary
integers n).
Bouniakowsky, and later Schinzel and Sierpi´nski (1958),
conjectured that any polynomial f(X) ∈Z[X] satisfying the above
conditions assumes a prime value. This has never been proved for
arbitrary polynomials. For the speciﬁc polynomials f(X) = aX + b,
with gcd(a, b) = 1, it is true—this is nothing else than the famous
theorem of Dirichlet: every arithmetic progression
{a + kb | k = 0, 1, 2, . . .}
with
gcd(a, b) = 1,
contains inﬁnitely many primes.
In my book entitled The New Book of Prime Number Records
(1995), I indicated many astonishing consequences of the hypothesis
of Bouniakowsky derived by Schinzel and Sierpi´nski. But this
is not the subject of the present chapter.
Despite the theorem and what I have just said, for many polyno-
mials it is easy to verify that they assume prime values, and it is even
conceivable that they assume prime values at many consecutive inte-
gers. For example, Euler’s famous polynomial f(X) = X2 +X +41
has the property that f(n) is a prime for n = 0, 1, . . . , 39 (40
successive prime values):
41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97, 113, 131, 151, 173, 197, 223, 251,
281, 313, 347, 383, 421, 461, 503, 547, 593, 641, 691, 743, 797,
853, 911, 971, 1033, 1097, 1163, 1231, 1301, 1373, 1447, 1523,
1601.
However, f(40) = 402 + 40 + 41 = 40 × 41 + 41 = 412.
Note that if n > 0, then (−n)2+(−n)+41 = (n−1)2+(n−1)+41,
so X2 + X + 41 assumes also prime values for all integers
n = −40, −39, . . . , −2, −1.
Which other polynomials are like the above?
Some of these polynomials may be easily obtained from X2+X +c
by just changing X into X −a, for some a ≥1. For example, (X −
a)2 + (X −a) + 41 = X2 −(2a −1)X + (a2 −a + 41); taking a = 1
gives X2 −X + 41, which assumes primes values for every integer n,

−39 ≤n ≤40, while taking a = 40, gives X2 −79X + 1601, which
assumes primes values for every integer n, 0 ≤n ≤79, but these are
the same values assumed by X2+X+41, taken twice. In summary, it
is interesting to concentrate the attention on polynomials of the form
X2 + X + c and their values at consecutive integers n = 0, 1, . . . . If
the value at 0 is a prime q, then c = q. Since (q−1)2+(q−1)+q = q2,
then at best X2 + X + q assumes prime values for 0, 1, 2, . . . , q −2
(such as q = 41). For example, if f(X) = X2 + X + q and q =
2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41, then f(n) is a prime for n = 0, 1, . . . , q−2. However,
if q = 7, 13, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 this is not true, as may be easily veriﬁed.
Can one ﬁnd q > 41 such that X2 + X + q has prime value for
n = 0, 1, . . . , q −2? Are there inﬁnitely many, or only ﬁnitely many
such primes q? If so, what is the largest possible q?
The same problem should be asked for polynomials of ﬁrst degree
f(X) = aX + b, with a, b ≥1. If f(0) is a prime q, then b = q. Then
f(q) = aq + q = (a + 1)q is composite. So, at best, aX + q assumes
prime values for X equal to 0, 1, . . . , q −1.
Can one ﬁnd such polynomials? Equivalently, can one ﬁnd arith-
metic progressions of q prime numbers, of which the ﬁrst number is
equal to q?
For small values of q this is not diﬃcult.
If q = 3, take: 3, 5, 7, so f(X) = 2X + 3.
If q = 5, take: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, so f(X) = 6X + 5.
If q = 7, take: 7, 157, 307, 457, 607, 757, 907, so f(X) = 150X +7.
Quite recently, Keller communicated to me that for q = 11, 13
the smallest such arithmetic progressions are given by polynomials
f(X) = d11X + 11, respectively f(X) = d13X + 13, with
d11 = 1536160080 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 7315048,
d13 = 9918821194590 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 4293861989;
this determination required a considerable amount of computation,
done by Keller and L¨oh.
It is not known whether for every prime q there exists an arith-
metic progression of q primes of which the ﬁrst number is q. Even the
problem of ﬁnding arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions consist-
ing only of prime numbers (with no restriction on the initial term
or the diﬀerence) is still open. The largest known such arithmetic
progression consists of 22 primes and was found by Pritchard,
Moran, and Thyssen (1995).

The determination of all polynomials f(X) = X2 + X + q such
that f(n) is a prime for n = 0, 1, . . . , q −2 is intimately related
with the theory of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds. In order to understand
this relationship, I shall indicate now the main results which will be
required.
1
Quadratic extensions
Let d be an integer which is not a square, and let K = Q(
√
d) be the
ﬁeld of all elements α = a + b
√
d, where a, b ∈Q. There is no loss
of generality to assume that d is square-free, hence d ̸≡0 (mod 4).
The ﬁeld extension K|Q is quadratic, that is, K is a vector space of
dimension 2 over Q.
Conversely, if K is a quadratic extension ﬁeld of Q, then it is
necessarily of the form K = Q(
√
d), where d is a square-free integer.
If d > 0, then K is a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld R of real numbers: it is
called a real quadratic ﬁeld.
If d < 0, then K is not a subﬁeld of R, and it is called an imaginary
quadratic ﬁeld.
If α = a + b
√
d ∈K, with a, b ∈Q, its conjugate is α′ = a −b
√
d.
Clearly, α = α′ exactly when α ∈Q.
The norm of α is N(α) = αα′ = a2 −db2 ∈Q. It is obvious
that N(α) ̸= 0 exactly when α ̸= 0. If α, β ∈K, then N(αβ) =
N(α)N(β); in particular, if α ∈Q, then N(α) = α2.
The trace of α is Tr(α) = α + α′ = 2α ∈Q. If α, β ∈K, then
Tr(α + β) = Tr(α) + Tr(β); in particular, if α ∈Q, then Tr(α) = 2α.
It is clear that α, α′ are the roots of the quadratic equation X2 −
Tr(α)X + N(α) = 0.
2
Rings of integers
Let K = Q(
√
d), where d is a square-free integer.
The element α ∈K is an algebraic integer when there exist
integers m, n ∈Z such that α2 + mα + n = 0.
Let A be the set of all algebraic integers of K. The set A is a
subring of K, which is the ﬁeld of fractions of A, and A ∩Q = Z. If
α ∈A, then the conjugate α′ is an element of A. Clearly, α ∈A if
and only if both N(α) and Tr(α) are in Z.

3 Discriminant
95
Here is a criterion for the element α = a + b
√
d(a, b ∈Q) to be an
algebraic integer: α ∈A if and only if



2a = u ∈Z,
2b = v ∈Z
u2 −dv2 ≡0 (mod 4).
Using this criterion, it may be shown:
If d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), then A = {a + b
√
d | a, b ∈Z}.
If d ≡1 (mod 4), then A =
&
1
2(a + b
√
d) | a, b ∈Z, a ≡b (mod 2)
'
.
If α1, α2 ∈A are such that every element α ∈A is uniquely of the
form α = m1α1 + m2α2, with m1, m2 ∈Z, then {α1, α2} is called an
integral basis of A. In other words, A = Zα1 ⊕Zα2.
If d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), then {1,
√
d} is an integral basis of A.
If d ≡1 (mod 4), then
&

is an integral basis of A.

Tr(α2

Tr(α1α2)
Tr(α1α2)
Tr(α2

discriminant of K. It is a non-zero integer.
If d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), then
D = det

Every discriminant D is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).

Decomposition of primes
Let K = Q(
√
d), where d is a square-free integer, and let A be the
ring of integers of K.
The ideal P ̸= 0 of A is a prime ideal if the residue ring A/P has
no zero-divisor.
If P is a prime ideal there exists a unique prime number p such
that P ∩Z = Zp, or equivalently, P ⊇Ap.
If I, J are non-zero ideals of A, it is said that I divides J when
there exists an ideal I1 of A such that I · I1 = J.
The prime ideal P containing the prime number p divides the
ideal Ap.
If I is a non-zero ideal of A, then the residue ring A/I is ﬁnite.
The norm of I is N(I) = #(A/I).
A.
Properties of the norm
lf I, J are non-zero ideals, then N(I, J) = N(I)N(J). If I divides J,
then N(I) divides N(J).
If α ∈A, α ̸= 0, then N(Aα) = |N(α)| (absolute value of the
norm of α). In particular, if a ∈Z then N(Aa) = a2.
If the prime ideal P divides Ap then N(P) is equal to p or to p2.
Every non-zero ideal I is, in a unique way, the product of powers
of prime ideals:
I =
n

i=1
P ei
i .
If I, J are non-zero ideals, and if I ⊇J, then I divides J.
Every ideal I ̸= 0 may be generated by two elements, of which
one may be chosen in Z; if I ∩Z = Zn, then I = An + Aα for some
α ∈A. In this case, the notation I = (n, α) is used.
Consider now the special case where p is a prime number. Then
Ap is of one of the following types:


Ap = P 2,
where P is a prime ideal: p is ramiﬁed in K.
Ap = P,
where P is a prime ideal: p is inert in K.
Ap = P1P2,
where P1, P2 are distinct prime ideals: p is
decomposed or splits in K.

4 Decomposition of primes
97
Note also that if Ap = I ·J, where I and J are any ideals (diﬀerent
from A), not necessarily distinct, then I and J must in fact be prime
ideals.
I shall now indicate when a prime number p is ramiﬁed, inert, or
decomposed, and also give generators of the prime ideals of A. There
are two cases: p ̸= 2 and p = 2.

Let p ̸= 2.
1) If p divides d, then Ap = (p,
√
d)2.
2) If p does not divide d and there does not exist a ∈Z such that
d ≡a2 (mod p), then Ap is a prime ideal.
3) If p does not divide d and there exists a ∈Z such that d ≡
a2 (mod p), then Ap = (p, a +

d)(p, a −

Hence,
1) p is ramiﬁed if and only if

2) p is inert if and only if

Proof.
The proof is divided into several parts. (a) If

then Ap is a prime ideal.
Otherwise, Ap = P · P ′ or P 2, with P ∩Z = Zp. Let α ∈A
be such that P = (p, α) ⊇Aα, so P | Aα, hence p divides N(P),
which in turn divides N(Aα) = |N(α)|. If p | α, then α

hence a2 ≡db2 (mod p), and so p ∤b (otherwise p | a, hence p | α,
which is absurd).

Let b′ be such that bb′ ≡1 (mod p), so (ab′)2 ≡d (mod p),
therefore either p | d or

(b) If

d

(c) If

d

Indeed,

because gcd(p, 2a) = 1. If one of the ideals (p, a +

So (p, a +

d), (p, a −

(p, a +

(p, a +

d, a −

d) = (p, a +

d, a −

d, 2a) = A,
which is absurd.
Finally, these three cases are exclusive and exhaustive, so the
converse assertions are also true.

Note. If d ≡1 (mod 4) and d ≡a2 (mod p), then

and 2l ≡1 (mod p). Hence, if

Indeed, a +

d = a −1 + 2ω. If 2l ≡1 (mod p), then

If

P = (p, a +

0 ≤a ≤p −1.
So, P = (p, b + ω) with 0 ≤b ≤p −1 and b ≡l(a −1) (mod p).
Since P ⊇A(b + ω), it follows that p divides N(P), which divides

Let p = 2.
If d ≡2 (mod 4), then A2 = (2,

If d ≡3 (mod 4), then A2 = (2, 1 +

If d ≡1 (mod 8), then A2 = (2, ω)(2, ω′).
If d ≡5 (mod 8), then A2 is a prime ideal.
Hence,
(1) 2 is ramiﬁed if and only if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
(2) 2 is inert if and only if d ≡5 (mod 8).
(3) 2 is decomposed if and only if d ≡1 (mod 8).
Proof.
The proof is divided into several parts.
(a) If d ≡5 (mod 8) then A2 is a prime ideal.
Otherwise, A2 = P · P ′ or P 2, with P ∩Z = Z2. Then there exists
α ∈A such that P = (2, α) ⊇Aα, so P divides Aα and 2 divides
N(P), which divides N(α).
If 2 | a, then P = A2

with a ≡b (mod 2),
so N(α) = a2−db2

. From 2 | N(α), then 8 divides a2−db2 ≡a2−5b2 ≡
a2 + 3b2 (mod 8).
If a, b are odd, then a2 ≡b2 ≡1 (mod 8), so a2 +3b2 = 4 (mod 8),
which is absurd. So a, b are even, a = 2a′, b = 2b′, and α = a′+b′√
d.
2 divides N(α) = (a′)2 −d(b′)2.
Since d is odd, then a′, b′ are both even or both odd. If a′, b′
are even, then 2 divides α, which is absurd. If a′, b′ are odd, then
α = a′ + b′√
d = (multiple of 2) + 1 +

d = (multiple of 2) + 2ω =

because ω + ω′ = 1.
Also, (2, ω) ̸= (2, ω′), otherwise these ideals are equal to their sum
(2, ω, ω′) = A, because ω + ω′ = 1.
(c) If d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), then A2 = (2,

First, let d = 4e + 2; then
(2,

d)2 = (4, 2
√
d, d) = A2(2,
√
d, 2e + 1) = A2,
so (2,

d) is a prime ideal.
Now, let d = 4e + 3; then
(2, 1 +

d, 2(e + 1) +

and so (2, 1 +

d) is a prime ideal.
Finally, these three cases are exclusive and exhaustive, so the

Units
The element α ∈A is a unit if there exists β ∈A such that αβ =
1. The set U of units is a group under multiplication. Here is a
description of the group of units in the various cases. First, let d < 0.
Let d ̸= −1, −3; then U = {±1}.
Let d = −1; then U = {±1, ±i}, with i = √−1.
Let d = −3; then U = {±1, ±ρ, ±ρ2}, with ρ3 = 1, ρ ̸= 1, i.e.
ρ = −1+√−3
2
.
Let d > 0. Then the group of units is the product U = {±1} × C,
where C is a multiplicative cyclic group. Thus C = {ϵn | n ∈Z},
where ϵ is the smallest unit such that ϵ > 1. The element ϵ is called
the fundamental unit.

The class number
The theory of quadratic number ﬁelds originated with the study of
binary quadratic forms aX2 +bXY +cY 2 (where a, b, c are integers,
and ac ̸= 0). The discriminant of the form is, by deﬁnition, D =
b2 −4ac. Note that D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4); let d = D/4 or d = D,
respectively.
An integer m is said to be represented by the form if there exist
integers x, y such that m = ax2 + bxy + cy2.
If a form a′(X′)2 + b′X′Y + c′(Y ′)2 is obtained from the above
form by a linear change of variables



X = hX′ + kY ′
Y = mX′ + nY ′
where h, k, m, n are integers and the determinant is hn −km = 1,
then the two forms represent the same integers. In this sense, it
is reasonable to consider such forms as being equivalent. Clearly,
equivalent forms have the same discriminant.
In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Gauss classiﬁed the binary quad-
ratic forms with a given discriminant D. Gauss deﬁned an operation
of composition between equivalence classes of forms of a given dis-
criminant. The classes constitute a group under this operation.
Gauss showed that, for any given discriminant D, there exist only
ﬁnitely many equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms.
The theory was later reinterpreted, associating to each form
aX2 +bXY +cY 2 of discriminant D, the ideal I of Q(
√
d) = Q(
√
D)
generated by a and −b+
√
D
2
. Deﬁne two non-zero ideals I, I′ to be
equivalent when there exists a non-zero element α ∈Q(
√
d) such that
I = Aα · I′. Then, equivalent binary quadratic forms correspond to
equivalent ideals, and the composition of classes of forms corresponds
to the multiplication of equivalence classes of deals. Thus, Q(
√
d) has
ﬁnitely many classes of ideals. Denote by h = h(d) the number of
classes of ideals, or class number of the ﬁeld Q(
√
d).
The class number h(d) = 1 exactly when every ideal of Q(
√
d) is
a principal ideal.
Gauss conjectured that for every h ≥1 there exist only ﬁnitely
many imaginary quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
d) (with d < 0) such that
the class number is equal to h. Soon, I shall say more about this
conjecture.

5. Euler’s Famous Prime Generating Polynomial
I shall now indicate how to calculate the class number of the
quadratic ﬁeld Q(
√
D). Deﬁne the real number θ as follows:
θ =

if D > 0,

√
−D
if D < 0.
A non-zero ideal I of A is said to be normalized if N(I) ≤[θ]
(the largest integer less than or equal to θ). The ideal I is said to be
primitiveif there does not exist any prime number p such that Ap
divides I.
Let N denote the set of normalized primitive ideals of A.
If I ∈N, and if p is a ramiﬁed prime, then p2 ∤N(I), and if p is
an inert prime, then p ∤N(I). So,
N(I) =

r ramiﬁed
r ×

p decomposed
pe(p).
It may be shown that every class of ideals contains a primitive
normalized ideal. Since for every m ≥1 there exist at most ﬁnitely
many ideals I of A such that N(I) = m, this implies, once more,
that the number of classes of ideals is ﬁnite.
Note that if N consists only of the unit ideal A = A·1, then h = 1.
Thus, if every prime p such that p ≤[θ] is inert, then h = 1. Indeed,
if I ∈N, then N(I) = 1, so I is the unit ideal, hence h = 1.
Denote by N(N) the set of integers N(I), where I ∈N.
In order to decide if the ideals I, J ∈N are equivalent, it will
be necessary to decide which integers m ∈N(N) are of the form
m = N(Aα).
Let m ≥1, and let
α =



when d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), with u, v ∈Z,
u+v
√
d

when d ≡1 (mod 4), with u, v ∈Z, u ≡v (mod 2).
It now follows that Aα is a primitive ideal with N(Aα) = m if and
only if

m = |u2 −dv2|
gcd(u, v) = 1
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4),

Let d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), m = N(Aα) = |u2 −dv2|, also

Calculation of the class number
Let d > 0, so θ = 1

[θ] = 1.
Since 1 ≤

2
√
D < 2, it follows that 4 ≤D < 16, with D ≡0
or 1
(mod 4), hence D ∈{4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13}, and therefore d ∈
{5, 2, 3, 13}.
Now N(N) = {1}, hence N consists only of the unit ideal, and
therefore h = 1.
[θ] = 2.
Since 2 ≤

2
√
D < 3, it follows that 16 ≤D < 36, with D ≡
0 or 1 (mod 4), hence D ∈{16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33} and
therefore d ∈{17, 21, 6, 7, 29, 33}.
Now, N(N) = {1, 2}.
Take, for example, d = 17. Since 17 ≡1 (mod 8), then it follows
that A2 = P · P ′, N(P) = N(P ′) = 2, 2 = 1
4|32 −17 × 12|, and

P ′ = Aα,

Therefore, the class number is h = 1.

5. Euler’s Famous Prime Generating Polynomial
Let d = 21. Since 21 ≡5 (mod 8), then A2 is a prime ideal, 2 is
inert, hence h = 1.
Let d = 6, then 2 divides 24 = D, so 2 is ramiﬁed, A2 = P 2, and
2 = |22 −6 × 12|, gcd(2, 1) = 1, hence P = Aα, with α = 2 +
√
6.
Therefore h = 1.
[θ] = 3.
Since 3 ≤1
2
√
D < 4, then 36 ≤D < 64, with D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4),
hence
D ∈{36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 57, 60, 61}
and, therefore,
d ∈{37, 10, 41, 11, 53, 14, 57, 15, 61}.
Now, N(N) = {1, 2, 3}.
Take, for example, d = 10. Since 2 divides 40 = D, then 2 is
ramiﬁed, A2 = R2. Since

= 1, then 3 is decomposed,
A3 = P · P ′. The ideals R, P, P ′ are primitive.
2 has no primitive representation: If 2 = |u2 −10v2|, then u2 =
10v2 ± 2 ≡±2 (mod 10), which is impossible.
3 has no primitive representation: If 3 = |u2 −10v2|, then u2 =
10v2 ± 3 ≡±3 (mod 10), which is impossible.
Thus, R, P, P ′ are not principal ideals. The ideals RP, RP ′ are
primitive. Also,
−2 × 3 = −6 = 22 −10 × 12,
gcd(2, 1) = 1,
2 × 3 = N(RP) = N(RP ′),
hence RP, RP ′ are principal ideals. In conclusion, h′ = 2.
Let d < 0, so θ = 2

[θ] = 1.
Since 1 ≤

Now N(N) = 1, hence N consists only of the unit ideal, so h = 1.
[θ] = 2.
Since 2 ≤

−D < 3, then π2 ≤|D| <

(mod 4), hence |D| ∈{11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20}, therefore d ∈
{−11, −15, −19, −5}.

6 The class number
105
Take, for example, d = −11. Since −11 ≡5 (mod 8), then 2 is
inert, and therefore h = 1.
Let d = −5. Since 2 divides D = −20, 2 is ramiﬁed, A2 = P 2.
2 has no primitive representation: If 2 = |u2 + 5v2| then u2 =
−5v2 + 2 ≡2 (mod 5), which is impossible. Also, −5 ≡3 (mod 4).
So, P is not principal and h = 2.
Let d = −15. Since −15 ≡1 (mod 8), then A2 = P · P ′.
2 has no primitive representation: if
2 = |u2 + 15v2|

then u2 + 15v2 = 8, so u2 ≡3 (mod 5), which is impossible. Also
−15 ≡1 (mod 4). Since P, P ′ are not principal ideals, then h = 2.
Let d = −19. Since −19 ≡5 (mod 8), 2 is inert, hence h = 1.
[θ] = 3.
Since 3 ≤

−D < 4, then 9π2

|D| ∈{23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 35, 36, 39},
and, therefore,
d ∈{−23, −6, −31, −35, −39}.
Take d = −31. Since −31 ≡1 (mod 8), then A2 = P · P ′. Since
−31 ≡1 (mod 8), then A2 = P · P ′. Since

it follows that A3 is a prime ideal.

then 8 = u2 + 31v2, which is impossible. Since −31 ≡1 (mod 4),
then P, P ′ are not principal ideals. If P, P ′ are equivalent, then
P = P ′.Aα, so P 2 = P · P ′ · Aα = A(2α), so UNREADABLE =
N(P 2) = 4N(Aα), hence N(Aα) = 1, thus Aα = A, and P = P ′,
which is absurd. In conclusion, h = 3.
These examples are enough to illustrate how to compute the class
number, at least for discriminants with small absolute value. There
are more sophisticated methods for calculating the class number
which are eﬀecient even for large values of |d|. These algorithms are
desribed in the books of Buell (1989) and Cohen (1993) which, of
course, also deal with real quadratic ﬁelds.

B.
Determination of all quadratic ﬁelds with class
number 1
Let d > 0.
It is conjectured that there exist inﬁnitely many d > 0 such that
Q(
√
d) has class number 1. This question is diﬃcult to settle, but it
is expected that the conjecture is true.
For example, there exist 142 ﬁelds Q(
√
d) with 2 ≤d < 500 having
class number 1.
Let d < 0.
It was seen that if N consists only of the unit ideal, then h = 1.
But conversely:
If d < 0 and h = 1, then N = {A}.
Proof.
If |D| ≤7, it is true. Let |D| > 7, I ∈N, and I ̸= A, so
there exists a prime ideal P dividing I. Then N(P) = p or p2, where
p is a prime number. If N(P) = p2, then p is inert and Ap = P
divides I, so I would not be primitive, a contradiction. If N(P) = p,
since P divides I, then p ≤N(I) ≤[θ] ≤2
π
,
|D|. If p has a primitive
representation:
If d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), then d = D
4 , so p = u2 −dv2, hence v ̸= 0,
therefore 2
π
,
|D| ≥p ≥|d| = |D|
4 , so 7 ≥64
π2 ≥|D|, which is absurd.
If d ≡1 (mod 4), then d = D, so p =
u2−dv2
4
, hence v ̸= 0,
therefore 2
π
,
|D| ≥p ≥|d|
4 = |D|
4 , and again 7 ≥D, which is absurd.
Therefore, P is not a principal ideal, and h ̸= 1, which contradicts
the hypothesis.
2
Gauss developed a theory of genera and proved:
If d < 0, and if t is the number of distinct prime factors of D, then
2t−1 divides the class number of Q(
√
d).
Hence, if h = 1, then D = −4, −8, or −p, where p is a prime,
p ≡3 (mod 4), hence d = −1, −2, or −p.
From this discussion, it follows:
If D = −3, −4, −7, −8, then h = 1.
If D ̸= −3, −4, −7, −8, and D = −p, p ≡3 (mod 4), then h =
1 if and only if N = {A}, and this is equivalent to the following
conditions:
2 is inert in Q(√−p) and if q is any odd prime, q ≤[θ], then

−p
q

= −1, i.e., q is inert in Q(√−p).

6 The class number
107
This criterion is used in the determination of all D < 0, |D| ≤200,
such that h = 1.
[θ] = 1.
This gives the discriminants D = −3, −4, −7, −8.
[θ] = 2.
Now −20 ≤D ≤−11, with D = p, p ≡3 (mod 4), so D = −11 or
−19.
Since −11 ≡5 (mod 8), then 2 is inert, so if D = −11, then h = 1.
Similarly, since −19 ≡5 (mod 8), 2 is inert, so if D = −19, then
h = 1.
[θ] = 3.
Now −39 ≤D ≤−23, with D = −p, p ≡3 (mod 4), so D = −23 or
−31. But −23 ̸≡5 (mod 8), −31 ̸≡5 (mod 8), so the class numbers
of Q(√−23) and of Q(√−31) are not 1.
[θ] = 4.
Now −59 ≤D ≤−40, D = −p, p ≡3 (mod 4), so D = −43, −47,
−59. Since −43 ≡5 (mod 8) and

−43
3

= −1, then Q(√−43) has
class number 1. Since −47 ̸≡5 (mod 8) and

−59
3

= 1, then 3 is
not inert. So the class numbers of Q(√−47) and of Q(√−59) are
not equal to 1.
The same calculations yield:
[θ] = 5: D = −67, with class number 1.
[θ] = 6: no discriminant.
[θ] = 7: no discriminant.
[θ] = 8: D = −163, with class number 1.
This process may continued beyond 200, but leads to no other
discriminant for which the class number is 1. Of course, this does
not allow us to decide whether there exists any other such discrimi-
nant, nor to decide whether there are only ﬁnitely many imaginary
quadratic ﬁelds with class number 1.
In a classic paper, Heilbronn and Linfoot showed in 1934, with
analytical methods, that besides the above examples there exists at
most one other value of d < 0 for which Q(
√
d) has class num-
ber 1. Lehmer showed that if such a discriminant d exists at all,

108
5. Euler’s Famous Prime Generating Polynomial
then |d| > 5 × 109. In 1952, Heegner proved that no other such d
could exist, but his proof contained some steps which were unclear,
perhaps even a gap. Baker reached the same conclusion in 1966
with his method involving eﬀective lower bounds on linear forms of
three logarithms; this is also reported in his article of 1971. At about
the same time, unaware of Heegner’s result, but with similar ideas
concerning elliptic modular functions, Stark proved that no further
possible value for d exists. So were determined all the imaginary
quadratic ﬁelds with class number 1. It was somewhat of an anticli-
max when in 1968 Deuring was able to straighten out Heegner’s
proof. The technical details involved in these proofs are far beyond
the scope of the present article.
This is the place to say that Gauss’s conjecture was also solved in
the aﬃrmative. Thanks to the work of Hecke, Deuring, Mordell,
and Heilbronn, it was established that if d < 0 and |d| tends to
inﬁnity, then so does the class number of Q(
√
d). Hence, for every
integer h ≥1 there exists only ﬁnitely many ﬁelds Q(
√
d) with d < 0,
having class number h.
The determination of all imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with class
number 2 was achieved by Baker, Stark, and Weinberger.
An explicit estimate of the number of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds
with a given class number was obtained by the eﬀorts of Siegel,
Goldfeld, and Gross and Zagier. For this matter, I suggest
reading the paper of Goldfeld (1985).

The main theorem
Theorem. Let q be a prime, let fq(X) = X2 +X +q. The following
conditions are equivalent:
(1) q = 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41.
(2) fq(n) is a prime for n = 0, 1, . . . , q −2.
(3) Q(√1 −4q) has class number 1.
Proof.
The implication (1) ⇒(2) is a simple veriﬁcation.
The equivalence of the assertions (2) and (3) was ﬁrst shown by
Rabinovitch in 1912. In 1936, Lehmer proved once more that
(2) ⇒(3), while (3) ⇒(2) was proved again by Szekeres (1974),
and by Ayoub and Chowla (1981) who gave the simplest proof.
The proof of (3) ⇒(1) follows from the complete determination of all

imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with class number 1. Since this implication
requires deep results, I shall also give the proof of (3) ⇒(2).
(2) ⇒(3). Let d = 1 −4q < 0, so d ≡1 (mod 4). If q = 2 or 3,
then d = −7 or −11 and Q(
√
d) has class number 1, as was already
seen. Assume now that q ≥5. It suﬃces to show that every prime
p ≤2
π
,
|d| is inert in Q(
√
d).
First, let p = 2; since q = 2t −1, then d = 1 −4q = 1 −4(2t −1) =
5 (mod 8), so 2 is inert in Q(
√
d).
Now let p ̸= 2, p ≤2
π
,
|d| <

|d| and assume that p is not inert.
Then

d
p

̸= −1 and, as was noted, there exists b ∈Z, 0 ≤b ≤p −1,
such that p divides N(b + ω), where ω = 1+

, that is, p divides
(b + ω)(b + ω′) = b2 + b(ω + ω′) + ωω′
= b2 + b + 1 −d

= b2 + b + q = fq(b).
It should be also noted that b ̸= p −1, otherwise as was shown, p
divides 1 −d = 4q, hence p = q <
,
|d| =
,
|1 −4q|, so q2 < 4q −1,
hence q = 2 or 3, against the hypothesis.
By hypothesis, fq(b) is therefore a prime number, hence √4q −1 >
p = fq(b) ≥fq(0) = q and, again, q = 2 or 3, against the hypothesis.
This shows that every prime p less than
2
π
,
|d| is inert, hence
h = 1.
(3) ⇒(1). If Q(√1 −4q) has class number 1, then d = 1 −4q =
−7, −11, −19, −43, −67, −163, hence q = 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41.
2
As I have already said, the proof is now complete, but it is still
interesting to indicate the proof of (3) ⇒(2).
Proof.
Assume that d = 1 −4q and that the class number of
Q(
√
−d) is 1. Then either d = −1, −2, −3, −7, or d < −7, so d = −p
with p ≡3 (mod 4) and q > 2.
As noted before, 2 is inert in Q(√−p), so p ≡3 (mod 8). Next, I
show that if l is any odd prime with l < q, then

l
p

= −1. Indeed,
if

l
p

= 1 then l splits in Q(√−p). But h = 1, so there exists an
algebraic integer α = a+b√−p
2
such that Al = Aα · Aα′. Then
l2 = N(Al) = N(Aα) · N(Aα′) = N(Aα)2 = N(α)2,

110
5. Euler’s Famous Prime Generating Polynomial
so l = N(α) = a2+b2p
4
. Hence p + 1 = 4q > 4l = a2 + b2p, thus
1 > a2 + (b2 −1)p and necessarily a2 = 0, b2 = 1, hence 4l = p,
which is absurd.
Now assume that there exists m, 0 ≤m ≤q−2, such that fq(m) =
m2 + m + q is not a prime. Then there exists a prime l such that
l2 ≤m2 + m + q and m2 + m + q = al, with a ≥1. Since m2 + m + q
is odd, then l ̸= 2. Also,
4l2 ≤(2m + 1)2 + p <
p −1
2
2
+ p =
p + 1
2

hence l < (p + 1)/4 = q. As was shown,

= −1. However,
4al = (2m + 1)2 + 4q −1 = (2m + 1)2 + p,

Gauss and the Class Number
Problem
1
Introduction
The theory of binary quadratic forms, one of the great achievements
of Gauss in number theory.
Some conjectures formulated by Gauss are still the object of con-
siderable research. This text∗contains also a succinct description
of the most signiﬁcant recent results concerning the conjectures of
Gauss on the class number.

Highlights of Gauss’ life
Carl Friedrich Gauss was born in Braunschweig in 1777 and died in
G¨ottingen in 1855.
He was a precocious child. This is illustrated by the following
well-known anecdote.
At age 8, when the pupils in his class angered the teacher, they
were given the following task: to add all the numbers from 1 to 100:
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100.
∗This is a much enlarged version of a lecture given at the First Gauss
Symposium, in Guaruj´a, Brazil, July 1989.

The teacher thought he would have long moments of respite. But
he was wrong, as the young Gauss readily handed the solution:
5050. Astonished, the teacher asked how he got such a quick answer.
Explained the child:
“I imagined the numbers 1 to 100 written in a row, and then again
the same numbers written in another row, but backwards:
1
2
3
. . .
98
99

I noted that the two numbers in each column added to 101. There
are 100 columns; this gives a total of 10100, but I have counted each
number twice, so the sum asked is one-half of 10100, that is, 5050.”
I cannot swear that this had happened as I have just told, but as
the Italians say, “se non `e vero, `e ben trovato”.
The young Gauss gave many more indications of his superior intel-
ligence, being excellent in all subjects, especially classical languages
and mathematics.
At age 11, Gauss entered the Gymnasium. His talents were rec-
ognized as soon as 1792 when at age 15 he received a stipend from
the Duke of Braunschweig which would allow him to continue his
studies without ﬁnancial worries.
Gauss calculated with gusto. For example, he computed tables of
prime numbers (when still very young) and also quadratic residues,
primitive roots modulo primes, inverses of prime numbers written
with many decimal digits, etc . . . .
The results of his calculations served as a basis for conjectures
and statements, which, throughout his career, he would try to prove,
often with great success.
Gauss entered the university at G¨ottingen, where he could beneﬁt
from a rich library. There he studied Bernoulli’s Ars Conjectandi,
Newton’s Principia, as well as the works of Euler, Lagrange,
and Legendre.
Gauss had very wide interests in Mathematics, and also in
Astronomy, Geodesy, and Physics.
The following brief table of some of Gauss’ earlier mathematical
discoveries is an indication of his striking achievements, which would
continue unabated all through his life.

Publication of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (Gauss (1801)), a landmark in
number theory, widely translated and very inﬂuential, Gauss pre-
sented in an organized way his discoveries of the preceding years,
completing and clarifying the work of his predecessors Fermat,
Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.
This book contains: the theory of congruences (with the happy
introduction of the notation a ≡b (mod n)); indeterminate linear
equations; binary quadratic forms; indeterminate quadratic equa-
tions; cyclotomy; and the construction of regular polygons with ruler
and compass.
While still young, Gauss’ attention veered to other subjects in
mathematics, astronomy, and physics. Since this chapter concerns
binary quadratic forms, I abstain from discussing his contributions to
other topics. For a recent and enlightening critical study of Gauss,
see Kaufmann-B¨uhler (1981), where attention is given to other
facets of Gauss’ work. It is also instructive to consult Gauss’ diary
(see Gauss’ Werke (1870)) and the commentary by Gray (1984).

Brief historical background
One of the famous discoveries of Fermat concerns the representation
of prime numbers as sums of squares.
Let p be a prime number. Then p = x2 + y2 (with integers x, y) if
and only if p = 2 or p ≡1 (mod 4). In this event, the representation
of p is unique (with 0 < x < y when p ̸= 2). With the Legendre
symbol, the condition is rephrased as follows: p = 2 or (−1/p) = +1.

Similarly, p = x2 + 2y2 (with integers x, y) if and only if p = 2 or
p ≡1 or 3 (mod 8); equivalently, p = 2 or (−2/p) = +1. Again, the
representation is unique (with 0 < x, y).
In the same way, p = x2 + 3y2 (with integers x, y) if and only if
p = 3 or p ≡1 (mod 3), or equivalently, p = 3 or (−3/p) = +1.
Again, the representation is unique (with 0 < x, y).
Nevertheless, Euler knew that the condition p = 5 or p ≡1, 3, 7
or 9 (mod 20), or, equivalently, p = 5 or (−5/p) = +1, expresses
that the prime p is of the form p = x2 + 5y2 or p = 2x2 + 2xy + 3y2
(with integers x, y). Actually, Euler conjectured that p = x2 + 5y2
if and only if p = 5 or p ≡1 or 9 (mod 20). However, the proof of
this conjecture involves the theory of genera.
Lagrange and Legendre studied the more general problem:
given the integers a, b, c, represent the integer m in the form
m = ax2 + bxy + cy2,
where x, y are integers.
In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Gauss presented systematically
and in depth the results of Euler, Legendre, and Lagrange,
and developed the theory well beyond his predecessors.
The historical development of the fascinating theory of binary
quadratic forms is thoroughly described in the excellent books of
Weil (1984) and Edwards (1977).

Binary quadratic forms
A binary quadratic form (or simply, a form) is a homogeneous
polynomial of degree 2 in two indeterminates
Q = aX2 + bXY + cY 2,
with coeﬃcients a, b, c ∈Z.
A simple notation is Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩.
In his theory, Gauss had good reasons to consider only the forms
with b even; respecting the tradition still today, this restriction is
observed in some presentations of the theory. The results for the
more general theory, which was considered by Eisenstein, can be
easily related to those obtained by Gauss for the forms ⟨a, b, c⟩with
b even.

116
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
The form Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩is said to be primitive if gcd(a, b, c) = 1.
If ⟨a, b, c⟩is any form and d = gcd(a, b, c), then the form ⟨a
d, b
d, c
d⟩is
primitive. This us allows to pass from arbitrary forms to the primitive
ones.
The discriminant of Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩is D = D(Q) = b2 −4ac. The
discriminant is also denoted Discr(Q).
An integer D is the discriminant of some form if and only if D ≡
0 or 1 (mod 4). Indeed, a discriminant satisﬁes one of the above
congruences. Conversely,



if D ≡0 (mod 4), let P = ⟨1, 0, −D
4 ⟩,
if D ≡1 (mod 4), let P = ⟨1, 1, −D+1
4
⟩.
Then P has discriminant D, and it is called the principal form of
discriminant D.
If D = D(Q) is a square, then
aQ =
 
aX −−b +
√
D
2
Y
!  
aX −−b −
√
D
2
Y
!
,
so it is the product of linear factors with integral coeﬃcients. This
case is degenerate, and therefore it will be always assumed that the
discriminant is not a square. Thus, ac ̸= 0.
An integer m is a value of Q, or is represented by Q, if there
exist integers x, y such that m = Q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2; each
such relation is said to be a representation of m by Q. If, moreover,
gcd(x, y) = 1, then one speaks of primitive values and primitive
representations.
The set of values of Q is
{values of Q} = {mt2 | m is a primitive value of Q and t ∈Z}.
The forms are classiﬁed as follows:
deﬁnite forms when D < 0;
indeﬁnite forms when D > 0.
If the form Q is indeﬁnite, then it clearly assumes positive as well
as negative values.
It is easy to see that if Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩and D = b2 −4ac < 0, then
the following conditions are equivalent:

4 Binary quadratic forms
117
1. a > 0;
2. c > 0;
3. Q(x, y) > 0 for all non-zero integers x, y.
In this case, Q is said to be positive deﬁnite when a > 0, and
negative deﬁnite when a < 0.
Since positive deﬁnite forms ⟨a, b, c⟩correspond to negative
deﬁnite forms ⟨−a, −b, −c⟩, it suﬃces to study positive deﬁnite
forms. Thus, unless stated to the contrary, all forms with negative
discriminant will be positive deﬁnite forms.
The following notions will be useful later.
It is convenient to say that the conjugate of the form Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩
is the form ¯Q = ⟨a, −b, c⟩. Clearly, Q, ¯Q have the same discriminant
and Q is positive deﬁnite if and only if ¯Q is also.
The roots of the form Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩are
ω = −b +
√
D
2a
(the ﬁrst root) and
η = −b −
√
D
2a
(the second root).
The following notation will be used.
If D is any discriminant, let QD be the set of all forms when D > 0
(respectively, all positive deﬁnite forms when D < 0); similarly, let
Prim(QD) be the subset of QD consisting of primitive forms.
Let
Q =
-
{QD | D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4)}
and
Prim(Q) =
-
{Prim(QD) | D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4)}.
Let D
≡0 or 1
(mod 4). D is said to be a fundamental
discriminant when every form with discriminant D is primitive.
It is easy to see that this happens if and only if
1. whenever D ≡1 (mod 4), then D is square-free,
2. whenever D ≡0 (mod 4), then D = 4D′ with D′ square-free and
D′ ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
Thus, the fundamental discriminants are of the form
D = ±q1q2 · · · qr,
or
D = ±4q2 · · · qr,
or
D = ±8q2 · · · qr,
where q1, q2, . . . , qr are distinct odd primes.

118
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
On the other hand, not every discriminant D of one of the above
forms is fundamental, e.g., D = −4 × 3.
Every discriminant D is uniquely expressible in the form D0f2
where D0 is a fundamental discriminant and f ≥1. D0 is called the
fundamental discriminant associated to the discriminant D.
The following bijection is easy to establish:
QD −→
-
e|f
Prim(QD/e2).
In particular, if D = D0 is a fundamental discriminant, then QD =
Prim(QD).
5
The fundamental problems
The theory of binary quadratic forms deals with the following
problems:
Problem 1. Given integers m and D, D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4), to
ﬁnd if there exists a primitive representation of m by some form
of discriminant D.
In the aﬃrmative, consider the next questions:
Problem 2. To enumerate all the forms Q ∈QD such that m has
a primitive representation by Q.
Problem 3. For each Q ∈QD such that m has a primitive
representation by Q, to determine all the representations of m by Q.
In order to solve the problems, it is necessary to study the
equivalence of forms.

Equivalence of forms
Let GL2(Z) denote the linear group of rank 2 over Z; it consists of
all matrices
A =
	
α
β
γ
δ

with α, β, γ, δ ∈Z and αδ −βγ = ±1.

6 Equivalence of forms
119
Let SL2(Z) consist of those matrices A ∈GL2(Z) such that αδ −
βγ = 1. It is a normal subgroup of GL2(Z) of index 2, called the
special linear group of rank 2 over Z.
The group GL2(Z) acts on the set Q of forms in the following way.
If A =
	
α
β
γ
δ

∈GL2(Z), let TA : Q →Q be the map deﬁned as
follows.
If Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩, Q′ = ⟨a′, b′, c′⟩, then
TA(⟨a, b, c⟩) = ⟨a′, b′, c′⟩
where
(∗)







a′ = aα2 + bαγ + cγ2 = Q(α, γ),
b′ = 2aαβ + b(αδ + βγ) + 2cγδ,
c′ = aβ2 + bβδ + cδ2 = Q(β, δ).
Thus,
Q′(X, Y ) = Q(αX + βY, γX + δY ).
It is easy to see that if A, A′ ∈GL2(Z), then TAA′(Q) =
T ′
A(TA(Q)). Q is a primitive form if and only if TA(Q) is a primitive
form.
The mapping TA is the identity map if and only if A = ±I, where
I =
	
1
0

1

is the identity matrix.
The forms Q, Q′ are said to be equivalent if there exists A ∈
GL2(Z) such that Q′ = TA(Q). This fact is denoted by Q ∼Q′, and
it is easy to see that this relation is an equivalence relation.
The forms Q, Q are properly equivalent if there exists A ∈SL2(Z)
such that Q′ = TA(Q); the notation is Q ≈Q′, and, again, this is
an equivalence relation. The proper equivalence class of Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩
shall be denoted Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩.
Clearly, if Q ≈Q′, then also Q ∼Q′.
Each equivalence class is either the union of two proper equiv-
alence classes or just a proper equivalence class. For example, for
every integer a ̸= 0, every form equivalent to ⟨a, 0, a⟩is also properly
equivalent to ⟨a, 0, a⟩.

120
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
It is easy to note that if Q ∼Q′, then Q, Q′ have the same set
of values; thus an integer is represented by Q if and only if it is
represented by Q′. Similarly, Q and Q′ have the same set of primitive
values.
Furthermore, if Q ∼Q′ then Discr(Q) = Discr(Q′).
If D ≡0, 1 (mod 4), let Cl+(QD) denote the set of proper equiva-
lence classes of forms with discriminant D, and let Cl+(Prim QD) be
the subset of proper equivalence classes of primitive forms. The sim-
ilar notations Cl(QD), Cl(Prim QD) are used for sets of equivalence
classes.
It is a fundamental fact that in general, for a given discriminant,
there exist more than one equivalence class of primitive forms.
Thus for example, the forms ⟨1, 0, 5⟩, ⟨2, 2, 3⟩are primitive with
discriminant −20. They cannot be equivalent, since 5 is a value of
the ﬁrst, but not of the second form, as easily veriﬁed by observing
that 2x2 + 2xy + 3y2 ̸≡1 (mod 4) for all integers x, y.

Conditional solution of the fundamental
problems
Solution of Problem 1. Given m and D, D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4), there
exists a primitive representation of m by some form of discriminant D
if and only if there exists n such that D ≡n2 (mod 4m).
The proof oﬀers no diﬃculty. First, observe the following:
If m has a primitive representation by Q ∈QD, then there exists
n ∈Z such that D ≡n2 (mod 4m) and Q ∼⟨m, n, l⟩, with l = n2−D
4m .
Indeed, there exist integers α, γ such that gcd(α, γ) = 1 and m =
Q(α, γ). Let β, δ be integers such that αδ −βγ = 1, and let A =
 α β
γ δ

∈SL2(Z); let Q′ = TA(Q), so Q′ = ⟨m, n, l⟩∈QD (for some
n, l); thus D = n2 −4ml, hence D ≡n2 (mod 4m) and l = n2−D
4m .
Conversely, if there exists n such that D ≡n2 (mod 4m), let
l = n2−D
4m , so ⟨m, n, l⟩∈QD and m has a primitive representation
by ⟨m, n, l⟩.
For example, if m = 4, D = 17, then 4 has a primitive rep-
resentation by the form ⟨4, 1, −1⟩, which has discriminant D =
17.
Solution of Problem 2. Suppose that n1, . . . , nk are the integers
such that 1 ≤ni ≤2m and D ≡n2
i
(mod 4m). Then m has a

7 Conditional solution of the fundamental problems
121
primitive representation by the form Q ∈QD if and only if Q ≈
⟨m, n, l⟩, where n ≡ni (mod 2m) for some i, and l = n2−D
4m .
One implication is clear. Conversely, as indicated in the solution
of Problem 1, if m has a primitive representation by Q ∈QD then
there exists n such that D ≡n2 (mod 4m) and Q ≈⟨m, n, l⟩where
l = n2−D
4m . If n ≡n′ (mod 2m), with 1 ≤n′ ≤2m, then D ≡n2 ≡
n′2 (mod 4m), so n′ = ni (for some i).
This gives a procedure to ﬁnd the forms Q which provide a
primitive representation of m (once Problem 4 is solved).
For example, 4 has a primitive representation by a form Q of
discriminant 17 if and only if Q is properly equivalent to one of the
forms ⟨4, 1, −1⟩, ⟨4, 7, 2⟩.
Solution of Problem 3. Let m = Q(α, γ), with gcd(a, γ) = 1,
be a primitive representation of m by the form Q. Then there exist
integers β, δ which are unique such that A =
 α β
γ δ

∈SL2(Z)
and TA(Q) = ⟨m, n, l⟩with D ≡n2 (mod 4m), 1 ≤n ≤2m ,
l = n2−D
4m . This is not hard to show by noting that if β0, δ0 are such
that αδ0 −γβ0 = 1, then all the possible pairs of integers (β, δ) such
that αδ −βγ = 1 are given by



β = β0 + kα
δ = δ0 + kγ
for any k ∈Z.
It is possible to choose k in a unique way, such that
n = 2aαβ + b(αδ + βγ) + 2cγδ
where 1 ≤n < 2m and D ≡n2 (mod 4m).
The representation m = Q(α, γ) is said to belong to n, when
n is determined as above. Conversely, to every n, such that 1 ≤
n < 2m, D ≡n2 (mod 4m), and Q ≈⟨m, n, l⟩, it corresponds, for
example, to the following representation: if TA(Q) = ⟨m, n, l⟩, with
A =
 α β
γ δ

∈SL2(Z), then m = TA(Q)(1, 0) = Q(α, γ). Clearly,
this representation belongs to n.
It remains to describe all primitive representations belonging to
the same value n. If m = Q(α, γ) = Q(α′, γ′) are primitive represen-
tations, if (β, δ), (β′, δ′) are the unique pairs of integers such that
A =
 α β
γ δ

, A′ =
	
α′ β′
γ′ δ′

∈SL2(Z), with TA(Q) = ⟨m, n, l⟩,

122
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
TA′(Q) = ⟨m, n′, l′⟩and 1 ≤n, n′ < 2m, l = n2−D
4m , l′ = n′2−D
4m , then
n = n′ if and only if there exists B ∈SL2(Z) such that A′ = BA and
TB(Q) = Q.
So, the enumeration of all possible primitive representations of m
by Q requires the solutions of the following problems:
Problem 4. If Q, Q′ are forms of a given discriminant, to decide
whether Q and Q′ are equivalent (respectively properly equivalent)
or not.
More precisely, it is required to ﬁnd a ﬁnite algorithm to solve this
problem.
Problem 5. For any form Q, to determine the set
{B ∈SL2(Z) | TB(Q) = Q}.
This set, which is clearly a subgroup of SL2(Z), is called the auto-
morph of Q. It is, in fact, the stabilizer of Q by the action of SL2(Z)
on the set of forms.
Note that if Q
≈
Q′ and if A0
∈
SL2(Z) is such that
TA0(Q) = Q′, then {A ∈SL2(Z) | TA(Q) = Q′} = {BA0 |
B in the automorph of Q}.
Indeed, if TB(Q) = Q, then TBA0(Q) = Q′. Conversely, if TA(Q) =
Q′, then TAA−1
0 (Q) = Q, so AA−1
0
= B is in the automorph of Q and
A = BA0.

Proper equivalence classes of deﬁnite forms
Let D < 0, D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).
The main idea in this study of proper equivalence classes of posi-
tive deﬁnite forms, is to select, in an appropriate way, special reduced
forms, as I shall indicate now.
Lemma 1. If Q ∈QD, then there exists ⟨a, b, c⟩such that Q ≈
⟨a, b, c⟩and |b| ≤a ≤c.
Proof.
Let Q = ⟨m, n, l⟩, let ϵ = ±1 be such that ϵn = |n|. If
A =

and
b =

123
then
TA(Q) = ⟨m, n −2ϵm, m + l −|n|⟩= ⟨m′, n′, l′⟩,
TB(Q) = ⟨m + l −|n|, n −2ϵl, l⟩= ⟨m′, n′, l′⟩.
If |n| > m, then in TA(Q), m′ + l′ < m + l.
If |n| > l, then in TB(Q), m′ + l′ < m + l.
By repeating this process, one reaches a form ⟨a, b, c⟩in the same
class, with |b| ≤a, |b| ≤c.
If a ≤c, stop. If c < a, let C =

0 1
−1 0

, then TC(⟨a, b, c⟩) =
⟨c, −b, a⟩.
2
It is important to observe that if Q ≈⟨a, b, c⟩with |b| ≤a ≤c,
then
a = inf{Q(α, β) | α, β integers, Q(α, β) ̸= 0},
ac = inf{Q(α, β)Q(γ, δ) | α, β, γ, δ integers, αδ −βγ ̸= 0}.
Thus a, c, and hence also |b|, are uniquely deﬁned by Q. It follows
that if ⟨a, b, c⟩≈⟨a′, b′, c′⟩with |b| ≤a ≤c, and |b′| ≤a′ ≤c′, then
a = a′, c = c′, b = ±b′. Moreover in this situation, ⟨a, b, c⟩≈⟨a, −b, c⟩
if and only if a = |b|, or a = c, or b = 0.
Combining these facts, the main result is the following:
If Q ∈QD, there exists a unique form ⟨a, b, c⟩∈QD such that
Q ≈⟨a, b, c⟩and
(Red)



|b| ≤a ≤c
if |b| = a or c = a, then b ≥0.
The forms satisfying the condition (Red) above, are called the
reduced positive deﬁnite forms with discriminant D.
It should also be noted that if Q, Q′ ∈QD then the following
conditions are equivalent.
(1) Q ≈Q′ or Q ≈¯Q′ ( ¯Q′ denotes the conjugate of Q′)
(2) Q ∼Q′
(3) {values of Q} = {values of Q′}.
The only non-trivial implication is (3) ⇒(1). Let Q0 = ⟨a, b, c⟩,
Q′
0 = ⟨a′, b′, c′⟩be reduced forms such that Q ≈Q0, Q′ ≈Q′
0, so Q0,

124
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
Q′
0 have the same sets of values. By the characterization of a, c, a′,
c′ as inﬁma of values, then it follows that a = a′, c = c′, and since
these forms have the same discriminant, then |b| = |b′|. Therefore,
Q ≈Q′ or Q ≈¯Q′.
It should be noted that Schinzel (1980) showed that there exist
forms Q, Q′ with diﬀerent discriminants but with the same sets of
values; for example, Q = ⟨1, 0, 3⟩and Q′ = ⟨1, 1, 1⟩.
Numerical example of reduction of a deﬁnite form
Let ⟨2, 5, 4⟩∈Q−7. Then
⟨2, 5, 4⟩≈⟨2, 1, 1⟩≈⟨1, −1, 2⟩≈⟨1, 1, 2⟩.
It is easy to see that if ⟨a, b, c⟩∈QD is a reduced form, then

Thus, the number of reduced forms is ﬁnite and equal to the num-
ber of proper equivalence classes; it follows also that the number of
equivalence classes is ﬁnite.
It is useful to ﬁx the following notations.
Let
˜h(D) = number of equivalence classes of QD,
h(D) = number of equivalence classes of Prim(QD),
˜h+(D) = number of proper equivalence classes of QD,
h+(D) = number of proper equivalence classes of Prim(QD).
The following inequalities are trivial: h(D) ≤˜h(D), h+(D) ≤
˜h+(D) and h(D) ≤h+(D) ≤2h(D), ˜h(D) ≤˜h+(D) ≤2˜h(D). As
examples will show, the above numbers may actually be distinct.
From the bijection given in §4, it is easy to show that if D = D0f2,

also, if D is a fundamental discriminant,

Numerical example
To calculate h+(−303) and to determine all reduced forms with
discriminant D = −303:
b ∈B exactly when b is odd and 0 < b < 10, thus B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
It is easy to see that A1 = {1, 2, 4}, A3 = {3, 6}, A5 = 0, A7 = {8},
and A9 = 0. According to the deﬁnition of n(a, b),
˜h+(−303) = n(1, 1) + n(1, 2) + n(1, 4) + n(3, 3) + n(3, 6) + n(7, 8)
= 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 10.
Since −303 is a fundamental discriminant, then h+(−303)
=
˜h+(−303) = 10.
Here is the explicit determination of the reduced forms of
discriminant −303:

So, the reduced forms are ⟨1, 1, 76⟩, ⟨2, 1, 38⟩, ⟨4, 1, 19⟩, ⟨1, −1, 76⟩,
⟨2, −1, 38⟩, ⟨4, −1, 19⟩, ⟨3, 3, 26⟩, ⟨6, 3, 13⟩, ⟨6, −3, 13⟩, ⟨8, 7, 11⟩, and
⟨8, −7, 11⟩.
From this, it follows that ˜h(−303) = h(−303) = 6.

Another numerical example
If D = −72 = 9 × (−8), the associated fundamental discriminant is
D0 = −8.
The same method yields
h(−72) = h+(−72) = 2,
h(−8) = h+(−8) = 1.
Thus ˜h(−72) = ˜h+(−72) = 3, with the reduced forms ⟨1, 0, 18⟩,
⟨2, 0, 9⟩, and ⟨3, 0, 6⟩(this last one not primitive).

Proper equivalence classes of indeﬁnite forms

The form Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩∈QD is said to be a reduced indeﬁnite form

reduced form.
Here is the easy algorithm to enumerate all the reduced forms
in QD.

For each integer b, 0 < b <
√
D, such that 4 divides D −b2, factor
the integer (D −b2)/4 in all possible ways.
For each factorization (D −b2)/4 = ac, with a, c > 0, check if the

are satisﬁed. If not, reject the factorization. If (∗) is satisﬁed, then
the forms ⟨a, b, −c⟩, ⟨−a, b, c⟩, ⟨c, b, −a⟩, ⟨−c, b, a⟩are reduced with
discriminant D; note that there are only two distinct forms when
a = c.
Numerical example
The reduced forms with discriminant D = 52 must have b even,
0 < b < 52, 4 dividing 52 −b2; thus b = 2, 4, or 6. If b = 2,
then −ac = 52−4
4
= 12; moreover,
√
52 −2 < 2|a|, 2|c| <
√
52 + 2,
so (a, c) = (±3, ∓4), (±4, ∓3). If b = 4, then −ac =
52−16
4
= 9;
moreover,
√
82 −4 < 2|a|, 2|c| <
√
52 + 4, so (a, c) = (±3, ∓3). If
b = 6, then ac < 0, ac =
52−36
4
= 4; moreover
√
52 −6 < 2|a|,
2|c| <
√
52 + 6, so (a, c) = (±1, ∓4), (±2, ∓2), (±4, ∓1).
Thus the reduced forms are ⟨±3, 2, ∓4⟩, ⟨±4, 2, ∓3⟩, ⟨±1, 6, ∓4⟩,
⟨±2, 6, ∓2⟩, and ⟨±4, 6, ∓1).
Lemma 2. Every Q ∈QD is equivalent to a reduced form.
Proof.
Let Q = ⟨m, n, l⟩. It will be shown that there exists
⟨a, b, c⟩≈Q, such that |a| ≤|c|,
√
D −2|a| < b <
√
D; by a previous
remark, ⟨a, b, c⟩is a reduced form.
Let λ = [
√
D] and consider the set of 2|l| integers {λ + 1 −2|l|,
λ+2−2|l|,. . ., λ}. Then there exists a unique n′, λ+1−2|l| ≤n′ ≤λ
such that n ≡−n′ (mod 2|l|). Let
δ = −n + n′
2|l|
and
A =

.
Then TA⟨m, n, l⟩= ⟨l, n′, l′⟩, with l′ = m + nδ + lδ2 and
√
D −2|l| <
n′ <
√
D.
If |l| > |l′|, repeat the argument. Since it cannot always be |l| >
|l′| > |l′′| > · · ·, one reaches a form ⟨a, b, c⟩≈Q, with |c| ≤|a| and
√
D −2|a| < b <

6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
Numerical example of reduction of an indeﬁnite form
Let ⟨76, 58, 11⟩∈Q20. Then
⟨76, 58, 11⟩≈⟨11, −14, 4⟩≈⟨4, −2, −1⟩≈⟨−1, 4, 5⟩.
It may be shown that there exist only ﬁnitely many forms ⟨a, b, c⟩∈
QD with ac < 0. Hence, there are only ﬁnitely many reduced forms,
and it may be concluded:
The number of proper equivalence classes of indeﬁnite forms with
discriminant D is ﬁnite. Therefore, the number of proper equivalence
classes of Prim(QD) is ﬁnite, and so are the numbers of equivalence
classes of QD and of Prim(QD).
As in the case of positive deﬁnite forms, the following notation
will be used:
˜h+(D), h+(D) for the numbers of proper equivalence classes of
QD, Prim(QD) respectively;
˜h(D), h(D) for the numbers of equivalence classes of QD,
Prim(QD).
And again, the following inequalities are trivial:
h+(D) ≤˜h+(D),
h(D) ≤˜h(D),
h(D) ≤h+(D) ≤2h(D),
˜h(D) ≤˜h+(D) ≤2˜h(D).
If D = D0f2, where D0 is a fundamental discriminant, then
˜h(D) =

e|f
h
D
e2

and
˜h+(D) =

e|f
h+
D
e2

.
Hence, if D is a fundamental discriminant, then ˜h+(D) = h+(D) and
˜h(D) = h(D). As examples show, h(D), h+(D) (respectively, ˜h(D),
˜h+(D)) may actually be distinct.
It is essential to study the case when two reduced forms are
properly equivalent.
Let RD denote the set of reduced forms in QD.
If Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩∈RD, there exists a unique properly equivalent
form Q′ = ⟨c, b′, c′⟩∈RD such that 2c | b + b′, and there exists
a unique properly equivalent form Q′′ = ⟨a′′, b′′, a⟩∈RD such that
2a | b+b′′. The form Q′ is said to be right-adjacent, and Q′′ is said to
be left-adjacent to Q. Necessarily 2|c| divides b + b′ and 2|a| divides

9 Proper equivalence classes of indeﬁnite forms
129
b+b′′. Let Q′ = p(Q), Q′′ = λ(Q); then Q = λ(Q′), Q = ρ(Q′′). Note
that ρ(Q) = TA(Q) where
A =
	
0

−1
δ

,
and δ is unique. The actual determination of δ will be indicated later,
but it should already be noted that aδ > 0.
Since RD is ﬁnite, for every Q ∈RD there exist indices i < i + k,
such that if Q1 = ρ(Q), Q2 = ρ(Q1), . . . , then Qi = Qi+k; but
Qi−1 = λ(Qi) = λ(Qi+k) = Qi+k−1, . . . , and this gives Q = Qk. Let
k ≥1 be the minimal possible. Then the set {Q = Q0, Q1, . . . , Qk}
is called the period of Q. Clearly, this set is also the period of each
Qi(1 ≤i ≤k). Thus, RD is partitioned into periods; forms in the
same period are clearly properly equivalent. The converse is one of
the main results in the theory:
If Q, Q′ ∈RD and Q ≈Q′, then Q, Q′ are in the same period.
Thus ˜h+(D) is equal to the number of periods and, similarly, h+(D)
is the number of periods of primitive reduced forms.
It is not diﬃcult to see that the number of forms in each period is
even.
There is a very interesting relation between periods and continued
fraction expansions.
The fact that a form ⟨a, b, c⟩is reduced may be expressed in terms
of the roots ω, η of the form. Namely, ⟨a, b, c⟩is reduced if and only
if |w| > 1, |η| < 1, and ωη < 0.
If {Q = Q0, Q1, . . . , Q2r−1} is the period of the reduced form Q,
let ρ(Qi) = TAi(Qi) = Qi+1, where Ai =

. Let ωi, ηi be the
roots of the form Qi. Then
|ωi| =
1
|δi| + |ωi+1|
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 2r −1 and |ωr| = |ω0|.
So,
|ω| = [|δ0|, |δ1|, . . . , |δr−1|],
that is, |δ0|, |δ1|, . . . , |δr−1| are the partial quotients in the regular
continued fraction expansion of the quadratic irrational number ω;
moreover, this expansion is purely periodic.
It is also true that if Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩is a form with discriminant
D > 0, and if

which is purely periodic with period having length r, and partial
quotients |δ0|, |δ1|, . . . , |δr−1|, then Q is a reduced form, its period
has 2r elements when r is odd, r elements when r is even and it is
equal to {Q = Q0, Q1, . . . , Q2r−1}, with

δ3 = −1, δ4 = 3, δ5 = −1. Let Qi+1 = TAi(Qi) (for i = 0, 1, . . . , 5);
then the period of ⟨4, 2, −4⟩consists of this form and the forms
⟨−4, 6, 2⟩, ⟨2, 6, −4⟩, ⟨−4, 2, 4⟩, ⟨4, 6, −2⟩, and ⟨−2, 6, 4⟩.
The other period is {⟨1, 8, −1⟩, ⟨−1, 8, 1⟩}. Thus ˜h+(68) = 2, while
h+(68) = 1. Also, ˜h(68) = 2, h(68) = 1.

Another numerical example
Let D = 76 = 4 × 19 (it is a fundamental discriminant). The
reduced forms are ⟨±3, 4, ∓5⟩, ⟨±5, 4, ∓3⟩, ⟨±2, 6, ∓5⟩, ⟨±5, 6, ∓2⟩,
⟨±1, 8, ∓3⟩, and ⟨±3, 8, ∓1⟩.
To calculate the period of ⟨3, 4, −5⟩, its ﬁrst root is ω = −2+
√
19
3
.
The regular continued fraction expansion of ω is ω = [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 2]
and the period of ⟨3, 4, −5⟩is {⟨3, 4, −5⟩, ⟨−5, 6, 2⟩, ⟨2, 6, −5⟩,
⟨−5, 4, 3⟩, ⟨3, 8, −1⟩, ⟨−1, 8, 3⟩}.
There is another period consisting of the other six reduced forms.
Thus h+(76) = 2, while h(76) = 1.
10
The automorph of a primitive form
Recall that the automorph of a form Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩consists of all the
A ∈SL2(Z) such that TA(Q) = Q.
The description of the automorph requires a preliminary study of
the behavior of the roots of Q, under the action of any A ∈GL2(Z).
Thus, let Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩, with roots ω, η; let A ∈GL2(Z) and let
Q′ = TA(Q) have roots ω′, η′.
If ζ ∈{ω′, η′}, then
(γζ′ + δ)2Q
αζ′ + β
γζ′ + δ , 1

= Q(αζ′ + β, γζ′ + δ) = Q′(ζ′, 1) = 0;
since γζ′ + δ ̸= 0, then αζ′+β
γζ′+δ is a root of Q.
A simple calculation shows that if A ∈SL2(Z), then
αω′ + β
γω′ + β = ω
and
αη′ + β
γη′ + δ = η,
while if A /∈SL2(Z), then ω′, η′ correspond respectively to η, ω.
If A ∈SL2(Z) is in the automorph of the primitive form Q =
⟨a, b, c⟩, then from TA(Q) = Q it follows that ω = αω+β
γω+δ , hence
γω2 + (δ −α)ω −β = 0.
But also
aω2 + bω + c = 0,
and since gcd(a, b, c) = 1, there exists an integer u ̸= 0 such that
γ = au, δ −α = bu, −β = cu. Let t = δ + α; then t ≡bu (mod 2),

132
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
α = t−bu
2 , δ = t+bu
2 . From αδ−βγ = 1, it follows that t2−b2u2
4
+acu2 =
1, and ﬁnally t2 −Du2 = 4.
This calculation points out to a description of the automorph of
Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩:
A is in the automorph of Q if and only if there exist integers t, u
such that


t2 −Du2 = 4
α = t−bu
2
β = −cu
γ = au
δ = t+bu
2 .
Thus, the automorph of Q is in one-to-one correspondence with
the solutions in integers of the equation
T 2 −DU2 = 4.
If D < 0, this equation has only the solutions
(t, u) =


if D ̸= −4, −3,
(±2, 0), (±1, ±1)
if D = −3,
(±2, 0), (0, ±1)
if D = −4.
Thus, if D < 0, then the number of elements in the automorph
of Q is

if D ̸= −3, −4,
6
if D = −3,
4
if D = −4.
If D > 0, Lagrange proved what Fermat already knew: there
are inﬁnitely many pairs (t, u) of integers such that t2 −Du2 = 4.
If (t1, u1) is such that t1, u1 > 0 and t1 + u1

D is minimal, then all
the solutions (t, u) are given by the relations

for n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .
Thus, if D > 0, then the automorph of Q is inﬁnite.
Lagrange has also indicated an algorithm, involving continued
fractions, to determine t1, u1; this is, of course, well-known.

10 The automorph of a primitive form
133
Numerical example
To determine all the primitive representations of m = 17 by the form
Q = ⟨2, 6, 5⟩with discriminant −4.
First, note that −4 is a square modulo 68 because −1 is a square
modulo 17. The integers n = 4, 13 are the only solutions of −1 ≡
n2 (mod 17), 1 ≤n < 17, so 8, 26 are the only integers n such that
−4 ≡n2 (mod 68), 1 ≤n < 34.
To know whether there is a primitive representation of 17 by Q,
belonging to 8, it must be veriﬁed that Q ≈⟨17, 8, 1⟩. But h(−4) = 1,
so necessarily Q, ⟨17, 8, 1⟩are equivalent to the only reduced form
⟨1, 0, 1⟩of discriminant −4. The reduction is performed as follows:

This gives the four representations:

where A′ =

this gives the four representations:

The classical case, which concerns the form Q = ⟨1, 0, 1⟩, was
studied by Fermat and is treated in elementary books with a direct
approach. But the results of Fermat may also be obtained as a
special case of Gauss’ theory:
An integer m ≥1 has a primitive representation as the sum of
two squares if and only if m = m1m2
2, where gcd(m1, m2) = 1 and
the primes dividing m1 are either 2 or primes p ≡1 (mod 4). In this
situation, the number of primitive representations of m as a sum of
two squares is equal to
ρ(m) = 4(d1(m) −d3(m)),
where
d1(m) = #{d > 0 | d ≡1 (mod 4), d | m},
d3(m) = #{d > 0 | d ≡3 (mod 4), d | m}.
To arrive at this conclusion, the main points to observe are the
following:
m is a sum of two squares if and only if m is representable by a
form of discriminant −4, because h+(−4) = 1. This happens if and
only if −4 ≡n2 (mod 4m), for some n; equivalently, −1 is a square
modulo m. An easy computation with the Jacobi symbol leads to
the condition stated for m.

11 Composition of proper equivalence classes of primitive forms
135
Each n, 1 ≤n < 2m, such that −4 ≡n2 (mod 4m) corresponds
to ω = 4 primitive representations of m as the sum of two squares.
From the theory of congruences, the number of solutions n as above
is 
k|m

k

= d1(m) −d3(m). Hence, the number of primitive
representations is indeed 4(d1(m) −d3(m)).
11
Composition of proper equivalence classes of
primitive forms
One of the very important and deepest contributions of Gauss in
the study of binary quadratic forms is the theory of composition.
The idea had been already sketched by Legendre, in a particular
case.
Let D be any discriminant. Gauss deﬁned a binary operation in
the set Cl+(Prim(QD)) of proper equivalence classes of primitive
forms with discriminant D. As it turns out, this operation, called
composition, satisﬁes nice properties.
The theory is presented here in a simpliﬁed form due to
Dirichlet.
Let Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩, Q′ = ⟨a′, b′, c′⟩be primitive forms with dis-
criminant D. The new form Q′′ = ⟨a′′, b′′, c′′⟩shall be deﬁned as
follows.
Let δ = gcd

a, a′, b+b′
2

and let u, v, w be any integers such that
au + a′v + b + b′
2
w = δ.
Note that there are inﬁnitely many possible choices for u, v, w.

Then, Q′′ = ⟨a′′, b′′, c′′⟩is also a primitive form with discrimi-
nant D, which depends on the choice of u, v, w—this is stressed by
denoting Q′′ = Q′′
(u,v,w). It may be shown that if u1, v1, w1 are also
integers satisfying au1 + av1 + b+b′
2 w1 = δ, then the form Q′′
(u1,v1,w1),
although diﬀerent from Q′′
(u,v,w), is nevertheless properly equivalent
to Q′′
(u,v,w).

136
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
Thus, to the pair of primitive forms Q, Q′, it may be assigned
the proper equivalence class Q′′
(u,v,w) of Q′′
u,v,w). It is also true that
if Q ≈Q1 and Q′ ≈Q′
1, if Q′′, Q′′
1 are deﬁned as indicated above
from Q, Q′, respectively, Q1, Q′
1, then Q′′ ≈Q′′
1. This allows us to
deﬁne an operation of composition of proper equivalence classes of
primitive forms of discriminant D:
Q ∗Q′ = Q′′,
where Q′′ was deﬁned (with any u, v, w) as indicated above.
Gauss showed that if Q, Q′, Q′′ ∈Prim(QD) and if Q ∗Q′ = Q′′,
then for any integers x, y, x′, y′, there exist integers x′′, y′′ which are
linear combinations with coeﬃcients in Z of xx′, xy′, yx′, yy′, such
that Q′′(x′′, y′′) = Q(x, y)Q′(x′, y′).
The proof of this important property of the composition is rather
sophisticated, and I shall sketch it now.
First, it may be shown that given any two classes Q, Q′ of primitive
forms, it is possible to choose primitive forms Q1 ≈Q, Q′
1 ≈Q′ such
that
Q1 = ⟨a, b, a′c⟩
Q′
1 = ⟨a′, b, ac⟩
with a, a′ ≥1, gcd(a, a′) = 1.
Let u, v be such that au + a′v = 1, let w = 0 and consider the
primitive form Q′′
1, obtained from Q1, Q′
1 and (u, v, 0) as already
indicated in the deﬁnition of composition. A simple calculation gives
Q′′
1 = ⟨aa′, b, c⟩, and Q′′
1 = Q1 ∗Q1 = Q ∗Q′.
Then, it may be shown that Q1(x, y) · Q′
1(x′, y′) = Q′′
1(x′′, y′′),
where



x′′ = xx′ −cyy′,
y′′ = axy′ + a′yx′ + byy′.
This suﬃces to prove the statement.
The composition of proper equivalence classes of primitive forms
satisﬁes the associative, and commutative laws. The proper equiv-
alence class P of the principal form P is such that Q ∗P = Q for
every class Q. The class P is called the principal class. Finally, for
every class Q, there exists a class Q′, necessarily unique, such that
Q ∗Q′ = P; the class Q′ is the inverse of Q under composition.

12 The theory of genera
137
Thus, Cl+(Prim(QD)) is a ﬁnite abelian group under the operation
of composition—a fact which was discovered by Gauss, although
obviously not phrased in this language.
The inverse of the class ⟨a, b, c⟩is ⟨a, −b, c⟩; it is the class of the
associated forms.
A class equal to its inverse is called an ambiguous class. These
are exactly the elements of order 1 or 2 in the group of classes of
primitive forms, with operation of composition. It is easy to see that
if ⟨a, b, c⟩is such that a divides b, then ⟨a, b, c⟩≈⟨a, −b, c⟩, hence
the class ⟨a, b, c⟩is ambiguous.
Numerical example
If D = −20 and P = ⟨1, 0, 5⟩, Q = ⟨2, 2, 3⟩, then Q ∗Q = P, as it is
easy to verify.
The structure theorem for ﬁnite abelian groups tells us that the
group under composition Cl+(Prim(QD)) is the direct product, in a
unique way (up to isomorphism), of primary cyclic groups.
The structure of Cl+(Prim(QD)) will be discussed in §13.

The theory of genera
The theory of genera was created to try to characterize in a simple
manner those primes that may be represented by a given form with
a fundamental discriminant.
Explicitly, let D be a discriminant, let p be a prime not divid-
ing 2D, and assume that p may be represented by some primitive
form of discriminant D; in other words, D is a square modulo 4p,
so

D
p

= +1. The problem is to decide which primitive forms of
discriminant D represent p, just by computing the values at p of
certain quadratic characters associated to D.
As it will be seen, the theory of genera does not quite succeed to
attain its aim.
As was said in §3, if D = −4 and Q = X2 + Y 2, the prime p is a
sum of two squares if and only if p = 2 or p ≡1 (mod 4). Similarly,
if D = −12, Q = X2 + 3Y 2, then p is represented by Q if and only
if p = 3 or p ≡1 (mod 3).
However, as already indicated, if D = −20, the class number
h+(−20) = 2 and there are two reduced forms of discriminant −20

138
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
which are not properly equivalent, namely
Q1 = X2 + 5Y 2
and
Q2 = 2X2 + 2XY + 3Y 2.
Now:
p = 5 is represented by Q1;
if p ≡11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20), that is

−5
p

= −1, then p is neither
represented by Q1, nor by Q2;
if p ≡1, 3, 7, 9 (mod 20), that is

−5
p

= +1, then p is represented
by Q1 or by Q2.
The question that remains is to decide, for a given prime p of the
last type, which one of Q1 or Q2 represents it.
The same problem arises also for any discriminant D such that
h+(D) > 1, and the theory of genera is a serious attempt to solve it.
Let D be any discriminant (not necessarily fundamental). Let q1,
. . . , qr, (r ≥0), be the distinct odd primes dividing the square-free
kernel of D. The numbering is such that q1 ≡· · · ≡qs ≡1 (mod 4)
and qs+1 ≡· · · ≡qr ≡−1 (mod 4), with 0 ≤s ≤r.
For every m such that qi does not divide m, let χi(m) =

m
qi

(i = 1, . . . , r), so χi is a character modulo qi.
For every odd integer m, let
δ(m) = (−1)(m−1)/2
and
η(m) = (−1)(m2−1)/8.
Again, δ is a character modulo 4 and η is a character modulo 8.
To each type of discriminant, there will be assigned a set of
characters, according to the following rule:
Discriminant
Assigned characters
(#, #′)
D ≡1 (mod 4)
χ1, . . . , χr
(r, r)
D = 4D′, D′ ≡1 (mod 4)
χ1, . . . , χr
(r, r + 1)
D = 4D′, D′ ≡3 (mod 4)
χ1, . . . , χr, δ
(r + 1, r + 1)
D = 4D′, D′ ≡2 (mod 8)
χ1, . . . , χr, η
(r + 1, r + 1)
D = 4D′, D′ ≡6 (mod 8)
χ1, . . . , χr, δη
(r + 1, r + 1)
D = 4D′, D′ = 4E2q1 · · · qr
χ1, . . . , χs, χs+1δ, . . . , χrδ
(r, r + 1)
D = 4D′, D′ = 8E2q1 · · · qr
χ1, . . . , χs, χs+1δ, . . . , χrδ, η
(r + 1, r + 1)
(#, #′) = (number of assigned characters, number of primes dividing D)
It is convenient to denote in each case by Θ the set of all assigned
characters, and by t their number.

139
By the quadratic reciprocity law, if gcd(m, 2D) = 1, then

θ∈Θ
θ(m) =
D
m

.
The following facts may be proved. If gcd(m, 2D) = 1 and m is
any value of Q ∈Prim(QD), then

D
m

= 1. If gcd(m′, 2D) = 1 and
m′ is any other value of Q, then θ(m) = θ(m′) for every assigned
character θ.
This allows us to deﬁne θ(Q) = θ(m) for every integer m repre-
sented by Q and such that gcd(m, 2D) = 1, and for every assigned
character θ.
It follows at once that if Q ≈Q′, then θ(Q) = θ(Q′) for every
assigned character θ, and so it is possible to deﬁne for every proper
equivalence class: θ(Q) = θ(Q), for every assigned character θ.
Let {+1, −1}t be the multiplicative group of t-tuples of integers +1
or −1, and deﬁne the map
Ξ : Cl+(Prim(QD)) −→{+1, −1}t
by
Ξ(Q) = (θ(Q))θ∈Θ.
It is easy to show that the map Ξ is a homomorphism of the group
Cl+(Prim(QD)), under composition, to {+1, −1}t.
Note that 
θ∈Θ θ(Q) = 1.
It may be shown that the image of Ξ is the set of all σ =
(σ1, . . . , σt) with each σi ∈{+1, −1}, such that t
i=1 σi = 1. Hence,
the image has 2t−1 elements.
For every σ in the image of Ξ, the inverse image of σ,
Ξ−1(σ) = {Q | Ξ(Q) = σ},
is called the genus of Cl+(Prim(QD)) with generic character σ.
The genus with generic character σ1 = {+1, . . . , +1} is called the
principal genus and it is a subgroup of Cl+(Prim(QD)). Each genus
is a coset of the principal genus.
The following notation will sometimes be adopted: [Q] is the genus
of the class Q.
The number of genera is g(D) = 2t−1 and the number of classes
in each genus is f(D) = h+(D)
2t−1 ; in particular, 2t−1 divides h+(D).

140
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
Note that if D is a fundamental discriminant, then t is equal to
the number of distinct prime divisors of D (including 2, if D is even).
Gauss proved the following important theorem, called the
squaring or duplication theorem:
The principal genus consists of the squares (under composition) of
the proper equivalence classes of primitive forms.
From the above considerations, one obtains the following criterion.
Let p be a prime, not dividing 2D, and let G be a genus of proper
equivalence classes of primitive forms of discriminant D, say
G = {Q1, . . . , Qk}.
Then p is represented by some form Q belonging to one of the
classes Qi ∈G(1 ≤i ≤k) if and only if (θ(p))θ∈Θ = Ξ(Qi).
Note that if the genus has more than one proper equivalence class,
the above criterion does not tell which form represents p, among
those whose proper equivalence class is in the genus.
Returning to the previous example of discriminant D = −20, with
the two classes Q1 = ⟨1, 0, 5⟩(the principal class) and Q2 = ⟨2, 2, 3⟩;
note that it has g(−20) = 2 genera, so Q1, Q2 are in diﬀerent genera.
If p is an odd prime p ̸= 5, then p is represented by Q1 if and only if
* p
5
+ = 1 and (−1)(p−1)/2 = 1, so p ≡1 (mod 4) and p ≡±1 (mod 5),
or equivalently, p ≡1 or 9 (mod 20).
Similarly, p is represented by Q2 if and only if
(−1)(p−1)/2 = χ1(Q2) = χ1(3) = (−1)(3−1)/2 = −1,
and
p
5

= χ2(p) = χ2(Q2) = χ2(2) =
2
5

= −1.
Thus p ≡3 (mod 4) and p ≡±2 (mod 5), or equivalently, p ≡
3, 7 (mod 20).
Note that the theory of genera establishes the conjecture of Euler
concerning the form X2 + 5Y 2.
The treatment with the theory of genera is not so conclusive when
there is more than one form in each genus.
Numerical example
Let D = −56 = −8 × 7.
The number of genera is 2.

12 The theory of genera
141
The reduced forms are P = ⟨1, 0, 14⟩, Q1 = ⟨3, 2, 5⟩, Q2 = ⟨2, 0, 7⟩,
Q3 = ⟨3, −2, 5⟩.
A simple calculation shows that Cl+(Prim(Q−56)) is a cyclic
group, with Q2
1 = Q2, Q3
1 = Q3, Q4
1 = P.
The principal genus is {P, Q2} and the non-principal genus is
{Q1, Q3}; it has generic character {−1, −1}. From this, it follows
that a prime p ̸= 2, 7 is represented by P or Q2 if and only if
χ1(p) = (−1)(P 2−1)/2 = 1, that is

2
p

= 1 and
* p
7
+ = 1; a simple cal-
culation gives p ≡1, 9, 15, 23, 25, or 39 (mod 56). But, it cannot be
obtained a condition stating that p is represented by P (respectively,
by Q2).
In the same way, if p ̸= 2, 7, then p is represented by Q1 or by Q3
if and only if p ≡3, 5, 13, 19, 27, 45 (mod 56).
As will be explained below, the work of Euler on the “nu-
meri idonei” (also called “convenient numbers”) and the work of
Gauss generated interest in fundamental discriminants D < 0 whose
principal genus consists only of the principal class.
Here is a list of the 65 known fundamental discriminants D < 0,
such that the principal genus consists only of the principal class:

Up to now, no other such fundamental discriminant is known!
(See §18 for a further discussion on this point.)
There are also the following 36 known non-fundamental dis-
criminants with principal genus consisting only of the principal
class:
−D = 3 × 22, 3 × 32, 3 × 42, 3 × 52, 3 × 72, 3 × 82, 4 × 22, 4 × 32,
4 × 42, 4 × 52, 7 × 22, 7 × 42, 7 × 82, 8 × 22, 8 × 32, 8 × 62,
11 × 32, 15 × 22, 15 × 42, 15 × 82, 20 × 32, 24 × 22, 35 × 32,
40 × 22, 88 × 22, 120 × 22, 168 × 22, 232 × 22,
280 × 22, 312 × 22, 408 × 22, 520 × 22, 760 × 22,

142
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
840 × 22, 1320 × 22, 1848 × 22.
From the theory of genera, for each of the above discriminants, it
is possible to decide with the method indicated if an odd prime may
or may not be represented by any one of the primitive forms of this
discriminant.
There is an interesting connection, discovered by Gauss, between
negative discriminants with one class in each genus, and Euler’s
convenient numbers, which were deﬁned in order to ﬁnd large primes.
The deﬁnition of convenient numbers involves odd integers m ≥1
satisfying the following properties:
(i) if x, y, x′, y′ are non-negative integers such that x2 + ny2 =
x′2 + n(y′)2, then (x′, y′) = (x, y) or (y, x);
(ii) if x, y are non-negative integers such that m = x2 + ny2, then
gcd(x, y) = 1.
The integer n ≥1 is a convenient number when it satisﬁes the
following property: every odd integer m ≥1 relatively prime to n
which satisﬁes the above conditions (i) and (ii), is a prime.
Gauss showed:
Let n ≥1 be an integer. Then the principal genus of the funda-
mental discriminant D = −4n consists of only one class if and only
if n is a convenient number.
Thus, the 65 known convenient numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 33, 37, 40, 42, 45, 48,
57, 58, 60, 70, 72, 78, 85, 88, 93, 102, 105, 112, 120, 130, 133, 165,
168, 177, 190, 210, 232, 240, 253, 273, 280, 312, 330, 345, 357, 385,
408, 462, 520, 760, 840, 1320, 1365, 1848.
More information about convenient numbers may be found in Frei
(1985, 1984); Steinig (1966).
There are other ways to indicate that two forms are in the
same genus. To be able to express these conditions, the notion of
equivalence is extended as follows.
Let R be any of the following rings:
(1) R = Z(n) (the ring of rational numbers, with denominators
prime to n);
(2) R = Zp (the ring of p-adic integers, with p prime);
(3) R = Z/mZ (the ring of residue classes modulo m ≥2).
In each case, let λ : Z →R be the natural ring homomorphism;
so in cases (1), (2), λ is the embedding, and in case (3), λ is the
residue map. If Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩let λQ = ⟨λ(a), λ(b), λ(c)⟩= λ(a)X2 +

13 The group of proper equivalence classes of primitive forms
143
λ(b)XY + λ(c)Y 2 be the associated binary quadratic form over the
ring R. Thus, in cases (1), (2), Q and λQ may be identiﬁed.
The forms Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩, Q′ = ⟨a′, b′, c′⟩are said to be R-equivalent
if there exits A =
 α β
γ δ

∈GL2(R) such that λQ′ = TA(λQ). In
cases (1), (2), this means (after the canonical embedding) that the
conditions (∗) of §6 are satisﬁed. In case (3), those equalities become
congruences modulo m. The notation is Q ∼Q′ (over R).
Similarly, ρ ∈R is said to be a value of Q if there exist α, γ ∈R
such that (λQ)(α, γ) = ρ. For example, r mod m ∈Z/mZ is a value
of Q if there exist integers x, y such that Q(x, y) ≡r (mod m).
Each of the following equivalent conditions characterizes when two
forms Q, Q′ ∈QD are in the same genus:
(i) Q, Q′ have the same set of values in each ring Z/mZ, for all
m ≥2;
(ii) Q ∼Q′ (over Z/mZ) for all m ≥2;
(iii) Q ∼Q′ (over Zp) for all primes p;
(iv) Q ∼Q′ (over Z(n)) for every n ≥2.
These results are the cornerstone of a local-global theory of
quadratic forms which shall not be developed here.
13
The structure of the group of proper
equivalence classes of primitive forms
Let D be any discriminant.
Recall that Cl+(Prim(QD)) is a ﬁnite abelian group. As such, it
is the direct product of its p-Sylow subgroups Sp, for every prime
p dividing h+(D). In turn, each non-trivial p-Sylow subgroup is the
direct product of k(p) ≥1 cyclic p-groups. The integer k(p), which is
uniquely deﬁned, is called the p-rank of the group Cl+(Prim(QD)).
First, consider the prime p = 2. The 2-Sylow subgroup S2 contains
the subgroup A of ambiguous classes (the classes of order dividing 2).
Gauss showed that the order of A is equal to the number g(D) =
2t−1 of genera (t denotes the number of assigned characters of D,
which is the same as the number of primes dividing D, when D is a
fundamental discriminant). A detailed and clear presentation of this
proof can be found, for example, in the book of Flath (1989).
The only ambiguous class is the principal class if and only if D = p
or 4p, where p is an odd prime, p ≡1 (mod 4).

144
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
It is easy to see that if a non-principal genus contains an ambiguous
class Q, there is a bijection between the set A ∩[P] of ambiguous
classes in the principal genus and the set A ∩[Q].
Concerning the principal genus [P], it may or may not be cyclic.
If it is cyclic of even order, then A ∩[P] has only two classes, and so
every genus either has no ambiguous class, or exactly two ambiguous
classes—this happens for exactly one-half of the genera. If, however,
P is the only ambiguous class in A∩[P], then each genus has exactly
one ambiguous class.
If the principal genus is not cyclic, let e(D) be the maximum of
the orders of its classes; so e(D) < f(D) (the order of the principal
genus) and, in fact, e(D) divides f(D).
Gauss called D a regular discriminant when the principal genus
is cyclic; otherwise, D is called irregular and f(D)/e(D) is its
irregularity index.
For example, if the principal genus contains 3 or more ambiguous
classes, then D is irregular and the irregularity index is even. If the
number of ambiguous classes in the principal genus is 1 or 2, then
f(D)/e(D) is odd (but not necessarily equal to 1)
In article 306 of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Gauss indicated in-
ﬁnitely many negative discriminants with irregularity index multiple
of 3, namely,
D = −(216k + 27),
with k ≥1,
D = −(1000k + 75),
with k ≥1,
etc. . . .
He also gave the following examples:
−D = 576, 580, 820, 884, 900, with irregularity index 2,
−D = 243, 307, 339, 459, 675, 755, 891, 974, with irregularity index 3.
Gauss gave just one example of an irregular positive discriminant:
D = 3026; it has irregularity index 2.
Now, let p be an odd prime. Nothing was said by Gauss concerning
the p-rank of the group of classes. I shall return to this matter in §20.

14 Calculations and conjectures
145
14
Calculations and conjectures
Gauss made many calculations concerning the forms ⟨a, 2b, c⟩, to
which he had restricted his attention. But his results may be easily
reinterpreted for arbitrary forms.
For −3000 < D < 0, and D a fundamental discriminant, he
obtained:
h+(D) = 1 if and only if −D = 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163 (these
are 9 values);
h+(D) = 2 if and only if −D assumes 18 values, of which the
largest is 427;
h+(D) = 3 if and only if −D assumes 16 values, of which the
largest is 907; etc. . . .
Based on these calculations, Gauss conjectured (see Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae, article 303):
Conjecture 1. There exist only 9 fundamental discriminants D < 0,
such that h+(D) = 1.
Conjecture 2. For every n ≥2, there exist only ﬁnitely many fun-
damental discriminants D < 0, such that h+(D) = n. In particular,
for n = 2 only 18 values, for n = 3 only 16 values, etc. . . .
More speciﬁcally, the conjecture will be established if an algorithm
is devised to ﬁnd all discriminants D < 0 such that h+(D) = n.
Concerning proper equivalence classes of indeﬁnite forms with fun-
damental discriminant D > 0, the following is the ongoing belief (see
also Gauss, loc. cit., article 304):
Conjecture 3. There exist inﬁnitely many fundamental discrimi-
nants D > 0 such that h+(D) = 1.
With respect to the number of classes in the principal genus,
Gauss has conjectured (article 303):
Conjecture 4. For each integer m ≥1 there exist only ﬁnitely many
discriminants D < 0 such that the number of classes in the principal
genus of D is equal to m.
This may also be expressed as follows:
lim
|D|→∞f(D) = ∞

146
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
(f(D) is the number of classes in the principal genus of D).
Gauss noted by numerical computation that the number of pos-
itive discriminants D for which f(D) = 1 becomes increasingly rare
as D increases. He ventures that there are inﬁnitely many such
discriminants, and poses the problem to study the behavior of
{#{D | 1 ≤D ≤N, f(D) = 1}
N
as N →∞.
It will be seen that Conjectures 1, 2, and 4 have now been
established, and only Conjecture 3 remains open.
15
The aftermath of Gauss (or the “math” after
Gauss)
The rich theory developed by Gauss, and published in Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae when he was only 24 years old, has had a lasting im-
pact. Its presentation required the whole section V of the book, over
250 pages long. Gauss’ text is full of numerical examples and algo-
rithms, clarifying and completing the results previously obtained by
Fermat, Euler, Legendre, and especially by Lagrange. Here I
have touched on only a few aspects of his study.
The period following the publication of Gauss’ theory saw the
analytical work of Dirichlet on the computation of the number of
proper equivalence classes of primitive forms of a given discriminant,
and later, the geometric theory of forms as developed by Klein.
It also saw the far-reaching interpretation of Dedekind. In or-
der to provide a transparent explanation for the composition of
proper equivalence classes of primitive forms. Dedekind estab-
lished a connection between forms and ideals in quadratic number
ﬁelds; see Dedekind’s supplements to Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen
¨uber Zahlentheorie.
16
Forms versus ideals in quadratic ﬁelds
To explain the correspondence between forms and ideals in quadratic
number ﬁelds, I begin by brieﬂy recalling some facts.

16 Forms versus ideals in quadratic ﬁelds
147
Let d ̸= 0, 1 be a square-free integer and let K = Q(
√
d) be the
associated quadratic ﬁeld consisting of the elements α = x + y
√
d,
where x, y ∈Q.
The discriminant of K is deﬁned to be
DK =



d
if d ≡1 (mod 4),
4d
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
So, DK is a fundamental discriminant.
This deﬁnes bijections between the set of square-free integers,
d ̸= 0, 1, the set of quadratic ﬁelds, and the set of fundamental
discriminants.
Let
ω =



1+
√
d
2
if d ≡1 (mod 4),
√
d
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
Then {1, ω} is also a basis of the Q-vector space K, so every
element α of K may be written in unique way as α = x + yω, with
x, y ∈Q.
The conjugate of α = x + y
√
d (x, y ∈Q) is ¯α = x −y
√
d, and the
norm of α is N(α) = α¯α = x2 −y2d ∈Q. In particular,
¯ω =



1−
√
d
2
if d ≡1 (mod 4),
−
√
d
if ≡2 or 3 (mod 4),
and
N(ω) =



1−d
4
if d ≡1 (mod 4),
−d
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
If α ∈K is written in terms of the basis {1, ω}, then
N(x + yω) =



x2 + xy + 1−d
4 y2
if d ≡1 (mod 4),
x2 −y2d
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4).
The element α ∈K is said to be an algebraic integer if it is the
root of a quadratic monic polynomial X2 −aX + b ∈Z[X]. In this
situation a = α + ¯α, and N(α) = α¯α = b ∈Z.
The set of algebraic integers of K is a subring of K which will be
denoted by OK. Clearly, Z ⊂OK, K is the ﬁeld of quotients of OK,
and OK = Z ⊕Zω, so OK is a free Z-module of rank 2.

148
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
The correspondence indicated above for fundamental discrimi-
nants may be extended to all possible discriminants D ≡0 or
1 (mod 4); they will correspond bijectively to orders in quadratic
ﬁelds, which I shall now introduce.
An order of K is a subring O of K which is a free Z-module of
rank 2. Thus Z ⊂O, K is the ﬁeld of quotients of O, and there
exist two elements α, β ∈O such that every γ ∈O may be written
uniquely in the form γ = xα + yβ, with x, y ∈Z. This is written as
O = Zα ⊕Zβ.
In particular, the ring of algebraic integers OK is an order of K.
The discriminant of any free Z-module Zα ⊕Zβ is, by deﬁnition,
equal to
det
	
α
β
¯α
¯β

2
.
It is independent of the choice of the basis.
The discriminant of an order O is denoted by Discr(O) and is an
integer congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. In particular, the discriminant
of the order OK of all algebraic integers of K is Discr(OK) = DK.
The discriminant establishes a map from the set of orders of quad-
ratic ﬁelds to the set of integers congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 (which
are not squares). Conversely, if D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4) (D not a square),
let D = f2D0, where f ≥1 and D0 is a fundamental discriminant.
Let K be the quadratic ﬁeld with discriminant DK = D0. Then
O(D) = Z ⊕ZD+
√
D

is an order of K with Discr(O(D)) = D; f is
called the conductor of the order O(D). Thus, OK = O(DK).
Note that
O(D) =

x + y
√
D

| x, y ∈Z,
x ≡yD (mod 2)

.
This establishes a bijection between the set of orders of quadratic
ﬁelds and the set of integers (not a square) congruent to 0 or 1
modulo 4.
Moreover, if D = f2D0, D′ = e2D0 and e divides f with e < f,
then O(D) ⊂O(D′). In particular, OK is the only maximal order in
the ﬁeld K with discriminant DK = D0.
For every D = f2DK, the additive quotient group OK/O(D) is
ﬁnite, having f elements.
A fractional ideal I of the order O = O(D) is an additive subgroup
of K such that

16 Forms versus ideals in quadratic ﬁelds

(1) αI ⊆I for every α ∈O,
(2) there exists a non-zero element δ ∈O such that δI ⊆O.
Each non-zero fractional ideal I of O admits a basis consisting of
two numbers α, β ∈I, that is, I = Zα ⊕Zβ.
For every α ∈K, the set Oα = {βα | β ∈O} is a fractional ideal
of the order O, called the principal ideal deﬁned by α. In particular,
O = O1 is the unit ideal, 0 = O0 is the zero ideal.
If I is a fractional ideal of O, then so is its conjugate ¯I = {¯α |
α ∈I}. If I, J are fractional ideals of O let I · J = {n
i=1 αiβi |
αi ∈I, βi ∈I, n ≥1}. Then I · J is also a fractional ideal of O. The
multiplication of fractional ideals is an associative and commutative
operation, withthe unit ideal as the unit element. Also Oα · Oβ =
Oαβ for any α, β ∈K.
The product I · ¯I is a principal fractional ideal of Z, generated by
a unique positive rational number l > 0: I · ¯I = Ol; by deﬁnition,
the norm of I is N(I) = l. It is clear that N(I · J) = N(I)N(J) and
N(Oα) = |N(α)|.
If {α, β} is any basis of I, then (α¯β −¯αβ)2 = N(I)2D.
A fractional ideal I of O = O(D) is said to be invertible if there
exists a fractional ideal J such that I · J = O.
The following conditions on a non-zero fractional ideal I of O are
equivalent:
(1) I is invertible.
(2) O = {α ∈K | αI ⊆I}.
If gcd(N(I), f) = 1, then I is invertible.
In particular, if f = 1, then all the non-zero fractional ideals of
O(DK) are invertible.
If I, J are invertible fractional ideals of O and I ⊆J, then there
exists a fractional ideal J′ ⊆O such that I = JJ′ and hence N(J)
divides N(I). In particular, for every α ∈K, α ̸= 0, if α ∈J, then
N(J) divides N(α).
Let I = I(O(D)) denote the set of all invertible fractional ide-
als of O(D); thus I is a multiplicative group which contains the
subgroups
P = P(O(D)) = {Oα | α ∈K, α ̸= 0}
and
P+ = P+(O(D)) = {Oα | α ∈K, α ̸= 0, N(α) > 0}.

6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
The equivalence of invertible ideals I, J ∈I is deﬁned as follows:
I ∼J if there exists α ∈K, α ̸= 0, such that I = J · Oα. The set of
equivalence classes of invertible ideals of O is denoted by Cl(O(D)),
and the equivalence class of I is denoted by cl(I). If I ∼I′ and
J ∼J′, then I · J ∼I′ · J′. This allows us to deﬁne the operation
cl(I) · cl(J) = cl(I · J).
Endowed with this operation, Cl(O(D)) is an abelian group
isomorphic to the quotient group I/P.
The strict equivalence invertible ideals I, J ∈I is deﬁned as
follows: I ≈J if there exists α ∈K, with N(α) > 0, such that
I = J · Oα. The set of strict equivalence classes of invertible ideals
of O is denoted by Cl+(O(D)) and the strict equivalence class of I
is denoted by cl+(I). Again, if I ≈I′, J ≈J′, then I · J ≈I′ · J′,
which allows us to deﬁne the operation cl+(I) · cl+(J) = cl+(I · J).
With this operation, Cl+(O(D)) is an abelian group, isomorphic to
T /P+.
The mapping cl+(I) →cl(I) from Cl+(O) to Cl(O) is a surjective
homomorphism, with a kernel consisting of one or two elements.
Whereas T (O(D)) is an inﬁnite group, the group Cl+(O(D)) is
ﬁnite, hence also Cl(O(D)) is ﬁnite. This important result is the
counterpart, in Dedekind’s interpretation, of the ﬁniteness of the
group Cl+(Prim(D)), as I shall soon explain.
The number of elements in Cl(O(D)) is denoted h(O(D)) and
called the class number of the order O(D). The number of elements
of Cl+(O(D)) is called the strict class number of O(D) and denoted
by h+(O(D)).
From the above homomorphism, h((O(D)) ≤h+((O(D)) ≤
2h((O(D)). The exact relation between the class number and strict
class number of an order will be made more precise.
The following facts about orders will also be needed later.
An element α ∈O = O(D) such that α−1 ∈O is called a unit
of O. If α ∈O and there exists k ≥1 such that αk = 1, then α
is a root of unity and also a unit. The set U = U(O(D)) of units
of O forms a multiplicative group. If α is a unit, then so is ¯α and
N(α¯α) = ±1.
Consider the situation in the case of the maximal order O(DK).

If d < 0, the group of units of O(DK) is ﬁnite, so every unit is a
root of unity. Let w denote the number of units. Then

if d ̸= −1, −3;
the units are ±1.
If DK > 0, there exists a unit ϵ > 1, unique such that
U = {±ϵk | k ∈Z}.
The unit ϵ is called the fundamental unit of O(DK). The only roots
of unity are ±1.
Since U(O(D)) = U(O(DK))∩O(D), if DK < 0, then U(O(D)) is
ﬁnite, consisting only of roots of units. If DK > 0, then there exists a
smallest t ≥1 such that ϵt ∈O(D) and U(O(D)) = {±ϵtk | k ≥1};
ϵt is the fundamental unit of O(D).
The fundamental unit may have norm equal to 1 or to −1, both
cases being possible.
If DK ≡1 (mod 4), then DK = d is square-free; the fundamental
unit ϵ = x1+y1
√
d
2
(with x1, y1 ≥1, x1 ≡y1 (mod 2)) is such that
x2
1 −y2
1d = ±4; moreover, for every pair (x, y), x, y ≥1, such that
x2 −y2d = ±4, necessarily x1 + x + y1
√
d < x + y
√
d.
If DK ≡0 (mod 4), then DK = 4d, with d ≡2, 3 (mod 4); the
fundamental unit ϵ = x1 + y1
√
d (with x1, y1 ≥1) is such that
x2
1−y2
1d = ±1 and x1+y1
√
d < x+y
√
d whenever x,y ≥1, x2−y2d =
±1.
This theory was developed by Lagrange.
The relationship between the class number and the strict class
number of the order O(D) is the following:
(1) If D < 0 or D > 0 and the fundamental unit of O(D) has
norm −1, then h+(O(D)) = h(O(D)).
(2) If D > 0 and the fundamental unit has norm 1, then
h+(O(D)) = 2h(O(D)).
Now I shall indicate the important correspondence between proper
equivalence classes of primitive forms and strict equivalence classes
of invertible fractional ideals of orders.
Let D ≡0, 1 (mod 4) (D not a square), so D = f2D0, where D0 is
a fundamental discriminant. Let K = Q(√D0), so its discriminant
is DK = D0. Let O = O(D) and let I ∈I(O), so I is a non-zero

invertible fractional ideal of the order O. Thus I has a basis {α, β},
and therefore
det
	
α

¯β

= α¯β −¯αβ ̸= 0.
Since α¯β−¯αβ
√
d
is equal to its conjugate, then it is a rational number.
Therefore, either α¯β −¯αβ > 0 or β ¯α −¯βα > 0. Thus, it is possible
to choose a pair (α, β) such that I = Zα ⊕Zβ and α¯β −¯αβ > 0;
(α, β) is called a positively oriented basis for I.
Since Oα ⊆I and Oβ ⊆I, it follows that N(I) divides N(α) and
N(β). But N(I)2 divides
(α¯β −¯αβ)2 = (α¯β + ¯αβ)2 −4N(α)N(β),
hence N(I) divides α¯β + ¯αβ.
Let
Q =
0
N(α)
N(I) , α¯β + ¯αβ

so Q has discriminant equal to D.
Note that Q depends on the choice of the positively oriented basis
{α, β}; this is denoted by writing Q = Q(α,β). If {α′, β′} is another
positively oriented basis of I, it may be shown that Q(α,β) and Q(α′,β′)
are properly equivalent. Similarly, if the ideals I, I′ ∈I are strictly
equivalent, then the associated forms Q, Q′ (using any positively
oriented bases of I, I′) are properly equivalent. This deﬁnes the map
cl+(I) →Q from Cl+(O(D)) to Cl+(Prim(QD)).
Conversely, let Q = ⟨a, b, c⟩be a primitive form with discrim-
inant D = f2D0, where D0 is a fundamental discriminant. Let
K = Q(√D0), so DK = D0.

It is easy to see that, in both cases, I is an invertible fractional

This deﬁnes a mapping Q →cl+(I) from Cl+(QD) to Cl+(O(D)).
The two mappings are inverse to each other, as may be veriﬁed.

17 Dirichlet’s class number formula
153
Moreover, if Q ∗Q′ = Q′′ (composition of proper equivalence
classes), then the corresponding strict classes of ideals satisfy cl+(I)·
cl+(I′) = cl+(I′′).
In other words, the group (under composition) Cl+(Prim(QD))
and the group Cl+(O(D)) are isomorphic.
In particular, it follows also that h+(D) = h+(O(D)).
Here it should be observed that there is no isomorphism in general
between Cl(Prim(QD)) and Cl(O(D)). For example, it was shown
that h(−303) = 6, h+(−303) = 10, so h(O(−303)) = h+(O(−303) =
10.

Dirichlet’s class number formula
Using analytical methods, in 1839 Dirichlet gave a formula for the
number of proper equivalence classes of primitive forms of a given
discriminant D.
First, I recall the deﬁnition and main properties of the Kronecker
symbol, which will be used in the sequel.
Let D ≡0 or 1 (mod 4), D not a square.
The Kronecker symbol is deﬁned as follows:
(1)

The computation of the Kronecker symbol is reduced to that
of Legendre symbols, and this may be speedily done using Gauss’
reciprocity law.
It is also necessary to use the well-known fact that, given m and D
(as above), the number of integers n, such that 1 ≤n < 2m and
D ≡n2 (mod 4m), is equal to

Let D > 0 and denote by ϵ the fundamental unit of the real quad-

If D > 0, deﬁne w = 1.
If D < 0, it is convenient to say that every primitive representation
is primary, and for D < 0, w has already been deﬁned, as being the
number of roots of unity of the quadratic ﬁeld Q(
√
D).
Then, for any Q ∈Prim(QD), the number of primitive primary
representations of m ≥1 by Q and belonging to n (where 1 ≤n <
2m, D ≡n2 (mod 4m)) is equal to 0 or to w.
Let Q ∈Prim(QD), m ≥1, and denote by ψ(m, Q) the number of
primitive primary representations of m by Q.
Let {Q1, . . . , Qh+(D)} be a set of h+(D) pairwise non-properly
equivalent primitive forms with discriminant D.
Let ψ(m) = h+(D)

It is interesting to note that in article 303 of Disquisitiones Arith-
meticae, Gauss stated that for D > 0, the product h(D) log ϵ has a
role similar to h+(D) when D < 0. This fact recurs later in the work
of Siegel (1936) and reﬂects the crucial importance of the L-series
of the character χ.

Solution of the class number problem for
deﬁnite forms
Even though the class number formula indeed allows the computa-
tion of h(D) (see Buell’s tables of h(D) (Buell (1976) and Buell
(1987)) for |D| < 25 × 106), no inference can be made concern-
ing the growth of h(D). Thus, the formula does not suﬃce to decide
whether the conjectures of Gauss (see §14) are true. These questions
are much more diﬃcult.
The two excellent articles of Goldfeld (1985) and Oesterl´e
(1988) should be read, as they contain a lucid account of the
work which culminated in the solution of the problem for proper
equivalence classes of positive deﬁnite forms with fundamental
discriminant, or equivalently, for imaginary quadratic ﬁelds.
I shall borrow unashamedly from these authoritative accounts—
after my sincere kudos, what else can the authors do but forgive
me?

158
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
Before considering the question in its full generality, it is worth
pointing out that a special case had been settled by Landau, already
in 1903:
If D is any fundamental discriminant such that 4 divides D, then
h(−D) = 1 if and only if −D = 4 or 8.
It is not diﬃcult to give upper estimates for L(D) = L(1|χ). If
D ≤−5, then L(D) ≤log |D|, hence
h(D) <
√
D log |D|
π
.
For the class number problem, what is important is the determi-
nation of lower bounds for h(D).
Consider the zeta function of the ﬁeld K = Q(
√
D):
ζK(s) =

1
N(I)s (summation over all non-zero ideals I of O),
where N(I) indicates the norm of the ideal I. This series converges
absolutely for Re(s) > 1.
If K = Q, then ζQ(s) is the Riemann zeta function
ζ(s) =

(for Re(s) > 1).
Classical calculations give
ζK(s) = ζ(s)L(s|χ)
(for Re(s) > 1),
where χ(n) =

D
n

for every n ≥1.
Riemann’s hypothesis states that all non-real zeroes σ + it of ζ(s)
are such that σ = 1/2.
In the present context, the generalized Riemann’s hypothesis is
the analogous statement for the L-series L(s|χ).
Everyone knows that both the Riemann and the generalized Rie-
mann hypothesis, however plausible they may be, have yet to be
proved. It is a common practice in analytic number theory to deduce
consequences from these hypotheses—as in the last century was the
case for non-euclidean geometry.
Hecke (see Landau (1913)) proved that under a hypothesis sim-
ilar to, but weaker than, the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the

159
L-series of the character χ, it follows that there is a constant c > 0
such that
h(D) ≥1
c ·
,
|D|
log |D|.
This implies that limD→−∞h(D) = ∞, and also if h(D) = 1, then
c ≥
,
|D|
log |D|,
and, therefore,
|D| ≤(c log |D|)2.
What has been proved, without assuming the generalized Rie-
mann’s hypothesis?
Deuring (1933) showed:
Assuming that the classical Riemann hypothesis is false, there
exist only ﬁnitely many discriminants D < 0 such that h(D) = 1.
Soon after, Mordell showed, assuming the classical Riemann
hypothesis to be false, that limD→−∞h(D) = ∞.
In the same year of 1934, assuming that the generalized Rie-
mann hypothesis is false, Heilbronn (1934a) concluded also that
limD→−∞h(D) = ∞.
As Goldfeld says: “Here was the ﬁrst known instance of a proof
which ﬁrst assumed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis was
true and then that it was false, giving the right answer in both cases!”
Siegel (1936) showed, in a diﬀerent way, that
log h(D) ∼log
.
|D|
(asymptotically, as D →−∞);
in particular, limD→−∞h(D) = ∞.
The above proofs did not provide any eﬀective bound for the
discriminants D < 0 such that h(D) is less than any given value.
A reﬁned proof by Heilbronn and Linfoot (1934b), led to the
conclusion that, apart from at most one extra tenth discriminant, all
values of D < 0 such that h(D) = 1 are those already mentioned:
|D| = 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163.
It took a rather long time to rule out this extra discriminant; the
story is quite interesting.
Heegner (1952)—who incidentally, as a high school teacher, was
an outsider—published a paper showing that the extra tenth dis-
criminant does not in fact exist. Heegner’s proof, using the theory

160
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
of modular forms, was discounted as being incorrect; in fact, there
were errors in it, as well as obscure passages.
Baker (1966) put to good use his eﬀective minoration of linear
forms of three logarithms, and showed that the extra discriminant
does not exist.
Stark (1967) gave another proof, similar to Heegner’s. Still
another proof was due to Siegel (1968).
A reexamination of Heegner’s proof by Deuring (1968) suﬃced
to put it back on solid ground. And Stark (1969) compounded the
embarrassment by showing how the theorem could have been proved
by the eﬀective minoration of a linear form in two logarithms—and
this was already fully possible using the transcendence results of
Gel’fond and Linnik, known in 1949.
The road was paved to deal with the imaginary quadratic ﬁelds
of class number 2. Using eﬀective minorations of logarithms, Baker
(1971) and Stark (1971), independently, showed that h(D) = 2
exactly when
|D| = 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 22, 35, 37, 51, 58, 91, 115, 123, 187, 235, 267,
403, 427.
Still a long way was ahead before Gauss’ conjectures for the class
number of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds could be settled. It was essen-
tial to obtain eﬀective minorations for the class number. The way to
this achievement was convoluted, and involved the theory of modular
forms and elliptic functions.
The culmination of the work of Goldfeld (1977) and Gross and
Zagier (1986) gave (in 1983) the following eﬀective minoration for
h(D):
For every δ > 0, there exists an eﬀectively computable number
C = C(ϵ) > 0 such that
h(D) > C(log |D|)1−ϵ.
This is suﬃcient to imply that for every given number n there is an
eﬀective bound B(n), depending on n, such that if h(D) = n, then
|D| ≤B(n). So, Gauss’ class number conjectures for deﬁnite forms
is true.
Explicit computations by Oesterl´e (1983) led to the minoration:
h(D) > 1
55(log |D|)

p|D, p̸=2
	
1 −[2√p]
p + 1

.

19 The class number problem for indeﬁnite forms
161
This minoration holds for discriminants prime to 5077.
This, and similar estimates, have allowed the determination of all
ﬁelds with class number 3 (there are 16 such ﬁelds, and for these,
D ≤907), with class number 4 (there are 54 such ﬁelds, and for
these, D < 1555), and more is still to come along these lines.
The same method of Heilbronn allowed Chowla to give a (non-
eﬀective) lower bound for the number of classes in the principal genus
of any discriminant D < 0. Recall that this number is h(D)/g(D),
where g(D) is the number of genera.
Chowla (1934) showed that
lim
|D|→∞
h(D)
g(D) = ∞.
In particular, for every n ≥1 there exist only ﬁnitely many dis-
criminants D < 0 such that the number of classes in the principal
genus is n. This gives a solution, albeit non-eﬀective, of the fourth
conjecture of Gauss (see §14).
Further work by Chowla and Briggs (1954) and Weinberger
(1973a) led to the following interesting conclusion:
Apart from the known discriminants with only one class in the
principal genus, listed in §12, there exists at most one other D, and
|D| > 1060. Whether or not such a discriminant actually exists is still
unknown. However, the existence is denied, as soon as an appropriate
weak hypothesis is made about the zeroes of the associated L-series;
see Chowla and Briggs (1954) and Grosswald (1963).
19
The class number problem for indeﬁnite forms
Recall that Gauss had conjectured, on the basis of numerical
calculations, that there should exist inﬁnitely many fundamental dis-
criminants D > 0 such that h(D) = 1, or equivalently, there exist
inﬁnitely many real quadratic ﬁelds with class number one.
The problem is very much tied to the size of the fundamental unit
ϵD. Indeed, Siegel showed in 1936:
log(h(D) log ϵD) ∼log
√
D
(asymptotically, as D →∞).
Extensive computations of the class number by Wada (1981),
Mollin and Williams (1992), and, more recently, by Jacobson

162
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
(1998) give weight to this conjecture. Yet, its proof is elusive and of
great diﬃculty.
I wish to indicate some recent approaches to the problem and
related studies.
First, there are very interesting heuristic considerations by Cohen
and Lenstra (1984) (or Cohen (1993)) that involve the automor-
phism group of the class group and lead to the conclusion that the
proportion of real quadratic ﬁelds with class number one ought to be
75.466%. This is indeed very close to the proportion observed in the
tables. I shall return in the next section to these conjectures, which
have a much wider scope.
An interesting notion, studied by Lachaud (1986, 1987), is the
caliber of a fundamental discriminant D, or of the corresponding
ﬁeld K = Q(
√
D). By deﬁnition, the caliber c(D) is the number of
reduced primitive forms, under proper equivalence. Note that if D <
0, then c(D) = h(D), but if D > 0, then in general c(D) > h(D),
and how much greater depends on the periods of the roots associated
to the reduced forms.
For each class Q of reduced forms, let m(Q) denote the number
of forms in its period. Then
m(Q) log α ≤log ϵ′
D < m(Q) log
√
D
where
ϵ′
D =



ϵD
if N(ϵD) = +1,
ϵ2
D
if N(ϵD) = −1,
ϵD is the fundamental unit, and α = (1+
√
5)/2 is the golden number.
Then
c(D) log α ≤h+(D) log ϵ′
D < c(D) log
√
D,
and this may be rewritten as
c(D) log α ≤h(D) log ϵD < c(D) log
√
D.
From Siegel’s result,
log(h(D) log ϵD) ∼log
√
D,
and it follows that
log c(D) ∼log
√
D.

19 The class number problem for indeﬁnite forms
163
Hence, for every n ≥1, there exist only ﬁnitely many real
quadratic ﬁelds K = Q(
√
D) such that c(D) ≤n.
This is the analog to the result indicated for the class number of
imaginary quadratic ﬁelds, but just the contrary of what is expected
for the class number of real quadratic ﬁelds.
As a consequence, for every n ≥1 and m ≥1, the set {D > 0 | D
is a fundamental discriminant, h(D) ≤n, and the maximum m(D)
of the lengths of the periods of reduced forms of discrinimant D is at
most m} is ﬁnite—because for each such D, c(D) ≤mn. See Sasaki
(1986).
In particular, for every m ≥1, there exist only ﬁnitely many fun-
damental discriminants D > 0 such that h(D) = 1, and the periods
of the reduced forms are of length at most equal to m. However, the
preceding assertions are not eﬀective results.
As usual, with a weaker form of the generalized Riemann hypothe-
sis about the L-series of the character χ of D, it is possible to obtain
an eﬀective result, namely,
h(D) log ϵD < 4.23c(D).
Then, with the same assumption, Lachaud showed that the only
real quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
D) with caliber one are the seven ﬁelds
Q(
√
D) with D = 2, 5, 13, 29, 53, 173, 293. Moreover, Sasaki showed
that if also m(D) = 1, then D = 2.
Other types of results have the following ﬂavor: if D > 0 is a
fundamental discriminant of a given “shape”, there are only ﬁnitely
many real quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
D) with class number one.
Thus, Chowla and Friedlander (1976) had conjectured that
if p is a prime, p = m2 + 1, and Q(√p) has class number one, then
p = 2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 677. Analogously, if p is a prime, p = m2 +4
and Q(√p) has class number one, then p = 5, 13, 29, 173, 293.
This was proved, under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, in-
dependently by Lachaud (1987) and by Mollin and Williams
(1988).
I want also to highlight another theorem of the same family, proved
by Mollin and Williams (1989):
A square-free positive integer d = n2 + r, where r divides 4n, is
said to be of extended Richaud-Degert type.
There are 43 (and possibly 44) integers d of extended Richaud-
Degert type whose corresponding ﬁeld Q(
√
d) has class number one;

164
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
a complete list is:
d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 21, 23, 29, 33, 37, 38, 47, 53, 62, 69, 77,
83, 93, 101, 141, 167, 173, 197, 213, 227, 237, 293, 398, 413, 437,
453, 573, 677, 717, 1077, 1133, 1253, 1293,
1757 and possibly another value.
Now, let d > 0, d ̸= 1 be a square-free integer and, as previously,
let
ω =



√
d
if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4),
1+
√
d
2
if d ≡1 (mod 4).
Denote by k the length of the period of the continued fraction
expansion of ω.
Mollin and Williams (1989) have also determined explicitly
(with possibly one exception) all the ﬁnitely many real quadratic
ﬁelds K = Q(
√
d) having class number one or two and such that the
length of the period of ω is k ≤24. This time not all integers d are
of extended Richaud-Degert type.
For a uniﬁed presentation of the results thus far obtained by
Mollin and Williams, the reader may wish to consult their paper
Mollin and Williams (1990) and the book Quadratics by Mollin
(1996).
There are, there were, and there will be, more partial results about
this problem before a real insight will allow us to ﬁnd the right way
to approach it.

More questions and conjectures
The study of the conjectures of §14 has led to more embracing and
deeper problems, all interrelated and, most likely, very diﬃcult. Even
though, at the present, and to my knowledge, there is no method
to attack these questions with any signiﬁcant success, I think it is
nevertheless worthwhile to explicitly state the problems.
Problem 1. Is every natural number equal to the class number of
some quadratic ﬁeld with negative discriminant, respectively positive
discriminant, D?

20 More questions and conjectures
165
The following question is intimately related and even more
diﬃcult:
Problem 2. Is every ﬁnite abelian group G isomorphic to the class
group of a quadratic ﬁeld with discriminant D < 0, respectively
D > 0? If so, are there inﬁnitely many number ﬁelds Q(
√
D), with
D > 0, such that the class group of Q(
√
D) is isomorphic to G?
Boyd and Kisilevsky (1972) showed that there are only ﬁnitely
many imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with class group isomorphic to a
product of cyclic groups of order 3; they showed, under the general-
ized Riemann hypothesis, the corresponding result for class groups
products of cyclic groups of order n > 3.
The next problem concerns the p-rank rp(D) (for p prime) of the
class group of the quadratic ﬁeld with discriminant D.
Problem 3. Let p ≥3. Is every natural number equal to the p-rank
rp(D) for some negative discriminant, respectively positive discrimi-
nant, D? In the aﬃrmative, are there inﬁnitely many discriminants D
such that r3(D) is greater or equal to a given natural number n?
Craig (1977) showed that there exist inﬁnitely many negative
discriminants D, such that r3(D) ≥4.
Can one at least decide:
Problem 4. Is sup{rp(D) : |D| ≥1} = ∞? (for D < 0, respectively
D > 0).
In this respect, it is important to learn how to determine
discriminants for which the p-rank is likely to be large.
It would also be very relevant to obtain estimates for the p-rank.
Perhaps this could be feasible for negative discriminants.
Concerning this question, I wish to report that now there are
known discriminants D < 0 for which the 3-rank is n, for every
n ≤6, and also discriminants D < 0 for which the 5-rank is n, for
every n ≤4.
Quer (1987) showed
r3(−408368221541174183) = 6
and Schoof (1983) computed
r5(−258559351511807) = 4;

166
6. Gauss and the Class Number Problem
see also Llorente and Quer (1988).
It is not necessary to discuss the 2-rank because it follows from
the theory of genera that if D is a fundamental discriminant with r
distinct prime factors, then the 2-rank is r2(D) = r −1 because the
number of ambiguous classes is 2r−1.
This is the place to mention some results of divisibility of the class
number, which are, however, not strong enough to settle any of the
above problems.
Nagell (1929) showed that for every n > 1 there exist inﬁnitely
many imaginary quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
D), D < 0, with class number
divisible by n.
This is a theorem which was rediscovered by Humbert (1939)
and by Ankeny and Chowla (1955). In 1986, Mollin extended
the result with a simpler proof (see Mollin (1986)).
Similarly, for real quadratic ﬁelds, ﬁrst Honda (1968) showed that
there exist inﬁnitely many real quadratic ﬁelds with class number
divisible by 3. In 1970, it was shown by Yamamoto (1970) and also
by Weinberger (1973b): for every n > 1 there exist inﬁnitely many
real quadratic ﬁelds with class number divisible by n.
Now I return to the heuristic arguments of Cohen and Lenstra
(1984); see also the book of Cohen (1993). From inspection of the
tables of class groups (see Buell (1976, 1987), Saito and Wada
(1988a,b)) for negative discriminants, it is apparent that the 3-Sylow
subgroup is eight times more often isomorphic to C9 than to C3 ×C3
(here Cn denotes the multiplicative cyclic group of order n). This is
exactly the ratio
# Aut(C9)
# Aut(C3 × C3).
This, and similar facts, suggest that probabilities of occurrence
of a type of p-Sylow subgroup should be computed by weighing the
groups G with weights 1/# Aut(G). With this simple idea, Cohen
and Lenstra arrived at probabilities which are amazingly close to
observed values.
First, let D < 0.
The probability that the odd part of the class group is a cyclic
group is equal to
ζ(2)ζ(3)

The probability that the p-Sylow subgroup (p > 2) of the class
group be equal to a given group is:

S3 = C3 × C3

S3 = C3 × C3 × C3

: 2.3 × 10−8%
S5 = C25
: 3.80%
S5 = C5 × C5
: 0.16%, etc. . . .
Now, let D > 0.
The probability that the order of the odd part of the class group
be equal to n is u(n), where
u(1) = 75.5%
u(3) = 12.6%
u(5) = 3.8%
u(7) = 1.8%
u(9) = 1.6%, etc . . . .
u(n) is also the probability that the class number of Q(√p) (with p
prime) is equal to n.

The above heuristic results suggest, of course, what should be the
answers to the problems stated in the beginning of this section.
The reader may wish to consult the recent paper of Jacobson
(1998). This paper contains tables requiring extensive calculations
for D < 109. The numerical results conﬁrm the amazing conjectures
of Cohen and Lenstra and provide lists of discriminants for which
the class group contains non-cyclic p-Sylow subgroups (for all p ≤
23), etc.
21
Many topics have not been discussed
This extended version of my lecture is already much longer than
intended. Yet, many topics of no lesser importance could not and
will not be discussed. Among these topics, the geometric theory
of quadratic forms, as developed by Klein, leading to an intimate
connection with modular forms; see the expository paper of Serre
(1985).
The problem of representation of integers by quadratic forms,
which cannot be completely solved by the methods presented here
when there is more than one class in the principal genus, can how-
ever be dealt with using class ﬁeld theory, more speciﬁcally with the
Hilbert symbol. This development is very well presented in the book
of Cox (1989).
Shanks made good use of the class group and even of its infras-
tructure, to invent clever algorithms for factorization and primality;
see Shanks (1969, 1976, 1989).

Introduction
(a) If we write the sequence of squares and cubes of integers in
increasing order
4 8 9 16 25 27 36 49 64 81 100 . . . ,
say,
z1 < z2 < z3 < z4 < · · · < zn < zn+1 < · · ·
we may ask many questions. For example:
(I) Are there consecutive integers in this sequence? Of course, yes:
8 and 9. Are there others? How many? Only ﬁnitely many?
If we examine a list of squares and cubes up to 1 000 000, we ﬁnd
no other example. Is this always true? Or will there be, perhaps by
accident, other consecutive squares and cubes?
If a search with a computer is pushed further, we may observe that
the diﬀerences appear to become larger (but not monotonically), that
is, squares and cubes appear more sparsely. Yet we should not from
this experimental observation conclude that no consecutive cube and
square, other than 8 and 9, exist.

176
7. Consecutive Powers
Consider the following situation where numbers more and more
sparsely distributed are still suﬃcient for a certain representation.
Namely, among the numbers up to 10 000 there are only 100 squares,
so
1
100; up to 1 000 000 there are only 1 000 squares, so
1
1,000; up
to 100 000 000 there are only 10 000 squares, so
1
10,000; etc. So, the
squares are less and less common. Yet, Lagrange proved that every
natural number is the sum of (at most) four squares.
Thus, even though the squares are less and less present they occupy
“strategic positions,” so four squares are always enough to reproduce
by addition any natural number.
This was mentioned just to prevent anyone to jump to false
conclusions.
A second question is the following:
(II) Given k (now k ≥2), for how many indices n is it true that
zn+1 −zn ≤k? Only ﬁnitely many?
We may also consider other sequences involving powers:
(b) The sequence z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · of all proper powers of
integers: squares, cubes, 5th powers, 7th powers, etc.
(c) If a, b ≥2, a ̸= b, we may consider the sequence z1 < z2 <
z3 < · · · of all powers of a or b.
For example, if a = 2, b = 3:
4 5 9 16 27 32 64 81 128 243 256 . . . .
(d) If E = {p1, . . . , pr} where r ≥2 and each pi is a prime number,
let S be the set of all natural numbers all of whose prime factors are
in E:
S: z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · .
The sequence (c) is, of course, a subsequence of one of type (d).
For each of the sequences (b), (c), (d) we may ask the same ques-
tions (I) and (II). Also, for the sequence (b) of all powers, we may
ask the question (which is of no interest for the sequences (a), (c),
(d)):
(III) Are there three or more consecutive powers? How many?
None? Finitely many?
Before we proceed, let us discuss whether these questions are just
a curiosity. We may paraphrase Gauss’ point of view: “Any fool

2 History
177
can ask questions about numbers, which even a thousand wise men
cannot solve.”
Are these questions of this kind? No! As they involve powers
(therefore, multiplication in a rather special way) and diﬀerences,
they combine the additive and multiplicative structure of the inte-
gers. Somewhat like a famous unsolved problem of Fermat: is the
sum of two nth powers again a nth power, when n > 2?
As it turns out, the study of these questions contributes substan-
tially to the knowledge of the integers. And this amply justiﬁes these
investigations.
2
History
Our treatment of the problem will follow somewhat the historical
development. So, we shall be very brief here, underlining only a few
points.
(1) We may read in Dickson’s useful History of the Theory of
Numbers, Volume II , that the ﬁrst mention of this problem is in a
question asked by Philippe de Vitry: Can 3m ±1 be a power of 2?
This was solved by Levi ben Gerson (alias Leo Hebracus), who
lived in Spain from 1288 to 1344. He showed that if 3m ± 1 = 2n,
then m = 2, n = 3, so these numbers are 9 and 8.
(2) In 1657, in his “Deuxieme Deli aux Mathematiciens” (letter
to Fr´enicle de Bessy), Fermat proposed to show: if p is an odd
prime and n ≥2, then pn +1 is not a square; similarly, if n ≥4, then
2n + 1 is not a square.
A proof, published by Fr´enicle, was discovered in 1943 by
Hofmann.
(3) Using the method of inﬁnite descent, which had been invented
by Fermat, Euler showed in 1738 that if the diﬀerence between a
square and a cube is ±1, then these numbers are 9 and 8.
(4) In 1844, in a letter to Crelle (appearing in Volume I of
Crelle’s journal), Catalan asked for a proof that the only con-
secutive powers are 8 and 9. This assertion is now called “Catalan’s
conjecture”. In other words, he proposed to prove that the equation
XU −Y V = 1 in four unknown quantities, two of which are in the
exponent, has only the solution x = 3, u = 2, y = 2, v = 3 in nat-
ural numbers bigger than 1. The only results of Catalan on this
equation are simple observations, which are in his M´elanges Math-

178
7. Consecutive Powers
ematiques, XV , published much later in 1885. Among the various
statements, Catalan asserted, without proof, that if xy −yx = 1,
then x = 2, y = 3—but this is rather a simple exercise to prove. For
a biography of Catalan, see Jongmans (1996).
(5) In the next phase, various special cases, with powers having
small exponents, were considered by Lebesgue (1850) and, in this
century, by Nagell, Obl´ath, S. Selberg, Chao Ko, et al.
(6) Then came a series of results imposing divisibility constraints
on any natural numbers x, y such that xm −yn = 1. The most
important results of this kind refer to exponents m, n which are odd
primes. They are due to Cassels, Inkeri, and Hyyr¨o.
(7) Finally, there were the results concerning estimates on the
number and size of possible consecutive powers. Here the most
important contributions are ﬁrst due to Hyyr¨o and above all to
Tijdeman who used high-powered methods from the theories of dio-
phantine approximation and Baker’s estimates on linear forms of
logarithms.
We shall discuss all these points in more detail.
3
Special cases
Unless stated to the contrary, the numbers appearing in the
equations are natural numbers.
As is ﬁtting, we begin with Levi ben Gerson’s result; the proof
given here was provided by M. Langevin, while another proof was
published by Franklin (1923).
(3.1) If m, n ≥2 and 3m −2n = ±1, then m = 2, n = 3. Thus, in
the sequence of powers of 2 or 3, the only consecutive integers are 8
and 9.
Proof.
If 2n −3m = 1 then 2n ≡1 (mod 3), so n is even, n = 2n′.
Then 3m = 22n′ −1 = (2n′ −1)(2n′ +1), hence 2n′ −1 = 3m′, 2n′ +1 =
3m−m′ with 0 ≤m′ < m −m′. Subtracting, 2 = 3m′(3m−2m′ −1),
hence m′ = 0, n′ = 1, n = 2, m = 1, against the hypothesis.
If 3m −2n = 1, if n = 2 this is impossible, so n ≥3, hence
3m ≡1 (mod 8). Therefore, m is even, m = 2m′. Then 2n = 32m′ −
1 = (3m′ −1)(3m′ + 1), hence 3m′ −1 = 2n′, 3m′ + 1 = 2n−n′ with
0 ≤n′ < n −n′. Subtracting, 2 = 2n′(2n−2n′ −1), hence n′ = 1,
n = 2n′ + 1 = 3, and m = 2.

3 Special cases
179
The following observation is quite obvious: if m, n ≥2, if there
exist solutions in natural numbers of the equation Xm−Y n = 1, and
if p, q are primes such that p | m, q | n, then there exist solutions
in natural numbers of the equation Xp −Y q = 1. So, we are led to
study the equation Xp −Y q = 1 with p, q distinct primes.
Euler proved in 1738 the following basic lemma:
Lemma 1. Let p, q be primes, and let x, y ≥2 be such that xp−yq =
1. If p is odd, then
x −1 = aq
with y = aa′, p ∤aa′,
xp −1
x −1 = (a′)q
gcd(a, a′) = 1,
or
x −1 = pq−1aq
with y = paa′, p ∤a′,
xp−1
x −1 = p(a′)q
gcd(a, a′) = 1.
Similarly, if q is odd then
y + 1 = bp
with x = bb′, q ∤bb′,
yq + 1
y + 1 = (b′)p
gcd(b, b′) = 1,
or
y + 1 = qp−1bp
with x = qbb′, q ∤b′,
yq + 1
y + 1 = q(b′)p
gcd(b, b′) = 1.
Proof.
This proof is quite simple and so we shall indicate it. We
have
yq = xp −1 = (x −1)xp −1
x −1 .
But gcd

= 1 or p, because
xp −1
x −1 = [(x −1) + 1]p −1
x −1
= (x −1)p−1 +
p
1

(x −1)p−2 + . . . +

p
p −2

(x −1) + p.
Moreover, the greatest common divisor in question is equal to p
exactly when p | y.

180

Next, we note that p2 ∤xp−1
x−1 . Indeed, if p | xp−1
x−1 , then p | x−1; but
p2 divides each summand (x−1)p−1, . . . ,

p
p−2

(x−1), so p2 cannot
divide xp−1
x−1 . Therefore we have shown the ﬁrst assertion, concerning
x −1 and xp−1
x−1 . The proof of the second assertion is similar.
2
With the same method, Euler proved:
Lemma 2. If q is an odd prime, x, y ≥2, and x2 −yq = 1, then
x −1 = 2aq
x + 1 = 2q−1(a′)q
or



x + 1 = 2aq
x −1 = 2q−1(a′)q
where a, a′ ≥1, a is odd, gcd(a, a′) = 1.
Using the method of inﬁnite descent, Euler proved:
(3.2) If x, y ≥1 and x2 −y3 = ±1, then x = 3, y = 2. So, in
the sequence of squares and cubes, 8 and 9 are the only consecutive
integers.
Euler had actually shown that the only solutions in positive ra-
tional numbers of X2 −Y 3 = ±1 are x = 3, y = 2; his proof is rather
tricky.
We also note here that Euler used the method of inﬁnite de-
scent to show that Fermat’s equation X3 + Y 3 = Z3 has only trivial
solutions in integers.
In 1921, Nagell proposed another proof, reducing it to an earlier
result of Legendre (1830, Volume II, page 9): the equation X3 +
Y 3 = 2Z3 has only the solutions x = y = z or x = −y, z = 0 in
integers. Legendre’s proof was also by inﬁnite descent. Bachmann
gave in 1919 an incorrect proof of Legendre’s result without using
the method of descent.
Another way of proving Euler’s result, without the method of
descent, uses the numbers in the cubic ﬁeld K = Q(
3√
2). From
∓1 = u3 −2v3 = (u −
3√
2v)(u2 +
3√
2uv +
3√
4v2)

3 Special cases
181
it follows that u −
3√
2v is a unit of the ﬁeld K. As is known (see
LeVeque’s book, Volume II, pages 108–109), u−
3√
2v is, up to sign,
a power of the fundamental unit −1 +
3√
2:
u −
3√
2v = ±(−1 +
3√
2)n.
Then, it is shown that n cannot be negative, and n ̸= 2. Finally it is
shown that n cannot be greater than 2, by comparing coeﬃcients in
the two sides, and considering congruences modulo 3.
So, u −
3√
2v = ±(−1 +
3√
2), leading to x = 3, y = 2.
After X2 −Y 3 = ±1 was treated by Euler, next came the
equations X2 −Y m = ±1 (with n ≥5).
As it happens, and it is certainly surprising, one of these equations
was rather easy to treat, while the other required 120 years to be
solved!
Which is the easy one? Here is the answer. Lebesgue used
Gaussian integers to show, in 1850:
(3.3) The equation Xm−Y 2 = 1 has only trivial solutions in natural
numbers.
Proof.
Once more, we give a sketch of the proof, leaving the de-
tails to the reader. If x, y ≥2 and xm = y2 + 1 = (y + i)(y −i), then
x is odd, y must be even, and there exist integers u, v such that
y + i = (u + iv)mis
(with 0 ≤s ≤3);
hence
y −i = (u −iv)m(−i)s.
So, x = u2+v2 and since x is odd, then u or v is even. By subtracting,
we have 2i = [(u + iv)m −(u −iv)m(−1)s]is and this leads to
1 −
m

w4 −. . . ± mwm−1 = ±1,
where w = u,
v = ±1 (when s is even), or w = v, u = ±1 (when s is odd); so w is
even. The sign −would imply that w2 divides 2, which is impossible.
The sign + is also impossible, and this is seen by considering the
2-adic values of the summands in the above relation.
2
We shall postpone the study of the more diﬃcult equation X2 −
Y m = 1.
So, the next equations in line are X3 −Y m = ±1, which were
studied by Nagell in 1921. First, he showed:

182
7. Consecutive Powers
(3.4) (a) If m ≥2 is not a power of 3, the only non-zero solutions
of X2 + X + 1 = Y m are (−1, 1) when m is odd, and (−1, ±1) when
m is even.
(b) If m > 2, the only non-zero solutions of X2 + X + 1 = 3Y m
are x = 1 and x = −2.
Moreover, if m = 2, there are also the solutions
±
√
3
4 [(2 +
√
3)2n+1 −(2 −
√
3)2n+1] −1
2
for n = 0, 1, . . . .
The proof is much longer, so we just say that for (a) Nagell
worked in Q(ω) = Q(√−3), where ω = −1+√−3
2
is a cube root of 1.
He was led to the equations X ± ω = (Z −ω)q where q is a prime,
q > 3, the only solutions being x = ±1, 0. For (b), if m = 2, Nagell
worked in the ﬁeld Q(
√
3) which has the fundamental unit 2+
√
3. If
4 | m, he was led to the equation U4 + V 4 = W 2, which as Fermat
showed, has only trivial solutions. If m is a power of 3, Nagell was
led to the equation X3 + Y 3 = Z3. Finally, for all other values of m,
he worked in the ﬁeld Q(ω).
Now, it was easy for Nagell to show:
(3.5) The equations X3 ± 1 = Y m (with m not a power of 2) have
only trivial solutions in integers.
Proof.
We may assume that m = q is a prime, q > 3. If x, y are
such that yq = x3 ± 1 = (x2 ∓x + 1)(x ± 1), then x2 ∓x + 1 = aq
or 3aq, where a is an integer. Replacing x by −x (in the case of the
minus sign), we have x2 + x + 1 = aq or 3aq, and this leads to the
result.
2
Ljunggren (1942, 1943) studied the equation xn−1
x−1
= ym and
completed Nagell’s result (3.4)(a) above, showing that it holds
also when m is a power of 3.
We return to the equation X2 −Y n = 1 (with n > 3), which re-
sisted many attempts until it was ﬁnally completely solved. As we
shall see, the solution was elementary, but certainly not straight-
forward. We shall present here several of the partial results. Even
though they are now completely superseded, it is illuminating to see
the ways mathematicians have tried to solve the equation, and the
connection with other interesting problems.

3 Special cases
183
As already indicated, the ﬁrst mention of this equation was in Fer-
mat’s “second d´eﬁnux math´ematiciens” of 1657. We give Fr´enicle’s
result:
(3.6) If p is an odd prime, n ≥2, then pn + 1 is not a square. If
n ≥4, then 2n + 1 is not a square.
Proof.
If pn = x2 −1 = (x + 1)(x −1), with p ̸= 2, then gcd(x +
1, x −1) = 1, so
x + 1 = pa
x −1 = pb
Thus x−1 = 1, x+1 = pn, hence pn = 3, n ≥2, which is impossible.
The proof of the other assertion is similar.
2
The weaker statement that for every integer y, the number yn + 1
is not a 4th power was proved by S. Selberg in 1932. His proof
appealed to an older result of Størmer (1899), which is linked with
the speedy calculation of the decimal development of π.
Let us explain this unexpected connection, beginning with a quick
history of the calculation of π.
Using the method of inscribed and circumscribed polygons,
Archimedes gave, circa 250 B.C., the estimate
3.1408 = 223
71 < π < 22
7 = 3.1428.
In the XIIth century, Fibonacci (Leonardo di Pisa) calculated π
to be about 864
275 = 3.1418. Adrianus Metius (1571–1635) estimated
3.14150 = 333
106 < π < 355
113 = 3.14159.
In the XVIth century, F. Vi`ete (1540–1603) expressed π with an
inﬁnite product:
π =

and this gave
3.1415926535 < π < 3.1415926537.

A. van Rooman calculated π to 15 decimal places in 1593. Lu-
dolph van Ceulen devoted his life to the calculation of π; ﬁrst, in
1596 he computed 20 decimals, using a polygon with 60 × 229 sides!
And, after his death, his wife published in 1615 Ludolph’s calcu-
lated value of π which had 32 correct decimals. His contemporaries
were so impressed with this painstaking work that until recently
German authors referred to π as the Ludolph number.
In the XVIIth century, there appeared inﬁnite series, inﬁnite prod-
ucts, and continued fractions: the series for the arcsine given by I.
Newton (1642–1727) in 1676; the continued fraction expression for
π/4 by Lord W. Brouncker (1620–1684), found in 1658:
π

the inﬁnite product for π/2 by J. Wallis (1616–1703), in 1655:

3 · 4
3 · 4

the power series for the arctangent function given by J. Gregory
(1638–1675) in 1671 and, independently, the alternating series for
π/4 by G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) in 1674:
π
4 = arctan 1 = 1 −1
3 + 1
5 −1
7 + · · · .
In 1699, A. Sharp (1651–1742) used the series for the arctangent,
with λ =
1
√
3, and computed π to 72 decimals—a far cry from the
lifelong eﬀorts required with the polygon method.
In 1737 (published in 1744), Euler calculated π to 127 decimals.
But, more interesting are the expressions which he discovered in
1755, for even powers of π in terms of the sums of series of inverses
of even powers of natural numbers (values of the ζ-function):

The interest of the above formulas is more theoretical than com-
putational, but we shall not enter into this matter here. Euler
(published in 1783) obtained also the following generalization of
Vi`ete’s inﬁnite product for π, namely, if 0 < θ < 180◦, then
θ =
sin θ

this gives Vi`ete’s formula when θ = 90◦.
The series for π/4 converges too slowly. However, it is possible to
speed up the convergence by using the addition formula. Namely,
from tan(x + y) =
tan x+tan y
1−tan x tan y, taking x = arctan u, y = arctan v,
then arctan u + arctan v = arctan u+v
1−uv.
Choosing u, v such that
u+v
1−uv = 1, then π/4 = arctan u+arctan v.
For example, let u = 1
2, so v = 1
3, hence (∗) π/4 = arctan 1

This series still converges too slowly. To improve the convergence,
we determine v such that

so v = 1

The ﬁrst equality in this formula was given by Hutton, in 1776,
and Euler, in 1779, while the second form is attributed to G. von
Vega (1756–1802) in 1794.

which is J. Machin’s (1680–1752) formula.
The series in the above formulas converge much more rapidly, and
allowed the computation of π to many decimals: J. Machin (1706)
with 100 decimals, F. de Lagny (1719) with 127 decimals, and G.
von Vega (1789) with 136 decimals.
The same method was used by the prodigy calculator Z. Dahse,
author of an extended table of primes. In 1844, in two months,
Dahse computed π to 200 decimals. The astronomer T. Clausen
went to 248 decimals in 1847. Later eﬀorts in the last century were,
among others, by W. Rutherford, in 1853, up to 400 decimals,
Richter, in 1855, up to 500 decimals, and W. Shanks, in 1873, up
to 707 decimals (but “only” 527 decimals were correct, as found out
later).
With the advent of computers, π was calculated in 1962 by
D. Shanks and J. W. Wrench up to 100 000 decimals using the
formula
π
4 = 6 arctan 1
8 + 2 arctan 1
57 + arctan 1
239.
The calculations were extended by J. Guilloud and M. Bouyer
who computed π to one million decimals in 1974, using Gauss’
formula
π
64 = 3
4 arctan 1
18 + 1
2 arctan 1
57 −5
16 arctan 1
239.
For the history of calculation of π up to 1960, see the paper of
Wrench (1960) and, more particularly, to the special issue on π of
the magazine Petit Archim´ede (1980) which is quite well documented
and interesting to read.

An explosive progress in the calculation of decimals of π came
about with the implementation of the old arithmetic-geometric mean
of Gauss as proposed by the brothers Borwein. These matters are
discussed in their very stimulating book Pi and the AGM (1987);
see also the article of Bailey, Borwein, Borwein, and Plouffe
(1997) . At present, 50 billion decimals of π have been calculated.
This record was attained by Y. Kahada and D. Takahashi in July
1997.

One wonders what, if any, information of interest can be obtained
from such extensive calculations? A place in The Guiness Book of
Records? Is there anything to do with atomic energy that would be
revealed by special patterns of the decimal digits of π? As a matter
or fact, in June 1949, J. von Neumann suggested using ENIAC to
determine many decimals for π and e and study the distribution of
decimal digits statistically. It has been observed that any digit, or for
that matter, any short sequence of digits like 40533, occurs among
the decimals of π. For example the sequence 0123456789 occurs be-
ginning at the 17 387 594 880th digit after the decimal point. Of
course, this is an experimental observation and does not constitute
or lead to a proof of the “normality” of π.
As seen above, the computations of π have used formulas like
the ones marked with (∗). In this respect, D. Grav´e from Saint-
Petersburg asked which of the formulas
m arctan 1
x + n arctan 1
y = kπ
4
are true, where m, n, k, x, y are nonzero integers, and k, x, y ≥1.

188
7. Consecutive Powers
This problem, related to the speedy calculation of π, provided a
link with the equation X4 −1 = Y n, studied by S. Selberg.
In 1897, Størmer solved Grav´e’s problem; he gave a simpler
proof in 1899. Writing (a1 + ib1) · · · (an + ibn) = reiφ (aj, bj, φ real
and r real positive), then φ = arctan b1
a1 + · · · + arctan bn
an . Thus,
arctan b1
a1 + · · · + arctan bn
an = sπ (where s is an integer) if and only if
(a1 + ib1) · · · (an + ibn) is a real number. In particular, m arctan 1
x +
n arctan 1
y = k π
4 if and only if (1 −i)k(x + i)m(y + i)n is real. This
leads to the solution in integers of the equations 1 + X2 = Y n or
1 + X2 = 2Y n (where n ≥3, n odd). As we have seen in (3.3), the
ﬁrst of these equations has only trivial solutions. As for the second,
Størmer showed:
(3.7) If n is not a power of 2 and n > 1, then the only solutions of
1 + X2 = 2Y n are x = ±1.
We note, incidentally, that the equation 1 + X2 = 2Y 4 had been
solved by Lagrange (1777) by the method of descent, the only
solutions in natural numbers being x = 239, y = 13 (and the trivial
solutions x = 1, y = 1).
Using (3.7), Størmer showed that the only solutions for Grav´e’s
problem were the expressions already indicated with (∗). So, some-
how, just by trial, the signiﬁcant formulas involving two arctangents
had already been found!
After this aside, we return to Selberg’s result.
(3.8) If n ≥2, the equation X4 −Y n = 1 has only trivial solutions.
Proof.
This is easy to see when n is even, so we assume n to be
odd. If y is odd, then yn = x4 −1 = (x2 + 1)(x2 −1), hence there
exist natural numbers a, b such that
x2 + 1 = an
x2 −1 = bn.
By subtracting, we easily reach a contradiction. If y is even, then
x2 + 1 = 2an
x2 −1 = 2n−1bn
(with a, b integers). By Størmer’s result, x2 = 1, y = 0, which is a
trivial solution.

The next developments in the study of the equation X2 −Y n = 1
were fruitless attempts, false routes, and wanderings. It is, how-
ever, interesting to report on these partial results, since some of the
methods were used again for other exponents.
In 1934, Nagell showed that if X2−Y q = 1 (with q prime, q > 3)
has a non-trivial solution, then q ≡1 (mod 8). Moreover, there are
at most ﬁnitely many solutions, as follows from a general theorem
of Thue, which will be discussed in the last section of this paper.
In 1940/1941, Obl´ath, inspired by theorems of Wieferich and
Mirimanoff on Fermat’s equation Xp + Y p = Zp, showed that if
X2 −Y q = 1 has a non-trivial solution, then
2q−1 ≡1 (mod q2)
and
3q−1 ≡1 (mod q2).
As is known (and as we shall discuss later in this chapter), the
above congruences are very rarely satisﬁed.
Inkeri and Hyyr¨o (1961) showed that if x2 −yq = 1, then q2 | x,
q3 | y + 1; moreover, they improved on estimates of Obl´ath (1941,
1954), showing that
x > 2q(q−2) > 103×109
and
y > 4q−2 > 106×105.
Finally, as was becoming believable, it was shown by Chao Ko in
two papers of 1960 and 1964 that X2 −Y n = 1 has only trivial
solutions.
The proof was subsequently very much simpliﬁed by Chein (1976).
It is based on elementary, though non-trivial, results. The ﬁrst one
concerns the equation X2 −DY 2 = 1, with D > 0, D not a square.
In 1657, Fermat stated in a letter to Fr´enicle that this equa-
tion has inﬁnitely many solutions in integers but, as usual, he gave
no proof. For a history of this important equation, consult Dick-
son’s, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II (1920) and Heath’s
Diophantus of Alexandria (1885).
Euler contributed to the theory of this equation but he is also
responsible for ascribing it to Pell, when it should rightfully be
called Fermat’s equation—another Fermat’s equation!
Lagrange used the theory of continued fractions to prove that
the equation has indeed inﬁnitely many solutions in integers. He
also applied his methods to prove his famous theorem that the real
roots of quadratic equations have periodic regular continued fraction
developments, and conversely.

Here is a brief summary of some of the more relevant properties
of the solutions of X2 −DY 2 = 1 (D > 0, D not a square):
(a) Besides the trivial solutions x = ±1, y = 0, it has an inﬁnity
of solutions; moreover, there exists a solution (x1, y1) with y1 > 0,
y1 minimum possible.
(b) For every integer n ̸= 0 let xn, yn be positive integers deﬁned
by xn + yn
√
D = (x1 + y1
√
D)n; then x2
n −Dy2
n = 1.
(c) Conversely, if x, y are positive integers such that x2−Dy2 = 1,
then there exists an integer n ̸= 0 such that x = xn, y = yn.
(d) If D is square-free, then the solutions correspond to the units
x + y
√
D of Q(
√
D) having norm equal to 1. (If D ≡1 (mod 4), the
units x+y
√
D
2
with x ≡y ≡1 (mod 2) having norm 1 correspond to
the solutions of the equation X2 −DY 2 = 4).
The unit x1 + y1
√
D is called the fundamental unit of Q(
√
D).
Størmer showed in 1897 (and more simply in 1908) the following
interesting lemma:
If (xn, yn) is a solution of X2 −DY 2 = 1, with n > 1, then there
exists some prime dividing yn but not dividing D.
Størmer also proved a similar result for the equation X2−DY 2 =
−1; this was a bit easier.
Based on Størmer’s result, Nagell showed in 1921, and again
in 1924, the following divisibility criterion:
If x2 −yq = 1 (q prime, q > 3), then 2 | y and q | x. (As we shall
see, this was later generalized by Cassels).
Chao Ko’s proof of the following result appeared in two install-
ments (1960, 1964) and has now been replaced by the elegant proof
by Chein (1976):
(3.9) The equation X2−Y q = 1 has no solution in non-zero integers.
Chein’s two-page proof appeared in the American Mathematical
Monthly.

Divisibility properties
The guiding idea for the propositions in this section is to assume
that there exist non-zero integers x, y such that xp −yq = 1 and to
derive divisibility conditions which must be satisﬁed by x, y, p, q.
These conditions should be so restrictive that they would preclude
the existence of solutions. For example, Gerono showed in 1870/71:

4 Divisibility properties
191
(4.1) If q is a prime number, if qm −yn = 1 with m, n ≥2, then
q = 3, y = 2. Similarly, if p is a prime number, and if xm −pn = 1
with m, n ≥2, then p = 2, x = 3.
This fact was proved again and again, for example by Cata-
lan (1885), Carmichael (1909), Cassels (1953), and Rotkiewicz
(1960).
Obl´ath indicated in 1941 a slight extension concerning the types
of prime factors of x, y, assuming that xm −yn = 1 (with m, n ≥2).
See also Hampel (1960).
By far the most important result on divisibility conditions of hy-
pothetical solutions is due to Cassels (1960). It is very easy to
state, and at ﬁrst sight it is hard to anticipate that it plays such an
important role in the study of Catalan’s equation.
(4.2) If p, q are odd primes, x, y ≥2, and xp −yq = 1, then p | y,
q | x.
The proof uses Euler’s Lemmas 1 and 2 and delicate estimates,
but it remains strictly elementary and no appeal is made to high-
powered theorems. In a short space we cannot give any intelligible
sketch of the proof.
An immediate corollary is the solution by Ma¸kowski (1962) of
problem (III) of the Introduction; this was also done independently
by Hyyr¨o (1963).
(4.3) Three consecutive integers cannot be proper powers.
Proof.
Assuming the contrary, we have xl −yp = 1, yp −zq = 1,
where x, y, z are natural numbers and the exponents l, p, q may
be assumed primes without loss of generality. By Cassels’ theorem,
p | x, p | z, so p | xl−zq = 2. Thus xl−y2 = 1, which, by Lebesgue’s
result (3.3), is impossible.
2
We now make an aside to apply Cassels’ theorem to divisi-
bility properties of the numbers of Fermat and Ferentinou-
Nicolacopoulou.
The nth Fermat number is Fn = 22n + 1 (n ≥0), thus F0 = 3,
F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, F4 = 65537, while F5 has about 10
digits, etc.
Fermat expressed the belief, and proposed as a problem (letter of
October 18, 1640) to prove that all Fermat numbers are primes, this

192
7. Consecutive Powers
being true for Fn when n ≤4: for F5 and larger Fermat numbers,
Fermat was unable to perform explicit calculations, due to a lack
of extended tables of primes.
However, Euler showed:
If p is a prime, and p | Fn, then p = 2n+2k+1 (for some integer k).
Thus, with this criterion, for n = 5 it was enough to test the
primes congruent to 1 modulo 128. In this way, Euler deduced in
1732 that
F5 = 641 × 6700417.
Thus, we see that Fermat was wrong! But this was not only an
accident. Indeed, up to now, all other Fermat numbers investigated
are composite—in fact, they are square-free.
There is an interesting connection discovered by Rotkiewicz
(1965) and Warren and Bray (1967) with the so-called Fermat
quotient with base 2:
qp(2) = 2p−1 −1
p
.
Namely: if p | Fn, then p2 | Fn if and only if (2p−1−1)/p ≡0 (mod p),
that is, 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
The latter congruence is very rare, as we have already mentioned.
For p < 4 × 1012, we have 2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2) except when p = 1093,
3511.
Schinzel and Sierpi´nski conjectured in 1958 that there exist in-
ﬁnitely many square-free Fermat numbers. This is much weaker than
the conjecture of Eisenstein (1844) that there exist inﬁnitely many
prime Fermat numbers. If Schinzel’s conjecture is true, since distinct
Fermat numbers are relatively prime, the existence of inﬁnitely many
primes p such that 2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2) follows. And, in turn, by a
famous theorem of Wieferich (see my book, 1979), there would
exist inﬁnitely many primes p such that the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s
Last Theorem holds for the exponent p, that is:
“there do not exist integers x, y, z, not multiples of p, such
that xp + yp = zp”.
Even though Fermat’s Last Theorem has been proved by Wiles in
1994, the above connection with a special case of Fermat’s theorem
is still intriguing.

193
Deep waters!
Now we introduce the numbers of Ferentinou-Nicolacopoulou
(1963). If a ≥2, n ≥0, let
Fa,n = aan + 1.
The following result is an easy corollary of Cassels’ theorem
(Ribenboim (1979b)):
(4.4) Fa,n is not a proper power.
Proof.
If Fa,n is a proper power, we may write aan + 1 = mp
for some prime p. If q is a prime dividing a, let an = qa′, hence
mp −(aa′)q = 1, and so q | m, which is impossible.
2
In particular, Fn cannot be a proper power; this special case needs
only Lebesgue’s theorem.
Another consequence (Ribenboim (1979b)) is the following fact
which is a slight improvement over (4.1):
(4.5) If xp −yq = 1 with p, q > 3, then x, y have at least two odd
prime factors. We now focus on the sharpening of Cassels’ theorem
by Hyyr¨o and Inkeri
If p, q are primes and xp −yq = 1, from the previous results we
must have p, q > 3 and p | y, q | x. Then Euler’s Lemma 1 becomes:
x −1 = pq−1aq
xp −1
x −1 = pup
with
p ∤u, y = pau,
y + 1 = qp−1bp
yq + 1
y + 1 = qvp
with
q ∤v, x = qbv.
Hyyr¨o showed in 1964:
(4.6) With the above notations:
a = qa0 −1,
b = pb0 + 1
(with a0 ≥1, b0 ≥1)
x ≡1 −pq−1 (mod q2),
y ≡−1 + qp−1 (mod p2);
thus q2 | x if and only if pq−1 ≡(mod q2), and p2 | y if and only if
qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2).

194
7. Consecutive Powers
Thus, in particular, a ≥q −1, b ≥p+1. In view of later estimates
of x, y, Hyyr¨o showed also:
(4.7) If m > 3 is composite and xm −yq = 1 (where q is a prime,
q > 3), and if p is any prime dividing m, then pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2)
and also q2 | x.
The next result of Inkeri is quite interesting in that it establishes
a connection with the class number of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds. It
also uses an old result of Gauss on the cyclotomic polynomial.
In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, article 357 (1801), Gauss showed:
If p is an odd prime, there exist polynomials F, G ∈Z[X] such
that
4Xp −1
X −1 = F(X)2 −(−1)
p−1
2 pG(X)2.
Incidentally, this proposition was used by Gauss in the determina-
tion of the sign of the Gauss sum:
τ =
p−1

j=1
j
p

ζj =



√p
when p ≡1 (mod 4),
i√p
when p ≡3 (mod 4).
It took four years for Gauss to ﬁnd the solution of this problem.
It was not until 1805 when suddenly, “like lightning the solution ap-
peared to him” (as he stated in a letter to his friend, the astronomer
Olbers).
If p is an odd prime, let H(−p) denote the class number of the
imaginary quadratic ﬁeld Q(√−p).
Gut showed in 1963 that H(−p) < p
4 and this inequality was used
by Inkeri. It basically reﬂects the fact that H(−p) does not grow
fast, as was shown before by Siegel (1936):
log H(−p) ∼log √p.
Here is Inkeri’s result (1964):

(a) If p ≡3
(mod 4) and q ∤H(−p), then q2

(b) If p ≡q ≡3 (mod 4), p > q > 3 and q ∤H(−p), then q2 | x,
p2 | y, x ≡1 (mod p2q−1), y ≡−1 (mod q2p−1), pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2),
and qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2).

Inkeri used these divisibility conditions and congruences, to-
gether with Riesel’s tables (1964) for the residues of pq−1 modulo
q2, qp−1 modulo p2, to show, for example: among the 946 pairs of
primes (p, q) with p ̸= q, 5 ≤p, q ≤199, there are 718 pairs for
which the equation Xp −Y q = 1 has only the trivial solution.
This work was continued in two papers of Inkeri in 1990 and 1991
(one co-authored by Aaltonen). Among the many criteria in these
papers, we single out the following:
(4.9) Let p, q be distinct odd primes and assume that there exist
natural numbers x, y such that xp −yq = 1. Then
(i) If q does not divide hp (the class number of the cyclotomic ﬁeld
of pth roots of 1), then q2 | x and pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2).
(ii) If p does not divide hq (the class number of the cyclotomic
ﬁeld of qth roots of 1), then p2 | y and qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
This criterion is appropriate for computation and has been used to
show that for many pairs of distinct odd primes (p, q) the equation
xp −yq = 1 has no solution in positive integers. For example, in this
way Inkeri was able to show that x5 −y7 = ±1 has no solution in
positive integers.
Another type of result, concerning solutions (x, y) of xm −yn = 1
for which |x −y| = 1, was obtained by Hampel in 1956. More gen-
erally, and with a very easy and elegant proof, Rotkiewicz showed
in the same year:
(4.10) If a ≥1 is an integer, if gcd(x, y) = 1, |x −y| = a and
xm −yn = an, then x = 3, y = 2, m = 2, n = 3, a = 1.
The proof is based on a theorem of Bang (1886) and Zsigmondy
(1892), see Birkhoff and Vandiver (1904):
If a > b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1, for every n > 1 there exists a prime p
such that p | an −bn, but p ∤am −bm for all m, 1 ≤m < n (except
when a = 2, b = 1, n = 6, or n = 2, a −b = 2 and a + b is a prime
of 2).

In this section, we shall indicate estimates for the size and number of
solutions of Catalan’s equation, assuming that non-trivial solutions

First, given distinct integers a, b ≥2 we look for solutions in
natural numbers u, v of the equation aU −bV = 1.
Second, we consider ﬁxed exponents m, n ≥2 and examine the
possible solutions of the equation Xm −Y n = 1.
Finally, we shall consider the solutions in natural numbers of the
exponential diophantine equation XU −Y V = 1.
A.
The equation aU −bV = 1
LeVeque showed in 1952 the following result, which may also be
obtained as an easy consequence of Hampel’s result (see (4.9)):
(5.1) If a, b ≥2, then aU−bV = 1 has at most one solution in natural
numbers u, v, unless a = 3, b = 2 when there are two solutions
u = v = 1 and u = 2, v = 3.
A somewhat interesting corollary concerns the sums of successive
powers of integers:
S1(n) =
n

j=1
j = n(n + 1)

S2(n) =
n

S3(n) =

etc. . . .
More generally, Sk(n) = n
j=1 jk is given by a polynomial expres-
sion of degree k + 1, with coeﬃcients having denominator dividing
k + 1 and expressible in terms of the Bernoulli numbers—which, in-
cidentally, is irrelevant to the present purpose. As we saw above,
S3(n) = [S1(n)]2 for every n ≥1.
The corollary to LeVeque’s result is the following:
(5.2) If t ≥1 and u, v ≥2 are such that for every n ≥1: Sv(n) =
[S1(n)]u, then v = 3, t = 1, u = 2.
This holds just because the only solution in natural numbers of
2V + 1 = (2T −1)U is t = 1, u = 2, v = 3.
Let us note here that as early as 1908, Thue had obtained the
following result:

5 Estimates
197
If E = {p1, . . . , pr}, where r ≥2 and each pi is a prime number,
and if S is the set of natural numbers all of whose prime factors are
in E, then for every k ≥2 there exist at most ﬁnitely many integers
z, z′ ∈S such that z −z′ = k. In particular, if a, b ≥2, k ≥1 the
equation aU −bV = k has at most ﬁnitely many solutions in integers
u, v. This was obtained again by P´olya in 1918. In 1931, Pillai
indicated a quantitative form of this theorem, giving an upper bound
for the number of solutions in natural numbers of the inequalities 0 <
au −bv ≤k (where log b
log a is irrational). Later, in 1936, Herschfeld
showed that 2U −3V = 1 has at most one solution for each suﬃciently
large k; Pillai extended this result in 1936 for any bases a, b ≥2.
Cassels indicated in 1953 an algorithm to compute the solution
of aU −bV = 1, if one exists, giving in this way a new proof of
LeVeque’s result.
(5.3) Let a, b ≥2, and let A (respectively B) be the product of the
distinct odd primes dividing a (respectively b). If u, v ≥2 are such
that au −bv = 1, then:
(a) either a = 3, b = 2, u = 2, v = 3, or
(b) u, v are the smallest natural numbers such that au
≡
1 (mod B) and bv ≡−1 (mod A).
Thus, we need only test these values u, v as possible solutions.
B.
The equation Xm −Y n = 1
Our aim is to make statements about the number and size of solu-
tions of this equation. The proof that this equation has only ﬁnitely
many solutions may be achieved in the following ways:
(a) by showing that the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions leads
to a contradiction;
(b) by determining explicitly an integer N ≥1 such that the
number of solutions is at most equal to N;
(c) by determining explicitly some integer C ≥1 such that every
solution (x, y) must satisfy x ≤C, y ≤C. By trying all possible
natural numbers up to C, it is possible to identify all the solutions.
In case (a) there is no indication of how many, or how large the
solutions are.
In case (b), there is no indication of how large the solutions are;
thus, even if N −1 solutions are already known, nothing may be

198
7. Consecutive Powers
inferred about whether any other solution exists, or how large it
may be.
Finally, case (c) is the most satisfactory. Yet, if the constant C
provided by the method of proof is much too large—as is often the
case—it is impossible to identify all the solutions.
Our ﬁrst result is an easy consequence of a powerful and classical
theorem that goes back to Siegel (1929) and is based on ideas of
Thue about diophantine approximation.
It is convenient to use the following more explicit form of Siegel’s
theorem, indicated by Inkeri and Hyyr¨o (1964b) (see also a
relevant paper by LeVeque (1964)):
Let m, n ≥2 with max{m, n} ≥3. Let f(X) ∈Z[X] have degree n
and assume that all its zeroes are simple. If a is a non-zero integer,
then the equation f(X) = aY m has at most ﬁnitely many solutions.
In particular:
(5.4) For every natural number k, the equation Xm −Y n = k has
at most ﬁnitely many solutions.
This result may also be proved as a consequence of the following
interesting theorem of Mahler (1953):
If a, b are non-zero integers, x, y ≥1, gcd(x, y) = 1, m ≥2, n ≥3,
then the greatest prime factor of the number axm −byn tends to
inﬁnity, as max{x, y} tends to inﬁnity.
In particular, if x, y are suﬃciently large, then xm −yn cannot be
equal to k.
A more elementary proof of a special case of (5.3), due to Hyyr¨o
(1964), results from an application of a theorem of Davenport and
Roth (1955) on diophantine approximation. Without giving any
more indication of the method used, we state Hyyr¨o’s result.
(5.5) The number of solutions of Xm −Y n
= 1 is at most
exp{631m2n2}.
This upper bound is quite large, especially in light of the conjecture
that there are no solutions!
Moreover, Hyyr¨o showed:
(5.6) If p, q are primes, x, y ≥2, and xp −yq = 1, then x, y > 1011.
So, the solutions cannot be too small. Moreover, if one of the
exponents is composite, then:

5 Estimates
199
(5.7) If xm −yn = 1 and m is composite, then x > 1084, while if n
is composite, then y > 1084.
And it is even worse (or better?) when m, n are both composite:
(5.8) If xm −yn = 1 and m, n are composite, then xm, yn > 10109.
Hyyr¨o has also indicated an algorithm to ﬁnd the solutions (if
any) of Xp −Y q = 1, where p, q are primes. It involves regular
continued fraction developments. If α is a positive real number, we
deﬁne successively the integers c0, c1, c2, . . ., and the positive real
numbers α1, α2, . . . by the relations
α = c0 + 1
α1
where c0 = [α], so α1 > 1,
α1 = c1 + 1
α2
where c1 = [α1], so α2 > 1,
α2 = c2 + 1
α3
where c2 = [α2], so α3 > 1,
etc. Thus
α = c0 +
1
c1 +
1
c2 +
1
c3 + · · · + 1
cn
+···
and we write
α = [c0, c1, c2, . . . , cn, . . .].
The above fraction is called the regular continued fraction of α. We
deﬁne also
A0 = c0
A1 = c0c1 + 1
B0 = 1
B1 = c1,
and for 2 ≤i ≤n,
Ai = ciAi−1 + Ai−2,
Bi = ciBi−1 + Bi−2.

200
7. Consecutive Powers
In particular, B0 ≤B1 < B2 < B3 < · · ·.
The fractions Ai/Bi are called the convergents of α, and Ai/Bi =
[c0, c1, . . . , ci] for every i ≥0
We recall some basic properties:
(a) for every i ≥0 we have gcd(Ai, Bi) = 1,
(b) Ai/Bi ≤α if and only if i is even.
Lagrange showed in 1798:
(c) For every i ≥0,
1
Bi(Bi + Bi+1) <
α −Ai
Bi
 < 1
B2
i

(d) If a, b are non-zero integers, b ≥1, gcd(a, b) = 1, and
α −a
b
 <
1
2b2 , then there exists i ≥0 such that a = Ai, b = Bi.
Hyyr¨o’s result is the following:
(5.9) Let p, q be distinct odd primes. If there exist integers x, y ≥2
such that xp−yq = 1, they may be found by the following algorithm.
Let
α = q
p−1
p
p
q−1
q
;
consider its regular continued fraction development:
α = [c0, c1, c2, . . .].
Let Ai/Bi be the convergents. Then any solution is of the form
x = pq−1Aq
i + (−1)i,
y = qp−1Bp
i −(−1)i,
where i ≥0 is any index such that:
(i) Ai > 1, Bi > 1,
(ii) Ai ≡(−1)i+1 (mod q), Bi ≡(−1)i (mod p),
(iii) Ai ≡(−1)i qp−1−1
p

q
(mod q),
(iv) ci+1 ≥(−1)i+1Ar−2
i
, ci+1 ≥(−1)iBr−2
i
, where r = min{p, q}.
This algorithm will not determine if one non-trivial solution exists.
But, if one exists, it will eventually ﬁnd it.
In his paper, Hyyr¨o also obtained other results on Catalan’s equa-
tion as a consequence of his study of the exponential-diophantine
equation Xn −dUY n = ±1, where n ≥5, d ≥2 are given integers.
Having shown that this equation has at most one solution in
integers u, x, y, with 0 ≤u < n, x ≥2, y ≥1, he could prove:

201
(5.10) If p, q are odd primes, where m > 2, e ≥q and pe divides m,
then Xm −Y q = ±1 have no solutions in integers x ≥2, y ≥1.
(5.11) If n ≥5, a ≥2 are integers, then the exponential-diophantine
equations aU −Y n = ±1 have at most ﬁnitely many solutions in
integers.
(5.12) If a ≥2, then the exponential-diophantine equations aU −
Y V = ±1 have at most (a + 1)ν solutions in integers, where ν is the
number of distinct prime factors of a.
C.
The equation XU −Y V = 1
All the preceding is still not suﬃcient to conclude that the
exponential-diophantine equation with four unknowns XU −Y V = 1
has at most ﬁnitely many solutions. In fact, this is true and was
ﬁrst shown by Tijdeman in 1976 using Baker’s estimate for linear
forms in logarithms.
Baker applied his estimates to give eﬀective bounds for solu-
tions of various types of diophantine equations (see, for example, his
book, 1975): these results represented a deﬁnite improvement over
the previous qualitative statements obtained by Thue, Siegel, and
Roth.
(5.13) If m, n ≥3, x, y ≥1, and xm −yn = 1, then
max{x, y} < exp exp{(5n)10m10m}
and
max{x, y} < exp exp{(5m)10n10n}.
Tijdeman showed:
(5.14) There exists a number C > 0 which may be eﬀectively com-
puted, such that if x, y, m, n are natural numbers, m, n ≥2, and
xm −yn = 1, then max{x, y, m, n} < C.
Tijdeman’s result may be viewed as “settling” the problem. In-
deed, with this theorem the problem is shown to be decidable. It is
now “only” a question of trying all the 4-tuples of natural numbers
less than C. Here “only” still means too much because, as we shall
indicate, the smallest value of C thus far obtained with the present
method is much too large.

202
7. Consecutive Powers
In 1996, Langevin computed explicitly that
C < exp exp exp exp 730.
In recent years there has been considerable computational activ-
ity to enlarge the set of pairs of prime exponents (p, q) for which
xp −yq = 1 is shown to be impossible when |x|, |y| > 1. These
computations appeal to reﬁned criteria.
A leader in these eﬀorts is Mignotte who has been publishing
an extensive series of papers. We may single out his latest (still un-
published) paper which gives the state of the art. First we describe
some of the newer criteria which are of two kinds.
On the one hand, there are more speciﬁc bounds for linear forms in
logarithms. These are diﬃcult to obtain and are technically involved.
The reader may consult the papers by Bennett, Blass, Glass,
Meronk, and Steiner (1997) and by Laurent, Mignotte, and
Nesterenko (1995). These results are useful in ﬁnding upper
bounds for the exponents.
After Tijdeman’s Theorem, Langevin (1976) showed that if
xm −yn = 1 with m, n, x, y > 1, then max{m, n} < 10110.
Today it is known (O’Neil (1995)):
(5.15) If xp −yq = 1, with p, q primes, x, y > 1, then max{p, q} <
3.18 × 1017 and p or q is at most 2.60 × 1012.
On the other hand, lower bounds for the possible exponents have
been derived using criteria which are improvements of the ground-
breaking results of Inkeri already described in (4.8) and (4.9);
as stated in these references, if p ≡1 (mod 4) the latter criterion
required to ascertain whether q divides the class number hp of the
cyclotomic ﬁeld Q(ζp). It should be noted that up to now, hp has
been computed only for p < 71. The class number is the product
of the factors hp = h−
p h+
p where h+
p is the class number of the real
subﬁeld Q(ζp + ζ−1
p )—and this factor is the one that is so diﬃcult
to compute.
Some of the computational work was alleviated with the following
criterion of Mignotte and Roy (1993).
(5.16) Let p −1 = 2ds where s is an odd integer. Let K′ be the
subﬁeld of Q(ζp) having degree 2d, and let h′ be its class number. If
xp −yq = 1 with p, q prime, |x|, |y| > 1, and if p ≡1 (mod 4), then
q divides h′ or pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2).

5 Estimates
203
In 1994, Schwarz gave a criterion involving only the easier-to-
compute factor h−
p thereby implying a substantial extension of the
computations:
(5.17) With the preceding notations, either pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2) or q
divides the ﬁrst factor h−
p of the class number of K′.
In 1999, Bugeaud and Hanrot derived further necessary
requirements for the largest exponent:
(5.18) If p < q, with the above notations q divides the class
number hp of Q(ζp).
The most remarkable improvement has just been made by ailescu
(1999):
(5.19) With the previous notations, both pq−1 ≡1 (mod q2) and
qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
The amount of calculations has been drastically reduced. It should
be pointed out that the smallest pairs of primes satisfying the above
two congruences are (p, q) = (83, 4871) and (911, 318017). These
pairs have been excluded by other considerations.
WIth these criteria, Mignotte and Roy (1999) have shown:
(5.20) If xp −yq = 1 with p, q primes, x, y > 1, then p and q are
greater than 107.
Another interesting fact has just been shown by Mignotte
(2000):
(5.21) If xm −yn = ±1, with 2 ≤m < n, x, y > 1, then m is a
prime number and n admits at most two non-trivial factors.
All this having been siad, it is still true that the amount of calcu-
lation needed remains . . . (Is there a word to dwarf “astronomical”?
Invent one). . . . “Catalanic!”
In conclusion, up to now it is still not known whether 8 and 9 are
the only consecutive powers.

Final comments and applications
A simple corollary of the preceding result (5.3) is the following: Let
m, n ≥2 be distinct integers, let z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · be the sequence
of natural numbers which are either an mth power or an nth power
of a natural number. Then limi→∞(zi+1 −zi) = ∞.
For n = 2 the above result is due to Landau and Ostrowski
(1920) and for arbitrary m, n it was explicitly stated by Inkeri and
Hyyr¨o in 1964.
The main conjecture referring to powers, which may be attributed
to Pillai (1936) or Landau, is the following:
If k ≥2, there exist at most ﬁnitely many quadruples of natural
numbers x, y, m, n, with m ≥2, n ≥2, such that xm −yn = k.
This conjecture may be equivalently stated as follows:
If z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · is the sequence of powers of natural numbers,
then limi→∞(zi+1 −zi) = ∞.
Now we consider the sequence of powers of given distinct numbers
a, b ≥2 or, more generally, the sequence S of natural numbers all of
whose prime factors are in E = {p1, . . . , pr}, r ≥2, each pi a prime
number. We write
S : z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · ,
so S is the sequence (d) of the Introduction.
In 1897, Størmer showed that
lim inf
i→∞(zi+1 −zi) ≥2,
in other words, the equation X −Y = 1 has only ﬁnitely many
solutions for x, y ∈S.
Størmer has indicated a constructive method to ﬁnd all the
solutions; see also the paper by Lehmer (1964). Thue’s result of
1918, indicated after (5.1), which is however not constructive, is the
following:
lim
i→∞(zi+1 −zi) = ∞.
In 1965, Erd¨os proved that for every ϵ > 0 there exists an i0 such
that if i ≥i0, then
zi+1 −zi
zi
> 1
zϵ
i
.
In 1973 and 1974, Tijdeman showed that this result is, in a sense,
the best possible. Indeed, there exist constants C, C′, which may be

exists an i0 such that if i ≥i0, then
1
(log zi)C′ ≥zi+1 −zi

(log zi)C .
Other results along the same lines, representing the present state of
knowledge, are the following:
Let E be the set of primes less than N, and S the sequence of
numbers all or whose prime factors are less than N.
Let τ > 0. Then there exists an eﬀectively computable constant C,
depending only on N and τ, such that if m ≥2, n ≥2, x ≥2, y ≥2,
if gcd(axm, k) ≤τ, if |a|, |b|, |k| ∈S, and if
axm −byn = k,
then max{|a|, |b|, |k|, m, n, x, y} < C.
Similarly:
Let τ > 0, m ≥2. Then there exists an eﬀectively computable
constant C, depending only on N, τ and m, such that if n ≥2,
x ≥2, y ≥2, mn ≥5, if gcd(axm, k) ≤τ, if |a|, |b|, |k| ∈S and
axm −byn = k, then max{|a|, |b|, |k|, n, x, y} < C.

Shorey and Tijdeman (1986).

1093
1093! If you are wondering what this paper is all about, I hasten
to say that it is not about the quality of wines from the year 1093.
Indeed, no records exist for such a remote time. It was not until 1855
that a select group of Bordeaux wine authorities ranked the ﬁnest
vineyards in their region, distinguishing among others the outstand-
ing Chˆateaux Laﬁtte, Margaux, Latour, and Haut-Brion as Premiers
Crus in M´edoc, and Chateau Yquem in Sauternes as Premier Grand
Crus. Not to mention all the marvelous wines of Bourgogne . . . (see
Fadiman (1981)). This paper is not about wines, however.
In fact, the idea for this lecture came to me after a discussion with
F. Le Lionnais, in Paris. He is a science writer, now in his eighties,
with an acute curiosity. Just after the War, in 1946, he edited a book
Les Grands Courants de la Pens´ee Math´ematique, containing contri-
butions by eminent mathematicians like Andr´e Weil and several
other members of the Bourbaki group. The article “L’Avenir des
Math´ematiques” by Weil is worth reading, given the perspective
of the more than ﬁfty years that have elapsed. This book has been
translated into English and it is readily available. I became aware
of it shortly after its appearance and was always eager to meet Le
Lionnais.
So, it was with great pleasure that in 1976 I was introduced to him,
at a seminar on the history of mathematics. During the conversation

214
8. 1093
I learned that he was preparing a book on distinguished or important
numbers like 2, 7, π, e, etc. . . . He asked me if I knew of any numbers
with interesting properties that could be included in his book.∗After
searching, I decided on “1093” about which he had as yet heard
nothing.
My intention is to tell you why I consider 1093 an interesting
number. (Later I was glad to see that Le Lionnais included 1093 in
his book on remarkable numbers.) Of course, one could say that every
natural number is remarkable. If not, there is a smallest number N
which is not remarkable—and having this property N is certainly
remarkable . . . .
Well . . . 1093 is the smallest prime p satisfying the congruence
2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
(1)
Thus,
21092 ≡1 (mod 10932).
This was discovered by Meissner (1913) by actually doing the
calculation. According to Fermat’s Little Theorem,
2p−1 ≡1 (mod p),
(2)
but in general there is no reason to expect the stronger congru-
ence (1).
In Volume III of Landau (1927), you ﬁnd gives the following proof
of (1) for p = 1093:
37 = 2187 = 2p + 1,
so squaring
314 ≡4p + 1 (mod p2).
(3)
On the other hand,
214 = 16384 = 15p −11,
so
228 = −330p + 121 (mod p2),
hence
32 × 228 ≡−1876p −4 (mod p2)
∗In the meantime, this book has been published: F. Le Lionnais Les Nombres
Remarquables, Hermann Editeurs, Paris, 1983.

8. 1093
215
and dividing by 4,
32 × 226 ≡−469p −1 (mod p2).
Raising now to the 7th power:
314 × 2182 ≡−4p −1 (mod p2)
and taking (3) into account,
2182 ≡−1 (mod p2).
Finally, raising to the 6th power,
21092 ≡1 (mod p2).
Of course, since the congruence (1) does not hold in general, any
proof which is valid for p = 1093 has to be ad-hoc.
Beeger (1922) found that 3511 satisﬁes the congruence (1). Imag-
ine, he did his calculation in 1921, before the age of computers.
What tenacity! Even more so, since it was not known if any other
example p > 1093 would exist.
The search was continued up to 6 × 109 by D. H. Lehmer, then
by W. Keller, D. Clark, and lately by R. E. Crandall, K.
Dilcher, and C. Pomerance up to 4 × 1012 (see Crandall,
Dilcher, and Pomerance (1997)). No other prime satisfying the
congruence (1) was found.
All this is ﬁne, but why is anyone interested in the congruence (1)?
It was Abel, apparently, who asked in the third volume of Crelle’s
Journal (1828) whether it is possible to have
ap−1 ≡1 (mod pm)
(4)
with m ≥2 and p a prime not dividing a.
Jacobi, who was extremely proﬁcient in numerical computations,
gave various examples of (4):
310 ≡1 (mod 112),
74 ≡1 (mod 52),
316 ≡1 (mod 72),
and, with m = 3,
196 ≡1 (mod 73).

216
8. 1093
But the problem is not to ﬁnd examples, but to answer the
question:
Are there inﬁnitely many primes p such that 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2)?
To study this question I rephrase it in terms of the Fermat
quotient. If a ≥2, and p is a prime not dividing a, then
qp(a) = ap−1 −1
p
(5)
is an integer (by Fermat’s Little Theorem) called the Fermat quo-
tient, with base a and exponent p. Thus, qp(a) ≡0 (mod p) if and
only if ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
So, this leads to the residue modulo p of qp(a) and one is imme-
diately struck by the many interesting results linking the Fermat
quotient to various interesting arithmetical quantities. I want to
illustrate this with some examples.
The residue modulo p of qp(a) behaves like a logarithm. This fact
was noted by Eisenstein in 1850:
qp(ab) ≡qp(a) + qp(b) (mod p).
(6)
A.
Determination of the residue of qp(a)
The ﬁrst recorded result is due to Sylvester (1861a), who proved
the nice congruence:
qp(2) ≡1
2
	
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + · · · +
1
p−1
2

≡1 + 1
3 + · · · +
1
p −1 (mod p).
(7)
And more generally, for any base a:
qp(a) =
p−1

j=1
aj
j
(mod p)
(8)
where 0 ≤aj ≤p −1 and paj + j ≡0 (mod a).
In 1910, Mirimanoff showed: If p = 2r ± 1 is a prime, then
qp(2) ≡∓1/r ̸≡0 (mod p).
More recently, Johnson (1977) obtained a practical means for
determining the Fermat quotient. If r is the smallest integer such
that ar ≡±1 (mod p), letting ar ≡±1 + tp it follows that
qp(a) ≡∓t
r (mod p).

B.
Identities and congruences for the Fermat
quotient
The ﬁrst paper of substance on Fermat quotients is Lerch (1905),
and today it is almost forgotten. I am pleased to be able to bring his
nice results to your attention.
First he showed
p−1

j=1
qp(j) ≡W(p) (mod p)
(10)
where W(p) denotes the Wilson quotient. It is deﬁned in a manner
similar to the one used for the Fermat quotient. Namely, Wilson’s
theorem says that
(p −1)! ≡−1 (mod p),
(11)
hence the quotient
W(p) = (p −1)! + 1
p
(12)
is an integer, called the Wilson quotient of p. Before I return to the
Fermat quotients, let me just say that the problem of determining the
residue of W(p) modulo p is just as interesting as the corresponding
problem for the Fermat quotient. In particular, if W(p) ≡0 (mod p),
then p is called a Wilson prime. For example, p = 5, 13 are easily seen
to be Wilson primes. The search for new Wilson primes uncovered
only one more (Goldberg): p = 563, up to 4 × 1012 (Crandall,
Dilcher, and Pomerance (1997) ). The question whether there
are inﬁnitely many Wilson primes appears to be very diﬃcult. For
example, Vandiver said in 1955:
This question seems to be of such a character that if I should
come to life any time after my death and some mathematician
were to tell me it had been deﬁnitely settled, I think I would
immediately drop dead again.
Let me return to the determination of the residue of Wilson’s
quotient.
Lerch showed that
W(p) = B2(p−1) −Bp−1 (mod p).
(13)

Here Bn denotes the nth Bernoulli number, these being generated
by the function
x
ex −1 =
∞

n=0
Bn
xn
n! .
(14)
Thus, B0 = 1, B1 = −1/2, and Bn = 0 for every odd n > 1. The
Bernoulli numbers satisfy the recurrence relation:

n+1
1

Bn +

n+1

Bn−1 +

n+1
3

Bn−2 +· · ·+

n+1
n

B1 +1 = 0. (15)
This may be written symbolically as
(B + 1)n+1 −Bn+1 = 0.
(16)
(Treat B as an indeterminate and, after computing the polynomial
in the left-hand side, replace Bk by Bk.)
An important property of the Bernoulli numbers was discovered by
Euler and connects these numbers to the Riemann zeta function ζ:
B2n = (−1)n−1 2(2n)!
(2π)2n ζ(2n)
(for n ≥1)
(17)
where
ζ(s) =
∞

j=1
1
js ,
s complex, Re(s) > 1.
(18)
Using the functional equation of Riemann zeta functions, it follows
that
ζ(1 −n) = −Bn
n
(for n ≥2)
(19)
and also ζ(0) = −1
2.
Returning to Lerch’s formula (10), the point is the following: Since
the Fermat quotient is somehow hard to compute, it is more natural
to relate their sum, over all the residue classes, to quantities deﬁned
by p.
This has also been done for weighted sums. In a letter of 1909 to
Hensel, Friedmann and Tamarkine proved: If 1 ≤n ≤p −1,
then
p−1

j=1
jnqp(j) ≡(−1)[n/2] Bn
n
(mod p).
(20)

8. 1093
219
From (19), it follows that if 2 ≤n ≤p −1, then
p−1

j=1
jnqp(j) ≡(−1)[(n−2)/2]ζ(1 −n) (mod p)
(21)
and also

Another nice relation involves the distribution of quadratic
residues, and the class number of quadratic ﬁelds.
Let H(a) denote the class number of the quadratic ﬁeld Q(√a)

It is known that ρ > ρ′ when p ≡3 (mod 4). This is a diﬃcult
theorem. The only proofs now known require analysis, in spite of its
purely arithmetical nature.

Let me now turn to a theorem which has sparked interest in Fermat
quotients and opened up new areas of research.
The following results have historical importance. They have not
completely lost their interest with the proof of Fermat’s Last
Theorem by Wiles, since the methods are applicable to similar
diophantine equations, for example, to Catalan’s equation
Xm −Y n = 1.
(29)
In 1909, Wieferich proved: Suppose that there exist integers x,
y, z, not multiples of the odd prime p such that xp + yp + zp = 0
(that is, the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last Theorem fails for p). Then
2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2).
Hence, by what I said in the beginning of this chapter, the ﬁrst
case of Fermat’s Last Theorem (= FLT ) is true for every prime
exponent p < 4 × 1012, except, possibly, for p = 1093, and 3511.
The proof of Wieferich was very diﬃcult and technical. It was
based on the following deep result of Kummer: If the ﬁrst case of
FLT fails for the exponent p, with xp + yp + zp = 0, and p not
dividing xyz, then
 
d2s log(x + evy)
dv2s
!
× B2s ≡0 (mod p)
(30)
for 2s = 2, 4, . . . , p −3 (and similar congruences for the pairs (y, x),
(y, z), (z, y), (x, z), (z, x)).

8. 1093
221
Moreover, Wieferich used complicated congruences that are sat-
isﬁed by the Bernoulli numbers. In 1912, Furtw¨angler found
another proof of Wieferich’s theorem, using class ﬁeld theory—a
further conﬁrmation of the power of class ﬁeld theory. The theo-
rem of Wieferich was the ﬁrst of a series of criteria involving Fermat
quotients.
Mirimanoff showed in 1910:
If the ﬁrst case of FLT fails for the exponent p, then qp(3) ≡
0 (mod p).
Since p = 1093, 3511 do not satisfy the above congruence, then this
establishes the ﬁrst case for the range of primes less than 4 × 1012.
This work was continued by Frobenius, Vandiver, Pollaczek,
Rosser, and, more recently, by Granville and Monagan. With
this method, it was proved that if the ﬁrst case fails for p, then
qp(ℓ) ≡0 (mod p)
for ℓprime, ℓ≤89.
(31)
A corollary worth mentioning is the following one, due to Spunar:
Let p be an odd prime satisfying the following property (P89):
There exists k not a multiple of p such that kp = a ± b where
all prime factors of a, b are at most equal to 89.
Then the ﬁrst case of FLT holds for the exponent p.
The proof is actually so simple that I will give it now.
If the ﬁrst case fails for the exponent p, then for every prime ℓ,
ℓ≤89, it follows that ℓp−1 ≡1 (mod p2), by formula (31). So ap−1 ≡
1 (mod p2) and bp−1 ≡1 (mod p2). Hence, ap ≡a (mod p2) and
bp ≡b (mod p2). But a = ∓b + kp, so ap ≡∓bp (mod p2). From
kp = a ± b ≡ap ± bp ≡0 (mod p2) it follows that p divides k,
contrary to the hypothesis.
In this connection, there is the following open problem:
Are there inﬁnitely many primes p with property (P89)?
Puccioni showed in 1968: If the above set is ﬁnite, then for every
prime ℓ, ℓ≤89, ℓ̸≡1 (mod 8), the set Mℓ−{p | ℓp−1 ≡1 (mod p2)}
is inﬁnite.
Unfortunately, this theorem may mean nothing since both sets in
question, sparse as they seem to be, may turn out to be inﬁnite.
A corollary of Spunar’s result, already given by Mirimanoff, is
the following one:
The ﬁrst case of FLT holds for the prime exponents p of the form
p = 2m ± 1.

222
8. 1093
It is an easy exercise to show:
If 2m + 1 is a prime number, then m = 2n (n ≥0). The numbers
Fn = 22n + 1
were ﬁrst considered by Fermat, and are now called Fermat
numbers.
Similarly, if 2m −1 is a prime number, then m = p is a prime. The
numbers
Mp = 2p −1
(p prime)
are called the Mersenne numbers.
Fermat believed that all Fermat numbers are primes. Indeed,
F1 = 5,
F2 = 17,
F2 = 257,
F4 = 65537.
F5 is much larger, with about 10 digits.
Euler proved in 1747 the following criterion: If p divides Fn (n ≥
2), then p = 2n+1k + 1 (with k ≥1).
He applied this criterion to F5 and found that 641 divides F5, so
therefore F5 is not a prime number.
This can also be seen in the following way:
641 = 24 + 54 = 5 × 27 + 1,
232 = 24 × 228 = (641 −54) × 228
= 641 × 228 −(5 × 27)4
= 641 × 228 −(641 −1)4 ≡−1 (mod 641).
So, 641 divides 232 −1 = F5.
The study of the Fermat numbers and Mersenne numbers led to
the discovery of the ﬁrst primality tests for large numbers.
The ﬁrst criterion was devised by Lucas in the form of a converse
of Fermat’s Little Theorem:
Let n ≥3 be odd and assume that there exists a, 1 < a < n, such
that
ap−1 ≡1 (mod n),
and if q is any prime dividing n −1, then
a
n−1
q
̸≡−1 (mod n).
Then n is a prime.

8. 1093
223
Based on such criterion Pepin showed:
The Fermat number Fn is a prime if and only if
3
Fn−1
2
≡−1 (mod Fn).
There has been an extensive search for Fermat primes. Accord-
ing to my information, which may already be outdated, the largest
Fermat number tested is F303088 (composite). It usually takes long
calculations to decide if a Fermat number is composite.
Contrary to Fermat’s belief, the only known Fermat primes are
the ones he already knew!
The following conjectures are weaker than Fermat’s original
assertion:
(a) Eisenstein (1844): there are inﬁnitely many Fermat primes;
(b) Schinzel (1963): there exist inﬁnitely many Fermat numbers
which are square-free (i.e., products of distinct primes).
For the Mersenne numbers, Euler gave the ﬁrst test for factors:
If p is a prime, p > 3, p ≡3 (mod 4), then 2p + 1 divides Mp if and
only if 2p + 1 is a prime.
In this way, Euler concluded that 23 divides M11; . . .; 503 divides
M251, etc. . . .
The problem becomes the determination of primes p such that
2p+1 is again a prime. Such primes are justly called Sophie Germain
primes. They were ﬁrst considered around 1820 when she proved the
following beautiful theorem, which was of a totally new nature:
If p and 2p + 1 are primes, then the ﬁrst case of FLT is true for
the exponent p.
An open question is: Are there inﬁnitely many Sophie Germain
primes?
Compare this question with the following one (the twin prime
problem):
Are there inﬁnitely many primes p such that p+2 is also a prime?
In both cases there are linear polynomials 2X + 1, X + 2 respec-
tively, and the question is whether they inﬁnitely often assume prime
values at primes.
Let me now describe a very eﬀective primality test for Fermat and
Mersenne numbers, devised by Lucas in 1878. It uses second order
linear recurrences, more speciﬁcally, Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.
In the thirteenth century, Fibonacci considered the sequence of
numbers F0 = 0, F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2, F4 = 3, F5 = 5, F6 = 8,

224
8. 1093
. . . , and, more generally,
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2.
(I hope no confusion with the Fermat numbers will arise.)
The Fibonacci numbers have a wealth of arithmetic properties.
Books have been written about them, and a quarterly journal has
these numbers as its main topic.
A companion sequence is the one of Lucas numbers: L0 = 2, L1 =
1, L2 = 3, L3 = 4, L4 = 7, L5 = 11, . . . , and Ln = Ln−1 + Ln−2, for
n ≥2.
More generally, given the numbers U0, U1, and α, β ∈Q, let
Un = αUn−1 −βUn−2.
(32)
The equation X2 −αX + β = 0 has roots
a = α +
,
α2 −4β
2
,
b = α −
,
α2 −4β
2
,
so
α = a + b, β = ab
and
Un = (a + b)Un−1 −abUn−2.
(33)
For Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, α = 1, β = −1, so
a = 1 +
√
5
2
(the “Golden ratio”),
b = 1 −
√
5
2
.
Binet’s formula gives
Un = an −bn
a −b .
(34)
The sequence companion is
Vn = an + bn.
(35)
Putting
Wn = V2n−1
Q2n−2
(for n ≥2),
(36)
so,
W1 = α2 −2β
β
,
Wn+1 = W 2
n −2.
(37)

8. 1093
225
With appropriate choices of α, β, Lucas obtained the useful
“testing sequence”:
If p ≡1 (mod 4), let W2 = −4, Wn+1 = W 2
n −2, so the sequence
is −4, 14, 194, . . . .
His criterion is:
Mp = 2p −1 is a prime if and only if Mp divides Wp.
If p ≡3 (mod 4), p > 3, let W2 = −3, Wn+1 = W 2
n −2, so the
sequence is −3, 7, 47, . . . .
His criterion in this case is again: Mp = 2p −1 is a prime if and
only if Mp divides Wp.
This is the method which is at present used in testing the primality
of Mersenne numbers.
In 1944, Mersenne knew that for p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, Mp
is a Mersenne prime.
In 1878, Lucas showed that if p = 61, 89, 107, 127, then Mp is also
a Mersenne prime.
With the advent of computers, we now know 37 Mersenne primes,
the largest ones being M3021377 with 909526 digits, and M2976221
which has 895932 digits.
Schinzel conjectured the following:
There exist inﬁnitely many square-free Mersenne numbers. To
date, no Fermat or Mersenne number with a square factor has ever
been found.
In 1965, Rotkiewicz took up the above conjecture and showed:
If Schinzel’s conjecture on Mersenne numbers is true, there exist
inﬁnitely many primes p such that
2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2).
By the way, Rotkiewicz made use of the following interesting,
(and many times rediscovered) theorem of Zsigmondy (1892):
If n ̸= 6, n ≥3, a ≥2, then there exists a prime p such that the
order of a modulo p is equal to n. Equivalently, there exists a prime p
such that p divides an −1, but p does not divide am −1 for m < n.
This theorem was discovered by Zsigmondy (earlier by Bang
for a = 2), Birkhoff and Vandiver, Dickson, Carmichael,
Kanold, Artin, Hering, L¨uneburg, Pomerance, and . . . who
else? I would like to know.
From the Rotkiewicz theorem it follows that there is rather surpris-
ing, and I dare say, deep, connection between such dissimilar topics
as Fermat’s Last Theorem, the congruence 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2), and

226
8. 1093
the factorization of Mersenne numbers. But, I have been digressing
from the main question.
There is a heuristic reason to believe that there exist inﬁnitely
many primes p such that 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2). The argument is as
follows. Since nothing to the contrary is known, it may be assumed
(heuristically) that for each prime p the probability that 2p−1−1
p
≡
0 (mod p) is just 1
p since there are p residue classes modulo p. If x
is any large positive real number, then the number of primes p ≤x
with 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2) should be

p≤x
1
p = log log x + error term.
So there would exist inﬁnitely many p satisfying the above congru-
ence. However, this argument cannot be made rigorous. From the
calculations, apart from two exceptions, 2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2), so it
should be expected that there are inﬁnitely many primes p satisfy-
ing 2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2). This has not yet been proved, but it follows
from the important and interesting (ABC) conjecture of Masser
and Oesterl´e:
For each ϵ > 0 there exists a real number K(ϵ) > 0 such that
for any positive integers A, B, and C with gcd(A, B, C) = 1, and
A + B = C, then
C ≤K(ϵ)r1+ϵ
where r (the radical of ABC) is the product of the distinct prime
factors of ABC.
For example, if ϵ = 1
2, and if A = 2m, B = 3n (with m and n
large), and C = Am +Bn, then from C < K(1
2)r3/2 and r = 6 
p|C p
it follows that C must have large radical.
Silverman (1988) proved:
If the (ABC) conjecture is assumed true, then there exists inﬁnitely
many primes p such that 2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2).
It would be of the greatest importance to prove this conjecture.
The number 1093 is indeed interesting after all . . . .

Powerless Facing Powers
I gave this lecture many times in many countries. Can you guess who
came to listen to it?
Political scientists! Third-world countries facing the big powers?
And powerless Paulo would tell how to resist or to become one of
them . . . .
No, I am just a mathematician not knowing how to solve many
problems involving powers of integers or the so-called powerful
numbers.
My intention is to present several problems of this kind, in a few
cases, to advance conjectures of what should be true.
The following notations will be used. If S is a ﬁnite set, #S denotes
the number of elements of S. If S is a set of positive integers, and
x ≥1, let S(x) = {s ∈S | s ≤x}.
The integers of the form an, where |a| > 1, n > 1, are said to be
powers. Thus, 1 is not a power.

Powerful numbers
The ﬁrst paper about powerful numbers was by Erd¨os (1935); how-
ever, the name “powerful number” was coined later by Golomb
(1970).

230
9. Powerless Facing Powers
Let k ≥2. The natural number n ≥1 is said to be a k-
powerful number when the following property is satisﬁed: if a prime p
divides n, then pk also divides n.
In other words, the k-powerful numbers are exactly the inte-
gers which may be written in the form ak
0ak+1
1
· · · a2k−1
k−1
(where a0,
. . . , ak−1 are positive integers that may not be coprime). A 2-
powerful number is simply called a powerful number. In particular,
powerful numbers are those of the form a2
0a3
1, with a0, a1 ≥1. We
note that 1 is a powerful number. I shall denote by Wk the set of
k-powerful numbers.
The main problems about powerful numbers are of the following
kinds:
1. Distribution of powerful numbers.
2. Additive problems.
3. Diﬀerence problems.
A.
Distribution of powerful numbers
The aim is to estimate the number of elements in the set
Wk(x) = {n ∈Wk | 1 ≤n ≤x},
(1)
where x ≥1, k ≥2.
Already in 1935, Erd¨os and Szekeres gave the ﬁrst result
about W2(x):
#W2(x) = ζ(3
2)
ζ(3) x1/2 + O(x1/3)
as x →∞,
(2)
where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function; see also Bateman (1954)
and Golomb (1970).
To describe the more recent results, I introduce the zeta function
associated to the sequence of k-powerful numbers. Let
jk(n) =



1
if n is k-powerful,
0
otherwise.
The series ∞
n=1
jk(n)
ns
is convergent for Re(s) > 1
k and deﬁnes a
function Fk(s). This function admits the following Euler product

(3)
which is valid for Re(s) > 1
k.
With well-known methods, Ivi´c and Shiu showed in 1982:
(1.1) #Wk(x) = γ0,kx
1
k + γ1,kx
1
k+1 + · · · + γk−1,kx
1
2k−1 + ∆k(x),
where γi,k is the residue at
1

s
.
Explicitly,
γi,k = Ck+i,k
Φk( 1

(5)
Φ2(s) = 1, and if k > 2, then Φk(s) has a Dirichlet series with
abscissa of absolute convergence
1
2k+3, and ∆k(x) is the error term.
Erd¨os and Szekeres had already considered this error term and
showed that
∆k(x) = O(x
1
k+1 )
as x →∞.
(6)
Better estimates of the error have since been obtained. Let
ρk = inf{ρ > 0 | ∆k(x) = O(xρ)}.
Bateman and Grosswald showed in 1958 that ρ2 ≤1
6 and ρ3 ≤7
46.
Sharper results are due to Ivi´c and Shiu:
ρ2 ≤0.128 < 1
6,
ρ3 ≤0.128 < 7
46,
ρ4 ≤0.1189,
ρ5 ≤1
10,
ρ6 ≤1
12,
ρ7 ≤1
14,
etc.
I refer also to the work of Kr¨atzel (1972) on this matter.
It is conjectured that, for every k ≥3,
∆k(x) = O(x
1
2k )
for x →∞.


i=1
ni | each ni ∈Wk ∪{0}},

hWk(x) = {n ∈

hWk | n ≤x}
(for x ≥1).
The additive problems concern the comparison of the sets  hWk
with the set of natural numbers, the distribution of the sets  hWk,
and similar questions.
The distribution of  2W2 was treated by Erd¨os in 1975:

(as x →∞), where 0 < α < 1

In particular, #  2W2(x) = o(x), so there exist inﬁnitely many
natural numbers which are not the sum of two powerful numbers.
Odoni showed in 1981 that there is no constant C > 0 such that
#

2W2(x) ∼

(as x →∞).
The following result was conjectured by Erd¨os and Ivi´c in
the 1970’s and proved by Heath-Brown (1988):
(1.3) There is an eﬀectively computable number n0, such that every
n ≥n0 is the sum of at most three powerful numbers.
The only known exceptions up to 32000 are 7, 15, 23, 87, 111,
and 119. Mollin and Walsh conjectured in 1986 that there are no
other exceptions.
The following problem concerning 3-powerful numbers remains
open:
Do there exist inﬁnitely many natural numbers which are not sums
of three 3-powerful numbers? Probably, yes.

Diﬀerence problems
The problems of this kind are the following.
Problem D1. Given k ≥2, determine which numbers N are of the
form N = n1 −n2, where n1, n2 ∈Wk. Such an expression of N
is called a representation as a diﬀerence of k-powerful numbers, or
simply a k-powerful representation. When k = 2, I simply say a
powerful representation. If gcd(n1, n2) = 1, the representation is
called primitive; if n1 or n2 is a power, or 1, the representation is
called degenerate.
Problem D2. Given k ≥2, N ≥1, determine the set, or just the
number of representations (primitive or not, degenerate or not) of N
as a diﬀerence of k-powerful numbers.
In the same vein is the following problem:
Problem D3. Given integers N1, N2 ≥1, determine if there exist
k-powerful numbers n1, n2, n3 such that
n2 −n1 = N1
and
n3 −n2 = N2.
In such a case, study the possible triples of such numbers.
One may also think of similar problems with several diﬀerences N1,
N2, . . ., Nr ≥1 given in advance, but as I shall indicate, problem D3
in its simplest formulation is unsolved and certainly very diﬃcult.
I begin by discussing problems D1 and D2. The ﬁrst remark, due
to Mahler, also shows that these questions are in close relationship
to the equations X2 −DY 2 = C.
Thus, Mahler said: since the equation X2−8Y 2 = 1 has inﬁnitely
many solutions in integers (x, y), and since the number 8y2 is pow-
erful, then 1 admits inﬁnitely many degenerate (primitive) powerful
representations.
In 1976, Walker showed that 1 also has an inﬁnite number of
non-degenerate powerful (primitive) representations.
In 1981, Sentance showed that 2 has inﬁnitely many primitive
degenerate powerful representations, the smallest ones being:
2 = 27 −25 = 70227 −70225 = 189750627 −189750625.
More recently, putting together the results in various papers,
published independently and almost simultaneously by McDaniel,
Mollin and Walsh, and Vanden Eynden, it has been established
that:

234
9. Powerless Facing Powers
(1.4) Every natural number has inﬁnitely many primitive degen-
erate powerful representations and also inﬁnitely many primitive
non-degenerate powerful representations.
Moreover, there is an algorithm to determine such representations.
For a survey of the above results, see also Mollin (1987).
It has been asked by Erd¨os whether consecutive powerful num-
bers may be obtained other than as solutions of appropriate
equations EX2 −DY 2 = 1.
Concerning the distribution of pairs of consecutive powerful
numbers, there are several conjectures by Erd¨os (1976).
First* Erd¨os conjecture:
#{n | n and n + 1 are powerful, n ≤x} < (log x)c, where c > 0 is a
constant.
It is not even yet proved that c′x
1
3 is an upper bound (with a
constant c′ > 0).
Second Erd¨os conjecture:
There do not exist two consecutive 3-powerful numbers.
It is interesting to note that the only known examples of consecu-
tive integers, such that one is 2-powerful and the other is 3-powerful,
are (8, 9) and (12167, 12168).
A related conjecture is the following:
Third Erd¨os conjecture:
Let a1 < a2 < a3 < · · · be the sequence of 3-powerful numbers. There
exist constants c > 0, c′ > 0, such that for every suﬃciently large m,
am+1 −am > cmc′.
In particular,
lim
m→∞(am+1 −am) = ∞.
Fourth Erd¨os conjecture:
There are inﬁnitely many 3-powerful numbers which are sums of two
3-powerful numbers.
Now I consider problem D3 in its simplest form, which concerns
three consecutive powerful numbers.
*No one can state which was Erd¨os’ ﬁrst-conjecture—I would not be
surprised if it was his ﬁrst meaningful sentence, as a child. . . .

2 Powers
235
With his awesome insight, Erd¨os conjectured:
Fifth Erd¨os conjecture:
There do not exist three consecutive powerful numbers.
This goes beyond the fact, proved by Makowski (1962) and
independently by Hyyr¨o (1963), that there do not exist three
consecutive powers.
Of these, only the fourth conjecture has been established. In 1995,
Nitaj proved that there are inﬁnitely many 3-powerful numbers
which are sums x + y, where x is a cube and y is a 3-powerful num-
ber. In 1998, Cohn proved, more speciﬁcally, that there are inﬁnitely
many 3-powerful numbers which are sums x + y, where x and y are
both 3-powerful numbers which are not cubes.
Later in this chapter I shall say more about the second, third, and
ﬁfth conjectures. These are diﬃcult problems and calculations could
only be of use to ﬁnd three consecutive powerful numbers—if they
exist. But when should the calculations be stopped, since no bounds
are available?
It is very unexpected and intriguing that the existence of three con-
secutive powerful numbers has a relation to Fermat’s Last Theorem.
I shall discuss this later in this chapter.

Powers
I shall discuss whether a sum of two or more powers may be a
power; if so, how often. A more demanding problem requires that
the exponents in these powers be the same.
A.
Pythagorean triples and Fermat’s problem
It is well-known that there are inﬁnitely many primitive Pythagorean
triples of integers (x, y, z) with 0 < x, y, z, gcd(x, y) = 1, y even, and
x2 + y2 = z2. All these triples are parameterized as follows:
x = a2 −b2
y = 2ab
z = a2 + b2
where 1 ≤b < a, with gcd(a, b) = 1.

236
9. Powerless Facing Powers
In this respect, the following problem remains open: are there in-
ﬁnitely many Pythagorean triples (x, y, z) such that x and y are
primes? This question has been treated assuming the truth of the
conjecture of Bouniakowski (1857), which is very strong.
An irreducible polynomial f ∈Z[X] is said to be strongly primitive
when there is no prime p such that p divides f(k) for every integer k.
In particular, the greatest common divisor of the coeﬃcients of f is
equal to 1.
The conjecture of Bouniakowsky is the following:
If f ∈Z[X] is any irreducible strongly primitive polynomial, then
there exist inﬁnitely many integers n such that |f(n)| is a prime.
Note that if f(X) has degree 1, then f(X) = aX + b with
gcd(a, b) = 1, and the above conjecture is true—it is the theorem
of Dirichlet on primes in arithmetical progressions.
In 1958, Schinzel and Sierpi´nski reformulated this and other
conjectures and derived many consequences of the above conjecture.
In particular, they showed:
(2.1) Assume that the conjecture of Bouniakowsky is true. Let
a, b, c, and d be integers with a > 0, d > 0, b2 −4ac ̸= 0. Assume
that there exist integers x0, y0 such that ax2
0 + bx0 + c = dy0. Then
there exist inﬁnitely many pairs (p, q) of prime numbers such that
ap2 + bp + c = dq.
Now it is easy to show:
(2.2) Every positive rational number a/b ̸= 1 (a > 0, b > 0,
gcd(a, b) = 1) may be written in inﬁnitely many ways in the form
a
b = p2−1
q−1 , where p and q are prime numbers.
Proof.
Indeed, the equation bX2 −(b −a) = aY has the solution
(x0, y0) = (1, 1). Note that if b > 0, a > 0, then 4b(b −a) ̸= 0.
By (2.1), there exist inﬁnitely many pairs (p, q) of prime numbers
such that bp2 −(b −a) = aq, hence
a
b = p2 −1
q −1 .
2
Applying (2.2) with the rational number 2 gives:

2 Powers
237
(2.3) If the conjecture of Bouniakowsky is true, there exist in-
ﬁnitely many Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) where a and c are prime
numbers.
Proof.
By (2.2), there exist inﬁnitely many pairs (p, q) with p, q
primes, such that 2 = p2−1
q−1 . Then p2 = 2q −1. Hence, p2 +(q −1)2 =
q2, so (p, q −1, q) is a Pythagorean triple.
2
Of course, what is diﬃcult is to prove the conjecture of Bou-
niakowsky. For the consequences of this conjecture see also my
book Ribenboim (1996).
Now I turn my attention to Fermat’s Last Theorem. If n > 2,
Wiles proved in 1995 that if an + bn = cn, then abc = 0. This was
the long sought solution of Fermat’s problem. Among the numer-
ous partial results that were obtained before the complete proof by
Wiles, I want to mention just two, which are connected with the
present discussion.
It has been traditional to say that the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last
Theorem is true for the prime exponent p when there do not exist
integers a, b, and c not multiples of p, such that ap + bp = cp.
In 1909, Wieferich proved
(2.4) If p is an odd prime such that
2p−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2),
(1)
then the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last Theorem is true for p.
As I mentioned in my book 13 Lectures on Fermat’s Last The-
orem (1979, second edition 1995), the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last
Theorem is true for p if there exists a prime l ≤89 such that
lp−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2)
(2)
(see, in particular, Granville (1988)).
In 1985, Adleman, Heath-Brown, and Fouvry proved:
(2.5) There exist inﬁnitely many prime exponents p for which the
ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last Theorem is true.
However, the method of proof did not allow the determination of any
of these prime exponents p explicitly.

Variants of Fermat’s problem
It is easy to formulate variants of Fermat’s problem.
a
The twisted Fermat’s problem
Let A, B, C > 0, gcd(A, B, C) = 1 be given integers; let n ≥3. The
problem is to determine all solutions in integers of the equation
AXn + BY n = CZn.
(3)
For n > 3 the curve with the above equation has genus greater
than 1, so by the powerful theorem of Faltings (1983) (proof of
Mordell’s conjecture), there exist only ﬁnitely many solutions, i.e.,
triples (x, y, z) of pairwise relatively prime integers, which satisfy
the given equations. Often, such equations may have easily-detected
trivial solutions which are ﬁnite in number.
For each N > 1, let S(N) denote the set of all exponents n ≤N
for which the equation (3) have only the trivial solutions.
It has been shown (see Granville (1985b), Heath-Brown
(1985)) that:
(2.6) With the above notations,
lim
N→∞
#S(N)
N
= 1.
In words, for “almost all” exponents n, the twisted Fermat equations
(for each triple (A, B, C)) has only trivial solutions.
Nevertheless, there is presently no criterion to tell if for arbitrary
A, B, C, and n, the twisted Fermat equation has only trivial solu-
tions. Also, there is no theorem giving an upper bound for the size
of the integers x, y, z that might be solutions of the twisted Fermat
equation.

Homework
In a recent paper (1999) that I titled Homework (and that aimed at
making my colleagues work hard, now that I am retired), I stated
the following conjecture:
(2.7) Let d ≥1. Then there exists a natural number n0(d) such that
if K is any number ﬁeld of degree at most d and if n ≥n0(d), then
the equation Xn + Y n = Zn has only trivial solutions in K.

2 Powers
239
Here a trivial solution in K is any triple (x, y, z) with x, y, z ∈K
and xyz = 0, and, if K contains a primitive sixth root of 1, any
triple (a, aζ2, aζ) or their permutations, where a is any non-zero
element of K. (In the case when such a triple is a solution, then
n ≡±1 (mod 6).)
For d = 1, taking n0(1) = 3, the conjecture is no more than
Fermat’s Last Theorem, which was proved recently. It is also conjec-
tured that n0(2) = 5. In this respect I note: There are inﬁnitely many
quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
D) (D not a square) such that X3 + Y 3 = Z3
has nontrivial solutions in Q(
√
D).
The quartic equation X4 + Y 4 = Z4 has nontrivial solutions in
Q(
√
D) if and only if D = −7; for more on these results, consult
Ribenboim (1979). For p = 5, 7, 11, the equation Xp + Y p = Zp
has only trivial solutions in any quadratic ﬁeld (see Gross and
R¨ohrlich (1978)). No more is known when p > 11.
Here is a diﬀerent, but related, problem:
Let n ≥3. How large can d be so that there exist only ﬁnitely
many ﬁelds K of degree at most d such that Xn + Y n = Zn has a
nontrivial solution in K?
C.
The conjecture of Euler
Euler proved that a (non-zero) cube is not the sum of two cubes
(diﬀerent from zero).
In 1769, Euler conjectured, for each k > 3: A non-zero kth power
is not equal to the sum of k −1 non-zero kth powers.
However, a counterexample was given by Lander and Parkin
in 1966, for k = 5:
1445 = 275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335.
This was found by computer search, and, as far as I know, is the
only example for 5th powers.
In 1988, Elkies gave a parametrized inﬁnite family of triples of
coprime 4th powers whose sum is a 4th power. The smallest example
was
206156734 = 26824404 + 153656394 + 187967604.
These examples were obtained using the arithmetic theory of elliptic
curves.
It is conceivable that for every k > 5 there are also counterexam-
ples to the conjecture of Euler.

240
9. Powerless Facing Powers
I wish to formulate a problem. Let k ≥3 and deﬁne v(k) to be the
minimum of the integers m > 1 such that there exists a kth power
which is the sum of m natural numbers which are kth powers or 1. By
Fermat’s Last Theorem, v(k) > 2. The problem is the determination
of v(k). Since 33 + 43 + 53 = 63, then v(3) = 3.
From Elkies’ example, v(4) = 3. From Lander and Parkin’s
example, v(5) ≤4. It is not known if there exists a 5th power which
is the sum of three 5th powers.
Clearly, v(k) ≤2k since 2k is the sum of 2k integers all equal to 1.
There is no experimental supporting evidence to suggest any conjec-
ture about v(k). Equivalently, nothing is known about the existence
of rational points in hypersurfaces n
i=1 xk
i = 1. This is another
instance supporting the title chosen for this lecture.

n < 1, the equation (4) has only ﬁnitely many
solutions in non-zero coprime integers (x, y, z).
The case when A = B = C = 1 was the object of more scrutiny.
Only ten solutions are known (in the hyperbolic case):
1l + 23 = 32,
25 + 72 = 34,

438 + 962223 = 300429072,
338 + 15490342 = 156133.
These relations appear in the paper of Beukers (1988). It may be
observed that in each case, one of the exponents is equal to 2. Must
it be so?
The theorem (2.8) does not indicate when the equation has only
trivial solutions. In this direction, I shall give a density theorem.
Let k ≥1 and let S be a set of k-tuples of natural numbers. For
each N ≥1 let
S(N) = {(a1, . . . , ak) ∈S | 1 ≤a1, . . . , ak ≤N}.
Thus, S(N) has at most Nk elements.
The number
δ(S) = lim inf #S(N)
Nk
(5)
is the lower asymptotic density of S; the number
¯δ(S) = lim sup #S(N)
Nk
(6)
is the upper asymptotic density of S. If the upper and lower asymp-
totic densities coincide, they are simply denoted by δ(S) and this
number is called the asymptotic density of S.
Let S = {(l, m, n) | 2 ≤l, m, n and the equation (4) has only
trivial solutions}. Together with Powell, I proved in 1985:
δ(S) = lim inf #S(N)

This is, of course, a weak result even though its proof uses in an

In 1993, I proved other density results. For deﬁniteness, I shall
consider speciﬁcally the equation
Xl + Y m = Zn

with l, m, n ≥2.
For each n ≥2 let Dn = {(l, m) | equation (7) has only trivial
solutions}. Then (see Ribenboim (1993)):
(2.9) (a) The set {n | Dn ̸= ∅} has density 1. (b) The set {n |
δ(Dn) = 0} has density 0.
In words, for almost all n, there is an nth power which is a sum of two
powers, and for almost all n there is a positive proportion of (l, m)
such that an lth power plus an mth power is not an nth power. These
statements give an indication of the little that is known.
Recent work with the method developed by Wiles has led to the
following results (Ribet 19?? and Darmon and Merel (1997)) for
very special equations.
(2.10) (a) If n ≥3, then Xn + Y n = 2Zn has only trivial solutions
(in integers with absolute value at most 1).
(b) If n is odd and n ≥3, then Xn + Y n = Z2 has only trivial
solutions.
(c) If n ≥3, the equation Xn +Y n = Z3 has only trivial solutions.
These statements were proved using the important, and now
celebrated, Theorem of Wiles (1995, see also Taylor (1995)):
The conjecture of Shimura and Taniyama is true for semi-stable
elliptic curves deﬁned over Q, that is, every such curve is a modular
elliptic curve.
I shall say no more about it, but the reader may wish to consult
the expository article by Kraus (1999).

there are only the following possibilities (up to permutation):
(l, m, n) ∈{(2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 4), (3, 3, 3)}.
In this case, equation (4) may be dealt with by the theory of elliptic
curves. This will not be discussed here.

In 1998, Beukers published a theorem about equation (4) in the
spherical case. To ﬁx the terminology, the homogeneous polynomials
f, g, h ∈Z[X, Y ] furnish a parametric family of solutions of (4) when
Afl + Bgm = Chn.
Thus, for all pairs of integers (s, t),
Af(s, t)l + Bg(s, t)m = Ch(s, t)n,
so (f(s, t), g(s, t), h(s, t)) are solutions, for all choices of s, t.
Beukers proved:
(2.11) The set of solutions of (4) in the spherical case consists of
ﬁnitely many families of parametrized solutions. If the equation has
one nontrivial solution, then it has inﬁnitely many solutions.
The result for the Pythagorean equation was already described and
has been known for a very long time.
Zagier determined the solutions for the equations X3 + Y 3 =
Z2, X4 + Y 3 = Z2, and X4 + Y 2 = Z3, and these are included in

Powers as values of polynomials
The question treated now is the following: How often does a poly-
nomial f ∈Z[X] have values which are powers? Of course, the
question is only interesting when f itself is not the power of another
polynomial.
The following important and useful theorem was proved by
Schinzel and Tijdeman in 1976 and holds for polynomials with
rational coeﬃcients:
(2.12) Let f ∈Q[X] and assume that f has at least 3 simple roots
(respectively, 2 simple roots). Then there exists an eﬀectively com-
putable constant C > 0 (depending on f) such that if x, y, h are
integers with y ≥2, h ≥2 (respectively, h ≥3) and f(x) = yh, then
|x|, y, h ≤C.
So, f may assume only ﬁnitely many values which are powers. The
proof of this result required the theory of linear forms of logarithms,
as had been developed by Baker.

Exponential congruences
A.
The Wieferich congruence
Motivated by a criterion for the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last Theorem,
I consider the following Wieferich congruence:
ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2)
(1)
where p is an odd prime, and 2 ≤a, p ∤a.
Due to Fermat’s Little Theorem, qp(a) =
ap−1−1
p
is an integer
called the Fermat quotient of p in base a. Thus (1) holds exactly
when
qp(a) ≡0 (mod p).
(2)
The Fermat quotient satisﬁes the following property, which was
ﬁrst observed by Eisenstein:
qp(ab) ≡qp(a) + qp(b) (mod p).
(3)
As noted by actual computation, only rarely is qp(a) ≡0 (mod p).
Thus, for a = 2, and p < 4×1012, if qp(2) ≡0 (mod p), then p = 1093
or 3511.
More generally, I consider also the congruences
ap−1 ≡1 (mod pk),
(4)
where k ≥1, p is an odd prime, a ≥2, and p ∤a.
Let l ≥2, l prime, k ≥1, and let
W (k)
l
= {p odd prime | lp−1 ≡1 (mod pk)},
W (k)
l
′ = {p odd prime | lp−1 ̸≡1 (mod pk)}.
Thus, W (1)
l
is the set of all primes p ̸= l. Clearly,
W (1)
l
⊇W (2)
l
⊇· · · ⊇W (k)
l
⊇· · · .
Heuristically, W (2)
l
is an inﬁnite set, while W (k)
l
is ﬁnite, for all k ≥3.
This is seen in the following way: not knowing what should be qp(l)-
modulo p, and supposing that the Fermat quotient may assume with
the same probability each value, then if x is any positive real number,
#{p ≤x | p ∈W (2)
l
} =

p≤x
1
p = log log x + O(1);

3 Exponential congruences
247
thus, W (2)
l
should be inﬁnite. For k ≥3,
#{p ≤x | p ∈W (k)
l
} =

p≤x, p∤a
1
pk−1 < ζ(k −1) < ∞.
Even though the above arguments are heuristically acceptable, they
are not fully justiﬁed. For k ≥2 it is not known whether W (k)
l
of W (k)
l
′ is ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
I note the following interesting result by Powell (1982):
(3.1) Let l be any prime. Then the set
S =
-
k odd

W (k)
l
\ W (k+1)
l

is inﬁnite.
Proof.
The prime q belongs to S if and only if the q-adic
value vq(lq−1−1) is odd. Assume that {q1, . . . , qn} (with n ≥0) is the
set of odd primes in S. Let s = 1 when n = 0, or s = n
i=1(qi −1)2
when n ≥1.
Since qi−1 divides 4s, then qi divides l4s−1 (for each i = 1, . . . , n).
It will be shown that l4s + 1 is a square or a double square.
Let p be any odd prime dividing l4s+1, so p | l8s−1 and p ∤l4s−1.
Hence, p ̸= qi for each i = 1, . . . , n. Let r be the order of l modulo p.
So, p−1 = rk (implying p ∤r, p ∤k), and also 8s = rhpf with f ≥0,
p ∤h. Since s is a square, f is even.
Note that
lp−1 −1
lr −1
= lr(k−1) + lr(k−2) + · · · + lr + 1
≡k (mod p),
and similarly
lrh −1
lr −1 ≡h (mod p).
So, vp(lp−1 −1) = vp(lr −1) = vp(lrh −1). Since p ̸= q1, . . . qn, then
d = vp(lp−1 −1) is even. Now, vp(l8s −1) = d+f is also even, noting
that 8s = rhf. Since p is an arbitrary odd prime divisor of l4s + 1,
then l4s + 1 = c2 or 2c2 (for some c ≥1). But, as is well-known,
Fermat had shown that the equations X4 +Y 4 = Z2 or X4 +Y 4 =

248
9. Powerless Facing Powers
2Z2 have only trivial solutions (x, y, z) with |x|, |y|, |z| ≤1. So this
is a contradiction, proving that the set S is indeed inﬁnite.
2
In 1985, Granville showed:
(3.2) Let l ≥2 be a prime. If W (3)
l
is ﬁnite, then there exist inﬁnitely
many primes p such that p ≡1 (mod 4) and lp−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2). In
particular, if W (3)
l
is ﬁnite, then W (2)
l
′ is inﬁnite.
From Powell’s result, W (2)
l
′ is inﬁnite; here is also asserted that
W (2)
l
′ contains inﬁnitely many primes p ≡1 (mod 4).
It is also interesting to consider the following question. Given an
odd prime p, estimate the number of elements in the set
B(p) = {a | 2 ≤a < p such that ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2)}
or of the subset
B′(p) = {q prime | 2 ≤q < p, such that qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2)}.
In 1966, Kruyswijk showed:
(3.3) There is a constant C > 0 such that for every p
#B(p) < p
1
2+
C
log log p .
The result is better for B′(p). Granville showed in 1987:
(3.4) Let u ≥1 be an integer and let p be a prime such that p > u2u.
Then
#{q prime | 2 ≤q < p
1
u and qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2)} < up1/2u.
In particular, for every prime p,
#{q prime | 2 ≤q < p1/2 and qp−1 ≡1 (mod p2)} < p1/2.
B.
Primitive factors
The following theorem was proved by Bang in 1886 (for a = 2) and
extended by Zsigmondy in 1892:

3 Exponential congruences
249
(3.5) Let a ≥2. For every n ≥2 (with the exceptions indicated
below) there exists a prime p which is a primitive factor of an ∓1,
that is, p divides an ∓1, but p does not divide am ∓1 for all m < n.
The only exceptions to the above are:
(i) 26 −1, 23 + 1
(ii) (2k −1)2 −1
A detailed proof may be found, for example, in my book Fermat’s
Last Theorem for Amateurs (1999).
Let an ∓1 = AB with gcd(A, B) = 1 and p | A if and only if p is
a primitive factor. Then A is called the primitive part of an ∓1, and
I shall use the notation A = (an ∓1)∗.
The above theorem may be applied to the Mersenne numbers
Mq = 2q −1 (q prime) as well as to the Fermat numbers Fn =
22n + 1. So it makes sense to consider their primitive parts M∗
q ,
respectively F ∗
n.
For each prime L ≥2 let NL = {p prime | there exists c ≥1, p ∤c,
such that pc = a ± b, where each prime factor of ab is at most equal
to L}. It is not known if the sets NL are ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
To further analyze the situation, I introduce other sets of primes.
If k ≥1 and l is any prime, let
N (k)
l
= {p prime | there exists s ≥1 such that pk divides ls + l,
but pk+1 does not divide ls + l}.
For example, if l ≤L, then N (1)
l
⊆NL. So, in order to show that NL
is inﬁnite, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a prime l ≤L such that N (1)
l
is inﬁnite. In
other words, consider the sequence of integers {l+1, l2+1, l3+1, . . .}.
By (3.5), there are inﬁnitely many primes p dividing some number
of the sequence because (with the only exception l = 2, s = 3) each
number ls + 1 has a primitive prime factor. Are there still inﬁnitely
many such primes belonging to N (1)
l
?
This is true if there would exist inﬁnitely many primitive prime
factors whose squares are not factors. A hard question to settle, but
once again full of important consequences.
A result of 1968 by Puccioni has been improved as follows (see
my own paper (1998)):
(3.6) For every k ≥1 and prime l ≥2:

250
9. Powerless Facing Powers
1. N (k)
l
∩W(k+1)
l
=



∅
if l ̸≡1 (mod 2k+1),
{2}
if l ≡1 (mod 2k+1),
2. N (k)
l
∪W(k+2)
l
is an inﬁnite set.
Proof.
(1) First, it will be shown by induction on k that N (k)
l
∩
W(k+1)
l
⊆{2}.
If k = 1 and p is an odd prime such that p ∈N (1)
l
∩W(2)
l
, then
lp−1 ≡1 (mod p2) and there exist s ≥1, c ≥1, such that p ∤c,
ls + 1 = pc; since lp ≡1 (mod p2), then ls ≡lps = (pc −1)p ≡
−1 (mod p2), so p2 | ls + 1, which is absurd.
Assume the statement true for k ≥1. First note that N (k)
l
∩
W(k+2)
l
⊆N (k)
l
∩W(k+1)
l
⊆{2}. It suﬃces to show that (N (k+1)
l
\
N (k)
l
) ∩W(k+1)
l
= ∅. Let p be a prime in this set, so lp−1 ≡
1 (mod pk+2) and there exists s ≥1, c ≥1, such that p ∤c,
ls + 1 = pk+1c; since lp ≡l (mod pk+2), then ls ≡lps ≡(pk+1c −
1)p (mod pk+2). If p ̸= 2, then ls ≡−1 (mod pk+2), which is absurd.
If p = 2, then ls ≡1 (mod 2k+2) and 2k+1c ≡ls + 1 ≡2 (mod 2k+2),
hence k + 1 = 1 and k = 0, which is absurd.
This shows that N (k)
l
∩W(k+1)
l
⊆{2}.
Finally, if 2 ∈N (k)
l
∩W(k+1)
l
, then l ≡1 (mod 2k+1).
Conversely, if l ≡1 (mod 2k+1), then 2 ∈W(k+1)
l
and l + 1 ≡
2 (mod 2k+1), so s ∈N (1)
l
⊆N (k)
l
.
(2) In this proof, (2.12) will be used. For the polynomial f(X) =
2Xk+1 −1, let C be the corresponding eﬀectively computable
constant.
If N (k)
l
∪W(k+2)
l
is assumed to be ﬁnite, let m be a prime number
such that m > C and m > max{p | p ∈N (k)
l
∪W(k+2)
l
}. Let P =

l̸=q≤m q (each factor q being a prime number). Hence, ϕ(P) =

l̸=q≤m(q −1), and so ϕ(P) is even and greater than C.
It is clear that lϕ(P) ≡1 (mod P). Also, if q ̸= 2 and q divides
lϕ(P) + 1, then q > m—otherwise, l ̸= q ≤m, so q divides P, hence
lϕ(P) −1 and q = 2.
It is well-known, and easy to show, that if n ≥2 and l is a prime,
then lh + 1 is not a power. For a proof, see my book Catalan’s
Conjecture (1994), page 201.

First case. There exists a prime q such that qk+2 divides lϕ(P) +1.
If q = 2, then l is odd and lϕ(P) ≡−1 (mod 8). But l2 ≡1 (mod 8)
and lϕ(P) ≡1 (mod 8), which is absurd.
So, q ̸= 2, hence q > m, and therefore q ∤ϕ(P).
Let g be the order of l modulo q, hence g divides q −1. But
q | l2ϕ(P) −1, so g | 2ϕ(P), and therefore 2ϕ(P) = gh, with q not
dividing h.
Since qk+2 divides lgh −1 = (lg −1)(lg(h−1) +lg(h−2) +· · ·+lg +1),
and lg ≡1 (mod q), then the second factor above is congruent to h ̸≡
0 (mod q). Therefore, qk+2 divides lg −1. So, lq−1 ≡1 (mod qk+2),
that is, q ∈W(k+2)
l
and hence q < m, which is a contradiction.
Second case. If q divides lϕ(P)+1, then qk+2 does not divide lϕ(P)+
1.
Since lϕ(P) +1 is not a (k +1)th power, there exists a prime q such
that q | lϕ(P) + 1, but qk+1 ∤lϕ(P) + 1. Hence, q ∈N (k)
l
and q ≤m.
This implies that q = 2, and so lϕ(P) + 1 = 2etk+1, where 1 ≤e ≤k
and t is odd. But l is odd and ϕ(P) is even, so lϕ(P) ≡1 (mod 4).
Hence e = 1, that is, lϕ(P) + 1 = 2tk+1.
Thus, the integers t, l ̸= 0, ϕ(P) ≥1 are solutions of the equation
2Xk+1 −1 = Y Z. Hence, ϕ(P) ≤C, which is an absurdity.
2
In particular, N (1)
l
∪W(3)
l
is an inﬁnite set. It suﬃces to show that
W(3)
l
is a ﬁnite set (for some prime l) to conclude that N (1)
l
is inﬁnite.
For example, if l = 2, no integer in W(3)
l
is known.

Dream mathematics
One day, mathematicians will become smarter and will be able to
prove many statements that are today only conjectured to be true.
For the moment, it is only possible to dream. But such dreams may
be organized.
A.
The statements
To demonstrate my ignorance beyond any doubt, let me discuss bi-
nomials, Mersenne numbers, Fermat numbers, powerful numbers,
square-free numbers, numbers with a square factor, prime numbers,
and Wieferich congruences. Isn’t that enough?
Nobody knows if the the statements listed below are true.

A star refers to the primitive part.
Let α ∈{P, C, SF, S, W, ¬W} and let ϵ ∈{ﬁnite, ∞}. Let
Mq = 2q −1 (for q prime): Mersenne number,
Fn = 22n + 1 (for n ≥0): Fermat number.
B.
Statements
I begin by considering Mersenne numbers.
(Mα,ϵ) := #{q | Mq satisﬁes α} = ϵ,
(M∗
α,ϵ) := #{q | M∗
q satisﬁes α} = ϵ.
There are many obvious implications among these statements:

(9) = (M∗
W, ﬁnite)
(10) = (M∗
¬W,∞)
(11) = (MW, ﬁnite)
(12) = (M¬W,∞)
One may also consider the negations of these properties and for
these the reverse implications are satisﬁed.
It is believed that (MP,∞) and (MC,∞) are both true. It is also a
very deep problem to decide whether (7), (9), or even (11), is true.
Now I consider the analogous statements for Fermat numbers.
(Fα,ϵ) := #{n | Fn has property α} = ϵ,
(F ∗
α,ϵ) := #{n | F ∗
n has property α} = ϵ.
The same diagram of obvious implications hold for Fermat
numbers by just replacing M by F.
There is no opinion as to whether (FP,∞) or even (F¬W,∞) is true.
The next statements concern binomials an ± 1 (where a ≥2, n ≥
1).
It is easy to show that if an −1 is a prime, then a = 2, and n is a
prime. Also, if an + 1 is a prime, then a = 2 and n is a power of 2.
Consider the statements
(B(a, ±)α,ϵ) := #{n | an ± 1 has property α} = ϵ,
(B(a, ±)∗
α,ϵ) := #{n | (an ± 1)∗has property α} = ϵ.
For a = 2, (B(2, −)P,ϵ) = (MP,ϵ) and (B(2, −)C,∞) is true. Also,
(B(2, +)P,ϵ) = (FP,ϵ) and (B(2, +)C,∞) is true. The same obvious
implications of the diagram (and reverse-implications) are satisﬁed
by the properties (respectively, their negations) of the sequences of
numbers an ± 1.
Now I introduce statements concerning Wieferich congruences. Let
a ≥2 and
(W(a)ϵ) := #{p prime | ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2)} = ϵ,
(¬W(a)ϵ) := #{p prime | ap−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2)} = ϵ.
Clearly, (W(a) ﬁnite) →(¬W(a)∞) and (¬W(a) ﬁnite) →(W(a)∞).

254
9. Powerless Facing Powers
In Section 1 I indicated Erd¨os’ conjecture about powerful
numbers:
(E)
There do not exist three consecutive powerful numbers.
In the same order of ideas, consider the statement
(E ﬁnite)
There exist at most ﬁnitely many n such that n −1,
n, n + 1 are powerful.
Clearly, (E) implies (E ﬁnite).
C.
Binomials and Wieferich congruences
I begin with the following useful result which was proposed in 1977
by Powell as a problem (solution published by De Leon in 1978):
(4.1) Let p be an odd prime, and a ≥2, m ≥1. If am ≡1 (mod p),
and am−1 ≡1 (mod p2), then am ≡1 (mod p2).
Proof.
Let h = ord(amodp), so h | m, say m = hk. Also, h | p−1,
so p −1 = hl. Writing ah = 1 + cp, then ap−1 = (1 + cp)l ≡1 +
lcp (mod p2). Thus, p | lc, so p | c, and hence am = ahk = (1+cp)k ≡
1 (mod p2).
2
The following properties will be required:
(PB(a, −)α,ϵ) := #{p prime | ap −1 satisﬁes property α} = ϵ,
(PB(a, −)∗
α,ϵ) := #{p prime | (ap −1)∗satisﬁes property α} = ϵ.
(4.2) For each a ≥2 the following implications hold:
(W(a)ﬁnite)
 (PB∗(a, −)SF,∞)


(B∗(a, −)SF,∞)

(PB∗(a, −)¬W,∞)

(B∗(a, −)¬W,∞)


(¬W(a)∞)
(PB(a, −)¬W,∞)
 (B(a, −)¬W,∞)
Proof.
All implications but two are trivial.
(W(a) ﬁnite) →(PB∗(a, −)SF,∞). Let
{p prime | ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2)} = {p1, . . . , pm}

4 Dream mathematics
255
and
h0 = max{ord(a mod pi) | i = 1, . . . , m},
and let p > h0. Let q = q(p) be any primitive prime factor of ap −1,
so ord(a mod q) = p. In particular, if p ̸= p′, then q(p) ̸= q(p′).
Moreover, since p > h0, it follows that q ̸= p1, . . . , pm, and hence
aq−1 ≡1 (mod q2). By (4.1), q2 ∤ap −1. This shows that (ap −1)∗
is square-free.
(B∗(a, −)¬W,∞) →(¬W(a)∞). Let n be such that (an −1) is
not powerful, so there exists a prime pn such that pn | (an −1)∗
but p2
n ∤(an −1)∗. Hence pn | an −1, but p2
n ∤an −1. By (4.1),
p2
n ∤(apn−1 −1). Note that n = ord(a mod pn). So, if n ̸= m, then
pn ̸= pm. This shows (¬W(a)∞).
2
In particular, taking a = 2, it follows that
(W(2) ﬁnite) →(M∗
SF,∞) →(M∗
¬W,∞) →(¬W(2)∞).
The following implication holds for special values of a:
(4.3) If a is even and √a −1 is powerful, then (B(a, −)W, ﬁnite) →
(B∗(a, −)¬W,∞).
Proof.
If (B∗(a, −)¬W,∞) is false, there exists m0 such that for
every m > m0 and for every primitive prime factor pm of am −1,
p2
m | am −1.
Choose a prime q > m0; if s ≥1 and l is a prime dividing aqs −1,
then there exists h, 0 ≤h ≤s, such that l is a primitive prime
divisor of aqh −1. If h = 0, then l2 | a −1, by hypothesis. If h ≥1,
again l2 | aqh −1, because q > m0. Hence l2 | aqs −1. This shows
that aqs −1 is a powerful number for every s ≥1, contradicting the
hypothesis.
2
I note also the following implication which will be useful very
shortly:
(4.4) (B(a2, −)W, ﬁnite) →(¬W(a)∞).
Proof.
Assume that (¬W(a)∞) is not true, so there exists p0 such
that if p is a prime, p > p0, then ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2). Let t = 
p≤p0 p,
hence ϕ(t) = 
p≤p0(p −1). For every h ≥1 let ah = ahtϕ(t). Then
ah −1 is a powerful number, as I proceed to show.

256
9. Powerless Facing Powers
Note that 2 ∤ah−1, since a is even. If p is a prime such that 2 < p ≤
p0, then p(p−1) divides tϕ(t); from ap−1 ≡1 (mod p), it follows that
ap(p−1) ≡1 (mod p2), therefore, p2 | ahtϕ(t) −1 = ah −1. Finally,
if p > p0 and p | ah −1, then by hypothesis ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2);
hence by (4.1), p2 | ah −1. Since h is arbitrary, this contradicts the
hypothesis.

For the next result, the following notation will be used:
(QB(a, +)α,ϵ) := #{2n | a2n + 1 satisﬁes property α} = ϵ,
(QB∗(a, +)α,ϵ) := #{2n | (a2n + 1)∗satisﬁes property α} = ϵ.
The next proposition is the analog of (4.2):
(4.5) For each a ≥2 the following implications hold:
(W(a)ﬁnite)
 (QB∗(a, +)SF,∞)


(B∗(a, +)SF,∞)

(QB∗(a, +)¬W,∞)


(B∗(a, +)¬W,∞)


(¬W(a)∞)
(QB(a, +)¬W,∞)
 (B(a, +)¬W,∞)
Proof.
Only two implications need a proof.
(W(a)ﬁnite) →(QB∗(a, +)SF,∞). Let {p | ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2)} =
{p1, . . . , pm}. Let h0 = max{ord(a mod pi) | i = 1, . . . , m}. Let n
be such that 2n > h0 and let q be a prime dividing (a2n + 1)∗. So,
q | a2n + 1, thus q | a2n+1 −1 and ord(a mod q) = 2n+1 > h0; thus
q ̸= pi (for all i) and therefore aq−1 ̸≡1 (mod q2). Since 2n+1 | q −1
then a2n+1 ̸≡1 (mod q2) and again a2n ̸≡1 (mod q2), showing that
(a2n + 1)∗is square-free.
(B∗(a, +)¬W,∞) →(¬W(a)∞). Let n > 1 be such that (an +
1)∗is not powerful, so there exists a prime p = p(a) such that p
divides (an + 1)∗, but p2 ∤(an + 1)∗. It follows that p | a2n −1, but
p2 ∤an + 1 since (an + 1)∗and
an+1
(an+1)∗are coprime. If p2 | a2n −1,
then p | an −1, so p = 2. But this implies that a is odd, so p | a + 1
and from the assumption that n > 1 it would follow that p would
not be a divisor of (an + 1)∗. By (4.1), then, ap−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2).
To conclude, note that 2n = ord(a mod pn), so if n ̸= n′, then
pn ̸= pn′. This implies that (¬W(a)∞) is satisﬁed.

Taking a = 2, one obtains the implications involving Fermat
numbers:
(W(2)ﬁnite)
 (F ∗
SF,∞)
 (F α
¬W,∞)
 (¬W(2)).
There are, of course, many statements along these lines which
may be proved in exercises by the reader. For example, consider
the following ones due to Rotkiewicz (1965) and to Warren and
Bray (1967):
1. Let p be a prime such that p2 divides some Mersenne number.
Then 2p−1 ≡1 (mod p2); conversely, if p divides Mq and 2p−1 ≡
1 (mod p2), then p2 divides Mq (this converse is just (4.1)).
2. The analogous statement holds for Fermat numbers.
D.
Erd¨os conjecture and Wieferich congruence
I begin with an easy illustration of the connection between the
Wieferich congruence and the Erd¨os conjecture.
(4.6) (Eﬁnite) →(B(a2, −)W, ﬁnite) (for any even a)
Proof.
Indeed, if a is even and a2k −1 = (ak −1)(ak + 1) is
powerful, the fact that gcd(ak −1, ak + 1) = 1 implies that ak −1,
ak, ak + 1 are three consecutive powerful numbers. Thus (Eﬁnite)
implies (B(a2, −)W, ﬁnite).
2
From (4.4) and (4.6), it follows that (Eﬁnite) →(¬W(a)∞) for
all a even. This remarkable implication was proved by Granville
in 1986. In particular, (¬W(2)∞). In view of the theorem of
Wieferich, (Eﬁnite) implies the theorem of Adleman, Heath-
Brown, and Fouvry (the ﬁrst case of Fermat’s Last Theorem is
true for inﬁnitely many prime exponents) already quoted in (2.5).
Notwithstanding the fact that Wiles proved Fermat’s Last Theo-
rem in all cases, the above connection with powerful numbers is very
intriguing.
E.
The dream in the dream
In your dreams, you have a marvelous dream and you wish it to be
real. “It” is spelled ABC and it is the most tantalizing conjecture
one may imagine (or dream). Yet, so simple to state!

258
9. Powerless Facing Powers
Mason (1983, 1984) proved a theorem about polynomials that
inspired Masser in 1985 to formulate a conjecture, rephrased by
Oesterl´e in 1988 as follows:
(ABC) For every ϵ > 0 there exists K(ϵ) > 0 such that if A, B, C
are positive integers with gcd(A, B, C) = 1 and A + B = C, then
C < K(ϵ)R1+ϵ
(1)
where
R =

p|ABC
p.
In this respect, the following terminology is convenient. If n ̸= 0,
then r = 
p|n, p prime p is called the radical of n. So, R is the radical
of ABC.
There is no attempt in the statement of the conjecture to give any
indication of an eﬀective lower bound for K(ϵ).
What is the gist of the conjecture? Taking, for example, ϵ = 1
2,
A = 2m (m large), B = 3n (n large), if (1) holds, then C <
K(1
2)63/2 
p|C p3/2. Since C is large, than C must have a large prime
factor or many prime factors. At any rate, (ABC) expresses a deep
connection between addition and multiplication.
A conjecture is interesting if it keeps being a conjecture for a long
time, so it resists attempts to prove or to disprove it. Since K(ϵ) is
not explicit, it is hard to see how to disprove the (ABC) conjecture.
On the other hand, the (ABC) conjecture implies many other diﬃcult
conjectures. So it is both important and diﬃcult to establish (ABC).
If you, a respected mathematician, would tell that you are study-
ing (ABC), what will be the reaction? Perhaps derogatory. So, say
instead that you are studying the (XYZ) conjecture. It is more
mysterious.
Leaving fun aside, I will indicate what (ABC) implies, not ev-
erything however. Here is one striking implication (see Oesterl´e
(1988)).
(4.7) (ABC) →Fermat’s Last Theorem is true for all suﬃciently
large exponents.
Proof.
Assume that n ≥5, a, b, c are positive integers with
gcd(a, b, c) = 1, a < b < c, and an + bn = cn. Let ϵ =
1
2, and

4 Dream mathematics
259
let K = K(1
2) as per the (ABC) conjecture. So,
cn < K(abc)3/2 < Kc9/2,
and hence cn−9
2 < K, and thus n is bounded, proving Fermat’s Last
Theorem is true for all suﬃciently large exponents n.
2
Practically the same proof was used by Granville in 1997 to
deal with the equation
AXn + BY n = CZn,
(2)
where A, B, C are non-zero coprime integers.
(4.8) (ABC) →For all suﬃciently large n, the equation (2) has only
trivial solutions (x, y, z), with |x|, |y|, |z| ≤1.
I considered in Section D. the equation
AXl + BY m = CZn,
(3)
where l, m, n ≥2 and A, B, C are non-zero coprime integers. It was
indicated in (2.8) that if 1
l + 1
m + 1
n < 1, then (3) has only ﬁnitely
many solutions (x, y, z) with x, y, z coprime integers.
I have shown (in 1999):
(4.9) (ABC) →There are only ﬁnitely many tuples (l, m, n) satis-
fying (3) for which the equation (2) has a nontrivial solution (x, y, z)
in coprime integers, i.e., |x|, |y|, or |z| > 1.
The proof of (4.9) requires the simpler (4.10) below. Let A, B, C be
non-zero coprime integers, and let U be the set of 4-tuples (l, m, x, y)
such that (1) |x|, |y| > 1, (2) l, m ≥2, 1
l + 1
m < 1, and (3) Axl +
Bym = C.
(4.10) (ABC) →U is a ﬁnite set.
Among the applications, one may consider diﬀerences of powers
(A = 1, B = −1). This includes Catalan’s problem on consecutive
powers (see Chapter 7 of this book). Tijdeman’s celebrated theorem
asserts that there exists an eﬀectively computable bound C > 0
such that if x, y, m, n are integers with x, y ̸= 0, m, n ≥2, and
xm −yn = 1, then |x|, |y|, m, n < C.

260
9. Powerless Facing Powers
Let z1 < z2 < z3 < · · · be the sequence of all integers which
are powers, with arbitrary exponents (greater than 1). Tijdeman’s
theorem means that lim sup(zi+1 −zi) > 1.
Landau conjectures that lim sup(zi+1 −zi) = ∞. This has never
been proved, however,
(4.11) (ABC) →Landau’s conjecture is true.
Elkies proved in 1991:
(4.12) (ABC) →Faltings theorem (i.e., Mordell’s conjecture is
true).
The proof is subtle.
Combining results (4.7) and (4.10), it follows from (ABC) that
there exists at most ﬁnitely many 4-tuples (x, y, z, n) with n ≥3, x,
y, z > 0, gcd(x, y, z) = 1, and xn + yn = zn. Of course, no eﬀective
bound is provided. This is less than stating that (ABC) would imply
Wiles’ theorem (i.e., Fermat’s Last Theorem is true).
The following result was proved by Silverman in 1998; the sim-
pler proof given here was kindly communicated to me by Ram
Murty.
(4.13) (ABC) →(¬W(a)∞) for every a ≥2.
Proof.
For every n ≥1, let an −1 = unvn where un is square-free,
gcd(un, vn) = 1; so, vn is powerful. Note that limn→∞(unvn) = ∞.
Let U = {p prime | there exists n such that p | un}. Since each un
is square-free, then U is ﬁnite if and only if the set {un | n ≥1} is
bounded.
Given ϵ = 1
2, let K = K(1
2) as mandated in the (ABC) conjecture.
So,
unvn < an < K(aunv1/2
n )3/2
because vn is powerful. So, v1/4
n
< Ka3/2u1/2
n . If the set {un | n ≥1}
is bounded, then so is the set {vn | n ≥1}, hence lim unvn →∞, a
contradiction.
If {un | n ≥1} is unbounded, then U is inﬁnite. If p ∈U, then
p2 ∤(an −1), so by (4.1), ap−1 ̸≡1 (mod p2), and hence (¬W(a)∞)
is true.
2
Now I give another implication. With a similar argument, it is
easy to show

4 Dream mathematics
261
(4.14) (ABC) →Let a > b ≥1 with gcd(a, b) = 1. Then the set
{n ≥1 | ab ± bn is powerful} is ﬁnite.
Proof.
For each n, let an ± bn = unvn where un is square-free,
vn is powerful, and gcd(un, vn) = 1. Let ϵ = 1
2, K = K(1
2), so by the
(ABC) conjecture
unvn < K(abunv1/2
n )3/2.
Note that an ± bn is powerful exactly when un = 1. In this case,
v1/4
n
< K(ab)3/2. Therefore, vn is bounded and so is n.
2
As particular cases, with a = 2, b = 1, note
(4.15) (ABC) →(MW, ﬁnite) and (FW, ﬁnite), in words, there exist
only ﬁnitely many powerful Mersenne and Fermat numbers.
The result (4.14) has been generalized by Ribenboim and Walsh
(1999c). Let R > 0 be a square-free integer, let h, k ≥2, and let A,
B, E be non-zero integers, such that gcd(A, ER) = gcd(B, ER) = 1.
For each C ̸= 0 such that the radical of C divides R, consider the
equation
AXh + BY k = EC.
(4)
Let SC = {(x, y) | x ≥1, y ≥1, gcd(x, y) = 1 and Axh+Byk = EC}.
Let S = {SC | radical of C divides R}. For each integer n > 0
denote by w(n) the powerful part of n. So, n = w(n)n′ where n′ is
square-free and gcd(w(n), n′) = 1. With the above notations,
(4.16) (ABC) →For every ϵ > 0 there exists only ﬁnitely many
(x, y) ∈S such that w(x) > xϵ or w(y) > yϵ. In particular, there
exists only ﬁnitely many (x, y) ∈S such that x or y is powerful.
It is useful to observe that if R = 1 and max{h, k} ≥3, that is,
1
h + 1
k < 1, then by the well-known theorem of Siegel, there are
only ﬁnitely many pairs (x, y) with x, y ≥1, gcd(x, y) = 1, such
that Axh + Byk = E. If h = k = 2, this is the situation of the Pell
equations and, as is well-known, the solutions of these equations are
terms in certain binary linear recurring sequences.
In the same paper, Ribenboim and Walsh applied the above
result to deal with powerful terms in binary linear recurring se-
quences. Let P, Q be non-zero coprime integers such that P > 0,

262
9. Powerless Facing Powers
D = P 2 −4Q ̸= 0. The following two Lucas sequences are associated
to the parameters (P, Q):
U0 = 0,
U1 = 1,
Un = PUn−1 −QUn−2
(for n ≥2),
and
V0 = 2,
V1 = P,
Vn = PVn−1 −QVn−2
(for n ≥2).
The additive relation
V 2
n −DU2
n = 4Qn
(5)
holds (for all n ≥0). If Q = ±1 (for example, for the sequences of
Fibonacci and Lucas numbers which have parameters (1, −1)) one
has:
V 2
n −DU2
n = 4(−1)n.
(6)
The following result is well-known (see Mollin (1996)):
(4.17) (ABC) →There are only ﬁnitely many Fibonacci or Lucas
numbers which are powerful.
An extension for all Lucas sequences with discriminant D > 0
requires the relation (5) which is dealt with in (4.16):
(4.18) (ABC) →If D > 0, for every ϵ > 0 the sets {n ≥1 | w(Un) >
Uϵ
n} and {n ≥1 | w(Vn) ≥V ϵ
n} are ﬁnite. In particular, there are
only ﬁnitely many n ≥1 such that Un or Vn is powerful.
Other types of binary linear recurring sequences were also
considered in the same paper, with similar results.
A question which has been investigated is the diﬀerences be-
tween powers. For consecutive powers, see Chapter 7 of this book.
Mordell, Hall, and many others studied the diﬀerences between
squares and cubes, that is, the equation
y3 = x2 + d
(where x, y ≥1, d is any integer, not necessarily positive).
Hall conjectured:
(H) For every ϵ > 0, there exists K > 0 (depending on ϵ) such that
if y3 = x2 + d with x, y ≥1, d ̸= 0, then y < K|d|2+ϵ.

4 Dream mathematics
263
It is reasonable to consider similar conjectures (Hm,n) for each
pair (m, n) of positive integers such that
1
m + 1
n < 1:
(Hm,n) For every ϵ > 0 such that 0 < ϵ < 1
6, there exists K > 0
(depending on ϵ, m, n) such that if x, y > 0, d ̸= 0 and ym = xn +d,
then y < K|d|t+ϵ where t = n/(mn −m −n).
In Ribenboim (2000) it is proven
(4.19) (ABC) →(Hm,n) holds for all pairs (m, n) as indicated
above.
The conjectures (Hm,n) have interesting consequences indicated in
the paper.
There are also strong conjectures about primes dividing values
of polynomials and about powerful numbers which are values of
polynomials.
First I state the conjecture of Langevin (1993) :
(L) Let f ∈Z[X] with degree d ≥2 and having no multiple roots.
For every ϵ > 0 there exists K = K(f, ϵ) > 0 such that if n is
suﬃciently large, then R(f(n)) > Knd−1−ϵ (where R(f(n)) is the
radical of f(n)).
The conjecture of Schinzel (1976) is the following:
(ST) Let f ∈Q[X] with at least three simple zeros. Then #{n ≥1 |
f(n) is powerful} < ∞.
This conjecture shoud be compared with the theorem quoted
in (2.12).
It is very easy to show:
(4.20) (ST) →(Eﬁnite).
Proof.
Let f(X) = X(X2 −1); so all the roots of f are simple. If
n−1, n, n+1 are three powerful numbers, then f(n) = (n−1)n(n+1)
is powerful. Since #{n : |f(n)| is powerful} < ∞by hypothesis, then
(Eﬁnite) holds.
2
Walsh proved in 1997 (to appear in 1999):
(4.21) (L) →(ST).

264
9. Powerless Facing Powers
Proof.
(1) First, let f ∈Z[X], with positive leading coeﬃcient,
deg(f) = d ≥3, and all the roots of f simple. Then there exists C > 0
such that for all n suﬃciently large, |f(n)| < C|n|d.
Let ϵ be such that 0 < ϵ <
1
2 and let K > 0 be the constant
indicated by the hypothesis (L) such that
R(f(n)) > K|n|d−1−ϵ
for all n suﬃciently large.
If, moreover, |f(n)| is powerful, then R(f(n)) ≤|f(n)|1/2. Hence,
C|n|d > K2|n|2(d−1−ϵ), and therefore C > K|n|d−2−2ϵ. Since d −2 −
2ϵ > 0, it follows that |n| remains bounded when |f(n)| is powerful.
(2) Let f ∈Z[X], with positive leading coeﬃcient, deg(f) = d ≥3
and assume that f has at least three simple roots. The polynomial f
may be written as a product of irreducible polynomials, which, by
Gauss’ Lemma, may be taken to be from Z[X]. Moreover, since f
has at least three simple roots, the above decomposition yields an
expression f = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X], deg(g) ≥3, the roots of g
being the simple roots of f; moreover, g and h have positive leading
coeﬃcients and gcd(g, h) = 1.
Hence, there exist polynomials g1, h1 ∈Z[X] such that
g1g + h1h = 1.
If |n| is suﬃciently large, then g(n), g1(n), h(n), h1(n) are not equal
to 0; as g1(n)g(n) + h1(n)h(n) = 1, it follows that gcd(g(n), h(n)) =
1.
Now, if |f(n)| = |g(n)||h(n)| is powerful, then also |g(n)| is
powerful, hence, by (1), |n| is bounded.
(3) Let f ∈Q[X] such that there exists a2 ∈Z and a2f ∈Z[X].
If f has positive leading coeﬃcients and at least three simple roots,
so does a2f. By (2), there are only ﬁnitely many n ∈Z such that
a2f(n) is powerful, a fortiori the same holds for f.
(4) Assume that the leading coeﬃcient a of f is negative. If
the degree of f is even, let f−(X) = −f(X). If d is odd, let
f−(X) = f(−X). So in both cases the leading coeﬃcient of f−
is positive. By (3), {n ∈Z : |f−(n)| is powerful} is ﬁnite. Therefore,
{n : |f(n)| is powerful} is also ﬁnite.

Langerin proved (1993):
(4.22) (ABC) →(L).

From the above results, it may be said, for example, that there
are only ﬁnitely many integers n such that n3 + n + 1 is powerful.
I illustrate the strength of the (ABC) conjecture with further
results taken from my paper (1999). The ﬁrst result concerns dif-
ferences between 3-powerful numbers and powerful numbers. I will
state it in a particular form, for simplicity.
Let R ≥1 be a square-free integer, and let VR be the set of all
3-powerful integers k such that there exists c, 1 ≤c < k, with
gcd(k, c) = 1 and radical of c dividing R, such that k + c or k −c is
powerful. Then,
(4.23) (ABC) →For every R as above, the set VR is ﬁnite.
In particular, taking R = 1 there are only ﬁnitely many 3-powerful
numbers k such that k + 1 or k −1 is powerful. As was mentioned
in subsection C., the only known examples are 23 + 1 = 32 and
233 + 1 = 23 × 32 × 132.
The next result concerns triples of powerful numbers which I state,
for simplicity, in a particular case.
Let R ≥1 be a square-free integer, let TR be the set of all
pairs (k, c) such that 1 ≤c < k, gcd(k, c) = 1, the radical of c
divides R, and k −c, k, k + c are powerful numbers. I proved (1999):
(4.24) (ABC) →TR is a ﬁnite set for each square-free integer R ≥1.
In particular, if R = 1, this shows yet again that (ABC) →(Eﬁnite);
see Granville (1990).
It has now been amply illustrated how the (ABC) conjecture
is interesting. An accessible paper on this conjecture is by Nitaj
(1996).
And if it happens that you really reply that you are studying
the (ABC) (and not the (XYZ)) conjecture, you know now what to
explain.

Kinds of numbers
First I recall the various kinds of numbers. There are the integers,
which, as Kronecker said, are “God given” and should serve as
basis to build all of Mathematics.
Next, there are the rational numbers, obtained from the integers
by divisions.

Pythagoras noted that if the sides of the right-angle of a triangle
have measures equal to 1, then the hypotenuse, measured by
√
2, is
not a rational number: if
√
2 = m
n , then 2 = m2
n2 , so 2n2 = m2, the
power of 2 in the left-hand side has odd exponent, while in the right-
hand side it has even exponent, which is contrary to the uniqueness
of factorization of integers into prime factors. This discovery was
very perplexing at the time and would demand an important change
in the concept of number.
More generally, if p is a prime number, n ≥2, then
n√p is not a
rational number.
So, the extraction of roots may lead to new kinds of numbers. This
may be rephrased by stating that the roots of equations Xn −a = 0
(a ≥1) need not be rational numbers.
More generally, I examine the roots of polynomial equations with
rational coeﬃcients.
Solutions of linear equations are again rational numbers. Solutions
of quadratic equations are expressible with square roots. Cardano
showed that solutions of cubic equations, as well as of biquadratic
equations, are also expressible with square and cubic roots.
These discoveries led to the following question:
Are solutions of any polynomial equation (with rational coeﬃ-
cients and arbitrary degree) always expressible with radicals?
This problem dominated algebra from about 1750 to 1830 and
was the object of important work by Lagrange, Gauss, Abel,
Ruffini, and Galois. This is competently described in Nov´y’s
book.
At this stage, all numbers under consideration were real numbers—
namely, numbers which correspond to measures of segments. Each
such number has a decimal expansion and, as we said above, the ra-
tional numbers are those with ﬁnite or periodic decimal expansions.
Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers.
The equation X2+1 = 0 cannot have a root which is a real number,
since a sum of non-zero squares of real numbers is positive, so not
equal to zero.
Thus, it was necessary to invent a new kind of number.
The complex numbers were introduced to insure that all polyno-
mial equations with rational coeﬃcients have solutions.
The complex numbers are those of the form α = a + bi where
a, b are real numbers and i = √−1 (so i2 + 1 = 0). The complex

1 Kinds of numbers
273
conjugate of α is ¯α = a −bi, so α, ¯α are solutions of the quadratic
equation X2 −2aX + a2 + b2 = 0 which has real coeﬃcients.
D’Alembert and Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of al-
gebra that says that if f(X) = 0 is any polynomial equation with
real coeﬃcients (or even with complex coeﬃcients), then it has a
root which is a complex number. More precisely, if the polynomial
has degree d ≥1, then the equation has d roots which are complex
numbers (but need not be all distinct).
For convenience, we recall the usual notations:
Z = set of all integers
Q = set of all rational numbers
R = set of all real numbers
C = set of all complex numbers
The sets Q, R, and C are ﬁelds, which implies, in particular, that
they are closed with respect to division (i.e., solving linear equa-
tions), while the fundamental theorem of algebra says that C is closed
with respect to solving polynomial equations. Thus, C is called an
algebraically closed ﬁeld.
The consideration of equations with coeﬃcients in Z (or in Q) led
to the set Qalg of all complex numbers which are roots of polynomial
equations with coeﬃcients in Q. The set Qalg is a ﬁeld which is
algebraically closed and the smallest one containing Q.
Every element of Qalg is called an algebraic number. Moreover,
every algebraic number which is a root of a monic polynomial with
coeﬃcients in Z is called an algebraic integer.
If α ∈Qalg is a root of a polynomial f(X) of degree d ≥1, with
coeﬃcients in Q, but of none of smaller degree, then d is called the
degree of α. The polynomial f(X) is called the minimal polynomial
of α and it is irreducible over Q. Also, the roots of every irreducible
polynomial of degree d are algebraic numbers of degree d.
Thus, α is a rational number exactly when it is an algebraic num-
ber of degree 1. Moreover, for every d ≥1 there exist algebraic
numbers, and even algebraic integers α of degree d. Equivalently, for
every d ≥1 there exist irreducible monic polynomials f(X) ∈Z[X]
of degree d. For example, if p is any prime number, then Xd −p is
irreducible.
In this respect, it should be observed that if f(X) ∈Z[X] and
f(X) = g(X)h(X) with g(X), h(X) ∈Q[X], then there exist also

274
10. What Kind of Number Is
√

√
2?
g1(X), h1(X) ∈Z[X] of the same degree as g(X), h(X) respec-
tively, such that f(X) = g1(X)h1(X). This is a lemma due to
Gauss. Hence, f(X) ∈Z[X] is irreducible over Q if and only if
it is irreducible over Z.
The proof of the irreducibility of Xd −p is essentially the same
as the proof of the more general irreducibility criterion due to
Eisenstein.
If f(X) = Xd + a1Xd−1 + · · · + ad−1X + ad ∈Z[X], and if there
exists a prime p such that p divides each coeﬃcient ai, but p2 does
not divide ad, then f(X) is irreducible.
Every complex number which is not an algebraic number is called
a transcendental number. Explicitly, α is a transcendental number
if there does not exist any polynomial f(X) with coeﬃcients in Q,
diﬀerent from the zero polynomial, such that f(α) = 0.
More generally, the numbers α1, . . . , αn are said to be al-
gebraically independent (over Q) if there does not exist any
polynomial f(X1, . . . , Xn) with coeﬃcients in Q, diﬀerent from the
zero polynomial, such that f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0.
I summarize the above discussion of the various kinds of numbers
in Figure 10.1.
It is the moment to evoke some important classical discoveries.
A real number is expressible with quadratic radicals if and only if
it is the measure of a segment which is constructible with ruler and
compass (beginning with a segment of measure 1). Gauss showed
that the side of the regular polygon with n sides is constructible with
ruler and compass (that is, the roots of Xn −1 = 0 are expressible
with quadratic radicals) if and only if n is a product of powers of 2

and distinct prime Fermat numbers:
p = Fm = 22m + 1
(with m ≥0).
So, n = 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, . . . , or their products with powers of 2.
As a curiosity, I mention that Richelot gave in 1832 the explicit
formula, with quadratic radicals, for the side of the regular polygon
with 257 sides—it ﬁlled 83 pages of an article in Crelle’s Journal,
volume 9, 1832.
Abel, Ruffini, and Galois showed that if d ≥5 there exist
algebraic numbers of degree d which are not expressible by radicals.
More precisely, Galois’ theorem stated: if α ∈C is the root of
an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈Z[X], then α is expressible by
radicals if and only if the Galois group of the polynomial f(X) (that
is, the group of automorphisms of the ﬁeld generated by the roots
of f(X)) is a solvable group.
Abel and Ruffini established that the symmetric group and also
the alternating group on d ≥5 letters are not solvable groups. So,
any root of an irreducible polynomial of degree d ≥5 with symmetric
or alternating group, for example, is not expressible by radicals.
Incidentally, in 1933, van der Waerden showed that “almost all”
irreducible polynomials have Galois group equal to the symmetric
group. Namely, if f(X) ∈Z[X], let ⊓f denote the maximum of the
absolute values of its coeﬃcients. If d ≥2, for every N ≥1 let
IN = {f(X) ∈Z[X] | deg(f) = d, f(X) is irreducible, ⊓f ≤N},
SN = {f(X) ∈IN | the Galois group if f(X) is the symmetric
group on d letters}.
Then
lim
N→∞
#(SN)
#(IN) = 1.
Any set which may be put into one-to-one correspondence with
the set of natural numbers is said to be countable. So, Z and Q are
countable.
Since each polynomial has only ﬁnitely many roots, it follows that
Qalg is also countable. A famous result of Cantor is thatR (and
therefore C) is uncountable.
So, the sets of irrational numbers and transcendental numbers are
uncountable.

How numbers are given
The methods to decide whether a given number is transcendental
depend on “how well” the number may be approached by rational
numbers or algebraic numbers. This, in turn, may become apparent
from the form in which the number is given. So it appears useful, as
a preliminary step, to discuss how numbers may be presented.
Basically, numbers are deﬁned from known numbers by means of
“procedures”.
For example, rational numbers are obtained from integers by di-
visions, algebraic numbers are obtained from rational numbers by
solving polynomial equations.
But there are also inﬁnitary procedures, like the following ones:
• writing inﬁnite decimal representations according to some rule,
or “randomly”
• limits of sequences
• sums of series
• inﬁnite products
• values of deﬁnite integrals
• continued fractions
• values of functions at special points
• mathematical constants
• etc. . . .
Now I proceed to discuss several examples.
Examples
(1) The function x →log x =
3 x

dt
t , deﬁned for 0 < x < ∞, is one-
to-one and onto R. The number e is the only real number such that
log e = 1.

e = lim

or by

Moreover, Euler gave a simple continued fraction expression for e:
e = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, . . .]

(Continued fractions will be discussed in §4.)
More generally, Euler showed that if a = 1, 2, 3, . . . , then
e2/α + 1
e2/α −1 = [a, 3a, 5a, 7a, . . .].
In particular,
e2 + 1
e2 −1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, . . .]
and
e + 1
e −1 = [2, 6, 10, 14, . . .].
(2) The number π, deﬁned as the ratio
π =
length of circle
diameter of circle
(for any circle)
is a natural constant. But π is also given in several diﬀerent ways.

This is not a simple continued fraction, i.e., the numerators are not
all equal to 1.
Using the decimal expansion of π with 35 digits, Wallis calculated
in 1685 the ﬁrst 34 partial quotients of the simple continued fraction
expansion of π:
π = [3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1,
2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, 15, 3, 13, 1, 4, 2, 6, 6, 1, . . .].
The ﬁrst 26 partial quotients were calculated again by Lambert
in 1770.
This simple continued fraction for π does not reveal any regular
pattern. Up to now, no one has found any regular simple continued
fraction for any numbers easily related to π.
In a paper of 1878, Glaisher assembled a collection of series and
inﬁnite products for π and its powers. The proofs constitute amusing
exercises and, who knows, these formulas may even be useful. Let us
quote, for example:

The ubiquity of π is convincingly displayed by Castellanos (1988).

more generally, complex numbers αβ = eβ log α with α, β ∈C, α ̸= 0,
are values of an exponential function. The more interesting examples
are when α, β are algebraic numbers and β is not rational. I shall
return later to this topic.

(4) If s > 1, the Riemann zeta function is deﬁned by
ζ(s) =


n=1

It is interesting to consider the values of ζ(s) when s = 2, 3, 4, . . . .
The famous Euler’s formula gives
ζ(2k) = (−1)k−1 (2π)2k
2(2k)! B2k
where the numbers Bn (n ≥0) are the Bernoulli numbers, deﬁned
by the formal power series

Thus B0 = 1, B1 = −1

30, each Bn is a rational
number, and B2n+1 = 0 (for n ≥1). So, for example, ζ(2) = π2

ζ(4) = π4
90.
It follows that ζ(2k)/π2k is a rational number (for k ≥1).
In contrast, much less is known about the values ζ(2k + 1).
Ramanujan gave without proof the following formula (see his Note-
books, Vol. I , page 259, number 15 and Vol. II, page 177, number 21,
published in 1957).
Ramanujan’s discoveries, incredible formulas mostly left without
proofs, have tantalized mathematicians. The work of Ramanujan
has been the subject of authoritative books by Berndt containing
proofs and insights about likely methods behind the proofs and in-
tuitions governing Ramanujan’s mind. For these questions, see the
books and articles of Berndt (1974, 1977, 1985, 1989), Ramanu-
jan’s Notebooks, Part II, page 276 (1989). They contain the relevant
references.

The above special case had been proved by Lerch in 1901.

(1925). Many other mathematicians rediscovered and/or proved
these formulas, such as Grosswald (1970, 1972) and Smart
Katayama, Riesel, Rao, Zhang, Berndt, and Sitaramachan-

is irrational. This discovery caused a great sensation. In the words

(5) The number
γ = lim
n→∞[(1 + 1

n) −log n]
is a mathematical constant, called Mascheroni’s constant or Euler’s
constant:
γ = 0.577215665 . . .
It is not known if γ is an irrational number. Hardy stated that he
would resign his chair in Cambridge if anyone would prove that γ
is irrational—another way of saying that this was a very diﬃcult
problem (and he felt comfortably seated in Cambridge).
There are many expressions involving γ that may be derived using
the gamma-function.
In a letter to Goldbach in 1979, Euler deﬁned the gamma-
function Γ(z) by
Γ(z) = 1

n=1

(valid for every complex number z, except 0, −1, −2, . . . ). The
gamma-function is analytic everywhere except at the above points,
where it has simple poles. The function Γ(x) is also given by the
integral
Γ(x) =
 ∞
0
e−ttx−1dt,
for x real and positive, indicated by Euler. Euler’s constant γ is
equal to γ = −Γ′(1).
Dirichlet gave in 1836 the following integral expression:
γ =

Euler’s constant is also related to Riemann’s zeta function:

On the other hand, Mertens (1874) related it to the distribution

To 25 decimal places, these numbers are equal to
7.381175940895657970987266.
But are they actually equal? Even though it may seem incredible,
α = β. Namely, α = β = 4x −1, where x is the largest root of the
polynomial
f(X) = X4 −X3 −3X2 + X + 1.
Shanks advanced the following explanation. The Galois group of
f(X) is the octic group of symmetries of the square, which is gener-
ated by two elements σ, τ, with relations σ2 = 1, τ 4 = 1, στσ = τ 3
(here, 1 indicates the identity automorphism).
The resolvent of f(X) is the polynomial
g(X) = X3 −8X −7 = (X + 1)(X2 −X −7).
The polynomials f(X), g(X) have the same discriminant, equal
to 52 · 29.
The ﬁeld Q(x) contains Q(

Q(

In a letter (dated August 23, 1984) Agoh proposed a simpler
method to obtain such identities.
Let a, b be integers, a ≥0, b ≥0, such that a2 ≥4b. Let y =

b ≥0 and k = 2ay −y2. Then,
k = 2ay −y2 = y(2a −y) = (a −2

b)(a + 2

b) = a2 −4b ≥0.

Hence,

This gives

Brief historical survey
An excellent description of the historical development of the theory
of transcendental numbers may be found in Waldschmidt’s lecture
at the S´eminaire d’Historie des Math´ematiques, in Paris, 1983.
This brief account reproduces some of the contents of that lecture,
in a more succinct presentation.
First Phase. The origin of these studies may be traced to the prob-
lem of “squaring the circle”. Namely, to construct with ruler and
compass the side a of the square with the same area as the circle
with radius 1: a2 = π, so a = √π.

3 Brief historical survey
285
A nice and informative report on this problem and properties of π
may be found in the special issue of the periodical “Petit Archim`ede”,
which is dedicated to the number π (1980).
Another motivation was the discovery by Pythagoras that
√
2
is not a rational number.
Leibniz seems to be the ﬁrst mathematician who employed the
expression “transcendental number” (1704).
In 1737, using continued fractions, Euler proved that e2, hence
also e, is irrational.
If α, β are non-zero algebraic numbers which are multiplicatively
independent (that is, if αrβs = 1 with r, s integers, then r = s = 0),
then log α
log β is clearly an irrational number; in 1748, Euler stated
without proof that log α
log β is a transcendental number. This was again
considered, much later, by Hilbert.
In 1755, Euler conjectured that π is transcendental.
Lambert showed in 1761 that π is irrational. He actually proved
also that if r is a non-zero rational number, then tan r and er are
irrational.
Next, Legendre proved that π2 is irrational (1794), and Fourier
gave in 1815 an easy proof that e is irrational, using the series ex-
pansion of e (see Stainville). In 1840, Liouville extended this
method to show that e and e2 are irrational and not algebraic of
degree 2.
Second Phase.
This phase comprises the ﬁrst papers using
diophantine approximation.
In 1842, Dirichlet used the pigeon-hole principle to give results
on the approximation of irrational numbers by rationals.
In his famous papers of 1844 and 1851, Liouville constructed
a class of transcendental numbers, now called Liouville numbers,
including, for instance, the numbers
∞

n=0
kn
an! ,
where an ≥2, 0 ≤kn ≤a −1 for every n ≥0, and kn ̸= 0 for
inﬁnitely many indices n. In particular,
∞

n=0

10n!
is a transcendental number.

286

√

These results were based on Liouville’s inequality, concerning the
approximation of algebraic numbers by rationals.
Included also in this phase are the set-theoretical results of Can-
tor. He showed in 1874 that R and C are not countable sets, while
the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. Hence, the set of all
transcendental numbers is not countable.
Third Phase.
The methods of diophantine approximation were
reﬁned to allow the proofs of important results.
In 1873, Hermite showed that e is transcendental. This was the
ﬁrst number (not constructed ad-hoc) shown to be transcendental.
In 1882, Lindemann proved that π is transcendental. This im-
plied, of course, that π is not expressible by radicals, and therefore
π and √π are not constructible by ruler and compass. So, the
long-standing problem of squaring the circle had a negative solution.
In his paper, Lindemann stated other results, without proof. They
were soon after established by Hermite and Weierstrass. Linde-
mann and Hermite’s theorem is the following: If α is a non-zero
algebraic number, then eα is transcendental.
An equivalent statement is the following: If α is an algebraic
number, α ̸= 0, 1, then log α is transcendental.
The more general Lindemann and Weierstrass’s theorem states: If
α1, . . . , αn are algebraic numbers linearly independent over Q, then
eα1, . . . , eαn are algebraically independent.
These theorems were only stated by Lindemann, who did not
prove them. Instead, he turned his attention to Fermat’s Last The-
orem and published a book with a general proof of the theorem.
Unfortunately, his proof was wrong.
In 1886, Weierstrass considered the question whether a tran-
scendental function (like the exponential or circular functions) takes
transcendental values at algebraic points (excluding a few excep-
tional points). He showed that this is true for special functions, but
not true for arbitrary entire transcendental functions.
Fourth Phase. In 1900, in his 7th problem, Hilbert asked whether
the following is true: if α is any algebraic number (α ̸= 0, 1), and if
β is any irrational algebraic number, then αβ is transcendental.
This was considered by Hilbert to be a very diﬃcult problem.
Indeed, in a seminar in G¨ottingen around 1920, Hilbert went so
far as to say that no one present would live long enough to see this
question settled.

4 Continued fractions
287
Yet, in 1934, Gel’fond and Schneider independently, and with
diﬀerent methods, solved Hilbert’s 7th problem in the aﬃrmative.
In particular, eπ = (−1)−i and the number
√
2
√
2 are transcenden-
tal numbers.
At the same time, important progress was made in the theory
of diophantine approximation, by Thue (1909), Siegel (1921),
and Roth (1955), with applications to diophantine equations and
transcendental numbers.
Quite recently, beginning in 1968, Baker published a series of
fundamental papers on algebraic independence of logarithms, which
have, as corollaries, most of the classical results (see his book, 1975).
The classiﬁcation of transcendental numbers was initiated by
Mahler in 1932, but much has still to be done.
For the convenience of the reader, I summarize some of the results
concerning the numbers considered above.

Continued fractions
Continued fractions were been ﬁrst introduced by Bombelli in 1572,
in connection with the approximate calculation of square roots of
numbers which are not perfect squares. They play a rather funda-
mental role in the approximation of numbers by rational numbers, so
it is useful to summarize the relevant deﬁnitions and properties. The
proofs of all statements are easily found in textbooks such as Per-
ron (1910, 1913), Khintchine (1935), Niven (1957), and Olds
(1963).

A.
Generalities
Let α be a positive real number. I shall deﬁne the simple continued
fraction of α. Let a0 ≥0 be the unique integer such that a0 ≤α <
a0 + 1, that is, a0 = [α] is the integral part of α. If α is not an
integer, then 0 < α−a0 < 1. Let α1 =
1
α−a0 . The process is repeated
with α1, leading successively to numbers α1, α2, . . . . It terminates
in a ﬁnite number of steps if and only if α is a rational number. The
notation α = [a0, a1, a2, . . .] means that
α = a0 +
1
a1 +
1
a2 + · · ·
.
This is the simple continued fraction expansion of α. [It is called
“simple” because the “numerators” are all equal to 1; I shall not
considered continued fractions which are not simple, except for some
examples given in §2.]
Conversely, if a0 ≥0, a1, a2, . . . , are positive integers, let rn =
hn
kn = [a0, a1, . . . , an] where 1 ≤hn, kn, gcd(hn, kn) = 1. Then
r0 < r2 < r4 < · · ·
· · · < r5 < r3 < r1,
and the following limits exist and are equal to some irrational number
α = lim r2n = lim r2n−1. The simple continued fraction expansion
of α turns out to be
α = [a0, a1, a2, . . .].
The convergents rn = hn
kn of α have important properties of a good
approximation to α. More precisely:
(4.1) For every n ≥1: |α −hn
kn | <
1
knkn+1
< 1
k2
n
.
(4.2) For every n ≥1: |αkn −hn| < |αkn−1 −hn−1|, hence
α −hn
kn
 <
α −hn−1
kn−1
 .
(4.3) For every n ≥1, the convergent hn
kn is the “best approxima-
tion” with denominator at most kn, that is, if |bα −a| < |knα −hn|,
then b > kn and so if |α −a
b| < |α −hn
kn |, then b > kn.
Conversely,
(4.4) If
a
b is a best approximation of α, then
a
b is equal to a
convergent hn
kn , with n ≥0.

Periodic continued fractions
An inﬁnite simple continued fraction
α = [a0, a1, a2, . . .]
is periodic if there exists n0 ≥0, t > 0 such that an+t = an for every
n ≥n0. Choosing the smallest such t and n0, the following notation
is used:
α = [a0, . . . , an0−1, an0, an0+1, . . . , an0+t−1].
(a0, . . . , an0−1) is the pre-period, n0 is the length of the pre-period,
(an0, an0+1, . . . , an0+t−1) is the period, and t is the length of the
period. If n0 = 0, then the continued fraction is purely periodic. By
the minimal choice of n0, an0−1 ̸= an0+t−1.
Now I study the continued fraction expansion of real quadratic
irrational numbers α. Each such number may be written in the form
α = p±
√
D
q
, where p, q ̸= 0, D > 1 are integers, and D is not a
square. From p−
√
D
q
= −p+
√
D
−q
, it may be always assumed that α is
in the form p+
√
D
q
.
Moreover, if D−p2
q
is not an integer, say
D−p2
q
=
c
d, then α =
dp+
√
Dd2
dq
and now Dd2−d2p2
dq
= d D−p2
q
= c is an integer.
So, there is no loss of generality to assume that α = p+
√
D
q
and q
divides D −p2.
Euler proved (1737):
(4.5) If α has an inﬁnite periodic simple continued fraction
expansion, then α is a real quadratic irrational number.
The most important result about periodic continued fractions is
the converse. It was proved by Lagrange in 1770:
(4.6) The continued fraction expansion of every real quadratic
irrational number α is periodic.
For example, the golden number
√
5+1
2
and
√
2 have the following
continued fraction expansions:
√
5 + 1
2
= [1, 1, 1, . . .],
√
2 = [1, 2, 2, 2, . . .].

It is important to note that the simple continued fraction expan-
sions of any real algebraic number of degree higher than two seem
to have random quotients which do not remain bounded. For exten-
sive numerical calculations and statistical analysis, see the paper of
Brent, van der Poorten, and te Riele (1996) .
The next result is about purely periodic continued fractions.
The conjugate of α = p+
√
D
q
is denoted by α′ = p−
√
D
q
= −p+
√
D
−q
.
(4.7) The simple continued fraction expansion of the real quadratic
irrational number α is purely periodic if and only if 1 < α and
−1 < α′ < 0. Moreover, if 1 < α and α′ < −1, then the pre-period
has only one element.
In 1828, Galois proved:
(4.8) Let α = p+
√
D
q
with p, q ̸= 0, D > 0 integers, D not a square,
and q dividing D2 −p. Let α′ = −p+
√
D
−q

√
D
q
be its conjugate. If
α = [a0, a1, . . . , at−1], then
1
α′ = [at−1, at−2, . . . , a1, a0].
In 1828, Legendre gave the following result for the simple con-
tinued fraction expansion of
√
D, where D is a positive integer that
is not a square:
(4.9)
√
D = [a0, a1, a2, . . . , a2, a1, 2a0 ], that is, the pre-period has
length 1, the period consists of a symmetric part followed by the
double of the term in the pre-period (note that the number of terms
in the period may be even or odd).
The following result is interesting:
(4.10) If the continued fraction expansion of
√
D has period with
an odd number of terms, then D is the sum of two squares.
Fermat considered the equation X2 −DY 2 = 1 (where D > 0
is a square-free integer) and he stated that it has inﬁnitely many
solutions in natural numbers. This was ﬁrst proved by Lagrange
in 1770 using the theory of continued fractions.
(4.11) Let D > 0 be a square-free integer. Let hn
kn be the convergents
of the continued fraction of
√
D, and t the length of the period.

(1) The solutions in natural numbers of X2 −DY 2 = 1 are (1, 0)
and (hnt−1, knt−1) when t is even, and (h2nt−1, k2nt−1) when t is odd,
for all n ≥1. Thus, the equation has inﬁnitely many solutions.
(2) If t is even, the equation X2 −DY 2 = −1 has no solution
in natural numbers, while if t is odd then its solutions in natural

Simple continued fractions of π and e
Now I turn my attention to the numbers π and e.
As already indicated in §2, the simple continued fraction expansion
of π is
π = [3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, . . .].
The convergents are
3
1, 22
7 , 133
106, 355
113, 103993
33102 , 104348
33215 , 208341
66317 , 3123689
99532 , . . . .
By (4.3), the convergents are the best approximating for π. For some
convergents the actual approximation is much better than expected.

As already stated in §2, Euler gave simple inﬁnite continued
fractions for
e2/a + 1
e2/a −1
(for a ≥1)
and also for e. I shall give the proof which is pretty.
(4.12) If a ≥1 is any integer, then
e2/a + 1
e2/a −1 = [a, 3a, 5a, 7a, . . .].
In particular,
e2 + 1
e2 −1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, . . .],
e + 1
e −1 = [2, 6, 10, 14, . . .].

If α is any positive real number, and if a0, a2, . . . are positive
integers, one deﬁnes [α] = α, and by induction,
[a0, a1, . . . , an, α] = [a0, . . . , an−1, an + 1
α].
Euler ﬁrst discovered by explicit calculation, and then gave a
proof of, the continued fraction expansion of the number e; the simple
proof below is due to Hurwitz (1891b):
(4.13) e = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, . . .]
Proof.
From e+1
e−1 = [2, 6, 10, 14, . . .] it follows that
2
e −1 = e + 1
e −1 −1 = [1, 6, 10, 14, . . .],
hence
e−1
2
= [0, 1, 6, 10, 14, . . .]. One now needs to express 2 ×
[0, 1, 6, 10, 14, . . .] as a continued fraction.
If α is any real number, then 2 × [0, 2a + 1, α] = [0, a, 1, 1, α−1
2 ].
Indeed,

Now let β = [10, 14, 18, . . .] and compute

2 ] = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, β−1
2 ].
More generally, if γ = [4m + 2, 4(m + 1) + 2, . . .], then
2 × [0, 4(m −1) + 1, γ] = [1, 1, γ −1

and by induction,
e = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, . . . , 2m, 1, 1, . . .],
concluding the proof.

With the same method, Hurwitz also proved that
e2 = [7, 2, 1, 1, 3, 18, 5, 1, 1, 6, 30, 8, 1, 1, 9, 42, . . .],
and the pattern of quotients is easily recognized as being a5(m−1)+1 =
3m −1, a5(m−1)+2 = 1, a5(m−1)+3 = 1, a5(m−1)+4 = 3m, a5m =
12m + 6, for m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
With self-explanatory notation I write
e = [2, 1, 2m, 1]m>1
and
e2 = [7, 3m −1, 1, 1, 3m, 12m + 6]m≥1.
From (4.7) it follows at once that e and e2 are not roots of
quadratic equations with integer coeﬃcients.

Approximation by rational numbers
The kind of an irrational number, whether it is algebraic or transcen-
dental, depends on how well it may be approximated by rational
numbers. Thus, the concepts of approximation are central in the
study of irrational numbers.
The leading idea in this section goes back to Liouville and
Dirichlet. In 1909, Thue considered the order of approximation
of real algebraic numbers by rational numbers, while studying the
solution of certain types of diophantine equations. I shall describe
later this relationship.
A.
The order of approximation
In the next considerations, the rational numbers are written a
b where
b ≥1 and gcd(a, b) = 1.
Let α ∈R, ν ∈R, ν ≥1. The number α is said to be approximable
by rational numbers to the order ν ≥1 when there exists C > 0
(depending on α, ν) and inﬁnitely many rational numbers a
b such
that
α −a
b
 < C
bν .
Clearly, if α is approximable by rational numbers to the order ν
and ν ≥ν′ ≥1, then α is also approximable to the other ν′.
Let ν(α) = sup{ν ∈R | α is approximable by rational numbers to
the order ν}. Thus, 1 ≤ν(α) ≤∞.
One deduces at once:
(5.1) Let α ∈R.
(1) For every ϵ > 0 there exists an integer b0 ≥1 such that if a
b is
a rational number with denomonator b ≥b0, then |α −a
b| >
1
bν(α)+ϵ .
(2) For every ϵ > 0 there exists C(α, ϵ) = C > 0 such that 0 <
C < 1 and |α −a
b| >
C
bν(α)+ϵ , for all a
b ̸= α.
A ﬁrst easy remark is the following:
(5.2) Every rational number is approximable by rational numbers
to the order 1 (using any constant C > 1), but not to any order 1+ϵ
(ϵ > 0); thus, ν(α) = 1 for every α ∈Q.
I shall indicate later the theorem of Liouville on the ap-
proximation of irrational algebraic numbers by rational numbers
(see (5.9)).

The pigeon-hole principle is a very simple idea: if there are more
pigeons than holes, then some hole will have at least two pigeons.
Dirichlet put pigeons to good use in (1842). His result actually
follows from (4.2):
(5.3) If α is a real irrational number, then α is approximable by
rational numbers to the order 2 (using C = C(α, 2) = 1); explicitly,
there exist inﬁnitely many rational numbers a
b such that |α−a
b| < 1
b2 .
Thus, with the present notation, if α ∈R \ Q, then ν(α) ≥2.
In this respect, Hurwitz determined in 1891 that
1
√
5 is the best
constant in Dirichlet’s theorem. A simple proof is in Niven’s book,
1963.
(5.4) (1) For every real irrational number α, there exists inﬁnitely
many rational numbers a
b such that
|α −a
b | <
1
√
5b2 .
(2) However, if 0 < C <

5 and α = 1+

(the golden number),
then there are only ﬁnitely many rational numbers a
b satisfying |α −
a
b| < C
b2 .
B.
The Markoﬀnumbers
For each irrational number α, Perron introduced in 1921 an invari-
ant M(α). A closely related concept had been studied by Markoff
already in 1879.
Let Sα be the set of all positive numbers λ such that there exist
inﬁnitely many rational numbers a
b satisfying the inequality |α−a
b| <
1
λb2 .
Clearly, if λ ∈Sα and 0 < λ′ < λ, then λ′ ∈Sα.
Let M(α) = sup{λ | λ ∈Sα}. By (5.4),
√
5 ∈Sα; thus
√
5 ≤
M(α) for every irrational number α. Also, for the golden number,
M
	√
5 + 1

5.
The following result is easy to show:
(5.5) Let α = [a1, a1, a2, . . .]. Then M(α) < ∞if and only if the
sequence (an)n≥0 is bounded.

5 Approximation by rational numbers
297
The above result says that irrational numbers having continued
fraction expansions with unbounded quotients admit arbitrarily close
approximation by convergents.
Now I turn my attention to the possible values of M(α), for all
irrational numbers α.
The real numbers α and α′ are said to be equivalent (α ∼α′)
when there exist integers a, b, c, and d such that ad −bc = ±1
and α′ =
aα+b
cα+d. It follows that α =
−dα′+b
cα′−a , so this is indeed an
equivalence relation. Moreover, each equivalence class is either ﬁnite
or countably inﬁnite.
Hurwitz established in 1891 the following proposition:
(5.6) If α ∼α′, then M(α) = M(α′).
In general, the converse of (5.6) is not true. Yet, it is true for the
golden number:
(5.7) If α is an irrational number which is not equivalent to the
golden number, then M(α) ≥
√
8.
A full description of the values assumed by M(α) is still incom-
plete. The study of the values M(α) < 3 depends on Markoﬀ’s
equation
X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = 3XYZ.
Markoff showed in 1879 that there exist inﬁnitely many natural
numbers x with the property that there exist natural numbers y, z
such that (x, y, z) is a solution of the above equation.
These numbers are
x = 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, 169, 194, 233, 433, . . .
(the Markoﬀnumbers).
Perron showed:
The values M(α) which are less than 3 are precisely the numbers
√
9x2−4

for all Markoﬀnumbers x = 1, 2, 5, . . . . Thus they are

Furthermore, M(α) =

x
√
9x2 −4 exactly if α is equivalent to
1
2x(
√
9x2 −4 + x + 2y
z ) where (x, y, z) is a solution of Markoﬀ’s
equation. It follows that if M(α) < 3, then α ∼α′ if and only if
M(α) = M(α′). Also, if α is not a quadratic irrational number, then
M(α) ≥3.
The numbers with M(α) = 3 are those equivalent to
[2, 2, 1, 1, . . . , 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, . . . , 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, . . . , 1, . . .]
with blocks of quotients containing m1, m2, m3, . . . quotients equal
to 1, and m1 < m2 < m3 < · · ·. Since this set is uncountable, there
exists uncountably many pairwise non-equivalent transcendental
numbers α with M(α) = 3.
The study of the values M(α) > 3 is much more elaborate. For
example, M(α) cannot be in the open interval between
√
12 and
√
13.
But there are uncountably many α such that M(α) =
√
12; on the
other hand, M(α) =
√
13 exactly if α ∼3+
√

. Next, M(α) cannot
be in the open interval between

13 and 9
√
13+65

= 3.6631 . . .; the
set of all α such that M(α) = 3.6631 . . . is uncountable.
These classical results are explained well in the book of Koksma
(1936) who refers in particular to the work of Shibata (1929).
More recently (1982), Zagier studied the distribution of Markoﬀ
numbers. Let z > 0 and Z(z) = {x | x ≤z, x is a Markoﬀnumber}.
Zagier proved that #Z(z) = C log2 3x + O(log x log log2 x) with
C = 0.1807. . . . Numerical calculations indicate that the error should
be even smaller.
C.
Measures of irrationality
Let α be an irrational number; the number ν ≥1 is a measure of
irrationality of α when for every ϵ > 0 there exist only ﬁnitely many
rational numbers a
b such that |α −a
b| <
1
bν+ϵ .
So ν(α) ≤ν for every measure of irrationality ν of α. In order to
determine or estimate ν(α) one aims to ﬁnd as small a measure of
irrationality of α as possible.
Sometimes it may be simpler to determine values of ν which are
not orders of approximation for α than values which are orders of
approximation.
Here is a criterion to show that a number ν is an irrationality
measure for α:

5 Approximation by rational numbers
299
(5.8) Let α be an irrational number. Suppose that pn
qn is a sequence
of rational numbers such that for every n ≥1, qn+1 = q1+sn
n
where
sn > 0 and limn→∞sn = 0. If there exist λ, 0 < λ < 1, and C > 0
such that |α −pn
qn | <
C
q1+λ
n
for every n ≥1, then ν = 1 + 1
λ is a
measure of irrationality for α.
The proof of this criterion is simple; see for example Alladi
(1979), who gives another similar criterion.
In the next section I shall indicate measures of irrationality for
some special numbers.
D.
Order of approximation of irrational algebraic
numbers
Let α be an algebraic number of degree d ≥1, and let
f(X) = a0Xd + a1Xd−1 + · · · + ad ∈Z[X]
be the minimal polynomial of α over Q, with gcd(a0, a1, . . . , ad) = 1,
a0 ̸= 0.
Let the height of α be deﬁned as H(α) = max0≤i≤d{|ai|}, so
H(α) = ⊓f as in Chapter 1.
Let
C(α) =

d(d+1)H(α)(|α|+1)d−1
if α ∈R,
|γ|
2
if α = β + γi with β, γ ∈R, γ ̸= 0.
Liouville proved in 1844:
(5.9) If α is an algebraic number of degree d ≥1, then |α−a
b| > C(α)
bd
for every a
b ∈Q, a
b ̸= α.
Hence α is not approximable by rationals to any order d+ϵ (ϵ > 0).
So, ν(α) ≤d.
It will be seen in §7 that this result has been sharpened by Roth
to the best possible result.
Proof.
If α = β + γi with β, γ ∈R, γ ̸= 0, then
|α −a
b | = |(β −a

b ̸= α, then f(a
b) ̸= 0 because if d ≥2, then f(X)

by rational numbers. Even though the inequality provided by the
theorem is rather loose, it may still be used to prove various results
about the irrationality of speciﬁc numbers. This will be illustrated
in the next section.
6
Irrationality of special numbers
In this section I prove that several interesting numbers are irrational,
beginning with the number e.
(6.1) e and e2 are irrational numbers, which, moreover, are
not algebraic of degree 2. (And, in fact, these numbers are
transcendental.)
Proof.
As was shown in subsection C., Euler gave the continued
fraction expansions
α = e + 1
e −1 = [2, 6, 10, 14, . . .],
β = e2 + 1
e2 −1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, . . .].
So, α and β are irrational numbers, hence e and e2 are irra-
tional numbers which are not algebraic of degree 2, as follows from
Lagrange’s proposition (4.7).
2
Another proof of the irrationality of e, independent of the con-
tinued fraction expansion, was given by Fourier, and appeared in
Stainville’s book in 1815. It is based on a simple criterion:
(6.2) Let α be a real number, let (f(n))n≥0 be a sequence of positive
real numbers such that lim infn→∞f(n) = 0, and assume that there
exists n0 such that for every n ≥n0 there exist integers an and bn
such that 0 < |bnα −an| ≤f(n). Then α is irrational.
This was Fourier’s proof:
Proof.

sequence of prime numbers, then

Other irrationality criteria may be obtained using representations
of positive real numbers which generalize the decimal representa-
tion. There are several noteworthy representations, as explained for
example, in Perron’s book Irrationalzahlen.
In 1869, Cantor proved:
(6.3) Let a1, a1, a3, . . . ≥2 be integers. Then every real number α
has a unique representation.

where each ci is an integer, and for i ≥1, 0 ≤ci ≤ai −1 and
ci < ai −1 for inﬁnitely many indices i ≥1.
Conversely, every series of the above kind is convergent. Taking
ai = 10 for each i, one obtains the ordinary decimal representation.
This gives the following irrationality criterion:
(6.4) If each prime p divides inﬁnitely many ai, then α is irrational
if and only if ci ≥1 for inﬁnitely many indices i.
Note the following special cases:
(a) If each ai = i + 1 and each ci = 1, then e = 2 + ∞

indices i.
For example, α = ∞

every 0 < ϵ < µ−2, the number α is approximable by rational num-
bers to the order µ −ϵ, so α is irrational. Note that the irrationality
of α follows once again from (6.7).
Now I turn my attention to the number π.
(6.8) π2, hence also π, is an irrational number.
Proof.
The ﬁrst proof that π is irrational was given by Lambert,
while Legendre proved that π2 is irrational, as already stated in the
historical survey. The proof given below may be found in Niven’s
book. It is a modiﬁcation of his own proof that π is irrational.
I need the following lemma:
Lemma. Let g ∈Z[X] and h(X) =
Xng(X)
n!
where n ≥1. Then
h(j)(0) ∈Z for every j ≥0.
Proof.
Indeed, let Xng(X) = 
j≥0 cjXj, so cj = 0 for j < n.
From h(j)(0) = cj
j!
n! it follows that h(j)(0) ∈Z for every j ≥0.
2
Now I show that π2 is irrational.
Let h(X) = Xn(1−X)n
n!
(where n is a positive integer, to be chosen
later); then if 0 < x < 1, then 0 < h(x) < 1
n!.
Noting that h(j)(0) is an integer for j ≥0, from h(1 −X) = h(X),
it follows that h(j)(1) is also an integer for j ≥0.
If π2 = a
b with a, b > 0 relatively prime integers, let
f(X) = bn[π2nh(X) −π2n−2h(2)(X)
+ π2n−4h(4)(X) −· · · + (−1)nh(2n)(X)],
so f(0), f(1) are integers. Moreover,
d
dx[f′(x) sin πx −πf(x) cos πx] = [f′′(x) + π2f(x)] sin πx
= bnπ2n+2h(x) sin πx
= π2anh(x) sin πx,

The same method was successfully used by Niven to prove older
results about the values of trigonometric functions and hyperbolic
functions.
(6.9) If r is a non-zero rational number, then cos r is irrational.
As a corollary, π is irrational because cos π = −1 is rational.
It follows from 1 −2 sin2 r = cos 2r and cos 2r = 1−tan2 r
1+tan2 r that if
r is rational, r ̸= 0, then sin r, tan r are irrational, hence also sec r,
csc r, and cot r are all irrational.
Similarly, if r is rational, then arccos r (when r ̸= 1), and arcsin r,
arctan r (when r ̸= 0), are irrational numbers.
(6.10) If r is a non-zero rational number, then cosh r is irrational.
Since cosh 2r = 2 sinh2 r+1 = 1+tanh2 r
1−tanh2 r, then sinh r and tanh r are
irrational. It follows also that the values of the inverse hyperbolic
functions calculated at rational numbers are either 0 or irrational
numbers.
In this way, one obtains immediately a new proof of Lambert’s
result:
(6.11) (1) If r is a non-zero rational number, then er is irrational.
(2) If r is a positive rational number, r ̸= 1, then log r is irrational.
Proof.
(1) If er is rational so is e−r, hence also cosh r = er+e−r
2
,
contrary to (6.10).
(2) If r ̸= 1 and log r is rational, it is not zero, so by (1), r = elog r
would be irrational.
2
The following remark is obvious: If r is a positive rational number
and a > 1 is an integer, then loga r = log r
log a is an irrational number if
and only if r ̸= as (with s rational).

6 Irrationality of special numbers
307
Thus, for example,
log 3
log 2 is irrational. Also log10 r is irrational,
unless rm = 10n for some integers m and n.
On the other hand, it is easy to show:
(6.12) If r is a rational number, then the values of the trigonometric
functions at rπ are algebraic numbers.
Now I shall consider the question of irrationality of the values
ζ(k) = ∞
j=1
1
jk , the Riemann zeta function (for every integer k ≥2).
Since ζ(2) = π2
6 , and π2 is irrational, then so is ζ(2). Euler’s for-
mula for ζ(2k), indicated in §2, states that ζ(2k) = π2kr2k, where
r2k is a rational number. It will be indicated in §2 that π, hence also
π2k, is transcendental, therefore ζ(2k) is not only irrational but also
transcendental.
The situation is very diﬀerent for ζ(2k+1). It was an open problem
for a long time to decide whether ζ(3) was irrational. This problem
was solved in the aﬃrmative by Ap´ery as mentioned in the historical
survey. His ingenious method was applicable also for ζ(2).
(6.13) ζ(2) and ζ(3) are irrational numbers.
A very diﬀerent proof that ζ(2) and ζ(3) are irrational numbers
was given by Beukers in 1979.
Other numbers which have been considered are sums of series
built in terms of binary recurrences. Thus Andr´e-Jeannin proved
in 1991:
(6.14) If (Fn)n≥0 denotes the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, then
∞
n=1

Fn is an irrational number.
Another classical result concerning Fibonacci numbers was ob-
tained by Good (1974) and Hoggatt (1976):

A corollary of the results of Becker and T¨opfer (1994) is ap-

Ln−1 + Ln−2 (for n ≥2).

The following is indeed trivial. Let n ≥3. The following statements
are equivalent:
(1) For every rational number x > 0, the number (1 + xn)1/n is
irrational.
(2) Fermat’s Last Theorem is true for the exponent n.
Now, everyone knows (even laymen!) that Wiles proved Fermat’s
Last Theorem. Therefore, (1) holds for every n ≥3. But suppose
that someone—very intelligent—would ﬁnd a direct proof of (1) with
methods of diophantine approximations. This would constitute a new
proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. I have no ideas in this direction.
The irrationality measures of many irrational numbers have been
estimated and, in some cases, explicitly computed.
Thus ν(e) = ν(e2) = 2. Alladi showed in 1979 that ν(er) = 2 for
every non-zero rational r.
Ap´ery made calculations in 1979 that gave the following bounds
for the measure of irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3):
ν(ζ(2)) < 11.85,
ν(ζ(3)) < 13.42.
It is very important to give eﬀective lower bounds for the dis-
tance between a given irrational number and rational numbers. Some
examples to illustrate are the following:
(a) Alladi (1979), improving a previous method of Baker,

for every rational number a
b, and
π −a

b with suﬃciently large denominator.

b20.6
for every rational number a
b, and, if b > q > 96, then
π −a
b
 > 1
b20 .
So, ν(π) ≤20. Also, ν(π2) ≤17.8.
This means that ν = 30 is a measure of irrationality of π. Many
authors worked on this question and obtained improved irrationality
measures for π. I just note (without giving any hint of the method):
Mignotte, ν = 20 (in 1974), followed by the work of G. V. Chud-
novsky and D. Chudnovsky, F. Beukers, C. Viola, G. Rhin,
R. Dvornicich, E. A. Bukhadze, and M. Hata, who has the best
result up to 1993:

for all suﬃciently large b.
The calculations involved are lengthy and sharp; the veriﬁcation
requires time that only specialists can spare.

Transcendental numbers
Cantor proved that the set R of real numbers is uncountable. This
was, at the time, a very striking discovery. It is easier to show that
the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. Therefore, the set of
transcendental numbers is also uncountable, yet it is not so easy to
produce inﬁnite families of transcendental numbers, nor it is easy in
general to show that numbers of a given type are transcendental.
Once again, it will be important to consider how well the number
may be approximated by rational numbers.

A.
Liouville numbers
Liouville considered the following numbers: α ∈R \ Q is called a
Liouville number if for every integer n ≥2 there exist an
bn ∈Q, with
bn ≥2, such that |α −an
bn | <
1
bnn .
(7.1) The real number α is a Liouville number if and only if α is
approximable by rational numbers to any order ν ≥1.
In particular, α is transcendental (by Liouville’s own theo-
rem (5.9)). Thus α is a Liouville number if and only if ν(α) = ∞.
Let L denote the set of Liouville numbers.
Here are some examples of Liouville numbers: Let d ≥2, 0 ≤kn ≤
d −1 and kn ̸= 0, for inﬁnitely many indices n. Then α = ∞

These were the ﬁrst known examples of transcendental numbers.
Liouville numbers have been studied by Maillet (see his book,
1906) and have also been the subject of a chapter in Schneider’s
book (1959).
Some properties:
(7.2) The set of Liouville numbers is uncountable.
(7.3) The set of Liouville numbers is dense in R.
(7.4) The set of Liouville numbers has measure 0.
Thus “almost all” transcendental numbers are not Liouville
numbers.
Since the set of Liouville numbers is uncountable, there are
uncountably many Liouville numbers which are algebraically inde-
pendent over Q.
Perron (1932) and later Schmidt (1962) gave the following
countable set of algebraically independent Liouville numbers:
(7.5) For every i ≥1, let αi = ∞
n=1
1
2(in)! . Then α1, α2, α3, . . .
are algebraically independent over Q (that is, for every m ≥1 the
numbers α1, α2, . . . , αm are algebraically independent over Q).
It is known that e, π, and log 2 are not Liouville numbers (see §6),
however, it is unknown whether eπ is a Liouville number.
Even though it may at ﬁrst sight seem paradoxical (because the
set of Liouville numbers has measure 0), Erd¨os proved in 1962 that
every non-zero real number is the sum, and also the product, of two
Liouville numbers.
B.
Approximation by rational numbers: sharper
theorems
The theorem of Liouville (5.9) about the approximation of algebraic
numbers by rational numbers gives a loose order of approximation
which depends on the degree of the algebraic number; on the other
hand, the constant in the inequality is explicit.

The modern theory of diophantine approximation was initiated
by Thue (1909) who established a new relationship between the
solutions of certain diophantine equations and the approximation of
algebraic numbers by rational numbers.
I shall describe these ideas very succinctly.
Let d ≥3; let F(X, Y ) = a0Xd + a1Xd−1Y + a2Xd−2Y 2 + · · · +
ad−1XY d−1 + adY d be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d with
integer coeﬃcients, and assume that a0 ̸= 0. For convenience, as-
sume also that f(X) = a0Xd + a1Xd−1 + · · · + ad is an irreducible
polynomial.
If a is any integer, we consider the equation F(X, Y ) = a. The
aim is to show that this equation has only ﬁnitely many solutions in
integers.
Let α1, . . . , αd ∈C be the roots of f(X) = 0. Since f(X) is irre-
ducible, it follows that α1, . . . , αd are distinct algebraic numbers of
degree d.
If x and y are integers such that F(x, y) = a, then a0
d
k=1(x −
αky) = a.
There are two cases. If a = 0, there exists j with 1 ≤j ≤d such
that x −αjy = 0; but αj /∈Q, so y = 0 and necessarily x = 0.
Therefore, if a = 0, then the only solution is (0, 0).
On the other hand, if a ̸= 0, then
d

k=1
(x −αky) = |a|
|a0|.
Let C1 = ( |a|
|a0|)1/d, so there exists an index, therefore a smallest
index, j such that |x −αjy| ≤C1.
Let C2 = minh̸=k |αh−αk|; so C2 > 0. Note that for each integer y0
there exists at most d integers x such that (x, y0) is a solution of the
equation.
In order to show that F(X, Y ) = a has only ﬁnitely many solutions
in integers, it suﬃces to show that the set S = {solutions (x, y) : |y| >
2C1
C2 } is ﬁnite.
If (x, y) ∈S, then for every k ̸= j with j as above,
0 < C2|y|
2
< C2|y| −C1 ≤|αk −αj| · |y| −|x −αjy|
≤|(αk −αj)y −(x −αjy)| = |x −αky|.

7 Transcendental numbers

So,
|x −αky| =
|a|
|a0| 
k̸=j |x −αky| <
2d−1|a|
|a0|Cd−1
2
|y|d−1 =
C3
|y|d−1
where C3 =
2d−1|a|
|a0|Cd−1
2
(note that C3, like C1 and C2, depends only on
the given equation and not on the solution (x, y) being considered).
Writing sgn(y) = |y|
y , then
αj −x sgn(y)
|y|
=
αj −x
y
 < C3
|y|n .
For every k = 1, . . . , d, let
Tk =
m
n ∈Q | gcd(m, n) = 1
and
αk −m
n
 < C3
nd

.
It was seen that if (x, y) ∈S, then the rational number x sgn(y)
|y|
be-
longs to d
k=1 Tk. This deﬁnes a mapping Φ from S into the preceding
set. Moreover, Φ is one-to-one. Indeed, if (x, y) and (x′, y′) are in S,
and x sgn(y)
|y|
= x′ sgn(y′)
|y′|
, then |y′| = r|y| and x′ sgn(y′) = rx sgn(y)
(for some non-zero rational number r), hence a = F(x′, y′) =
±rdF(x, y) = ±rda, which implies that r = ±1, so r = 1.
Thus to show that S is ﬁnite it suﬃces to show that each set
Φ(S) ∩Tk is ﬁnite.
Let x sgn(y)
|y|
∈Tk, where (x, y) ∈S. If αk /∈R, let αk = β +iγ, with
β, γ ∈R, and γ ̸= 0. Then
|γ| ≤
(β −x
y ) + iγ
 =
αk −x sgn(y)
|y|
 < C3
|y|d ,
hence
|y|d < C3
|γ|.
So |y| may have only ﬁnitely many values, and by a previous
remark, the same is true for x, so Φ(S) ∩Tk is ﬁnite.
If αk ∈R, one is led to study whether the set Tk is ﬁnite.
This established the link between the approximation of algebraic
numbers by rational numbers and the ﬁniteness of the number
of solutions of the equation considered above. For a survey on

some fundamental methods on the theory of diophantine equations,
see Ribenboim (1986).
Sharper and eﬀective inequalities will therefore have important
indications on the the number and size of solutions. Thus, important
mathematicians considered this problem.
For this purpose, Liouville’s theorem was improved successively
by Thue (1909), Siegel (1921), Dyson (1947), and Schneider
(1949); ﬁnally, Roth proved in 1955 the best possible result:
(7.6) If α is any algebraic number, for every ϵ > 0 there exists
C = C(α, ϵ) > 0 such that for every rational number a
b ̸= α one has
|α −a
b| >
C
b2+ϵ .
So, α is not approximable by rational numbers to the order 2 + ϵ
for every ϵ > 0. Therefore, ν(α) ≤2. Thus, if α /∈Q, then ν(α) = 2
(as follows from Dirichlet’s theorem).
A corollary is the following transcendence criterion:
(7.7) If α is a real number which is approximable by rational
numbers to an order ν > 2, then α is transcendental.
If α has degree at least 3, the number C(α, ϵ) in (7.6) is not
eﬀectively computable; the proposition only asserts its existence.
Consider the following statement, which is sharper than Roth’s
theorem: If α is any algebraic number, there exists C(α) > 0 such
that for every rational number a
b ̸= α one has |α −a
b| > C(α)
b2 . It may
be shown that the above statement is equivalent to the following
assertion, which is as yet unproven:
If α is any real algebraic number and α = [a0, a1, a2, . . .] is its
simple continued fraction expansion, then there exists a number M =
M(α) > 0 such that |a0|, a1, a2, . . . < M.
However, it is generally believed that the above statement is false.
Rather, on the contrary, it is quite possible that if α is a real algebraic
number of degree d ≥3 then, using the above notation, it follows
that sup{ai | i ≥1} = ∞.
Now I consider some examples.
Example 1. Up to now it is not known whether α = ∞

a transcendental number (where d ≥2, s ≥2). For s = 2 this may
require a deeper study of theta functions.

a Liouville number. More generally, Bundschuh showed (1970): if
d ≥2 then ∞
n=0
1
dn2 is not a Liouville number.
Example 2. Let s ≥3 be an integer, d ≥2, and α = ∞
n=0
1
dsn .
Then α is transcendental.
Indeed, it was seen in §6 that α is approximable by rational
numbers to the order s. Since s > 2, by (7.7), α is transcendental.
More generally:
Example 3. Let (f(n))n≥1 be a sequence of positive integers such
that limn→∞
f(n+1)
f(n)
= µ > 2. Then for every integer d ≥2, the
number α = ∞
n=0
1
df(n) is transcendental.
Indeed, as was seen in §6, if 0 < ϵ < µ −2, α is approx-
imable by rational numbers to the order µ −ϵ > 2. By (7.7), α
is transcendental.
The following was ﬁrst proved by Mahler (1929) and may also
be proved with a variant of Roth’s theorem:
Example 4. α = ∞
n=0
1
d2n (with d ≥2) is transcendental.
More generally:
Example 5. Let r ∈Q, r ̸= 0, C ≥1, d ≥2, s ≥2 be integers.
For every n let cn be an integer such that |cn| ≤Cn and cn ̸= 0 for
inﬁnitely many n ≥1. Then ∞
n=0
cnrn
dsn is transcendental.
Mahler extended this construction in 1976. Let f be any func-
tion deﬁned on the integers. Let α be the number between 0 and 1
whose decimal expression is the following: f(1) times the digit 1,
followed by f(1) times the digit 2, . . . , followed by f(1) times the
digit 9, followed by f(2) times the 2-digit number 10, . . . , followed
by f(2) times the 2-digit number 99, followed by f(3) times each
of the numbers 100, 101, . . . , 999 in succession, etc. The resulting
numbers α are transcendental numbers but not Liouville numbers.
For every µ > 2 let Rµ = {α ∈R | ν(α) ≥µ}. Thus every α ∈Rµ
is transcendental. Moreover, L = 4
µ>2 Rµ.
Since L is uncountable and dense in R, then each Rµ is uncountable
and dense, too.
Mahler (1937) gave a class of transcendental numbers which are
not Liouville numbers:

(7.8) Let f(X) ∈Z[X] be a polynomial of degree at least 1, such
that f(k) ≥1 for every k ≥1. Let a = 0.a1a2a3a4 . . . with ak = f(k)
(the notation becomes clear in the example which follows). Then α
is transcendental, but not a Liouville number.
For example, if f(X) = X this gives: 0.12345678910111213 . . . is
transcendental but not a Liouville number.
In 1924, Khintchine proved a general theorem on approximation
by rational numbers (see also his book (1935)). A special case is the
following:
(7.9) For every µ > 2, the set Rµ has measure 0.
Example 6. (Knuth (1964)) Let a ≥2 be an integer and let ξa be
the irrational number with simple continued fraction expansion
ξa = [aF0, aF1, aF2, . . .]
where (Fn)n≥0 is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. Then ξa is
approximable by rational numbers to the order α+1, where α = 1+
√

is the golden number. Hence, ξa ∈Rα+1 and is transcendental.
C.
Hermite, Lindemann, and Weierstrass
Now I give the important and classical results of Hermite and
Lindemann.
In 1873, Hermite showed
(7.10) e is a transcendental number.
A rather simple proof of this theorem, given by Hurwitz in 1893,
is reproduced in Niven’s book.
In 1882, Lindemann proved the following equivalent results (this
improves (6.11)):
(7.11) (1) If log is any determination of the complex logarithmic
function, and if r is a rational number, r ̸= 0, then log r is 0 or
transcendental.
(2) If α is an algebraic number, α ̸= 0, then eα is irrational.
The equivalence of these assertions is obvious. In particular,
Lindemann obtained:

7 Transcendental numbers
317
(7.12) π is transcendental.
If π is algebraic, so is iπ ̸= 0, hence eiπ = −1 would be irrational,
a contradiction.
This important result gave a negative solution to the problem of
squaring the circle.
For other proofs that e and π are transcendental, see for example,
Popken (1929a,b), Veblen (1904), and Schenkman (1970).
Hermite gave a proof of the following theorem which extends
(7.11) and was stated by Lindemann:
(7.13) (1) If log is any determination of the complex logarithmic
function, and if α is a non-zero algebraic number, then log α is
either 0 or transcendental.
(2) If α is an algebraic number, α ̸= 0, then eα is transcendental.
The following results which improve previous statements follow as
consequences:
(7.14) If α is an algebraic number, α ̸= 0, then cos α, sin α, tan α,
cosh α, sinh α, tanh α are transcendental numbers.
Weierstrass gave a proof of the following theorem stated by
Lindemann:
(7.15) If α1, . . . , αn are distinct algebraic numbers, then eα1,
. . . , eαn are linearly independent over the ﬁeld of all algebraic
numbers.
For example, taking n = 2, α2 = 0, one obtains the theorem of
Lindemann and Hermite.
This theorem admits the following equivalent formulation, which
is a result of algebraic independence.
(7.16) If α1, . . . , αn are algebraic numbers which are linearly in-
dependent over Q, then eα1, . . . , eαn are algebraically independent
over Q.
A very useful tool in the modern proof of the theorems of Lin-
demann and Weierstrass is the following result of linear algebra,
known as Siegel’s lemma.

A result of Siegel on exponentials
The following interesting result, which is a special case of a theorem
of Siegel, is evoked in a paper of Halberstam. It was proposed in
the 1972 Putnam Competition and not one of the 2000 candidates
could solve it. I give its proof below, following Halberstam’s article.
(7.18) If α is a real positive number and 2α, 3α, 5α, . . . , pα, . . . are
integers (for every prime p), then α is an integer.
Proof.
From the hypothesis, it follows that nα is an integer for
every integer n.
If α is not an integer, let k = [α], so 0 ≤k < α < k + 1. The
method of proof involves ﬁnite diﬀerences.
If f(x) is an indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable function of the real
variable x, let
∆f(x) = f(x + 1) −f(x).

7 Transcendental numbers
319
So there exists θ1, 0 < θ1 < 1, such that
∆f(x) = f′(x + θ1).
(Note that θ1 depends on x.)
Similarly, let
∆2f(x) = ∆(∆f(x))=∆f(x+1)−∆f(x) = f(x+2)−2f(x+1)+f(x).
It is also equal to
∆2f(x) = f′(x + 1 + θ1) −f′(x + θ1) = f′′(x + θ2),
where 0 < θ1 < θ2 < 2 (θ2 depends on x, θ1).
More generally, if r ≥1, let ∆rf(x) = ∆(∆r−1f(x)), so
∆rf(x) =
r

i=0
(−1)r−i

f(x + i) = f(r)(x + θr),

i=0
r


(−1)r−i(x + i)α,
hence ∆rxα is an integer for every integer x > 0. But it is also equal
to
∆rxα = α(α −1) · · · (α −r + 1)(x + θ)α−r,
where 0 < θ < r. Taking r = k + 1, x = n, and writing (∆rxα)(n) =
∆rnα, one has
∆k+1nα = α(α −1) · · · (α −k + 1)(α −k)(n + θ)α−k−1,
with 0 < θ < k + 1. Thus,
0 < ∆k+1nα = α(α −1) · · · (α −k)

αk+1
nk+1−α < 1
provided n > α

Actually, Siegel proved the following theorem:
(7.19) If α is a real positive number and if there exist three distinct
prime numbers p1, p2, p3 such that pα
1 , pα
2 , pα
3 are algebraic numbers,
then α ∈Q.
Or, equivalently, if α > 0, and if α is not rational, then there are
at most two primes p1, p2 such that pα
1 , pα
2 , are algebraic numbers.

Hilbert’s 7th problem
As already mentioned in the historical survey, Hilbert’s 7th problem
was solved independently and simultaneously by Gel’fond and by
Schneider in 1934.
First, I note the following equivalent formulations:
(7.20) The following statements are equivalent:
(1) If α, β are algebraic numbers, α ̸= 0, and log α ̸= 0, and β is
irrational, then αβ = exp(β log α) is transcendental.
(2) If α, β
∈Qalg, α, β
̸= 0, and if log α, log β are lin-
early independent over Q, then log α, log β are linearly independent
over Qalg.
(3) If β, λ ∈C, λ ̸= 0, β /∈Q, then one of the numbers eλ, β, eβλ
is transcendental.
Proof.
(1) ⇒(2). Let α, β ∈Qalg, with α, β ̸= 0, 1, and assume
that log α, log β are are linearly independent over Q. If there exists
γ, δ ∈Qalg, with δ ̸= 0 (for example) such that γ log α + δ log β = 0,
then γ ̸= 0 and log α
log β = −γ
δ = µ ∈Qalg with µ /∈Q. By (1), αµ
is transcendental. However, αµ = eµ log α = elog β = β, which is a
contradiction.
(2) ⇒(3). Let β, λ ∈C, with λ ̸= 0, β /∈Q, and assume that eλ, β,
eβλ are algebraic numbers. Note that λ, βλ are linearly independent
over Q. By (2), λ, βλ are also linearly independent over Qalg, hence
β = βλ
β is transcendental, which is a contradiction.
(3) ⇒(1). Let α ∈Qalg, with α ̸= 0, 1, and let β ∈Qalg \ Q.
Let λ = log α ̸= 0. Since α = eλ and β are algebraic numbers, then
by (3), eβλ = eβ log α = αβ is transcendental.
2
The theorem of Gel’fond and Schneider is the following:
(7.21) If α ∈Qalg, α ̸= 0, log α ̸= 0, and if β ∈Qalg \ Q, then αβ is
a transcendental number.
With this theorem one deduces that
√
2
√
2 is a transcendental
number, thus the question which motivated this chapter is solved.
But one sees also that if a, b are integers such that am ̸= bn (for all
non-zero integers m, n), then log a
log b is transcendental (this had been
conjectured already by Euler).
Similarly,

321
(7.22) eπ is a transcendental number.
Proof.
Since i, eiπ = −1 are algebraic numbers, by (3) above, eπ
is transcendental.

Already in 1932, Koksma and Popken had shown that eπ is
transcendental. The methods of Gel’fond and of Schneider have
been used to prove that other numbers are transcendental.

The work of Baker
Baker began in 1968 to publish a series of penetrating papers on
eﬀective lower bounds of linear forms in logarithms. Here I shall
be content to quote, among his results, those which are most di-
rectly relevant to the theory of transcendental numbers. Baker’s
own book (1975) is highly recommended for more results and proofs.
(7.23) Let α1, . . . , αn be non-zero algebraic numbers. If log α1,
. . . , log αn are linearly independent over Q, then 1, log α1, . . . , log αn
are linearly independent over Qalg.
This result contains many important corollaries, which are quite
easy to derive.
(7.24) If α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βn are algebraic numbers, α1, . . . , αn
non-zero, and if θ = n
i=1 βi log αi ̸= 0, then θ is transcendental.
Proof.
If θ were an algebraic number, then it follows that (−θ) ×
1+ n
i=1 βi log αi = 0, so log α1, . . . , log αn would be linearly depen-
dent over Qalg, hence also over Q. So, there exist r1, . . . , rn ∈Q, not
all equal to 0, such that n
i=1 ri log αi = 0. Suppose, for example,
rn ̸= 0; then
0 = rn(−θ +

i=1
βi log αi)
= rn(−θ) + (rnβ1 −r1βn) log α1 + (rnβ2 −r2βn) log α2
+ · · · + (rnβn−1 −rn−1βn) log αn−1.
Proceeding by induction on n, it follows that rnθ is transcendental
and θ could not be algebraic.
2
(7.25) If n ≥0 and α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βn are non-zero algebraic
numbers, then eβ0αβ1
1 · · · αβn
n
is transcendental.

Proof.
If θ = eβ0αβ1
1 · · · αβn
n
is algebraic, then β1 log α1 + · · · +
βn log αn −log θ = −β0 ̸= 0 is algebraic, which contradicts the
preceding proposition.
2
The following lemma will be required in the next proposition:
Lemma. If γ1, . . . , γm, δ1, . . . , δm, for n ≥1, are algebraic numbers
such that each γi ̸= 0, 1, and δ1, . . . , δm are linearly independent
over Q, then m
i=1 δi log γi ̸= 0.
Proof.
If m = 1 it is true. Proceeding by induction on m, if
m
i=1 δi log γi = 0, then log γ1, . . . , log γm are linearly dependent
over Qalg, hence by (7.22) they are linearly dependent over Q.
So there exist r1, . . . , rm
∈Q, not all equal to 0, such that
m
i=1 ri log γi = 0. For example, rm ̸= 0, hence
m−1

i=1
rmδi log γi = −rmδm log γm = δm(
m−1

i=1
ri log γi),
thus
m−1

i=1
(rmδi −δmri) log γi = 0.
But rmδ1 −δmr1, . . . , rmδm−1 −δmrm−1 are linearly independent
over Q, as easily seen.
By induction, this is a contradiction.
2
(7.26) If α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βn are algebraic numbers, such that
each αi ̸= 0, 1, and 1, β1, . . . , βn are linearly independent over Q,
then αβ1
1 · · · αβn
n
is transcendental.
Proof.
If θ = αβ1
1 · · · αβn
n
is algebraic, then θ ̸= 0 and also θ ̸= 1,
otherwise n
i=1 βi log αi = 0, which is contrary to the lemma. So,
n
i=1 βi log αi −log θ = 0.
But 1, β1, . . . , βn are linearly independent over Q, which
contradicts the lemma.
2
(7.27) If α is any non-zero algebraic number, then π + log α is
transcendental.
Proof.
From eiπ = −1 it follows that π = −i log(−1). If π +
log α = β ∈Qalg, then −i log(−1) + log α −β. So, log(−1), log α,

7 Transcendental numbers
323
1 are linearly dependent over Qalg, hence log(−1), log α are linearly
dependent over Q, by (7.22). So, there exist integers m, n, not
both 0, such that m log(−1) + n log α = 0. If n = 0, then m ̸=
0, and so log(−1) = 0, hence π = 0, a contradiction. So n ̸= 0,
and (−1)mαn = 1 implies α2n = 1, thus 2n log α = 2kiπ (for some
integer k), hence β = π + πik, so π would be an algebraic number.
Thus iπ is algebraic, hence by (7.21) it follows that −1 = eiπ would
be transcendental, which is absurd.
2
I remark that (7.24) contains the theorem of Lindemann and
Hermite, (7.25) contains the theorem of Gel’fond and Schnei-
der, while (7.26) contains as a special case the transcendence of π.
All this shows the strength of Baker’s theorem.
Another important fact of Baker’s theorem concerns the eﬀective
determination of lower bounds for the linear forms in logarithms and
the applications to eﬀective determination of solutions of wide classes
of diophantine equations.
Regretably, I will not treat this connection here.
G.
The conjecture of Schanuel
The proof that speciﬁc transcendental numbers are algebraically in-
dependent over Q is rarely a simple task. So, it is advantageous to
imagine what should be true.
In his book of 1966, Lang ennunciated an interesting conjecture
of Schanuel. First, I recall some terminology.
Let L be a ﬁeld extension of the ﬁeld K (I shall be mostly
concerned with the case where K = Q (or Qalg).
Suppose that there exist n elements α1, . . . , αn ∈L with the
following properties:
(1) α1, . . . , αn are algebraically independent over K; that is, if f ∈
K[X1, . . . , Xn] and f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0, then f is the zero polynomial;
(2) if β ∈L, then β is algebraic over the ﬁeld K(α1, . . . , αn),
generated by α1, . . . , αn.
In this case, {α1, . . . , αn} is a transcendence basis of L|K. It may
be shown that any other transcendence basis has the same number n
of elements. This number n is called the transcendence degree of L|K
and denoted by tr deg(L|K).
If L = K(α1, . . . , αn), then tr deg(L|K) ≤n, and there exists
a subset of {α1, . . . , αn} which is a transcendence basis of L|K.

324
10. What Kind of Number Is
√
2
√
2?
Moreover, if tr deg(L|K) = n, then {α1, . . . , αn} is a transcendence
basis.
I note also that
tr deg(Q(α1, . . . , αn)|Q) = tr deg(Qalg(α1, . . . , αn)|Qalg)
(where α1, . . . , αn are any complex numbers).
Schanuel’s conjecture is the following:
Conjecture (S).
If α1, . . . , αn
∈
C are linearly independent
over Q, then tr deg(Q(α1, . . . , αn, eα1, . . . , eαn)|Q) ≥n.
This conjecture is true, for example, when α1, . . . , αn ∈Qalg. In-
deed, under this additional hypothesis, (S) becomes the theorem of
Lindemann and Weierstrass.
There are many interesting conjectures about transcendental num-
bers which follow more or less readily from the all-embracing
Schanuel’s conjecture.
Gel’fond proposed:
Conjecture (S1).
If α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βn ∈Qalg, with each βi ̸=
0, if α1, . . . , αn are linearly independent over Q and log β1,
. . . , log βn are also linearly independent over Q, then eα1, . . . , eαn,
log β1, . . . , log βn are algebraically independent over Qalg.
Indeed, (S) implies (S1) because
tr deg(Qalg(eα1, . . . , eαn, log β1, . . . , log βn)|Qalg)
= tr deg(Qalg(α1, . . . , αn, eα1, . . . , eαn, log β1, . . . , log βn,
β1, . . . , βn)|Qalg)
= 2n,
hence eα1, . . . , eαn, log β1, . . . , log βn are algebraically independent
over Qalg.
A special case of conjecture (S1) is the following:
Conjecture (S2).
If β1, . . . , βn ∈Qalg with each βi ̸= 0, and
if log β1, . . . , log βn are linearly independent over Q, then log β1,
. . . , log βn are algebraically independent over Qalg.
I recall that Baker proved Proposition (7.21) which is weaker
than conjecture (S2).
The following conjecture is also a consequence of (S):

7 Transcendental numbers
325
Conjecture (S3).
If α, β1, . . . , βn ∈Qalg, α ̸= 0, 1, and 1, β1,
. . . , βn are linearly independent over Q, then log α, αβ1, . . . , αβn
are algebraically independent over Qalg.
Indeed, log α, β1 log α, . . . , βn log α are linearly independent
over Q, hence,
tr deg(Qalg(log α, β1 log α, . . . , βn log α, α, αβ1, . . . , αβn)|Qalg)≥n+1.
Since α, β1, . . . , βn ∈Qalg, then necessarily log α, αβ1, . . . , αβn are
algebraically independent over Q.
The special case of (S3) when n = 1 is the conjecture:
Conjecture (S4).
If α, β ∈Qalg, α ̸= 0, 1, and β /∈Q, then
log α, αβ are algebraically independent over Qalg.
The following special case of (S3) is a conjecture of Gel’fond:
Conjecture (S5).
If α, β ∈Qalg, and if β has degree d ≥2, then
tr deg(Q(αβ, . . . , αβd−1)|Q) = d −1.
Now, 1, β, β2, . . . , βd−1 are linearly independent over Q; by (S3),
log α, αβ, . . . , αβd−1 are algebraically independent over Q, hence
tr deg(Q(αβ, . . . , αβd−1)|Q) = d −1.
The following conjecture, which follows also from (S), was stated
in special cases by Lang and Ramachandra:
Conjecture (S6).
If α1, . . . , αn are linearly independent over Q,
and β is a transcendental number, then
tr deg(Q(eα1, . . . , eαn, eα1β, . . . , eαnβ)|Q) ≥n −1.
I show that (S6) follows from (S): order the numbers α1, . . . , αn
in such a way that a basis of the Q-vector space generated by
{α1, . . . , αn, βα1, . . . , βαn} is {α1, . . . , αn, βα1, . . . , βαm} where 0 ≤
m ≤n. Then tr deg(Q(α1, . . . , αn, β)|Q) ≤m + 1. Indeed, since β is
transcendental, there is a transcendence basis of Q(α1, . . . , αn, β)|Q
which is {αi1, . . . , αis, β} (with 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < is ≤n);
then α1, . . . , αn, βαi1, . . . , βαis are linearly independent over Q, so
s + n ≤m + n, hence s ≤m, as required.
On the other hand, from (S) one deduces that
tr deg(Q(α1, . . . , αn, βα1, . . . , βαm, eα1, . . . , eαn, eβα1, . . . , eβαm)|Q)
≥n + m,

hence also
tr deg(Q(α1, . . . , αn, βα1, . . . , βαn, eα1, . . . , eαn, eβα1, . . . , eβαn)|Q)
≥n + m.
Comparing with the transcendence degree of Q(α1, . . . , αn, β)|Q,
it follows that at least n −1 of the numbers eαi, eαiβ (i = 1, . . . , n)
are algebraically independent.
Here is another interesting consequence of (S) (log denotes the
principle value of the logarithm).
Conjecture (S7).
The numbers e, eπ, ee, ei, π, ππ, πe, πi, 2π,
2e, 2i, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2, (log 2)log 3, 2
√
2 are algebraically
independent over Q (and, in particular, they are transcendental).
Proof.
I begin by noting that iπ, log 2 are linearly independent
over Q. By (S), tr deg(Q(iπ, log 2, −1, 2|Q)) = 2, so iπ, log 2 are
algebraically independent over Q; hence so are π and log 2. Therefore,
2, 3, π, log 2 are multiplicatively independent: if 2a3bπc(log 2)d = 1
(with a, b, c, d ∈Z), then a = b = c = d = 0. Thus, log π, log 2,
log 3, log log 2 are linearly independent over Q. Hence, also iπ, log π,
log 2, log 3, log log 2 are linearly independent over Q. By (S),
tr deg(Q(iπ, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2, −1, π, 2, 3, log 2)|Q) = 5,
thus π, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2 are algebraically independent
over Q. Hence 1, iπ, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2 are linearly
independent over Q. By (S),
tr deg(Q(1, iπ, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2, e, −1, π, 2, 3, log 2)|Q) = 6,
hence e, π, log π, log 2, log 3, log log 2, are algebraically indepen-
dent. So 1, iπ, π, log π, e, e log π, π log π, log 2, π log 2, e log 2,
i log 2, i, i log π, log 3, log log 2, (log 3)(log log 2),
√
2 log 2 are linearly
independent over Q. By (S),
tr deg(Q(iπ, π, log π, e, e log π, π log π, log 2, π log 2, e log 2, i log 2,
i, i log π, log 3, log log 2, (log 3)(log log 2),

π /∈K.
Lang sketched a proof of how this conjecture is a consequence
of (S).
There have been the classical results of algebraic independence,
by Hermite, Weierstrass and the more recent results of Baker,
all involving the experimental and the logarithmic function. For a
long time it was desirable to obtain an algebraic independence result
involving the gamma function Γ(x).
In a tour de force, culminating deep research on algebraic inde-
pendence, Nesterenko established the result below 1997 (see also
Gramain (1998)):
(7.28) The numbers π, eπ, Γ(1
4) are algebraically independent
over Q.
This theorem was hailed by experts in the ﬁeld and by broadly
informed mathematicians. In other circles of mathematicians—and
good ones at that—one wondered why time and energy should be
spent on questions of no practical importance, such as this one. And
for that matter, about transcendental numbers like

Mathematics has the unique character of being a scientiﬁc disci-
pline with applications to all kinds of other sciences and to practical
life. But mathematics is also an art, the beauty lying in the symme-
tries, patterns, and intricately deep relationships which enchant the
beholder. Discoveries that require the invention of new methods and
great ingenuity are indeed to be hailed as important—at least from
one point of view. Will these be of any practical use some day? Is
it a legitimate question? Indeed, numerous are the examples when
theories seemed for centuries to be gratuitous speculations, like the
study of prime numbers, but today a mainstay of crucial applications
in communications. It is the intrinsic quality of a new result which
confers its importance.

Transcendence measure and the classiﬁcation of
Mahler
To classify the complex numbers, Mahler considered the values of
polynomial expressions and measured how close to zero they may
become.
Let n ≥1, H ≥1 be integers, let Zn,H[X] be the set of all poly-
nomials f(X) ∈Z[X] of degree at most n and height at most H;
i.e., f(X) = n
i=0 aiXi, with ai ∈Z and max{|ai|} ≤H. The set
Zn,H[X] is clearly ﬁnite.
If α ∈C, let
wn,H(α) = min{|f(α)| : f ∈Zn,H[X] and f(α) ̸= 0}.
Taking f(X) = 1, one has 0 < wn,H(α) ≤1. Also, if n ≤n′,
H ≤H′, then wn,H(α) ≥wn′,H′(α).
Let wn(α) = lim supH→∞
−log wn,H(α)
log H
for all n ≥1, and let w(α) =
lim supn→∞
wn(α)
n
.
Thus 0 ≤wn(α) ≤∞and wn(α) ≤wn+1(α) for n ≥1. Hence
0 ≤w(α) ≤∞.
Let µ(α) = inf{n | wn(α) = ∞}, so 1 ≤µ(α) ≤∞, and if µ(α) <
∞, then w(α) = ∞.
This leads to the following partition of complex numbers into four
disjoint classes, proposed by Mahler (1930, 1932b):
(1) α is an A-number when w(α) = 0, µ(α) = ∞;
(2) α is an S-number when 0 < w(α) < ∞, µ(α) = ∞;
(3) α is a T-number when w(α) = ∞, µ(α) = ∞;
(4) α is a U-number when w(α) = ∞, µ(α) < ∞.
Mahler proved:
(7.29) α is an A-number if and only if it is an algebraic number.
Moreover:
(7.30) If α, β are numbers in diﬀerent classes, then α, β are
algebraically independent.
The S-numbers may be classiﬁed according to their type, which
I deﬁne now. From w(α) < ∞it follows that the sequence wn(α)
n
is
bounded above, so there exists t > 0 such that
lim sup
H→∞
−log wn,H(α)
log H
= wn(α) < tn

for every n ≥1. Hence, for every ϵ > 0 there exists H0 ≥1
(depending on n, t, ϵ) such that
−log wn,H(α)
log H
< n(t + ϵ) for all
H > H0. Hence, wn,H(α) > H−n(t+ϵ) for H > H0. Choosing
cn = min1≤H≤H0{1, 1
2wn,H(α)Hn(t+ϵ)}, then wn+1(α) >
cn
Hn(t+ϵ) for
all H ≥1. Thus, there exists θ > 0 such that for every n ≥1 there
exists cn > 0 satisfying wn,H(α) >
cn
Hn−θ for all H ≥1.
The type α is deﬁned to be the inﬁmum of all θ with the above
property. It may be shown that θ(α) = supn≥1{ wn(α)
n
}.
Now I investigate the cardinality and measure of the sets of S-
numbers, T-numbers and U-numbers.
In 1932, Mahler showed that the sets of real, respectively com-
plex, S-numbers have measure 1 (in the sense of linear, respectively
plane Lebesgue measure). The following more precise statement was
conjectured by Mahler in the same paper.
Using a classiﬁcation given by Koksma, in analogy to Mahler’s
classiﬁcation, Sprindˇzuk proved Mahler’s conjecture in 1965:
(7.31) (1) All real numbers (with the exception of a subset with
measure 0 in R) are S-numbers of type 1.
(2) All complex numbers (with the exception of a subset with
measure 0 in C) are S-numbers of type 1
2.
So, the set of S-numbers is uncountable.
Yet, it is not generally straightforward to give examples of S-
numbers and a fortiori to compute their type.
Mahler showed that α = 0.123456789101112 . . . (already consid-
ered in subsection B., Example 5) is an S-number.
For many years it was not known whether the set of T-numbers
was empty or not. Schmidt showed in 1968 (without exhibiting an
explicit example) that the set of T-numbers is not empty. He gave a
simpler proof in 1969.
As for the U-numbers, an easy characterization implies readily:
(7.32) Every Liouville number is a U-number.
Moreover, LeVeque showed (1953):
(7.33) For every integer µ ≥1, there exists a U-number α such that
µ(α) = µ.
It follows that the set of U-numbers is uncountable, even though
it has measure zero (by (7.30)).

In 1971, 1972, Mahler modiﬁed his classiﬁcation of transcen-
dental numbers; various problems arising from the new set-up were
solved by Durand in 1974.
Now I introduce the concept of transcendence measure of a
transcendental number.
The function T(n, H) (with real positive values), deﬁned for inte-
gers n ≥1, H ≥1, is a transcendence measure for the transcendental
number α if |f(α)| ≥T(n, H) for every f ∈Zn,H[X].
The best transcendence measure is, of course, wn,H(α) as deﬁned
above by Mahler. However, it is usually very diﬃcult to calculate.
I indicate some results about transcendence measures for numbers
like e, π, log r (r rational, r ̸= 1, r > 0).
Borel (1899) and Popken (1929a) gave transcendence measures
for e.
In particular, Popken’s result implied that e is not a Liouville
number. It should be noted that this may be also proved from the
continued fraction expansion of e, which implies that
e −a
b
 ≥log log(4b)
18 log(4b)b2
for all rational numbers a
b, b > 0 (see also Bundschuh (1971)).
Mahler proved in 1932:
(7.34) For every n ≥1 there exists H0(n) ≥1 such that if H >
H0(n), then
|f(e)| >
1
Hn+Cn2 log(n+1)
log log H
for every f(X) ∈Zn,H[X], where C > 0 is a constant, independent
of n and H.
It follows that
(7.35) e is an S-number of type θ(e) = 1; hence e is not a Liouville
number.
Next, Mahler showed (1932):
(7.36) Let α = π or α = log r where r is a positive rational num-
ber, r ̸= 1. Then, for every n ≥1 and H ≥1, |f(α)| > C(n)
Hsn for
every f(X) ∈Zn,H[X], where C(n) > 0 and s > 0 is a constant,
independent of n, H.

It follows that
(7.37) π and log r (r rational, r > 0, r ̸= 1) are not U-numbers,
hence they are not Liouville numbers.
For more information on transcendence measures, the reader may
consult the paper of Waldschmidt (1978).

Final comments
It is preferable now to interrupt this survey lest it become too tiring
for the reader (but never for me). Apart from the fact that many
topics evoked in the survey were no more than evoked, there are
many aspects which were completely ignored: metric problems con-
cerning continued fractions, normal numbers, uniform distribution
modulo 1, questions of irrationality and transcendence of values of
entire function, of certain meromorphic functions, or of functions
which are solutions of certain types of diﬀerential equations. Nor did
I touch on questions of simultaneous approximations, nor did I . . . .
Fortunately, there are many books and surveys on various as-
pects of the theory (some of these have already been cited):
Maillet (1906) (the ﬁrst book devoted to transcendental num-
bers), Minkowski (1907), Perron (1910, 1913), Khintchine
(1935), Koksma (1936), Siegel (1949), Gel’fond (1952), Niven
(1956), Cassels (1957), Schneider (1957), Mahler (1961, 1976a),
Niven (1963), Lang (1966), Lipman (1966), Fel’dman (1967), Ra-
machandra (1969), Schmidt (1972), Waldschmidt (1974, 1979),
Baker (1975), and Mignotte (1976).
I hope that the reader derived some enjoyment and that the
present survey has stimulated the desire for further studies of
numbers.

Galimatias Arithmeticae∗
You may read in the Oxford English Dictionary that galimatias
means confused language, meaningless talk. This is what you must
expect in this talk. As a token of admiration to Gauss, I dare to
append the word Arithmeticae to my title. I mean no oﬀense to the
Prince, who, at age 24, published Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, that
imperishable masterwork.
As I retire (or am hit by retirement), it is time to look back at
events in my career. Unlike what most people do, I would rather
talk about mathematical properties and problems of some numbers
connected with highlights of my life. I leave for the end the most
striking conjunction.
I will begin with the hopeful number 11 and end with the ominous
number 65.
∗This chapter is a modiﬁed version of a talk at the University of Munich,
given in November 1994 at a festive colloquium in honor of Professor Sibylla
Priess-Crampe.

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
345
11
• At age 11 I learned how to use x to represent an unknown quan-
tity in order to solve problems like this one: “Three brothers,
born two years apart, had sums of ages equal to 33. What are
their ages?” The power of the method was immediately clear to
me and determined that I would be interested in numbers, even
after my age would surpass the double of the sum of the ages of
the three brothers.
But 11 is interesting for many better reasons.
• 11 is the smallest prime repunit. A number with n digits all equal
to 1 is called a repunit and denoted by Rn. So, 11 = R2. The
following repunits are known to be prime: Rn with n = 2, 19,
23, 317, and 1031. It is not known whether there are inﬁnitely
many prime repunits.
• If n > 11, there exists a prime p > 11 such that
p divides n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3).
A curiosity? Not quite. A good theorem (by Mahler states that
if f(x) is a polynomial with integral coeﬃcients of degree two
or more (for two, the theorem is P´olya’s), and if H is a ﬁnite
set of primes (such as {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}), then there exists n0 such
that if all primes factors of f(n) are in H, then n ≤n0.
Another way of saying this is as follows: limn→∞P[f(n)] = ∞,
where P[f(n)] denotes the largest prime factor of f(n). With
the theory of Baker on linear forms in logarithms, Coates
gave an eﬀective bound for n0. For the particular polynomial
f(x) = x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), the proof is elementary.
• 11 is the largest positive integer d that is square-free and such
that Q(
√
−d) has a euclidean ring of integers. The other such
ﬁelds are those with d = 1, 2, 3, and 7. This means that if α,
β ∈Z[
√
−d], there exist γ, δ ∈Z[
√
−d] such that α = βγ + δ
where δ = 0 or N(δ) < N(β). (Here, for α = a+b
√
−d, N(α) =
a2 + db2. The situation is just like that for euclidean division in
the ring Z of ordinary integers.)
• It is not known whether there exists a cuboid with sides a, b,
and c measured in integers, as well as all diagonals measured in

346
11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
integers. In other words, it is not known whether the following
system has a solution in non-zero integers:











a2 + b2 = d2
b2 + c2 = e2
c2 + a2 = f2
a2 + b2 + c2 = g2
If such integers exist, then 11 divides abc.
• 11 is the smallest integer that is not a numerus idoneus.
You do not know what a numerus idoneus is? I too needed to
reach 65 before realizing how this age and idoneus numbers are
connected with each other. So be patient.
• According to the theory of supersymmetry, the world has 11
dimensions: 3 for space position, 1 for time, and 7 to describe
the various possible superstrings and their diﬀerent vibrating
patterns, so explaining subatomic particles’ behavior.
Is this a joke or a new theory to explain the world?
• The Mersenne numbers are the integers Mq = 2q −1 where q is
a prime. Big deal: some are prime, some are composite. Bigger
deal: how many of each kind? Total mystery!
M11 = 211 −1 = 2047 = 23 · 28. It is the smallest compos-
ite Mersenne number. The largest known composite Mersenne
number is Mq with q = 72021 × 223630 −1.
19
• One of my favorite numbers has always been 19. At this age
Napoleon was winning battles—this we should forget. At the
same age, Gauss discovered the law of quadratic reciprocity—
this you cannot forget, once you have known it.
• First a curiosity concerning the number 19. It is the largest
integer n such that
n! −(n −1)! + (n −2)! −· · · ± 1!
is a prime number. The other integers n with this property are
n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 15.

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
347
• Both the repunit R19 and the Mersenne number M19 are prime
numbers.
• Let U0 = 0, U1 = 1, and Un = Un−1 + Un−2 for n ≥2; these
are the Fibonacci numbers. If Un is prime, then n must also be
prime, but not conversely. 19 is the smallest prime index that
provides a counterexample: U19 = 4181 = 37 · 113.
• The ﬁelds Q(√−19), Q(
√
19) have class number 1. (The class
number is a natural number which one associates to every num-
ber ﬁeld. It is 1 for the ﬁeld of rationals; it is also 1 for the
ﬁeld of Gaussian numbers, and for any ﬁeld whose arithmetical
properties resemble those of the rational numbers. The larger
the class number of a number ﬁeld, the more its arithmetical
properties “deviate” from those of the rationals. For more on
these concepts, see Ribenboim (2000).) The ring of integers of
Q(
√
19) is euclidean, while the ring of integers Q(√−19) is not
euclidean.
• Let n > 2, n ̸≡2 (mod 4), and let ζn = e2πi/n denote a primitive
nth root of 1. 19 is the largest prime p such that Q(ζp) has class
number 1. This was important in connection with Kummer’s
research on Fermat’s Last Theorem.
Masley and Montgomery determined in 1976 all integers n,
n ̸≡2 (mod 4), such that Q(ζn) has class number 1, namely:
n = 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25,
27, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 44, 45, 48, 60, and 84.
• Balasubramanian, Dress, and Deshouillers showed in
1986 that every natural number is the sum of at most 19 fourth
powers. Davenport had shown in 1939 that every suﬃciently
large natural number is the sum of at most 16 fourth powers.
This provided a complete solution of the two forms of Waring’s
problem for fourth powers.
29
• Twin primes, such as 29 and 31, are not like the ages of twins—
their diﬀerence is 2. Why? There are many twin persons and
many twin primes, but in both cases, it is not known whether

348
11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
there are inﬁnitely many . . . .
Euler showed that

p prime
1
p = ∞.
On the other hand, Brun showed that

p, p + 2 primes
1
p < ∞
Brun’s result says that either there are only ﬁnitely many
twin primes, or, if there are inﬁnitely many twin primes, their
size must increase so rapidly that the sum above remains
bounded. All of this is amply discussed in my book on prime
numbers Ribenboim (1996).
• A curiosity observed by Euler: If 29 divides the sum a4+b4+c4,
then 29 divides gcd(a, b, c).
• Let p be a prime. The primorial of p is
p♯=

q ≤p, q {prime}
q;
29 = 5♯−1. The expressions p♯+ 1 and p♯−1 have been con-
sidered in connection with variants of the Euclid’s proof that
there exist inﬁnitely many primes. The following primes p are
the only ones less than or equal to 35000 such that p♯−1 is
prime:
p = 3, 5, 11, 13, 41, 89, 317, 991, 1873, 2053, 2371, 4093, 4297,
4583, 6569, 13033, 15877.
For this and similar sequences, see Ribenboim (1996).
• 2·292 −1 = 2 (a square), similarly 2·12 −1 = 2, 2·52 −1 = 2.
In fact, there are inﬁnitely many natural numbers x such that
2x2 −1 = 2. Here is how to obtain all pairs of natural numbers
(t, x) such that t2 −2x2 = −1. From (t +
√
2x)(t −
√
2x) =
−1, it follows that t +
√
2x is a unit in the ﬁeld Q(
√
2). The
fundamental unit is 1+
√
2 with the norm (1+
√
2)(1−
√
2) = −1,
so t +
√
2x = (1 +
√
2)n with n odd. Thus we have
(1 +
√
2)2 = 3 + 2
√
2,
(1 +
√
2)3 = 7 + 5
√
2,
(1 +
√
2)5 = 41 + 29
√
2.

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
349
The next solution is obtained from
(1 +
√
2)7 = 239 + 169
√
2,
namely 2 · 1692 −1 = 2392.
• The ring of integers of Q(
√
29) is euclidean. There are 16 real
quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
d) with a euclidean ring of integers, namely
d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73.
• 2X2 + 29 is an optimal prime-producing polynomial. Such poly-
nomials were ﬁrst considered by Euler—they are polynomials
f ∈Z[X] that assume as many initial prime values as they
possibly can. More precisely, let f ∈Z[X], with positive lead-
ing coeﬃcient and f(0) = q, a prime. There exists the smallest
r > 0 such that f(r) > q and q | f(r). The polynomial is optimal
prime-producing if f(k) is prime for k = 0, 1, . . . , r −1.
Euler observed that X2 + X + 41 is optimal prime-producing,
since it assumes prime values at k = 0, 1, . . . , 39, while 402 +
40 + 41 = 412.
In 1912, Rabinovitch showed that the polynomial f(X) =
X2 + X + q (with q prime) is optimal prime-producing if and
only if the ﬁeld Q(√1 −4q) has class number 1.
Heegner, Stark, and Baker determined all the imaginary
quadratic ﬁelds Q(
√
d) (with d < 0 and d square-free) with
class number 1:
d = −1, −2, −5, −7, −11, −19, −43, −67, −163.
These correspond to the only optimal prime-producing polyno-
mials of the form X2 + X + q, namely q = 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41.
X2 + X + 41 is the record prime-producing polynomial of the
form X2 + X + q.
Frobenius (1912) and Hendy (1974) studied optimal prime-
producing polynomials in relation to imaginary quadratic ﬁelds
having class number 2. There are three types of such ﬁelds:
(i) Q(√−2p), where p is an odd prime;
(ii) Q(√−p), where p is a prime, and p ≡1 (mod 4);

350
11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
(iii) Q(√−pq) where p, q are odd primes with p < q and pq ≡
3 (mod 4).
For the types of ﬁelds above, the following theorem holds:
(i) Q(√−2p) has class number 2 if and only if 2X2+p assumes
prime values at k = 0, 1, . . . , p −1.
(ii) Q(√−p) has class number 2 if and only if 2X2 +2X + p+1
2
assumes prime values at k = 0, 1, . . . , p−3
2 .
(iii) Q(√−pq) has class number 2 if and only if pX2+pX + p+q
4
assumes prime values at k = 0, 1, . . . , p+q
4
−2.
Stark and Baker determined the imaginary quadratic ﬁelds
Q(
√
d) (with d < 0 and d square-free) that have class number 2.
According to their types, they are:
(i) d = −6, −10, −22, −58.
(ii) d = −5, −13, −37.
(iii) d = −15, −35, −51, −91, −115, −123, −187, −235, −267,
−403, −427.
With these values of d one obtains optimal prime-producing
polynomials.
In particular, 2X2 + 29 is an optimal prime-producing polyno-
mial, with prime values at k = 0, 1, . . . , 28; it corresponds to the
ﬁeld Q(√−58), which has class number 2.
• 29 is the number of distinct topologies on a set with 3 elements.
Let τn denote the number of topologies on a set with n elements;
thus τ1 = 1 and τ2 = 2. One knows the values of τn for n ≤9
(Radoux (1975)).
Approaching the thirties, the age of conﬁdence, life was smil-
ing. 29 was the ﬁrst twin prime age I reached since I became a
mathematician by profession, so I select the number
30
• At this age I was in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, preparing a book
which has, I believe, the distinction of being the southern-most

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae

published mathematical book. (At least this is true for books on
ordered groups—but mine is not the northern-most published
book on the subject.)
• There is only one primitive pythagorean triangle with area equal
to its perimeter, namely (5, 12, 13), with perimeter 30.
• 30 is the largest integer d such that if 1 < a < d and gcd(a, d) =
1, then a is a prime. Other numbers with this property are: 3, 4,
6, 8, 12, 18, and 24. This was ﬁrst proved by Schatunowsky in
1893 and, independently, by Wolfskehl in 1901. (Wolfskehl
is the rich mathematician who donated 100,000 golden marks
to be given to the author of the ﬁrst proof of Fermat’s Last
Theorem to be published in a recognized mathematical journal.)
This result has an interpretation as follows. Given d > 1 and
a, 1 ≤a < d, gcd(a, d) = 1, by Dirichlet’s theorem, there exist
inﬁnitely many primes of the form a + kd (k ≥0). Let p(a, d)
be the smallest such prime, and let
p(d) = max{p(a, d) | 1 ≤a < d, gcd(a, d) = 1}.
If d > 30, then p(d) > d + 1. In particular,
lim inf p(d)
d + 1 > 1.
Pomerance has shown:
lim inf
p(d)
ϕ(d) log d ≥eγ
where ϕ(d) is Euler’s totient of d and γ is the Euler-Mascheroni
constant.
On the other hand, as shown by Linnik, for d suﬃciently large,
p(d) ≤dL, where L is a constant. Heath-Brown showed that
L ≤5.5.
32
• 32 is the smallest integer n such that the number γn of groups
of order n (up to isomorphism) is greater than n: γ32 = 51.
I hate the number 32. At 32 degrees Fahrenheit, water becomes
ice and snow begins to fall. Let us change the subject!

Older people remember best the events of their youth and those
of the more recent past. I haven’t forgotten anything I did not want
to forget, so I could let you know about all the years 33, 34, . . . . But
I would rather concentrate on the 60’s.
60
• 60 was the base of numeration in the counting system of the
Sumerians (ca. 3500 B.C.). Today we still use the sexagesimal
system in astronomy and in the subdivisions of the hour.
• 60 is a highly composite number. Such numbers were introduced
and studied by Ramanujan (1915): The natural number n is
highly composite if d(n) > d(m) for every m, 1 ≤m < n, where
d(n) = number of divisors of n. Thus d(60) = d(22 · 3 · 5) =
3 · 2 · 2 = 12. The smallest highly composite numbers are
2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 32, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, . . . .
• 60 is a unitarily perfect number, which I now deﬁne. A number d
is a unitary divisor of n if d | n and gcd(d, n/d) = 1; n is unitarily
perfect if
n =

{d | 1 ≤d < n, d unitary divisor of n}.
Unitary divisors of 60 are 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 20 and their sum is
indeed 60.
Conjecture: There exist only ﬁnitely many unitarily perfect
numbers.
The only known unitarily perfect numbers are
6, 60, 90, 87360
and
218 ·3·7·11·13·19·37·79·109·157·313.
• 60 is the number of straight lines that are intersections of the
pairs of planes of the faces of a dodecahedron.
• 60 is the order of the group of isometries of the icosahedron. This
is the alternating group on 5 letters. It is the non-abelian simple
group with the smallest order. The simple groups have been
classiﬁed—a great achievement! There are 18 inﬁnite families:

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
353
– cyclic groups of prime order;
– alternating groups An, with n ≥5;
– six families associated to the classical groups;
– ten families associated to Lie algebras (discovered by
Dickson, Chevalley, Suzuki, Ree, and Steinberg.
There are also 26 “sporadic” groups, which do not belong to
the above families. The sporadic groups with the largest order
is Fischer’s monster, which has
246 ·320 ·59 ·76 ·112 ·133 ·17·19·23·29·31·41·47·59·71 ≥8·1053
elements.
61
• A curiosity: Let k ≥0, and let a1, . . . , ak, x, y be digits. If the
number (in decimal notation)
a1a2 . . . akxyxyxyxyxy
is a square, then xy = 21, 61, or 84. Examples:
1739288516161616161 = 13188208812;
258932382121212121 = 5088539892.
• The Mersenne number M61 = 261 −1 is a prime. Today there
are 37 known prime Mersenne numbers Mp = 2p −1, namely,
those with
p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203,
2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209,
44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787,
1398269, 2976221, and 3021227.
23021227 −1 is also the largest prime known today.

62
This number is remarkable for being so uninteresting. As a matter of
fact, suppose that, for some reason or another, there is some number
that is not remarkable. Then there is the smallest non-remarkable
number, which is therefore remarkable for being the smallest non-
remarkable number.
But this is just another example of Russell’s paradox . . . .
63
• This number appears in a cycle associated with Kaprekar’s al-
gorithm for numbers with 2 digits. This algorithm, for numbers
with k digits, goes as follows: Given k digits a1 . . . ak, not all
equal, with a1 ≥a2 ≥. . . ≥ak ≥0, consider two numbers
formed using these digits: a1a2 . . . ak, and akak−1 . . . a1. Com-
pute their diﬀerence, and repeat the process with the k digits
so obtained.
Kaprekar’s algorithm for 2, 3, 4, and 5 digits leads to the
following ﬁxed points or cycles.
2 digits →cycle 63 - 27 - 45 - 09 - 81
3 digits →495
4 digits →6174
5 digits →one of the 3 cycles: 99954 - 95553
98532 - 97443 - 96642 - 97731
98622 - 97533 - 96543 - 97641
Example: {3, 5}: 53 −35 = 18, 81 −18 = 63, 63 −36 = 27,
72 −27 = 45, 54 −45 = 09, 90 −09 = 81.
• 63 is the unique integer n > 1 such that 2n −1 does not have
a primitive prime factor. Explanation: If 1 ≤b < a, with
gcd(a, b) = 1, consider the sequence of binomials an −bn for
n ≥1. The prime p is a primitive prime factor of an −bn if
p | an −bn, but p ∤am −bm if 1 ≤m < n.
Zsigmondy proved, under the above assumptions, that every
binomial an −bn has a primitive prime factor, except in the
following cases:

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
355
(i) n = 1, a −b = 1;
(ii) n = 2, a and b odd, and (a + b) a power of 2;
(iii) n = 6, a = 2, b = 1.
This theorem has many applications in the study of exponential
diophantine equations; see Ribenboim (1994). Explicitly, when
a = 2 and b = 1, the sequence is:
1, 3, 7, 15 = 3·5, 31, 63 = 32 ·7, 127, 257, 511, 1023 = 3·11·31, . . .
64
64 is almost 65, a number I hated to reach, but which nevertheless
has many interesting features.
65
• 65 is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 squares of natural
numbers in 2 diﬀerent ways (except for the order of summands):
65 = 82 + 12 = 72 + 42.
Recall Fermat’s result: n is a sum of 2 squares if and only if for
every prime p ≡3 (mod 4), vp(n) is even. (Here vp(n) denotes
the p-adic value of n, that is, pvp(n) | n but pvp(n)+1 does not
divide n.) The following formula gives the number
r(n) = #{(a, b) | 0 ≤b ≤a and n = a2 + b2}.
For each d ≥1, let
χ(d) =

(−1)
d−1
2
if d is odd,
0
if d is even.
Let R(n) = 
d|n χ(d). Then
r(n) =







R(n)
2
if R(n) is even,
1 + R(n)
2
if R(n) is odd.

356
11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
Example: 65 = 5 · 13 has divisors 1, 5, 13, 65, and R(65) =

d|65 χ(d) = 4, so r(65) = 2.
• 65 is the smallest hypotenuse common to two pythagorean
triangles. This follows from the parameterization of the sides
of pythagorean triangles: If 0 < x, y, z, with y even and
x2 + y2 = z2, then there exist a and b, 1 ≤b < a, such that
x = a2 −b2;
y = 2ab;
z = a2 + b2.
Moreover, the triangle is primitive (i.e. gcd(x, y, z) = 1) if and
only if gcd(a, b) = 1. From 65 = 82 + 12 = 72 + 42 one gets the
pythagorean triangles (63, 16, 65) and (33, 56, 65).
• A curiosity: 65 is the only number with 2 digits d, e, 0 ≤e < d ≤
9, such that (de)2−(ed)2 = 2, a square. Indeed, 652−562 = 332,
and the uniqueness follows from the parameterization indicated
above.
• 65 is also a remarkable number of the second kind, that is, it
counts the number of remarkable numbers satisfying some given
property. In the present case, 65 is perhaps the number of Eu-
ler’s numeri idonei. I say “perhaps” because there is still an
open problem, and instead of 65 there may eventually exist 66
such numbers.
Numeri idonei
What are these numeri idonei of Euler? Also called convenient
numbers, they were used conveniently by Euler to produce prime
numbers.
Now I will explain what the numeri idonei are. Let n ≥1. If q is an
odd prime and there exist integers x, y ≥0 such that q = x2 + ny2,
then:
(i) gcd(x, ny) = 1;
(ii) if q = x2
1 +ny2
1 with integers x1, y1 ≥0, then x = x1 and y = y1.
We may ask the following question. Assume that q is an odd in-
teger, and that q = x2 + ny2, with integers x, y ≥0, such that
conditions (i) and (ii) above are satisﬁed. Is q a prime number?

11. Galimatias Arithmeticae
357
The answer depends on n. If n = 1, the answer is “yes”, as Fer-
mat knew. For n = 11, the answer is “no”: 15 = 22 + 11 · 12 and
conditions (i) and (ii) hold, but 15 is composite. Euler called n a
numerus idoneus if the answer to the above question is “yes”.
Euler gave a criterion to verify in a ﬁnite number of steps whether
a given number is convenient, but his proof was ﬂawed. Later, in
1874, Grube found the following criterion, using in his proof results
of Gauss, which I will mention soon. Thus, n is a convenient number
if and only if for every x ≥0 such that q = n + x2 ≤4n
3 , if q = rs
and 2x ≤r ≤s, then r = s or r = 2x.
For example, 60 is a convenient number, because
60 + 12 = 61 (⋆),
60 + 22 = 64 = 4 · 16 = 8 · 8,
60 + 32 = 69 (⋆),
60 + 42 = 76 (⋆)
and the numbers marked with a (⋆) do not have a factorization of
the form indicated.
Euler showed, for example, that 1848 is a convenient number,
and that
q = 18518809 = 1972 + 1848 · 1002
is a prime number. At Euler’s time, this was quite a feat.
Gauss understood convenient numbers in terms of his theory of
binary quadratic forms. The number n is convenient if and only if
each genus of the form x2 + ny2 has only one class.
Here is a list of the 65 convenient numbers found by Euler:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25,
28, 30, 33, 37, 40, 42, 45, 48, 57, 58, 60, 70, 72, 78, 85, 88, 93,
102, 105, 112, 120, 130, 133, 165, 168, 177, 190, 210, 232, 240,
253, 273, 280, 312, 330, 345, 357, 385, 408, 462, 520, 760, 840,
1320, 1365, 1848.
Are there other convenient numbers? Chowla showed that there
are only ﬁnitely many convenient numbers; later, ﬁner analytical
work (for example, by Briggs, Grosswald, and Weinberger)
implied that there are at most 66 convenient numbers.
The problem is diﬃcult. The exclusion of an additional numerus
idoneus is of a kind similar to the exclusion of a hypothetical tenth

358

imaginary quadratic ﬁeld (by Heegner, Stark, and Baker), which
I have already mentioned.
An extraordinary conjunction
If your curiosity has not yet subsided, I was struck in 1989, in Athens,
at the occasion of my “Greek Lectures on Fermat’s Last Theorem”
by an extraordinary conjunction of numbers. Once in a lifetime, and
not to be repeated before. . . .
At that year, my wife’s age and my age were 59 and 61—twin
primes (but we are not twins); at that same year, we had been mar-
ried 37 years—the smallest irregular prime. If you are still interested,
Kummer had proved that Fermat’s Last Theorem is true for all odd
prime exponents p that are regular primes. These are the primes p
that do not divide the class number of the cyclotomic ﬁeld generated
by the pth root of 1. Kummer also discovered that 37 is the smallest
irregular prime. Pity that 1989 (the year of my Athens lecture) is
not a prime.
So you are challenged to ﬁnd the next occurrence of numbers like
37, 59, 61, but in a prime numbered year.
Notes. This paper on remarkable numbers would not have been pos-
sible were it not for the very original book by F. Le Lionnais, Les
Nombres Remarquables, published in 1983 by Hermann, in Paris.
Fran¸cois Le Lionnais was not a mathematician by profession,
but rather a scientiﬁc writer, and as such, very well informed. His
book Les Grands Courants de la Pens´ee Math´ematique is very en-
grossing to read even today. Just after the war he gathered in this
book the ideas of several young French mathematicians—still little
known at that time—who would soon rise to the pinnacle. An English
translation and the original are available in good libraries. I have an
autographed copy of the book on remarkable numbers, where Le Li-
onnais thanked me for calling his attention to the number 1093. You
may read about this number in Chapter 8 of this book.
Another book of the same kind, which served me well, is:
D. Wells, The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting
Numbers, Penguin, London, UK, 1986.
For results on algebraic numbers, nothing is easier for me than to
quote my own book Ribenboim (2000), to appear in a new edition
at Springer-Verlag. For numeri idonei, see Frei (1984). Concern-
ing primitive factors of binomials, see Ribenboim (1994). On prime
