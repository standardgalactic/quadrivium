Introducing JavaScript Data Types 
and Language Features

It looks a bit like Apex, but it’s not
Primitives (declaration and use)
Basic syntax and language elements
Introduction

It’s Not Null, It’s Just Undefined

Demo
Declaring Variables: Apex vs. JavaScript

The Primitives

Blob
Boolean
Date
Datetime
Decimal
Double
ID
Integer
Long
Object
String
Time
Apex Primitives

Boolean
Number
BigInt
String
Symbol
JavaScript 
Primitives

Demo
Exploring Primitives

Strongly Typed (Apex)
Variables types are defined on creation
Most type related bugs are detected at 
compile time
Lower costs, as the cost to add type 
declarations is less than the cost to test 
and resolve bugs
Loosely Typed (JavaScript)
Variable types are defined by content
Most type related bugs are detected at 
run-time
Increased costs – code is harder to test, 
debug and maintain
Language Comparison


Case – A Sensitive Subject

Apex
contains
endsWith
indexOf
lastIndexOf
split
startsWith
substring
toLowerCase
JavaScript
includes
endsWith
indexOf
lastIndexOf
split
startsWith
substring
toLowerCase
A Few String Methods

Basic Syntax

if(condition) { statements } else { statements }
do { statements } while (condition)
while (condition) { statements }
for ( initialization, condition, final ) 
{ statements | break | continue }
Control Flow
Basic syntax and control flow is almost identical to Apex 
(except that it is case sensitive).

for (variable in object) {statements} – Iterates over keys
for (variable of iterable) {statements} – Iterates over values
switch (expression) {
case value1: {statements [break;]} …
case valuen: {statements [break;]} 
}
Control Flow
Basic syntax and control flow is almost identical to Apex 
(except that it is case sensitive).

try
{
statements
}
catch(e) { statements }
finally  { statements }
Exception Handling
Only one catch statement in JavaScript
Use instanceOf to identify the exception type
Use throw to throw errors

Elements can be undefined
Variables are untyped
Enthusiastic conversion
JavaScript is case-sensitive
Basic language syntax
See? It’s not really that different
- Much of your Apex experience will 
carry over to JavaScript
