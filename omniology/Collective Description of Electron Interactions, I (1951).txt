A new approach
to the treatment
of the interactions
in a collection of electrons is developed,
which we
eall the collective description.
The collective description
is based on the organized
behavior
produced
by
the interactions
in an electron
gas of high density;
this organized
behavior
results
in oscillations
of the
system as a whole, the so-called "plasma oscillations. " The collective description,
in contrast to the usual
individual
particle description,
describes in a natural
way the long-range
correlations
in electron positions
brought
about by their mutual
interaction.
In this paper we con6ne our attention
to the magnetic
inter-
actions between the electrons; the coulomb interactions
will be discussed
in a subsequent
paper.
The transition
from the usual
single-particle
description
to the collective
description
of the electron
motion in terms of organized
oscillations
is obtained
by a suitable canonical transformation.
The complete
hamiltonian
for a collection of charges interacting
with the transverse
electromagnetic
Geld is re-expressed
as a sum of three terms. One involves
the collective 6eld coordinates
and expresses the degree of excitation
of organized
oscillations.
The others represent
the kinetic energy of the electrons and the residual
particle
interaction,
which is not describable
in terms of the organized
oscillations,
and corresponds
to a screened
interparticle
force of short range.
Both a classical and a quantum-mechanical
treatment
are given, and the criteria for the validity
of the
collective description
are discussed.
I. INTRODUCTION
KCAUSK of the long range of the coulomb
force,
the interactions
in a collection of electrons involve
many
particles
simultaneously.
However,
the
usual
description
of these electron interactions
is based on a
free-particle
approximation.
In a metal,
for instance,
the motion
of a given electron
is assumed. to be inde-
pendent
of the motion of all the other electrons in 6rst
approximation.
The effect of the other electrons on this
electron is then represented
by a smeared-out
potential,
which
can be determined
by using
the self-consistent
6eld methods
of Hartree
and Fock. This means
that
the effects of the correlations
in the positions
of the
electrons
brought
about
by
the
long
range
of the
coulomb
force are almost
entirely
neglected;
we can
therefore
expect
that
in any
problem
in which
the
electron-electron
interactions
are
important,
as, for
example,
the calculation
of the cohesive energy or the
electronic
contribution
to the
specific
heats
at
low
temperatures,
the
free-particle
model
may
not
be
adequate.
In order
to obtain
a better
mathematical
treatment
of this
problem,
we have
adopted
a new
approach
based
on
a
collective
description
of the
motion. This collective description
is most appropriate
for systems of high particle density.
It is weH known that an electron gas of high density'
can undergo

' The electron
gas must
be neutra~
by an approximately
equal density
of positive charge. In practice the positive
charge
can usually be regarded as immobile
relative to the electrons, and
for the most applications
can also be regarded
as smeared
out
uniformly
throughout
the system.

lations, "represent
the effects of the long-range
correla-
tion of electron
positions
brought
about by coulomb
interactions.
A description
in terms of these organized
oscillations
therefore provides a natural
way of treating
the long-range
electron interactions,
and leads to greater
insight
into the dynamical
behavior of the electron gas
than
is afforded
by the free-particle
approximation.
Thus, it may be expected that such a collective descrip-
tion will make possible a better understanding
of the
interactions
between the electrons
in a metal.
In a treatment
of these organized
oscillations, ' one
considers a particular
fourier component
of the average
field, proportional
to
expLi(k x—(ut)].
For small amplitudes
(which are of interest to us here),
the linear approximation
is valid, and an arbitrary
6eld
can therefore
be expanded
as a sum of such trigono-
metric terms. In response to this oscillating
field, each
electron undergoes a small corresponding
trigonemetric
change
in its velocity
and
in its contribution
to the
mean
charge density.
Owing
to the long range of the
coulomb force, the mean 6eld at each point can become
quite large as a result of the cumulative
effects of small
contributions
arising from each particle. The condition
for sustained
oscillations
is that the 6eld arising
from
the response
of the particles
must be consistent
with
the field producing
this response. This requirement
leads
to a dispersion
relation
connecting
co and k. For longi-
tudinal waves the approximate
dispersion
relation, good
for Iong wavelengths,
is'
res = (4wtsse'/ra)+ 3k'aT/m,
0)
where no is the electron density, T the temperature,
and
x is Boltzmann's
constant.

wavelength,

this reduces to the well-known
plasma frequency,
Cd& =41ISp's /iit
There are, however,
certain
limitations
on the col-
lective
description
of the
electron
gas
in
terms
of
organized
longitudinal
oscillations
which arise from the
fact that
these
oscillations
cannot
be sustained
for
wavelengths
shorter
than a critical distance
known
as
the Debye length,
Xn = (ccT/4tcn pe') &
V/—
cd p
(2)
This
length
is of the order of the
distance
traveled
during
the period of an oscillation by a particle moving
with
the
mean
thermal
speed,
V, and
thus
might
reasonably
be expected
to constitute
a limitation
on
organized
oscillation. It may be shown,
furthermore,
tha, t whenever
there is a static field in the electron gas,
either
externally
imposed
or arising
from
a lack of
charge neutrality,
the electrons redistribute
themselves
in such a way as to screen out the 6eld within a distance
of the order of a Debye length. '
Screening
and organized
oscillation
are different
but
related manifestations
of the collective
behavior
of the
electron gas, brought about by cumulative
responses of
the particles to the average force; and the Debye length
determines
the smallest distance for which this collective
behavior
is significant.
Thus, one electively
obtains a
separation
between
the long-range
part
of the force,
which is best described collectively,
and the short-range
part, which is best described in terms of the coordinates
of the individual
particles. The higher
the density,
the
shorter the. distances at which the collective description
applies,
and the more useful
this description
becomes.
For a metal,
the Debye length
is of the order of 10 '
cm; and therefore, the collective description
is applicable
practically
down to interparticle
distances.
Organized
transverse
oscillations
of an electron
gas
are also possible. These oscillations
are electromagnetic
waves strongly
modi6ed by the fields arising
from the
collective
particle
response.
Such oscillations
are ob-
tained
in the transmission
of radio
waves
through
a
highly
ionized
medium,
such
as the heaviside
layer.
The organized
transverse
oscillations
can be given a
treatment
similar
to that
of the longitudinal
oscilla-
tions.~' The dispersion
relation for these waves is
Cd~Cd p'+ C'k'.
The
minimum
wavelength
for
which
the
collective
behavior
is important
is, in this case,
This distance
is clearly
much
longer
than
the Debye
length.

In our treatment,

approximations
must
be
made,
which
are
discussed
in detail

connection
with

collective
approximation.

oscillations,
this model for electron
interactions
provides
a physical
basis for the hitherto

use of a screened

correlation
effects.

a screening
radius
which
produces
agreement
with the experimental
results

contribution
to the speci6c heat of a metal, and the width of the
tail of the soft x-ray emission
curve for sodium. D. Bohm and
D. Pines, Phys~ Rev. 80, 903 {1950).
In order
to obtain
a collective
description
of the
electrons in a metal we must use a quantum-mechanical
treatment,
since the electron gas is highly
degenerate.
Previous
treatments
of the organized
oscillations
of an
electron gas have been comparatively
unsystematic
in
that hamiltonian
methods
were not employed,
so that
the results
were not extensible
to quantum
theory. In
our treatment
of the collective description
hamiltonian
methods
will be employed
throughout.
Let us consider
the hamiltonian
for a collection
of
charges interacting
with the electromagnetic
6eld, the
particles
and the Geld being described
by appropriate
canonical
coordinates.
This hamiltonian
may be repre-
sented schematically
as
+D
+pert++inter++field
where
Hp„& represents
the kinetic
energy
of the elec-
trons,
H;„~„represents
the
interaction
between
the
electrons
and
the
electromagnetic
field,
and
Hf;, M
represents
the energy contained
in the electromagnetic
field.
Our program
is to find a canonical transformation
to
a new set of variables
which
will provide
a collective
description
of the system
leading
to results
classically
equivalent
to
those
obtained
in
the
noncanonical
treatment.
Thus,
we shall
require
that
the new
field
variables
oscillate
independently
of the
new
particle
variables
with the characteristic
frequency
of organized
oscillation.
When
we do this we 6nd that the hamil-
tonian
in the collective description
can be represented
schematically

to the average
Geld may
produce
a large
change
in
these 6elds relative to what they wouM be in a medium
of low charge
density.
Thus,
perturbation
theory
is
applied
to the solution
for the motion of each particle
in the average
6eld of all the others,
but cannot
be
applied
in similar
fashion
for the solution
of the field
equations
of motion. On the other hand, because of the
high density of particles,
we may assume that only the
response
of a particle
which
is in phase with the field
producing
it will be important
and that other responses
which
depend
on the position
of the particle
can be
neglected.
We confine our attention
in this paper to the collec-
tive description
of the interactions
between
electrons
brought
about
through
the medium
of the transverse
electromagnetic
6eld. These magnetic
interactions
are
weaker
than
the
corresponding
coulomb
interactions
by a factor of approximately
s'/c' and, consequently,
are
not usually
of great
physical
interest.
However,
the
canonical
treatment
of the
transverse
6eld
is more
straightforward
mathematically
than that of the longi-
tudinal
6eld;
and
since
we
would
like to illustrate
clearly the techniques
and approximations
involved
in
our methods,
we therefore investigate 6rst the role of the
organized
transverse
oscillations
in a description
of
electron
interactions.
In Sec. II, we give a classical
treatment
and discuss in detail the collective approxi-
mation
and
the effective
residual
interparticle
force.
In Sec. III we give the analogous
quantum-mechanical
treatment
of the collective description. The longitudinal
oscillations
wiB be treated
in a subsequent
paper.
Then, following
the usual treatments, ' it can be shown
that our hamiltonian
(5) becomes:
H =g(pP/2m)+g(4s

Here pq„ is the canonical
conjugate
to qq„, and we also
have
p"=(p ~»)*.

for reasons which will become
clear later, to split up the term

expressions
for the

what form the
hamiltonian

of the new variables.

we feel that
the
nature
of the
collective
approximation
will be revealed more clearly by a some-
what
di8erent
procedure.
Ke

substitute
the

(16)], into
our
old
hamiltonian
and
thus
obtain
a
hamiltonian
in terms of both old and new coordinates.
However,
this hamiltonian
can be simpli6ed
consider-
ably with
the aid of the collective approximation,
and
after achieving
this simpli6cation,
we then express the
hamiltonian
entirely
in terms of the new variables.
B. Nature of the Collective Approximation
The approximations
we find it necessary to make, in
order to apply the collective description
to the electron.
gas, have been grouped by us under the general heading
of the collective approximation.
The collective approxi-
mation involves the following
requirements:
(1) The short-range
electron-ion
and electron-electron
collisions
are neglected. This assumes that we are dealing
with an electron
m[aP —(k P~/m)z]I exp(ik x,),
(15)
Q»=aS/aII
z„=q»(1+&»)—(4zre'/mzLz)&
X+I(P"ez )/[oP —(k P./m)']I
exp(zk x.). (16)
gas in which the mean free time for such collisions is considerably
longer than the period of an organized
oscillation. Actually,
such
collisions
tend to disrupt
the organized
osciOation
of the system
as a whole; but if they are not too frequent,
they lead only to a
small damping
of the oscillations. ' The long free path needed for
the validity
of this approximation
actually
occurs because of the
screening
of the long-range
part of the force, which
leaves only
the
short-range
interactions
to be accounted
for in terms
of
collisions.
(2) The organized
oscillations
are assumed
to be of suKciently
small
amplitude
that each particle
suBers only a small pertur-
bation in its straight
line motion due to the combined
fields of all
the other particles. Thus, we will neglect quadratic
Geld terms in
the electron or field equations
of motion
and apply perturbation
theory
to the particle
motions.
This
is the
customary
linear
approximation,
appropriate
for small oscillations.
(3) We distinguish
between
two kinds of response
of the elec-
trons to a wave. One of these is in phase with the wave, so that
the phase difference
between
the-particle
response
and the wave
producing
it is independent
of the position
of the particle. This
is the response
which
contributes
to the organized
behavior
of
the system. The other response
has a phase diGerence
with the
wave producing it which depends
on the position of the particle.
Because of the
general
random
location
of the particles,
this
second response
tends to average out to zero when we consider a
large number
of electrons,
and we shall neglect the contributions
arising
from
this. This procedure
we call the
random
phase
approximation. "
(4) We shall
assume
the smallness
of (k.v)/~. In our case,
~/k~~, so that the smallness of gr v)/co follows from the smallness
of o/c. For longitudinal
oscillations,
however,
we can have small
(k v)/co only for wavelengths
appreciably
longer than the Debye
length,
XD. This follows because Xz is essentially f /ao, where P
is a suitable
mean
speed.
Thus,
the
collective
description
is
applicable
only for long enough
wavelengths.
This result
agrees
with the general
conclusion
cited previously
that both statically
and dynamically
a dense ion gas exhibits organized
behavior
only
for wavelengths
longer than X~ or 'Ag.
The collective approximation
is similar to a complete
perturbation
theory
treatment
in that
perturbation
theory is applied to the particle motion. The diBerence
between
the two approaches
lies in the assumptions
made
regarding
the Gelds produced
by the particles.
For instance,
in Eqs. (15), and (16) we see that
the
old and new field coordinates
and momenta
di8er by a
series of terms summed
over all particle coordinates.
A
complete
perturbation
theoretical
treatment
would
require that this sum be small, but we do not make this
assumption
here.
Instead
we
note
that
the
small
modifications
of the net Geld arising from each particle
may add up to a large change of the average field.
The principal
advantage
of the collective approxima-
tion
is that it does not
require
a small
cumulative
response
to the fields. Thus, in this approximation
we
shall retain
terms
in the hamiltonian
proportional
to
the square of the vector potential,
whereas
in a pertur-
bation treatment
these would be discarded,
since they
are formally of second order in the perturbing
potential.
As we shall
see, in the case of high particle
density,
these can bring about a signi6cant
modification
in the
behavior of the electromagnetic
field.

But this term is of order v'/c' smaller than our original
H; i„, Eq. (10b). We could devise a further
canonical
transformation
which
would
eliminate
terms
of this
order too, but this would only introduce
corrections of
order
a4/c'
in the
interparticle
force. Since
we
will
confine ourselves
to the terms of lowest order (a'/c')
in
the interaction
between
particles,
we can neglect
this
small term (22) entirely.
Let us
now
investigate
the
quadratic
6eld
terms
resulting
from the sum of (17), (19), and (21). These
fall into
two categories,
which
are given
in (23) and

these
are of order

The sum of the expressions
(17), (19'), and (21) will
give us our hamiltonian

in terms
of a
mixture
of the old and new coordinates.
When we add
these expressions,
we find that those terms
which
are
linear in the field coordinates
are reduced to

(24)
The
terms
in
(23) are
all
quadratic
in
the
field
variables,
and
in
addition
have
a
phase
factor
exp[i(k+ I) x,], the argument
of which never vanishes.
In order to discuss these terms,
we transform
from the
old coordinates x; to the new coordinates X;, according
to Kq. (14). We will
then
have
two types
of terms;
those in which x, is replaced
by X;, and those which
arise from the difFerence
between
x; and X;. Now the
X;, because
Hp„t, , ~ is a screened
short-range
inter-
action, behave to a good degree of approximation
like
the coordinates
of a free particle. We may then assume
that
these are distributed
at random,
as in a perfect
gas. Since we have a very large number
of particles,
the
nonvanishing
argument
of
the
phase
factor,
exp[i(k+I) X;], will cause the contribution
of those
terms
in which it is present
to average
out to zero.
This is essentially
the random-phase
approximation.
The efFects of the correlations
in the x; are represented
in the di8erence between x; and X;.However, the terms
arising
from
this
difFerence
multiply
quadratic
6eld
terms; and it may be shown that the resultant
products
either
make
nonlinear
contributions
to the equations
of motion, which we neglect in the linear approximation,
or average
out to zero because
they contain
a phase
factor with nonvanishing
argument. ' Thus, in general,
terms
which
are quadratic
in the field variables
and
contain
a phase
factor
with
nonvanishing
argument
may be neglected
in the collective approximation.
When
we consider
the terms
in (24), we see that if
we take
gk„—
——(2we'/mL')
Q 8(P,"ek„/m)'/
[ '—(k P'/m)']
(25)
then
the
quadratic
terms
in G»II »,
reduce
to
xgk„ II»II ». We similarly
see that with
this choice
of gk„, the quadratic
terms in qk„q k„become
2kgqk„q k„c'Ic'+~~'+(4w—e'/mL')
dispersion
relation for transverse
plasma oscillations."
Thus
we
see that
we have
reduced
the
field
terms
represented
in (24) to
kZ(ilk, iI-k, +co'Qk, Q k,).
(2g)
The remaining
terms are given by

(29)
We now wish to express this term entirely
in terms of
our new coordinates.
One can show,
using
the linear
approximation
and
the random-phase
approximation,
that the lowest order (in s/e) field term resulting
from
substituting
our expression
for x;, (14) into (29), is

This term,
which
is of the same sort as (22), may be
neglected
for the same reason —
that its inclusion
will
lead to fourth-order
terms in m/c in H„,c; c."Thus, we
obtain, to this order of approximation,
only the above
term (29) with x; replaced by X,.
Our transformed
hamiltonian,
expressed
entirely
in
terms of the new coordinates,
the "collective" variables,
thus takes the form:
{P(P,".ek„/m) [kP+(k P,/m)']}
[cd'—(k P;/m)']'
H &"p„c—
—QP,k/2m,
(32a)
This is just the hamiltonian

}(P,"ek„/m)'P[aP+(k

[co'—(k P;/m)']'
then
this term vanishes.
This choice of aP is just the
't' This difFers from the dispersion
relation
quoted
by Langmuir
in the terms of order o'/c2 which he neglected. It may be shown,
using
methods
similar
to those
of Langmuir,
that
the
above
dispersion
relation is obtained
when these terms are not neglected
—
see D. Pines, reference 5.
"The term
in Eq. (14) involving
8&/8I'; leads to quadratic
field
terms
multiplied
by phase
factors
which
do not vanish.
According to the general properties of the collective approximation
this term can be neglected.

the interaction
is greatly
reduced for small values of k,
or to put it another
way, screened
out for sufFiciently
large interparticle
distances. To see this in more detail,
let us evaluate Hp„t;„t in terms
of the interparticle
distances. First, we carry out the sum over polarization
directions,
obtaining
Xexp[ik (X,—X,)j.
(32c)
We see that
the
new
field and particle
variables
no
longer
interact.
The new
field
coordinates
carry
out
oscillations
of frequency
or given by the transverse
field
dispersion
relation, Eq. (27), and thus correctly describe
the organized
transverse
oscillations.
The new particle
coordinates act like those of a free particle, to the extent
that
we are able to neglect
H peart
&nt
which
represents
an effective
residual particle interaction.
D. Effective Residual Particle Interaction
Let us now investigate H„,t,. t in some detail. It
e6'ectively
corresponds
to that part
of the magnetic
interaction
between
electrons
which
is not describable
in terms of the organized
transverse
oscillations.
Since
cv'~&c'k', we see that this term will be at least of order
v'/c'
smaller
in
magnitude
than
the
corresponding
coulomb
interaction
between
the electrons,
which
is
given by
(2s.e'/L')P(1/P)
exp[ik (x,—
x.,)j.
Hence, we shall consider
only the lowest order (in v/c)
terms
represented
in (32c), neglecting
those
terms of
order
e4/c4 as compared
with
the coulomb
term. The
lowest order terms may be written:
e„„;„~—(2~e'/m'L')
(P' s~.)(P"e~.)
X P
exp[ik (X,—X,)]. (33)
*'i~~ co'—(k P;/m)'
Now
to
this
order
of approximation,
we may
write
z'=c'k'+co„', so that we have
2s e'
(P,' eg„)(P,"ep„)
m'L'
~i&l c'k'+re„'
(k'. P;/m)'—
Xexp[ik (X;—X,)]. (34)
We now compare
the above expression
with the analo-
gous
term
in the
hamiltonian
from
which
may
be
derived the Biot-Savart law for the magnetic interaction
between particles. This may be shown to be
H,s„,.g—
——(2xe'/m2L')
(P; ea,)(P;.ea,) exp[ik (X,—X,)j.
(35)
'i~~ c'k' —(k P,/m)'
Because of the presence
of or„' in the denominator
in
Eq. (34), we see that
when
the ion density
is large,
Hpart
int
Xexp[ik (X;—X;)g.
(36)
For simplicity
we consider only the first term in Hp
and we neglect
(k P,/m)'
in the denominator,
since it
will always be order v'/c' smaller
than c'k'. We replace
the
sum
over
k by an integral,
multiplying
by the
density
in k space, (L/2s)'. We thus have:
H&"p.„t;.t—
——[2~e'/m'(2s-)'j+P, "P,
dk
X {[1/(o '+c'0'1 exp[ik (X;—X,)j}. (37)
The integral
over k yields just
2s.~[exp {—[cd„/c] ( X;—X, ) }7/
} X;—X,},
so we have
H "„„t;„i=—(e'/2)g(P, "P,/m')
X[exp{—(cd,/c)
} X,—X;}}]/}X;—X;}. (38)
This leads to a screened Biot-Savart
law of interaction
between
the
particles,
with
the
interaction
being
screened
out at distances
c/cv„. For a metal,
where
sp
10 ', this screening
distance
is
3X10 ' cm.
III. QUANTUM-MECHANICAL
TRANSFORMATION
TO
THE COLLECTIVE DESCRIPTION
A. Generating
Function for the Transformation
We now carry out a quantum-mechanical
treatment
of the preceding
classical material.
We shall
see that
the quantum-mechanical
calculation
yields
essentially
the
same
results
as
the
classical
treatment
in
the
preceding
section.
We find it convenient
to work in the following
repre-
sentation.
We expand
in terms
of the
creation
and
annihilation
operators
for the transverse
field, aj,„and

(40)
These are connected
with

Using these, one can show that the classical hamiltonian
rules as the (x;, p;) by
(8), which
is equally
valid in the quantum-mechanical
case,
leads
to
the
following
hamiltonian. " in
this

and similarly
ak„(exp(—

(44b)
We may consider (44a) and (44b) as operator equations,
and
take S to be a function
of the
new
operators
(X;, P,, A», A»~)
only. 5
will
be
the
quantum-
mechanical
analog of our classical generating
function.
The relationship
between
the old and the new hamil-
tonians
may similarly
be viewed
as an operator
equa-
tion:

+a—kpakgg+a —kk akk )
(41)
H= {exp(—iS/h) }a{exp(iS/h) }
(44c)
We may adopt the schematic

of Sec. I, with
H...g—
—p(p /2m),
H;„g„—
—(e/m)p(2xh/cvL')&(ak„+a
k„')(p, ek„)'
where
3C represents
the hamiltonian
expressed
in the
new coordinates.
The desired
canonical
transformation
to the "col-
lective" representation
is then defined by the following
generating
function
S=—(ei/m)g(2grh/kgL')
~
+-gp[h(co„'+e'h' —cek)/co)[a „a „*+a„*a„
+a
„a „+a „*a „*). (42c)
The order of factors in (42b) is not essential
because,
due to the transversality
condition,
y;.e» commutes
with
exp(ik x.;). We are
working
in the
Heisenberg
representation
and
our
operators
satisfy
the
usual
commutation
rules:

(43)
Just as we did in the classical case, we now seek to
find a canonical
transformation
to the collective
de-
scription,
in which
the held
coordinates
describe
the
organized
transverse
oscillations.
The transformation
theory most suited to our purpose
is briefly as follows."
We define
new
operators
(X;, P,) which
possess
the
same eigenvalues,
and satisfy
the same commutation
'~ This hamiltonian
differs from the customary
one, because
~ve
have expanded
in terms of an arbitrary
oscillation
frequency

rather than taking oy=ck.
"Quantum-mechanical

B. Consequences
of the Transformation
In working
out the
consequences
of this
transfor-
mation,
we shall expand the exponentials,
exp(&iS/h),
so that (44c) may be written:
H =K
(i/h) [S,K)—(1/2—
h') [5, [S,K))
+(i/6h')[5, [5, [S,se)))+
.
(46)
We will classify terms according to the power of S they
contain —
i.e., [5,3C) is the first-order
commutator
of
S and X. We shall
see that
the terms
arising
from
[S,[5, [5,BC))), and
higher
order
commutators
can
be neglected
if we restrict our attention
to the lowest
order terms in gg/c.
The
following
relationships
are useful
in applying
(46):
p;k —
—P,k—(i/h) [S,P;g,]+.
=P,k+ (e/m) p(2s h/kgL')

(53)
Thus,
there are no interaction
terms of this order
(in
s/e)
in the
new
hamiltonian.
The
vanishing
of the
linear
6eld terms
in this order
is one of the desired
properties
of
the
hamiltonian
appropriate
for
the
collective description.
When we consider the terms arising from the second-
order
commutators
in P», c
and
-',Pa„Ace(aa„ca»*
+ca»aa»),
we
see that
they
will
yield
just
minus
one-half the terms given by the 6rst-order
commutator
arising
from 3'.~; ~„, and that all of the terms
arising
from the higher order commutators
in these two terms
will bear a similar
simple
arithmetical
relationship
to
the
terms
in
the
next-lower
order
commutator
in
K;
t,„.The 6rst-order
commutator
of 5 and 3'. ;„t,„is:
—(i/h) [S,K';~c„]= —(ei/mh)Q(2s
h/
Lce') &
X[(P;.s,)/( —(k P'/m)+Aha/2
)]
(49)
X {[S,(I';
„)](A „+A „*)(ep('k
X,))
The calculation
of the commutators
for (47) and (49)
is trivial. In obtaining
(48) one encounters
commutators
like
[{1/(ce—(I P;/m)+AP/2m)
},{exp(ik X;)}].
Such a commutator
may be easily calculated,
provided
one notices that:
{I/[ce
I P,/m+—AP/2m]} exp(ik
X,)
=exp(ik
X;){1/[ce—I P;/m+AP/2m
—hl kb;;/m] }. (50)
That
(50) is true,
may be seen by multiplying
both
sides by (ce
I P /m+ AP—/2m) and commuting
this with
exp(ilt
X,) on the right-hand
side. Using (50), we see
that:
[{I/(ce —(I PI/m)+ AP/2m) },exp(zk. Xc)]
= {exp(ik X;)}{1/(ce—(I P;/m)+(AP/2m)
hbgI k/—m)
1/(ce —
(I P;/m—)+AP/2m)}
(51).
W'e now consider the 6rst-order terms arising from Hp
t,
and &Pa„ha&(cca„cca„+a»*caa„) These are
g.iven by
—(i/h)[S
{E(&'/2m)+kZA~(A»A»*+A»'A»)
}]
=—(e/m)P(2~A/~L')
a{(A,„+A,„*)
X(Pc s») exp(ik X;)}, (52)
as may be verified
using
the commutation
rules anal-
ogous
(43) for the new coordinates.
But these
terms
thus cancel one of the zero-order
terms
arising
from
+(P,"sa„)[S, (Aa„+A a„*)](exp(ik.X,))
+(P;
„)(A „+A „*)[S,(exp(ik Xc))]}. (54)
It is quite
straightforward,
but tedious
to show that
this reduces to
—(4 ~/
'L') 2 {(P',)(P' .,)/
[ga—((k P;/m)+hh/2m)
]}exp[ik (X,—X,)], (55a)

+
maL
cac [ce—(k P./m)]' —h'hc/4m'
X {Aa,Aa,*+Aa,'Aa, +Aa, A a,+Aa,*A-a,*}
(55b)
In reducing
(54) to (55a) and (55b) we have neglected
a number of terms which are quadratic
in field variables
and are multiplied
by a phase factor with nonvanishing
argument,
exp[i(k+I) X;]. This is the same approxi-
mation we made in the classical case, when we neglected
the corresponding
terms (23). The justification
used for
the classical approximation
may be directly
applied
to
this case. Since, as we have
noted,
the second-order
commutators
arising
from H~,c and saba„hca(ca»caa„*
+u»*a») yield just —as{—(i/h)[S, Kr;„c„]},then the
combined
contribution
of these
terms
and
the first-
order commutator
with 3'.~;„t,„to our hamiltonian
will
be —(i/2A)[S, K;,c„] or one-half
the
sum
of (55a)
and (55b).
In addition to the unconsidered
higher order commu-
tators in the terms we have already discussed,
there are
two
terms
we have
not yet
investigated.

This is our quantum-mechanical
dispersion
relation for
the
organized
transverse
oscillations.
It
is
almost
identical with the analogous
classical dispersion
relation
(27), and reduces to the latter as h—4.
When we combine all of the terms we have considered
thus far, and assume that the frequency of the organized
oscillations
is specified by (57), we obtain

where
we have used Kqs. (55a), (55b), (56), and (57),
and taken one-half of the sum of the terms in (55a) and
(55b). This
is just
our
desired
hamiltonian
for the
collective description. It reduces to the classical hamil-
tonian (31) as h—ao. H~„&;« is here given by

This term may be neglected
because it is quadratic
in
the
6eld
variables
and
contains
a
phase
factor
exp[i(k+1) x;]with nonvanishing
argument.
The other
term is from H fipple, and is, to 6rst order,
-'Q(&o '+c'k' —oP)(h/co) fAa Aa *+Aa *Aa
+Aa,A a,+Aa, *A a,*
(i/h)—
[S', (Aa,Aa„*
+Aa,*Aa,+Aa,A-a, +A a,*A-a,*)]}. (56)
On comparing
the zero-order
terms
in (56) with
the
quadratic fiel terms resulting
from —(i/2h) [S,Kr; &„]
obtained
from (55), we see that the sum of these
will
vanish
if we take:
It is essentially
the same as our classical result
(32c)
since the hk'/2m
term
is unimportant
for most cases
of interest.
We may neglect
the terms
arising
from
the higher
order
commutators
we have
not yet
considered,
for
the higher
order
commutators
in that part of Hf;, i~
given in (56) are of the same character as those resulting
from (55b). Thus, we see all of the higher order commu-
tators
will be arithmetical
fractions
of those resulting
from
[S,[S,Xr;«„]]. But
as
may
be
seen
from
(55a) and
(55b) the lowest
order
term
arising
from
[S,[S,X;«„]]will be a factor of w%' smaller
than
H;««, and may be neglected,
just as (22) was in the
classical case, since its inclusion
would lead to a fourth
or higher power of s/c in H, «a;~t,.
Thus, in all respects the quantum-mechanical
results
are essentially
the
same
as those
obtained
with
our
classical
treatment
of the previous
sections.
We 6nd
that
we must
carry out the same approximations
for
this case, and the analysis
of H„,t i„t will yield results
similar to those of Sec. II.
IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion,
we should
like to point out that
we
have verified,
both
classically
and quantum-mechani-
cally, our qualitative
picture
of the role of organized
transverse
oscillations
in electron interactions.
We have
seen that, by a suitable
canonical transformation
to the
collective
variables,
we can show
that
the effects of
magnetic interaction
are divided
naturally
into the two
components
discussed earlier:
{1) The long-range
part, {)&c/co„). This is responsible
for the
long-range
organized
behavior of the electrons, leading to modified
transverse
Geld oscillations.
We may interpret
these interactions
as being redescribed
in terms of the coordinates
of the modified
transverse
oscillations.
(2) The short-range
part, (X&c/~~), given by Hp„t; t, which
does not contribute
to the organized
behavior,
and represents
the
residual
particle-interaction
after the organized
behavior
of the
system has been taken into account.
Furthermore,
in those
regions
in which
organized
behavior
is unimportant
(i.e., X(c/co~), the new hamil-
tonian reduces to the appropriate
particle hamiltonian,
in which
the electrons
interact
according
to the Biot-
Savart
law,
and
the
transverse
6elds
oscillate
with
frequency
co=ck. For, as we have
seen,
Hp
t ' t de-
scribes the Biot-Savart
law for short wavelengths,
and
in this limit our dispersion
relation becomes co'= c'k'.
