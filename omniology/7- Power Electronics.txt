Basic concepts and terms 
in power electronics
1.1  Conversion of electrical energy: Classification 
of converters
Power electronics involves the conversion of electrical energy or the 
switching (on or off) of an electrical power circuit, with or without con-
trol of the electrical energy (IEC, 551-11-1). In the Russian literature, power 
electronics associated with the conversion of electrical energy is often 
referred to as converter engineering.
Electronic power conversion may be defined as the modification of one 
or more parameters of electrical energy by means of electronic devices, 
without significant power losses (IEC, 551-11-2).
A converter is a device for power conversion, with one or more switch-
ing components and also, if necessary, transformers, filters, and auxiliary 
devices (IEC, 551-12-01).
A converter for power-supply purposes is often called a secondary 
power source, in contrast to primary sources such as batteries, solar cells, 
and ac grids.
The main forms of power conversion are as follows (Kassakian et al., 
1991; Mohan et al., 2003; Rozanov, 2007; Zinov’ev, 2012):
	
1.	Rectification (conversion from ac to dc). The corresponding con-
verter is known as a rectifier or an ac/dc converter for rectification. 
The energy source for most consumers is a single- or three-phase 
general-purpose ac grid. At the same time, dc voltage is required 
for control and communications devices and computers. It is also 
required for certain components of drives, electrical equipment, and 
optical equipment. In autonomous systems, the ac sources are rotary 
generators. Rectifiers are the most common power converters.
	
2.	Inversion (conversion from dc to ac). The corresponding converter 
is known as an inverter or an ac/dc converter for inversion. The dc 
source of an inverter may be a battery, a solar cell, or a dc transmis-
sion line or else another converter.
	
3.	Conversion from ac to dc and vice versa. The corresponding converter 
is known as an ac/dc converter. Such converters are able to change the

Power electronics basics
direction of the energy flux and may operate either in the rectifier 
mode, when the energy is transmitted from an ac grid to a dc circuit, 
or in the inverter mode, when the energy is transmitted from a dc 
circuit to an ac grid. In an electric drive, changing the direction of 
the energy flux ensures a recuperative braking of the machine.
	
4.	Conversion from ac to ac. The corresponding converter is known as an 
ac converter. Three types exist:
	
a.	 The ac voltage converter, with the same number of phases and 
the same voltage frequency at the input and output, changes the 
voltage amplitude (upward or downward) and/or improves the 
voltage by stabilizing the fundamental harmonic or by adjust-
ing the harmonic composition.
	
b.	 The frequency converter transforms an m1-phase voltage of fre-
quency f1 to an m2-phase voltage of frequency f2. Many com-
ponents of drives, electrical equipment, and optical equipment 
require alternating current whose frequency is variable or dif-
fers from the industrial frequency of 50 (60) Hz. Such compo-
nents include ac frequency drives, inductive heaters, and power 
sources of optical equipment. Rotary generators in autonomous 
systems often produce voltage of unstable frequency, whose sta-
bilization requires frequency converters.
	
c.	 The phase converter transforms single-phase to three-phase volt-
age and vice versa. Conversion of single-phase to three-phase 
voltage permits power supply to three-phase components in 
the absence of a three-phase grid. The connection of high-
power ­single-phase loads to a single phase of a three-phase grid 
imposes an asymmetric burden on the grid, and it is expedient 
to use the appropriate phase converter in that case.
	
5.	Conversion from dc to dc. The corresponding converter is known as a 
dc converter. Such conversion improves the power of a dc source and 
matches the voltage of the source and consumers. It is most often 
employed for components whose power source is a low-voltage 
battery.
	
6.	Reactive power conversion. The corresponding converter is known as 
a reactive power converter. Such conversion compensates the reactive 
power generated or consumed (Section 1.3). Converters of this type 
draw active power from the grid only for the compensation of losses.
These are the basic types of power conversion, but others also exist. For 
example, in technological systems, units for the generation of powerful 
single pulses are employed. As technology develops, the list of power-
electronic components may grow.
As already noted, converters may change the direction of the energy 
flux. A converter with one possible direction of power flow transmits energy 

3
Chapter one:  Basic concepts and terms in power electronics
only in one direction: from the source to the load. Converters in which 
the direction of the energy flux may change are known as reversible con-
verters. Two-quadrant converters may change the direction of the energy 
flux by changing the polarity of the voltage or current in the load circuit. 
Four-quadrant converters may change the direction of the energy flux by 
changing the direction of both the voltage and the current. Multiquadrant 
converters capable of changing the direction of the energy flux may be 
based not only on ac/dc converters, but also on ac converters of different 
types and dc converters.
In direct power conversion, there is no conversion to other types of 
electrical energy. In this case, we use direct converters. Indirect converters are 
also widely used, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1a shows a frequency 
converter with an intermediate dc component consisting of a rectifier sup-
plied from a grid of frequency f1 and an inverter producing voltage of 
frequency f2. Figure 1.1b shows a dc converter with a high-frequency inter-
mediate ac component consisting of an inverter and a rectifier. The inter-
mediate component includes a transformer. Figure 1.1c shows an indirect 
rectifier consisting of a rectifier Rc1, an inverter, and a rectifier Rc2, with

two intermediate components: a dc component between the rectifier Rc1 
and the inverter and a high-frequency ac component between the inverter 
and rectifier Rc2.
Although indirect conversion increases the energy losses and reduces 
the efficiency, it is widely used, as it offers benefits such as better quality of 
the voltage and current at the converter output and/or input and reduced 
size and mass of the equipment (thanks to high-frequency transformation).
Depending on the properties of the power source, we may distinguish 
the voltage and current converters. At the input of a voltage converter, the 
properties of the power source U resemble those of an emf source. As 
a rule, a capacitor C is connected in parallel to the source (Figure 1.2a). 
At the input of a current converter, the properties of the power source I 
resemble those of a current source. A choke L is connected in series with 
the source (Figure 1.2b).
The converters consist of a power component and also a control system, 
in the form of information-processing components that generate pulses 
sent to the control electrodes of the power switches. The interface compo-
nents of the control system are voltage and/or current sensors installed in 
the power component of the converter, in the load circuit, or in the power 
source.
Converters based on uncontrollable switches (diodes) are known as 
noncontrollable converters. Such converters have no control system.
1.2  Output parameters and characteristics 
of converters
Consumers of electric power impose numerous requirements on convert-
ers, often without adequate specificity. A switch-based converter generates 
voltage and current of complex harmonic composition. As an example, we 
show the output voltage of a controllable rectifier in Figure 1.3a and the 
output voltage of a voltage inverter formed by pulse-width modulation 
in Figure 1.3c; the corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 1.3b and d.
The useful component of the output voltage (or current) of a converter 
with a dc output is the constant component of the Fourier-series expansion 
in Figure 1.3b. The constant component of the spectrum (the harmonic with 
k = 0) corresponds to the mean over the repetition period T:

where θ = ωt. For the example shown in Figure 1.3a, the repetition period 
of the voltage is half the grid period.
The useful component of the output voltage or current of a converter 
with an ac output is the fundamental with the converter’s output frequency 
(the harmonic with k = 1), determined in Fourier-series expansion of the 
voltage or current (Figure 1.3d).
For consumers whose operation is not critical to the harmonic compo-
sition of the voltage or current, the effective value is generally adopted as 
the useful component of the output voltage or current.

Power electronics basics
As is evident from Figure 1.3b and d, the spectra contain not only 
the useful component, but also other harmonics, which may sometimes 
be subharmonics. In accordance with consumer requirements, these har-
monics may be suppressed by means of filters at the converter output 
(Section 1.5).
Spectra give the best idea of the quality of the output voltage or cur-
rent. However, the spectral composition of a converter changes with its 
operating conditions. Therefore, we need generalized criteria for assess-
ing the harmonic composition so as to identify the least favorable con-
ditions and also to compare different methods of generating the output 
voltage.
The quality of alternating voltage or current may be assessed on the 
basis of the following characteristics:
	
1.	The total harmonic distortion (THD), which is the ratio of the effective 
value of the higher harmonics to the fundamental of the periodic 
function

	   For a sinusoidal function, the THD is zero. An increase in kthd indi-
cates deterioration in the harmonic composition. If we use a voltage 
converter, the THD of the output voltage is largely independent of 
the load; in contrast, the THD for the output current characterizes 
the converter—load system.

fundamental and the periodic function

In dc circuits, we consider not only the useful component, but also the 
variable component (the ripple). The current quality is assessed by means 
of the dc ripple factor, which is the ratio of half the difference of the maxi-
mum and minimum values of the pulsating current to its mean value. 
Various methods are used to assess voltage pulsation:

7
Chapter one:  Basic concepts and terms in power electronics
•	 From the effective value of the variable component
•	 From the difference in the maximum and minimum instantaneous 
values of the voltage
•	 From the amplitude of the lowest harmonic of the pulsation
The following parameters are significant: the stability of the funda-
mental and the possibility of its regulation, the maximum and minimum 
values of Uout and Iout, and the maximum active power in the load Pout.
For the power consumer, the characteristic of the converter is important: 
this curve shows the relation between the output voltage and the output 
current. In dc circuits, Uout and Iout are characterized by constant compo-
nents; in ac circuits, they are characterized by the effective values of the 
fundamental with the output frequency. Typical converter characteristics 
are shown in Figure 1.4.
For the family of converter characteristics shown in Figure 1.4a, 
a variation in load power has no pronounced influence on the voltage. 
In other words, the converter characteristics resemble those of the emf 
source. Such characteristics are said to be hard. In this case, γ is the control 
parameter of the converter, specified by the control system. The slope of 
the converter characteristics corresponds to the active power losses in the 
power and often also to various unrelated factors. In the case of Figure 
1.4b, the converter has the properties of a current source. Such converter 
characteristics are often used in electric drives and in technological equip-
ment. The converter characteristics in Figure 1.4c have three sections. In 
section III, the load current is stabilized. With increasing voltage, the 
converter passes to section II, where the power is stabilized (as a rule, at 
the maximum permissible power of the converter or load). With further 
decrease in the load current, the converter reaches section I, where the 
output voltage is limited to permissible values.

Power electronics basics
The converter characteristic determined solely by the power equip-
ment of the converter is known as the natural characteristic. It is recorded 
when there is no feedback with respect to the converter’s output param-
eters. As a rule, voltage converters have a hard natural characteristic.
The converter characteristic obtained in the presence of modify-
ing equipment—for example, in voltage, current, or power stabilization 
by the corresponding feedback loop—is known as a forced characteristic. 
Examples of forced characteristics are seen in Figure 1.4b and c.
1.3  Influence of converters on the grid
Power-electronics components based on semiconductor switches con-
stitute a nonlinear load for the grid (Czarnecki, 1987; Emanuel, 1999; 
Kassakian et al., 1991; Mohan et al., 2003; Zinov’ev, 2012). Consider the 
operation of a converter with a single-phase sinusoidal grid. The charac-
teristic electromagnetic processes are illustrated in Figure 1.5. Figure 1.5a 
shows the grid voltage u and the current i consumed by the converter. 
The instantaneous power, shown in Figure 1.5b, is p(θ) = u(θ) ⋅ i(θ), where 
θ = ωt. When p > 0, energy is transmitted from the grid to the converter 
and then to the load. When p < 0, energy is returned from the load to the 
grid.
By definition, the active power consumed by the converter from the 
grid is

We divide the fundamental (first harmonic) i1 of the current i (shown

phase as the grid voltage (Figure 1.5b), and the reactive component i1r, with 
a phase lag of π/2 (Figure 1.5c). Then the current may be expressed in the

Chapter one:  Basic concepts and terms in power electronics
The instantaneous power p1a(θ) (Figure 1.5b) includes a constant com-
ponent. This means that the active power transmits the active component 
of the fundamental of current i to the load. Conversely, no constant com-
ponent is seen in p1r(θ) or ph(θ). Therefore, the reactive current of the fun-
damental and higher harmonics is not involved in the transmission of 
active power and is responsible for the useless oscillation of the energy 
between the grid and the converter.
The total (apparent) power consumed by the converter from the grid 
is S = UI, where U and I are the effective values of the voltage u and cur-
rent i, respectively. The total power in the single-phase sinusoidal grid

characterizing the reactive power Q.

With an asymmetric grid, the power is transmitted to the load only by 
the active component of the grid current’s direct sequence.
When a converter is connected to a nonsinusoidal grid, the active 
power and reactive power are equal to the sum of the active and reactive 
power of all the harmonics of voltage u:

We cannot use Equation 1.9 for nonsinusoidal and three-phase asym-
metric grids.
The appearance of inactive components in the grid current reduces 
the power factor and has undesirable technological and economic 
consequences.
	
1.	In the system, not only the active, but also the reactive power must 
be kept in balance. If the reactive power is not taken in hand, the 
grid frequency will decline.
	
2.	The inactive components of the total power perform no work. To 
transmit the same active power to the consumer, with a decrease 
in the power factor, the current must be increased. That neces-
sarily increases expenditures on conductors, transformers, and 
switchgear.
	
3.	In grids of limited power, which do not fully correspond to the prop-
erties of an emf source, the reactive current reduces the voltage at the 
consumer terminals, whereas the higher current harmonics produce 
higher harmonics in the grid voltage.
	
4.	The heating of the insulation due to higher harmonics is consider-
ably greater than for the fundamental frequency. That reduces the 
life of the insulation and may lead to accidents. In transformers and 
electrical machines, higher harmonics increase the losses in steel 
and copper components.
	
5.	When the grid is nonsinusoidal, the operation of safety system is 
impaired; unnecessary shutdowns will occur. In addition, deteriora-
tion will be observed in the operation of computers and also com-
munications and automation systems connected to the grid.
For many years, researchers in power electronics have been preoc-
cupied with increasing the power factor of converters and reducing the 
grid distortion that they produce. Considerable progress has been made 
possible by the appearance of powerful and completely controllable semi-
conductor components and microprocessor controllers.

12
Power electronics basics
The ideal load for the grid is a device consuming sinusoidal current 
in phase with the fundamental of the grid voltage. In asymmetric three-
phase grids, the ideal load is a device consuming sinusoidal symmetric 
current in phase with the direct sequence of the fundamental of the grid 
voltage.
The power factor of converters may be increased by two approaches 
considered in this book:
	
1.	Internal measures: change in the converter’s power circuit and/or con-
trol algorithm
	
2.	External measures: the connection of filters and compensators to the 
converter (or other load)
1.4  Basic converter parameters
A converter consists of the power component and the control system 
(Figure 1.6a), each of which has a considerable influence on its basic 
parameters.
The transfer factor of the converter is the ratio of the voltage at the load to 
the voltage at the source. The voltage on the dc side is characterized by the 
mean, and the voltage on the ac side by the effective value of the funda-
mental, as a rule. The converter’s maximum transfer factor is an important 
parameter.
The converter’s efficiency is the ratio of the active power Pout transmit-
ted to the load to the active power Pin consumed from the source

Chapter one:  Basic concepts and terms in power electronics
The losses in the converter consist of the losses in the semiconductor 
switches, the losses in the other power components (capacitors, chokes, 
transformers, etc.), and the power losses in the control system. The losses 
in the semiconductor switches depend on the number of switches in 
series through which the basic converter current passes. The proportion 
of the losses in the semiconductor switches increases significantly with a 
decrease in the working voltages in the converter—for example, when the 
converter is connected to low-voltage batteries—and also with an increase 
in the switching frequency (Chapter 2). The losses in the control system 
are only significant in low-power converters. The losses in the converter 
may be reduced not only by increasing the efficiency, but also by reducing 
the energy consumption in cooling.
The functionality of the converter is determined by its ability to ensure 
all the required electrical input and output parameters in all conditions 
(Sections 1.2 and 1.3).
The converter’s reliability depends on the reliability of its compo-
nents, the complexity of the system, the design of the components, the 
manufacturing technology, the cooling efficiency, and the safety mea-
sures employed. The control system plays a considerable role in ensur-
ing reliable operation. In the event of faults in the control system or the 
anomalous development of dynamic processes (e.g., in unstable oper-
ation of the automatic control system), a fault may appear in the con-
verter; in some cases, the converter, the load, or the source may become 
inoperative.
Depending on the purpose and application of the converter, different 
requirements may be imposed on its efficiency, reliability, cost, mass, and 
size. These requirements are often contradictory.
An analog or digital control signal (or signals) is sent to the input of 
the control system, specifying the basic electrical parameters in the load. 
Many specialists represent converters as amplifiers, to whose input a con-
trol signal is supplied, while the output is a voltage. Of course, this is a 
very approximate description, and the actual converter properties differ 
considerably from those of an amplifier.
The converter (including the control system) may also be character-
ized as an information transmitter. The converter’s forced characteristic is 
consistent with this approach (Section 1.2).
The control characteristic is the dependence of the converter’s basic out-
put parameter (e.g., the effective value of the fundamental of the output 
voltage) on the control signal (e.g., the voltage). The control characteris-
tic may be recorded with or without feedback. In some cases, the con-
trol characteristic may be the dependence of the output parameter on the 
modulated parameter of the power component (e.g., the switching delay α 
or the filling coefficient γ, which is the ratio of the time that the switch is 
on to the total switching period).

The dynamic parameters of the converter include the following:
•	 The maximum (ΔUmax) and minimum (ΔUmin) deviations of the out-
put voltage in transient conditions
•	 The duration of the transient control process, ending when the sys-
tem enters a steady state within the permissible range
•	 The margin of stability
•	 The degree of oscillation of the transient process
1.5  ac and dc filters
As noted in Section 1.2, secondary sources based on converters form an 
output voltage and current of complex harmonic composition. The higher 
harmonics are limited by means of filters based on reactive components: 
chokes and capacitors. Despite many types of converters, these filters are 
of similar structure.
In Figure 1.7, we show the standard filter structures used in power 
electronics.
The L-shaped LC filter (Figure 1.7a) is used in dc and ac filters. Figure 
1.8 shows the filter’s transmission factor and the modulus of its input 
impedance as a function of frequency, with different values of the load 
resistance: the rated load Zrat (continuous curves) and 20Zrat (dotted curves).
The frequency characteristics may be divided into three regions:
	
1.	The transmission region, where the filter’s transmission factor Kf ≈ 1, 
whereas the input impedance is large
	
2.	The suppression region, where Kf ≪ 1, whereas the input impedance 
is large

In the intermediate region, the frequency spectrum of the converter’s 
output voltage should not contain harmonics, because it is not suppressed 
but rather amplified by the filter. The upper bound on the intermediate 
region is fbo ≈ (2–3)fres.
The dc filter is intended to reduce (smooth out) the pulsations on the 
dc side. The smoothing factor Sf is the ratio of the voltage ripple factors at 
the filter input and output.
Consider the filters for voltage converters with a forced characteristic. 
When using an LC filter (Figure 1.7a), if we neglect the losses, the filter’s 
transmission factor for the constant component is Kf(0) = 1. In the suppres-
sion region, the filter’s transmission factor in the worst conditions (zero 
load) for single-phase rectifier is

If we neglect the losses, the transmission factor of the inductive filter 
(Figure 1.7b) for the constant component is again Kf(0) = 1. With an active

The smoothing efficiency is sharply reduced with an increase in Rlo. 
Therefore, the inductive filter is only used for low-resistance loads with 
little variation.
When connected to a voltage converter, the capacitive filter (Figure 
1.7c) either eliminates the converter’s voltage-source properties or imper-
missibly overloads the converter switches with high current harmonics.
Conversely, in current converters, the capacitive filter is always used. 
The high-frequency components of the filter current are shunted directly 
through this filter, bypassing the load.
The ac filter is used to reduce the content of higher harmonics in the 
load voltage and current. The following requirements are imposed on ac 
filters for voltage converters:
	
1.	The filter’s transmission factor for the fundamental must be as close 
as possible to 1 (i.e., Kf1 ≈ 1) at all loads. The losses of the fundamen-
tal voltage harmonic in the filter must be minimal. That permits 
the retention of the hard characteristic and eliminates the need to 
increase the converter’s supply voltage.
	
2.	The converter’s higher voltage harmonics must be suppressed 
enough to permit the functioning of the load circuits. The transmis-
sion factor in the suppression region is limited: Kf.h ≤ Kreq. Here Kreq 
is the ratio of the required THD on the load side to the THD at the 
filter input.
	
3.	Limits must be imposed on the reactive currents corresponding to 
the fundamental and the higher harmonics shunted through the 
filter, bypassing the load. This permits reduction in the currents 
through the converter’s semiconductor switches and the currents 
through the converter at zero load.
With a load that varies widely, the LC filter is commonly used (Figure 
1.7a).
To minimize the losses of the fundamental voltage harmonic in the 
filter, the choke inductance L must be limited. In Figure 1.9, we show the 
dependence of the filter’s transmission factor for the fundamental volt-
age harmonic on its choke inductance. The inductance is presented in 

17
Chapter one:  Basic concepts and terms in power electronics
the normalized form: L* = 2 Lπfout/Zlo.min, where Zlo and φ are the modu-
lus of the impedance and phase angle of the load, for the fundamental, 
respectively.
The inductance selected from Figure 1.9 may be insufficient for limi-
tation of the reactive current’s higher harmonics, which are shunted 
through the filter, bypassing the load, as the modulus of the filter’s input 
impedance for higher harmonics is Zin.high. = 2 Lπf, where f ≥ fbo.
In that case, the inductance is selected so as to limit the reactive cur-
rent. To ensure a hard characteristic, capacitor C1 is added to the filter 
(Figure 1.7d). Resonance in the L–C1 series circuit is observed at the fun-
damental. Therefore, neglecting the losses, we may assume that Kf1 = 1.
The fundamental of the reactive current shunted through the filter, 
bypassing the load, is determined by capacitor C at the fundamental. If 
this reactive current is large, we must introduce an additional choke L1 in 
the filter (Figure 1.7d), so that the resonant frequency of the L1–C parallel 
circuit corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the converter, and 
the filter blocks the fundamental of the reactive current.
The filters corresponding to Figure 1.7d have significant deficiencies 
due to the oscillatory circuits with resonance at the fundamental.
	
1.	They are significantly heavier, larger, and more expensive than fil-
ters corresponding to Figure 1.7a.
	
2.	The filter may only function at constant output frequency.
At small fbo/ffu, we need to switch from the filter in Figure 1.7a to that in 
Figure 1.7d. The use of powerful semiconductor switches with high switch-
ing frequency permits expansion of the output-voltage range that is free of 
harmonics (e.g., see Figure 1.3d) and an increase in fbo/ffu. In that case, the

Power electronics basics
use of an L-shaped LC filter meets all the requirements on the filter param-
eters, with minimal filter cost.
As a rule, ac output filters for current converters correspond to Figure 
1.7c. The expansion of the output-current range that is free of harmonics 
reduces filter costs and improves its mass and size.
1.5.1  Dynamic processes in filters
The output filters of converters contain reactive elements in which energy 
is stored. The transient processes when the operating conditions are 
changed (at startup, adjustment of the load, modification of the supply 
voltage, etc.) are largely determined by the processes in the filter. When 
the load varies widely, LC filters are used in both dc and ac circuits.
Now consider the dynamic processes in an L-shaped LC filter (Figure 
1.7a).
When current flows through choke L, the energy stored there is

With an abrupt decrease in the load current—for example, on switch-
ing off a power consumer—the energy at the choke is supplied to capaci-
tor C, thereby increasing its energy

and the load voltage. The output voltage begins to oscillate at the filter’s 
resonant frequency ωres, until the excess energy has been scattered in the 
load. The surges in the output voltage are proportional to L C  and may 
considerably exceed the steady output voltage.
The intensity of the output-voltage surges may be reduced by reduc-
ing L and increasing C, with constant resonant frequency of the filter. 
However, this is not always feasible, as it increases the currents through 
the converter switches or results in a converter characteristic that is no 
longer hard. To reduce the voltage surges in the load circuit, we may intro-
duce nonlinear elements: varistors.
With an abrupt increase in the load power, the filter capacitor dis-
charges its stored energy to the load. Consequently, the capacitor voltage 
falls, and there is a trough in the load voltage. The transient process con-
tinues until the capacitor’s energy has been replenished from the convert-
er’s power source.

Semiconductor power switches 
and passive components
2.1  Introduction
The limiting mean current of semiconductor power switches is 10 A or 
more. They may be divided into controllable components (transistors and 
thyristors) and noncontrollable components (diodes). The designation of 
power switches indicates the basic semiconductor material, the purpose, 
or the operating principle of the switch (Rozanov et al., 2007).
In terms of the basic semiconductor material, we distinguish between 
silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and gallium-arsenide (GaAs) components. 
Most power switches are based on silicon. Recently, other semiconductors 
have also been employed: indium compounds (InP and InAs) and silicon 
carbide (SiC).
2.2  Power diodes
In terms of function, power diodes may be divided into the following 
types: rectifier diodes, avalanche rectifier diodes (voltage limiters), ava-
lanche rectifier diodes with controllable breakdown (voltage stabilizers), 
and pulsed diodes.
2.2.1  Power diodes with p+–n−–n+ structure
A power diode with a p−n junction has the semiconductor structure 
p+–n−–n+ (Figure 2.1). The central n− layer is the base. In terms of the 
electrophysical characteristics, this is the intrinsic silicon semiconduc-
tor, with a relatively low donor concentration: Nd ≈ (5–7) × 1013 cm−3. In 
contrast, the external positive layers of the diode structure are highly 
doped and accordingly are generally described as emitters (Yevseyev 
and Dermenzhi, 1981).
When a reverse voltage is applied to the diode, the external electric 
field is mainly concentrated within the high-resistance base. The presence 
of the highly doped emitter layer n+ ensures an almost rectangular elec-
tric field strength in the base. Consequently, the working voltage of the 
power diode may be practically twice that of the standard p+–n− structure.

If the calculated value of W0 is less than 150 μm, we select 150 μm 
as the thickness of the n− base so as to ensure the required mechanical 
strength in the silicon plate.
When W0 > 150 μm, we select the thickness Wn− of the n− base as equal 
to W0, or even a little less than W0 in view of the protective n+ emitter layer 
limiting electric field propagation.
The total thickness of the initial silicon plate also includes the depth w 
of the p+–n− and n+–n− junctions

With a forward voltage at the diode, the electron–hole junction p+–n− 
acquires a forward bias, and hole injection from the highly doped p+ layer 
to the diode base begins.
In filling the base, the injected holes will move toward the n+–n− junc-
tion. The initial doping of the n+ emitter layer is specified so that most of 
the holes cannot overcome the potential barrier of the n+–n− junction. They 
begin to accumulate close to the n+–n− junction. Their positive charge is

compensated by an influx of electrons from the n+–n− junction, which 
acquires a forward bias. Thus, double hole injection occurs in the p+–n−–n+ 
structure of the power diode. The n− layer (the base) is filled with electron–
hole plasma from both sides.
The voltage drop at the n+–n− junction is somewhat less than that at 
the p+–n− junction. The total voltage at the diode’s junction may be esti-
mated as

where φT is the thermal potential (0.025 V at room temperature), IF the for-
ward diode current, and IS the saturation current (IS ≈ 10−6–10−12 for silicon 
junctions).
With high forward-current density in the n− base, injection is vigorous. 
As the semiconductor structure is characterized by double injection, the 
electrical conductivity of the base increases in proportion to the current. 
Consequently, the forward voltage drop at the n− base remains practically 
constant and does not depend on the diode current or the resistivity of the 
base. The voltage drop at the base in this case may be estimated as

where Lp is the diffusional length of the holes in the n− base.
With an increase in the current density to 100–300 A/cm2, the mutual scat-
tering of electrons and holes begins to affect the forward voltage in the 
base. In that case, the concentration of charge carriers in the base reaches 
(7–8) × 1016 cm−3 or more; their mobility is inversely proportional to their 
concentration and the conductivity of the base no longer depends on the 
current. An additional component of the voltage drop proportional to the 
forward current IF is then seen in the diode’s base.
Taking account of all the relevant factors, we may write the forward 
voltage at the power diode in the form

2.2.2  Schottky power diodes
The operational principle of the Schottky diode is based on the interac-
tion between a metal and a depleted layer of a semiconductor, and the 
contact between which has rectifier properties in certain conditions. 
Schottky diodes are based on n− silicon with electron conductivity. The 
highly doped n+ substrate has a donor concentration of 5 × 1018–5 × 1019 
cm−3 and its thickness is 150–200 μm; this is determined by the thick-
ness of the initial silicon plate. The presence of a highly doped substrate 
considerably reduces the resistance of the diode and ensures satisfactory 
ohmic contact with the metallized cathode layer. The active n− base of 
the Schottky diode has a lower impurity concentration (3 × 1015 cm−3); its 
thickness wB is determined by the diode’s working voltage and is in the 
range from a few microns to tens of microns. To minimize extreme ava-
lanche breakdown and to increase the electric field strength in the base, 
the diode includes a system of guard rings with a p−n junction, whose 
depth is a few microns (Figure 2.2).
The voltage drop at the junction in the Schottky diode is less than that 
for a diode with a p−n junction, whereas the reverse currents are greater 
(Melyoshin, 2005).
The forward voltage in the Schottky diode consists of two main com-
ponents: the voltage at the junction and the voltage at the active-region 
resistance in the n− base of the diode

With an increase in the maximum reverse voltage of the Schottky 
diode, the resistance of the n− base increases, as the creation of higher 
reverse ­voltage requires a more extended weakly doped region with 
lower charge-carrier concentration. As a result, the resistance of the n− 
base in high-voltage Schottky diodes is significantly increased. This is the

main reason for the upper limit of 200–400 V on the working voltage of 
such diodes.
2.2.3  Pulsed diodes
Pulsed diodes are intended for pulsed and high-frequency operation; their 
transient processes are relatively brief. Two basic structures may be noted 
(Figure 2.3): with a p–n junction (diffused and epitaxial pulsed diodes) 
and with a metal–semiconductor junction (pulsed Schottky diode).
Pulsed Schottky diodes have the shortest switching time (a few nano-
seconds) because there is no accumulation of secondary charge carriers. 
In the transient process occurring when the diode is switched off, there 
are practically no reverse current surges; the reverse recovery time is 
determined solely by the recharging time for the junction’s barrier capaci-
tance. However, the blocking voltage is not more than 200–400 V for sili-
con-based diodes. For pulsed Schottky diodes based on gallium arsenide 
(GaAs), the maximum reverse voltage is somewhat larger, up to 600 V. 
Currently, the largest blocking voltages are obtained for diodes based on 
SiC, up to 1700 V. In the absence of injection and modulation of the base 
layers, the working currents of the pulsed Schottky diodes are not more 
than tens of amperes.
Various parameters determine the switching inertia of pulsed diodes 
with a p–n junction. When the pulsed diode is switched on, the initial 
voltage surge is relatively large. The voltage surge is determined by the 
initial resistance of the diode’s base layer rB0 and the forward-current 
amplitude IF and may be a few tens or even hundreds of volts. As charge 
accumulates in the base, the forward voltage at the diode falls to a steady 
value (Figure 2.4).

Power electronics basics
The time in which the forward voltage at the diode first rises and then 
falls to 110% of its steady value U0 is known as the time tfr to establish the 
diode’s forward resistance.
When a pulsed diode with a p–n junction is switched off, the reverse 
current rises sharply and then falls to zero (Figure 2.5).
On account of the excess charge in the diode’s base, the maximum 
reverse current may be several times the amplitude of the forward cur-
rent. The surge in the reverse current may be characterized by a dynamic 
parameter: the reverse recovery charge Qrr of the pulsed diode. Essentially, 
Qrr is the integral of the reverse current at the diode. The time in which 
the reverse current begins to rise and then falls to 0.2 of the maximum 
value is known as the recovery time trr of the diode’s reverse resistance 
(Voronin, 2005).
The maximum blocking voltage of epitaxial pulsed diodes with a rela-
tively narrow base is 600–1200 V. As a rule, diodes with a reverse voltage

greater than 1200 V are produced by diffused technology. The maximum 
reverse blocking voltage in such diodes is around 6500 V. A typical value 
of the mean forward current for the semiconductor crystals (chips) of 
pulsed diodes with a p–n junction is 50, 100, or 150 A. By connecting indi-
vidual chips in parallel, working currents up to thousands of amperes 
may be obtained.
The use of pulsed diodes in high-power systems imposes an addi-
tional requirement on the dynamics of reverse recovery, which must cor-
respond to a specified softness characteristic. To that end, we introduce the 
softness coefficient S, which is the ratio of the components of the recovery 
time trr for the diode’s reverse resistance: the time tf for the reverse current 
to fall and the time ts in which it rises is
	
S

(2.8)
The voltage surge at the diode in recovery depends on the rate di/ dt 
at which the forward current falls (usually regulated in the circuit) and 
on the parasitic installation inductance Ls. However, with sharper drop 
in the diode’s reverse current, the voltage surge at the diode will be 
greater. To minimize the voltage surge, the softness coefficient must be 
greater than 1. As a rule, for diodes with soft recovery, the rate at which 
the reverse current falls is approximately equal to the rate at which it 
rises.
2.3  Power bipolar transistors
At the relatively high working voltages of power bipolar transistors 
(102–103 V), it is difficult to create an n+–p−–n+ structure with a thin base. 
However, unless that is accomplished, the frequency properties of the 
transistor will be significantly impaired. In particular, there will be a sig-
nificant reduction in the limiting amplification frequency fT at which the 
current’s amplification factor is reduced to 1. The limiting frequency fT 
may be determined from the formula
	
f

(2.9)
where |h21E| is the modulus of the current’s amplification factor (pre-
sented in handbooks for each type of the transistor) and f is the frequency 
at which |h21E| is measured.
Therefore, the n+–p–n−–n+ structure is used for power bipolar transis-
tors. The lightly doped n− layer is the high-resistance region of the collec-
tor (Figure 2.6).

Power electronics basics
Power transistors are primarily intended for operation, with a 
common emitter. Therefore, their working voltage is determined by 
the maximum permissible constant collector–emitter voltage UCEmax. 
Knowing UCEmax, we may calculate the avalanche breakdown voltage of 
the ­collector–­emitter system

Depending on the resistance of the collector layer, the voltage UCE(sat) 
for silicon transistors is 1–2 V for low-voltage components and 4–5 V for 
high-voltage components.
From the limiting amplification frequency fT, we may calculate the 
transition time τC of the charge carriers through the base and the lifetime 
τB of the charge carriers in the transistor, which determine its dynamic 
properties

where αN is the amplification factor of the current in a system with a com-
mon base and βN is the amplification factor of the current in a system with 
a common emitter. Note that αN = βN/(1 + βN).
In the amplifier mode, the bipolar transistor operates in the active 
region of its output characteristics. In the switching mode, which is more 
typical of power transistors, a control signal switches the component from 
the closed state (cutoff) to the open state (saturation) and back, so that it 
traverses the active region at the switching fronts. To guarantee satura-
tion, the basic control current in the transfer is specified with a margin, 
depending on the transistor’s saturation factor

Here τ0 = τB + (1 + βN)CCBRlo is the equivalent time constant when the 
influence of the collector–base capacitance of the transistor is taken into 
account and Rlo is the load resistance.
The presence of a high-resistance collector layer leads to an additional 
working region (the presaturation region) on the transistor’s output char-
acteristics (Figure 2.7). The boundary between the active region and the 
presaturation region is described by the equation

(2.19)
where rC0 = ρnWC/S is the initial resistance of the collector’s n− region and 
S is the area of the transistor structure.
When the transistor’s switching trajectory intersects with the presat-
uration region, the variation in the collector current slows significantly. 
In the transient switching process, we observe slow intervals, which are 
known as quasi-saturation intervals and quasi-storage intervals, respec-
tively, when the transistor is being switched on and off. With an increase 
in resistivity of the collector’s high-resistance region, these intervals 
become longer. When the resistance of the collector’s n− layer is modu-
lated by the accumulated charge, the transistor’s base region expands 
(the Kirk effect and the induced base effect). The current transfer coef-
ficient βN declines here, and the charge-carrier lifetime τB increases. 
That largely explains the slowing of the current fronts ton and toff and 
limits the speed of high-voltage bipolar transistors. For example, the

switching time of a bipolar transistor calculated for a working voltage 
UCEmax = 500 V may be 5–10 μs.
Another feature of power bipolar transistors is the displacement of the 
current associated with the longitudinal resistance of the p base. As the 
transistor’s base current flows parallel to the emitter plane, the potential 
of the p base declines in the direction of the current. If the decrease in the 
potential exceeds 2φT, the current density in the central part of the emitter 
will differ by practically an order of magnitude from that at its periph-
ery. Correspondingly, the load current density will be localized within 
the transistor—at the edges of the emitter when the transistor is switched 
on and in the central part of the emitter when the transistor is switched 
off. Thus, only the part ΔXE of the emitter is in the conducting state, where

where WB is the width of the transistor’s p base.
To reduce the influence of current displacement, the emitter is pro-
duced in annular, involute, and ridged forms, whose cross-section cor-
responds to ΔXE.
The deficiencies of power bipolar transistors may be partially over-
come by using composite designs.
To increase the amplification factor of the current, we may use com-
posite transistors based on Darlington and Sziklai circuits (Figure 2.8). In 
the composite transistor, the current transfer factor is practically βN1βN2.
To increase the maximum permissible voltage and the cutoff speed, an 
avalanche design with emitter switching is used for the transistor (Figure 
2.9). In that case, the cutoff speed is increased by a factor of βN, whereas 
the limiting voltage is the breakdown voltage UCB0 of the collector–base 
junction, which is about 150% of the value for an ordinary common emit-
ter transistor.
To improve the frequency characteristics of the transistor and to 
reduce the storage time ts, unsaturated switches with nonlinear feedback 
may be used (Figure 2.10).

2.4  Thyristors
2.4.1  Controllable semiconductor switches with p–n–p–n 
structure
Switches with p–n–p–n structure have two stable states. Their operation 
depends on internal feedback. The thyristor structure is based on four 
layers p–n–p–n and three p–n junctions: the anode junction, the central 
junction, and the cathode junction (Figure 2.11).
If we regard the thyristor as consisting of an n–p–n transistor and a 
p–n–p transistor, such that the collector of each transistor is connected to 
the base of the other (Figure 2.12), we may describe its volt–ampere char-
acteristics in the form (Gentry et al., 1964)

where IA is the thyristor’s anode current, Ig the control current in the 
­thyristor’s p base, αNPN the transfer factor of the current in the n–p–n tran-
sistor, αPNP the transfer factor of the current in the p–n–p transistor, and 
IC0 the thermal current of the central junction.
When the thyristor is off, forward and reverse blocking is observed 
(Figure 2.13).
If a forward voltage is applied to the thyristor (with positive polarity 
at the anode), the central p–n junction of the structure is closed. The space-
charge region begins to penetrate mainly into the most lightly doped n 
base of the thyristor, moving away from the central junction. If a reverse 
voltage is applied to the thyristor, the anode and cathode p–n junctions of 
the structure are closed. As the cathode junction adjacent to the control 
electrode is characterized by very poor closing properties (as a rule, cor-
responding to a voltage not greater than 15–20 V), the space-charge region 
penetrates into the n base of the thyristor, moving away from the anode 
junction. Thus, both forward and reverse blocking will depend on the 
dimensions and degree of alloying of the n base.
If the switch is off and the electric field strength in the space-charge 
region reaches the critical value, avalanche breakdown begins. The

When the thyristor is on, it corresponds to a diode p+–i–n+ structure

the thyristor (L ≈ 1.2Lp).
The dynamic parameters of the thyristor are determined by the 
switching times of the p–n–p–n structure.
When the thyristor is switched on, we may identify four basic stages: 
the switching delay, regeneration, establishment of a steady state, and prop-
agation of the on state over the whole area of the structure (Figure 2.14).
The switching delay depends on the amplitude of the control cur-
rent supplied to the thyristor’s p base. For powerful thyristors, as a rule, 
Ico ≥ 1 A, and the delay time is relatively small (not more than 0.2 μs).
The regeneration stage is characterized by an avalanche increase in

With an increase in the anode current, the thyristor voltage declines, 
whereas the voltage drop at the high-resistance n base increases. When 
the anode voltage and the voltage at the base are approximately equal, 
the avalanche growth in the anode current ends, and the establishment 
of a steady state begins. At that stage, the modulation of the n base’s con-
ductivity increases. The voltage drop at the thyristor’s base layer declines 
more or less exponentially

•	 Reversal of the polarity of the anode voltage UAC
•	 Supply of a reverse (negative) current Ig

(gate)
A thyristor that is switched off in the anode circuit is known as a 
semiconductor-controlled rectifier. A thyristor that is switched off by 
reverse current in the control circuit is known as a gate turn-off (GTO) 
thyristor.
In all cases, essentially, the excess charge that accumulates as a result 
of the forward anode current is reduced to some minimal or critical value, 
at which the device is able to withstand the anode voltage and remains in 
the off state.
The time for the excess charge in the thyristor bases to fall to the criti-
cal value is sometimes known as the shutoff time tq.
When the thyristor is switched off by reversing the polarity of the 
anode voltage, as a rule, the n–p–n transistor is the first to shut down, as 
its p base is more highly doped. Thereafter, the p–n–p transistor operates

2.4.2  Power photothyristors
A photothyristor is a unidirectional p–n–p–n current switch that is turned 
on by the action of light.
Two main designs are known: with an illuminated emitter and with 
an illuminated base (Yevseyev and Dermenzhi, 1981).
The photothyristor with an illuminated base is the main component 
in power electronics (Figure 2.15). This structure responds not to the inten-
sity of illumination, but to the radiant flux. Consequently, the sensitivity 
to light may be increased without a significant increase in the gain of the 
component transistors. This, in turn, permits an increase in the critical 
rate of voltage growth at the photothyristor and reduces the temperature 
dependence of the switching voltage. The resistance of the photothyristor 
to fast growth in the anode current is ensured by including a regenerative 
control electrode in the structure. The auxiliary structure employed is a 
light-controlled p–n–p–n structure, whose anode current stimulates the 
basic structure in the p base.

where Iph1 is the photoflux through the anode junction and Iph2 is the pho-
toflux through the central junction.
According to Equation 2.34, a photothyristor with an illuminated base 
corresponds to a p–n–p–n structure in which the collector of the p–n–p 
transistor in a common emitter circuit is supplied to the p base, whereas 
the photocurrent Iph1 + Iph2 is supplied to the n base. The volt–ampere 
characteristic of the photothyristor with an illuminated base qualitatively 
resembles that of a current-controlled p–n–p–n structure.
In design terms, the photothyristor is analogous to a high-voltage tab-
let thyristor, but the photothyristor has an optical input rather than an 
electrical control output.
In the center of the photothyristor’s cathode base, there is an optical 
window, which is close to the photosensitive region of the semiconduct-
ing structure.
The photothyristor is controlled by means of optical interface cable 
(Figure 2.16).
At one end, it is inserted into the slot of the tablet’s cathode base; the 
other end is connected through an optical socket to a laser diode. The 
light pulse is supplied to the photosensitive region of the silicon structure 
from the laser diode through a fiber-optic cable, an adapter, and an optical 
window.
The photothyristor is controlled by an IR pulse. The control pulse is 
transmitted to the photosensitive region of the silicon structure through 
Light flux

a fiber-optic light guide. It is connected optically to the photothyristor 
housing and to a laser diode, for example, an Osram SPL-PL90 diode, 
with an optical wavelength of 0.88–0.98 μm. The length of the light guide 
is practically unlimited, as the damping of the control signal is very 
slight (about 1 dB/km). The laser diode converts the electric signal from 
the control driver into a light pulse that mimics the shape and length of 
the electrical pulse.
2.4.3  Symmetric thyristors
The properties of five-layer n–p–n–p–n structures are employed in sym-
metric thyristors, also known as triacs. The volt–ampere characteristics 
of these components include two sections of negative resistance on the 
forward and reverse branches, which permits ac control (Figure 2.17).
The structure of a symmetric n–p–n–p–n switch with shunted emit-
ters is shown in Figure 2.18.
This component is called a diac. It consists of two p–n–p–n sections 
in parallel but in opposite directions. The diac structure becomes con-
ducting on account of the application of a voltage exceeding the switching 
voltage to its electrodes or by a sharp increase in the applied voltage, with 
a steep front. On the basis of that structure, controllable switches may 
be created by adding gates to the base regions p1 and p2. However, this 
design is unpromising for powerful components because of the presence

of two gates, one of which must pass through the lower plane of the semi-
conducting plate.
In a regular thyristor, the gate is connected directly to the p base and is 
unable to inject charge carriers. This is known as an ohmic gate. Another 
thyristor design includes an additional p–n junction directly below the 
gate; this junction is able to inject carriers into the base. This is known as 
an injecting gate. Note that the control current in this structure flows from 
the gate.
Then, for an ordinary thyristor built on an n-type silicon plate, the 
base supports an anode (a p-type emitter). This is a forward-biased 
structure. If the base supports a cathode (an n-type emitter), we obtain a 
reverse-biased structure.
In the thyristor, forward current flows toward the plane with the gate. 
The incoming gate current is positive. Then we distinguish the following 
basic types of thyristor p–n–p–n structures (Yevseyev and Dermenzhi, 
1981):
	
1.	A forward-biased structure with an ohmic gate, which conducts for-
ward current, with positive gate current
	
2.	A reverse-biased structure with an injecting gate, which conducts 
reverse current, with negative gate current
	
3.	A forward-biased structure with an injecting gate, which conducts 
forward current, with negative gate current
	
4.	A reverse-biased structure with an ohmic gate, which conducts 
reverse current, with positive gate current
Symmetric controllable switches are assembled from different combi-
nations of these structures.
For example, the TS161 triac combines elementary structures 1 and 4 
on a single chip. The KU208 triac combines structures 1 and 2 on a single 
chip. The TS222 triac combines structures 1 and 3 on a single chip.

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
In the transient process when elementary triac structures with 
ohmic and injecting gates are switched on, two structures are turned on 
in succession: first, the auxiliary (control) structure and then, by means 
of the control structure’s current, the basic triac structure. The practical 
model of the transient process when such double structures are turned 
on may be reduced to a single structure. In fact, when a double struc-
ture is turned on, stages of regeneration, establishment of a steady state, 
and propagation of the on region are observed, as in a regular thyristor. 
For example, the time to turn on the TS161 triac is about 20 μs, which 
corresponds to the time required to turn on a regular thyristor of the 
same power.
As the application of negative voltage to the gate switches on any triac, 
the structure may only be switched off by applying reverse voltage to the 
power anode and cathode. Note, however, that this is not the case for gates 
with positive control current. In that case, a negative control current may 
be supplied to the gate without switching off the triac.
The resistance of triacs to the dV/dt effect is characterized by two 
parameters. Here, we distinguish between the critical growth rate of the 
forward voltage with the same polarity as the forward current and the criti-
cal growth rate of the forward voltage with the opposite polarity to the for-
ward current. Typical values of the critical rate dV/dt are 10–20 V/μs.
2.5  Switched thyristors
2.5.1  The GTO thyristor
Ordinary p–n–p–n structures can only be switched off by a negative cur-
rent in the control circuit at relatively low load currents, when the sum of 
the current transfer factors of the component transistors is slightly more 
than 1.
An increase in the load current requires an increase in the switching 
current. Because of the finite longitudinal resistance of the base p layer, 
a reverse bias appears over some of the cathode junction. As the charge 
is removed from the p base by a negative current, we observe avalanche 
breakdown of the section of the cathode junction closest to the control elec-
trode. As a result, the remainder of the cathode junction will be shunted, 
and a bypass route becomes available for the negative control current. The 
switching of the thyristor by the gate is terminated.
To ensure high switching current, we must increase the avalanche 
breakdown voltage of the cathode junction. At the same time, the longi-
tudinal resistance of the p base must be reduced. However, these two 
requirements are mutually inconsistent. As a compromise, the longitudinal 
resistance of the p base is reduced by reducing the cathode’s emitter band. 
For example, a GTO thyristor with a maximum cutoff current of 600 A has a 

42
Power electronics basics
cathode structure consisting of 200 emitter bands (width 30 μm and length 
4 mm), each of which is covered by regions of the branched gate.
There are two basic GTO structures: with reverse blocking (used 
mainly in current inverters) and without reverse blocking (used mainly in 
voltage inverters). Both structures are shown in Figure 2.19. In the struc-
ture without reverse blocking, the anode emitter junction is shunted.
The volt–ampere characteristic of the GTO is of the same form as that 
for the structure that may be switched from the basic circuit. If we sub-
stitute a negative control current in the formula for the volt–ampere char-
acteristic, we may calculate the cutoff factor G, which is the ratio of the 
anode current to the switched current

The cutoff factor is a structural parameter and allows us to deter-
mine the amplitude of the switching current required to shut down the 
thyristor with specified load current. To increase G, the current transfer 
factor of the p–n–p transistor is increased, while ensuring that the sum of 
the transistor transfer factors is slightly more than 1. For modern GTOs, 
G = 4–8.
In the transient cutoff process, we may distinguish three states: 
resorption of the saturation charge in the thyristor bases; regenerative

junction (Figure 2.20).
In the first stage, under the action of the cutoff current, the concen-
tration of charge carriers in the thyristor bases is reduced. As a result, 
the central junction is no longer saturated. Then, both the component 
transistors become active, and avalanche (regenerative) drop in the

thyristor’s anode current begins on account of positive feedback. As 
negative control current develops only in one p base, the charge first 
falls to zero in that base. Positive feedback stops, and the n–p–n transis-
tor switches to the cutoff mode. In the third stage, the resorption of the 
charge in the base of the p–n–p transistor occurs with a broken base—in 
other words, by recombination. As a result, the residual anode current 
in the structure slowly falls, with a time constant practically equal to the 
carrier lifetime.
Handbooks for GTO thyristors present three parameters correspond-
ing to these stages: tgl, the time delay with respect to the gate; Ifg, the time 
in which the anode current declines (with respect to the gate); and ttq, the 
duration of the final cutoff stage.
2.5.2  Gate-commutated thyristors (GCTs, ETOs, MTOs)
The dynamic characteristics of GTOs are determined by their cutoff time, 
the main component of which is the time delay tgl with respect to the gate.
For specified amplitude of the anode current, the cutoff charge Qgq 
in the control circuit is practically independent of the growth rate of the 
negative control current (Figure 2.20).

These problems are largely overcome by switching the load current

mitted to the thyristor’s control circuit with G ≈ 1. Several versions of this 
approach may be noted (Li et al., 2000).
	
1.	Hard switching with connection of the negative voltage source to 
the control circuit (Figure 2.21). Such structures are known as gate-
commutated turn-off (GCT) thyristors.
	
2.	Emitter switching of the anode current by means of additional 
switches in the cathode and control circuits (Figure 2.22). Such struc-
tures are known as emitter turn-off (ETO) thyristors.
	
3.	Switching of the anode current by shunting the control electrode 
using an additional switch (Figure 2.23). Such structures are known 
as metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gate turn-off (MTO) thyristors.

2.5.3  The integrated GCT thyristor
One of the main problems in the control of gate-commutated thyristors 
is the distributed parasitic inductance LS in the switching circuit. It con-
sists of the inductance of the driver circuit (~100 nH), the supply buses 
(~200 nH), and the control electrode (~30 nH). At high switching speeds, 
with powerful anode currents (>103 A), the parasitic inductance LS may 
lead to unacceptable voltage surges in the control circuit (Figure 2.24).
For safe switching of a powerful anode current in the thyristor’s con-
trol circuit, a technique has been devised for connecting the contact areas 
of the housing to individual segments of the chip. To reduce the parasitic 
inductance of the supply buses, the control driver is integrated with the 
thyristor housing (Figure 2.25). This structure is known as an integrated 
GCT (IGCT) thyristor (Hidalgo, 2005).
2.5.4  The MOS-controlled thyristor
The MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) represents a relatively new class 
of semiconductor power components. In terms of switched power and 
switched current density, these components match GTOs. The MCT is 
controlled from a circuit with an insulated gate. The basic module of the 
MCT is analogous to the semiconductor structure of a powerful insulated

gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), into which two control MOS transistors 
with opposite types of conductivity are integrated (Figure 2.26).
The N-channel control transistor ensures positive feedback in the thy-
ristor’s p–n–p–n structure on shutdown. The P-channel control transistor 
interrupts the feedback by shunting the emitter junction of the p–n–p–n 
structure through the cathode in thyristor shutdown.
The main benefits of MCTs are increased speed and relatively low 
power consumption from the control circuit. The voltage-blocking prop-
erties of the MCT are comparable with those of GTOs, but their voltage in 
the open state is lower, the impact current is greater, and the resistance to 
dI/dt is greater.
Numerous MCT designs have been developed: with P and N current 
channels; with symmetric and asymmetric blocking; with unidirectional 
and bidirectional gates; and with different switching methods (e.g., by 
means of a light flux). However, most of these proposals are at the experi-
mental stage, in view of the complexity of the technology and the low 
yield of usable products.
2.6  Field transistors
2.6.1  Powerful short-channel MOS transistors
Transistors with metal–dielectric–semiconductor structure exist in two 
main forms: with a built-in current channel and with an induced cur-
rent channel. For powerful transistors, the induced-channel design 
is employed. In the transistor, the gate electrode is separated from the 
semiconductor by a layer of dielectric, usually silicon dioxide (SiO2). 
Accordingly, they are generally known as MOS transistors. The operation 
of such transistors is monitored on the basis of the gate voltage. An MOS 
transistor with an induced channel is nonconducting if there is no gate 
voltage. In order to produce current, the voltage applied to the gate must

be of the same polarity as the main mobile carriers within the semicon-
ductor. Charges of opposite sign are then induced in the semiconductor 
and reverse its type of conductivity; accordingly, a channel for current 
transmission is formed. Devices of N- and P-channel type are produced, 
although the former is preferable on account of the greater electron mobil-
ity (Figure 2.27).
Different types of MOS transistors are compared in terms of their 
design quality, which is determined by the ratio of the component’s ampli-
fication factor to the length of the pulse front at the output (Oxner, 1982)

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
It follows that the primary method of increasing the design quality for 
MOS transistors is to reduce the channel length. To this end, we use hori-
zontal and vertical multichannel structures with a short channel, created 
by double diffusion. The short channel ensures saturation of the carrier 
speed due to the strong electric field created by the drain voltage. As a 
rule, a structure with a horizontal cell is used for the manufacture of rela-
tively low-voltage transistors (not more than 100 V), although the currents 
in such components may reach tens or even hundreds of amperes.
The drain of an N-channel power MOS transistor contains a lightly 
doped n− region and a highly doped n+ region (Figure 2.28). When the 
transistor is off, the space-charge region created by the drain’s external 
voltage mainly travels toward the lightly doped n− region.
Thus, the limiting voltage of the components is determined by the 
dimensions of the drift region and its resistivity. With an increase in length 
of the drain’s drift region, the breakdown voltage increases. However, the 
auxiliary resistance between the drain and the source increases. The resis-
tance RD of the drift region may be estimated as

where κ = 8.3 ⋅ 10−9 Ω V1/n is a constant of proportionality for silicon with a 
chip area S = 1 cm2; n = 2.4–2.6 is an exponent; and U(BR)DS is the voltage of 
avalanche drain–source breakdown.
When the MOS transistor is on, its voltage is relatively high on account 
of current transfer by primary carriers and the impossibility of modula-
tion in the drain’s drift region. The resistance RDS(ON) of the MOS tran-
sistor, when it is on, consists of several parasitic resistances of different 
layers in the transistor structure; the contribution of the drift region is the 
most important. For transistors with a horizontal structure, RDS(ON) is dis-
tributed approximately equally between the drift region and the channel. 
For higher-voltage transistors with a vertical structure, the drift region 
accounts for 95% of RDS(ON).
To reduce the resistivity, the number of parallel cells in the structure 
is increased. However, this increases the chip area and cost. Therefore, as 
a rule, the maximum working voltage of MOS transistors is 600–800 V.
For MOS transistors with a U-shaped gate channel, RDS(ON) is lower 
than that for the standard structure. This technology permits the use of 
smaller basic cells and a greater channel density in the crystal (Figure 
2.29). Monolithic structure is more effective for high-current transistors.

Finally, the relatively low-voltage components with a horizontal struc-
ture are practically ideal switches in terms of both speed and residual 
voltage when on. For powerful MOS transistors with a working voltage 
up to 100 V at load currents of 100–300 A, for example, RDS(ON) is not more 
than a few milliohms.
We should also note that, if part of the p region of a powerful MOS 
transistor is connected to a metallized layer of the drain so as to prevent 
the appearance of a parasitic bipolar n–p–n transistor, an internal diode 
appears in parallel to, but also in the direction opposite to, the current 
channel (Figure 2.30). In terms of its electrical parameters, this diode cor-
responds to a power transistor and may therefore be used in practice. 
Note that the cutoff time of this diode is around 100 ns, which is greater 
than that for most independent diodes.
The dynamic characteristics of the MOS transistor are determined by 
the recharging rate of the parasitic capacitances between the basic elec-
trodes in the structure: CGS, CGD, and CDS. Handbooks present the input 
Ciss, through Crss, and output Coss capacitances measured at external elec-
trodes. These quantities are linearly related to the parasitic capacitances

shutoff properties of the antiphase diode are restored, the voltage at the 
MOS transistor begins to fall. Due to influence of negative feedback via 
the gate-drain capacitance CGD of transistor (the Miller effect), the input 
current in the gate circuit is practically completely compensated by the 
current recharging capacitance CGD. In those conditions, the front of the

In Figure 2.33, we show the cross-section of a CoolMOS power transistor.
In the CoolMOS device, in contrast to a regular transistor, the p 
column penetrates deeply into the active region of the structure. That 
ensures greater doping of the drift layer, adjacent to the n column. The 
resistance of the CoolMOS transistor in the on state is several times less 
than that of a regular MOS transistor (Arendt et al., 2011). The doping of

the p region is carefully monitored during the manufacture of the struc-
ture, as there must be absolutely no free carriers in that region when 
the transistor is off. The resistance of the drift layer in the CoolMOS 
transistor depends more or less linearly on the maximum permissible 
voltage U(BR)DS:

(2.50)
Here n ≈ 1.17 and κ = 6.0 × 10−6 Ω V1/n is the constant of proportionality 
with a chip area S = 1 cm2.
The electric field strength along the drift region of the CoolMOS tran-
sistor is practically rectangular. That increases the avalanche breakdown 
voltage. For mass-produced CoolMOS transistors, the maximum permis-
sible sink–drain voltages are 600 and 900 V, respectively.
Another benefit of CoolMOS transistors is that the output capacitance 
CDS is significantly nonlinear. With an increase in the drain voltage to 
tens of volts, the p region becomes depleted, with a marked decrease in 
CDS. Therefore, at high working voltages, the output capacitance of the 
CoolMOS transistor is much less than that for regular transistors. In the 
voltage range 350–400 V, the energy stored in the output capacitance is 
reduced by about 50%, with marked reduction in the switching losses as 
the switching frequency increases.
2.6.3  Static induction transistors
The static induction transistor (SIT) is a field transistor with a control p–n 
junction and a built-in current channel. In contrast to a regular field tran-
sistor, the very short channel in the SIT does not permit saturation of the 
drain current, analogous to the vacuum triode tube. For this reason, the 
SIT is sometimes regarded as the solid-state version of the vacuum triode 
(Oxner, 1982).
The SIT is based on an n-type silicon plate of thickness 0.4–0.9 mm. 
The n+ substrate is strongly doped with donor impurity (to concentrations 
around 5 × 1019 cm−3). Then, an epitaxial n− layer is grown on the substrate; 
this layer determines the structure’s breakdown voltage. The subsequent 
technological operations form the drain region and the control gate (grid).
The SIT has two basic structures, with the grid at the surface and in 
the depth (Figure 2.34).
With the grid in the depth, we obtain a low-frequency component 
used in devices at the acoustic frequency range. High-frequency SITs are 
manufactured with a surface gate, which has direct ohmic contact with 
the metallization layer. This permits sharp reduction in the series resis-
tance in the gate circuit.

56
Power electronics basics
The SIT is able to withstand large voltages between the drain and the 
source. The SIT is reliably turned off by applying a voltage that is negative 
to the gate, relative to the drain. The gate voltage may be determined as
	
U
U
G
D

(2.51)
where UD is the drain voltage of the SIT when it is off and μ is the external 
voltage amplification factor (the blocking factor) of the SIT.
The required value of μ is ensured in the manufacture of the transis-
tor. Its standard value is 102–103, depending on the voltage in the circuit.
The family of triode volt–ampere characteristics of the SIT (Figure 
2.35) is described by the equation

With high-current density in the transistor’s output circuit, we need 
to take account of the series resistance in the drain (RD) and source (RS).

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
On account of the relatively high resistance in the drift region and the 
increase in the forward voltage drop at the SIT, the drain current is not 
more than 10 A, as a rule.
At large load currents, the SIT switches to bipolar operation, with the 
application of positive voltage to the gate circuit. Then, a resistor whose 
magnitude specifies the amplitude of the forward control current IG
+  
appears in series with the gate. Hole injection from the controlling p+ grid 
of the gate sharply reduces the resistance of the drift region and reduces 
the forward voltage drop at the SIT.

, which is in the order of 102, in con-
trast to a regular bipolar transistor.
To ensure SIT operation at currents of 102–103 A, the structure is modi-
fied: a silicon plate characterized by hole conductivity is used as the sub-
strate (Figure 2.36).
This structure is switched on simply by removing the cutoff potential 
from the gate. Then the injection of charge carriers from the substrate to 
the drift region begins. This ensures effective modulation of the transis-
tor’s conductivity. An SIT of that structure is known as a field-controlled 
thyristor (FCT). Note that the FCT is switched in the absence of positive 
feedback. Consequently, the FCT is relatively resistant to pulsed noise 
(Voronin, 2005).
With injection from the control grid, as in bipolar SIT operation, or 
from the substrate (anode), as in the FCT, secondary charge carriers appear 
in the n− base. This significantly changes the transient processes, especially 
during shutdown. During shutdown, the holes are drawn from the n− base 
by a reverse-biased gate. Consequently, a current pulse that is relatively 
short but close in amplitude to the load current will act in the control cir-
cuit. In the FCT, we then observe the appearance of a parasitic p–n–p tran-
sistor whose emitter is the thyristor’s drain (anode), whereas its collector

is the gate. Its base is rapidly shut off, with closure of the primary current 
channel. The FCT then shuts down analogously to a p–n–p transistor with 
a broken base, that is, the charge declines slowly by recombination. Then, 
a residual current appears in the thyristor’s output and control circuits; its 
duration is approximately three times the charge-carrier lifetime.
Note that the powerful reverse-current flow appearing in the gate cir-
cuit on shutdown induces an additional potential, both at p+ points of the 
grid and at the output resistance of the control circuit. This reduces the 
cutoff voltage (Figure 2.37).
With relatively large resistance, the negative voltage in the gate circuit 
may be insufficient to form a reliable cutoff potential in the FCT channel. 
As a result, it is closed, and the thyristor is in a secondary-breakdown 
region.
The widespread practical introduction of the SIT and the FCT is hin-
dered because of manufacturing difficulties and because these switches 
are in conditions in which there is zero potential in the control circuit.
2.7  The IGBT
Field control and bipolar conductivity are integrated in the IGBT. Like the 
powerful MOS transistor, its structure includes a lightly alloyed drift n− 
layer, whose dimensions determine the maximum permissible voltage at 
the component. At the surface of the n− layer, a controlling MOS structure

the gate. Electric contact is formed between the n+ emitter structure and 
the n− drift region. The positive bias at the emitter of the p–n–p transistor 
in the IGBT structure results in the injection of secondary charge carri-
ers from the highly doped p+ layer to the drift region, with a consequent 
decrease in resistance. Thus, the monolithic IGBT structure combines con-
trol of the voltage at the high input resistance and the transfer of forward 
current with high permissible density.
The equivalent circuit of the IGBT is shown in Figure 2.39. It includes 
a controlling MOS transistor, a bipolar p–n–p transistor, and a field 
n-­channel transistor with a controlling p–n junction. The latter blocks the 
external voltage applied to the IGBT when it is closed, thereby protecting 
the controlling MOS from high voltage.
The collector current of the IGBT has two components: the primary 
electron current, which passes through channels in both field transistors, 
and the hole component in the output circuit of the p–n–p transistor.
The voltage drop at the channel resistance produces negative bias 
in the collector–base circuit of the p–n–p transistor, which is thereby 
switched to active operation. This is largely responsible for the increased 
saturation voltage in the monolithic IGBT, as the reverse bias of the collec-
tor junction in the p–n–p transistor ensures intense hole capture from the 
transistor’s base region, with a consequent increase in its resistance.
The saturation voltage of the IGBT consists of three components: the 
voltage drop at the base–emitter junction of the p–n–p transistor; the volt-
age drop at the channel of the controlling MOS transistor; and the ohmic

rent of the base–emitter junction, αPNP the current transfer factor in the 
common-base circuit of the p–n–p transistor, rMOS the resistance of the 
controlling MOS channel, and rn− the resistance of the modulated n− base.
The hole flux captured by the collector junction of the n–p–n transis-
tor traverses the longitudinal resistance of the section of the IGBT’s p base 
directly under the n+ emitter (Figure 2.40).
With current overload at the critical hole-current density, a forward 
bias is applied to the n+–p junction at the longitudinal resistance, and the 
parasitic n–p–n transistor formed by layers of the n+ emitter, the p base 
and the n− drift layer begins to operate. As the parasitic n–p–n transistor 
and the basic p–n–p transistor form a trigger circuit, the IGBT becomes 
uncontrollable and malfunctions.
The critical IGBT collector current at which such triggering occurs is

•	 Reducing the overall resistance of the p base
•	 Reducing the strip width of the n+ emitter
•	 Reducing the width of the region below the gate
•	 Reducing the amplification factor of the p–n–p structure
Better results may be obtained by combining these methods. However, 
the most effective method of increasing the IGBT’s critical current is to 
reduce the strip width of the n+ emitter.
The dynamic characteristics of the IGBT are assessed by the same 
parameters as for powerful MOS transistors. Manufacturers indicate the 
standard time delays and switching times, usually measured with an 
inductive load. The bipolar operation of the IGBT results in lower speed 
than for MOS transistors. When an IGBT is switched off, the controlling 
MOS channel is first closed, thereby shutting off the base output of the 
p–n–p transistor. Thus, the residual charge in the drift layer disappears 
solely as a result of relatively slow recombination. As a result, the plot of 
the switched current includes a long tail (Figure 2.41). The length of the 
tail is three to five times the carrier lifetime (from hundreds of nanosec-
onds to a few microseconds). The initial amplitude IT(0) of the residual 
current is proportional to the load current and depends nonlinearly on 
the voltage (Hefner and Blackburn, 1988). It may be estimated as

In the transient process when an IGBT (especially a high-voltage IGBT) 
is switched on, the voltage curve (Figure 2.41) includes a slow stabilization 
stage (dynamic saturation). This stage may last a few hundred nanosec-
onds. When the IGBT is off, the space-charge region mainly extends over 
the lightly doped drift region. However, it also penetrates slightly into the 
p base. The barrier capacitor formed by the depleted region in the p base 
offers practically no paths for fast discharge when the structure is switched 
on, which also gives rise to a dynamic saturation stage. The initial amplitude 
UQS(0) of the dynamic saturation voltage hardly depends on the load current; 
it is determined by the external supply voltage. In fact, UQS(0) depends on the 
doping of the IGBT’s base regions and may be 10–102 V, depending on the 
IGBT design and the supply voltage. It may be determined from the formula

Estimation of the dynamic losses in the IGBT on switching (the 
switching losses) is of great practical interest. In the literature, we may 
find values of the dynamic losses when the IGBT is switched on (EON) and 
off (EOFF), measured in specified electrical conditions. A relatively precise 
formula permits conversion of the handbook data to the dynamic losses

current in switching a load current from an antiphase diode. The critical 
factor presented in handbooks is the minimum permissible resistance RG 
connected in series with the IGBT’s gate. We do not recommend this choice.
In the transient process when an IGBT is switched off, the critical fac-
tor is the parasitic installation inductance LS, which is limited to 100 nH, 
as a rule.
The IGBTs in widest use are third-generation devices with a planar 
gate, manufactured by two basic technologies: the punch-through IGBT 
(PT-IGBT) and non-punch-through IGBT (NPT-IGBT). Fourth-generation 
devices use a vertical gate (the trench-gate IGBT), which permits maximum 
packing density of the components on the chip and reduces the static losses. 
Finally, fifth-generation devices [the soft punch-through IGBT (SPT-IGBT), 
field-stop IGBT (FS-IGBT), and carrier-stored trench-gate IGBT (CSTBT)] 
are characterized by optimized switching characteristics and conductivity.
2.7.1  Epitaxial (PT) and homogeneous (NPT) IGBT structures
The PT-IGBT is manufactured on a highly doped p+ substrate with hole 
conductivity. A high-resistance drift layer of n− type is then grown epi-
taxially on the substrate (Figure 2.42). Accordingly, this IGBT technology 
is also said to be epitaxial.
For a transistor with a working voltage of 600–1200 V, the drift layer 
measures 100–120 μm. Then a controlling MOS structure is formed on the 
n− layer by a technology analogous to that used in the production of pow-
erful MOS transistors. In epitaxial technology, the structure includes an 
additional n+ electron layer between the drift layer and the substrate; this 
is known as the buffer layer. The n+ layer is small (around 15 μm). The 
additional highly doped layer limits the electric field strength in the base 
of the IGBT when it is off, thereby increasing the resistance to avalanche 
breakdown. By adjusting the doping of the n+ layer, the injection properties 
of the emitter in the p–n–p transistor within the IGBT may be regulated. 
Hence, the required charge-carrier concentration may be established in the 
base of the IGBT, and the carrier life may be regulated. By means of the buf-
fer layer, it is also possible to modify the critical collector-current density 
at which the loss of controllability of the PT-IGBT is triggered. A deficiency 
of epitaxial technology is the temperature dependence of the residual cur-
rent, which increases the energy losses when the transistor is switched off.
The NPT-IGBT (Figure 2.43) is manufactured using a uniform 
n− substrate with electron conductivity (thickness 200 μm). A planar 
MOS gate is created on the upper side of the plate; on the opposite side, a 
p+ emitter is formed by ionic doping. The equivalent circuit of the result-
ing structure is the same as for a PT-IGBT.
As the NPT-IGBT structure lacks the highly doped buffer layer, a rela-
tively large n− substrate is used to ensure high resistance to breakdown. 

65
Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
This means that NPT-IGBT has a higher saturation voltage. However, the 
uniform structure is highly resistant to short circuits, has a positive temper-
ature coefficient of the voltage at all load currents, and has a safe operating 
region that is rectangular. The residual current of the NPT-IGBT persists for 
a relatively long time (a few microseconds), but the amplitude of the tail is 
about half that for the PT-IGBT and it hardly depends on the temperature.
2.7.2  Trench-gate IGBT
To reduce the saturation voltage of the IGBT, designers have created a 
structure with a vertical gate in a trench (Figure 2.44). The depth of the 
gate and the width of the trench are a few micrometers.
The operating principle of the trench-gate IGBT is as follows. Some of 
the holes, injected from the p+ region of the p–n–p transistor’s emitter to 
its p collector, reach its boundary and are captured by the electric field of 
the reverse-biased junction, as in a regular IGBT with a planar gate. Other 
holes, injected from the p+ region in the direction of the vertical gate’s 
base, cannot be captured at once by the collector of the p–n–p transistor,

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
and their charge accumulates at the section of the n− base immediately 
beneath the gate. To compensate the positive charge of the holes, intensi-
fied electron injection begins from the emitter’s n+ region, and the elec-
tron concentration increases in the region beneath the gate. As a result, a 
structure equivalent to a p–i–n diode, with a characteristic charge-carrier 
distribution close to its emitter layers in bilateral injection, is formed in 
the corresponding section of the IGBT (about half of the total transistor 
base). Then the structure of the IGBT base with a vertical gate may be 
regarded as a combination of elementary p–i–n and p–n–p structures of 
identical width (Udrea and Amaratunga, 1997). As a result, the saturation 
voltage of the trench-gate IGBT is reduced to around 1.4–1.7 V, which is 
about 30–40% less than that in a standard IGBT.
A downside of the trench-gate IGBT is its relatively high input capaci-
tance and the gradient for forward-current transfer. This requires the use 
of special control drivers and additional current-surge protection.
2.7.3  The trench-FS and SPT
On the basis of the PT-IGBT and NPT-IGBT structures, various new chips 
for power transistors have been developed. Note, in particular, the SPT 
(soft PT-IGBT) and trench-FS (trench-field stop) structures (Arendt et al., 
2011). They both include a built-in buffer n+ layer and employ smaller chip 
area (Figure 2.45).
The main parameters determining the frequency properties and 
application of the IGBT are the saturation voltage, the gate charge and 
circuit, and the switching losses.
SPT chips have optimized cutoff properties: a smooth and linear 
increase in the voltage at the transistor when it is off and limited duration

of the residual current. The switching losses are less for the SPT than for 
the standard IGBT.
The trench-FS chip has a deep vertical gate and a modified emitter 
structure, thereby ensuring optimal distribution of the carriers in the 
n− substrate. As a result, the saturation voltage is 30% less than that for 
standard NPT-IGBT. The increased current density in the trench-FS per-
mits significant reduction in the chip area, by almost 70%. However, the 
thermal resistance and charge in the gate circuit are higher than those in 
the standard design.
Both the SPT and trench-FS chips are characterized by elevated 
­resistance to short circuits. The upper limit on the current is six times the 
rated value.
2.7.4  The CSTBT and SPT+ 
In the IGBT of regular structure, hole capture is most intense in the sec-
tion of the base layer that is below the gate and is in direct contact with 
the reverse-biased collector junction p–n–p of the transistor. To increase 
the charge-carrier density in the base, an additional layer with electron 
conductivity is integrated into the structure of fifth-generation chips, 
between the p–n–p collector and the n− base (Voronin, 2005). The doping 
of the additional n layer is greater than that in the base, which creates 
an additional potential barrier to the hole current. As a result, most of 
the holes cannot overcome the potential barrier and collect close to the 
junction, thereby reducing the resistance of the base and the transistor’s 
saturation voltage. This technology is used in an IGBT with a planar gap 
(the SPT+; Figure 2.46) and an IGBT with a vertical gap (the carrier-stored 
trench-gate IGBT, CSTBT; Figure 2.47).

2.8.2  Assembly of power modules
The following are the key technologies in the assembly of power modules 
(Figure 2.57).
•	 Soldering
•	 Ultrasonic welding
•	 Sealing with silicon gel

Power electronics basics
Soldering is used to mount chips on a DBC (direct bonded copper) 
ceramic substrate. The quality of the soldering processes determines 
the thermal characteristics of the module and its thermocyclic strength. 
A promising alternative to soldering is low-temperature sintering of 
the semiconductor and the substrate by means of superfine silver pow-
der. This technology permits an increase in the module’s temperature to 
Figure 2.54  A three-level half-bridge with a fixed null point.

73
Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
300°C. Accordingly, low-temperature sintering is suitable for the installa-
tion of chips on an SiC base.
The buses of the DBC substrate, the chip outputs, the electrical connec-
tions, and the output terminals of the module housing must be designed 
to withstand the required current density. The critical point most sensi-
tive to current overloads is the joint between the chip outputs and the 
metallized buses of the DBC substrate. This joint is subject to considerable 
mechanical stress due to thermal expansion and contraction. Therefore, it 
is important to ensure high-quality microwelded joints. The current den-
sity may be increased if the aluminum conductors are replaced by flat 
copper terminals welded to the DBC substrate. Such joints tolerate much 
higher current loads and are more resistant to thermocycling.

Power electronics basics
A promising approach is the use of spring contacts, so that the power 
terminals have sprung contact with the copper buses, and the signal out-
puts take the form of springs. New modules of this type dispense with 
the base, as they are built on the ceramic substrate, which rests directly 
on the radiator.
In improving power-module topology, there is great interest in 
reducing the thickness of the DBC substrate and in enlarging the cop-
per plating. Recently, the thickness of the aluminum-oxide substrate was 
reduced from 0.63 to 0.38 mm. A new technology with zirconium addi-
tives reduces this value to 0.32 mm. Another promising approach is to use 
DBC substrates based on aluminum nitride or silicon nitride, which are 
characterized by better thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. 
An increase in thickness of the copper coating on the DBC substrate from 
0.3 to 0.6 mm is now feasible.
In the final stage of power-module manufacture, the space within the 
housing is sealed with silicon gel. The use of this gel ensures sealing and 
electrical insulation and also improves heat propagation.
2.8.3  Connecting the module to the power circuit
In intellectual power modules (IPMs) for home electronics, the chips are 
mounted directly on a printed circuit board (PCB), along with compo-
nents such as capacitors, filters, and connectors.
The power of such modules is not more than 100 W.
With an increase in the current density, the power module is mounted 
separately on control circuits. However, up to 100 A, direct contact of the 
module with the PCB is possible.
With an output current above 100 A, threaded contact of the module’s 
power terminals with the buses or cables of the power circuit is required. 
In the old designs, the power outputs are at the top surface of the module. 
In new designs, such outputs are placed at the edges of the housing, so as 
to accommodate the driver in the upper part (Figure 2.58).
For modules with very high current density (output current above 600 
A), special spring systems are used. For example, in the StakPak module, 
Figure 2.58  Power modules with threaded couplings (a) at the top surface of the 
module and (b) at the edges of the housing.

75
Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
a group of spring units is combined in a single assembly (a stack). These 
switches have no electrical insulation. They are connected to the power 
circuit by means of their upper and lower surfaces, which serve as the 
power terminals.
2.9  Power assemblies
2.9.1  Integrated power modules
An integrated power module with an output power of 10 kW consists of 
a B6U rectifier and a B6I inverter mounted in a housing with a braking 
switch and current and temperature sensors (Figure 2.59).
2.9.2  Intellectual power module
The IPM represents a higher level of integration and includes an intellec-
tual control driver.
Modern designs use a single-chip control driver for all the switches 
in the IPM. The driver is attached directly to the DBC substrate of the 
module.
2.9.3  Power assemblies of basic topology (1/2B2, B2, B6) 
with a dc element and a cooling system
Such power assemblies are equipped with a forced-cooling system 
and accordingly are mounted on an air- or liquid-cooled radiator. The 
power bus of the dc element is designed so as to be compact (minimum 
parasitic inductance due to installation) and reliable (limiting electrical

to 10 kW).

and thermal parameters). The dc element also includes an array of elec-
trolytic and safety capacitors. The output power of such assemblies is 
10–100 kW.
2.9.4  Power assemblies of B6U + B6I topology: Inverter platforms
An inverter platform provides a wide power range on the basis of a set of 
standard modules or cubes.
A single module takes the form of a cube whose faces measure 
around 40 cm. The module consists of a power cascade with a dc ele-
ment; driver circuits responsible for control, safety, and monitoring; and 
a set of sensors generating the basic analog signals required for the for-
mulation of control pulses. The output power of the inverter platform is 
10–900 kW.
2.9.5  Power bipolar assemblies
Structurally, power bipolar assemblies are diode–thyristor systems of 
topology B6U + B6C, equipped with cooling radiators, internal electri-
cal couplings based on copper buses, and safety circuits. In mechani-
cal terms, we may distinguish two groups: those with modular power 
devices and those with disk power devices (power columns). As a rule, 
those with modular power devices are used at voltages up to a few kilo-
volts, whereas those with disk power devices are used at 102–103 kV. The 
output power of bipolar assemblies ranges from hundreds of kilowatts to 
a few megawatts.
2.10  Applications of power switches
Although the basic types of semiconductor power switches are far from 
ideal, there are no fundamental obstacles to the creation of highly efficient 
power components over a wide power range: from a few watts to a few 
megawatts.
To identify their applications, power switches are classified in terms 
of their switching frequency and power.
The total world market for power modules is about $2.5 billion and is 
growing rapidly. The total may be broken down as follows.
•	 Bipolar diodes and thyristors: ~12%
•	 IGBT: ~48%
•	 Integrated power modules (rectifier + inverter): ~8%
•	 IPM (consisting of a power avalanche with a control circuit and 
­sensors): ~32%

77
Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
More than half of the power modules produced (56%) are used in 
drives. Manufacturers of industrial drives are interested in product lines 
that cover a broad power range. Note that these products are based on a 
single design platform, which facilitates the production of standardized 
converters.
Electrical transportation is the second largest consumer of power 
modules (10% of the total). The key requirements for such applications are 
high reliability and long-term availability of the components from a range 
of suppliers.
Home electronics accounts for about 9% of the total. The most popular 
components are low-current IPMs, whose power modules are produced in 
single in-line (SIL) and dual in-line (DIL) packages.
Two other important applications are renewable energy and auto elec-
tronics. Wind power accounts for a relatively small share (5%) but is grow-
ing extremely rapidly (by 25% a year). The requirements on components 
for renewable-energy applications are similar to those in transportation: 
reliable long-term operation and the ability to withstand challenging 
environmental conditions.
Likewise, auto electronics currently accounts for a relatively small 
share (4%) but is growing rapidly (by 19% a year). The requirements on 
such components are very rigorous and specific, including a broad range 
of operating temperatures and high resistance to thermocycling.
2.11  Cooling systems for semiconductor power 
devices
At currents of a few amperes or more, semiconductor power switches are 
mounted on radiators rapidly dispersing heat to the surroundings: air or 
water (Gentry et al., 1964).
The heat flux p (W) from the radiator to the surroundings may be 
calculated as

where h is the radiator’s heat-transfer coefficient (W/cm2 °C), A the radia-

temperature difference between the radiator surface and the surround-
ings (°C).
For radiators of specified structure, the heat-transfer coefficient h is 
the sum of the radiant component hR and the convective component hC:

2.11.1  Radiators for air cooling
With an increase in converter power, there is a growing demand for cooling 
equipment able to disperse considerable heat in a limited space. Attention 
focusses here on the material from which the radiator is made. The alloy 
employed must have the following characteristics (Mikitinets, 2007):
•	 High thermal conductivity
•	 Ease of machining
•	 Excellent corrosion resistance
As an example, Table 2.1 presents the basic characteristics of high-
quality 6060 alloy (according to standard European terminology).

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
The radiator structure must exhibit high machining precision. 
Table  2.2 presents the linear and angular precision of Tecnoal cooling 
radiators.
Cooling radiators may be divided into the following groups:
•	 Configurations with one or more zones for attaching the housings of 
standard switches (say, TO switches)
•	 Configurations that also serve as housings
•	 Configurations with great thermal inertia
•	 Flanged configurations
•	 Universal composite configurations
2.11.2  Radiators for liquid cooling
Forced air cooling is limited by the maximum possible air speed (15–
20 m/s) and the low heat-transfer efficiency. The only option at that 
point is to increase the radiator surface, but that means increasing its 
mass and size.
By switching to liquid cooling, the heat-transfer coefficient may be 
increased to 0.1–0.7 W/cm2 °C.
Figure 2.60 shows some practical radiators with liquid cooling.
The use of water has two series drawbacks: its relatively high freezing 
point and its low electrical strength. This prevents the use of water cool-
ing at negative temperatures and in high-voltage equipment.

Power electronics basics
At high heat flux density (around 20 W/cm2), liquid cooling becomes 
ineffective; it is reduced to evaporative cooling.
Figure 2.61 shows possible configurations of radiators for liquid cool-
ing. The best option is to use vertical cooling pipes with upward liquid 
flow. Another acceptable approach is a horizontal configuration with the 
cooling pipes in the same plane (Arendt et al., 2011). The use of horizontal 
pipes at different heights proves unsuccessful, as there is a risk that air 
bubbles will form in the upper channel.
2.12  Promising developments in power electronics
2.12.1  Power switches based on SiC
Semiconductor power switches based on SiC have the following main 
benefits (Lebedev and Sbruev, 2006):
•	 Because the band gap is larger for silicon (Si) and GaAs, the working 
temperature range is considerably greater (in theory, up to ~1000°C).
•	 As the critical field strength in SiC is almost an order of magnitude 
greater than that in silicon, the doping of a structure with fixed 
breakdown voltage may be increased by two orders of magnitude,

with a consequent decrease in the resistance and an increase in the 
unit power.
•	 The high critical field strength in SiC affords considerable radiation 
stability.
•	 Cooling is simplified on account of the high thermal conductivity of the 
material. (The value for polycrystalline SiC matches that for copper.)
•	 Faster charge-carrier saturation permits greater saturation currents 
in field transistors based on SiC.
•	 Because of the high Debye temperature, which determines the tem-
perature at which elastic lattice vibrations appear, the thermal stabil-
ity of SiC semiconductors is improved.
•	 SiC is versatile. Because SiC components contain a large substrate 
made of the same material as the semiconductor structure, while sili-
con dioxide (SiO2) is also present, and both n- and p-type conductiv-
ity may be created in SiC, any type of semiconductor power device 
may be created.
The industrial production of semiconductor power devices based on 
SiC depends on the availability of high-quality substrates. Today, SiC sub-
strates are in great demand. With each year, their quality improves, and 
their diameter increases. Today, diameters of about 100 mm are possible.
The mass production of power transistors based on SiC still lies in the 
future. The current stage may be appraised on the basis of the following data.
In 2002, specialists at Kansai Electric Power (Japan) reported the devel-
opment of a 5.3 kV junction field-effect transistor (JFET) (drain current 3.3 A).
Research by SiCLAB (Rutgers University) and United Silicon Carbide 
has led to developments such as the following:
•	 The vertical junction field effect transistor, with a maximum permis-
sible drain voltage of 1200 V and a drain current of 10 A; resistivity 
in the on state not more than 4 mΩ cm2
•	 A metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) with 
a maximum permissible drain voltage of 2400 V and drain current of 
5 A; resistivity in the on state 13.5 mΩ cm2
•	 A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with a maximum permissible col-
lector voltage of 1800 V and a collector current of 10 A; resistivity in 
the on state 4.7 mΩ cm2
Semiconductor power devices developed by Cree (USA) include the 
following:
•	 A thyristor with a breakdown voltage of 5200 V, a forward current of 
300 A, and a leakage current less than 100 μA
•	 Prototype Schottky diodes with a 5.6 × 5.6 mm working region at 
1200 V/50 A and 600 V/100 A

82
Power electronics basics
•	 An SiC MOSFET (working area 3.8 × 3.8 mm), with a drain voltage 
of 1200 V and a drain current of 10 A and with RDS(ON) = 0.1 Ω at 
150°C
•	 A 3 × 3 mm BJT, with a collector–emitter voltage of 1700 V, a satura-
tion voltage of 1 V, and a collector current of 20 A
•	 A 4H-SiC p–i–n diode with a pulsed power of ~3 MW (mean current 
20 A, maximum pulsed current more than 300 A, leakage current 
300 μA), reverse voltage more than 9 kV, and 8.5 × 8.5 mm working 
region. The parameters of the p–i–n diode in the housing are 10 kV 
and 20 A
The benefits of semiconductor power devices based on SiC are clearly 
demonstrated by a recent joint project of Cree and Kansai Electric Power. 
A three-phase voltage inverter based entirely on SiC switches has been 
developed and successfully tested. This inverter (output power 110 kV A) 
fits in the space required for an inverter based on silicon technology with 
an output power of only 12 kV A.
2.12.2  Highly integrated power modules
To increase the reliability and thermocyclic strength of power switches 
and to also expand their operational temperature range, we may use fun-
damentally new technologies such as the following.
•	 Replacement of soldered joints with low-temperature sintering
•	 Replacement of conductor joints with reliable welded contacts
•	 The use of spring systems
•	 Greater integration, especially for high-power components
The new technologies permit the creation of new classes of power 
modules. Along with the use of promising new semiconductor materials, 
the development of highly integrated power modules is of great interest 
in high-temperature electronics (Arendt et al., 2011).
Recently, a construction of a three-phase electric drive (effective cur-
rent 36  A and voltage 48 V) without standard power modules (Moser 
et al., 2006) is developed.
This drive is based on a housing-free design and is produced in 10 
operations, using a minimum of materials. The creation of housing-free 
power circuits permits the development of electronic systems with a very 
high-power density and excellent mechanical characteristics. The lack 
of soldered joints ensures high thermocyclic strength, and the limiting 
temperature of semiconductor power chips may reach 200°C. Due to the 
compact design and integrated dc element, there is little electromagnetic 
radiation.

2.13  Control of semiconductor power switches
The control-pulse generator is the part of the converter’s control system 
that forms a logical sequence of control pulses for power switches and 
then amplifies the pulses to the required power.
The main sources of noise in the control system are the convert-
er’s power component and, to some extent, the amplifier module of the 
­control-pulse generator. The switching of large load currents creates pow-
erful pulsed interference that penetrates into the electrical circuit of the 
control-pulse generator and may disrupt the operation of the information 
and logical components of the control system. Therefore, one of the main 
requirements in developing the power circuit is electrical uncoupling 
between the power and control components of the converter.
Such uncoupling is also necessary in relation to the control of higher-
level power switches that are not directly connected to the system’s com-
mon bus.
In terms of the approach to uncoupling, we may distinguish between 
the following types of control-pulse generators (Voronin, 2005):
•	 Transformer-based control-pulse generators with combined trans-
mission of the electrical and informational components of the con-
trol signal.
•	 Control-pulse generators with uncoupling of the control signal’s 
informational component and subsequent amplification of that sig-
nal to the required power.
In turn, the first group may be divided into control-pulse generators 
using a voltage transformer and those using a current transformer.
For control-pulse generators with separate transmission of the energy 
and information, the uncoupling in the information channel may be based 
on a high-frequency transformer or on optrons.
As a rule, control-pulse generators with combined energy and infor-
mation transmission are used for current-controlled (charge-controlled) 
power switches such as power bipolar transistors and thyristors. The 
main benefits of such control-pulse generators are the lack of auxiliary 
energy sources for amplification of the control pulses and the high insula-
tion voltage (as much as 6.5 kV).
However, the use of transformer-based control-pulse generators is 
associated with certain problems.
•	 With an increase in the switching frequency, the amplitude of the con-
trol signals begins to depend on the quality of the transmitted pulses.
•	 The minimum and maximum lengths of the control signals are lim-
ited by the characteristics of the transformer’s magnetic core.

84
Power electronics basics
In power circuits based on high-inductance thyristors, packet trans-
mission of antiphase pulses is used in the load circuit. This permits 
the production of relatively long (a few milliseconds) control signals 
(Figure 2.62).
Control-pulse generators with separate transmission of the energy 
and information contain three basic components.
•	 A circuit for uncoupling of the information channel
•	 An amplification circuit for the control pulses
•	 A power-supply circuit for the amplifier
In addition, such control-pulse generators may contain a circuit pro-
tecting the power switch from current and voltage surges and a circuit 
controlling the voltage in the amplifier’s power source.
In control-pulse generators with separate transmission of the energy 
and information, uncoupling may be based on optrons or a pulsed 
transformer.
Deficiencies of optronic uncoupling include temperature instability 
of the parameters, a low current transfer factor (for a diode optron), and 
a large delay in control-signal transmission (for a transistor optron). The 
insulation in systems with optronic uncoupling cannot withstand volt-
ages greater than 2.5 kV.
However, in contrast to transformer-based uncoupling, the optronic 
systems permit the transmission of a continuous control signal.
With broad temperature fluctuation, optrons are replaced by pulsed 
transformers, characterized by more stable parameters and stronger insu-
lation. Packet transmission of high-frequency signals is used to eliminate 
the dependence of the information signal on the length (Figure 2.63).

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
When they are produced in the form of separate integrated circuits, 
control-pulse generators with separate transmission of the energy and 
information are known as drivers. Industrial drivers are mainly produced 
for power switches, controlled by an insulated gate (MOS transistors or 
IGBT). There are drivers for the control of a single switch or a half-bridge 
or bridge assembly of switches.
As a rule, unipolar power supply (+10 or +15 V) is used for the drivers 
in MOS transistors. For more powerful IGBT switches, bipolar supply is 
used (+15 and –10 or ±15 V). This improves the switching speed and the 
protection against pulsed interference.
In standard drivers, the pulsed currents used are 6, 12, 15, 35, 50, and 
65 A. With an increase in the switching frequency, the mean driver cur-
rent rises significantly. The minimum necessary mean current is chosen 
in accordance with the power and input capacitance of the switch.
Calculation of the required average driver current Ia is based on the 
dynamic characteristic of the switch’s gate circuit, which is the depen-
dence of the switch’s input voltage on the charge in the gate circuit 
(Figure 2.64).

2.14  Passive components
2.14.1  Introduction
By passive components in electrical circuits, we mean transformers, reac-
tors, capacitors, resistors, varistors, and other elements whose operation 
does not require additional power sources, internal or external. In power 
electronics, we speak of passive components in contrast to semiconductor 
devices, which directly control the power flux and are active components. 
At the same time, passive components form the fundamental framework 

87
Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
that permits power conversion. They are present in practically all power 
electronic devices, in which they perform functions such as the following:
•	 Transformers match the voltage levels and ensure the galvanic 
uncoupling of circuits.
•	 Reactors are the basic components of filters, switching circuits, and 
intermediate energy stores.
•	 Capacitors are used in ac and dc filters and also as intermediate 
energy stores.
In power electronic devices, passive components operate under the 
action of nonsinusoidal high-frequency currents and voltages. This sig-
nificantly complicates their choice in the development of power electronic 
devices. In addition, their choice is often critical to the success of the 
design. The great range of functions performed by passive components 
clearly indicates their importance in power electronics.
2.14.2  Electromagnetic components
2.14.2.1  Basic characteristics of ferromagnetic materials
The dependence of the magnetic induction B on the magnetic field strength 
H is different for different ferromagnetic materials. Options include the 
basic magnetization curve, a limiting static hysteresis loop, and a dynamic 
hysteresis loop. Less common dependences take account of the specific 
features of the magnetization or demagnetization process, for instance, 
the dynamic magnetization curve.
The basic magnetization curve is the locus of the vertices of particular 
steady hysteresis loops. For magnetically soft materials, which are pre-
dominantly used in transformers and reactors, this curve is practically 
identical to the initial magnetization curve obtained in the first magne-
tization of completely demagnetized material. Magnetization curves are 
described as follows:

and μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m is the magnetic constant (the permeability of vac-
uum). In addition, μr is the relative magnetic permeability, characterizing the 
increase in induction in the ferromagnet on account of its magnetization M.
The section where the magnetization curve rises modestly with an 
increase in the field strength H corresponds to saturation of the ferro-
magnet, which occurs at the saturation magnetization Ms and saturation

magnetic induction Bs (Figure 2.65). With further increase in the field 
strength, the variation in the induction is practically linear: dB/dH = μa.
Depending on the conditions in which the permeability is 
­determined—­in a steady or variable magnetic field—it is known as the 
static or dynamic magnetic permeability. The static and dynamic mag-
netic permeabilities differ in magnitude, on account of the influence of 
eddy currents, magnetic viscosity, and resonant phenomena on the mag-
netization processes in alternating fields.
The concept of dynamic magnetic permeability is directly related to the 
definition of the dynamic induction Ld, which relates the variation in flux 
linkage ΔΨ and current Δi in the circuit of the electromagnetic component

The magnetization curve is nonlinear, and therefore μa varies with 
change in H. The dependence of B on H in the case of small variations at a 
specific point of the magnetization curve may be characterized by means 
of the differential magnetic permeability μd:

Chapter two:  Semiconductor power switches and passive components
The properties of a ferromagnet may be more completely character-
ized using hysteresis loops. The limiting static hysteresis loop determines 
the dependence of B on H within sections of the complete magnetiza-
tion and demagnetization cycle with slow variation in the external field 
strength—in other words, effectively at constant current (dH/dt = 0). In 
Figure 2.66, we show the limiting static hysteresis loop. Its characteristics 
are as follows.
•	 The maximum values Bm and Hm, which exceed the values corre-
sponding to the saturation induction Bs
•	 The residual induction Br
•	 The coercive force Hc
The sections of the hysteresis loop from +Bm to −Hc and from −Bm to 
+Hc correspond to demagnetization, whereas the sections from −Hc to −Bm 
and from +Hc to +Bm correspond to magnetization. With a decrease in the 
magnetic field strength to zero, the ferromagnet will have residual induc-
tion +Br or −Br, depending on the polarity of the initial Bm values.

The area of the hysteresis loop determines the energy losses in the 
ferromagnet on remagnetization (the hysteresis losses).
The electromagnetic components in power electronic devices usu-
ally operate under the action of high-frequency alternating voltages and 
currents. Therefore, they are described by dynamic hysteresis loops,

Power electronics basics
which relate B and H when dH/dt ≫ 0. With an increase in the frequency, 
dynamic hysteresis loops differ considerably from static hysteresis loops. 
The area of the dynamic hysteresis loop increases with an increase in 
the magnetization frequency, that is, the energy losses in the ferromag-
net increase. In addition, the steep sections of the dynamic hysteresis 
loop become more shallow (Figure 2.67). These physical processes may 
be attributed to magnetic viscosity, that is, delay in the orientation of the 
domains as a function of the magnetic field strength. In addition, high-
frequency electromagnetic fields produce eddy currents in the ferromag-
net, which hinder remagnetization. The losses due to eddy currents and 
magnetic viscosity are said to be dynamic. Besides the properties of the 
ferromagnet, other significant factors affect the form of the dynamic hys-
teresis loop. For example, the dynamic hysteresis loops recorded with 
remagnetization by means of a current source will differ markedly from 
those recorded for the same material by means of a voltage source. Other 
relevant factors include the form of the currents and voltages present and 
the design of the magnetic system.
At low frequencies (between 50 Hz and 5 kHz), various magnetically 
soft metals are employed, such as electrical-engineering steels with added 
silicon (with low coercive force Hc < 4 A/m) or alloys of iron with nickel 
(permalloy). These alloys are characterized by high relative magnetic per-
meability and low coercive force. Therefore, the losses on remagnetization 
are small, which is especially important in high-frequency systems.
Above 5 kHz, semiconducting ferrites or magnetic dielectrics are 
employed. Ferrites are made from powder compounds of iron oxides with

zinc, manganese, and other metals, by a ceramic technology. Ferrites are 
categorized as semiconductors. Therefore, their bulk electrical resistivity 
is many orders of magnitude greater than that of steel and alloys. This 
high resistance significantly reduces the eddy currents and associated 
energy losses. On account of their low energy losses due to eddy cur-
rents and the ability to produce magnetic cores of different shapes, fer-
rite magnetic systems are widely used in power electronics. At ­present, 
­manganese–zinc (MnZn) ferrite is widely used in magnets with high sat-
uration induction and magnetic permeability and low energy losses in the 
range from 300 kHz to 1 MHz. Above 1 MHz, nickel–zinc (NiZn) ferrites 
are recommended. However, their use is limited by their temperature sen-
sitivity and saturation characteristics (Melyoshin, 2005).
In developing magnetic systems for reactors, in which low inductance 
is often required at high current, the characteristics employed are dif-
ferent than those for the magnetic systems for transformers. In addition, 
when using a reactor as a filter in dc circuits, its magnetic system is subject 
to bias magnetization. In that case, constant inductance must be main-
tained with wide variation in the current.
Traditionally, this problem is solved by the manufacture of magnetic 
systems with one or more air gaps. This reduces the reactor’s inductance 
and also reduces its dependence on the current in the winding. However, 
this method has a number of deficiencies. In particular, magnetic scatter-
ing fluxes appear close to the gaps, and the electromagnetic compatibility 
is generally impaired.
At present, magnetic dielectrics with low (required) magnetic perme-
ability are under development. They are based on composites of powder 
structure, in which magnetic materials are combined with dielectrics by 
means of special binders. The resulting material is characterized by low 
magnetic permeability because the air gap is effectively distributed over 
the whole length of the magnetic system. The high resistivity of mag-
netic dielectrics practically eliminates eddy currents. One such material 
is Alsifer, an alloy of aluminum, silicon, and iron. Low μr values (up to 
about a hundred) permit its effective use in the manufacture of magnetic 
systems for filter reactors, with practically linear dependence of the induc-
tion over a wide range of magnetic field strengths.
Other new magnetic materials of note are amorphous magnetically 
soft alloys, which lack crystalline structure. Such alloys are based on iron, 
boron, and silicon, with the addition of various components, such as chro-
mium, to improve their properties. Amorphous alloys have good mag-
netic, mechanical, and anticorrosion properties. In particular, they ensure 
low energy losses. In the mass production of electromagnetic components, 
this permits considerable economic savings in terms of the consumption 
of metal and energy.

2.14.2.2  Influence of high frequencies and nonsinusoidal voltage 
on the operation of transformers and reactors
Losses in the magnetic system. Various physical processes are responsible for 
the losses in the magnetic system, which may be determined, in the gen-
eral case, as the sum of the losses due to factors such as hysteresis, eddy 
currents, and magnetic viscosity. Precise calculation of individual compo-
nents is often more complex than the calculation of the total losses on the 
basis of experimental data obtained with a sinusoidal field. For example, 
the following formula was presented for the specific losses Psp (W/cm3) in 
a magnetic system (Rozanov et al., 2007):

where f is the working frequency, f* the baseline frequency (1000 Hz), Bm 
the maximum induction, Bm
*  the baseline induction (1 T), and A0, α, and β 
the empirical constants.
For the materials used in magnetic systems, α > 1, and according to 
Equation 2.76, the losses in the system increase with increasing working 
frequency. In steel magnetic systems, eddy-current losses predominate at 
high frequencies; in ferrite systems, hysteresis losses dominate. This dif-
ference may be taken into account by assigning different values to the 
constants. In particular, the following simple formula may be used for the 
losses:

(2.77)
where the empirical constant A takes account of factors such as the types 
of losses in different materials (Rozanov et al., 2007).
Under the action of nonsinusoidal periodic voltages, the losses in the 
magnetic systems are greater than those for sinusoidal voltage at the same 
fundamental frequency. This is due to the presence of high-frequency 
components in the nonsinusoidal voltage.
The influence of higher harmonics on the losses in the magnetic sys-
tem may be taken into account by summing the losses for each harmonic

If the voltage at the transformer contains a constant component, bias 
magnetization will occur, with shift in the working induction in the mag-
netic system. As an example, consider the processes in the magnetic core 
of a pulsed transformer with a unipolar voltage. Suppose that the period 
of the voltage is greater than the duration of the transient processes in the 
transformer, and its scattering inductance and the active resistance of the 
windings are zero. In Figure 2.68a, the voltage generator is shown as an 
ideal dc voltage source E, which is periodically connected to the primary 
winding of transformer T by switch S. When switch S is on, voltage E 
is applied to the primary winding (with N1 turns). This is equivalent to 
the action of a voltage pulse with amplitude E and length tp. The induc-
tion in the transformer’s magnetic core begins to vary. Under the given 
assumptions, we show the simplified equivalent circuit of the transformer 
in Figure 2.68b; the transformer is replaced by a nonlinear impedance 
zμ with magnetization current iμ and the load by the resistance reduced 
to the primary winding ʹ =

time diagrams of the voltage u2′ at the secondary winding, reduced to the 
primary winding and for the induction in the magnetic system in a tran-
sient process when the core is completely demagnetized initially. Under 
the action of voltage E, the mean value of the induction at time t = tp is

where Sm is the cross-section of the magnetic core. In Figure 2.68c, the 
variation in the induction under the action of the first voltage pulse cor-
responds to motion over the initial magnetization curve from point O to 
point A1.
When switch S is turned off, demagnetization of the magnetic system 
begins. Under the given assumptions, the demagnetization current will 
fall in the circuit formed by impedance zμ and load R .
lo  Assuming that the 
switch is off for a time that permits the current iμ to fall to zero, we may 
say that the induction B varies over the demagnetization cycle from point 
A1 to point O1 before the switch is again turned on. Then, when switch 
S is turned on, the magnetization process begins again, but from point 
O1. At constant E and tp, in accordance with Equation 2.79, ΔBme will also 
remain constant. As a result of periodic pulsed stimulation, the initial and 
final values of the induction will be displaced to point Ok, corresponding 
to point Ak in Figure 2.68c. Further pulses will result in remagnetization 
of the magnetic system over the cycle from point Ok to point Ak and back.

the right of the vertical axis (Figure 2.68c). With an increase in the bias 
currents, the cycle is shifted to a section of the magnetization curve 
that is less steep—the saturation zone, where the magnetic perme-
ability is lower in dynamic operation. Accordingly, with an increase 
in the bias magnetization, the dynamic inductance declines. Note that 
the bias magnetization depends significantly on the operation of the 
circuit containing the transformer or reactor—in particular, the inter-
nal impedance of the pulsed voltage source connected to the primary 
transformer winding.
Losses in windings. High-frequency voltages and currents, including 
nonsinusoidal voltages and currents, produce additional energy losses 
not only in the magnetic systems, but also in the windings of transform-
ers and reactors. These losses are mainly due to the skin effect in conduc-
tors, in which the current is displaced to the surface under the action of 
the electromagnetic fields. As a result, the active impedance in alternating 
current is greater than the resistance R0 in direct current. This increase in 
impedance is due to the decrease in effective cross-section of the wire. In 
the skin effect, the current is displaced radially. Current displacement also 
occurs under the action of the electromagnetic fields produced by adjacent 
conductors. In that case, the redistribution of the current depends on the 
design of the windings and their configuration in the magnetic system. 
The additional losses in the winding with alternating current are taken 
into account by means of the coefficient Kadd:

(2.81)
The value of Kadd must be calculated for each specific transformer 
design, with allowance for the current or voltage frequency.
With nonsinusoidal voltages and currents, the additional losses due 
to each harmonic are determined on the basis of Fourier expansion. These 
losses may be taken into account by the equivalent value of Kadd:

where Kaddn takes account of the losses at the frequency of the nth har-
monic and I and In are the effective values of the total current and its 
harmonics, respectively.
It is difficult to determine Kaddn as it depends on many factors—­notably, 
the cross-sectional area, the design of the windings, and their configura-
tion in the magnetic system. For example, the skin effect is characterized 

96
Power electronics basics
by the coefficient δ, which determines the penetration depth of the cur-
rent in the conductor, that is, the distance over which the current density 
declines by a factor of e from its maximum value at the surface (sometimes 
known as the depth of the skin effect).
The coefficient δ is highly frequency-dependent. For copper at 100°C, 
δ = 8.9 mm at 50 Hz, 0.89 mm at 5 kHz, and 0.089 mm at 500 kHz. With an 
increase in the working frequency, an increase in the winding’s rated cur-
rent requires special measures to limit the skin effect. The most common 
approach is to use special multicore conductors (litz wires). Litz wire con-
sists of a large number of small-diameter conductors, which are insulated 
from one another. The conductors of each pair are wound together, so as 
to prevent the formation of the magnetic flux produced by the currents of 
short-circuited pairs. Then all the pairs are combined so that the winding 
produced has two external terminals.
Another method of reducing the skin effect in conductors that carry 
large currents is to use a thin copper strip with an insulated surface.
If the wire diameter d ≪ δ, the skin effect will be slight. However, in 
transformers and reactors operating at high frequencies, the mutual influ-
ence of the conductors will change the current density in the turns of the 
winding, with a consequent increase in the power losses. In that case, the 
calculation of the actual losses is a complex field problem.
A simple qualitative approach here is to consider a two-dimensional 
problem and to take account of the symmetry of the winding configura-
tion in the magnetic system (Rozanov et al., 2007).
In Figure 2.69, we show the distribution of the magnetomotive force 
in the layers of single-section reactor windings. With an increase in the 
magnetomotive force, the magnetic field strength increases. There is also a 
quadratic increase in the additional losses within the winding layers. The 
losses are greatest in the surface layer, in which the magnetic field strength 
is a maximum. To reduce these losses in high-frequency transformers, the 
windings are divided into sections; this reduces the magnetic field strength 
in the outermost layers of the winding (Rozanov et al., 2007). In Figure 
2.69b, we show an example in which the secondary winding is divided into 
two sections and the primary winding into three sections. This reduces the 
magnetic magnetomotive force and magnetic field strength by a factor of 4.
An increase in the frequency boosts the influence of parasitic param-
eters in the transformers and reactors, for example, the scattering induc-
tances and the interturn and interwinding capacitances. In Figure 2.70, 
we show the equivalent circuit of a transformer with the scattering induc-
tances of the primary LS1 and secondary LS2 windings, the capacitance C12 
between the windings, and the input and output capacitances (C1 and C2). 
Obviously, an increase in frequency of the input voltage will be accom-
panied by significant distortion of the output voltage, depending on the 
circuit parameters. This, in turn, will impair the operation of the power

electronic device and its energy characteristics, including the efficiency 
and energy density. In some cases, the parasitic parameters may be put to 
good use. For example, the scattering inductance at high frequencies may 
serve as a current limiter in the event of short circuits in the load circuit.
With an increase in the working frequency, it is difficult to ensure elec-
tromagnetic compatibility of transformers and reactors with other circuit 
elements. Moreover, the design of electronic devices is complicated, espe-
cially for reactors. In power electronic devices, reactors perform various 
functions such as filtration, energy storage, the formation of switching cur-
rents for thyristors, and reactive-power compensation. Most such reactors

are characterized by small inductance values that do not vary greatly with 
broad variation in the magnetizing currents. In other words, the inductance 
must be practically constant. To that end, the magnetic system may be man-
ufactured from a material with low magnetic permeability over a broad 
range of magnetic field strengths, such as Alsifer. At very low inductance, 
air reactors without a core may be used. However, to reduce the electromag-
netic field produced by such reactors, the magnetic flux must be enclosed as 
much as possible within the reactor. A toroidal design with uniform distri-
bution of the turns over the reactor circumference is suitable.
New technologies have been appearing lately to improve the high-fre-
quency performance of transformers and reactors. The main trend is the 
use of flat windings printed on the magnetic system (Rozanov et al., 2007). 
This design offers numerous benefits: simple sectioning of the windings, 
decrease in parasitic capacitance, and minimization of other negative 
effects. In addition, they are highly compatible with hybrid and modular 
manufacture of power electronic devices.
2.14.3  Capacitors: Basic definitions and characteristics
A capacitor is able to store and deliver large quantities of electrical energy. 
The usual design consists of conducting elements (such as metal plates) 
separated by a dielectric. Under the action of an electric field, coupled elec-
tric charges (electrons, ions, and larger charged particles) move within the 
dielectric in accordance with the direction of the electrical field strength 
vector. This results in induced polarization of the dielectric, in which the 
centers of gravity of the positive and negative charges move in opposite 
directions.
In Figure 2.71, we show the simplified charge distribution in a 
plane capacitor connected to an external source of voltage U. The charge

appearing at the surface of the dielectric creates an electric field of strength 
Eσ, opposed to the external field E0 = U/d. This reduces the field within the 
dielectric. The overall capacitance may be expressed in the form

where S is the surface area of each plate, d is the distance between the 
plates, the constant ε0 = 8.857 × 10−12 F/m characterizes the dielectric 
properties of free space (vacuum), and εr is the relative permittivity of 
the dielectric (εr > 1), which characterizes the increase in the charge, the 
capacitance, and the stored energy in comparison with the case in which 
is there no dielectric (in vacuum).
Different dielectric materials are used, depending on the required 
characteristics of the capacitor, its intended application, its production, 
and other factors. We may distinguish nonpolar dielectrics (with electri-
cally neutral molecules) from polar and ionic dielectrics and ferroelectrics 
(Ermuratsky, 1982). Depending on the type of dielectric, εr may vary from 
one or two to 104–105.
In power circuits with constant and pulsating voltage, electrolytic 
capacitors are widely used. A common design consists of oxidized alu-
minum foil (the plate), dielectric, and unoxidized aluminum foil with a 
fibrous covering (the opposing plate). The capacitor has terminals for con-
nection to a voltage of appropriate polarity. The cathodic terminal (−) is 
connected to the aluminum frame, whereas the anodic terminal (+), in the 
form of an individual lobe, is isolated from the housing and connected to 
the oxidized plate.
The basic capacitor parameters are the capacitance, the tangent of the 
loss angle, the leakage current, and the resistance of the insulation. In addi-
tion, the permissible voltage in different conditions, the reactive power, or 
the permissible stored energy is noted, depending on the type of capacitor.
With sinusoidal voltage, the tangent of the loss angle is defined as the 
ratio of the active P and reactive Q power

where ω is the angular frequency of the applied voltage, Ce and Re the 
capacitance and resistance according to the equivalent circuit in Figure 
2.72a, and Ce′ and Re′ the capacitance and resistance according to the equiv-
alent circuit in Figure 2.72b.
Note that, in the general case, the parameters of the equivalent circuits 
in Figure 2.72 depend on the frequency. Hence, according to Equation 2.85, 
tan δ is also frequency-dependent. In addition, more complete equiva-
lent circuits include the inductance of the electrical terminals, their active 
impedance, and other parameters (Rozanov et al., 2007).
In selecting the type of capacitor, we need to take account of the 
operating conditions, the form and frequency of the currents and volt-
ages, the available space, the cooling conditions, the total working life, 
the reliability, and many other factors. The age of the capacitor must also 
be taken into account, as the characteristics may vary considerably over 
time. For example, the capacitance of some capacitors may vary by 30% 
over time. Likewise, over time, we see considerable variation in tan δ 
and the resistance of the capacitor’s insulation, which determines the 
leakage current.
In power electronics, capacitors operate in very diverse and specific 
conditions. In terms of operating conditions, it is expedient, in general, 
to distinguish between nonpolar ac capacitors and filter capacitors for dc 
circuits with little pulsation.
	
1.	For nonpolar ac capacitors, alternating and pulsed voltages of differ-
ent forms are present. The presence of a constant voltage component 
comparable with the amplitude of pulsation is possible. Such capaci-
tors do not have terminals of different polarity; in other words, the 
polarity of the voltage applied is not critical.
	
2.	Unipolar capacitors, such as electrolytic capacitors with oxide dielec-
tric, are commonly used as filters for dc circuits with little pulsation. 
In that case, the capacitance is high, as is the stored energy density 
per unit volume. For such capacitors, operation with alternating volt-
age at the plates is impermissible.

2.14.3.1  Influence of the form and frequency of the voltage on 
capacitor operation
The basic functions of ac capacitors in power electronic devices are as 
follows:
•	 Reactive-power compensation at the fundamental frequency of the 
ac voltage
•	 Energy storage for forced thyristor commutation
•	 Formation of the switching trajectory for electronic switches
•	 Filtration of the higher voltage and current harmonics in ac power 
circuits.
In reactive-power compensators and regulators, capacitors usually 
operate with high-frequency sinusoidal voltages. In that case, they con-
form to the conventional operating rules for power electronic systems. In 
some reactive-power compensators, periodic switching produces higher 
current harmonics. In that case, the higher current harmonics must be 
taken into account in capacitor design and selection.
In thyristor commutation, as a rule, switching capacitors operate with 
fast recharging from one polarity to the other. As a result, pulsed currents 
with relatively sharp pulse fronts act on the capacitors. The voltage will 
then be approximately trapezoidal. Capacitors used for the formation of the 
switching trajectory are usually less powerful than switching capacitors. 
However, they are generally able to operate at higher frequencies, corre-
sponding to the spectral composition of the switching voltages. In addi-
tion, their basic parameters must be relatively frequency-­independent. In 
particular, their design should minimize the inductance, which degrades 
the transient processes that occur when switches are turned off.
Capacitors in harmonic filters must also withstand nonsinusoidal cur-
rents, whose spectral composition must be taken into account in capacitor 
selection.
Nonsinusoidal currents and voltages result in greater power losses 
and also change many important capacitor parameters. We know that, 
with sinusoidal voltage, the losses in the capacitor are proportional to the 
tangent of the loss angle in the dielectric. In many calculations, constant 
tan δ is assumed, although it depends on the operating conditions and 
especially on the frequency of the applied voltage. The frequency depen-
dence of tan δ must be taken into account in selecting capacitors for use 
at nonsinusoidal voltages. The frequency dependence of tan δ stated in 
the technical specifications provides the basis for assessment of the addi-
tional power losses in the presence of high-frequency voltages. Typically, 
for nonpolar capacitors, there is little change in tan δ at 50–1000 Hz, but 
approximately 10-fold increase in the range 1000–10,000 Hz. Temperature 
variation has less influence on tan δ for such capacitors. Overall, precise 

102
Power electronics basics
assessment of the high-frequency losses in capacitors is a challenge even 
with sinusoidal voltage.
It is even more difficult to assess the losses in a capacitor with nonsi-
nusoidal currents and voltages. The most general approach, which is very 
approximate, is based on frequency analysis of the voltage or current. In 
such calculations, the power losses in the capacitor due to each harmonic 
of the applied voltage are summed

where n is the number of the voltage harmonic, ω the angular frequency 
of the first voltage harmonic, Un the effective voltage of the nth harmonic, 
and tan δn the tangent of the loss angle for the nth harmonic.
By harmonic analysis—for instance, on the basis of Fourier 
­transformation—­we may determine the most significant harmonics in the 
nonsinusoidal voltage and estimate the power losses from Equation 2.86. 
Analogous methods may be used with specified nonsinusoidal current.
With an increase in the active power losses, the permissible effective 
voltage at the capacitor must be reduced with an increase in the frequency. 
An increase in the effective values of the high-frequency currents creates 
the risk of failure of the contacts and other structural elements of the 
capacitor. That also entails reducing the permissible effective voltage at 
the capacitor with an increase in the frequency. In Figure 2.73, we show a 
typical dependence of the permissible effective value of a sinusoidal volt-
age at an ac capacitor (Ermuratsky, 1982).
Depending on the frequency and form of the voltage, different factors 
may be prioritized in selecting the required capacitor. For example, with 
a trapezoidal capacitor voltage at low frequencies and short fronts, the 
amplitude of the pulsed current is the critical factor. In contrast, with high 
frequencies of a sinusoidal voltage (above 1 kHz), the additional power

losses are critical. Another important consideration in capacitor selection 
is its short-term electrical strength, which is taken into account in setting 
standards for the rated voltage. The permissible effective voltage at the 
capacitor may also be selected so as to limit the power of the discharge, by 
restricting the maximum temperature with constant losses.
As the reactive power of an ac capacitor depends directly on the fre-
quency, its unit parameters (the ratio of the reactive power to the volume, 
mass, or other parameters) will also depend on the frequency. In Figure 
2.74, we show the frequency dependence of the unit reactive power for 
some Russian ac capacitors. It is evident that, for each specific capacitor, 
there is an optimal frequency of the applied voltage, such that its volume 
is a minimum.
Electrolytic capacitors are the main components of dc filters. In opera-
tion, they are constantly subject to both dc and ac voltage components. 
Usually, the basic parameters that appear in the technical specifications for 
electrolytic capacitors include not only the capacitance, but also the rated 
constant component and the permissible variable component in a sinusoi-
dal voltage of frequency f = 50 Hz. However, at higher frequencies, other 
factors that reduce the conductivity of the capacitor and hence also its filter-
ing capacity must be taken into account (Rozanov et al., 2007). Thus, with 
sinusoidal voltage, the filtering capacity is determined by the total imped-
ance ZC of the capacitor. The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown 
in Figure 2.75a, in which Cd is the capacitance due to the dielectric, rd and 
re are the active impedances corresponding to the losses in the dielectric 
and the electrolyte, respectively, and Le is the equivalent inductance of the 
sections and terminals. According to the equivalent circuit, at frequency f,

In the calculations, we must take account of the influence of various 
factors on the equivalent circuit’s parameters. The capacitance Cd depends 
on the type of capacitor, its parameters, and the frequency. The inductance 
Le is a stable quantity. The tangent of the loss angle and other parameters 
depend on the frequency, time, and temperature. In addition, the param-
eters exhibit technological spreads, which are usually random. To take 
the influence of these factors into account, we assess and compare the unit 
parameters of the capacitors at high frequencies on the basis of their effec-
tive capacitance

ambient temperature of 25°C. The dashed line shows the frequency char-
acteristic of an ideal capacitor (Le = re = 0).
We see that the filtering capacity of the K50-20 capacitor begins to 
decline above 10 kHz. Above 20 kHz, its use is inexpedient. Instead, 
capacitors with an organic or ceramic dielectric must be employed.
If the variable component of the current passing through the capacitor 
is nonsinusoidal, the effectiveness of filtration again changes. For exam-
ple, at large di/dt, the alternating voltage at the capacitor terminals due to 
the inductance Le increases and may considerably exceed the alternating 
voltage at Cd.

With nonsinusoidal voltage pulsations at the capacitors, their filtering 
capacity and sustainable load will depend on the spectral composition of 
the pulsations. Therefore, for some types of oxide–electrolyte capacitors, 
the technical specifications mandate not only the frequency dependences 
already described, but also nomograms from which the permissible ampli-
tude of a specific nonsinusoidal voltage—say, a trapezoidal voltage—may 
be determined as a function of the frequency.
For preliminary estimates at the design stage, it is sufficient to con-
fine attention to the dominant harmonics in the voltage pulsations at the 
capacitor and to employ the superposition principle. The results must be 
refined experimentally. In particular, the effective currents should be mea-
sured (using thermoammeters), as well as the temperature of the capacitor 
housing and the ambient temperature.
Capacitors are fundamental to power electronics. Therefore, major 
electrical-engineering firms expend great resources in improving their 
performance. Table 2.3 presents the unit parameters of some capacitors, to 
illustrate the state of the art (Rozanov et al., 2007).

Control of power electronic 
devices
3.1  ​Mathematical models
3.1.1  ​One-dimensional and multidimensional models
In the general case, any power electronic device may be regarded as a 
control plant (Figure 3.1). One characteristic of such components is that 
they have two inputs.
	
1.	A power input, to which supply voltages ek (k = 1,…,K) are supplied. 
These voltages must be converted into output voltage or current sig-
nals in accordance with the particular control problem. For the sake 
of simplicity, they may be expressed in the form of the supply volt-
age vector ( )

tion; in reality, this vector is a column one.
	
2.	A control input, to which independent controls um (m = 1,…,M) 
are supplied. They control the transformation of the supply 
voltages ek. They may also be represented as a control vector

Another characteristic is that independent external disturbances

as an external perturbation vector ( )

If the number of independent control signals is greater than 1 and so is 
the number of output variables, the control plant is said to be multidimen-
sional: it is a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) one. Another important 
class consists of one-dimensional or scalar control plants: ­single-input, 
single-output (SISO) ones. Numerous special methods for the analysis 
and control design have been devoted to this class. They will be consid-
ered below.

Power electronics basics
3.1.2  Linear and nonlinear systems—Linearization
From the viewpoint of mathematical description, a fundamental feature 
of power electronic devices is the presence of power electronic switches, 
which switch the electrical circuits in the devices in response to control. 
The controls are generated by the controller or under the action of the 
electromagnetic processes in the components.
A power electronic switch is a completely controllable semiconduc-
tor device. It has a control electrode to which a signal is sent for transi-
tion from the conducting to the nonconducting state or vice versa (Mohan 
et al., 2003; Rozanov et al., 2007). Examples include the following:
•	 The bipolar plane transistor
•	 The field-effect MOS transistor
•	 The insulated gate bipolar transistor
•	 The gate turn-off thyristor
In terms of the control of power electronic devices, these completely 
controllable semiconductor modules may be regarded, without loss of 
generality, as noninertial switches, with zero resistance in the conduct-
ing state and infinite resistance in the closed state, which are capable of 
infinitely large switching frequencies. Their idealized relay characteristic 
is shown in Figure 3.2.
Therefore, in terms of mathematical description, a power electronic 
device is a nonlinear control plant with a variable or switchable structure 
(Figure 3.3).
For each specific power electronic device, the properties of the indi-
vidual structures are determined by the states of the power switches.

Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
Thus, analysis of the device’s operation and design of the correspond-
ing controls call for a mathematical model that reflects its most important 
properties. This model must be based on the laws of electrical engineering 
and must take into account the specific topology of the power electronic 
device. The complexity of the model is determined by the set of properties 
that must be taken into account.
In the first stage, only the basic properties of the components in the 
power electronic device are taken into account. In other words, the active 
and reactive components are assumed to be ideal. In that case, the descrip-
tion of the processes in the power electronic device is based on the follow-
ing physical laws:

of particular importance in electrical engineering on account of their 
universality: they may be applied to many circuit theory problems.
	
4.1	 Kirchhoff’s first law (the current law). The algebraic sum of the cur-
rents at any node of any circuit is zero. A node is defined here as 
the point at which three or more conductors meet. (The incoming 
and outgoing currents are assigned opposite signs.)

the loop, the total voltage drop is zero. A loop is defined here as 
a closed secondary circuit. Each conductor may be a component 
of several loops

5.	Switching laws, which determine the relation between the currents 
and voltages in the electrical circuit before and after switching.
	
5.1	 The first switching law (the absence of a current discontinuity in an 
inductance): the current iL(+0) passing through the inductance L 
immediately after switching is equal to the current iL(−0) passing 
through the inductance L immediately before switching, as the 
self-induction law rules out instantaneous change of the current 
in the inductance
	
iL(+0) = iL(−0).	
(3.6)
	
5.2.	The second switching law (the absence of a voltage discontinuity at a 
capacitance): the voltage uC(+0) at capacitance C immediately 
after switching is equal to the voltage uC(−0) immediately before 
switching, as a voltage jump at the capacitance is impossible
	
uC(+0) = uC(−0).	
(3.7)
	
6.	Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, which is fundamental to 
electrodynamics (describing the operation of transformers, chokes, 
and assorted electrical motors and generators). For any closed induc-
tion loop, the emf e is equal to the rate of change in the magnetic flux 
Ψ passing through this loop
	
d

= −.
	
(3.8)
	
7.	The mutual inductance law, which determines the relation between 
the current i1 in inductance L and the magnetic flux Ψ21 passing 
through a second inductance that is created by i1:
	
Ψ21
21 1
= M i , 	
(3.9)
	
	 where M21 is the mutual inductance.
Linearization is widely employed to obtain a linear description of 
control plants. In this approach, the actual continuous nonlinear equation 
y = φ(x) that describes an element of the system is replaced by a similar 
linear equation. The following linearization methods are employed.

	 In Equation 3.10, (x0,y0) are the coordinates of the point selected for 
expansion, where y = φ(x), Δx = x − x0 is a small deviation from the 
point of expansion, x is the current value of the variable, and the 
derivatives of the function y = φ(x) are calculated for the point of 
expansion.
	
	   Thus, the nonlinear equation y = φ(x) may be replaced by a linear 
equation in the vicinity of the point of expansion, that is, by the lin-
earized equation

	   The latter is the equation in terms of deviations.
	
	   For a continuous dependence of the output variable on several 
variables, the Taylor expansion is written in terms of partial deriva-
tives with respect to different variables at the point of expansion. In 
other words, the nonlinear function y = φ(x1,x2,…,xn) may be replaced 
at the point of expansion by the linear function

2.	Statistical linearization for nonanalytic equations (e.g., on the basis 
of statistical data) is based on the least-squares method.
By using these methods, the linear approximation of statistical data is 
a line that has a minimum of the sum of squares of the error for all values 
of the variable xi, for which values of the nonlinear function φ(xi) exist 
(here i = 1, … I, where I is the number of measurements)

The problem is solved by using the LINEST function in Excel soft-

F statistic, the degrees of freedom, the regression sum, and the residual 
sum, which permit assessment of reliability and quality of the model.
Using Equation 3.14, we may assess the relative error resulting from 
the replacement of the nonlinear characteristic by a linear characteristic 
for each measurement

3.1.3  ​Differential and matrix equations—Switching function
As already noted, in terms of mathematical description, a power electronic 
device must be regarded as a nonlinear control plant with a variable or 
switchable structure. Each structure defined by a particular combination 
of switch states is linear, on account of the electrical engineering laws 
employed.
In linear description, each variable and its derivatives appear in an 
equation offering first-order description of the properties of the device’s 
structure. The variables employed usually include the circuit currents 
and voltages. The processes in the circuit are described by linear integro-­
differential equations.
If one variable is enough to describe the electrical processes, such con-
trol plants are said to be one-dimensional and are described by an nth-
order nonhomogeneous linear differential equation (where n is the largest 
derivative employed)

The space in which the one-dimensional system is described is known as 
the derivative space.
In such systems, the state variable is usually the output variable: y = x.
If the behavior of the structure is described by means of several state vari-
ables, the system is said to be multidimensional. Its dimensionality is deter-
mined by the number of independent variables required. Such structures are 
usually described by vector-matrix equations (Kwakernaak and Sivan, 1972)

, and Ai, Bi, C, and Di are matrices 
characterizing the features of the structure of the control plant. In general, 
the number of independent variables may be different from the number 
of output variables. In other words, the matrix C may be rectangular. We 
call Equation 3.18 the equation of state and Equation 3.20 the output vari-
able equation.
To obtain the mathematical model for the power electronic device 
as a whole, rather than for each individual structure, we use switch-
ing functions. In that approach, the power switch (or a combination of 
switches) is described by a threshold or step function or by a sign func-
tion (Figure 3.4).
The argument α of the switching function, which determines the con-
ditions in which the switch is turned on and off, may be a function of the 
time. In that case, the threshold function is

Note that the topology of the power electronic device will deter-
mine whether the switch state 0 or –1 will be used. In physical terms, the 
threshold switching function corresponds to unipolar switching of a dc 
supply voltage, when the power supply is connected or not. In bipolar 
switching, when different polarities of the supply voltage are connected, 
we use the sign switching function (e.g., relay control). The following 
algebraic relation between these two types of switching functions may 
be established:

supply voltage depends on the switching function and the left-hand side of 
Equation 3.27 is linear with coefficients that are constant and have constant 
signs, this is a relay system. The same remark applies to Equation 3.19, but 
the number of combinations of switch states is greater. The number of switch 
combinations is 2g, where g is the number of switches. In that case

Besides equations in terms of absolute variables, two other options 
are possible: equations in terms of deviations and equations in terms of 
relative variables.
3.1.3.1  ​Equations in terms of deviations
As already noted, nonlinear equations may be linearized by considering 
the behavior of the system in the vicinity of some point. This significantly 
simplifies the analysis.
Usually, the points chosen in linearization are static states of the sys-
tem in which all the derivatives are zero. Alternatively, a specified value 
of the output variable may be adopted. This is the most common choice in 
systems with switchable structure, in which, by definition, self-oscillation 
is a concern.
In the case of a one-dimensional system, if the point chosen is a speci-
fied value of x, denoted by xz, then we may write the initial equation for 
each structure, Equation 3.16, in terms of the deviation or discrepancy Δx 
(Δx = xz − x):

3.1.3.2  Per-unit equations
In terms of relative variables (the per-unit system), the values of variables 
such as voltage, current, resistance, or power are expressed with respect to 
a specific baseline value (adopted as the unit). The conversion formula is
	
X
X
Xr
pu =
,
	
(3.31)
where X is the value of the physical quantity (parameter, variable, etc.) in 
the initial system of units (usually the SI system) and Xr is the base (base-
line value) in the same system of units, adopted as the unit of measure-
ment in the relative variable.
In the per-unit system, the baseline values usually adopted are the 
power, voltage, current, impedance, and admittance (complex conductiv-
ity); only two of these are independent. Thus, we may employ different 
per-unit systems, depending on the problem to be solved and on personal 
preference. The rated values are generally adopted as baseline values. It is 
conventional to use the same symbol pu (or sometimes p.u.) and to deter-
mine whether the voltage, current, or other parameters are intended on 
the basis of the context.
The calculation results may be converted back to dimensional values 
(volts, amperes, ohms, watts, etc.) by inverse use of Equation 3.31.
For example, in some SimulinkBlocksets/SimPowerSystems mod-
ules, the parameters are specified in per-unit form. The main electri-
cal baseline values selected in the SimPowerSystem software are Pr, the 
baseline power, as the rated active power of the device (Prat), and Ur, the 
baseline voltage, as the rated effective supply voltage of the device (Urat). 
All the other electrical baseline values are obtained from these two on 
the basis of the electrical engineering laws. For example, the baseline 
current is
	
I
P
U
r
r
r
=
,
	
(3.32)
whereas the baseline resistance is
	
R
U
P
r
r
r
=
2
.
	
(3.33)
For ac circuits, the baseline frequency fr must be specified; as a rule, 
the rated frequency frat of the supply voltage is chosen.

119
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
Switching to the per-unit system does not change the form of the 
equations, but only the numerical coefficients. The main benefits of such 
conversion are as follows:
	
1.	Comparison of parameter values in different operating conditions is 
simplified. For example, if the voltage of some section of an electrical 
circuit is 2 pu, we understand that the voltage is twice the rated sup-
ply voltage.
	
2.	There is little change in the total resistance with change in the power 
of the device and its supply voltage. Therefore, in the absence of pre-
cise parameter values for the specific device, we may use mean per-
unit values, which are available in handbooks.
	
3.	The calculations are simplified because the coefficients and variables 
are of lowest order.
3.1.4  Two-dimensional mathematical description 
of a three-phase circuit
Coupled three-phase circuits—that is, three-phase circuits without a 
null lead—are widely used on account of their operational benefits. Such 
a three-phase system (Figure 3.5) contains three identical and intercon-
nected single-phase sinusoidal voltage sources, which differ only in that 
the sinusoid of each one is shifted by a third of a period (the angle 2π/3) 
with respect to the next

where Em is the amplitude of the supply voltage and ω is the frequency of 
the supply voltage. These sources operate with a symmetric three-phase 
load ZA = ZB = ZC. In this case, Kirchhoff’s first law in Equation 3.4 is 
always observed in the circuit. In other words, the phase-current vectors 
are related as follows:

(3.35)
In terms of mathematical description, this means that, besides the 
three differential equations describing the electrical processes in the 
three phases, we have the algebraic relation between the phase currents 
(Equation 3.35). Consequently, one phase current is a function of the other 
two and may be excluded from consideration. Thus, the behavior of the 
three-phase system may be analyzed on the basis of a two-dimensional 
description. This significantly simplifies the analysis of the behavior of 
the power electronic device and the design of an appropriate control. The 
selection of the two-phase coordinate system depends on the conditions 
of the problem and the characteristics of the power electronic device. We 
now consider some well-known two-phase coordinate systems for the 
analysis of three-phase systems.
3.1.4.1  Motionless Cartesian coordinate system (α, β)
Like the initial three-phase coordinate system (A, B, C), the new system is 
motionless; its α axis runs along the A-axis of the three-phase coordinate 
system (Figure 3.6). In that case, we may use the following matrix trans-
formation for direct coordinate conversion of vector X, that is, to express X 
in a motionless two-phase coordinate system, with allowance for the 2π/3 
phase difference of the axes of the three-phase system

Here kpr is a constant of proportionality, selected on the basis that the 
power is invariant (i.e., the power is the same in the three- and two-phase 
systems). Therefore, kpr will depend on the baseline values adopted for 
the coordinates and the modulus of the generalized vector. For example, 
kpr = 2/3 to ensure equal amplitudes of the phase voltages in the three- 
and two-phase systems, but kpr =
2 3  when describing a three-phase 
inverter system in terms of the effective line voltages.
For conversion of the coordinates from the two-phase to the three-
phase system, we use the following formula, which may be regarded as 
the inverse of Equation 3.36:

3.1.4.2  Rotating Cartesian coordinate system (d, q)
In many cases, it is expedient to use a rotating Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem in the analysis of the processes within the power electronic compo-
nent and the design of appropriate control laws. The rate of rotation Ω 
of the system is chosen equal to that of one of the device’s variables. For 
example, for electrical circuits, it is expedient to use the synchronous grid 
frequency. The behavior of synchronous machines (especially salient-pole 
machines) is often described using the Park equations, which are written 
in a coordinate system that rotates at the speed of the motor’s driveshaft 
(Leonhard, 2001). In that case, the electromagnetic processes in the syn-
chronous machine are described by differential equations with constant 
coefficients, rather than periodic coefficients; this simplifies the analysis. 
For induction motors, we use a coordinate system rotating at the speed 
of the rotor flux (Leonhard, 2001). This simplifies the formula for the 
motor’s electromagnetic torque, which takes the form of the product of 
two variables.
In most cases, the axis from which the rotation of the coordinate sys-
tem (d, q) is measured is the A-axis of the three-phase motionless coor-
dinate system or, equivalently, the α-axis of the motionless Cartesian 
coordinate system (α, β) (Figure 3.7).

3.1.4.3  ​Converting the instantaneous power of a three-phase 
system to the power of a two-phase system
To control the components of the instantaneous power in the three-phase 
system, the signals of the three-phase system may be converted into the 
two-phase system.
The theory of such transformation, known as p–q theory, was out-
lined in Akagi et al. (2007). It has been used to develop control systems for 
reactive-­power compensators and active filters. According to p–q theory, 
we may introduce the concepts of real and imaginary instantaneous pow-
ers in α–β coordinates

where p and q are the constant components of the instantaneous power p

frequency, and p and q are the variable components of p and q due to the 
higher harmonics.
Thus, in compensating the reactive power at the fundamental and 
higher current harmonics, the control signal must take account of the 
components q, p, and q of the instantaneous power.
3.1.5  ​Laplace transformation and transfer function
Structural analysis usually reduces to finding the current or voltage varia-
tion in the branches of the equivalent circuit—that is, to finding the solu-
tion of Equation 3.16 for a one-dimensional control plant or of Equations 
3.19 and 3.20 for a multidimensional one (Section 3.2.1).
If the structure is described by linear differential equations with con-
stant coefficient, an effective method of solution is to convert the initial 
time functions into functions of a Laplace variable by Laplace transforma-
tion (Doetsch, 1974). The main benefit of such transformation is that the 
differentiation and integration of initial functions are replaced by alge-
braic operations on their Laplace transforms. In other words, we need to 
only solve simple algebraic equations, rather than complex differential

equations. Inverse Laplace transformation to the time domain entails 
dividing the algebraic solution into the sum of simple fractions, finding 
their solutions from Table 3.1 for inverse Laplace transformation, and then 
superimposing the linear differential equations obtained.
The Laplace variable is denoted by s. The direct Laplace transform of 
the variable x(t) takes the form

depends on the initial conditions, is zero. Nonzero initial conditions are 
taken into account on inverse conversion to the time domain.
A control plant in Laplace space is most often described by means 
of a transfer function, which is the ratio of the Laplace transforms of 
the control plant’s output and input variables by zero initial conditions 
(Kwakernaak and Sivan, 1972). The transfer function is usually denoted 
by W, with a subscript whose first and second digits characterize the out-
put and input variables, respectively. In view of the linearity of Equation 
3.16, which describes a one-dimensional system, we may apply the super-
position principle. Correspondingly, the result of several disturbances of 
the linear system is equal to the sum of their individual results. In the 
present case, the supply voltage and an external disturbance act on the 
system. Those are the input variables. Thus, for our control plant, we may 
write two transfer functions.

3.1.6  ​Pulse modulation
A pulse (or pulsed signal) is a brief change in a physical quantity, such as 
a voltage, current, or electromagnetic flux (Figure 3.9). On the assumption 
that the rise and fall of the physical quantity are brief in comparison with 
the pulse duration, the basic parameters determining the properties of the 
pulse are the amplitude A (the maximum deviation from a specified level) 
and the duration timp. Usually, we observe a sequence of pulses over time, 
characterized by the sampling period T of pulse repetition. Thus, the 
pulsed signal is characterized by three parameters: timp, A, and T. Instead 
of the sampling period, we may use the sampling frequency; instead of 
the pulse duration, we may use the duty factor, defined as the ratio of the 
pulse duration to the sampling period

Modification of a specific parameter of the pulse sequence over time 
in a particular manner is known as modulation. The time dependence is 
known as the modulating function or modulation law. We may identify 
three simple or elementary modulations, in which only one of the param-
eters is modulated (Table 3.2).
Other modulations used in power electronics are combinations of 
several above-mentioned simple ones. For example, relay control pro-
duces pulse-width-time modulation that is a combination of pulse-width 
modulation and time one.
In addition, we may define two kinds of modulation on the basis of 
how the parameter changes.
•	 In modulation of the first kind, the parameter changes in accordance 
with the current value of the modulating function.
•	 In modulation of the second kind, the parameter changes in accor-
dance with the values of the modulating function at fixed times sep-
arated by an interval equal to the sampling period.

Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
The circuit component that produces modulation is known as a pulsed 
element. Its basic parameters are the pulse duration timp and the sampling 
period T (or equivalently the sampling frequency). These parameters 
are constant for a pulsed element of amplitude type and variable in all 
other cases.
A power electronic device includes a pulsed element (power switch) 
and a continuous structure. If the structure is linear, as is usually the case, 
and the pulsed element is of amplitude type, we obtain a linear pulsed 
structure. In the case of a pulsed element of pulse-width or frequency 
type, we have a nonlinear pulsed system, even if the continuous structure 
is linear.
3.1.7  ​Difference equations
For linear pulsed systems with modulation of the second kind, when the 
parameters vary in accordance with the values of the modulating func-
tion at fixed times separated by the sampling period, the concept of lattice 
functions has been introduced.
The values of the lattice function are calculated at discrete times, 
determined by the sampling period T. The lattice function consists of a set 
of discrete values of the continuous function x(t) at times t = kT, where k is 
an integer (Figure 3.10) and is written in the form x[kT] or, more briefly, as 
x[k], as the sampling period T is constant. The lattice function is related to 
the modulating function as follows:

The coefficients in Equations 3.66 and 3.67 are related by Equation 
3.65. Equation 3.67 is a recurrence relation, in which each successive value 
of the discrete function is represented in terms of its preceding value.
3.1.8  ​Discrete Laplace transformation (Z-transformation)
To solve difference equations, we use discrete Laplace transformation, 
D-transformation, and Z-transformation (sometimes known as Laurent 
transformation) (Doetsch, 1974). These transformations are related as 
follows:

Z x t

where x(t) is the initial function, L[x(t)] denotes direct Laplace trans-
formation, D[x(t)] denotes direct D-transformation, and Z[x(t)] denotes 
direct Z-transformation with the introduction of the new variable 
z = esT. The basic advantage of this transformation is that the difference 
equations are converted into simple algebraic equations. Inverse trans-
formation to the time domain involves dividing the algebraic solution 
obtained into the sum of simple fractions and finding their solution 
from the table of the inverse Z-transformation on the basis of the super-
position of linear equations (Table 3.3).
The direct Z-transform of the variable x(t) takes the following form.

The delay formula is simplified if the lattice function with a negative 
argument is zero. The advance formula is simplified if the lattice function 
is zero up to n = (m – 1). Analogous to Laplace space, we may use the con-
cept of a pulsed transfer function, which is the ratio of the Z-transform of 
the control plant’s output variable to the Z-transform of its input variable, 
with zero initial conditions. The transfer function is usually denoted by 
W. In its subscript, the first digit denotes the output value, whereas the 
second digit denotes the input value. As Equation 3.16, which describes 
the behavior of a one-dimensional system, is linear, we may apply the 
superposition principle. Accordingly, the result of the action of several 
disturbances on a linear system is equal to the sum of the results of each 
perturbation.

3.2  Analysis of the electrical processes in power 
electronic devices
3.2.1  ​Analytical solution of differential equations
As already noted, each structure of the power electronic device is 
described by linear differential equations. Therefore, a precise description 
of the electrical processes in the device may be obtained by solution of the 
differential equations describing the behavior of this structure.
The solution of Equation 3.16 is an n-times differentiable func-
tion x(t), satisfying the equation at all points of its region of definition. 
Usually, there is a whole set of such functions, and the selection of a 
single one is based on an additional stipulation, in the form of a set of 
initial conditions

It has a single solution.
The solution of the differential equation consists of two parts.
	
1.	The general solution xes(t) of the homogeneous differential equation—­
that is, the linear differential equation whose right side is zero, which 
describes the intrinsic properties of the power electronic device.
	
2.	The particular solution xfs(t), which is determined by the properties 
of the right side and describes the behavior of the power electronic 
device due to the applied disturbances.

Power electronics basics
For linear equations of first and second order, methods of solution have 
been developed. The solution is undertaken in two stages: first the homo-
geneous equation and then the nonhomogeneous equation (Appendix 3.2).
3.2.1.1  Solution of differential equations by Laplace 
transformation
As already noted, Laplace transformation is an effective means of solving 
linear differential equations with constant coefficients. The basic advan-
tages of this method are as follows:
	
1.	Replacement of the operations of differentiation and integration by 
algebraic operations on the Laplace transforms; in other words, alge-
braic equations are solved, rather than differential equations.
	
2.	Immediate determination of the differential equation’s complete 
solution.
	
3.	Inverse transformation to the time domain by means of the superpo-
sition principle and the corresponding tables.
The solution of Equation 3.45 in Laplace space takes the form

The solutions of this equation (its roots) are said to be poles of the 
system and determine the intrinsic motion of the control plant. The num-
ber of roots is equal to the order of the equation. The roots may be real, 
imaginary, or complex. Several identical roots (multiple roots) may exist.

135
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
The roots may be obtained in an explicit form for equations of up to 
fourth order (inclusive). Beginning with the fifth order, we use a general 
formula expressing the roots in terms of the coefficients by means of radi-
cals. Approximate methods may be used to find the roots.
After finding the roots s1,s2,…,sn, the characteristic polynomial 
(Equation 3.75) is rewritten as the product of factors. In other words, it is 
expanded in terms of the roots of the equation. The solution of Equation 
3.74 is written as the sum of regular simple fractions

Inverse transformation to the time domain is based on the superposi-
tion principle. Tables are used for inverse transformation of each term in 
Equation 3.77, and then convolution of the transformed terms is employed.
3.2.2  Fitting method
As already noted, the power electronic device is a system with variable 
structure, and each possible structure is described by linear differential 
equations. Therefore, precise description of the electrical processes in the 
power electronic device entails description of the processes in each pos-
sible structure and, hence, solution of the corresponding differential equa-
tions. We must also know the time at which each structure is switched on 
and the switching sequence of the structures.
This approach is known as the fitting method. When using this 
method, the solution of the differential equation describing the variation 
in the electrical variables is found for each structure, with unknown ini-
tial conditions. The different structures are combined on the basis of the 
switching rules. On transition from one structure to another, the initial 
conditions for the state variable of the power electronic device are assumed 
to be the final values in the previous structure. Thus, at the boundaries, 

136
Power electronics basics
the structures are stitched together by means of the continuous variable 
(the current at the inductance, the voltage at the capacitance, the mechani-
cal coordinates of the electromechanical device, etc.).
The self-oscillation condition in the power electronic device may be 
determined on the basis that the initial conditions of the repeating struc-
tures must be the same. When the repeating structure is switched on a 
second time, its initial conditions are written in terms of the initial con-
ditions for the first time, with allowance for the appearance of another 
structure.
3.2.3  Phase trajectories and the point-transformation method
The phase-plane method permits clear analysis of one-dimensional, 
­second-order systems. In this approach, the behavior of the system is ana-
lyzed in the space corresponding to the state variable and its derivative. In 
that case, the time variable is eliminated and, instead of Equation 3.17, the 
system is described in the form
	
x
f x
2
1
=
(
). 	
(3.78)
Each point of the phase plane, defined by the state variable x1 and 
its time derivative x2, corresponds to a single state of the system and is 
known as the phase point, image point, or representative point. The set 
of changes in state of the system as it functions is known as its phase 
trajectory. With fixed system parameters, only a single-phase trajectory 
passes through each point of the phase plane (except for singular points). 
Arrows on the phase trajectories show the displacement of the represen-
tative point over time. The complete set of phase trajectories constitutes 
the phase portrait. It provides information on all possible combinations of 
system parameters and on types of possible motion. The phase portrait is 
expedient for analysis of the motion in systems in which self-oscillation 
is possible.
When a second-order equation is written in terms of deviations Δx1 
and Δx2 from the equilibrium point as a function of the position of its 
roots λ1 and λ2 on the complex plane, different types of system behaviors 
are possible (Figure 3.11).
	
a.	Nondamping oscillatory motion (purely imaginary roots λ1 = jω and 
λ2 = −jω)
	
b.	Damping oscillatory motion (complex roots in the left half-plane 
λ1 = −δ + jω and λ2 = −δ − jω)
	
c.	Increasing oscillatory motion (complex roots in the right half-plane 
λ1 = δ + jω and λ2 = δ − jω)

137
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
	
d.	Damping aperiodic motion (two real roots in the left half-plane λ1 < 0 
and λ2 < 0)
	
e.	Increasing aperiodic motion (two positive real roots λ1 > 0 and λ2 > 0)
	
f.	Nondamping motion (two real roots, one positive λ2 > 0 and one 
negative λ1 < 0)
In Figure 3.11a through f, we show the phase trajectories in the vicin-
ity of the equilibrium points in all these cases and the corresponding posi-
tion of the roots.
3.2.4  ​The primary-component method
The primary-component method is based on harmonic or spectral analy-
sis and takes account of the filtering properties of the load.

conditions—in other words, that has a finite number of discontinuities

Harmonic analysis is understood to mean Fourier-series expansion 
of f(t) on the basis of Equation 3.79, with calculation of the Fourier coeffi-
cients ak and bk in Equation 3.81. Spectral analysis is Fourier-series expan-
sion based on Equation 3.79, with the determination of the amplitude Ak 
and phase φk of the harmonics (cosinusoids) in Equation 3.82. The spec-
trum of the function f(t) is its set of harmonics forming the Fourier series. 
The spectrum of the function includes the amplitude spectrum—that is, 
the set of amplitudes Ak = A[k]—and the phase spectrum φk = φ[k], cor-
responding to the frequency spectrum of the Fourier-series expansion, 
ωk = ω[k] = kω1, k = 0,1, …, ∞. Thus, any periodic signal may be regarded as 
a set of harmonic signals of different amplitudes and phases, with a fixed 
frequency spectrum.

Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
In view of its physical properties, the load to which the periodic func-
tion is supplied acts as a filter. In other words, it only transmits a limited 
frequency spectrum. For example, if high-frequency pulsed voltage is sup-
plied to a dc motor, the inductance of the armature circuit and the moment 
of inertia form a low-frequency filter for this voltage. Therefore, the motor 
speed will depend only on the mean component of this voltage, and the 
speed pulsation due to the high-frequency spectral components may be 
disregarded.
Thus, in view of the filtering properties of the power electronic device 
and the load, we may identify a dominant component in the Fourier-series 
expansion of the spectrum of the periodic discontinuous function. This is 
known as the primary, smooth, or useful component. All the other com-
ponents are regarded as noise that impairs the operation of the consum-
ing systems (their mechanical, energy, and other characteristics).
Usually, in view of the properties of the power electronic device, the 
primary component is assumed to be the constant component in convert-
ers with a dc output and the first voltage harmonic in converters with an 
ac output.
By identifying the primary component and by confining our attention 
to the corresponding electric process, we may significantly simplify the 
analysis of the power electronic device, which may be regarded as a linear 
continuous system described by equations of the following form.

the given control plant. In the general case, the number of independent 
variables may be different from the number of output variables. In other 
words, the matrix C may be rectangular. We call Equation 3.84 the equa-
tion of state and Equation 3.85 the output-variable equation.
3.2.5  ​Stability
In the analysis and design of power electronic devices, stability is a 
primary concern. A power electronic device is said to be stable if, after 
leaving the equilibrium (rest) state under the action of an external distur-
bance, it returns to that state when the disturbance is removed. If it does 
not return to the equilibrium state when the disturbance is removed, it 
is unstable. Normal functioning of the system requires that it is stable. 
Otherwise, even small changes in the initial conditions will produce 
large errors.
The Lyapunov definition of stability is the classical form (Kwakernaak 
and Sivan, 1972). The solution x0(t) of a nonlinear differential equation

is stable in the Lyapunov sense if, for any t and any ε > 0, there exists a 
value of δ(ε, t) > 0 (depending on ε and possibly on t0), such that if the initial 
deviation of the vector from the rated value is ||

For linear systems, the necessary and sufficient condition for stability 
is that the roots of the characteristic equation be on the left half-plane of 
the complex plane; in other words, they must have a negative real com-
ponent. Numerous algebraic and frequency methods permit determina-
tion of the system’s stability without finding the roots of the characteristic 
equation. Those methods may be used in analyzing the device’s behavior 
if it is described in terms of the primary component. For example, the 
Routh–Hurwitz algebraic criterion is as follows. The necessary and suf-
ficient condition for a linear steady dynamic system to be stable is that all 
the n diagonal minors of the Hurwitz determinant be positive, where n is 
the order of the characteristic equation.
The Hurwitz determinant is formulated from the coefficients of the 
characteristic equation as follows.
	
1.	All the coefficients of the characteristic equation are ranked along 
the primary diagonal from left to right, beginning with the coeffi-
cient of the term of order (n – 1) and ending with the free term.

141
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
	
2.	From each element of the diagram, the corresponding column of the 
determinant is arranged, so that the subscripts decline from top to 
bottom.
	
3.	The coefficients with below-zero subscripts or large n are replaced 
by zero.
The diagonal minor is the determinant obtained from the Hurwitz 
determinant by eliminating the row and column corresponding to the 
given diagonal element.
For nonlinear systems, the stability is determined by means of the 
second Lyapunov method, which is a sufficient stability condition. 
According to that criterion, the system is stable if it is possible to select 
a sign-definite Lyapunov function that includes all of the system’s state 
variables and whose derivative is sign-definite or sign-constant but with 
the opposite sign.
A sign-definite function is a function that tends to zero only at the coor-
dinate origin. A sign-constant function is a function that vanishes not only 
at the coordinate origin, but also at all other points of space. If the deriva-
tive is sign-definite, asymptotic convergence occurs. Usually, the Lyapunov 
function is selected as a quadratic function, which is, by definition, a sign-
definite positive function. Its derivative is then analyzed: if the system is to 
be stable, the derivative must be sign-definite or sign-constant and negative.
3.3  ​Control methods
3.3.1  Control problems and principles
The purpose of a power electronic device is to convert the input electrical 
energy into output energy with specified characteristics, corresponding 
to the needs of the overall system. The actual state of the power electronic 
device is characterized by one or more control variables.
As noted in Section 3.1, we may distinguish between multidimen-
sional (MIMO) and one-dimensional (SISO) systems.
There are three fundamental control principles (Figure 3.12).
	
1.	Open control
	
2.	Control based on disturbances (the compensation principle)
	
3.	Closed control (the feedback principle, control based on deviations)
In open control, the control at the input of the power electronic device 
is calculated on the basis of the technological requirements and complete 
information regarding not only the power electronic device, but also all 
the disturbances present. The controlled variable is not monitored. The 
advantage of this method is its simplicity. A significant disadvantage is 
the need for complete information regarding the power electronic device 

142
Power electronics basics
and all the disturbances present, as inaccuracy will lead to error in the 
controlled variable.
To eliminate the influence of disturbances on the control process, 
the compensation principle is employed. In that case, as well as a control 
designed to meet the technological requirements with specified distur-
bance or no disturbance, we also supply a control based on information 
regarding the current disturbance and intended to compensate for that 
disturbance. The compensation principle is effective if it is possible to 
obtain information regarding the disturbances.

143
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
Closed control is based on the comparison of the specified value of 
the controlled variable with the actual value in the presence of unknown 
disturbances. The discrepancy is used to select the control for the power 
electronic device. In other words, the control takes account not only of the 
specification, but also of the actual state of the power electronic device 
and the disturbances. Therefore, this is the most widely employed control 
principle. It permits successful control where the disturbances and the 
parameters of the control plant are indeterminate. The automatic systems 
based on closed control are known as automatic control systems.
The last two control principles are sometimes used together. This con-
stitutes composite control, offering the highest precision.
In the most general case, the reference is an arbitrary function of the 
time, which is determined by an external control unit (controller). The 
processing of that reference is a tracking process. Particular cases of track-
ing are as follows:
	
1.	Stabilization (maintenance) of the control value at a specified con-
stant level
	
2.	Program control, which involves adjustment of the specification 
according to a predetermined schedule
Precise and fast processing of the reference is required, with arbitrary 
external disturbances.
In multidimensional systems, with several independent controls, we 
are dealing with the control of several controlled variables.
3.3.2  ​Structure of control system
We may distinguish between several approaches to the design of auto-
matic control systems, based in different mathematical models of the 
power electronic device.
•	 Single-loop control (Figure 3.13a)
•	 Two-step single-loop control (Figure 3.13b)
•	 Cascade (subordinate) control (Figure 3.13c)
In the first case, we use a precise model of the power electronic device, 
taking account of the discontinuous switch characteristic. Control design 
entails solving a nonlinear problem, whose complexity is due to the sig-
nificant nonlinearity of the power electronic device. The switching fre-
quency and the time at which different power switches are on will be 
generated automatically in the closed loop, as a secondary element in the 
overall control of the power electronic device. Such dynamic systems are 
characterized by high speed and low sensitivity to variation in the param-
eters and external disturbances. Regrettably, in this case, the automatically 

144
Power electronics basics
generated switching frequency of the power switches is not constant but 
depends on the initial conditions. This increases the switching losses of 
the power switches.
In the second case, we use a model of the power electronic device 
with a mean component and solve two independent problems: control of 
the power electronic device as a linear object and high-frequency control 
of the power switches. Control system 1 is synthesized within the frame-
work of linear control theory, on the assumption that control system 2 
creates the necessary high-frequency sequence of voltage pulses, whose 
mean component corresponds to the primary control problem, and the 
high-frequency voltage components are filtered out on account of the low-
frequency properties of the load.
The control of the power switches is formulated independently. Open 
control is chosen, with modulation. The modulation law and the switch-
ing law, determining the frequency and the duty factor of the switches, are 
specified externally. However, in that case, as already noted, the automatic

Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
compensation of the external disturbances and fluctuations in the internal 
parameters rely on the control loop for the power electronic device.
Finally, cascade control is based on subdivision of the initial control 
problem in terms of the speed of the processes in the system. Each of the 
resulting control problems is then solved independently. As in the preced-
ing case, we employ the natural division into fast and slow processes in the 
power electronic device; again, the natural filtering properties of the power 
electronic device and the load are taken into account. The slow external loop 
includes control system 1 and power electronic device 1 and is described by 
the mean component, as the fast internal loop, consisting of control system 
2 and power electronic device 2, instantaneously processes its input signal; 
in other words, its transfer function is one. The internal loop is responsible 
for control of the switches on the basis of feedback. Correspondingly, it is 
relatively fast and insensitive to variation in the parameters and external 
disturbances. Note that, as in the first case, the switching frequency of the 
power switches is generated automatically and depends on the initial con-
ditions. This may increase the switching losses of the power switches and 
the mechanical noise in electromechanical energy converters.
3.3.3  Linear control methods
As already noted, if we adopt the model of the power electronic device in 
terms of the mean, analysis of the device and control design may be based 
on linear automatic control theory. This theory is well developed, espe-
cially for one-dimensional systems (Kwakernaak and Sivan, 1972).
3.3.3.1  ​Controller design for one-dimensional control systems
As noted in Section 3.2.4, the first requirement in any automatic control 
system is stability: after removal of disturbances, the system must return 
to the specified state or nearby steady conditions. This will occur if the 
intrinsic motion of the system is damping. A necessary and sufficient con-
dition for stability of the system is that all the roots of its characteristic 
equation be in the left half-plane of the complex plane.
The introduction of feedback changes the characteristic equation of 
the automatic control system, which includes the power electronic device 
and a controller.
The following controllers are widely used.

proportional to the discrepancy

We may use Equation 3.91 to identify stability regions if the con-
stant of proportionality K is selected as the variable parameter. This is 
known as D-division. For two parameters—for example, in the case of a 
PI ­controller—we obtain a Vyshegradskii diagram.
The selection of the controller coefficients will determine the position 
of the roots of the characteristic equation and hence the system’s stabil-
ity and transient. Selection of the desired root configuration is known as 
modal control.
3.3.3.2  ​Controller design for multidimensional control systems
In contrast to one-dimensional systems, multidimensional systems are 
characterized by several independent variables and several independent 
controls; in general, the number of independent variables will not be the 
same as the number of independent controls. Therefore, the control design 
in such systems is more complex and includes several stages. The first is to 
determine whether the system is controllable or may be stabilized.
A controllable system may be moved from any initial state X0 to an 
arbitrary state X1 in finite time by piecewise-continuous control signal U.
For systems with constant parameters, the necessary and sufficient 
condition for controllability is nondegeneracy of the controllability matrix

When the available controls do not ensure controllability, the next step 
is to investigate whether the system may be stabilized. A system that may 
be stabilized is understood to mean a linear dynamic system, in which 
two vectors X* and X** may be formed from the components of the state 
vector X: X

** . The state vector X* may be moved from any 
initial state X*(0) to an arbitrary state X*(t) in finite time by a piecewise-
continuous control signal U present in the system, while state vector X** is 
stable. For the sake of clarity, we use the nondegenerate linear transforma-
tion of the state vector

In that case, the second vector equation describes the motion of the 
state-vector components that are independent of the control. Those com-
ponents must be stable if the system as a whole is to be stable. The first 
vector equation of motion of the state-vector components must be control-
lable. For these components, a controller may be designed to ensure that 
their actual values match their specified values. The stable values of the 
state-vector components in the second equation appear in the first equa-
tion as an external disturbance.
There may be several means by which a particular system may be 
stabilized, as the linear-transformation matrix satisfying Equation 3.93 is 
selected somewhat arbitrarily.
For a controllable or stabilized linear system, linear feedback
	
U = −KX,	
(3.95)
such that the closed system that is stable may always be selected. Here K 
is the feedback matrix.

148
Power electronics basics
This may be explained, in that the stability of the system is deter-
mined by the characteristic numbers of the matrix A − BK, which depend 
on the selection of the elements in matrix K. In other words, the character-
istic numbers may be in arbitrary positions on the complex plane (given 
that the roots are complex-conjugate).
As already noted, a system that may be stabilized is broken down 
into two subsystems. The first is uncontrollable but stable; the second is 
controllable, and the desired root configuration may be ensured by nega-
tive feedback.
Thus, in a system that may be stabilized, only some of the roots may 
be positioned arbitrarily. The remaining roots must lie in the left half-
plane of the complex plane, in view of the system’s properties.
3.3.4  ​Relay control
As noted in Section 3.1.3, if the switching function applies only to the input 
voltage and its variation is determined by the state of the system’s control 
variables—­as in Equations 3.23 and 3.24, for example—these power elec-
tronic devices are of relay type. At present, methods of analysis and design 
are best developed for one-dimensional second-order power electronic 
devices (Tsypkin, 1984). In particular, the phase-plane method permits clear 
representation of the processes in the system. This method is based on math-
ematical description of the power electronic device in terms of deviations 
from the rated value, as in Equation 3.30. In the Cauchy form

Here C is a constant of integration.
When integration is difficult, the phase trajectories may be approxi-
mately plotted without integration by the isoclines method. At each point 
of an isocline, the slope of the phase trajectories (integral curves) has the 
same constant value dx1/dΔx = k = const. If we specify different values 
of the slope, we may construct a dense grid of isoclines, each of which 
includes small segments with specified slope k. Then, beginning at the 
initial point in phase space, we plot a line intersecting each isocline at 
the angle specified by the directional field. The resulting curve will be an 
approximate representation (sketch) of the phase trajectory.
The set of all phase trajectories is known as the phase portrait of the 
system.
The phase trajectories in different states of the switching function are 
spliced at the switching line in the space whose dimensions are the error 
and its derivative.
As the relay control system has a switching function, the self-
oscillation parameters in the relay system will depend on the state of 
that function. The self-oscillation parameters may be determined from 
the parameters of the steady limiting cycle. The self-oscillation ampli-
tude corresponds to the deviation of the limiting cycle from zero at the 
error axis.
The switching condition of the phase function in phase space is a zero

When a term depending on the error’s derivative is introduced in the 
switching function, the parameters of the limiting cycle are changed. On 
the phase plane, the switching line is converted from a vertical line coin-
ciding with the axis to an inclined line (slope C) passing through the coor-
dinate origin.
In certain conditions, the phase trajectories of relay systems are 
directed toward the switching line from both sides. In that case, the point 
describing the behavior of the system moves along the switching line 
to the coordinate origin. This is known as sliding mode. In terms of the 
physical processes in the system, self-oscillation occurs at infinitesimally 
small frequency.
Then, with scalar control, the necessary and sufficient condition for 
sliding mode, which is the stability condition in switching-function space, 
takes the form

Equation 3.102 defines a region from which the system reaches the 
switching line and remains there, in the state space corresponding to 
Equation 3.99. When Z = 0, it determines a class of permissible distur-
bances and references that may be reproduced without dynamic track-
ing error. Equation 3.103 describes the operational algorithm for a relay 
control.
For one-dimensional first-order systems, sliding motion occurs at the

As already noted, the actual value of the control variable is equal to 
the specified value in self-oscillation.
In contrast to electronic power switches, mechanical switches—in 
particular, relays—are characterized by a limit on the switching number. 
Therefore, high-frequency self-oscillation is not an option in that case. 
Instead, hysteresis-based control is employed: the ideal relay is replaced 
by a relay with hysteresis. This permits reduction of the switching num-
ber per unit time. In that case, the controlled variable will be within a 
range that depends on the width of the hysteresis and will be equal to the 
required value, on average.
3.3.5  ​Sliding-mode control
In multidimensional relay systems with several relay elements, the con-
trol design is a complex problem, with no analytical solution in most

cases. On account of the presence of discontinuous (relay) control in such 
systems, it seems natural to use the theory of sliding-mode systems (Utkin 
et al., 2009; Ryvkin and Palomar Lever, 2011). In particular, as shown for 
the example of one-dimensional relay systems in Section 3.3.4, the non-
linear dynamic systems with such control have attractive properties such 
as high quality of control and insensitivity to external disturbances and 
parameter variation of the control plant.
In terms of control, a multidimensional power electronic device is 
a nonlinear dynamic system with linear introduction of the control u(t), 
which is discontinuous on account of operation of the power switches

The sliding motion in the discontinuous system corresponding to 
Equations 3.105 and 3.106 must ensure solution of the control problem—
that is, zero error of the controlled variables Z(t) = zz(t) − z(t) and z(x) ∈ Rl. 
Here z(x, t) is the controlled variable vector and zz(x,t) is the reference con-
trolled variable vector. In other words, the existence of sliding motion is 
equivalent to stable motion of the initial system described by Equations 
3.105 and 3.106, relative to the coordinate origin in the l-dimensional error 
space of the controlled variables. Using the terminology of stability theory 
for nonlinear systems, we may speak of the conditions of sliding motion 
in the large and small (global and local sliding motions, respectively). 
Stability in the small is equivalent to the existence of sliding motion over 
a surface of discontinuity, which corresponds to zero error of the com-
ponents of the controlled variable vector Z t

 as discontinu-
ous control is reversed at this surface, or over the intersection of several 
surfaces of discontinuity. Stability in the large is not only associated with 
sliding motion over the surface of discontinuity or the intersection of sur-
faces of discontinuity, but also defines the incidence condition—that is, 
the condition guaranteeing that the mapping point will move from an 
arbitrary initial position to the surface of discontinuity or intersection of 
surfaces of discontinuity.

Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
The existence of sliding motion is usually investigated by determin-
ing the Lyapunov stability (Section 3.2.5). In that case, we consider equa-
tions corresponding to the projection of Equations 3.105 and 3.106 onto the 
error subspace of the controlled variables

where G is an l × n matrix, whose rows are the gradient vectors of the

In scalar control, the necessary and sufficient condition for sliding 
motion over a single surface of discontinuity Z(x) = 0 in Equation 3.99 is 
that the deviation from the surface of discontinuity and its rate of change 
must have opposite signs.
In vector control, there is no universal condition for sliding motion 
over the intersection of surfaces of discontinuity. Most known conditions 
for multidimensional sliding motion are expressed in terms of sliding 
with relation to the manifold Z(x) = 0, and the stability problem is solved 
by Lyapunov’s second method. The corresponding sufficient conditions 
are written in terms of the D matrix of Equation 3.107.
3.3.5.1  ​Sufficient conditions for the existence of sliding motion
In a system corresponding to Equations 3.105 and 3.106, sliding motion 
over the manifold Z(x) = 0 exists if one of the following conditions is 
satisfied.

154

m-dimensional sliding motion is broken down into m one-­dimensional 
motions.
	
2.	There is a control hierarchy in the system, so that the multidimen-
sional problem is reduced to m one-dimensional problems, which 
are solved successively. In that case, one component of the control 
vector—say u1—ensures sliding motion over the surface Z1(x) = 0, 
regardless of the other components. After sliding motion over the 
surface Z1(x) = 0 appears, control u2 ensures sliding motion over the 
surfaces Z1(x) = 0 and Z2(x) = 0, regardless of the other control com-
ponents and so on. In this approach, the sufficient conditions for 
multidimensional sliding motion are obtained on the basis of the 
analogous conditions for the scalar case in Equation 3.99:

Obviously, the sufficient condition of sliding motion obtained 
by means of a control hierarchy is the same as the sufficient condition 
obtained on the basis of the second Lyapunov method when the matrix D 
is diagonal.
The equivalent-control method is used to describe the motion of the 
system corresponding to Equations 3.105 and 3.106, with sliding motion 
over all or part of the manifold Z(x) = 0, which is necessary when using a 
control hierarchy (Utkin et al., 2009). It has been established that sliding 
motion may be described by the equivalent continuous control ueq. This 
control ensures that the time derivative of vector Z(x) is zero on the sys-
tem’s trajectories

With the specified structure of the system, Equation 3.112 depends only 
on the elements of matrix G. Hence, by changing the position of the dis-
continuity surfaces in the system’s state space, we may modify the sliding 
motion. Design of the desired sliding motion is a problem of lower order 
than our initial problem, because the sliding motion is described not only 
by Equation 3.112 but also by m algebraic equations of the discontinuity 
surfaces Z(x) = 0. This permits reduction by m in the order of Equation 3.112.
Thus, in the general case, the design of motion in systems with dis-
continuous control may be broken down into three problems.
	
1.	The design of sliding motion
	
2.	The existence of sliding motion
	
3.	Incidence at the sliding manifold
The first problem is solved by selecting the switching functions that 
ensure the desired sliding motion. Classical methods from automatic con-
trol theory may be used here, as the right side of the differential equations 
is continuous.
The second and third problems are complicated because sufficient con-
ditions have been stated for the existence of sliding motion. When using 
the first sufficient condition, matrix D in Equation 3.107 must be reduced 
to a special form. This is accomplished not by selecting the matrix G so as 
to ensure solution of the first problem, but by using the matrix Ru(x,t) of 
linear nondegenerate transformation of the control vector

where Z* is the vector of new discontinuity surfaces. This approach is 
made possible by the invariance of the sliding equation to these transfor-
mations. Design requires the selection of the desired discontinuity sur-
faces and the subsequent transformation of these surfaces or the control 
vector corresponding to sufficient conditions for the existence of sliding 
motion or incidence at the sliding manifold.
Note that, if D in Equation 3.107 is reduced to a diagonal form, the 
transformations in Equations 3.113 and 3.114 will lead to different results.

156

When using linear nondegenerate transformation of the control vec-

(3.115)
In that case, depending on the points x for which they are satisfied, 
the sufficient conditions ensure existence of the sliding motion or even 
incidence at the sliding manifold. In other words, they ensure sliding 
motion in the small or in the large.
When using linear nondegenerate transformation of the discontinuity 
surfaces, the corresponding matrix RZ(x,t) is selected in the form (D)−1, and 
the transformed equation may be written as follows:

3.3.6  ​Digital control
In terms of control system design, digital technology has introduced 
systems with quantization of magnitudes and time. In contrast to con-
tinuous signals, the signals to and from digital controllers take discrete 
values at discrete times (Kwakernaak and Sivan, 1972; Isermann, 1981). 
Quantization with respect to the time is a periodic process, with period T. 
If no allowance is made for the characteristics of digital control systems, 
the use of analog algorithms leads to reduced static precision of the sys-
tem, the appearance of an oscillatory component (with amplitude propor-
tional to the period), and beats.
The design of digital control systems is significantly different from 
the analysis and design of continuous systems, for the following reasons. 
First, the design of digital control systems is based on difference equa-
tions, which replace the differential equations describing continuous sys-
tems. Secondly, within the period T, the control may be particularized 
in terms of the rate of the processes, and the equation may be simplified 
because of the quasiconstant variables within this period. Thirdly, the 
memory (of capacity m) in the system stores the previous values of the 

157
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
state vector and control vector, which may be used in control. Fourth, 
the resulting digital algorithms are generally implemented on microcon-
trollers, with constraints on the length of the computation cycle and spe-
cific computational resources.
For computations in a microprocessor controller, the basic variable is 
the length of the computation cycle, which is closely related to the mea-
surement times and computational capacity of the microprocessor. In what 
follows, we assume synchronous control and solution of the control prob-
lem within a single cycle (corresponding to the quantization period T). In 
other words, we assume sufficient computational capabilities to form the 
control command for the executive device within a single cycle. Note that, 
in principle, the solution of the control problem in this case cannot take 
less than two computational periods. In the first step [k, k + 1], on the basis 
of the available information regarding the variables and specifications, 
the digital controller formulates the control commands for the executive 
device, such that solution of the control problem is possible at the end of 
the next step [k + 1, k + 2]. In the second step, these control commands are 
sent to the executive device. This delay, if significant for the given system, 
must be appropriately compensated. The time diagram of the calculations 
is shown in Figure 3.15.
In view of the foregoing, the design of high-quality digital control 
systems for power electronic devices requires the development of special 
design methods that actively utilize the characteristics of digital systems.
Thus, the first step in the design of digital control is to obtain a precise 
analytical difference model of the control plant based on the existing dif-
ferential equations. We make the following assumptions here.

2.	The period T is small in comparison with the time constant of the 
control plant.
	
3.	The rates of the mechanical processes, magnetic processes (typical 
time constants 10–100 ms), and electrical switching processes (typi-
cal time constants 10–100 µs) are significantly different. Accordingly, 
some variables may be regarded as quasiconstant.
This approach allows complex control problems to be broken down 
into simpler problems.
The solution of the control problem entails solving algebraic differ-
ence equations, with the specification of conditions for as many steps as 
are required.
Note that the core of the digital controllers used for power electronic 
devices is a digital signal processor. The high frequency of such processors 
(up to 200 MHz) ensures a total cycle length of 25 µs (40 kHz). In that case, the 
use of digital controllers in the control system for a power electronic device 
is practically the same as that of analog controllers for continuous systems.
3.3.7  ​Predict control
At present, the control of dynamic objects by means of predictive mod-
els (predict control) rests on a formalized approach to the analysis and 
control design systems, based on mathematical methods of optimization 
(Linder et al., 2010; Rodriguez and Cortes, 2012).
The main benefits of this approach are the relative simplicity of cre-
ating feedback and excellent adaptation. Adaptation permits the control 
of multidimensional and multiple connected control plants with complex 
structures (including nonlinearity); real-time optimization of the pro-
cesses with constraints on the control and controlled variables; and the 
accommodation of indeterminacy in the references of the control plant 
and disturbances. In addition, we may take account of transport delays, 
change in the control plant characteristics in the course of the process, and 
failures in the measurement sensors.
For a dynamic control plant, predict control is based on feedback and 
employs the following step-by-step procedure.
Program control is optimized using the mathematical model of the con-
trol plant (the predictive model), whose initial conditions correspond to the 
current state of the control plant. The goal of optimization is to reduce the 
error between the controlled variables of the predictive model and their cor-
responding references in some finite time period (the predictive horizon). 
In optimization, all the constraints on the control and controlled variables 
are taken into account, in accordance with the selected quality functional.
In the computation step, which takes up a fixed short segment of the 
predictive horizon, optimal control is implemented, and the actual state 

159
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
of the object at the end of the step is measured (or derived from the mea-
sured variables).
The predictive horizon is shifted one step forward, and this proce-
dure is repeated.
Note the following points.
	
1.	Systems of nonlinear differential equations may be used as the pre-
dictive model.
	
2.	Constraints on the control and the components of the state vector 
may be taken into account.
	
3.	The functional characterizing the quality of control is minimized in 
real-time.
	
4.	Predict control enquires direct measurement or estimation of the 
state of the control plant.
	
5.	In general, the predicted behavior of the dynamic control plant will 
differ from its actual motion.
	
6.	For real-time operation, optimization must be rapid within the per-
missible delay.
	
7.	Direct implementation of this control algorithm does not guaran-
tee stability of the control plant, which must be ensured by special 
methods.
3.3.8  Artificial intelligence in power electronics
The control methods discussed so far are based on a precise mathemati-
cal model of the control plant. When it is difficult or impossible to derive 
this model, we may resort to artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence 
employs information technology—in particular, the following methods.
•	 Fuzzy logic (Bose, 2000)
•	 Neural networks (Bose, 2000, 2007)
•	 Genetic algorithms (Bose, 2000, 2007)
3.3.8.1  Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic (the theory of fuzzy sets) is a generalization of the classi-
cal logic and set theory. In classical Boolean algebra, the characteristic 
function (indicator, indicator function) χA of a variable (the analog of the 
switching function in power electronics) is binary (Figure 3.16a)

where xin(t) is the variable to which the characteristic function is applied

In fuzzy logic, the characteristic function, sometimes known as the 
membership function and usually denoted by μA, may take any value in 
the interval [0, …, 1]. This allows us to take account of the fuzziness of the 
estimates, often expressed in terms of letters.
The membership function is formulated by expert assessment. More 
than 10 standard curves are used for the specification of the membership 
function; for example, triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian functions. 
The simplest triangular function is most commonly used (Figure 3.16b). It 
is specified by the analytical formula

1.	Fuzzification: the selection of a set of input signals for the control sys-
tems (usually the control errors), determination of the number of lin-
guistic variables and the corresponding ranges of the input variables, 
and the conversion of each range to fuzzy format, which entails the 
selection of a membership function μ(x) for each range (Figure 3.18).
	
	   The notation for linguistic variables in the theory of fuzzy sets 
takes a conventional form, with two letters. Each letter characterizes

a property of the range. The first denotes the sign of the range: N, 
negative; Z, zero; P, positive. The second characterizes the extent of 
the range: S, small; M, medium; L, large. Thus, NL is a negative large 
range; NM a negative medium range; and PL a positive large range. 
There may be any number of such ranges. However, larger numbers 
require experts formulating the rules for all combinations of input 
variables to have considerably greater experience.
	
2.	Formulation of the control in fuzzy-logic terms: to this end, we generate 
a framework of fuzzy rules based on the classical IF–THEN opera-
tor, which designates an operation that only occurs on satisfaction of 
some conditions. These rules are formulated on the basis of expert 
assessments and establish a correspondence between the ranges of 
control variables and the ranges of control: for example, if x1 ∈ Z and 
x2 ∈ NS, then u ∈ NS. For two input variables, these rules may be 
reduced to a tabular form (Table 3.4). In each cell of the table, the cor-
responding range of the control is recorded.
	
	   Then, on the basis of information regarding the error in regulat-
ing the variable in accordance with these rules, the membership 
function of the control signal is truncated. The value of x at any 
time belongs simultaneously to several linguistic variables and will 
have a particular value of the membership function for each one. 
Within the framework of each rule, with each combination of input 
variables, the maximum value of the membership function is calcu-
lated in accordance with the conversion rules for logical variables. 
In other words, the membership function of the control is converted 
from a triangle into a trapezium. For two measurable variables, this 
approach is clearly illustrated in Figure 3.19. One combination of 
numerical values x1 = d and x2 = f corresponds to four combinations 
of linguistic variables, that is, to four fuzzy rules.
	
a.	 Rule 1: if x1 ∈ Z and x2 ∈ NS, then u ∈ NS.
	
b.	 Rule 2: if x1 ∈ Z and x2 ∈ Z, then u ∈ Z.

d.	 Rule 4: if x1 ∈ PS and x2 ∈ Z, then u ∈ PS.
	
	   For each of these fuzzy rules, we calculate the truncated mem-
bership function. As each combination is possible—in other words, 
the OR operation applies—the membership function for each com-
bination of numerical values of x1 and x2 is the sum of the truncated 
membership functions for each fuzzy rule. The final operation in 
this step is to obtain the range of membership functions of the con-
trol for the given combination of x1 and x2 (Figure 3.20).
	
3.	Defuzzification: conversion of the fuzzy-logic variable to a physi-
cal control for the power electronic device. Various defuzzification 
methods are possible. The most common is the mean-center or cen-
troid method. The geometric interpretation of this method is that the 
physical control selected is the control corresponding to the center of 
gravity of the membership function range

3.3.8.2  ​Neural networks
In this approach, a controller that mimics a biological neural network is 
designed. An artificial neural network is based on an artificial neuron, 
that is, a simplified model of a natural neuron (Figure 3.21).
Inputs (x0,x1, …, xn) are sent to the input of the neuron. Here x0 is the 
displacement signal and x1, …, xn provide the information required for

the solution of the control problem. These signals, with corresponding 
weighting factors w0, w1, …, wn, are summed and sent to the input of the 
module, calculating the transfer function (also known as the activation 
function or triggering function). This transfer function, which may be lin-
ear or nonlinear, completely characterizes the properties of the neuron. In 
Figure 3.22, we show the most common transfer functions.

The output signal of the module calculating the transfer function is 
also the neuron’s output signal. Thus, in mathematical terms, the neuron 
is some nonlinear function of a linear combination of input variables

where i is the number of the neuron’s input variable.
By connecting the outputs of some neurons to the inputs of others, 
we obtain neural networks. Many such networks exist such as the per-
ceptron, the adaptive neural network, the perceptron with dynamic links, 
and a network of radial basis functions. At present, about 90% of the neu-
ral networks employed are feedforward networks. In power electronics 
and electric drives, wide use is made of the multilayer (usually three-
layer) perceptron with dynamic links.
Combinations of neurons to which the same combination of input 
signals is sent are known as layers of the neural network. An exception 
is the first layer, to each neuron of which one input signal is supplied. To 
eliminate the influence of the units of measurements, all the input sig-
nals are written as relative variables (Section 3.1.3). All the subsequent 
transformations also employ relative variables. The network’s output 
variables are converted back into physical units. The input neurons usu-
ally have a linear transfer function, and the weighing factor of the input 
signal is one.
Each neuron in the second layer (the hidden layer) receives signals 
from all the input neurons and the displacement signal. The transfer func-
tion of these neurons is a hyperbolic tangent in the case of bipolar input 
signals and a sigmoid function in the case of a unipolar signal. The third 
layer (the output layer) contains neurons with a linear transfer function. 
The number of neurons in each layer except the first is established experi-
mentally. In Figure 3.23, we show a 3–5–2 three-layer neural network. This 
network contains three input neurons, five neurons in the hidden layer, 
and two output neurons.
Before use, the neural network must be tuned up. This process, 
known as learning, involves sending successive values of the input vec-
tor from a representative training set to the input of the neural network. 
This set contains P pairs of values of the input vector and the corre-
sponding output vector of the real control plant, for which the neural 
model is being designed. The weighing factors w0, w1, …, wn of the neu-
rons in the hidden and output layers are varied until the set of output-
vector values is close to the requirements. We may assess the quality of 
training in two ways.

The Levenberg–Marquardt method, which ensures rapid conver-
gence, most often determines the weighing factors.
With specified structure of the neural network, training ends on 
satisfying Equation 3.122 or 3.123. If we specify the square of the error 
in Equation 3.122 or the mean-square error in Equation 3.123, training 
also includes selection of the network structure—in other words, an 
increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer, as the number 
of neurons in the input and output layers is determined by the physi-
cal properties of the object. This process continues until the calculated 
error is less than a specified value.

Power electronics basics
At the end of that process, training is regarded as complete. The net-
work parameters are fixed, and the network is prepared for use in the con-
trol system. As the training set is representative, the neural network is able, 
after training, to adequately describe the behavior of the real control plant.
In this way, we obtain a static neural model of the object of control, 
which may be used for the analysis of the power electronic device’s behav-
ior and design of the control algorithms if the processes in the device are 
relatively slow.
Where we need to obtain a neural model for a dynamic system—in 
other words, where we need to take account of the control plant’s dynamic 
properties—we use recurrent neural networks in which the input signals 
consist of information not only regarding the current input variables but 
also regarding the input and output variables in previous steps.
Such a neural controller is trained directly on the basis of the input 
and output data of the control plant, by means of an inverse neural model. 
In the limiting case, this model may serve as the controller, when the 
transfer function of the power electronic device with the neural control-
ler is one and the output variable matches its specification. A significant 
deficiency of this approach is that identifying and adjusting the controller 
involves a complex multiparametric search for an extremum.
3.3.8.3  Genetic algorithms
Genetic algorithms may be used to find the global optimum required in 
the training of neural networks. In genetic algorithms, natural mecha-
nisms are used for the recombination of genetic information, so as to 
ensure adaptation within a population. The algorithms represent stochas-
tic heuristic optimization methods based on evolution by natural selection 
and operate with a set of individuals (a population). Each individual is a 
possible solution of the given problem and is assessed by a measure of its 
fitness, in terms of how well it corresponds to the solution of the problem. 
In nature, this is equivalent to assessing how effective the organism is in 
the competition for resources. The fittest individuals are able to reproduce, 
by crossbreeding with other individuals in the population. This generates 
new individuals, with a new combination of characteristics inherited from 
the parents. The least-adapted individuals are least likely to reproduce, so 
that their properties will gradually disappear from the population in the 
course of evolution. There will sometimes be mutations or spontaneous 
changes in the genes.
Thus, from generation to generation, good characteristics spread 
throughout the entire population. The interbreeding of the fittest indi-
viduals means that the most promising sections of search space are inves-
tigated. Ultimately, the population will converge to the optimal solution 
of the problem. The advantage of the genetic algorithm is that it fines 
approximately optimal solutions in a relatively short time.

169
Chapter three:  Control of power electronic devices
Thus, the genetic algorithm used in searching for a global minimum 
in the case of a neural network, say, includes the following components:
•	 The initial population (a set of initial solutions)
•	 A set of operators (rules for the generation of new solutions based on 
the previous population)
•	 A target function assessing the fitness of the solutions (also known 
as the fitness function)
The initial population contains several individuals with particu-
lar chromosomes. Each gene in the chromosome conveys information 
regarding the value of a specific attribute of the object; for instance, the 
weighting factor of a specific neuron. All subsequent operations of the 
genetic algorithm occur at the level of the genotype. Accordingly, we may 
dispense with information regarding the internal structure of the object. 
This accounts for the wide use of this method.
The standard set of operators for all types of genetic algorithms con-
sists of selection (reproduction), crossover (crossbreeding), and mutation.
Selection. In selection, we choose chromosomes on the basis of 
their fitness functions. There are at least two popular types of selection 
operator.
	
1.	In roulette-wheel selection, the individuals are chosen on the basis 
of n spins of the roulette wheel. The wheel contains one sector for 
each member of the population. The size of sector i, corresponding 
to individual i, is proportional to the relative value of the fitness 
function for that individual

	 where f(i) is the value of the target function for individual i. The 
members of the population with the highest fitness will be selected 
with greater probability than those with low fitness.
	
2.	In tournament selection, n individuals are selected on the basis of n 
tournaments. Each tournament includes k members of the popula-
tion and selects the best participant. Most commonly, k = 2.
Crossover. In crossover, two (or more) chromosomes in the population 
exchange segments. We may distinguish between single-point selection 
and multipoint selection. In single-point selection, a division point is ran-
domly selected. The division point is a section between adjacent genes of 
the chromosome. Both parental structures are broken into two segments 

170
Power electronics basics
at this point. Then the corresponding segments of the different parents 
are spliced together, and two new genotypes are produced.
Mutation. A mutation is a random change in part of the chromosome.
The genetic algorithm operates iteratively. The process continues for 
a specified number of generations or until some other termination condi-
tion is satisfied. Each generation of the genetic algorithm includes selec-
tion, crossover, and mutation (Figure 3.24).

Each row of the triangle corresponds to a specific order i of the poly-

the polynomial of zero order at the top, each subsequent row corresponds 
to an increase in the order by 1. The arrows show which operations are 
performed. Specifically, each number is added to each adjacent term.

Line-commutated converters
4.1  Introduction
The operating principle of a converter depends on the type of power 
switches and commutation methods employed. We consider two groups 
of power electronic switches.
•	 Incompletely controlled switches
•	 Self-commutated (full controlled) switches
The first group includes diodes, whose controllability is limited 
because they are switched under the action of forward voltage, and 
­silicon-controlled rectifiers (thyristors). The second group contains all 
electronic switches that are turned on and off by currents or voltages 
arriving at their control input.
A fundamental difference between the two groups is the commu-
tation method. In an electronic converter, commutation is understood 
to mean the transfer of current from one or more simultaneously con-
ducting switches to other switches during a finite interval in which all 
the switches being turned on and off are in the conducting state. For the 
power electronic switches in the first group, commutation is possible by 
means of an ac voltage such as a grid voltage. For single-throw thyristors, 
such commutation is said to be natural if the conducting thyristors are 
turned off as a result of polarity reversal of an external supply voltage. 
Therefore, converters with power switches from the first group are some-
times known as line-commutated converters (International Electrical-
Engineering Dictionary, 1998, IEC, BO050-551). They correspond to the 
operational principles of many converter circuits and hence will be the 
focus of attention in the present chapter (Rozanov, 1992; Rozanov et al., 
2007). They are also sometimes classified on the basis of less significant 
characteristics such as the following:
•	 The rated power (low, moderate, high, etc.)
•	 The working voltage and current (low-voltage, high-voltage, low-
current, high-current, etc.)
•	 The frequency of the input or output voltage (low-frequency, high-
frequency, etc.)
•	 The number of phases (single-phase, three-phase, multiphase, etc.)

176
Power electronics basics
•	 The modular design principle (multicell, multilevel, etc.)
•	 The method of thyristor commutation (with capacitor commutation, 
commutation by an LC circuit, commutation under the action of load 
resonances, etc.)
•	 The presence of resonant circuits to reduce switching losses (quasi-
resonant dc converters, etc.)
•	 The control method (in terms of the input or the output, modification 
of the switch control algorithm, etc.)
In practice, other aspects of converter operation are sometimes used 
for classification purposes. However, they usually lack clear definitions 
and are not mentioned in the corresponding standards.
4.2  Rectifiers
4.2.1  The rectification principle
In electronic power rectification, the ability of power electronic switches 
to conduct unidirectional current is employed to convert alternating cur-
rent to direct current without significant energy losses. The specifics of 
the rectification process will depend on factors such as the following:
•	 The type of switch and its control method
•	 The dc load
•	 The characteristics of the ac source
In considering the rectification principle, we make the following 
assumptions:
	
1.	A sinusoidal voltage source with stable frequency is connected to 
the dc side.
	
2.	The switches employed are diodes VD or thyristors VS with ideal 
characteristics.
	
3.	The load consists of specific point components.
	
4.	There are no additional losses in the rectification circuit.
For a more detailed study of the factors affecting the rectification pro-
cess, we consider the simplest possible circuit, with a single switch; this is 
known as a half-wave circuit (Figure 4.1a). The switch employed is a diode 
VD or thyristor VS. If the thyristor is turned on at moments when the fir-
ing angle α = 0 (Figure 4.1a), the processes in the circuit will correspond 
to those observed when a diode is turned on. The following loads are 
considered.

•	 An active load with resistance Rd (branch 1 in Figure 4.1a)
•	 An active–inductive load with resistance Rd and inductance Ld 
(branch 2 in Figure 4.1a)
•	 An opposing dc voltage source Ed with inductance Ld (counter-emf 
load; branch 3 in Figure 4.1a)
4.2.1.1  Circuit with active load
Here and in what follows, the time diagrams are plotted in terms of the 
angle ϑ = ωt, where ω is the angular frequency of the ac source. Thus, the 
input voltage is e(ϑ) = Em sin ϑ. In the circuit with diode VD, the current id 
begins to flow as soon as the forward voltage is applied. In other words, 
it conducts from the time ϑ = 0 to ϑ = π, when the voltage is zero and the 
diode is turned off. Negative voltage is applied to diode VD in the next 
half-period, and it is nonconducting. The current in load Rd reproduces

Power electronics basics
the input voltage during the conducting interval from 0 to π. At time 
ϑ = 2π, the cycle repeats (Figure 4.1b).
When diode VD is replaced by thyristor VS, current flow begins when 
the control pulse is supplied to the thyristor gate from the control system 
(CS). The delay after time ϑ = 0 will depend on the firing angle α (Figure 
4.1c). The thyristor will be switched off when voltage e(ϑ) (and hence cur-
rent id) falls to zero, that is, when ϑ = π. As a result, current id will flow for 
a shorter time than with a diode, specifically, for time λ = π − α.
In this interval, the current reproduces the form of the voltage e(ϑ). 
As a result, periodic unidirectional currents id appear at load Rd, which 
indicates rectification. In other words, a constant component of current Id 
will appear in the load Rd when voltage e(ϑ) is supplied by an ac source.
4.2.1.2  Circuit with resistive–inductive load
The character of the load on the dc side has considerable influence on the 
rectification process. For example, if a thyristor is turned on at time ϑ = α 
in a load containing not only resistor Rd, but also a reactor with induc-
tance Ld (branch 2 in Figure 4.1a), the current id will be determined by the 
equation

Figure 4.1d shows the input voltage e(ϑ) and current id when α = π/3. 
It is evident that the current id continues to flow through the thyristor 
after voltage e(ϑ) passes through zero. This is possible because the energy 
stored in the inductance Ld during the first half-period maintains the cur-
rent id after the voltage reverses the sign until the time ϑ = α + λ − π, when 
current id is again zero.

179
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
4.2.1.3  Counter-emf load
A load in the form of a dc emf with polarity opposite to the switch may 
also be of practical interests. Such rectification circuits are used, for 
instance, in battery chargers and in systems for power recuperation from 
a dc source to an ac grid.
In some operating conditions, a large filter capacitor at the rectifier 
output may be regarded as a counter-emf source.
Branch 3 in Figure 4.1a corresponds to a half-wave rectifier circuit 
with diode VD and counter-emf Ed. At time ϑ = ϑ1 (Figure 4.1e), the source 
voltage e(ϑ) exceeds the counter-emf Ed. Hence, forward voltage is applied 
to diode VD and it begins to conduct current id in the opposite direction to 
Ed. Under the assumptions already noted, connecting a source with volt-
age e(ϑ) to the counter-emf Ed will result in infinite growth in current id. To 
prevent this, a reactor with inductance Ld is introduced in the dc circuit. In 
that case, the current id will be

(4.3)
The period corresponding to flow of current id may be divided into 
two parts an increase in id in the interval ϑ1–ϑ2 and a decrease in id in 
the interval ϑ2–ϑ3. At time ϑ2, e(ϑ) is again equal to the counter-emf Ed. 
The second interval corresponds to voltage regions of opposite polarity 
at inductance Ld. The integral areas S1 and S2 of these regions (shaded in 
Figure 4.1e) are equal. That corresponds to balance of the stored and con-
sumed energy in inductance Ld

When ϑ = ϑ2, the current id is maximum. At specified values of e(ϑ) 
and Ed, the replacement of diode VD by a controllable thyristor permits 
the regulation of id by adjusting the firing angle α. This angle corresponds 
to the switching delay of the thyristor relative to the time ϑ1 at which a 
forward voltage is applied to the thyristor.
4.2.2  Basic rectification circuits
We will consider idealized rectification circuits, under the following 
assumptions:

180
Power electronics basics
	
1.	The semiconductor components are ideal. In other words, when they 
are on, their resistance is zero; when they are off, their conductivity 
is zero.
	
2.	The semiconductor components are switched on and off instanta-
neously. In other words, the switching process takes no time.
	
3.	The resistance of the circuits connecting the components is zero.
	
4.	The resistance of the transformer windings (active and inductive), 
the energy losses in its magnetic system, and the magnetizing cur-
rent are all zero.
The electromagnetic processes associated with rectification are con-
sidered for two types of static load: active and active–inductive. Such 
loads are typical of most moderate- and high-power rectifiers.
In this section, we consider thyristors operating with active and 
active–inductive loads when the firing angle α > 0. Obviously, when α = 0, 
the processes in the circuit will be the same as for uncontrollable diode-
based rectifiers. As the three-phase bridge circuit is most common, we 
will consider processes with α = 0 in that case.
4.2.2.1  Single-phase circuit with center-tapped transformer
A single-phase full-wave circuit with a center tap is shown in Figure 4.2a. 
The full-wave circuit is sometimes known as a two-cycle or two-phase 
circuit, as it rectifies both voltage half-waves. In this circuit, the secondary 
half-windings of the transformer relative to the tap create a system of volt-
ages with a mutual phase shift ϑ = π.
We will consider the operation of the circuit with an active load 
(when switch S in Figure 4.2a is closed). Suppose that, beginning at 
ϑ = 0, both thyristors are off, and no current flows. We assume that the 
potential of point a of the secondary winding is positive relative to the 
tap (point 0), whereas point b is negative. (In Figure 4.2a, this polarity is 
noted outside the parentheses.) Obviously, with this polarity of the sec-
ondary-winding voltage, the forward voltage uVS1 = ua0 will be applied 
to thyristor VS1, whereas inverse voltage ub0 will be applied to thyristor 
VS2. Suppose that at time ϑ = α (i.e., with delay α relative to the moment 
when voltage ua0 passes through zero), a control pulse is supplied to the 
control electrode of thyristor VS1. Then VS1 is switched on, and cur-
rent id = iVS1 begins to flow in load Rd under the action of voltage ua0. 
Beginning at that moment, inverse voltage uab will be applied to thyris-
tor VS2. Here uab is the difference between the voltages in the secondary 
half-windings ua0 and ub0.
Thyristor VS1 will be on until the current flow falls to zero. As the 
load is active and the current passing through the load—and hence 
through thyristor VS1—is of the same form as voltage ua0, thyristor VS1 
is switched off at time ϑ = π. As the voltage at the secondary winding

reverses polarity after half of the period, the supply of a control pulse at 
time ϑ = π + α switches thyristor VS2 on. These processes are repeated in 
each period.
The possibility of a specific phase delay α in the moments at which the 
thyristors are switched on permits change in the output voltage. We mea-
sure α from the moments of natural thyristor switching (ϑ = 0, π, 2π, …), 
corresponding to the moments when diodes are turned on in an uncon-
trollable circuit. It is evident from Figure 4.2b that, with an increase in α, 
the average output voltage Ud will decline. Analytically, this dependence 
takes the form

(4.6)
According to Equation 4.6, an increase in α from 0 to π reduces the 
average output voltage from Ud to zero. The dependence of the average 
output voltage on the firing angle is known as the control characteristic.
The presence of inductance Ld in the dc circuit at α > 0 means that 
current will flow through the thyristor after the voltage at the secondary 
half-winding passes through zero, on account of the energy stored in the 
inductance. For example, thyristor VS1 continues to conduct current after 
the voltage ua0 becomes negative (Figure 4.3a). As a result, the period λ of 
current flow through the thyristor increases, and the rectified voltage will 
include a section of negative polarity from 0 to ϑ1, when the current in the 
thyristors falls to zero. With an increase in Ld, the thyristors will conduct 
for a time λ = π, and ϑ1 = α. This corresponds to a boundary-continuous 
rectified current id. In these conditions, each thyristor conducts current for 
half-period π, with zero current at the beginning and end of each half-
period. The inductance Ld at which such behavior is observed is said to be 
the boundary or critical inductance. With a further increase in Ld or with an 
increase in the rectifier load, the rectified current remains continuous and 
its pulsations are smoothed. At large values ωLd/Rd > 5–10, the current id is 
practically completely smoothed, and rectangular current flows through 
the thyristors (Figure 4.3b). Obviously, with an increase in α, the area of the 
negative sections in the rectified voltage increases, and hence the average 
rectified voltage declines. The average rectified voltage corresponds to its 

183

constant component. When ωLd = ∞, the constant component is applied at 
resistance Rd and the variable component at inductance Ld.
As the form of the rectified voltage is repeated in the interval from α 
to π + α, its average value may be found from the formula

According to Equation 4.7, the average rectified voltage is zero when

rectified voltage are equal, and there is no constant component (Figure 
4.4). The control characteristic for a resistive–inductive load corresponds 
to curve 2 in Figure 4.5.

Power electronics basics
If the value of ωLd/Rd is such that the energy stored in inductance 
Ld in the interval when ud > 0 is insufficient for current flow over half of 
the period, the thyristor that is conducting this current will be switched 
off before the control pulse is supplied to the other thyristor. In other 
words, current id will be discontinuous. If we compare Figure 4.3a 
and b, we see that, at the same α, the average rectified voltage will be 
greater for discontinuous current than for continuous current, due to 
the decrease in the area of the negative section on the rectified-voltage 
curve, but less than for rectifier operation with an active load (with

no negative sections). Therefore, with discontinuous current, the con-
trol characteristics will be between curves 1 and 2, within the shaded 
region in Figure 4.5.
With discontinuous current, the transformer and thyristor circuits 
operate in more challenging conditions, as the effective value of the cur-
rents in the circuit elements is greater at the same average rectified cur-
rent. Therefore, in powerful rectifiers operating with a wide variation of 
α, the inductance Ld is usually selected so as to ensure the continuous 
rectified current at near-rated loads.
The parameters of the circuit components are calculated by classi-
cal electrical-engineering methods. For example, the average thyristor 
current is

If the current id is ideally smooth, it is simple to determine the effec-

Their determination is more complex in the case of poorly smoothed or 
discontinuous current id. In that case, equivalent circuits must be formu-
lated for the thyristor conduction periods.

4.2.2.2  Single-phase bridge circuit
For a single-phase bridge circuit (Figure 4.6) operating with α > 0, the volt-
ages and currents at its components are of the same form as in a single-
phase center-tap full-wave circuit (Figures 4.2 through 4.5). The basic 
difference is that a single-phase voltage Uab is supplied, rather than the 
half-winding voltages Ua0 and Ub0. As a result, two thyristors VS1 and VS3 
or VS2 and VS4 participate in the rectification of each voltage half-wave. 
Therefore, when the firing angle α = 0 (or in an uncontrollable diode-
based rectifier), the average rectified voltage at the load is

The control characteristics of the circuit depend on the ratio ωLd/Rd

4.2.2.3  Three-phase circuit with center-tapped transformer
1. Operation with α = 0. The three-phase circuit with a tap (Figure 4.7) is 
a three-phase single-cycle circuit, as only one half-wave of the alternating 
voltage in each phase is rectified. We will consider the operating principle 
of this circuit for the case in which the primary transformer windings are 
in a delta configuration, whereas the secondary windings are in a star 
configuration. First, we assume that switch S is closed. In other words, 
the circuit has an active load. The relations are then refined for the case in 
which switch S is open, on the assumption that ωLd = ∞.
In the interval ϑ0 < ϑ < ϑ1 (Figure 4.8), thyristor VS1, connected to 
phase a, is conducting. Beginning at time ϑ1, the potential of phase b 
exceeds that of phase a, and the anode of thyristor VS2 is at a positive volt-
age relative to the cathode. If a control pulse is supplied to thyristor VS2 at 
time ϑ1, it is switched on, whereas thyristor VS1 is switched off under the 
action of the shutoff voltage uab. The load current id begins to flow through 
thyristor VS2, which is connected to phase b.
The conducting state of thyristor VS2 continues for a period of 120°, 
until time ϑ2, when the potential of phase c exceeds that of phase b and a 
control pulse is supplied to thyristor VS3. At time ϑ2, thyristor VS3 begins 
to conduct, and thyristor VS2 is switched off. Then, at time ϑ3, current 
flow resumes at thyristor VS1, and the preceding sequence is cyclically 
repeated.
Obviously, each thyristor will conduct for a third of the grid voltage 
period (2π/3). For the remainder of the period (4π/3), the thyristor is off 
and is subject to reverse voltage. Thus, when thyristor VS1 is off, the line 
voltage uba is applied to VS1 during the period when thyristor VS2 is con-
ducting, whereas voltage uca is applied when thyristor VS3 is conducting. 
As a result, reverse voltage uVS1 is applied to thyristor VS1 (Figure 4.8).

As the secondary-winding currents in this circuit are pulsating and 
include a constant component, an induced magnetization flux appears in 
the transformer magnetic system and can result in magnetic saturation. 
That entails increase in the calculated transformer power. The currents in 
the primary windings only contain variable components, as the constant 
components are not transformed. Therefore, the currents in the primary 
windings take the form

We consider the currents in the thyristors and the transformer wind-
ings and the calculated transformer power for a circuit with an active–
inductive load, which is most typical of three-phase and multiphase 
rectification systems. In the case of an active–inductive load, the circuit 
operation is the same as with an active load, but the current id is ideally 
smoothed, whereas the currents through the thyristors are rectangular. 
Correspondingly, the currents in the transformer windings are also rect-
angular. In that case, the curves of the rectified voltage ud and the reverse 
voltages at the thyristors are the same as in the case of an active load, and 
the currents are as follows

where U1 and U2 are the effective phase voltages of the primary and sec-
ondary windings, I1 and I2 are the effective currents in the primary and 
secondary windings, respectively, and Pd is the average load power.
2. Operation with α > 0. In this case, in contrast to an uncontrollable 
rectifier or a controllable rectifier with α = 0, the control pulses reach 
the thyristors alternately, with a delay α relative to the time at which 
the sinusoid of the line voltage in the secondary transformer windings 
passes through zero. The times at which the sinusoidal line voltage 
passes through zero correspond to intersection of the sinusoidal phase 
voltages ua, ub, and uc. When the firing angle α > 0, different operating 
conditions may be observed, depending on the type of load and the 
range of α.
If α varies in the range from 0 to π/6 (Figure 4.9), the rectified current 
is continuous for both active and active–inductive loads. The average rec-
tified voltage in this range of α is described as follows:

Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
With an active–inductive load, the energy stored in the inductance 
Ld sustains the rectified current id in the load even after the rectified volt-
age becomes negative. If the energy stored in the inductance Ld lasts until 
the thyristors are switched again, operation with continuous current id is 
­possible. When ωLd = ∞, continuous current will be observed for any α in 
the range from 0 to π/2. In that case, the average output voltage Ud may be 
determined from Equation 4.21. When α = π/2, the positive and negative 
sections within the rectified voltage curve are equal in area. That indicates 
the lack of a constant component in the rectified voltage; in other words, 
the average value of Ud is zero.
In accordance with the foregoing, we can distinguish two character-
istic intervals of α in the control characteristics (Figure 4.11). In the first 
(0 < α < π/6), with either active load or active–inductive load, the control 
characteristics correspond to Equation 4.21. In the second (π/6 < α < 5π/6), 
with an active load, the control characteristic is analytically described by 
Equation 4.22, and the average value of Ud is zero when α = 5π/6. In the 
case of an active–inductive load, with continuous current id, the control 
characteristic in the range π/6 < α < 5π/6 corresponds to Equation 4.21. 
The shaded region indicates the family of control characteristics in the 
case of discontinuous current id with different values of ωLd/Rd.
4.2.2.4  Three-phase bridge circuit
1. Operation with α = 0. The three-phase bridge circuit is shown in 
Figure 4.12. The corresponding current and voltage waveforms are shown 
in Figure 4.13 for the case in which α = 0. We now consider circuit opera-
tion for an active load (with switch S closed). Beginning at time ϑ1, current 
flows through thyristors VS1 and VS6, whereas the other thyristors are off. 
In that case, the line voltage uab is applied to load Rd, and current id flows 
through the circuit consisting of phase winding a, thyristor VS1, load Rd,

thyristor VS6, and phase winding b. This process continues until time ϑ2 
(for a period of π/3), when the potential of phase b becomes more posi-
tive than that of phase c. At time ϑ2, voltage ubc becomes positive; in other 
words, it is a forward voltage for thyristor VS2. If a control pulse is sup-
plied at that moment to thyristor VS2, it begins to conduct, while thyristor 
VS6 is switched off. (There is commutation of thyristors VS6 and VS2.) For 
thyristor VS6, ubc is a reverse voltage. As a result, thyristors VS1 and VS2 
are on, while the others are off.
At time ϑ3, a pulse is supplied to thyristor VS3, which is switched 
on. Thyristor VS1 is off, as the potential of phase b is greater than that of 
phase a. Then, at intervals of π/3, commutation of the following thyris-
tor pairs is observed: VS2–VS4, VS3–VS5, VS4–VS6, and VS5–VS1. Thus, 
within the period of the supply voltage, there will be six commutations 
at intervals of π/3. Three occur in the cathode group of thyristors VS1, 
VS3, and VS5 (with connected cathodes), and three in the anode group 
of thyristors VS4, VS6, and VS2 (with connected anodes). Note that the 
number of thyristors in this circuit is not random but corresponds to the 
order in which they operate for the specified transformer phase sequence 
in Figure 4.12.
The sequential operation of different thyristor pairs in the circuit 
leads to the appearance of a rectified voltage at resistance Rd; it consists of 
parts of the line voltages of the secondary transformer windings (Figure 
4.13). It is evident that, at commutation, the line voltages pass through 
zero (when two phase voltages—ua and ub, say—are equal). Current flows 
through each thyristor for a time 2π/3; for the remainder of the period, 
reverse voltage consisting of segments of the corresponding line voltages 
is applied to the thyristors.
The constant component of the rectified voltage (the average value) is 
calculated over the interval of repetition of the rectified voltage (π/3)

2. Operation with α > 0. In a three-phase bridge circuit based on thy-
ristors, the control pulses are sent with delay α relative to the zeros of 
the line voltages (the moments when sinusoidal phase voltages intersect; 
Figure 4.14).
Due to the delay α, the average rectified voltage formed from the corre-
sponding segments of the line voltages is reduced. As long as the instanta-
neous rectified voltage ud remains above zero (in the range 0 < α < π/3), the 
rectified current Id will be continuous, regardless of the load. Therefore, in 
that range of α, the average rectified voltage for active and active–­inductive 
loads is

With an active load, the firing angle α = π/3 corresponds to boundary-
continuous operation (Figure 4.15, left). When α > π/3, with an active load, 
intervals of zero voltage ud and zero current id appear. In other words, 
operation with discontinuous rectified current begins. In that case, the 
average rectified voltage is reduced.
When α = π/2, the positive and negative sections within the rectified 
voltage curve are equal in area. That indicates the lack of a constant com-
ponent in the rectified voltage; in other words, the average value of Ud is 
zero (Figure 4.15, right).
Note that, with discontinuous current id, double control pulses sepa-
rated by some interval or single pulses of length greater than π/3 must be 
supplied to the thyristors not only to ensure operation of the circuit, but 

197
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
also for initial startup, because the thyristors of the anode and cathode 
groups must be switched on simultaneously in order to create a circuit 
suitable for current flow.

control characteristic is again described by Equation 4.27. The shaded 
region in Figure 4.16 corresponds to the family of control characteristics 
with discontinuous current id at different firing angles α.
For high-power rectifiers (above 1000 kW), with high voltage and cur-
rent, we use multiphase circuits consisting of several bridges in series or 
parallel.
4.2.2.5  Multiple-bridge circuits
We may distinguish between multiple-bridge circuits with a single trans-
former and those with two or more transformers coupled in different 
configurations. The main purpose of multiple-bridge circuits is to reduce 
the ripple of rectified voltage and to improve the form of the current con-
sumed from the grid, so that it is more sinusoidal.
Figure 4.17 shows two types of two-bridge circuits. The first consists 
of a three-winding transformer in a star/star–delta configuration and two 
three-phase bridges. The second includes two two-winding transformers 
and two three-phase bridges. One transformer is in star/star configura-
tion, and the other in delta–star configuration.
In both cases, the phase shift of the transformer secondary voltages 
is π/6.
The two circuits operate analogously. Therefore, we will consider 
only one in more detail: the circuit with two transformers. As the primary 
windings of transformers T1 and T2 are in different configurations, there 
will be a phase shift of π/6 between the pulsations of the rectified voltage 
Ud1 of one circuit and Ud2 of the other circuit. To balance the instanta-
neous values of the rectified voltages, the bridges are connected in parallel 
through a compensating inductor. As a result, the total voltage at the load 
will have a ripple frequency twice that of each circuit. In the present case, 
each bridge circuit has six pulsations per period, and the total voltage 
will have 12 pulsations per period. Therefore, this is sometimes known 
as a 12-phase circuit. (Likewise, in view of the number of pulsations per 
period, a three-phase bridge circuit is sometimes known as a six-phase 
circuit.) The difference in instantaneous voltages is experienced by the 
equalizing reactor, whose two coils are mounted on a single core. The 
instantaneous values of the rectified voltage may be written in the form

Figure 4.18 shows the current waveforms for 12-phase circuits (when 
ωLd = ∞). It is evident that the current consumed from the grid is more 
sinusoidal than that for a single-transformer circuit.

Power electronics basics
Note that normal circuit operation requires the selection of the trans-
formation ratios of transformers T1 and T2, so that the average voltages 
Ud1 and Ud2 are equal.

According to Equation 4.32, the amplitude of the first harmonic (n = 1) 
is the greatest. The others decline in inverse proportion to n2.

where Un is the effective value of the nth harmonic.
In practice, the ripple (the content of the variable component) in the 
rectified voltage is estimated on the basis of the ripple factor Kr. The delay 
α in supplying the control pulses to the thyristors (with respect to the nat-
ural commutation times) changes the harmonics in the rectified voltage. It 
is evident from plots of the rectified voltage that the variable component 
(the ripple) increases with α rising. However, the period of the ripple pul-
sations does not depend on α.
4.2.3.2  Distortion of the input current
It follows from the operating principles of the rectifier circuits that they 
mostly consume nonsinusoidal current from the grid. Only a single-phase 
full-wave rectifier with an active load, when α = 0, consumes sinusoidal 
current, with zero amplitude of the higher harmonics. With a resistive–
inductive load, when ωLd = ∞, the current is rectangular and may be 
expressed as the sum of harmonics

where kT is the transformation ratio.
It is evident from Equation 4.34 that the primary current of the full-
wave circuit (m = 2) contains only odd current harmonics. The influence of 

204
Power electronics basics
higher harmonics on the grid is particularly pronounced when the power 
of the ac source is comparable with the rectifier power.
The harmonic composition of the current consumed from the grid 
by a controllable rectifier depends significantly on the load. If the load is 
active or active–inductive but does not ensure continuous current id, the 
amplitude of the higher current harmonics will increase with an increase 
in α (with constant amplitude of the first harmonic).
With an active–inductive load and ideally smoothed rectified cur-
rent, the firing angle α has no influence on the harmonic composition of 
the consumed current. Note that this conclusion assumes zero inductive 
impedance of the transformer windings.
Usually, passive or active filters are employed to reduce the voltage 
ripple and the distortion of the rectifier input and output current.
4.2.3.3  The commutation of the thyristors
In theoretical analysis, switching of the current from one thyristor to 
another (commutation) is assumed to be instantaneous. In practice, com-
mutation will have certain duration on account of inductive impedance in 
the ac circuit—in particular, the impedance of the transformer windings, 
which is mainly due to scattering fluxes in the transformer’s magnetic 
system.
This impedance is determined in experimental short-circuiting of 
the secondary transformer windings and is taken into account in circuit 
analysis on the basis of general (for each phase) equivalent inductances 
Ls, which correspond to the total inductance of the secondary winding 
and the reduced (in terms of the number of turns) inductance of the pri-
mary winding. In addition to the inductive impedance, the commutation 
processes also depend on the active impedance of the windings, but to 
a much smaller degree, in normal conditions. Therefore, in considering 
commutation, we only take account of the windings’ inductive imped-
ance; the rectified current is assumed to be ideally smoothed (ωLd = ∞). 
Given that the commutation processes are qualitatively the same in dif-
ferent circuits, we will consider a simple rectifier: a single-phase full-wave 
circuit.
Figure 4.20a presents the equivalent circuit of a thyristor-based single-
phase full-wave rectifier, together with voltage and current diagrams. The 
inductive impedance of the windings is taken into account by introducing 
inductance Ls. Suppose that thyristor VS1 is on. At time ϑ1, a control pulse 
is supplied to thyristor VS2. As its anode potential is positive with respect 
to the cathode at that moment, thyristor VS2 is switched on.
Beginning at time ϑ1, both thyristors will be on, and the transformer 
secondary half-windings short-circuit one another. Under the action of 
emfs ea and eb of the secondary half-windings, the short-circuit current isc 
appears in the short-circuited circuit (the commutation loop), which is the

commutation current. At any time from ϑ1 on, this current may be deter-
mined as the sum of the two components: a steady component isc  and a 
free component isc

When thyristor VS2 is switched on and thyristor VS1 is switched off, 
the resultant short-circuit current isc runs from the half-winding b with

we may write the following current equation for point 0 as

Equation 4.38 is valid for any time. If the current flows only through 
thyristor VS1, we obtain iVS1 = Id and iVS2 = 0. With simultaneous conduc-
tion of thyristors VS1 and VS2 (during commutation of the current from 
thyristor VS1 to thyristor VS2), iVS1 = Id − isc and iVS2 = isc. When the current 
flows only through thyristor VS2, we obtain iVS2 = Id and iVS1 = 0.

According to Equation 4.41, γ declines with an increase in α. In physi-
cal terms, we may say that an increase in α boosts the voltage under which 
the current isc in the commutation circuit develops, and hence isc reaches 
Id more rapidly.
Note that the duration of current flow in the thyristors is greater by γ 
than in the idealized circuit. It is π + γ.
Commutation has a significant influence on the rectified voltage Ud, 
as the instantaneous rectified voltage in the given circuit falls to zero in 
the commutation intervals (Figure 4.20b). As a result, the average rectified

4.2.3.4  External rectifier characteristic
The rectifier characteristic is the dependence of the average rectified volt-
age on the average load current: Ud = f(Id). It is determined by the inter-
nal resistance of the rectifier, which results in a decrease in the rectified 
voltage with an increase in the load. The decrease in the voltage includes 
components due to the active circuit impedance ΔUR, the voltage drop 
in the thyristors ΔUVS, and the inductive impedance ΔUx that appears in 
commutation.
Correspondingly, the rectifier characteristic (when ωLd = ∞) may be 
written in the form

According to Equation 4.45, the rectifier’s output voltage declines 
with an increase in the load current Id on account of the internal volt-
age drop. The influence of the active and reactive circuit components 
will depend on the rectifier power. Usually, the active impedance of the 

208
Power electronics basics
transformer windings predominates in low-power rectifiers, whereas 
the transformer’s inductive scattering impedance predominates in pow-
erful rectifiers.
Note that, at loads not exceeding the rated value, as a rule, the rec-
tifier’s internal voltage drop is not more than 15%–20% of the voltage. 
However, in the case of overloads and proximity to short-circuits, the 
internal impedance of the circuit becomes significant. In addition, with 
overloads in three-phase and multiphase circuits, qualitative changes are 
observed in the electromagnetic processes that affect the rectifier charac-
teristic. In Figure 4.21, as an example, the characteristics of single-phase 
and three-phase rectifiers are presented.
4.2.3.5  Energy characteristics of rectifiers
The power factor and efficiency of a rectifier require careful interpreta-
tion. We must distinguish between its output power, in which the ripple 
of the rectified voltage is taken into account, and the power determined 
by the average output voltage Ud and load current Id. The latter is usu-
ally regarded as the useful power and therefore employed in calculations. 
When the ripple is slight, the difference between these two quantities may 
be ignored.
The main losses of active power occur in the following components of 
power rectifiers: in the transformer (ΔPT), in the thyristors (ΔPVS), and in 
auxiliary equipment such as control, safety, cooling, and monitoring sys-
tems (ΔPaux). Accordingly, we may calculate the efficiency in the following 
form for a rectifier with small current pulsations

For the moderate- and high-power rectifiers manufactured today, the 
efficiency is 0.7–0.9.
The power factor is the ratio of the active power to the total power. It 
permits the determination of the total power consumed by a power con-
verter if its active load power and efficiency are known. In determining the 
rectifier power factor, we must take account of the nonsinusoidal component 
of the power that it draws from the grid. Figure 4.22 shows the grid volt-
age uc and grid current ic consumed by a single-phase controllable rectifier, 
on the assumption that the rectified current is ideally smoothed and there 
is no commutation angle. An analysis of the nonsinusoidal current yields 
the first harmonic ic1, which lags the voltage uc by φ1. Correspondingly, the 
active power P consumed by the rectifier may be expressed as

4.3  Grid-tie inverters
4.3.1  Operating principle
Inversion is the conversion of dc electrical energy to ac energy. 
Linguistically, the term comes from the Latin inversio, which signifies 
overturning. It was introduced in power electronics to denote the pro-
cess inverse to rectification. In inversion, the flux of electrical energy is 
reversed and supplied from the dc source to the ac grid. Such a converter 
is said to be a grid-tie inverter, as it is switched under the action of the 
alternating voltage in the external grid. As the electrical parameters of the 
converter are completely determined by the parameters of the external ac 
grid in this case, it is sometimes referred to as a dependent inverter.
We will consider the operating principle of the grid-tie inverter for the 
simple example in Figure 4.23a. We assume that the circuit components 
are ideal, and the internal resistance of the storage battery is zero.

211
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
Figure 4.23b shows voltage and current waveforms, illustrating the 
operation of the circuit in the rectifier mode. Under the assumption that 
the internal resistance of the ac and dc sources is zero, we may conclude 
that their voltages are equal to the emfs: eab = uab and EB = UB. If the posi-
tive terminal of the battery is connected in accordance with the dashed

Power electronics basics
line in Figure 4.23, the circuit may operate in the rectifier mode with a 
counter-emf load, which corresponds to battery charging. With reversal 
of the battery potential, an operation in the inverter mode is possible. We 
now consider these processes in more detail.
If a control pulse is supplied to the thyristor at time ϑ = ϑ1, deter-
mined by firing angle α, the thyristor is switched on. As a result, the sup-
ply of current id from the grid to the battery begins. Due to the smoothing 
reactor Ld, the current id will vary smoothly over time: it increases when 
uab > Ud and decreases when Ud > uab. At time ϑ3 (when the shaded areas in 
Figure 4.23b are equal), current id is zero and thyristor VS is switched off. 
The passage of current id through the thyristor in the interval from ϑ2 to 
ϑ3, when Ud > uab, is due to the electromagnetic energy stored in the reac-
tor Ld. Subsequently, these processes repeat periodically. As a result, the 
battery is charged by the rectified current. (Current id opposes the emf EB.)
For conversion of the circuit to the inverter mode, the battery polarity 
must be reversed.
Energy is transferred from one source to another when the current 
from the source opposes the emf of the source that is receiving this energy. 
In the present case, energy will be transferred to the grid from the battery 
when the grid emf eab opposes the current id. Voltage and current wave-
forms for the inverter mode are shown in Figure 4.23c. If a control pulse is 
supplied to thyristor VS at time ϑ1, the thyristor is switched on, under the 
action of a positive forward voltage. The forward voltage at the thyristor 
exists until time ϑ2. Thereafter, the voltage uab will exceed the emf EB in 
an absolute value. Under the action of the voltage difference UB − uab, the 
current id will flow in the circuit, in the direction opposite to the grid volt-
age uab. The smoothing reactor Ld in the circuit limits the rate of increase 
and the maximum value of id. Due to the energy stored in the reactor, cur-
rent continues to flow in the thyristor after the voltage uab exceeds Ud in 
absolute value. The current id is zero at time ϑ3, when the shaded regions 
in Figure 4.23c are equal in area.
In terms of circuit structure, dependent inverters are not significantly 
different from controllable rectifiers. Therefore, they may be regarded as 
reversible converters, capable of transmitting electrical energy from the 
grid to a dc source (rectifier mode) or from a dc source to the grid (inverter 
mode). Therefore, such converters are also known as ac–dc converters 
(International Electrical-Engineering Dictionary: Power Electronics, 1998).
4.3.1.1  Operation in the inverting mode
As already noted, we can switch from the rectifier to the inverter mode 
and back by reversing the polarity of the ac source relative to the common 
terminals of the anode and cathode thyristor groups in the bridge circuit.
Figure 4.24a shows the bridge circuit of a single-phase converter. The 
dashed line corresponds to the connection of the dc source with emf Einv 

213
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
in the inverter mode and the continuous line to the connection with emf 
Erec in the rectifier mode.
We assume that the inductance Ld is relatively large and the dc ripple 
may be neglected. In other words, we assume that ωLd = ∞ in the case of 
steady operation with different values of the firing angle α, which deter-
mines when the CS delivers the current pulses to the thyristors.
Figure 4.24 presents instantaneous values of the voltage ud(ϑ) on the 
dc side of the converter (ahead of the reactor Ld). Under the given assump-
tions, the emfs in the reactor and the inverter mode are equal: Einv = Erec. 
We consider steady operation, with α = 0, π/4, π/2, 2π/3, and π. The cur-
rent in the reactor Ld is assumed to be equal to the average value of the 
current Id, in all steady operating conditions. With variation in α as in 
Figure 4.24, this will be the case if the voltage of the dc source (consumer) 
also varies in accordance with the firing angle α.
In Figure 4.24, the angles α = 0 and π/4 correspond to the rectifier 
mode. When α = π/2, the average voltage on the dc side of the converter 
is Ud = 0, and the current Id stored in the reactor Ld remains constant in

Power electronics basics
view of our assumption that there are no power losses in the circuit com-
ponents. As a result, when α = π/2, reactive power is exchanged between 
the ac sources and the reactor Ld. When α = 2π/3 and π, the average voltage 
Ud reverses the sign (so as to oppose current Id). This corresponds to the 
inverter mode, that is, transfer of energy flux from the source Einv through 
the converter’s thyristor bridge to the ac grid. Figure 4.25 presents the grid 
voltage and inverter input current is on the grid side, which alternates 
slightly under the given assumptions. If we only consider the first har-
monic of this current, we can plot vector diagrams for different operating 
conditions (Figure 4.26). We see that a thyristor-based ac/dc converter with 
natural commutation may operate in two quadrants of the complex plane, 
corresponding to possible vector values of the first current harmonic.
It is evident from Figure 4.26 that, on switching to the inverter mode, 
α becomes greater than π/2. In that case, the thyristor converter produces 
alternating current from direct current and transfers the energy of a dc 
source with emf Einv to the grid. On the dc side (ahead of the reactor Ld), 
an inverter emf with the polarity opposite to the rectifier emf is formed.
4.3.2  Basic circuits operation in the inverting mode
4.3.2.1  Single-phase bridge inverter
An inverter bridge circuit is shown in Figure 4.27a. Suppose that thyris-
tors VS1 and VS3 are conducting. In that case, energy from the dc source 
Einv is sent through the transformer to the grid, because current is in the 
primary winding of transformer T opposes the voltage there uab. On the 
assumption that Ld = ∞, the voltage pulsation due to the difference in 
instantaneous voltages of the secondary transformer windings and the dc 
source will be applied to the reactor Ld.
To ensure inverter mode, the firing angle α must be greater than π/2. 
Therefore, in the circuit analysis, the control angle in the inverter mode 
is usually measured with respect to the natural commutation times in 
circuits with uncontrollable diodes (or to the angles α = 0, π, 2π, etc. in 
circuits with thyristors). The angle measured in this way is the lead angle 
β. The relation between β and α is as follows:

Suppose that thyristors VS2 and VS4 conduct in the interval from 0 to 
ϑ1. At time ϑ1, control pulses are sent to thyristors VS1 and VS3. At that 
moment, the thyristor anode is positive relative to the cathode (uab > 0), and 
so the thyristors are switched on. The secondary transformer winding is 
short-circuited. As a result, the short-circuit current isc appears, opposing 
the current through the thyristors. In other words, natural commutation 
begins. When commutation ends at time ϑ2 (as in the rectifier mode, the

switched off; the inverse voltage uab is applied to them. As a result, thyris-
tors VS2 and VS4 are able to recover their switching properties until uab 
changes sign (when the potential is greater at point b than at point a). The 
angle corresponding to this interval is the reserve angle δ. The relation

control pulses are sent to thyristors VS2 and VS4. As a result, commuta-
tion occurs and thyristors VS2 and VS4 are switched on, whereas thyris-
tors VS1 and VS3 are switched off. At that point, the processes periodically 
repeat.
It is evident from the form of the electromagnetic processes that they 
are largely similar to rectifier operation with a counter-emf. The main dif-
ference is that, in the inverter mode, the dc source is switched on with the 
opposite polarity to the thyristors and sends energy to the grid. Because 
the control pulses are sent to the thyristors with lead β relative to the com-
mutation times (with phase shift π), the current is sent to the grid passes 
through zero to positive values before the voltage passes through zero to 
negative values. Therefore, the first harmonic of the current is is ahead of 
the voltage uab by an angle of about β − γ/2 (Figure 4.27b).

The vector diagrams of the current is1 and voltage uab for the rectifier 
mode and the inverter mode are shown in Figure 4.26. In the rectifier mode, 
the first current harmonic lags the voltage by about α + γ/2. It is evident from 
the vector diagram that, in the inverter mode, the active current component 
Is1a opposes the grid voltage. This corresponds to the supply of active power 
to the grid. As in the rectifier mode, the reactive current Is1r lags the grid 
voltage by π/2. Hence, in both cases, the converter is a consumer of reactive 
power. The voltage on the dc side of the converter, known as the counter-
emf of the inverter, has pulsations, depending on the angles β and γ. The 
relations for these pulsations are the same as for the rectifier mode if α is 
replaced by β. The average voltage Ud is equal to the source voltage Einv.

The relation between the effective voltage Uab at the secondary trans-
former winding (which depends on the ac grid voltage and the transfor-
mation ratio) and the dc source voltage Ud is similar to that for the average 
rectified voltage of a rectifier. With no inverter load, we obtain

where U2 is the effective voltage at the secondary transformer winding.
The other relations are also similar to those in Section 4.2.2 for a 
resistive–inductive load of a single-phase rectifier with a continuous 
reactor current. In the case of discontinuous current id (Figure 4.27c), the 
analytical relations between the circuit parameters are considerably com-
plicated, as in the rectifier mode.
4.3.2.2  Three-phase bridge inverter
Figure 4.28 shows a thyristor-based three-phase bridge inverter, together 
with voltage and current waveforms in the case of ideally smoothed cur-
rent Id. In this circuit, as in a single-phase bridge inverter, control pulses 
are sent to thyristors with lead β relative to the times corresponding to the 
onset of thyristor commutation in an uncontrollable rectifier mode (α = 0, 
π, 2π, etc.). At those times, the line voltages of the secondary transformer 
windings pass through zero; in other words, the sinusoidal phase voltages 
ua, ub, and uc intersect. In the interval ϑ0–ϑ1, under the action of the source 
voltage Ud, the current Id flows through the thyristors VS1 and VS2 and 
the secondary transformer windings (phases a and c). The instantaneous 
counter-emf of the inverter (Figure 4.28b) is then equal to the difference of 
uc and ua (Zinov’ev, 2003).
At time ϑ1, determined by the lead angle β, which is specified by 
the inverter’s control signal, a control pulse is supplied to thyristor VS3. 
This thyristor is switched on. As a result, phases a and b of the second-
ary transformer windings are short-circuited. The corresponding short-
circuit current in those phases opposes the current iVS1 in thyristor VS1. In 
other words, commutation begins, analogous to the processes in a three-
phase rectifier bridge circuit (Section 4.2.2). The duration of commutation 
is γ. The voltage Ud in the commutation interval is calculated as uc minus 
the half-sum of voltages ua and ub. At the end of commutation, thyristors 
VS2 and VS3 will transmit current Id, whereas reverse voltage is applied to 
the thyristor VS1 for time δ.
Subsequently, the commutation of the thyristors occurs in accordance 
with their numbering (Figure 4.28b). For each thyristor, the conduction 
interval is 2π/3 + γ.
In both inverter mode and rectifier mode, commutation processes 
are responsible not only for periodic voltage dips on the dc side, but also 

219
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
for dips and surges in the ac grid voltage. For example, if we assume the 
equivalent phase inductance (including mainly the transformer’s scatter-
ing induction), connected directly to the outputs of the converter circuit in 
Figure 4.29a, the voltage at the outputs will take the waveform as shown 
in Figure 4.29b. The areas of the voltage dips and surges may be deter-

4.3.3  Active, reactive, and apparent powers of inverters
In considering the operating principle of the grid-tie inverter, we noted 
that the first harmonic of the nonsinusoidal grid current is shifted rela-
tive to the grid voltage by β − γ/2. As a result, the grid-tie inverter, which 
transmits the active power from the dc source to the grid, also draws reac-
tive power from the grid. We now consider the power balance in the sys-
tem consisting of the dc source, a single-phase inverter, and the grid. We 
assume unit efficiency of the inverter.
The active power consumed by the inverter from the dc source is

where Ud and Id are the source voltage and the average current at the 
inverter input, respectively.
The same power on the ac side (e.g., for a single-phase circuit) may be 
expressed by the familiar formula if we take into account that the phase 
shift between the first harmonic of the grid current and the grid voltage 
is about β − γ/2:

The harmonic composition of the primary current is analogous for a 
circuit operating in the rectifier mode (Section 4.2.3).
The nonsinusoidal form of the current may be assessed in terms of 
the distortion factor ν, which depends on the type of the circuit, the angle 
γ, the inductance Ls, the average current Id, and other factors (Rozanov, 
2009).

The potential for increasing the power factor by reducing β is con-
strained by the conditions for natural commutation of the thyristors: the 
angle δ = β − γ must always be greater than a specific value δmin. This will 
be discussed in greater detail later.
Note that if the inverter begins to operate with a lag β, rather than a 
lead β, it becomes a generator of reactive power, rather than a consumer. 
If we look again at Figure 4.26, we can isolate two regions on the plane 
of possible variation in the first harmonic vector of the grid current for a 
converter with natural commutation of the thyristors.

tion of reactive power from the grid.

reactive power from the grid.
4.3.4  Characteristics of inverters
In the analysis of normal inverter operation, it is important to know the 
inverter’s input and boundary characteristics.

223
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
The input characteristic is the dependence of the inverter’s average 
input voltage Ud on the average input current Id.
The inverter’s input voltage may be represented by the sum of two 
components, if we assume zero voltage drop at the thyristors and active 
impedances in the circuit. The first component is the no-load voltage Ud0, 
which is equal to the input voltage in instantaneous commutation (with 
γ = 0). The second component is the average voltage drop ΔU at the com-
mutation intervals. In contrast to rectifiers, for which the voltage drop is 
subtracted from the no-load voltage, these components are summed in 
grid-tie inverters

For inverter circuits, Ud0 and ΔU may be calculated from the rela-

depends on the converter’s input current: ΔU = f(Id). Therefore, the input 
characteristic of the grid-tie inverter takes the form

Figure 4.30 shows the input characteristics of a single-phase inverter 
obtained from Equation 4.64 for different β. We see that, in contrast to the 
characteristics of a rectifier (shown in the left half-plane of Figure 4.30), 
these characteristics are ascending: the voltage rises with the current. The 
rectifier characteristics may be regarded as the continuation of the invert-
er’s input characteristics with the same α and β.

An increase in the input voltage Ud is associated with an increase in 
the current Id and hence in the commutation angle γ. In other words, with 
the constant lead β, the thyristor cutoff angle δ declines. The minimum 
permissible value δmin is determined by the frequency of the grid voltage 
and the type of thyristors. It follows from Equation 4.64 that an increase 
in β is associated with an increase in the permissible commutation angle 
γ and, hence, in the current Id. The limiting permissible value of Id can be 
determined as follows.
Suppose that the circuit operates in the rectifier mode and that α is 
numerically equal to δmin. At this value of α, the rectifier characteristic 
is shown by the dashed line in the section of Figure 4.30, corresponding 
to the rectifier mode. We continue this characteristic in the section cor-
responding to the inverter mode. (It is again shown by a dashed line.) 
The intersection of this characteristic with the inverter’s input character-
istic will determine the inverter’s limiting possible operating conditions 
in terms of Id, for different β. For a single-phase inverter, these conditions 
correspond to the equation

As this characteristic indicates the inverter’s limiting possible operat-
ing conditions, it is known as the boundary characteristic.
The voltage at the converter’s dc buses when Id = 0 (with no load) is the 
same for the rectifier and inverter modes and depends on β (or α). This 
dependence is usually known as the control characteristic. The convert-
ers here considered are reversible. In other words, by adjusting the firing 
angles and reversing the polarity of the dc source, we may switch between 
the rectifier mode and the inverter mode. In the rectifier mode, energy is 
sent from the ac grid to the dc source (which is, thus, a consumer in this 
case). The reversibility of such converters is utilized in engineering, espe-
cially in dc drives.
4.4  Direct frequency converters (cycloconverters)
4.4.1  Thyristor-based ac–ac converters
Frequency conversion involves the production of alternating current of 
one frequency from alternating current of another frequency. Numerous 
power electronic frequency converters exist (Zinov’ev, 2003). In the pres-
ent section, we confine our attention to frequency converters based on 
thyristors with a natural commutation. Direct frequency converters—
converters with a single transformation of electrical energy—are some-
times also known as direct-coupled converters or cycloconverters.

225
Chapter four:  Line-commutated converters
The number of phases of the input and output voltages in direct-
coupled converters is of great importance, as it largely determines the 
converter structure. Note that multiphase direct-coupled converters are 
characterized by satisfactory performance and are widely used.
We will consider the operating principle of a direct-coupled converter 
with natural commutation for the example of a three-phase/single-phase 
circuit (Figure 4.31a). We can identify two groups of thyristors in the

converter: cathode group I (VS1, VS2, and VS3) and anode group II (VS4, 
VS5, and VS6). We assume that the load ZL is active. In converter operation, 
control pulses are sent alternately to the anode and cathode groups. When 
control pulses ig1–ig3, synchronized in frequency with the grid voltage, are 
sent successively to thyristors VS1, VS2, and VS3 in the cathode group, 
the system operates in the rectifier mode (as a center-tapped three-phase 
circuit), and a positive voltage half-wave relative to the transformer tap is 
formed at the load (Figure 4.31b). The control pulses are sent to the thy-
ristors with a phase shift α relative to the zeros of the grid’s line voltage. 
With the operation of thyristors VS4, VS5, and VS6 in the anode group, a 
negative voltage half-wave relative to the transformer tap is formed at the 
load. As a result of the cyclic operation of groups I and II, an alternative 
voltage with a fundamental frequency f2 lower than the grid frequency f1 
is created at the load.
The frequency f2 is determined by the time for which the thyristors 
of each group are conducting. By adjusting α, the output voltage may be 
regulated. To eliminate the constant component in the voltage at the load, 
the operating times of the anode and cathode groups must be equal. The 
output voltage with an active load is shown in Figure 4.31b. We see that 
the thyristors of the cathode group operate only after the voltage half-
wave formed by the anode group falls to zero and vice versa. That may 
be explained in that the thyristor is on until its current (in phase with the 
voltage, in the present case) falls to zero.
In the three-phase/single-phase circuit, commutation within each 
group (intragroup commutation) lasts for an interval of π/3. Therefore, 
if we disregard the commutation interval, we may write the following 
formula for the length of the output-voltage half-wave:

where n is the number of sinusoidal sections in the half-wave and π − 2π/3 
is the angle corresponding to zero tail of the output-voltage half-wave.
In general, when the number of grid phases is m, the frequencies of 
the output voltage f2 (fundamental frequency) and input voltage f1 are 
related as follows:

(4.67)
It is evident from Equation 4.67 that the frequency f2 of the output 
voltage may take only discrete values with variation in n (n = 1, 2, 3, …). 
For example, with m = 3 and f1 = 50 Hz, f2 may take values of 30, 23.5, 
16.7 Hz, and so on. To ensure smooth frequency variation, we need a 

227

ation of the next. In that case, the relation between f1 and f2 takes the form

With a resistive–inductive load, the moments at which the output-
voltage half-wave passes through zero do not correspond to zero load 
currents, as the load inductance delays the current relative to the volt-
age. To ensure that current is sent from the load to the grid in this case 
(which corresponds to recuperation, the return of the energy stored in 
the inductance to the grid), the appropriate thyristor group is switched to 
the inverter mode. For example, if group I operates in the rectifier mode 
at firing angle α, then, after a specific time, the control pulses are sent to 
the thyristors of group I with lead β relative to the grid voltage. That pulse 
sequence corresponds to the inverter mode of the thyristors. In this case, 
the dc source driving the inverted current is the load or, more precisely, the 
inductive component of the load. When the group-I thyristors are in the 
inverter mode, the energy stored in the inductance is returned to the grid 
and the load current falls to zero. Then the converter CS ensures a pause φ 
before the group-II thyristors begin to operate in the rectifier mode. Some 
of those thyristors switch to the inverter mode at a time specified by the 
control program. Subsequently, these processes repeat periodically.
A direct-coupled three-phase/single-phase converter can be based 
on two thyristor groups, each with a three-phase bridge configuration. 
Many direct-coupled circuits produce a three-phase voltage system at the 
output. Figure 4.32 shows some frequency converters with a three-phase

output. In Figure 4.32a, each phase consists of two groups in a three-phase 
center-tapped configuration; in Figure 4.32b, each phase consists of two 
groups in a three-phase bridge configuration.
Direct-coupled converters with natural thyristor commutation are 
relatively simple (at least in terms of the power circuit) and tend to be 
light and compact. A deficiency is low quality of the output voltage. For 
example, if each thyristor group operates with constant control angles 
α = β for a half-period, as in Figure 4.32, the output voltage will be seri-
ously distorted, with many higher harmonics. To reduce those harmonics 
and to ensure a sinusoidal output voltage, regulation of the control angles 
is required. In addition, the number of pulsations due to thyristor com-
mutation is increased, as in multiphase rectifier circuits.
4.4.2  Reduction of the output-voltage distortion
Usually, converters have an active–inductive load. For such converters, in 
the case of a continuous output voltage, operation of each thyristor group 
in both inverter and rectifier modes is required.
As the current conduction in the thyristor groups is unidirectional, 
the positive wave of the current is formed by group I and the negative 
wave by group II. Therefore, with an active–inductive load, the current 
will pass through both groups during each half-period of the output 
voltage. Figure 4.33, as an example, shows the first harmonics of the cur-
rent iL and voltage uL at the converter output, with a power factor cos φ 
in the case of an active–inductive load. The interval 0–ϑ1 corresponds 
to an inverter mode IIb, and the current passes through the thyristors in 
group II. Subsequently, the current begins to pass through the thyristors 
in group I, which operate in rectifier mode Ia during the interval ϑ1–π. At 
time ϑ = π, the thyristors in group I switch to inverter mode Ib and so on.
To prevent discontinuity on switching from the rectifier mode to the 
inverter mode, we employ consistent control of the thyristors.

In that case, the delivery of control pulses is such that the thyristors 
in group I may operate for a single half-period in the rectifier mode with 
α ≤ π/2, but in the next half-period in the inverter mode with α = π − β. 
Thyristor group II is prepared for the inverter mode in the first half-period 
and for the rectifier mode in the second half-period. In such control, con-
siderable balance currents may appear between the two groups. They may 
be reduced if α and β are selected so that the average voltages in the rec-
tifier and inverter modes are the same, that is, so that α = β. The balance 
current due to difference in the instantaneous group voltages is limited by 
a reactor in the circuit between the two groups.
The output voltage of such a converter is nonsinusoidal, in the general 
case. Its harmonic composition depends on factors such as the variation in 
α and β, the number of grid phases, and the frequency ratio of the input 
and output voltages.

It follows from Equation 4.69 that, if k = 1, α and β must be linear func-
tions of the time. (In that case, the arc cosine becomes a linear function 
of ϑ2 = ω2t, which varies from 0 to π.) Figure 4.34 illustrates the control 
principle more clearly.
In the first half-period (from ϑ2 = π/2 to ϑ2 = π, where ϑ2 = ω2t), group I 
is prepared for the rectifier mode, and the control pulses are sent to the 
thyristors of this group at firing angle α, which varies from 0 to α − π/2. 
(Note that the output-voltage half-wave passes through a maximum at 
ϑ2 = π/2 and through zero at ϑ2 = 0.) In Figure 4.33, we show the notation 
for the intervals of thyristor-group operation in the rectifier and inverter 
modes: Ia and Ib correspond, respectively, to operation of group I in the 
rectifier and inverter modes during the interval π/2–π. At this time, the 
thyristors in group II are prepared for the rectifier mode, with β = 0−π/2. 
Likewise, IIa and IIb correspond, respectively, to operation of group II in 
the rectifier and inverter modes.
In such control, the content of higher harmonics in the output volt-
age is considerably reduced, as it becomes close to sinusoidal, with some 
ripple. The ripple diminishes with an increase in the frequency and in the 
number of grid phases. With an increase in the number of phases (pulsa-
tions) in the output voltage, we note a reduction not only in the higher 
harmonics of the output voltage, but also in the input current of the fre-
quency converter. Figure 4.35 shows output voltage waveforms for 6 and 
12-pulse converters with arc cosine control.

Power electronics basics
Note that the power factor of a direct frequency converter is deter-
mined not only by the power factor of the load, but also by the ratio of the 
input and output voltages. With a decrease in the output voltage, the con-
trol angles α and β increase, with a consequent decrease in the converter’s 
input power factor. Low input power factor is one of the deficiencies of 
direct frequency converters with natural thyristor commutation.

function of an electronic circuit breaker is to switch an ac circuit off and 
on. We now consider regulators based on thyristors with natural commu-
tation in the case of an ac grid.
A single-phase circuit with antiparallel thyristors is shown in Figure 
4.36a. This is the basic circuit for thyristor regulators with natural com-
mutation. Obviously, symmetric thyristors may take the place of two 
opposed thyristors.
We assume that the regulator has an active load. That corresponds to 
the connection of a resistor RL to the regulator input. The other circuit com-
ponents, including thyristors, are assumed to be ideal. In other words, they 
correspond to the assumptions stated earlier. The thyristors are switched 
on by the supply of control pulses ig1 and ig2 to the thyristors’ control elec-
trodes. The CS forms the pulses synchronously with the grid voltage 
us = uab(ϑ), in a phase corresponding to the firing angle α (Figure 4.36b).
When thyristor VS1 is turned on at time ϑ1 = α, the input voltage 
is applied to load resistance RL. The current iL in the active-load circuit 
reproduces the form of voltage us. When it falls to zero, thyristor VS1 is 
switched off. At time ϑ1 = π + α, thyristor VS2 is switched on, and the pro-
cesses repeat periodically if α = const. We can write the following depen-
dence of the effective output voltage UL.eff on the firing angle α in the case 
of an active load

where Uab is the effective input voltage of the regulator, ϑ = ωt, and ω is 
the angular frequency of the grid voltage.
It is evident from Figure 4.36 that adjustment of α from 0 to π permits 
regulation of the average voltage (and hence also the effective voltage) 
from the maximum value (equal to the corresponding input voltage) to 
zero.

circuit has a significant drawback. Because the current flows through 
three semiconductor components (two diodes and a thyristor) in each 
half-period, the voltage drop will increase, according to the actual volt–
ampere characteristics of these components, and hence the power losses 
will increase. That limits the use of this design at low voltages and low 
load currents.
The performance of a regulator is largely determined by its control 
characteristic, which relates the effective output voltage UL.eff and the thy-
ristor firing angle α. This characteristic depends significantly on the type 
of load. In the present case, active, active–inductive, and inductive loads 
are significant. We will consider each in turn.
4.5.1.1  Operation with active load
The dependence of the effective output voltage on the firing angle is 
described by Equation 4.70. It follows from the regulator operating prin-
ciple that the output voltage uL(ϑ) is nonsinusoidal, and the severity of the 
higher harmonics depends greatly on α. Figure 4.38 shows the harmonic 
content as a function of the firing angle α for an active load.
Obviously, an increase in α not only distorts the load current and volt-
age, but also impairs the input power factor χ, which can be determined

from the series expansion of the current and formulas for the active and total 
power. The dependence of χ on α for an active load is shown in Figure 4.39.
4.5.1.2  Operation with resistive–inductive load
We assume that the load is a resistor RL and a reactor (inductance LL) in 
series. Turning on any of the thyristors in Figure 4.36a will initiate a tran-
sient process in the system consisting of the input-voltage source and the

In case (3), there is no transient component iL.tr. Steady-state conditions 
begin as soon as the thyristor is turned on. In case (2), the transient com-
ponent extends the first half-wave of the transient process to a duration 
greater than π. The corresponding conditions in the regulator are such 
that the second thyristor VS2 will not be turned on at the angle α. Instead, 
it will be shunted by the first thyristor, which continues to conduct dur-
ing the second half-period. As a result, regulator operation is asymmetric. 
That leads to loss of voltage quality and unbalanced thyristor load. These 
problems may be eliminated by ensuring regulator operation with firing 
angles α ≥ φL.
4.5.1.3  Operation with inductive load
If we assume zero active-power losses in the circuit and in the load, reg-
ulator operation with an inductive load differs from operation with an 
active–inductive load, in that there is no damping of the free component. 
In symbolic form, the time constant τ = LL/RL → ∞.
Figure 4.40c shows the equivalent inductance Xeq as a function of α. 
We see that a regulator with input inductance L0 may be regarded as the 
controllable inductance of the electronic CS in the range from X0 = ωL0 to ∞.

236
Power electronics basics
This control method is widely used in the power industry for reactive-
power compensation in devices consisting of parallel capacitor groups 
and a resistor antiparallel thyristor.
4.5.2  Three-phase ac voltage regulators
Figure 4.41 shows two characteristic designs for three-phase regulators: 
with a star configuration of the load and an isolated neutral and with 
a delta configuration. Switching from a single-phase system to a three-
phase system complicates the topology and hence the analysis of the pro-
cesses in the regulator. Some general laws for the operation of three-phase 
systems may be obtained for individual control-angle ranges (Williams, 
1987). Thus, in the star configuration (Figure 4.41a) with an isolated neu-
tral, three different operational modes of the regulator’s thyristors may 
occur in the case of an active load. We will assume that control pulses are 
supplied at intervals of π/3 to the thyristors, in accordance with the num-
bering in Figure 4.41a. The origin ϑ = 0 is the moment at which the phase 
voltage passes through zero to positive values. The three thyristor modes 
are as follows.

I.	When 0 ≤ α ≤ π/3, only two thyristors are on in some intervals, 
whereas three thyristors are on in others: for example, VS5 and VS6; 
then VS5, VS6, and VS1; and so on.
	
II.	When π/3 ≤ α ≤ π/2, two thyristors are always on: for example, VS5 
and VS6 and then VS1 and VS6.
	 III.	When π/2 ≤ α ≤ 5π/6, there are alternating periods in which two 
thyristors are on and all the thyristors are off. For example, there 
may be current flow through thyristors VS1 and VS6, but then they 
are turned off and a period follows in which all the thyristors are off. 
Then VS2 and VS1 are turned on and so on.
It is evident from these examples that, even for the simplest case of an 
active load, the processes in the three-phase regulator are considerably

more complicated than those in a single-phase regulator. That is also the 
case for the delta configuration (Figure 4.41b). Note that the regulators 
with an active–inductive load are most common in practice. In that case, 
the processes are even more complex, and it is difficult to obtain formulas 
suitable for practical use. We may note that single-phase regulators are 
characterized by better spectral composition of the output voltage. In par-
ticular, in the delta configuration, current harmonics that are multiples of 
three do not reach the grid.
To reduce the distortion of the output voltage and output current and 
also to increase the input power factor χ, voltage stabilization may expedi-
ently be based on a thyristor regulator in combination with an autotrans-
former. Figure 4.42a shows a simplified voltage stabilizer in which the 
connection to the transformer winding is switched by means of thyristors 
VS1–VS4. In this system, the output voltage is stabilized by adjusting the 
switching times. In the positive half-period of the input voltage, thyristor 
VS1 or VS2 may be on; in the negative half-period, thyristor VS3 or VS4

may be on. The commutation of the thyristors in this system depends on 
the transformer voltage. To ensure natural commutation, switching to the 
terminals at high potential is required. For example, in the positive half-
wave of the output voltage, first thyristor VS2 and then thyristor VS1 will 
be turned on. In this case, when thyristor VS1 is turned on, a short-circuit 
is formed. The short-circuit current opposes the load current at thyristor 
VS2. As a result, thyristor VS2 is turned off, and current begins to flow 
through thyristor VS1. In this system, the effective value of the output 
voltage may be regulated by adjusting the switching times of the thyris-
tors. The output voltage of the stabilizer with an active load is shown in 
Figure 4.42b.
With an active–inductive load, the control of the thyristors is more 
complicated, because the load current lags the voltage at the transformer 
winding, and the thyristors are switched off when the load current passes 
through zero.

Conversion from direct current 
to direct current
5.1  Introduction: Continuous stabilizers
The conversion of direct current into direct current is intended to improve 
the power from a dc source and to match the voltage of the source and the 
consumers. Often, such conversion results in galvanic uncoupling of the 
source and the load.
The purpose of dc voltage converters is not only the conversion of 
direct current, but also the regulation or stabilization of the voltage (or 
current) in the load. Converters used only for stabilization are known as 
stabilizers. We may distinguish between two types of dc converters: con-
tinuous converters and pulsed converters.
Continuous converters stabilize the voltage in a dc circuit with varia-
tion in the source or load voltage. Continuous converters employ transis-
tors operating in the active region of the output volt–ampere characteristic.
In Figure 5.1a, we show the circuit diagram of a continuous regulator 
with the transistor and load in series. The voltage at the load is

where Usw⋅sat is the voltage at the transistor in the case of saturation.
In converter operation, the voltage at the load is stabilized: uout = Ust. 
The current i0 = iout = Ust/Rlo. The control system (CS), which is based on 
negative feedback with respect to the output voltage, maintains the collec-
tor current at i0 = Ust/Rlo. With an increase in voltage E, the voltage at the 
transistor usw = E – Ust increases.
The excess energy from source E is scattered to the transistor; the 
power loss in the transistor is Ptr = usw ⋅ i0.
Neglecting the energy consumption in the operation of the CS, we 
may write the converter efficiency in the form

When E = Emin, the transistor operates in the cutoff mode; the collec-
tor current iC = 0. Due to the CS, characterized by negative feedback with 
respect to the output voltage, the load voltage is stabilized: uout = Ust. With 
an increase in E, the voltage uR = E – Ust is applied to the ballast resistor 
Rb; the current is i0 = uR/Rb. The current through the transistor is also 
increased: isw = i0 − iout = i0 − Ust/Rlo; the voltage at the transistor is usw = Ust.

The efficiency of the stabilizer with a parallel transistor (Figure 5.1b) 
is less than that of a stabilizer with the transistor in series (Figure 5.1a). 
However, the losses in the transistor may be less.
The low efficiency of the continuous stabilizers limits their use to 
devices whose power is no more than a few watts. Continuous stabilizers 
and the associated CS are produced in the form of integrated microcircuits.
At present, only pulsed converters are used at high power. In such 
devices, the regulation and stabilization of the output voltage (or current) 
may be ensured by adjusting (modulating) the width of the rectangular

pulses. The use of switched semiconductor devices considerably increases 
the converter efficiency and reduces the mass and size of the unit.
The literature contains an enormous variety of circuit designs for 
pulsed dc voltage converters. In what follows, we consider the most com-
mon types.
Pulsed dc voltage converters without transformers are sometimes 
known as dc voltage regulators.
5.2  Basic dc voltage regulators
5.2.1  Step-down dc/dc converter
In the step-down (or buck) dc/dc converter, also known as a voltage regu-
lator of the first kind, the transistor is in series with the source E and the 
load (Polikarpov and Sergienko, 1989; Ericson and Maksimovich, 2001; 
Mohan et al., 2003; Rashid, 2004; Meleshin, 2006).
In Figure 5.2, we show the circuit diagram, together with correspond-
ing time diagrams. The circuit includes a smoothing LC filter. (In some

cases, the capacitor C is omitted.) When the transistor is switched on 
for interval t1–t2 (pulse length Tp), voltage us = E is formed at the output, 
whereas voltage uL = E – uвых > 0 is applied to choke L. This is accompa-
nied by an increase in the current i0 = iL through the source E, the transis-
tor, and choke L; the energy stored in the choke increases.
At time t2, the transistor is switched off. The current in the choke L 
passes through the diode. The load voltage uL = −uout < 0 is applied to the 
choke. The choke current iL = id declines, and the energy stored in the 
choke declines. The voltage us = 0; no current is drawn from the source: 
i0 = 0. At time t1 + Tsw, the transistor is switched on again, and the process 
is repeated. (The repetition period Tsw = 1/fsw, where fsw is the switching 
frequency.)

In Figure 5.2d, we show the time diagrams with discontinuous cur-
rent. At time t1, the transistor is switched on, and us = E. The current i0 = iL 
rises, and the energy stored in the choke increases. When the transistor 
is switched off, at time t2, the choke current passes though the diode and 
declines to zero at time t3; the diode is closed. When the choke current is 
zero, us = uout. The part of us due to interruption of the choke current is 
shaded in Figure 5.2d. The appearance of this component increases the 
mean output voltage; the converter characteristic in the case of discon-
tinuous current falls sharply.
In the case of discontinuous current, the power component of the con-
verter remains operational. However, when developing feedback loops for 
the CS, the role of discontinuous current must be taken into account.

put voltage may be written in the form

Hence, the switching frequency must be increased in order to reduce 
the power consumption in the filter’s reactive elements. The inductance 
of choke L is usually selected so that the converter operates solely with 
continuous current.
With a decrease in γ, the voltage Uout increases. At the same time, how-
ever, its harmonic composition deteriorates. The ratio of the maximum 
and mean transistor currents is 1/γ. At small γ, this fact must be taken into 
account in transistor selection. Consequently, the use of step-down dc/ dc 
converters is inexpedient for considerable reduction in the dc voltage.
At E up to 300–350 V, regulators are based on MOS transistors. If the 
switching frequency is increased to 100 kHz, the power consumption in 
the reactive elements may be reduced. At higher voltages, the regulators 
may be based on IGBTs, with switching frequencies of 20 kHz or more.
The benefit of the step-down dc/dc converter is the continuity of the 
current supplied to the input of the output filter. Consequently, the param-
eters of the filter’s reactive elements are minimal.
5.2.2  Step-up dc/dc converter
In the step-up (or boost) dc/dc converter, also known as a voltage regula-
tor of the second kind, the choke L is in series with the source L. The corre-
sponding circuit diagram is shown in Figure 5.3a, whereas time diagrams 
with continuous choke current are shown in Figure 5.3b.
When the converter is connected to source E with no control pulses 
at the transistor, capacitor C is charged through choke L and the diode to

a voltage greater than E. The regulator operates with a mean load voltage 
Uout > E.
In steady conditions, when the transistor is switched on at time t1, 
the supply voltage is applied to the choke: uL = E. Energy is supplied to the 
choke, and the current iL = i0 = iT increases. The diode is closed, and the load 
is disconnected from the source. Then the capacitor C supplies energy to 
the load.
When the transistor is switched off, at time t2, the diode is opened, and 
voltage uL = E – uout is applied to the choke; the current iL = i0 = id declines.

With discontinuous current, when the transistor is off, the choke cur-
rent flows through the diode. However, the diode closes when iL = 0, cor-
responding to zero energy stored in the choke. The load is connected to 
the capacitor, as in the operating interval t1–t2, when the transistor current 
flows. As a result, the load voltage rises, while the characteristic declines 
sharply (Figure 5.3c). With discontinuous current, the power component 
of the converter remains operative. However, the role of discontinuous 
current must be taken into account in developing the feedback loops for 
the CS. In near-idling conditions, the converter is inoperative on account 
of the unlimited growth of the output voltage with any value of γ. That 
may result in failure of the semiconductor devices and the load.
In basic operation, with continuous choke current, the pulsations of 
the output voltage are described as follows:

With an increase in Uout/E, γ increases, and the quality of the output 
voltage is impaired. The ratio of the maximum and mean diode currents 
is 1/(1 − γ); at large γ, that must be taken into account in diode selection. 
Accordingly, the use of a step-up dc/dc converter to considerably increase 
a dc voltage is inexpedient.

248
Power electronics basics
A benefit of the step-up dc/dc converter is the absence of discontinui-
ties in the current consumed from the source E, with continuous choke 
current. That permits a decrease in the filter capacitance at the converter 
input or even its elimination. A deficiency is the discontinuity of the cur-
rent supplied to the input of the output filter.
5.2.3  Inverting regulator
The inverting regulator—also known as a regulator of the third kind or 
a buck–boost converter—is shown in Figure 5.4a. It is named as inverting 
regulator because the source and load voltages are of opposite polarity. A 
transistor is in series with the source E, whereas the transistor current and 
source current are the same: iT = i0. In Figure 5.4b, we show time diagrams 
in basic operation, with continuous choke current.
At time t1, when the transistor is turned on, the supply current flows 
through the transistor and the choke. The supply voltage is applied to 
the choke: uL = E. Energy is stored in the choke, and the current iL = i0 = iT

rises. The diode is switched off, the load is disconnected from the source, 
and capacitor C sends energy to the load.
At time t2, when the transistor is turned off, the diode is turned on 
as a result of the choke’s self-induction voltage. The voltage uL = −uout is 
applied to the choke. The choke loses energy, and the current iL = id = iout 
declines.

The family of converter characteristics is shown in Figure 5.4c. The 
right side corresponds to the basic mode of converter operation, with con-
tinuous choke current. In that case, the characteristics are hard; the losses 
in the converter are due to inclination of the characteristics. The dashed

continuous current must be taken into account in developing feedback

The deterioration of the output voltage as Uout/E increases, meaning 
that the converter cannot effectively be used to produce a considerable 
increase in the dc voltage.
A benefit of the inverting regulator is that the output voltages higher 
or lower than the supply voltage may be obtained.
Deficiencies include the discontinuity of the current drawn from the 
source at low loads and the discontinuity of the current supplied to the 
input of the output filter. These deficiencies may be eliminated by topo-
logical adjustments on the basis of cascade connection of such circuits. To 
this end, we use a new circuit design, known as the C´ uk converter.
5.2.4  The C´ uk converter
In Figure 5.5, we show the circuit diagram of the C´ uk converter (Mohan 
et al., 2003; Rozanov, 2007), along with time diagrams. At time t1, when 
the transistor is switched off, voltage uL1 = E is applied to choke L1 and the 
supply voltage i0 increases. The negative voltage accumulated at capacitor

C1 is applied to the anode of the diode, which closes. Capacitor C1 is con-
nected to the input of the LC filter, is discharged by current iL2, and sends 
energy to the filter and the load.
At time t2, the transistor is switched on. Choke current L1 passes 
through the capacitor C1 and the diode; the energy and voltage at the 
capacitor increase. The zero voltage of the open diode is applied to the fil-
ter input, and the current of choke L2 also passes through the diode. At the 
end of the interval Tf, the capacitor voltage is restored: uC1(t1 + Tf) = uC1(t1).

the dashed curve in Figure 5.4c. Discontinuous current is observed with 
interruptions in the current both at choke L1 and at choke L2. The corre-
sponding formulas may be found in Polikarpov and Sergienko (1989). In 
near-idling conditions, the converter is inoperative.

The C´ uk converter has significant benefits.
•	 It consumes continuous current from the source E, like a step-up dc/
dc converter.
•	 Continuous current is supplied to the filter input, as in the step-
down dc/dc converter.
In one version of the C´ uk converter, the two chokes share a single coil 
and are magnetically coupled. That permits considerable reduction in the 
pulsations of the current i0 or the output voltage.
5.2.5  Regulators with voltage multiplication
Voltage multiplication is possible in direct-current regulators (Polikarpov 
and Sergienko, 1989). That considerably increases the ratio of the output 
voltage and the supply voltage, without the need for transformers. Of the 
various options, we consider that in Figure 5.6.

252
Power electronics basics
When the transistor is switched on, energy accumulates in choke L0; 
diodes D1, D2, and D3 are closed; and the energy from capacitors C0-1 and 
C0-2 is transmitted to the cells consisting of L-shaped segments C1–L1, 
C2–L2, and C3–L3.
When the transistor is switched off, current i0 from choke L0 passes 
through diode D3; the choke energy is transmitted to capacitors C0-1 and 
C0-2. Choke L3 sends energy to capacitors C3-1 and C3-2 through diodes 
D2–D3; choke L2 sends energy to capacitors C2-1 and C2-2 through diodes 
D1–D2; and choke L1 sends energy to capacitor C1 through diode D1. In 
this interval, capacitors C3-1–C3-2 and C2-1–C2-2 are connected in paral-
lel through the conducting diodes, whereas chokes L1, L2, and L3 are in 
series. The mean current in the chokes is equal to the load current Iout.
The number of cells of the same type within the converter may be 
increased or decreased. If we neglect the losses in the converter, we may 
determine the mean output voltage of the converter in the form

As already noted, the losses at reactive elements may be reduced by 
increasing the switching frequency. However, with an increase in the fre-
quency, the switching losses in the semiconductor devices will increase. 
Those losses may be reduced by using resonant converters and various 
types of zero-switching circuits.
5.3  dc voltage regulators with transformer 
uncoupling of the input and output circuits
When there is a considerable difference between the source voltage and the 
output voltage at the load, we use dc voltage regulators with built-in trans-
formers (Polikarpov and Sergienko, 1989; Ericson and Maksimovich, 2001; 
Rashid, 2004; Rossetti, 2005; Rozanov, 2007). In such converters, the trans-
formers operate at high frequency, so as to reduce the power consumption 
at the reactive components and the overall size and mass of the system. 
Transformers permit galvanic uncoupling of the input and output circuits 
and multiplication of the output circuits so as to produce higher voltages. 
In what follows, we consider only a few of many such devices that exist.
At power up to 1 kW, half-cycle dc voltage converters (flyback and 
forward converters) are often used. At higher power, full-cycle converters 
(push–pull converters) are mainly employed.
5.3.1  Flyback converter
In Figure 5.7a, we show the circuit diagram of a flyback converter, char-
acterized by energy transfer during the intervals when the transistor is 
off; time diagrams of the currents through the switches are shown in 
Figure 5.7b.
The flyback converter is based on a dc inverting regulator (Section 
5.2.3). In split choke L, the turn ratio in the windings is k = w2/w1. When 
the windings are turned on in accordance with Figure 5.7a, the load volt-
age is positive.

Power electronics basics
When the transistor is turned on at time t1, energy accumulates in the 
core of the split choke; there is an accompanying increase in the transistor 
current, which is equal to the source current i0. The voltage induced in the 
second winding w2 closes the diode, and capacitor C sends its accumu-
lated energy to the load.
When the transistor is turned off at time t2, the current flow in winding 
w1 stops. The energy stored in the core is sent to the load and replenishes 
the energy of capacitor C; the diode current id falls. Energy is transmitted 
to the load in the dead time when the transistor is off.
If the standard values of the components on the secondary side (C and 
Rlo) are recalculated for the primary side and the windings are combined, 
the converter will be identical to an inverting regulator. All the relations 
and characteristics given in Section 5.3 apply in those conditions. The 
family of characteristics takes the form as shown in Figure 5.4c; the values 
of Uout/E must be multiplied by k = w2/w1.

output voltage of the converter in the form

In the interval t1–t2, the current flows only in winding w1; during the 
remainder of the period, the current flows only in winding w2. The core is 
magnetized by the whole load current.

where L is the inductance of winding w1.
In idling (zero load), the converter is inoperative.
The flyback converter has the same deficiency as the inverting regula-
tor: the source current i0 and the current id sent to the load circuit (Rlo – C) 
are discontinuous. The following problems may also be noted.
	
1.	For the best converter operation, the magnetic coupling between the 
windings should be as large as possible. To that end, appropriate 
technological and design measures are adopted.
	
2.	The core of the split choke operates over an asymmetric portion of 
the hysteresis loop and acts as an energy store, which increases the 
consumption at the magnetic elements.
	
3.	In Figure 5.7a, there are no circuits for removing the energy from the 
choke’s scattering inductance. That may lead to impermissible volt-
age surges at the transistor.

255
Chapter five:  Conversion from direct current to direct current
To eliminate the latter problem, various circuit designs are employed; 
one is shown in Figure 5.8. In this case, a recuperative circuit consisting of 
winding w3 and diode D2 is included. Windings w1 and w3 have the same 
number of turns; their magnetic coupling is strong.
In interval t1–t2, the transistor is on; diodes D1 and D2 are closed by 
the voltages at windings w2 and w3. The structure of the circuit’s conduct-
ing section is as in Figure 5.7a. When the transistor is switched off, the 
choke current is recuperated to source E and then falls to zero as the diode 
current rises to a steady value. The voltage at the transistor’s collector is 
no more than 2E. The operating conditions of the recuperative circuit limit

5.3.2  Forward converter
In Figure 5.9, we show a possible circuit diagram for a forward converter, 
in which the energy is transmitted to the load during the pulse length Tp.
When the transistor is switched on, the voltage E is applied to the 
winding w1. The corresponding voltage induced in secondary winding 
w2 turns on the diode D1. Hence, the voltage kE is applied to the input of 
filter LfC. Energy is stored in the filter components and in the magnetic 
field of the transformer core and also transmitted to the load.
When the transistor is switched off, diode D2 is opened. The energy 
stored in the filter components sustains the current flow in the load. Diode 
D1 is closed. The energy stored in the transformer core is recuperated to 
source E through winding w3 and diode D3.

The operation of the forward converter is largely analogous to that of 
the step-down dc/dc converter (Section 5.2.1); the difference is the pres-
ence of the transformer.
In the case of windings with the maximum possible magnetic cou-
pling, the maximum voltage at the collector is 2E. The transformer oper-
ates in the asymmetric mode, without the accumulation of the magnetic 
flux in the core. When the transistor is switched off, there is a recuperation 
stage; the magnetic flux falls to its initial value. To that end, we must select 
the transformation ratio as follows:

•	 Reduced output-voltage pulsations
•	 A shorter magnetic-flux trajectory in converter operation
•	 The possibility of operating without a load (idling)

Shortcomings of the forward converter relative to the flyback con-
verter are as follows:
•	 A more complex circuit design
•	 A limited range of output voltage
Accordingly, the flyback converter is preferable in compact systems. 
In that case, problems arise when the load is switched off, and the output-
voltage pulsations are more pronounced.
In these half-cycle converter circuits (Figures 5.8 and 5.9), we may 
introduce additional secondary uncoupled windings with uncontrolled 
rectifiers, to which various consumers may be connected. The output volt-
ages of the converter may be different in that case.
On the basis of half-cycle dc voltage converters, we may create circuits 
with voltage multiplication. The principles are the same as in Section 5.2.5.
5.3.3  Push–pull converters
Half-cycle dc voltage converters may be used when power up to 1 kW is 
required. At larger load power, full-cycle dc voltage converters (push–pull 
converters) have obvious benefits.
Practically, all push–pull converters include an intermediate ac ele-
ment and consist of an inverter and an uncontrolled full-wave rectifier. 
The corresponding circuit diagram is shown in Figure 5.10. Single-phase 
autonomous voltage inverters are often used (Section 6.1).
The inverter converts dc to ac. A typical inverter output voltage up is 
shown in Figure 5.10. The voltage up consists of rectangular pulses with 
an alternating polarity; the pulses repeat at the cycle duration Tcy. The 
transformer alters the magnitude of the voltage up, and the uncontrolled

rectifier converts the ac voltage to the dc voltage uout. In the converter, 
Uout/E is regulated by means of the CS, which adjusts the relative pulse 
width Tp/Tcy of the inverter’s output voltage.
In contrast to half-cycle converters, the transformer in a full-cycle con-
verter operates symmetrically, without bias.
The selection of the inverter and rectifier circuits in the converter 
largely depends on the primary and secondary voltages; the goal is to 
maximize the efficiency. At low source voltage E (<50 V), null voltage-
inverter circuits are preferable (Section 6.1), as the ratio of the voltage 
losses at the conducting transistors to the inverter’s output voltage is half 
as large. At large E, half-bridge and bridge circuits are employed.
At low output voltage, the rectifier is based on a center-tapped circuit. 
In other cases, bridge rectification circuits are also possible.
In full-cycle dc voltage converters, the minimum number of control-
lable switches is two, as against one for half-cycle converters (Sections 
5.3.1 and 5.3.2).
The design principles for single-phase voltage inverters are outlined 
in Chapter 6. However, inverter operation in full-cycle dc voltage convert-
ers presents certain distinctive features. Therefore, we will consider here a 
typical converter circuit with a low source voltage E (Figure 5.11).
The circuit consists of a single-phase voltage inverter based on tran-
sistors VT1 and VT2 in a null circuit, a transformer with transformation 
ratio k, and an uncontrolled bridge rectifier with an output LC filter. 
Time diagrams are shown in Figure 5.11b. The losses in the circuit, the 
magnetizing current, and the scattering induction of the transformer are

neglected in the analysis. The current and voltage at the load are assumed 
to be ideally smooth.
In the interval t1–t2, transistor VT1 is switched on; and the voltage 
u1 = E gives rise to voltage u2 = kE in the secondary winding. This voltage 
is sent through the diodes of the uncontrolled rectifier to the input of the 
LC filter; the energy in the filter’s reactive components increases. The cur-
rent i2 = Iout, while i0 = kIout. To closed transistor VT2, the sum of the supply 
voltage and u1 is applied; Usw⋅max = 2E.
In the interval t2–t3, both transistors are off; the voltage u1 = u2 = 0. The 
filter’s choke current flows through the rectifier diodes; i2 = i1 = 0. The fil-
ter’s reactive components send energy to the load.
In the interval t3–t4, transistor VT2 is conducting; u1 = −E and u2 = −kE. 
This voltage is rectified and sent to the filter input; the energy in the filter’s 
reactive components increases. In the last interval t4 – (t1 + Tsw), both tran-
sistors are turned off; the processes are analogous to those in interval t2–t3.
If we neglect the losses in the converter, we may determine the mean 
output voltage of the converter in the form

where the fill factor γ = 2Tp/Tsw. The operation of the push–pull dc voltage 
converter largely resembles that of a step-down dc/dc converter (Section 
5.2.1); the differences are the presence of a transformer and the fact that 
the processes in the filter and the load occur at twice the switching fre-
quency of each of the transistors (fsw = 1/Tsw).
If we take account of the transformer’s scattering inductance, the 
energy stored in the scattered inductance prevents the transistor from 
being switched off and results in voltage surges, which may lead to tran-
sistor failure. To derive energy from winding w1-1, snubber C1–VD1–R1 
is connected to transistor VT1. (A similar structure is connected to tran-
sistor VT2.) When the transistor VT1 is turned on, the winding current 
through diode VD1 charges the capacitor C1, and the scattering energy is 
transmitted to the capacitor. When the winding current falls to zero, the 
diode is switched off, and the capacitor retains the accumulated energy. 
When transistor VT1 is again turned on, the capacitor discharges through 
resistor R1 and transistor VT1, which are in series. The energy stored in 
the capacitor is dispersed.
Asymmetry in the voltages applied to the transformer windings may 
lead to unbounded growth in the magnetizing current and saturation of 
the transformer. To prevent this, appropriate feedback circuits are intro-
duced in the control circuit.
In Figure 5.11a, we may introduce additional uncoupled secondary 
windings with uncontrolled rectifiers, to which different consumers may 
be connected. The voltages at the terminals of such converters may be 

260
Power electronics basics
different. Note that the feedback circuit for stabilizing the output volt-
age will only apply to a single terminal. Whether the output voltage is 
switched off at the other terminals will depend on the hardness of the 
characteristic for the relevant channels.
5.4  Multiquadrant direct-current converters
The dc voltage converters considered in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 are able to 
create current and voltage of the same polarity at the output. In some 
applications, we need to create dc sources with a variable polarity. If the 
polarity of the voltage Uout and current Iout is the same, we are dealing 
with energy transfer from the source E to the converter output. If the 
voltage Uout and current Iout are of opposite polarity, energy from the con-
verter output is returned (recuperated) to the source. When a dc machine 
is connected to the converter in this case, we are dealing with recupera-
tive braking.
When dc voltage converters are able to change the polarity of the volt-
age and/or current, they are said to be multiquadrant converters, as their 
family of characteristics lies in two or four quadrants of the Cartesian 
coordinate system (Trzynadlowski, 1998). As a rule, multiquadrant dc con-
verters are based on dc voltage regulators (Section 5.2).
5.4.1  Two-quadrant converter
In Figure 5.12a, we show the circuit diagram of a two-quadrant dc con-
verter. The load considered is a dc motor, which is replaced by an equiva-
lent circuit consisting of the motor’s counteremf Em, its resistance Rm, and 
its inductance Lm.
When an electrical machine operates in the motor mode, only transis-
tor VT1 operates in the converter, and transistor VT2 is always off. When 
transistor VT1 is turned on, it connects source E to the motor; motor cur-
rent iout = i0 passes through VT1. When transistor VT1 is turned off, the 
motor current passes through diode VD2, and the voltage applied to the 
motor is zero. It is readily evident that the conducting section of the circuit 
corresponds to a step-down dc/dc converter (Section 5.2.1). In that case, 
neglecting the losses, we write the output voltage in the form
	
U
E T

sw

(5.32)
In recuperative braking, the motor continues to turn, and the polar-
ity Em is unchanged. However, on switching to the generator mode, the 
polarity of current iout will be the opposite of that in Figure 5.12a. In this 

261
Chapter five:  Conversion from direct current to direct current
mode, no control pulses are sent to transistor VT1. When transistor VT2 is 
off, current flows through diode VD1; the polarity of current i0 is reversed, 
and the motor energy is recuperated to source E. When transistor VT2 is 
turned on, it transmits the current iout. Operation in the recuperation mode 
corresponds to a step-up dc/dc converter (Section 5.2.2), if we assume that 
the energy source is the motor’s counteremf Em.
5.4.2  Four-quadrant converter
The rotation of a dc electrical machine may be reversed by means of a 
four-quadrant dc converter (Figure 5.12b).
The converter may operate in four modes.
Quadrant I. The electrical machine operates in the motor mode, with 
forward rotation. An output-voltage pulse is formed at the motor input 
when transistors VT1 and VT2 are switched on simultaneously, and 
uout = E. To create an inactive interval, it is sufficient to switch off one of 
the transistors—say, VT2. Then the motor current flows through VT1 and 
diode VD3; Uout = 0 and i0 = 0. In this quadrant, the converter resembles a 
step-down dc/dc converter: Uout = γE.
Quadrant II. The motor turns in the same direction, but with recupera-
tive braking. Consequently, the machine operates in the generative mode, 
and the current iout is reversed. Two modes alternate in the converter.
•	 An interval of length γTsw, in which all the transistors are on; current 
passes through diodes VD1 and VD2; and the motor current flows 
through source E, to which energy is returned.
•	 An interval of length (1 − γ)Tsw, in which transistor VT3 is on; the 
load current passes through the circuit VT3–VD1, bypassing the 
source; and i0 = 0. The same results may be obtained by switching on 
VT4, which forms a circuit with diode VD2.
In the second quadrant, the converter resembles a step-up dc/dc con-
verter, in which the energy source is the emf Em.

Power electronics basics
Quadrant III. The direction of rotation is reversed; the directions of 
the voltages and currents in the electrical machine are the opposite to 
those shown in Figure 5.12b. When transistors VT3 and VT4 are switched 
on simultaneously, uout = −E; energy is sent from the source to the motor. 
When one of those transistors is switched off, current flows through the 
circuit consisting of a transistor and a diode, bypassing the source: uout = 0; 
i0 = 0; and uout = −γE.
Quadrant IV. Recuperative braking occurs. When all the transistors 
are switched off, the current in the electrical machine, whose direction is 
as in Figure 5.12b, passes through the circuit VD3–VD4, returning energy 
to source E. When transistor VT1 is turned on, current iout flows through 
diode VD3, bypassing the source. The same result may be obtained by 
switching on transistor VT2, which forms a circuit with diode VD4.
We may note the similarities between multiquadrant voltage convert-
ers and voltage source inverters (Section 6.1). The circuit in Figure 5.12a 
corresponds to a half-bridge voltage inverter with asymmetric connection 
of the load and the circuit in Figure 5.12b to a single-phase bridge inverter.
5.5  Thyristor–capacitor regulators with dosed 
energy supply to the load
In the case of continuous current, all the dc voltage converters consid-
ered here have hard natural characteristics (Bulatov and Carenko, 1982). 
In other words, their properties correspond to those of emf sources. 
However, many consumers, especially in electric-drive design and in 
electrotechnology, require different characteristics. In some cases, the 
load resistance may fall to zero in operating conditions. The form of the 
natural characteristics may be corrected by means of CSs with feedback, 
so as to obtain artificial characteristics of the required configuration (e.g., 
with stabilization of the load current or power). In highly dynamic condi-
tions, the CS may process abrupt changes with some delay; oscillatory 
dynamic behavior is possible. In that case, converters with sharply falling 
natural characteristics are preferable. This category includes converters 
with dosed energy supply to the load.
Single-throw thyristors are used as switches in converters with dosed 
energy supply to the load. That permits operation at load voltages where 
the creation of converters on the basis of completely controllable switches 
is difficult and expensive.
The circuit diagram of a dc voltage regulator with dosed energy sup-
ply to the load is shown in Figure 5.13a.
The switching system in this converter is based on thyristors VT1–
VT4, with commutation capacitance Cco. If we compare Figures 5.4a and 
5.13a, we find that the only difference is the type of switch. In other words, 
the converter in Figure 5.13a is a dc-inverting regulator (a buck–boost 

263
Chapter five:  Conversion from direct current to direct current
convertor). However, the properties and characteristics of the converter in 
Figure 5.13a differ from those considered in Section 5.2.3, for the following 
reasons: the capacitance Cco not only ensures thyristor commutation, but 
also stores energy, and the converter operates with discontinuous current.
We now consider the processes in the converter under steady condi-
tions; time diagrams are shown in Figure 5.13b. Each half-period may be 
divided into three stages.
Stage I. At time t1, capacitor Cco is charged to voltage uCco(t1) = E + Uout, 
with the polarity shown outside the parentheses in Figure 5.13a. In inter-
val t1–t2, the control pulses are sent to thyristors VT1 and VT2, and capaci-
tor Cco is recharged in oscillatory fashion in the circuit E–VT2–Cco–VT1–L, 
which transfers the stored energy to choke L. The length of this stage is 
determined by the resonant frequency of the Cco–L circuit.
Stage II. At time t2, the voltage at the capacitor reaches uCco(t2) = E + Uout, 
with the polarity shown in parentheses in Figure 5.13a. The voltage at 
diode VD becomes positive, and the diode is turned on. Consequently, 
further charging of capacitor Cco is impossible, and the source current i0 
and thyristor currents are discontinuous. The current of choke L passes 
through diode VD; the choke’s energy is transmitted to the load circuit 
and stored in filter capacitor Cf . The choke current and the diode current 
id decline. The length of this stage depends on the load current.
Stage III. When id = 0, diode VD is turned off (time t3). The load receives 
the energy stored in capacitor Cf; there is no current in the other circuits. 
The length of this stage is determined by the CS.
At time t4, the second half-period of operation begins. Control pulses 
are sent to thyristors VT3 and VT4. Oscillatory recharging of capacitor Cco

begins in the circuit E–VT4–Cco–VT3–L; from the voltage whose polarity 
is shown in parentheses in Figure 5.13a, the capacitor is raised to the volt-
age E + Uout whose polarity is shown outside the parentheses in Figure 
5.13a. On reaching this voltage, diode VD switches off, and the processes 
develop as in stages II and III.

where f is the repetition frequency, specified by the CS.
As the energy stored in capacitor Cco is sent to the load in dosed fash-
ion in each half-period, the converter resembles a power source in terms 
of its properties, while its natural characteristic is hyperbolic. The system 
functions with shorting in the load circuit. To ensure regulation or stabili-
zation of the load current, the CS adjusts the frequency f.

Inverters and ac converters based 
on completely controllable switches
6.1  Voltage inverters
6.1.1  Single-phase voltage inverters
A voltage source inverter is an inverter connected to a current source 
with the predominant properties of a voltage source (Mohan et al., 2003; 
Rozanov, 2007; Zinov’ev, 2012).
The general structure of a voltage source inverter is shown in 
Figure 6.1.
Figure 6.2a shows the circuit diagram of a half-bridge single-phase 
voltage inverter. This inverter may be used independently or in a system 
with other inverters.
We now introduce the function Fi: Fi = 1 if the control electrode of 
transistor i is at a voltage such that the transistor is switched on, and Fi = 0 
otherwise. In Figure 6.2a, four combinations of switch states are possible:
	
1.	F1 = 1 and F2 = 0. In that case, uout = E/2; the source currents i01 = iout 
and i02 = 0. When iout > 0 (with the current direction corresponding 
to the arrow in Figure 6.2a), the current flows through transistor 
VT1; when iout < 0, the current flows through diode VD1.
	
2.	F1 = 0 and F2 = 1. In that case, uout = −E/2; i01 = 0 and i02 = −iout. When 
iout > 0 (with the current direction corresponding to the arrow in 
Figure 6.2a), the current flows through diode VD2; when iout < 0, the 
current flows through transistor VT2.
	
3.	F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. This case is impermissible, as it leads to short-
circuiting of the source.
	
4.	F1 = 0 and F2 = 0. Two scenarios are possible here.
	
a.	 When iout > 0, the output current flows through diode VD2 and 
uout = −E/2.
	
b.	 When iout < 0, the output current flows through diode VD1 and 
uout = E/2.
In the latter case, the voltage at the load depends on the polarity of 
the output current but not on the inverter’s control signals. However, 
such conditions are necessary to ensure normal operation of the switches 

266
Power electronics basics
in the system. When a control pulse turns off a power switch, there is 
a finite period during which its current falls, and turning on a second 
switch during that interval leads to short-circuiting of the source through 
the two switches in series. Therefore, the operation of the second switch 
must be delayed for a time, ensuring complete decline of the current in 
the first switch to zero (the dead time). If the dead time is not more than 
0.01–0.02 of the interval between commutations of the power switches, the 
processes in the dead time have little influence on the inverter’s output 
voltage.
Neglecting the dead time, we may conclude that the switches operate 
alternately. The function Fi = 1 if switch i (a transistor or diode) is conduct-
ing, while Fi = 0 otherwise. In other words, Fi is the switching function 
of switch i (Section 3.1.3), which conducts current in both directions and 
consists of a transistor and a diode. In Figure 6.2a, the switches may be 
represented in a generalized form, as shown in Figure 6.2b.
Neglecting the dead time, we may assume that
	
F2 = 1 − F1.

In Figure 6.3a through d, we show the switching functions and volt-
age and current curves for a half-bridge inverter with an RL load, when 
using the simplest control algorithm.
When a control pulse is sent to transistor VT1 during the first half-
period (t1−t3), the current in the interval t1−t2 flows through diode VD1; the 
load sends energy to the source, and i01 < 0. In the interval t2−t3, the cur-
rent flows through transistor VT1; energy is transferred from the source 
to the load, and i01 > 0. In the second half-period (t3−t5), a control pulse is 
supplied to transistor VT2. In the interval t3−t4, the current flows through 
diode VD2, the load sends energy to the source, and i02 < 0. In the interval 
t4−t5, the current flows through transistor VT2, energy is transferred from 
the source to the load, and i02 > 0.

Chapter six:  Inverters and ac converters based on completely controllable
In Figure 6.2a, the load may be connected through a transformer. This 
permits an adjustment of the ratio of the fundamental of the output volt-
age to the voltage E.
A common approach is to connect a half-bridge inverter to the source, 
as in Figure 6.2c. Capacitors C1 and C2 form the inverter’s input filter, 
eliminating the variable component of the currents i01 and i02 and ensur-
ing unipolar current at the source E. At the same time, the capacitors split 
the source voltage. However, two problems arise here.
	
1.	The first harmonics of the currents i01 and i02 create voltage drops 
at the capacitors, with deflection of the potential at the midpoint of 
the capacitors, that distorts the output voltage. To prevent this, the 
capacitance of the input filter must be considerably increased.
	
2.	Asymmetry of the circuit and control components may lead to the 
appearance of a constant component and even harmonics in the 
inverter’s output voltage. This problem may be eliminated by using 
control systems with feedback in terms of the output voltage.
In Figure 6.4, we show the circuit diagram of a single-phase bridge volt-
age inverter. It consists of two half-bridge circuits: (1) transistors VT1 and 
VT4 and (2) transistors VT2 and VT3. Neglecting the dead time, we may 
write the following expressions, by analogy with Equation 6.1:
	
F4 = 1 − F1  and  F2 = 1 − F3.

In Equation 6.10, we may note two important differences between the 
bridge inverter and the half-bridge inverter:
	
1.	The amplitude of the output voltage in the bridge circuit is E, which 
is twice the amplitude of uout in the null circuit.
	
2.	In the bridge inverter, zero output voltage is possible: when 
F1 = F3 = 1, the load is short-circuited by switches VT1 and VT3, and 
when F1 = F3 = 0, the load is short-circuited by switches VT2 and 
VT4.
We now find the relation between the output current and the current 
i0 from the source. The current i0 consists of the currents at transistors VT1 
and VT3. Current ioutF1 flows through VT1 and current ioutF3 through VT3. 
Thus,
	
i0 = iout(F1 − F3).	
(6.11)
We consider the simplest algorithm for forming the output voltage 
of a voltage source inverter with an RL load, when F1 = 1 in the first half-
period of the output frequency ωout and F3 = 1 in the second half-period. 
The time diagrams are shown in Figure 6.5.
When control pulses are sent to transistors VT1 and VT2 in the first 
half-period (t1−t3), the current flows through diodes VD1 and VD2 in the 
interval t1−t2, the load sends energy to the source, and i0 < 0. In the interval 
t2−t3, the current flows through transistors VT1 and VT2, energy is trans-
ferred from the source to the load, and i0 > 0.
In the second half-period (t3−t5), control pulses are sent to transistors 
VT3 and VT4. In the interval t3−t4, the current flows through diodes VD3 
and VD4, the load sends energy to the source, and i0 < 0. In the interval 
t4−t5, the current flows through transistors VT3 and VT4, energy is trans-
ferred from the source to the load, and i0 > 0.
The output-voltage spectrum is of the same form as in Figure 6.3e, but 
all the harmonics are doubled

Power electronics basics
When inverters are connected to low-voltage sources (E < 30–50 V), 
static energy losses in the switches may be reduced, if we use an inverter 
based on a null circuit with a center tap in the transformer’s primary 
windings (Figure 6.7). As a rule, the inverter employs the simplest control 
algorithm, in which the control pulse is supplied to transistor VT1 in the 
first half-period and to transistor VT2 in the second half-period. The time 
diagrams of the output voltage and current and the source current i0 are 
as in Figure 6.5c and d.
When a control signal is supplied to transistor VT1 in the first half-
period (t1−t3), the current passes through diode VD1 during interval t1−t2, 
the load sends energy to the source, and i0 < 0. In the interval t2−t3, the 
current flows through transistor VT1, energy is transferred from the 
source to the load, and i0 > 0. In the first half-period, uout = ktrE, where ktr is

The energy stored in the scattering inductances prevents the closure 
of the transistors and results in voltage surges, which may incapacitate 
the transistors. To draw energy from the primary windings, snubbers are 
connected to the transistors. The operating principle of the snubbers was 
outlined in Section 5.3.3.
6.1.2  Pulse-width control in single-phase voltage inverters
The control algorithms already considered for voltage inverters ensure a 
fixed ratio of the output voltage and the source voltage. Regulation and 
stabilization of the voltage source inverter’s output voltage may be based 
on external methods (changing the source voltage) or internal methods 
(changing the switching algorithm).
The simplest method of internal regulation is pulse-width control, in 
which the inverter’s output voltage is synthesized from pulses of equal 
but controllable length.
As follows from Equation 6.10, the output voltage of a single-phase 
bridge voltage inverter may take three values: E, −E, and 0. In other words, 
the output-voltage curve may consist of positive and negative pulses sepa-
rated by various intervals.
We now consider a switching algorithm in which a single pulse is 
formed in the half-period of the output frequency (single-pulse pulse-
width control). The pulse length is tp = γ/(Af ⋅ fout), where Af is the number 
of pulses per period and γ is the fill factor. In Figure 6.8a through d, we 
show the switching functions, currents, and voltages in the operation of 
a voltage source inverter with an RL load. (The dead time is neglected.)
In the period t1−t2, we note an interval without pulses. Current flows 
through switches VD2 and VT4, which short-circuit the load, uout = 0, 
and i0 = 0. The current in the load falls exponentially with time constant 
τ = Llo/Rlo. At time t2, transistor VT4 is turned off by the control circuit. 
A control pulse is sent to transistor VT1, and the formation of a positive 
pulse begins. In the period t2−t3, uout = E, but iout = i0 < 0. The load sends

t3, the current iout = i0 becomes positive and flows through transistors VT1 
and VT2; energy is transferred from the source to the load.
In the second half-period, the period t4−t5 corresponds to an interval 
between pulses, current flows through switches VT1 and VD3, uout = 0, 
and i0 = 0. At time t5, transistor VT1 is switched off. A control pulse is 
supplied to transistor VT4, and the formation of a negative pulse begins. 
In the period t5−t6, uout = −E, but iout = −i0 > 0. The load sends energy to the 
source, and current flows through the diodes VD3 and VD4. At time t6, the 
current iout = −i0 becomes negative and flows through transistors VT3 and 
VT4; energy is transferred from the source to the load.

In pulse-width control of multipulse type, Af/2 pulses of equal dura-
tion are formed in each half-period, along with corresponding intervals 
between the pulses. In Figure 6.9a through d, we show the switching 
functions, currents, and voltages in the operation of a voltage source 
inverter with an RL load when Af = 20. The load and fill factor γ in Figures 
6.8 and 6.9 are the same. It is evident that the VT1–VT4 pair has a switching 
frequency fsw = Af ⋅ fout. The effective value of the output voltage is given by 
Equation 6.15.
In Figures 6.8e and 6.9e, we show the output-voltage spectra. The har-
monic composition of uout in single-pulse pulse-width control depends on 
the fill factor γ, as shown in Figure 6.10.

harmonics have the worst influence on consumers. The spectrum of uout 
with Af > 20–30 may be divided into a low-frequency region (k < Af − 9) 
and a high-frequency region, with little effect on the consumer. In the low-
frequency region, the amplitude of the harmonics (k = 1, 3, 5, …) is

whereas the total harmonic distortion is kthd = 0.47 and does not depend

As many consumers are dissatisfied with the quality of the output 
voltage, numerous methods have been proposed for improving the har-
monic composition of uout for voltage source inverters, both by modifying 
the inverter circuit and by modifying the switching algorithms. With the 
appearance of powerful high-frequency power transformers and micro-
processor control systems, control methods based on pulse-width modu-
lation are dominant (Chapter 7).

We will consider the simplest switching algorithm, known as 180° 
conductivity. In Figure 6.12, we show the time diagrams for the switching 
functions and the voltages in the inverter. The numbering of the switches 
corresponds to the order in which they operate. The shift between switch-
ing functions is 60°, and the duration of the switch’s conducting state is 
180°.
The phase voltage is a rectangular step function with amplitude 2E/3. 
In Figure 6.13, we show the spectrum of the output phase voltage. As in a 
single-phase voltage source inverter, the spectrum contains odd harmon-
ics, whose amplitude is inversely proportional to the frequency. However, 
the third harmonic and its multiples are absent.
The effective value of the fundamental is 0.45E. The effective value of 
the phase voltage is 0.471E. The total harmonic distortion kthd = 0.29. The 
spectrum of the line voltage is of the same form, but all the harmonics are 
larger by a factor of 3 .
In Figure 6.14a, we plot the phase voltage uA and current iA with an 
active–inductive load. In Figure 6.14b, we plot the time diagram of the 
current i0 drawn from source E, according to Equation 6.23. The spectrum 
of current i0 contains a constant component and harmonics that are mul-
tiples of 6fout.
The algorithm presented here for the formation of the output voltage 
ensures a fixed ratio of the fundamental of the output voltage to the source 
voltage. The simplest internal method of regulating the output voltage is 
pulse-width control. In that case, the output voltage consists of pulses of the 
same duration appearing at constant frequency and separated by specific 
intervals.
In the formation of output-voltage pulses, the same switches are 
employed as in 180° conductivity.

Two approaches are adopted in creating intervals between the pulses 
in all phases of the output voltage.

2.	Control pulses are supplied to the even switches: F2 = F4 = F6 = 1. 
Once again, uA = 0, uB = 0, and uC = 0; i0 = 0.
To ensure uniform current load on the switches, these approaches are 
alternated. To ensure symmetry of the phase and line voltages, the num-
ber of pulses within the output-frequency period Af is a multiple of 6.
In Figure 6.15a, we plot the output phase voltage uA and current iA of 
the voltage source inverter. In Figure 6.15b, we plot the current i0. In Figure 
6.15c and d, we present the spectra of the output phase voltage and the 
current i0. The inverter operates with a symmetric RL load, Af = 24, and 
γ = 0.5.
At small Af, deterioration in harmonic composition of the voltage 
source inverter’s output voltage is observed with a decrease in γ. We may 
eliminate this problem by increasing the number of pulses per period 
and the switching frequency fsw = Af ⋅ fout. When Af > 20–30, the spec-
trum of uout may be divided into a low-frequency region (k < Af − 9) and

whereas the total harmonic distortion for the low-frequency region is 
kthd = 0.29 and does not depend on γ.
Although this harmonic composition of the output voltage is accept-
able for many frequency-based electric drives, we may note a recent trend 
in which voltage source inverters with pulse-width control are replaced 
by converters with pulse-width modulation (Chapter 7). That is because, 
in microprocessor control systems, pulse-width modulation results in bet-
ter quality of the output voltage with practically no additional costs.
6.1.4  Three-phase voltage inverters for asymmetric loads
When the load is connected in a delta configuration, a three-phase bridge 
voltage source inverter may operate with a symmetric load or with an 
asymmetric load (Chaplygin, 2009). With any load, the line voltages uAB, uBC, 
and uCA applied to its diagonals remain symmetric. However, they pro-
duce asymmetric currents in the diagonals of the load. In Figure 6.16, we 
show the current i0 drawn from the source by the voltage inverter in the 
case of an asymmetric load.
Comparison of Figures 6.14b and 6.16 shows that, with an asymmetric 
load, the repetition period of the current i0 is tripled and is equal to half 
the period of the output frequency. As a result, the spectrum of current 
i0 includes additional harmonics—in particular, the component with fre-
quency 2fout.
In the case of an asymmetric load in a star configuration without a 
neutral line, the three-phase bridge inverter (Figure 6.11) forms an asym-
metric system of phase voltages. This asymmetry cannot be eliminated by 
means of the control system. In that case, symmetry of the output voltage 
may be restored by connecting four lines to the load (a star configuration 
with a neutral line).
In Figure 6.17, we show the circuit diagrams of three-phase inverters 
for power supply to an asymmetric load.
In Figure 6.17a, we show a circuit consisting of three single-phase 
half-bridges, with splitting of the supply voltage at capacitors C1 and C2.

Power electronics basics
Each half-bridge operates independently, as in a single-phase half-bridge 
circuit (Figure 6.2c). The potential of point 0 relative to the negative pole 
of the source is E/2. The 120° mutual shift of the phase voltages is speci-
fied by the control system. The phase voltage may take two values: E/2 
or −E/2.
In the circuit with an additional half-bridge (Figure 6.17b) (Chaplygin, 
2009; Zinov’ev, 2012), the potential of point 0 relative to the negative pole 
of the source may be E or −E; the mean value over the period of the output 
frequency is maintained at φ0,me = E/2. The phase voltages uA = φA − φ0, 
uB = φB − φ0, and uC = φC − φ0 may take three values: E/2, −E/2, and 0.
The circuit consisting of three single-phase half-bridges exhibits all 
the deficiencies of half-bridge voltage source inverters. First, the funda-
mental of the null sequence of asymmetric phase currents deflects the 
capacitor’s center potential, with distortion of the output voltage. To elimi-
nate this problem, the input-filter capacitance must be greatly increased.

Secondly, the asymmetry of the circuit components and the control sys-
tem may lead to the appearance of a constant component and even har-
monics in the inverter’s output voltage. Thirdly, the phase voltage does 
not have null intervals.
The downside of the circuit with an additional half-bridge is the extra 
cost of the semiconductor devices and drivers. As shown by calculations, 
however, the standard power of the input-filter capacitance is an order of 
magnitude less than the total power of the capacitances in Figure 6.17a. 
The possibility of generating null intervals in the phase–voltage curve 
greatly improves the harmonic composition of the output voltage.
6.2  Current inverters
6.2.1  Transistor current inverters
The current source inverter is an inverter connected to a dc source with the 
predominant properties of a current source (Rozanov, 2007).
In Figure 6.18, we show the circuit diagram of a single-phase bridge-
type current source inverter. On the dc side, a choke Ld stabilizes the cur-
rent id and evens out the pulsations, in the absence of which id = Id. The 
switches transmit current only in one direction. Diodes protect the tran-
sistors from voltages of inverse polarity.
With any switching algorithm, continuous flow of current Id must be 
ensured. Therefore, one odd-numbered switch and one even-numbered 
switch must be turned on.
Accordingly, the switching functions are as follows: F3 = 1 − F1 and 
F4 = 1 − F2.
Rectangular current pulses are sent to the ac circuit. As the load is 
characterized by inductance, as a rule, we need to connect a capacitive

filter Cf in parallel with the load Zlo. The load and the filter form an ac 
circuit with impedance Z.
We will consider the simplest operational algorithm of the current 
source inverter: in that case, transistors VT1 and VT2 are conducting in 
the first half-period, whereas transistors VT3 and VT4 are conducting in 
the second half-period. In Figure 6.19, we show current and voltage dia-
grams in the inverter when the modulus of the load impedance at the 
output frequency is Zlo1 (Figure 6.19a and b) and Zlo2 = 10Zlo1 (Figure 6.19c 
and d) and for two values of cos φ at the fundamental (at the output fre-
quency): cos φ = 1 (Figure 6.19a and c) and cos φ = 0.8 (Figure 6.19c and d). 
On the diagrams, we give voltage values when E = 300 V.
In the case of an active load (cos φ = 1), the capacitor voltage is nega-
tive at time t1. When transistors VT1 and VT2 are switched on, the current 
in the ac circuit is i > 0 and that current charges the capacitor. The load 
voltage varies exponentially. In the period t1−t2, the current and voltage

are in opposite directions; the ac circuit sends energy to choke Ld. In the 
period t2−t3, the voltage and current are of the same polarity; the ac circuit 
receives energy from the dc circuit. In the second half-period, i < 0; the 
capacitor is discharged. Comparison of Figure 6.19a and c shows that the 
form of the output voltage changes as a function of the load resistance. 
As the time constant of capacitor charging changes proportionally, the 
voltage with a low-resistance load is close to rectangular, with a high-
resistance load, uout is close to triangular.
The voltage ud = uout ⋅ (F1 − F3) may be of different polarity; ud = E is 
its mean value (Figure 6.19). When E = const, the amplitude uout increases 
with an increase in the load resistance and as uout becomes more triangu-
lar, the fundamental of the output voltage uout,1 also increases. Therefore, 
the characteristic uout,1 = f (1/Zlo) of the current source inverter declines 
steeply. The family of characteristics may be seen in Figure 6.20.
The current and voltage diagrams with an active–inductive load are 
shown in Figure 6.19b and d. With a low-resistance load, an additional 
oscillatory component is seen in the charging and discharging of capaci-
tor Cf. However, the effect of the load on the inverter characteristic is 
purely quantitative (Figure 6.20). The characteristic takes the form

Power electronics basics
The voltage at switch i is usw = ud(1 − Fi). The changing polarity of volt-
age usw necessitates the use of switches with a blocking diode (Figure 6.18).
In the design of current source inverters, there is an upper limit on 
the output voltage: uout,1 ≤ ulim. For the required load range, it follows from 
Equation 6.25 that YC = ωoutCf. In operation with low output frequencies, 
the capacitor costs increase. That limits the use of current source inverters 
with the switching algorithm described here.
In Figure 6.21, we show a three-phase bridge current inverter. To 
ensure continuous flow of current Id, one odd-numbered switch and one 
even-numbered switch must be on at any time. Hence
	
F1 + F3 + F5 = 1,  F2 + F4 + F6 = 1.	
(6.26)
We now consider the simplest switching algorithm: in that case, each 
switch conducts for one-third of the period, and the sequence in which 
the switches operate is their numerical order. In Figure 6.22, we show the 
current and voltage diagrams in the case of a symmetric R load.

Power electronics basics
In three-phase current source inverters, the choke inductance Ld 
required to smooth out the ripple of current id may be considerably less 
than that in single-phase inverters.
The basic features of current source inverters are as follows:
	
1.	Current source inverters contain a choke with high inductance in 
the dc circuit. As a result, they are larger and heavier than voltage 
source inverters.
	
2.	Current source inverters do not permit operation in near-idling con-
ditions (with minimal load), on account of the increase in the output 
voltage and switch voltages.
	
3.	Current source inverters with the simple switching algorithm here 
described cannot effectively be used to produce low-frequency volt-
age, on account of the cost of the capacitors.
	
4.	The natural characteristic of current source inverters is sharply 
descending.
	
5.	Current source inverters are characterized by considerable control 
inertia, on account of the variation in the source voltage.
	
6.	Current source inverters are stable under the action of short-circuits 
in the load circuit, on account of stabilization of the source current. 
In short circuits, the output current may grow very slowly.
	
7.	The transistors in current source inverters may be replaced by 
­single-throw thyristors, without change in circuit design. In that case, 
Cf also acts as a commutating capacitor. That reduces the inverter 
cost and permits its use with high-voltage loads (Section 6.2.3).
With the appearance of high-frequency power transistors, current 
source inverters have become considerably less competitive with voltage 
inverters. However, they may still prove useful in certain electric drives 
and in other areas of electrotechnology.
6.2.2  Pulse-width control in current inverters
Regulation and stabilization of the current source inverter’s output volt-
age may be based on external methods (changing the source voltage E) 
or internal methods. In transistor-based current source inverters, pulse-
width control may be employed. We now consider the operation of a 
single-phase current source inverter (Figure 6.18), with an R load in the 
case of single-pulse pulse-width control.
To prevent energy supply from the source E during the intervals 
between pulses, we may supply control pulses to the transistors of a 
single half-bridge (VT1, VT4 or VT2, VT3). In that case, the load is dis-
connected from the external circuit; the voltage and the current at Zlo 
are maintained by the supply of energy stored in capacitor Cf during the 

291
Chapter six:  Inverters and ac converters based on completely controllable
pulse. In Figure 6.23, we present the corresponding current and voltage 
diagrams; the voltages when E = 300 V are shown. It is evident that the 
voltage pulses ud become shorter with a decrease in the fill factor γ. As the 
mean value of ud is E, the amplitude of the pulses ud increases, along with 
the output voltage and the fundamental component uout,1.
In Figure 6.24, we show the family of characteristics uout,1 = f (1/Zlo) 
for a current source inverter with pulse-width control in the case of an R 
load. The characteristics are sharply descending. In the case of an RL load, 
the output voltage includes an oscillatory component, which is especially 
intense at small R. As a result, the characteristics are distorted, and the 
influence of the load and β on the output voltage becomes more complex.

Power electronics basics
Therefore, pulse-width control cannot expediently be used for regulation 
and stabilization of the current source inverter’s output voltage in the case 
of an RL load.
The harmonic composition of the output voltage may be improved by 
pulse-width modulation (Chapter 7).
6.2.3  Current inverters based on single-throw thyristors
We noted in Section 6.2.1 that the transistors in current source inverters 
may be replaced by single-throw thyristors, without change in the basic 
circuit design. In Figure 6.25, we show circuit diagrams for single-phase 
and three-phase current source inverters. These are known as parallel 
inverters. All the relations and characteristics in Section 6.2.1 apply in 
this case. The only difference is that the capacitors Cf in the thyristor 
inverter are commutating capacitors. That entails that the fundamental 
component of the current i in the ac circuit must lead the fundamen-
tal component of the output voltage uout by the phase β. The reactive 
power created by the capacitor must be greater than the inductive power 
of the load. In other words, the load’s reactive power must be amply 
compensated.
We now consider the commutation of the thyristors in the first half-
period. At time t1 (Figure 6.19), the voltage at the load and capacitor Cf is 
negative. Therefore, when pulses are supplied to the control electrodes 
of thyristors VT1 and VT2, a positive voltage is applied from the capaci-
tor to the cathode of thyristor VT3, whereas a negative pulse is supplied 
to anode VT4. Through open switches VT1 and VT2, the capacitor voltage 
is applied to thyristors VT3 and VT4, which consequently are switched 
off.  They remain off as long as the voltage at the capacitor is negative

Power electronics basics
φ = φmax, and βmin = ωouttoff, we obtain from Equation 6.31 the minimum 
value of YC = ωoutCf required for reliable thyristor commutation. In any cur-
rent inverter, there is an upper limit on Zlo on account of the increase in 
the output voltage and a lower limit on Zlo on account of the commutation 
conditions in thyristor inverters.
When Equation 6.30 is not satisfied in commutation, both thyristors 
in the half-bridge are open, and there will be a short in the dc circuit, with 
a consequent increase in the current through choke Ld. The load is also 
short-circuited, and the capacitor’s unbounded discharge current flows 
through the thyristors, which may be damaged as a result. Thus, failure 
to satisfy Equation 6.30—for instance, connection of the inverter to a load 
Zlo < Zlo ⋅ min—will result in an accident.
Equations 6.30 and 6.31 are valid for both single-phase and three-
phase inverters.
For thyristor-based current source inverters, regulation and stabiliza-
tion of the output voltage by internal methods require the introduction of 
additional circuit components. The most common circuit design includes 
a capacitive-power compensator; a single-phase compensator is illustrated 
in Figure 6.26. In the ac circuit, a compensator consisting of a choke Lco 
and a bidirectional thyristor switch is introduced in parallel with the load.
When the bidirectional switch is conducting, the fundamental com-
ponent of the compensator’s inductive current is

The reactive component of the inverter current is
	
ir = iout.r + iL.	
(6.33)
If delay is introduced in the thyristor switching within the bidirec-
tional switch, discontinuous current flows through choke Lco, and the 
fundamental component of the current iL declines. In this way, we may 
regulate the reactive power in the ac circuit and stabilize the phase β, 
which, according to Equation 6.25, determines the magnitude of the fun-
damental component in the inverter’s output voltage.
Despite the ability to stabilize or regulate the output voltage, the 
device has serious deficiencies.
•	 Complication of the power circuit
•	 Complication of the control system on account of the additional con-
trol channel for the thyristors in the compensator
•	 Increase in the capacitance Cf, as some of its reactive power is con-
sumed in compensation of the compensator’s own reactive power.
In the proposed system, the capacitors ensure capacitive load in the ac 
circuit. The capacitance may be reduced by including cutoff diodes in the 
circuit (Figure 6.27).
When thyristors VT1 and VT2 and diodes VD1 and VD2 are conduct-
ing, the capacitors are charged with the polarity as shown in Figure 6.27. 
The capacitors are disconnected from the load by diodes VD3 and VD4.

result reaches a value equal to the output voltage. Diodes VD1 and VD2 
are switched off, whereas diodes VD3 and VD4 begin to conduct. In the

6.3  ac converters
As shown in Chapter 4, line-commutated ac thyristor converters with pro-
found regulation are characterized by a low power factor. The use of com-
pletely controllable switches considerably improves this problem.
6.3.1  ac converters (regulators) without transformers
Such converters are based on dc regulators (Section 5.2). Some circuit dia-
grams are shown in Figure 6.28a through c. The transistors in the regula-
tor circuits are replaced by bidirectionally conducting switches VT1 and 
the diodes by bidirectionally conducting switches VT2. In Figure 6.28d 
through f, we show possible structures for the transistor switches. The 
regulator input is connected to an ac grid (voltage e). With a positive grid 
voltage, the direction of the currents through the switches is as shown in 
Figure 6.28a through c. The switches VT2, replacing the diodes, are on for 
the first half-period, while the switches VT1 are on for the same periods 
as the transistors in dc regulators.
Thus, with any polarity of the grid voltage, the converters operate in 
the same way as dc regulators. The difference is that the converters are 
connected to an ac voltage source. As the switching algorithms are the 
same, the formulas for dc regulators may be employed here.

output current iL are considerably weakened. The grid current i0 is also 
pulsed; its spectrum contains high-frequency components (Figure 6.29c). 
The converter’s power factor is χ = ν ⋅ cos φ, where the fundamental factor

Chapter six:  Inverters and ac converters based on completely controllable
To reduce the distortion power, a capacitive filter Cin is introduced at 
the input of ac voltage converters (Figure 6.29d). The filter takes care of the 
high-frequency components of the converter’s input current i0. To reduce 
Cin, we may increase the switching frequency fsw = Af ⋅ fgrid, where Af is the 
number of pulses on the u curve within the grid period. A step-up con-
verter (Figure 6.28b) may be connected to the grid without a filter, as the 
converter’s input current is continuous.
6.3.2  ac voltage converter with a voltage booster
The converter in Figure 6.30a contains a bridge consisting of bidirection-
ally conducting switches and also a transformer (transformation ratio ktr). 
In Figure 6.30b, we plot the voltages in this circuit. When switches S1 and 
S2 are turned on, uout = e(1 + ktr). When S2 and S3 (or S1 and S4) are turned 
on, ud = 0, whereas uout = e. By varying the fill factor γ, we may regulate uout 
(uout > e). When switches S3 and S4 are turned on, uout = −e(1 + ktr). When 
S2 and S3 (or S1 and S4) are turned on, ud = 0, whereas uout = e. By varying 
the fill factor γ, we may regulate uout (uout < e).
A benefit of this converter is that the harmonic composition of the 
output voltage and the grid current is better than for the converters in 
Section 6.3.1. Accordingly, the converter may be used without input and 
output filters. Deficiencies include greater size and mass on account of 
the transformer operating at the output frequency and the considerable 
expenditures on the transistor switches, each of which may be based on 
the circuits in Figure 6.28d through f.
The converter in Figure 6.30c includes a rectifier R and an inverter I 
forming the bipolar voltage ud at the first transformer winding by pulse-
width control (Section 6.1.1). The voltage diagrams are shown in Figure 
6.30d. Depending on the phase of the inverter bridge’s output voltage, the 
converter may increase or decrease the grid voltage. The rectangular volt-
age of the voltage booster leads to the appearance of odd output-frequency 
harmonics in the output voltage; these harmonics are small.
The deficiencies of this converter are increase in mass and size on 
account of the transformer and the considerable expenditures on the tran-
sistor switches.
6.3.3  Indirect ac voltage converters
To improve the harmonic composition of the output voltage (without 
major expenditures on output filters) and to increase the power factor as 
close as possible to one, we may use indirect ac voltage converters, which 
consist of a one- or three-phase active rectifier and a one- or three-phase 
inverter. Both modules form the voltage by pulse-width ­modulation 
(Chapter 7).

6.4  Frequency converters
6.4.1  Frequency converters with a dc link
Frequency converters are widely used in electric drives, in the power 
industry, in optical engineering, and elsewhere. Most frequency con-
verters today are indirect frequency converters, consisting of a rectifier and 
an inverter, and contain a dc link. The chosen frequency converter will 
depend on the number of phases and the frequency variation at the input 
and output, the requirements on the harmonic composition of the output 
voltage and current, the requirements on the power factor, and the ratio of 
the output and input converter voltages. The series of frequency convert-
ers must ensure reversal of the energy flux between the grid and the load.

Chapter six:  Inverters and ac converters based on completely controllable
Frequency converters are based on current and voltage inverters and 
also resonant inverters (Chapter 8). With strict quality requirements on 
the output voltage and with broad variation in the output frequency, wide 
use has recently been made of voltage inverters that form the output volt-
age by pulse-width modulation (Chapter 7). Current inverters with pulse-
width modulation are also employed.
In rectifier selection, we must take account of the requirements on 
the power factor. Uncontrolled rectifiers with L or LC filters—especially 
three-phase rectifiers (Chapter 4)—have a high power factor. Higher val-
ues of the power factor (χ ≈ 1) may be obtained by means of active rectifiers 
or power-factor correctors (Section 7.3.2). In that case, the frequency con-
verter corresponds to the single-phase/three-phase converters in Figure 
6.31. Single-phase/three-phase and three-phase/single-phase converters 
are of similar structure.
In Figure 6.31a, we use a controllable rectifier, and the dc link contains 
a capacitive filter (energy store). In Figure 6.31b, we again use a controllable 
rectifier (Section 7.3), and the dc link contains an inductive filter. The filter 
in the dc link is the output filter for the rectifier and the input filter for the 
inverter. The benefits of converters that do not include a transformer are the 
ability to obtain the output voltages higher or lower than the grid voltage 
and the ability to reverse the energy flux between the grid and the load.

Direct frequency converters are of considerable interest to researchers.

connected to each phase (A, B, C) of the grid by means of bidirectionally 
conducting switches based on the circuit in Figure 6.28d. This is known 
as a matrix converter of the frequency (Teichmann et al., 2000; Shrejner 
et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005; Chaplygin, 2007; Fedyczak et al., 2009; Manesh 
et al., 2009).
The input filter of such a matrix converter isolates the input-current 
components formed by the converter whose frequency is close to or above 
the commutation frequency of the converter switches. Therefore, the 
system is light and compact. The use of pulse-width modulation in this 
structure ensures very high quality of the output voltage when current, 
whose fundamental component is in phase with the grid voltage, is drawn 
from the grid. The matrix converter facilitates energy transmission in two 
directions between the grid and the load. In Figure 6.33, we plot the volt-
ages and currents at the input (uA, iA) and output (ua, ia) of the matrix con-
verter. The input frequency is 50 Hz, and the output frequency is 100 Hz.
The benefits of the matrix converter are the absence of filters (energy 
stores) in the dc link and lower voltage losses at the switches.
However, the matrix converter also has a number of serious drawbacks.
	
1.	The matrix converter contains nine bidirectionally conducting 
switches, that is, 18 completely controllable unidirectionally con-
ducting switches. In contrast, three-phase/three-phase converters 
with a dc link (Figure 6.31) have only 12 switches.
	
2.	The matrix converters require considerable expenditures on drivers 
and their power sources.
	
3.	Additional current sensors are required for commutation of the 
switches in the matrix converter.

4.	The transformation ratio of the matrix converter, that is, the ratio 
of the maximum possible effective value of the output phase volt-
age to the effective value of the grid phase voltage, is kU,mcf = 0.86–
0.95, whereas kU > 1 is possible in indirect frequency converters 
(Figure 6.31).
	
5.	The matrix converter’s output voltage contains intense parasitic 
harmonics in the low-frequency region. (The amplitude of the fifth 
harmonic may be 10% of the fundamental component, and the 
amplitude of the second harmonic may be 1.5%–4.6% of the funda-
mental. Harmonics with frequencies below that of the fundamental 
component may appear, as well as a constant component.) Thus, the 
matrix converter falls far short of frequency converters with a dc 
link in terms of the quality of the output voltage. With asymme-
try of the grid, the matrix converter’s output voltage deteriorates, 
on account of the appearance of low-frequency components that lie 
below the output frequency. This effect is especially pronounced at 
the maximum output frequencies.
	
6.	The power factor of the matrix converter is high. Nevertheless, the 
spectrum of the grid current contains low-frequency components 
that are not present in converters with a dc link.
However, for a very large class of low-power rectifiers (say, single-
phase rectifiers), the methods outlined here cannot be used to improve the 
compatibility with the grid, on account of the expenses involved. To that 
end, we use correction of the power factor on the dc side of the rectifiers.

Pulse-width modulation and 
power quality control
7.1  Basic principles of pulse-width modulation
According to the definition in IEC 551-16-30, pulse-width modulation 
(PWM) is a pulse control in which the width or frequency of pulses is 
modulated within the period of the fundamental frequency so as to cre-
ate a specific output voltage waveform. In most cases, PWM is used to 
ensure a sinusoidal voltage or current, that is, to reduce the magnitude 
of the higher harmonics relative to the fundamental component (the first 
harmonic). We may distinguish the following basic methods of PWM 
(Rashid, 1988; Mohan et al., 1995; Rozanov et al., 2007):
•	 Sinusoidal PWM (and its variants)
•	 Selective elimination of higher harmonics
•	 Hysteresis or Δ-modulation
•	 Space-vector (SV) modulation
The classical technique of sinusoidal PWM entails modifying the 
width of the pulses forming the output voltage (current), by comparing a 
given voltage signal (the reference signal) with a triangular voltage signal 
of higher frequency (the carrier signal). The reference signal is the modu-
lating signal and determines the required waveform of the output voltage 
(current). In the present case, this signal is sinusoidal and is at the same 
frequency as the fundamental component of the voltage or current. Many 
versions of this method exist, with special nonsinusoidal waveforms of 
the modulating signals. By such means, the level of specific harmonics 
may be successfully reduced.
Selective harmonic elimination permits the suppression of high-­
frequency harmonics of the output voltage (current) by adjusting the 
pulse width and the number of switching operations within each half-
period. At present, this method is successfully implemented by means of 
microprocessor controllers.
Hysteresis modulation is based on the relay tracking of a reference 
­signal, for example, a sinusoidal signal. In the simplest case, this method 
combines the principles of PWM and pulse-frequency modulation. 

306
Power electronics basics
Various approaches permit the stabilization of the modulation frequency 
or the limitation of its variation.
SV modulation is based on the transformation of a three-phase volt-
age (current) system to a two-phase stationary frame, with the derivation 
of a generalized SV of voltage (current). Within each cycle determined by 
the modulation frequency (in each sampling period), the switching occurs 
between the basic vectors, which correspond to valid states of the converter 
switches. This results in the formation of the required modulating vector, 
corresponding to the reference voltage (current) in the three-phase system.
PWM-based control enables us to generate the fundamental compo-
nent of voltage or current that has the desired frequency, amplitude, and 
phase. As force-commutated switches are used in the ac–dc converters in 
this case, it can operate in the four quadrants of the complex plane. In other 
words, operation in both rectifier and inverter modes is possible, with any 
value of the power factor cos φ in the range from −1 to +1. In addition, 
with an increase in the modulation frequency, the ability to reproduce the 
specified voltages (currents) at the inverter output improves. Accordingly, 
on the basis of force-commutated converters, active power filters to elimi-
nate harmonics can be implemented (Section 7.3.3).
The main definitions are presented in the following by example of 
sinusoidal PWM in a single-phase half-bridge voltage source inverter 
(Figure 7.1a). Switches S1 and S2 are regarded as force-commutated 
devices connected in series and parallel to diodes. The serial diodes cor-
respond to unidirectional conduction of the switches (e.g., transistors or 
thyristors), and the parallel reverse diodes ensure the conduction of nega-
tive currents.
Figure 7.1b shows the reference modulating signal um(ϑ) and the car-
rier signal uc(ϑ). The control pulses for switches S1 and S2 are formed by 
the following principle. When um(ϑ) > uc(ϑ), switch S1 is on and S2 is off. 
When um(ϑ) < uc(ϑ), the states of the switches are reversed: S2 is on and 
S1 is off. Thus, the output voltage waveform is the bidirectional pulses 
(Figure 7.1b). In practice, to eliminate states in which both switches S1 
and S2 are on, there must be some interval between the instant at which 
one switch is turned on and the instant at which the other is turned off. 
Obviously, the pulse width depends on the amplitude ratio of the signals 
um(ϑ) and uc(ϑ). The parameter characterizing this ratio is the modulation 
index defined as

where Um and Uc are the amplitudes of the modulating signal um(ϑ) and

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
The frequency fc of the triangular carrier signal is equal to the switch-
ing frequency of S1 and S2 and is usually considerably greater than the 
frequency fm of the modulating signal. The ratio of fm and fc is an important 
parameter of the modulation efficiency and is known as the frequency-
modulation ratio

For small values of Mf, the signals um(ϑ) and uc(ϑ) must be synchronized, 
so as to eliminate undesirable subharmonics in the output voltage. If these 
signals are synchronized, Mf is an integer. As recommended by Mohan 
et al. (1995), maximum value of Mf that requires the synchronization is 21.

According to Equation 7.3, the amplitude of the fundamental compo-
nent of the output voltage is equal to its pulse height Ud/2 when Ma = 1. 
A typical dependence of the first harmonic of the output voltage (in the 
dimensionless form) on modulation index Ma is shown in Figure 7.2. In 
the range of Ma from 0 to 1, UaN1 varies linearly as a function of the modu-
lation index. The limiting value of Ma is determined by the relevant mod-
ulation principle, according to which the maximum value of UaN1 is the 
height of a rectangular half-wave (Ud/2). Further increase in Ma leads to a 
nonlinear increase in UaN1 to the maximum value.
From the Fourier expansion of the rectangular function, the maxi-
mum amplitude of the first harmonic of voltage is

increase in the frequency, the switching losses in the converter increase, 
but the output voltage spectrum is improved and it is easier to filter the 
high-­frequency harmonics due to modulation. In many cases, fc must be 
selected so as to reach the upper limit of the acoustic range (20 kHz). In 
the fc selection voltage levels, power of the converter and others should be 
taken into consideration. Therefore, the selection of Mf is a multiple-factor 
optimization problem. The general trend is the higher Mf for low-power 
converters and low voltages and vice versa.
7.1.1  Pulse modulation with a stochastic process
The use of PWM in converters is associated with the appearance of higher 
harmonics in the modulated voltages and currents. Their strongest com-
ponents in the spectrum appear at frequencies that are multiples of Mf . 
Harmonics also appear at frequencies grouped around multiples of Mf . In 
that case, the amplitudes of the harmonics decrease on moving away from 
those values. Higher harmonics may have the following consequences:
•	 Acoustic noise
•	 Deterioration of electromagnetic compatibility with other electrical 
devices
The main sources of acoustic noise are electromagnetic components 
(inductors and transformers) under the action of voltages and currents 
containing harmonics with acoustic frequencies. Note that noise may 
appear at specific frequencies where the higher harmonics are a maxi-
mum, although the phenomena that produce noise, such as magnetostric-
tion, complicate the problem solution. Problems with electromagnetic 
compatibility may arise over a broad frequency range and will be dif-
ferently expressed for different devices. Traditionally, design and techno-
logical measures are adopted to reduce noise, although passive filters and 
various design methods are used to ensure electromagnetic compatibility.
A promising approach is to modify the spectrum of the modulated 
voltages and currents—specifically, to equalize the frequency spectrum 
and to reduce the amplitude of the strongest harmonics by distributing 
them stochastically over a broad frequency range. It allows reducing the 
concentration of the noise energy at frequencies at which the harmonics 
may be a maximum. A benefit of this approach is that it does not require 
modifying the converter power components and generally relies on soft-
ware, with a little change in the control system. The main principles of 
these methods are considered in the following.
PWM is based on the adjustment of the duty ratio γ = ton/T, where ton 
is the switch on time and T is the period of pulses. Usually, under steady-
state conditions, these parameters, as well as the position of the pulse 

310
Power electronics basics
within period T, are constant, and the results of PWM are determined as 
the integral average values. In this case, the values of ton and T, as well as 
the pulse position, result in an undesirable spectrum of the modulated 
parameters. If we assume that ton and T are random, while keeping the 
required value of γ, the processes become stochastic, and the spectrum of 
the modulated parameters is modified. For example, the position of the 
pulse within period T can be random, or the stochastic variation of T can 
be ensured. For this purpose, a random-number generator can be used to 
affect the generator of modulation frequency f = 1/T. Also, the position of 
the pulse within period T can be changed with zero mathematical expec-
tation. The average value of γ must remain at the level specified by the 
control system. As a result, the spectrum of the modulated voltages and 
currents is equalized.

7.2.1.1  Single-phase full-bridge voltage source inverter
A simplified topology of a single-phase full-bridge voltage source inverter 
is shown in Figure 7.3. In this circuit, as in a single-phase half-bridge 
inverter, sinusoidal PWM is based on comparison of the sinusoidal mod-
ulating signal with a triangular carrier signal. In the full-bridge circuit, 
in contrast to the half-bridge circuit, either unipolar or bipolar modula-
tion techniques can be used. The switches S1–S4 are analogous to those 
in Figure 7.1. To simplify the consideration of modulation, the node N is 
marked between two equal dc-side capacitances Cd (Figure 7.3).

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
In a full-bridge inverter, there are four combinations of switch as 
summarized in Table 7.1, where on and off states of switch S are denoted 
by 1 and 0, respectively. Table 7.2 presents the voltages uaN, ubN, and 
uab = uaN – ubN for these states. Depending on the type of modulation, dif-
ferent combinations of switch states may be used.
In unipolar modulation, two modulating signals um(ϑ) and −um(ϑ) are 
used at the same time (Figure 7.4). In that case, there are two sequences 
of switch control pulses. One sequence controls switches of one leg (S1 
and S4), whereas the other controls the other switches (S3 and S2). The 
pulse sequence generated by comparing the reference signal um(ϑ) and 
the triangular signal uc(ϑ) determines the voltage uaN. When the negative 
modulating signal –um(ϑ) is compared with the carrier signal uc(ϑ), the 
pulse sequence for ubN is generated. This results in simultaneous modula-
tion of the potential of node a relative to N (switches S1 and S4 are used) 
and modulation of the potential of node b (switches S3 and S2 are used). 
In that case, the potential of node a relative to node N is Ud/2 when switch 
S1 is on (states I and III) and –Ud/2 when switch S4 is on (states II and IV). 
The potential of node b relative to node N is equal to Ud/2 when switch S3 
is on (states II and III) and −Ud/2 when S2 is on (states I and IV). The condi-
tions of commutation of switches are

In the case of bipolar PWM technique, the switching algorithm differs. 
In that case, only two states I and II periodically alternate in accordance

The switching of states I and II corresponds to the modulation in a 
half-bridge voltage source inverter implemented by switches S1 and S2 
(Figure 7.1). The full-bridge and half-bridge inverters differ in the ampli-
tude of the output voltage pulses. This amplitude is Ud in the full-bridge 
circuit, as against Ud/2 in the half-bridge circuit. Correspondingly, a 
change in the voltage also alters the maximum amplitude of the fun-
damental component of the output voltage, which is Ud when Ma = 1, 
according to Equation 7.3. In the case of overmodulation, when Ma > 1, the 
modulated voltage transforms to a rectangular form, when Ma > 3.2, and

Considering the influence of an active-inductive load on the electro-
magnetic processes in a voltage source inverter circuit, we notice that 
the fundamental component of the load current lags the fundamental 
component of the output voltage. That entails need of the energy flow 
changing from the load to the source. As a result, after reversing the 
fundamental component of voltage, the current continues to flow in the 
previous direction. Accordingly, the circuit contains diodes D1–D4, in 
parallel with switches S1–S4. We assume that the positive direction of 
the load current (iL > 0) corresponds to flow from node a to node b; or, 
in a half-bridge circuit, from node a to N. Then, in intervals in which 
the energy stored in the load inductances is extracted, the current iL is 
negative and passes through the antiparallel diodes, returning to the 
dc-voltage source Ud (Table 7.2). The time at which the current passes 
through zero (reverses its direction) depends on the load parameters. 
Taking only the fundamental components of the load current and­ 
­output voltage into consideration, this instant is determined by the 
load angle

where ω1 is the angular frequency of the fundamental components and L 
and R are the load inductance and resistance, respectively.
Obviously, the value of φL directly affects the distribution of the load 
current between the switches and diodes. For example, in the case of 
active load, no current flows through the diodes. If the load is inductive, in 
contrast, the mean value of the switch current is equal to the mean value 
of the diode current.

Power electronics basics
The spectrum of the output voltage is an important feature of 
PWM. For sinusoidal PWM, the output voltage contains harmonics of 
order n, determined by the frequency-modulation ratio Mf (Espinoza, 
2001)
	
n = eMf ± k,	
(7.9)
where k = 1, 3, 5, … when e = 2, 4, 6, … and k = 0, 2, 4, 6, … when e = 1, 3, 5, … 
for bipolar PWM and for unipolar PWM k = 1, 3, 5, … when e = 2, 4, 6, … .
Thus, the frequency spectrum of the output voltage in single-
phase inverters contains not only the first harmonic (frequency f1), but 
also multiples of Mf with associated frequencies, in accordance with 
Equation 7.9. The advantage of unipolar modulation is that the lowest 
order modulation harmonics will be of higher frequency, as in this case 
the harmonics are multiples of 2Mf. With an increase in Mf in the range 
from 0 to 1, the distortion of the output voltage falls significantly. That 
permits the use of light passive LC filters to obtain sinusoidal voltage 
practically.
The first harmonics of the output voltage are determined by the 
inverter input voltage Ud and, according to Equation 7.1, by the modula-
tion index Ma. For inverter operation with 0 ≤ Ma ≤ 1, the amplitude of the 
fundamental component of the output voltage is Uab1 < Ud. To increase 
this value without seriously impairing the spectrum of the output volt-
age, modified methods of sinusoidal PWM are employed. For example, 
various methods are based on comparison of a triangular carrier signal 
with a nonsinusoidal modulating signal um. Examples include the follow-
ing (Rashid, 1988):
•	 A trapezoidal modulating signal (Figure 7.5a)
•	 A stepped modulating signal (Figure 7.5b)
•	 A signal with harmonic injection (Figure 7.5c)
All these methods allow 5%–15% increase in the amplitude of the out-
put voltage, relative to that obtained by the sinusoidal PWM. The spec-
trum of the output voltage then permits an effective filtration of the higher 
harmonics.
With significant constraints on the modulation frequency, a selective 
harmonic elimination technique is successfully used. Usually, in this case, 
the low-frequency part of the voltage spectrum is eliminated: the third, 
fifth, and seventh harmonics. That follows from the dependence of the 
amplitude of higher harmonics on the pulse width of the output voltage, 
when its waveform features one pulse per half-cycle. If the width of volt-
age pulses is controlled, the spectrum of the output voltage satisfies the 
following expression:

where Ud is the input voltage of the inverter, n the number of harmonics, 
and δ the angular width of the voltage pulse within a half-period.
From Equation 7.10, we can see that, when δ = 2π/3, the third har-
monic is eliminated from the spectrum of the inverter output voltage. 
Then switching occurs twice in a half-cycle. If the number of switching 
and voltage pulses (N) per half-period increases, more harmonics may be 
suppressed. For single-phase inverters we can eliminate (N − 1) harmonics 
if output voltage has N pulses during half-period. For example, Figure 7.6

shows the inverter voltage waveform for bipolar modulation with N = 3 
and Ma = 0.5. In this case, the angles α1 = 22°, α2 = 55°, and α3 = 70° (δ1 = 33° 
and δ2 = 40°) and harmonics with n = 3 and n = 5 are eliminated from the 
spectrum. Correspondingly, when N = 4, harmonics with n = 3, 5, and 7 
are removed. With unipolar modulation, α and δ differ from the values for 
bipolar modulation. General techniques of selective harmonic elimination 
are considered in detail (Espinoza, 2001).
Hysteresis or Δ-modulation is widely used in practice. This provides 
(Hossein, 2002) relatively simple means of obtaining voltages and cur-
rents equal to a given reference. The simplest application of Δ-modulation 
is a pulse control used in dc–dc converters. Essentially, this involves 
tracking the controlled signal to follow a given reference signal within 
a permissible deviation. In the case of load current control in the voltage 
source inverter circuit, when the current becomes greater than the refer-
ence im ± ΔiL, the state of the converter switches is changed as shown in 
Figure 7.7. To receive a sinusoidal load current, the sinusoidal reference 
signal with the same frequency as the fundamental component is used. 
Usually, the width of the deviation band depends on the width of the hys-
teresis loop for the relay comparator that generates the switching pulses. 
A drawback of the technique is the switching frequency variation, which 
depends on the rate of change of the controlled signal (diL/dt). Thus, with 
a sinusoidal modulating signal im, the switching frequency is greater in

intervals where the sinusoid is close to its maximum value than in inter-
vals where it passes through zero (Figure 7.7). Special methods are used 
to stabilize the switching frequency. To prevent the appearance of low-
frequency harmonics, hysteresis modulation is usually employed at high 
Mf values.
7.2.1.2  Three-phase voltage source inverter
Figure 7.8 shows a topology of a three-phase voltage source inverter. 
Switches S1–S6 are identical to those in the single-phase inverters con-
sidered. The phase voltages uaN, ubN, and ucN may be considered relative 
to node N, where capacitors Cd are connected. In a balanced three-phase 
system, the voltages and currents are the same in each phase (except the 
phase shift) and add up to zero. The sum of their values for any two phases 
determines the voltage and current in the third phase. Thus, only two 
voltages and currents are independent. That must be taken into account 
in specifying the reference signals. In three-phase inverters, as in single-
phase inverters, the carrier-based PWM can be used by comparison of 
three sinusoidal modulating signals and triangular carrier signal.
For a three-phase inverter, there are eight valid switch states given in 
Table 7.3. States I–VI produce nonzero output voltages, whereas states VII 
and VIII correspond to zero phase-to-phase voltages. All these states are 
used to generate a given voltage by PWM. Changing of switch states 
depends on the ratio of the carrier and reference signals. So as to consider 
modulation in three-phase and single-phase systems within the same 
framework, we focus on the phase-to-phase voltage uab, equal to the differ-
ence between the voltages of phases a and b relative to node N (Figure 7.8). 
As the base node, we can choose any point of circuit. For example, it can

be a point of the negative dc-source terminal. Considering the node N, the 
voltage uab = uaN – ubN. According to Table 7.3, values of phase voltages uaN 
and ubN are as follows:
•	 When switch S1 is on, phase a is connected to the +Ud terminal, and 
uaN = Ud/2; when S4 is on, phase a is connected to the –Ud terminal, 
and uaN = –Ud/2.
•	 When switches S3 and S6 are on, ubN = Ud/2 and −Ud/2, respectively.
From Table 7.3, we can see that the states of switches S1, S3, and S5 are 
inverse to the states of switches S4, S6, and S2, respectively. That simplifies 
the realization of the control algorithm in voltage source inverters.
Figure 7.9 shows the waveforms of a three-phase inverter with sinusoi-
dal PWM. For PWM of the voltages uaN and ubN, the conditions of change 
in states of the switches can be written as
When umA(ϑ) > uc(ϑ), S1 is on, S4 is off; when umA(ϑ) < uc(ϑ), S1 is off, S4 
is on
When umB(ϑ) > uc(ϑ), S3 is on, S6 is off; when umB(ϑ) < uc(ϑ), S3 is off, S6 
is on
In accordance with these conditions, during the positive and negative 
half-cycles of the modulating signals umA and umB, the potentials of phases 
a and b are Ud/2, when S1 and S3 are on, and –Ud/2, when S1 and S3 are 
off (S4 and S6 are on).

with 0 ≤ Ma ≤ 1, may be written as

The frequency spectrum of the output line voltages has no harmonics 
which frequencies are multiple of three. The value of the carrier signal 
­frequency should be selected as an odd multiple of three (Mf = 9, 15, 21, …), 
rounding to an integer at small values of Mf.
In three-phase inverters, as in single-phase systems, the current load 
of the switches may be estimated from the mean value of current within a 
single period. Obviously, the mean current in switches S1–S6 and diodes 
D1–D6 correspond to segments of phase currents. Note that for an active-
inductive load, the current of the phase is distributed between the corre-
sponding switch and the parallel diode. Thus, the current flows from the 
dc source to the load through the switch and, on reversal, is returned to 
the source through the diode. The time of current reversal is determined 
by the phase-shift factor (cos φ) of the first harmonic of phase current

and voltage. Therefore, if we consider only the fundamental component 
of current, it is simple to calculate the static power losses in the switches 
and the diodes.
7.2.2  Current source inverters
Before the practical use of self-controlled power electronic devices, pulse 
modulation for current source inverters (CSIs) practically has no appli-
cation, because it was very difficult to realize modulation of dc current 
by use of the forced commutation of thyristors. However, self-controlled 
switches such as power transistors or gate turn-off thyristors (GTO) 
allow PWM in CSIs, as well as in voltage source inverters. The duality of 
CSIs and voltage source inverters enables us to apply practically identi-
cal PWM techniques. The duality of inverter circuits means the identity 
of output current and voltage waveforms using the same modulating 
techniques.
The significant difference between the PWM algorithms for voltage 
source inverters and CSIs is producing zero intervals in the output voltage 
and current waveforms, respectively. For example, zero-voltage intervals 
in a single-phase voltage source inverter shown in Figure 7.3 are produced 
when the upper (S1 and S3) or lower (S4 and S2) switches are on. Then the 
load is shorted and disconnected from the dc source Ud. Such switching is 
not applicable in a CSI circuit shown in Figure 7.10a, as the dc-side current 
Id must have short circuit at all times. Otherwise, the break in the circuit 
with inductor Ld results in a high-voltage surge.
Figure 7.10a shows a single-phase CSI based on unidirectional 
switches (e.g., GTOs). In the case of transistor switches, the series-­
connected diodes are used for reverse voltage blocking. Since we can 
have an inductive load, a capacitor should be connected to the output 
terminals of the CSI. The parallel capacitor absorbs energy when the 
switch states change. The equivalent circuit for steady inverter operation 
is shown in Figure 7.10b, in which the voltage source Ud and inductor 
Ld are replaced by the dc current source Id, although the switches and 
capacitive load are represented by a voltage source Uc. Zero load currents 
are produced when either switches S1 and S4 or switches S3 and S2 are 
on. The current Id freewheels through these switches, and the voltage 
Uc is reduced to zero; in other words, the current source is shorted by 
the conducting switches. When the switches S1 and S2 are on, the load 
current is positive. The current iL = −Id when S3 and S4 are on. Thus, the 
load current is equal to +Id, 0, and −Id. In order to produce a required cur-
rent waveform, we should switch these values of current, according to a 
specific algorithm. Using PWM techniques similar to the one developed 
for voltage source inverters, we can generate sinusoidal ac current. To 
reduce the modulating harmonics, the output CL filters are used, and the 

321
Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
capacitors are connected to an ac side of the inverter. The output current 
waveform for sinusoidal PWM is shown in Figure 7.11.
Single-phase CSIs are not widely used in practice. However, three-
phase CSIs (Figure 7.12) are used in electric drive applications. Therefore, 
it is important to ensure sinusoidal output voltage. For this purpose, the 
sinusoidal PWM of output currents is used. Table 7.4 presents the valid 
switch states and the current values for a three-phase CSI. In contrast to 
a voltage source inverter, there are three zero states (VII, VIII, and IX) 
that correspond to zero values of the phase currents. In these states, the 
switches of one leg are on, that is, S1 and S4, S3 and S6, or S5 and S2.
Another significant difference between a CSI and a voltage source 
inverter is that the output voltage depends directly on the load. The

CSI and the first harmonic of line voltage in the voltage source inverter 
depend on Ma in the same way.
Note that control of zero interval width in the phase current wave-
form can be used to selectively eliminate low-order harmonics in the cur-
rent spectrum, similar to the one performed in voltage source inverters.
7.2.3  SV modulation
Transformation of three-phase signals to a two-phase frame simplifies 
voltage and current control in three-phase converters. In addition, such 
transformation of coordinates is used in digital control systems of ac 
motors by frequency converters (ac voltage controllers). Therefore, SV 
modulation technique in three-phase voltage-source converters is widely 
used (Kazmierkowski et al., 2001; Akagi, 2002). The SV PWM is based on 
representation of three-phase voltage signals in the stationary αβ frame as 
vectors with discrete phase change, in accordance with the switch states 
of the converter (Table 7.3). There are eight valid states that correspond to 
defined values of output line voltages. In the case of SV modulation, the 
inverter model in a complex plane is used, instead of the model in phase 
coordinates. Thus, it is necessary to generate space voltage vector, which 
corresponds to the required line voltages. In order to produce three sinu-
soidal voltages during one cycle (the rotating reference SV), six nonzero 
vectors (switch states) are used consecutively in each sampling period. 
The sampling frequency can be regarded as the carrier frequency, as in 
sinusoidal PWM. The SV-modulation strategy using the αβ stationary 
frame (Section 3.1.4) is considered in detail in the following.
Table 7.5 presents the switch states for a bridge circuit of a voltage 
source converter (Figure 7.13a) and the corresponding values of SVs for

output voltages ua, ub, and uc (Figure 7.13b). The waveforms shown in 
Figure 7.13b illustrate 180° switching algorithm, when each switch is on 
during an interval π. The on state of each switch in the upper group (S1, 
S3, S5) corresponds to an off state of switches in the lower group (S4, S6, S2) 
and vice versa (Figure 7.13a). The numbering of states is of no fundamen-
tal significance, but their sequence must strictly correspond to the alterna-
tion of voltages ua, ub, and uc. Each state corresponds to an interval of π/3. 
In other words, there is a discrete change in the states of switches S1–S6 
at the boundary of these intervals. Note that only the six active (nonzero) 
states are used; the zero states, in which the output voltages are zero, are 
disregarded. Therefore, in the αβ plane, we can identify six vectors U1–U6 
corresponding to the position of the voltage SV at the boundaries where 
the states of switches S1–S6 change. As a result, six sectors bounded by the 
vectors U1–U6 are formed on the αβ plane (Figure 7.14a). The ends of the 
vectors can be connected by straight lines forming a regular hexagon. The 
center of the hexagon, which combines the starting points of the vectors, 
corresponds to zero vectors U7 and U8.
During the cycle of fundamental output voltages ua, ub, and uc, con-
secutive change in sectors occurs, as shown in Figure 7.13c, and the SV 
US (Figure 7.14a) is moved within each sector from one state to another 
(U1–U2–U3–U4–U5–U6). Modulus of the rotating vector US is equal to the 
amplitude of sinusoidal voltages ua, ub, and uc. The active (nonzero) vector

the modulation index Ma. In general, these modulating signals are gener-
ated for each phase in order to produce a three-phase system of converter 
output voltages. Otherwise, in SV PWM, essentially only the reference 
SV is a resulting modulating signal to generate all output voltages of the 
three-phase converter. In sinusoidal PWM, the switching signals can be 
received using an analog comparator. In SV PWM, in contrast, a digital 
control system is used to calculate the sampling period and the switching 
times. The range of fc is approximately the same in the SV and the sinusoi-
dal PWM techniques.
To produce the required voltages in SV PWM, the reference volt-
age SV is averaged within each of six sectors. For sector k, this is done 
by switching of nearest active vectors (Uk and Uk+1) and one zero vector 
(U7 or U8). In this case, the voltage vectors are summed, but the time of 
using for each vector should be taken into account. The relative value of 
used time γk for SV Uk can be regarded as the duty ratio in PWM dc–dc 
converters. Correspondingly, the time of vector Uk using is defined as 
tk = γk ⋅ TS, where TS = 1/fc is the sampling period of the carrier signal. As 
only three states are used in each sampling period, we can write the fol-
lowing expression:
	
tk + tk+1 + t7 + t8 = TS,	
(7.14)
where tk and tk+1 are the times during which vectors Uk and Uk+1 are used 
and t7 and t8 are the using times for zero vectors U7 and U8.
The reference SV US rotates at the angular frequency (ωm) of the 
­output voltage in the αβ stationary frame. For a balanced phase voltage, 
the modulus and phase of this vector are completely determined by its 
components USα and USβ. In that case, the times t2 and t3 in the second 
­sector can be calculated from the trigonometric relations for vectors USα,

USβ and γ2U2, γ3U3. These vectors of sector 2 are shown in Figure 7.14b, 
which allows us to calculate t2 and t3 taking into account the phase angle θ 
of the vector US. Since the modulation frequency fc is considerably greater 
than the voltage frequency fm, we can regard the parameters of vector US 
as constant over the period TS. According to Figure 7.14b,

Similarly, to calculate t2 and t3 values for phase angle θ in sector 2, 
switching times tk and tk+1 are defined for sector k. Thus, the reference 
voltage SV US is the sum of the averaged values of the nearest active 
vectors and zero vector Uz during the sampling period in each sector 
k: US = γkUk + γk+1Uk+1 + γzUz. The amplitude of the modulating vector US is 
controlled by variation in the modulation index Ma. Modulation of the SV 
allows us to generate the given converter output voltages in accordance 
with the inverse abc/αβ transformation (Section 3.1.4)

There are many variants of SV PWM algorithms, in which different 
vector sequences and different zero vectors can be used within a sampling 
period. Often, the method of symmetrical position of active and zero vec-
tors within the modulation period TS is shown in Figure 7.15. During the 
first half-period, the sequence Uz–Uk–Uk+1–Uz is used, whereas in the sec-
ond half-period, we have the reverse sequence Uz–Uk+1–Uk–Uz. The zero 
SVs Uz is alternately chosen among U7 and U8. In that case, we can write 
the following expression for the second sector (with appropriate modifica-
tion for other sectors):

Another switching algorithm features using only one zero vec-
tor (U7 or U8) in each modulation period. Any method should provide 
reducing of the switching frequency and undesirable harmonics. Some 
switching algorithms enable to reduce the switching frequency fc by 
33%, without deterioration of the modulation efficiency. In addition, 
the switching losses may be reduced by 30%, depending on the load 
power factor.
In SV modulation, the range of the output voltage is limited by the 
maximum value of the modulation index. In Figure 7.14a, the region

7.3  Power quality control on the basis 
of PWM converters
7.3.1  Functional capabilities of PWM converters
The advance in self-commutated fast-speed power electronic switches 
permits pulse control of currents and voltages and their modulation, 
according to any given reference signal. This fundamentally changes 
the functional capabilities of converters. Previously, converters based on 
silicon-controlled rectifiers (thyristors) were predominantly used for con-
version from one type of electric power to another, for example, from ac 
to dc or from dc to ac. That was accompanied by distortion of the mains 
current and consumption of reactive power. The PWM control and the 
ability to operate in four quadrants (in the rectifier and inverter mode, 
with any phase shift between the mains current and voltage) signifi-
cantly allow expanding of functional capabilities of the ac–dc converters. 
Such converters have no drawbacks featured to line-commutated con-
verters based on thyristors. Thus, PWM converters based on self-com-
mutated switches become the basis for development of multifunctional 
power quality controllers. Thus, power electronics today provides to 
solve many urgent problems of electrical power engineering, referred to 
energy saving.
The capabilities of ac–dc pulse-width modulated converters based on 
self-controlled power electronic devices include the following:
	
1.	Ensuring of sinusoidal mains currents in the rectifier mode and 
sinusoidal load voltages in the inverter mode
	
2.	Correction of the power factor of consumers, power line, or source
	
3.	Compensation of reactive power (inductive or capacitive)
	
4.	Stabilization of the load voltage
	
5.	Active filtering of current or voltage harmonics in the power system
	
6.	Hybrid filtering (combination of active and passive filters) of the cur-
rent or voltage harmonics in the power system
	
7.	Compensation of unbalanced currents and voltages in a three-phase 
power system on the basis of an elimination of reverse-sequence and 
zero-sequence currents or voltages
	
8.	Transfer of electric energy between the power system and energy 
storages of different types

7.3.2  Operation modes of ac–dc PWM converters
7.3.2.1  Inversion
In Chapter 4, we considered the operation of line-commutated ac–dc con-
verters implemented with thyristors, without modulation of the output 
parameters. The ac of such converters is nonsinusoidal, which deterio-
rates their compatibility with the ac mains and limits their application. 
The development of high-frequency self-commutated power electronic 
devices permits the elimination of such problems using PWM. The 
advantages of ac–dc grid-connected PWM inverters are considered in 
this chapter.
Traditionally, converters used for inversion have a smoothing induc-
tor on the dc side, which is a characteristic feature of CSIs. This inductor 
is a required element of the converter circuit because of the difference 
in the instantaneous values of dc side and ac voltages (Figure 7.16). With 
high values of inductance Ld and without PWM, we have square-wave 
phase converter currents. This can result in distortion of the mains volt-
age. Because of the high amplitudes of low-frequency current harmonics, 
heavy filters must be used. The use of sinusoidal PWM of phase currents 
significantly reduces the required power of the output filters in current 
source converters.
In the case of a voltage source converter circuit, its inverter opera-
tion mode requires an inductive output filter, because of the periodic 
connection of ac and dc sources with different voltages (Figure 7.17). In 
CSIs, these circuits are separated by the dc-side inductor Ld, which lim-
its the rate of current change. In voltage source inverters, these induc-
tors are components of the output LC filters, smoothing the ripples due 
to PWM at high frequency. In the given converters, the inductance Lf is 
used to smooth the current waveform due to the instantaneous differ-
ence in voltages Ud and uS. At high modulation frequency, the low value 
of inductance is necessary. In inverters without sinusoidal PWM, the high 
inductance is required, which results in significant deterioration of con-
verter performance. Therefore, ac–dc converters based on a voltage source 
inverter without PWM are of no practical use. The main characteristics of 
ac–dc converters based on current-source and voltage-source inverters are 
considered in more detail in the following. As an example, single-phase 
converter circuits are compared.

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
7.3.2.2  Current source converters
In this case, a CL filter is connected on the ac side of the converter to 
remove modulating harmonics of the output current ic, as shown in 
Figure 7.16a. Figure 7.16b shows the waveforms of sinusoidal mains volt-
age and modulated converter current ic. This current can be written as a

source converter, the fault protection of the switches—for example, in the 
case of a short-circuit on the ac side—can be ensured relatively simply. 
Another benefit of the circuit is that it operates effectively with induc-
tive energy storages. However, the drawback of the current source con-
verter is the inertial variation of dc-side current due to the inductance 
Ld. Figure 7.16c shows a simplified block diagram of the converter current 
control as a function of the modulation index Ma. This figure corresponds 
to small deviations of parameters (ΔMa and Δic1). The dynamic characteris-
tics of the converter in this case are mainly determined by the value of the 
inductance Ld, as shown in Figure 7.16c as the integral unit in the operator 
form. The effect of the CL filter on the dynamics is significantly less than 
that of the inductance Ld and is not shown in Figure 7.16c.
7.3.2.3  Voltage source converters
In this case, the filter inductor Lf is the main element smoothing the cur-
rent due to the difference in the modulated converter voltage uab and 
mains voltage uS (Figure 7.17a and b). When the ac-source power consider-
ably exceeds the converter power, the converter current harmonics (except 
the fundamental) can be approximately presented by a harmonic series

where Uabn is the amplitude of the nth voltage harmonic.
As we can see from Equation 7.21 in the present case, in contrast to 
the current source converter, the amplitudes of the current harmonics are 
determined by the inductance Lf. Accordingly, this filter inductance must 
be greater than that in a CSI. At the same time, because of high modu-
lation frequency, the inductance Lf is considerably less than the induc-
tance Ld in Figure 7.16a. Therefore, the control of the output current is less 
inertial. The block diagram of the converter current control is shown in 
Figure 7.17c. This is often the main benefit of the voltage source converter 
when compared with the current source converter.
Concluding this brief comparison of different ac–dc converters, both 
types of PWM converters based on self-controlled switches can ensure the 
four-quadrant operation. The rectifier mode of ac–dc converters is consid-
ered in the following.
7.3.2.4  Rectification
PWM in the rectifier mode is used to increase the power factor, by reduc-
ing both the reactive power of the fundamental current and the distortion 
power (i.e., the decrease in mains current harmonics). For this purpose, 
self-commutated ac–dc converters can be used. In the rectifier mode, the 

334
Power electronics basics
phase of the fundamental current is shifted in accordance with position-
ing of the current vector in the second and third quadrants of the com-
plex plane. Note that rectification and inversion in thyristor-based ac–dc 
converters generally were implemented with current source converter cir-
cuits. Grid-connected voltage source converters (Figure 7.17a) have been 
adopted with the development of self-controlled devices. The relation 
between the fundamental current and voltage is best seen in a vector dia-
gram. The fundamental current and voltage are represented as complex 
amplitudes, assuming the sinusoidal waveform of mains voltage and zero 
current of the filter capacitor Cf:

where Uab1 is the complex amplitude of the fundamental converter volt-
age and Ic1 is the complex amplitude of the fundamental converter current 
(Figure 7.17a).
Assuming the mains voltage vector US as the base, the vector diagram 
for four-quadrant operation is obtained (Figure 7.18) using Equation 7.22. 
Depending on the phase of converter current Ic1, we have rectification 
regions (II and III), whereas regions I and IV correspond to the inverter 
operation mode. In Figure 7.18, circle 1 is the locus of the ends of the vector 
Uab1 with phase variation of the current vector Ic1 in the range 0 < φ < 2π. 
Circle 2 is the locus of the ends of the current vector Ic1. It follows from 
Equation 7.22 that the radius of circle 1 is equal to the inductor Lf voltage 
ΔUL = ω1LfIc1. From Figure 7.18, we can see that, when the current Ic1 leads 
the mains voltage (regions III and IV), the converter voltage Uab1 is less 
than the mains voltage US due to the inductor voltage

7.3.2.5  Reactive power control
Converter operation at the boundary of regions I–II and III–IV corre-
sponds to the exchange of reactive power with the mains. The gener-
ated power is inductive at the boundary I–II, and at the boundary III–IV, 
the converter generates the capacitive reactive power. Such operation is 
used to regulate the reactive power in the mains or to compensate reac-
tive power of a specific type. For example, in power transmission, the 
inductance of the line produces reactive power, whose compensation 
requires capacitive power. If there is an excess of capacitive reactive 
power in the mains, a source of inductive power is required for its com-
pensation. In converters operating as reactive power compensators, the 
dc source can be a capacitor or inductive energy storage. In that case, 
of course, active power is required only for compensation of the active 

335
Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
power losses in the converter circuit, including the energy storage. The 
converter consumes this low active power from the mains. Therefore, 
in the reactive power control mode, the converter operation region in 
Figure 7.18 is close to the boundaries I–II and III–IV in the rectification 
area. In Figure 7.18, this is represented by the shading along the bound-
aries in quadrants II and III.
Thus, the application of force-commutated switches and PWM enables 
ac–dc converter operation in the rectifier or inverter mode, with leading 
or lagging power factor. This is possible for the voltage source converter 
as well as for the current source converter. This capability is important 
for the development of power electronic devices with low environmental 
impact that do not produce neither current and voltage harmonics nor 
reactive power at the fundamental frequency.
The ability to regulate capacitive reactive power is very important 
in reducing the power losses in distribution power systems that feature 
inductive load currents. In other words, reactive power compensators 
allow an increase in the power factor.

7.3.3  Active power filters
7.3.3.1  Principle of active filtering
Traditionally, in electrical engineering, undesirable current or voltage har-
monics were reduced by means of passive filters. Such filters are a combi-
nation of inductive (L) and capacitive (C) elements connected in different 
circuits with specified topology. As the electrical impedance of the passive 
filters is frequency-dependent, they change the harmonic composition of 
nonsinusoidal currents and voltages. In systems connected to a power 
converter, the filters mainly ensure sinusoidal voltage (current) in the ac 
circuits and reduce the ripple in the dc circuit. Examples of such filters 
have been considered in sufficient detail in previous chapters. Although 
passive filters are simple in design, they have two primary disadvantages:
	
1.	Limited functional capabilities on account of the circuit topology 
and the parameters of its components
	
2.	Uncontrollability
These problems significantly reduce the effectiveness of passive fil-
ters in changing the harmonic composition of the current (voltage), espe-
cially with frequency variation and with variation in the grid parameters. 
In addition, transient processes in the system may give overvoltage and 
overcurrent. A deficiency of passive filters is their sensitivity to variation 
in their own parameters, for example, on account of aging.
In contrast to passive filters, active power filters contain controllable 
components such as transistors, so that the frequency characteristics can 
be regulated. However, until recently, no components were available for 
the creation of active power filters in power electronics.
At the beginning of the 1970s, the first low-power active power filters 
were produced on the basis of analog integrated circuits. They were used 
in microelectronic components for information and control systems.
The modern generation of self-controlled high-speed switches (based 
on transistors and GTOs) provides the basis for new devices: active power 
filters (Akagi, 2002).
7.3.3.2  Active filters for power conditioning
According to IEC standards, an active power filter is defined as a converter 
for filtration. This term is very general and does not characterize the signifi-
cant features of the filter. However, before we offer a more specific defini-
tion, we need to delineate the boundaries within which the corresponding 
devices fall. First, we are talking about ac filters, as active power filters are 
not widely used in dc power circuits and are found predominantly in sec-
ondary power sources of relatively low power. As a rule, moreover, dc fil-
ters are based not on converters but on electrical signal amplifiers. In what 

337
Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
follows, we will refer to such filters as active dc filters. In view of the fore-
going, we may present a more specific definition of active power filters as 
follows. An active (power) filter is an ac–dc converter with capacitive or 
inductive energy storage on the dc side, which produces a current (volt-
age) equal to the difference between the nonlinear current (voltage) and the 
fundamental sinusoidal current (voltage), by pulse modulation. Of course, 
active filtering can also be performed by devices with more number of func-
tions. For example, a converter can compensate the fundamental reactive 
power and filter out higher harmonics. In that case, the expanded functions 
should be reflected by a hybrid term (e.g., a filter–compensator). We now 
consider the operation principle of active power filters in more detail.
On the basis of their circuit and control principles, we divide active 
power filters into current sources and voltage sources. In Figure 7.19, we 
show simplified equivalent circuits with active power filters in the form of 
voltage sources (uAF) and current sources (iAF). In Figure 7.19a, the power 
source us has a nonsinusoidal voltage. To ensure sinusoidal voltage uL at 
the load terminals, we connect an active power filter, corresponding to 
an equivalent voltage source uAF, in series with the power source. For this 
circuit, we can write the following general relations:

where IL1 and φi1 are the amplitude and initial phase of the sinusoidal load 
current, respectively.
It follows from Equation 7.24 that, under the given assumptions, 
the active power filter has no influence on the active power balance in 
the source–load system. At the same time, it is directly involved in the 
exchange of distortion power with the nonsinusoidal voltage source. The 
distortion power is inactive and circulates, in the present case, between 
the distortion source and the section of line connecting the source and 
the active power filter. The active power filter, which accepts and emits 
energy due to voltage distortion, is electric energy storage: a capacitor 
or inductor.
The nonsinusoidal current iL, induced by a nonlinear load, as a rule, is 
removed by means of an active power filter that generates a nonsinusoidal 
current equal to the difference between its input current iL and the funda-
mental harmonic iL1. This active power filter is usually connected in paral-
lel to the nonlinear load. The point of filter connection is usually selected 
as close as possible to the load terminal (Figure 7.19b). Under our assump-
tion that there are no power losses in the active power filter, we can write

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
where In and φin are the amplitude and initial phase of the nth current har-
monic, and U1 and φ1 are the amplitude and initial phase of the sinusoidal 
load voltage.
According to Equation 7.25, a shunt active power filter generating 
current to compensate the load distortion power has no influence on the 
active power balance in the source–load system. However, in contrast to a 
series active power filter, the distortion power is exchanged between the 
nonlinear load and the active power filter.
It follows from Equations 7.24 and 7.25 that active power filters can 
be ac–dc converters, capable of producing a given nonsinusoidal ac cur-
rent or voltage. Then, for the exchange of the nonactive power with the 
mains, capacitive or inductive energy storages can be used. Obviously, 
in the general case, such active power filters may ensure the exchange of 
nonactive power, including the first-harmonic reactive power. As, under 
the given assumptions, the average value of power on the ac side of the 
filter over the period of the fundamental harmonic is zero, there is no 
need for a source or consumer of active power on the dc side of the active 
power filter. Obviously, converters generating the required nonsinusoidal 
current or voltage must be based on self-controlled high-speed switches 
for which PWM is possible.
7.3.3.3  Active power filter circuits
Depending on the type of storage, the basic circuit of the active power fil-
ters will include a current source converter or a voltage source converter. 
We now consider the operation of an active power filter for the example of 
single-phase circuits in which energy is stored in an inductor (Figure 7.20a) 
or a capacitor (Figure 7.21a).
Figure 7.20a shows the active filter based on CSI with inductor Ld on 
its dc side. Switches VT1–VT4 are controlled by pulse modulation. As a 
result, the sequence of current pulses iAF is produced at the output of the 
active power filter, according to the specified control principle. After this 
current is passed through a CL filter, a waveform of current iAF corre-
sponds to the current-modulating reference signal. In Figure 7.20b, as an 
example, the mains voltage uab and the current of the active power filter 
are shown in the case of generating an output current iAF equal to the sum 
of the third and fifth harmonics. In Figure 7.20b, we assume a conven-
tionally idealized circuit, neglecting the ripple of current Id (Ld = ∞). By 
adjusting the modulating function, we can obtain different waveforms 
of the output current. The basic limit on the precision in reproducing 
required current is the converter modulation frequency fm. In the first 
approximation, it is assumed that fm is at least 10 times greater than the 
maximum frequency of harmonic being generated. Another demand is 
the absence of active power at the output of the active power filter. The 
active power unbalance between the active filter and the mains leads to 

340
Power electronics basics
an increase or a decrease in the inductor storage current Id (or the voltage 
Ud of a capacitive storage).
An active power filter with a capacitive storage (Figure 7.21a) is based 
on a voltage source converter. Therefore, it is dual with respect to the 
topology shown in Figure 7.20a. Accordingly, the output voltage uab pro-
duced in Figure 7.21a and the output current iAF produced in Figure 7.20a 
will be similar. Figure 7.21b shows the output current waveform in the 
case of generating the third and fifth current harmonics. The control sys-
tem of the converter must regulate the output voltage, which depends on 
the reference nonsinusoidal current.
In Figures 7.20 and 7.21, the active power filters are connected in par-
allel to the mains and can be represented as equivalent sources of nonsi-
nusoidal current. The same circuits can be connected in series with the 
mains and will then be presented as equivalent sources of nonsinusoidal 
voltage. When an active power filter with an inductive storage is connected 
in series with the mains (usually through a transformer), an impedance 
ZAF must be connected to the filter output, so as to ensure the flow of the 
fundamental load current iL in the circuit consisting of the voltage source 
uS and the load ZL (Figure 7.22). That is a consequence of the high internal

the impedance added will slightly reduce the fundamental mains voltage.

ducting inductive storage are unsurpassed in the compensation of reac-
tive power or distortion power and also provide a power reserve when 
the mains voltage disappears. In such conditions, of course, we consider 
high-power filter-compensation systems (Rozanov and Lepanov, 2012).
In Figures 7.23 and 7.24, single-phase active power filters with a capaci-
tive storage are shown. The shunt topology (Figure 7.23) is usually employed 
to eliminate current distortion due to nonlinear load, for example, a recti-
fier with considerable inductance on the dc side. For more efficient filtering, 
the active power filter is connected directly to the terminals of the nonlin-
ear load. In the absence of an active power filter, the distorted load current 
results in a voltage drop at the mains impedance. As a result, the voltage at 
the terminals of various consumers will be nonsinusoidal. To eliminate or 
reduce the current distortion, the active power filter connected to the ter-
minals of the load generates a current iAF, which is subtracted from the dis-
torted load current iL. The resultant mains current is sinusoidal and equal 
to the fundamental component of the load current iL1, in accordance with 
Equation 7.25. Figure 7.23b illustrates these current waveforms.
As already noted, the active power filter may not only eliminate cur-
rent harmonics, but also compensate the reactive power of the fundamen-
tal current at a nonlinear consumer. In that case, the maximum power of 
the active filter is determined by the maximum sum of the compensated 
and filtered currents. The parameters of basic circuit components are cal-
culated by the methods used for PWM voltage source inverters.

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
Figure 7.24 shows a series active power filter with a capacitive storage. 
In this case, the active filter ensures a sinusoidal voltage at the load in the 
case of a distorted (nonsinusoidal) source voltage uS. Essentially, the series 
active power filter is a high-frequency voltage booster, which permits the 
required voltage waveform to be produced. Note, however, that an active 
filter with energy storage cannot generate or consume active power over a 
long period, on account of the lack of corresponding sources or sinks. At 
the same time, the series active filter enables to eliminate low-frequency 
voltage fluctuations or brief voltage drops. That permits expansion of its 
functions. For example, a structure consisting of shunt and series active 
power filters is widely used (Figure 7.25). In this structure, the shunt active 
filter is used not only for filtering and reactive power compensation, but 
also as a dc voltage source Ud, ensuring active power exchange between 
the ac mains and the series active filter. Accordingly, the series filter can 
be used as a voltage regulator at the ac terminals.
7.3.3.4  dc active filters
As already noted, dc active filters are not widely used, mainly because 
there are many other options for eliminating dc ripple. At the same 
time, such active filters can be successfully employed with low-power dc 
sources. For example, they can be used in circuits with ac voltage genera-
tors in counterphase with the ripple voltage. Figure 7.26 shows equivalent 
circuits including active filters based on ac generators of current- or volt-
age-source type. In these circuits, if we assume ideal filtering of the ripple, 
the following conditions must be satisfied:

resonance phenomena in series and parallel circuits containing capacitors 
and inductors. Passive filters differ in circuits and correspondingly in fre-
quency characteristics. It is conventional to distinguish between detuned 
and tuned passive filters. Detuned filters have a resonance below the fre-
quency of the harmonic being filtered out. The degree of detuning is cal-
culated as

(7.27)
where ω1 and ωn are the angular frequencies of the fundamental com-
ponent (the first harmonic) and the filtered (nth) current or voltage 
harmonic.
Usually, δ = 5%–15%, depending on the distortion of the filtered 
parameters. Detuned filters are designed not only for the elimination 
of higher harmonics, but also for reactive power compensation at the 
fundamental harmonic. As the frequency of the filtered harmonic is 
above the tuned frequency in detuned filters, resonance in the grid–
filter system is practically impossible. Usually, the primary function 
of a detuned filter is reactive power compensation at the fundamen-
tal harmonic; the filter capacitance is selected on that basis. The filter 
inductor can be considered as a capacitor current limiter and provides 
its protection in transient processes associated with fluctuation in the 
grid voltage.
Tuned filters are used to eliminate the harmonics at the filter resonant 
frequency. Although in this case there is a reactive power compensation at 
the fundamental frequency, it is not the main factor in selecting the filter 
parameters. Rather, the selection criterion is minimum filter size or cost. 
In this case, the capacitance is considerably less than that in a detuned fil-
ter, which is chosen for purposes of reactive power compensation. Tuned 
filters are widely used to ensure sinusoidal voltage and current and to 
reduce pulsations in power converters.
Passive filters are simple and reliable devices for enhancing power 
quality. However, they have a significant drawback: their parameters are 
not controllable. As a result, it is impossible to meet all the contradic-
tory requirements in different operating conditions and to correct filter 
parameters.
An important parameter of a passive filter is the quality factor Q, 
which is the ratio of the maximum energy stored in the reactive compo-
nents (capacitor or inductor) to the energy dissipated in the filters’ active 
elements. It follows from this definition that the quality factor can be 
described by various analytical expressions. In particular, for a series-
resonant circuit (Figure 7.27a)

346

(7.28)
where ρ =

f  is the characteristic circuit impedance (filter reactance) 
and Rf is the equivalent resistance of the filter.
The quality factor determines the increase in voltage at the capaci-
tor Cf and inductor Lf, relative to the voltage applied to the filter circuit. 
With an increase in Q, the slope of frequency dependence of the total filter 
impedance increases, whereas the bandwidth relative to the resonant fre-
quency ωr decreases (Figure 7.27b). This gives the contradictory require-
ments to filter parameters, especially in steady-state operation. On the one 
hand, an increase in the quality factor Q results in more efficient filter-
ing at the tuned frequency ωr; on the other hand, the negative impact of 
frequency detuning on the filter impedance is increased. Such frequency 
deviation can result from aging of the filter components or the impact of 
the ambient temperature. The frequency of the harmonic can also deviate 
from ωr. In addition, besides loss of efficiency, ­antiresonance can emerge, 
in which the filter impedance increases at the antiresonance frequency, 
with an increase in the corresponding voltage harmonic at the terminals 
of the power system. This is associated with a current resonance in a par-
allel circuit containing grid inductance LS, to which the filter is connected, 
as in Figure 7.28a. In that case, neglecting the active impedance Rf, we can 
write the antiresonance frequency ωar as

Chapter seven:  Pulse-width modulation and power quality control
It is evident from Equation 7.29 that when the filter is connected to a 
grid with a high-power source—in other words, with low LS—the antires-
onance frequency is close to the resonance frequency ωr. That can result in 
a sharp increase in the corresponding voltage or current harmonics in the 
grid and filter (Figure 7.28b) and hence lead to various extremely undesir-
able consequences such as failure of the filter capacitor or breakdown of 
the insulation. The negative consequences of antiresonance are worse at 
high values of Q.
Thus, even under steady-state conditions, we need to find compro-
mises in selecting the quality factor Q of a passive filter. In addition, the 
quality factor has a considerable influence on the transient processes in 
the power supply system. Perturbations in this system due to commuta-
tion of the load, external voltage surges, or change in the operating condi-
tions will be associated with transient processes, in which the voltages 
and currents deviate considerably from their steady values. The presence 
of passive filters with reactive components not only prolongs such pro-
cesses, but also produces considerable voltage and current surges. With 
weak damping of the resonance circuits—in other words, high value of 
Q—these phenomena can result in failure of the whole power supply sys-
tem. Therefore, passive filters sometimes include additional resistive com-
ponents, which reduce the quality factor but eliminate overvoltages and 
current surges in the system.
7.3.4.2  Regulation of passive filters
Theoretical and practical developments in active filtering offer the pos-
sibility of control of the parameters of passive filters. The suitability of 
active filters for these purposes is obvious if the following factors are con-
sidered. First, purely active power filters are based on high-power compo-
nents, as the filter power is determined by the total power of the nonlinear 
load. Therefore, the high cost of active power filters constrains their use.

Power electronics basics
Secondly, passive filters, which are traditional devices for enhancing the 
power quality, do not require new manufacturing technologies and are 
compatible with practically all existing power systems. In recent years, 
various methods have been developed for control passive filters on the 
basis of active power filters, which permit us to adjust their parameters. 
In such applications, the power of the active filters employed is at least 
an order of magnitude less than that of an active power filter. In addi-
tion, automatic correction of the passive filter parameters in the course of 
operation is feasible. The combination of passive and active power filters 
is known as hybrid filters.
The operation of a hybrid filter is based on the generation current or 
voltage in order to modify frequency characteristics of the passive filter 
and to improve its compensation characteristics. This device is based on 
active power filters, that is, on self-controlled ac–dc converters with PWM. 
Figure 7.29 shows the main hybrid filter topologies. Parallel connection 
of active and passive filters is most commonly employed. The produc-
ing of modulated voltage or current of an active filter can be considered 
as change in its instantaneous input impedance zAF(t) due to the average

where m(t) is the modulating function (smooth component) and Ud is the 
average voltage on the dc side of the active filter (at the capacitive storage).
It follows from Equation 7.30 that, with an appropriate modulating 
function m(t), we can ensure that dzAF(t)/dt = 0. This is equivalent to an 
active impedance Re, which can be positive or negative. Positive Re corre-
sponds to energy consumption from the grid and negative Re to power gen-
eration. Variation in zAF (t) with zero average value over the period of the 
fundamental frequency corresponds to the exchange of nonactive power 
(reactive and distortion power) between the active filter and the system 
with passive filter. Thus, by adjusting m(t), we can vary zAF (t) so as to obtain 
the required frequency characteristic of the hybrid filter. Such control can 
be considered as the introduction of equivalent impedance in the passive 
filter. The basic constraints in the present case are the frequency character-
istics of the switches and the storage capacitance. That capacitance limits 
the rate of energy variation to realize the equivalent impedance. The char-
acter of the equivalent impedance zAF (t) is determined by the topology of 
the hybrid filter, the regulator input signal, and the modulating function. 
Note that the connection point of this impedance in the equivalent circuit 
need not be the same as its actual position in the circuit.
Active filter-based regulator in the structure of a hybrid filter results 
in the following possibilities:
•	 More efficient filtering under steady-state operation, by correction of 
the frequency characteristic
•	 Reduced impact of fluctuation in the filter parameters and the fre-
quency of the filtered harmonic
•	 Elimination of antiresonance in the power-supply system at fre-
quencies close to the filtered harmonic
•	 Damping of undesirable resonant phenomena due to the passive fil-
ter elements
•	 Decrease in the grid current harmonics from various sources
The improvements made possible by the hybrid filter depend on the 
spectral composition of the regulator input signal. To improve the opera-
tion of a passive filter at the tuned frequency, it is sufficient to track the 
input signal harmonic of that frequency. Accordingly, the power of the 
active filter components can be considerably less than when monitoring 

350
Power electronics basics
the whole frequency spectrum. In addition, signal modulation is simpli-
fied. At the same time, the damping of resonant phenomena in the system 
is possible only when the input signal of the hybrid filter regulator has a 
broad spectrum. The control methods and circuits for hybrid filters take 
very diverse forms but have much in common with active power filters 
(Rozanov and Grinberg 2006).
7.3.5  Balancing of currents in a three-phase system
When the load contains single-phase consumers, unbalanced phase cur-
rents appear in three-phase power systems. That leads to voltage unbal-
ance, overloading of the phase lines, and increased power losses in the 
transmission lines. For load balancing, we can effectively use a compen-
sator based on a four-quadrant converter with self-controlled switches 
(Kiselev and Rozanov 2012; Kiselev and Tserkovskiy 2012). In reactive 
power compensation and harmonics filtering, the compensation of unbal-
anced currents does not require active power, as the unbalance is charac-
terized by nonactive power.
Figure 7.30 shows the connection of an unbalanced current com-
pensator to a four-wire power system. The compensator is based on 
a three-phase ac–dc converter with a capacitive storage on the dc side. 
To eliminate unbalance of the phase currents in a three-phase system 
without a neutral line, the compensator must generate reverse-sequence

currents in opposite phase to the reverse-sequence currents of the load. In 
that case, the oscillatory component (100 Hz) of the instantaneous power 
is exchanged between the compensator capacitors (C) and the load. In the 
case of a four-wire system with a neutral, the compensator additionally 
generates zero-sequence currents. A loop for zero-sequence current flow 
between the load and the compensator is made by connecting the neu-
tral between the compensator capacitors. Complete compensation of the 
zero-sequence currents results in zero current in the neutral between the 
compensator and the ac mains.
7.4  Basic control systems of ac–dc converters 
with PWM
In general terms, control methods with PWM in ac converters can be 
divided into two groups:
	
1.	With direct voltage control, in the absence of current feedback
	
2.	With current feedback
The methods differ in the method of PWM and in the components 
employed. The first group is mainly employed for voltage source ­inverters, 
for example, in uninterruptible power systems. Both traditional and new 
methods of PWM can be utilized (e.g., the SV method).
Figure 7.31 shows the block diagram of a control scheme based on sinu-
soidal PWM for a three-phase voltage source inverter. The control pulses 
for the converter switches are produced at times determined by comparing 
the reference phase voltages u u
a
b
*,
,
*  and uc
* with a triangular carrier signal 
from a carrier-frequency generator. The required modulation index M is 
taken into account here; it is determined by the control system (not shown 
in Figure 7.31). The control pulses for the converter switches are generated 
by output control cascades of Driver 1–Driver 6, at the triggering times of 
comparison units Comp 1–Comp 3, which depend on the level ε of the con-
trol signals. The voltage source converter is controlled by switches S1, S3, 
and S5, which are on when switches S4, S6, and S2 are off and vice versa 
(not elements in the control channels). The dashed line in Figure 7.31 shows 
possible links that would improve the converter characteristics. For exam-
ple, to expand the linear region of the voltage-modulation range, a signal 
with the frequency of the third harmonic u3 is added to the reference sig-
nal. In addition, to smooth the frequency spectrum, signals from the “ran-
dom generator” are supplied to the carrier-frequency generator. Taking 
account of the probability distribution density function, these random sig-
nals determine the period of the carrier signal. A channel with a “voltage 
sensor” may be used to correct changes or monitor pulsations in the input

voltage at the dc side. This structure permits modulation directly by com-
parison of analog signals or by comparison of digital signals formed by 
a microprocessor controller. Digital methods improve the stability of the 
control system under standard perturbations due to various errors.

vector) determined by the microprocessor for each modulation cycle. 
Taking account of the modulation index, we specify the reference vector 
US
* as the reference value of the output voltage. For example, the required 
voltage can be supplied from the automatic-control channel for the out-
put parameters of a converter operating in an electric drive. At the same 
time, perturbations from the input voltage Ud on the dc side can be taken 
into account. The sample frequency corresponding to the modulation fre-
quency of the converter is determined by the “reference generator.” This 
frequency determines the number of switch commutations per period 
of the fundamental output voltage frequency. Within each cycle (or half-
cycle), the “calculation block” computes the coordinates of vector Us
* for 
a single sector. Then, the “sector selector” determines the sector number 
corresponding to the state of vector US
* at the given time and its coordi-
nates are recalculated for the αβ frame. As a result, the driver generates 
the control signals for the converter switches.
Current control methods based on PWM without current feedback 
permit voltage modulation over a broad range, including overmodulation, 
with limitations of switching losses and higher harmonics.
In contrast, systems with current feedback are faster with load pertur-
bations, which results in better dynamic characteristics of the converters. 
The use of current feedback improves the control precision with change 
in the instantaneous current, thereby offering effective protection against 
current surges. Control methods based on PWM with current feedback 
are widely used in converters for electric drives.
Figure 7.33 shows a simplified control structure for an ac–dc voltage 
source converter with load current feedback. Numerous such methods 
exist. We can note systems with direct tracking of the actual current iL with 
respect to the reference value iL
* within a bandwidth δ that determines the 
switching frequency (hysteresis control). Such systems are widely used 
because of their practical simplicity. A drawback is that the switching fre-
quency changes in tracking a nonlinear sinusoidal signal. The available 
methods for limiting the frequency range are not very effective and are 
constrained by the frequency difference between the modulated signal 
and the carrier frequency, which is more than an order of magnitude. That 
is especially important in the case of modulation in active power filters to 
eliminate higher-order harmonics. Note also that, in contrast to analog 
systems, the application of the hysteresis principle in digital control sys-
tems requires a significant increase in the microcontroller frequency and 
in the speed of the analog–digital converter so as to ensure the specified 
control precision. In such cases, it is expedient to use predictive modula-
tion, in which the rate of parameter variation is taken into account.
The development of active power filters and reactive power compensa-
tors entails the creation of systems with PWM that can regulate individual 
harmonics or harmonic spectrum of nonsinusoidal currents and voltages. 

354
Power electronics basics
That follows from the operating principle of various reactive power com-
pensators, including active power filters. We now consider in more detail 
some standard structures and components of control systems with PWM 
for that purpose; as an example, we look at ac–dc voltage source convert-
ers. We also assume that they can function as nonactive power regulators 
of the following types:
•	 Active power filters
•	 Hybrid filters
•	 Reactive power compensators at the fundamental harmonic
•	 Unbalanced currents compensators
In all these cases, the converter contains a capacitor for the exchange 
of nonactive power between the converter and the ac mains (in regula-
tors based on voltage source converters). A structure of such a regulator 
is shown in Figure 7.34, in which the power switches of the converter are 
controlled from the module that generates the control pulses (Driver). A 
“digital control system” implements the control algorithms; signals ic and 
iL from the load current and converter current sensors, the mains volt-
age us, and the capacitor voltage Ud are the inputs of this module. Filters

are introduced in the digital control system to obtain the information 
regarding individual harmonics or part of the spectrum of nonsinusoidal 
signals. Analysis of various filtration methods shows that the most effec-
tive is the digital filtration of signals converted from the coordinates of a 
three-phase system to a two-phase orthogonal rotating frame. The result-
ing coordinate system must be synchronized with the mains voltage in 
terms of phase and frequency. The control system includes a phase-locked 
loop (PLL) module, based on an automatic phase–frequency tuning sys-
tem. In operational terms, the phase–frequency tuning system is an auto-
matic control system, ensuring high-precision synchronization.

Power electronics basics
control system for the reactive power compensator is shown in Figure 7.35. 
External signals from the parameter sensors and the signal specifying the 
reactive power are their inputs. There are three main units of the control 
system:
	
1.	The PLL, which generates individual sinusoidal signals synchro-
nized in frequency and phase with the mains voltage.
	
2.	The synchronous frame transformation (abc/dq), which calculates the 
dq components of converter currents using synchronization signal.
	
3.	The reference currents calculation unit, which receives the signal 
Ud from the voltage sensor of capacitor Cd and the required reactive 
power signal from the external control system. The capacitor volt-
age signal is used for compensation of the active power losses in the 
compensator.
The signals corresponding to the actual (measured) and required (cal-
culated) currents in the dq frame go to proportional–integral controllers, 
which generate the regulating voltage dq signals for control of the current. 
After inverse coordinate transformation dq/abc, the signals corresponding 
to the required converter voltages are compared with the carrier signal 
from a “triangular signal generator,” producing a signal at the switching 
frequency. At the output of the comparator (“Comp”), control pulses are 
generated for the switches in each converter phase and go to Driver. In 
Figure 7.36, waveforms of current signals are shown, illustrating the con-
trol of a reactive power compensator.
Figure 7.37 shows the structure of a digital control system for an active 
power filter. This system realizes the hysteresis control of the converter 
currents. It contains two basic calculation blocks determining the refer-
ence current i*.
	
1.	The voltage controller that receives a signal from the voltage sensor 
Ud. This unit calculates the active current i1
* required for compensa-
tion of the power losses in the converter and hence for maintenance 
of the given voltage at capacitor Cd.
	
2.	The harmonics calculation unit based on the use of digital filters. It 
receives the signal from the load current sensor iL and calculates the 
required part of the current harmonic spectrum ∑≠

The sum of currents in and i1

load currents. For this purpose, the fundamental harmonics of the load 
current in phases A and B are obtained by digital low-pass filters and then 
they are subtracted from the measured load currents. The current in phase 
C is calculated from the results of the other two phases. In Figure 7.39, the 
abc/dq-transformation-based harmonic calculation method is shown. The 
fundamental harmonics in the synchronous dq frame are constant values. 
Therefore, they can be calculated as a mean value. The dq components of 
current pass through a low-pass filter. The received constant values are 
eliminated from dq components of the load current. The higher harmon-
ics of the load current are obtained by inverse transformation dq/abc. The 
waveforms of load current and its harmonics are illustrated in Figure 7.40.

Resonant converters
8.1  Introduction
In resonant converters, resonant circuits are used to reduce the switch-
ing power losses (IEC, 551-12-26). Resonant circuits were first used in 
thyristor converters, in which they permit an increase in the working 
frequency. Different circuits have been proposed for resonant convert-
ers, and various classification systems exist (Rozanov, 1987; Rashid, 1988; 
Kazimierczuk and Charkowski, 1993). Three groups of resonant convert-
ers can be distinguished:
	
1.	Converters with resonant circuits that include a load
	
2.	dc converters in which components of resonant circuits are con-
nected to the converter switches so as to ensure soft switching
	
3.	Inverters with a common resonant element on the dc side to ensure 
soft switching
As resonant converters are associated with the same electromagnetic 
processes, we employ the following parameters and notation for second-
order resonant circuits of series and parallel types (Figure 8.1):
•	 The resonant angular frequency of an ideal resonant loop (with 
active impedance R = 0) ω0

8.2  Converters with a load in resonant circuit
8.2.1  Converters with serial connection of the load
In most cases, such converters are used for direct dc–ac conversion. In 
other words, they are inverters. However, they are also used for indirect 
dc–dc conversion. In that case, they consist of two elements: an inverter 
and a rectifier. In addition, they may be based on special single-switch cir-
cuits, when they are said to operate in class E (Rashid, 1988). In that case, 
they can serve as inverters or rectifiers. In what follows, we use a common 
term for such converters: series resonant inverters or converters. Where 
necessary, their distinguishing features will be noted.
The converters can be divided into two groups:
	
1.	Those based on unidirectional switches
	
2.	Those based on bidirectional switches
Figure 8.2a shows a series resonant inverter based on thyristors. We 
will have oscillating process in the resonant circuit when thyristors VS1 
and VS2 are on, if we ensure that R
L C
< 2
,  where L = L1 = L2. For natu-
ral commutation, we require that the next thyristor be switched on after 
the preceding transient process has ended. In other words, current flow in 
the L–R–C circuit must be discontinuous. In that case, the frequency of the 
thyristor control pulses ωs must be less than the eigenfrequency of the cir-
cuit ωR: ωS < ωR. Equivalent circuits for the inverter in different operating 
periods are shown in Figure 8.2b. Waveforms of current iC and capacitor 
voltage uC are shown in Figure 8.2c. We assume that, when thyristor VS1 is 
switched on, capacitor C has been charged to voltage UC0. After thyristor 
VS1 is switched on, the processes in the inverter correspond to the equiva-
lent circuit for interval I and can be described as follows:

During this interval, the current iC(t) = 0, and the voltage is uC(t) = uC(t1) = UC1. 
This value can be determined on the basis of Equation 8.2.
At time t = Ts/2, thyristor VS2 is turned on. The inverter begins to 
operate in accordance with the equivalent circuit for interval III. The pro-
cesses in this interval are again determined by Equation 8.1, but without 
the emf E and with a new initial condition for the capacitor voltage, which 
is UC1, as in interval II. In interval III, the solution of Equation 8.1 takes 
the form

Note that, in steady inverter operation, the capacitor voltage is the 
same at the beginning and end of the period (at the beginning of inter-
val I, uC = UC0). These processes then periodically repeat. The inverter’s 
working frequency in discontinuous operation is limited by the circuit’s 
resonant frequency ω0, which theoretically may be attained when R = 0 
and thyristors VS1 and VS2 are turned on instantaneously. In practice, we 
need to ensure that the current-free period in interval II is greater than the 
time required to switch off the thyristor: tq < (TS − TR)/2.
In contrast, with discontinuous current iC, the ratio of the maximum 
instantaneous current to the mean current drawn from the source is 
increased, and its harmonic composition is impaired. At the same time, 
the harmonic composition of the inverter’s output voltage uR at load R 
deteriorates. These problems may be alleviated by introducing a trans-
former between the reactors L1 and L2, as shown by the dashed line in 
Figure 8.2a. In that case, when one of the thyristors is switched on, an emf 
will appear at the inductance connected to the other thyristor. As a result, 
the thyristor that is on in the preceding interval will be forcibly turned 
off. In that case, we can ensure a higher commutation frequency of the 
thyristors: ωS > ωR.
A more effective means of reducing the input-current ripples and the 
distortion of the output voltage is to use bridge and half-bridge circuits 
(Figure 8.3). In turn, the half-bridge circuit can be formed with a center 
tap in the power circuit (Figure 8.3a) or with a tap between the capacitors 
in series (Figure 8.3b). Note that the bridge circuit increases the inverter 
power by doubling the number of thyristors. Also for adjusting the output 
voltage, pulse–width control can be used.
The use of bidirectional switches (Figure 8.4a) permits the formation 
of series resonant converters on the basis of circuits with the properties of 
voltage–source inverters. In that case, reactive energy can be exchanged 
between the resonant circuit and the input voltage source. As a result, 
the converter can operate with continuous circuit current over a relatively

broad frequency range. The losses when thyristors are turned on or off 
are reduced.
Figure 8.4b and c shows typical resonant inverters based on bidirec-
tional switches and have the properties of a voltage source on the dc side. 
The dc converter shown in Figure 8.4d consists of two elements: a reso-
nant half-bridge inverter and a rectifier with output filter capacitance Cf. 
Assuming that Cf is sufficiently large, we can regard the rectifier output 
voltage as ideally smoothed and equal to the average value of the load 
voltage. In the converter, ac voltage is formed at the output of the half-
bridge inverter connected to a resonant LC circuit, whose current is rec-
tified by a single-phase diode bridge. The basic means of regulating the 
output voltage in such circuits is to adjust the frequency. Note here that the 
processes that determine the instantaneous current and voltage depend 
on the switching frequency ωS and the eigenfrequency ωR of the resonant 
circuit. Taking account of the similarity of the processes that occur in the 
circuits in Figure 8.4, we now consider them in more detail for the exam-
ple of a transistor-based half-bridge circuit presented in Figure 8.5a. To 
obtain the relations between the basic circuit parameters in simpler form,

Chapter eight:  Resonant converters
we assume a high Q-factor of the resonant circuit, in which the current 
damping within a single period is small and may be neglected.
There are three types of steady operating modes in the given circuits 
(Hui and Chung, 2001):
•	 Discontinuous current with frequency ωS < 0.5ω0
•	 Continuous current with frequency 0.5ω0 < ωS < ω0
•	 Continuous current with frequency ωS > ω0
8.2.1.1  Discontinuous current mode (ωS < 0.5ω0)
We assume that, at time t = 0 (Figure 8.5b), the voltage at capacitor C is 
UC(0) = 0, and all the switches are off. When a control pulse is supplied 
to transistor VT1, it is turned on, and current iC flows for the half-period 
T
LC
0 2
2
=
. As the switch is bidirectional, the vibrations in the cir-
cuit are not interrupted, and current iC continues to flow in the opposite 
direction through diode VD1. At the end of the period T0, when t = t1, 
the switch is turned off, and the oscillatory process is terminated. The 
next oscillation period begins when a voltage pulse is supplied to tran-
sistor VT2 (for uniform current loading of the switches) at time t2 = TS/2. 
If we neglect the time for the transistor to be switched on and off, the 
period td can be zero when ωS = 0.5ω0 (this is the boundary—­continuous 
mode). With a switching frequency ωS < 0.5ω0, the pause td increases, and 
the effective load current IR can be regulated, but with a discontinuous 
current iC, whose spectral composition deteriorates with an increase in 
td. Despite the deficiencies of operating with discontinuous current, the 
switching losses are practically eliminated, on account of soft switching 
with zero current. In other words, the transistor is switched off while the 
antiparallel diode is on, and hence the current and voltage in the transis-
tor are zero.
In this circuit, the transistor may be replaced by a thyristor. In that 
case, the thyristor must be switched off within the period td, in accordance 
with the reliable cutoff condition

8.2.1.2  Continuous current mode (0.5ω0 < ωS < ω0)
Simplified analysis of operation with continuous current iC in the reso-
nant circuit may be based on the fundamental component, disregarding 
all other harmonics of the voltage sent to the LCR circuit; this voltage 
takes the form of a meander. Below the resonant frequency, the current 
in the resonant circuit will be capacitive and will lead the first voltage 
harmonic uin1 at the circuit. In this case, the current and voltage diagrams 

368
Power electronics basics
for the converter are shown in Figure 8.5c. The transistors are switched off 
when their currents pass through zero. The power losses due to switching 
are practically zero, and the currents are smoothly switched to the inverse 
diodes. However, the currents will be nonzero when the transistors are 
switched on and the diodes are switched off. Accordingly, there will be 
power losses, which decline with a decrease in the instantaneous current. 
Thus, the switching losses are somewhat reduced in this circuit. In other 
words, the losses will only be practically zero within a single switching 
interval in the period TS. If the inverter operates at ωS = ω0, the phase shift 
between the fundamental components of the current iC and voltage uin1 
will be zero. That corresponds to the resistive character of the circuit 
impedance. In this case, the inverse diodes do not transmit the current iC; 
rather, each transistor in the circuit will conduct for one half-period of the 
circuit current and will be turned on and off at zero current. The switch-
ing losses will be zero.
8.2.1.3  Continuous current mode (ωS > ω0)
In this case, the current iC will be inductive and will lag the fundamental 
component of the circuit voltage (Figure 8.5d). Therefore, soft switching 
of the current iC from the diodes to the transistors will be observed, as 
iC will pass through zero at switching. Conversely, when the transistors 
are switched off, iC will be abruptly switched to the diodes, with corre-
sponding power losses. Thus, when ωS > ω0, when the phase shifts of the 
fundamental voltage and current components are of the same magnitude 
but different sign, the power losses will be approximately the same but 
will occur in different switching operations. If ωS < ω0, the losses will be 
small when the transistors are turned off; if ωS > ω0, they are small when 
the transistors are turned on.
In operation with continuous current, one benefit is improvement in 
the waveform of the inverter output voltage.
A common deficiency of inverters whose series resonant circuit con-
tains a load is the limited scope for regulating the output voltage with 
broad variation in the load impedance. This problem is obvious if we 
take into account that the circuit’s oscillatory properties disappear with 
an increase in R, although the inverter becomes inoperative as R → ∞. 
Therefore, inverters with a series resonant circuit are used with a load 
that is more or less constant. Another perturbing factor is variation in the 
inverter source voltage, which destabilizes the inverter load voltage.
Various methods can be used to regulate the output voltage.
•	 Control of the source voltage
•	 Control of the switching frequency in the inverter
•	 Pulse-width regulation of the voltage at the resonant LCR circuit

369
Chapter eight:  Resonant converters
The first method is obvious and requires no explanation. Control of 
the switching frequency is widely used and is universal in terms of the 
topology of circuits with a series resonant circuit. Therefore, we will now 
consider this case in more detail. As an example, Figure 8.4b shows the 
bridge circuit of an inverter based on bidirectional switches consisting 
of transistors and antiparallel diodes. A square-wave voltage with ampli-
tude E is applied to the resonant circuit in the bridge. Its fundamental 
component can be written as

If we assume that the Q-factor of the series circuit is QS at resonant 
frequency ωS, as in Equation 8.1, and introduce the ratio ν = ωS/ω0, the 
modulus of the transfer function of the fundamental input-voltage com-
ponent Uout1(ωS) and fundamental output-voltage component UR1(ωS) can 
be written as follows, based on Equations 8.5 and 8.6:

quantities, expressed relative to the effective value of the fundamental 
input-voltage component Uout1 and the resonant frequency ω0. On that 
basis, we may plot the modulus of the transfer function |W(jωS| against 
ν = ωS/ω0. Figure 8.7 shows several curves for different values of QS (Hui 
and Chung, 2001; Nagy, 2002). Regulation of the output voltage by adjust-
ing the frequency is an effective approach, especially at high QS. At low 
QS, however, the range of regulation is relatively broad, which impairs 
inverter performance. To eliminate this problem, we employ pulse-
width control of the output voltage, on the basis of a bridge inverter cir-
cuit (Figure 8.4c). In pulse-width control, a rectangular output voltage is 
formed, with half-wavelength λ = π − α (Figure 8.8). Here α is the control 
angle, generated by the inverter switching algorithm. The effective value 
of the fundamental voltage component at the inverter RLC circuit can 
then be written in the form

A deficiency of such control is deterioration of the current harmonic 
composition in the circuit. However, its use together with frequency regu-
lation is a good compromise, in which the deficiencies of the two methods 
do not significantly impair inverter performance.

8.2.2  Converters with parallel connection of the load
The classical version of an inverter with the oscillatory circuit and the 
load in parallel is a thyristor-based current-source inverter (Figure 8.9a). 
The first resonant inverters were created for inductive heating of metal 
by high-frequency current. The input reactor in this system has large 
inductance Ld, which ensures continuous and well-smoothed current 
over a wide range of active loads. Therefore, its equivalent circuit can be 
regarded as dual, according to conventional electrical engineering ter-
minology (Figure 8.9b). Hence, the variation in the output voltage in the 
­current-source inverter is similar to the output current in voltage-source 
inverters. According to the equivalent circuit, the processes in the system 
will correspond to the equation

It follows from Equations 8.2 and 8.10 that the variation in current 
iC in the series resonant voltage inverter is analogous to the variation in 
the voltage uout in a parallel resonant current inverter; accordingly, they 
are dual. The current inverter must be based on unidirectional switches. 
If the switches are unable to withstand the inverse voltage, a diode is 
introduced in series with them. Therefore, the circuit is well suited to 
thyristor use, and consequently, it was widely used in the early days of 
resonant inverters. A parallel current inverter based on ordinary thy-
ristors may operate not only when discontinuous voltages arise in the 
resonant circuit under the action of the input current, but also with con-
tinuous voltage when ωS > ω0. In that case, the following condition must 
be satisfied:
	
tq
S
≥β
ω ,
	
(8.11)
where tq is the thyristor’s cutoff time and β is the capacitive phase shift 
between the first current and voltage harmonics. In practice, the mini-
mum permissible value βmin is not large, especially for fast thyristors, 
which are used in such applications. Therefore, we may assume operation 
with ωS = ω0.
The benefits of such inverters include the following:
•	 The input reactor limits the maximum input currents, and hence the 
maximum currents switched by the thyristors
•	 The inverters have good filtration properties, due to the parallel 
capacitor
•	 They may operate at low loads, including zero load when R → ∞
Analysis of the dependence of the output voltage ulo on the switching 
frequency ωS yields functions similar to those in Figure 8.7 for a series res-
onant inverter with discontinuous current. In the present case, however,

Of course, the practical implementation of such dependences 
at high frequency (above 5 kHz) is only possible in current inverters 
based on completely controllable switches, for example, transistors. 
As already noted, however, the use of switches that cannot withstand 
inverse voltage, such as transistors, requires the introduction of a diode 
in series. An example of a transistor-based bridge circuit for a current-
source inverter, with a parallel resonant loop, is shown in Figure 8.10. 
Obviously, in this circuit, we can use not only frequency control of 
the output voltage, but also pulse-width control of the input current.

Power electronics basics
A deficiency of a current inverter with a parallel resonant loop is that 
it cannot operate in conditions resembling a short-circuit, in contrast 
to an inverter with a series resonant circuit, whose operation is con-
strained at very low loads.
A current-source inverter with a resonant circuit at the output (Figure 
8.9a) is considered under the assumption of large input-reactor inductance 
Ld, when we may assume that ωSLd → ∞. However, without changing the 
circuit design of such inverters, we may significantly change their charac-
teristics and their current and voltage variation if we significantly reduce 
the inductance of their input reactor, to values supplementing the induc-
tance of the output resonant loop. In addition, small inductance of the 
input circuit can create discontinuous input current at the inverter. That 
will reduce the switching losses in the inverter. However, the permissible 
ranges of load variation and output-voltage regulation will be limited in 
that case.
The voltage regulation of the current-source inverter can be signifi-
cantly improved without resorting to frequency or pulse-width regula-
tion. To that end, we use regulation of a reactor inductance connected 
in series with antiparallel thyristors. The load can also be connected in 
parallel to one of the elements in the series resonant circuit. Usually, the 
load is connected directly to the capacitor of the oscillatory circuit or 
else through transformer T (Figure 8.11a). In those cases, as a rule, volt-
age-source inverters with bidirectional switches are used. That ensures 
a broader range of operation and regulation of the output voltage. The 
equivalent circuit of an inverter with a parallel load is shown in Figure 
8.11b. We see that the inverter can operate at small loads, including zero

load. The output voltage uout is a maximum for operation at the resonant 
frequency ω0, when the switching frequency ωS = ω0. The maximum value 
of the output voltage is determined by the inverse Q-factor of the series 
circuit 1/QS. To regulate the voltage at small loads, the working frequency 
is raised above the resonant frequency.
8.2.3  Series–parallel resonant inverters
The series–parallel resonant inverter combines the benefits of voltage 
inverters with series and parallel resonant circuits. The circuit topology 
is determined by including an additional capacitor or reactor in the reso-
nant element. By adjusting the magnitude and point of introduction of 
the supplementary elements, we may obtain a wide range of circuits with 
different topologies and operational characteristics. A common design is 
a circuit formed by selecting capacitors corresponding to about a third 
of the total capacitance in the series circuit and connecting them in par-
allel to the inverter load (Figure 8.12a). The resulting circuit will have 
some of the properties of both series and parallel resonant inverters. The 
equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 8.12b. Analysis of the dependence 
of the output voltage on the switching frequency shows that the circuit 
may operate normally at low loads (including zero load). The output volt-
age may be regulated by varying the frequency ωS. In contrast, overloads 
and short-circuit currents at the output are limited by the series circuit 
at a level determined by the working frequency. It follows from the cir-
cuit’s operating principle that, by adjusting the ratio of the capacitors C1 
and C2, we may ensure the best inverter operation for specified technical 
characteristics.

8.2.4  Converters of class E
8.2.4.1  Inverters of class E
Such converters are connected to a dc source through reactor Ld, whose 
inductance ensures the properties of a current source at the inverter 
input. In inverters of class E, current pulses at elevated frequencies are 
formed by a single transistor and sent to a series resonant circuit LsCs 
with a high Q-factor (QS ≥ 7), which is connected to load R. The switch-
ing frequency ωs of the inverter is much greater than the resonant fre-
quency of the series circuit ω0. The inverter circuit with a single transistor 
ensures soft switching and is characterized by high efficiency. Usually, it 
is used for inverters of relatively low power (<100 W) with variable out-
put voltage and practically constant load R. They are typically used as 
lamp ballast (Rashid, 1988).
Figure 8.13a shows the inverter circuit. Two basic modes of operation 
can be distinguished: optimal operation and near-optimal operation. In 
optimal operation, the transistor is switched when the voltage uVT and 
current iVT pass through zero. In that case, there is no need for the inverse 
diode VD; a dashed line shows the connection to the diode in Figure 
8.13a. We observe optimal operation at certain parameters of the circuit 
elements, including the load R, which must remain constant in this case. 
In optimal operation, the losses in the inverter are a minimum, and its 
efficiency is a maximum.
Figure 8.13b shows equivalent circuits for different states of transis-
tor VT in optimal operation. The equivalent circuits for intervals I and II 
apply when the transistor is on and off, respectively. Figure 8.13c shows 
waveforms of current and voltage in the case of steady inverter opera-
tion. In interval I, transistor VT is on. When it is turned on (t = t0), current 
iVT = id + iR flows through transistor VT. The component id corresponds to 
the current of the input reactor Ld, whose magnitude in steady conditions 
can be assumed approximately constant and equal to the average value 
of Id. This assumption is possible because capacitor Cs of the series oscil-
latory circuit blocks the constant current component Id in steady condi-
tions. The other current component iR corresponds to the current in the 
circuit containing the load R. As a result, as we see from the iVT diagram 
in Figure 8.13c, the current of transistor VT begins at zero, as the initial 
condition for the switching on of transistor VT in optimal operation is 
that iVT(t0) = Id + iR(t0) = 0. This corresponds to the shunting of transistor 
VT by two sources: current source Id created by the input voltage E and 
inductance Ld and the nonzero current of the series circuit LsCsR. In other 
words, the voltage at capacitor Cd at the end of the preceding interval and, 
hence, at the beginning of the given interval (t = t0) is zero, that is, the 
capacitor Cd is completely discharged at t = t0. Note that the mean val-
ues UVT = UCd = E, as the constant voltage component at the other circuit 

377

elements is zero in steady operation. At t = t1, transistor VT is turned off, 
and the processes in the inverter then correspond to the equivalent circuit 
for interval II (Figure 8.13b). As a result, current iCd is supplied to capacitor 
Cd. However, as the voltage at the capacitor is an integral function of the 
current that is present, it begins to smoothly increase from zero. Hence, 
there are practically no power losses when transistor VT is switched off.

Power electronics basics
As long as iCd > 0, the voltage uCd rises, reaching a maximum when iCd 
passes through zero. Then the voltage uCd begins to fall, reaching zero at 
t = t0 + T in optimal operation, that is, at the end of the transistor’s switch-
ing period. Then transistor VT is switched on again, and the process peri-
odically repeats. Thus, in optimal operation, the transistor is switched off 
at zero voltage and is switched off at zero current—in other words, with 
practically no switching losses. Note, however, that optimal operation and 
near-optimal operation correspond to strictly defined parameter ratios of 
the circuit elements, including the load (Middlebrook, 1978). At the same 
time, the elimination of switching losses is associated with an increase in 
the maximum transistor voltage (uCd ≈ 3E) and current (iVT ≈ 3Id).
With an increase in the inverter load, that is, when the resistance R is 
reduced below the optimal value or other circuit parameters are adjusted 
with disruption of optimal operation, the processes in the circuit are mod-
ified, and the switching losses increase. In such nonoptimal operation, the 
voltage uCd = uVT changes sign before current iCd is zero. In that case, to 
eliminate inverse voltage at transistor VT, we must connect inverse diode 
VD (as shown by the dashed line in Figure 8.13a). In the presence of diode 
VD, reversal in the voltage polarity switches current iCd to the diode. As a 
result, the switching losses in the circuit increase. Therefore, the benefits 
of the circuit are most evident in optimal or near-optimal operation. In 
that case, the output voltage can be regulated within a narrow range by 
slight variation in the switching frequency.
8.2.4.2  Rectifiers of class E
Structurally, the dc converter often consists of an inverter and a recti-
fier. Therefore, the converter efficiency can be increased by reducing the 
losses in each component. For example, an inverter of class E can be com-
bined with a rectifier of class E. A simple rectifier circuit of this type was 
proposed in Lee (1989). It is based on a single diode and contains a reso-
nant series element, ensuring that the rectifier’s diode is switched off at 
zero current (Figure 8.14a). High-frequency voltage uin(t) = Uin max sin ωint 
is applied to the rectifier input. Capacitor C is connected in parallel with 
diode VD and is chosen so as to create resonance with inductance Ld at 
the input-voltage frequency ωin. The rectified voltage is smoothed by fil-
ter Cf, whose capacitance is determined by the permissible ripple and 
may be relatively large. The presence of a nonlinear element—diode 
VD—hinders rigorous analysis of the processes in the system. However, 
qualitative conclusions may be obtained if we consider equivalent cir-
cuits for two states of the diode VD (Figure 8.14b): when it is off (interval 
I) and on (interval II). The load R and the filter Cf constitute a dc voltage 
source with mean voltage UR. In interval I, the current in inductance Ld is 
equal to the difference of the currents corresponding to the input ac volt-
age uin(t) = Uin max sin ωint and the dc voltage UR of the source equivalent 

379
Chapter eight:  Resonant converters
to the output filter Cf and load R. Assuming that the output voltage is 
relatively smooth, we may regard the load current as constant and equal 
to the mean value IR = UR/R. In interval I, diode VD is off, and the differ-
ence between voltages uin(t) and UR is applied to the LC circuit tuned to 
resonance with the input-source frequency ωin. In interval I, the circuit 
current flows through capacitor C, at which the voltage is the inverse of 
that for diode VD. When the input voltage reaches the maximum value 
Uin max, equal to UR, diode VD is switched on, and the inductance current

corresponds to interval II. Diode VD is switched off when current iL falls 
to zero; when this occurs will depend on the difference between uin(t) and

If the diode is switched off at zero current, there will be practically no

8.3  Quasi-resonant converters
8.3.1  Basic circuits with quasi-resonant switching
In quasi-resonant switching, smooth switching trajectories are formed 
by means of resonance in inductive and capacitive components con-
nected to the controllable semiconductor switch. As resonance is asso-
ciated with oscillatory processes in the resonant LC circuit, conditions 
may be created for switching at zero current or voltage, depending on 
the circuit and the type of quasi-resonant switch. Given that a semicon-
ductor switch is a significantly nonlinear element in the switching inter-
vals, we conclude that the current or voltage in the circuit that switches 
on the semiconductor device will be nonsinusoidal and will not corre-
spond to strict resonant specifications. In addition, the duration of the 
oscillations is usually no more than one or two half-periods, on account 
of the transition of the system on switching to a new state with differ-
ent variables describing the trajectory of parameter variation. Therefore, 
such circuits are said to be characterized by a quasi-resonant switching. 
When using quasi-­resonant switching, the goal is to reduce the power 
losses by ensuring soft ­switching—in other words, switching when the 
current or voltage is zero. At the same time, the di/dt and du/dt values 
at the switch are reduced. That increases the reliability of the switch 
and the circuit as a whole, due to the decrease in the electromagnetic 
interference.
In practice, quasi-resonant switches are best used in dc converters. 
Such converters include not only unidirectional and bidirectional semi-
conductor switches but also reactors and capacitors with small induc-
tance and capacitance (Lee, 1989; Nagy, 2002). In some cases, for example, 
at high switching frequencies, this function may simply be served by the 
intrinsic capacitance and inductance of the switches themselves, which 

381
Chapter eight:  Resonant converters
has traditionally been regarded as parasitic. Of course, special technology 
is required in that case.
The use of the switch intrinsic capacitance and inductance in that way 
permits the formation of the desired switching trajectories, correspond-
ing to soft switching. Essentially, these elements constitute nondissipative 
circuits for the formation of the switching trajectories. The circuits are 
nondissipative because they do not contain resistive elements.
8.3.1.1  Zero current switching
Figure 8.15 shows typical unidirectional and bidirectional switches 
with zero current switching (ZCS). Various controllable switches can be 
employed here, in particular, transistors with a diode in series or anti-
parallel. The capacitor Cr and inductance Lr connected to the switch are 
elements of a resonant circuit for creating current oscillations at fre-
quency ω0

r.  When a unidirectional switch is turned on (Figure 
8.15a and b), the current begins to rise slowly from zero iL(0) = iVT(0) = 0. 
Then an oscillatory process begins in the circuit LrCr and, when cur-
rent iL passes through zero during the first half-period, the switch is 
turned off. In that case, current flows through the switch during the 
first half-period. Accordingly, in quasi-resonant converters, this is said 
to be a half-wave operation. When using a bidirectional switch (Figure 
8.15c and d), likewise, the current rises smoothly after it has been turned

on, and an oscillatory process begins at frequency ω0. However, this 
process extends over the whole oscillation period, as the negative cur-
rent half-wave will pass through antiparallel diode VD. The switch will 
again be turned off at zero current iL, but this time at the end of the 
second half-period. Thus, circuits with full-wave operation are based 
on bidirectional switches and circuits with half-wave operation on uni-
directional switches. In what follows, quasi-resonant converters will be 
described as half-wave or full-wave circuits, because that better reflects 
their properties.
8.3.1.2  Zero voltage switching
Figure 8.16 shows circuits for quasi-resonant zero voltage switching 
(ZVS). As for switching at zero current, the elements Lr and Cr create 
oscillations at the resonant frequency ω0. It is evident from the topol-
ogy that the circuits for switching at zero current and switching at zero 
voltage are dual. Connecting capacitor Cr in parallel with the semicon-
ductor device permits switching at zero voltage, just as the inductance 
Lr in Figure 8.15 permits switching at zero current. In circuits with a 
bidirectional switch (Figure 8.16a and b), diode VD shunts the negative 
half-wave of the oscillations. That results in half-wave operation. When 
the diode is in series with the switch (Figure 8.16c and d), full-wave 
operation is observed. The reactive elements allow the semiconductor 
switches to be turned on and off at zero voltage. Most dc converters are 
based on switching at zero current or switching at zero voltage. Which

option is selected will depend on numerous engineering and economic 
factors, such as the following.
•	 In switching at zero current, the maximum current is more than 
double the mean load current.
•	 In switching at zero voltage, the maximum voltage at the switch is 
much greater than the converter input voltage.
•	 In switching at zero current, the intrinsic capacitance of the semi-
conductor switch produces additional currents when the switch is 
turned on, with a corresponding increase in the power losses.
8.3.2  Quasi-resonant dc–dc converters
8.3.2.1  ZCS quasi-resonant converters
Practically, all basic dc–dc converters are capable of being switched off at 
zero current in quasi-resonant conditions. As an example, we consider the 
buck converter shown in Figure 8.17a, as well as the version with a half-
wave switch in Figure 8.15a. The converter operates in the pulsed mode at 
frequency fs = 1/Ts. We make the following assumptions:
•	 Ideal circuit components
•	 Zero pulsations of the input voltage uin and filter current iLf
•	 Steady operation with constant fill factor γ = ton/Ts specified by the 
sequence of control pulses and the switch
We assume that transistor VT is off when t < 0 but is turned on by 
a control pulse at time t = 0. When transistor VT is on, under the given 
assumptions, the converter can be represented by the equivalent circuits 
shown in Figure 8.17b, which applies for interval I (0 < t < t1). In this inter-
val, the filter’s reactor current ILf passes through the inverse diode VD, 
which shunts the output filter and the load. According to the equivalent

However, in a unidirectional switch, the current iLr cannot reverse direc-

At time t = t2, iLr falls to zero, transistor VT is turned off, and interval 
III begins (t2 < t < t3). In the corresponding equivalent circuit, the variation

Capacitor discharge to zero voltage ends when t = t3. The equivalent 
circuit again changes, with the onset of interval IV (t3 < t < Ts). In this 
interval, diode VD at the filter input is turned on and begins to transmit 
current ILf. At t = Ts, interval IV ends. A pulse is again sent to turn on tran-
sistor VT, and operation corresponds to interval I. This sequence repeats 
periodically (Figure 8.17c).
The use of the full-wave step-down converter shown by the dashed 
line in Figure 8.17a changes the processes in the system beginning at time 
t = t2, as the current iLr, after passing through zero, begins to flow in the 
opposite direction through the antiparallel diode VD1. As a result, the 
recharging of capacitor Cr is not linear but oscillatory up to t
t
= ʹ2, when 
the second half-wave of current iLr ends on passing through diode VD1. 
That corresponds to full-wave operation. Correspondingly, the onset of lin-
ear capacitor discharge is shifted from t = t2 to t
t
= ʹ2. In other words, the 
bidirectional switch containing diode VD1 is switched off later (at t
t
= ʹ2). 
The subsequent operation corresponds to the equivalent circuit for interval 
III. Full-wave operation of this system improves its properties. First, the 
load has little influence on the discharge of capacitor Cr. Accordingly, its

regulated characteristics are practically linear and do not depend greatly 
on the load. In addition, in a bidirectional switch, some of the energy stored 
in the reactor Lr is returned to the primary voltage source.
The converter’s output voltage may be regulated by adjusting the 
switching frequency fs. In zero current switching converters, the control-
lable switch is on for a fixed period. The variable in the control character-
istics is the switching frequency ratio ν = ωs/ω0, which can be regarded as 
an analog of the duty ratio γ in pulse-width modulation. The basic factors 
that perturb the output voltage UR are the input voltage E and the load RL.

 and ν = ωs/ω0, with differ-
ent damping factors d = R/ρ. It is evident from Figure 8.18 that when using 
a bidirectional switch, these factors have no influence on the load.
8.3.2.2  ZVS quasi-resonant converters
Like switching at zero current, switching at zero voltage can be used in all 
basic dc converters. We will now investigate in more detail the operation 
of a step-down converter when switching at zero current is replaced by 
switching at zero voltage, under the same assumptions. We consider the 
half-wave switch shown in Figure 8.16a. Hence, we may obtain similar 
variation of the current iLr in switching at zero current and of the voltage 
uCr in switching at zero voltage. Figure 8.19 shows the circuit diagram of 
the buck converter with ZVS and its equivalent circuits in different opera-
tional intervals. At time t = 0, transistor VT is switched off, and the equiv-
alent circuit corresponds to interval I (0 < t < t1). In interval I, transistor 
VT is off, and the capacitor Cr is charged by the load current ILf. Under the 
given assumptions, charging is linear, that is,

whereas the current iLr begins to fall to zero. On the assumption of ideal 
circuit elements, the variation in current iLr is shifted in phase by π/2 rela-
tive to voltage uLr, so that the maximum voltage ULrmax appears when iLr 
passes through zero. The load current ILf must ensure that UCrmax exceeds

. This is necessary in order to ensure that 
the switch is not turned on at nonzero voltage. After iLr falls to zero at 
t
t
= ʹ1, it reverses direction, and discharge of the capacitor continues. At 
t = t2, the voltage at capacitor Cr is zero, and the negative component of 
current iLr begins to flow through diode VD1, which begins to conduct at 
t = t2. At t = t2, interval III begins (t2 < t < t3), with a new equivalent circuit. 
In this interval, iLr varies linearly, reaching zero at t
t
= ʹ2, when diode VD1 
is switched off and transistor VT is switched on by a control pulse. Then 
current iLr increases linearly to iLr = ILf (t = t3). When iLr reaches the value 
ILf, inverse diode VDf is switched off, as its current becomes equal to zero. 
A new stage begins, characterized by the equivalent circuit for interval IV 
(t3 < t < t4). At t = t4, transistor VT is turned off and a new period begins. 
The preceding sequence repeats.
The converter output voltage can be regulated by adjusting frequency 
fs so as to vary the length of interval IV. Thus, we may contrast switch-
ing at zero current, where the converter’s output voltage is regulated by 
adjusting fs with constant duration of the transistor’s on state, and switch-
ing at zero voltage, where the duration of the transistor’s off state is main-
tained constant. In the case of converters with half-wave switches, the 
controllable characteristics depend on the load in switching at zero volt-
age, just as in switching at zero current. Likewise, as in a converter with 
switching at zero current, the dependence of the controllable characteris-
tics on the load in a converter with switching at zero voltage can be almost 
completely eliminated if the half-wave switch is replaced by a full-wave 
switch (Figure 8.16c and d).
8.3.3  ZVS converters with switch voltage limiting
We now consider converters with switching at zero voltage in the case in 
which the switch voltage cannot exceed the input voltage. In such convert-
ers, at least one arm of the bridge contains bidirectional switches, in paral-
lel with capacitors. The corresponding topology resembles a half-bridge 
single-phase circuit, which can be regarded as a single-phase module for a 
bridge inverter. At the same time, the single-arm circuit can be used in dc–
dc converters in which switches with a low maximum voltage are preferred. 
In addition, it permits regulation of the output voltage by pulse-width

modulation at constant working frequency. We can note that this circuit 
corresponds to a controller operating in two quadrants of the output volt–
ampere characteristic (Lee, 1989; Kazimierczuk and Charkowski, 1993).
Figure 8.20a shows the power component of such a converter based on 
transistors VT1 and VT2 and antiparallel diodes VD1 and VD2. Reactor

transistors. We assume ideal circuit elements and ideally smooth output 
voltage Uout of the filter capacitor Cf. On the basis of the latter assumption, 
we may regard the load R with filter Cf as a voltage source with mean volt-
age Uout, as we did earlier in formulating equivalent circuits for different 
operational intervals.
We start to calculate the processes at time t = 0, when transistor VT1 
is switched on and current iLr begins to flow. This state corresponds to 
the equivalent circuit for interval I (0 < t < t1), with linear variation in the 
current iLr

(8.21)
At time t = t1, transistor VT1 is switched off at zero voltage, as the volt-
age at capacitor Cr1 is zero. This moment, at which transistors VT1 and VT2 
and diodes VD1 and VD2 are turned off, marks the beginning of interval 
II (t1 < t < t2). The corresponding equivalent circuit contains a resonant 
circuit with inductance Lr and capacitance Cr; capacitance Cr consists of 
capacitors Cr1 and Cr2 connected in parallel through the internal imped-
ance of input source E. The transient processes in the circuit are deter-
mined not only by the sources E and UR, but also by the initial conditions 
uCr1(t2) and uCr2(t2). The circuit parameters are chosen so that the circuit’s 
characteristic impedance ρ =
L C
r
r  is large, and hence the variation in 
current iLr due to oscillatory processes over the relatively short interval 
t1–t2 is slight. In this context, we may approximately assume that the cur-
rent is constant and determines the transient processes in this interval. As 
a result, the voltage at capacitors Cr1 and Cr2 varies almost linearly. At t = t2, 
the voltage at capacitor Cr1 increases to E, whereas that at Cr2 falls to zero 
and tends to reverse polarity. However, this is prevented by switching on 
diode VD2. Interval III begins (t2 < t < t3). In this interval, iLr falls linearly 
to zero under the action of voltage UR. At t = t3, iLr reaches zero and begins 
to change direction. Interval IV begins (t3 < t < t4). In that interval, current 
flows through transistor VT2, which is turned on at t = t3 because diode 
VD2 is turned off in response to the change in direction of current iLr. Of 
course, a control pulse to switch on transistor VT2 must be formed at that 
moment. At t = t4, transistor VT2 is switched off, and interval V begins 
(t4 < t < t5). It is similar to interval II, as all the semiconductor switches 
are off and voltage uCr2 begins to rise from zero to E under the action of 
the opposing current. At t = t5, diode VD1 is switched on, thereby initiat-
ing interval VI; diode VD1 begins to conduct current iLr, which increases 
linearly from a negative value to zero at t = t6. The equivalent circuits for 
intervals III and VI are similar; they differ only in the direction of iLr. 
These processes then periodically repeat, running through intervals I–VI.

It follows from Figure 8.20c that, as the resonant processes correspond 
to short intervals II and V, they may be neglected when fr ≫ fs and the

According to Equation 8.22, pulse-width modulation can be used to 
regulate the output voltage.
Zero voltage switching considered here for a dc–dc converter can also 
be employed for an inverter with an inductive load. In that case, the con-
trol algorithm for a bridge with one arm containing parallel capacitors 
corresponds to the formation of alternating voltage. Depending on the 
number of phases, we may use a half-bridge inverter or, for example, a 
three-phase inverter based on three arms.
8.3.4  ZVS inverters with an input resonant circuit
One method of switching at zero voltage in an inverter is to create a voltage 
with high-frequency ripple on the dc side (Rashid, 1988). This entails the 
excitement of series or parallel oscillatory circuits by periodic switching so 
as to produce oscillation of the input voltage, which passes through zero at 
the resonant frequency of the input circuit. We will consider this approach 
in more detail for the example of the circuit shown in Figure 8.21a.
We assume that the load at the circuit’s output is a current source 
Iout. This source may be represented in the equivalent circuit as a load 
inductance or the output filter of the inverter phase, which considerably 
exceeds the input inductance Lr. The oscillatory input circuit contains a 
reactor (with inductance Lr) and a capacitor Cr. Resistor R represents the 
total active losses in the system. If we create oscillations in the circuit at 
the resonant frequency and assume that R = 0, the capacitor voltage will 
vary with frequency ω0 from zero to E, and the mean value of current ILr 
in reactor Lr will be Iout. With no losses, this process is undamped (Figure 
8.21b) and we can write

Taking account of the actual losses in the circuit, we see that energy

sustain the oscillatory process in the system.

The oscillatory processes in the circuit (Figure 8.21a) are sustained 
by periodically switching transistor VT on and off within a near-zero 
range of voltages at capacitor uCr. At time t = t1, transistor VT is turned on 
(Figure 8.21b) and current iLr in the reactor increases almost linearly under 
the action of voltage E. At t = t2, the current iLr = ILr0, and transistor VT is 
switched off (Figure 8.21c). The oscillatory circuit including LrCr is restored 
and oscillation continues. Thus, a quasi-sinusoidal pulsating voltage that 
varies from zero to almost E appears at the output (Figure 8.21c).
As a result, the inverter input voltage falls periodically to zero. At zero 
voltage, the switching losses of the inverter components will be a mini-
mum. Obviously, then, the switching strategy should focus on moments 
when the input voltage passes through zero. That limits the scope for 
control of the output voltage. Figure 8.22a shows a three-phase inverter 
bridge circuit with an input resonant link based on the transistor VT0 and 
LrCr circuit. The inverter output voltage is determined by the number of 
pulsations in each phase when the switches VT1–VT6 are conducting. The 
switching frequency of transistor VT0 in that case considerably exceeds 
the frequency of the inverter output voltage (Figure 8.22b). It is evident 
from Figure 8.22 that this system has the following serious deficiencies:
•	 The maximum voltage at the inverter switches is greater than the dc 
input voltage.
•	 Additional output voltage harmonics appear under the action of the 
voltage pulsations in the circuit.
•	 The range of output voltage regulation is limited and discrete.
These problems can be eliminated by modifying the resonant 
­circuit, for example, by using a configuration in which the reactor and 
the capacitor of the oscillatory circuit are in parallel (Middlebrook, 1978; 
Nagy, 2002).

Multilevel, modular, and multicell 
converter topologies
9.1  Introduction
In this chapter, we understand a module to be a structurally and function-
ally complete power-electronic device. In modular systems, some addi-
tional connections and components of particular type can be used. A cell 
is understood to be a structurally complete device consisting of standard 
structures. Using these terms, we consider modular design, which per-
mits the connection of functionally different devices, for example, a fre-
quency converter is made by connecting a rectifier and an inverter.
The use of modular and multicell topologies enables to minimize the 
time and production costs in the design of one-type converters. In addi-
tion, this approach is well suited to reducing the higher harmonics of cur-
rent and voltage and it can also be used for reservation. In general, this 
approach can be used for the following purposes:
•	 Increase in the system power with limited parameters of the avail-
able components
•	 Decrease in the design period of new power-electronic devices, with 
distinctive voltage and current characteristics
•	 Reservation of devices and their components with the output param-
eters continuity
•	 Reduction of higher harmonics in input and output current or 
voltage
•	 Matching of the input and output currents and voltages
•	 Unification and standardization of components
Modular and multicell converters were first used in secondary power 
sources for autonomous devices, primarily airplanes (Rozanov et  al., 
2007). This approach is based on the theory of structural–algorithmic 
synthesis of secondary power sources (Mytsyk, 1989). The same design 
principles are widely used in the power engineering for the design of dc 
power systems (Sood, 2001). Various approximations of the harmonic sig-
nal were analyzed in Mytsyk (1989). In particular, a signal with N stages 
was considered (Figure 9.1). Obviously, the distortion in this case depends 
on two variables: the sampling interval θn and the quantization level An. 

398
Power electronics basics
Complete minimization of the distortion depends on two variables 
and entails numerical solution of a system of transcendental equations. 
The solutions obtained do not lend themselves to technical realization. 
Therefore, in practice, the relative level is assumed to be a multiple of the 
minimum level of the first stage. A better method is to combine pulse-
amplitude modulation with pulse-width modulation (PWM). In that case, 
the modulation frequency is minimized, and the number of stages is 
selected so as to have the best utilization of the components or is deter-
mined in accordance with technical and economic optimization.
The most widely used techniques of modular design are the following:
•	 Parallel connection of ac or dc converters
•	 Shunt connection of self-commutated inverters
•	 Multicell topologies of diode–capacitor rectifier circuits of voltage 
multipliers and voltage dividers
•	 Multilevel converter topologies
•	 Cascade converter configurations
9.2  Parallel connection of rectifiers and dc–dc 
converters
Such circuits enable to obtain the following advantages:
•	 Increase in power
•	 Reservation of devices
•	 Improvement of the converter output and input parameters
•	 Increase in modulation frequency of dc–dc converters

Chapter nine:  Multilevel, modular, and multicell converter topologies
The first and second options basically involve the parallel opera-
tion of converters with a dc output (Rozanov, 1992). Note that it is sim-
pler to organize parallel operation for dc–dc converters than for ac–dc 
converters, as it involves regulating of one or two parameters of the 
output voltage (or the output current, where necessary). Therefore, we 
focus here on parallel operation of ac–dc converters. The requirements 
on the parallel converters will depend on the required function. Thus, 
for complete reservation (one operational unit and one auxiliary unit), 
it is sufficient to ensure stable operation of two converters at a common 
bus without any constraint on the load power distribution between 
these modules. This follows from the complete reservation principle, 
when the maximum power of the consumer does not exceed the maxi-
mum power capacity of each converter. Depending on the type of con-
sumer, the structure with parallel modules for reservation function 
can be replaced by a structure in which the output buses of one of the 
modules operating in cold or hot reserve can be switched at a special 
command. With partial reservation (e.g., two operational units and one 
reserve unit) or in a modular circuit with a function of power increase, 
the power distribution between the parallel converters must not lead to 
overload of a converter.
In general, there are several types of parallel operation.
	
1.	Operation at common buses with an arbitrary power distribution 
between the separate converters, provided that the load power does 
not exceed the rated power of each converter (sometimes known as 
combined operation rather than parallel operation).
	
2.	Operation at common buses with a distribution of the load power, 
such that it is proportional to the rated power of each converter. 
In the case of equal converter power, the load distribution will be 
balanced.
	
3.	Operation at common buses with an arbitrary load power distribu-
tion between the separate converters, except that the load of each 
converter is limited to the rated overload power (power capability).
Parallel operation of ac converters is associated with additional con-
ditions that will be considered separately, along with the organization of 
three-phase systems based on single-phase modules.
For dc–dc converters, the simplest form of parallel operation is the 
connection of converters to common buses through decoupling diodes 
(Figure 9.2). The diodes primarily protect the output buses from short-
circuits within a separate converter. With identical output parameters 
and precise adjustment of the output voltage control channels, relative 
load balancing between the converters is obtained. In practice, however, 
it is difficult to ensure equal load distribution under various operating

conditions, mainly because adjustable converters usually have pre-
cise output voltage stabilization. Accordingly, for such operation, we 
require that

where IL is the load current and IN is the rated current of converter N 
(Figure 9.2a).
The second type of parallel operation can be achieved by using feed-
back between the load and each converter (Figure 9.2b). In that case, the 
signal from the load current sensor CSL is split and distributed among the 
feedback channels and is compared with the current signal of a separate 
converter. The difference of currents is sent to the output voltage control 
system. As a result, the load current can be distributed between convert-
ers, according to the converter currents. In particular, equal distribution 
of the load current between the converters is possible (IN = IL/N). The static 
accuracy of the distribution will be determined by the current feedback 
gain. In practice, in such systems, the distribution accuracy is about ±10% 
when the load of each converter is not more than 0.5IL. To ensure stability 
of parallel operation and to eliminate self-oscillation, we should attend to 
the design of the frequency-dependent parameters in the current control 
channels.
The third type of parallel operation is possible for converters whose 
output characteristic corresponds to the curve shown in Figure 9.2c. 
Section 1 corresponds to operation with slight output voltage variation. 
When the rated load is attained, the converter operates with more rapid 
voltage variation (section 2). In overloads and external short-circuits, the 
converter operates with stabilization of the output current (section 3) or is 
switched off. In parallel operation of converters with such a characteristic, 
the output voltages will be equal, with an accuracy determined by the 
converter parameters (in practice, within the voltage stabilization zone). 
The converter structure corresponds to Figure 9.2a. In general case, the 
load is unbalanced between the converters. However, when the rated load 
of one of the converters is obtained, its operation will correspond to sec-
tion 2, and its output voltage will begin to decrease. With a subsequent 
increase in the load, it is applied to the other converter and so on. This is 
the most promising approach of parallel operation, as it is not necessary 
to have additional feedbacks and there are not any structural or circuit 
constraints on the modular configuration.
The converter begins to operate in a limited current mode (section 2 
in Figure 9.2c) when the output current exceeds the specified value and 
the current limit loop in parallel with the primary voltage feedback is 
switched on.
In Section 4.2.2, we considered in detail the parallel and series opera-
tions of two three-phase bridge converters. In a parallel configuration, the 
current is doubled, without changing the transformers or semiconductor 
components; in series circuits, in the same conditions, the voltage is dou-
bled. However, it is more common to improve the spectrum of the input 
current and output voltage. When connecting two bridges in parallel, a 
three-step input current waveform is obtained, and the higher harmonics

is reduced. In the output voltage, the ripple is reduced, and the frequency 
of its fundamental component is doubled. Obviously, when three, four, or 
more rectifiers are connected together, with appropriate changes in the 
transformer windings configuration, we obtain improved spectrum of the 
input current and output voltage, which become equivalent to those gen-
erated by rectifiers with 18, 24, or more phases. However, it is not usual to 
employ more than four rectifiers, on account of difficulties in ensuring the 
specified transformation ratio.
The benefits of parallel operation of converters with a common filter 
are also evident. In such a circuit (Figure 9.3), each converter operates with 
a phase shift T/N of the control pulses, where N is the number of cells in

parallel, and the modulation frequency and the filter size can be reduced 
by a factor of N. As a result, the commutation frequency of each switch can 
be increased to the maximum permissible value on the assumption that 
the filter is able to eliminate ripple over the expanded frequency range. In 
that case, the basic converter cells containing the switches will operate in 
parallel. Other types of converter circuits can also be combined, so as to 
increase the modulation frequency.
9.3  Parallel connection of inverters
As already noted, it is more difficult to ensure parallel operation of ac 
modules, because that entails their voltage synchronization (Rozanov 
et al., 1981; Rozanov, 1992). Figure 9.4a shows a simplified equivalent cir-
cuit of two parallel single-phase voltage-source inverter modules, under 
the assumption of sinusoidal output voltage. That is ensured by means 
of output filters whose inductance Lf is shown in Figure 9.4a. When the 
vectors Uinv1 and Uinv2 are equal, there is no circulating current between 
the modules (Figure 9.4b). When the vectors are of the same phase but dif-
ferent amplitude, reactive circulating current Icir appears. For the higher-
voltage module, it is equivalent to an inductive load. This current can be 
calculated as

where ΔUinv is the modulus of the vector difference of the RMS values of 
the first harmonics of the inverter output voltages Uinv1 and Uinv2, ΔUd the 
difference in average input voltages, and k the circuit coefficient of the rela-
tion between the fundamental output voltage Uinv and the average input 
voltage Ud.
With a phase difference between the vectors Uinv1 and Uinv2, there 
is an active component of the circulating current between the modules.

where ϑ is the phase difference.
Active power is supplied by the module in which voltage Uinv1 leads, 
whereas the module with lagging voltage consumes active power (from 
the buses). This is analogous to the appearance of balancing current in 
parallel synchronous generators.
Thus, to ensure parallel operation of the inverter modules, we need 
to regulate the amplitude of the output voltages and ensure that they are 
synchronous and in phase. Different methods are employed here, depend-
ing on the inverter circuit. In modular design, it is expedient to use single-
phase modules based on voltage-source inverters.
Various methods can be used to regulate the output voltage in such 
inverters. In particular, we can regulate the input dc-side voltage by means 
of a dc voltage controller. In that case, it is expedient to use additional data 
connection between the modules. To that end, an additional informational 
bus on the dc side is used in the parallel modules, so as to permit equal-
ization of the inverter output voltages and hence the amplitude of the first 
harmonic of these voltages.
Synchronization of the inverter modules ensures that the switching 
functions are in phase. The corresponding algorithm in voltage-source 
inverters is specified by an accounting and distributed unit, which receives 
the pulses from the reference oscillator. A special synchronous coupling 
system is employed for this purpose. On the basis of the standard require-
ment for uninterruptible power supply systems that any single fault must 
not disrupt normal operation, the following factors must be taken into 
account in the synchronization system:
	
1.	The absence of structurally combined centralized devices. However, 
this does not rule out parametric control.
	
2.	Return of any module to operation (after elimination of the 
fault) in the system, without reorganization of the links or phase 
discontinuity.

405
Chapter nine:  Multilevel, modular, and multicell converter topologies
	
3.	Maintenance of the relations within the system (and equal vector 
phases) and the frequency in the case of interruption of generation 
or frequency variation of any reference oscillator and also when any 
single synchronizing link is broken.
Reference oscillators can be synchronized both by means of a phase-
locked loop (PLL) and by direct pulse synchronization. In direct syn-
chronization, a relaxation self-oscillatory circuit is used as the reference 
generator. In that case, the frequency of the synchronizing signal does 
not need to exceed the base frequency of the reference oscillator, as it is 
usually required for such devices. The feature of direct synchronization 
is the decrease in frequency of the reference generator if the synchroni-
zation circuit forms a ring from the output to the input. In that case, the 
synchronization ring can cover one or more reference oscillators. Thus, 
in direct synchronization, maintaining constant frequency entails main-
taining a closed synchronization ring or an open circuit (i.e., in the cor-
responding graph figure, maintaining a tree structure of graph). In direct 
synchronization of a relaxation reference generator, pulses act directly on 
the switching element of the generator. Therefore, the synchronized gen-
erators will be accurate in phase. It only depends on the time delays of the 
pulsed circuits and switches.
In synchronization by means of a PLL, the reference generator has a 
smoothly tunable frequency. A control system adjusts this frequency as a 
function of the sign and magnitude of the phase difference between the syn-
chronizing signal and the output signal of the reference generator. Here, in 
contrast to direct synchronization, the frequency of the synchronizing sig-
nal can be less than the output frequency of the reference generator. The fre-
quency of the PLL reference generator after capture by the synchronization 
ring will be the same as that in autonomous (unsynchronized) operation. If 
several PLL generators are closed by the synchronization ring, a frequency 
becomes close to the average frequency of the operational generators. In 
structures with a unidirectional system, in both direct synchronization and 
synchronization by means of a PLL, the whole reference generator system 
operates at the frequency of the primary generator.
A set of possible synchronization structures arises on account of the 
contradictory requirements of reliability and structure simplicity, which 
can be formulated as follows:
	
a.	Minimum number of informational links between the inverter 
modules
	
b.	Same structure of all the modules
	
c.	Maximum symmetry of the informational links and the dependent 
operational modes of the modules
	
d.	Minimum complexity of the hardware

406
Power electronics basics
Several typical structures of a synchronous link system for in-phase 
synchronization are shown in Figure 9.5. These structures do not contain 
centralized devices and hence meet the fundamental reliability require-
ment. The switches in the signal circuits are assumed to be built into each 
module. As a centralized device can be regarded a synchronizing bus, its 
reliability can readily be ensured by structural means. The reliability and 
simplicity requirements are best met by the following structures: a simple 
ring for PLL system (Figure 9.5b) and a ring with bypasses (Figure 9.5d) 
and a simple line (Figure 9.5a) and a line with bypasses for direct synchro-
nization (Figure 9.5c).
In the PLL ring structure, the frequency is close to the average value 
of the generator base frequencies. Therefore, any variation in the base fre-
quency of a single reference generator will affect the whole system. With 
a small number of generators, the frequency change can be considerable. 
To determine the faulty reference generator, we can use a combination of 
a frequency sensor and a sensor identifying the sign of the generator fault. 
For example, if the frequency is less than the nominal value and the phase 
of the reference generator lags that of the corresponding synchronizing 
signal, the generator base frequency will be too low. However, this method 
requires relatively large phase variability for the PLL synchronization.
The direct synchronization ring (Figure 9.5b) operates at the highest 
frequency produced by any of the reference generators. The generator 
producing that frequency will provide the synchronizing signals that 
trigger the other generators; it can be regarded as the leading genera-
tor (master generator). If for some reason its frequency falls below that 
of another generator, that generator will become the leading generator, 
without any disruption of the normal operation of the ring. With an 
increase in the leading generator frequency, the whole ring begins to 
operate at that frequency. In that case, the phase lag of the other gen-
erators becomes less, and its reliable identification will be difficult in the 
presence of interference.
It is simpler to prevent frequency variation of a single generator when 
using a line structure (Figure 9.5c). In this structure, there is always a lead-
ing generator that uniquely determines the frequency of all the others. Any 
frequency fluctuation will be due to frequency deviation of this leading

generator. Frequency deviation of the other generators will not affect sys-
tem operation as single-phase synchronization will be maintained.
A three-phase power supply system can be assembled from three 
single-phase inverter modules with the appropriate phases. The output 
voltage of each module is the phase voltage and is supplied to uncoupled 
primary windings of a three-phase transformer or a group of single-phase 
transformers, or else the outputs of the modules are combined directly 
into a three-phase system, with three or four buses.
Inverter modules can also be connected in order to improve the har-
monic composition (spectrum) of the output voltage by pulse-amplitude 
modulation. In that case, the overall power of the system increases, and 
reservation of separate modules can be ensured. The output voltage is 
analogous to the waveform shown in Figure 9.1, except with consider-
able quantization ratios of the length and height of the voltage steps. 
Steps with the same output voltage frequency are in parallel. The length 
of the steps is determined by the frequency divider of a reference gen-
erator frequency. Of course, within each step, PWM can be organized. 
A generalized structure of the inverter modules connection is shown in 
Figure 9.6.
9.4  Voltage multipliers and voltage dividers based 
on capacitor–diode cells
The output voltage can be increased or decreased by means of capacitor–
diode cells. These are also known as transformer-free circuits (Zinov’ev, 
2003). In a conventional transformer circuit, a high-voltage transformer 
is used to increase the voltage. Systems consisting of low-voltage cells in 
series are preferable in engineering and economic terms. In voltage divid-
ers, capacitors connected in series and that have the ability to distribute 
high voltage are employed. Therefore, the transformer will be used for

galvanic isolation of the load and consumer circuits and can be eliminated 
from the circuit whenever possible.
9.4.1  Voltage multipliers
A simplest symmetric voltage doubler circuit is shown in Figure 9.7. During 
one half-period, the grid is connected through a diode to capacitor C1 and 
it is charged up to the amplitude of the input voltage. During the negative 
input voltage half-period, the capacitor C2 is charged. As a result, the load 
voltage is equal to the double voltage of the secondary windings of trans-
former T. The voltage ripple can be determined by the method developed 
for rectifiers with a capacitive output filter, taking account of the series 
connection of capacitors C1 and C2 during discharge. The average output 
voltage is approximately equal to the double input voltage. Obviously, the 
ripple level and the average voltage depend on the load value.
In Figure 9.8a, an asymmetric voltage doubler circuit is shown. In the 
negative half-period (uab < 0), diode VD1 is on, and capacitor C1 is charged 
up to the voltage amplitude of the secondary transformer winding. During 
the other half-period, capacitor C2 is charged from two sources in series: 
capacitor C1 and the secondary winding, through diode VD2. Thus, we 
obtain approximate doubling of the voltage. Using an asymmetric circuit 
cell, we can multiply the voltage by a factor of 2N for a system consisting 
of N cells. For example, when N = 3, we will have a six-time voltage-mul-
tiplying circuit (Figure 9.8b). The voltage ripple strongly depends on the 
load, which is typical for rectifiers with a capacitive filter.
Using a full-wave rectifier circuit, the capacitors in each cell will be 
charged alternately. In that case, we obtain a voltage multiplier based on 
single-phase bridges. This circuit consists of half-wave multipliers based 
on a six-time voltage-multiplying circuit (Figure 9.8b). In this circuit, the 
output capacitors are charged in each half-period that corresponds to the 
operation of bridge circuits.

In voltage-multiplying circuits, three-phase voltage can also be used. 
In that case, we can employ a series connection of capacitors and three-
phase bridge diode cells.
9.4.2  Voltage dividers
Self-commutated switches are employed in diode–capacitor voltage 
divider circuits. In one time period, the diode–capacitor cells are con-
nected in series to a high-voltage source. In the next period, these cells are 
connected in parallel to the load using switches. In Figure 9.9, a simplified 
voltage divider with self-commutated switches S1 and S2, and S3 and S4 
is shown. Both switch pairs operate synchronously, without overlap of 
the periods in which they are on. When S1 and S2 are on, and S3 and S4 
are off, the diode–capacitor cells are in series and capacitors C1, C2, C3, 
and C4 are charged by the high rectified voltage. The charging current 
is mainly limited by the internal impedance of the grid and by the resis-
tance of the diodes that are on. When switches S3 and S4 are on, and S1 
and S2 are off, the capacitors of all the cells are connected in parallel to the 
load Rd. The charging current of the output capacitor Cd is determined by 
the voltage difference between the charged capacitors and capacitor Cd. 
Obviously, it depends on the load resistance Rd. When the voltages at the 
cell capacitors and output capacitor are equal, switches S3 and S4 will be

duty ratio of switches S1–S4, we can regulate the output voltage.
The main drawbacks of diode–capacitor voltage dividers and voltage 
multipliers are the low power factor and distortion of the input current, 
which are typical problems of rectifier circuits with a capacitive filter.
9.5  Multilevel converter structures
In order to have high nominal voltage of converters, it is necessary to 
connect switching devices in series. At the same time, the use of multi-
level circuits not only increases the voltage relative to the rated voltage of 
separate switches, but also improves the harmonic spectrum of currents 
and voltages. Essentially, pulse-amplitude modulation and PWM can be 
combined in multilevel converters. At the same time, the switch values 
of di/dt and du/dt are reduced, and the noise is reduced. In addition, the 
combination of pulse-amplitude modulation and PWM allows a decrease 
in the modulation frequency. The term “multilevel” can be used for both 
inverters and rectifiers. The capabilities of different multilevel topologies 
are different, and only technical and economic study permits us to select 
one or another topology. In this section, the basic converter topologies for 
the example of multilevel inverters are considered (Corzine, 2002). These 
converters are applied in electric drives for frequency conversion and in 
the electric power industry for flexible ac transmission lines based on 
static compensators, active filters, and so on.
Two basic topologies are employed for multilevel converters.

Chapter nine:  Multilevel, modular, and multicell converter topologies
In the first case, diode-clamped circuits and circuits with clamping of 
capacitors by switches are considered. Also, there are different topologies 
of cascaded converter circuits.
9.5.1  Diode-clamped circuits
In Figure 9.10, a three-level inverter circuit is presented. The operation 
of these circuits can be illustrated by considering the equivalent circuits 
for one arm (e.g., phase a), as shown in Figure 9.11. The three states of the 
transistors correspond to the following equivalent circuits:
	
I.	The two upper transistors VT11 and VT12 are off, whereas VT41 and 
VT42 are on.
	
II.	Transistors VT11 and VT42 are off, whereas VT12 and VT41 are on.
	 III.	The two lower transistors VT41 and VT42 are off, whereas VT11 and 
VT12 are on.
The voltages of capacitors C1 and C2 are equal to half of the input 
voltage. If we assume only amplitude modulation, we obtain a square 
wave output voltage in phase a. In case I, the voltage is zero relative to

the bridge lower bus. In case III, it is equal to the input voltage Ud. In case 
II, the output voltage is equal to the voltage at capacitor C1 or C2. Thus, 
three voltage levels are ensured: 0, Ud/2, and Ud. As the voltage Ud/2 is 
switched, the switching losses are reduced, and the output voltage spec-
trum is improved. The voltage at the transistors is Ud/2, assuming the 
equal capacitor voltages. However, it is difficult to balance the voltages 
at the capacitors. This problem is solved by voltage level modulation. Of 
course, the number of levels can be increased, but that increases the dif-
ficulty in voltage balancing.
Figure 9.12 shows the output voltage waveforms for three- and four-
level inverters with PWM, which can be realized using different tech-
niques. In particular, space-vector modulation can be used. Obvious 
drawback of a three-phase diode-clamped inverter is the large number of 
transistors and the need for clamping diodes. However, the large number 
of switches ensures the increase in the converter power and the reduc-
ing of higher harmonics in the output voltage. As for the diodes, they are 
simpler and cheaper than the controlled switches. However, an increase 
in the number of voltage stages leads to an increase in the voltage at the 
clamping diodes of the first stage. Consequently, they must be connected 
in series, or else higher-voltage diodes must be employed. Diodes can be 
eliminated if the controlled switches of the circuit are used for clamping.

This is a modification of the circuit considered. It is known as a flying 
capacitor (Corzine, 2002).
9.5.2  Flying-capacitor inverters
In Figure 9.13, an example of a three-level flying-capacitor inverter circuit 
is shown. The capacitor C is charged to Ud/2 and, because it is connected 
in series with the dc source, ensures a third level in the output voltage. As 
a result, the upper and lower transistors form a voltage stage of magni-
tude Ud/2, as capacitor C is in series with the phase output. Obviously, it is 
again difficult to ensure voltage balancing in this case. An increase in the 
number of capacitors leads to an increase in the number of output voltage 
levels. For example, for a five-level inverter, the number of capacitors is 
increased by a factor of 6; the capacitors are connected in series here. The 
balancing of the voltages is also complicated. In addition, greater capaci-
tance is required than for the other circuits.
9.5.3  Multilevel cascaded converters
Cascaded topology is prospective for multiphase circuits. It is based 
on addition of separate dc power supply voltages. In these converters,

renewable source elements can be used, for example, a solar battery or 
a fuel cell, but ordinary rectifiers with input transformers are most com-
monly employed (Rodriguez et al., 2003). A diode rectifier circuit permits 
the simple design of such converter cells. It enables to design a multiphase 
rectifier with stepped input current. In Figure 9.14, one cell of a multilevel 
multiphase converter is shown. Using three cells in each phase, we can 
obtain an 18-pulse system on the basis of transformers whose secondary 
windings have different configurations. Also each cell contains a single-
phase voltage-source inverter. Its output voltage varies in sign and mag-
nitude from 0 to Ud. Applying PWM, we obtain a quasi-sinusoidal voltage 
with low modulation frequency. An increase in the number of stages

results in a desired approximation of the sinusoidal output voltage on the 
basis of pulse-amplitude modulation.
Using a cascaded single-phase full-bridge converter, we can obtain a 
multilevel structure with a required number of levels (Figure 9.15). Each 
bridge inverter cell generates three-level output voltages. A cascade con-
nection of bridges enables to have multilevel output voltage in each phase. 
Obviously, the selection of stages and level number is a typical multifactor 
optimization problem. Its solution depends on the output voltage level, 
the requirements on the modulation frequency, the application area, the 
control requirements, and other factors.

10.1  Improvement of the efficiency of power supply
10.1.1  Control of power transmission and power quality
10.1.1.1  Control of ac power flows
Power lines are characterized by distributed parameters, corresponding 
to active and inductive impedances in series and active conductance and 
capacitance in parallel. Usually, in overhead ac lines, the inductive imped-
ance exceeds the active impedance, whereas the capacitance exceeds the 
active conductance. Therefore, to simply the calculations, we consider an 
idealized line without active losses. In that case, the basic parameter is the 
wave impedance per unit length. When a matched load is attached to the 
end of a loss-free line, with wave impedance, all the energy of the incident 
wave supplied to any line segment is absorbed in the load. At a small 
load, when its impedance exceeds the wave impedance, the capacitance 
of the line is overcompensated, and the voltage is increased. With over-
loads, the line impedance is inductive, with reduction in the voltage. The 
excess or deficiency of reactive power must be compensated in order to 
stabilize the voltage in the line. To simplify the analysis, we adopt a point 
model of the line, consisting of the voltage sources of the two generators 
(which produce and receive the power), separated by inductive imped-
ance X = ωL (Figure 10.1). In that case, the active power transmitted is as 
follows (Burman et al., 2012):

(10.1)
where δ is the phase shift between the source voltage U1 and the con-
sumer voltage U2.
The voltage of the transmitting generator must lead that of the receiv-
ing generator. It follows from Equation 10.1 that the maximum transmit-
ted power will correspond to δ = π/2. The power flux may be regulated by 
the following basic means:
•	 Variation in the impedance X
•	 Variation in U1 and U2
•	 Variation in δ

418
Power electronics basics
The traditional methods are as follows:
•	 Compensation of the reactive power by connecting switched reac-
tors or capacitors in parallel with the load
•	 Compensation by connecting capacitors in series in the line
•	 Introducing phase shifters, which permit adjustment of δ and hence 
control of the power flux
10.1.1.2  Reactive-power compensation
The creation of thyristors was the first stage in the development of power 
electronics, associated with considerable improvement in our ability to 
control power transmission in ac grids. On the basis of thyristors, high-
speed switches and controllers have been created. Figure 10.2a shows a 
parallel compensation circuit based on capacitors and a thyristor-con-
trolled reactor (Rozanov, 2010).
Antiparallel thyristors permit switching of the reactor, as it is impos-
sible to control thyristors in series with capacitors by natural commuta-
tion. In this approach, regulation is based on adjustment of the phase α 
of the inductive power flux, from zero to the value corresponding to the 
reactor inductance Q

and the compensator current with a control angle α = 2π/3 and also the 
maximum possible current when α = π/2.
Combined use of capacitors and a reactor with thyristor control per-
mits smooth regulation of the reactive power, whether it is capacitive or 
inductive. Note that switches S1–S4 turn on the capacitors at zero volt-
age. For the thyristor compensator, the range of reactive-power regula-
tion is

where CΣ and L are the total capacitance in the line and the reactor induc-
tance, respectively, ω the angular frequency of the grid, and U the effec-
tive grid voltage.
This device is not only fast, but also reliable. Its main drawbacks are 
its considerable mass and size (because thyristors designed to control 
the total compensation power must be employed) and considerable cur-
rent distortion in the reactor. Various versions of the device are currently 
in use.
An alternative to series thyristors is the biased reactor. Its benefit is 
that only low power is required to control the bias current. This is usually 
a low-voltage, low-current device. It also permits modification of the com-
pensating power by regulating the inductance. However, it is more iner-
tial than the reactor whose current is regulated by antiparallel thyristors.
Two main circuits are used for series capacitor compensation based 
on thyristors (Figure 10.3). In the first, the capacitive sections are shunted 
by antiparallel thyristors in series (Figure 10.3a). To eliminate malfunc-
tioning of the semiconducting switches under the action of the capacitors’ 
discharge currents, these devices are switched on when the voltage in the 
corresponding capacitor section passes through zero. In the second, the 
capacitors and reactors are connected in series with antiparallel thyristors 
(Figure 10.3b). The reactors operate analogously to those in the system 
with parallel compensation. The current is regulated by phase control of

the thyristors. Depending on the thyristors’ control angle, the reactors 
compensate the series capacitance in the line. In the absence of capacitor 
compensation, the reactors are switched on to shunt the capacitors and are 
switched off in total compensation.
10.1.1.3  Phase shifters
Traditionally, electromechanical devices with considerable inertia were 
used to maintain the phase shift between the voltages in power transmis-
sion. The speed of phase shifters may be increased on the basis of power 
electronics. The main application of phase shifters is to regulate δ so as 
to maintain the power balance in transmission or to increase the stability 
of transmission systems during transient processes. Electronic switches 
significantly increase the efficiency of phase shifters.
On the basis of high-power self-commutated devices, such as gate 
turn-off (GTO) thyristors and power transistors, high-voltage convert-
ers can be designed for effective control of power fluxes. On the basis 
of an ac–dc converter with completely controllable switches, the static 
compensator has been developed. As interchange of the reactive power 
is required, electrolytic capacitors are used as temporary energy stores. 
Such capacitors are included on the dc side of the converter, operating in 
the voltage-inverter mode, so as to permit reactive-power exchange with 
the transmission line (Figure 10.4). This compensator is fast and relatively 
compact. Switching from the consumption of inductive power QL to capac-
itive-power generation QC and back takes less than one half-period of the 
fundamental voltage component. The current distortion due to this com-
pensator is slight, and its performance in transient conditions is excellent.
Due to advances in converters based on self-controlled switches, a 
new power controller has been developed on the basis solely of electronic 
power converters. The new device is known as a combined power flow 
controller. Essentially, the combined power flow controller combines the 
functions of series and parallel reactive-power compensators and filters. It 
may be regarded as a universal circuit for the creation of flexible ac lines. 
Figure 10.5a shows a block diagram of a unified power flow controller 
connected to a power line. It is based on two ac–dc converters (converter 1

and converter 2). They are both connected to the same capacitor C on the 
dc side. Converter 1 is connected in parallel to the power line, whereas 
converter 2 is connected in series with the line, through transformer T. As 
the converters are based on voltage inverters with pulse-width modula-
tion, they may operate in all four quadrants of the complex plane on the 
ac side. In that case, we may regard converter 1 as a consumer or generator 
of current whose first harmonic is in any quadrant of the complex plane 
relative to the voltage vector (Figure 10.5b). Converter 2, whose second-
ary windings are in series, generates or consumes power on the basis of 
T

the series voltage ΔU, whose first harmonic again can be in any quadrant 
of the complex plane relative to the current in the transformer winding 
(Figure 10.5c). Essentially, converter 2 acts as a voltage regulator. It follows 
from Figure 10.5b and c that the combined power flow controller not only 
permits reactive-power compensation, but also creates the phase-variable 
additional voltage ΔU. By adjusting the magnitude and phase of ΔU, we 
may vary the phase δ between the different points of the line and also 
control the magnitude and phase of the voltage at transformer T. As result, 
effective control of the power flux in the line is possible.
10.1.1.4  Power transmission and dc links
Power electronics has significantly improved the efficiency of ac and dc 
power transmission. Indeed, high-voltage dc power lines are widely used 
in practice today. The following deficiencies of high-voltage dc power 
lines have been minimized or eliminated due to power electronics:
•	 The high cost of the converter equipment
•	 The high content of higher voltage and current harmonics
At the same time, high-voltage dc power lines have the following ben-
efits in relation to ac transmission:
•	 No reactive power
•	 Scalar control of the power flux
•	 Lower transmission costs over distances greater than 500–800 km.
Figure 10.6 presents the approximate cost–distance graphs for dc and 
ac transmission (Sood, 2001). We see that the initial cost is considerably 
less for ac power lines. However, as the distance increases, dc transmis-
sion becomes more attractive. The main disadvantage of high-voltage dc

Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
power lines is that the transformation of direct current is not possible. 
Therefore, high-voltage dc lines are used for stretches without power 
delivery to consumers. Between 1987 and 1997, more than 47 high-voltage 
dc power lines went into operation around the world. The power of many 
high-voltage dc power lines is as much as 2000 MW, at voltages of 600 kV 
and above. Note that, in dc transmission, the power losses in the line are 
20–30 times less than those in ac transmission.
Potentially, power electronics permits the use of direct current not 
only in power transmission, but also in other applications, for example, in 
power generation from alternative sources and in uninterruptible power 
supply to electric drives. Again, the main obstacle is the impossibility of 
direct transformation. At the same time, dc–ac conversion costs are sig-
nificantly greater than the cost of a transformer. However, the situation 
may change dramatically with the development of faster and more power-
ful switches based on silicon carbide (SiC). In some countries, the devel-
opment of power transmission with dc links is underway. When using 
dc links, one option is to introduce an array of voltage inverters on the 
dc side. A bank of capacitive batteries is attached to the dc buses. As a 
result, the actual dc transmission line disappears. This short link is often 
known as a B2B (back-to-back) system (Figure 10.7). Thus, in this case, 
there is practically no transmission line due to localization of the convert-
ers (Burman et al., 2012).
10.1.1.5  Power quality control
Before the creation of completely controllable high-speed power elec-
tronic devices, power systems mainly employed thyristor-based convert-
ers. Powerful converters of that type were developed for use in electric 
drives, in electrometallurgy, in information transmission, and elsewhere. 
The consequence was significant loss of power quality and a decline in the 
efficiency of power utilization. New electronic devices not only eliminate

those problems, but also permit the development of equipment that 
improves power-transmission systems. On the basis of power electronic 
technology, we can, for example, control the magnitude and sign of the 
reactive power and hence the power factor cos φ; improve the harmonic 
composition of the currents and voltages; stabilize the voltage at specified 
points of the line; and ensure symmetry of the load currents and volt-
ages in three-phase systems. This topic was addressed in more detail in 
Chapter 7.
10.1.2  Power electronics for renewable energy sources 
and storages
Our energy problems today are best addressed by the development of 
renewable energy technologies, including solar, wind, and wave power. 
Such energy is directly related to the power of the sun, which is practically 
inexhaustible in comparison with traditional fuels such as coal, oil, and 
natural gas. New technologies for converting renewable energy to electric 
power are being developed on the basis of power electronic components. 
The most important function of such components is to integrate the renew-
able sources with grid, directly or through intermediate energy stores.
10.1.2.1  Solar cells
Solar energy may be converted into electric power by means of photoelec-
tric converters (solar cells). The development of solar cells depends on the 
production of silicon and the other materials required, in particular, thin 
films with a silicon coating (da Rosa, 2009; Sabonnadiere, 2009). Solar cells 
are based on semiconducting elements consisting of materials that form 
a p–n junction, resembling a diode. Under the action of photons falling 
on one of the surface layers of this structure (usually the n-type layer), a 
photoelectric process converts the energy of the electromagnetic radiation 
into electric power. Systems based on solar cells are essentially dc sources. 
Up to 10 kW, ac power is obtained by means of an inverter connected, 
in the general case, to a single-phase ac grid. In the absence of a grid, 
and with low-quality requirements on the output current, we may con-
nect the output of the solar cell directly to an inverter, which supplies the 
consumer. The quality of the output voltage may differ significantly from 
the standards for ac grid voltage and is determined by special require-
ments. In the presence of a grid, an additional dc converter is required 
(Figure 10.8), on account of the extreme instability of the output voltage 
from the solar cell. In addition, most systems include battery storage, so as 
to ensure stable voltage at the dc bus (Figure 10.8) (Rozanov and Kriukov, 
2008; Kryukov and Baranov, 2012).
Above 10 kW, three-phase power systems have been developed. They 
usually employ a single centralized inverter capable of operating with 

425
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
the grid. At the same time, dc converters are installed at the output of 
individual solar cells and panels. In these systems, the inverters must be 
chosen to facilitate integration with the grid and to ensure high quality of 
the power.
10.1.2.2  Wind turbines
Wind turbines convert the energy of the wind into mechanical energy, 
which is then transformed to electric power by the rotating turbine 
blades. These blades essentially form a propeller that initiates turbine 
operation. As the rotor speed (Alekseev, 2007) varies significantly, a gear-
box is installed to regulate the speed of the shaft on which the power 
generator is mounted. A dc generator is an easy-to-control system for 
converting the mechanical energy to electric power. However, problems 
associated with the type, quality, and transmission of the power must be 
solved in that case. The energy efficiency of wind systems may be sig-
nificantly increased on the basis of a synchronous generator with power 
electronic equipment. In that case, the voltage of the synchronous genera-
tor is sent to the input of a rectifier, which may be based on uncontrol-
lable switches in some circumstances. Then, the rectified voltage is sent to 
an inverter (Figure 10.9), which is connected directly to the grid. Either a 
voltage inverter or a current inverter may be used. Its operation with the 
grid may be greatly improved by using completely controllable electronic 
switches. By that means, the inverter may generate specified active and 
reactive power in the grid. It is also possible to ensure high quality of the 
current and to supply energy from the grid for battery charging.
Another option is to use an induction generator (IG) with a short-­
circuited rotor, but that entails regulation of the amplitude and frequency

Power electronics basics
with variation in the rotor speed. Special methods are required here, 
for example, combined operation with a rectifier–inverter cascade. An 
inverter based on completely controllable electronic switches must be 
used in that case; a step-up dc converter may also be needed. However, 
a more promising approach is to use a source of controllable capacitive 
power such as a static converter. In that case, the IG can send active energy 
to the grid and draw from it the required reactive power (Figure 10.10).
A fundamentally new approach involves an asynchronized synchro-
nous generator. Its rotor has two windings, which may effectively be con-
trolled by static converters. In principle, this generator may operate with 
the grid as its rotor speed varies. Power may be supplied to the rotor wind-
ings from a frequency converter in which the voltage is phase-shifted by 
90°, and its frequency is the slipping frequency. The resulting magnetic 
field, which turns at the slipping frequency, ensures synchronous rota-
tion of the exciting field and the generator’s stator. The efficiency of the

asynchronized synchronous generator is especially evident at consider-
able turbine speeds with a gearbox of limited capabilities. The frequency 
control of the voltage supplied to the winding ensures highly stable syn-
chronous operation of the asynchronized synchronous generator with 
the grid.
10.1.2.3  Fuel cells
Traditionally, most power is produced by converting thermal energy into 
mechanical energy and then into electrical energy. However, the efficiency 
of thermal machines is not more than 40%. Significantly higher efficiency 
can be obtained by means of fuel cells (da Rosa, 2009).
In fuel cells, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy. The 
inverse process is also possible: regeneration (electrolysis) of water, with 
the liberation of the absorbed heat. In regeneration, the water formed in 
fuel-cell operation is broken down into the initial elements of the fuel: 
hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, because the fuel cell permits not only the 
generation of electric power from fuel, but also the production of hydro-
gen from water in regeneration, it has a relatively broad spectrum of func-
tional capabilities.
The fuel cell produces direct current. Low-power systems (up to 
10 kW) are usually employed with a single-phase grid. The source for the 
fuel cell is selected so as to ensure the mean rated power, whereas the 
peak loads must be covered by an energy store such as a battery. A simpli-
fied block diagram of the fuel cell connection is shown in Figure 10.11. The 
basic power components are a dc converter and an inverter. To produce 
a more compact system, a high-frequency element is generally included. 
Its output is connected to a transformer T with the required output volt-
age. In such structures, both dc and ac output channels are possible. To 
improve the size and mass of the unit, dc converters with galvanic uncou-
pling may also be employed. In that case, an inverter without an output 
transformer is connected to the output of the dc converter.
Fuel cells have been successfully used in uninterruptible power 
sources (UPSs). The fuel cell is connected to a traditional UPS with a bat-
tery storage. This significantly increases the possible operating period of 
the uninterruptible source.
Above 10 kW, fuel cells are used with a three-phase grid. With an 
increase in power, dc converters with galvanic uncoupling of the output

Power electronics basics
buses from the power sources are mainly employed. The inverter directly 
connected to the grid or load is also based on completely controllable 
switches of the corresponding power.
Powerful hybrid systems (10 MW or more) operate with output voltages 
up to 10 kV, based on IGCT and IGBT (these devices were considered in detail 
in Chapter 2). The microturbine has a generator producing voltage sent to a 
three-phase rectifier and then to the common dc buses of the system. The 
output inverter of the system, which connects it to the grid, is a two-level 
system based on IGCT, corresponding to an input voltage of 6000 V.
Globally, the two main applications of fuel cells today are stationary 
power sources and automobile drive systems. Stationary power sources 
currently cover the range from tens of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts.
10.2  Electric drives
Electric drives are major power consumers. Power electronic components 
may significantly improve the efficiency of power use and reduce power 
losses by drawing higher-quality current from the grid and expanding 
controllability. For example, current and voltage distortion may be almost 
completed and eliminated over broad ranges; automatic transition from 
energy consumption to recuperation and back may be ensured; and pre-
cise conformity of the operating conditions to the control specifications 
can be maintained.
10.2.1  Control of dc machines
In dc machines, the conductors in the armature interact with the magnetic 
field created by the exciting winding on the stator. This produces a torque, 
which turns the rotor. To maintain the torque as the conductors move in 
the magnetic field, the direction of the current in the armature winding 
is reversed. This entails switching of the current from some turns of the 
winding to others.
The current may be supplied to the exciting winding by various 
means: independent, series, and mixed. Usually, in vehicle drives, series 
and mixed excitation is employed. In industrial electric drives, indepen-
dent excitation is employed. We know that dc machines are reversible: 
they may operate as motors or as generators. The goal of control is pri-
marily to change the rotor speed. The following types of operation can be 
considered (Figure 10.12):
•	 Forward rotation
•	 Braking in forward rotation
•	 Reverse rotation
•	 Braking in reverse rotation

429
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
In forward rotation, the machine operates at a supply voltage Ua 
exceeding the emf Ea created in the armature. This corresponds to motor 
operation in quadrant I. In steady operation, the torque developed at the 
shaft is equal to the load torque. The machine consumes the armature 
current. In quadrant II, braking occurs. This is associated with the recu-
peration of energy to the grid. To accept this energy, the source must have 
bidirectional conductivity. In this case, the armature emf Ea exceeds the 
source voltage Ua and the armature current reverses direction, so that it 
begins to oppose the emf of the source, which consumes the supplied 
energy. In quadrant III, the rotation of the machine is reversed. It resumes 
operation in the motor mode, consuming energy from the source. This 
corresponds to change in polarity of the armature emf at the brushes. 
However, the direction of the armature current is consistent with the 
polarity of the source emf, and thus energy is consumed from the source. 
In quadrant IV, braking begins again, and energy is recuperated from the 
machine to the source. In this generator mode, the machine rotates in the 
opposite direction to quadrant II.
At present, the speed or the torque at the shaft is mainly regulated 
by means of controllable rectifiers, which permit variation in the arma-
ture voltage. Rectifiers are also widely used to create the exciting current. 
However, rectifiers based on completely controllable switches are more

Power electronics basics
efficient. In particular, relatively powerful (1 MW or more) ac–dc convert-
ers may be based on power transistors or switchable thyristors of GCT 
type (see Chapter 2). This is possible for converters with the properties of 
a current source or a voltage source, on the basis of pulse-width modula-
tion at high modulation frequency. The use of such converters permits an 
increase in the power factor and a decrease in the distortion of the supply 
voltage and the current drawn from the grid in all operating conditions, 
including recuperation.
Systems based on pulsed dc converters may be used to control low- 
and moderate-power motors. Such converters are effective for compo-
nents with dc voltage of current sources.
10.2.2  Control of induction motors
Induction motors are commonly used for the conversion of electrical 
energy into mechanical energy. Accordingly, the control of their speed 
and torque is of great importance. However, this problem is complicated, 
in that the rotor speed is controlled by the grid and the motor’s start-
ing currents are very large. Therefore, in vehicles, the norm has been to 
use dc motors, which are much more controllable, even though the use of 
ac power predominates and ac–dc conversion is required. However, the 
development of power electronics has changed this situation.
In the induction motor, three-phase alternating current interacts with 
the current that it induces in a winding or in the short-circuited rotor 
turns. The speed and torque of an induction motor may be controlled by 
adjusting the voltage applied to the stator and the rotor slip s. The follow-
ing control methods are known:
•	 Adjustment of the voltage at the stator
•	 Variation in rotor slip by introducing additional impedance or an ac 
voltage source in the rotor circuit
•	 Frequency modification of the voltage supplied to the stator
•	 Simultaneous change in the stator voltage and its frequency
These are known as scalar methods, as they are associated with varia-
tion in controllable parameters. A relatively new group of methods has been 
made possible by the appearance of completely controllable high-speed 
switches and by the development of pulse-width modulation and digital 
control. These are known as vector methods. They permit more precise 
positional control, analogous to the control of dc motors in a servo drive.
10.2.2.1  Scalar control
Control of the stator voltage. Control of the stator voltage by means of an ac 
thyristor-based voltage regulator is very simple (Figure 10.13). However, it 

431
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
is associated with considerable distortion of the stator voltage and a sharp 
increase in the higher harmonics, with additional power losses and over-
all deterioration in motor performance. The content of higher harmonics 
increases with an increase in the thyristor control angle α. With a larger 
range of voltage regulation, the change in the voltage distortion is greater.
Control of the rotor slip. With an increase in resistance of the rotor wind-
ings, the characteristics change considerably. In particular, the maximum 
torques are shifted to lower speed. The resistance is usually changed in 
steps, by means of relay-contact equipment. To eliminate stepwise varia-
tion, additional resistance may be introduced in the rotor circuit in pulses, 
which permits smooth regulation of its equivalent value. This circuit may 
be based on a completely controllable semiconductor device such as a 
GTO. The frequency of pulse operation determines (together with the 
reactor inductance L) the current pulsation in the rotor, which affects the 
pulsation at the motor shaft.
The energy scattered in the resistor may be replaced by energy sup-
plied to the grid in inversion. To that end, the pulsed regulator and resis-
tor are replaced by a switched cascade.
Regulating the magnitude and frequency of the stator voltage. If the stator 
voltage is held constant, its frequency may be reduced to increase the flux 
or increased to decrease the flux.
Such regulation of an induction motor permits its operation with an 
unsaturated magnetic system; its speed may be adjusted with practically 
constant motor torque or power. For example, with constant torque M,

we obtain U/f = const; for a fan load with M = kω2, we obtain U/f2 = const; 
and, with constant power P, we obtain U
f =  const. In frequency and 
voltage regulation, the motor’s mechanical characteristics vary in accor-
dance with the control law. In particular, with constant power P at the 
motor shaft, the speed dependence of the torque is hyperbolic, and the 
mechanical characteristics correspond to Figure 10.14.
For motors of low and moderate power, frequency control is most 
often based on frequency converters with a distinct dc element.
Better results are obtained with a frequency converter that may be 
regarded basically as an inverter with a completely controllable rectifier. 
In that case, we obtain a two-module frequency converter based on two 
practically identical ac–dc converters. One converter operates as a com-
pletely controllable rectifier with pulse-width modulation; its power fac-
tor is close to 1 and there is little distortion of the grid current. In that case, 
the electric drive resembles a linear active load. The higher harmonics due 
to voltage modulation are removed by a relatively mild LC filter. This fre-
quency converter may be regarded as ideal, except for its cost.
Direct frequency converters may be used for the control of very pow-
erful motors. When based on thyristors, such converters are characterized 
by low input power coefficient and limited frequency range.
Frequency converters based on a current inverter are widely used to 
control induction motors of large and moderate power. In such convert-
ers, the rectifier and inverter are separated by a reactor of relatively large 
inductance, so that they behave as a current source.
10.2.2.2  Vector control
Vector control of induction motors is actively under development at pres-
ent. These methods are based on resolving the stator-current vector into 
two orthogonal components. One component determines the magnetic 
flux, whereas the other corresponds to the motor torque. In this case, we 
may note the analogy with a dc machine that has independent excitation.

Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
The magnetic flux of this machine is determined by the exciting current 
and the position of the stator poles, whereas the armature current deter-
mines the torque at the motor shaft. In turn, different coordinates may 
be selected in the resolution of the stator-current vector, in particular, 
coordinates relative to the rotor or stator flux. With different coordinates, 
the methods will differ in ways that are not fundamental. Essentially, 
these methods are based on the spatial orientation of the magnetic field; 
correspondingly, they are sometimes known as field-orientation meth-
ods. A detailed classification of vector-control methods may be found 
in Kazmierkowski et al. (2002). On the basis of the foregoing, induction 
motors may be controlled by a voltage source with voltage and frequency 
variation and by means of components such as microcontrollers and 
sensors.
An example of vector control was presented in Rozanov and Sokolova 
(2004). This method is based on a modified equivalent circuit of the motor, 
in which the inductive impedance of the rotor is reduced to zero by select-
ing the reduction coefficient.
10.2.3  Control of synchronous machines
In synchronous machines, the rotating magnetic field created by the sta-
tor winding interacts with the magnetic flux created by the rotor. As the 
resultant magnetic flux is created by the combined motion of the stator 
and rotor, the resultant magnetic field in the synchronous machine turns 
with the same speed as the rotor, in steady conditions. Many different 
designs of synchronous machines exist. The range has greatly expanded 
with the development of power electronics. New options include switched 
motors, brushless motors, and self-synchronizing machines. Rectifiers are 
widely used in the exciting systems of synchronous machines.
Thus, all types of synchronous machines are characterized by syn-
chronous rotation of the stator’s magnetic field and the rotor, in steady 
conditions. These machines differ not only in design, but also in their 
applications.
10.2.3.1  Control of synchronous motors with adjustable excitation
Because the speeds of the resultant rotating magnetic field and the rotor 
are equal, synchronous motors are ideal for applications that require pre-
cise control of the speed or torque developed at the shaft. In synchronous 
machines with nonsalient rotor and stator poles, the air gap is uniformly 
distributed over the circumference of the stator, and the reactance does 
not depend on the rotor position. In that case, the angle θ between the 
armature voltage Ua and the emf Ea induced by the exciting magnetic flux 
is determined by the total synchronous impedance of the synchronous 
machine. The value of θ is determined by the load of the synchronous 

434
Power electronics basics
machine; it is known as the load angle. In the generator mode, Ua lags the 
emf Ea and θ is regarded as positive; in the motor mode, Ua leads Ea and θ 
is negative. The power factor cos φ characterizes the phase shift between 
the voltage U applied to the synchronous machine and the current ia of 
the armature winding and depends not only on the load, but also on the 
exciting current ie. The family of V-shaped curves Ia = f (Ie) (Figure 10.15) 
can be divided into two regions: overexcitation (φ > 0) and underexcita-
tion (φ < 0). As the sign of the angle between the current and the volt-
age depends on the magnitude of the exciting current, the synchronous 
generator may be used as a reactive-power compensator with zero active 
power. In overexcitation, reactive power is generated (capacitive behav-
ior); in underexcitation, reactive power is consumed (inductive behavior).
Semiconductor converters may be used to control synchronous 
machines, analogous to induction machines. In this respect, the develop-
ment of power electronics has significantly expanded the potential of elec-
tric drives. The control methods are based on variation of the magnitude 
and frequency of the grid voltage and are implemented by different types 
of frequency converters. The best option to control the speed and torque 
of low- and moderate-power synchronous machines is a converter with 
an explicit dc element based on completely controllable switches. A fre-
quency converter with reversible ac–dc converters and with pulse-width 
modulation, which behaves as a voltage source, has a mirror structure. 
Consequently, the system has good performance: the input power coef-
ficient is close to 1, and the input current and output voltage are close to 
sinusoidal. A deficiency of this approach is high cost, as both components

of the frequency converter are based on completely controllable switches. 
A common microprocessor controller permits digital control of practically 
all the functional components. The second component of the frequency 
converter operates mainly in the inverter mode, ensuring control of the 
motor speed and torque. However, in braking, the frequency converter 
operates in the opposite mode: the output component becomes a control-
lable rectifier, whereas the input component becomes an inverter, recuper-
ating energy to the grid.
For high-power synchronous machines (above 1 MW) operating at 
low frequency, a thyristor frequency converter with direct coupling is 
employed. It permits variation in the energy flux in braking and control 
of the magnitude and frequency of the armature voltage in the synchro-
nous motor. Regulation of the voltage over a wide range leads to consider-
able impairment of the system’s power factor, which must be taken into 
account in design. Benefits of the traditional frequency converter with 
direct coupling include a simple control system and the possibility of 
multiphase configurations for better thyristor utilization and improved 
harmonic composition of the armature voltage.
10.2.3.2  Control of switched motors
Switched motors are machines in which electronic switches ensure cur-
rent commutation in the armature. In particular, brush commutation in 
the armature supply system of dc machines can be replaced by electronic 
commutation, with a significant improvement in motor life. However, 
interest in switched motors based on synchronous machines is growing 
due to the development of power electronics and production technology 
for permanent magnets. On the basis of power electronics, completely 
controllable switches may be incorporated in frequency converters with 
pulse-width modulation; in permanent-magnet production, new materi-
als with magnetic energy have been developed for the rotors, in particu-
lar, neodymium–iron–boron alloy (Ni–Fe–B). As a result, it is possible to 
create completely brushless switched dc machines that match the control-
lability of dc machines and outperform the induction motors currently in 
industrial use.
Such switched motors are based on self-synchronization of the rotor 
with the speed of the armature field. The rotor may be based on a per-
manent magnet or an exciting winding. The magnitude and frequency 
of the armature voltage are varied by means of a frequency converter 
with an explicit inverter component or with direct coupling to the grid. 
Completely controllable electronic switches are more expensive but per-
mit the creation of high-performance converters. For example, a power 
factor close to 1 may be maintained over the whole range of the magni-
tude and frequency of the output voltage, if the rectifier in the converter is 
based on completely controllable switches. If the frequency converter with 

436
Power electronics basics
direct coupling is based on completely controllable switches, the power 
factor will again be close to 1.
Figure 10.16 shows a switched motor with a rotor based on permanent 
magnets when power is supplied from a frequency converter with a volt-
age-source inverter (Rahman et al., 2001). In this motor, the rotor position 
determines when the control pulses for the inverter switches are formed. 
The rotor turns under the action of the torque produced by the interac-
tion the magnetic fluxes created by the rotor and the armature winding, 
as their axes approach. In steady conditions, the rotor is synchronous 
with the inverter’s output voltage. The frequency may be regulated by a 
proportional change in the inverter voltage. Other methods can be used 
to control the inverter frequency, with self-synchronization of the rotor. 
For example, for a synchronous machine with a rotor that has an excit-
ing winding, the exciting current may be modified. Motors of this type 
are characterized by feedback with respect to the rotor position. We can 
also use a current-source inverter, rather than a voltage-source inverter. 
That design is cheaper and ensures good motor performance. However, at 
low speed, the counter-emf in the armature may be insufficient for thyris-
tor commutation. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of the current 
inverter are worse than those of the voltage inverter, overall.
10.2.3.3  Switched reluctance motors
Researchers are increasingly interested in electric motors whose rotor is 
based on a laminated stack of electrical-engineering steel in different con-
figurations. These are salient-pole rotors, usually with a toothed outline. In 
this design, the reluctance between the stator and the rotor will depend on 
the rotor position. When the exciting winding on the stator is connected to 
an ac source, a rotating magnetic field is produced. Because of the difference 
in longitudinal and transverse reluctance, a torque arises and tends to turn

the rotor in the direction corresponding to minimum inductive impedance 
between the stator and the rotor or maximum inductance. Single-phase alter-
nating current can be supplied to the exciting winding. A reactive torque on 
the rotor appears here. These are sometimes known as reactive motors.
The development of power electronics and microprocessor technol-
ogy has permitted the creation of high-performance motors on the basis 
of reactive motors, with electronic switching of the stator winding. The 
appearance of self-commutated switches permits periodic switching of 
the stator winding at high frequency. In that case, the pulsed voltage 
formed by the electronic switches connected to a dc source is supplied to 
the exciting winding of the motor stator (Figure 10.17b). This is known as a 
switched reluctance motor (SRM) (Iqbal, 2002). The operation of this motor 
is based on switching of exciting windings on the stator, which create a 
rotating magnetic field. The rotor of the SRM tends to occupy a position 
in which the reluctance between the excited stator pole and the rotor is

Power electronics basics
a minimum. That corresponds to the operating principle of the reactive 
motor. Note that the stator is also usually toothed; hence, this is a salient-
pole stator. In Figure 10.17a, as an example, an SRM with a three-phase, 
six-tooth stator is shown (Rahman et al., 2001). The phase windings are on 
diametrically opposed teeth. Thus, the magnetic flux in the motor takes 
a pulsating form due to switching of the windings. In the general case, 
the magnetic flux is a nonlinear function of the exciting current ie and 
the rotor-position angle ϑ. The control pulse responsible for switching the 
exciting winding is formed by the control system of the electronic com-
mutator on the basis of the signal from the rotor-position sensor.
Different designs can be used for the power electronic commuta-
tor. The most common is shown in Figure 10.17b. When the transistors 
in series with a particular winding are switched on, voltage and hence 
current will be supplied from the source. As a result, the current in that 
winding will increase, and the rotor will turn in that direction. Switching 
on the other winding involves switching off the pair of transistors that 
are already on and switching off the two transistors connected to that 
winding. However, switching off the first pair of transistors will turn on 
the diodes connected to the same winding and the voltage source Ud. As a 
result, the exciting winding that is being turned off will be demagnetized, 
with the return of the stored energy to the source.
Various methods can be used to control the motor speed and torque. 
For instance, the magnitude and frequency of the voltage at the exciting 
winding may be regulated. A more effective approach is to regulate the 
rotor position angle, which determines the times ϑon and ϑoff at which the 
rotor exciting windings are turned on and off, respectively. In Figure 10.18,

a simplified version of a control system for an SRM is shown. This struc-
ture corresponds to control of the voltage U and the angles ϑon and ϑoff. 
Tracking of the current in the motor phases is a more effective control 
method.
10.3  Engineering applications
10.3.1  Lighting
Given that lighting accounts for more than 20% of all power consumption, 
we see that there is an obvious need to increase the energy efficiency of 
lighting systems, that is, the ratio of the lamp’s light flux to its power con-
sumption. The light output of discharge lamps has significantly increased. 
Their basic component is the ballast, which determines their efficiency. 
Traditional ballast has some serious limitations. On the basis of power 
electronics, the ballast may be replaced by power converters with working 
frequencies up to 100 kHz, which permits the elimination of undesirable 
frequencies. Due to the high frequency of the power converter and new 
circuit designs, converters that are light and compact may be produced. 
The introduction of such converters in electronic ballast has led to the 
widespread adoption of discharge lamps in homes and in industry.
The new electronic ballast differs fundamentally from traditional bal-
last based on chokes and capacitors.
Figure 10.19 shows the generalized structure of standard electronic 
ballast. It consists of an input filter to eliminate electromagnetic interfer-
ence, a rectifier, a high-frequency inverter, high-frequency electronic bal-
last, a control system, and a feedback circuit.
The electromagnetic interference filter consists of interconnected reac-
tors and capacitors within a single framework. The rectifier may be based 
on diodes or transistors. When transistors are used, control on the basis of 
pulse-width modulation ensures sinusoidal input current and regulation 
of the input voltage. The inverter is usually based on resonant circuits 
that ensure transistor switching at zero current or voltage. This reduces

Power electronics basics
the power losses. At the same time, there are fundamental constraints on 
the selection of the inverter design. The high-frequency electronic ballast 
limits the current in the event of short-circuiting of the lamp. This func-
tion may be performed both by a low-inductance high-frequency choke 
and by a small capacitance, determined by the high working frequency 
of the inverter. The control system of the inverter and rectifier may be 
based on the same microprocessor. Depending on the parameter being 
regulated, there may be several feedback channels and sensor locations. 
For example, the discharge current may be regulated directly on the basis 
of the lamp circuit current. In addition, the feedback channels can be used 
for protection in the event of accidents and for diagnostic purposes.
10.3.2  Electrotechnology
Various forms of electrotechnology were developed in the middle of the 
nineteenth century, in particular, heat treatment, electric welding, and 
electrophysical and electrochemical machining.
10.3.2.1  Electrical heating
Electrical systems are used for heating and melting of various materials, 
primarily metals. Resistive, electric-arc, inductive, and other types of heat-
ing are employed. Resistive heating is used in electrofurnaces of different 
types. Such heating depends on thermal energy created by current as it 
flows directly through a material (direct or contact heating) or through 
heating elements that are able to transfer the heat to the material (indi-
rect heating). Direct resistive heating is used for metals; indirect heating 
may be used for any material. In both cases, the heating conditions are 
regulated by adjusting the current flow. The current may be regulated by 
various methods, for example, if a transformer is employed, by tapping 
different points of the winding. It is more effective to use thyristor regula-
tion of the load current. Antiparallel thyristors are used for that purpose. 
The current is regulated by adjusting the relative length of the periods 
during which the thyristors are on and off, in terms of the period of the 
input voltage. With a resistive load, the phase shift of the current and volt-
age may be neglected, and the regulator may be switched on and off at 
zero current and voltage, in contrast to phase control of the thyristors. A 
benefit of this approach is that there are practically no switching losses 
and no higher current harmonics in the grid. However, a significant dis-
advantage is the creation of a discrete load, which varies at low frequen-
cies (about 4–10 Hz). Periodic switching of the load leads to low-frequency 
fluctuation of the voltage. In that case, the spectral composition of the load 
vibrations hinders filtration by traditional methods. Active filters prove 
more effective. As the cost of electronic switches declines, active filters are 
becoming more affordable.

441
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
Inductive heating of metals is widely used. In inductive heating, the 
interaction of the metal with an electromagnetic field generates eddy cur-
rents, with consequent loss of active power, which is converted into heat. 
The power losses depend on factors such as the magnetic field strength, 
the penetration depth of the eddy currents in the metal, and its shape and 
electromagnetic characteristics. Frequency converters with a high-fre-
quency inverter are generally used to supply power to induction furnaces. 
Depending on the circumstances, inverters with a frequency between 
50 Hz and 1 MHz can be employed. The penetration depth of the current 
in the metal is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency.
Figure 10.20 shows the structure of the frequency converter used for 
power supply of a standard inductive heater. A system with a resonant 
inverter is used to create a high-frequency voltage at the converter output. 
It may be based on a current inverter or a voltage inverter. The resonant 
circuits in the inverters are formed by connecting a capacitor or a capaci-
tor and a reactor to the load, which in this case is an induction coil con-
taining a metal blank. In a voltage inverter, a capacitor is connected in 
series with the load. In a current inverter, the resonance loop is formed 
by connecting a reactor in series and connecting a capacitor and the load 
in parallel. Frequency regulation permits control of the power in the load, 
and the capacitance and inductance of the loop determine its resonant 
frequency. The ratio of the working and resonant frequencies significantly 
affects the operating conditions and characteristics of the inverter. A cur-
rent inverter provides better protection of the converter in emergencies. 
The voltage inverter is lighter and more compact.
By means of resonant inverters, it is simple to organize natural com-
mutation, and so ordinary thyristors may be employed. Natural commu-
tation of the inverter may be associated with limitations on the output 
frequency regulation. The working frequency of thyristor inverters can-
not usually exceed 10 kHz. This limit is determined by the speed of the 
thyristors. The frequency may be increased in modular systems, by multi-
plying the frequency of a single module.
The inverter frequency may be significantly increased—by about 
an order of magnitude, depending on the power—if we use high-speed 
switches, such as IGBT, which also increase the converter cost. The

frequency may be further boosted by using vacuum triodes to excite oscil-
latory processes in a high-frequency LC circuit.
10.3.2.2  Electric welding
Systems with an input transformer are usually employed to supply power 
to electric welding equipment (Figure 10.21a). For safety purposes, gal-
vanic uncoupling with the grid is essential. In the simplest case, the sta-
bility of arc combustion may be ensured by connecting a reactor in series. 
The volt–ampere characteristic at the output will then decline steeply. An 
analogous load characteristic may be ensured by means of a special trans-
former structure that ensures large scattering inductance. To regulate the 
welding current, various current stabilizers may be introduced at the rec-
tifier output. In particular, dc converters with output-current stabilization 
may be used for that purpose.
A deficiency of welding equipment with an input transformer is 
excessive mass and size on account of the transformer, which operates at 
the low grid frequency. This problem can be eliminated by using a con-
verter with a higher frequency link of a high-frequency voltage-source 
inverter (Figure 10.21b). The working frequency of such inverters is usu-
ally above the audible range. An inverter is used for current regulation 
within the equipment.
10.3.2.3  Other uses
Power electronics can also be used in electrophysical machining. For 
example, rectifiers may be employed to produce pulse generators used in 
electrospark machining in electric discharges. Various power sources for 
electrolysis equipment are used in the production of hydrogen–oxygen 
mixture in metal welding. Most of these devices are based on rectifiers, 
autonomous inverters, and thyristor regulators.

Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
The use of completely controllable high-speed switches signifi-
cantly improves the performance of electrophysical machining systems. 
Microprocessor-based control systems boost the efficiency of power con-
version by more precise switch regulation.
Another application of power electronics is in industrial vibrators 
employed over a broad frequency range. Such systems are used, to name 
only a few examples, for underwater research in hydroacoustics; for more 
efficient borehole operation in the oil industry; and for the electromag-
netic dosing of powders. Depending on the circumstances, different con-
verters may be employed: from the simplest pulsed thyristor interrupters 
to frequency converters with controllable output parameters.
10.3.3  Electrical transportation
10.3.3.1  Railway transport
Both dc and ac electrification is used for railroads. The power supply to 
traction motors in electric trains comes from diesel–electric generators 
or from external sources (by way of overhead lines or third rails). At 
present, 1500 and 750 V dc motors predominate. The diesel–electric sys-
tems employed use ac or dc generator, as required. External sources take 
the form of tractional substations containing thyristor-based rectifiers 
and inverters (ac/dc converters). Note that these substations consider-
ably impair the quality of the power from external ac grids, on account 
of nonlinear and peak loads. At present, dc grids run at 3 kV. When the 
locomotive employs ac voltage up to 25 kV, the rectifiers and inverters 
may be installed directly on the train to the locomotive, which simpli-
fies the traction substations. The ac voltage is supplied to the locomo-
tive step-down transformers and then passes through converters to the 
traction motor. In the case of a direct dc supply, the locomotive trac-
tion motor is controlled by stepped regulation of the armature volt-
age. Stabilizing resistors permit recuperation of the power, while the 
direction of motion is changed by reversing the current in the exciting 
windings. When using ac thyristor converters in the locomotive, phase 
control of the output voltage is employed. In phase control, the angles 
at which the thyristors are switched on in rectifier and inverter modes 
are adjusted. Therefore, this method reduces the power factor of the 
converter and creates distortion of the current drawn from the grid. To 
reduce the harmful impact on the ac grid, the locomotives and substa-
tions employ passive LC filters and capacitive compensation of the reac-
tive power.
The introduction of ac traction motors began with the development 
of power electronics. In particular, simple and reliable induction motors 
were used with frequency converters. The motor speed and torque may 
be regulated by adjusting the converter voltage and its frequency. Today, 

444
Power electronics basics
manufacturers have developed a number of traction motors based on 
induction motors and controllable frequency converters with a dc element.
10.3.3.2  Urban transport
This category includes streetcars, trolleybuses, and subways. We will 
consider the example of streetcars; the characteristics are similar for the 
other systems. The basic power source is a dc substation with a maximum 
working voltage of 900 V. Most traction motors used in urban light rail 
are based on contact–resistor control. At the same time, cyclic operation of 
the traction motors ensures starting, acceleration, and braking. The peri-
odic modification of such cycles complicates motor operation, shortens 
motor life, and leads to considerable power losses. These problems may 
be addressed by introducing semiconductor converters both for control of 
the traction motors and for providing incidental power for lighting of the 
cars, door operation, and so on.
10.3.3.3  Automotive applications
The introduction of power electronic components in cars and trucks sig-
nificantly increases the automation of the vehicles’ basic subsystems and 
expands their functions. The basic source of power in modern vehicles is 
a switched three-phase synchronous generator with a rotating excitation 
system. The generator’s output voltage is rectified and sent to the dc bus, 
to which a battery is also connected (a 12 or 24 V battery, depending on 
the vehicle).
Today, the power of such generators is about 1 kW. From the basic dc 
bus, power is sent to various subsystems: the ignition, the lights, the air 
conditioning, the brakes, and so on. The total power consumption by these 
subsystems is steadily increasing and is expected to reach 1800 kW in the 
coming decades. The increase in power is associated with expansion of 
their functions on the basis of power electronic components. We will now 
briefly consider some examples of their use (Perreault et al., 2001).
In the lighting subsystem, incandescent lamps are being replaced by 
discharge lamps. This triples the luminous efficiency and extends the 
working life by a factor of 4–5. Power supply to discharge lamps requires a 
voltage of 42 V and high-frequency electronic ballast. Accordingly, we need 
a dc converter to increase the 12–42 V, an inverter based on MOS transis-
tors, and electromagnetic ballast ensuring ignition and maintenance of the 
discharge in the lamp. The working frequency of the inverter is 96–250 Hz. 
Prospectively, this configuration can be used for power supply to all dis-
charge lamps, as incandescent lamps are progressively replaced. Pulse-
width modulation can be used here to regulate the lamp’s luminous flux.
In modern vehicles, a high-frequency ac drive powers the windshield 
wipers. Controllable high-frequency ac voltage can be created by inverters 
from the dc voltage at the common bus.

445
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
The power source for the motor’s electromagnetic valves should also 
control their operation. To that end, we use inverters regulating the cur-
rent in the electromagnetic coils of the valve drive.
The air conditioning relies on a switched synchronous motor, con-
trolled by a thyristor-based frequency converter. In that case, the opera-
tion of the air conditioner does not depend on the vehicle’s engine.
A switched dc drive is used for independent control of the pump 
drive in the vehicle’s hydraulic system.
To reduce the wiring required in modern vehicles, designers have 
begun to use multiplex control of the subsystems, with transmission 
of the control signals in code through common conductors, depend-
ing on the function and position of the executive devices. This sharply 
reduces the quantity and weight of the wiring on board the vehicle. 
Smart relays are used to switch on and off the consumers in multiplex 
systems. Such relays have built-in amplifiers, as well as safety and moni-
toring elements. Signals from the microprocessor in the vehicle’s control 
system are sent to the input of the smart relays.
In the future, vehicles may have a dual 14/42 V power system. The 
42 V bus will be supplied from a rectifier, in the traditional manner, and 
will be used for high-power consumers such as the starter and the air 
conditioner. The 14 V bus will be supplied from a 42/14 V dc converter 
and will meet the needs of lighting and low-power electronic devices, for 
instance. In this system, low-voltage batteries may be used to supply the 
starter. This is possible when using a converter with reversal of the energy 
flow.
An interesting option is the use of switched reluctance machines in a 
direct electric drive, rather than the belt drive currently employed. In that 
case, a power electronic current regulator would be needed. At the same 
time, the introduction of such a drive might significantly improve the per-
formance of the vehicle’s electrical system.
At present, the switch from internal combustion engines to electric 
drives is beginning. This transition will rely on developments on power 
electronics, but primarily depends on the identification of efficient power 
sources and stores. Fuel cells are possible candidates. At the same time, the 
development of hybrid engines, which combine an internal combustion 
engine with an electric motor, is well advanced. Hybrid drives effectively 
address issues of energy conservation and environmental protection.
10.3.3.4  Marine power systems
Electrical systems on ships are characterized by considerable power 
consumption (as much as tens of megawatts). They also operate autono-
mously, and power of different quality is required for different subsys-
tems. Shipboard systems use ac and/or dc power. The development of 
power electronics has permitted the introduction of thyristor rectifiers, 

446
Power electronics basics
whose output voltage is regulated by adjusting the angle at which the 
thyristors are switched on.
As a rule, the basic power sources on ships supply the propeller drive 
and associated systems. In addition, many systems receive power from 
individual diesel–electric generators, which ensure reliable operation of 
key components. The electrical systems employed are mainly determined 
by the type of the propeller drive. Figure 10.22a shows a typical power 
supply system when the propeller drive is based on a dc motor. In this sys-
tem, the ac generator is part of a diesel–electric unit. Usually, ac frequency 
of industrial frequency is employed. The ac voltage is sent to thyristor rec-
tifiers, which provide power to the electrical propeller motors. The motor 
speed is regulated by adjusting the control angle of the thyristor rectifiers.
Frequency converters are used where high-quality power is required. 
They uncouple the generator buses of the diesel–electric unit and the con-
sumer subsystems. For that purpose, ships are fitted with electromechani-
cal converters consisting of a motor and an industrial-frequency voltage 
generator mounted on a single shaft. As the reliability of power electronic 
systems increases, we may expect that such electromechanical converters 
will be replaced by static converters, with significant improvement in size 
and mass.
For ships with ac propeller motors, the power system illustrated in 
Figure 10.22b is used. In this system, industrial-frequency alternating 
current is converted into voltage of variable frequency, which is supplied 
to synchronous motors; the frequency converter employed may be based 
on thyristors with natural commutation if the speed of the electric drive 
is regulated so as to be less than that at 50 Hz. Progress in power elec-
tronics is permitting the creation of static converters based on completely

controllable switches, thereby ensuring satisfactory control of the drive’s 
energy characteristics.
Of course, certain subsystems will require power different from that 
provided at the common buses. In that case, semiconductor converters 
may be employed. At the same time, the expediency of centralized power 
supply from such converters must be verified in the design process. For 
example, we know that 400 Hz voltage is widely used at radar stations. 
This frequency is also used for land-based radar stations. For purposes 
of standardization, 50/400 Hz frequency converters were initially used 
to supply power to radar stations. However, their general introduction 
impaired the performance of the other electrical systems. Accordingly, the 
frequency converters are only used as local power sources for the radar 
stations. Accordingly, both 50 and 400 Hz voltage is available at radar sta-
tions today (Glebov, 1999).
10.3.3.5  Aircraft power systems
In aviation, continuous progress is required in the delivery of electric 
power to different airplane subsystems. Initially, power was required 
for ignition of the fuel mixture in the internal combustion engines. 
Subsequently, the use of power on airplanes significantly expanded. 
Today, practically, all critically important airplane subsystems depend on 
electric power; the power required varies from kilowatts to megawatts, 
depending on the type of airplane.
At first, dc systems were employed. With an increase in the power 
required and expansion of the necessary applications, designers switched 
to ac systems. The introduction of ac equipment was facilitated by the fol-
lowing developments:
•	 The using of brushless ac machines
•	 Galvanic isolation of the electrical circuits in different subsystems
•	 Simple voltage matching of the transformers
•	 The use of simple and reliable rectifiers to supply power to dc 
components
The development of hybrid electric–hydraulic drives is of great inter-
est. Hydraulic drives are fast and relatively light. In contrast, the operating 
costs of electric drives are low. These benefits may be combined if hydrau-
lic power is generally employed, but electrical systems are used to control 
individual devices.
On an airplane, the mass of the power supply system is critical. The 
mass may be significantly reduced by increasing the magnitude and fre-
quency of the voltage and by multiplexing of the electric circuits. High-
frequency voltage may be created by means of intermediate frequency 

448
Power electronics basics
converters. Multiplex systems are based on the transmission of low-power 
control signals in the coded form within a single channel.
The adoption of these principles relies on electronic information sys-
tems and power electronics. In particular, microprocessor systems permit 
rapid processing of vast quantities of information, and high-speed elec-
tronic switches are characterized by low energy consumption and are able 
to handle large voltages and currents.
Systems with a high-speed ac or dc generator mounted on a turbine 
shaft can be widely introduced. Such generators, in the range 200–300 V, 
provide the basic power source for the aircraft. In the case of an ac gen-
erator, its voltage is rectified and/or sent to a frequency converter so as to 
obtain the voltage of stable frequency with variation in the turbine speed 
(Figure 10.23). To this end, directly coupled frequency converters may be 
used if the generator frequency considerably exceeds the converter’s out-
put frequency. The output voltage of the rectifiers and the ac voltage of 
stable frequency may be sent to the consumers directly or by way of vari-
ous converters if adjustment of the voltage is required. For example, an ac 
voltage of 270 V can be converted to 28 V or to dc voltage for drive control.

10.3.3.6  Rocket power supply
The performance of rockets largely depends on their power supply, which 
may take various forms. For example, in astronautical rockets, all the 
electrical systems of the spacecraft must be maintained. Different power 
sources will be employed on the ground and in motion.
Depending on the power of the electrical systems on the spacecraft 
and the period for which their operation must be ensured, different 
onboard energy sources can be employed (Glebov, 1999).
•	 Batteries and solar cells
•	 Electrochemical generators
•	 Isotope sources
The use of these sources requires conversion and regulation of the 
power produced. As practically all such sources generate dc power, dc 
converters are widely used on spacecraft. Pulsed converters with a high 
working frequency (>20 kHz) are used so as to reduce the mass of the 
input and output passive filters and transformers. To match the voltage 
of the individual subsystems and obtain ac power, high-frequency invert-
ers and inverters with an output voltage of the required frequency are 
employed.
Before and during rocket launching, ground-based power sources 
are important. They provide high-quality power for all the rocket’s 
subsystems prior to the launch and then hand off to onboard sources. 
The ground-based sources are mainly based on rectifiers with output 
parameters corresponding to the onboard system in static and dynamic 
operation. The primary ground-based sources include industrial grids, 
diesel–electric generators, and dc sources. Depending on the specific cir-
cumstances, dc or ac sources producing power of different qualities may 
be most appropriate. The key consideration is the maintenance of power 
in the spacecraft until it is launched.
10.3.4  Engineering requirements
10.3.4.1  Basic requirements for power electronic devices
The basic requirements on power electronic components may be divided 
into two groups:
•	 Electrical requirements
•	 Design requirements
Electrical requirements. The electrical requirements are determined 
by the type of power conversion and the characteristics of the primary 

450
Power electronics basics
power source and the load. Correspondingly, different requirements are 
imposed on the input and output parameters of the converter.
In the case of an ac source, attention focusses not only on the rated 
voltage and current, the number of phases, and the frequency but also 
on the quality of the power, including its static and dynamic stability, the 
distortion (nonsinusoidal waveform) of the voltage, and the duration and 
periodicity of dynamic fluctuations. If the power of the primary source is 
comparable with that of the converter, the requirements on the harmonic 
composition of the converter input current, the power factor (for the fun-
damental voltage and current components), and the cyclic operation of 
the converter must be noted. Besides the requirements on the harmonic 
composition of the converter’s input current, requirements are imposed 
on the distortion of the source voltage. However, the internal impedance 
of the source must be noted here, or else characteristics (say, frequency 
characteristics) permitting the identification of an equivalent electrical 
component for the primary source (with allowance for the built-in regula-
tor) must be presented. The influence of the nonsinusoidal converter cur-
rent on the source voltage may be assessed by means of the corresponding 
mathematical model of the source, taking account of its output param-
eters. Note that, with long leads between the source and the converter, 
their impedance must be noted. In some cases, for example, when higher 
current harmonics are present, the distributed inductance and capaci-
tance of the cables must be noted. Neglecting those parameters may lead 
to undesirable high-frequency resonance, with greater distortion of the 
source voltage and may also produce additional voltage surges and dips 
in dynamic converter operation.
For converters connected to a dc source, its rated voltage, its static and 
dynamic instability, and also the duration and periodicity of dynamic 
fluctuations must be noted. The magnitude and frequency of the voltage 
ripple are also important. When the power of the source is comparable 
with that of the converter, the dynamic values of the sources internal 
impedance (with allowance for the built-in regulator and the bidirectional 
conduction) must be noted. On that basis, the influence of pulsation of the 
converter’s input current on the source voltage and its surges and dips 
with switching of the converter current (in particular, when the load is 
applied and removed) may be assessed.
For converters that serve as secondary power sources, the require-
ments on the output parameters are analogous to those on the input 
parameters. The only difference is that the input parameters must be 
regarded as initial data, largely unaffected by the converter, whereas the 
output parameters are determined by the converter design. In this respect, 
the converter has a dual nature when it acts as a secondary power source: 
for the primary source, it is the load; for the consumers, it is the source of 
power of specific type and quality.

451
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
As a rule, the development of converters as power sources is associ-
ated with requirements on the range within which the output parameters 
are controlled. As the relevant standards mandate the required values of 
the output parameters, regulation allows the specific characteristics of the 
consumers to be taken into account, as well as the voltage drop in the 
cables.
For converters supplying power to key systems, the limiting per-
missible deviation of the output parameters from the standard values is 
usually noted, in all operating conditions, including emergencies. These 
requirements provide the basis for the development of the converter inter-
nal safety system.
In some cases, for example, when using the converter in special power 
supply systems, requirements may be imposed on the time required for 
the converter to accept a load after receiving the command that switches 
it on. When using converters in UPSs, a requirement is imposed on the 
duration of the interruption in the power supply at its output buses in 
all conditions, including malfunctioning of the converter (which must be 
backed up).
In formulating the requirements on the electrical parameters, the sensi-
tivity of semiconductor devices to instantaneous currents and voltages at the 
limits of the permitted range must be taken into account. Therefore, increas-
ing the stipulations regarding even brief permissible overloads or voltage 
surges will entail an increase in the number of semiconductor devices or 
switching to more powerful devices (i.e., those designed for greater current 
and voltage). In some cases, for example, for thyristor inverters with capaci-
tive commutation, the rated power of the switching components must be 
increased in light of possible overloads. Hence, the rated power of the con-
verter must be inflated in order to withstand even brief overloads.
Design requirements. The design requirements on power electronic 
components are predominantly determined by the operating conditions. 
They will also be different for an autonomous converter and a converter 
that is part of an electrical system with specific information and control 
panels.
Modular design of power electronic components is most common. 
Therefore, one of the basic design requirements is that the components of 
the device should be interchangeable.
The design is usually developed on the basis of requirements regard-
ing its mechanical stability. All the possible types of mechanical distur-
bances (one-time jolts, vibration, etc.) in operation and transportation are 
noted, along with their magnitudes.
The design must permit monitoring of the electrical parameters in the 
course of production and operation, by means of built-in and/or external 
systems. This stipulation is directly related to the requirements on repair 
and maintenance.

452
Power electronics basics
Sealing is required to permit operation in water or at elevated levels 
of humidity and also in the presence of aggressive agents. Containers may 
effectively be used for this purpose in converters of moderate power. The 
coatings on power electronic components must be corrosion-resistant and 
must also maintain an esthetic appearance. The same considerations apply 
to the storage conditions, which must also be noted in the design process.
The design must ensure safe operation, in accordance with the rel-
evant regulations. In particular, the design must ensure adequate ground-
ing of all metallic conductors that might be touched by operators or others. 
In turn, the grounding measures must ensure consistent transient imped-
ance. The impedance between the grounding elements and the accessible 
parts of the equipment should not exceed specified standard values.
The manufacturing conditions developed for the converter must take 
account of the comprehensive requirements in the plant standards (in 
relation to the installation of power components, printed circuits, etc.).
The components must be used in conditions specified by the corre-
sponding standards.
Numerous requirements are determined by the functions of the con-
verter in the electrical system. These requirements apply to the electrical 
connections between the converter and components such as the primary 
source, the power consumers, switchgear, control modules, and informa-
tion-display systems. The specific types of connectors, the type of control 
signals and information signals, and the requirements on the cables must 
be noted. For autonomous converters with operator control, the require-
ments on the monitoring and signaling systems must be specified, in light 
of standardized metrological requirements.
Ergonomic and esthetic considerations will also be incorporated in 
the design.
10.3.4.2  Electromagnetic compatibility
Most semiconductor converters rely on periodic switching of nonlinear 
elements (relays), which results in abrupt current and voltage change in 
the converters. As a result, electromagnetic radiation is generated over 
a broad frequency spectrum. These effects are especially pronounced in 
converters, in which electrical switching often occurs at high frequencies. 
The electromagnetic radiation produced may interfere with the normal 
functioning of nearby equipment. Such electromagnetic interference may 
also disrupt the functioning of the converters. In addition, we need to dis-
tinguish between the action of electromagnetic radiation at high frequen-
cies and the distortion of grid current by converters. The distortion of the 
grid current is assessed in terms of the ratio between the higher harmon-
ics (including the 40th harmonic) and the grid’s fundamental component. 
Current and voltage distortion impairs the quality of electrical energy and 
is regulated, for example, by the IEEE 519 standard.

453
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
We must distinguish between the conductive interference supplied 
to the grid and the inductive interference transmitted to the surround-
ings by the electromagnetic field. Conductive interference, including that 
produced by a radiofrequency electromagnetic field (in the range from 
150 kHz to 80 MHz), is measured at frequencies from 3 kHz to 80 MHz. 
Inductive electromagnetic interference is regulated in the range from 
30 to 1000 MHz. The permissible level of the interference is specified in 
numerous national and international standards in relation to the electro-
magnetic compatibility required for different components.
Note that electromagnetic interference affects not only engineering 
systems, but also human beings. Limiting levels of electromagnetic inter-
ference in the range from 30 kHz to 300 GHz are established in public-
health standards and regulations.
Attention must be paid to electromagnetic compatibility at most 
stages of the design process. Besides the introduction of devices to sup-
press electromagnetic interference, the electromagnetic compatibility of a 
converter will depend on its design, the electrical installation of its indi-
vidual components, the filtration employed, and the screening of individ-
ual components. These issues are complex and demand careful attention.
The designer primary tasks are to distinguish between the electri-
cal circuits in terms of the functions of the components, to minimize the 
length of the cable required, and to separate the circuits most sensitive 
to interference from sources of interference by high-frequency filters. In 
any case, the wiring should not be haphazard and should not be focussed 
exclusively on reducing production costs. Even in computerized design, 
the outcome must be scrutinized so as to identify pathways in which 
interference may penetrate.
In power electronic systems, the following wiring rules must be 
observed.
•	 Separation of power circuits from control circuits
•	 Perpendicularity of the control-system and power-system cables
•	 Minimum cable length (within the design constraints)
•	 The combination of three-phase ac circuits and dc circuits in indi-
vidual pathways with minimum distance between the individual 
leads
For safety purposes, many components must be connected to a 
grounding line. However, the use of a common line for different compo-
nents is undesirable. Note that the grounding line may create resistance 
to high-frequency interference. As a result, voltage at the frequency of the 
electromagnetic interference may arise at such resistance, with an unde-
sirable impact on devices that are sensitive to interference. Accordingly, it 
is expedient to create individual short buses parallel to the grounding line. 

454
Power electronics basics
Where necessary, point grinding of individual devices may be employed. 
Note that the length of the line between each device and the common 
point must be minimized.
In addition to these basic wiring rules, various specific methods are 
employed for components with particular functions. In particular, leads 
in a twisted-pair configuration are used to transmit signals from the sen-
sors to the amplifiers of the regulators, the measuring devices, and other 
highly sensitive components. Transposition of the wires minimizes their 
induction and compensates the currents induced by interference sources.
Electrostatic, magnetostatic, and electromagnetic screens can be used 
to protect the leads and components from external electromagnetic fields.
Electrostatic screens are usually made of copper or aluminum foil 
and surround the interference source. The metallic casing of the screen 
encloses the wire’s electric field, limiting its propagation into the sur-
roundings. However, the effectiveness of the screen depends significantly 
on the screen’s quality and grounding. Magnetostatic screens are made of 
magnetic materials and reduce the external magnetic field. However, on 
account of eddy currents, their effectiveness in converters is limited. High-
frequency fields may be shielded by means of electromagnetic screens, 
which reflect the electromagnetic energy. However, magnetostatic and 
electromagnetic screens are rarely used in converters, on account of their 
structural complication and the additional active-power losses. The use of 
such screens may be expedient, for example, in separating magnetic ele-
ments and microcircuits.
Electric filters are mainly used to suppress interference in convert-
ers. Filters differ in structure, circuit design, and electrical components. 
In moderate-power converters, L-type filters with pass-through capaci-
tors are most common. The output (input) buses of the converter usu-
ally provide the series impedance required for interference suppression; 
where their inductance is insufficient for this purpose, a series choke 
is added. It is expedient to surround the filter by a grounded screen. 
Different types of capacitors may differ in their effectiveness as filters for 
the suppression of interference at various frequencies. Therefore, it may 
make sense to employ capacitors of different types in radiofrequency 
interference filters. Note that radiofrequency filters must be included in 
converter circuits in the initial stages of the design process. However, 
their parameters are generally refined experimentally, on account of the 
innumerable factors that affect the radio interference, such as the wiring 
configuration, the layout of the functional components, and the ground-
ing system.
10.3.4.3  Certification of power electronic devices
The main requirements on power electronic components are outlined 
in numerous standards. The process of verifying compliance with those 

455
Chapter ten:  Applications of power electronics
standards is known as certification. Certification permits monitoring of 
product quality, performance, and safety. Therefore, it is an important 
safeguard of global competitiveness.
Standardization involves certification of products and the quality of 
their manufacture. At completion, a certificate of compliance is issued for 
the product or the factory quality-control system.
The International Organization for Standardization maintains satis-
factory methodological practices worldwide. For its part, the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) operates the most developed certifica-
tion system for electrical and electronic equipment. National certification 
systems can be more stringent than the international standards. In Russia, 
Gosstandart coordinates certification efforts and oversees a network of 
accredited certification centers and test laboratories that are empowered to 
verify product quality and manufacturing practices in relation to national 
and international standards.
In order to eliminate administrative and technical barriers to trade 
and to improve product safety, Russia has introduced a law on engineer-
ing regulation, which outlines the fundamental principles of certification. 
It lays out technical regulations to improve safety and environmental pro-
duction. Mandatory and voluntary product certification has been estab-
lished in accordance with those regulations. Power electronic components 
are often used in applications in which increased safety is required. In 
such cases, the products must comply with the technical regulations. The 
categories of products subject to mandatory and voluntary certification 
have been determined. In any case, the declared product characteristics 
must conform to the relevant standards.
As an example, we now briefly consider the requirements on UPSs. 
Such systems contain rectifiers, inverters, semiconductor regulators, and 
switches. Therefore, the requirements on UPSs are typical of many power 
electronic components.
The IEC 62040 standard on UPS consists of three sections. The first 
contains the basic principles and specifies the electrical and mechani-
cal characteristics of UPSs and their components. The overall test con-
ditions are outlined, along with the basic requirements on the structure 
and the interface. Requirements on the mechanical strength and electrical 
strength are considered. The first part consists of two main sections 62040-
1.1 and 62040-1.2 for UPS with different operator access. In appendices to 
the first section, standards regarding test procedures, the types of loads, 
and ventilation of battery segments are stated, along with recommenda-
tions for battery disconnection in transportation.
In the second part 62040-2, the requirements on electromagnetic com-
patibility are outlined. Measurement conditions are specified. The basic 
interference stability requirements are formulated. Permissible levels of 
electromagnetic interference are stated for different frequency ranges.

456
Power electronics basics
The third part 62040-3 outlines in detail the technical specifications 
on UPSs and the corresponding test procedures. Basic information is pro-
vided regarding their input and output characteristics. Typical structures 
and operating conditions for UPSs are presented. Procedures are specified 
for static and dynamic testing of UPSs with different grid and load con-
ditions. Methods of testing safety and warning circuits are considered. 
Appendices outline typical faults and types of load.
This brief review of the standard for UPSs illustrates that current 
standards cover practically all aspects of the functioning and perfor-
mance of devices, including conditions of transportation and storage. 
Extremely extensive testing is required to verify compliance of the UPS 
characteristics with every aspect of the standard. Therefore, manu-
facturers must reach an agreement with the customer regarding the 
tests that will be required, in light of the manufacturing and operating 
conditions. The first priority is safety testing and verification that the 
requirements in the product technical specifications match the standard 
requirements.
