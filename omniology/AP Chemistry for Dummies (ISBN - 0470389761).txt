About the Authors
Peter Mikulecky grew up in Milwaukee, an area of Wisconsin unique for its high human-to-
cow ratio. After a breezy four-year tour in the Army, Peter earned a bachelor of science
degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire,
and a PhD in biological chemistry from Indiana University. With science seething in his DNA,
he sought to infect others with a sense of molecular wonderment. Having taught, tutored,
and mentored in classroom and laboratory environments, Peter was happy to find a home
at Fusion Learning Center and Fusion Academy. There, he enjoys convincing students that
biology and chemistry are, in fact, fascinating journeys, not entirely designed to inflict pain
on hapless teenagers. His military training occasionally aids him in this effort. He is the
author of AP Biology For Dummies and Chemistry Workbook For Dummies.
Michelle Rose Gilman is most proud to be known as Noah’s mom. A graduate of the University
of South Florida, Michelle found her niche early, and at 19, she was working with emotionally
disturbed and learning-disabled students in hospital settings. At 21, she made the trek to
California, where she found her passion for helping teenagers become more successful in
school and life. What started as a small tutoring business in the garage of her California home
quickly expanded and grew to the point where traffic control was necessary on her residential
street.
Today, Michelle is the founder and CEO of Fusion Learning Center and Fusion Academy, a
private school and tutoring/test prep facility in Solana Beach, California, serving more than
2,000 students per year. She is the author of ACT For Dummies, Pre-Calculus For Dummies,
AP Biology For Dummies, Chemistry Workbook For Dummies, GRE For Dummies, Pre-Calculus
Workbook for Dummies, and other books on self-esteem, writing, and motivational topics.
Michelle has overseen dozens of programs over the last 20 years, focusing on helping kids
become healthy adults. She currently specializes in motivating the unmotivatable adoles-
cent, comforting their shell-shocked parents, and assisting her staff of 35 teachers.
Michelle lives by the following motto: There are people content with longing; I am not one
of them.
Kate Brutlag has been a full-fledged science dork since she picked up her first book on
dinosaurs as a child. A native of Minnesota, Kate enjoys typical regional activities such as
snow sports and cheese eating. Kate left Minnesota as a teen to study at Middlebury College
in Vermont and graduated with a double major in physics and Japanese. Seeking to unite
these two highly unrelated passions, she spent a year in Kyoto, Japan, on a Fulbright scholar-
ship researching Japanese constellation lore. Kate was quickly drawn back to the pure sci-
ences, however, and she discovered her love for education through her work at Fusion
Academy, where she currently teaches upper-level sciences and Japanese. She is the author
of Chemistry Workbook for Dummies.

AP Chemistry For Dummies 

Introduction
O
ne of the central lessons of chemistry is that the starting and ending points of a reac-
tion don’t have much to do with the business in between. Your journey through AP
chemistry is much the same. In the beginning, you decided to take AP chemistry. In the
end, you’ll take the AP chemistry exam. These moments are fixed points on the horizon
behind you and the horizon in front of you. Time will move you from one point to the other.
What you make of the intervening landscape is mostly up to you.
But along the way, we’d like to help. 
About This Book
The College Board is very clear about the chemistry concepts and problems it wants you to
master. The clear guidelines provided by the College Board lie at the heart of this book. We
emphasize what the Board emphasizes, and we suspect that those are the very things that
you’d like to emphasize as you prepare for the exam.
Chemistry is the practical science, which is one reason why a practical attitude permeates
this book. We also realize that you’re not simply reading this book — you’re using it for a spe-
cific purpose. Your simple, clear goal: to ace the AP Chemistry exam. You want your grasp of
chemistry to be just as clear as your goal for the AP exam. This book is here to support your
quest for chemistry clarity; think of it as window cleaner for your brain. (Window cleaner is
largely an aqueous solution of ammonia, by the way.) 
The structure of this book largely follows the sequence you might follow in an AP chemistry
course, so it lends itself to use as companion text as you go through the course. On the other
hand, we have written the book to be quite modular, so you can pick and choose the chapters
that interest you in any sequence. Cross-references are provided in any instances where there
is must-know information discussed in another chapter. You don’t have to read this thing
cover to cover. 
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, you can read anything you want to, up to and including the publishing legalese on
the opening page. But there are certain bits of the book that are less vital than others, and we
alert you to them so you can make efficient decisions about how to spend your reading time.
Any text highlighted by the technical stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this
Introduction) is, well, really technical. Now, in a book about chemistry, there’s bound to be
an abundance of technical material. But information accompanied by this icon is stuff that
you won’t need for the AP exam — though it certainly won’t hurt you to know it!
In addition, any material placed within a sidebar is something of an “aside,” items that are
relevant and which you may find interesting or helpful, but definitely not required reading.
These are items you might peruse as you sip tea and take a short break from hard-core study.

Foolish Assumptions
You’re unique, and so is everyone else who uses this book. But to make it the most useful
book possible, we’ve made some assumptions about you. And you should know what those
assumptions are. We assume that
 You have a basic facility with algebra and arithmetic. You should know how to solve
simple equations for an unknown variable, including the occasional quadratic equa-
tion. You should know how to work with exponents and logarithms. That’s about it for
the math. At no point will we ask you to, say, consider the contradictions between the
Schrödinger equation and stochastic wavefunction collapse.
 You have access to a college-level textbook in chemistry, such as the one you use in
your AP chemistry course. If you’re not enrolled in an AP hemistry course or for some
other reason don’t have a good textbook, you can still benefit from this book. Every set
of practice problems in this book is preceded by a chapter that gives a concise but
thorough review of the topic at hand.
 You don’t like to waste time. Neither do we. Chemists in general aren’t too fond of
time-wasting. That said, let’s move straightaway to the organization of the book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into eight thematic parts. Some of the shorter parts serve very specific
functions, such as familiarizing you with the AP exam and providing study tips, or giving you
the opportunity to take full-length, model AP chemistry exams. The larger parts at the heart
of the book are a comprehensive review of the material chosen by the College Board for
emphasis in AP chemistry courses and for inclusion on AP chemistry exams. Chapters that
extensively review chemistry content alternate with chapters that present pithy summaries
of the most important points and test you against an arsenal of practice questions.
Part I: Thriving Inside the Test Tube: 
How to Prepare for the Exam
Like any big standardized exam, the AP chemistry exam tests more than chemistry — it tests
your ability to take a test. In addition to knowing your chemistry cold, on test day you’ll want
the confidence that comes from knowing exactly what’s coming. This part demystifies the
exam, the exam-taking process, and the scoring process. In addition, it gives sage advice
about how to tackle the long-term challenge of preparing for the exam without incurring per-
manent mental and emotional damage along the way. 
Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up:
Atoms and Bonding
Chemistry is about building things with atoms and then breaking the things you built. Then,
you build new things with the same building blocks as before. This part introduces you to
the building blocks (atoms) and reviews the basic rules of construction (bonding). A surpris-
ingly small number of guidelines give rise to an impressive array of molecular shapes, and we
show you how. 
2
AP Chemistry For Dummies 

Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States
In addition to ridiculously tiny things like atoms and bonds, chemistry is about bigger, easier-
to-notice things, like whether something is a liquid or not. But explaining why something is a
liquid and why it turns to a solid or a gas requires you to squint once more at the tiny parti-
cles that compose that something. This part explains the “big” properties of matter (its state,
temperature, pressure, volume) in terms of the behavior of the “little” particles that make up
the matter.
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions
Like any venerable and worthy science, chemistry extracts simplicity from an intimidating
mountain of complexity. To do so, chemistry uses two basic tricks. First, chemistry keeps
careful tabs on matter. By keeping a close count of each atom, ion, or electron involved in a
reaction, it becomes possible to place any of a million chemical reactions into one of a few
basic categories. Although they wear different clothes, there are really only a few kinds of
reactions. In addition to accounting for all its material bits, chemistry uses a second trick to
make sense of things: it keeps track of energy. By paying attention to different forms and
amounts of energy, chemistry can predict whether or not reactions will go forward or back-
ward and even calculate the rate at which they’ll get to where they’re going. This part delves
into chemistry’s two tricks: following the matter and following the energy. 
Part V: Describing Patterns and 
Predicting Properties
Sometimes you can tell a lot about the molecular details of a reaction by observing some
obvious things with your naked eyes. What color is the sample? Did a solid appear as if from
nowhere from within a liquid? Is some sort of gas bubbling out of the beaker? Connecting
observations like these to the details of a reaction is the task of descriptive chemistry, the
heart of Part V. Connecting properties to structures is also a major focus of organic chem-
istry, a topic we also cover succinctly in this part. 
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs
Labwork is a major portion of the AP chemistry experience, and the College Board includes “lab
knowledge” questions on the AP chemistry exam. You should know your way around a general
chemistry lab, including how to select the right piece of glassware or equipment for a particular
task. We cover lab equipment, common lab tasks, and safety practices in this part. Then, we
give you an overview of each of the 22 labs officially recommended by the College Board,
emphasizing the key concepts and data analyses with which you need to be familiar.
Part VII: Measuring Yields: Practice Tests
There’s no substitute for experience. The best way to assess your readiness for the AP chem-
istry exam is to take an AP chemistry exam. Taking a full-length, timed exam is also a great
way to train your brain for the test-taking rhythms you’ll experience on test day. Because
taking practice tests is such a good idea, we’ve put two of them in this part. And because it’s
just possible that you don’t know every answer, we’ve included complete answers with expla-
nations for all the answers.

Introduction

Part VIII: The Part of Tens
It would be nice if life came with a package: “Little Lists of Helpful Reminders.” This part of
your life does come with such lists. This part combs through the entire book, pulling
together top-ten lists to help you review the most important ideas and equations.
Icons Used in This Book
Nicely nestled along the margins of this workbook you’ll find a selection of helpful icons.
Think of them as landmarks, familiar signposts to guide you as you cruise the highways of
chemistry. 
Within already-concise summaries of chemical concepts, passages marked by this icon repre-
sent the choicest, must-know bits of information. You will need to know this stuff in order to
solve problems. 
Sometimes there’s an easy way and a hard way. This icon alerts you to passages intended to
highlight an easier way. It’s worth your while to linger for a moment. You may find yourself
nodding quietly as you jot down a grateful note or two.
This icon gives you technical info that you don’t have to know to understand the rest of the
section, but we sure think it’s interesting to read about!
This icon is just what it says. It flags the kind of information that you ignore at your own
peril. If we could make it our own peril, we would. But we can’t, so we use this icon. 
Where to Go from Here
This book can help you in different ways, depending on your position along the AP chemistry
path. If you have yet to enter the AP chemistry classroom, you can use the book to smooth
your rough edges and build confidence so that when the course hits you, you’re ready.
If you’re just beginning the AP chemistry course, then smile. You’ve just discovered a lovely
traveling companion. Use the book to supplement your schoolwork and as a way to get extra
help and practice with weak spots. And be sure to take advantage of the full-length practice
exams to help prepare yourself as test day approaches.
If you’re nearing the middle or the end of the course, then use the book as first aid, shoring
up your understanding of those areas you already know give you trouble. In parallel, use the
book as a helpful secondary source for the remaining part of the course.
Finally, if you’re not actually taking the AP course but could use some help with a general
chemistry course you’re taking in college, you’ll probably find this book a helpful, friendly,
and lightweight addition to your backpack.

Part I
Thriving Inside the
Test Tube: How to
Prepare for the Exam

In this part . . .
T
he AP Chemistry exam is mostly about chemistry,
but it’s also about exams. Knowing the ins and outs of
the exam itself is just plain good sense, and is part of your
training for exam day. By knowing the structure and idio-
syncrasies of the test, you turn them to your advantage.
This part deconstructs the test to let you see it for its
parts. In addition, we offer you tips on how to pace your-
self for the long-term project of preparing to show the AP
Chemistry who’s boss. (By the way, you’re the boss.)

Chapter 1
Knowing What You’re Up Against:
The AP Chemistry Exam
In This Chapter
 Making sure the exam is right for you
 Breaking down the exam into all its parts
 Ticking through the topics covered on the exam
 Acing the questions
 Understanding your score
Just the words “Advanced Placement” can bring about trembling fits of fear in even
the best of Chemistry students. The good ’ol folks at the Educational Testing Service
(ETS) — the company hired by the College Board to write and grade the AP exams — have
been disseminating this fear for over 50 years, and they’ve had the time to get quite good
at it. Consider this chapter your best bet at releasing your fear, getting some early college
credit, and planning what to do with all the free time you’ll have in college by not having to
take an intro chemistry course. 
As you get intimate with the AP test, you will become familiar with why you should (or
shouldn’t) take this test, the test’s structure, how you will be scored, and how to plan your
time effectively. In this chapter we uncover the often-overlooked strategies for taking the
exam itself. 
You already know a whole bunch about chemistry. After all, you’ve probably spent the best
part of this year listening eagerly to your high school chemistry teacher (in between texting
your friend and downloading the latest Modest Mouse tune). Of course, nothing takes the
place of full comprehension of the material, but knowing chemistry is only part of the puzzle
(albeit a really big part). We can show you some other things that you can do to help raise
your score that have little to do with chemistry. So sit back, relax, and let us show you
the way.
Seeing If You Have the Right Stuff
Taking the AP exam sends out a beacon to the folks at any college that you believe you can
think and perform on the college level, but can you? Although taking an AP chemistry course
is not a prerequisite to taking the AP chemistry exam, we highly recommend that you do.
Plus, you must be honest with yourself. If you received poor grades in chemistry in high
school and could care less about stoichiometry, or if you accidentally blew up your high
school chem lab by combining various chemicals, you might want to consider spending your
time in an area you truly enjoy (perhaps a money-making vocation where you can pay for
that lab to be rebuilt).

However, check out what your high score on the AP exam (see “Getting the Skinny on the
Scoring,” later in this chapter) can get you:
 You prove to the college that you understand advanced material and already possess
what it takes to be successful in college. Well, go you!
 You have the opportunity to receive credit or advanced standings at most universities
around the country. In plain English, this means you can sleep in a bit, because you
won’t have to take an intro chemistry class in college because you already proved that
you know this stuff! Even better, if you aren’t planning on studying science in college,
you probably won’t ever have to take another science class again! Yippee! 
Those smart AP creators have AP tests in a variety of different subjects, so if you’re not sure
about your dedication to this particular test, you might want to visit their Web site and
glance at the other subjects they offer. If you’re just taking the AP chemistry class and don’t
plan on taking the exam at the end, then that’s cool too. Skip this chapter and use the rest of
the book for succeeding in the AP chemistry class. 
Knowing the Breakdown — 
So You Don’t Have One!
Considering that the AP folks don’t provide anti-anxiety salt licks as you walk into the exam,
knowing the breakdown of the exam ahead of time prepares you for what you’re up against
and makes you more confident so that you’re better relaxed to take the exam. 
The AP Chemistry exam takes three hours and includes two sections; a 90-minute, 75-question,
multiple-choice section and a 95-minute, 6-question, free-response section. We explain these
sections further in the sections that follow.
Making your way through multiple-choice
questions: Section 1
You can’t use a calculator on the multiple-choice section. With the recent capabilities of
graphing calculators, it could probably take the test for you! The AP higher-ups figured this
one out a long time ago. 
You have to answer (or try to answer) 75 questions on the multiple-choice section. Each
question has five possible answer choices. We have a feeling that the AP creators couldn’t
agree on what to put on the exam, so they just tossed everything into it. The questions you
will encounter cover a large amount of material. Not all students will be exposed to all the
material that the test may cover, so don’t be surprised to see topics that may be unfamiliar
to you. You can expect basic factual questions as well as heavy-duty, thought-provoking
problems, including 10 to 12 math problems to be done without a calculator. This section is
worth 50 percent of your score. 
You will only have about 1.2 minutes to answer each question. If you don’t know the immedi-
ate answer, skip the problem and move on. 
8
Part I: Thriving Inside the Test Tube: How to Prepare for the Exam 

Taking on free-response questions: Section 2
The second section of the exam consists of free-response questions. You will find a total of
six questions:
 Three quantitative problems (one on chemical equilibrium) lasting 55 minutes.
 One of the questions will be on chemical reactions, which will require you to write
balanced net equations for chemical reactions.
 Reaction question and two essay questions lasting 40 minutes.
 One of the six questions will be a laboratory-based question that could be located in
either the quantitative section or the essay section, so pay close attention when we
cover labs throughout this book because the lab question could be on anything.
The free-response questions are long, make no bones about it. They will require you to
demonstrate your problem-solving skills, show knowledge of chemical reactions, and ques-
tion your ability to reason and explain ideas logically and clearly. They are broken down into
multiple parts. Basically, the test will ask you multiple questions about the concept and
require you to show concept mastery. 
You won’t be given an incomprehensible topic for any of the free-response questions. You
will be asked to solve a fairly basic chemistry concept, but they will want you to go into
detail and ask you several different questions about it. There will be formulas to use and
numbers to work with. Although the free-response questions are long and daunting, they’re
not there to trick you. The multiple parts often help to lead you to the right way to tackle the
problem. The AP people want to see your true chemistry acumen, and this is the best way to
assess that. We will discuss how to tackle free-response problems later in this chapter. 
You can use certain tools during this portion of the test. The following list shows you what
you can bring in and what the AP folks provide, as well as the restrictions on these tools:
 Calculators: You can use your calculator for the first 55 minutes of the free-response
section, but you can’t share your calculator with another student. The AP folks also
restrict which calculators you can use on the AP test. Because technology changes so
rapidly, you should check the College Board Web site (www.collegeboard.com) for an
up-to-the-minute list of acceptable calculators. 
 Tables containing commonly used equations: You can use these tables only during
the free-response section. You can’t use them on the multiple-choice section. The free-
response section requires you to solve in-depth problems and to write essays where
the knowledge of the concepts and how to apply the principles are the most important
parts of solving the problem. The College Board gives everybody the table of equations
to make it fair for the students who may not have the equations stored in their calcula-
tors. The AP folks have some heart, after all! But remember, because the test gives you
the equations, you will receive no credit for answers simply written down in equation
form without supported explanations or some type of logical development. 
Tackling the Topics Covered
Before the AP exam was written, a few geeky chemists studied the chemistry curricula of
many of the nation’s best colleges. They combined their reports and came away with a clear
idea of the stuff being taught to chemistry college students around the country. The end
result culminated in the AP chemistry exam covering five key areas, and because we’re
9
Chapter 1: Knowing What You’re Up Against: The AP Chemistry Exam

obsessive about making sure you’re the most informed you can be (and because we’re con-
trol freaks), we’ve outlined each area for you below:
 Structure of matter (20 percent of test; see Chapters 3 through 8):
• Atomic theory and atomic structure: Evidence for the atomic theory; atomic
masses; atomic number and mass numbers; electron energy levels; periodic
relationships
• Chemical bonding: Binding forces; molecular models, geometry of molecules
and ions, structural isomerism of simple organic molecules and coordination
complexes
• Nuclear chemistry: nuclear equations, half-lives and radioactivity
 States of matter (20 percent of test; see Chapters 9 through 12): 
• Gases: Laws of ideal gases; kinetic molecular theory
• Liquids and solids: Liquids and solids from the kinetic-molecular viewpoint;
phase diagrams of one component systems; changes of state, including critical
points and triple points; structure of solids
• Solutions: Types of solutions and factors affecting solubility; methods of express-
ing concentration; Raoult’s law and colligative properties; nonideal behavior
 Reactions (35 to 40 percent of test; see Chapters 13 through 22):
• Reaction types: Acid-base reactions; precipitation reactions; oxidation-reduction
reactions
• Stoichiometry: Ionic and molecular species present in chemical systems; balanc-
ing of equations including those for redox reactions; mass and volume relations
• Equilibrium: Concept of dynamic equilibrium, physical and chemical; quantita-
tive treatment
• Kinetics: Concept of rate of reaction; use of experimental data and graphical
analysis to determine reactant order, rate constants, and reaction rate laws; effect
of temperature change on rates; energy of activation; relationship between the
rate-determining step and a mechanism
• Thermodynamics: State functions; first law; second law; relationship of change in
free energy to equilibrium constants and electrode potentials
 Descriptive chemistry (10 to 15 percent of test; see Chapters 23 to 27): Relationships
in the periodic table (periodicity); chemical reactivity and products of chemical reac-
tions; introduction to organic chemistry
 Laboratory (5 to 10 percent of test; see Chapters 27 and 28): Making observations of
chemical reactions and substances; recording data; interpreting results; communicat-
ing the results
Understanding the AP Test Questions
The AP chemistry test offers no surprises. Every question covers one or more basic funda-
mental chemistry concept, tests you on your knowledge of the five areas described in the
section above, “Tackling the Topics Covered.” Following the basic guidelines in this section
helps you tackle the multiple-choice and free-response sections of the exam. 
10
Part I: Thriving Inside the Test Tube: How to Prepare for the Exam 

Making sense of multiple choice
Of the two parts of this test, the multiple-choice part is easiest because the correct answer is
staring you right in your face; you just need to find it. In the following sections, we describe
the different setups of multiple-choice questions, and we’ve also included a section that
shows you some educated-guessing techniques to help you whittle down the obvious wrong
answers. 
Clearing out the “crowded” questions
Basically, there are three types of multiple-choice questions. The first type of questions you
encounter we call “crowded together” questions. These are the easiest because they take
very limited time to complete. With crowded together questions, you get some information
upfront lettered A through E. After this information, you get two to three questions pertain-
ing to the initial A through E information. You just pick the correct letter choice to solve the
questions. 
Standing out from the crowd: Dealing with “loner” questions
Another type of question that makes up much of the multiple-choice questions we like to call
“loner questions.” Each loner question covers only one lonely topic at a time. You’re pre-
sented with a question providing you with the information you need to complete the prob-
lem, usually five possible choices, again lettered A through E. 
Putting a spin on interpretative questions
The interpretation questions do not occur very often, but they’re important to know about.
Basically, the interpretation questions take two somewhat related loner questions and stuff
them together and then ask you two or more questions about the information. You are given
a graph, diagram, or data table, and are then asked two questions about the presented visual.
Getting through the questions . . . with as many right answers as possible
The AP test creators throw everything at you at once, so don’t think that the test starts easy
and gets more difficult — it doesn’t. Manage your time on the text using these tips:
 Short questions: Answer the questions that are the shortest first, leaving more time for
you to put a little more time into the longer, more intense questions.
 Easy questions: Answer the questions that make you want to smile first (the concepts
you know the most about), and leave the questions that make you want to vomit for last. 
 Educated guessing: Educated guessing is a good thing. Eliminating even one possible
answer increases your choices of hitting the right one. You don’t get penalized for leav-
ing an answer blank, but you do get a fraction (1⁄4) removed from your score for a wrong
answer. On the other hand, guessing correctly earns you a full point. In other words,
completely random guessing neither hurts nor harms you. Educated guessing helps
you. If you don’t know how to solve the problem but want to make an educated guess,
keep these ideas in mind to make the best possible educated guess:
• Take a quick glance through the possible answers.
• The AP folks are not trying to trick you, so if something looks blatantly wrong, it
probably is. So you’re probably safe to eliminate it. 
• Eliminate the answers that don’t seem to match up to the question.
• Eliminate answers that appear too close to the actual question. 
11
Chapter 1: Knowing What You’re Up Against: The AP Chemistry Exam

Finagling the free-response questions
The free-response section takes 95 minutes and has six questions divided into two parts: 
 Part A: Part A takes 55 minutes, in which you answer three questions for which you’re
allowed to use your calculator. Part A covers one equilibrium problem and two other
problems. 
 Part B: Part B takes 40 minutes and covers the last three questions, one being a reac-
tions question and the other two being essay questions. A lab question is thrown in the
mix somewhere. Calculators are not permitted in Part B. 
Part A counts for 60 percent of your score in the free-response section with each question
counting 20 percent. Spending a little extra time in Part A is worth it. 
The test giveth . . .
Before you begin the free-response section, you are given a plethora of information:
 You will be bombarded with four, highly coveted pages of chemistry-related material,
consisting of a whole bunch of equations and constants covering atomic structure,
equilibrium, thermochemistry, liquids, gases, solutions, oxidation-reduction, and
electrochemistry. 
 You will also receive a limited periodic table and a reduction potential table. 
Right now, you might be thinking, “Cool, I’ll be getting all the info I need to solve the prob-
lems.” But, when you get to the test site and look at the questions, you’ll soon realize that the
good AP pros didn’t just give you only the info you need, but they also gave you a ton more
than you’ll ever use on the test. So, even though you have information to take from, you still
need to be chem smart to know when and where to use the info given to you. 
Breathing easy by knowing what to expect
On the free-response portion of the exam, you need to answer the questions in your own logi-
cal words and commit to your answers. The topics on the AP exam refer to general chem-
istry topics, so rest assured that the AP pros won’t toss some rarely taught concept your
way to see if they can throw you a curve ball and screw up your game. 
Most questions have multiple parts. You’ll first encounter some type of initial chemistry
information (it could be a figure, a graph or a concept) and then see questions labeled a, b, c,
and so on. Each of these subquestions requires you to write an answer of at least a sentence
and sometimes a paragraph or two or to give a multistep equation as your answer. 
You have approximately 18 minutes (three problems in 55 minutes) and 13 minutes (three
problems in 40 minutes) to complete each free-response problem.
Putting partial answers into practice
Don’t be stingy with your answers! Partial credit is given for saying at least something right in
the answer. You receive points for writing certain correct portions of the answer, so take
your time, write all you know, and do not rush. However, be sure what you write is relevant
to the question. No points are given for writing about chemistry in general when the subject
is sodium chloride.

Part I: Thriving Inside the Test Tube: How to Prepare for the Exam 

If you come across a problem that freaks you out, remind yourself that there must be some
part of the subquestion that you’re more familiar with. Read the entire problem before start-
ing it. Do not skip a problem simply because the vomit feeling is welling up inside of you.
Take a deep breath, scan for any part of the question that you might be able to write about,
and begin writing. You can still get a fairly high score even when you receive only partial
credit for certain subquestions. 
More tips directly from the source
The College Board is nice enough to offer some tips of its own. In the following list, we offer
you a condensed version of these tips to make your life easier:
 Show all your work: Partial credit is given for partial solutions. 
 If you do work that is incorrect, simply put an X through it: Don’t take the time
to erase. 
 Organize your answers clearly: If the scorers cannot follow your reasoning, they
might not give you credit. 
 You do not need to simplify, but if you’re asked to calculate, you must simplify all
numerical expressions or carry out all numerical calculations to get credit.
 Do not use what they call a “scattershot” approach: Avoid writing a whole bunch of
equations or nonsense, hoping that that one among them will be correct. 
Getting the Skinny on the Scoring
While you wait patiently to find out if you’re a genius, the secret scorers are busy at work
squinting their eyes, rubbing their chins, and contemplating your entire chemistry future.
You ultimately receive a score between 1 and 5. We know, after all the hard work you did, the
hours of studying, and the sweating at the exam, the highest score you can receive is a
measly 5! The nerve of those people! 
While those AP pros might not be the most creative bunch of folk, they did do a lot of
researching to figure out how to score you. They periodically compare the performance of
AP students with that of college students tested on the same material. It comes down to this: 
 A score of 5 on the AP test is comparable to a college student’s earning an A in his
college-level chemistry course. 
 A score of 4 equates to B in a college course, and so on. 
 A score of 3 or higher equates to a C in college and could still qualify you for college
credit. Anything less than a 3 won’t qualify you. 
But the College Board likes the word “qualified” so here’s how it puts it:
5 — Extremely well qualified
4 — Well qualified
3 — Qualified
2 — Possibly qualified
1 — No recommendation

Scoping out the scoring process
You might be wondering how they come up with the 1 to
5 score. If you weren’t wondering, well, we were, and
we figured while we’re at it that we might as well make
the information available to you.
The multiple-choice section is scored by a computer. The
answer sheets are scanned and the computer adds the
number of correct responses and subtracts a fraction for
each wrong answer. You don’t get penalized for answers
left blank, but you subtract a fraction from your score for
each wrong answer. Thus, make only educated guesses
(see the section, “ Getting through the questions . . . with
as many right answers as possible” for more on making
educated guesses.)
The free-response section is scored by real, live people
during the first half of June. Really, they’re living, breath-
ing people. Basically, major special college professors
and veteran super-duper AP teachers come together in
the summer and have an AP scoring party. They all
gather, distribute their pocket protectors, and get down
to the fun of reading your responses. 
The scores from the multiple-choice section and free-
response section are combined to give you a composite
score. 

Chapter 2
Preparing Yourself for the Exam
In This Chapter
 Packing the tools you need
 Following a study schedule
 Building your confidence
 Relieving stress
P
reparing yourself for the AP exam involves several things, and they are all equally
important. First you should familiarize yourself with AP test (in case you haven’t done
so already, check out Chapter 1). In this chapter, we take you a step further by explaining
what you need to take with you to the test as well as how to study and mentally prepare for
the test.
Taking Your Tools to the Test
Although you’re not packing to go to a remote island in Fiji (albeit, a great visualization skill
to use right before the test! See “Practicing visualization” at the end of this chapter), we do
want you to put the same amount of thought into what you need to bring and not bring to
the test site on test day. Pay special attention to the lists in the following sections. Being pre-
pared in advance will minimize your stress level and assure that you have what you need.
Packing what you need
It’s not advisable to ask the test proctor to wait 20 minutes while you run home to get your
forgotten calculator. You definitely need to be sure you have the permitted tools for the test
on test day. The night before the test try to pack the following list of items:
 Pencils with erasers (#2): used for the multiple-choice test
 Black pens (with nonfelt tip): For the free-response questions
 Your Social Security number: This number identifies you
 Your school code: Your school counselor or AP chemistry teacher can give you your
school code. The AP folks will give you one if you are home-schooled
 Photo I.D.: Just in case they suspect that you paid your neighbor to take the test for you
 A watch: You will need to pay close attention to the time
 A scientific calculator: For use on the free-response section

 Snacks and drinks: Quiet snacks, like soft granola bars, are a better choice than loud
snacks like cookies. First, you won’t disrupt others, and second, you won’t come crash-
ing down after a sugar high. Water is a better choice than sugar-filled soda for the same
reason.
 Appropriate clothing: You don’t know whether there will be an arctic freeze or global
warming at the test site, so be prepared for both. Layering your clothes works for
either instance.
 Tissues: No one wants to be distracted by sleeve wipes or sniffing. Bring something to
wipe your nose!
Knowing what not to bring
The following list needs just as much attention as the list of what you can bring (see the sec-
tion above, “Packing what you need”). The below items are some things you definitely don’t
want to bring. You run the risk of being thrown out of the test site for bringing some of these
items, so read closely:
 Scratch paper: The AP will let you use portions of the exam booklets to take notes. 
 Notes, books, dictionaries, highlighters, or cheat sheets: Leave it all at home, folks!
 Electronic devices like MP3 players, cell phones, beepers, and watches that beep:
No one wants to get interrupted by your Beyoncé ringtone.
 Your smart, nerdy friend to take the test for you: For some reason they don’t like that
substitution. 
 Energy drinks: Unless you want to come crashing down and have a brain melt, leave
them in the fridge.
Needing Special Attention
Normal is so last year. If you require special accommodations to take the AP exam, you are
not alone. Not everyone takes the test under the same conditions. You may have special cir-
cumstances that require that the test be administered to you in a different way. Here is a
brief list of special instances that might warrant an adjustment to the AP chemistry exam:
 Learning disabilities: If you have a diagnosed learning disability, you may be able to
get special accommodations. You may have extended time, large print, a reader, and
frequent breaks, among other things, but you must specifically request learning disabil-
ity accommodations on your application form. The accommodations you request will
depend on your specific, diagnosed learning disability. You should make sure that your
school has a SSD (Services for Students with Disabilities) Coordinator’s Form on file
with the College Board. You must fill out this form and send it to the College Board.
Allow seven weeks for the pros at College Board to review your request.
To get special testing
• You must have been formally diagnosed with a learning disability by a
professional.
• You must have a current, individualized educational plan at school. 
• In most cases, the evaluation and diagnostic testing should have taken place
within five years of the request for accommodations. 
16
Part I: Thriving Inside the Test Tube: How to Prepare for the Exam 

• You must also describe the comprehensive testing and techniques used to arrive
at the diagnosis, including test results with subtest scores. 
• Your best bet is to log on to the College Board Web site (www.collegeboard.
com/ssd/student/index.html) to see all up-to-the-minute requirements for
accommodations. 
 Physical disabilities: If you have a physical disability, you may be allowed to take a
test in a special format — in Braille, in large print, or on an audio cassette or CD.
Follow the same instructions detailed above to request accommodations, and if you
have further questions contact the College Board directly for more information.
 Religious obligations: If your religion prohibits you from taking a test on a specific day,
you may test on an alternate date. Again, the College Board folks can guide you in the
right direction for alternate dates.
 Military duty: If you’re an active military person you don’t need to complete the
normal registration form. Instead, ask your Educational Services Officer about the test-
ing through DANTES (Defense Activity for Non Traditional Educational Support).
Using Long-Term Strategies 
for Training and Survival 
When you decide to take the AP chemistry exam you’re basically committed to getting
hitched. Think of the test day as your wedding day and the months leading up to it your
engagement. You can consider the day after the test your divorce date, if you will, but for all
intents and purposes, you are pretty darn committed to nurturing your AP perpetual partner
until then.
You need to plan about ten months in advance for this test. You cannot study for this test like
you might a regular test in an ordinary class. In other words, you can’t cram — it just plain
doesn’t work for the AP tests. The AP people are a smart group — they know how to ask
questions in such a way as to eliminate (or not “qualify”) the students who didn’t plan in
advance, and simply stayed up all night with a few cans of Red Bull as support. About now,
you may be wondering what you should be doing for those ten months. Well, don’t despair:
We’ve outlined the entire ten months for you in the following sections. Consider us your AP
wedding planners! 
Early planning
The early-planning phase takes you from September to October. In the following list, we’ve
given you some solid ideas on what to do during each month as you plan for your upcoming
exam:
 September: As soon as you are able, enroll in an AP chemistry class. If your school
doesn’t offer one, speak with your counselor and see if there is a community college
chemistry course you could take. If an AP course is not available to you, get your
hands on a college level chemistry textbook, but keep in mind that nothing comes
close to a passionate teacher teaching you the concepts face-to-face. 
 November: Because you’ve been studying chemistry for a few months, you should be
ready to take a diagnostic test. You can use one of the sample tests in this book or you
can go to www.collegeboard.com and find some there. Taking such tests gives you an
early indicator of your strengths and weaknesses, which can help guide your studying
17
Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for the Exam

in the months to come. Your first diagnostic score can also help to identify what con-
cepts you need to pay more attention to in this book.
 December: Begin reading this book from the beginning. You will find that being in the
classroom for the last four months has provided you a wealth of information. You
should already be familiar with many of the concepts covered in the first third of this
book.
Midyear planning
You lay the groundwork for taking the exam in the earlier stages of planning to discover your
strengths and weaknesses. Although you’ve been honing your knowledge and skills the last
four months, you still need to continue to prepare from January to May:
 January through March: Continue reviewing this book and take another practice test
in early March. You still have two months before your wedding day, so your score on
this test will help you pinpoint further concepts from this book that you might still
need to review or re-review. 
 April and May: Take another practice test in early May. Make this your last practice
test. Whatever you do, do not take another practice test the week of the real test. Like a
long-distance runner who has been preparing all year for the big race, she doesn’t do
the race right before the race! 
Up-to-the-minute planning
Last-minute planning does not equal cramming! For ten months, you should’ve been prepar-
ing for your exam, and the last few days and minutes count as well. Make the best use of your
final time before the test by following this schedule:
 The night before the test: Relax the night before the test. You might be tempted to pull
an all-nighter, but our experience has proven that if you don’t know the material the night
before the test, you aren’t going to learn it the night before the test. Pamper your brain
instead by eating a good dinner, watching a movie, reading a good book. If you want to
glance at this book one last time, that’s cool, but just don’t turn it into a cram-fest.
 The morning of the test: Listen to your mama and eat breakfast, please. We know you
may be nervous and your appetite might be slim, but your brain needs the energy. If
you’re too nervous, or Heaven forbid, you’ve gotten up late, consider bringing some
healthy breakfast items for the car ride. It can actually help keep your mind less
stressed.
 Test day: Take the test.
 June: Wait patiently for your score . . . very patiently. Did we mention to wait patiently?
Feeling Confident: It’s All in Your Head 
You have been studying and preparing for this test for a long time. You know more than you
think you do. You might not remember every single detail of every single concept, but you
know at least something about something. If you come to the test feeling completely inse-
cure, please remind yourself that you did the work, you studied, and you will be fine.

Anticipating the outcome
Like we have been saying throughout this chapter, the AP exam tests core concepts and
material. There are no surprises. After finishing this book, you will have been exposed to all
the material you need to excel on this test. Anticipate the best possible outcome. 
Remembering: This is a test . . . This is only a test
Listen, your score on the AP test is not going to change your life. It’s not a do-or-die type of
experience. Your life’s success is not tied into the outcome of this test. Treat this test as you
would treat any other test you have taken (you’ve taken hundreds, right?). And don’t worry,
you don’t know the AP folks. They are not going to snicker as you walk by and say under
their breath, “There goes the one that didn’t know what Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure
was.” Although the AP guys don’t know you, we realize that your peers do. And it’s inevitable
that “score gossip” will creep into your conversations with your friends. Comparing scores is
not advisable, as it creates stress and underlying feelings about your chemistry capabilities.
Remembering that this is only a test and not a life-defining moment will help you stay bal-
anced and keep it all in perspective. 
Surviving During the Test with 
These Four Stress-Busters
It’s completely normal to feel some fear the day of the test. Everyone does. Research has
shown us that a little anxiety is actually good for the brain. A touch of anxiety helps the brain
stay ultra-focused and attentive. A little anxiety tells the brain, “Hey, brain, if I’m feeling this
way, whatever I’m doing must be important, so I better stay alert.” However, excess anxiety
and panic actually have the opposite effect. High levels of fear make the brain go into flight-
or-fight mode. Your brain tells your body to conserve your higher-order thinking skills in an
effort to send extra physical strength to the body in case of emergency. So, if you’re feeling
too much anxiety during the test, here are some stress-busters that will calm those nerves.
Counting to four
Breathing is grossly underrated. Take a deep breath until your belly expands, hold it in four
counts, and then expel the air for four counts. Be sure not to exhale like you’re in the middle
of an aerobic workout so as not to disturb the other test-takers. Oh, and some breath mints
wouldn’t hurt either.
Try not to take shallow breaths, which can cause you to become even more anxious because
your body is deprived of oxygen. Hyperventilating or sucking on your inhaler during the
exam is grossly overrated. 
Stretching
Several stretches can help relieve stress and make your body feel more relaxed and comfort-
able. Do the practices in the list discretely so you don’t disrupt others around you — in
other words, refrain from doing the downward-dog position from your yoga class:
19
Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for the Exam

 Rotate your head around to stretch out and relax your neck muscles. (We suggest keep-
ing your eyes closed so the proctor doesn’t think you are trying to cheat.) 
 Hunch and roll your shoulders to help relax your back and spine. You’ll be sitting for
quite some time, so maintaining good posture is crucial. 
 Shake out your hands like you have writer’s cramp. Imagine that all your tension and
stress is going out through your fingertips. 
 Extend and push out your legs like you’re pushing something away with your heels. 
 With your legs stretched out in front of you, point your toes back toward your knees
and hold that position for a count of three. 
Practicing visualization
Right before the exam or during a short break, practice creative visualization. Close your
eyes and imagine yourself in the test room cheerfully looking at questions that you know
the answer to, filling in the answers, finishing early, and double-checking your work. Picture
yourself leaving the exam room full of energy, and then getting your score and rejoicing.
Think of how proud of you your parents are (if thinking about them stresses you out leave
this one alone). Imagine not having to take early chemistry in college. The goal is to associ-
ate the AP exam with feelings of joy.
Don’t do this visualization exercise during the test. You’ll just waste time and lose
concentration.
Stop, drop, and, change your mind
Any time you feel yourself starting to panic or think negative thoughts, make a conscious
decision to
1. Say to yourself, “Stop, self! Don’t dwell on anything negative.” 
2. Drop that negative thought like a hot Bunsen burner. 
3. Then switch over to a positive train of thought.
For example, suppose you catch yourself thinking, “Why didn’t I pay more attention to chem-
ical equilibrium?” Change that script to, “I’ve got most of this right, maybe I’ll get this right,
too. No sense worrying now, overall I’m rocking my world!”

T
aking something apart is a great way to learn how to
put it together. In this part, we unsnap the building
blocks of matter so you can understand how matter is
reassembled. The first step is to get acquainted with the
building blocks themselves: atoms. Because all atoms are
themselves made of three types of even tinier building
blocks, we dissect the atom. Then, starting with just three
wee types of particles, we begin to show you how the
lovely complexity of the universe is built. Particles assem-
ble into elements, and elements bond into compounds. As
they bond, elements follow certain rules. Understanding
these rules, these few and simple rules, takes you a long
way to understanding the rest of chemistry.

F
or hundreds of years, scientists have operated under the idea that all matter is made
up of smaller building blocks called atoms. So small, in fact, that until the invention of
the electron microscope, the only way to find out anything about these tiny, mysterious par-
ticles was to design a very clever experiment. These experiments allowed chemists to get
around the fact that they couldn’t exactly corner a single atom in a back alley somewhere
and study it alone — they had to study the properties of whole gangs of atoms and try to
guess what individual ones might be like. Through some remarkable cleverness and some
incredibly lucky shots in the dark, chemists now understand a great deal about the atom,
and guess what? You need to, too! Because we don’t want to leave you hanging, in this chap-
ter we introduce you to everything you need to know about atoms, their properties, and
what they are made of.
Picking Apart Atoms and the Periodic Table
The following sections begin by giving you the basics on how atoms are structured so that
you can not only get to know their components, but also, you can easily figure out how
atoms help to classify elements. Even better, we give you the ultimate road map for the peri-
odic table, showing you how the periodic table can give you some valuable info that helps
you predict certain properties of elements.
Getting a gander at what makes up an atom
For now, picture an atom as a microscopic building block. Atoms come in all shapes and
sizes, and you can build larger structures out of them. However, like building blocks, atoms
are extremely hard to break. In fact, there is so much energy stored inside an atom that
breaking one in half is the process that drives a nuclear explosion. 

All substances consist of the 120 unique varieties of atoms, each of which is made up of a
combination of three types of subatomic particles:
 Protons: Protons have equal and opposite charges to electrons and have very nearly
the same mass as neutrons.
 Electrons: Electrons have equal and opposite charges to protons, and electrons are
much lighter than protons and neutrons. 
 Neutrons: Neutrons are neutral and have the same mass as protons.
We summarize the must-know information about the three subatomic particles in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1
The Subatomic Particles

Atoms always have an equal number of protons and electrons, which makes them overall
electrically neutral. Many atoms, however, actually prefer to have an unbalanced number of
protons and electrons, which leaves them with an overall charge. We discuss these charged
atoms, called ions, even further in the section “Exercising Electrons: Ions and Electron
Configuration,” later in this chapter.
The atom can still safely be called the smallest possible unit of an element because after you
break an atom of an element into its subatomic particles, it loses the basic properties that
make that element unique. 
So what does all of this mean for the structure of an atom? What does an atom actually look
like? It took scientists a very long time to figure it out through clever experimentation and
tricky math, and over time a succession of models grew closer and closer to an accurate
description:
 The Thompson model, also called the “Plum Pudding” model, pictured discrete, nega-
tively charged electrons evenly distributed through a positively charged medium that
composed the rest of the atom. The electrons were like plums in a positive pudding. 
 The Rutherford model modified the Thompson model by making clear that most of
the volume of the atom is empty space, with a large amount of charge concentrated
at the center of the atom. 
 The Bohr model built on the Rutherford model by describing the compact, central
charge as a nucleus composed of distinct proton and neutron particles. The positive
charge of the nucleus derived from the protons. Bohr envisioned electrons as discrete
particles that orbited the nucleus along distinct paths, like planets in orbit around
the sun.
 The Quantum Mechanical model modified the Bohr model, pointing out that electrons
do not orbit the nucleus like planets around the sun. Instead, they occupy their orbitals
in a cloudlike manner; one can only describe their location in terms of probability, with
some “dense” regions having a very high probability of having an electron and other
regions having lower probability.

Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

Classifying elements with mass 
and atomic numbers
Two very important numbers associated with an atom are the atomic number and the mass
number. Chemists tend to memorize these numbers like sports fans memorize baseball stats,
but clever chemistry students do not need to resort to memorization when they have the all-
important periodic table at their disposal. Here are the basics about atomic numbers and
mass numbers:
 The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. Atomic num-
bers identify elements, because the number of protons is what gives an element its
unique identity. Changing the number of protons (and therefore the atomic number)
changes the identity of the element. Atomic numbers are listed as a subscript (on the
bottom) to the left side of an element’s chemical symbol.
Notice that the atoms of the periodic table are lined up according to their atomic number.
Atomic numbers increase by one each time you move to the right in the periodic table, con-
tinuing their march, row by row, from the top of the table to the bottom. 
 The mass number is the sum of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
Subtracting the atomic number from the mass number gives you the number of neu-
trons in the nucleus of an atom. Different atoms of the same element can have different
numbers of neutrons, and we call those different atoms isotopes. Mass numbers are
listed as a superscript (on the top) to the left side of an element’s chemical symbol.
The mass number gives the mass of an individual atom in atomic mass units, amu,
where 1 amu = 1.66 × 10–27 kg.
Why, you may wonder, don’t we care about electrons? Remember that an electron has only
1⁄1836 of the mass of a proton or neutron. So, though electrons are incredibly important from
the standpoint of charge, they make little contribution to mass. Atomic masses in amu are
never whole numbers for a variety of reasons, including the fact that most elements exist in
nature as a combination of different isotopes. The percent of each isotope relative to the
whole is called its natural abundance. The nonwhole number atomic masses you see listed on
the periodic table are the average of all isotopes of a given element, in which each isotope is
weighted by its natural abundance within the average.
In order to specify the atomic and mass numbers of an element, chemists will typically write
that element in the form
where Z is the atomic number, A is the mass number, and X is the chemical symbol for that
element. 
Grouping elements within the periodic table
The whole purpose of the periodic table, aside from providing interior decoration for chem-
istry classrooms, is to organize elements to help predict and explain their properties. Notice
in Figure 3-1 that the atoms of the periodic table are lined up according to their atomic num-
bers, as if their teacher has just taken a roll call to make sure they are all in their proper
places. Here are some characterisitics of how the periodic table is organized: 
Z
A X
25
Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

 Atomic numbers increase by one each time you move to the right in the periodic table
and when they run out of space in one row, they move down one and continue increas-
ing to the right again.
 The rows are called periods.
 The columns are called groups.
The elements within any group have very similar properties. The properties of the elements
emerge mostly from their different numbers of protons and electrons, and from the arrange-
ment of their electrons. As you move across any period, you pass over a series of elements
whose properties change in a predictable way. Here are the groups you can find on the peri-
odic table:
 Group IA (alkali metals): Starting on the far left of the periodic table is group IA
(notice the group label atop each column), also known as the alkali metals. These ele-
ments, the most metallic of all elements, are very reactive, and are never found natu-
rally in a pure state, but always in a bonded state.
 Group IIA (alkaline earth metals): Just like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals
are highly reactive, and not found free in nature. 
 Group B . . . mostly (transition metals): The large central block of the periodic table is
occupied by the transition metals. Transition metals have properties that vary from
extremely metallic, at the left side, to far less metallic, on the right side. The rightmost
boundary of the transition metals is shaped like a staircase, shown in bold in the
figure, and the staircase separates the elements further:
• Metals: Elements to the left of the staircase (except hydrogen) are metals. Metals
tend to be solid, shiny, malleable (easily shaped), and ductile (easily drawn out
into wire). Metals also conduct electricity and heat and easily give up electrons.
• Nonmetals: Elements to the right of the staircase are nonmetals, which have
properties opposite to those of metals: They also tend to be solids, but are gener-
ally dull, hard, and do not conduct electricity.
• Metalloids or semi-metals: Elements bordering the staircase are called metalloids
or semi-metals because they have properties between metals and nonmetals:
They are somewhat ductile and a little shiny and can conduct electricity, but not
as well as a metal.
 Group VIIIA (noble gases): The most extreme nonmetals are the noble gases which are
inert, or extremely unreactive.
 Group VIIA (halogens): One column to the left of the noble gases, is another key family
of nonmetals, the halogens. In nature, the reactive halogens tend to bond with metals
to form salts, like sodium chloride, NaCl.
Be aware that some periodic tables use a different system for labeling the groups, in which
each column is simply numbered from 1 to 18, left to right.

Rummaging through reactivity 
in the periodic table
The properties of elements change as a function of the numbers of protons and electrons in
the element. Increasing numbers of protons increases the positive charge of the nucleus,
which contributes to electronegativity, the pull exerted by the nucleus of one atom on elec-
trons in a bond with a second atom. Increasing numbers of electrons changes the reactivity
of the element in predictable ways, based on how those electrons fill up successive energy
levels.
The outermost electrons (in the highest energy level, which is discussed later) are called
valence electrons. Valence electrons are the ones most important in determining whether an
element is reactive or unreactive and are the electrons involved in bonding. Because much
of chemistry is about the making and breaking of bonds, valence electrons are the most
important particles for chemistry. The details of how electrons fill up the various energy
levels are covered later in this chapter, in the section “Exercising Electrons: Ions and
Electron Configuration.” For now, understand that atoms are most stable when their valence
shells (or clouds) are completely filled with electrons.
Chemistry happens as a result of atoms attempting to fill the valence shells. Alkali metals are
especially reactive because they need only give up one electron to have a completely filled
valence shell. Halogens are especially reactive because they need only acquire one electron
to have a completely filled valence shell. The elements within a group tend to have the same
number of valence electrons, and for that reason tend to have similar chemical properties.
Elements in the A groups have the same number of valence electrons as the roman numeral
of their group. For example, magnesium in Group IIA has two valence electrons.
Rounding up the atomic radius 
in the periodic table
In addition to reactivity, another property that varies across the table is atomic radius, or the
geometric size (not the mass) of the atoms. As you move down a column or to the right along
a row on the periodic table, elements have both more protons and more electrons. As you
move down the table the added electrons occupy discretely higher energy levels. So, atomic
radius tends to decrease as you move to the right because the increasing positive charge of
the nuclei pulls inwardly on the electrons of that energy level. As you move down the table,
atomic radius tends to increase because, even though you are adding positively charged
protons to the nucleus, you are now adding electrons to higher and higher energy levels,
which are farther and farther from the nucleus and therefore feel a much lower attraction
to the nucleus.

Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

Exercising Electrons: Ions and Electron
Configuration
The outermost shell of an element, which is the highest energy level, is the valence shell.
Elements are so insistent about having filled valence shells that they’ll actively gain or lose
valence electrons to do so. Atoms that gain or lose electrons in this way are called ions.
When atoms become ions, they lose the one-to-one balance between their protons and elec-
trons, and therefore acquire an overall charge.
 Atoms that lose electrons (like metals) acquire positive charge, becoming cations,
such as Na+ or Mg2+. You can remember this with the simple phrase “cats have paws
(pos +),” so cations are positively charged.
 Atoms that gain electrons (like nonmetals) acquire negative charge, becoming anions,
such as Cl– or O2–.
In the following sections we show you how to figure out which elements gain or lose elec-
trons as well as how to diagram and write out electron configurations.
Knowing which elements gain or lose electrons
You can discover what kind of ion many elements will form simply by looking at their posi-
tion on the periodic table. With the exception of row one (hydrogen and helium), all elements
are most stable with a full shell of eight valence electrons, known as an octet. Atoms tend to
take the shortest path to a complete octet, whether that means ditching a few electrons to
achieve a full octet at a lower energy level, or grabbing extra electrons to complete the octet
at their current energy level. In general, metals tend to lose electrons, and nonmetals tend
to gain electrons. However, a partner atom is usually required for these processes to happen.
You can predict just how many electrons an atom will gain or lose to become an ion (but
things do get unpredictable in the transition metal region and then get more predictable with
the nonmetals). Elements tend to lose or gain as many electrons as necessary to have valence
shells resembling the elements in Group VIIIA, the noble gases:
 Group IA (alkali metal) elements lose one electron.
 Group IIA (alkaline earth metal) elements lose two electrons.
 Group VIIA (halogen) elements gain one electron.
 Group VIA elements tend to gain two electrons.
 Group VA elements tend to gain three electrons.
Figuring out electron configuration
An awful lot of detail goes into determining just how many electrons an atom has and just
which energy levels those electrons occupy. Several different schemes exist for annotating all
of this important information, but the electron configuration is a type of shorthand that cap-
tures much of the pertinent information. Each electron gets a symbol code that indicates the
type of energy and shape (called an electron orbital) that it will have in the atom.
30
Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

Here’s how electron configuration works:
 Each numbered row of the periodic table corresponds to a different principal energy
level, with higher numbers indicating higher energy. Remember higher energy means
farther from the nucleus.
 Within each energy level, electrons can occupy different subshells (or clouds). Different
types of subshells have slightly different energy levels.
 Each subshell has a certain number of orbitals.
• Each orbital can hold up to two electrons, but electrons won’t double up within
an orbital unless no other open orbitals exists within the same subshell.
• Electrons fill up orbitals from the lowest energies to the highest, to try to keep
everything in the lowest energy state, like everything else in chemistry.
The four types of subshells or clouds, named s, p, d, and f, fill with electrons in the
following ways:
 Row 1 consists of a single 1s subshell. A single electron in this subshell corresponds to
the electron configuration of hydrogen, written as 1s1. The superscript written after the
symbol for the subshell indicates how many electrons occupy that subshell. Filling the
subshell with two electrons, 1s2, corresponds to the electron configuration of helium.
Each higher principal energy level contains its own s subshell (2s, 3s, and so on), and
these subshells are the first to fill within those levels.
 In addition to s subshells, principal energy levels 2 and higher contain p subshells.
There are three p orbitals at each level, accommodating a maximum of six electrons.
Because the three p orbitals (also known as px, py, and pz) have equal energy in an iso-
lated atom they are each filled with a single electron before any receives a second elec-
tron. The elements in rows 2 and 3 on the periodic table contain only s and p subshells.
The p subshells of each energy level are filled only after the s subshell is filled.
 Rows 4 and higher on the periodic table include d orbitals, of which there are five at
each principal energy level, accommodating a maximum of 10 electrons. d subshell
electrons are a major feature of the transition metals. These are also equal in energy
unless the atom is involved in bonding.
 Rows 5 and higher include f orbitals, numbering seven at each level, accommodating a
maximum of 14 electrons. f subshell electrons are a hallmark of the lanthanides and the
actinides, the two rows of elements detached from the rest of the periodic table, and
set aside at the bottom.
After you get to row 4, the exact order in which you fill the energy levels can get a bit confus-
ing. To keep things straight, it’s useful to refer to the Aufbau filling diagram, shown in
Figure 3-2. Start at the bottom of the diagram and work your way up from the lowest arrows
to the highest. For example, always start by filling 1s, then fill 2s, then 2p, then 3s, then 4s,
then 3d, and so on.

Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

Noting exceptions to the Aufbau filling diagram
Sadly, there are a few exceptions to the tidy picture presented by the Aufbau filling diagram.
Copper, chromium, and palladium are notable examples. These exceptional electron configu-
rations arise from situations where electrons get transferred from their proper, Aufbau-filled
subshells to create half-filled or fully filled sets of d subshells; these half- and fully filled
states are slightly more stable than the states produced by strict Aufbau-based filling.
Two conditions typically lead to exceptional electron configurations: 
 Successive orbital energies must lie close together, as is the case with 3d and 4s
orbitals, for example.
 Shifting electrons between these energetically similar orbitals must result in a half-
filled or fully filled set of identical orbitals, an energetically happy state of affairs.
Here are a few examples:
 Strictly by the rules, chromium should have the following electron configuration:
[Ar]3d44s2.
 Because shifting a single electron from 4s to the energetically similar 3d level half-fills
the 3d set, the actual configuration of chromium is [Ar]3d54s1.
 For similar reasons, the configuration of copper is not the expected [Ar]3d94s2, but
instead is [Ar]3d104s1.
Writing out electron configuration
To come up with a written electron configuration you 
1. Determine how many electrons the atom in question actually has.
2. You assign those electrons to subshells, one electron at a time, from the lowest
energy subshells to the highest. 
In a given type of subshell (like a 2p or 3d subshell, for example) you only place two
electrons within the same subshell when there is no other choice. For example, only at
oxygen (1s22s22p4) would electrons begin to double up in the 2p subshells.
3. Write out the configuration based on the assignment of electrons.
From lowest subshell to highest, you write the subshell and add the number of electrons
assigned to it in superscript, like oxygen, 1s22s22p4.
For example, suppose you want to find the electron configuration of carbon:
1. Determine the amount of electrons. Carbon has six electrons, the same as the number
of its protons as described by its atomic number, and it’s in row 2 of the periodic table.
2. Assign electrons to subshells.
First, the s subshell of level 1 is filled.
Then, the s subshell of level 2 is filled.
These subshells each accept two electrons, leaving two more with which to fill
the p subshells of level 2.
Each of the remaining electrons would occupy a separate p subshell.
3. Write out the configuration: 1s22s22p2.
32
Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

Ions have different electron configurations than their parent atoms because ions are created
by gaining or losing electrons. Atoms tend to gain or lose electrons so they can achieve full
valence octets, like those of the noble gases. Guess what? Many of the resulting ions have
precisely the same electron configurations as those noble gases. So, by forming the Br–
anion, bromine achieves the same electron configuration as the noble gas, krypton. This is
called being isoelectronic. You can use this concept to condense electron configurations,
which can get a bit long to write. For example, [Ne]3s23p3 is the condensed configuration for
phosphorous. The expanded electron configuration for phosphorous is 1s22s22p63s23p3. The
condensed form simply means that the atom’s electron configuration is just like that of neon
(Ne), with additional electrons filled into subshells 3s and 3p as annotated. Warning: Don’t
try to get too creative and write something like [Be]2p4 for oxygen. Only noble gases can be
used for the base element in the condensed form! On the AP test be careful — if the problem
asks for the complete formula, the condensed version does not receive credit. 
Locating electrons with quantum numbers
Chemists use a set of four numbers called collectively the quantum numbers to describe the
state of any particular electron within an electron configuration of an atom. No two electrons
in the same atom can share the same set of quantum numbers. In other words, there is no
such thing as identical electron twins. They must differ from one another in at least one of
their quantum numbers. Note that chemists invented this scheme to describe electrons in an
atom. There are not “slots” to fill in the atom. 
 The principal quantum number, which indicates the principal energy level of an elec-
tron, is denoted with the variable n and can be any integer number greater than or
equal to 1. Electrons that share the same principal quantum number are said to be in
the same shell.
 The azimuthal quantum number, l, which denotes the subshell which an electron
occupies, has only four values: 0, 1, 2, or 3 corresponding to s, p, d, and f subshells
respectively. Any particular n value, or shell, has subshells ranging from l = 0 to l = n–1.
The third shell, for example, has subshells with l values 0, 1, and 2. In other words, the
third shell has s, p, and d subshells.
 The magnetic quantum number, ml, builds off of the azimuthal quantum number and
describes the three-dimensional geometry of each subshell. The magnetic quantum
number describes the number of orbitals in each subshell, and each orbital can be
occupied by at most two electrons. The magnetic quantum number has values ranging
from –l to l for each subshell. In other words, a p subshell (which has an azimuthal
quantum number of l = 1) has ml values of –1, 0, and 1, while a d subshell with an
azimuthal quantum number of l = 2 has ml values of –2, –1, 0, 1, and 2. This rule means
that a p subshell has three orbitals in which electrons may exist, while a d subshell
has five.
 The spin quantum number, s, has only two values: –1⁄2 and 1⁄2. Each orbital shares the
same n, l, and ml numbers by definition and, because no two electrons can share the
same set of quantum numbers, the spin quantum number must be where the two elec-
trons in an orbital differ. Two electrons can be in one orbital as long as one has a spin
of –1⁄2 and the other has a spin of 1⁄2. Counting up the ml and s quantum numbers leads
you directly to the number of total electrons that can fit in each subshell. If an s orbital
has an l value of 0, for example, this means that it has a single ml value of 0. Because
two electrons (one with each type of spin) can fit in this ml = 0 lobe, an s orbital will
always fit two and only two electrons no matter what its principle quantum number is.
Similarly, a p subshell has three ml values (–1, 0, and 1) and each of those can have
two electrons of opposing spin so a p subshell can have up to six electrons.

Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

Isolating Info on Isotopes
Isotopes are atoms of the same element, but they have different atomic masses, which must
translate to different numbers of neutrons. If that’s all there is to them, then why do chemists
get so titillated by isotopes? A neutron is, after all, a neutral particle, so you wouldn’t think
adding one would change much about an atom. Indeed, much of the time, adding a neutron
does not alter the properties of an element significantly, but merely makes it slightly heavier.
Occasionally, however, adding another sinister little neutron can push an atom over to the
dark side of radioactivity. If an atom has just the right number of neutrons, it becomes unsta-
ble, or radioactive, which means that it will break down into another element at a predicable
rate. These radioactive isotopes are called radioisotopes for short. The more unstable the
added neutron makes the atom, the faster it tends to decay into another.
Although the word “radioactivity” conjures up images of three-headed frogs and fish with ten
eyes, the truth is that it doesn’t deserve its bad rep. Many radioactive elements are harmless.
Some radioactive isotopes are very useful, such as those used in medical imaging.
Regardless of how you feel about radioactivity, we give you some useful calculations related
to radioisotopes and istopes that you definitely need to check out in the sections that follow.
Calculating the remainder of a radioisotope
Science and medicine are stuffed with useful, friendly applications for radioisotopes. Many of
these applications center on the predictable decay rates of various radioisotopes. These pre-
dictable rates are characterized by half lives. The half life of a radioisotope is simply the
amount of time it takes for exactly half of a sample of that isotope to decay into daughter
nuclei. For example, if a scientist knows that a sample originally contained 42mg of a certain
radioisotope and measures 21mg of that isotope in the sample four days later, then the half
life of that radioisotope is four days. The half lives of radioisotopes range from seconds to
billions of years.
Radioactive dating is the process scientists use to date samples based on the amount of
radioisotope remaining. The most famous form of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating,
which has been used to date human remains and other organic artifacts. However, radio-
isotopes have also been used to date the Earth, the solar system, and even the universe.
Table 3-2 lists some of the more useful radioisotopes, along with their half lives and decay
modes, which are described in detail later in the chapter.

To calculate the remaining amount of a radioisotope, use the following formula where A0 is
the amount of the radioisotope that existed originally, t is the amount of time the sample has
had to decay and T is the half life:
Calculating the average mass of an element
That number beneath each element in the periodic table is calculated using percentages
such as the carbon abundances mentioned earlier, which allow scientists to give an average
atomic mass for the isotope. Certain elements, such as chlorine, have several commonly
occurring isotopes, so their average atomic masses are rarely close to whole integers. Many
elements, however, such as carbon, have one very commonly occurring isotope and several
rare isotopes, resulting in an average atomic mass that is very close to the mass of the most
common isotope.

Comparing carbon masses
Consider the element carbon, for example, which has
three naturally occurring isotopes. carbon-12 (or carbon
with six protons and six neutrons), written as:
is boring old run-of-the-mill carbon, and it accounts for
99 percent of all of the carbon out there. carbon-13 (or
carbon with six protons and seven neutrons), written as:
is a slightly more exotic, though equally dull, isotope,
which makes up most of the remaining 1 percent of
carbon atoms. Taking on an extra neutron makes
carbon-13 slightly heavier than carbon-12, but does little
else to change it. However, even this minor change has
some very real scientific consequences. Scientists com-
pare the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 in meteorites to
help them determine where that meteorite came from.
These ratios have been especially useful for identifying
Martian meteorites. Earth is significantly more massive
than Mars, and therefore, has a stronger magnetic field,
allowing it to hold onto its atmosphere. Mars, on the
other hand, is too small to hold onto the upper part of its
atmosphere. carbon-12 is lighter than carbon-13, so it
floats up to the upper atmosphere of Mars, where the
solar wind comes along like the big bad wolf and blows
it away. This leaves Mars with a higher percentage of
carbon-13 than you would find on Earth. So, minerals on
Mars that take carbon from the atmosphere and turn it
into rock end up with a little more carbon-13 and a little
less carbon-12 than similar minerals on earth. When a
meteor from Mars lands on Earth, scientists can verify
its origin by testing the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13.
carbon-14, the most exotic and interesting isotope of
carbon, has been very important in the process of
radioactive dating. Carbon is one of the building blocks
of organic matter, including the human body. Only one
out of every trillion or so carbon atoms is the carbon-14

You have many, many trillions of trillions of trillions of
carbon atoms in your body, which means that you con-
tain trillions of atoms of radioactive carbon! Now before
you go checking the mirror to see if you have sprouted a
third eye, rest assured that this radioactive carbon will
not harm you in any way. In fact, it is what allows scien-
tists to determine the age of fossils.
As an example, take Matilda the Mammoth, who met her
untimely end 4,500 years ago. While Matilda was alive,
the carbon in her body was constantly being replen-
ished, so she was always made of about 99 percent
carbon-12, 1 percent carbon-13, and 0.0000000001 per-
cent carbon-14. However, when poor Matilda kicked the
bucket, the biological processes that were replacing the
carbon in her body came to an abrupt end. With their
supply of carbon-14 cut off, Matilda’s bones slowly lost
their carbon-14 as it broke down through radioactive
decay into nitrogen. Paleontologists digging up Matilda
4,500 years later will run straight to their friendly neigh-
borhood chemist, Dr. Isotopian, and ask him to tell them
how much carbon-14 is left in Matilda. Because carbon-
14 breaks down at a very predictable rate, Dr. Isotopian
is able to guess to within a few hundred years exactly
how long ago Matilda kicked the bucket.

To calculate an average atomic mass you 
1. Make a list of the masses of each isotope, noting the percentage, in decimal form, at
which each isotope is found in nature, a quantity called the relative abundance of
the isotope.
2. Multiply the mass and the relative abundance together.
3. Add up the results of each calculation in step 2 to get the average atomic mass.
On the AP chemistry exam, you will be expected to know how to calculate this weighted aver-
age or to determine at which isotope is the most common based on that weighted average.
The most commonly occurring isotope often has a mass number closest to the average
atomic mass. Be careful when the average atomic mass differs from the nearest whole
number by more than about 0.1, however. Such numbers can lead you to false conclusions
regarding the most abundant isotope. Chlorine, for example, has an average atomic mass of
35.5amu. This may lead you to conclude that the isotopes
both have roughly 50 percent abundances because the average atomic mass is almost
exactly halfway between 35 and 36. In reality, however 
exists with roughly 75 percent abundance, while 
exists with roughly 25 percent abundance. 
is about as common as a Chemistry teacher without chalk on the butt of his pants.
Running into Radioactivity
Atomic numbers are like name tags, identifying elements by telling you the number of pro-
tons in the nucleus of that element. Adding or removing a proton to the nucleus of an atom
changes its atomic number (and thus its identity), and atoms are very fond of their identities,
so adding or removing protons from an atom is usually impossible.
However, you can change atomic numbers:
 Certain large elements can be split in half, and certain small elements can be smashed
together in processes called nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, respectively. This splitting
or joining of atoms releases a tremendous amount of energy and is not something that
you should try at home, even if you do have a nuclear reactor in your basement.
 The only other way for an atom to change its atomic number (and therefore its identity)
is to “decay” into something else through a radioactive process, and this happens about
as often as chemists remember to brush their hair in the mornings. There are three key
ways in which an element can decay, and these are described following.

Many elements in the periodic table have unstable versions called radioisotopes. These
radioisotopes decay into other, generally more stable elements at periodic intervals in a
process called radioactive decay. There are many radioisotopes in existence; however not all
radioisotopes are created equal. Radioisotopes break down through three separate decay
processes. Yep, you guessed it: We’re gonna tell you all about ’em.
Alpha decay
The first decay process, called alpha decay, involves the emission of an alpha particle by the
nucleus of an unstable atom. Emitting an alpha particle, which is nothing more exotic than
the nucleus of a helium atom (two protons and two neutrons), causes the atomic number of
the daughter nucleus to decrease by two and the mass number to decrease by four. The fol-
lowing pattern shows the decay of the parent nucleus X into a daughter nucleus Y and an
alpha particle.
Beta decay
The second type of decay, called beta decay, comes in three forms: 
 Beta plus decay: A proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, a positron (e+),
and a tiny weakly interacting particle called a neutrino (υ), resulting in the atomic
number decreasing by one. The mass number, however, does not change, even though
the actual mass does change very slightly. A proton becoming a neutron, after all,
should have absolutely no effect on the mass number because both protons and neu-
trons are nucleons, or particles contained in the nucleus, and converting one to the
other does not change the overall number of particles in the nucleus.
Beta plus decay follows the form of the equation below, with the atomic number being
decreased by one and the mass number remaining the same.
 Beta minus decay: A neutron is converted into a proton, emitting in this case an elec-
tron and an antineutrino (υ). Again, the mass number remains the same throughout the
decay because the number of nucleons remains the same; however the atomic number
increases by one. In case you haven’t guessed, this is the reverse of beta plus decay.
Beta minus decay follows the form of the equation below, with the atomic number being
increased by one and the mass number remaining the same.
 Electron capture: The final form of beta decay occurs when an inner electron is cap-
tured by an atomic proton, converting it into a neutron and emitting a neutrino in the
process.
Electron capture follows the form of the equation below, with the atomic number being
decreased by one and the mass number remaining the same.
All three of these processes involve the emission or capture of an electron or a positron and
result in a change in the atomic number of the daughter atom.

Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

Gamma decay
The last form of decay, termed gamma decay, involves the emission of a high-energy form of
light, called a gamma ray, by an excited nucleus. Although it does not change the atomic
number or the mass number of the daughter nucleus, gamma decay often accompanies alpha
or beta decay and it is a means for the nucleus of a daughter atom to reach its lowest possi-
ble energy state. The general form of gamma decay is shown below, where 
represents the excited state of the parent nucleus, and the greek letter gamma (γ) represents
the gamma ray.
The forces that hold atomic nuclei together are extremely powerful, and the energy required
to join two light nuclei together or split one heavy nucleus in two is tremendous. The only
place where nuclear reactions happen in nature is in the very center of stars like our sun,
where extreme temperatures cause atoms of hydrogen, helium, and other light elements to
smash together and join into one. This extremely energetic process, called nuclear fusion, is
what ultimately causes the sun to shine and provides the outward pressure required to sup-
port the sun against gravitational collapse.
Nuclear fission, on the other hand, occurs only rarely in nature. At a site in central Africa
called Oklo a natural nuclear reactor has been found to have occurred many, many, years
ago. Humans first harnessed the tremendous power released when splitting an atom through
fission during the United States’s Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the
first atomic bomb. Fission has since been used for more benign purposes in nuclear power
plants, which produce energy much more efficiently and cleanly than traditional fossil fuel-
burning power plants.
Getting Electrons Excited
Special circumstances can drive electrons to configurations other than their ideal ground
state (or lowest energy) configurations. You will need to know the causes and consequences
of electrons being driven from their ground states and the equations that will allow you to
qualitatively analyze those transitions, all of which are laid out for you in this chapter.
Excited state
Electrons can be driven to higher energy levels than they would otherwise occupy by absorb-
ing energy in the form of heat, light, or electric current. An electron can only absorb an
amount of energy exactly equivalent to the difference in energy between the state it is already
occupying and another nearby energy state. Electrons in these higher-than-expected energy
levels are said to be in an excited state. Excited electrons quickly release amounts of energy
equivalent to the difference between their excited state and a lower energy state by emitting
a photon, or particle of light, with an equivalent energy. The wavelength (which in the realm of
visible light is equivalent to color) of this photon characterizes the energy difference between
the excited and lower energy state. It is only by measuring these that chemists know about
the energy structure of atoms. There isn’t any way to learn about the inside of an atom by just
looking at a ground state, stable one.

An electron that should be in the 3s subshell, for example, may be kicked up into the 4f sub-
shell, where it wants to remain just about as badly as you want to remain on the couch
during your Great Aunt Maybell’s slideshow of her summer at the lake. In order to get back
to the 3s subshell where it belongs, it must emit an amount of energy exactly equal to the
energy difference between the 4f and the 3s subshells. This energy difference corresponds to
a very specific wavelength, or color, of light because of the relationship between the energy
and wavelength of a photon of light.
Converting energies to wavelengths
Max Planck developed the equation 
to show the relationship between the wavelength and the energy of a photon. 
However, this equation can also be written as 
This alternative equation is based on another convenient relationship between the proper-
ties of light, specifically the relationship between wavelength and frequency:
Here’s an explanation of the variables in those two equations:
Energy (E) is expressed in Joules (J).
h is a constant called Planck’s constant equal to 6.63 × 10–34 m2 × kg/s.
Frequency (υ) is expressed in reciprocal seconds (1/s or s–1) also known as 
Hertz (1 Hz = 1 s–1).
c is the speed of light, specifically 3.0 × 108 m/s.
Wavelength (λ) is expressed in meters.
Niels Bohr, in order to complete his model of the atom, used Planck’s ideas to explain why
the orbits of electrons in the hydrogen atom are quantized, or occur only at certain distances
from the nucleus. Planck had proposed that the energy of light particles (photons) came in
quanta, or discrete values. Bohr found that the energy levels of the electron orbits were also
quantized and followed the formula 
where n is the principal quantum number. You will be expected to recognize and use this for-
mula for predicting energy levels in the hydrogen atom on the AP exam, but make sure that
you note that it applies to the hydrogen atom alone and will give you an incorrect answer if
you apply it to any other element.

Chapter 3: Looking Under the Atomic Hood: Atomic Structure

Emission spectra
Although it sounds like the next blockbluster sci-fi movie, Planck’s formula E = hυ also helps
explain the phenomenon of atomic emission spectra, which are characterized by bright lines
of light of very specific colors. Chemists had realized long before Bohr and Planck came
along that if you used a prism or spectrograph to disperse the light emitted when a pure
solid element is burned or a pure gaseous element has an electronic current passed through
it, then every individual element would emit a characteristic sequence of bright-colored lines
called its spectrum. No two excited elements emitted identical spectra, so spectra became a
definitive method for identifying elements.
An element’s characteristic spectrum contains lines of specific colors because every element
has its own unique set of allowed energies and therefore its own unique set of energy transi-
tions. Because excited electrons must emit photons in order to reach the ground state and
photon energies correspond directly to wavelengths, or colors, the appearance of every
atomic spectrum is unique in the color and brightness of each line. The brighter a spectral
line is, the more likely that transition is to occur. Most elements have hundreds of allowed
transitions and emit light from infrared to X-ray wavelengths. The specific wavelength of light
emitted when an electron drops to a lower energy level can be found by taking the energy dif-
ference between the excited and ground states and translating it into a wavelength using
Planck’s formula and substituting this energy change (∆) for E as in

he concepts reviewed in Chapter 3 are the most basic in all of chemistry, and they are
also some of the most important and testable concepts on the AP chemistry exam. A
strong understanding of the most fundamental aspects of modern chemistry is essential to
your success on the exam, and the concepts presented in Chapter 3 provide the foundation
for the rest of introductory chemistry. Questions that appear regularly in both multiple-
choice and free-response questions involve
 Periodic table trends
 Nuclear chemistry
 The structure of the atom and nucleus
Many AP questions that do not ask directly about atomic structure nonetheless assume that
you have a solid understanding of its concepts. 
In this chapter, we highlight the most important points of Chapter 3 for you, and then allow
you to try your hand at AP chemistry–style test questions about atomic structure. Keep your
eye out for these question types and others that build off of them in the practice tests
(Chapters 29 and 30) at the end of the book as well. 
Reinforcing the Foundation for Atomic Structure
For the AP exam, you should be familiar with the concepts of atomic structure as well as how
to use and manipulate any equations and/or constants related to atomic structure. In this
section we review these important concepts covering atomic structure so that you’re pre-
pared for some AP-style exam questions we give you later in this chapter.

Make sure that you thoroughly understand all of the basic components of the atom and how
scientists arrived at their understanding of the modern atom. Burn the following major points
into your brain before the exam:
 Atomic structure came to be understood gradually through the work of Thompson,
Rutherford and Bohr: 
• Thompson’s model, called the plum pudding model of the atom, consisted of
blobs of negative charge in a soup of positive charge. 
• Rutherford shot bullets (alpha particles) at tissue paper (gold foil) and had to
dodge them every once in a while as they came bouncing back at him. He thereby
discovered that the majority of the mass and one of the types of charge (the posi-
tively charged protons) of the atom were concentrated at its very center in the
nucleus. 
• Bohr said that the negative charges in an atom (the electrons) orbited the posi-
tively charged nucleus like the planets orbit the sun. 
• Later models see the electrons in atoms as cloudlike and not as particles that
orbit like planets around the sun.
 Proton number is what determines the identity of an atom and is equivalent to its
atomic number. 
 If you add the number of neutrons to the number of protons in an atom, you will get its
mass number, equivalent to the number of massive particles in its nucleus (nucleons,
or protons and neutrons). 
 All neutral atoms have equal numbers of positive and negative charges. 
 Atoms with more electrons than protons have excess negative charge and are called
anions.
 Atoms with too few electrons and excess positive charge are called cations.
 Atoms can decay via three processes:
• Alpha decay involves the emission of a helium nucleus, resulting in a daughter
atom with a decrease of two in the atomic number and four in the mass number. 
• Beta decay happens through three separate methods, all of which result in an
atomic number change of one. 
• Gamma decay is simply the emission of a high-energy particle of light by an
excited atom and does not result in any changes in the important numbers
defining an atom.
 Nuclear fusion involves the joining of two light elements into one heavier element.
 Nuclear fission involves the splitting of an enormous atom into two smaller atomic pieces.
 Electron configurations show the locations of the electrons in an atom, organized by
shells and subshells:
• Electrons always occupy these shells and subshells from lowest energy to highest,
often according to the Aufbau diagram. 
• Atoms of elements in the copper and chromium families, however, are prone to
“steal” an electron from their neighboring s orbitals in order to achieve a half full
or completely full d orbital, which is the more stable state. These elements have
exceptional electron configurations, which differ slightly from those predicted by
the Aufbau diagram.
• Unruly electrons can jump to higher energy levels by absorbing energy, which
they must then emit in order to reach the ground state. They release this energy in
the form of particles of light called photons, which have very specific wavelengths.

Testing Your Knowledge
Now that you’ve absorbed everything you need to know about atoms, try answering some
questions. Remember that you can look back at the formulas, variables, and constants, listed
on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book, but try not to look back at the rest of the text
until after you check your answers. 
The best way that you can practice is by going through the questions provided in this chap-
ter in one sitting and then checking them at the end to identify which areas you still need to
review.

reasoning.

element shares the same electron configuration in its neutral state?
Checking Your Work
You’ve done your best. Now check your work. Make sure to read the explanations thoroughly
for any questions you got wrong — or for any you got right by guessing.
1. (D). There are three p subshell orbitals, and an atom that has been forced to double up on
electrons in one and only one p orbital must have four electrons in its p subshell. The elec-
tron configuration of oxygen is 1s22s22p4, so it fits the bill.

2. (A). Atomic radius decreases as you move to the right across a period, therefore the ele-
ment in the list with the lowest atomic number (in other words, the farthest to the left), will
have the largest atomic radius. 
3. (E). The element with the largest value of the first ionization energy should be the one that
is least likely to give up an electron. Halogens are the most likely candidates for high first ion-
ization energies because they are the closest to achieving noble gas configurations through
gaining electrons. Fluorine is the only halogen in the group.
4. (A). The element with the lowest second ionization energy should be one that is eager to
give up its second electron. This corresponds to elements in the alkaline earth metal column,
which need to be ionized twice in order to achieve noble gas configurations. 
5. (B). Thirty-six years is equivalent to three half lives for 3H. This means that the amount of
radioactive material in the sample will have decreased by half three times. This leaves 2mg at
12 years, 1mg at 24 years, and 0.5mg at 36 years.
6. (B). The first statement is true because elements in the oxygen family always have full s
subshells and four electrons in their p subshells by virtue of sharing the same horizontal
location in the periodic table. B is not true. Several of the oxygen family’s elements fall below
the “staircase” marking the division between nonmetals and metals on the periodic table,
indicating that they are metals or semimetals. C is a deceptively tricky statement because,
while the atomic radius of elements in the same family do indeed decrease with decreasing
atomic number, elements in the same period have precisely the opposite relationship, so you
must be careful to keep them straight. D is also true because electronegativity increases to
the right in a period and toward the top of a family.
7. (C). One might expect molybdenum to have the electron configuration shown in A and B
(which are equivalent). However, molybdenum, being of the chromium family, falls under the
umbrella of exceptional electron configurations. Its 4d orbital will abscond with an electron,
which would normally belong to the 5s orbital in order to make it more stable. This leaves
you with the electron configuration 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s14d5, which can also be written
as [Kr]5s14d5.
8. (B). The net result in the decay of
to
is a decrease of four in mass number and a decrease of one in atomic number. Because nei-
ther beta nor gamma decay result in a decrease in mass number, an alpha decay must occur,
which would leave you with 
To then increase the atomic number by one from the initial alpha decay, 
must undergo a beta decay.

9(a). 24.3amu. Multiply each mass by its percent abundance in decimal form, giving you 
9(b). 3.84 × 10–19J. This problem is a direct application of the equation E = hν, and c = λν.
Plugging the speed of light as well as the given wavelength into the second equation and
solving for frequency gives you 
Take this frequency value and plug it in turn into the first equation to give you the energy
value of the spectral line in question:
10(a). Element 1 is lithium and Element 2 is berylium. It requires roughly 14 times more energy
to remove the second electron from element 1 than it did to remove the first, implying that the
first electron was given up relatively easily and that the atom is very reluctant to give up
another. This is consistent with the alkali metals, which only need to lose one electron to
achieve a noble gas configuration. Once any element achieves noble gas configuration, it is
reluctant to lose it by giving up another electron, explaining the large jump to the second ion-
ization energy. Because you are told that these elements are in the second period, element 1
must be lithium. As for Element 2, it requires only twice as much energy to remove the second
electron as was required to remove the first, but then it requires eight times more energy to
remove the third. This implies that the first and second electrons are considerably easier to
remove than the third, which is consistent with an alkaline earth metal. In this case, that metal
must be berylium, which is the only alkaline earth metal in the second period.
10(b). 1s2, helium. The general electron configuration of lithium is 1s22s1. When lithium is
ionized, however, it loses an electron, achieving the electron configuration of the noble gas
helium, whose electron configuration is simply 1s2.

hemistry textbooks would be much thinner if it weren’t for bonding. As appealing as
thinner textbooks may be, they’d come at the cost of other appealing things, such as
cars, chocolate (Heaven help us!), and being alive. Bonds of different types between differ-
ent elements and in different arrangements underlie the stunning diversity and complexity
of matter. Although that complexity may sound daunting, we make taking a look at bonding
a breeze by breaking down just how bonding builds things up. 
Bringing Atoms Together: Bonding Basics
Sometimes atoms hang out together. Sometimes they form close friendships, sometimes only
loose alliances. Close mutual attractions between atoms, ones strong enough to hold them
persistently together, are called bonds. Isn’t that sweet?
Why do atoms buddy up and bond with one another? In short, pairs of atoms seek stability.
In particular, atoms prefer to dwell in states with more stable electron configurations.
(Chapter 3 describes what makes for a stable electron configuration in case you need to
check it out . . . and you do for the exam.) Atoms just tend to be most stable when their
valence shells are completely filled with electrons so each atom does its best to fill its
valence shell, its outermost shell.
Just like the different types of bonds you form in life — bonds between buddies, sisters and
brothers, your children, your coworkers (okay, maybe that’s a stretch) — atoms form different
types of bonds as well, and we’ll give you the skinny on those types of bonds in the following
sections.
Attracting the opposite: Ionic bonds
Ionic bonds form between oppositely charged ions. Ions themselves form when an atom
either gains or loses valence electrons in pursuit of filling its valence shell. Positively charged
ions are electrostatically attracted to negatively charged ions, so the two nestle together to
form an ionic bond. In a sense, atoms transfer whole electrons to create ions and form these
bonds (more on cations and anions in Chapter 3). Sometimes, an ion consists of more than
one kind of atom. These multiatom ions are called polyatomic ions, which have won many
awards for their extreme inconvenience to chemistry students. Table 5-1 lists the most

common polyatomic ions, grouped by ionic charge. They’ll pop up frequently. They’ll annoy
you until you simply buckle down and memorize them. You can find out more about ionic
bonds later in the chapter in the section, “Eyeing Ionic Bonds.”

Sharing electrons: Covalent bonds
Covalent bonds form between atoms that share electrons, rather than transfer them. These
shared electrons are in orbits that surround both bonded atoms. Sharing may or may not be
equal, depending on which atom “wants” the electrons more. The chemical term for electron
greed is electronegativity. Differences in electronegativity between atoms largely determine
what kind of bond forms between them. As described more completely in the section,
“Getting a grip on electronegativity,” differences in electronegativity determine whether a
bond is ionic or covalent.
Keeping it solid with metals: Metallic bonding
Okay, we’re not referring to being groupies with a heavy metal band. You can do that after
the AP exam. Instead, metallic bonding occurs within metallic solids (big surprise, we know).
Metallic bonding helps to explain the unique properties of metals: 
 The electron-sea model of metallic bonding describes metallic solids as lattices of metal
cations immersed within a fluid “sea” of mobile electrons. Although the electrons are
constrained to the cation lattice, they can move freely within it. This model provides a
satisfying intuitive explanation for metals’ electrical conductivity because the electrons
within the lattice aren’t constrained to orbitals around individual atoms, but are in
delocalized orbitals.

 For example, a sample of solid copper holds itself together with metallic bonds. The
electrons in this sample don’t clearly “belong” to any particular copper atom, but can
move through the sample. So, if you draw out the sample into a wire, you can use the
mobile electrons to conduct electric current. 
So what do you get when you bond? In life, you get families and friends. In chemistry, you get
compounds. Chemical compounds are the consequence of bonding. A compound consists of
bonded atoms, and has properties that are different from a simple mixture of the identical,
nonbonded atoms. In other words, the structure of a compound confers properties to that
compound. The relationship between structures and properties is a major theme of chem-
istry. That theme revolves around the concept of the chemical bond. In the next section we
begin to deal with the basics of compounds, especially how to recognize and interpret their
names and formulas.
Naming Names: Nomenclature, Formulas,
and Percent Composition
Okay, so our parents always told us not to call people names, but in chemistry, there are
exceptions (and we don’t mean your chemistry teacher). There are more known chemical
compounds than there are residents of New York City so something must be done to keep
these compounds straight. In the early days of chemistry, far fewer compounds were known,
so chemists assigned those compounds common names, like “ammonia.” Calling a compound
by its common name is essentially like calling it “Reggie.” Eventually, it became clear that
common names, while charming, made a mess of things because these names told you noth-
ing about the compound. So, modern chemists prefer systematic names, ones assigned by
certain rules, which tell you a great deal about a compound. The process of using rules to
assign names to compounds is called chemical nomenclature.
In the next sections you’ll learn to move easily back and forth between the chemical formula
for a compound (H2O) and its systematic name (dihydrogen oxide). For common compounds,
there is always the possibility of a charmingly messy common name (water). Finally, you’ll
learn to crunch the numbers of percent composition, one of the common ways chemists begin
to define an unknown compound.
Knitting names to formulas: Nomenclature
Different naming rules apply to inorganic compounds (ones not based on multi-carbon struc-
tures) versus organic compounds (ones that are based on multi-carbon structures). The
system presented in this chapter applies to inorganic compounds; organic compound
nomenclature is described in Chapter 25.
The main idea behind systematic naming is that the poor, addled chemist, drowning in com-
pounds, can move easily between the name of a compound and that compound’s formula.
Formulas can be one of two types:
 Empirical: An empirical formula lists the kinds of atoms in a compound and gives the
ratio of atoms to each other — not necessarily their actual numbers. 
 Molecular: A molecular formula also lists the kinds of atoms in a compound, but gives
the actual number of each kind of atom within one molecule of that compound. The
compounds nitrogen monoxide and dinitrogen tetroxide make clear the difference
between empirical and molecular formulas; just check out Table 5-2.

When you write out the molecular formula, if the number of atoms within a molecule of the
compound is one (1), you don’t write the numeral one (1), as it’s implied. Nitrogen monoxide
only has one atom within each molecule of that compound so you write its molecular for-
mula simply as NO.
A great number of chemical compounds are binary compounds, ones that are built of only
two kinds of elements. Binary compounds can be either ionic (held together by ionic bonds)
or molecular (held together by covalent bonds). Ionic compounds have only empirical for-
mulas because they are not composed of distinct molecules. Molecular compounds have
both empirical and molecular formulas.
Naming binary compounds
Many chemical substances are binary compounds, consisting of only two kinds of elements.
The generic formula for a binary compound is XAYB, where X and Y are the different elements,
and A and B are the relative (and sometimes actual) amounts of each element within one rep-
resentative unit of the compound. A representative unit might be a molecule or it might be a
formula unit, the smallest repeating unit of an ionic compound. 
Figure 5-1 provides a visual summary of the method for assigning systematic names to inor-
ganic compounds, but we also give you the steps for naming a binary compound below.

Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

To name a binary compound, ask yourself these questions:
1. Is X hydrogen? Compounds that contain hydrogen cations (H+) often fall into a class
of compounds called acids. Sadly, many common acids are still saddled with common
names. Table 5-3 summarizes many of these names. Although these are common names
(and are therefore inconvenient), some patterns exist that help make sense of things:
• Acids composed with monoatomic (single-atom) anions use the prefix hydro- and
the suffix -ic.
• Acids composed with polyatomic anions with names ending in -ate use the 
suffix -ic.
• Acids composed with polyatomic anions with names ending in -ite use the 
suffix -ous.
• If a polyatomic anion includes the prefix per- or hypo-, that prefix transfers to the
acid name.
• Be careful. If a compound like HCl is in a gaseous state, it is not called hydrochloric
acid.
2. Is X a nonmetal or a metal? If X is a nonmetal, you’re dealing with a molecular com-
pound. As such, you’ll need to use prefixes to describe the number of each type of
element, X and Y. Table 5-4 summarizes the prefixes you’ll most commonly encounter.
If X is a metal, then you’re dealing with an ionic compound — proceed to step 3.
The name of a molecular compound usually lists the element furthest to the left within
the periodic table as the first. If both elements occur in the same column, the lower one
is usually listed first. The second element in the name of the compound receives the
suffix -ide.
Prefixes are always given on both elements unless there is only one of the first element;
in that case, the “mono” prefix is dropped.
Nitrogen monoxide (NO) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) are examples of molecular
compounds named according to these rules.
3. Is X a metal that can form cations of different charges? Although alkali metals and
alkaline earth metals reliably form only one kind of cation, metals in the center of the
periodic table (especially the transition metals) can sometimes form different charges of
cations. If a compound contains one of these metals, you must specify the charge of the
cation within the compound name. To do so, use Roman numerals within parentheses
after the name of the metal; the Roman numeral corresponds to the size of the positive
charge. For example, the element iron, Fe, frequently occurs as either a +2 cation or a 
+3 cation. The Roman numeral system describes Fe2+ as iron (II) and Fe3+ as iron (III).
Unlike the case with molecular compounds, ionic compound names do not include pre-
fixes to describe the number of each kind of atom within the ionic compound. Why
not? Because ionic compounds always occur in the combination of ions that results in
zero overall charge. Because ionic compounds have zero overall charge, you can use
the charges of the individual ions to determine the formula of the ionic compound —
and vice versa. Binary ionic compounds add the suffix -ide to the name of the second
element.
Here are some examples of binary ionic compound formulas and names:
• Na+ and Cl- combine to form NaCl, known as sodium chloride.
• Fe2+ and O2- combine to form FeO, known as iron (II) oxide.
• Fe3+ and O2- combine to form Fe2O3, known as iron (III) oxide.
4. Is Y a polyatomic ion? If Y is a polyatomic ion, you have permission to be momentarily
annoyed. After the moment has passed, either recall the name of the polyatomic ion
from memory (as you’ll have to do on the AP Chemistry exam), or refer to a handy
table like Table 5-1.
51
Chapter 5: Working and Playing Together: Bonding

For example, if Y is SO4
2–, then you’re dealing with the polyatomic ion called sulfate. If
your compound is Na2SO4, then the name is sodium sulfate.

Calculating percent composition
Formulas and names emphasize the numbers of different kinds of atoms within a compound.
Percent composition emphasizes the mass of different kinds of atoms within a compound.
Naming by percent composition simply means that you make a list of each kind of atom in a
compound accompanied by the percent of the compound’s total mass contributed by that
kind of atom.
To calculate percent composition you
1. Determine the mass for each mole of the compound. Do this by counting the number
of each kind of element within the compound, finding the elements’ atomic masses
from the periodic table, and then adding up the individual masses of all the elements.
2. Determine the mass for each mole of each atom. Again, find the elements’ atomic
masses on the periodic table.
3. Multiply the mass of the atom by however many of that atom the compound
contains.
52
Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

4. Divide the mass contributed by an individual element by the total mass of the
compound.
5. Multiply the result of step 4 by 100%.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each element type in the compound.
7. Write out the percent composition by listing each element type alongside that
element’s percent mass.
Consider the compound water, H2O. 
 Each mole (6.022 × 1023) of water molecules has mass 18.02g. 
 Each mole of water molecules contains one mole of oxygen atoms and two moles of
hydrogen atoms.
 Each mole of oxygen atoms has mass 16.00g. 
 Each mole of hydrogen atoms has mass 1.008g. 
So, you calculate the percent composition of water 
Oxygen: (16.00g mol–1 / 18.02g mol–1) × 100.0% = 88.79%
Hydrogen: [(2 × 1.008g mol–1) / 18.02g mol–1] × 100.0% = 11.21%
More briefly, the percent composition is O 88.79%, H 11.21%.
So, by sheer number of atoms, water is mostly hydrogen. But by mass — in other words, by
percent composition — water is overwhelmingly oxygen.
Eyeing Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds form between cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged
ions). The strength of an ionic bond derives from electrostatic attraction between ions of
opposite charge. Ionic compounds form extended, three-dimensional lattices, such as the
one shown in Figure 5-2. The exact geometrical arrangement of ions in an ionic lattice results
from an interplay of factors, all conspiring to maximize the favorable (as in attractive) inter-
actions between the ions.
The NaCl lattice shown in Figure 5-2 consists of repeating, two-atom units of Na+ and Cl-. You
can imagine that each sodium atom has donated an electron to a neighboring chlorine atom.
Thinking about ionic bonding in this way makes clear why ionic compounds typically form
between a metal and a nonmetal. Metals tend to lose valence electrons easily. Nonmetals
tend to gain extra valence electrons avidly. Ions scratch each other’s backs.

Chapter 5: Working and Playing Together: Bonding

The strength of ionic bonds within an ionic compound is expressed by lattice energy. Lattice
energy represents the amount of energy required to completely separate the component ions
of one mole of an ionic compound into gaseous ions. Larger positive lattice energies corre-
spond to stronger ionic bonds.
Electrostatic attraction increases not only with the magnitude of opposing charges, but also
as the distance between those charges decreases. In other words, greater quantity of charge
attracts more strongly than less quantity of charge, and closer charges attract more strongly
than distant charges. The overall charge of an ion effectively acts as a point charge at the
atom’s center. The centers of bigger-sized atoms can’t nestle as closely together as those of
smaller-sized atoms. As a result, ionic bonds tend to be stronger between ions with greater
magnitude of charge and between ions of smaller size. So, the strongest ionic bonds are
between two small, highly charged ions.
Considering Covalent Bonds
Unlike ionic bonds, where atoms either lose or gain electrons, covalent bonds are a a kinder,
gentler bond. Covalent bonds form when atoms share valence electrons. Atoms do this kind
of thing because it helps them to fill their valence shells. Covalent bonds tend to form
between atoms that do not completely give up electrons. In other words, covalent bonds
tend to form between nonmetals.
Sharing electrons . . . or not
The attractive force of a covalent bond arises from the attraction of the shared electrons to
the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms. Within bonds, electrons don’t act as truly
distinct particles, but are distributed into “clouds” of varying density. The shared electrons
of a covalent bond distribute with higher density in the region directly between nuclei, as
shown in Figure 5-3.
Each single covalent bond houses two shared electrons. In a standard covalent bond, each
bonded atom contributes one electron. So, each atom gains one electron (that of its bonding
partner) in the bargain.
Sometimes one atom donates both electrons to a covalent bond, with the other atom con-
tributing no electrons. This kind of bond is called a coordinate covalent bond. Atoms with
lone pairs of electrons often engage in coordinate covalent bonding. A lone pair consists of
two electrons that are not used in bonding paired within the same orbital.
Even though covalent bonding usually occurs between nonmetals, metals can engage in
coordinate covalent bonding. Usually, the metal receives electrons from an electron donor
called a ligand.

Getting to know structural formulas
Atoms can share more than a single pair of electrons. When atoms share two pairs of elec-
trons, they form a double bond, and when they share three pairs of electrons they form a
triple bond. A solid line drawn between element symbols serves as shorthand in structural
formulas to indicate that atoms are covalently bonded. So, the covalently bonded atoms of
water, carbon dioxide, and dinitrogen can be indicated as shown in Table 5-5.

Rules for determining the number of covalent bonds between atoms and for estimating the
geometric arrangement of covalently bonded atoms are described in Chapter 7.
Measuring the strength of covalent bonds
Bond enthalpy describes the strength of covalent bonds. The bond enthalpy (∆H) is an esti-
mate of the amount of energy required to break the bond. In the case of diatomic molecules
with single covalent bonds (such as Cl2), the bond enthalpy is a very good estimate. In the
case of polyatomic molecules (such as CH4, which contains four distinct C-H bonds), the
bond enthalpy is an average bond enthalpy, an estimate averaged over the four bonds of
the molecule.
Larger bond enthalpies correspond to stronger covalent bonds. Typically, atoms held
together with more bonds and/or with stronger bonds approach each other more closely
than do atoms held together with fewer and/or with weaker bonds.
Bond enthalpies are easily measured, so chemists frequently use them to help determine the
strength of bonds and to estimate bond distances. On the AP exam, you might be asked to
make the same kinds of estimates from a set of bond enthalpy data. 
Separating Charge: Polarity and
Electronegativity
Polarity refers to an uneven distribution of charge. In chemical bonds, polarity arises from a
difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms. More electronegative atoms draw
greater electron density toward themselves. You might think that atoms with more protons
(more positively charged nuclei) are always more electronegative, but this isn’t the case.
Why? The electronegativity of an atom derives from the positive charge of its nucleus and
from the extent to which that positive charge is offset or “shielded” by the successive layers
of electron density that surround that nucleus. Because atoms with many protons also tend
to have a greater number of electron shells, the large positive charge of these atoms’ nuclei
is partially offset by the negatively charged electron shells. 
55
Chapter 5: Working and Playing Together: Bonding

Getting a grip on electronegativity
Within a given row of the periodic table, electronegativity tends to increase from left to right.
Within a given column of the table, electronegativity tends to increase from bottom to top.
These trends are only overall patterns because electronegativity is influenced by more subtle
factors. The electronegativities of the elements are shown in Figure 5-4.

The greater the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms, the more polar is
the bond between those atoms. Covalent bonds that are very polar more closely resemble
ionic bonds than do covalent bonds that are less polar. In fact, no real physical distinction
exists between ionic and covalent bonds — ionic bonds are simply so polar that it becomes
useful to imagine that one atom has emerged entirely victorious from the tug-of-war between
competing nuclei for electron density.
Although different sources use slightly different numbers to make the split between polar and
nonpolar, usually, differences in electronegativity are interpreted with the following categories:
 A difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms of less than about 0.3 leads
to a description of the bond as “nonpolar.”
 A difference in electronegativity ranging from 0.3 to about 1.7 leads to a description of
“polar.”
 A difference in electronegativity greater than about 1.7 leads to the description “ionic.”
Digging into dipoles
Within a polar covalent bond, electrons are distributed unevenly between the two atoms.
The more electronegative atom is surrounded by greater electron density and assumes a par-
tial negative charge. The less electronegative atom draws correspondingly less electron den-
sity and assumes a partial positive charge. Partial negative and partial positive charges are
indicated by the symbols δ– and δ+, respectively. Separation of charge along the line connect-
ing two bonded atoms (the bond axis) creates a bond dipole. Bond dipoles are often indicated
in one of two different ways, as shown in Figure 5-5:
The size of a bond dipole is measured quantitatively by the dipole moment, µ. A dipole
moment measures the polarity of a bond by taking into account two key factors: 
 How much charge is separated along the bond axis
 How far apart the charge is separated
Polar bonds have a larger dipole moment than nonpolar bonds. Dipole moments are vector
quantities, which means that they have both size and direction. Within a molecule, different
bonds may point in different directions, and these differences can be important.
Individual bonds’ dipoles sum over all the bonds of a molecule, resulting in a molecular
dipole. In addition to the permanent dipoles created by polar bonds, instantaneous dipoles can
flicker into and out of existence within nonpolar bonds and molecules. Both kinds of dipoles
play important roles in the interactions between molecules. Permanent dipoles lead to
dipole-dipole interactions and to hydrogen bonds. Instantaneous dipoles lead to attractive
London forces.

In addition to ion-ion interactions, these are the forces that must be overcome in order to
turn a liquid into a gas or a solid into a liquid. Different compounds have different boiling
points and different melting points because they engage in different collections of interac-
tions. Here is a summary of the intermolecular forces that contribute to boiling and melting
points, and examples of compounds in which each kind of force dominates.

hapter 5 introduced you to chemical bonds, the attractive forces that bring atoms
together to form compounds. Atoms come together to form different kinds of bonds
and a multitude of different compounds. Yet, for all the complication, the basic rules of the
game are pretty straightforward. Review them here and test your mastery of the material
with the practice questions.
Brushing Up on Bonding Forget-Me-Nots
We’ve included a helpful summary of the points from Chapter 5 that you need to remember.
So, do some bonding of your own with the following list:
 Compounds are collections of atoms held together by bonds. 
• Ionic bonds arise from electrostatic attraction between ions of opposite charge
(between anions and cations). 
• Covalent bonds arise when atoms share electrons. 
• Metallic bonding involves a sea of electrons that moves freely through a lattice of
metal cations.
 Ionic bonds tend to form between a metal and a nonmetal. 
 Covalent bonds tend to form between nonmetals.
 Inorganic compounds are named in a systematic way (see the figure in Chapter 5).
Naming and recognizing compounds will be much easier if you are familiar with the
common polyatomic ions (see the table in Chapter 5).
 Solid ionic compounds consist of a highly ordered lattice of ions. The strength of an
ionic bond within a lattice is expressed by lattice energy. Large, positive lattice energies
correspond to strong ionic bonds.
 Other factors being equal, ionic bonds tend to be stronger between ions with more
charge, and between smaller ions.
 Electrons within covalent bonds distribute with greater density in the region between
the two atomic nuclei.
 Usually, each atom of a covalent bond contributes one electron per bond. When one
atom contributes both electrons, we say the bond is a coordinate covalent bond.

 The strength of covalent bonds is described by bond enthalpy. Large, positive bond
enthalpies correspond to strong covalent bonds.
 Polar bonds are marked by unequal sharing of electrons. Electronegativity is the ten-
dency of an atom to draw electrons to itself. 
• Bonds between atoms with extreme differences in electronegativity are ionic. 
• Bonds between atoms with significant differences in electronegativity are polar
covalent. 
• Bonds between atoms with insignificant differences in electronegativity are
nonpolar covalent.
 The polarity of a bond is described by the bond dipole, µ = Qd, where Q is the magni-
tude of the separated charge and d is the distance of separation.
 Bond dipoles sum within molecules to produce molecular dipoles. Dipole-dipole and ion-
dipole interactions are major contributors to the properties of different compounds,
especially boiling points and melting points.

Checking Your Work
You’ve done your best. Now check your work. Make sure to read the explanations thoroughly
for any questions you got wrong — or for any you got right by guessing.
1. (E). Both Fe2O3 (iron (III) oxide) and FeO (iron (II) oxide) can form, the former from the Fe3+
cation and the latter from the Fe2+ cation. Fe3O2 is a bad choice because the overall charge of
this compound is not neutral; even using Fe2+, there is an excess of positive charge because
each oxygen can contribute only –2 charge.
2. (D). As shown, SiO3 is least likely to be stable. Although the SiO3
2– (silicate) anion exists,
the compound shown in the question is neutral. In order to fill its valence shell and remain
neutral, silicon requires four covalent bonds. 
3. (C). Li2CN is least likely to occur because the “ion math” doesn’t work. Lithium forms cations
with +1 charge (Li+) and the cyanide ion has –1 charge (CN-). So, a more likely version of this
compound is LiCN.

Chapter 6: Answering Questions on Bonding

4. (E). If a manganese ion with +4 charge is used (Mn4+), the compound can form; that ion is
specified by the Roman numeral IV. As described in the answer for question 1, Fe2O3 is cor-
rect as long as the Fe3+ ion is used. But the Roman numeral II in the name specifies the Fe2+
ion. Answer A is incorrect because the alkali metal cesium forms only ions with +1 charge, so
no Roman numeral is used in its name. The correct names for the compounds in choices C
and D are carbon tetrabromide and nitrogen dioxide, respectively.
5. (C). Percent composition refers to percent weight. So, a 100.g sample of the mystery com-
pound would contain 50.00g carbon, 44.41g oxygen, and 5.59g hydrogen. To convert these
masses to relative numbers of each type of atom, divide each mass by the molar mass of
that atom:
50.00g carbon / (12.01g mol–1) = 4.163 mol carbon
5.59g hydrogen / (1.01g mol–1) = 5.53 mol hydrogen
44.41g oxygen / (16.00g mol–1) = 2.776 mol oxygen
Next, take the smallest mol value of the set (2.776 mol in this case) and divide all the mol
values by that number. You get: 1.5 mol carbon, 1 mol oxygen, and 2.0 mol hydrogen. You
can’t build compounds with fractions of an atom, so multiply all results by the smallest
number that will produce a set of whole numbers. In this case, multiplying all values by 2
does the trick, yielding: 3 mol carbon, 2 mol oxygen, and 4 mol hydrogen. Finally, assemble
the atom symbols and the whole numbers into an empirical formula: C3H4O2.
6. (C). Covalent bonds between identical atoms are nonpolar because each atom has identical
electronegativity.
7. (E). The sea of mobile electrons that is the defining feature of metallic bonding supports
electrical conductivity; the mobile electrons can move in response to applied voltage.
8. (A). Ionic bonds are strong, but the extreme order of ionic bonding lends itself to
fracturing.
9. (D). Coordinate covalent bonds form when one atom contributes both electrons to the
bond; lone pairs are perfect for this task, because they include two electrons not otherwise
involved in bonding.
10. (B). Polar covalent bonds form between the atoms in compounds like these because the
atoms have significantly different electronegativities — but not so different that ionic bonds
form instead.

olecular shapes help determine how molecules interact with each other and within
themselves. For example, molecules that stack nicely on one another are more likely
to form solids. And two molecules that can fit together so their reactive bits lie closer
together in space are more likely to react with one another. In this chapter, we describe
how to get a sense of the shape of a molecule, starting with only its molecular formula.
Then, we explore a few ways that molecular shape can impact molecular properties.
Drawing Dots and Lines with Lewis
Valence electrons are critical for bonding. If that sentence confuses you, then you need to
amble through Chapter 5 before moving further into this chapter. Because valence electrons
are the ones important for bonding, chemists use Lewis electron dot structures: symbols that
represent valence electrons as dots surrounding an atom’s chemical symbol.
You should be able to draw and interpret electron dot structures for atoms so that you
understand how the dots relate to the valence shell electrons possessed by an atom. By
keeping track of how filled or unfilled an atom’s valence shell is, you can predict whether it
is likely to bond with other atoms in an attempt to fill its valence shell. 
Drawing electron dot structures
Figure 7-1 shows the electron dot structures for elements in the periodic table’s first two
rows. Electrons in an atom’s valence shell are represented by dots surrounding the symbol
for the element. Completely filled shells are surrounded by eight (8) dots (or two dots, in the
lone case of helium). Valence shells progressively fill moving from left to right in the table.
This pattern repeats itself with each successive row of the periodic table, as each row corre-
sponds to adding a new outermost valence shell. Because atoms are most stable (think
“happiest”) when their valence shells are full, they tend to seek full-shell states in one of two
ways. Atoms may gain or lose electrons (forming anions or cations, respectively) to end up
with filled shells. Or, atoms may covalently bond with each other so that each atom can lay
claim to the electrons within the bond.

To draw the electron dot structure of any element 
1. Write the element’s name.
2. Count the number of electrons in that element’s valence shell.
3. Draw that number of dots around the chemical symbol for the element. As a general
rule, space the dots evenly around the element’s symbol. 
Constructing Lewis structures
Just as electron dot structures show the number of valence electrons that surround individ-
ual atoms, Lewis structures use dots and lines to show the distribution of electrons around
all the atoms within a compound. Lewis structures are great tools for figuring out which mol-
ecules are reasonable (filling up all the atomic valence shells) and which molecules aren’t so
reasonable (leaving some valence shells unhappily unfilled).
If you know the molecule’s formula you can figure out the correct Lewis structure for that
molecule. The following example gives you the steps you need to work out a Lewis structure.
This example uses formaldehyde, CH2O. You can follow along with Figure 7-2:
1. Add up all the valence electrons for all the atoms in the molecule.
These are the electrons you can use to build the structure. Account for any extra or
missing electrons in the case of ions. For example, if you know your molecule has +2
charge, remember to subtract two from the total number of valence electrons. In the
case of formaldehyde, C has four valence electrons, each H has one valence electron,
and O has six valence electrons. The total number of valence electrons is 12.
2. Pick a “central” atom to serve as the anchor of your Lewis structure.
The central atom is usually one that can form the most bonds, which is often the atom
with the most empty valence orbital slots to fill. In larger molecules, some trial-and-error
may be involved in this step, but in smaller molecules, some choices are obviously better
than others. For example, carbon is a better choice than hydrogen to be the central atom
because carbon tends to form four bonds, whereas hydrogen tends to form only one
bond. In the case of formaldehyde, carbon is the obvious first choice because it can form
four bonds, while oxygen can form only two, and each hydrogen can form only one.
3. Connect the other, “outer” atoms to your central atom using single bonds only.
Each single bond counts for two electrons. In the case of formaldehyde, attach the
single oxygen and each of the two hydrogen atoms to the central carbon atom.
4. Fill the valence shells of your outer atoms. Then put any remaining electrons on the
central atom.

Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

In our example, carbon and oxygen should each have eight electrons in their valence
shells; each hydrogen atom should have two. However, by the time we fill the valence
shells of our outer atoms (oxygen and the two hydrogens), we have used up our allot-
ment of 12 electrons.
5. Check whether the central atom now has a full valence shell.
If the central atom has a full valence shell, then your Lewis structure is drawn
properly — it’s formally correct even though it may not correspond to a real structure.
If the central atom still has an incompletely filled valence shell, then use electron dots
(nonbonding electrons) from outer atoms to create double and/or triple bonds to the
central atom until the central atom’s valence shell is filled. Remember, each added
bond requires two electrons. In the case of our formaldehyde molecule, we must create
a double bond between carbon and one of the outer atoms. Oxygen is the only choice
for a double-bond partner, because each hydrogen can accommodate only two elec-
trons in its shell. So, we use two of the electrons assigned to oxygen to create a second
bond with carbon.
Getting bonds straight with line structures
Atoms involved in covalent bonds share electrons such that each atom ends up with a com-
pletely filled valence shell, as described more fully in Chapter 5. The simplest and best stud-
ied covalent bond is the one formed between two hydrogen atoms (dihydrogen). Separately,
each atom has only one electron with which to fill its 1s orbital. By forming a covalent bond,
each atom lays claim to two electrons within the molecule of dihydrogen. Covalent bonds
can be represented in different ways, as shown for dihydrogen in Figure 7-3.

Chapter 7: Doing Atomic Geometry: Molecular Shapes

Lewis structures for compounds more complicated than dihydrogen can get pretty busy-
looking. Most Lewis structures get rid of the dizzying effect of swarms of electron dots by
representing shared electron pairs — that is, covalent bonds — as lines. Each two-dot elec-
tron pair that is shared between two atoms is rewritten as a nice, clean line connecting the
atom symbols. Only nonbonding electrons (lone pairs) are left as dots. Whether a Lewis
structure for a compound uses electron dot pairs or lines to represent bonds, those dots or
lines refer to preceisely the same entities: covalent bonds. 
Atoms can share more than a single pair of electrons. When atoms share two pairs of elec-
trons, they are said to form a double bond, and when they share three pairs of electrons they
are said to form a triple bond. Examples of double and triple bonds are shown with Lewis
structures using both electron dots and lines in Figure 7-4.
Rummaging through resonance structures
Sometimes a given set of atoms can covalently bond with each other in multiple ways to
form a compound. In these cases, you can draw several possible valid Lewis structures for
the compound. This situation leads to something called resonance. Each of the possible
Lewis structures is called a resonance structure. The actual structure of the compound is a
resonance hybrid, a sort of average of all the resonance structures. Resonance is particularly
common in molecules where much bonding occurs in a side-by-side manner with p-orbital
electrons from adjacent atoms. These kinds of bonds are called π bonds (see “Overlapping
Orbitals to Form Valence Bonds “ for more on that type of bond).
When resonance structures involve π bonds, electrons in the bonds can become “delocal-
ized,” forming an extended orbital that bonds more than two atoms. The benzene molecule,
shown in Figure 7-5, is a classic example of resonance and electron delocalization.

Overlapping Orbitals to Form Valence Bonds
When we say that covalent bonds “share” valence electrons (if you’re asking yourself, “What
in the world are covalent bonds?” see Chapter 5 for more info), what do we really mean? We
mean that shared electron pairs now flit about within overlapping atomic orbitals (if your
head is orbiting right now trying to figure out what atomic orbitals are, check out Chapter 3). 
From a molecular formula you can figure out a Lewis structure. From the Lewis structure and
by using valence bond theory and VSEPR theory you can often get a pretty good idea of the
shape of a molecule, which is a major factor in determining other properties, like polarity,
phase behavior, and the tendency to interact or react with other molecules. Going from a
Lewis structure to a molecular shape requires a little know-how, however. In the next few sec-
tions, we give you the skills you need.
We realize the word “theory” sounds stuffy and perhaps intimidating, but, hey, we didn’t pick
it. However, we take the stuffiness out of the valence bond theory as well as the VSEPR
theory in the following sections so that you can predict the shape of molecules.

Chapter 7: Doing Atomic Geometry: Molecular Shapes

Getting a grasp on valence bond theory
According to valence bond theory, two atoms approach each other as they form a covalent
bond, overlapping their electron shells, until they reach a minimum energy (see Figure 7-6).
The positively charged nuclei draw closer together as each is attracted to the negative
charge of the electrons between them. After a point, drawing any closer together would
crowd their positively charged nuclei too closely for comfort. The positive charges begin to
repel at such short distances. So, the length of the covalent bond is the result of a balancing
act between attractive and repulsive forces.
Different kinds of bonds result from the different ways the orbitals can overlap in space. The
kind of symmetry the resulting bond has with the bond axis, (an imaginary line that connects
the centers of the bonded atoms) determines what kind of bond is formed:
 Sigma bond: When orbitals overlap in a way that is completely symmetrical with the
bond axis, a σ bond (sigma bond) is formed. Sigma bonds form when s or p orbitals
overlap in a head-on manner. Single bonds are usually sigma bonds.
 Pi bond: When orbitals overlap in a way that is symmetrical with the bond axis in only
one plane, a π bond (pi bond) is formed. Pi bonds form when adjacent p orbitals over-
lap above and below the bond axis.
Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds because the electrons within sigma bonds lie
entirely between the two atomic nuclei, simultaneously attracted to both. A double bond is
one sigma bond and one pi bond, and a triple bond is one sigma bond and two pi bonds.
Figure 7-7 shows you an example of a sigma bond forming from two s orbitals and the forma-
tion of a pi bond from two adjacent p orbitals.

Shaping up with the VSEPR theory
Sigma and pi bonds form by overlapping the valence orbitals of atoms (see “Getting a grasp
on valence bond theory” for more on sigma and pi bonds), so the overall shape of a molecule
depends largely on the geometric arrangement of valence orbitals around each atom. That’s
where VSEPR theory comes into play. Now don’t worry: We’ll start with the hard part: VSEPR
stands for valence shell electron pair repulsion. Okay, now it gets easier. VSEPR is simply a
model that helps predict and explain why molecules have the shapes they do.
Only use VSEPR theory on the “p-block” elements. These elements are the ones in Groups
IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA, VIIA, and VIIIA (except helium) on the right side of the periodic table. For
the most part, this restriction means that you use VSEPR theory to predict geometry around
nonmetal atoms.
In the following sections, we break down the basics of VSEPR theory so you can understand
and predict the shape of molecules.
Predicting shapes with VSEPR theory
Simply by combining the principle that valence electron pairs (lone or bonds) want to get as
far apart as they can (thus “repulsion” in the acronym VSEPR) with the fact that lone pairs
repel more strongly than do bonding pairs, you can predict an impressive array of molecular
shapes. The total number of valence electron pairs determines the overall geometry around
a central atom. The distribution of these pairs between bonding and nonbonding orbitals
adjusts that geometry. So VSEPR theory can predict several shapes that appear over and
over in real-life molecules.These shapes, shown in Figure 7-8, resemble those observed in
real-life molecules.

Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

Making molecular shapes with hybridization
VSEPR theory is pretty good at making predictions about what shapes will emerge from a
set of mostly equivalent valence shell electron pairs. But wait — what about the difference
between valence electrons in s orbitals versus those in p orbitals? These electrons don’t
seem equivalent. That’s when hybridization jumps in. Hybridization refers to the mixing of
atomic orbitals into new, hybrid orbitals. Valence electron pairs occupy equivalent hybrid
orbitals.
Check out the electron configuration of carbon in Figure 7-9. Carbon contains a filled 1s
orbital, but this is an inner-shell orbital, so it doesn’t impact the geometry of bonding.
However, the valence shell of carbon contains one filled 2s orbital, two half-filled 2p orbitals,
and one empty p orbital. Not the picture of equality, so the valence orbitals must form new
shapes or hybridize.
Different combinations of orbitals produce different hybrids. One s orbital mixes with two p
orbitals to create three identical sp2 hybrids. One s orbital mixes with one p orbital to create
two identical sp hybrids. Centers with sp3, sp2, and sp hybridization tend to possess tetra-
hedral, trigonal planar, and linear shapes, respectively.
Doing the math to predict molecular shapes
The shapes of real molecules emerge from the geometry of valence orbitals — the orbitals
that bond to other atoms. Here’s how to predict this geometry:
1. Count the number of lone pairs and bonding partners an atom actually has within a
molecule. You can do this by looking at the Lewis structure.
In formaldehyde (H2C = O), for example, carbon bonds with two hydrogen atoms and
double bonds with one oxygen atom. So, carbon effectively has three valence orbitals.
2. Next, inspect the electron configuration, looking for the mixture of orbital types
(like s and p) that the valence electrons occupy.
Carbon has four valence electrons in 2s22p2 configuration. Two valence electrons
occupy an s orbital, and one electron occupies each of two identical p orbitals. The
s orbital isn’t equivalent to the p orbitals. So, we mix the s orbital with the two p
orbitals to create three identical sp2 hybrid orbitals, as shown in Figure 7-11.
Note that the total number of orbitals doesn’t change; in the example, formaldehyde has
three valence orbitals before mixing and still has three valence orbitals after mixing. VSEPR
theory predicts that electrons in three identical orbitals mutually repel to create a trigonal
planar geometry like the one shown in Figure 7-8, which is the shape of the formaldehyde
molecule.
Elements in periods 3 and below of the periodic table can engage in hypervalency, meaning that
they can possess more than eight electrons in their valence shell. Hypervalency complicates
things a bit, but the basic principles of VSEPR theory still apply — electron pairs distribute
themselves as far apart as possible around the hypervaent atom. Depending on the distribu-
tion of bonding and nonbonding electron pairs, hypervalent atoms participate in “expanded
octet” geometries like octahedral, square planar and T-shaped, as shown in Figure 7-10.

Polarity and Isomers
You can often get a pretty good idea of the shape of a molecule (if you can’t, see the section
earlier in this chapter, “Overlapping Orbitals to Form Valence Bonds”). Knowing the shape of
a molecule helps you to understand the molecule’s other properties, like polarity, phase
behavior, and the tendency to interact or react with other molecules. These are exactly the
kinds of things that chemists and the rest of us actually care about, whether we know it or
not. For example, life on Earth depends largely upon the unique polarity and shape of the
water molecule. The tasty combination of oil and vinegar in a raspberry vinaigrette depends
on the phase behavior of the oil and vinegar components.

Part II: Building Matter from the Ground Up: Atoms and Bonding 

Polarity
The shape of a molecule and its polarity have a fairly simple relationship; the polarity of a
molecule emerges from the polarities of the bonds within that molecule. As described in
Chapter 5, differences in the electronegativity of atoms create polarity in bonds (which
causes those bonds to be polar bonds) between those atoms. Each polar bond possesses a
bond dipole, which is represented by this symbol: µ. Depending of the shape of the molecule,
individual bond dipoles may or may not lead to an overall molecular dipole, a polarity in the
molecule as a whole.
You can calculate a bond dipole by multiplying the amount of charge separated along that
bond (Q) by the distance of the separation, d. Because the SI units of charge and distance are
Coulombs (C) and meters (m), this calculation yields units of Coulomb-meters. A Coulomb-
meter is a ridiculously big unit compared to the size of bond dipole, so bond dipoles are typi-
cally reported in debyes (D), where 1 D = 3.336 × 10–30 C·m.
You won’t be asked to calculate a bond dipole on the AP exam, but knowing how bond
dipoles are calculated helps you to understand how they add up within a molecule.
You won’t be asked to calculate a bond dipole on the AP exam, but knowing how bond
dipoles are calculated helps you to understand how they add up within a molecule.
The precise way in which individual bond dipoles contribute to the overall molecular dipole
depends on the shape of the molecule. Dipoles add as vectors. Basically, this means
 If two equivalent bond dipoles point in opposite directions, they cancel each other out.
 If the two bond dipoles point in the same direction, they add.
 If two bond dipoles point at a diagonal to one another, the horizontal and vertical com-
ponents of the dipoles add (or cancel) separately.
The molecular dipoles of carbon dioxide and water demonstrate vector addition of bond
dipoles nicely, as shown in Figure 7-12:
 Each molecule consists of a central atom bonded to two identical partners. 
• In the case of carbon dioxide, carbon double-bonds to two oxygens to produce a
linear molecule (thanks to sp hybridization!). The two C–O bond dipoles of
carbon dioxide cancel each other out, so the molecular dipole is zero.
• In the case of water, a single oxygen atom single-bonds to two hydrogens that
leaves the oxygen with two lone pairs.
 The bond pairs and the lone pairs (which are sp3 hybridized) lead to a nearly tetra-
hedral orbital geometry and result in a bent shape of the molecule as you trace from
hydrogen to oxygen to hydrogen.
 The two C-O bond dipoles of carbon dioxide cancel each other out, so the molecular
dipole is zero. 
 Only the horizontal components of the two H-O bond dipoles of water cancel each
other out. 
 The vertical components of those bond dipoles add, making the molecular dipole of
water the sum of those components.
Because carbon dioxide has no molecular dipole, it interacts very weakly with itself and
therefore is a gas at room temperature. Because water has a significant molecular dipole, it
acts as a good solvent for other polar compounds.

Chapter 7: Doing Atomic Geometry: Molecular Shapes

Isomers
Molecular shapes can contribute to chemical diversity (an abundance of compounds with
differing properties) through the creation of isomers. Isomers are compounds made up of the
same atoms but put together in different arrangements. Isomers with the same molecular for-
mula may freeze or boil at different temperatures, may undergo different kinds of reactions,
and may have important differences in situations where exact shape is critically important.
Distinguishing between isomers is especially important in organic chemistry and biochem-
istry (see Chapter 25 for more detail on these) because these branches of chemistry involve
many large molecules built with many individual bonds. With many bonds, there are many
opportunities for isomerism. It turns out that big organic molecules can be very selective,
reacting specifically with one isomer but not with others.
The following list gives you an overview of the different kinds of isomers, and how each is
related to the others:
 Structural isomers have the same set of atoms, but the atoms are connected differently.
 Stereoisomers have the same bonds, but different three-dimensional arrangements of
atoms. Among stereoisomers, you have
• Geometric isomers: Geometric isomers can occur when atoms are restricted
from rotating freely about their bonds, such as in the case of a double bond or
when bulky groups of atoms bump into each other. In these cases, atoms or
groups of atoms can get trapped on one side or the other of the bond, creating
geometrically distinct versions of the molecule.
• Optical isomers: Optical isomers (also called enantiomers) are mirror images of
one another, but ones you can’t superimpose — in the same way you can’t match
your left hand with your right hand when both palms face in the same direction.
Molecules that have this handedness are called chiral.

hapter 7 was packed with ideas, starting with the way valence electrons distribute
themselves around individual atoms, building up through the way atoms connect them-
selves into molecules with particular shapes and finishing with the way molecular shapes
help determine the properties of different compounds. In other words, Chapter 7 was a lot
to take in one bite. Here is where you chew. In the following sections we review the high-
lights of Chapter 7, give you practice problems to help sear important concepts into your
brain, and give you full explanations for the answers to help you swallow what you’ve
chewed. 
Shaping Up the High Points
Before you attempt any questions in this chapter, you should review the following sections of
important points from Chapter 7.
Electron dot structures and Lewis structures
Electron dot structures and Lewis structures use dots and/or lines to represent valence
electrons and/or lines to represent valence electron pairs. 
Basic steps to follow when drawing a Lewis structure are
1. Add up all the valence electrons for all the atoms in the molecule.
2. Pick a “central” atom to serve as the anchor of your Lewis structure.
3. Connect the other, “outer” atoms to your central atom using single bonds only.
4. Fill the valence shells of your outer atoms. Then put any remaining electrons on the
central atom.
5. Check whether the central atom now has a full valence shell. 

Compounds that can engage in multiple, valid Lewis structures participate in resonance,
based on an old idea that the molecules might actually be in equilibrium between the multi-
ple structures. Although we now know that not to be the case, the term has stuck. Individual
resonance structures contribute to an overall, averaged structure called a resonance hybrid.
Adjacent p-orbital electrons are commonly involved in resonance, in which they participate
within delocalized π bonds.
Valence bond theory
Valence bond theory describes covalent bonds in terms of overlap between atomic orbitals:
 Orbitals that overlap in a manner completely symmetric to the bond axis form sigma
bonds.
 Orbitals that overlap in a manner that is symmetric to the bond axis in only one plane
form pi bonds.
VSEPR theory
VSEPR theory explains molecular shapes in terms of mutual repulsion between electron pairs
(both bonding and nonbonding pairs) around a central atom: 
 Lone (nonbonding) pairs repel more strongly than bonding pairs.
 Valence electrons in different kinds orbitals (like s and p orbitals) hybridize into mixed,
equivalent orbitals. The total number of hybridized orbitals is the same as the original
number of unmixed orbitals.
 One s orbital mixes with one p orbital to create two identical sp hybrids.
sp hybridized centers will have linear geometry. 
 One s orbital mixes with two p orbitals to create three identical sp2 hybrids. 
sp2 hybridized centers will have trigonal planar geometry.
 One s orbital mixes with three p orbitals to create four identical sp3 hybrids. 
sp3 hybridized centers will have tetrahedral geometry.
Bond dipoles
Individual bond dipoles arise from differences in electronegativity in bonded atoms. Except
for homonuclear diatomic molecules (like O2, H2, and so on), all atom-atom bonds will have a
at least a small bond dipole. Within a molecule, bond dipoles may or may not contribute to
an overall molecular dipole depending on geometry:
 Bond dipoles add as vectors within molecules, building on each other or canceling
each other out depending on geometry.
 Dipole moment (µ) = amount of separated charge (Q) × distance separated (d); the
equation looks like this: µ = Qd

Isomers
Isomers are compounds made up of the same atoms, but are put together in the following dif-
ferent arrangements:
 Structural isomers have different bonds. 
 Stereoisomers have the same bonds, but different three-dimensional arrangements of
atoms.
• Geometric isomers can occur when atoms are restricted from rotating freely about
their bonds.
• Optical isomers (also called enantiomers) are nonsuperimposable mirror images
of one another and are therefore chiral.

1. (D). H2 is the least polar because its sole covalent bond occurs between atoms that are
identical, and which therefore have identical electronegativity. H2S and H2O are close, but
H2O is slightly more polar because oxygen is slightly more electronegative than sulfur. The
“bent” geometry of both H2S and H2O is key to the presence of a molecular dipole in each

case — a linear shape would lead to canceling of the bond dipoles, resulting in nonpolar
molecules. The sole covalent (nearly ionic) bond in HF is the most polar of them all.
2. (C). Bond angles of 109.5° signify a perfect tetrahedron. Many molecules approach this
ideal, but perfect tetrahedral geometry typically requires that the central atom (carbon, in
this case) possess four identical bonding partners (chlorines, in this case). 
3. (E). The last set of resonance structures, for CO3
2– anion, are incorrect. Each of the struc-
tures includes an oxygen atom with an excess of valence electrons. The oxygen atom double-
bonded to carbon in each structure should have only two lone pairs, not three.
4. (C). Group IVA atoms tend to engage in four covalent bonds. Because of hybridization,
these bonds involve four identical sp3 orbitals.
5. (D). In formaldehyde, the central carbon indeed exhibits sp2 hybridization. This hybridiza-
tion leads to a trigonal planar (though not perfectly so) molecular shape. However, the three
sigma bonds are not identical, for two reasons. First, C-O bonds differ in polarity from C-H
bonds. Second, the C-O bond axis includes a pi bond; double-bonding between carbon and
oxygen brings those two atoms closer together than does a single bond.
6. (B). In water, for example, the two lone pairs of oxygen and the two O-H bonds lead to just
such a bent shape. 
7. (A). In an sp hybridized atom, there are only two bond axes. The electrons in these axes
mutually repel to achieve the maximum separation afforded by linear geometry.
8. (D). Because of its perfect tetrahedral geometry, silicon tetrafluoride is nonpolar, despite
the fact that each silicon-fluorine bond is polar.
9. (C). Nitrate displays resonance between three sp2 hybridized resonance structures. The
hybrid structure therefore has a trigonal planar shape consistent with sp2 hybridization.
10. (E). This compound may have thrown you. The central phosphorous of PCl5 is “hyperva-
lent,” meaning that it engages in more than the three covalent bonds you’d expect from its
position on the periodic table. But even if the hypervalency freaked you out, take heart: the
basic principles of VSEPR still apply. Whatever the reasons for pentavalent phosphorous, the
fact remains that the electrons within the five bond axes mutually repel, seeking the shape
with maximum separation. That shape is trigonal bipyramidal. 
11. (C). Carbon III engages in a double bond (with carbon) and in two single bonds (with
hydrogen and nitrogen). This arrangement leads to three bonding axes and sp2 hybridization.
12. (D). Carbon I engages in four separate single bonds, one with another carbon and three
with hydrogens. Four separate single bonds around a central carbon are a hallmark of sp3
hybridization. Nitrogen II may at first appear to be sp2 hybridized, because it engages in only
three bonds — but the nitrogen also contains a lone pair, and is thus sp3 hybridized.
13. (B). Carbons I and III keep their four valence electrons occupied within various combina-
tions of covalent bonds. Because it has one more valence electron than carbon, Nitrogen II
engages in only three covalent bonds, reserving two electrons as a nonbonding “lone pair.” 
14. (C). Double bonds, like the carbon-carbon double bond in which Carbon III participates,
include both sigma and pi bonds.

A
t first pass, gases may seem to be the most mysterious of the states of matter. Nebulous
and wispy, gases easily slip through our fingers. For all their diffuse fluidity, however,
gases are actually the best understood of the states. The key to understanding gases is that
they all tend to behave in the same ways — physically, if not chemically. For example, gases
expand to fill the entire volume of any container in which you put them. Also, gases are
easily compressed to fill smaller volumes. 
Before taking the AP chemistry exam, you will need to become familiar with a body of equa-
tions called the ideal gas laws and should be able to choose the equation appropriate to a
particular situation and manipulate it. You will also need to have a solid understanding of the
underlying theory that describes the behavior of gases, including kinetic molecular theory
and the differences between real and ideal gases. This chapter will familiarize you with all of
these concepts, after that you should tackle Chapter 10, which includes questions on gases
similar to those which will appear on the actual exam.
Moving and Bouncing: Kinetic Molecular
Theory of Gases
Imagine two billiard balls, each glued to either end of a spring. How many different kinds of
motion could this contraption undergo? You could twist along the axis of the spring. You
could bend the spring or stretch it. You could twirl the whole thing around, or you could
throw it through the air. Diatomic molecules have just such a structure and can undergo
these same kinds of motions when you supply them with energy. As collections of molecules
undergo changes in energy, those collections move through the states of matter — solid,
liquid, and gas. Transitions between phases of matter will be described in detail in Chapter 11,
while this chapter will lay out the basics of kinetic theory.

The basics of kinetic theory
Kinetic theory, the body of ideas that explains the internal workings of gases and the phe-
nomena caused by them, first made a name for itself when scientists attempted to explain
and predict the properties of gases. Kinetic theory also explains the behavior of solids and
liquids, and Chapter 11 will cover how it applies to each of those phases. Kinetic theory as
applied to gases is particularly concerned with how the properties of a gas change with vary-
ing temperature and pressure. The underlying idea behind kinetic theory is the concept of
kinetic energy, or the energy of motion. The particles of matter within a gas (atoms or mole-
cules) undergo vigorous motion as a result of the kinetic energy within them. 
Gas particles have a lot of kinetic energy and constantly zip about, colliding with one another
or with other objects. This is a complicated picture, but scientists simplify things by imagin-
ing an ideal gas where
 Particles move randomly.
 The only type of motion is translation (moving from place to place, as opposed to twist-
ing, vibrating, and spinning).
 When particles collide, the collisions are elastic (perfectly bouncy, with no loss of
energy).
 Gas particles neither attract nor repel one another. 
Gases that actually behave in this simplified way are called ideal.
The model of ideal gases explains why gas pressure increases with increased temperature.
By heating a gas, you add kinetic energy to the particles. As a result, the particles collide
with greater force upon other objects, so those objects experience greater pressure. In other
words, as temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of gas particles increases and
pressure increases proportionally as well.
Statistics in kinetic theory
The study of all matter, and gases in particular, is a study of statistics. Gas properties are
measured in averages rather than absolutes. Note that above we spoke of temperature as
being proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas particles, not the kinetic energy of
an individual gas particle. You could spend your whole life searching for a collection of gas
molecules in which each individual particle is moving at the same speed as the next. Because
gas particles collide and transfer energy between one another at random, neighboring gas
particles generally experience different numbers of collisions and end up with different
kinetic energies. If you were to measure the velocities of a whole slew of gas molecules, you
would find that although they will have a distribution of varying velocities, they will be clus-
tered around an average value. Remember that a liter of gas at STP contains 6.02 × 1023 gas
particles, which is a lot to average!
Examine the two velocity distributions in Figure 9-1. Both show a similar bell-shaped curve
(called a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution). Note that the probability of finding a gas particle
at a certain velocity drops off precipitously as that velocity gets farther from the average
velocity peak. Although both of the distributions in Figure 9-1 are Gaussians, there is one key
difference between them: The figure on the left represents the velocity distribution of gas
particles at a low temperature, and the figure on the right shows a similar distribution at a
higher temperature. 
84
Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

Note the features of the low-temperature distribution:
 The peak of the velocity distribution is at a lower velocity.
 The velocity distribution shows a pronounced peak with a relatively narrow range of
velocities surrounding it.
Note the features of the high-temperature distribution:
 The peak of the velocity distribution is at a higher velocity.
 The velocity distribution shows a wider, flattened curve with a large range of velocities.
Particle velocities translate into average kinetic energies through the equation:
KE = 1⁄2 mv2
This is the kinetic energy of an individual gas molecule, where m is the mass of the molecule
and v is the velocity. To calculate an average kinetic energy, we therefore need an expression
for the average velocity.
In this expression u is the average velocity of a collection of particles, and is alternately
written as urms (the root-mean-square velocity), R is the ideal gas constant 8.314 J K–1 mol–1,
T is temperature, and M is the molar mass. Although we will not derive this expression here,
take a minute to look at it and assure yourself that it makes sense. The expression has tem-
perature in the numerator of the velocity calculation, which means that as temperature
increases, average velocity should as well. This is consistent with kinetic theory. Molar
mass, however, appears in the denominator of the equation, which means that as molar
mass increases, average velocity decreases. This too makes sense; kinetic energy depends
on both mass and velocity, so heavier particles move more slowly than lighter particles at
the same kinetic energy. You will also often see this expression written as the following,
which is simply a variation of the equation above and will yield the same result:
Here, Boltzmann’s constant k (1.38 × 10–23 J K–1) replaces the ideal gas constant R, and m, the
mass of an individual gas particle, replaces molar mass M.

Chapter 9: Putting a Finger to the Wind: Gases

The final equation that you may consider useful when calculating the kinetic energy of a
system of molecules is the following expression for the kinetic energy per mole of a gas,
which can be derived by plugging the first expression you were given for the average velocity
of gas particles into the general equation for kinetic energy and solving for kinetic energy per
mole, using this:
KE = 3⁄2RT
Remember to always use R= 8.314 J K–1 mol–1 for these kinetic energy problems. If you use the
wrong units for the gas constant, you will lose points on the AP exam.
Aspiring to Gassy Perfection: 
Ideal Gas Behavior
Like all ideals (the ideal job, the ideal mate, and so on), ideal gases are entirely fictional. All
gas particles occupy some volume. All gas particles have some degree of interparticle attrac-
tion or repulsion. No collision of gas particles is perfectly elastic. But lack of perfection is no
reason to remain unemployed or lonely. Neither is it a reason to abandon kinetic molecular
theory of ideal gases. In this chapter, you will be introduced to a wide variety of applications
of kinetic theory, which come in the form of the so-called “gas laws.”
Relationships between four factors: pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles
are the domain of the gas laws. We take a look at the gas laws in the sections that follow.
Boyle’s Law
The first of these relationships to have been formulated into a law is that between pressure
and volume. Robert Boyle, an Irish gentleman regarded by some as the first chemist (or
“chymist,” as his friends might have said), is typically given credit for noticing that gas pres-
sure and volume have an inverse relationship:
Volume = Constant × (1/Pressure)
This statement is true when the other two factors, temperature and number of particles, are
fixed. Another way to express the same idea is to say that although pressure and volume
may change, they do so in such a way that their product remains constant. So, as a gas
undergoes change in pressure (P) and volume (V) between two states, the following is true:
P1 × V1 = P2 × V2
The relationship makes good sense in light of kinetic molecular theory. At a given tempera-
ture and number of particles, more collisions will occur at smaller volumes. These increased
collisions produce greater pressure. And vice versa. Boyle had some dubious ideas about
alchemy, among other things, but he really struck gold with the pressure-volume relationship
in gases.
86
Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

Charles’s Law
Lest the Irish have all the gassy fun, the French contributed a gas law of their own. History
attributes this law to French chemist Jacques Charles. Charles discovered a direct, linear
relationship between the volume and the temperature of a gas:
Volume = Constant × Temperature
This statement is true when the other two factors, pressure and number of particles, are
fixed. Another way to express the same idea is to say that although temperature and volume
may change, they do so in such a way that their ratio remains constant. So, as a gas under-
goes change in temperature (T) and volume (V) between two states, the following is true:
V1 ÷ T1 = V2 ÷ T2
Not to be outdone by the French, another Irish scientist took Charles’s observations and ran
with them. William Thomson, eventually to be known as Lord Kelvin, took stock of all the
data available in his mid-nineteenth century heyday and noticed a couple of things:
 First, plotting the volume of a gas versus its temperature always produced a straight line.
 Second, extending these various lines caused them all to converge at a single point,
corresponding to a single temperature at zero volume. This temperature — though not
directly accessible in experiments — was about –273 degrees Celsius. Kelvin took the
opportunity to enshrine himself in the annals of scientific history by declaring that
temperature as absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible.
This declaration had at least two immediate benefits. First, it happened to be correct.
Second, it allowed Kelvin to create the Kelvin temperature scale, with absolute zero as the
Official Zero. Using the Kelvin scale (where °C = K + 273), everything makes a whole lot more
sense. For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature of a gas doubles the volume of that gas.
When you work with any gas law involving temperatures, converting Celsius temperatures to
Kelvin is crucial.
The Combined and Ideal Gas Laws
Boyle’s and Charles’s laws are convenient if you happen to find yourself in situations where
only two factors change at a time. However, the universe is rarely so well behaved. What if
pressure, temperature, and volume all change at the same time? Is aspirin and a nap the only
solution? No. Enter the Combined Gas Law:
Of course, the real universe can fight back by changing another variable. In the real universe,
for example, tires spring leaks. In such a situation, gas particles escape the confines of the
tire. This escape decreases the number of particles, n, within the tire. Cranky, tire-iron wield-
ing motorists on the side of the road will attest that decreasing n decreases volume. This
relationship is sometimes expressed as Avogadro’s Law:
Volume = Constant × Number of particles

Chapter 9: Putting a Finger to the Wind: Gases

Combining Avogadro’s Law with the Combined Gas Law produces the wonderfully compre-
hensive relationship:
The final word on ideal gas behavior summarizes all four variables (pressure, temperature,
volume, and number of particles) in one easy-to-use equation called the Ideal Gas Law:
PV = nRT
Here, R is the gas constant, the one quantity of the equation that can’t change. Of course,
the exact identity of this constant depends on the units you are using for pressure, tempera-
ture, and volume. A very common form of the gas constant as used by chemists is 
R = 0.08206L atm K–1 mol–1 (which can also be expressed as 62.4 L torr mol–1 K–1). Alternately,
you may encounter R = 8.314L kPa K–1 mol–1.
Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures
Gases mix. They do so better than liquids and infinitely better than solids. So, what’s the rela-
tionship between the total pressure of a gaseous mixture and the pressure contributions of
the individual gases? Here is a satisfyingly simple answer: Each individual gas within the mix-
ture contributes a partial pressure, and adding the partial pressures yields the total pressure.
Fortunately, because the gases are ideal, the mass of the gas particles does not influence par-
tial pressure. The number of molecules is the only factor that affects partial pressure. This
relationship is summarized by Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, for a mixture of a number of
individual gases:
Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + . . . + Pn
This relationship makes sense if you think about pressure in terms of kinetic molecular theory.
Adding a gaseous sample into a volume that already contains other gases increases the
number of particles in that volume. Because pressure depends on the number of particles col-
liding with the container walls, increasing the number of particles increases the pressure pro-
portionally. Remember, this assumes that the individual gas molecules are behaving ideally.
You can also calculate the partial pressure of an individual gas A in a mixture of gases using
the equation:
PA = Ptotal × XA
Here XA represents the mole fraction of the gas in question, or the number of moles of that
gas divided by the total number of gas moles in the mixture.
Graham’s Law and diffusion
“Wake up and smell the coffee.” This command is usually issued in a scornful tone, but most
people who have awakened to the smell of coffee remember the event fondly. The morning
gift of coffee aroma is made possible by a phenomenon called diffusion. Diffusion is the move-
ment of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
Diffusion occurs spontaneously, on its own. Diffusion leads to mixing, eventually producing
a homogenous mixture in which the concentration of any gaseous component is equal
throughout an entire volume. Of course, that state of complete diffusion is an equilibrium
state; achieving equilibrium can take time.

Different gases diffuse at different rates, depending on their molar masses (see Chapter 7
for details on molar masses). The rates at which two gases diffuse can be compared using
Graham’s Law. Graham’s Law also applies to effusion, the process in which gas molecules
flow through a small hole in a container. Whether gases diffuse or effuse, they do so at a rate
inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass. In other words, more massive
gas molecules diffuse and effuse more slowly than less massive gas molecules. So, for gases
A and B
Getting Real: Nonideal Gas Behavior
Ideal gas equations are idealizations based on the oversimplified assumptions of ideal gas
theory. Real gases, however, do not obey the ideal gas laws. At certain temperatures and
pressures, they provide good approximations, but there are situations when a more sophisti-
cated (and therefore more complicated) equation is needed.
Chemists use a rearranged version of the ideal gas law to determine whether or not they can
use it.
For an ideal gas, n should equal one, so a gas for which the ideal gas law is a good approxi-
mation should have an n value close to one. At high pressures and at low temperatures, this
becomes increasingly unlikely and a new equation is needed.
Assuming that a gas is ideal means assuming that its particles occupy no space and do not
attract one another, but real gas particles defy both of those postulates: They do occupy
space and they do attract one another. At high pressures, this fact becomes increasingly diffi-
cult to ignore because the space between gas particles becomes smaller and smaller and the
assumption is only valid when the space between gas molecules is much greater than the
size of an individual gas molecule. At high temperatures, the internal energy of a gas mole-
cule is great enough to vastly outweigh the attraction to neighboring molecules, but at low
temperatures, hence low kinetic energy, the effect of molecular attraction becomes increas-
ingly significant. In these situations it is necessary to add in a correction for the volume of
molecules and another for intermolecular attractions. These corrections yield a modified
version of the ideal gas law called the van der Waals equation, which is given on the AP
exam, so there is no need to memorize it!
This equation should make it clear why chemists prefer to use the ideal gas law to minimize
necessary computations. Two new constants, called the van der Waals constants, appear in
this equation. The constant a is a measurement of how strongly the gas molecules attract
one another and has units of L2atm mol2. The constant b is a measurement of the volume
occupied by a mole of gas molecules and has units of L mol. These constants vary as the
identity of the gas in question varies. Larger and more complex molecules generally have
larger a and b values because of their greater size and greater propensity to experience inter-
molecular forces, or interactions between molecules.

ling the AP Chemistry exam-style questions later in this chapter. Make sure to attempt the
problems using only your cheat sheet as a reference in the same way you would use your list
of formulas and constants on the real AP exam. 
Doing a Quick Review
Here is a brief outline of the concepts presented in Chapter 9. Review it before attempting the
practice questions and see Chapter 9 for the details of anything you’re still a little rusty on:
 Kinetic theory states that as the temperature of a gas increases, so do the kinetic ener-
gies and velocities of its constituent particles.
 Ideal gases are those for which
• Particle motions are random.
• Particles undergo only translational motion and do not vibrate, spin, or twist.
• Collisions between particles are elastic, meaning that no kinetic energy is
transformed.
• Neighboring gas particles do not exert forces (attraction or repulsion) on one
another.
 The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is KE = 1⁄2mv2, where KE is kinetic energy,
m is mass, and v is velocity. 
 Average particle velocity can be expressed as 
or as 
where u is the average velocity, R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature, M is the
molar mass, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and m is the mass of an individual gas particle.

 The average kinetic energy per mole of a gas is KE = 3⁄2RT, where R is the ideal gas con-
stant and T is the temperature.
 The Gas Laws
• Boyle’s Law: P1×V1 = P2×V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume of
the gas and P2 and V2 are the final
• Charles’ Law: V1÷T1 = V2÷T2. Here again, V1 and T1 are the initial volume and tem-
perature of the gas and V2 and T2 are the final.
• The Combined Gas Law: 
where P1, V1, n1 and T1 are the initial pressure, volume, number of moles and tem-
perature respectively and P2, V2, n2 and T2 are the final
• The Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of
moles, R is the ideal gas constant and T is temperature 
• Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures: Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + . . . + Pn, where P1, P2, P3, etc.
are the partial pressures of different components of the gas mixture 
• Graham’s Law: 
 Chemists use the expression
to determine whether or not a real gas resembles an ideal gas closely enough to use
the ideal gas laws as approximations, which correlates to n values near 1. 
 For gases with n values far from 1, the more complicated expression

Checking Your Work
You’ve done your best. Now check your work. Make sure to read the explanations thoroughly
for any questions you got wrong — or for any you got right by guessing.
1. (D). High pressure gases do not behave ideally because their molecules are too close
together to neglect intermolecular forces.
2. (C). Molecular speeds are proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to mass.
3. (D). Remember that Graham’s Law states that gases effuse at a rate inversely proportional
to the square root of their molar masses. 
4. You are given enough information to find the mole fraction of each gas. Oxygen is 0.3 mol
out of a total of 1.0mol of gas, so its mole fraction is 0.3. Multiply this by the total pressure to
get a partial pressure of 2.4 for oxygen.
5. 153g mol. This is another Graham’s Law problem. You know that the ratio of effusion rates
is 3:1, so the left-hand side of Graham’s Law will be 3. You can also easily calculate the molar
mass of ammonia, which is 17g mol. Plug these values into the equation to get 
Square both sides to get rid of the square root and then multiply both sides by 17 to get
153g mol.
6. (a) 9.83atm. Begin by converting the masses you have been given to moles by dividing by
their molar masses. Make sure to get in the habit of showing your work even on simple calcu-
lations such as these.
Next, add these values to yield the total number of moles of gas (3.95mol). Plug this and your
known values for volume and temperature into the equation P = nRT÷V.
(b) Decrease. Because hydrogen has the lowest molar mass, it will effuse the fastest under
Graham’s Law, so the ratio of hydrogen to the two other gases in the container, which escape
more slowly, will decrease.
7. (a) They are the same. The average kinetic energy per mole of a sample of gas depends on
temperature, and the two gases are at the same temperature.

(b) 0.25atm. This is a simple application of Charles’s Law where V1 = 1.0L, V2 = 0.25L and 
P1 = 1atm. Plug these into the equation to yield
8. 3.8atm. Begin by finding the final pressure of each of the two gases when the entire volume
is made available to them using Boyle’s Law 
P2 of CO2 = P1V1 ÷ V2 = 5.0atm × 10.0L ÷ 15.0L = 3.3atm
P2 of CO = P1V1÷V2 = 1.5atm × 5.0L ÷ 15.0L = 0.5atm
According to Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, the final pressure of this gas mixture will
simply be the sum of these two final pressures.

W
hen asked, young children often report that solids, liquids, and gases are made up of
different kinds of matter. This (mistaken) idea, not usually shared by older people, is
understandable given the striking differences in the properties of these three states. But the
AP chemistry exam leaves no room for charming misconceptions. In this chapter, we dis-
cuss how the properties of the condensed states — liquids and solids — emerge from the
interactions between particles, and how these properties can change as temperature and
pressure change. We also explore the kinds of interactions that occur between particles
within homogenous mixtures called solutions. Like the properties of pure substances, the
properties of solutions depend on the interactions of the particles that make them up.
Restricting Motion: Kinetic Molecular 
Theory of Liquids and Solids
Kinetic theory (as described in greater detail in Chapter 9) explains the properties of matter
in terms of the energetic motions of its particles. Well, not all of the motions. Really, kinetic
theory usually limits itself to a simplified version of matter, one in which infinitely small par-
ticles do nothing but zip around quickly and bump into one another or into the sides of a
container. This description isn’t ever literally true, but is sometimes a very good approxima-
tion of reality, especially for gases in large volumes.
Adding energy to a sample increases its temperature and increases the kinetic energy of
the particles, which means that they move about more quickly and bump into things more
vigorously. Removing energy from a sample (cooling it) has the opposite effect.

When atoms or molecules have less kinetic energy, or when that energy competes with other
effects (like high pressure or strong attractive forces), the matter ceases to be in the diffuse,
gaseous state and comes together into one of the condensed states:
 Liquid: The particles within a liquid are much closer together than those in a gas. As a
result, applying pressure to a liquid does very little to change the volume. The parti-
cles still have an appreciable amount of kinetic energy associated with them, so they
may undergo various kinds of twisting, stretching, and vibrating motions. In addition,
the particles can slide past one another (translate) fairly easily, so liquids are fluid,
though less fluid than gases. Fluid matter assumes the shape of anything that
contains it, as shown in Figure 11-1. The particles of a liquid have short-range order,
meaning that they tend to exhibit some degree of organization over short distances.
 Solid: The state of matter with the least amount of obvious motion is the solid. In a solid,
the particles are packed together quite tightly and undergo almost no long-range transla-
tion. Therefore, solids are not fluid. Matter in the solid state still vibrates in place or
undergoes other types of motion, depending on its temperature (in other words, on its
kinetic energy). The particles of a solid have long-range order, meaning that they tend to
exhibit organization over long distances. However, matter at a certain temperature must
contain a specific amount of energy, regardless of its state. Temperature has no meaning
without motion energy.
The temperatures and pressures at which different types of matter switch between states
depend on the unique properties of the atoms or molecules within that matter. But be care-
ful! It is easy to get fooled by trying to compare different substances at different tempera-
tures. Typically, particles that are very attracted to one another and have easily stackable
shapes tend to be in condensed states (at a fixed temperature). Particles with no mutual
attraction (or that have mutual repulsion) and with not-so-easily stackable shapes tend
toward the gaseous state. Think of a football game between fiercely rival schools. When fans
of either school sit in their own section of the stands, the crowd is orderly, sitting nicely in
rows. Put rival fans into the same section of the stands, however, and they’ll repel each other
with great energy. But be sure you are comparing fans with the same amount of energy. Water
as ice has less energy than as a liquid because it has a lower temperature. Technically if you
could have a mole of water vapor, a mole of liquid water, and a mole of solid water (ice) all at
the same temperature, the water molecules would all have the same kinetic energy!

Getting a Firm Grip on Solids
Solids all have less-apparent motion than their liquid or gaseous counterparts, but that
doesn’t mean all solids are alike. The forces between particles within solids as well as the
degree of order in the packing of particles within solids vary greatly, giving each solid differ-
ent properties. The sections that follow shed some light on both the forces that affect solids
as well as the packing order that helps to determine a solid’s properties.
Different types of solids and their properties
The properties of a solid depend heavily on the forces between the particles within it. The easi-
est property to compare is the melting point — that temperature at which the kinetic energy
overcomes the strong forces of attraction holding the particles vibrating tightly in a solid.
 Several different forces determine different melting points of a solid:
• Ionic solids are held together by an array of very strong ionic bonds (see Chapter 5
for more about these bonds), and, therefore, tend to have high melting points — it
takes a great deal of energy to pull apart the particles.
• Molecular solids consist of packed molecules that are less strongly attractive to
each other, so molecular solids tend to have lower melting points.
• Some solids consist of many particles that are covalently bonded to one another
in an extensive array. These covalent solids tend to be exceptionally strong due to
the strength of their extensive covalent network. One example of a covalent solid
is diamond. Covalent solids have very high melting points. Ever try to melt a dia-
mond? (Chapter 5 has details about covalent bonds.)
 Metallic solids are made up of closely packed metal atoms. These atoms bond to one
another more strongly than the particles of most molecular solids, but less strongly
than the particles of covalent solids. Because metal atoms so easily give up valence
electrons, the atoms within the lattice of a metallic solid seem to exist in a shared “sea”
of mobile electrons. The positively charged metal nuclei are held together by their
attraction to this negatively charged sea. Metallic solids can be be soft or relatively
hard, are ductile and malleable, and are good conductors of heat and electricity. The
orderly array of atoms in many metals can allow “sheets” of atoms to slide over one
another easily, hence the ease with which metals can be made into wires (ductility) or
beaten into thin foils (malleability).
Packing order in solids
The degree of order in the packing of particles within a solid can vary tremendously. How
ordered the particles are within a solid determines how well defined its melting point is. If
the particles are well ordered, then the whole sample tends to melt at the same temperature,
but if different regions of the sample have different degrees of order, then those regions melt
at different temperatures.
 Most solids are highly ordered, packing into neat, repeating patterns called crystals.
The smallest packing unit, the one that repeats over and over to form the crystalline
solid, is called the unit cell. Crystalline solids tend to have well-defined melting points.
The particles in crystalline solids tend to organize themselves into arrangements that
make the most of the attractive forces between them. Usually, this means packing the
particles as closely together as possible. 
99
Chapter 11: Condensing Particles: Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

 Amorphous solids are those solids that lack an ordered packing structure. Glass and
plastic are examples of amorphous solids. Amorphous solids tend to melt over a broad
range of temperatures because some parts of the structures are more easily pulled
apart than others.
When cooling a liquid through a phase transition into a solid, the rate of cooling can have a
significant impact on the properties of the solid. The particles may need time to move into
the extreme order with which they are packed together in crystalline solids. So, substances
that are capable of forming crystalline solids may nevertheless freeze into amporphous
solids if they are cooled rapidly. The particles may become trapped in disordered packing
arrangements. Sometimes this adds considerable strength to a substance, so steels may be
“hardened” by heating and sudden cooling.
A collection of different types of forces is very important in determining liquid-solid phase
behavior. These forces are more important for the liquid-solid phase than in gases because
liquids and solids are condensed states; the molecules within these states are in very
close proximity.
In molecular solids, dipole-dipole forces, London dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds play
prominent roles (see Figure 11-2). At the same time, these forces are relatively weak com-
pared to those that dominate in other kinds of solids. Because of the weakness of these
forces, molecular solids are relatively soft and tend to have much lower melting points than
other solids. In the list below, we describe how these forces work.
Forces at work in condensed states
The forces at work between the particles in a solid (or liquid) largely determine the proper-
ties of the substance. For the AP exam, you should definitely know each of the kinds of forces
at work in solids and liquids, and be able to predict which forces are most important within a
sample of a given compound. These forces include relatively weaker forces (dipole-dipole,
London dispersion, and hydrogen bonding) and relatively stronger forces (ionic and covalent
bonds).
Here are the intermolecular forces you should know:
 Dipole-dipole forces (see Figure 11-2) take place between molecules with permanent
dipoles (separated regions of opposite charge). Oppositely charged parts of different
molecules attract and regions with same type of charge repel. These forces tend to
order the molecules.
 London dispersion forces (shown in Figure 11-2) take place when the positively charged
nucleus of one atom attracts the electron cloud of another atom while the electron clouds
of both atoms mutually repel one another. In other words, the two atoms induce dipoles
in each other, and these induced dipoles (temporary dipoles created by the nearness of
electron clouds) attract one another. It is more easy to redistribute the electrons of some
molecules into an induced dipole than it is with others. In other words, some molecules
are more polarizable (capable of having their electrons redistributed) than others.
Polarizable molecules tend to take part more strongly in London dispersion forces.
 Hydrogen bonds are specific kinds of dipole-dipole attractions that take place between
a hydrogen atom in a polar bond and a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative
atom (see Chapter 5 for a refresher on electronegativity). Because it participates in a
polar bond, the hydrogen has a partial positive charge, δ+. Because it is electronega-
tive, the atom that contributes the lone pair has a partial negative charge, δ–. These
partial charges attract. Hydrogen atoms that bond with fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen
are particularly prone to engage in hydrogen bonds. When these interactions take
place between molecules, they significantly increase melting and freezing points. Water
hydrogen bonds avidly to itself and to other molecules, as shown in Figure 11-2.
100
Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

In addition to the relatively weak forces described above, ionic and covalent bonds
(discussed in detail in Chapter 5) are strong forces that greatly affect the melting point
of a compound: 
 In ionic solids, ionic bonds (electrostatic interactions) provide a major source of
attraction between particles. These types of solids tend to be hard but brittle (the
ionic lattice can crack) and have very high melting points. Lattice energy is a measure
of the strength of the interactions between ions in the lattice of an ionic solid. The
larger the lattice energy, the stronger the ion-ion interactions. 
 In covalent solids, particles are bound to each other within strong networks of covalent
bonds. These solids are often exceptionally hard and have very high melting points.
Moving Through States with Phase Diagrams
The previous sections described how microscopic interactions between particles can lead to
large-scale differences in the properties of a sample, especially by causing the sample to be
in different states (solid, liquid, or gas). This section describes some tools you can use to
track the state of a sample as it moves through different regions of temperature, pressure, or
added heat energy. 
Phases and phase diagrams
Each state (solid, liquid, gas) is called a phase. When matter moves from one phase to another
due to changes in temperature and/or pressure, that matter is said to undergo a phase transi-
tion. The way a particular substance moves through states as temperature and pressure vary is
summarized by a phase diagram. Phase diagrams usually display pressure on the vertical axis
and temperature on the horizontal axis. Lines drawn within the temperature-pressure field of
the diagram represent the equilibrium boundaries between phases. A representative phase dia-
gram is shown in Figure 11-3. Refer back to this figure as you read through the section.
Moving from liquid to gas is called boiling, and the temperature at which boiling occurs is
called the boiling point. The normal boiling point is when this transition occurs at 1 atmos-
phere of pressure. Moving from solid to liquid is called melting, and the temperature at which
melting occurs is called the melting point. The melting point temperature is the same as the
freezing point temperature, but freezing implies matter moving from liquid to solid phase.
The melting point a substance has at 1atm pressure is called the normal melting point. Just
as freezing and melting points are the same, condensation points and boiling points are the
same temperature. For this reason published tables are of freezing points and boiling points.

Chapter 11: Condensing Particles: Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

At the surface of a liquid, molecules can enter the gas phase more easily than elsewhere
within the liquid because the motions of those molecules aren’t as constrained by the mole-
cules around them. So, these surface molecules can enter the gas phase at temperatures
below the liquid’s characteristic boiling point. This low-temperature phase change is called
evaporation and is very sensitive to pressure. Low pressures allow for greater evaporation,
while high pressures encourage molecules to re-enter the liquid phase in a process called
condensation. The pressure of the gas over the surface of a liquid is called the vapor pressure.
It is important not to confuse this with atmospheric pressure due to other gases in the air.
For example a sample of liquid water at 20°C has a vapor pressure of 0.023atm while the
atmosphere has a pressure of 1.0atm. Understandably, liquids with low boiling points tend
to have high vapor pressures; particles in liquids with low boiling points are weakly attracted
to each other. At the surface of a liquid, weakly interacting particles have more of a chance to
escape into vapor phase, thereby increasing the vapor pressure. See how kinetic theory
helps make sense of things?
In addition to having high vapor pressure and low boiling points, substances with weakly
interacting molecules tend to have low surface tension and low cohesion. Surface tension is a
measure of the amount of energy it takes to spread out a substance over a larger surface; the
weaker the interactions between molecules, the easier this is to do. Cohesion is the tendency
of the molecules of a substance to attract one another. Adhesion is the tendency of those
molecules to bond to the molecules of another substance. Substances that are both adhesive
and cohesive display capillary action, the ability to pull themselves through narrow tubes.
At the right combination of pressure and temperature, matter can move directly from solid
to a gas or vapor. This type of phase change is called sublimation, and is the kind of phase
change responsible for the white mist that emanates from dry ice, the common name for
solid carbon dioxide. Movement in the opposite direction, from gas directly into solid phase,
is called deposition.
For any given type of matter there is a unique combination of pressure and temperature at
the nexus of all three states. This pressure-temperature combination is called the triple point.
At the triple point, all three phases coexist. In the case of good old H2O, going to the triple
point produces ice-water vapor. Take a moment to bask in the weirdness.

Other weird phases include the following:
 Plasma is a gaslike state in which electrons pop off gaseous atoms to produce a mix-
ture of free electrons and cations (which are atoms or molecules with positive charge).
For most types of matter, achieving the plasma state requires very high temperatures,
very low pressures, or both. Matter at the surface of the sun, for example, exists as
plasma.
 Supercritical fluids (SCF) exist under high temperature-high pressure conditions. For
a given type of matter, there is a unique combination of temperature and pressure
called the critical point. At temperatures and pressures higher than those at this point,
the phase boundary between liquid and gas disappears, and the matter exists as a kind
of liquidy gas or gassy liquid. Supercritical fluids can diffuse through solids like gases
do, but can also dissolve things like liquids do. SCFs are being used in some areas as
extraction agents in dry cleaning.
Changing phase and temperature along
heating curves
Starting from the solid phase, you can add heat energy to a sample, causing it to progress
through liquid and vapor phases. If you measure the temperature of the sample as you do
this, you’ll find that it has a staircase pattern. This pattern is called a heating curve, and
results from the fact that it takes energy simply to move particles from solid to liquid and
from liquid to vapor (moving in the opposite direction releases energy). When a substance is
at its melting point or freezing point, added heat energy goes toward disrupting attractive
forces between the molecules instead of increasing the temperature (the average kinetic
energy) of the molecules. Like phase diagrams, the exact shape of a heating curve varies
from one substance to another. The heating curve for water is shown in Figure 11-4. Heating
curves usually assume a constant rate of energy input.

Dissolving with Distinction: Solubility
and Types of Solutions
Compounds can form mixtures. When compounds mix completely, right down to the level of
individual molecules, we call the mixture a solution. Each type of compound in a solution is
called a component. The component of which there is the most is usually called the solvent.
The other components are called solutes. Although most people think “liquid” when they
think of solutions, a solution can be a solid, liquid, or gas. The only criterion is that the com-
ponents are completely intermixed. We explain what you need to know in this section. By far
the most important solutions (99% on the AP exam) are those where water is the solvent.
Master those before worrying about other solutions.
Forces in solvation
For gases, forming a solution is a straightforward process. Gases simply diffuse into a common
volume (see Chapter 9 for more about diffusion). Things are a bit more complicated for con-
densed states like liquids and solids. In liquids and solids, molecules or ions are crammed so
closely together that intermolecular forces (forces between molecules) are very important.
Examples of these kinds of forces include dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, and London disper-
sion forces as discussed previously. In addition, ion-dipole forces can be important in solutions,
as shown for water in Figure 11-5.
Introducing a solute into a solvent initiates a tournament of forces. Attractive forces between
solute and solvent compete with attractive solute-solute and solvent-solvent forces, as
depicted in Figure 11-6. A solution forms only to the extent that solute-solvent forces domi-
nate over the others. The process in which solvent molecules compete and win in the tourna-
ment of forces is called solvation or, in the specific case where water is the solvent, hydration.
Solvated solutes are surrounded by solvent molecules. When solute ions or molecules
become separated from one another and surrounded in this way, we say they are dissolved.
Imagine that the members of a ridiculously popular band exit their hotel to be greeted by an
assembled throng of fans and the media. The band members attempt to cling to each other,
but are soon overwhelmed by the crowd’s ceaseless, repeated attempts to get closer. Soon,
each member of the band is surrounded by his own attending shell of reporters and hyper-
ventilating fans. So it is with dissolution.

Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

The tournament of forces plays out differently among different combinations of components.
In mixtures where solute and solvent are strongly attracted to one another, more solute can
be dissolved. One factor that always tends to favor solvation is entropy, a kind of disorder or
“randomness” within a system. Dissolved solutes are less ordered than undissolved solutes.
Beyond a certain point, however, adding more solute to a solution doesn’t result in a greater
amount of solvation. At this point, the solution is in dynamic equilibrium; the rate at which
solute becomes solvated equals the rate at which dissolved solute crystallizes, or falls out of
solution. A solution in this state is saturated. By contrast, an unsaturated solution is one that
can accommodate more solute. A supersaturated solution is a temporary one in which more
solute is dissolved than is necessary to make a saturated solution. A supersaturated solution
is unstable; solute molecules may crash out of solution given the slightest perturbation. The
situation is like that of Wile E. Coyote, who runs off a cliff and remains suspended in the air
until he looks down — at which point he inevitably falls.
To dissolve or not to dissolve: Solubility
The concentration of solute (the amount of solute relative to the amount of solvent or the
total amount of solution) required to make a saturated solution is the solubility of that solute.
Solubility varies with the conditions of the solution. The same solute may have different solu-
bility in different solvents, and at different temperatures, and so on.
When one liquid is added to another, the extent to which they intermix is called miscibility.
Typically, liquids that have similar properties mix well — they are miscible. Liquids with dis-
similar properties often don’t mix well — they are immiscible. This pattern is summarized by
the phrase, “like dissolves like.” Alternately, you may understand lack of miscibility in terms of
the Italian Salad Dressing Principle. Inspect a bottle of Italian salad dressing that has been sit-
ting in your refrigerator. Observe the following: The dressing consists of two distinct layers,
an oily layer and a watery layer. Before using, you must shake the bottle to temporarily mix
the layers. Eventually, they will separate again because water is polar and oil is nonpolar.

(See Chapter 5 if the distinction between polar and nonpolar is lost on you.) Polar and non-
polar liquids mix poorly, though occasionally with positive gastronomic consequences.
Similarity or difference in polarity between components is often a good predictor of solubil-
ity, regardless of whether those components are liquid, solid, or gas. This rule is often
described as “like dissolves like.” Why is polarity such a good predictor? Because polarity is
central to the tournament of forces that underlies solubility. So, solids held together by ionic
bonds (the most polar type of bond) or polar covalent bonds tend to dissolve well in polar
solvents, like water. For a refresher on ionic and covalent bonding, visit Chapter 5.
Heat effects on solubility
Increasing temperature magnifies the effects of entropy on a system. Because the entropy
of a solute is usually increased when it dissolves, increasing temperature usually increases
solubility — for solid and liquid solutes, anyway. Another way to understand the effect of
temperature on solubility is to think about heat as a reactant in the dissolution reaction:
Solid solute + solvent + heat →Dissolved solute
Heat is usually absorbed when a solute dissolves. Increasing temperature corresponds to
added heat. So, by increasing temperature you supply a needed reactant in the dissolution
reaction. (In those rare cases where dissolution releases heat, increasing temperature can
decrease solubility.) NaCl is an example where the solubility changes very little with temper-
ature change. 
Gaseous solutes behave differently than do solid or liquid solutes with respect to tempera-
ture. Increasing the temperature tends to decrease the solubility of gas in liquid. To under-
stand this pattern, recall the concept of vapor pressure from earlier in the chapter.
Increasing temperature increases vapor pressure because added heat increases the kinetic
energy of the particles in solution. With added energy, these particles stand a greater chance
of breaking free from the intermolecular forces that hold them in solution. A classic, real-life
example of temperature’s effect on gas solubility is carbonated soda. Which goes flat (loses
its dissolved carbon dioxide gas) more quickly: warm soda or cold soda?
Pressure effects on gas solubility
The comparison of gas solubility in liquids with the concept of vapor pressure highlights
another important pattern: Increasing pressure increases the solubility of a gas in liquid. Just
as high pressures make it more difficult for surface-dwelling liquid molecules to escape into
vapor phase, high pressures inhibit the escape of gases dissolved in solvent, as highlighted
by Figure 11-7. The relationship between pressure and gas solubility is summarized by
Henry’s law:
SA = k × PA
where SA is the solubility of A, PA is the partial pressure of A in the vapor over the solution,
and k is Henry’s constant. The value of Henry’s constant depends on the gas, solvent, and
temperature, and is accurate for small concentrations of solute. A particularly useful form of
Henry’s law relates the change in solubility (S) that accompanies a change in pressure (P)
between two different states:
S1 / P1 = S2 / P2
According to this relationship, tripling the pressure triples the gas solubility, for example.

Measuring solute concentration
It seems that different solutes dissolve to different extents in different solvents in different
conditions. How can anybody keep track of all these differences? Chemists do so by measur-
ing concentration. Qualitatively, a solution with a large amount of solute is said to be concen-
trated. A solution with only a small amount of solute is said to be dilute. As you may suspect,
simply describing a solution as concentrated or dilute is usually about as useful as calling it
“pretty” or naming it “Fifi.” We need numbers. Two important ways to measure concentration
are molarity and percent solution.
Molarity relates the amount of solute to the volume of the solution:
In order to calculate molarity, you may have to use conversion factors to move between
units. For example, if you are given the mass of a solute in grams, use the molar mass of that
solute to convert the given mass into moles. If you are given the volume of solution in cm3 or
some other unit, you’ll need to convert that volume into liters.
The units of molarity are always mol L–1. These units are often abbreviated as M and referred
to as “molar.” Thus, 0.25M KOH(aq) is described as “Point two-five molar potassium hydrox-
ide” and contains 0.25 moles of KOH per liter of solution. Note that this does not mean that
there are 0.25 moles KOH per liter of solvent (water, in this case) — only the final volume of
the solution (solute plus solvent) is important in molarity. Why? Because often volumes just
don’t add up when two substances are mixed. (It is kinetic theory again!) Molar concentra-
tions of a substance are often denoted by brackets, as in [KOH] = 0.25. Like other units, the
unit of molarity can be modified by standard prefixes, as in millimolar (mM, 10–3 mol L–1) and
micromolar (µM, 10–6 mol L–1).
One important quantity that is measured in units of molarity is the solubility product constant,
Ksp. The solubility product is useful for measuring the dynamic equilibrium of ionic com-
pounds in any given solvent. Once a saturated solution of the compound has been made, fur-
ther addition of that compound has no effect on the concentration of dissolved solute. The
concentrations of the component ions of the compound therefore remain constant and

reflect the characteristic solubility of the compound in that solvent. The Ksp measures this
solubility. For the the ionic compound XAYB,
Ksp = [X]A × [Y]B
Percent solution is another common way to express concentration. The precise units of per-
cent solution typically depend on the phase of each component. For solids dissolved in liq-
uids, mass percent is usually used:
This kind of measurement is sometimes called a mass-mass percent solution because one mass
is divided by another. Very dilute concentrations (as in the concentration of a contaminant in
drinking water) are sometimes expressed as a special mass percent called parts per million
(ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). In these metrics, the mass of the solute is divided by the total
mass of the solution, and the resulting fraction is multiplied by 106 (ppm) or by 109 (ppb).
Clearly, it’s important to pay attention to units when working with concentration. Only by
observing which units are attached to a measurement can you determine whether you are
working with molarity, mass percent, or with mass-mass, mass-volume, or volume-volume
percent solution.
Real-life chemists in real-life labs don’t make every solution from scratch. Instead, they make
concentrated stock solutions (starting solutions) and then make dilutions (solutions in which
solvent is added to stock solution) of those stocks as necessary for a given experiment.
To make a dilution, you simply add a small quantity of a concentrated stock solution to an
amount of pure solvent. The resulting solution contains the amount of solute originally taken
from the stock solution, but disperses that solute throughout a greater volume. So, the final
concentration is lower; the final solution is less concentrated and more dilute.
But how do you know how much of the stock solution to use, and how much of the pure sol-
vent to use? It depends on the concentration of the stock and on the concentration and
volume of the final solution you want. You can answer these kinds of pressing questions by
using the dilution equation, which relates concentration (C) and volume (V) between initial
and final states:
C1 × V1 = C2 × V2
This equation can be used with any units of concentration, provided the same units are used
throughout the calculation. Because molarity is such a common way to express concentra-
tion, the dilution equation is sometimes expressed in the following way, where M1 and M2
refer to the initial and final molarity, respectively:
M1 × V1 = M2 × V2
Dissolving with Perfection: Ideal Solutions
and Colligative Properties
If you’ve read the rest of this chapter, you may consider yourself a recently minted expert in
solubility and molarity, ready to write off solutions as another chemistry topic mastered.
Don’t. You, as a chemist worth your salt, must be aware of another piece to the puzzle:
colligative properties. Colligative properties are the properties of a solution compared to a

pure solvent that change as a function of the number of solute particles in solution, regard-
less of what kind of particles. The presence of extra particles in a formerly pure solvent has a
significant impact on some of that solvent’s characteristic properties, such as vapor pres-
sure, freezing point, and boiling point.
Understanding ideal solutions
Understanding how solute particles affect the properties of a solution requires you to know
first whether you’re dealing with an “ideal solution.” An ideal solution is one in which proper-
ties change proportionally (that is, in a linear way) with the amount of added solute.
Thankfully, only ideal solutions are on the AP test! 
Two kinds of solutions tend to approach ideal behavior:
 Very dilute solutions
 Solutions in which solute-solvent interactions are about the same strength as solvent-
solvent and solute-solute interactions
Ideal solutions obey Raoult’s law. Raoult’s law states that the vapor pressure over the surface
of an ideal solution should be the sum of the vapor pressures of the pure components multi-
pled by their mole fraction in the solution. In other words, each solution component should
contribute exactly its fair share to the total vapor pressure, no more, no less. For a two-
component solution
Ptotal = PA × XA + PB × XB
where Ptotal is the total vapor pressure over the solution, PA and PB are the vapor pressures of
pure samples of components A and B, and XA and XB are the mole fractions of components A
and B in the solution.
Mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of one component in a solution to the
number of moles of all the components in the solution. 
In general, the mole fractions of a two-component solution are expressed as
where nA is the number of moles of component A (like a solute) and nB is the number of
moles of component B (like a solvent).
Raoult’s law makes a prediction: If you add a nonvolatile solute (one that contributes no
vapor pressure of its own) to a solvent, the vapor pressure of the resulting solution should
be lower than the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. If you’ve got a solution that seems to
obey Raoult’s law, then you’ve got a solution for which you can make useful predictions
about colligative properties.
Using molality to predict colligative properties
To correctly account for the effects of solute particles on some colligative properties, you
need a new way to measure solution concentration: molality. No, that’s not a typo. Molality is
different from molarity.

Chapter 11: Condensing Particles: Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

Like the difference in their names, the difference between molarity and molality is subtle.
Whereas molarity measures the moles of solute per liter of solution, molality measures the
moles of solute particles per kilogram of solvent:
Notice that the numerator of the fraction for calculating molality includes “solute particles”
and not just “solute.” What’s the difference? When one mole of the ionic compound NaCl dis-
solves into one liter of aqueous solution, it produces 1 molar sodium chloride, 1M NaCl(aq).
But when NaCl dissolves, it becomes one mole of Na+ cation and one mole of Cl– anion — two
moles of solute particles. So, when one mole of NaCl dissolves into one kilogram of water, it
produces 2 molal sodium chloride, 2m NaCl(aq).
Calculating molality is no more or less difficult than calculating molarity, so you may be
asking yourself, “Why all the fuss?” Is it even worth adding another quantity and another
variable to memorize? Yes! Although molarity is exceptionally convenient for calculating con-
centrations and working out how to make dilutions in the most efficient way, molality is
useful for predicting important colligative properties, including the boiling point of a solu-
tion. When solute particles are added to a solvent, the boiling point of the resulting solution
tends to increase relative to the boiling point of the pure solvent. This phenomenon is called
boiling point elevation. The more solute you add, the greater you elevate the boiling point.
Boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molality of a solution, but chemists
have found that some solvents are more susceptible to this change than others. The formula
for the change in the boiling point (Tb) of a solution therefore contains a proportionality con-
stant, Kb (not to be confused with an equilibrium constant!). The Kb is determined by experi-
ment and in practice you usually look it up in a table such as Table 11-1. The formula for the
boiling point elevation is 
∆Tb = Kb × m
Note the use of the Greek letter delta (∆) in the formula to indicate that you are calculating a
change in boiling point, not the boiling point itself. You’ll need to add this number to the boil-
ing point of the pure solvent to get the boiling point of the solution. The units of Kb are given
in degrees Celsius per molality (°C m–1).

Boiling point elevations are a result of the attraction between solvent and solute particles in
a solution. Adding solute particles increases these intermolecular attractions because there
are more particles around to attract one another. Solvent particles must therefore achieve a
greater kinetic energy to overcome this extra attractive force and boil off the surface. Greater
kinetic energy means a higher temperature, and therefore a higher boiling point. An alterna-
tive explanation is that there are simply fewer solvent molecules on the surface to escape as
some surface locations are occupied by solute particles.
The second of the important colligative properties you can calculate by using molality is the
freezing point (Tf) of a solution. When solute particles are added to a solvent, the freezing
point of the solution tends to decrease relative to that of the pure solvent. This phenomenon
is called freezing point depression. The more solute you add, the more you decrease the freez-
ing point. This is the reason, for example, that you sprinkle salt on icy sidewalks. The salt
mixes with the ice and lowers its freezing point. If this new freezing point is lower than the
outside temperature, the ice melts, eliminating the spectacular wipeouts so common on salt-
free sidewalks. The colder it is outside, the more salt is needed to melt the ice and lower the
freezing point to below the ambient temperature.
Like boiling point elevation, freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molality of
the solution. So, the formula for freezing point depression contains a constant of proportional-
ity, Kf, that depends on the solvent in question. The formula for freezing point depression is
Tf = Kf × m
To calculate the new freezing point of a compound, you must subtract the change in freezing
point from the freezing point of the pure solvent. Table 11-2 lists several common Kf values.

Freezing point depressions are the result of solute particles interrupting the crystalline order
of a frozen solid. In order to reach a solid, frozen state, the solution must achieve an even
lower average kinetic energy. Lower kinetic energy means lower temperature, and therefore
a lower freezing point.
In summary, adding solute particles to a solvent increases the stability of the liquid phase.
Boiling point elevation and freezing point depression mean that greater changes in energy
are required to shift the solution out of liquid phase into solid or vapor phase. This effect can
be seen in a phase diagram that overlays the behavior of a solution with that of the pure sol-
vent, as shown in Figure 11-8.
111
Chapter 11: Condensing Particles: Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

By carefully measuring boiling point elevations and freezing point depressions, you can
determine the molar mass of a mystery compound that is added to a known quantity of sol-
vent. To pull off this trick you must know the total mass of the pile of mystery solute that has
been dissolved, the mass of solvent into which the compound was dissolved, and either the
change in the freezing or boiling point or the new freezing or boiling point itself. From this
information you then follow this set of simple steps to determine the molecular mass:
1. If you know the boiling point of the solution, calculate the ∆Tb by subtracting the boil-
ing point of the pure solvent from that value. If you know the freezing point of the
solution, subtract the freezing point of the pure solvent to that value to get the ∆Tf. 
2. Look up the Kb or Kf of the solvent (in a place like Table 11-1 or 11-2).
3. Solve for the molality of the solution using the equation for ∆Tb or ∆Tf.
4. Calculate the number of moles of solute in the solution by multiplying the molality
calculated in Step 3 by the mass of solvent, in kilograms. 
5. Divide the mass of the pile of mystery solute that has been dissolved by the number
of moles calculated in Step 4. The result of this calculation is the molar mass
(number of grams per mole) of the mystery compound. From this value, you can
often make an educated guess about the identity of the compound.
Osmotic pressure is another property of a solution that depends on the number of solute par-
ticles. To understand osmotic pressure, it helps to understand osmosis, the movement of sol-
vent molecules through a semipermeable barrier (one which lets some things pass, but not
others) from areas of low solute concentration to areas of high solute concentration.
Osmosis is a result of the more general process of diffusion, the net movement of a substance
from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. In solutions with higher
solute concentration, solvent is less concentrated. In solutions with lower solute concentra-
tion, solvent is more concentrated. So, given the opportunity, solvent diffuses toward solu-
tions with higher solute concentration.

Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

If solvent and a solution made with that solvent are separated by a semipermeable mem-
brane in a setup like the one shown in Figure 11-9, solvent molecules will move by osmosis
into the solute-containing chamber. This movement of solute will alter the surface height
within each chamber until the difference in height causes enough pressure to prevent a fur-
ther net movement of solvent into the solute-containing chamber. This pressure difference is
equal to the osmotic pressure, Π, of the solution. Osmotic pressure depends on the moles of
solute particles per unit volume of solution; that is, in contrast to boiling points and freezing
points, osmotic pressure depends on molarity, not molality:
where nsolute is the moles of solute particles, Vsolution is the volume of solution, M is molarity of
particles, R is the gas constant and T is temperature.
Osmosis and osmotic pressure are important in biology because cell membranes are semi-
permeable, allowing transport of solvent water molecules while restricting transport of many
solutes. So, if a cell finds itself in a hypertonic environment (one with higher solute concentra-
tion than that of the cell), osmosis may cause the cell to shrivel as water diffuses outward.
If the cell finds itself in a hypotonic environment (one with lower solute concentration than
that of the cell), osmosis may cause the cell to swell (or explode!) as water diffuses inward.
So, even if you yawn at osmotic pressure, the cells that compose you consider it a life-or-
death kind of thing.
Dissolving with Reality: Nonideal Solutions
Many solutions come very close to ideal behavior. But some solutions deviate pretty signifi-
cantly from ideal behavior. And for sensitive applications, sometimes even very close isn’t
close enough. Situations like these force us to deal with nonideal solutions, ones that don’t
obey Raoult’s law or Henry’s law, and whose properties aren’t proportional to the amount of
added solute.

Chapter 11: Condensing Particles: Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

Nonideal solutions occur when solute concentrations are very high and/or when solute-solvent
interactions are significantly more attractive or repulsive than solute-solute interactions and
solvent-solvent interactions.
 When solute-solvent interactions are especially attractive, the solute is effectively
more dissolved (that is, more intermixed) than an ideal solute. The vapor pressure of
the solvent is lower than predicted by Raoult’s law. The partial pressure of a dilute
solute is higher than that predicted by Henry’s law.
 When solute-solvent interactions are especially repulsive, the solute is effectively
less intermixed than an ideal solute. The vapor pressure of the solution is higher than
predicted by Raoult’s law. The partial pressure of a dilute solute is lower than that pre-
dicted by Henry’s law.
To account for nonideal behavior, chemists use the concept of activity, the effective concen-
tration of a component in solution. When the activity of a component differs significantly
from its formal concentration, chemists often use an experimentally determined activity
coefficient in their calculations. The concentration of the nonideal component (its molarity,
molality or mole fraction) is multiplied by an activity coefficient, γ, to produce an effective
concentration for the calculation:
Activity = γ × Concentration

hapter 11 describes the different kinds of interactions between particles within differ-
ent phases of matter and how changes in temperature and pressure can cause matter
to move between phases. Chapter 11 also explores solutions — what they are, how to meas-
ure their concentration, and how their behavior changes with added solute. Just to be cer-
tain you remember the key points of Chapter 11, we’ve included those important concepts
for you to review in this chapter before you take a stab at answering questions about solids,
liquids, and solutions. 
Getting a Grip on What Not to Forget
Here is a collection of the most important points to remember for the AP exam about how
particles behave in different states of matter, how samples move between states, and how
solute particles interact with solvent within solutions. 
Kinetic theory
Just as kinetic theory can explain gas behavior, the following list shows how kinetic theory
can also help explain the properties and behavior of the condensed states — liquids and
solids, in case you haven’t read Chapter 11: 
 Particles within liquids are close together, but can slide past one another (that is,
translate), so that liquids are fluid, meaning liquids have short-range order.
 Particles within a solid cannot translate past one another, but vibrate about an average
position. So solids have long-range order.
 In condensed states, interparticle attractions and repulsions are critical in determining
the properties of the substance.

Solid states
Solid states include several categories with distinct characteristics:
 The particles within ionic solids are strongly attracted to one another, and these solids
have high melting points. Lattice energy measures the strength of the ion-ion inter-
actions within these solids.
 Molecular solids have weaker attractions between particles and typically have lower
melting points.
 Covalent (network) solids are bound together by multiple covalent bonds and tend to
be exceptionally strong.
 Metallic solids consist of a lattice of positively charged atoms within a sea of mobile
electrons coming from valence shells, which accounts for the high electrical conductiv-
ity of metals.
 Particles within crystalline solids pack into highly ordered arrangements of a repeating
unit cell and tend to have well-defined melting temperatures. Particles within amorphous
solids exhibit far less long-range order and tend to melt over broad temperature ranges.
Condensed states
Within condensed states, a collection of “weak” forces (that is generally, but not always,
weaker than covalent or ionic bonds) can play important roles:
 Hydrogen bonds can occur when two electronegative atoms (like oxygen, nitrogen, or
fluorine) essentially “share” an electropositive hydrogen atom. Formally, the hydrogen
is covalently bound to one of the electronegative atoms.
 Dipole-dipole forces can occur between the partially charged parts of polar molecules.
Opposite partial charges attract and same-sign partial charges repel. Dipoles can also
interact with ions according the the same basic concept.
 London dispersion forces are attractive forces that are generally weaker than hydrogen
bonds, dipole-dipole, and ion-dipole forces at long distances. London forces occur
between induced dipoles, partial charges that flicker into and out of existence as elec-
tron clouds interact with one another.
Phase diagrams
Phase diagrams reveal the effects of temperature and pressure on the phase (physical state)
of a substance. The following list describes how to interpret the diagrams:
 A field of the phase diagram represents boundaries between phases. Crossing a line
indicates a phase change, such as melting, freezing, boiling, condensing, subliming, or
desubliming (depositing).
 The triple point represents a substance-specific combination of temperature and pres-
sure at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases of a substance coexist.
 At very high temperatures and/or very low pressures, gases can move into plasma
phase, in which ionized particles intermingle with free electrons.
 At temperatures and pressures above a substance-specific condition called the critical
point, the distinction between liquid and gas phase disappears. A substance in this con-
dition is called a supercritical fluid.
116
Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

 Heating curves show how the temperature of a substance varies as heat is added to it.
These curves tend to exhibit a staircase-pattern in which temperature increases as
heat is added at a constant rate, and then levels off during phase changes because heat
must be added simply to shift the substance from one phase to another.
Solutions
Solutions are mixtures in which different components are completely and evenly mixed down
to the level of individual molecules, ions, or atoms. 
 The major component of a solution is the solvent. Minor components are solutes.
 Substances dissolve if and when solvent-solute attractions dominate over solvent-sol-
vent and solute-solute attractions.
 Saturated solutions are those that hold the maximum amount of a dissolved solute.
Unsaturated solutions can accommodate further solute additions.
 The solubility of a solute is the concentration of the substance required to produce a
saturated solution. So, substances with large solubility can be dissolved to a large
degree, while smaller amounts of substances with low solubility will dissolve.
 Solubility can vary in the following ways, depending on temperature, pressure, and the
physical/chemical properties (especially polarity) of the solute and solvent:
• Increasing temperature increases the solubility of most (but not all) solid solutes
in liquid solutions.
• Increasing temperature decreases the solubility of gases in liquid solutions.
• Increasing pressure increases the solubility of gases in liquid solutions, as
expressed by Henry’s law: S1 / P1 = S2 / P2.
• Polar solutes dissolve best in polar solvents. Nonpolar solutes dissolve best in
nonpolar solvents. In other words, “like dissolves like.”
Ideal solutions have some important points to remember:
 Ideal solutions obey Raoult’s law. This law states that in the vapor over a liquid solu-
tion, each solution component should have a partial pressure in proportion to its mole
fraction within the solution. Raoult’s law implies that adding a solute to a solvent
should reduce the partial pressure of the solvent within the vapor over the solution.
 In ideal solutions (those which are dilute and in which all intermolecular forces are
about the same strength), adding solute particles has predictable effects on colligative
properties like boiling point, freezing point, and osmotic pressure. Most AP questions
involve only nonvolatile solutes — those that have essentially no vapor pressure of
their own to add to that of the solvent. Thus only the solvent properties are affected.
• Adding solute particles raises the boiling point of a solvent in a phenomenon
called boiling point elevation: ∆Tb = Kb × m.
• Adding solute particles lowers the freezing point of a solvent in a phenomenon
called freezing point depression: ∆Tf = Kf × m.
• Adding solute particles increases the osmotic pressure, π, of a solution.
Many real-life solutions are nonideal solutions, especially at high concentrations or when
one kind of intermolecular force dominates over others in solution. (Fortunately, AP exami-
nations never ask about these.) We give you examples of some nonideal solution effects in
the following list:
 Strong solute-solvent interactions lead to vapor pressures lower than those predicted
by Raoult’s law.
117
Chapter 12: Answering Questions on Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

 Weak solute-solvent interactions lead to vapor pressures higher than those predicted
by Raoult’s law.
 The activity coefficient, γ, is used to correct for nonideal solution effects on solute con-
centration: Activity = γ × Concentration.
More concentrated solutions can be diluted with solvent to yield less-concentrated solu-
tions, as expressed by the dilution equation: C1 × V1 = C2 × V2.
Reporting the concentration of a solute
Different methods for reporting the concentration of a solute include molarity, molality, per-
cent solution, mole fraction, and partial pressure. The following list reminds you how those
methods are expressed:
 Molarity: M = moles solute / liters solution
 Molality: m = moles solute particles / kilograms solution
 Percent solution can refer to mass percent, volume percent, or mass/volume percent:
• Mass % = 100% × (mass solute / total mass solution)

1. (B). The melting/freezing equilibrium occurs at the boundary line between solid and liquid
phases. Although different substances have differently shaped phase diagrams, it is typically
the case that low temperature–high pressure conditions favor solid phase; high temperature–
low pressure conditions favor gas phase; and liquid phases occur at intermediate tempera-
tures and pressures.
2. (B). Homogenous phases are those that are uniform throughout and not in equilibrium
between multiple phases. So, on a phase diagram, homogenous phases are found in the open
spaces between phase boundary lines.
3. (E). Sublimation is direct movement from solid to gas phase, and deposition is the reverse
of that process. So, a sublimation/deposition equilibrium occurs at the boundary line
between solid and gas phases.
4. (C). The critical point for a substance is the unque combination of pressure and tempera-
ture beyond which liquid and gas phases cease to be distinct. Any combination of tempera-
ture and pressure that is simultaneously above both the critical temperature and critical
pressure causes the substance to become a supercritical fluid.
5. (D). The triple point for a substance is a unique combination of temperature and pressure
at which all three major phases (solid, liquid, and gas) are in simultaneous equilibrium. The
triple point occurs at the convergence of the three phase boundary lines.
6. (C). Attack this problem by using the dilution equation: C1 × V1 = C2 × V2.
(0.500M) × (150mL) = (0.150M) × V2
Solving for V2 gives you 500mL. So, the final solution should have a volume of 500mL.
Because the initial solution had a volume of 150mL, you must add 350mL of water to achieve
the desired final volume.

Chapter 12: Answering Questions on Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

7. (E). Solving this question requires you to understand the dissolution reaction of lead (II)
chloride and the definition of the solubility product constant, Ksp.
PbCl2(s) + H2O(l)  Pb2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq)
Ksp = 1.7 × 10–5 = [Pb2+][Cl–]2
Notice from the dissolution reaction equation that for every mole of PbCl2 that dissolves, you
get one mole of Pb2+ cation and two moles of Cl– anions. Using this fact, we can substitute into
the equation for the Ksp:
1.7 × 10–5 = [x][2x]2
1.7 × 10–5 = 4x3
Solving for x, you get 1.6 × 10–2. However, the concentration of Cl– is 2x, so the answer is 
3.2 × 10–2.
8. (B). To answer this question, you must know the definition of molality, m = (moles solute) /
(kilograms solvent). Next, you must find the moles of NaCl solute by converting from the
given mass of 15 grams. Because the molar mass of NaCl is 58.45 g mol–1, you have 0.257mol
NaCl. Next, substitute into the definition of molality:
0.75m = (0.257mol NaCl) / (X kilograms water)
Solving for X, you get 0.34kg water.
9. (D). This question requires you to apply a result of Henry’s law, stating that the solubility
of an ideal gas in a liquid solvent is directly proportional to the pressure: S1 / P1 = S2 / P2.
Before substituting into the proportion, however, you should calculate the initial molar
solubility:
Molarity = (1.6 × 10–3mol) / (2L) = 0.80 × 10–3 M
Substituting into the proportion, you get (0.80 × 10–3 M) / (1atm) = S2 / (2.5atm)
Solving for S2 gives you 2.0 × 10–3 M.
10. (D). Supercritical fluids occur in high temperature–high pressure conditions beyond the
thermodynamic critical point of a substance. Under these conditions, the substance has
properties of both a gas (high diffusivity) and a liquid (ability to dissolve solute).
11. (B). The atoms of a metallic solid are packed within an ordered lattice, but are so elec-
tropositive that electrons move freely about the lattice, which accounts for the high electri-
cal conductivity of metals.
12. (E). In an amorphous solid, particles — often polymers — are packed tightly enough that
the substance isn’t fluid, but lack the extreme order and structural regularity of a crystalline
solid.
13. (C). Provided enough energy, the particles of a gas (often, a superheated gas) can ionize
to create plasma, a state of matter that is diffuse and fluid like gas, but has unusual proper-
ties due to its ionic nature.
124
Part III: Colliding Particles to Produce States 

14. (A). Within a crystalline solid, particles are tightly packed within highly ordered, regularly
repeating structural units called unit cells. So little translational freedom is available to the
particles within a crystalline solid that all they can usually do is to vibrate in place. Such is
the price of perfection.
15. (A). This question tests your knowledge of two colligative properties, boiling point eleva-
tion (∆Tb) and freezing point depression, (∆Tf). You are required to know that colligative prop-
erties, which apply to ideal solutions, depend solely on the number of solute particles in
solution, and not on the physical or chemical properties of those particles. The number of
solute particles is measured by molality, m. The effects of added solute on boiling and freezing
points depend on the solvent. By giving you data on the boiling point and freezing point of a
1M glucose solution, the question essentuially gives you the boiling point and freezing point
proportionality constants, Kb = 0.52 °C m–1 and Kf = –1.86 °C m–1. Next, you must determine the
molality of the ribose solution. To do so, you must calculate the molar mass of ribose, 150 g
mol–1. Because 300g ribose are dissolved, there are 2.0 moles ribose in the solution. 
molality = (2.0mol ribose) / (4.0kg solvent) = 0.50m
Next, substitute into the equations for boiling point elevation and freezing point depression:
∆Tb = (0.52 °C m–1) × (0.50m) = 0.26 °C
∆Tf = (°1.86 °C m–1) × (0.50m) = –0.93 °C
Adding these quantites to the standard boiling point and freezing point of water gives 
Tb = 100.26 °C and Tf = –0.93 °C.
16. (D). This question requires to understand that boiling point, as a colligative property,
depends on the number of moles of solute particles in solution, not on the number of moles
of solute compound. For example, one mole of dissolved KCl contributes 2 moles of particles
(one mole K+ and one mole Cl–). Taking this factor into account, it is clear that in 1.0M NaNO3,
the NaNO3 contributes the fewest particles to solution (one mole Na+ and one mole of the
polyatomic ion NO3
–), and therefore elevates the boiling point the least.
17. (E). With its hydroxyl functional group, ethanol is quite capable of forming hydrogen
bonds, which require a hydrogen covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (like oxygen)
and also require a second electronegative atom (like the oxygen of a second ethanol mole-
cule). Hydrogen bonds are themselves a kind of dipole-dipole interaction, employing the
strong dipoles set up by the electronegative atoms. Finally, all condensed phase molecules
engage in London dispersion interactions. So, ethanol participates in all three kinds of inter-
molecular interactions.
18. (D). The heat added within this segment clearly does not go toward rasing the tempera-
ture of the substance. Instead, the added heat goes toward rearranging particles at a given
temperature from solid phase into liquid phase. We know this as it is the first of the phase
changes to be shown (moving left to right on the diagram).The heat required to accomplish
this phase change is called the heat of fusion, ∆Hfus.
19. (B). Heat added in this segment clearly goes toward increasing the temperature of the
substance. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a
sample.
20. (C). Moving from right to left within the diagram corresponds to heat transferred out of
the system, and doing so within this segement clearly results in a decrease in the tempera-
ture of the substance. Falling temperature corresponds to a decrease in the average kinetic
energy of the particles in a system.
125
Chapter 12: Answering Questions on Solids, Liquids, and Solutions

21. (E). The heat added within this segment clearly does not go toward raising the tempera-
ture of the substance. Instead the added heat goes toward rearranging particles at a given
temperature from liquid phase to gas phase (the second phase change shown in the dia-
gram). The heat required to accomplish this phase change is called the heat of vaporization,
∆Hvap.
22. (A). This segment lies beween the plateaus corresponding to fusion (melting) and vapor-
ization (boiling). The phase that sits between melting and boiling is liquid. Note that the
average kinetic energy of the particles is increasing during this segment.

hen matter transforms, we call it chemistry.
Breaking and making bonds, swapping protons,
swapping electrons . . . these kinds of simple transactions
underlie all of chemistry and are the subject of this part.
We show you how to recognize the major categories of
reactions, and how to keep track of which bits of matter
do what to which other bits. Once you know which reac-
tion is going on, you can predict all sorts of things, like
how much product will be made, and how much reactant
will be left over. In this part, you’ll learn how acidity and
charge can take center stage in a chemical reaction, with-
out changing the basic rules by which chemical change
takes place. Finally, you’ll learn to discern the difference
between how far a reaction goes, and how quickly it gets
where it’s going. Each question deals with energy, but the
two questions are independent. We show you a handful
of equations that allow you to calculate answers to both
questions. This part is the beating heart of the book.

toichiometry. Such a complicated word for such a simple idea. The Greek roots of the
word mean “measuring elements,” which doesn’t sound nearly as intimidating.
Moreover, the ancient Greeks couldn’t tell an ionic bond from an ionic column, so just how
technical and scary could stoichiometry really be? Simply stated, stoichiometry (stoh-ick-
eee-AH-muh-tree) is the quantitative relationship between atoms in chemical substances. 
We will begin this chapter by walking you through each of the types of chemical reaction you
will encounter on the AP chemistry exam. Several of them will be discussed in greater detail
in later chapters. Then, we will show you how to use your understanding of chemical equa-
tions to do AP-type Chemistry problems, and Chapter 14 will allow you to practice your new-
found skills.
The first half of the chapter describes the basics of stoichiometry, then delves into the seven
types of reaction that you’d do well to recognize (notice how their names tell you what hap-
pens in each reaction). By recognizing the patterns of these seven types of reaction, you can
often predict reaction products given only a set of reactants. There are no perfect guidelines,
and predicting reaction products can take what is called “chemical intuition,” a sense of what
reaction is likely to occur based on knowing the outcomes of similar reactions. Still, if you are
given both reactants and products, you should be able to tell what kind of reaction connects
them, and if you are given reactants and the type of reaction, you should be able to predict
likely products. Figuring out the formulas of products often requires you to apply knowledge
about how ionic and molecular compounds are put together. To review these concepts, see
Chapter 5. 
The remainder of the chapter covers how to use your knowledge of these reaction types to
calculate the quantities that allow you to quantify the success of a reaction.

Stoichiometry Lingo: How to Decipher
Chemical Reactions
Chemists have a nice, ordered set of rules for describing chemical reactions. Reactants are
always on the lefthand side of the equation, and products on the right, for example. Chemists
would rather stick their hands in a vat of concentrated hydrochloric acid than reverse this
order. There are also a nice, ordered set of chemical symbols that chemists use to describe
reactions, and each symbol has one precise meaning. These fundamentals of stoichiometry
are described in this section and, since they form the basis of all of stoichiometry, which is a
huge point-gainer on the AP exam, it would behoove you to memorize them before moving on.
In compound formulas and reaction equations, you express stoichiometry by using sub-
scripted numbers on atoms and coefficients in front of groups of atoms. Just like an account-
ant can’t afford to make a mistake when tracking the dollars and cents in your parents’ bank
account, you can’t afford to lose track of any atoms on the AP exam. The road to poor scores
in AP Chemistry is littered with students who couldn’t master stoichiometry!
In general, all chemical equations are written in the basic form:
Reactants →Products
where the arrow in the middle means yields or “turns into.” The basic idea is that the reactants
react, and the reaction produces products. By reacting, we simply mean that bonds within
the reactants are broken, to be replaced by new and different bonds within the products.
Chemists fill chemical equations with symbols because they think it looks cool and, more
important, because the symbols help pack a lot of meaning into a small space. Table 13-1
summarizes the most important symbols you’ll find in chemical equations.
Table 13-1
Symbols Commonly Used in Chemical Equations
Symbol
Explanation
+
Separates two reactants or products
→
The “yields” symbol separates the reactants from the products. The single
arrowhead suggests the reaction occurs in only one direction.

A two-way yield symbol means the reaction can occur in both the forward and
reverse directions. You may also see this symbol written as two stacked arrows
with opposing arrowheads.
(s)
A compound followed by this symbol exists as a solid.
(l)
A compound followed by this symbol exists as a liquid.
(g)
A compound followed by this symbol exists as a gas.
(aq)
A compound followed by this symbol exists in aqueous solution, dissolved in water.
∆
This symbol, usually written above the yields symbol, signifies that heat is added to
the reactants.
Ni, LiCl
Sometimes a chemical symbol (such as those for nickel or lithium chloride here) is
written above the yields symbol. This means that the indicated chemical was added
as a catalyst. Catalysts speed up reactions but do not otherwise participate in them.
130
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

After you understand how to interpret chemical symbols, compound names (see Chapter 5),
and the symbols in Table 13-1, there’s not a lot you can’t understand. You’re equipped, for
example, to decode a chemical equation into an English sentence describing a reaction.
Conversely, you can translate an English sentence into the chemical equation it describes.
When you’re fluent in this language, you regrettably won’t be able to talk to the animals; you
will, however, be able to describe their metabolism in great detail.
Building and Breaking: Synthesis and
Decomposition Reactions
The two simplest types of chemical reactions involve the joining of two compounds to form
one compound or the breaking apart of one compound to form two. We describe both of
these simple reactions in the sections that follow.
Synthesis
In synthesis (or combination) reactions, two or more reactants combine to form a single
product, following the general pattern
A + B →C
For example,
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) →2NaCl(s)
The combining of elements to form compounds (like NaCl) is a particularly common kind of
combination reaction. Here is another such example:
2Ca(s) + O2(g) →2CaO(s) 
Compounds can also combine to form new compounds, such as in the combination of
sodium oxide with water to form sodium hydroxide:
Na2O(s) + H2O(l) →2NaOH(aq)
Decomposition
In a decomposition reaction, a single reactant breaks down (decomposes) into two or more
products, following the general pattern
A →B + C
For example,
2H2O(l) →2H2(g) + O2(g)
Notice that combination and decomposition reactions are the same reaction in opposite
directions.
131
Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

Many decomposition reactions produce gaseous products, such as in the decomposition of
carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide:
H2CO3(aq) →H2O(l) + CO2(g) 
Swapping Spots: Displacement Reactions
Many common reactions involve the swapping of one or more atoms or polyatomic ions in a
compound. You can check these reactions out in the following sections.
Single replacement
In a single replacement reaction, a single, more-reactive element or group replaces a less-
reactive element or group, following the general pattern
A + BC →AC + B
For example,
Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) →ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)
Single replacement reactions in which metals replace other metals are especially common.
You can determine which metals are likely to replace which others by using the metal activity
series, a ranked list of metals in which ones higher on the list tend to replace ones lower on
the list. Table 13-2 presents the metal activity series.
Table 13-2

Hydrogen

Least reactive metals; often found as free
metals; oxides decompose easily
Double replacement
Double replacement is a special form of metathesis reaction (that is, a reaction in which two
reacting species exchange bonds). Double replacement reactions tend to occur between
ionic compounds in solution. In these reactions, cations (atoms or groups with positive
132
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

charge) from each reactant swap places to form ionic compounds with the opposing anions
(atoms or groups with negative charge), following the general pattern
AB + CD →AD + CB
For example,
KCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) →AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)
Of course, ions dissolved in solution move about freely, not as part of cation-anion complexes.
So, to allow double replacement reactions to progress, one of several things must occur:
 One of the product compounds must be insoluble, so it precipitates (forms an insolu-
ble solid) out of solution after it forms.
 One of the products must be a gas that bubbles out of solution after it forms.
 One of the products must be a solvent molecule, such as H2O, that separates from the
ionic compounds after it forms.
Burning Up: Combustion Reactions
Oxygen is always a reactant in combustion reactions, which often release heat and light as they
occur. Combustion reactions frequently involve hydrocarbon reactants (like propane,C3H8(g),
the gas used to fire up backyard grills), and yield carbon dioxide and water as products. For
example,
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) →3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)
Combustion reactions also include combination reactions between elements and oxygen,
such as:
S(s) + O2(g) →SO2(g)
So, if the reactants include oxygen (O2) and a hydrocarbon or an element, you’re probably
dealing with a combustion reaction. If the products are carbon dioxide and water, you’re
almost certainly dealing with a combustion reaction.
Getting Sour: Acid-Base Reactions
Acids and bases are complicated enough to deserve their own chapter, so flip forward to
Chapter 17 for the nitty-gritty details of this reaction type. In the meantime, and so you have
a comprehensive list of reaction types which the AP chemistry exam may quiz you on in one
place, we’ll provide a summary here.
Neutralization reactions, which occur when an acid and a base are mixed together to form a
salt and water, are the bread and butter of acid-base reactions. The best way to spot a reaction
of this type is to look for water among the products of a reaction. If the water came from a
double replacement reaction in which a hydrogen from one reactant (the acid) joined up with a
hydroxide from the other (the base), then you are definitely dealing with an acid-base reaction. 
Not all acid-base reactions are so simple, however. Bases do not necessarily contain hydrox-
ide, and the products are not always water and a salt. See Chapter 17 for the details of the
myriad of acid-base reactions.
133
Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

Getting Charged: Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Oxidation-reduction (or redox) reactions, like acid-base reactions, have an entire chapter
(Chapter 19) devoted to them. Redox reactions are concerned with the transfer of electrons
between reactants. Because they involve the transfer of charged particles, ions are a staple
of redox reactions and are the things to look out for when trying to spot one. The species in
a redox reaction that loses electrons to the other reactant is oxidized in the reaction, while
the species that gains the electrons is reduced. There are two easy mnemonics commonly
used to remember this, so take your pick or make up your own:
 LEO and GER: Lose electrons, oxidation. Gain electrons, reduction.
 OIL RIG: Oxidation is lost, reduction is gained.
Oxidation and reduction reactions always occur together, but may be written separately as
half reactions in a chemistry problem. In these half reactions, electrons being transferred are
written explicitly, so if you see them, take it as a dead giveaway that you are dealing with a
redox reaction.
The Stoichiometry Underground: Moles
Chemical equations are all well and good, but what do they actually mean? For translating
chemical equations into useful chemical data, you can find no better or more fundamental
tool than the mole. As an AP chemistry student, you’re probably already exhaustively famil-
iar with the mole, but in the following sections, we provide you with a comprehensive review
of the mole and its usefulness in case you forgot any of the basics along the way. 
Counting your particles: The mole
Chemists routinely deal with hunks of material containing trillions of trillions of atoms, but
ridiculously large numbers can induce migraines. For this reason, chemists count particles
(like atoms and molecules) in multiples of a quantity called the mole. Initially, counting parti-
cles in moles can be counterintuitive, similar to the weirdness of Dustin Hoffman’s character
in the movie Rainman, when he informs Tom Cruise’s character that he has spilled 0.41 frac-
tion of a box of 200 toothpicks onto the floor. Instead of referring to 82 individual toothpick
particles, he refers to a fraction of a larger unit, the 200-toothpick box. A mole is a very big
box of toothpicks — 6.022 × 1023 toothpicks, to be precise. 
If 6.022 × 1023 strikes you as an unfathomably large number, then you’re thinking about it cor-
rectly. It’s larger, in fact, than the number of stars in the sky or the number of fish in the sea,
and is many, many times more than the number of people who have ever been born through-
out all of human history. When you think about the number of particles in something as
simple as, say, a cup of water, all your previous conceptions of “big numbers” are blown out
of the water, as it were.
The number 6.022 × 1023, known as Avogadro’s number, is named after the 19th century Italian
scientist Amedeo Avogadro. Posthumously, Avogadro really pulled one off in giving his name
to this number, because he never actually thought of it. The real brain behind Avogadro’s
number was that of a French scientist named Jean Baptiste Perrin. Nearly 100 years after
Avogadro had his final pasta, Perrin named the number after him as an homage. Ironically,
this humble act of tribute has misdirected the resentment of countless hordes of high school
chemistry students to Avogadro instead of Perrin.
134
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Avogadro’s number is the conversion factor used to move between particle counts and num-
bers of moles:
1 mole / 6.022 × 1023 particles
Like all conversion factors, you can invert it to move in the other direction, from moles to
particles. 
Assigning mass and volume to your particles
Chemists always begin a discussion about moles with Avogadro’s number. They do this for
two reasons. First, it makes sense to start the discussion with the way the mole was origi-
nally defined. Second, it’s a sufficiently large number to intimidate the unworthy.
Still, for all its primacy and intimidating size, Avogadro’s number quickly grows tedious in
everyday use. More interesting is the fact that one mole of a pure monatomic substance
(in other words, a substance that always appears as a single atom) turns out to possess
exactly its atomic mass’s worth of grams. In other words, one mole of monatomic hydrogen
weighs about 1 gram. One mole of monatomic helium weighs about 4 grams. The same is true
no matter where you wander through the corridors of the periodic table. If we define molar
mass as the mass of one mole of any substance, then the number listed as the atomic mass
of an element equals that element’s molar mass if the element is monatomic. Guess what —
chemists actually set up the value of the mole to make that happen, though it took years of
arguments and an international commission to get the final details down to the last decimal
place just right.
Of course, chemistry involves the making and breaking of bonds, so talk of pure monatomic
substances gets you only so far. How lucky, then, that calculating the mass per mole of a
complex molecule is essentially no different than finding the mass per mole of a monatomic
element. For example, one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) is assembled from 6 carbon atoms,
12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. To calculate the number of grams per mole of a
complex molecule (such as glucose), simply do the following:
1. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the first element by its atomic mass.
In this case, the first element is carbon, and you’d multiply its atomic mass, 12, by the
number of atoms, 6.
2. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the second element by its atomic mass.
Here, you multiply hydrogen’s atomic mass of 1 by the number of hydrogen atoms, 12.
3. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the third element by its atomic mass.
Keep going until you’ve covered all the elements in the molecule.
The third element in glucose is oxygen, so you multiply 16, the atomic mass by 6, the
number of oxygen atoms.
4. Finally, add the masses together. 
In this example, (12g mol–1 × 6) + (1g mol–1 × 12) + (16g mol–1 × 6) = 180g mol–1.
This kind of quantity, called the gram molecular mass, is exceptionally convenient for chemists,
who are much more inclined to measure the mass of a substance than to count all of millions
or billions of individual particles that make it up.

Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

If chemists don’t try to intimidate you with large numbers, they may attempt to do so by
throwing around big words. For example, older chemists may distinguish between the molar
masses of pure elements, molecular compounds, and ionic compounds by referring to them
as the gram atomic mass, gram molecular mass, and gram formula mass, respectively. Don’t be
fooled! The basic concept behind each is the same: molar mass. Fortunately these other
terms are never used by those modern folks who write AP chemistry exams.
It’s all very good to find the mass of a solid or liquid and then go about calculating the
number of moles in that sample. But what about gases? Let’s not engage in phase discrimina-
tion; gases are made of matter, too, and their moles have the right to stand and be counted.
Fortunately, there’s a convenient way to convert between the moles of gaseous particles and
their volume. Unlike gram atomic/molecular/formula masses, this conversion factor is con-
stant no matter what kinds of molecules make up the gas. Every gas assumed to behave ideally
has a volume of 22.4 liters per mole, regardless of the size of the gaseous molecules.
Before you start your hooray-chemistry-is-finally-getting-simple dance, however, understand
that certain conditions apply to this conversion factor. For example, it’s only true at standard
temperature and pressure (STP), or 0° Celsius and 1atm. Also, the figure of 22.4L mol–1 applies
only to the extent that a gas resembles an ideal gas, one whose particles have zero volume
and neither attract nor repel one another. Ultimately, no gas is truly ideal, but many are so
close to being so that the 22.4L mol–1 conversion is very useful. 
Giving credit where it’s due: Percent composition
Chemists are often concerned with precisely what percentage of a compound’s mass con-
sists of one particular element. Lying awake at night, uttering prayers to Avogadro, they fret
over this quantity, called percent composition. Percent composition was mentioned in
Chapter 5, but now that you have reviewed the basics of stoichiometry, we will explain in
detail how to calculate it. 
Follow these three simple steps:
1. Calculate the molar mass of the compound, as we explain in the previous section. 
Percent compositions are completely irrelevant to molar masses for pure monatomic
substances, which by definition have 100 percent composition of a given element.
2. Multiply the atomic mass of each element present in the compound by the number
of atoms of that element present in one molecule.
3. Divide each of the masses calculated in Step 2 by the total mass calculated in Step 1.
Multiply each fractional quotient by 100%. Voilà! You have the percent composition
by mass of each element in the compound.
Checking out empirical formulas
What if you don’t know the formula of a compound? Chemists sometimes find themselves in
this disconcerting scenario. Rather than curse Avogadro (or perhaps after doing so), they
analyze samples of the frustrating unknown to identify the percent composition. From there,
they calculate the ratios of different types of atoms in the compound. They express these
ratios as an empirical formula, the lowest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound.
136
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

To find an empirical formula given percent composition, use the following procedure:
1. Assume that you have 100g of the unknown compound. 
The beauty of this little trick is that you conveniently gift yourself with the same
number of grams of each elemental component as its contribution to the percent com-
position. For example, if you assume that you have 100g of a compound composed of
60.3 percent magnesium and 39.7 percent oxygen, you know that you have 60.3g of
magnesium and 39.7g of oxygen.
2. Convert the assumed masses from Step 1 into moles by using gram atomic masses.
3. Divide each of the element-by-element mole quantities from Step 2 by the lowest
among them. 
This division yields the mole ratios of the elements of the compound.
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the small-
est possible factor that produces whole-number mole ratios for all of the elements.
For example, if there is one nitrogen atom for every 0.5 oxygen atoms in a compound,
the empirical formula is not N1O0.5. Such a formula casually suggests that an oxygen
atom has been split, something that would create a small-scale nuclear explosion.
Though impressive-sounding, this scenario is almost certainly false. Far more likely is
that the atoms of nitrogen to oxygen are combining in a 1:0.5 ratio, but do so in groups
of 2 × (1:0.5) = 2:1. The empirical formula is thus N2O.
Because the original percent composition data is typically experimental, expect to see
a bit of error in the numbers. For example, 2.03 is probably within experimental error
of 2.
5. Write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as sub-
scripts to the chemical symbol of each element. Order the elements according to the
general rules for naming ionic and molecular compounds (described in Chapter 5).
Differentiating between empirical formulas
and molecular formulas
Many compounds in nature, particularly compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
are composed of atoms that occur in numbers that are multiples of their empirical formula.
In other words, their empirical formulas don’t reflect the actual numbers of atoms within
them, but only the ratios of those atoms. What a nuisance! Fortunately, this is an old nui-
sance, so chemists have devised a means to deal with it. To account for these annoying types
of compounds, chemists are careful to differentiate between an empirical formula and a
molecular formula. A molecular formula uses subscripts that report the actual number of
atoms of each type in a molecule of the compound (a formula unit accomplishes the same
thing for ionic compounds).
Molecular formulas are associated with molar masses that are simple whole-number multi-
ples of the corresponding empirical formula mass. In other words, a molecule with the empiri-
cal formula CH2O has an empirical formula mass of 30.0g mol–1 (12 for the carbon + 2 for the
two hydrogens + 16 for the oxygen). The molecule may have a molecular formula of CH2O,
C2H4O2, C3H6O3, and so on. As a result, the compound may have a molar mass of 30.0g mol–1,
60.0g mol–1, 90.0g mol–1, and so on.
137
Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

You can’t calculate a molecular formula based on percent composition alone. If you attempt
to do so, Avogadro and Perrin will rise from their graves, find you, and slap you 6.022 × 1023
times per cheek (Ooh, that smarts!). The folly of such an approach is made clear by compar-
ing formaldehyde with glucose. The two compounds have the same empirical formula, CH2O,
but different molecular formulas, CH2O and C6H12O6, respectively. Glucose is a simple sugar,
the one made by photosynthesis and the one broken down during cellular respiration. You
can dissolve it into your coffee with pleasant results. Formaldehyde is a carcinogenic compo-
nent of smog. Solutions of formaldehyde have historically been used to embalm dead bodies.
You are not advised to dissolve formaldehyde into your coffee. In other words, molecular for-
mulas differ from empirical formulas, and the difference is important.
To determine a molecular formula, you must know the molar mass of the compound as well
as the empirical formula (or enough information to calculate it yourself from the percent
composition; see the previous section for details). With these tools in hand, calculating the
molecular formula involves a three-step process:
1. Calculate the empirical formula mass.
2. Divide the molar mass by the empirical formula mass.
3. Multiply each of the subscripts within the empirical formula by the number
calculated in Step 2.
Keeping the See-Saw Straight:
Balancing Reaction Equations
Equations that simply show reactants on one side of the reaction arrow and products on the
other are skeleton equations, and are perfectly adequate for a qualitative description of the
reaction: who are the reactants and who are the products. But if you look closely, you’ll see
that those equations just don’t add up quantitatively. As written, the mass of one mole of
each of the reactants doesn’t equal the mass of one mole of each of the products. The skele-
ton equations break the Law of Conservation of Mass, which states that all the mass present
at the beginning of a reaction must be present at the end. To be quantitatively accurate,
these equations must be balanced so the masses of reactants and products are equal.
In chemistry this is easy — the requirement is met as mentioned earlier by assuring that the
numbers of the same types of atoms are equal on each side. All the equations we have so far
written have met this balance requirement. (The crime of losing or splitting atoms is punish-
able by an Avogadro number of lashes!).
How to use coefficients
To balance an equation, you use coefficients to alter the number of moles of reactants and/or
products so the mass on one side of the equation equals the mass on the other side. A coeffi-
cient is simply a number that precedes the symbol of an element or compound, multiplying
the number of moles of that entire compound within the equation. Coefficients are different
from subscripts, which multiply the number of atoms or groups within a compound. Consider
the following:
4Cu(NO3)2
138
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

The number 4 that precedes the compound is a coefficient, indicating that there are four
moles of copper (II) nitrate. The subscripted 3 and 2 within the compound indicate that each
nitrate contains three oxygen atoms, and that there are two nitrate groups per atom of
copper. Coefficients and subscripts multiply to yield the total number of moles of each atom:
4mol Cu(NO3)2 × (1mol Cu/mol Cu(NO3)2) = 4mol Cu
4mol Cu(NO3)2 × (2mol NO3/mol Cu(NO3)2) × 1mol N/mol NO3 = 8mol N
4mol Cu(NO3)2 × (2mol NO3/mol Cu(NO3)2) × 3mol O/mol NO3 = 24mol O
When you balance an equation, you change only the coefficients. Changing subscripts alters
the chemical compounds themselves. If your pencil were equipped with an electrical shock-
ing device, that device would activate the moment you attempted to change a subscript
while balancing an equation.
Here’s a simple recipe for balancing equations:
1. Given a skeleton equation (one that includes formulas for reactants and products),
count up the number of each kind of atom on each side of the equation.
If you recognize any polyatomic ions, you can count these as one whole group (as if
they were their own form of element). See Chapter 5 for information on recognizing
polyatomic ions.
2. Use coefficients to balance the elements or polyatomic ions, one at a time.
For simplicity, start with those elements or ions that appear only once on each side.
3. Check the equation to ensure that each element or ion is balanced.
Checking is important because you may have “ping-ponged” several times from reac-
tants to products and back — there’s plenty of opportunity for error.
4. When you’re sure the reaction is balanced, check to make sure it’s in lowest terms.
For example,
4H2(g) + 2O2(g) →4H2O(l)
should be reduced to
2H2(g) + O2(g) →2H2O(l)
You can’t begin to wrap your brain around the unimaginably large number of possible chemi-
cal reactions. It’s good that so many reactions can occur, because they make things like life
and the universe possible. From the perspective of a mere human brain trying to grok all
these reactions, we have another bit of good news: A few categories of reactions pop up over
and over again. After you see the very basic patterns in these categories, you’ll be able to
make sense of the majority of reactions out there.
Conversions
Mass and energy are conserved. It’s the law. Unfortunately, this means that there’s no such
thing as a free lunch, or any other type of free meal. Ever. On the other hand, the conserva-
tion of mass makes it possible to predict how chemical reactions will turn out.
Balancing equations can seem like a chore, like taking out the trash. But a balanced equation
is far better than any collection of coffee grounds and orange peels because such an equa-
tion is a useful tool. After you’ve got a balanced equation, you can use the coefficients to
build mole-mole conversion factors. These kinds of conversion factors tell you how much of
any given product you get by reacting any given amount of reactant. This is one of those 
calculations that makes chemists particularly useful, so they needn’t get by on looks and
charm alone.
139
Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

Consider the following balanced equation for generating ammonia from nitrogen and hydro-
gen gases:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) →2NH3(g)
For every mole of nitrogen molecules reactanting, a chemist expects two moles of ammonia
product. Similarly, for every three moles of hydrogen molecules reacting, the chemist expects
two moles of ammonia product. These expectations are based on the coefficients of the bal-
anced equation and are expressed as mole-mole conversion factors as shown in Figure 13-1.
The mole is the beating heart of stoichiometry, the central unit through which other quanti-
ties flow. Real-life chemists don’t have magic mole vision, however. A chemist can’t look at a
pile of potassium chloride crystals, squint her eyes, and proclaim: “That’s 0.539 moles of
salt.” Well, she could proclaim such a thing, but she wouldn’t bet her pocket protector on it.
Real reagents (reactants) tend to be measured in units of mass or volume, and occasionally
even in actual numbers of particles. Real products are measured in the same way. So, you
need to be able to use mole-mass, mole-volume, and mole-particle conversion factors to trans-
late between these different dialects of counting. Figure 13-2 summarizes the interrelation-
ship between all these things and serves as a flowchart for problem solving. All roads lead to
and from the mole.

Getting rid of mere spectators: Net ionic equations
Chemistry is often conducted in aqueous solutions. Soluble ionic compounds dissolve into
their component ions, and these ions can react to form new products. In these kinds of reac-
tions, sometimes only the cation or anion of a dissolved compound reacts. The other ion
merely watches the whole affair, twiddling its charged thumbs in electrostatic boredom.
These uninvolved ions are called spectator ions.
Because spectator ions don’t actually participate in the chemistry of a reaction, you don’t
need to include them in a chemical equation. Doing so leads to a needlessly complicated
reaction equation. So, chemists prefer to write net ionic equations, which omit the spectator
ions. A net ionic equation doesn’t include every component that might be present in a given
beaker. Rather, it includes only those components that actually react. 
Here is a simple recipe for making net ionic equations of your own:
1. Examine the starting equation to determine which ionic compounds are dissolved,
as indicated by the (aq) symbol following the compound name.
Zn(s) + HCl(aq) →ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)
2. Rewrite the equation, explicitly separating dissolved ionic compounds into their
component ions. 
This step requires you to recognize common polyatomic ions, so be sure to familiarize
yourself with them.
Zn(s) + H+(aq) + Cl–(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) + H2(g)
3. Compare the reactant and product sides of the rewritten reaction. Any dissolved
ions that appear in the same form on both sides are spectator ions. Cross out the
spectator ions to produce a net reaction.
Zn(s) + H+(aq) + Cl–(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) + H2(g)
Net reaction:
Zn(s) + H+(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
As written, the preceding reaction is imbalanced with respect to the number of hydro-
gen atoms and the amount of positive charge.
4. Balance the net reaction for mass and charge.
Zn(s) + 2H+(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
If you wish, you can balance the equation for atoms and charge first (at Step 1). This way,
when you cross out spectator ions at Step 3, you’ll be crossing out equivalent numbers of
ions. Either method produces the same net ionic equation in the end. Some people prefer to
balance the starting reaction equation, but others prefer to balance the net reaction because
it is a simpler equation.
Running Out Early: Limiting Reagents
In real-life chemistry, not all of the reactants present convert into product. That would be
perfect and convenient. Does that sound like real life to you? More typically, one reagent is
completely used up, and others are left behind, perhaps to react another day.
141
Chapter 13: Reacting by the Numbers: Reactions and Stoichiometry

The situation resembles that of a horde of Hollywood hopefuls lined up for a limited number
of slots as extras in a film. Only so many eager faces react with an available slot to produce a
happily (albeit pitifully) employed actor. The remaining actors are in excess, muttering quietly
all the way back to their jobs as waiters. In this scenario, the slots are the limiting reagent.
Those standing in line demand to know, how many slots are there? With this key piece of
data, they can deduce how many of their huddled mass will end up with a gig. Or, they can
figure out how many will continue to waste their film school degrees serving penne with basil
and goat cheese to chemists on vacation.
Chemists demand to know, which reactant will run out first? In other words, which reactant
is the limiting reagent? Knowing that information allows them to calculate how much product
they can expect, based on how much of the limiting reagent they’ve put into the reaction.
Also, identifying the limiting reagent allows them to calculate how much of the excess
reagent they’ll have left over when all the smoke clears. Either way, the first step is to figure
out which is the limiting reagent.
In any chemical reaction, you can simply pick one reagent as a candidate for the limiting
reagent, calculate how many moles of that reagent you have, and then calculate how many
grams of the other reagent you’d need to react both to completion. You’ll discover one of two
things. Either you have an excess of the first reagent or you have an excess of the second
reagent. The one you have in excess the the excess reagent. The one that is not in excess is
the limiting reagent.
Having Something to Show for Yourself:
Percent Yield
In a way, reactants have it easy. Maybe they’ll make something of themselves and actually
react. Or maybe they’ll just lean against the inside of the beaker, flip through a back issue of
People magazine, and sip a caramel macchiato.
Chemists don’t have it so easy. Someone is paying them to do reactions. That someone 
doesn’t have time or money for excuses about loitering reactants. So you, as a fresh-faced
chemist, have to be concerned with just how completely your reactants react to form prod-
ucts. To compare the amount of product obtained from a reaction with the amount that
should have been obtained, chemists use percent yield. You determine percent yield with
the following formula:
Percent yield = 100% × (actual yield) / (theoretical yield)
Lovely, but what is an actual yield and what is a theoretical yield? An actual yield is . . . well . . .
the amount of product actually produced by the reaction. A theoretical yield is the amount of
product that could have been produced had everything gone perfectly, as described by
theory — in other words, as predicted by your painstaking calculations.
Things never go perfectly. Reagents stick to the sides of flasks. Impurities sabotage reactions.
Chemists attempt to dance. None of these ghastly things are supposed to occur, but they do.
So, actual yields fall short of theoretical yields.

and Stoichiometry
In This Chapter

 Putting in some practice with example questions
 Seeing how your answers stack up 
I
f we had to name one single thing that is key to acing the AP chemistry exam, a solid
understanding of stoichiometry would be it. Stoichiometry is chemistry’s bread and
butter. Make sure that you understand all of the concepts outlined in Chapter 13 in detail
and you will score some major points on exam day. To ensure you nail the concepts of stoi-
chiometry, we not only include the major points that are essential to your success, but we
also include practice questions near the end of the chapter so you can sharpen your test-
taking skills on stoichiometry.
Making Sure You React to Questions 
with the Right Answers
Stoichiometry and the skills that surround it might seem mundane, but they are central skills
that let you grapple with the very heart of chemistry: reactions. It’s well worth your time to
make sure you know these basics back and forth.
Knowing reactions when you see them
These tips and reminders are all about recognition — knowing how to decode chemical for-
mulas and reaction equations to understand what reaction is taking place, and even how to
predict the products of a reaction when all you’re given is the reactants. 
 Reaction equations use symbols to indicate details of the reaction. Review the symbols
in Chapter 13 in Table 13-1 and make sure that you’re familiar with all of them. 
 Make sure that you’re familiar with the seven common reaction types and are able to
identify them and predict products if given only reactants. It is not so important to
memeorize the names of the types as it is to be able to predict products and balance

equations. Many reactions on tests expect “familiar” compounds as products, not truly
exotic ones, so don’t get hung up on memorizing lots of exotic compounds!
• Synthesis/Combination reactions: A + B →C. Two or more reactants combine to
form a single product. 
• Decomposition reactions: A →B + C. Four types of decomposition reaction are
seen quite commonly on the AP chemistry exam. These are 
metal carbonate →metal oxide + CO2(g)
metal chlorate →metal chloride + O2(g)
metal hydroxide →metal oxide + H2O
acid →nonmetal oxide + H2O
• Single replacement reactions: A + BC →B + AC. Single replacement reactions are
all redox reactions! The likelihood of single replacement reactions occurring relies
on the reactivity series of metals outlined in Table 13-2. A will only displace B if it
is a more-reactive species, which means it appears higher in the reactivity series.
• Double replacement reactions: AB + CD →AD + CB. A and D will not necessarily
combine in the same ratios as A and B did. Take careful account of the charges of
each species and make sure to balance the equation in the end.
• Combustion reactions: These contain oxygen among the reactants. The most
common types of combustion reactions are those where hydrocarbons are
burned to form water and carbon dioxide as products, but a familiar trap is to
forget that substances that already contain oxygen, such as ethanol (C2H6O),
also “burn” to form carbon dioxide and water. All combustion reactions are also
redox reactions.
• Neutralization, or acid/base reactions: Acid + Base →Water + Salt. Chapter 17
explains these in greater detail. 
• There are also a number of acid-base reaction types in addition to neutralization
reactions. These are
Nonmetal oxide + H2O →acid
Metal oxide + H2O →base
Metal + H2O(l) →base + H2(g)
Active metal + acid →salt + H2(g)
Carbonate + acid →CO2(g) + H2O(l) + salt
Base + salt →metal hydroxide precipitate + salt
Strong base + salt containing NH4 →NH3 + H2O + salt
• Redox reactions are outlined in detail in Chapter 19. They typically involve the
transfer of electrons between one reactant and the other. The species that loses
the electrons is oxidized and that which gains the electrons is reduced. The
mnemonics “LEO and GER” or “OIL RIG” will help you remember this information.
Dealing with the numbers that flow 
from stoichiometry
Coming up with accurate formulas and reaction equation isn’t the end of the story — it’s
usually just the beginning. Once you’ve got an equation, you’ve got to make sure that it’s bal-
anced, and then use the correct stoichiometry to solve problems. These tips deal with that
process.
144
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

 Avogadro’s number, 6.022 × 1023, is equivalent to the number of particles in one mole of
a substance. By “particles” we mean atoms, ions, or molecules — whichever is relevant
for the circumstance.
 The gram atomic, molecular, or formula mass of a substance is calculated by adding up
the atomic masses of all of its components (multiplying by the number of atoms of
each substance present where applicable). It’s equivalent to the mass in grams of one
mole of particles of that substance.
 At standard temperature and pressure, one mole of an ideal gas would occupy 22.4
liters volume. No gases are truly ideal (see Chapter 9 on gas laws for further details).
However, this approximation is a very good one in many cases and is very useful in
converting volume to moles of a gas and vice versa.
 The percent composition of a substance takes into account the mass ratios of the
atoms that make it up as well as the ratios in which they combine. To calculate a per-
cent composition of a molecular or ionic compound, calculate the gram molecular or
gram formula mass of the compound. Then, calculate the mass of each type of atom in
the substance (by multiplying the mass by the number of atoms present in each mole-
cule) and divide by the total mass of the compound. 
 You can also use percent compositions to find the formula of a compound, though it is
a somewhat complicated process. If you follow the five following steps, you’ll get it
every time.
1. Assume that you have 100g of the unknown compound. 
2. Convert the assumed masses from Step 1 into moles by using gram atomic
masses.
3. Divide each of the element-by-element mole quantities from Step 2 by the
lowest among them.
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the
smallest possible factor that produces whole-number mole ratios for all of the
elements.
5. Write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as
subscripts to the chemical symbol of each element. Order the elements accord-
ing to the general rules for naming ionic and molecular compounds (described
in Chapter 5).
 Given an empirical formula and either a formula or molar mass for a compound, you
can also determine its molecular formula by dividing the gram formula mass by the
empirical formula mass and then by taking this whole number value and multiplying
the subscripts for each atom in the empirical formula by that number.
 Before you take the AP exam, make sure you’ve mastered the method for balancing
equations. Unless the AP exam tells you that an equation is balanced, always check.
To check that an equation is properly balanced, simply count the total number of each
type of atom on each side of the equation and make sure that they match. Also be sure
to check that any total charges on each side are balanced.
 Always consider the possibility of limiting reagents in reactions. Limiting reagents
determine theoretical yields. Percent yield is 100 percent times the actual yield divided
by the theoretical yield.

15. Calculate the percent composition of each element in caffeine C8H10N4.
Checking Your Work
Still on your feet? Good. Now check with the judges and receive your score. If you faltered,
find out why. If you triumphed, enjoy it.
1. (B). This reaction is the only one where electrons are gained by the reactant to form the
product, a sure sign of a reduction reaction. The negative sign on the chlorine is an indicator
that extra electrons are present, and the fact that the reactant is of neutral charge cements
the reaction as reduction.
2. (D). Begin by finding the percent composition of lithium in pure lithium sulfate, 
14.0g ÷ 110g = 12.7%. Impurities, however, have driven the lithium concentration down
to 10.2% lithium. Dividing this percentage by the first will give you the percent of the pure
compound in the sample. 10.2 ÷ 12.7 = 80.3%, which is closest to answer choice D.
3. (B). There are two tricks to balancing an equation like this. The first is to begin by balanc-
ing the polyatomic ions, in this case SO4 and OH–. But where is the OH– among the products?
This point is the second important one. In balancing equations, particularly neutralization
reactions like this one, it is often extremely useful to write H2O as HOH. The fully balanced
equation here is H2SO4 + Ca(OH)2 →CaSO4 + 2H2O. That’s right. Water is the only component
that takes a subscript greater than 1, and that subscript is 2.
4. (C). Here you’re given a percent composition and are asked to derive an empirical formula.
Follow the steps outlined in Chapter 13 to accomplish this task. Or, since the answers are
right in front of you and percent composition is really a fairly easy calculation to make, you
can simply calculate the percent composition of hydrogen in each of the compounds among
the answer choices and see which one matches the question. You will find that this answer is
choice C, pentane.
5. (E). Calculate the empirical formula mass of CH2O (30g per mole) and divide the molar
mass by it, giving you 180 ÷ 30 = 6. Multiply each of the subscripts in the empirical formula to
give you the molecular formula C6H12O6, answer choice E.
6. (D). First, identify the limiting reagent in the reaction. Converting grams of iron (III) oxide
to grams of carbon reveals that 56.4g of carbon are needed to react completely with 500.g of
iron (III) oxide.

This discovery means that there is excess carbon among the reactants and iron oxide should
be used as the limiting reagent. With this established, all that remains is to convert grams of
iron (III) oxide to grams of the iron product according to the calculation 
This matches answer choice D.
7. (B). Remember that you must convert to moles first and cannot convert directly from par-
ticles to grams. Set up your three conversion factors as follows and you get an answer
matching answer choice B.
8. (C). This choice represents a double replacement reaction. The first thing that you will
need to do is deduce the charge on the silver. As a diligent AP chemistry student, you should
already have memorized the charges on the common polyatomic ions and know that NO3 car-
ries a charge of –1. Your excellent powers of deduction should then lead you to the conclu-
sion that you are dealing with Ag+, whose charge balances that of NO3
– in a 1:1 ratio. When
silver and potassium switch places, the silver and chlorine and potassium and nitrate will all
combine in 1:1 ratios, giving the products AgCl and KNO3, which is consistent with answer
choice C.
9. (A). By telling you that NaOH is present in excess, the problem saves you from having to
do a limiting reagent calculation. All you need to do now is to convert grams of HCl, your lim-
iting reagent, to grams of the NaCl product as in the calculation
Be careful, though, that you’ve read the problem carefully. It does not ask for the theoretical
yield or the percent yield, but the difference between the theoretical and actual yields.
Subtract the two to get 48.1g – 41.0g = 7.1g, answer choice A.
10. For all of the conversions in this problem, be careful to set up your conversion factors so
that the units cancel correctly.

11. (a) The complete, balanced reaction here is FeS(s) + 2HCl(aq) →FeCl2(aq) + H2S(g).
However, the problem has asked you to eliminate spectators and also allows you to ignore
balancing. Chlorine is the only spectator here, so eliminating it from both sides leaves you
with FeS(s) + H+(aq) →Fe2+(aq) + H2S(g).
(b) This reaction does not take place in solution, so there will not be any spectators. Recall
that all combustion reactions require the reactant O2 and that the products are always water
and carbon dioxide. With this knowledge, you are left with CH4 + O2 →CO2 + H2O, which you
do not need to balance. In minimal air, some CO will form.
(c) Since this substance is “strongly heated” you should be able to identify it as a decomposi-
tion reaction immediately. If one of the products is CO2, the remaining product must be CaO,
giving you the reaction CaCO3 →CaO + CO2.
(d) This is a double replacement reaction of the pattern. KOH (aq) + NH4Cl(s) →NH4OH(aq) +
KCl(aq). You know that both of the products are soluble because one contains ammonium
and the other contains an alkali metal, salts of both of which are always soluble. Eliminating
spectators, this leaves you with the equation NH4Cl(s) →NH4
+(aq) + Cl– (aq).
(e) This is both a single replacement reaction and a redox reaction. Iron is more reactive
than copper and so displaces it in solution. (Recall that you are to assume that a reaction
always occurs in this type of problem, so even if you didn’t remember that iron was higher
than copper on the reactivity series, you could still treat it as such.) Eliminating spectators,
your net equation is Fe(s) + Cu2+(aq) →Cu(s) + Fe2+(aq).
(f) Nothing happens here — fluorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine.
(g) This double replacement reaction follows the equation H2SO4(aq) + Sr(NO3)2(s) →
HNO3(aq ) + SrSO4(s), where you know that strontium sulfate is a precipitate because it is
insoluble. Eliminating spectators, you are left with the equation SO4
2–(aq) + Sr(NO3)2(s) →
NO3
–(aq) + SrSO4(s).
(h) This is a combustion/combination reaction in which a metal is burned to create a metal
oxide according to the equation. Cu(s) + O2(g) →CuO(s).
12. (a) (i) This is one of those seven acid/base reactions outlined earlier in the chapter in
which an acid and carbonate mix to form three products: water, carbon dioxide, and a salt. In
this case, the reaction is therefore NaHCO3(s) + HNO3(aq) →CO2(g) + H2O(l) + NaNO3(aq).
Both the nitric acid and the sodium nitrate product will be significantly dissociated in water,
leaving you with the equation NaHCO3(s) + H+(aq) + NO3
– (aq) →CO2(g) + H2O(l) + Na+(aq) +
NO3
–(aq). NO3
– is the only spectator ion here, so the final equation is NaHCO3 + H+ →CO2 +
H2O + Na+. Note that you do not need to include phases in your final answer.
(ii) Convert mass of nitric acid to mass of sodium bicarbonate as follows. 
(b) (i) Magnesium is the oxidizing agent, so it must be reduced (gain electrons) in the reac-
tion. Lead (II) is the reducing agent, so it must be oxidized (lose electrons) in the reaction.
This leaves you with the net reaction. Mg2+ + Pb2+ →Mg + Pb4+.
(ii) As a solid, magnesium will be on the paper. If the lead salt formed is insoluble then it may
also be on the paper. Either way, Mg(s) will precipitate.

(c) (i) This reaction also follows one of the seven acid/base reaction types listed earlier, this
time the base + salt →metal hydroxide precipitate + salt. In other words, this is a relatively
simple double replacement reaction. The complete, balanced reaction is 2NaOH(aq) +
CuSO4(aq) →Cu(OH)2(s) + Na2SO4(aq). Sodium and sulfate both appear in aqueous
solution on both sides of the equation, so eliminating them as spectators, you are left
with 2OH– + Cu2+ →Cu(OH)2.
(ii) 40%. The percent composition of oxygen can be calculated by dividing the total number
of grams per mole of oxygen by the molecular mass of sodium hydroxide. This results in
16g÷40g×100 = 40%.
13. (a) Lithium is a very reactive metal and is significantly higher than hydrogen on the activ-
ity series and is therefore bound to displace it in a reaction. Copper, however, is lower than
hydrogen on the activity series and therefore will not replace it.
(b) Both carbon and oxygen are more abundant in the human body than hydrogen by mass
because even though there are many more hydrogen atoms than either carbon or oxygen
atoms, hydrogen is the lightest of the elements. Carbon is 12 times more massive and oxygen
is 16 times more massive than hydrogen.
(c) Simply speaking, water can act as both an acid and a base because it contains both an
acid’s characteristic hydrogen and the hydroxide ion common to most bases. Another way to
look at it is that water can accept or donate a proton.
14. (a) Na2SO3.To find the empirical formula from the percent composition, follow the steps
outlined in Chapter 13. Begin by assuming that you have a total of 100g of the substance,
which means that you have 36.5g sodium, 25.4g sulfur and 38.1g oxygen. Divide each of these
by their gram atomic masses as follows:
Next, divide each of these by the lowest among them (1.12), giving 1.59mol Na ÷ 0.79 = 2.0mol
Na, 0.79mol S ÷ 0.79 = 1.0mol S, and 2.38mol O ÷ 0.79 = 3.0mol O. Attach each of these as sub-
scripts on your empirical formula Na2SO3. This is your empirical formula.
(b) Na6S3O9. You are given the molar mass and will need to divide it by the empirical formula
mass in order to find your conversion factor from the empirical to molecular formulae. The
empirical formula mass of Na2SO3 is 122.1g per mole. 366.3 divided by 122.1 is 3. Multiply
each of the subscripts in the empirical formula by this number to arrive at the molecular
formula of Na6S3O9.
15. 59.3% C, 6.2%H and 34.6%N. Begin all percent composition calculations by finding the
mass per mole of each type of atom in the substance by multiplying the number of each
atom present by its gram atomic mass. In this case, you get 8 × 12.0g = 96g C, 10 × 1.0g = 10.0g
H, and 4 × 14.0g = 56.0g N. Next calculate the molar mass of the compound by adding these
three values together (96.0 + 10.0 + 56.0 = 162.0g). Finally, divide each of the individual
masses by this molar mass and multiply by 100 to give you the percent composition. You
should get 59.3% C, 6.2% H, and 34.6% N.

E
quilibrium . . . it’s a pleasant-sounding word. What does it mean? In everyday language,
equilibrium connotes calmness and composure, or some state of balance. The chemical
definition of equilibrium most closely mirrors the last of these meanings: balance. In this
chapter, we describe how the idea of balance applies to chemical reactions.
Shifting Matter: An Overview of Chemical
Equilibrium
On the microscopic scale, most reactions can occur in both the “forward” and “reverse”
directions. When we say that a reaction is “going forward,” what we mean is that the rate of
the forward reaction is larger than the rate of the reverse reaction (see Figure 15-1); in other
words, at any given moment more reactant mass converts into product than there is product
mass converting back into reactant. Remember, chemical reactions simply convert a given
amount of mass between states.
Given enough time, a closed chemical system (one protected from outside influences) reaches
a state in which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, as
shown in Figure 15-2. On the microscopic scale, chemistry occurs constantly in both direc-
tions, but on the larger, “macroscopic” scale, the reaction appears to be “at rest.” We call this
state of chemical balance dynamic equilibrium.

Once a chemical system achieves equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products
no longer change (macroscopically, at least). The resulting combination of concentrations is
called an equilibrium mixture, and can be used to characterize the reaction, as will be shown
in a later section. Whether the equilibrium mixture contains more products or more reac-
tants (and to what extent) depends on differences in energy between reactants and products.
The details of this energy-equilibrium relationship are described in detail in Chapter 21.
Predicting Shifts with Le Chatelier’s Principle
After a chemical system has reached equilibrium, that equilibrium can be disrupted, or per-
turbed. Think of systems at equilibrium as people who have finally found their easy chair at
the end of a long day. You may rouse them to take out the trash, but they’ll return to the easy
chair at the first opportunity. This concept is more or less the idea behind Le Chatelier’s
Principle: The equilibrium of a perturbed system shifts in the direction that opposes the per-
turbation. Perturbations include changes in the following:
 Concentration: If a system is at equilibrium, adding or removing reactant or product
disrupts the equilibrium. Roused from its easy chair, the equilibrium reasserts itself in
response.
• If reactant is added or product is removed, reactant converts into product.
• If product is added or reactant is removed, product converts into reactant.
Either way, chemistry occurs until concentrations are those of the equilibrium mixture
once more. In other words, the equilibrium shifts to oppose the perturbation, as shown
in Figure 15-3.
 Pressure: Reactions that include gases as reactants and/or products are particularly
sensitive to pressure perturbation. If pressure is suddenly increased, equilibrium shifts
toward the side of the reaction that contains fewer moles of gas, thereby decreasing
pressure. If pressure is suddenly decreased, equilibrium shifts toward the side of the
reaction that contains more moles of gas, thereby increasing pressure. Consider the fol-
lowing reaction:

Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

A given amount of mass on the reactant side of the equation (as N2 and H2) corre-
sponds to double the moles of gas as the same mass on the product side (as NH3).
Imagine that the system is at equilibrium at a low pressure. Now imagine that the pres-
sure suddenly increases, perturbing that equilibrium. Reactant (N2 and H2) converts to
product (NH3) so the total moles of gas decrease, thereby lowering the pressure.
If the system suddenly shifts to lower pressure, NH3 converts to N2 and H2 so the total
moles of gas increase, thereby raising the pressure. The equilibrium shifts to oppose
the perturbation. These responses are summarized in Figure 15-4.
 Temperature: Reactions that absorb or give off heat (that is, most reactions) can be
perturbed from equilibrium by changes in temperature. The easiest way to under-
stand this behavior is to explicitly include heat as a reactant or product in the reaction
equation:
A + B  C + heat
Imagine that this reaction is at equilibrium. Now imagine that the temperature sud-
denly increases. Product C absorbs heat, converting to reactants A and B. Because the
heat “product” has been decreased, the temperature of the system decreases. 
If the temperature suddenly shifts down from equilibrium, reactants A and B convert to
product C, releasing heat. The released heat increases the temperature of the system.
The equilibrium shifts to oppose the perturbation. These responses of the equilibrium
to changes in temperature are reviewed in Figure 15-5.

Chapter 15: Going Nowhere: Equilibrium

What is the effect of adding a catalyst on an equilibrium mixture? Precisely nothing.
Catalysts may help speed the journey to the equilibrium mixture, but they have no effect
on its composition.
What if the reaction starts on one “side” of the equilibrium mixture as opposed to the other
side? In other words, what if the same reaction starts from an “all reactants” state versus an
“all products” state? Given time, each reaction will find its way to the same equilibrium mix-
ture. In science, that kind of beautiful symmetry is known as a Satisfying Result. 
So, by using Le Chatelier’s Principle, you can predict the direction in which an equilibrium
will shift in response to a perturbation. But how far will the equilibrium shift? And where
exactly was the equilibrium “resting” in the first place? The answers to these quantitative
questions involve a new quantity: the equilibrium constant. You can find more information
on the equilibrium constant in the following section.
Measuring Equilibrium: The Equilibrium Constant
In a previous section, we mentioned that the composition of an equilibrium mixture (that is,
the concentrations of the reactants and products when the system is at equilibrium) could
be used to characterize the reaction. In this section, we discuss the connection between con-
centrations and equilibrium in great detail.
Understanding the equilibrium constant, Keq
In essence, the greater the equilibrium concentration of products relative to reactants, the
more spontaneous is the reaction. Spontaneous (or “favorable”) reactions favor products.
Nonspontaneous (or “unfavorable”) reactions favor reactants. To quantitate the tendency of
a reaction to proceed toward products, we use the equilibrium constant, Keq. For the following
reaction
aA + bB  cC + dD
the equilibrium constant is calculated as follows:

Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

In general, concentrations of the products are multiplied together in the numerator.
Concentrations of the reactants are multiplied together in the denominator. Stoichiometric
coefficients show up as exponents on their corresponding reactants or products. Once actual
values (that is, concentrations from an equilibrium mixture) are entered for each concentra-
tion and coefficient, the whole expression reduces to a single number, one ranging from zero
to infinity. Real-life values always occupy the middle ground between these two extremes.
Whatever it is, that final number has meaning.
Very favorable reactions produce a lot of product, so they have Keq values much larger than 1.
Very unfavorable reactions convert very little reactant into product, so they have Keq values
between 0 and 1. In a reaction with Keq = 1, the amount of product equals the amount of reac-
tant at equilibrium.
Note that you can only calculate Keq by using concentrations measured at equilibrium.
Concentrations measured before a reaction reaches equilibrium can be used to calculate a
reaction quotient, Q:
If Q < Keq, the reaction will progress “to the right,” making more product. If Q > Keq, the reac-
tion will shift “to the left,” converting product into reactant. If Q = Keq, the reaction is at equi-
librium. Because equilibria are temperature dependent, the Keq at one temperature may be
the Q at another temperature.
You may have noticed that the expression given for calculating the Keq lists each reactant or
product within brackets, as in [X]. If those brackets look unfamiliar, you’ll want to review
Chapter 11, where you’ll learn that they indicate the molar concentration of a solute, 
M = mol L-1. 
But what if you’re dealing with a gas phase reaction, like the one pictured in Figure 15-4?
Well, in that case you’ll work with partial pressures of the reactant and product gases (see
Chapter 9), and the expression for Keq is:
Fine, you say, but what if my reaction includes some combination of liquids, gases, and liquid
or gas solutions? And what about solids? Relax, there’s an answer—but it comes at the price
of some new vocabulary:
Homogenous equilbria contain reactants and products that are all of the same phase. These
are the easiest cases because you can simply apply the Keq expression directly, as already
described.
Heterogeneous equilibria contain reactants and products of different phases. You can still cal-
culate Keq for such reactions, but you’ve got to follow a few simple rules:
 Pure liquids and pure solids are omitted from the Keq expression of a heterogeneous
equilibrium; these concentrations simply equal 1. This includes the solvent (such as
H2O in the case of aqueous solutions), even if solvent molecules are directly involved in
the chemistry of the reaction. The solvent is present in such high concentration that
its involvement as a reactant or product doesn’t change its concentration.
 Partial pressures (P) of reactant or product gases and molar concentrations (M) of
reactant or product solutes can appear together in the Keq expression, because their
concentrations may change significantly during the course of a reaction.

Using Keq to solve problems
Some equilibrium problems don’t simply list final, equilibrium concentrations, but instead
give you a combination of initial concentrations, final concentrations, and possibly the Keq
itself. At this point, you may have developed that sinking feeling in your stomach that sug-
gests that all this can get pretty complicated. Not to worry; you just need to be organized.
Follow these steps for dealing with equilibrium problems that confuse you:
1. Start with a balanced equation for the reaction, including the phases of the reac-
tants and products.
For example
NH4Cl(s)  NH3(g) + HCl(g)
2. Check the phases to see if you’re dealing with a homogenous equilibrium or a het-
erogeneous equilibrium. If you’ve got a heterogeneous equilibrium on your hands,
cross out any pure (unmixed) liquid or solid substances to ensure that you omit them
from the final Keq expression. Continuing with the example introduced in step 1:
NH4Cl(s)  NH3(g) + HCl(g)
3. Set up the Keq expression, including the actual Keq value, if known (0.036 in this
case):
Keq = (P NH3)(P HCl) = 0.036
4. Underneath each remaining reactant or product, list the following quantities, in
order: initial concentration/partial pressure, change in concentration/partial pres-
sure and equilibrium concentration/partial pressure. Leave unknown quantities
blank.
The resulting table might look like this:
NH4Cl(s)
↔
NH3(g)
+
HCl(g)
Initial:
1
0atm
0.072atm
Change:
1
+xatm
+xatm
Equilibrium:
1
xatm
0.072 + xatm
This kind of table is known as an ICEbox, drawing on the initials of the quantities in the three
rows: Initial, Change, and Equilibrium. How exactly you fill in the ICEbox depends on which
values are known and which are unknown. In the given example, the partial pressures of both
product gases were known. By examining the balanced equation, it is clear that any changes
in NH3 and HCl products occur in a one-to-one ratio, because each product has a stoichiomet-
ric coefficient of 1. So, the unknown change in partial pressure (x) experienced by the gases
en route to equilibrium is the same for each gas. Having filled in the blanks for Initial and
Change, the Equilibrium values are calculated as the sum of the two. Just substitute the
“Equilibrium” values into the Keq expression and solve for the unknown:
Keq = (x)(0.072 + x) = 0.036
x2 + 0.072x – 0.036 = 0
(a quadratic equation)
x = 0.16 OR x = –0.23
Solving the quadratic equation gives two possible values for x. We can exclude the –0.23 solu-
tion because it results in negative values for the partial pressures, which is a physical impos-
sibility. So, x = 0.16atm is the solution. Therefore, the equilibrium mixture of the reaction
contains 0.16atm NH3 and 0.072 + 0.16 = 0.23atm of HCl.
158
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Here are a few additional tips for working with equilibrium constants:
 Equilibrium constants for the “forward” and “reverse” directions of the same reaction
are simply inverses of each other:
If . . . Keq for Reactants  Products is Kforward
And . . . Keq for Products  Reactants is Kreverse
Then . . . Kforward = (Kreverse)–1
 Multiple equilibria can be connected or “coupled” when a product from one equilibrium
is the reactant for another. The equilibrium constant for the overall, coupled reaction is
the product of the equilibrium constants for the component reactions:
If . . . Keq for A  B is KAB
And . . . Keq for B  C is KBC
Then . . . Keq for A  C is KAC = (KAB)(KBC)
Specializing Equilibrium: Constants for
Different Reaction Types
In previous sections of this chapter, we discussed how to calculate the Keq for gas phase reac-
tions by using the partial pressures of the gases in an equilibrium mixture. That’s great stuff,
as far as it goes. But consider this: In a constant-volume system, increasing the total concen-
tration of a gas also increases its partial pressure. So what? The upshot of this fact is that cal-
culating the equilibrium constant in terms of pressures can sometimes give a value of Keq
different from the one you’d get if you calculated in terms of molar concentrations. To
account for this discrepancy, chemists sometimes use the quantities KP and KC to make
clear whether a gas phase equilibrium constant was calculated using pressure or molar
concentration, repectively.
Is there any reliable relationship between KP and KC? Yes:
KP = KC  (RT)∆n
In this equation, the exponent (n corresponds to the difference in the moles of gas between
the product and reactant sides of the reaction equation. For example, in the reaction
2NH3(g)  N2(g) + 3H2(g)
the exponent ∆n = nproduct – nreactant = 4 – 2 = 2. 
Other kinds of specialized equilibrium constants you’ll encounter are acid and base dissocia-
tion constants, Ka and Kb, and the solubility product constant, Ksp.
Ka and Kb are discussed at length in Chapter 17. Here, you need only understand that they
are the equilibrium constants that correspond to acid dissociation and base dissociation
reactions. 
 Strong acids possess large values of Ka.
 Strong bases possess large values of Kb. 
159
Chapter 15: Going Nowhere: Equilibrium

Ksp is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction of an ionic solid as it dissolves.
This constant is discussed in the context of solutions and solute concentrations in Chapter 11.
Here, we simply show how Ksp fits under the umbrella of “equilibrium constant” and discuss
how Ksp relates to a phenomenon called the common ion effect.
When an ionic solid (such as silver bomide) dissolves, its cation and anion components
separate:
AgBr(s) + H2O(l)  Ag+(aq) + Br–(aq)
Because AgBr is a pure solid and H2O is the solvent, those two compounds are assigned con-
centrations of 1, and effectively fall out of the equilibrium constant expression, such that:
Ksp = [Ag+][Br–]
This equation shows that
 The Ksp is the product of the concentrations of the dissolved ions. 
 Very soluble compounds possess large Ksp values.
 Very insoluble compounds possess small Ksp values.
The solubility product governs the common ion effect, a shift in the solubility equilibrium of a
dissolved ionic solid upon the addition of a second compound, one that contains an ion in
common with the first compound. For example, if sodium bromide, NaBr, is added to a solu-
tion of silver bromide, AgBr, a certain amount of dissolved silver bromide shifts back into
solid form and precipitates from solution.
Why? Adding sodium bromide results in the addition of Br– to solution. This addition perturbs
the silver bromide equilibrium, effectively adding Br– “product.” To oppose this perturbation,
the equilibrium shifts mass toward the AgBr “reactant” side, as shown in Figure 15-6. How far
does the equilibrium shift? How much AgBr precipitates? Answer: AgBr precipitates until the
concentrations of Ag+ and Br– in solution once again match the Ksp for silver bromide.

hapter 15 explained the teeterings and totterings of chemical equilibrium. This topic
is a conceptual octopus, wrapping its long tentacles around a variety of other topics.
In other words, knowing equilibrium well helps you to understand other things well.
So, embrace the octopus, and give these practice questions a try.  
Leveling Out the Facts on Equilibrium
Understanding equilibrium helps you to predict how a reaction at rest will respond to a
change in conditions. Making these predictions requires you to understand some things
about the reactants and products, such as what phase they are in, and whether heat acts as a
reactant or product in the reaction. Different categories of reactions sometimes receive the
high honor of an equilibrium constant with its own special name. The following points sum-
marize the most important concepts and details about equilibrium. 
Defining equilibrium
Like other concepts in chemistry, equilibrium is an important idea that is often expressed by
using equations. These points describe equilibrium both verbally and mathematically. 
 Chemical equilibrium is “dynamic equilibrium,” in which forward and reverse reactions
occur at the same rate. 
 Equilibrium constants for forward and reverse reactions are inverses of one another.
 The equilibrium constant for a coupled reaction is equal to the product of the equilib-
rium constants for each individual reaction.
 The equilibrium constant Keq quantifies the tendency of a reaction to favor products.
Keq is calculated by taking the concentrations of products raised to the power of their
coefficients divided by the concentrations of reactants raised to their coefficients.
Thus a reaction of the form aA + bB  cC + dD will have a Keq = [A]a[B]b÷([C]c[D]d).

162
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 
 If you are dealing with a reaction between gases, then you will use the expression 
 If a Keq value is significantly greater than 1, that is an indication that the reaction favors
the product heavily. Keq values between 0 and 1 indicate that reactants are favored. A
Keq value equal to 1 indicates that at equilibrium, the product of the concentrations of
reactants (raised to the appropriate powers) is equal to the product of concentrations
of products (raised to the appropriate powers). Note the individual concentrations
themselves do not have to be equal for this to be true!
 Reactions in which all of the products and reactants are in the same phase are subject
to homogeneous equilibrium and Keq is calculated normally. If, however, the products
and reactants are in more than one phase, you will have to apply the rules of heteroge-
neous equilibrium, which are as follows:
• Pure liquids (including solvents) and solids are omitted from the Keq expression.
• Partial pressures of gases take the place of concentrations in the Keq expression and
both concentrations and partial pressures may appear in the same expression.
Predicting the shifting
Equilibria are all about rest. If you rouse them, they oppose you, shifting toward reactants or
products — whatever it takes — to get back to their bean bag chairs. Here’s how they do it:
 Le Chatelier’s Principle describes the tendency of reactions to act to reverse
perturbations:
• Concentration: If reactant is added or product is removed, the forward reaction
will be favored. If product is added or reactant is removed, the reverse reaction
will be favored.
• Pressure: If pressure is increased, the reaction will favor the side with fewer
moles of gas. If the pressure is decreased, the reaction will favor the side with
more moles of gas.
• Temperature: A decrease in temperature will cause the reaction to favor the side
that releases more heat. An increase in temperature will cause the reaction to
favor the side that does not release heat.
• Catalysts: Catalysts speed reactions but do not affect the concentration of prod-
ucts or reactants at equilibrium.
 If you are given a mixture of initial and final concentrations, use the following five steps
to avoid confusion in solving the problem:
• Step 1: Start with a balanced equation for the reaction, including the phases of
the reactants and products.
• Step 2: Check the phases to see if you’re dealing with a homogenous equilibrium
or a heterogeneous equilibrium. If you’ve got a heterogeneous equilibrium on
your hands, cross out any pure (unmixed) liquid or solid substances to ensure
that you omit them from the final Keq expression.
• Step 3: Set up the Keq expression, including the actual Keq value, if known.

Use known values to fill in the empty slots in the ICEbox.
• Step 5: Substitute the “Equilibrium” values into the Keq expression and solve for
the unknown.
Special constants
Several different quantities are all calculated just like Keq, but go by other names. In most
cases, these quantities are in fact Keq values, putting on airs because they think they’re spe-
cial enough to deserve their own titles. In another case (the reaction quotient, Q), the special
title occurs because the reaction quotient is not an equilibrium quantity at all. 
 The expressions KP and Kc are used to distinguish between gaseous phase equilibrium
constants in which partial pressures were used (KP) or molar concentrations (Kc). The
relationship between the two is KP = KC × (RT)∆n, where ∆n corresponds to the difference
in the moles of gas between the product and reactant sides of the reaction equation.
 Other specialized equilibrium constants are discussed in Chapter 11 (Ksp) and 17 (Ka
and Kb). Ksp is simply the equilibrium constant for a dissolution reaction. Ka and Kb are
simply the equilibrium constants for acid or base dissociation. 
 Keq is only valid for a reaction that has reached equilibrium. A similar quantity called
the reaction quotient Q is used when the reaction is not at equilibrium. If Q < Keq, the
reaction will progress “to the right,” making more product. If Q > Keq, the reaction
will shift “to the left,” converting product into reactant. If Q = Keq, the reaction is at
equilibrium.

2. (E). Kp is used for gases.
3. (B). The solubility product constant Ksp is used for the dissociation of ionic solids.
4. (A). Ka can be used to calculate pH in a solution of an acid or a base.
165
Chapter 16: Answering Questions on Equilibrium

5. (D). Decreasing the pressure will favor the side with the greater number of moles of gas
(the reactants here). Adding products and removing reactants will also act to favor the pro-
duction of reactants (the reverse reaction) so all three are valid.
6. (D). You eliminate all pure solids and liquids from heterogeneous equilibrium constant
expressions, so D is the correct answer.
7. (C). The Keq of a reverse reaction can be calculated by taking the inverse of the forward
reaction. 1 ÷ (8.3 × 10–7) = 1.2 × 106.
8. (C). The equilibrium constant expression is 
9. (A). The Ksp expression for the dissociation of Ni(OH)2 is Ksp = [Ni2+][OH–]2. You also know
that for every one nickel ion that dissolves in solution, there must be 2 OH– ions so [Ni2+] =
0.50[OH–]. Call this concentration X and plug it into the Ksp expression and you have 6.0 ×
10–16 = 0.50X × X2. Solve this expression for X and you should get 1.06 × 10–5 = X, but as stated
before, [Ni2+] is half of that value, which is 5.3 × 10–6.
10. (E). You will need to use the expression KP = KC × (RT)∆n. The only tricky parts to applying
this equation are to remember to convert your temperature to K (623K) and to correctly
solve for ∆n. Do this by subtracting the number of moles of gaseous reactants from the
number of moles of gaseous products, giving you 3 – 2 = 1. Your expression then becomes 
KP = 8.90 × (0.0821 × 623)1 = 455.
11. (a) Neglecting the pure liquid H2O, the equilibrium constant expression becomes

f you’ve read any comic books, watched any superhero flicks, or even tuned in to one of
those fictional solve-the-crime-in-50-minutes shows on TV, you’ve likely come across a
reference to acids being dangerous substances. Acids are generally thought of as something
that evil villains intend to spray in the face of a hero or heroine, but somehow usually
manage to spill on themselves. However, you encounter and even ingest a wide variety of
fairly innocuous acids in everyday life. Citric acid, present in citrus fruits, such as lemons
and oranges, is very ingestible, as is acetic acid, a.k.a. vinegar.
Strong acids can indeed burn the skin and must be handled with care in the laboratory.
However, strong bases can burn skin as well. Chemists must have a more sophisticated
understanding of the difference between an acid and a base and their relative strengths than
simply their propensity to burn. This chapter focuses on how you can identify acids and
bases, as well as several ways to determine their strengths, all of which are fair game on the
AP chemistry exam.
Thinking Acidly: Three Different Ways 
to Define Acid-Base Behavior
As chemists came to understand acids and bases as more than just “stuff that burns,” their
understanding of how to define them evolved as well. It’s often said that acids taste sour,
while bases taste bitter, but we do not recommend that you go around tasting chemicals in
the laboratory to identify them as acids or bases. In the following sections, we explain three
much safer methods you can use to tell the difference between the two.

Method 1: Arrhenius sticks to the basics
Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish chemist who is credited not only with the acid-base determi-
nation method that is named after him, but with an even more fundamental chemical
concept: that of dissociation. Arrhenius proposed an explanation in his PhD thesis for a phe-
nomenon that, at the time, had chemists all over the world scratching their heads. What had
them perplexed was this: Although neither pure salt nor pure water are good conductors of
electricity, solutions in which salts are dissolved in water tend to be excellent conductors
of electricity.
Arrhenius proposed that aqueous solutions of salts conducted electricity because the
bonds between atoms in the salts had been broken simply by mixing them into the water,
forming ions. Although the ion had been defined several decades earlier by Michael Faraday,
chemists generally believed at the time that ions could only form through electrolysis, or the
breaking of chemical bonds using electric currents, so Arrhenius’s theory was met with some
skepticism. Ironically, although his thesis committee wasn’t overly impressed and gave him a
grade just barely sufficient to pass, Arrhenius eventually managed to win over the scientific
community with his research. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for the
same ideas that nearly cost him his doctorate.
Arrhenius subsequently expanded his theories to form one of the most widely used and
straightforward definitions of acids and bases. Arrhenius said that acids are substances that
form hydrogen (H+) ions when they dissociate in water, while bases are substances that form
hydroxide (OH–) ions when they dissociate in water. 
Peruse Table 17-1 for a list of common acids and bases and note that all of the acids in the
list contain a hydrogen and most of the bases contain a hydroxide. The Arrhenius definition
of acids and bases is very straightforward and works for many common acids and bases, but
it’s limited by its narrow definition of bases.

Method 2: Brønsted-Lowry tackles 
bases without a hydroxide ion
You no doubt noticed that some of the bases in Table 17-1 do not contain a hydroxide ion,
which means that the Arrhenius definition of acids and bases can’t apply. When chemists real-
ized that several substances without a hydroxide ion still behaved like bases, they reluctantly
168
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

acknowledged that another determination method was needed. Independently proposed by
Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry in 1923 and therefore named after both of them, the
Brønsted-Lowry method for determining acids and bases accounts for those pesky non-
hydroxide containing bases.
Under the Brønsted-Lowry definition, an acid is a substance that donates a hydrogen-ion (H+)
in an acid-base reaction, while a base is a substance that accepts that hydrogen ion from the
acid. When ionized to form a hydrogen cation (an atom with a positive charge), hydrogen
loses its one and only electron and is left with only a single proton. For this reason, Brønsted-
Lowry acids are often called proton donors and Brønsted-Lowry bases are called proton
acceptors.
The best way to spot Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases is to keep careful track of hydrogen ions
in a chemical equation. Consider, for example, the dissociation of the base sodium carbonate in
water. Note that although sodium carbonate is a base, it doesn’t contain a hydroxide ion.
NaCO3 + H2O →H2CO3 + NaOH
This is a simple double replacement reaction (see Chapter 13 for an introduction to these
types of reactions). A hydrogen ion from water switches places with the sodium of sodium
carbonate to form the products: carbonic acid and sodium hydroxide. By the Brønsted-
Lowry definition, water is the acid because it gave up its hydrogen to NaCO3. This makes
NaCO3 the base because it accepted the hydrogen ion from H2O.
On the AP exam, if you ever see carbonic acid formed as a product, you will be expected to
know that it breaks down into CO2 and H2O, making this reaction NaCO3 + H2O →H2O + CO2 +
NaOH.
Almost (but not quite) all the acids and bases you will encounter on the AP test will be
Bronsted-Lowry type so master these first.
What about the substances on the righthand side of the equation? Brønsted-Lowry theory calls
the products of an acid-base reaction the conjugate acid and conjugate base. The conjugate acid
is produced when the base accepts a proton (in this case, H2CO3), while the conjugate base is
formed when the acid loses its hydrogen (in this case, NaOH). This reaction also brings up a
very important point about the strength of each of these acids and bases. Although sodium
carbonate is a very strong base, its conjugate acid, carbonic acid, is a very weak acid. Weak
acids always form strong conjugate bases and vice versa. The same is true of strong acids. 
Method 3: Lewis relies on electron pairs
In the same year that Brønsted and Lowry proposed their definition of acids and bases,
an American chemist named Gilbert Lewis proposed an alternate definition that not only
encompassed the Brønsted-Lowry theory, but also accounted for acid-base reactions in
which a hydrogen ion is not exchanged. Lewis’s definition relies on tracking lone pairs of
electrons. Under his theory, a base is any substance that donates a pair of electrons to form
a coordinate covalent bond with another substance, while an acid is a substance that
accepts that electron pair in such a reaction. Recall that a coordinate covalent bond is a
covalent bond in which both of the bonding electrons are donated by one of the atoms form-
ing the bond.
All Brønsted-Lowry acids are Lewis acids, but in practice, the term Lewis acid is generally
reserved for Lewis acids that don’t also fit the Brønsted-Lowry definition. The best way to
spot a Lewis acid/base pair is to draw a Lewis dot structure of the reacting substances,
169
Chapter 17: Giving and Taking in Solution: Acids and Bases

noting the presence of lone pairs of electrons. (We introduce Lewis structures in Chapter 7.)
For example, consider the reaction between ammonia (NH3) and boron trifluoride (BF3):
NH3 + BF3 →NH3BF3
At first glance, neither the reactants nor the product appear to be acids or bases, but the
reactants are revealed as a Lewis acid-base pair when drawn as Lewis dot structures as in
Figure 17-1. Ammonia donates its lone pair of electrons to the bond with boron trifluoride,
making ammonia the Lewis base and boron trifluoride the Lewis acid.
Sometimes you can identify the Lewis acid and base in a compound without drawing the
Lewis dot structure. You can do this by identifying reactants that are electron rich (bases)
or electron poor (acids). Metal cations, for example, are electron poor and tend to act as a
Lewis acid in a reaction, accepting a pair of electrons.
In practice, it’s much simpler to use the Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry definitions of acid and
base, but you’ll need to use the Lewis definition when hydrogen ions aren’t being exchanged.
You can pick and choose among the definitions when you’re asked to identify acid and base
in a reaction.
Describing Acid-Base Equilibria with Constants
Arrhenius’s concept of dissociation gives us another convenient way of measuring the strength
of an acid or base. Although water tends to dissociate all acids and bases, the degree to which
they dissociate depends on their strength. Strong acids such as HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 dissoci-
ate completely in water, while weak acids dissociate only partially. Practically speaking, a weak
acid is any acid that doesn’t dissociate completely in water. Note that while acid-base reactions
do occur in other solvents, the AP exam will only deal with aqueous (water) solutions.
To measure the amount of dissociation occurring when a weak acid is in aqueous solution,
chemists use a constant called the acid dissociation constant (Ka). Ka is a special variety of the
equilibrium constant introduced in Chapter 15. As we explain in Chapter 15, the equilibrium
constant of a chemical reaction is the concentration of products divided by concentration of
reactants and indicates the balance between products and reactants in a reaction. The acid
dissociation constant is simply the equilibrium constant of a reaction in which an acid is
mixed with water and from which the water concentration has been removed. This is done
because the concentration of water is a constant in dilute solutions, and a better indicator
of acidity is the concentration of the dissociated products divided by the concentration of
the acid reactant. The general form of the acid dissociation constant is therefore

Where [HA] is the concentration of the acid before it loses its hydrogen, and [A-] is the con-
centration of its conjugate base. Notice that the concentration of the hydronium ion (H3O+) is
used in place of the concentration of H+, which we use to describe acids earlier in this chap-
ter. In truth, they are one and the same and this is just shorthand for this species, since
“bare” protons never exist in water. Generally speaking, H+ ions in aqueous solution will be
caught up by atoms of water in solution, making H3O+ ions.
A similar situation exists for bases. Strong bases such as KOH, NaOH, and Ca(OH)2 dissociate
completely in water. Weak bases don’t dissociate completely in water, and their strength is
measured by the base dissociation constant, or Kb.
Here, BOH is the base, and B+ is its conjugate acid. This can also be written in terms of the
acid and base:
In problems where you are asked to calculate Kaor Kb, you’ll generally be given the concen-
tration, or molarity, of the original acid or base and the concentration of its conjugate or
hydronium/hydroxide, but rarely both. Dissociation of a single molecule of acid involves the
splitting of that acid into one molecule of its conjugate base and one hydrogen ion, while dis-
sociation of a base always involves the splitting of that base into one molecule of the conju-
gate acid and one hydroxide ion. For this reason, the concentration of the conjugate and the
concentration of the hydronium or hydroxide ion in any dissociation are equal, so you only
need one to know the other. You may also be given the pH and be asked to figure out the [H+]
(equivalent to [H3O+]) or [OH–]. Ka and Kb are also constants at constant temperature.
Remember the above only works if you can assume that only the acid (or base) + water is ini-
taially present. What solutions can be acidic or basic without an acid or base present? Salt
solutions!
In chemistry, a “salt” is not necessarily the substance you sprinkle on French fries, but has a
much broader definition. Rather, a salt is any substance that is a combination of an anion (an
atom with a negative charge) and a cation (an atom with a positive charge) and is created in
a neutralization reaction. Salts, therefore, have a tendency to dissociate in water. The degree
of dissociation possible — in other words, the solubility of the salt — varies greatly from one
salt to another.
Chemists use a quantity called the solubility product constant or Ksp to compare the solubili-
ties of salts. Ksp is calculated in much the same way as an equilibrium constant (Keq). The
product concentrations are multiplied together, each raised to the power of its coefficient in
the balanced dissociation equation. There is one key difference, however, between a Ksp and
a Keq. Ksp is a quantity specific to a saturated solution of salt, so the concentration of the
undissociated salt reactant has absolutely no bearing on its value. If the solution is satu-
rated, then the amount of possible dissociation is at its maximum, and any additional solute
added merely settles on the bottom.
Measuring Acidity and Basicity with pH
A substance’s identity as an acid or a base is only one of many things that a chemist may
need to know about it. Sulfuric acid and water, for example, can both act as acids, but using
sulfuric acid to wash your face in the morning would be a grave error indeed. Sulfuric acid

and water differ greatly in acidity, a measurement of an acid’s strength. A similar quantity,
called basicity, measures a base’s strength.
Acidity and basicity are measured in terms of quantities called pH and pOH, respectively.
Both are simple scales ranging from 0 to 14, with low numbers on the pH scale representing a
higher acidity and therefore a stronger acid. On both scales, a measurement of 7 indicates a
neutral solution. On the pH scale, any number lower than 7 indicates that the solution is
acidic, with acidity increasing as pH decreases, while any number higher than 7 indicates a
basic solution, with basicity increasing as pH increases. In other words, the farther the pH
gets away from 7, the more acidic or basic a substance gets. pOH shows exactly the same
relationship between distance from 7 and acidity or basicity, only this time low numbers indi-
cate very basic solutions, while high numbers indicate very acidic solutions. Both the pH
and the pOH scales are logarithmic, meaning that every time you increase them by 1, the
concentration of H+ or OH- in the solution increases by 10. An acid with a pH of 1 has 100
times more H+ ions than and acid with a pH of 3.
pH is calculated using the formula pH = –log[H+], where the brackets around H+ indicate that
it’s a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (or molarity; see
Chapter 11). pOH is calculated using a similar formula, with OH– concentration replacing the H+
concentration: pOH = –log[OH–]. (The word log in each formula stands for base 10 logarithm.)
Because a substance with high acidity must have low basicity, a low pH (high acidity) indi-
cates a high pOH for a substance and vice versa. In fact, a very convenient relationship
between pH and pOH allows you to solve for one when you have the other: pH + pOH = 14.
You’ll often be given a pH or pOH and be asked to solve for the H+ or OH– concentrations
instead of the other way around. The logarithms in the pH and pOH equations make it tricky
to solve for [H+] or [OH–], but if you remember that a log is inversed by raising 10 to the
power of each side of an equation, you will quickly arrive at a convenient formula for [H+],
namely [H+] = 10–pH. Similarly, [OH–] can be calculated using the formula [OH–] = 10–pOH. As
with pH and pOH, a convenient relationship exists between [H+] and [OH–], which multiply
together to equal a constant. This constant, called the ion product constant for water, or KW, is
calculated as follows: KW = [H+] × [OH-] = 1 × 10–14.
Taking It One Proton at a Time: Titration
So far we have treated acids and bases separately, but chemists are awfully fond of mixing
things. In the real world of chemistry, acids and bases often meet in solution and when they
do, they’re drawn to one another. These unions of acid and base are called neutralization
reactions because the low pH of the acid and the high pH of the base neutralize one another.
This does not, however, mean that the final solution will be neutral (pH=7) because not all
acids and bases have equal abilities to neutralize nor do they have to be mixed in equal
amounts or at equal concentrations to create a neutralization reaction. 
Although strong acids and bases have their uses, the prolonged presence of a strong acid or
base in an environment not equipped to handle it can be very damaging. In the laboratory,
for example, you need to handle strong acids and bases carefully, and deliberately perform
neutralization reactions when appropriate. A lazy chemistry student will get a brow-beating
from her hawk-eyed teacher if she attempts to dump a concentrated acid or base down the
laboratory sink. Doing so can damage the pipes and is generally unsafe. Instead, a responsi-
ble chemist will neutralize acidic laboratory waste with a base such as baking soda, and will
neutralize basic waste with an acid. Doing so makes most solutions perfectly safe to dump
down the drain and often results in the creation of a satisfyingly sizzly solution while the
reaction is occurring.
172
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Neutralizing equivalents
At heart, neutralization reactions in which the base contains a hydroxide ion are simple
double replacement reactions of the form HA + BOH →BA + H2O (or in other words, an acid
reacts with a base to form a salt and water). You’re asked to write a number of such reactions
in this chapter, so be sure to review double replacement reactions and balancing equations
in Chapter 13 before you delve into the new and exciting world of neutralization.
Unlike people, not all acids and bases are created equally. Some have an innate ability to neu-
tralize more effectively than others. Consider hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4),
for example. If you mixed 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) together with 1M hydrochloric acid,
you’d need to add equal amounts of each to create a neutral solution. If you mixed sodium
hydroxide with sulfuric acid, however, you’d need to add twice as much sodium hydroxide as
sulfuric acid. Why this blatant inequality of acids? The answer lies in the balanced neutraliza-
tion reactions for both acid/base pairs.
HCl + NaOH →NaCl + H2O
H2SO4 + 2NaOH →Na2SO4 + 2H2O
The coefficients in the balanced equations are the key to understanding this inequality. To
balance the equation, the coefficient 2 needs to be added to sodium hydroxide, indicating
that two moles of it must be present to neutralize one mole of sulfuric acid. On a molecular
level, this happens because sulfuric acid has two acidic hydrogen atoms to give up, and the
single hydroxide in a molecule of sodium hydroxide can only neutralize one of those two
acidic hydrogens to form water. Therefore, two moles of sodium hydroxide are needed for
every one mole of sulfuric acid. Hydrochloric acid, on the other hand, has only one acidic
hydrogen to contribute, so it can be neutralized by an equal amount of sodium hydroxide,
which has only one hydroxide to contribute to neutralization.
The number of moles of an acid or base multiplied by the number of hydrogens or hydrox-
ides that a molecule has to contribute in a neutralization reaction is called the number of
equivalents of that substance. Basically, the number of effective neutralizing moles available
determines the ratio of acid to base in a neutralization reaction.
Titrating with equivalents
Imagine you’re a newly hired laboratory assistant who’s been asked to alphabetize the chemi-
cals on the shelves of a chemistry laboratory during a lull in experimenting. As you reach for
the bottle of sulfuric acid, your first-day jitters get the better of you, and you knock over the
bottle. Some careless chemist failed to screw the cap on tightly! You quickly neutralize the acid
with a splash of baking soda and wipe up the now-nicely neutral solution. As you pick up the
bottle, however, you notice that the spilled acid burned away most of the label! You know it’s
sulfuric acid, but there are several different concentrations of sulfuric acid on the shelves, and
you don’t know the molarity of the solution in this bottle. Knowing that your boss will surely
blame you if she sees the damaged bottle, and not wanting to get sacked on your very first day,
you quickly come up with a way to determine the molarity of the solution and save your job.
You know that the bottle contains sulfuric acid of a mystery concentration, and you notice
bottles of 1M sodium hydroxide, a strong base, and phenolphthalein, a pH indicator, among
the chemicals on the shelves. You measure a small amount of the mystery acid into a beaker
and add a little phenolphthalein. You reason that if you drop small amounts of sodium
hydroxide into the solution until the phenolphthalein indicates that the solution is neutral
by turning the appropriate color, you’ll be able to figure out the acid’s concentration.
173
Chapter 17: Giving and Taking in Solution: Acids and Bases

You can do this by making a simple calculation of the number of moles of sodium hydroxide
you have added, and then reasoning that the mystery acid must have an equal number of
equivalents to have been neutralized. This then leads to the number of moles of acid, and
that, in turn, can be divided by the volume of acid you added to the beaker to get the molar-
ity. Whew! You relabel the bottle and rejoice in the fact that you can come in and do menial
labor in the lab again tomorrow.
This process is called a titration, and it’s often used by chemists to determine the molarity of
acids and bases. In a titration calculation, you generally know the identity of an acid or base
of unknown concentration, and the identity and molarity of the acid or base which you’re
going to use to neutralize it. Given this information, you then follow six simple steps:
1. Measure out a small volume of the mystery acid or base.
2. Add a pH indicator such as phenolphthalein.
Be sure to take note of the color that will indicate that the solution has reached neu-
trality. Again, this does not necessarily mean pH=7. Rather, the solution will reach
neutrality when the reaction between the acid and base is complete, which may leave
the solution with a pH other than 7. 
3. Neutralize.
Drop the acid or base of known concentration into the solution until the indicator
shows that it’s neutral, keeping careful track of the volume added.
4. Calculate the number of moles added.
Multiply the number of liters of acid or base added by the molarity of that acid or base
to get the number of moles added.
5. Account for equivalents.
Determine how many moles of the mystery substance being neutralized are present
using equivalents. How many moles of your acid do you need to neutralize one mole of
base or vice versa?
6. Solve for molarity.
Divide the number of moles of the mystery acid or base by the number of liters meas-
ured out in Step 1, giving you the molarity.
The titration process is often visualized using a graph showing concentration of base on one
axis and concentration of acid on the other as in Figure 17-2. The interaction of the two
traces out a titration curve, which has a characteristic s shape.

Keeping Steady: Buffers
You may have noticed that the titration curve shown in Figure 17-2 has a flattened area in the
middle where pH doesn’t change significantly, even when you add a conspicuous amount of
base. This region is called a buffer region.
Certain solutions, called buffered solutions, resist changes in pH like a stubborn child resists
eating her Brussels sprouts: steadfastly at first, but choking them down reluctantly if enough
pressure is applied (such as the threat of no dessert). Although buffered solutions maintain
their pH very well when small amounts of acid or base are added to them or the solution is
diluted, they can only withstand the addition of a certain amount of acid or base before
becoming overwhelmed.
Buffers are most often made up of a weak acid and its conjugate base, though they can
also be made of a weak base and its conjugate acid. A weak acid in aqueous solution will be
partially dissociated, the amount of dissociation depending on its pKa value (the negative
logarithm of its acid dissociation constant). The dissociation will be of the form HA + H2O →
H3O+ + A–, where A– is the conjugate base of the acid HA. The acidic proton is taken up by a
water molecule, forming hydronium. If HA were a strong acid, 100 percent of the acid would
become H3O+ and A–, but because it’s a weak acid, only a fraction of the HA dissociates, and
the rest remains HA.
Solving the earlier expression for Ka for the [H3O+] concentration allows you to devise a rela-
tionship between the [H3O+] and the Kaof a buffer.
Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of the equation and manipulating logarithm rules
yields an equation called the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation that relates the pH and the pKa.
This equation can be manipulated using logarithm rules to get 
, which may be
more useful in certain situations.
If you prefer to (or are asked to) calculate the pOH instead, you can use the equation
The very best buffers and those best able to withstand the addition of both acid and base are
those for which [HA] and [A–] are approximately equal. Because the [A–]/[HA] = 1 and the log
of 1 is 0, the logarithmic term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation disappears, and the
equation becomes pH = pKa. When creating a buffered solution, chemists therefore choose an
acid that has a pKa close to the desired pH.
If you add a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to this mixture of dissociated and
undissociated acid, its hydroxide is absorbed by the acidic proton, replacing the exception-
ally strong base OH– with a relatively weak base A–, and minimizing the change in pH.

Chapter 17: Giving and Taking in Solution: Acids and Bases

HA + OH– →H2O + A–
This causes a slight excess of base in the reaction, but doesn’t affect pH significantly. You can
think of the undissociated acid as a reservoir of protons that are available to neutralize any
strong base that may be introduced to the solution. As we explain in Chapter 15, when a
product is added to a reaction, the equilibrium in the reaction changes to favor the reactants
or to “undo” the change in conditions. Because this reaction generates A–, the acid dissocia-
tion reaction happens less frequently as a result, further stabilizing the pH.
When a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), is added to the mixture, its acidic
proton is taken up by the base A–, forming HA.
H+ + A– →HA
This causes a slight excess of acid in the reaction but doesn’t affect pH significantly. It also
shifts the balance in the acid dissociation reaction in favor of the products, causing it to
happen more frequently and re-creating the base A–.
The addition of acid and base and their effect on the ratio of products and reactants is sum-
marized in Figure 17-3.
Buffers have their limits, however. The acid’s proton reservoir, for example, can only com-
pensate for the addition of a certain amount of base before it runs out of protons that can
neutralize free hydroxide. At this point, a buffer has done all it can do, and the titration curve
resumes its steep, upward slope.

cids and bases are extremely common participants of chemical reactions, and even
have their own special class of reaction (neutralization). Because acidity/basicity is
such an important property of aqueous solutions, this topic travels with a whole entourage
of concepts and equations. There are different ways to define acids and bases. There are
different ways to express acid and base concentrations. There are special quantities for
expressing just how acidic or basic a particular compound is. This chapter summarizes key
points and skills from Chapter 17, and provides practice questions that test your ability to
put acid-base concepts to use. 
Soaking Up the Main Points
The acid-base nitty-gritty comes down to two major ideas. First, what are acids and bases,
and how can you recognize them? Second, how do acids and bases react with each other?
This section organizes highlights of Chapter 17 around these two categories.
Knowing and measuring acids and bases
There are several common ways to define acids and bases, all overlapping to some extent.
Having defined them, you can measure their concentrations and express those measure-
ments in different ways, as summarized in the following points.
 Three important methods for defining acids and bases are as follows:
• Arrhenius acids are those that dissociate to form hydrogen ions, while bases dis-
sociate to form hydroxide ions in solution.
• Brønsted-Lowry acids donate protons (hydrogen ions), which are accepted by
the Brønsted-Lowry base or proton acceptor.
• Lewis bases donate a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond with a Lewis acid,
which accepts the pair of electrons to form a coordinate covalent bond.

 The acid dissociation constant Ka gives an indication of the acidity of a substance
through the expression 
 Similarly, the base dissociation constant Kb indicates the basicity of a substance
through the expression 
 The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 and measures acidity, with low numbers indicating
acidic solutions, high numbers indicating basic solutions, and 7 indicating a perfectly
neutral solution. It is calculated using the equation pH = –log[H+].
 The pOH scale also ranges from 0 to 14, but measures basicity instead of acidity. Low
numbers mean basic solutions and high numbers mean acidic solutions. It is calculated
using the equation pOH = –log[OH-].
 pH and pOH are related through the simple expression pH + pOH = 14. In a related way,
[H+] × [OH–] = 10–14.
Reacting acids and bases
Split H2O and you can get H+ and OH–, acid and base respectively. Add acid to base, and you
regain water, neutralizing the acid and base reactants. The idea is simple, but neutralization
reactions can be tricky. The following points lay out the core principles.
 Neutralization reactions occur when acids and bases are mixed together. The amount
of acid needed to neutralize a base or vice versa depends not only on the molarity of
the acidic solution, but on the number of hydrogen atoms that the acid can donate to
neutralize the hydroxide ions of the base.
 Equivalents of acid and base are considered rather than molarities, because different
compounds can contribute different numbers of H+ or OH–. Equivalents are calculated
by multiplying the number of moles of compound by the number of hydrogen or
hydroxide ions being contributed by each molecule of compound.
 Titrations utilize neutralization reactions in order to determine the concentration of a
mystery acid or base. They’re accomplished through the following six steps:
1. Measure out a small volume of the mystery acid or base.
2. Add a pH indicator such as phenolphthalein (see Chapter 28 for details about
how to choose the best pH indicator for a reaction). Phenolphthalein, for exam-
ple, is colorless in acidic solutions but pink or purple in basic solutions.
3. Neutralize by dropping the acid or base of known concentration into the solution
until the indicator shows that it’s neutral (by changing color), keeping careful
track of the volume added.
4. Calculate the number of moles added by multiplying the number of liters of acid or
base added by the molarity of that acid or base to get the number of moles added.
5. Account for equivalents.
6. Solve for molarity. Divide the number of moles of the mystery acid or base by the
number of liters measured out in Step 1, giving you the molarity.

 Buffered solutions are made of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and
its conjugate acid, and resist changes in pH as long as only a small amount of acid or
base is added. The best buffers are those that have a pKa value equal or nearly equal to
the desired pH of the solution. Note that pKa = –logKa and pKb = –logKb.
 pH and pKa are related through the Henderson-Hasselbach equation as follows:
Practice Questions
With so many concepts and equations swirling about, its clear that acids and bases just aren’t
the kind of chemistry you simply read about and leave be. You are guaranteed to encounter
them on the AP exam, and you are equally guaranteed to be confused by them — unless you
practice, that is. Here are some targeted questions to help give you that practice.

correctly, it’s a good idea to read the explanations to solidify your acid-base genius and
because, well, you might have been simply lucky on one or two. 
1. (B). Problems like this are really just limiting reagent problems. The acid and base will
react with one another until one or the other is used up and the amount of remaining reac-
tant will determine the pH. In this case, however, the 1.0M diprotic sulfuric acid and the
2.0M potassium hydroxide exactly balance one another:

The acid has two protons to donate per molecule and the base is twice as concentrated.
They’re mixed in equal amounts, so there is no leftover acid or base. The resulting pH is
perfectly neutral.
2. (C). If the equilibrium constant is less than 1, then at equilibrium the concentration of 
reactants must be greater than the concentration of products. Because the information
given is regarding base strength, the problem must be dealing with the tendency of dissoci-
ation (and therefore concentration) to increase with the strength of the base. You’re look-
ing for a reaction where the stronger base appears on the lefthand side of the reaction
arrow. The only reaction where this is the case is C.
3. (C). You’re looking for a balanced reaction, which shows the proper phases for all of the
products and reactants. C is the only reaction that fulfills both of those criteria and con-
tains molecules with atoms combining in the proper ratios for charge balance.
4. (B). The ideal pKa is equal to the pH at the equivalence point. Use the given pOH to deter-
mine this value using the equation pH + pOH = 14. This equation gives you 14 – 9.8 = 4.2.
5. (a) Plug the given H+ concentration into the equation pH = –log[H+], which gives you 
pH = 3.40.
(b) 
(c) 159mL.You’re asked to solve for the number of moles of CH3COO–Na+ to be added. The
easiest way to do this is to go through the CH3COO– concentration, which is equivalent to
the CH3COO–Na+ concentration because it dissociates in water. Begin by writing out the
expression for the acid dissociation constant. 
Then, solve for the concentration of CH3COO–:
Finally, multiply this molarity by the volume to get the number of moles added.
6. (a) The equilibrium constant is the concentration of the products over the concentration
of the reactants, excluding water. This results in the expression
(b) 2.3 × 10–9. Use the given pH to find the pOH and from there the OH– concentration.
Because pH = 9.33, the pOH = 14 – 9.33 = 4.67. Use this to solve for [OH–].
This concentration should be equivalent to the [C5H5NH+] concentration. Plug these 
and the given C5H5N concentration into the equation derived in part (a) to get your Kb,
giving you

I
n chemistry, electrons get all the action. Among other things, electrons might transfer
between reactants during a reaction. Reactions like these are called oxidation-reduction
reactions, or redox reactions for brevity. Redox reactions are as important as they are
common. But they’re not always obvious. In this chapter, you discover how to recognize
redox reactions and how to balance the equations that describe them. All combustion, com-
bination, decomposition, and single replacement reactions are redox. You’ll also learn how
to figure out what goes on inside electrochemical cells, chemical systems that use redox
reactions to generate electrical current.
Using Oxidation Numbers to Recognize
Redox Reactions
If electrons move between reactants during redox reactions, then it should be easy to recog-
nize those reactions just by noticing changes in charge, right?
Sometimes.
The following two reactions are both redox reactions:
Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) →Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)
2H2(g) + O2(g) →2H2O(g)
In the first reaction, it’s obvious that electrons are transferred from magnesium to hydrogen.
In the second reaction, it’s not so obvious that electrons are transferred from hydrogen to
oxygen. We need a way to keep tabs on electrons as they transfer between reactants. In short,
we need oxidation numbers.

Oxidation numbers are tools to keep track of electrons. Sometimes an oxidation number
describes the actual charge on an atom. Other times an oxidation number describes an imagi-
nary sort of charge — the charge an atom would have if all its bonding partners left town,
taking their own electrons with them. In ionic compounds, oxidation numbers come closest to
describing actual atomic charge. The description is less apt in covalent compounds, in which
electrons are less clearly “owned” by one atom or another. The point is this: Oxidation num-
bers are useful accounting tools, but they are not direct descriptions of physical reality. And
remember that oxidation numbers apply to individual atoms, so it is possible that different
atoms of the same element can have different oxidation numbers within the same compound.
Here are some basic rules that are never broken for figuring out an atom’s oxidation number:
 Atoms in elemental form have an oxidation number of zero. So, the oxidation number
of both Mg(s) and O2(g) is zero.
 Single-atom (monatomic) ions have an oxidation number equal to their charge. So, the
oxidation number of Mg2+(aq) is +2 and the oxidation number of Cl–(aq) is –1. 
 In a neutral compound, oxidation numbers add up to zero. In a charged compound,
oxidation numbers add up to the compound’s charge.
Here are some basic rules that that have exceptions for figuring out an atom’s oxidation
number:
 In compounds, oxygen usually has an oxidation number of –2. An annoying exception is
the peroxides, like H2O2, in which oxygen has an oxidation number of –1.
 In compounds, hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 when it bonds to nonmetals
(as in H2O), and an oxidation number of –1 when it bonds to metals (as in NaH).
 In compounds
• Group IA atoms (alkali metals) have oxidation number +1.
• Group IIA atoms (alkaline earth metals) have oxidation number +2.
• Group IIIA atoms have oxidation number +3.
• Group VIIA atoms (halogens) usually have oxidation number –1.
By applying these rules to chemical reactions, you can discern who supplies electrons to
whom. The chemical species that loses electrons is oxidized, and acts as the reducing agent
(or reductant). The species that gains electrons is reduced, and acts as the oxidizing agent
(or oxidant). All redox reactions have both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent.
Oxidation may or may not involve bonding with oxygen, breaking bonds with hydrogen or
losing electrons — but oxidation always means an increase in oxidation number.
Reduction may or may not involve bonding with hydrogen, breaking bonds with oxygen or
gaining electrons — but reduction always means a decrease in oxidation number.
For example, consider the following reaction:
Cr2O3(s) + 2Al(s) →2Cr(s) + Al2O3(s)
Which are the oxidizing and reducing agents? To answer this question, you must assign oxida-
tion numbers to each atom and then see how those numbers change between the reactant
side and the product side. Recall that atoms in elemental form (like solid Al and solid Cr) have
oxidation number zero, and that oxygen typically has oxidation number –2 in compounds. The
oxidation number breakdown (shown in Figure 19-1) reveals that Al(s) is oxidized to Al2O3(s),
and Cr2O3(s) is reduced to Cr(s). So, Al(s) is the reducing agent and Cr2O3(s) is the oxidizing
agent.

Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Respecting the Hyphen: Oxidation-Reduction
Half-Reactions
When you balance a chemical reaction equation, the primary concern is to obey the princi-
ple of Conservation of Mass — the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of
the products. This is done by conserving and accounting for atoms. See Chapter 9 if you
need to review this process. In redox reactions, you must obey a second principle as well:
the Conservation of Charge. The total number of electrons lost must equal the total number
of electrons gained. In other words, you can’t just leave electrons lying around. The universe
is finicky about that type of thing. People hire accountants to keep the universe straight, so
AP chemistry is just Accounting 101!
Sometimes simply balancing a redox reaction with an eye to mass results in a charge-
balanced equation as well. In other words, tracking atoms also tracks all the electrons. Like 
a string of green lights, that’s a lovely thing when it occurs, but you can’t count on it. So, it’s
best to have a fail-safe system for balancing redox reactions. The details of that system
depend on whether the reaction occurs in acidic or basic condtions — in the presence of
excess H+ or excess OH–. Both variations use half-reactions, incomplete parts of the total
reaction that reflect either oxidation or reduction alone.
Balancing under acidic conditions
To properly conserve mass and charge as you balance a redox reaction under acidic condi-
tions, you often need to add water or hydrogen ion to the reactants or products. You are
allowed to add water because, as the solvent, water is always available to participate in
the reaction. You are allowed to add hydrogen ion because that species is present at higher
concentration in acidic solutions.
Here is a summary of the method for balancing a redox reaction equation for a reaction
under acidic conditions:
1. Separate the reaction equation into the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction. Use oxidation numbers to identify these component half-reactions.
2. Balance the half-reactions separately, temporarily ignoring O and H atoms.
3. Balance the half-reactions separately, using H2O to add O atoms and using H+ to add
H atoms.

4. Balance the half-reactions separately for charge by adding electrons (e–).
5. Balance the charge of the half-reactions with respect to each other by multiplying the
reactions such that the total number of electrons is the same in each half-reaction.
6. Reunite the half-reactions into a complete redox reaction equation.
7. Simplify the equation by canceling items that appear on both sides of the arrow. 
For example, here is an unbalanced redox reaction:
NO2
– + Br– →NO + Br2
To balance the redox reaction, assuming that it occurs under acidic conditions (the problem
will typically tell you whether this is the case), simply go through the steps, 1 through 7:
1. Divide the equation into half-reactions for oxidation and reduction:
Br – →Br2
(oxidation)
NO2
– →NO
(reduction)
2. Balance half-reactions, temporarily ignoring O and H:
2Br – →Br2
NO2
– →NO
3. Balance half-reactions for O and H by adding H+ and H2O, respectively:
2Br – →Br2
2H+ + NO2
– →NO + H2O
4. Balance the charge within each half-reaction by adding electrons (e –):
2Br – →Br2 + 2e –
1e – + 2H+ + NO2
– →NO + H2O
5. Balance the charge of the half-reactions with respect to each other:
2Br – →Br2 + 2e –
2e – + 4H+ + 2NO2
– →2NO + 2H2O
6. Add the half-reactions, reuniting them within the total reaction equation:
2e – + 4H+ + 2Br – + 2NO2
– →Br2 + 2NO + 2H2O + 2e –
7. Simplify by canceling items that appear on both sides of the equation:
4H+ + 2Br – + 2NO2
– →Br2 + 2NO + 2H2O
Balancing under basic conditions
Fine, you say, but what if the reaction occurs under basic conditions? Do I have to learn a
whole different set of rules? No — the process for balancing redox equations under basic
conditions is 90 percent identical to the one used for balancing under acidic conditions. In
other words, master one and you’ve mastered both. Instead of using water and hydrogen ion
as balancing tools, you are allowed to use water and hydroxide ion, the ion present in greater
concentration in basic solutions.
186
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Here’s how easy it is to adapt your balancing method for basic conditions:
 Perform Steps 1 through 7 as described for balancing under acidic conditions.
 Observe where H+ is present in the resulting equation. Add an identical amount of OH–
to both sides of the equation such that all the H+ is “neutralized,” becoming water.
 Cancel any amounts of H2O that appear on both sides of the equation.
That’s it. Really.
For example, here is another unbalanced redox reaction:
Cr2+ + Hg →Cr + HgO
Assuming the reaction takes place under basic conditions (again, problems typically tell you
whether acidic or basic conditions apply), begin balancing as if the reaction occurs under
acidic conditions, and then neutralize any H+ ions by adding OH– equally to both sides.
Finally, cancel any excess H2O molecules.
Follow Steps 1 through 7 as under acidic conditions:
H2O + Cr2+ + Hg →Cr + HgO + 2H+
Neutralize H+ by adding sufficient and equal amounts of OH – to both sides:
2OH – + H2O + Cr2+ + Hg →Cr + HgO + 2H2O
Simplify by canceling H2O as possible from both sides:
2OH – + Cr2+ + Hg →Cr + HgO + H2O 
Redox reactions have a bad reputation among chemistry students due the the perceptions
that they’re difficult to understand and even more difficult to balance. But the perception is
only a perception. 
The whole process boils down to the following principles:
 Balancing redox reaction equations is exactly like balancing other equations; you
simply have one more component to balance — the electron.
 Use oxidation numbers to discern the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
 Under acidic conditions, balance O and H atoms by adding H2O and H+.
 Under basic condtions, balance as you do with acidic conditions, but then neutralize
any H+ by adding OH –. 
 There are other methods for balancing redox reaction equations, so feel free to use
another method if you’re more comfortable with it! 
Keeping Current: Electrochemical Cells
Redox reactions are responsible for some not-so-useful things, like rust. But they’re also
responsible for some very useful things, like electrochemical cells, devices that convert the
chemical energy of a redox reaction into electric energy of flowing current, or vice versa.
Voltaic cells are electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
187
Chapter 19: Transferring Charge: Oxidation-Reduction

Batteries are examples of voltaic cells. A device called an electrolytic cell converts electrical
energy into chemical energy. Keeping track of the relationships between different reaction
mixtures and the direction and magnitude of current flow can be tricky. In this section, we
describe the fundamentals of electrochemical and electrolytic cells. In addition, we give you
the basic math you need to relate redox reactions to current flow in these kinds of cells.
Navigating voltaic cells
The energy provided by batteries is created in a unit called a voltaic cell, the kind of electro-
chemical cell that converts chemical energy to electrical energy. Many batteries use a
number of voltaic cells wired in series, and others use a single cell. Voltaic cells harness the
energy released in a redox reaction and transform it into electrical work. A voltaic cell is cre-
ated by connecting two metals called electrodes in solution with an external circuit. In this
way, the reactants are not in direct contact, but are able to transfer electrons to one another
through an external pathway, allowing the redox reaction to occur. Obviously, to be useful,
a battery involves reactions that are far from equilibrium and are just waiting to power your
Mp3 player by sending electrons through it so the reaction can reach equilibrium. At equilib-
rium, the battery is “dead.” The electrode that undergoes oxidation is called the anode. 
This is easily remembered if you can burn the phrase “an ox” (for anode oxidation) into your
memory. The phrase “red cat” is equally useful for remembering what happens at the other
electrode, called the cathode where the reduction reaction occurs.
Electrons created in the oxidation reaction at the anode of a voltaic cell flow along an exter-
nal circuit to the cathode, where they fuel the reduction reaction taking place there. We will
use the spontaneous reaction between zinc and copper as an example of a voltaic cell here,
but it is important to realize that there are many powerful redox reactions that power many
types of batteries, so they are not limited to reactions between copper and zinc. 
Zinc metal will react spontaneously with an aqueous solution of copper sulfate when they are
placed in direct contact with one another. Zinc, being a more reactive metal than copper, dis-
places the copper ions in solution. The displaced copper deposits itself as pure copper metal
on the surface of the dissolving zinc strip. It may at first appear to be a simple single replace-
ment reaction, but it is also a redox reaction. The oxidation of zinc proceeds as follows:
Zn(s) →Zn2+(aq) + 2e –
The two electrons created in this oxidation of zinc are consumed by the copper in the reduc-
tion half of the reaction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e – →Cu(s) 
These two half-reactions make up the total reaction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e – + Zn(s) →Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq) + 2e –
The electron duo appears on both sides of this combined reaction and therefore cancels,
leaving
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) →Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
This is the reaction that happens when the two reactants are in direct contact, but recall that
a voltaic cell is created by connecting the two reactants by an external pathway. The elec-
trons created at the anode in the oxidation reaction travel to the reduction half of the reac-
tion along this external pathway. This flow of traveling electrons is electrical current.
A voltaic cell utilizing this same oxidation-reduction reaction between copper and zinc is
shown in Figure 19-2, which we will examine piece by piece. 
188
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

First, note that zinc is being oxidized at the anode, which is labeled with a negative sign. It is
important to note that this does not mean that the anode is negatively charged. Rather, it is
meant to indicate that electrons are being released there. The oxidation of zinc releases Zn2+
cations into the solution as well as two electrons that flow along the circuit to the cathode.
This oxidation thus results in an increase of Zn2+ ions into the solution and a decrease in the
mass of the zinc metal anode. 
The electrons released by the oxidation of zinc at the anode carry out the reduction of Cu
at the cathode. This pulls Cu2+ from solution and deposits more Cu metal on the cathode. The
result is the exact opposite of the effect occurring at the anode: The solution becomes less
concentrated as Cu2+ ions are used up in the reduction reaction, and the electrode gains mass
as Cu metal is deposited.
No doubt you have noticed that the diagram also contains a U-shaped tube connecting the
two solutions. This is called the salt bridge and it permits the system to adjust the charge
imbalance created as the anode releases more and more cations into its solution (resulting in
a net positive charge) and the cathode uses up more and more of the cations in its solution
(leaving it with a net negative charge). The salt bridge contains an electrolytic salt (in this
case NaNO3). A good salt bridge is created with an electrolyte whose component ions will not
react with the ions already in solution. The salt bridge functions by sucking up the extra NO3
–
ions in the cathode solution and depositing NO3
– ions from the other end of the bridge into
the anode solution. It also sucks up the excess positive charge at the anode by absorbing
Zn2+ ions and depositing its own cation, Na+, into the cathode solution. These actions of the
salt bridge are necessary because the solutions must be neutral in order for the redox reac-
tion to continue. The bridge also completes the cell’s electrical circuit by allowing for the

flow of charge back to the anode. Instead of a salt bridge, electrochemical cells can be set up
with a porous barrier separating (and in direct contact with) the anode and cathode solu-
tions. Whether a salt bridge or a porous barrier is used, anions travel to the anode, while
cations travel to the cathode.
Flowing through electrolytic cells
Another kind of electrochemical cell is an electrolytic cell, a cell in which electrical energy is
converted into chemical energy. An electrolytic cell is essentially a voltaic cell run in reverse.
Instead of using the potential energy of a spontaneous chemical reaction to drive current,
electrolytic cells use an external energy source (like a battery) to drive nonspontaneous
chemical reactions. Because electrolytic cells are essentially the opposite of voltaic cells,
you can understand both with the same set of electrochemical principles.
For example, an electrolytic cell can be used to drive the following reaction, in which liquid
(melted) sodium chloride decomposes into liquid sodium and chlorine gas:
2NaCl(l) →2Na(l) + Cl2(g)
Like any other redox reaction, this one can be divided into half-reactions:
2Na+(l) + 2e – →2Na(l)
2Cl –(l) →Cl2(g) + 2e –
The former half-reaction occurs at a cathode and latter occurs at an anode. Figure 19-3
depicts an electrolytic cell in which an external voltage source is being used to drive this
nonspontaneous reaction forward.
As in a voltaic cell, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. Thus
our “an ox” and “red cat” mnemonics are still valid.

Calculating EMF and standard cell potentials
Voltaic cells connect two halves of a redox reaction with a current-carrying conductor. But
what exactly is it that causes the flow of charge across the conductor? To answer this ques-
tion, you need to understand the concept of electromotive force. To be able to calculate the
diriving force behind the flow of current, you need to be able to use standard cell potentials.
In this section we describe the connection between electromotive force and standard cell
potential, and show you how to use them in the context of a specific redox reaction.
Electromotive force and standard cell potentials have to do with potential energy. When a dif-
ference in potential energy is established between two locations, an object has a natural ten-
dency to move from an area of higher potential energy to an area of lower potential energy.
When Wile E. Coyote places a large circular boulder at the top of a hill overlooking a road on
which he knows his nemesis the Roadrunner will soon be traveling, he takes it for granted
that when he releases the boulder it will simply roll down the hill. This is due to the differ-
ence in gravitational potential energy between the top and bottom of the hill, which have
high and low potential energies respectively. In a similar, though less diabolical, manner, the
electrons produced at the anode of a voltaic cell have a natural tendency to flow along the
circuit to a location with lower potential: the cathode. 
It is this potential difference between the two electrodes that causes the electromotive force,
or EMF, of the cell. EMF is also often referred to as the cell potential and is denoted Ecell. The
cell potential varies with temperature and concentration of products and reactants and is
measured in Volts (V). A Volt is a derived unit — one Volt equals one Joule per Coulomb (V =
J C-1); in other words, a Volt is an amount of energy held by an amount of charge. As in many
other parts of chemistry, chemists have found it much easier to track relative changes rather
than absolute ones. So it has been found to be convenient to have standards by which cells
can be compared. The Ecell that occurs when concentrations of solutions are all at 1mol L-1
and the cell is at STP (1atm pressure, 0°C) is given the special name of standard cell potential,
or E0
cell.
You can calculate electrochemical (voltaic or electrolytic) cell potentials by taking the differ-
ence between the standard potentials of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. Once
upon a time, a group of chemists sitting in a small, dark room decided that all half-reaction
potentials should be listed as the potential for reduction (not oxidation). As such, these
potentials are often referred to as standard reduction potentials. They are calculated using
the formula
E°cell = E°red(cathode) – E°red(anode)
Note that this equation will not be provided to you on the AP exam — you must memorize it!
Standard reduction potentials are reported relative to a reference reduction potential, one
that sets the “zero” for the spectrum of other reduction potentials. The reference potential
is that for the reduction of 2 moles of hydrogen ion in solution, specifically at 1 molar con-
centration to 1 mole of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure:
2H+(aq) + 2e – →H2(g)
E°red = 0 V
Here’s a happy consequence of the fact that E°red values are reported in Volts: Because Volts
are already standardized per unit of charge (per Coulomb, specifically), the value of E°red
stays the same, even if the stoichiometry of the half-reaction changes. So, you get the same
potential for H+(aq) + e– →1⁄2 H2(g).
Table 19-1 lists some standard reduction potentials along with the reduction half-reactions
associated with them. The table is ordered from the most negative E°red (least-favorable
reduction) to the most positive E°red (most-favorable reduction). Note that different tables
191
Chapter 19: Transferring Charge: Oxidation-Reduction

may list items in reverse order, so be sure to orient yourself to the table you’re using. The
reactions with negative E°red are therefore reactions that happen at anodes, while those with
a positive E°red occur at cathodes. 
Put another way, the reactants in half-reactions with the most negative E°red are the strongest
reducing agents (like Li+). The reactants in half-reactions with the most positive E°red are the
strongest oxidizing agents (like F2).

Note that not all of the reactions in Table 19-1 show the oxidation or reduction of solid metals
as in our examples so far. Note that there are liquids and gases in the mix. Not every voltaic
cell is fueled by a reaction taking place between the metals of the electrodes. Although the
cathode itself must be made of a metal to allow for the flow of electrons, those electrons could
be passed into a gas or a liquid in order to complete the reduction half-reaction. Don’t panic!
You do not need to memorize this table. The folks at the College Board do give you a table of
reduction potentials on the AP exam!
Using Concentration and Standard Cell
Potentials to Predict Results
Electrochemistry occurs in situations other than in beakers connected by salt bridges.
Electrochemistry occurs anywhere in the universe where you find a suitable set of half-
reactions. By connecting the lessons you’ve learned about electrochemical cells with other
chemical wisdom about the concentrations of reactants and products, you get a powerful set
of tools to predict whether redox reactions will occur in a given situation, or to explain why
they did occur. In this section, we show you how to use standard cell potentials and concen-
trations to make predictions about redox reactions. We also introduce you to the Faraday con-
stant, a key equation that ties electricity to chemistry by relating charge and the mole. To
192
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

allow you to make predictions about redox reactions under nonstandard, real-life conditions,
we add another tool to your mathematical toolbelt, the Nernst equation.
Predicting spontaneity with standard 
cell potentials
The painstaking measurement of myriad standard reduction potentials serves a greater
purpose than simply making Impressive Tables of Official Data even more impressive.
These potentials can be used to predict whether a redox reaction is spontaneous or
nonspontaneous — whether it occurs on its own or whether it requires an input of energy
to go forward. Remember though, that spontaneity is defined relative to equilibrium.
No obvious reaction will occur if a redox system is at equilibrium.
Recall that you can calculate the standard cell potential in a voltaic or electrolytic cell by
taking the difference in the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions occurring at
the cathode and anode:
E°cell = E°red(cathode) – E°red(anode)
In the same way, you can calculate the electromotive force of any particular redox reaction
occurring outside of an electrochemical cell:
E°= E°red(reduction half-reaction) – E°red(oxidation half-reaction)
Here’s the kicker: If E° is positive, the reaction is spontaneous; if E° is negative, the reaction is
nonspontaneous. 
Note that this sign convention is different from that typically used in discussions of energy
and spontaneity. The Gibbs free energy change for a reaction (∆G), for example, is negative
for a spontaneous process. If you pay close attention to the equation for the relationship
between Gibbs free energy and cell potential given below, you have a strong reminder about
them being opposite in sign.
You can use calculated electromotive force values to predict whether or not a displacement
reaction will occur. For example, here is a candidate displacement reaction:
Cu(s) + CaCl2(aq) →CuCl2(aq) + Ca(s)
Will this reaction occur spontaneously? Because it is a redox reaction as well as a displace-
ment reaction, we can decide by examining the redox half-reactions:
Cu(s) →Cu2+(aq) + 2e –
(oxidation half-reaction)
Ca2+(aq) + 2e – →Ca(s)
(reduction half-reaction)
The relevant calculation of electromotive force is
E° = E° red(Ca2+ →Ca) – E° red(Cu2+ →Cu)
Plugging in values from Table 19-1, we get
E° = ( –2.76 V) – (+0.34 V) = –3.10 V
Because the calculated E° is negative, we know that the reaction is nonspontaneous — copper
will not displace calcium from calcium chloride without the input of additional energy.
193
Chapter 19: Transferring Charge: Oxidation-Reduction

Tying electricity to chemistry: The Faraday constant
Using standard reduction potentials, you can calculate the spontaneity of a redox reaction
under standard conditions. In other words, you have to assume that the reaction takes place
with the reactants at 1mol L-1 concentration. Most real-life reactions don’t take place under
standard conditions. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could use standard reduction potentials to
make predictions about real-life reactions? We can, once we have a solid mathematical con-
nection between the flow of current and the individual atoms involved in redox reactions.
That connection is provided by Faraday’s constant.
As noted briefly above (and discussed at greater length in Chapter 21), spontaneous processes
are those that occur with a decrease in Gibbs free energy; the products have lower free energy
than the reactants, so the overall change in free energy (∆G) is negative. What we really need,
then, is a way to relate electromotive force for a real-life reaction, E, to the free energy change
for that reaction, ∆G. Here is where the work of Michael Faraday helps us out.
Faraday was a high-powered English chemist, physicist, and by most accounts a generally
swell guy. Among other things he spent quite a bit of time pondering the relationship
between chemistry and electricity. Studying the properties of electrolytic cells, he noticed
two important things:
 The mass of substance produced at an electrode (an anode or cathode) is directly pro-
portional to the number of electrons transferred through the cell. 
 The amount of the substances produced by electrolysis depends on the atomic masses
of the substances as well as the “excess charge” of the substances (in other words, the
ionic charge of the atoms).
The upshot of these observations was that Faraday had discovered how to relate current to
chemistry at the level of individual atoms. To make this connection explicit and useful for
predictions, we now use a number called the Faraday constant, F. The Faraday constant is
simply the product of Avogadro’s number, NA (that is, one mole) and the charge of a single
electron, e:
F = NA·e = (6.022 × 1023 mol–1)(1.602 × 10–19 C) = 9.649 × 104 C mol–1
The Faraday constant serves as a bridge to allow us to relate the free energy change for a
redox reaction to the electromotive force for that reaction:
∆G = –n F E
In this simple but powerful equation, n is the number of molar equivalents of electrons that
are transferred during the reaction. In other words, n is the number of electrons written in a
balanced redox reaction equation. The negative sign on the right side of the equation reflects
the fact that spontaneous redox reactions have opposite signs in ∆G and E.
Bringing it all together with the Nernst equation 
To make predictions about behavior in real-life redox reactions, where concentrations aren’t
at the standard of 1mol L–1, we need to involve those real-life, nonstandard concentrations in
our calculations. This section introduces the right tool for that job: the Nernst equation. This
useful equation combines nonstandard concentration information in the form of the reaction
quotient, Q, with the electricity-chemistry bridge of the Faraday constant, F.
194
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Nernst was a German chemist and Nobel Prize-winner who was born shortly before Faraday
died. So, we can imagine Faraday as sort of handing off the electrochemical baton to Nernst.
Nernst ran with it. Nernst knew that the free energy change for a real-life reaction, ∆G, could
be related to the standard free energy change for that reaction (∆G°, when reactants and
products are all at 1mol L–1) in the following way:
∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q
In this equation, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and Q is the reaction quotient. The
reaction quotient is the key component for our purposes because it describes the actual con-
centrations of reactants and products in a reaction. So, for the general, reversible reaction
aA + bB  cC + dD
the reaction quotient is
By combining this relationship with Faraday’s observation that ∆G = – n F E, we obtain the
very useful Nernst equation:
Armed with the Nernst equation and a table of standard reduction potentials, you can pre-
dict the electromotive force of real life reactions, ones that occur at odd temperatures and
with odd concentrations of reactants and products. Or, given an observed electromotive
force, you can calculate unknown concentrations or temperatures. Thanks to Faraday and
Nernst, you have a quantitative, scientifically deep explanation for why your car battery fails
you on a cold winter morning.

hapter 19 was charged with must-remember lists and tidbits. Oxidation-reduction reac-

favorite villains of many chemistry students. Arm yourself for what you know is coming, and
be sure to master the highlights of Chapter 19, listed here, and try your hand at the practice
problems. 
Remembering the Rules of Engagement
Conquering redox problems involves two major skills. First, you must be able to identify oxi-
dizing and reducing agents so you can follow the flow of charge in a redox reaction. Second,
you need to be able to balance redox reaction equations. The following two sections review
the key points and processes of these skills.
Following the flow of charge in redox
 During a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent becomes reduced and the reducing agent
becomes oxidized.
 Oxidation may or may not involve bonding with oxygen, breaking bonds with hydrogen
or losing electrons — but oxidation always means an increase in oxidation number.
 Reduction may or may not involve bonding with hydrogen, breaking bonds with oxygen
or gaining electrons — but reduction always means a decrease in oxidation number.
 Rules for figuring out oxidation numbers
• Atoms in elemental form have an oxidation number of zero.
• Single-atom (monatomic) ions have an oxidation number equal to their charge.
• In a neutral compound, oxidation numbers add up to zero. In a charged compound,
oxidation numbers add up to the compound’s charge.
• In compounds, oxygen usually has an oxidation number of –2, in which its oxida-
tion number is –1.

• In compounds, hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 when it bonds to non-
metals, and an oxidation number of –1 when it bonds to metals.
• In compounds
Group IA atoms (alkali metals) have oxidation number +1.
Group IIA atoms (alkaline earth metals) have oxidation number +2.
Group IIIA atoms have oxidation number +3.
Group VIIA atoms (halogens) usually have oxidation number –1.
 Oxidation occurs at an anode, which releases electrons that flow to a cathode, where
reduction occurs.
 E°cell = E°red(cathode) – E°red(anode) and E° = E°red (reduction half-reaction) – E°red (oxida-
tion half-reaction)
 ∆G = –nFE and the related equation
 ∆G = ∆°G + RT ln Q
 Nernst equation
Balancing redox reaction equations
To balance a redox reaction equation for a reaction under acidic conditions
1. Separate the reaction equation into the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-
reaction. Use oxidation numbers to identify these component half-reactions.
2. Balance the half-reactions separately, temporarily ignoring O and H atoms.
3. Balance the half-reactions separately, using H2O to add O atoms and using H+ to add H
atoms.
4. Balance the half-reactions separately for charge by adding electrons (e–).
5. Balance the charge of the half-reactions with respect to each other by multiplying the
reactions such that the total number of electrons is the same in each half-reaction.
6. Reunite the half-reactions into a complete redox reaction equation.
7. Simplify the equation by canceling items that appear on both sides of the arrow.
To balance a redox reaction equation for a reaction under basic conditions, perform steps 1
through 7 above, and then add the following steps:
1. Observe where H+ is present in the resulting equation. Add an identical amount of OH–
to both sides of the equation such that all the H+ is “neutralized,” becoming water.
2. Cancel any amounts of H2O that appear on both sides of the equation.

Checking Your Work
You made it. Have a snack. Check your answers.
1. (C.) Both Cl2 and Sb are in elemental form, so their atoms have an oxidation number of zero.
The Cl– oxidation number is the same as its charge. SbO+ is a bit tricky to unravel, but
remember that oxygen has a –2 oxidation number. So, in that compound, Sb must have a +3
oxidation number.
2. (B.) Find out that six electrons are transferred by balancing the reaction. Doing the first six
steps of balancing gives you:
Step 1
Sb →SbO+ (oxidation)
Cl2 →Cl– (reduction)
Step 2
Sb →SbO+
Cl2 →2Cl–
Step 3
Sb + H2O →SbO+ + 2H+
Cl2 →2Cl–
Step 4
Sb + H2O →SbO+ + 2H+ + 3e–
Cl2 + 2e– →2Cl–
Step 5
2Sb + 2H2O →2SbO+ + 4H+ + 6e–
3Cl2 + 6e– →6Cl–
Step 6
2Sb + 3Cl2 + 2H2O + 6e– →2SbO+ + 6Cl– + 4H+ + 6e–
So, six electrons are transferred from Sb to Cl2.
3. (D.) Completing the final step of balancing under acidic conditions gives you
Step 7
2Sb + 3Cl2 + 2H2O →2SbO+ + 6Cl– + 4H+
203
Chapter 20: Answering Questions on Oxidation-Reduction

4. (A.) Adding steps 8 and 9 to account for basic conditions gives you
Step 8
2Sb + 3Cl2 + 2H2O + 4OH– →2SbO+ + 6Cl– + 4H2O 
Step 9
2Sb + 3Cl2 + 4OH– →2SbO+ + 6Cl– + 2H2O
5. (A.) To figure out this one, just assign oxidation numbers to all the reactants and products:
 In iron (II) sulfide, FeS, iron has oxidation number +2, sulfur has oxidation number –2.
 In O2, which is in elemental form, oxygen has oxidation number 0.
 In iron (II) oxide, FeO, iron has oxidation number +2, oxygen has oxidation number –2.
 In sulfur dioxide, SO2, sulfur has oxidation number +4, oxygen has oxidation number –2.
So, the oxidation number of oxygen decreased from reactants to products, while the oxida-
tion number of sulfur increased. This means that oxygen was reduced, and therefore is the
oxidizing agent. Sulfur was oxidized, and therefore is the reducing agent. So, I is correct and
II is not correct. Choice III is wrong because, although sulfur transfers electrons to oxygen, it
does not do so to iron.
6. (C.) Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode in an electrochemical cell. This flow of
electrons occurs spontaneously from the stronger reducing agent to the weaker reducing
agent. Based on the standard reduction potentials given for nickel and silver, it is clear that
nickel is the stronger reducing agent — reducing Ni2+ is unfavorable whereas reducing Ag+ is
favorable. So, nickel is the anode and silver is the cathode, with electrons flowing from
nickel to silver.
7. (E.) Calculate the standard cell potential by subtracting the standard reduction potential of
the anode from the standard reduction potential of the cathode:
E°cell = E°red(cathode) – E°red(anode)
E°cell = +0.80 V – (–0.28 V) = +1.08 V 
8. (C.) Electromotive force, or EMF, is the potential difference across the anode and cathode of
an electrochemical cell. Electrons flow from high potential to low potential, just as a boul-
der rolls down a hill from a position of high gravitational potential to one of low potential.
9. (D.) One Faraday (F) is the charge associated with one mole (Avogadro’s number, NA) of
electron charges (e):
F = NA·e = (6.022 × 1023 mol-1)(1.602 × 10-19 C) = 9.649 × 104 C mol-1
This constant is key to relating the number of electrons transferred during a redox reaction
to the free energy change for that reaction.
10. (B.) Reduction occurs at cathodes. Think “red cat.”
11. (E.) The Nernst equation combines Faraday’s constant, F, with the reaction quotient, Q, to
produce a relationship between the EMF of an electrochemical cell and the nonstandard
concentrations of the reactants and products within that cell. 
12. (A.) Oxidation occurs at anodes. Think “an ox.”
13. (E.) Nonspontaneous reactions do not occur on their own, Zbut require an input of energy.
Spontaneous reactions occur on their own, releasing energy. Remember that the free energy
change varies with conditions, so all conditions must be known for you to compute the sign
204
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

of ∆G. Chemical species (that is, reactants and products) move spontaneously from high
energy states to low energy states. So, in a spontaneous reaction, the final free energy is
lower than the initial free energy. Because ∆G = Gfinal – Ginitial, ∆G > 0 for a nonspontaneous
reaction, in which the final free energy would be greater than the initial free energy. The
equilibrium constant, Keq, for a reaction is the quotient of the product concentration(s)
divided by the reactant concentration(s). Nonspontaneous reactions favor reactants, and
therefore have Keq < 1. Electromotive force is different from ∆G in that favorable redox reac-
tions generate a positive electromotive force; this force is what produces current across the
cell. So, a nonspontaneous reaction is associated with a negative electromotive force, where
E < 0.
14. (C.) Balance the reaction as follows:
Step 1
Cu →Cu2+ (oxidation)
O2 →H2O (reduction)
Step 2
(already done)
Step 3
Cu →Cu2+
O2 + 4H+ →2H2O
Step 4
Cu →Cu2+ + 2e–
O2 + 4H+ + 4e– →2H2O
Step 5
2Cu →2Cu2+ + 4e–
O2 + 4H+ + 4e– →2H2O
Step 6
2Cu + O2 + 4H+ + 4e– →2Cu2+ + 2H2O + 4e–
Step 7
2Cu + O2 + 4H+ →2Cu2+ + 2H2O
15. (B.) First, figure out which is the reduction half-reaction and which is the oxidation half-
reaction. This has already been done in Steps 1 through 4 of the answer to the previous
question:
Cu →Cu2+ + 2e– (oxidation)
O2 + 4H+ + 4e– →2H2O (reduction)
Next, recall the formula for calculating the standard, EMF, E°, for a redox reaction from the
standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:
E° = E°red(reduction half-reaction) – E°red(oxidation half-reaction)
E° = +1.23 V – (+0.34 V) = +0.89 V 
16. (D.) The relationship between standard free energy change and standard electromotive
force is given by
∆G° = –nFE°
We know from the balanced reaction equation that four electrons are transferred during the
reaction, so n = 4. Faraday’s constant is 96,500 Cmol-1 (or J V-1mol-1). The standard electro-
motive force or cell potential (calculated in question 15) is +0.89 V. So,
∆G° = –4 ( (96,500 J V-1mol-1) × (0.89 V) = –340,000 Jmol-1 = –340 kJmol-1
205
Chapter 20: Answering Questions on Oxidation-Reduction

17. (D.) The concentration of acid corresponds to the concentration of H+, a species that sits on
the reactants side of the reaction equation. Chemical systems respond to an increase in
reactant concentrations by shifting mass toward the products; in other words, increasing
the concentration of H+ makes the reaction more favorable. Increasing H+ decreases the
reaction quotient, Q, which is calculated as the concentration of products divided by the
concentration of reactants. If Q decreases, then the electromotive force increases. This is
made clear by the Nernst equation.
If Q decreases, then the entire term (RTlnQ) / (nF) decreases. This in turn means that a
smaller quantity is subtracted from E° to compute E. The electromotive force, E, is therefore
larger.

ost people don’t like waiting. And nobody likes waiting for nothing. Research has ten-

To address these concerns, chemists study things such as
 Kinetics is concerned with the rates of things, such as chemical reactions. Kinetics
answers the question, “How much product will I get in the next minute?”
 Thermodynamics is concerned with the relationship between energy and chemical
systems. Thermodynamics answers questions like, “How far will my reaction go?” and
“How hot will my beaker get?”
Kinetics and thermodynamics are separate. There’s no simple connection between how long
it takes for a reaction to proceed and how productive a reaction can be. In other words,
chemists have good days and bad days, like everyone else. At least they have a little bit of
science to help them make sense of these things. In this chapter, you get an overview of this
science. Don’t wait. Read on.
Getting There Rapidly or Slowly: 
Kinetics and Reaction Rates
So, you’ve got this beaker, and a reaction is going on inside of it. Is the reaction a fast one or
a slow one? How fast or how slow? How can you tell? These are questions about rates. You
can measure a reaction rate by measuring how fast a reactant disappears or by measuring
how fast a product appears. If the reaction occurs in solution, the molar concentration of
reactant or product changes over time, so rates are often expressed in units of molarity per
second (M s–1).

For the following reaction,
A + B →C
you can measure the reaction rate by measuring the decrease in the concentration of either
reactant A (or B) or the increase in the concentration of product C over time. So, by measur-
ing changes in concentration over a defined change in time, you can measure average rate,
the rate of the reation averaged over a specific time period:
Average rate = –∆[A]/∆t = ∆[C]/∆t
Note that ∆means “average change in.” Here, the expression for average rate is given in
terms of reactant A or in terms of product C. The expression in terms of A includes a minus
sign because that reactant disappears in the course of the reaction. No sign in the C expres-
sion means “+” as [C] increases with time. Note that if the reaction were reversed so that [C]
decreased and [A] increased over time, the signs of [A] and [C] would still be opposite, but
reversed.
As the period of time gets smaller (that is, as ∆t approaches zero), the average rate
approaches the instantaneous rate, the rate of the reaction at a given instant:
Instantaneous rate = –d[A]/dt = d[C]/dt
In these kinds of equations, if you have done calculus you’ll smile down upon those less-
fortunate mortals, but “d” is only math-speak for a change in the amount of something at any
given moment. If you plot the concentration of product against the reaction time, for exam-
ple, you might get a curve like the one shown in Figure 21-1. Each tiny point on the graph
corresponds to a slope that is an instantaneous value of d[product]/dt. 
Reactions usually occur most quickly at the beginning of a reaction, when the concentration of
products is the lowest and the concentration of reactants is highest. Chemists usually measure
“initial rates” under these conditions and use these rates to characterize the reactions.
The stoichiometry of a reaction helps determine the relative rates at which reactant and
product concentrations change. For example, in the reaction
A + 2B →C

the following is true: 
Instantaneous rate = –d[A]/dt = –1/2d[B]/dt = d[C]/dt
Because two moles of reactant B are consumed for every mole of reactant A, moles of B dis-
appear at twice the rate of moles of A.
Measuring and Calculating with Rates
How can chemists follow the concentration of reactants and products as a reaction proceeds,
anyway? One common method is by using absorption spectroscopy, which measures the con-
centration of substances in a sample by their ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation. If
the substance you want to measure absorbs green light, you shine green light through the
sample and measure how much green light passes through to the other side — less transmit-
ted light means more absorbed light, which means a greater concentration of sample. Beer’s
Law is a useful equation that expresses this idea:
A = a · b · c
where A is the light absorbed by the sample, a is the molar absorptivity of the substance
(a property that varies from one substance to another), and b is the length of the path
traveled by the radiation through the sample. To make this easy in practice, solutions are
often put into flat sided cells, so the length of the path is easily measured. The variable c is
the concentration of the substance.
Equations that relate the rate of a reaction to the concentration of some species (reactant or
product) in solution are called rate laws. The exact form a rate law assumes depends on the
reaction involved. Countless research studies have described the intricacies of rate laws in
chemical reactions. Here, we focus on rate laws for only the simplest reactions.
In general, rate laws take the form
Reaction rate = k [reactant A]m[reactant B]n
The rate law shown describes a reaction whose rate depends on the concentration of two
reactants, A and B. Other rate laws for other reactions may include factors for greater or
fewer reactants. In this equation, k is the rate constant, a number that must be experimentally
measured for different reactions and reaction conditions (that is, different temperatures, sol-
vents, etc.). The exponents m and n are called reaction orders, and must also be measured for
different reactions. A reaction order reflects the impact of a change in concentration in over-
all rate. If m > n, then a change in the concentration of A affects the rate more than does
changing the concentration of B. The sum, m + n, is the overall reaction order.
Some simple kinds of reaction rate laws crop up frequently, so they’re worth your notice:
 Zero-order reactions: Rates for these reactions don’t depend on the concentration of
any species, but simply proceed at a characteristic rate:
Rate = k
 First-order reactions: Rates for these reactions depend linearly on the concentration of
a single species:
Rate = k[A]
209
Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

 Second-order reactions: Rates for these reactions may depend on the concentration of
one or two species (or some intermediate combination):
Rate = k[A]2
or
Rate = k[A][B]
Figure 21-2 illustrates how changing the reaction order changes the progress of a reaction;
the more the rate of a reaction depends on the concentration of a reactant, the more severely
the reaction slows down as that reactant is used up.
Because the initial concentration of reactants may vary from one reaction to another,
chemists often find it useful to employ integrated rate equations, which describe the reactant
concentration at time t ([A]t) with respect to the initial concentration of a reactant, usually
designated [A]0. 
Another useful mathematical tool is half-life, the time it takes for the concentration of a reac-
tant to drop to one half of its initital value. This value is usually given the symbol t1/2.
Figure 21-3 summarizes the rate laws, integrated rate laws, rate constant units, and half-life
equations for the three most common reaction types. Other types are not expected in AP.

Changing Rates: Factors That Alter Kinetics
Despite the impression given by their choice in clothing, chemists are finicky, tinkering
types. They often want to change reaction rates to suit their own needs. What can affect
rates, and why? Temperature, concentration, and catalysts influence rate. In this section, we
describe how these factors can change reaction rates, and we show how those changes are
expressed mathematically in the Arrhenius equation, an important equation that relates reac-
tion rate to the activation energy of a chemical reaction. Finally, we give a brief summary of
how reaction rates are used to help figure out chemical reaction mechanisms, the nitty-gritty
details about how exactly chemical reactions occur.
Seeing rate changes in terms of collisions
The effects of these changes can be understood in light of the collision model, in which chem-
ical reactions occur when reactatnts slam into one another with sufficient energy and in just
the right way, As shown in Figure 21-4, if the collision isn’t “just right” the reactants will
bounce away and no new products are formed.
Here is a summary of the major factors that affect reaction rates:
 Reaction rates tend to increase with temperature. This trend results from the fact
that reactants must collide with one another to have the chance to react. If reactants
collide with the right orientation and with enough energy, the reaction can occur. So,
the greater the number of collisions, and the greater the energy of those collisions,
the more actual reacting takes place. An increase in temperature corresponds to an
increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles in a reacting mixture — the parti-
cles move faster, colliding more frequently and with greater energy. So an increase in
temperature provides a “double whammy” effect — increased number of colissions
(per second) and increased average energy per collision. Make sure you include both
of these in your AP exam answer.

Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

 Increasing concentration or surface area tends to increase reaction rate. The reason
for this trend also has to do with collisions. Higher concentrations mean there are
more reactant particles to undergo more collisions per second and have a greater
chance of reacting. Increasing the concentration of reactants may mean dissolving
more of those reactants in solution. Some reactants aren’t completely dissolved, but
come in larger, undissolved particles. In these cases, smaller particles lead to faster
reaction. Smaller particles have a greater fraction of the reactant molecules (like
Compound A) on the surface where they can more easily react with molecules of
Compound B, making a greater portion of the particles available for reaction.
 Catalysts increase reaction rates. Catalysts don’t themselves undergo overall chemical
change, and they don’t alter the amount of product a reaction can eventually produce
(the yield). However, they do enhance the probablility of a reaction occurring. Most
catalysts form temporary complexes with one or both reactant molecules, holding
them in more appropriate orientation for reaction. Then the product is released, leav-
ing the catalyst to “fight another day” or engage more reactants over and over. Thus
catalysts are often only needed in very small amounts to increase the rate of a reaction.
Chemists (who like to define things, if you didn’t realize that by now), separate cata-
lysts into two types. Homogenous catalysts are of the same phase (solid, liquid, gas) as
the reacting molecules, and heterogeneous catalysts are in a different phase. Catalysts
operate mostly in the way described, but all of those ways have to do with decreasing
activation energy, the hill in chemical potential energy that reactants must climb to
reach a transition state, the highest-energy state along a reaction pathway. Lower activa-
tion energies mean faster reactions. Figure 21-5 shows a reaction progress diagram, the
energetic pathway reactants must traverse to become products. The figure also shows
how a catalyst affects reactions, by lowering the activation energy without altering the
energies of the reactants or products. If you think this diagram looks much like a roller
coaster, you are right! In that case, the energy is gravitational potential energy, rather
than chemical potential energy — but the effect is the same. Too little kinetic energy or
too big a hill — no ride or no reaction.
Relating rate to activation energy
Concentration, temperature, and the the activation energy, Ea, help determine the rate of a reac-
tion. The influence of concentration is clearly evident in the rate laws shown in Figure 21-3. But
where is the influence of temperature and activation energy? These two factors help determine
the rate constant, k, as shown in the Arrhenius equation:

Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

In the Arrhenius (yes the same Arrhenius who worked out what acids are doing) equation,
k is calculated by raising the natural logarithm (base number e, approximately 2.718) to a
rational exponent. The exponent, –Ea / RT, is the negative of the activation energy divided by
the product of the gas constant, R, and the temperature, T. This whole power is multiplied
by a prefactor (sometimes called the frequency factor), A. This factor has the same units as
k and depends on the reaction order. It is hard to calculate theoretically, though it relates
to the effectiveness of the collisions in “going over the hill,” and is often an experimental
measurement.
The Arrhenius equation can be rearranged into different forms that are more or less conven-
ient for different purposes. If you know a variety of values for k and T, and would like to
determine Ea, then you may want to use this form:
The previous equation corresponds to a linear plot of ln k versus 1/T. The slope of the line is
equal to –Ea / RT and the y-intercept equals ln A. 
If you know the rate constant at one temperature and would like to predict it at another tem-
perature, then you may want to use this form:
Using rates to determine mechanisms
Measuring reaction rates can help you figure out mechanism, the molecular details by which
a reaction takes place. Chemical reactions can be broken down into a series of elementary
steps, simple events involving only one or two molecules that occur with characteristic rates.
Each elementary step has a certain molecularity, the number of molecular bits that must col-
lide within that step. Unimolecular steps require one molecule, bimolecular steps require
two molecules, and termolecular steps require three molecules. Termolecular steps are rare,
as are collisions at one intersection of three cars (except in the movies).
Most reaction mechanisms consist of several elementary steps. Only a few of these steps
consume or produce chemical players that you see in the formal reaction equation. The
other players, the ones on the path between the formal reactants and products, are called
intermediates. Much chemical research on reaction mechanisms is concerned with establish-
ing the important elementary steps and detecting and defining intermediates.
Each elementary step in a multireaction has its own rate law. The slowest step acts as a
bottleneck and determines the overall rate of the reaction. For this reason, the slow step is
called the rate determining step. If an intermediate step is the slow step, chemists often
assume that the previous, faster steps come to equilibrium during all the time afforded to
them by the bottleneck.
Whatever the details, two things are always true:
 For a mechanism to be true, the rate law proposed by that mechanism must agree with
the observed rate law.
 Mechanisms can never be proved correct directly by kinetics, but incorrect mecha-
nisms can be disproved.

Getting There at All: Thermodynamics 
and State Functions
Figure 21-6 shows a reaction progress diagram like the one shown in Figure 21-5, but high-
lights the difference in energy between reactants and products. This difference is completely
independent of activation energy, which is discussed in the previous section. Although acti-
vation energy controls the rate of a reaction, the difference in energy between reactants and
products determines the extent of a reaction — how much reactant will have converted to
product when the reaction is complete.
A reaction that has produced as much product as it ever will is said to be at equilibrium. We
discuss equilibrium at length in Chapter 15. You may want to refer to that chapter for a quick
refresher on that important concept, particularly on how equilibrium is quantified by the
equilibrium constant, Keq. Here, we are primarily concerned with the thermodynamics of
equilibrium — how the equilibrium position of a reaction relates to energy changes as a
reaction proceeds.
The difference in energy between reactants and products is built into the rules that deter-
mine the Keq for a reaction. The particular form of energy important in this relationship is
called free energy, G. You may sometimes see this called the Gibbs free energy (hence the G),
in honor of one of the earliest American chemists, Josiah Willard Gibbs. According to Gibbs
every chemical possesses a quantity of “free energy” G depending on what it is and what the
conditions (phase, temperature, pressure) are.  While it is extremely difficult to find out what
this is, changes in this value can easily be tracked by smart chemists. The relationship
between free energy and equilibrium is
∆G = –RT ln Keq
or
In these equations, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin degrees. Favorable
(spontaneous) reactions possess negative values for ∆G and unfavorable (nonspontaneous)
reactions possess positive values for ∆G. Energy must be added to drive an unfavorable reac-
tion forward. If the ∆G for a set of reaction conditions is 0, the reaction is at equilibrium. But
be careful! These values only apply at a specific set of conditions. A reaction that is non-
spontaneous under one set of conditions may be spontaneous if those conditions change. For

example, most people think of hydrogen and oxygen reacting pretty spontaneously to form
water, but heat water to thousands of degrees and it will split into hydrogen and oxygen! 
Free energy is an example of a state function, a property of a system that depends only on its
characteristics in the given moment. State functions don’t care about how you got here, only
about who you are. But they change as conditions change! Your state function is different in
bed at home as compared to sitting at your desk in school. In addition to free energy, other
state functions include enthalpy, H, and entropy, S. At constant pressure, enthalpy equals the
the thermal energy content of a system. Entropy is a measure of the energy of disorder in a
system.
Energy is a pretty abstract concept. Before looking further into how energy governs chemical
reactions, it might be useful to remind yourself of three things that are always true — the
laws of thermodynamics:
First Law: In any process, the total energy of the universe remains constant. Remember,
chemists divide the universe into two parts, the system and the surroundings. Universe =
system + surroundings. The system and the surroundings can exchange energy; the
universe cannot.
Second Law: In any spontaneous process, the overall entropy of the universe
increases. Things that happen on their own do so with an increase in disorder. If you
focus only on the system, the increased disorder may not be apparent, as it may occur
in the surroundings. In fact, complex chemical reactions (such as the biochemical ones
in our bodies) often increase order at the expense of the disorder in the surroundings.
Third Law: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system
approaches a constant minimum. If the system is a pure, perfectly ordered crystalline
solid, then that minimum of entropy is also zero.
Chemical reactions are processes that occur in the universe. So, chemical reactions obey the
laws of thermodynamics. If you encounter a chemical reaction that fails to obey these laws,
patent it. You’ll probably find some investors willing to lose money on it.
Two other concepts follow closely on the heels of the thermodynamic laws: reversibility and
irreversibility. In a reversible process, a system can go back to its original state by reversing
its steps along the same path it originally took. When a reaction is at equilibrium, mass (in
the form of atoms) moves between reactant and product states reversibly.
In an irreversible process, the system may be able to return to its original state, but must
do so along a different path. Spontaneous processes are irreversible, as they irrevocably
increase the entropy of the universe. Never fear, irreversible processes and their properties
do not show up on AP chemistry exams.
Adding Up the Energies: Free Energy,
Enthalpy, and Entropy
Three different kinds of energy are important for determining whether or not a particular
change occurs, such as whether or not a chemical reaction goes forward. These three kinds
of energy are
 Gibbs free energy, G, the portion of a system’s energy that is available to do work
 Enthalpy, H, the thermal energy content of a system at constant pressure
 Entropy, S, a measure of the portion of a system’s energy that is unavailable to do
work; entropy is related to disorder
215
Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

By tracking changes in these three energies between different states (like the reactant and
product states of a chemical reaction), you can determine whether a change will occur on
its own, or whether that change needs to be driven forward by the addition of energy. The
change in Gibbs free energy, ∆G, is negative for spontaneous processes, ones that occur on
their own. The change in Gibbs free energy can be seen in terms of changes in enthalpy and
entropy in the Gibbs equation:
∆G = ∆H – T∆S (where T is temperature in Kelvin)
The Gibbs equation reveals that spontaneity arises from the interplay of enthalpy and
entropy, two state functions that underlie free energy. A lot of AP questions revolve around
which is the winning term on the righthand side, so get all your ducks (sorry, arguments) in a
row here. Negative changes in enthalpy are spontaneous, as are positive changes in entropy.
Note that the effect of entropy changes on the free energy (which are generally 1,000 times
smaller than enthalpy changes) is magnified by the temperature. The upshot of this equation
is that chemical reactions can be driven forward by spontaneous changes in enthalpy,
entropy, or both. If the changes in neither enthalpy nor entropy are spontaneous, then the
reaction will not occur spontaneously. These patterns are summarized in Figure 21-7.
But wait! The second law of thermodynamics states that all spontaneous processes occur
with a positive change in entropy — how can a chemical reaction be driven forward by
enthalpy alone? Good question. Answer: The second law refers to the entropy of the universe.
The Gibbs equation refers to the enthalpy and entropy of the system. A decrease in the
enthalpy of a system means an increase in the entropy of the surroundings, which means
an increase in the entropy of the universe. The second law holds true. What a relief.
Under standard conditions (typically, 1atm, pure substances at 1M concentration), the state
functions are said to be in standard state and the state functions of the Gibbs equation are

However, while most free energy changes are quoted at 298K, technically this is not defined
by the “standard conditions.” Texts will provide tables where the temperature is clearly
indicated, as in ∆Go
298. Some texts may omit this, in which case 298K temperature must be
assumed.
Changes in standard free energy, standard enthalpy, and standard entropy for a reaction can
be calculated directly from the stoichiometry of the reaction along with tabulated values.
The tabulated values are those for the standard free energies, enthalpies, or entropies of forma-
tion of the reactants and products, ∆Gf°, ∆Hf° and ∆Sf°, respectively:
∆G° = Σ a∆Gf°(products) – Σ b∆Gf°(reactants)
∆H° = Σ a∆Hf°(products) – Σ b∆Hf°(reactants)
∆S° = Σ a∆Sf°(products) – Σ b∆Sf°(reactants)
where Σ refers to the sum of products or reactants and where a and b refer to the stoichio-
metric coffiecients of each product or reactant. Standard enthalpies and entropies of forma-
tion are the enthalpies and entropies associated with forming a compound under standard
conditions (1atm, 298K, 1mol L-1) from its component elements, in their elemental forms
under standard conditions.
The relationship between the standard free energy and the free energy under nonstandard
conditions is:
∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q
where Q is the reaction quotient (see Chapter 15). Compare this equation to
and be sure you understand the differences.
Measuring Heat: Thermochemistry and
Calorimetry
Energy shifts between many forms. It may be tricky to detect, but energy is always con-
served. Sometimes energy reveals itself as heat. Thermodynamics explores how energy
moves from one form to another. Thermochemistry investigates changes in thermal energy
that accompany chemical reactions. To understand how thermochemistry is done, you need
to first understand how the particular form of energy called thermal energy and the elusive
term “heat” fit into the overall dance of energy and matter. In this section, we discuss how
thermal energy fits into the overall energy picture, and we describe how you can measure
heat transfer during chemical reactions by using a concept called heat capacity and a tech-
nique called calorimetry.
Seeing heat within the bigger energy picture
You’re probably familiar with the idea that objects can have greater or lesser amounts of
energy associated with them. One of the kinds of energy an object can possess is thermal
energy. In this section, we show how thermal energy relates to the overall energy of a system
(like a chemical system), and how thermal energy relates to heat.

Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Energy itself can be divided into
 Potential energy (PE) is energy due to position. Chemical energy is a kind of potential
energy, arising from the positions of particles within systems.
 Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion. Thermal energy is a kind of kinetic energy,
arising from the movement of particles within systems.
The total internal energy of a system (E) is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies.
When a system moves between two states (as it does in a chemical reaction), the internal
energy may change as the system exchanges energy with the surroundings. The difference
in energy (∆E) between the initial and final states derives from heat (q) added to or lost from
the system, and from work (w) done by the system or on the system. “Heat” in physics and
chemistry is strictly defined as a quantity of thermal energy being transferred between one
system and another. As a result nothing can “contain” heat!
We can summarize these energy explanations with the help of a couple of handy formulas:
Etotal = KE + PE
∆E = Efinal – Einitial = q + w
What kind of “work” can atoms and molecules do in a chemical reaction? Remember (maybe)
from your physics class that work is defined in terms of motion against a force. No motion,
no work! One kind of work that is easy to understand is pressure-volume work. Consider the
following reaction:
CaCO3(s) →CaO(s) + CO2(g)
Solid calcium carbonate decomposes into solid calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. At
constant pressure (P), this reaction proceeds with a change in volume (V). The added
volume comes from the production of carbon dioxide gas. As gas is made, it expands, push-
ing against the surroundings. The carbon dioxide gas molecules do work as they push into a
greater volume:
w = –P∆V
The negative sign in this equation means that the system loses internal energy due to the
work it does on the surroundings. If the surroundings did work on the system, thereby
decreasing the system’s volume, then the system would gain internal energy. Note that if
there were no pressure (resistive force), then P = 0, so w = 0 . . . so there is no work! So,
expanding into a vacuum a gas does no work! 
So, pressure-volume work can partly account for changes in internal energy during a reaction.
When pressure-volume work is the only kind of work involved, any remaining changes come
from heat. As mentioned in the previous section, enthalpy (H) corresponds to the thermal
energy content of a system at constant pressure. An enthalpy change (∆H) in such a system
corresponds to heat. The enthalpy change equals the change in internal energy minus the
energy used to perform pressure-volume work:
∆H = ∆E – (–P∆V) = ∆E + P∆V
Although E, P, V, and H are state functions, heat (q) is not a state function, but is simply a
quantity of thermal energy that transfers from a warmer object to a cooler object.
218
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Now breathe. The practical consequences of all this theory are the following:
 Chemical reactions involve an amount of heat, q.
 Chemists monitor changes in thermal energy by measuring changes in temperature.
 At constant pressure, the change in thermal energy content equals the change in
enthalpy, ∆H.
 Knowing ∆H values helps to explain and predict chemical behavior.
Using heat capacity in calorimetry
Heat is a quantity of thermal energy that transfers from warmer objects to cooler objects.
But how much thermal energy can an object hold? If objects have the same thermal energy
content, does that mean they are the same temperature? You can measure temperature
changes, but how do these temperatures relate to heat? These kinds of questions revolve
around the concept of heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise
the temperature of a system by 1K (or 1°C). In this section, we describe how the concept of
heat capacity is used in an experimental technique called calorimetry.
It takes longer to boil a large pot of water than a small pot of water. With the burner set on
high, the same amount of heat transfers into each pot, but the larger pot of water has a higher
heat capacity. So, it takes more heat transfer to increase the temperature of the larger pot.
You’ll encounter heat capacity in different forms, each of which is useful in different scenarios.
Any system has a heat capacity. To best compare heat capacities between chemical systems
you use one of the following:
 Molar heat capacity, which is the heat capacity of 1 mole of a substance
 Specific heat capacity, or just specific heat, which is the heat capacity of 1 gram of a
substance
How do you know whether you’re dealing with heat capacity, molar heat capacity, or specific
heat capacity? Look at the units:
 Heat capacity: Energy / K
 Molar heat capacity: Energy / (mol·K)
 Specific heat capacity: Energy / (g°K)
Fine, but what are the units of energy? Well, that depends. The SI unit of energy is the joule (J)
(see Chapter 3 for more about the International System of units), but the units of calorie (cal)
and liter-atmosphere (L·atm) may also be used. Here’s how the joule, the calorie, and the liter-
atmosphere are related (AP will stick to joules!):
1 J = 0.2390 cal
101.3 J = 1 L·atm
Note that in everyday language about nutrition, a “calorie” actually refers to a “Calorie” or a
kilocalorie — a calorie of cheesecake is 1,000 times larger than you think it is. Why do you
think the American food industry wants to keep it that way? In Europe and Canada, candy
bars are rated in kilojoules, so a 100 calorie bar is 418 kJ of energy.

Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Calorimetry is a family of techniques that puts all this thermochemical theory to use. When
chemists do calorimetry, they initiate a reaction within a defined system, and then measure
any temperature change that occurs as the reaction progresses. There are a few variations
on the theme of calorimetry, each measuring heat transfer under different conditions:
 Constant-pressure calorimetry directly measures an enthalpy change (∆H) for a reaction
because it monitors heat transferred at constant pressure: ∆H = qP.
Typically, heat is observed through changes in the temperature of a reaction solution.
If a reaction warms a solution, then that reaction must have released thermal energy
into the solution. In other words, the change in thermal energy content of the reaction
(qreaction) has the same magnitude as the change in thermal energy for the solution 
(qsolution) so the heat into one is the same as the heat out of the other, but has opposite
sign: qsolution = – qreaction.
So, measuring qsolution allows you to calculate qreaction, but how can you measure qsolution?
You do so by measuring the difference in temperature (∆T) before and after the reaction:
qsolution = (mass of solution) × (specific heat of solution) × ∆T
In other words,
q = mCP∆T
Here, “m” is the mass of the solution and CP is the specific heat capacity of the solution
at constant pressure. ∆T is equal to Tfinal – Tinitial.
When you use this equation, be sure that all your units match. For example, if your CP
has units of J g–1 K–1, don’t expect to calculate heat flow in kilocalories.
 Constant-volume calorimetry directly measures a change in internal energy, ∆E (not ∆H)
for a reaction because it monitors heat flow at constant volume. Often, ∆E and ∆H are
very similar values, especially if no gases are involved to do pressure-volume work.
A common variety of constant-volume calorimetry is bomb calorimetry, a technique in
which a reaction (often, a combustion reaction) is triggered within a sealed vessel
called a bomb. The vessel is immersed in a water bath of known volume. The vessel
and water together are considered the “calorimeter” and are enclosed by an insulated
container. The temperature of the water is measured before and after the reaction.
Because the heat capacity of the calorimeter (Ccal) is known, you can calculate heat
from the change in temperature:
q = –Ccal × ∆T
Dealing with Heat by Using Hess’s Law
So, as you find out in the previous section, you can monitor heat by measuring changes in
temperature. But what does any of this have to do with chemistry? Chemical reactions trans-
form both matter and energy. Though reaction equations usually list only the matter compo-
nents of a reaction, you can consider thermal energy as a reactant or product as well. When
chemists are interested in heat appearing during a reaction (and when the reaction is run at
constant pressure), they may list an enthalpy change (∆H) to the right of the reaction equa-
tion. As we explain in the previous section, at constant pressure, heat equals ∆H:
qP = ∆H = Hfinal – Hinitial
If the ∆H listed for a reaction is negative, then that reaction releases heat as it proceeds —
the reaction is exothermic. If the ∆H listed for the reaction is positive, then that reaction
absorbs heat as it proceeds — the reaction is endothermic. In other words, exothermic reac-
tions release heat as a product, and endothermic reactions consume heat as a reactant.
220
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

The sign of the ∆H tells us the direction of heat, but what about the magnitude? The coeffi-
cients of a chemical reaction represent molar equivalents. So, the value listed for the ∆H
refers to the enthalpy change for one molar equivalent of the reaction. Here’s an example:
CH4(g)+2O2(g)→CO2(g)+ 2H2O(g)
∆H = –802 kJ
The reaction equation shown describes the combustion of methane, a reaction you might
expect to release heat. The enthalpy change listed for the reaction confirms this expectation:
For each mole of methane that combusts, 802 kJ of heat are released. The reaction is highly
exothermic. Based on the stoichiometry of the equation, you can also say that 802 kJ of heat
are released for every 2 moles of water produced. 
So, reaction enthalpy changes (or reaction “heats”) are a useful way to measure or predict
chemical change. But they’re just as useful in dealing with physical changes, like freezing and
melting, evaporating and condensing, and others. For example, water (like most substances)
absorbs heat as it melts (or fuses) and as it evaporates:
Molar enthalpy of fusion: ∆Hfus = 6.01 kJ
Molar enthalpy of vaporization: ∆Hvap = 40.68 kJ
The same sorts of rules apply to enthalpy changes listed for chemical changes and physical
changes. Here’s a summary of the rules that apply to both:
 The heat absorbed or released by a process is proportional to the moles of sub-
stance that undergo that process. Two moles of combusting methane release twice as
much heat as does one mole of combusting methane.
 Running a process in reverse produces heat flow of the same magnitude but of
opposite sign as running the forward process. Freezing one mole of water releases
the same amount of heat that is absorbed when one mole of water melts.
Yikes. Earlier in the chapter we described that chemical reactions can be complicated, multi-
step sorts of things. Now we’re telling you that both chemical and physical processes can be
associated with heat. How can you possibly keep track of all these heats? The answer is
simple: Hess’s Law.
Imagine that the product of one reaction serves as the reactant for another reaction. Now
imagine that the product of the second reaction serves as the reactant for a third reaction.
What you have is a set of coupled reactions, connected in series like the cars of a train:
A →B
and
B →C
and
C →D
So,
A →B →C →D
You can think of these three reactions adding up to one big reaction, A →D. What is the over-
all enthalpy change associated with this reaction, ∆HAD? Here’s the good news:
∆HAD = ∆HAB + ∆HBC + ∆HCD
Enthalpy changes are additive. Hess’s Law declares that the total enthalpy change for the
overall reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each of the steps, as summarized in
Figure 21-8.
221
Chapter 21: Knowing Speed from Spontaneity: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

But the good news gets even better. Imagine that you’re trying to figure out the total enthalpy
change for the following multistep reaction:
X →Y →Z
Here’s a wrinkle: For technical reasons, you can’t measure this enthalpy change, ∆HXZ, directly,
but must calculate it from tabulated values for ∆HXY and ∆HYZ. No problem, right? You simply
look up the tabulated values and add them. But here’s another wrinkle: When you look up the
tabulated values, you find the following:
∆HXY = –37.5 kJmol–1
∆HZY = –10.2 kJmol–1
Gasp! You need ∆HYZ, but you’re provided only ∆HZY! Relax: Reactions are reversible. The
enthalpy change for a reaction has the same magnitude and opposite sign as the enthalpy
change for the reverse reaction. So, if ∆HZY = –10.2 kJmol–1, then ∆HYZ = 10.2 kJmol–1. It really is
that simple. So,
∆HXZ = ∆HXY + (–∆HZY) = –37.5 kJmol–1 + 10.2 kJmol–1 = –27.3 kJmol–1
Thanks be to Hess.

hapter 21 gave a broad overview of the relationships between differences in energy and
the rates and equilibria observed for chemical reactions. These kinds of relationships
are fundamental to chemistry and are ripe pickings for the AP chemistry exam. Do yourself
a favor: Be sure you know the principles at work behind kinetics and thermodynamics and
can apply those principles to problems. The best way to ensure that you know what you
need to know about kinetics and thermodynamics is to review the tips and suggestions in
this chapter and then practice the questions included.
Picking through the Important Points
For many students, the most difficult thing about kinetics and thermodynamics is telling the
two apart. Both subjects describe things about chemical reactions. Both use a wealth of
mathematical equations. Both have something to do with energy. Before launching into this
summary of the highlights of Chapter 21, make sure you understand that kinetics and ther-
modynamics, though interrelated, deal with entirely separate issues: 
 Kinetics deals with the rate at which reactants convert to products and how that rate
depends on concentrations during a reaction.
 Thermodynamics deals with differences in different types of energy (enthalpy and
entropy) between reactants and products and how those differences relate to concen-
trations at equilibrium.
Important points about rates
The rules for measuring and describing the speed of a reaction are expressed in equations.
Luckily, the equations are pretty simple and easy to interpret. Seeing all of them together
helps make clear how all the equations relate to each other. Instead of spending time trying
to memorize all these equations, spend time trying to understand how they all relate to one
another.

In summary, here are the important points about rate made in Chapter 21:
 The rate of a reaction does not determine the final extent of a reaction, nor does the
final extent of a reaction determine the rate.
 For the reaction: A + B →C
• Average rate = -∆[A]/∆t = –∆[B]/∆t = ∆[C]/∆t.
• Instantaneous rate = –d[A]/dt = –d[B]/dt = d[C]/dt.
 For the reaction: A + 2B →C
• Instantaneous rate = –d[A]/dt = –1/2d[B]/dt = d[C]/dt.
 You can extract rates from the shapes of reaction progress curves, which plot the con-
centration of a reactant or product versus time.
 Concentrations of reactants or products can be measured spectrophotometrically,
using Beer’s law: A = abc
 For a reaction with two reactants in its rate-determining step: 
Rate = k [reactant A]m[reactant B]n.
• k is the rate constant and depends on reaction conditions.
• Exponents m and n are reaction orders and depend on reaction conditions.
• The sum, m + n, is the overall reaction order.
 Zero-order reactions: Rates don’t depend on any concentration.
• Rate = k.
 First-order reactions: Rates depend on the concentration of a single species.
• Rate = k[A].
 Second-order reactions: Rates may depend on the concentration of one or two
species:
• Rate = k[A]2
or
Rate = k[A][B].
 Integrated rate equations describe the rate of a reaction with respect to the initial con-
centration of a reactant.
For a first-order reaction: [A] = [A]0·e-kt.
or equivalently 
ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]0.
 Half-life describes the time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to drop to one
half of its initital value.
• For a first-order reaction: t1/2 = (ln 2) / k.
 Reaction rates tend to increase with temperature.
 Increasing concentration tends to increase reaction rate.
 Catalysts increase reaction rates, but do not alter concentrations or final amounts pro-
duced at equilibrium.
• Catalyts decrease activation energy, the energetic hill reactants must climb to
reach a transition state.
 The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant, k, to activation energy, Ea, and tem-
perature, T, and a constant, A (the “frequency factor”), related to reactant orientation
and frequency of collisions:
 The slowest elementary step in a reaction mechanism is the rate-determining step.

Important points about thermodynamics
As described in Chapter 21, thermodynamics is about big ideas and (usually) small equa-
tions. Thermodynamic concepts can seem a bit abstract, so as you peruse the highlights in
this summary, anchor your brain to the idea that thermodynamics has nothing whatever to
do with how fast a reaction proceeds — only how far it goes. Thermodynamics cares only
about beginning and end states.
Re-energize your grasp of thermodynamics by perusing these points: 
 Laws of Thermodynamics:
• First Law: In any process, the total energy of the universe remains constant.
Universe = system + surroundings.
• Second Law: In any spontaneous process, the overall entropy of the universe
increases.
• Third Law: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system
approaches a constant minimum.
 The equilibrium constant, Keq, is related to the difference in free energy, ∆G, between
products and reactants:
∆G = –RT ln Keq
This equation can be rearranged to the following form:
 Favorable (spontaneous) reactions possess negative values for ∆G and unfavorable
(nonspontaneous) reactions possess positive values for ∆G.
 The Gibbs equation relates the difference in free energy (∆G) between products and
reactants to the differences in enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S) and the temperature of
the system in Kelvin:
• ∆G = ∆H – T∆S
 Under standard conditions (usually 1atm, pure substances at 1M concentration), the
Gibbs equation reflects “standard state” quantities:
• ∆G° = ∆H° – T∆S°
 Nonstandard ∆G relates to standard ∆G° via corrections concentration (as reflected in Q,
the reaction quotient):
• ∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q
 Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a system by 1K.
• Molar heat capacity is the heat capacity of 1 mole of a substance.
• Specific heat capacity is the heat capacity of 1 gram of a substance.
 Constant-pressure calorimetry directly measures an enthalpy change (∆H) for a reac-
tion because it monitors heat flow at constant pressure: ∆H = qP.
• q = mCP∆T
 Constant-volume calorimetry directly measures a change in internal energy, ∆E (not
∆H) for a reaction because it monitors heat flow at constant volume.
 q = –Ccal × ∆T
 Exothermic reactions release heat as a product, ∆H<0. Endothermic reactions con-
sume heat as a reactant, ∆H>0.

 Hess’s Law (enthalpies are additive):
• For the set of coupled reactions,
A →B →C →D
the following is true:
∆HAD = ∆HAB + ∆HBC + ∆HCD
• Before adding reaction equations, you may need to manipulate those equations,
and doing so has consequences on the associated ∆H values: 
Reaction: A →B
Enthalpy change: ∆HAB
compare that to:
Reaction: 2A →2B
Enthalpy change: 2·∆HAB

Answers with Explanations
Having worked through all those problems on rates, energy, work, and heat, you may be feel-
ing a bit depleted of energy yourself. Hang in there long enough to check your answers.
1. (D). Rate laws include a concentration factor for each reactant whose concentration affects
the rate. Each concentration factor has an exponent, even if that exponent is simply 1. The
exponent on each factor is the individual reaction order for that component. The overall
reaction order is the sum of the individual reaction orders.
2. (C). The rate observed for Reaction 1 depends on the rate law for the reaction: Rate = k[A]2.
Component B doesn’t even show up in the rate law, so cutting in half the concentration of B
has no effect on the rate. However, doubling the concentration of A has a major effect on
the rate because the reaction is second order in A (meaning that the concentration factor
for A has an exponent of two). You can calculate the rate change associated with doubling A
by substituting in simple numbers for A within the rate law. If the original concentration of A
is 1 and the doubled concentration is 2, then the original and final rates are k and 4k, respec-
tively. So, doubling the concentration of A increases the rate fourfold.
229
Chapter 22: Answering Questions on Kinetics and Thermodynamics

3. (D). As described in the answer to question 2, the rate observed for Reaction 2 depends on
the rate law for the reaction: Rate = k[D][E]. The reaction is first order in D and first order in
E (and second order overall). You can calculate the effect of changing the concentrations of
D and E by substituting simple numbers. If the original concentrations of D and E are 1 and 1,
respectively, then the new concentrations are 2 and 3, respectively. So, the original rate is
k(1)(1) = k, and the new rate is k(2)(3) = 6k. The changes in concentration result in a sixfold
increase in rate.
4. (C). You can figure out the relationship between the rates of change of all the reactants and
products by inspecting the balanced reaction equation. D + E →F + 2G. First, because D and
E are reactants and F and G are products, it’s clear that the rates of change in D and E have
opposite sign to those of F and G — as D and E decrease in concentration, F and G increase
in concentration. Second, you must account for the stoichiometric coefficients in the reac-
tion equation. Two moles of product G are made for every one mole made of product F and
for every one mole consumed of reactants D and E. So, the rate of change in D, E, and F is
one half the rate of change in G, as indicated by the coefficient of 0.5. Note that in answer C,
whether each term is positive or negative has nothing whatever to do with whether a reac-
tant or product is gained or lost during the reaction; positive versus negative values simply
indicate that the rates occur in opposite directions. 
5. (E). The reaction equation makes clear that for each mole of methane consumed, 2 moles of
oxygen gas are consumed and 1 mole of carbon dioxide is produced. So
d[CH4]/dt = 0.5d[O2]/dt = –d[CO2]/dt
This means that the disappearance of 2.79mol s–1 of methane corresponds to the appear-
ance (positive change) of 2.79mol s–1 of CO2 and the disappearance (negative change) of 2 –
2.79 = 5.58mol s–1 of O2. The concentration of methane changes at half the rate of oxygen, so
the concentration oxygen changes at twice the rate of methane.
6. (A). Doubling the concentration of either reactant (D or E) doubles the rate. So, the data are
consistent with the rate law, Rate = k[D][E]. Solve for k by substituting known values of rate
[D] and [E] from any of the trial reactions:
k = Rate / ([D][E]) = 4.8 × 106 M s–1 / (2.7 × 10–2 M × 2.7 × 10–2 M) = 6.6 × 109 M –1 s–1.
Use this calculated value of k to determine the rate in the presence of 1.3 × 10–2 M reactant D
and 9.2 × 10–3 M reactant E:
Rate = (6.6 × 109 M –1 s–1)(1.3 × 10–2 M)(9.2 × 10–3 M) = 7.9 × 105 M s–1.
7. (C). You can calculate the free energy change directly from the equilibrium constant and the
temperature by using the equation: ∆G = –RTlnKeq. But to use the equation properly, you
must make sure that all your units match. Specifically, notice that the temperature given to
you in the problem has units of Celsius degrees, while the gas constant given has tempera-
ture units of Kelvin. Convert the temperature to Kelvin first: 25 °C = (25 + 273)K = 298K.
Then, substitute into ∆G = –RTlnKeq. You are told that Keq = 1.37 × 103, so:
∆G = (–1)(8.314 J K–1mol–1)(298K)ln(1.37 × 103) = –1.79 × 104 J mol-1
8. (E). Although the free energy of a system must decrease during a spontaneous process (oth-
erwise the process would not be spontaneous), both etropy and enthalpy can either
decrease or increase during that process. The reason for this flexibility in entropy and
enthalpy is made clear by the Gibbs equation:
∆G = ∆H – T∆S
230
Part IV: Transforming Matter in Reactions 

Decreases in enthalpy are favorable and increases in entropy are favorable, it is true.
However, an unfavorable change in enthalpy can be compensated by a sufficiently favorable
change in entropy and vice versa, such that the overall free energy change for the process is
favorable, and the process is spontaneous. Note that, although entropy may decrease within a
system, entropy always increases for the universe as a whole (system + surroundings = uni-
verse).
9. (E). Rates can certainly change during the course of a reaction because rates are frequently
dependent on concentrations, as expressed by rate laws. Because concentrations change
during the reaction, so do the rates. Rate constants and activation energies are a different
matter, however. For a given reaction at a given temperature, the rate constant and activa-
tion energy are related by the Arrhenius equation:
The Arrhenius equation contains no terms for concentration of reactants or products, so
the rate constant and activation energy typically remain constant for a given reaction. 
10. (C). Potential energy is the portion of total energy due to the position of particles. Chemical
energy is essentially potential energy because energy is stored within chemical bonds as a
result of the favorable position of electrons between adjacent nuclei.
11. (B). The change in total energy of a system is the sum of heat flow and work:
∆E = Efinal – Einitial = q + w
Positive heat flow (+q) is heat flow into the system, which increases the total energy of the
system. Positive work (+w) is work done on the system (not by the system), and also
increases the total energy of the system.
12. (E). Pressure-volume work is one kind of work that can be done on a system or by a system,
especially by expanding or contracting gases: w = –P∆V. If gas within a system expands against
the surroundings (increasing the system’s volume), then the system has done work on the
surroundings and the sign of work is negative. If the surroundings expand against the system
(decreasing the system’s volume), then the surroundings have done work on the system and
the sign of work is positive.
13. (D). Kinetic energy is the portion of total energy due to the motion of particles. In an ideal
gas, kinetic energy consists entirely of translating particles. In real substances, other forms
of motion contribute to the kinetic energy, like vibration and rotation. The average kinetic
energy of the particles of a system is proportional to the temperature of that system.
14. (A). Transform as it may between different forms and slip as it may between system and
surroundings, the total energy of the universe remains constant.
15. (A). The key to setting up this problem is to realize that whatever heat flows out of the lead
flows into the water, so: qlead = –qwater. Calculate each quantity of heat by using q = mCP∆T.
Recall that ∆T = Tfinal – Tinitial. The unknown in the problem is the initial temperature of lead.
qlead = (375g)(0.127J g–1 K–1)(297K – Tinitial)
To calculate qwater, you must first calculate the mass of 0.500L water by using the density of
water: 0.500L × (1.00kg L–1) = 0.500kg = 500g:
qwater = (500g)(4.18J g–1 K–1)(297K – 293K) = 8.36 × 103J

Setting qlead equal to –qwater and solving for Tinitial yields 473K:
(375g)(0.127J g–1 K–1)(297K – Tinitial) = –8.36 × 103J
297K – Tinitial = –176K
Tinitial = 473K
16. (B). Reverse Reaction 2 and divide it by 2 to get Reaction 2' (∆H = +483kJ). Reverse Reaction
3 and divide it by 2 to get Reaction 3' (∆H = +319kJ). Add Reactions 1, 2', and 3', yielding ∆H =
+197kJ. Reactions 2 and 3 need reversing to put the right compounds on the reactant and
product sides of the equation. Reaction 1 already has the right orientation. Reactions 2 and
3 must be divided by 2 so that the stoichiometry of the final equation matches the stoi-
chiometry of the target equation (namely, one mole each of H2O, CO and H2). Even though
this division temporarily creates noninteger coefficients for O2 in these equations, the non-
integer coefficients cancel out when you add reactions 1, 2', and 3'.

n earlier times, chemists relied extensively on high-tech
instruments like “eyes” and “noses” and so forth.
Chemistry used to be largely a descriptive science, with-
out the extensive calculations and precise measurements
that characterize it today. Qualitative observations are
still a useful part of chemistry, and understanding qualita-
tive patterns in things like color and solubility is a big part
of developing an elusive and prized skill called “chemical
intuition.” This part gives an overview of descriptive
chemistry as it applies to the AP Chemistry exam. Organic
chemistry is another branch of chemical science with
deep roots and time-honored, qualitative traditions. But
beyond its history, organic chemistry is a huge modern
enterprise with massive application in medicine and
industry, among other things. We close this part by giving
you a glimpse into organic chemistry, the chemistry of
carbon-based compounds, preparing you for its inevitable
appearance on the exam.

here are a bunch of elements. These elements assemble into a ridiculously large variety
of compounds. Then, just to make things more complicated, the compounds react with
one another in different ways. To reduce the headache-inducing complexity of chemistry, it
helps to know the lay of the land, to be familiar with a few details and themes that pop up
over and over. Knowing these patterns helps you to develop a sense for whether certain
compounds will react and what products they might generate. Also, sometimes things
happen during a chemical reaction that are visible to the naked eye — solid particles or
bubbles appear as if from nowhere — and these events give important clues as to the micro-
scopic details of the reaction. Getting a feel for these kinds of things is what some people
call “chemical intuition.” In this chapter, you gain some chemical intuition so you can make
predictions about how reactions will turn out.
Using Your Senses: Qualitative Aspects of
Common Reaction Types
Seen from the outside, chemistry can seem weird. Mix two clear solutions and you never
know what might happen. Maybe a solid (called a precipitate) will form, settling to the
bottom of the beaker. Maybe gas will bubble out of the mixture. Maybe the final solution will
be green. Maybe nothing will happen. How can you predict? Knowing which compounds
you’re mixing is a good start. Armed with that information, you might be able to identify a
likely reaction. The sections that follow list some common themes and patterns that might
prove helpful on the AP chemistry exam.
Precipitation reactions
Precipitation occurs when an insoluble compound forms during the course of a reaction.
Usually, the insoluble product is an ionic compound, formed between metal and nonmetal
components. Being able to predict when precipitates form requires you to know which com-
pounds are soluble and which are insoluble. Here are some helpful guidelines to help you
sniff out which compounds are likely to precipitate and which are likely to stay in solution.

Precipitation reactions can occur when ionic compounds react, typically in double displace-
ment reactions. In double displacement reactions, the cation components of ionic com-
pounds swap anionic partners. So, if you are presented with two ionic reactant compounds,
AB(aq) + CD(aq) →?
perform the following steps to complete the reaction and predict the products. 
1. Swap the anion and cation partners to predict the reaction equation:
AB(aq) + CD(aq) →CB(?) + AD(?)
2. Next, inspect the products to see if either or both are insoluble. Here are some basic
rules for judging whether an ionic compound is soluble.
Compounds that contain the following ions are soluble:
• NH4
+
• Group IA (column 1) cations (that is, alkali metal ions)
• NO3
–
• ClO3
–, ClO2
–
• CH3COO– (acetate ion, which can also be written as C2H3O2
–)
Compounds that contain the following ions are usually soluble:
• Cl–, Br– and I– (except when paired with Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg2
2+)
• SO4
2– (except when paired with Ag+, Pb2+, Hg2
2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+)
Compounds that contain the following ions are usually insoluble:
• OH– (that is, hydroxides, except when paired with Group IA cations, Sr2+, Ca2+,
and Ba2+)
• CO3
2–, PO4
3–, SO3
2–, and S2– (except when paired with Group I cations or NH4
+)
3. After you determine whether you have a product that is insoluble, rewrite the com-
pleted reaction equation as a net ionic equation. Net ionic equations list only those
components of the reaction that change state during the reaction. Ions in aqueous solu-
tion are listed separately, as ions, and not as part of a compound. Ions that appear on
both the reactant and product sides (these are called spectator ions) are omitted. Thus,
Na2CO3(aq) + Ba(NO3)2(aq) →?
undergoes a double displacement reaction, yielding:
4. Na2CO3(aq) + Ba(NO3)2(aq) →2NaNO3(?) + BaCO3(?)Once you have the completed reac-
tion and have assigned phases, write a total ionic equation. The solubility rules state
that the sodium nitrate pair is soluble, but when barium ion and carbonate ion com-
bine, a solid precipitate forms. The resulting total ionic equation is
2Na+(aq) + CO3
2–(aq) + Ba2+(aq) + 2NO3
–(aq) →2Na+(aq) + 2NO3
–(aq) + BaCO3(s)
5. Then, remove the spectator ions (Na+ and NO3
–), leaving the net ionic equation:
CO3
2–(aq) + Ba2+(aq) →BaCO3(s)
Aside from precipitation reactions, you should be familiar with the basic patterns and
common players in other reaction types, including gas-releasing reactions, reactions of
hydrides and oxides, combustion reactions, reactions involving colored compounds, and
acid-base reactions.
236
Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Gas-releasing reactions
Gas-releasing reactions often include decomposition or the reaction of metals/metal hydrides
with water.
Gas-releasing decomposition can result from several processes:
 Heating: Adding heat to some compounds can cause them to decompose (break apart)
into several products, some of which are gases. For example
• CaCO3(s) →CaO(s) + CO2(g)
• 2KNO3(s) →2KNO2(s) + O2(g)
• 2KClO3(s) →2KCl(s) + 3O2(g)
• 2H2O2(l) →2H2O(l) + O2(g)
 Electrolysis:. Molten ionic compounds can be decomposed when an electric current
passes through them, releasing gas in the process:
2Na+(l) + 2Cl–(l) →2Na(l) + Cl2(g)
Or, shown as two redox half-reactions
2Na+(l) + 2e– →2Na(l)
(reduction)
2Cl–(l) →Cl2(g) + 2e–
(oxidation) 
 Unstable acids: Some weak acids are unstable and can decompose, especially if they
aren’t in solution while heat is added.
H2SO3(s) →H2O(l) + SO2(g)
H2CO3(s) →H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Metals and metal hydride reactions
Metals and metal hydrides can release hydrogen gas when they react with water. These reac-
tions result in a basic solution as hydrogen is taken from water leaving excess hydroxide ions:
 LiH(s) + H2O(l) →Li+(aq) + OH–(aq) + H2(g)
 CaH2(s) + 2H2O(l) →Ca2+(aq) + 2OH–(aq) + 2H2(g)
 2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) →2Na+(aq) + 2OH–(aq) + H2(g)
Combustion reactions
Complete combustion occurs when hydrocarbons react with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide
and water.
 2C2H6(g) + 7O2(g) →4CO2(g) + 6H2O(g) (ethane combusts)
 C2H4(g) + 3O2(g) →2CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) (ethene combusts)
 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) →4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) (ethyne combusts)
237
Chapter 23: Knowing Chemistry When You See It: Descriptive Chemistry

Oxide reactions
The pattern of an oxide reaction depends on whether it is a metal oxide or nonmetal oxide
that reacts.
Metal oxides often react with water to produce basic solutions.
Li2O(s) + H2O(l) →2Li+(aq) + 2OH–(aq)
Nonmetal oxides often react with water to produce acidic solutions.
N2O5(s) + H2O(l) →2NO3
–(aq) + 2H+(aq)
Colored compounds
Knowing something about which compounds are colored and what colors those compounds
are can help you identify an unknown compound.
Salts and oxides that contain transition metals are often colored.
 Ni-containing compounds are often green.
 Mn-containing compounds are often pink/purple.
 Colored soluble salts
• Fe-containing soluble salts are red and/or brown.
• Cu-containing soluble salts are blue and/or green.
• Co-containing soluble salts are blue.
 Colored insoluble salts
• Precipitates containing CrO4
2– (chrmate) are yellow.
• Precipitates containing Cr2O7
2– (dichromate) are orange.
• Precipitates containing OH– (hydroxide) are white.
• Precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) is white.
• Precipitate of silver bromide (AgBr) is pale yellow.
Acids and bases
Acid-base reactions are very common and confuse many students. Key to understanding
these reactions is being able to identify the acid and the base, and understanding how strong
acids and bases behave differently from weak acids and bases. Acids and bases have pre-
dictable properties and reactions:
 A strong acid is a weak base. A strong base is a weak acid.
 The conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid. The conjugate base of a weak acid is
a weak base.
 Strong acids react with strong bases to form neutral salts and water.
 Strong acids react with weak bases to form acidic solutions.
 Strong bases react with weak acids to form basic solutions.
238
Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Surveying the Table: Predicting 
Properties and Reactivity
There are two basic ways to look at the periodic table. You can pick a property and observe
the trends in that property as you move left and right or up and down the table. Or, you can
pick a row or column of the table and observe changes or the lack of changes in various
properties as you move along the members of the column or row.
Reading trends across the table 
The key periodic property is electronegativity, the tendency of an atomic nucleus to draw
electrons toward itself within a bond. Electronegativity tends to increase to the right and
upward within the main body of the periodic table, as shown in Figure 23-1. Electronegativity
represents the result of a balance between an unbound atom’s ionization energy (tendency to
lose an electron) and its electron affinity, the ability of an unbound atom to attract an elec-
tron. Ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove an electron from a gas-phase atom.
Trends in electronegativity, ionization energy (Figure 23-2), and electron affinity underlie other
periodic trends, such as atomic radius (Figure 23-3), and metallic character (Figure 23-4).
Atomic radius and metallic character are also largely determined by electronegativity, but
both follow a pattern that is the mirror image of electronegativity, as each increases down-
ward and to the left within the periodic table.

Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Finding patterns in columns and rows
The trends described in the previous section help explain why the elements within a vertical
group of the periodic table tend to have properties similar to one another, whereas elements
across a horizontal period display incremental changes in their properties, with a consistent
trend.
Some groups hang together more closely than others. Within the periodic table, the two left-
most and two rightmost groups show the greatest kinship, keeping tightly to the characteris-
tic properties of their respective vertical families. So, you can feel most confident making
predictions based on the group similarity of leftmost columns (columns 1 and 2) and two
columns on the right (columns 16 and 17). In addition, the elements in group VIIIA (column 18),
the noble gases, have closely identifiable properties to one another. Note that two methods
are used to identify columns in the periodic table. The older one uses A and B columns, the
newer one has been adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
(IUPAC) and the American Chemical Society. Both will be used here.
 Alkali metals (Group IA or 1)
• Elemental alkali metals are extremely reactive, and their cations are extremely
unreactive.
• Alkali metals are the least electronegative, easily giving up electrons to form
cations.
• In compounds, alkali metals have an oxidation number of +1.
• Though listed with Group IA, hydrogen is not a metal and has some very different
properties:
• In compounds with nonmetals, hydrogen assumes an oxidation number
of +1.
• In compounds with metals, hydrogen assumes “hydride” form, with an
oxidation number of –1.
 Alkaline earth metals (Group IIA or 2)
• Alkaline earth metals are very reactive, and their cations are very unreactive.
• Alkaline earth metals have very low electronegativity.
• In compounds, alkaline earth metals have an oxidation number of +2.
 VIA or 16
• These elements are reactive because they have six electrons in their valence
shell, not the stable, eight-electron valence shell of a noble gas.
• Ions of this group tend to have –2 charge.
 Halogens (Group VIIA or 17)
• Halogens are very electronegative, with the most electronegative at the top.
• In compounds, halogens usually have an oxidation number of –1.
• Halogens range in reactivity (though none are unreactive), with the most reactive
at the top.
• Halogens form ionic compounds with metals and molecular compounds with
nonmetals.
 Noble gases (Group VIIIA or 18)
• Noble gases are the least reactive of the elements, due to their filled valence
shells.

escriptive chemistry, as you may have gathered from Chapter 23, is perhaps the most
memorization-intensive area covered by the AP chemistry exam. But fight the impulse
to sweep it under the rug — having an intuitive feel for periodic trends and the broad pat-
terns of common chemical reactions is an invaluable asset. Help gel your chemical intuition
by reviewing the highlights of Chapter 23 and applying your insights to the practice ques-
tions provided here.
Keeping the Important Stuff Straight
Because descriptive chemistry includes a lot of “just-have-to-know” details, this summary of
ideas from Chapter 23 is one that you’ll probably want to review well and often, even more
than the summaries of many other chapters. To make the task easier, the bits and pieces are
grouped into categories that reflect specific reaction types or specific perioidic patterns.
Focus on one category at a time, attempting to master each one before moving on to the
others. That way, you won’t lose your way in the swirl of details. 
Precipitation reactions
Much of the previously mentioned memorization has to do with knowing which ionic com-
pounds are soluble in water and which are not. You need this knowledge to predict the
phases of products of ionic double displacement reactions, so you can properly write net
ionic equations.
Here is a summary of solubility rules and the process of formulating net ionic equations:
 Precipitation reactions can occur when ionic compounds react, typically in double
displacement reactions.
 Compounds that contain the following ions are soluble: NH4
+, Group IA cations, NO3
–,
ClO3
–, ClO2
–, CH3COO–.
 Compounds that contain the following ions are usually soluble: Cl–, Br–, and I– (except
with Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg2
2+); SO4
2– (except with Ag+, Pb2+, Hg2
2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+).

 Compounds that contain the following ions are usually insoluble: OH– (except with
Group IA cations, Sr2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+); CO3
2–, PO4
3–, SO3
2–, and S2– (except with Group IA
cations or NH4
+).
 Net ionic equations list only those components of the reaction that change state during
the reaction. Spectator ions, those ions that appear in the same fashion on both the
reactant and product sides, are omitted.
Patterns of common reaction types
Beyond precipitation, it pays to know the patterns of common reaction types that you’ll
likely encounter on the AP exam, including gas-releasing reactions, complete combustion,
reactions of oxides, and acid-base reactions.
Here is a concise summary of the patterns you can expect from the most commonly tested
reaction types:
 Gas-releasing decomposition can result from heating, electrolysis, and unstable acids
(especially H2CO3 and H2SO4).
 Metals and metal hydrides can release hydrogen gas when they react with water, pro-
ducing a basic solution (excess hydroxide ion).
 Combustion occurs when hydrocarbons and other compounds containing carbon-
hydrogen bonds, such as alcohols, react with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide and
water.
 Metal oxides often react with water to produce basic solutions.
 Nonmetal oxides often react with water to produce acidic solutions.
 Salts and oxides that contain transition metals are often colored.
 Acids and bases
• A strong acid is a weak base. A strong base is a weak acid.
• The conjugate anion of a strong acid is a very weak base. The conjugate cation of
a strong base is a very weak acid.
• The conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid. The conjugate base of a weak
acid is a weak base.
• The conjugate acid of a weak base is a stronger acid than the base and the conju-
gate base of of a weak acid is a stronger base than the acid.
• Strong acids react with strong bases to form neutral salts and water.
• Salts of weak acids or bases react in water to form weakly acidic or basic solutions.
Periodic trends and group properties
The periodic table is periodic for a reason — the elements of the table are arranged to reflect
recurring patterns in the properties of the elements. Those patterns emerge from trends in
the number of valence electrons held by the elements. Although learning these patterns
requires a bit of initial memorization, knowing them saves you a load of memorization in the
long run.
244
Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Here are the key periodic trends and the properties of important groups of elements:
 Electronegativity, electron affinity, and ionization energy tend to increase upward and
to the right within the main body of the periodic table.
 Atomic radius and metallic character tend to increase downward and to the left within
the main body of the periodic table.
 Alkali metals (Group IA) are extremely reactive, and their cations are extremely unre-
active; they are the least electronegative elements; they have an oxidation number of
+1 within compounds.
Hydrogen is not a metal: In compounds with nonmetals, hydrogen has oxidation
number +1; in compounds with metals, hydrogen has oxidation number –1.
 Alkaline earth metals (Group IIA) are very reactive, and their cations are very unreac-
tive; they have very low electronegativity; they have an oxidation number of +2 within
compounds.
 Halogens (Group VIIA) are very electronegative and range in reactivity, with the most
electronegative and most reactive at the top; they form ionic compounds with metals
and molecular compounds with nonmetals; they usually have an oxidation number of
–1 within compounds.
 Noble gases (Group VIIIA) are extremely unreactive. The larger atoms (Kr and Xe) can
form compounds with strongly electronegative atoms such as fluorine and oxygen.

Checking Your Work
If you feel like a few of your answers may have been less than perfect, check them against the
answers and explanations below. If you’re certain that you nailed the questions, check your
answers anyway, if only to revel in your perfection.
1. (E). Combustion of a hydrocarbon (like propane) involves a combination reaction with
oxygen gas, yielding carbon dioxide and water products. Here’s the balanced equation for
the combustion of propane:
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) →3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)
From the balanced equation, it’s clear that oxygen is consumed, not produced. Moreover,
the moles of products (3 + 4 = 7) outnumber the moles of reactants (1 + 5 = 6). Finally, the
carbon dioxide and water products can undergo a further reaction to form carbonic acid:
CO2(g) + H2O(l) →H2CO3(aq)
2. (D). Overall, electronegativity increases upward and to the right on the periodic table.
3. (C). Overall, metallic character increases downward and to the left on the periodic table.
4. (D). Overall, ionization energy increases upward and to the right on the periodic table
(just like electronegativity).
5. (E). HBr and Ca(OH)2 are a strong acid and a strong base, respectively, that undergo a neu-
tralization reaction to produce water and the soluble salt, CaBr2. Although the nitrate salt of
lead is soluble (like virtually all nitrate salts), most other lead salts (like PbI2) are insoluble.
Although ammonium phosphate is soluble (like virtually all ammonium salts), only Group IA
and ammonium salts of phosphate are soluble — other phosphate salts (like Mg3(PO4)2) are
insoluble.
6. (B). Chlorate (ClO3
–) salts tend to decompose with heat, yielding oxygen gas. Ionic com-
pounds containing hydroxide (OH–) do not tend to decompose with heat. Metal hydrides
(like NaH) tend to produce hydrogen gas when they react with water. Reactive metals (like
Group IA and Group IIA metals) tend to react with acid (H+) to produce hydrogen gas.
Reactive metals also tend to react with water to produce hydrogen gas.
7. (A). Nonmetal oxides (like P4O10) tend to react with water to produce acidic (pH < 7)
solutions:
P4O10(g) + 6H2O(l) →12H+(aq) + 4PO4
3-(aq)
Metal oxides (like MgO) tend to react with water to produce basic (pH > 7) solutions:
MgO(s) + H2O(l) →Mg2+(aq) + 2OH–(aq)
Metal hydrides (like SrH2) tend to react with water, releasing hydrogen gas and producing a
basic solution:
SrH2(s) + 2H2O(l) →Sr2+(aq) + 2OH–(aq) + 2H2(g)
8. (B). Decreasing temperature usually decreases the solubility of solid solutes. Adding CO3
2-
anion by means of sodium carbonate decreases the solubility of CaCO3 due to the common
ion effect, in which the added carbonate shifts the equilibrium toward undissolved CaCO3.
249
Chapter 24: Answering Questions on Descriptive Chemistry

Decreasing pH increases CaCO3 solubility because the added H+ undergoes a secondary
reaction with CO3
2-, shifting the overall equilibrium toward dissolved CaCO3:
CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) →Ca2+(aq) + CO3
2-(aq)
H+(aq) + CO3
2-(aq) →HCO3
–(aq)
9. (B). Conjugates of strong acids are very weak bases.
10. (A). Transition metals are notorious for forming intensely colored coordination complexes.
11. (D). In a neutralization reaction, acid and base reactants react to form a salt and water.
12. (E). Hydrides (especially metal hydrides) tend to react with water to produce hydrogen 
gas, H2.
13. (C). Weak acids are the conjugate acids of weak bases.
14. (C). To generate a net ionic equation, list dissolved (soluble) compounds as dissociated
ions. Then, cancel any spectator ions, which are those ions that appear in identical form on
both sides of the reaction equation. What remains is the net ionic equation. For example:
AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) →NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)
Ag+(aq) + NO3
–(aq) + Na+(aq) + Cl–(aq) →Na+(aq) + NO3
–(aq) + AgCl(s)
Ag+(aq) + Cl–(aq) →AgCl(s)
15. (B). The positive and negative signs at the top of the figure indicate the polarity of the volt-
age source for the electrolytic cell. Because electrons have negative charge, they migrate
out of the liquid toward the positive pole along 2, and into the liquid away from the negative
pole along 1.
16. (D). If the liquid indicated by 5 is molten LiCl, then the salt is dissociated into Li+ cations
and Cl– anions. Molten salts can be decomposed by electrolysis in this kind of cell. The elec-
trode at 3 acts as a cathode, delivering electrons to Na+(l) cations, which deposit there as
Na(s) metal. The electrode at 4 acts as an anode, accepting electrons from Cl–(l) anions,
which react with one another to form Cl2(g) at the electrode.

rganic chemistry is a huge subfield, and the AP chemistry exam merely scratches the
surface of it. Still, a good grasp of the concepts and naming rules covered in this chapter
could get you those few extra points needed to push your score up one grade on exam day. 
Don’t spend too much time here if you’re still struggling with the big-point-gaining chapters
earlier in this book. Your time is better spent polishing your knowledge of the concepts in
those earlier chapters, if you’re struggling, because so few questions on the AP exam address
organic chemistry. But if you feel comfortable with the big-point-gaining chapters, then tackle
this chapter with vigor and get ready to file lots of new information away in that chemistry-
packed brain of yours — organic chemistry is heavy on memorization. 
In addition to the few questions on each AP exam directly addressing organic chemistry, a
basic knowledge of the information in this chapter, including basic structure and naming. can
aid you in answering many other questions on the exam. Organic compounds are sometimes
used in questions testing concepts such as kinetics, stoichiometry, and colligative properties.
Naming Names: Nomenclature and
Properties of Hydrocarbons
Any study of organic chemistry begins with the study of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are
some of the simplest and most important organic compounds and they contain only hydrogen
and carbon atoms. Organic compounds are based on carbon skeletons. Carbon skeletons can
be modified — you can dress them up with chemically interesting atoms like oxygen, nitrogen,
halogens, phosphorous, silicon, or sulfur. This cast of atomic characters may seem like a
rather small subset of the more than 100 elements in the periodic table. It’s true: Organic com-
pounds typically use only a very small number of the naturally occurring elements. Yet these
molecules include the most biologically important compounds in existence. In this section
you will learn how to recognize and name all of the types of hydrocarbons that appear on
the AP exam, including alkenes, alkanes, alkynes, and cyclic hydrocarbons. 

Starting with straight-chain alkanes —
linear hydrocarbons
The simplest of the hydrocarbons fall into the category of alkanes. Alkanes are chains of
carbon atoms connected by single covalent bonds. Chapter 5 describes how single covalent
bonds result when atoms share pairs of valence electrons. Carbon molecules have four
valence electrons. So, carbon atoms are eager to donate their four valence electrons to cova-
lent bonds so that they can receive four donated electrons in turn, filling their valence shell.
In other words, carbon really likes to form four bonds. In alkanes, each of these is a single
bond with a different carbon or hydrogen partner.
The simplest of the alkanes, called continuous- or straight-chain alkanes, consist of one straight
chain of carbon atoms linked with single bonds. Hydrogen atoms fill all the remaining bonds.
Other types of alkanes include closed circles and branched chains. 
We begin with straight-chain alkanes because they make clear the basic strategy for naming
hydrocarbons. From the standpoint of naming, the hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon are
more or less “filler atoms.” Alkanes’ names are based on the largest number of consecutively
bonded carbon atoms. So, the name of a hydrocarbon tells you about that molecule’s struc-
ture. To name a straight-chain alkane, simply match the appropriate chemical prefix with the
suffix -ane. The prefixes relate to the number of carbons in the continuous chain, which we
list in Table 25-1.

The naming method in Table 25-1 tells you how many carbons are in the chain. Because
you know that each carbon has four bonds and because you are fiendishly clever, you can
deduce the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule as well. Any carbon at the end of a
chain must be bonded to three hydrogens and all interior carbons must be bonded to two.
Consider the carbon structure of pentane, for example, shown in Figure 25-1.
C

252
Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Only four carbon-carbon bonds are required to produce the five-carbon chain of pentane.
This leaves many bonds open — two for each interior carbon and three for each of the termi-
nal carbons. These open bonds are satisfied by carbon-hydrogen bonds, thereby forming a
hydrocarbon, as shown in Figure 25-2.
If you add up the hydrogen atoms in Figure 25-2, you get 12. So, pentane contains 5 carbon
atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms.
As the organic molecules you study get more and more complicated, it will become more
and more important to draw the molecular structure to visualize the molecule. In the case of
straight-chain alkanes, the simplest of all organic molecules, you can remember a convenient
formula for calculating the number of hydrogen atoms in the alkane without actually drawing
the chain:
Number of hydrogen atoms = (2 × number of carbon atoms) + 2
You can refer to the same molecule in a number of different ways. For example, you can refer
to pentane by its name (ahem . . . pentane), by its molecular formula, C5H12, orby the com-
plete structure in Figure 25-2. Clearly, these different names include different levels of struc-
tural detail. A condensed structural formula is another naming method, one that straddles the
divide between a molecular formula and a complete structure. For pentane, the condensed
structural formula is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3. This kind of formula assumes that you understand
how straight-chain alkanes are put together. Carbons on the end of a chain, for example, are
only bonded to one other carbon, so they have three additional bonds to be filled by hydro-
gen and are labeled as CH3 in a condensed formula. Interior carbons are bonded to two
neighboring carbons and have only two hydrogen bonds, and so are labeled CH2.
Going out on a limb: Making branched 
alkanes by substitution
Not all alkanes are straight-chain alkanes. That would be too easy. Many alkanes are so-called
branched alkanes. Branched alkanes differ from continuous-chain alkanes in that carbon
chains substitute for a few hydrogen atoms along the chain. Atoms or other groups (like
carbon chains) that substitute for hydrogen in an alkane are called substituents.
Naming branched alkanes is slightly more complicated, but you need only to follow these
simple set of steps to arrive at a proper (and often lengthy) name:
1. Count the longest continuous chain of carbons. Tricky chemistry problems often show
branched alkanes with the longest chain snaking through a few branches instead of
obviously lined up in a row. Consider the two carbon structures shown in Figure 25-3.
The two are actually the same structure, drawn differently! Yikes. In either case, the
longest continuous chain in this structure has eight carbons. That wasn’t hard — and
yippee, now you already know the basic name for the compound. It is an octane.

Chapter 25: Living with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

2. Number the carbons in the chain starting with the end which is closest to a branch.
You can always check to be sure you have done this step correctly by numbering the
carbon chain from the opposite end as well. The correct numbering sequence is the
one in which the substituent branches extend from the lowest-numbered carbons. For
example, as it is drawn and numbered in Figure 25-3, the alkane has substituent groups
branching off of its third, fourth, and fifth carbons. If the carbon chain had been num-
bered backward, these would be the fourth, fifth, and sixth carbons in the chain.
Because the first set of numbers is lower, the chain is numbered properly. The longest
chain in a branched alkane is called the parent chain.
3. Count the number of carbons in each branch. These groups are called alkyl groups
and are named by adding the suffix -yl to the appropriate alkane prefix (Table 25-1
awaits your visit). The three most common alkyl groups are the methyl (one carbon),
ethyl (two carbons), and propyl (three carbons) groups. Figure 25-3 has two methyl
groups, one ethyl group, and no propyl groups.
Be careful when you find yourself dealing with alkyl groups made up of more than just
a few carbons. A tricky drawing may cause you to misnumber the parent chain!
4. Attach the number of the carbon from which each substituent branches to the front
of the alkyl group name. For example, if a group of two carbons is attached to the
third carbon in a chain, like it is in Figure 25-3, the group is called 3-ethyl.
5. Check for repeated alkyl groups. If multiple groups with the same number of carbons
branch off the parent chain, do not repeat the name. Rather, include multiple numbers,
separated by commas, before the alkyl group name. Also, specify the number of
instances of the alkyl group by using the prefixes di-, tri-, tetra-, and so on. For example,
if one-carbon groups (in other words, methyl groups) branch off carbons four and five
of the parent chain, the two methyl groups appear together as “4,5-dimethyl.”

6. Place the names of the substituent groups in front of the name of the parent chain in
alphabetical order. Prefixes like di-, tri-, and tetra- do not figure into the alphabetizing.
So, the proper name of the organic molecule in Figure 25-3 is 3-ethyl-4,5-dimethyloctane.
Note that hyphens are used to connect all the naming elements except for the last
connection to the parent chain, which includes neither a hyphen nor a space 
(. . . dimethyl-octane is wrong). We recommend practicing alkanes till you get them
in your sleep before moving on to other organic compounds!
Getting unsaturated: Alkenes and alkynes
Carbons can do more than engage in four single bonds. There’s more to organic molecules
than substituent-for-hydrogen swaps:
 When carbons in an organic compound fill their valence shells entirely with single
bonds, we say the compound is saturated.
 When hydrocarbons contain carbons that bond to each other more than once, creating
double or triple covalent bonds, we say these hydrocarbons are unsaturated because
they have fewer than the maximum possible number of hydrogens or substituents. 
For every additional carbon-carbon bond formed in a hydrocarbon, two fewer covalent
bonds to hydrogen are formed.
When neighboring carbons share four valence electrons to form a double bond, the resulting
hydrocarbon is called an alkene. Alkenes are characterized by these chemically interesting
double bonds, which are more reactive than single carbon-carbon bonds (see Chapter 7 for a
review of sigma and pi bonding). Double bonds also change the shape of a hydrocarbon,
because the sp2 hybridized valence orbitals assume a trigonal planar geometry, as shown by
the carbons of ethene in Figure 25-4. Saturated carbon is sp3 hybridized and has tetrahedral
geometry (again, see Chapter 7 to review hybridization).
Naming alkenes is slightly more complicated than naming alkanes. In addition to the number
of carbons in the main chain and any branching substituents, you must also note the loca-
tion of the double bonds in an alkene and incorporate that information into the name.
Nevertheless, the essential naming strategy for alkenes is quite similar to that for alkanes:
1. Locate the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond, and number it, start-
ing at the end closest to the double bond. In other words, double bonds trump sub-
stituents when it comes to numbering the parent chain. Build the name of the parent
chain by using the same prefixes as used for alkanes (refer to Table 25-1), but match
the prefix with the suffix -ene. A three-carbon chain with a double bond, for example,
is called “propene.”
2. Number and name substituents that branch off the alkene in the same way as done
for alkanes (see the section earlier in this chapter, “Starting with straight-chain
alkanes — linear hydrocarbons” for more on naming alkanes). List the number of
the substituted carbon, followed by the name of the substituent. Separate the sub-
stituent number and name with a hyphen.

255
Chapter 25: Living with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

3. Identify the lowest-numbered carbon that participates in the double bond, and put
that number between the substituent names and the parent chain name (sand-
wiched by hyphens), but after all the substituent names. For example, if the second
and third carbons of a five-carbon alkene engage in a double bond, then the molecule is
called 2-pentene, not 3-pentene. If that same molecule has a methyl substituent at the
fourth carbon, then the molecule is called 4-methyl-2-pentene.
Alternately, and especially when there are substituents present, the position of an
unsaturation is indicated between the prefix and suffix of the parent chain name. So, 
4-methyl-2-pentene may also be written 4-methylpent-2-ene.
Alkynes are hydrocarbons in which neighboring carbons share six electrons to engage in triple
covalent bonds. The naming strategy for alkynes is the same as that for alkenes, except that
the alkyne parent chain is named by matching the prefix with the suffix -yne.
An important consequence of the presence of multiple bonds in alkenes and alkynes is their
marked increase in reactivity over alkanes. Generally speaking, the more multiple bonds a
compound has, the more reactive it tends to be. This is because of the propensity of multiple
bonded carbons to undergo addition reactions, which are discussed at the end of this chapter.
Rounding ’em Up: Circling Carbons 
with Cyclics and Aromatics
The compounds we discuss earlier in this chapter are linear or branched. However, hydro-
carbons can be circular, or cyclical, hydrocarbons There are two important categories of
cyclical hydrocarbons:
 Cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons
 Aromatic hydrocarbons
Chemists sometimes divide hydrocarbons into aliphatic and aromatic categories to highlight
important differences in structure and reactivity. Without going into more technical detail
than is useful here, aliphatic molecules and aromatic molecules have significantly different
electronic configurations (which electrons go into which orbitals). As a result, the two types
of hydrocarbons typically undergo different kinds of reactions. In particular, they tend to
undergo different kinds of substitution reactions, ones in which some atom or group substi-
tutes for hydrogen.
Shutting the circle with cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons
Cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons are like the hydrocarbons that we discuss earlier in this chap-
ter, except that they form a closed ring. The rules for naming these compounds build on the
rules for naming alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. For example, a cyclical six-carbon alkane
includes the name “hexane,” but is preceded by the prefix cyclo-, making the final name
“cyclohexane.”
A single substituent or unsaturation on a cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon does not require a
number. So, a single methyl-for-hydrogen substitution on cyclohexane yields a compound
with the name methylcyclohexane. Likewise, a lone double bond unsaturation on cyclo-
hexane yields a compound with the name cyclohexene.
Multiple substitutions or unsaturations require numbering. In these cases, the same rules
apply for deciding the rank of substituents as applied to alkenes and alkynes. Triple bonds
256
Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

outrank double bonds. Double bonds outrank other substitutions. So, number the carbons
in the way that respects these rankings and produces the lowest overall numbers. A cyclo-
hexane molecule with two methyl substituents on neighboring carbons, for example, is
called 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.
Analyzing aromatic hydrocarbons
Aromatic hydrocarbons have special properties because of their electronic structure.
Aromatics are both cyclic and conjugated: 
 Cyclic: The carbons form a ringlike structure.
 Conjugated: Conjugation results from an alternation of double or triple bonds with
single bonds. 
Aromatic molecules have clouds of delocalized pi electrons, electrons that move freely
through a set of overlapping p orbitals. The model aromatic compound is benzene. Because
of its cyclical, conjugated bonding, pi electrons delocalize evenly into rings above and below
the plane of the flat benzene molecule. Aromatic compounds are very stable compared to
their aliphatic counterparts.
Numbering substituents on aromatics follows the same basic pattern as followed for cyclic
aliphatic compounds. A single substituent requires no numbering, as in methylbenzene.
Multiple substituents are numbered by rank, with the highest-ranked substituent placed
on carbon number one, and proceeding in a way that results in the lowest overall numbers.
A benzene ring with ethyl and methyl substituents situated two carbons away from one
another, for example, would be called 1-ethyl-3-methylbenzene.
Decorating Skeletons: Organic
Functional Groups
Surely you’ve noticed that in this chapter we have thus far limited our study of organic com-
pounds to those made entirely of hydrogen and carbon. When studying the complex rules
governing hydrocarbons, it is easy to forget that the periodic table contains more than 100
other elements. Although organic chemistry often concentrates on just a few of those ele-
ments, you’ll need to be familiar with many other compound types, and this time they’ll be
made of more than just hydrogen and carbon. All of these exotic new compounds contain
plain vanilla carbon chains, but each has a distinguishing feature composed of another, more
exotic element. These embellishments are called functional groups. These groups include
noncarbon elements, and give organic compounds a dizzying array of different properties.
Because hydrocarbons are old news, we sometimes refer to them simply using the letter R,
representing any hydrocarbon group: branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated.
Table 25-2 summarizes the other important organic compounds, their distinguishing features,
and their endings. Some molecules contain more than one of these distinguishing features.
Locations where one of these groups or a multiple bond appear are prime sites for reactions
to occur. These sites are therefore called functional groups. Carefully study the functional
group column in Table 25-2 so you can recognize them quickly. These are the structures you
should keep an eye out for later in this chapter.

Alcohols: Hosting a hydroxide
Alcohols are hydrocarbons with a hydroxide group attached to them. Their general form is 
R-OH. To name an alcohol, you simply count the longest number of consecutive carbon
atoms in the chain, find its prefix Table 25-2, and then attach the ending -ol to that prefix. For
example, a one-carbon chain with an OH group attached is methanol, two is ethanol, three is
propanol, and so on. Substituents (groups branching off the main chain) must, as always, be
accounted for, and you must specify the number of the carbon atom in the chain to which
the hydroxyl (OH) group is attached. Begin your numbering at the end of the chain closest
to the OH, and attach the number before the prefix + -ol. For example, the compound shown
in Figure 25-5 contains a six-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group. Its base name is therefore

hexanol. It has methyl groups (with one carbon each) on the second and fourth carbons and
its OH group lies on the third carbon. Its proper name is therefore 2,4-dimethyl-3-hexanol.
Some alcohols are polyhydroxyl, or contain multiple hydroxyl groups. In order to avoid confu-
sion with multiples of any substituent groups, the prefixes indicating numbers of hydroxyl
groups in an alcohol are attached to the suffix ol, making them diols, triols, etc. For example,
a four carbon alcohol containing hydroxyl groups on the first and third carbons is 1,3-butane-
diol. The numbers indicating the locations of the hydroxyl groups must come before the base
name but after any substituent groups.
Ethers: Invaded by oxygen
Perhaps most commonly known for their use as early anesthetics, ethers are carbon chains
that have been infiltrated by an oxygen atom. These oxygen atoms lie conspicuously in the
middle of a carbon chain like badly disguised spies in an enemy camp and have the general
formula R-O-R. Ethers are named by naming the alkyl groups on either side of the lone oxygen
as substituent groups individually (adding the ending -yl to their prefixes), and then attaching
the word ether to the end. For example, the compound shown in Figure 25-6 is an ether with a
methyl group (one carbon) on one side of the oxygen and an ethyl (two carbons) on the other.
Placing the substituents in alphabetical order, the compound’s proper name is ethyl methyl
ether.
Oxygen atoms in ethers are often surrounded by two identical alkyl groups, in which case the
prefix di- must be attached to the name of that substituent. For example, an oxygen sur-
rounded by two propyl groups (with three carbons each) is called dipropyl ether.
Carboxylic acids: R-COOH brings up the rear
Carboxylic acids appear to be ordinary hydrocarbons until you reach the very last carbon in
their chain, whose three ordinary hydrogens have been usurped by a double-bonded oxygen
and a hydroxyl group (an OH group). This gives a carboxylic acid the general form R-COOH.
These compounds are named by attaching the suffix -oic acid to the end of the prefix. For exam-
ple, the compound shown in Figure 25-7 has four carbons, the last in the chain attached to a
double-bonded oxygen and a hydroxyl group. The compound is therefore called butanoic acid.
The hydrogen of the COOH group can pop off as H+ leaving an R-COO- ion, which is why these
compounds are called acids. Carboxylic acids are a favorite compound type for AP exam writ-
ers because they are both organics and acids. It is important to note, however, that all car-
boxylic acids are weak acids, so learn to spot them among acid lists and keep their relative
weakness in mind.

Esters: Creating two carbon chains
What if the same double-bonded oxygen/hydroxyl pair from a carboxylic acid has infiltrated
deeper into the hydrocarbon chain and is not on an end, but rather in the middle? In order
to accomplish this, the COOH group must lose the hydrogen of its hydroxyl group (which, as
an acidic hydrogen, is no problem) to open up a bond to which a second hydrocarbon can
attach. A compound of this nature, with the general formula R-COOR, is called an ester. Lots
of nice, smelly coumpounds are esters, including the compounds that give pears, apples, and
bananas their pleasant aromas. 
Because the carbon chain in an ester is also broken by an oxygen, you’ll need to choose one
carbon chain as a lowly substituent group and the other to bear the proud suffix of -oate. This
high-priority group is always the carbon chain that includes the carbon double-bonded to one
oxygen and single bonded to the other. The group on the other side of the single-bonded
oxygen is named as an ordinary substituent. For example, the compound shown in Figure 25-8
is phenyl ethanoate, because the high priority group has two carbons and the low priority
group is a benzene ring.
That’s right! The low-priority group on the other side of the oxygen doesn’t have to be a hydro-
carbon chain! It can be a ring or a metal as well. In Figure 25-8, this group is a benzene ring. 
Aldehydes: Holding tight to one oxygen
Aldehydes are much like carboxylic acids except that they lack the second oxygen in the
COOH group. Their final carbon shares a single bond with its neighboring carbon, a double
bond with an oxygen, and a single bond with hydrogen. Aldehydes are named with the suffix 
-al (not to be confused with the -ol of alcohols) and have the general formula R-CHO. For
example, the compound in Figure 25-9 is pentanal, a five-carbon chain with a double-bonded
oxygen taking the place of two of the hydrogen bonds on the final carbon.

Ketones: Lone oxygen sneaks up the chain
Much like esters are to carboxylic acids, ketones share the same basic structure as aldehy-
des, except that their double-bonded oxygen can be found hiding out in the midst of the
carbon chain, giving them the general form R-COR. Ketones are named by adding the suffix 
-one to the prefix generated by counting up the longest carbon chain. Unlike esters, however,
the carbon chain of a ketone is not broken by the double-bonded oxygen group, making
naming them much simpler. The compound shown in Figure 25-10, for example, is called
simply 2-butanone; the number before the name specifies the number of the carbon to which
the oxygen is attached.
Halocarbons: Hello, halogen!
Halocarbons are simply hydrocarbons with a halogen or more tacked on to a carbon in place
of a hydrogen atom. (A halogen is a group VIIA element.) Halogens in a halocarbon are always
named as substituent groups — fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo, one for each of the four halo-
gens that form halocarbons (F, Cl, Br or I). The shorthand for a halocarbon is R-X, where X is
the halogen. The compound shown in Figure 25-11 has two bromo groups attached, one to
the second carbon and one to the third in a five-carbon alkane. Its official name is, therefore,
2,3-dibromopentane.

Amines: Hobnobbing with nitrogen
Amines are as conspicuous as Waldo on the very first page of a Where’s Waldo book. No trick-
sters wearing red-striped shirts are waiting to fool you among these organic molecules.
Amines and their derivatives are the only compounds that you’ll encounter in basic organic
chemistry that contain nitrogen atoms. Amines have the basic form R-NH2, and they’re
named by naming the carbon chain as a substituent (with the ending -yl), and then adding
the suffix -amine. The structure in Figure 25-12, for example, is called ethylamine because it’s
a two-carbon ethyl chain with an amine group.
Rearranging Carbons: Isomerism
How about this: Two organic molecules have identical chemical formulas. Each atom in one
molecule is bonded to the same groups as in the other. They’re identical molecules, right?
Wrong! (Mischievous chemistry gods point and snicker.) Many organic molecules are iso-
mers, compounds with the same formula and types of bonds, but with different structural or
spatial arrangements. Who cares about such subtle differences? Well, you might. Consider
thalidomide, a small organic molecule widely prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s
and early 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness. Thalidomide exists in two isomeric
forms that rapidly switch from one to the other in the body. One isomer is very effective at
combating morning sickness. The other isomer causes serious birth defects. Isomers matter.
Isomers can be confusing. They fall into different categories and subcategories. So, before
committing your brain to a game of isomeric Twister, peruse the following breakdown: Keep
in mind, however that all isomers, no matter what their specific classification, have both the
same number and type of atoms.
 Structural isomers have identical molecular formulas but differ in the arrangement of
bonds.
 Stereoisomers have identical connectivities — all atoms are bonded to the same types
of other atoms — but differ in the arrangement of atoms in space.
• Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not non-superimposable mirror images
of each other. Two types of diastereomers exist: Geometric isomers (or cis-trans
isomers) are diastereomers that differ in the arrangement of groups around a
double bond, or the plane of a ring. Conformers and rotamers are diastereomers
that differ because of rotations about individual bonds (we don’t cover them in
this book because they are beyond the scope of general chemistry).
• Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of
each other.
You already know how to recognize and name stereoisomers appropriately by carefully
studying the structure of the main chain and branching substituents. This section focuses on
the trickier category: stereoisomers.

Part V: Describing Patterns and Predicting Properties 

Picking sides with geometric isomers
Geometric isomers or cis-trans isomers are a good place to start in the world of stereoisomers
because they’re the easiest of the stereoisomers to understand. In the following sections, we
explain how isomers relate to alkenes, alkanes that aren’t straight-chain, and alkynes.
Straight-chain alkanes are immune from geometric isomerism because their carbon-carbon
single bonds can rotate freely. Unsaturate (or add another bond to) one of those bonds,
however, and you’ve got a different story. Alkenes have double bonds that resist rotation.
Furthermore, the sp2 hybridization of double-bonded carbons gives them trigonal planar
bonding geometry (see Chapter 7 for an introduction to hybridization). The result is that
groups attached to these carbons are locked on one side or the other of the double bond.
Convince yourself of this by examining Figure 25-13.
In the left-hand structure of Figure 25-13, the carbon chain continues along the same side of
the carbon-carbon double bond. Both methyl (-CH3) groups lie on the same side of the unsat-
uration. This is called cis configuration. In the right-hand structure, the carbon chain swaps
sides as it proceeds across the double bond. The methyl groups lie on opposite sides of the
unsaturation. This is called a trans configuration.
Naming cis-trans isomers is simple. Attach the appropriate cis- or trans- prefix before the
number referring to the carbon of the double bond. For example, the left-hand structure in
Figure 22-1 is cis-2-butene, while the structure on the right is trans-2-butene.
Although straight-chain alkanes happily avoid isomerism by rotating merrily about their
single bonds, the four bonds of sp3-hybridized carbons assume tetrahedral geometry. Detailed
representations like the one shown for methane in Figure 25-14 reveal this geometry. In the
structure of methane, the bonds depicted as straight lines run in the plane of the page. The
bond drawn as a filled wedge projects outward from the page. The bond drawn as a dashed
wedge projects behind the page. These filled and dashed wedge symbols are known as stereo
bonds because they are helpful in identifying stereoisomers.
When alkanes close into rings, they can no longer freely rotate about their single bonds, and
the tetrahedral geometry of sp3-hybridized carbons creates cis-trans isomers. Groups bonded
to ring carbons are locked above or below the plane of the ring, as shown in Figure 25-15.

The figure depicts two different versions of trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. In both versions,
the adjacent methyl substituents are locked in trans positions, on opposite sides of the ring.
 The upper set of structures shows the plane of the ring as seen from above, and high-
lights the trans- configuration of the methyl groups with stereo bonds.
 The lower set of structures shows the same rings rotated 90 degrees downward and
toward you.
The trans configuration of the methyl groups is most clear in the lower structures. The 
front-most methyl group is highlighted with explicit hydrogen atoms to emphasize its posi-
tion above or below the plane of the ring.
Alkynes also contain carbon-carbon bonds that cannot rotate freely. However, the sp
hybridization of the carbons in these bonds leads to linear bonding geometry. The two-
carbon alkyne, ethyne, is shown in Figure 25-16. Each carbon locks three of its valence elec-
trons into the axis of the triple bond. Each has only one valence electron remaining with
which to bond to hydrogen. No cis-trans isomerism is possible in this scenario.

Changing Names: Some Common
Organic Reactions
The carbon-based organic molecules presented in this chapter can morph into one another
through chemical reactions. Such reactions are rather common, and the two most common
types are substitution and addition reactions.
Alcohols are particularly prone to a chemical process called substitution in which their OH
group is replaced by a different atom. For example, the OH group on 2-pentanol can be re-
placed by the halogen fluorine, turning the alcohol into a halocarbon called 2-fluoro-pentane
(see Figure 25-17).
The double bonds of alkenes also make them particularly likely to react with other com-
pounds through a process called addition. If the double bond between two carbon molecules
is broken, it allows each of those two carbon atoms to form a bond with another atom or
molecule. The reaction shown in Figure 25-18, for example, shows water being added across
the double bond of 1-hexene. The water molecule itself is split into two pieces — simple
hydrogen and a hydroxide — and each of them is added to one of the two carbons that used
to share a double bond, forming either 1-hexanol or 2-hexanol.

C
hapter 25 is chock-full of juicy little organic chemistry tidbits. Make sure that you have
everything filed away in your brain properly by reviewing the concepts in this chapter
and attempting the practice problems we include near the end of the chapter. Remember,
although there are relatively few questions that directly test organic chemistry on the
AP exam, a familiarity with the names and structures of organic compounds can help you
to answer many other types of questions.
Making the Main Points Stick
To master the organic chemistry portion of the AP curriculum you need to memorize, memo-
rize, memorize! Specifically, you must remember how to identify the 13 types of organic com-
pounds, and 3 types of isomer listed in the sections below.
Important organic compounds
Listed below are the 13 types of organic compound most likely to appear on the AP exam,
together with their naming rules. Make sure that you have a thorough understanding of what
makes each unique before you move on. 
 Alkanes are hydrocarbons containing only single bonds, alkenes contain double bonds
and alkynes contain triple bonds. 
 Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes are named by first numbering the longest carbon chain.
Numbering starts at the end closest to the nearest multiple bond for alkenes and
alkynes, while alkanes are numbered starting at the end that gives its branches the
lowest numbers.
 Substituents on all organic compounds are named with the suffix yl and are preceded
by the number of the main chain carbon atom from which they branch.

 Cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons contain rings of carbon atoms and can contain multiple
bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons also contain rings of carbon atoms, but the bonds
between carbons alternate between double or triple bonds and single bonds. 
 Alcohols are hydrocarbon chains that include a hydroxide (OH) group. They are
named with the ending -ol.
 Ethers contain an oxygen atom in the midst of their carbon chain. They are named by
naming the substituents on either side of the oxygen and then adding the ending ether,
as in ethyl methyl ether.
 The final carbon atom in a carboxylic acid is double bonded to an oxygen atom as well
as being single bonded to a hydroxide group. In condensed structural formulas, this
configuration is written as R-COOH. Carboxylic acids are named by attaching the suffix
-oic acid.
 Esters are related to carboxylic acids in that they too have a carbon atom that is
double bonded to one oxygen. This time, however, rather than also being bonded to a
hydroxide group, the final carbon is bonded to a lone oxygen atom. This oxygen is
itself bonded to another hydrocarbon chain, giving esters the condensed formula 
R-COOR. You name an ester by first naming the lower-priority hydrocarbon chain
(the one not containing a carbon double bonded to oxygen) as a substituent and then
attaching the suffix -oate to the high-priority chain.
 Aldehydes are also similar to carboxylic acids in that their final carbon atom is double
bonded to an oxygen atom, however in this case the fourth available carbon bond is
taken up by a simple hydrogen atom rather than a hydroxide group, giving it the for-
mula R-CHO. Aldehydes are named by attaching the suffix -al.
 Ketones have the same structure as aldehydes, except that the double-bonded oxygen
has infiltrated its way up to a midchain carbon. These compounds have the condensed
formula ROR and are named with the suffix -one. Unlike esters, ketones contain uninter-
rupted carbon chains, so you need not worry about prefixes.
 Halocarbons are hydrocarbon chains with a halogen substituent. The hydrocarbon
portion is named normally, with the prefix fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo attached,
depending on which halogen it contains.
 Amines are hydrocarbon chains that contain an NH2 group and have the basic form R-
NH2. They are named by naming the carbon chain as a substituent then adding the
ending amine.
Isomers
You will also be expected to be able to identify the following three types of isomer on the AP
exam. Keep in mind that all isomers contain the same number and type of atoms, but their
connectivities may be different.
 Structural isomers contain the same number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
etc., but in different configurations.
 Stereoisomers must have the same connectivities (in other words, all of their bonds
need to be in the same order), and are divided into two categories — compounds that
are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another (enantiomers) and compounds
that are superimposable mirror images of one another (diasteriomers).
 Geometric, or cis-trans, isomers are stereoisomers that differ in the location of sub-
stituent groups about a double bond. When the two groups are on the same side of the
double bond, you are dealing with the cis isomer, while groups on opposite side of the
double bond indicate a trans isomer.

Testing Your Knowledge
Apply your knowledge of the concepts outlined in Chapter 25 with these practice questions.
Make sure that you are confident in your ability to distinguish between all of the different
types of organic compounds and isomers before you attempt them, though! Remember that
organic chemistry in particular involves a lot of memorization.
Questions 1 through 4 refer to the following types of organic compounds
(A) Alcohols
(B) Esters
(C) Ethers
(D) Aldehydes
(E) Halocarbons
1. These organic compounds do not contain any oxygen atoms.
2. You may need to use the prefix di in naming one of these organic compounds. 
3. These organic compounds are known for having pleasant aromas.
4. These organic compounds are most closely related to ketones.
5. Of the following organic compounds, which is MOST soluble in water at 298K?
(A) Hexane
(B) Hexene
(C) Ethyl Methyl Ether
(D) Octanol
(E) Methanol
6. (a) Write out the condensed structural formula of 2-pentanone.
(b) Draw the complete structural formula of 2-pentanone, showing all atoms and bonds
explicitly.
(c) Draw a complete structural formula for an isomer of pentanone.
Answers with Explanations
1. (E). The halocarbon is the only one of these organic compounds that doesn’t contain an
oxygen atom. 
2. (C). Ethers are named by naming the substituents on either side of the oxygen atom. If the
groups on either side are the same, then the prefix di- is used as in CH3OCH3 (dimethyl
ether).
3. (B). Esters are known for their pleasant aromas.
4. (D). Aldehydes and ketones both share a double C-O bond. In an aldehyde, the carbon
double bonded to the oxygen is also bonded to a hydrogen atom, ending the carbon chain.
In a ketone, the carbon chain continues beyond the double bond with oxygen.
269
Chapter 26: Answering Questions on Organic Chemistry

5. (E). Following the “like dissolves like” rule (review solubility in Chapter 10 for more details),
alcohols should be the most soluble in water among the compounds on this list because
they have the same intermolecular forces as water. Octanol’s long nonpolar hydrocarbon
chain, however, balances out the polar end of the molecule to some extent, making methanol
the more soluble alcohol.
6. (a) CH3CH2CH2COCH3. 2-Pentanone is a five-carbon ketone, with the double-bonded oxygen
on the second carbon. This means it has a condensed structural formula of
CH3CH2CH2COCH3.
(b) Translate the condensed structural formula into a complete structural drawing, 
giving you
(c) Any five-carbon ketone or aldehyde would be an acceptable isomer, as long as it still has
the formula C5H10O. 3-pentanone and pentanal are two possibilities, both shown below.

tudying chemistry without spending time in a lab is a
bit like reading up on the history of skydiving from the
confines of an armchair in your basement. Something is
missing from the experience. For this reason, AP chemistry
courses include extensive labwork as part of the standard
curriculum. Although the specific experiments may vary
from one high school course to another, they all conform
to the same set of guidelines and principles, and most of
them are drawn from an official set of recommended exper-
iments put forth by the AP chemistry Powers That Be. In

hemistry is a laboratory science. Although there are such things as purely “theoretical”
chemists who do all their reactions on computers, other chemists tend to make fun of
these types behind their backs. Most chemistry still involves things like beakers, tubes, and
interesting odors (beyond those possibly emanating from the chemists themselves). This
state of affairs is not lost on the creators of the AP exam, who expect you to know your
basic laboratory equipment and techniques. As you’ll know if you’re taking an AP chemistry

Following Protocol
What makes an effective laboratory “hunchback” is an intimate knowledge of two things.
First, the hunchback knows the right tool for the job. Second, the hunchback knows how to
use that tool. If you don’t know the first thing, you may find yourself attempting to measure
the pH of a solution by placing it dropwise onto the tip of your tongue (don’t ever do this). If
you know the first thing but not the second thing, you may find yourself staring in admiration
at a stack of litmus paper that you have no idea how to use. To prevent both these kinds of
embarrassing episodes, and to shore up your lab knowledge for the AP exam, make sure you
thoroughly review this section.
Measuring mass, volume, and density
Mass and volume are by far the most frequently measured quanities in your basic chemistry
lab. From mass and volume, you can calculate density. Alternately, you can use density to
calculate mass or volume. 
 Mass: You measure mass in the laboratory using a balance. Most laboratory balances
are extremely accurate, capable of measuring masses with a precision of hundredths
of grams. 
 Volume: Techniques for measuring volume vary depending on what type of substance
you are measuring, with liquids being the easiest to measure. Graduated cylinders are
generally used to make approximate volume measurements for liquids. Pipettes and
burets are used to measure precise volumes of liquids. Obtaining the volume of a solid
can be somewhat tricky and, in some cases, impossible to do without altering the sub-
stance. If the substance does not react with water, you can submerge it in water and
measure the volume of water displaced by it. Luckily, in most experiments it is mass
of solid used that matters and not volume. You cannot measure the volume of a gas
because gases have no definite volume. Recall that it is a fundamental property of
gases that they expand to fill the entire volume available to them. However, the amount
of gas can be obtained by measuring its pressure when held in a known volume.
 Density: Mass and volume measurements can also be used to determine the density of
a substance using the formula density=mass÷volume. Density is a characteristic physi-
cal property for solids and liquids and can often be looked up in a table.
Determining melting point 
Melting is the phase transition between the solid and liquid states and is equivalent to the
freezing point. Because melting point is a characteristic physical property of a solid, you can
use melting point to help to determine the identity of an unknown solid or to verify that an
experiment has been successful and you have isolated the desired product. 
You can use several different types of apparatus for measuring melting points, but they all
have the same general setup. A sample of the solid in question is placed in a thin glass tube
and heated slowly from the bottom. The experimenter watches the solid through a magnify-
ing glass until it reaches the melting point and records it. Pure crystalline solids have very
distinct melting points and the phase transition between solid and liquid occurs in a few sec-
onds, giving a very accurate melting point determination. Impurities lower the melting point
of a pure solid, by an amount depending on their concentration. So it is vital to have a pure
276
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

sample if you are using melting point to confirm an identity. Amorphous solids such as glass
and plastic do not have precise melting points and so chemists make special types of melting
measurements for them.
Determining boiling point and doing distillation
The boiling point of a substance is slightly more difficult to measure than the melting point.
This is because it is the phase transition between a liquid and a gas and gases are difficult to
see so you need a way of verifying that your liquid is at its boiling point and not merely very,
very hot. One convenient phenomenon to help you in measuring a boiling point is the ten-
dency for a liquid to maintain a constant temperature during a phase transition. All of the
energy being added to the solution goes into changing its phase rather than into heating it. 
Distillation is a process that can aid you not only in determining a precise boiling point for a
liquid but also in purifying that liquid. Say you have a mixture of two different liquids in a
flask, one with a lower boiling point than the other. If you could somehow trap the gas being
released as the first liquid boils you would have isolated the pure first substance. This is the
basic purpose of a distillation apparatus such as the one shown in Figure 27-2. 
The flask on the left is being heated, while the one on the right is cool. Connecting the two is
a piece of lab equipment called a condenser. The inner tube in a condenser connects the first
flask to the second, while cold water is run through the outer tube (this water is kept iso-
lated and does not come into direct contact with the chemicals in the experiment). This
causes the gas that is escaping from the boiling liquid in the first flask to condense in the
inner tube of the condenser, which is angled downward so that it will collect in the second
flask. 
As the experimenter, you watch a thermometer connected to the first flask. When the first
liquid begins to boil and condense in the condenser, the temperature of the liquid will remain
constant until all of the lower boiling point liquid has escaped. Once it has all escaped, the
condenser will collect no more liquid and the temperature in the first flask will again begin to
rise. You then turn off the heat and disconnect your apparatus, having isolated a pure sub-
stance in your second flask. If your mixture contains more than two liquids or you wish to
isolate a liquid with a higher boiling point, you can continue this process, switching out the
second flask and isolating one substance at a time.

Dealing with solids in precipitation and filtration
In chemistry, you will often create solid precipitates in aqueous solutions. You separate the
solution from the precipitate using a process called filtration, which involves pouring your
solution/precipitate mixture through a funnel lined with filter paper. The filter paper allows
the solution to pass through, but catches the precipitate. The precipitate should be washed
to remove impurities. 
Positive spin: Centrifugation
Centrifugation is another nifty way of separating compounds, this time according to their den-
sity. Centrifuges are quite expensive and most high school chemistry labs are not equipped
with them, but you will often find reference to centrifugation in your chemistry text or on the
AP exam. A centrifuge is essentially a big, extremely fast-spinning trough. A mixture in the cen-
trifuge will separate according to density as the denser components migrate away from the
center of the apparatus and the less dense migrate toward it.
Thinning out with dilutions
Rather than storing lots of different concentrations of the same type of solution, most chem-
istry labs will store concentrated stock solutions of each chemical. However, you don’t
always want to be dealing with extremely concentrated solutions, particularly when they are
strong acids and bases that have a propensity to react with skin and are generally unpleas-
ant. Often, a dilution is required before an experiment is begun. In a dilution, a concentrated
stock solution is diluted by adding water to a desired molarity. Dilutions utilize the equation
Mi ×Vi = Mf × Vf, where Mi and Mf are the initial and final molarities and Vi and Vf are the initial
and final volumes. The amount of water added in these cases is equal to Vf–Vi.
Drying off
Because so many compounds react with water, it is often desirable to eliminate water from
certain substances. Since so many substances are soluble in water, it is often very difficult
to get rid of. In many cases, you can simply heat the substance you wish to rid of water to
higher than 100 degrees C and wait for the water to evaporate. However, high temperatures
can also cause decomposition of the substance you wish to isolate so sometimes another
method is needed. 
This alternative method takes advantage of substances called desiccants that draw in water.
If you leave your sample in a sealed container also containing a desiccant, over time the
desiccant will absorb all of the water from your sample. Desiccants are slow acting, and your
sample will generally have to be left in the container overnight to complete the drying
process. Desiccants are capable of absorbing only a certain amount of water, so it is impor-
tant that your sample have as much water as possible removed from it before being sealed
with the desiccant. Silica gel-based desiccants are common in chemistry labs because they
can be easily regenerated by heating. Most commercially available dessicants are prepared
with additives so that they change color as they become more hydrated.

Making pH measurements
When doing acid/base reactions in the laboratory, you will often wish to know the pH of the
solution you are dealing with. There are several ways to measure pH. Often, a material known
as litmus paper is used. Litmus paper changes color as it reacts with solutions of different
pH. Proper technique is to place a drop of solution onto the paper with a stir rod. When the
color of the paper develops, you match its color to the pH scale that comes with the box of
litmus paper. Many labs now use “pH paper” or “pH strips,” that change to different colors
over a range of pH values. 
Many chemists prefer to use a pH indicator such as phenolphthalein instead of litmus paper,
however, probably because it makes the solution itself turn pink when a pH above 9 is reached.
Universal indicators can provide a range of color changes against a scale. pH meters have now
become quite cheap and small, so a probe dipped in a solution can give you a direct digital
readout of the pH in the solution.
Using spectroscopy/spectrometry 
to measure concentration
Spectroscopy is a technique for separating light into its component colors. Spectrometry
means making measurements of the separated light. Sophisticated chemistry labs use spec-
trophotometers to create a graph showing the absorption and/or emission at each wave-
length of the visible spectrum. However, as is the case with centrifuges, not all high school
chemistry labs are equipped with spectrophotometers. If you are asked about spectroscopy
on the AP chemistry exam, you will be required to know that it relies on the separation of
light into its component colors. Recall from Chapter 3 that the colors absorbed or emitted
by a pure element are unique to that element and are related to its atomic structure.
In addition, you will be expected to know that a spectrometer can be used to measure the
concentration of a colored substance by using Beer’s Law, and measuring the amount of light
transmitted by the solution. The solution is poured into a clean cell and placed in the spec-
trometer. By comparing this to a cell containing a standard amount of the substance, the
spectrometer can determine an unknown concentration by a simple ratio. It is important
that no other light scattering (such as by a fingerprint on the cell) happens, as it will affect
the result.

AP Experiments
In This Chapter
 Surveying the range of College Board-recommended AP chemistry experiments 
 Highlighting key concepts and calculations from the labs
G
oggles are the geeky, timeless emblems of a chemistry lab. But before you laugh off
this chapter, remember that the laboratory is where chemistry really takes place.
That’s why the College Board has put forth an extensive list of recommended AP chemistry
labs, many of them interrelated. Any actual AP chemistry course will not include the full
range of these labs — but you’ll probably have done a significant fraction of them. To
expose yourself to the pith of any labs your class skipped, and to shore up your under-
standing of those you did perform, review the following summary of the recommended labs,
22 things you might have done behind goggles. Examples offered for individual experiments
may or may not exactly describe what you have done in your own lab classes but reflect the
essential principles of the labs, and data like those you might encounter in lab are included
in the examples. As you go through the steps of an experiment, keep alert to possible
sources of error. Each measurement you make (massing a sample, measuring a temperature,
etc.) carries some error with it. That error propagates through every subsequent calcula-
tion that you make using those measurements, and results in error (uncertainty) in any final
experimental values.
Determination of the Formula of a Compound
By combusting a metal sample of known mass, you form a metal oxide with an unknown for-
mula. Taking the mass of the oxide allows you to calculate the ratio of oxygen to metal within
the oxide, and thereby determine the formula.
Example:
3.65g Mg is combusted within a 16.26g crucible. After combustion completes, the mass
of the sample-containing crucible is 22.38g. What is the formula of the oxide?
Follow these steps to find the formula of this metal oxide:
1. Mass of crucible + combusted sample = 22.38g
2. Mass of combusted sample = 22.38g – 16.26g = 6.12g

3. Increase in mass of sample upon combustion = 6.12g – 3.65g = 2.47g
Because combustion is essentially a combination reaction with oxygen, any added mass
derives from oxygen. The final sample therefore contains the original amount of Mg:
4. Moles Mg = 3.65g Mg × (1mol Mg / 24.3g Mg) = 0.150mol Mg
5. Moles O added = 2.47g O × (1mol O / 16.0g ) = 0.154mol O
6. Moles Mg : moles O ≈1:1
The formula of the oxide is MgO. 
Determination of the Percentage 
of Water in a Hydrate
By heating a hydrated ionic compound of known mass, you drive off hydrating water mole-
cules. Often, this process can be followed visually by observing the colored hydrate com-
pound lose its color. Taking the mass of the dehydrated compound allows you to calculate
the percent of water in the original hydrated compound.
Example:
5.91g of hydrated copper (II) sulfate, CuSO4·nH2O, is heated within a 15.73g crucible until
its original blue color changes entirely to white. The sample should be cooled and
massed, and then heated and cooled again until the mass remains constant indicating all
the water has been removed. The mass of the sample-containing crucible after dehydra-
tion is 19.48g. What is the apparent percentage of water in the hydrated compound? 
Here are the steps to determine the apparent percent water in the original compound:
1. Mass of sample + crucible = 5.91g + 15.73g = 21.64g
2. Mass of dehydrated sample + crucible = 19.48g
3. Mass of dehydrated water = 21.64 – 19.48g = 2.16g
4. Moles of dehydrated water = 2.16g H2O × (1mol H2O / 18.02 g H2O) = 0.120mol H2O
Because the mass that remains in the crucible after dehydration is CuSO4 (not the
hydrate), you can calculate the original moles of hydrated compound:
5. Moles CuSO4 · nH2O = moles CuSO4
6. Mass remaining in crucible = 19.48g – 15.73g = 3.75g
7. Moles CuSO4 = 3.75 g CuSO4 × (1mol CuSO4 / 159.6g CuSO4) = 0.0235mol CuSO4
8. Moles dehydrated water : mole CuSO4 = 0.1120 : 0.0235 = 5.1: 1 ≈5:1
So, given a plausible amount of experimental error, the original hydrate appeared to
have the formula CuSO4 · 5H2O.
To calculate the mass percent of water in the original compound, you simply divide the
mass of the hydrating waters (5.1 × 18.02g) by the mass of the whole hydrated com-
pound and multiply by 100%:
(91.9g / 249.7g) × 100% = 36.8%
282
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

Determination of the Molar Mass 
by Vapor Density
By evaporating a volatile liquid such that it fills a flask of known volume, and then measuring
the mass of recondensed liquid, you determine the vapor density (mass of compound /
volume of flask) of the compound. Then, you use the ideal gas law to determine the molar
mass of the compound.
Example:
4.00g of an unknown volatile liquid is loaded into a flask of 312mL interior volume. The
flask is capped with a single-hole stopper to allow controlled escape of evaporating
material. The stoppered flask is immersed in a 373K water bath, causing the volatile
liquid to begin to evaporate. Once the last visible trace of liquid evaporates, the flask is
plunged into an ice bath, recondensing any volatile liquid that remains as vapor within
the flask. By comparing the mass of the flask before and after the heating/cooling proce-
dure, you calculate that 0.854g of recondensed liquid remains. What is the apparent
molar mass of the volatile liquid?
Follow these steps to find the apparent molar mass:
1. The experiment takes place in atmospheric conditions, so the pressure ≈1.0atm.
2. At the moment the flask was immersed in an ice bath to recondense the volatile liquid,
the moles of the sample filled the 312mL volume (0.312L). You know that the tempera-
ture of the original water bath was 373K and the pressure ≈1.0atm. Using the ideal gas
law, you can calculate the moles of gas in the flask under those conditions:
PV = nRT
n = (PV) / (RT) = (1.0atm × 0.312L) / (0.0821 Latm mol–1 K–1 × 373K) = 0.010mol
3. Because the recondensed liquid had mass 0.854g, we calculate the apparent molar
mass as follows:
Molar mass ≈0.854g / 0.010mol = 85 g mol–1
Determination of the Molar Mass 
by Freezing Point Depression
You dissolve a known mass of an unknown, nonelectrolyte solute into a known mass of sol-
vent. Then you measure the freezing point of the resulting solution and compare it to the
freezing point of the pure solvent. By calculating the change in the freezing point, you deter-
mine the molar mass of the unknown solute based on the colligative property of freezing
point depression.
Constraining the unknown solute as an nonelectrolyte ensures that each mole of dissolved
compound contributes one mole of dissolved particles, as opposed to the more complicated
cases of acids, bases, and salts. 
Example:
You dissolve 1.32g of an unknown, nonelectrolyte compound into 50.0g of benzene sol-
vent. You measure the freezing point of the solution to be 2.6°C. What is the apparent
molar mass of the solute?
283
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

Here are the steps to determine the apparent molar mass of this solute:
1. Freezing point depression depends on the molality (m) of the solution and on the sol-
vent according to the freezing point depression equation, ∆Tf = Kf × m. 
The parameter Kf is the freezing point depression constant and varies from solvent to
solvent. For benzene, Kf = 5.12 °C m–1. 
The parameter ∆Tf is the change in freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent,
not the freezing point temperature itself. The normal freezing point of pure benzene is
5.5 °C. 
Substituting in known values, you get
(5.5 °C – 2.6 °C) = (5.12 °C m–1) × m
2. Solving for m gives you 0.57 molality, or 0.57 moles solute per kg solvent. Because you
dissolved the unknown solute into 50g = 0.050kg solvent, you can calculate the appar-
ent moles of solute:
0.57mol kg–1 = n / 0.050 kg
3. Solving gives you 0.029 moles. Those moles had a mass of 1.32g, so the apparent molar
mass is 1.32g / 0.029mol = 46 gmol–1. 
Determination of the Molar Volume of a Gas
You react a known mass of a known metal with acid within a flask such that the reaction
evolves hydrogen gas H2. The volume of gas is measured by its ability to displace water
within a connected eudiometer, a graduated column partially filled with water. By measuring
the volume of gas evolved, you can use the ideal gas law to calculate the apparent molar
volume of hydrogen gas. In so doing, you must account for the contribution of water vapor
within the eudiometer to the total pressure.
Example:
You react 0.027g Mg with concentrated HCl within a stoppered flask that is connected by
a tube to a eudiometer. As the reaction proceeds, hydrogen gas bubbles from the mix-
ture into the eudiometer. By observing the water displacement, you estimate that the
reaction evolved 26.15mL of H2. The temperature of the lab is 22°C, a temperature at
which the vapor pressure of water is 0.030atm. What is the apparent molar volume of
the hydrogen gas? How do the moles of H2 estimated by this method compare to the
number of moles expected from the reaction?
To compare the experimentally estimated number of moles to the expected number, follow
these steps: 
1. Set yourself on solid ground by writing a balanced equation for the reaction:
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) →Mg2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) + H2(g)
2. Given the stoichiometry of the balanced reaction equation, you can calculate a theoret-
ical yield of H2 gas from the starting mass of Mg:
0.027g Mg × (1mol Mg / 24.3g Mg) × (1mol H2 / 1 mol Mg) = 1.1 × 10–3 mol H2
Potentially, 1.1 × 10–3 mol H2 gas could coexist with water vapor within the eudiometer
tube. 
284
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

3. You can estimate the moles of water in the displaced volume within the tube (26.15mL =
0.02615L) by using the ideal gas law and the given vapor pressure for water at 22 °C,
0.030atm:
PV = nRT
n = (PV) / (RT) = (0.030atm × 0.02615L) / (0.0821 Latm mol–1 K–1 × 295K)
n = 3.2 × 10–5 mol H2O
4. Raoult’s law states that the partial pressure of a substance in the vapor pressure over a
sample is proportional to the mole fraction of that substance within the sample. So,
you can estimate the fractional pressure exerted by water vapor trapped in the
eudiometer tube:
Fractional pressure ≈(3.2 × 10–5 mol H2O) / (3.2 × 10–5 mol H2O + 1.1 × 10–3 mol H2)
Fractional pressure ≈0.028
5. So, the pressure that caused the displacement within the eudiometer derived not only
from hydrogen gas but also from about 3 mole percent water vapor. Using this informa-
tion, you can recalculate the moles of hydrogen within the eudiometer, including a cor-
rection for the partial pressure contributed by water vapor:
n = [(1.0atm – 0.028atm) × (0.02615L) / (0.0821 Latm mol–1 K–1 × 295K)
n = 1.0 × 10–3 mol H2
6. The volume occupied by this amount of hydrogen ≈0.02615L × (1 – 0.028) ≈0.025L
7. So, the apparent molar volume of the hydrogen ≈0.025L / 1.0 × 10–3 mol = 25 L mol–1
8. Finally, the percent error between the actual moles H2 produced versus those esti-
mated from the balanced equation calculates as:
[(1.1 × 10–3mol – 1.0 × 10–3mol) / 1.1 × 10–3mol] × 100% = 9%
Standardization of a Solution 
Using a Primary Standard
To reliably prepare working solutions from stock solutions, it helps to be able to measure
the concentration of stock solutions by reacting them with “primary standards” of very cer-
tain concentration. This process is called standardization. To standardize solutions in this
way, you must know the balanced reaction equation for the reaction undergone between the
primary standard and sample solutions, and you must have some means to assess the extent
of the reaction, such as a color change. 
Analysis of the data from a standardization titration is essentially identical to the analysis
used for acid-base titrations. Both experiments employ titration. Both require you to make
use of a balanced reaction equation. Both often use a color change to indicate the endpoint
of a titration. A common standard substance is potassium acid phthallate (or KHP for short),
which can be prepared very pure, is solid at room temperature, and so easily weighed to
obtain an exact mass for reaction. For an example of the types of calculations used in a stan-
dardization experiment, see “Determination of the Equilibrium Constant for a Chemical
Reaction,” later in this chapter. 
285
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

Determination of Concentration by Acid-Base
Titration, Including a Weak Acid or Base
To reliably determine the concentration of acid or base solutions, you can use the solution of
unknown concentration in a neutralization reaction against an acid or base of highly certain
concentration. To use this method, you must know the balanced reaction equation of the
neutralization reaction and you must have a means to assess the extent of the reaction, such
as the change in color of an indicator. If you know the number of acid or base equivalents
contributed by your sample compound (HCl contributes one acid equivalent, H2SO4 con-
tributes two acid equivalents, for example), you can determine the molar concentration of
the compound. If you do not know the number of equivalents per mole of your compounds,
you can still determine the normality, N, of your sample solution. (You may or may not have
worked with “normality” in your AP class, but the AP exam does not include it.) 
Example:
You wish to determine the concentration of a solution of ascorbic acid, C6H8O6, a weak
acid. You know that ascorbic acid is monoprotic, contributing one mole of acid equiva-
lent per mole of compound. To determine the concentration of your solution, you titrate
50.0mL of ascorbic acid solution with a 0.10M NaOH standard solution. To follow the
progress of the neutralization reaction, you use a colorimetric indicator, phenolph-
thalein. The phenolphthalein changes from colorless to pink when you have added
19.6mL of standard to the ascorbic acid sample solution. What is the apparent concen-
tration of the sample solution? 
To determine the apparent concentration of the original ascorbic acid solution, follow these
steps:
1. To begin the analysis, you must know the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction,
as expressed in a balanced reaction equation:
C6H8O6(aq) + NaOH(aq) →C6H7O6Na(aq) + H2O(l)
Expressed as a net ionic equation, 
C6H8O6(aq) + OH–(aq) →C6H7O6
– (aq) + H2O(l)
In other words, the soichiometry of the interaction between NaOH and ascorbic acid
is 1:1.
2. Phenolphthalein, the colorimetric indicator added to the titration solution, changed
from colorless to pink at the equivalence point, indicating that the moles of acid in
solution equal the moles of base. The color changed at 19.6mL (0.0196L) added 0.10M
NaOH.
3. The moles of base added at the equivalence point is simply the concentration of the
standard NaOH solution multiplied by the volume added:
Moles base = 0.10 mol L–1 × 0.0196L = 2.0 × 10–3 mol
4. Because moles base = moles acid at the equivalence point, the original 50.0mL
(0.0500L) ascorbic acid solution apparently contained 2.0 × 10–3 mol ascorbic acid.
So, the molar concentration of the ascorbic acid solution is
Molarity = (2.0 × 10–3 mol) / (0.0500L) = 4.0 × 10–2 M
286
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

Determination of a Concentration 
by Oxidation-Reduction Titration
To determine the concentration of a solution of an oxidizing agent or reducing agent, you can
use the sample solution in an oxidation-reduction reaction against a reducing agent or oxidiz-
ing agent of highly certain concentration. To use this method, you must know the balanced
reaction equation of the redox reaction and you must have a means to assess the extent of
the reaction, such as a color change.
For example, here is a balanced equation for a redox reaction between hydrogen peroxide
and permanganate:
5H2O2(aq) + 6H+(aq) + 2MnO4
–(aq) →5O2(g) + 2Mn2+(aq) + 8H2O(l)
In this reaction, the permanganate ion, MnO4
–, itself acts as the indicator because it has an
intense purple color. So, as the reaction proceeds and permanganate is reduced, the purple
color disappears. When the reaction is complete, the solution entirely loses purple color,
becoming colorless.
Analysis of the data from a oxidation-reduction titration is essentially identical to the analy-
sis used for standardization and acid-base titrations. The key elements are the use of a color
change to indicate a reaction endpoint and the use of a balanced reaction equation to make
correct stoichiometric calculations. The fact that the reaction in question is an oxidation-
reduction reaction doesn’t really change the method of analysis. So, to see an example of the
types of calculations used in a redox titration experiment, see determination of concentra-
tion by acid-base titration, earlier in this chapter.
Determination of Mass and Mole Relationships
in a Chemical Reaction
This experiment is not typically performed on its own but rather as a necessary part of other
experiments. The basic principle shows up in two main ways. First, you use a measured mass
to calculate the apparent number of moles in a sample. Second, you use a measured number
of moles to calculate the apparent mass of a sample. The measured quantities may be deter-
mined directly or indirectly, depending on the experiment. In either case, the apparent ratio
of the mass of a substance to the corresponding number of moles represents the experimen-
tal molar mass (g mol–1) of the substance.  
Determination of the Equilibrium Constant 
for a Chemical Reaction
The equilibrium constant, Keq, for a reaction is a ratio of the concentrations of products to reac-
tants when the reaction has achieved equilibrium. So, you can determine the equilibrium con-
stant by measuring the concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium solution. To
use this method, you must know the balanced reaction equation for the reaction in question,
and you must have a reliable means to measure the reactant and product concentrations. 
287
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

Example:
You wish to determine the equilibrium constant for the ionization reaction of ascorbic
acid, C6H8O6, a weak acid. You know that ascorbic acid is monoprotic, contributing one
mole of acid equivalent per mole of compound. Because one product of the ionization
reaction is H+, you choose to measure the concentration of reactants and products by
measuring the pH of a standardized, 1.00 × 10–2 M, solution of ascorbic acid. You observe
the pH to be 3.08. What is the apparent Keq of ascorbic acid?
To find the apparent Keq of ascorbic acid by this method, do the following:
1. To calculate the Keq from a set of measured concentrations, you must have access to a
balanced reaction equation. For the ionization reaction of ascorbic acid, the equation is
C6H8O6(aq) →C6H7O6
–(aq) + H+(aq)
Or to be more rigorously correct,
C6H8O6(aq) + H2O(l) →C6H7O6
–(aq) + H3O+(aq)
2. For simplicity, we’ll use the first equation to set up an expression for Keq:
Keq = products / reactants = [C6H7O6
–]×[ H+] / [C6H8O6]
So, if you can measure the concentrations of C6H8O6, C6H7O6
–, and H+ in a solution of
ascorbic acid at equilibrium, you can use those values to solve for Keq. 
3. Because the reaction in question is an acid ionization reaction, measuring the pH of an
equilibrium solution is a clever way to obtain the needed data. Prior to ionizing, the
ascorbic acid in solution exists at 1.00 × 10–2 M concentration. Each mole of acid that
ionizes depletes that initial concentration and adds one mole of ascorbate (the conju-
gate base) and one mole of H+ to solution. In other words, the equilibrium mixture con-
tains the following concentrations:
[C6H8O6]
=
(1.00 × 10–2 – x) M
[C6H7O6
–]
=
x M
[H+]
=
x M
All concentrations are expressed in terms of x, which means that if you can measure x,
then you know all concentrations and can calculate the equilibrium constant. 
4. The concentration of H+ can be calculated from the measured pH:
pH = –log[H+]
therefore
10–pH = [H+]
The pH of the solution is measured to be 3.08, so [H+] = 10–3.08 = 8.3 × 10–4M.
5. So, x = 8.3 × 10–4M. Knowing this, you can substitute into the expression for Keq
and solve:
Keq = (8.3 × 10–4 × 8.3 × 10–4) / (1.00 × 10–2 – 8.3 × 10–4) = 7.5 × 10–5
Determination of Appropriate Indicators
for Various Acid-Base Titrations and
Determining pH
This experiment is often performed as part of a larger acid-base titration lab. The core concept
is that common colorimetric pH indicators work best within limited pH ranges. Different indi-
cators work best in different pH ranges. The reason for this is that indicator dyes are simply
molecules that can exist in protonated or deprotonated form, with each form exhibiting a 
288
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

different color. The affinity of a given dye molecule for a proton, H+, is expressed by either of
two related quantities: the Ka or the pKa of the molecule.
The Ka is the acid dissociation constant, which is simply the equilibrium constant for the ion-
izing dissociation reaction of the molecule, HA  H+ + A–. The pKa is simply the negative loga-
rithm of the Ka, pKa = –log Ka.
The pKa is a convenient quantity to use for thinking about the effective pH range of an indica-
tor dye. The pKa represents the pH at which one half the indicator molecules exist in proto-
nated form and one half exist in deprotonated form. Beyond about one pH unit above or
below its characteristic pKa, an indicator dye is outside of its useful range — no discernible
changes in color can be detected this far from the pKa. So, it is best to use indicator dyes
with pKa values as close as possible to the expected pH range of an experiment. If no reason-
able pH range can be estimated prior to the experiment, it may be necessary to conduct the
experiment multiple times, in the presence of indicators covering a range of pKa values.
Here are the most common indicator dyes alongside their respective pKa values:

Determination of the Rate of 
a Reaction and Its Order
You determine the rate at which reactant is converted into product and, by varying the initial
concentrations of reactants across a series of trials, you gather data that allow you to deter-
mine the reaction order. The overall reaction order is the sum of the orders of the individual
reactants. Reaction order is a measure of the sensitivity of the reaction rate to changes in
concentration.
Example:
You measure the initial rate of the following (unbalanced) reaction — the acid-catalyzed
iodination (addition of iodine) of acetone — under four different sets of reactant
concentrations.
C3H6O + I2 →C3H6IO + H+ + I–
You observe the following results.

What is the reaction order of each species (C3H6O, I2 and H+) and what is the overall reaction
order? What are the rate law and the apparent rate constant? To determine the rate law for
each reactant, observe the following:
1. To determine rates like those listed in the previous table, you need a means of detect-
ing the progress of the reaction, which typically means having some way to measure
the appearance of product or the disappearance of reactant. Often, the simplest and
most precise way to measure reaction progress is spectrophotometry, as described in
the determination of electrochemical series, later in this chapter.
Because rates are often so dependent on reactant concentrations, it is usually advis-
able to measure “initial rates,” which are fast, linear portions of the early reaction,
before depletion of reactants appreciably slows the observed rate.
2. Once you have a set of initial rates at varying concentrations of reactants and/or prod-
ucts, you can seek patterns in the variation of rate with concentration. In the example
data, it is clear that doubling the concentration of I2 had no effect on rate when other
concentrations remained constant, suggesting that the reaction is zero order in I2. 
3. Determining that I2 concentrations do not impact rate allows you to focus exclusively
on C3H6O and H+ concentrations. Doubling the concentration of H+ doubles the
observed rate suggesting that the reaction is first order in H+. 
4. Maintaining the increased concentration of H+ while doubling the concentration of
C3H6O causes a further doubling of the rate, suggesting that the reaction is first order
in C3H6O.You can convert the individual reaction orders to an overall reaction order
and a rate law with a known rate constant, k, as follows:
1. Because the reaction is first order in two reactants, the overall reaction order is 2. 
2. The reaction order is reflected in the rate law for the reaction, Rate = k[C3H6O][H+].
3. To determine the value of the rate constant, k, simply substitute in any set of data
from any of the individual rate experiments:
Rate = k[C3H6O][H+]
k = Rate / ([C3H6O][H+]) = (4.8 × 10–7 M s–1) / (0.100M × 0.100M) = 4.8 × 10–5 M–1 s–1
Determination of the Enthalpy Change
Associated with a Reaction
This lab involves calorimetry, the measurement of heat transfer associated with a process
(such as a chemical reaction). One common reaction employed in this lab is the dissolution
reaction of a solute into water, although many other types of reaction can be used. At con-
stant pressure, the absorption or release of heat that accompanies a chemical reaction is
equivalent to the reaction enthalpy, ∆Hrxn . Reactions that release heat are exothermic and
have negative reaction enthalpy. Reactions that absorb heat are endothermic and have posi-
tive reaction enthalpy. By measuring the change in temperature of a reaction system of
known mass and composition, you can calculate the molar reaction enthalpy, the amount of
heat released or absorbed per mole of reaction.
Example:
You add 100.mL of water to a well-insulated (probably polystyrene foam) cup. You
observe that the water temperature is 22.0°C. You then add 2.70g solid NaOH to the
water, cap the cup with an insulated lid, and swirl gently to promote dissolution. While
the NaOH dissolves, you monitor the temperature of the solution via a thermometer
290
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

extending through a perforation in the lid. When the temperature levels off for approxi-
mately one half minute, indicating that the dissolution reaction has completed, you
record the final temperature as 28.5°C. What is the apparent heat of solution, ∆Hsoln, of
sodium hydroxide?
Because the reaction performed in this lab is a dissolution reaction, the reaction
enthalpy is also known as the “heat of solution.” In other words, ∆Hsoln = ∆Hrxn. The
dissolution reaction is
NaOH(s) + H2O(l) →Na+(aq) + OH–(aq)
∆Hsoln = ?
The units of the heat of solution are joules per mole, J mol–1. So, if you can measure the
heat flow that accompanies the dissolution reaction, you can divide that heat by the
moles of NaOH dissolved to find ∆Hsoln.
The key experimental trick is realizing that as NaOH dissolves, heat flows to or from the
water in which it is dissolving. We can neglect any heat flow to or through the polystyrene
cup as it is such a good insulator. So, qNaOH = –qwater. You can measure the change in the heat
content of the water by measuring a change in the temperature of the solution (assuming
that the mass of the solute is much smaller than the mass of the solvent — a fair assump-
tion in dilute solutions). 
To find the apparent heat of solution of sodium hydroxide from the data in this experiment,
do the following:
1. To translate between temperature and heat flow, you need the constant-pressure
calorimetry equation,
q = m × Cp × ∆T = m × Cp × (Tfinal – Tintitial)
Here, m is the mass of the water, and Cp is the specific heat capacity of the water.
2. Because the density of water is 1.00 g mL–1, you can calculate the mass of water in the
experiment:
Mass of water = 100mL H2O × (1.00g / mL H2O) = 100.g
3. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.186 J g–1 °C–1. So, you can calculate the heat
transfer during dissolution as
q = (100.g) × (4.186 J g–1 °C–1) × (28.5 °C – 22.0 °C) = 2.72 × 103 J
4. So, as the NaOH dissolved, it released 2.72 × 103 J of heat energy into the water. In other
words, qNaOH = –2.72 × 103 J. This amount of heat was released by 2.70g NaOH. You can
convert to moles NaOH by using the molar mass:
Moles NaOH = 2.70g NaOH × (1mol NaOH / 40.0g NaOH) = 0.0675mol NaOH
5. So, the apparent heat of solution of NaOH is:
∆Hsoln = qNaOH / mol NaOH = –2.72 × 103 J / 0.0675mol = –4.03 × 104 J mol–1.
Separation and Qualitative Analysis 
of Anions and Cations
This lab is essentially about the descriptive chemistry of ionic compounds and their aqueous
solutions. Qualitative analysis involves testing for the presence or absence of a compound,
as opposed to measuring the precise concentration of that compound. Compounds can often
be identified based on the formation of insoluble precipitates or colored compounds.
Sometimes it can be difficult to test for the presence of one particular “target” ion within a
291
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

solution of many ions, because the “nontarget” ions can interfere with intended reactions.
For example, Cd2+ can be detected in aqueous solution by the formation of a yellow precipi-
tate upon addition of S2–. However, if Pb2+ or Cu2+ happen to be in the sample solution, a black
precipitate forms upon addition of S2–, which makes analysis for Cd2+ impossible. In cases like
these, it is desirable to be able to selectively separate interfering ions from a solution while
preserving other ions targeted for analysis. In other cases, the goal is simply to analyze a
mixture of ions for the total ion composition of the solution. Separation schemes typically
depend on the differential solubility of different ionic compounds.
Example:
You are given a solution that may contain Cl– anion, I– anion, both, or neither. To deter-
mine which of the four possibilities is true, you may use the following reagents: water,
nitric acid (HNO3), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and ammonia (NH3). In addition, you have a
standard array of glassware and filtration devices. 
To separate the anions in the sample solution with the materials provided, do the following:
1. First, acidify the unknown chloride/iodide solution by dropwise addition of HNO3 until
the solution is mildly acidic. Because Cl– and I– are weakly basic, addition of acid
reduces their solubility and makes them easier to separate.
2. Next, slowly add AgNO3 until any precipitation is complete. Although silver nitrate is
soluble, other silver salts, like AgCl and AgI, are insoluble. Filter and wash the precipi-
tate with water. Examine the precipitate for color. AgCl is white, and AgI is yellow.
3. Next, resuspend the precipitate in a small amount of water and add NH3 and AgNO3.
Mix well. The added silver nitrate promotes precipitation of silver salts due to the
common ion effect. At this point, any iodide anion present in solution should precipi-
tate as yellow silver iodide, AgI. Separate the supernatant from any AgI precipitate.
4. The ammonia that remains in the supernatant forms a cationic complex with silver,
Ag(NH3)2
+. After dropwise addition of HNO3 to reduce anion solubility, any Cl– in solu-
tion precipitates as white AgCl salt.
Synthesis of a Coordination Compound 
and Its Chemical Analysis
“Coordination compounds” or “coordination complexes” are structures in which a central
metal atom is surrounded by a host of nonmetallic groups called ligands. The ligands are
bound to the metal by “coordinate covalent” bonds. These kinds of bonds are particularly
common between transition metals and partners that possess lone pairs of electrons. The
lone pair containing atom acts as an electron donor (a Lewis base), giving both electrons to a
bond with the metal, which acts in turn as an electron acceptor (a Lewis acid). Coordination
compounds are often intensely colored and can have properties that are quite different than
those of the free metal.
This lab, in which you synthesize a coordination compound, is often combined with the two
labs that follow it on this list: gravimetric determination and colorimetric or spectrophoto-
metric determination. In keeping with that practice, we’ll stick with one “example” system
through these three labs.
Example:
You synthesize a copper-centered coordination compound by the addition of ammonia to
a blue, aqueous solution of copper (II) sulfate. When ammonia is added to the copper (II)
sulfate, the blue solution turns a deep purple color, indicating that you have successfully
292
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

formed a coordination complex. To separate the complexes from the surrounding solu-
tion, you add ethanol to selectively precipitate the complex. This addition results in the
formation of crystals of your coordination complex. Using a vacuum filtration apparatus,
you repeatedly wash your crystals, rinsing them with an ammonia-ethanol mixture. You
allow the crystals to dry overnight. Presumably, you have formed a complex that contains
ammonia and/or sulfate ligands surrounding a copper cation center. In the following two
labs, you’ll analyze the compound gravimetrically and spectrophotometrically.
Analytical Gravimetric Determination
Gravimetric analysis entails measurements of mass to determine the composition of a com-
pound. Here, we extend the copper coordination complex example from the synthesis of a
coordination compound in the previous experiment.
Example:
Based on the chemicals used in the synthesis, the copper coordination complex likely
includes ammonia and/or sulfate ligands, although the number of each type of ligand
around the copper cation center is unknown. So, at this point, the formula of the com-
plex is
Cua(NH3)b(SO4)c · nH2O
In this formula, a, b and c represent the stoichiometric amounts of copper, ammonia,
and sulfate, respectively. The “· nH2O” indicates that some number n of water molecules
may hydrate the complex.
To analyze the composition of your complex, do the following steps:
1. Dissolve 1.00g of your purified crystals in nitric acid, HNO3, which causes the following
reaction:
Cua(NH3)b(SO4)c · nH2O + xH+ →aCu2+ + bNH4
+ + cSO4
2– + nH2O
2. To this solution, add lead (II) acetate, Pb(C2H3O2)2, to selectively precipitate sulfate
anion as lead sulfate:
Pb2+(aq) + SO4
2–(aq) →PbSO4(s) 
3. Carefully filter the white PbSO4 precipitate and allow it to dry overnight before measur-
ing its mass. From the mass of PbSO4 you can determine the number of moles of sulfate
recovered. Within error, this number should be equivalent to the number of moles of
sulfate in the original 1.00g of crystals. 
4. To determine the amount of ammonia in your compound, you perform an acid-base
titration (covered in more detail in previously in the chapter). Briefly, you dissolve
1.00g of your crystals in 50.0mL water, add a pH indicator, and titrate with acid. By
doing this, you can indirectly determine the amount of ammonia in your compound. By
observing the endpoint of the titration, you can calculate the moles of ammonia that
must have been present in the original sample, because the color change of the titra-
tion reflects the progress of this reaction: 
bNH3(aq) + xH+(aq) →bNH4
+(aq)
Within error, the number of moles of ammonia detected by your titration should be
equivalent to the number of moles of ammonia in the original 1.00g of crystals.
The analysis for copper content of the coordination complex is done spectrophotomet-
rically, as described in determination of electrochemical series, found below. 
293
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

Colorimetric or Spectrophotometric Analysis
Spectrophotometric analysis measures the amount of a component within a mixture by
exploiting the ability of the component to absorb electromagnetic radiation of a specific
wavelength. Colorimetric analysis is simply spectrophotometric analysis using wavelength
in the range of visible light. In practice, these analyses most often make use of Beer’s law,
a mathematical relationship between the concentration of a substance and the absorption
of light of a certain wavelength by that substance:
A = abc
You may have encountered the equivalent equation A = εlc. This equation is absolutely iden-
tical to the one given above, but simply uses the variable ε for a and the variable l for b. 
To properly use Beer’s Law, you must clearly understand the meaning of each variable.
The variable A is the absorbance of a specific wavelength of light. The wavelength used is
typically one that is strongly absorbed by the compound of interest but not well absorbed
by other components in the sample.
The variable a is the molar absorptivity, an experimentally determined constant that depends
on the compound of interest and on the wavelength of light used for analysis. Typically, the
units of a are M–1 cm–1, but other units can be used. The key criterion is that the units used in
a match those used in the variables b and c.
The variable b is the pathlength, the distance of the path of light as it travels through the
sample. Most often, the pathlength is 1cm, but this value can change in the case of strongly
or weakly absorbing samples. Whatever the pathlength, it must match the units used in the
variable a.
The variable c is the concentration of the compound of interest. Typically, the units of c are
molar (that is, M, mol L–1), but that can change in special cases. Whatever the concentration
units, they must math those used in the variable a. 
Example:
To continue the analysis of the copper coordination complex synthesized and gravimet-
rically analyzed in the previous two experiments, you subject the compound to spec-
trophotometric analysis to determine its copper content.
To subject the coordination compound to spectrophotometric analysis, you must first esti-
mate the molar absorptivity of your copper compound:
1. Calibrate a spectrometer at 645nm wavelength by using a series of Cu2+ standard solu-
tions, diluted as necessary in 1M HNO3. 
2. Dissolve 0.50g of coordination compound crystals in 20.0mL 1M HNO3 and transfer a
sample of the solution to a 1cm-pathlength quartz cell. 
If the molar absorptivity of your compound, estimated by the Cu2+ calibration, 
is 5.2 M–1 cm–1, and the absorbance reading of your dissolved sample is 0.47, what is
the apparent copper concentration in the dissolved sample? What is the apparent
molar mass of the compound in your crystals?
294
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

To determine the apparent copper concentration of your sample, do the following: 
1. The apparent concentration of Cu2+ in the sample can be directly determined by using
Beer’s Law:
A = abc
therefore
c = A / (ab)
c = 0.47 / (5.2 M–1 cm–1 × 1 cm) = 9.0 × 10–2M Cu2+
2. Assume for the moment that each coordination complex centers on a single Cu2+ ion
(a reasonable working assumption), then the concentration of coordination complex in
your sample is also 9.0 × 10–2M.
You can proceed from these results to estimate the molar mass of your copper-centered
coordination complex as follows:
1. You prepared the spectrophotometer sample by dissolving 0.50g compound into
20.0mL (0.0200L) 1M HNO3. Using this information, you can estimate the moles of coor-
dination compound in the sample:
9.0 × 10–2mol L–1 × 0.0200L = 1.8 × 10–3mol
2. So, 1.8 × 10–3 moles of compound appear to have been present in the 0.50g sample you
dissolved. Therefore, the apparent molar mass of the compound is
0.50g / 1.8 × 10–3mol ≈280 g mol–1
Separation by Chromatography
Chromatography is a useful method for separating the components of a mixture. Although
many variations of chromatography allow for quantitative analysis of the components of a
mixture, the most frequent uses of chromatography in AP chemistry are qualitative, reveal-
ing how many components are in a mixture or determining whether a certain component is
in the mixture or not.
In a chromatographic analysis, the sample to be analyzed is included in a “mobile phase,” a
fluid mixture that passes over a “stationary phase,” a surface or porous medium that inter-
acts with the mobile phase as it passes. Separation of components within the sample
depends on those components interacting differently with the stationary phase. Some com-
ponents of the sample may be more strongly attracted to the stationary phase than others,
and these strongly attracted components take longer to be swept along by the flowing
mobile phase. Separations can be based on charge, size, polarity, or other properties. 
One common way to characterize the separated components of a mixture is the retention
factor, Rf. To calculate an Rf, you must measure two quantities: the distance covered by the
fastest-moving part of the mobile phase (often called the “solvent front”) and the distance
covered by the component in question. The retention factor is simply the ratio of the two
quantities.
Rf = (distance of solvent front) / (distance of sample)

Preparation and Properties of Buffer Solutions
Buffer solutions are mixtures of conjugate acid-conjugate base pairs that resist changes in
pH. Typically weak acids and their conjugate bases are used as buffers. Essentially, as extra
acid or base is added to a buffer solution, the proportion of conjugate acid to conjugate base
shifts in response, thereby minimizing the effect of the acid or base addition. The ability of a
buffer solution to resist pH change depends on the concentration of the buffer compounds in
solution and on the proportion of acid and base conjugate forms (that is, the ratio of HA to
A–). A buffer is at maximum buffering capacity when [HA] = [A–]. Under this optimal-buffering
condition, the pH of a buffer solution equals the pKa of the weak conjugate acid. Buffers tend
to be useful within about 1 pH unit of their characteristic pKa.
The Henderson-Hasselbach equation describes the relationship between pH, pKa and the
relative concentrations of conjugates acid and base in a buffer solution:
pH = pKa + log ([A–]/[HA])
Example:
You are preparing an acetic acid/acetate buffer solution. At room temperature, acetic
acid has pKa = 4.76. You have 500.mL of 0.25M acetic acid. You want the final pH of your
solution to be 5.00. What mass of sodium acetate salt must you add to achieve the
desired pH?
To determine the mass of sodium acetate you must add to achieve a solution with pH 5.00,
do the following:
1. Substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbach equation your known values for pH and pKa,
and then solve for the desired ratio of conjugate base to conjugate acid:
5.00 = 4.76 + log ([A–]/[HA])
0.24 = log ([A–]/[HA])
100.24 = [A–]/[HA] = 1.74
2. So, for every mole of acetic acid (the conjugate acid, HA) in solution you want to add
1.74 moles acetate (the conjugate base, A–). 
Moles acetic acid = (0.25mol L–1) × (0.500L) = 0.13mol
Moles acetate = 1.74 × 0.13mol = 0.23mol
3. So, you want to add 0.23mol sodium acetate, C2H3O2Na. The molar mass of anhydrous
(that is, not hydrated) sodium acetate is 82.0 g mol–1.
0.23 mol C2H3O2Na × 82.0 g mol–1 = 19 g C2H3O2Na
Determination of Electrochemical Series
In this lab, you use your knowledge of electrochemical cells to explain and predict observed
voltage potentials in cells of differing composition. Key tasks are to identify the anode and
cathode of a cell and to use a table of standard reduction potentials to predict the voltage
potential of a cell given its composition.
By measuring the voltage potentials of a series of half-cells, all against the same counterpart
half-cell, you can construct an electrochemical series, a ranked list of redox reactions in
296
Part VI: Getting Wet and Dirty: Labs 

order of reduction potential. Tables of standard reduction potentials represent just such a
series, one in which the constant counterpart half cell is the standard hydrogen electrode:
2H+(aq) + 2e– →H2(g)
E°=0 (by definition) 
Example:
A series of half-cell solutions is tested against a constant half-cell counterpart of 1.0M
copper (II) nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, with a solid copper electrode. In all trials, an ammeter indi-
cates that electrons flow toward the copper electrode from the opposing electrode. The
following voltage potentials are observed:
1.0M lead (II) nitrate, Pb(NO3)2
0.47 V
1.0M zinc (II) nitrate, Zn(NO3)2
1.10 V
1.0M iron (II) nitrate, Fe(NO3)2
0.78 V
Given that E° = +0.34 V for the reduction of copper (II) cation, which divalent cation is
the strongest reducing agent: lead (II), zinc (II) or iron (II)?
To determine the strongest reducing agent from the given data, observe the following:
1. The observed voltage potentials are standard cell potentials:
E°cell = E°red(cathode) – E°red(anode)
2. Because electron flow was toward the copper electrode, you know that the copper
electrode was the cathode in each case. 
3. Because each observed cell potential is positive and larger than +0.34 V, you know that
each metal tested has a negative standard reduction potential.
The most negative of the standard reduction potentials must belong to zinc (II) cation.
Based on the data given, zinc (II) cation, Zn2+, is the strongest reducing agent. 
To calculate the standard reduction potential of the zinc (II) cation, do the following:
1. Substitute into the equation for standard cell potential:
E°cell = E°red(Cu2+) – E°red(Zn2+)
1.10 V = +0.34 V – E°red(Zn2+)
E°red(Zn2+) = –0.76 V
2. Because zinc (II) has the most negative standard reduction potential of the three metal
ions tested, it is the most difficult to reduce and is therefore the strongest reducing
agent.
Measurements Using Electrochemical 
Cells and Electroplating
This lab requires you to combine your knowledge of electrochemical cells with basic stoi-
chiometry and gravimetric analysis. Electroplating occurs at a cathode when electrons
reduce metal cations in solution, causing them to deposit onto the cathode. By measuring
the mass of a cathode before and after an electrochemical reaction in which electroplating
occurs, you can directly determine the mass of metal deposited onto the cathode during the
reaction and compare that mass with one expected from calculations.
297
Chapter 28: Taking the Tour: Recommended AP Experiments

Example:
Identical carbon electrodes, each with a mass of 5.50g are immersed into a 1.0M solution
of nickel (II) chloride, NiCl2. The poles of the electrodes are connected to a battery, and
current flows through the cell for 30. minutes at 1.5 amperes. What is the expected mass
of the cathode after 30 minutes?
To determine the expected mass of the cathode, make the following observations and
calculations:
1. Deposition of Ni(s) happens at the cathode, where the following reaction takes place:
Ni2+ (aq) + 2e– →Ni(s)
So, it takes 2 moles of electrons to electroplate 1 mole of nickel.
2. Calculate the total moles of electrons that flow through the cathode during the experi-
ment. This calculation requires you to use the unit of the Faraday, F. One Faraday is
charge associated with one mole of electrons. Each electron has 1.602 × 10–19 Coulombs
of charge, so: 
F = (6.022 × 1023mol–1)(1.602 × 10–19 C) = 9.649 × 104 C mol–1
3. The experiment lasted for 30 minutes (1.8 × 103 seconds) at 1.5 amperes. One ampere is
one Coulomb per second (C s–1), so the total moles of electrons are
Moles e– = (1.8 × 103 s) × (1.5 C s–1) × (1 mol e– / 9.649 × 104 C) = 2.8 × 10–2 mol e–
4. Calculate the mass of nickel that you expect to electroplate as a result of transferring
2.8 × 10–2 moles of electrons into the NiCl2 solution:
Mass Ni(s) = (2.8 × 10–2 mol e–) × (1mol Ni / 2mol e–) × (58.7g / 1mol Ni) = 0.82g
5. Because the initial mass of the carbon electrode was 5.50g, the expected final mass
(after electroplating) is 5.50g + 0.82g = 6.32g.
Synthesis, Purification, and Analysis 
of an Organic Compound
Typically, this lab involves a relatively straightforward synthesis — one with few steps. The
synthesis is followed by a purification of the synthesized compound. In organic synthesis,
you typically calculate a percent yield following each major step to track the progress of
your reactions. Whatever the chemical details of the compound synthesized, the principles
of “yield” are the same: 
Percent yield = 100% × (actual yield) / (theoretical yield)
Actual yield is simply the amount of synthesized compound actually obtained after purifica-
tion. Theoretical yield is the (never-actually-obtained) amount of compound that would
result if each step of synthesis occurs with perfect efficiency and if there is no loss of com-
pound between synthetic steps or during the purification.

Answers to Practice Test 1
Multiple choice
1. (A). Carbon dioxide and water are the characteristic products of a combustion reaction.
2. (B). The activity series of metals determines whether or not single replacement reactions
will occur.
3. (E). Titrations are used in acid/base reactions.
4. (C). Sodium, magnesium, and aluminum are all metals, but aluminum has the greatest mass.
5. (E). Chlorine is the farthest right on the periodic table and is therefore the most
electronegative.
6. (E). Chlorine has the highest first ionization energy because it has the strongest pull on its
electrons. (Chlorine wants to gain electrons, not lose them.)
7. (B). All of the alkaline earth metals have extremely large jumps between their second and
third ionization energies because after the second ionization, they achieve the electron con-
figuration of a noble gas and are reluctant to relinquish it.
8. (A). Atomic radius increases to the left across a period and down in a family. All of these ele-
ments are in the same row so only the first trend applies. Sodium has the largest radius
because it is the farthest left.
9. (C). Rutherford discovered the nucleus through his famous gold foil experiment, which led
to the development of the Rutherford model of the atom.
10. (D). Our modern understanding of the atom is based on the Quantum Mechanical model.
11. (A). The Thompson model of the atom, often referred to as the “plum pudding model,” con-
sisted of negatively charged particles in a diffuse soup of positive charge.
12. (A). Boyle’s law assumes constant temperature.
13. (E). The ideal gas law can be used to derive many of the other gas laws.
14. (C). Graham’s law describes the phenomenon of effusion.
15. (D). CH4 has a tetrahedral geometry and is therefore not planar.
16. (D). Oxygen has a 2– charge as an ion, so it will form a salt in a 1:2 ratio with any alkali
metal, of which lithium is the only one on the list.
17. (C). Convert 1mol of Ag to grams of Zn using the mole ratios in the balanced equation to get
your answer.
18. (B). pH does not depend on compound molarity, only on [H+]. You do not have a calculator
to take its logarithm, but you don’t need one because the answers don’t require you to be
nit-picky. You know that a solution with an [H+] concentration that has a coefficient greater
than 1 will have a pH value between its coefficient (neglecting the negative sign) and its
coefficient minus 1. In this case, 5.37 is the only number between 6 and 5.
19. (D). Fluorine is the most electronegative element on the periodic table and therefore pulls
most heavily on the electrons of a bound carbon atom. Nitrogen and oxygen, lying so
closely together on the periodic table, are quite close in electronegativity and therefore
form a nonpolar bond.

20. (D). Molybdenum is one of the transition metals with an exceptional electron configuration.
In order to achieve greater stability, it will steal an electron from its 5s orbital in order to
obtain a half-full 4d orbital.
21. (E). The best buffers are those whose pKa values are close to the desired pH. You’re given
the pOH here, so you need to subtract it from 14 to get a desired pH of 9.7. Here again, you
cannot take a logarithm without a calculator but you know that you have a pH with a value
between 9 and 10, which means that your desired exponent will be –10. Choice E is the only
one that fits the bill.
22. (A). If you draw out the Lewis structures (see Figure 29-3) of the compounds given, you will
find that choice A is the only one with two double bonds.
23. (C). Increasing the pressure in the reaction vessel will favor the side of the reaction with
fewer moles of gas, which is the reactants side. Adding a catalyst promotes the formation of
both products and reactants, so although the equilibrium concentration of product isn’t
altered by the catalyst, adding it nonetheless promotes product formation prior to attaining
equilibrium.
24. (A). The quantum number l has values ranging from 0 to n-1. Since n is 3 in this case, you’re
left with three possible values: 0, 1, and 2.
25. (D). Collisions between the particles of an ideal gas are completely elastic, meaning that no
energy is lost in the process of colliding.
26. (B). A compound that combines with chlorine in a 1:2 ratio is likely to be an alkaline earth
metal, meaning its electron configuration should end with a full s orbital. B is the only
choice that fits this criterion, as it is the electron configuration for magnesium.
27. (E). Ammonium is a polyatomic ion held together by covalent bonds, but its bond with chlo-
rine is ionic.
28. (B). This is a steep curve that moves from low pH to high pH, with an equivalence point of 7.
It must be a strong acid titrated with a strong base.
29. (D). Distillation is the best process for separating miscible liquids.
30. (B). A Lewis base donates a pair of electrons to a coordinate covalent bond. In this case,
that pair of electrons comes from one of the lone pairs on the oxygen of OH–, so it is the
Lewis base.
31. (D). The information provided should lead you to the formula C5H12 + 8O2 →6H2O + 5CO2 for
the complete combustion of pentane.
32. (C). Phosphorous has 5 valence electrons.
33. (C). Phosphorous pentachloride has trigonal bipyramidal geometry.
34. (B). You calculate EMF, or E°
cell, by subtracting the reduction potential of the anode from
that of the cathode. Oxidation happens at the anode, so the reaction Ag+(aq) + e– →Ag(s)
must be the anode reaction. This leads you to an EMF of 1.23 – 0.80 = 0.43V.
35. (A). All of the ions listed have the same number of electrons, but nitrogen has the smallest
number of protons, which means less positive charge to pull in the negatively charged elec-
tron cloud.

36. (C). O2– has the regular electron configuration of oxygen plus an additional 2 electrons,
giving it the electron configuration of neon.
37. (E). The complete reaction is answer choice A, however the net ionic reaction takes account
of dissociation and eliminates spectators, which is answer choice E. CaCO3 is also a carbon-
ate and all carbonates are insoluble except for those containing ammonium or alkali metals
so that product must be a solid, which choice E also shows.
38. (C). The easiest way to approach this problem is to use the answer choices and do rough
calculations of the percent composition of sulfur in each one. Choice A gives you 32 ÷ 48,
which is too large. Choice B is also too large and choices D and E are too small. Choice C,
which gives you a percent composition of 32÷80 = 0.4, is the correct answer.
39. (B). Convert liters of H2 to grams of HCl using the mole ratios in the balanced equation and
the conversion 22.4L per mole of gas at STP. 
40. (A). Arrow 1 shows a transition from the solid to the gas regions on the phase diagram,
which is the process of sublimation.
41. (D). Both questions 41 and 42 refer to the balanced half-reaction. Balance the excess oxygen
on the lefthand side by adding 4mol H2O to the right. Then balance the hydrogen on the left
with the hydrogen atoms in the water on the right by adding the coefficient 8. Finally, bal-
ance charge by adding five electrons to the lefthand side, giving you a total charge of +2 on
both sides, leaving you with. MnO4
– + 8H+ +5e– →Mn2+ + 4H2O.
42. (C). According to the equation you created to answer question 41, 4mol of water are
needed.
43. (A). The higher the energy of light, the shorter its wavelength. Your spectroscopy equation 
E = hc ÷ λ can be used to verify this inverse relationship.
44. (E). NH4I is the only solution that will form a strong acid (HI) and a weak base NH4OH when
dissolved in water, leaving it with a low pH. All of the others will form both a strong acid and
a strong base when they react with water.
45. (D). Primary amines have the functional group –NH2.
46. (B). Use the formula M1V1 = M2V2 to solve for M2. Be careful though! V2 is the final diluted
volume, which in this case is 50mL. 
47. (E). When comparing experiments 1 and 2, the reaction rate does not change, indicating A is
zero order. While comparing experiments 2 and 3, the rate doubles while B doubles indicat-
ing a first-order reaction.
48. (C). The balanced double replacement reaction between barium chloride and potassium
sulfate is BaCl2(aq) + K2SO4(aq) →BaSO4(s) + 2KCl(aq). You know that the sulfate is the pre-
cipitate because barium is one of the elements whose presence makes a sulfate insoluble
according to your solubility rules.
49. (D). The magnesium cation has an oxidation number of +2, hydrogen is +1 when bonded to
a nonmetal, the fluoride ion is –1, and oxygen is always –2 except in peroxides.
50. (C). This question tests purely your ability to memorize the polyatomic ions and their
charges. Phosphate has the greatest with a –3 charge.
51. (B). Potassium forms a +1 ion while sulfur forms a –2 ion, so they will combine in a 2:1 ratio.

52. (D). Use Kw and the given Kb to solve for Ka. 
Since the coefficient on Ka is 1, the pKa is simply the exponent (neglecting the negative sign).
53. (D). Oxidizing agents have positive values of E°.
54. (B). This reaction requires the use of your chart of standard reduction potentials (which
you will be given on the exam). Recall that reduction happens at the cathode of an elec-
trolytic cell and choice B is the only answer with a negative reduction potential, so it is the
only choice that is a reduction reaction.
55. (D). Remember the concept “like dissolves like.” The intermolecular forces in propanol are
the most similar to those of water.
56. (E). All of these pairs involve the loss of hydrogen ions, but choice E involves the loss of
more than just a single hydrogen, so it is not a conjugate acid/base pair.
57. (E). 120 days amounts to two half-lives of the radioisotope, so they must send 6.0g total.
58. (B). O-H, N-H, and F-H bonds can all participate in hydrogen bonding, but I-H bonds cannot.
59. (A). The balanced reaction here is 2H2 + O2 →2H2O. Determine the limiting reagent by con-
verting grams of hydrogen to grams of oxygen using the mole ratios from the balanced
equation.
This reveals that H2 is the limiting reagent so now you need to convert grams of H2 to grams
of H2O through a similar calculation.
60. (C). According to Boyle’s law, pressure and volume are inversely proportional, so halving
one should double the other.
61. (B). Both of the carbon atoms in ethene are sp2 hybridized.
62. (C). Follow the rules for addition and subtraction; the answer contains the same number of
decimal places as the least number of decimal places of the measurements used in the cal-
culation. So, the calculation in answer C yields 1.334, with four significant figures.
63. (E). All of the elements listed have the same electron configuration as (are isoelectronic
with) argon except for Mg2+.
64. (A). Begin by calculating the molality of the solution by converting grams of KCl to moles
and g of solvent to kg: 
Notice that KCl has a van’t Hoff factor of 2; in other words, 1 mole of KCl dissolves into 2
moles of particles, K+ and Cl–. So, 5.00 molal KCl contributes a solute particle molality of 10.0.
Multiply the particle molality by the Kf to get a freezing point depression of 18.6 degrees.
This means that the new freezing point of the water is 0.00°C–18.6°C = –18.6°C or 255K.
65. (D). 10.0mL of 1.00M NaOH will be neutralized by 10.0mL of a monoprotic acid, 0.500mL of a
diprotic acid, or 3.33mL of a triprotic acid. D is the only answer choice that fits.

66. (C). There are three nonbonding pairs of electrons in the molecule HCl, which can be seen
by drawing its Lewis dot structure (see Figure 29-4).
67. (B). All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble except those containing Ag, Pb, and Hg.
68. (B). Multiply the molarity by the volume to get the number of moles present. 5.00 × 0.250 =
1.25.
69. (E). When an element undergoes alpha decay, it loses 4 from its mass number and 2 from its
atomic number, so the progenitor of Lead-206 must be polonium-210.
70. (B). The question requires you to use Boyle’s Law, P1V1 = P2V2. You’re asked to find a final
pressure, so rearrange the gas law to the form P2 = (P1V1) / V2. Substituting in known values
gives you P2 = (1.50atm × 2.00L) / 5.00L = 0.600atm. 
71. (A). Convert the molarity of acid to the molarity of the base, taking account of equivalents
and volumes.
72. (D). A solution with a pOH of 4.50 has a pH of 9.50, so the exponent on its H+ concentration
must be –10.
73. (B). Although most exothermic reactions are spontaneous, all are not. All exothermic reac-
tions have a negative ∆H and the energy of their products is always lower than that of their
reactants.
74. (E). Iodine-131 could undergo alpha decay to create antimony-127, beta plus decay to create
tellurium-131, gamma decay to create iodine-131(gamma decay does not change the identity
of an atom), or beta minus decay to create xenon-131. Cesium-135 is the odd man out.
75. (D). An alpha decay of polonium-218 will change it into lead-214. Beta minus decay will not
change the mass number, but it will increase the atomic number by one leaving bismuth-214.
Free response
1. (a) The equilibrium constant is constructed by taking the concentration of all of the prod-
ucts raised to the powers of their coefficients divided by the concentrations of all of the
reactants (except for water) raised to the power of their coefficients. Because the reaction
is an acid dissociation, the Keq in this case is also the Ka.
(b) 7.85 × 10–4M. The given molarity is equivalent to [C6H5COOH]. When C6H5COOH dissoci-
ates in water, it creates 1 H3O+ molecule for every C6H5COO– molecule, so those two concen-
trations are the same, and we can say that they both equal x. The final concentration of
C6H5COOH is 0.0100M – x, which we can safely approximate to be 0.0100M, leaving you with

Solve the equation for x to get your answer.
(c) 2 C6H5COOH + Ca(OH)2 →2H2O + Ca(C6H5COO–)2.
(d) This is clearly a titration problem.
(i)
5.50 × 10–6M. To calculate the [H+] you simply need to solve the equation 10–pH = [H+].
(ii) 1.82 × 10–9M.You know that [H+] = 5.50 × 10–6M. Further, you know that in aqueous
solution, [H+]×[OH–] = 10–14. So, you can substitute in your known value for hydrogen
ion concentration and solve for the hydroxide ion concentration. 
(iii) 1.66 × 10–6M benzoic acid. The road to this answer is a bit long and winding, and has
to do with understanding what happens when you titrate a weak acid with a strong
base. Because the base is strong and the acid is weak, essentially all added base
titrates away hydrogen ions from the weak acid — initally, at least. This 1-for-1 pat-
tern holds through the “buffer region” of the weak acid, about 1 to 1.5 units above
its pKa. The pKa of benzoic acid is –log(6.17 × 10–5) = 4.21, so the final pH of 5.26 is
within the buffer region. So, all added base acts to neutralize hydrogen ion from the
weak acid. The total moles of base added in this case are:
(5.00 × 10–6M) × (10.0 × 10–3L) × (2 OH– / Ca(OH)2) = 1.00 × 10–7 moles OH–
Because you are in the buffer region, you know that the original number of moles of weak
acid equals the final number of moles plus the 1.00 × 10–7 moles that have been neutralized.
That’s fine, but what are the final moles of weak acid? 
To find the final moles of weak acid, use your answers from part (b) and part (d-i). You
know the Ka = 6.17 × 10–5. Further, you know the final concentrations of hydrogen ion and
benzoate ion, [H+] = [C6H5COO–] = 5.50 × 10–6M. Plug these three known values into the equa-
tion for Ka, and you can solve for the final benzoic acid concentration, [C6H5COOH] = 4.90 ×
10–7M. Multiply this value by the 0.100L final volume (10.0mL + 90.0mL) to obtain the final
moles of benzoic acid, 4.90 × 10–8 moles. Now, add this final amount to the 1.00 × 10–7 moles
that were neutralized, and you get the initial moles of benzoic acid, 1.49 × 10–7 moles. These
moles were initially present in 90.0mL of solution. Calculate the initial molarity of benzoic
acid by dividing 1.49 × 10–7 moles by 0.0900L to obtain 1.66 × 10–6M. Phew. 
(e) This is the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, so the solution will be basic at the
equivalence point. The reason for this is that reaching the equivalence point involved the
formation of a salt, calcium benzoate in this case, or Ca(C6H5COO–)2. The benzoate anion of
this salt is slightly basic, so the equivalence point solution will be slightly basic.
2. (a) Reaction A is exothermic because ∆H°<0 and Reaction B is endothermic because ∆H°>0.
(b) Reaction A has a negative entropy change (∆S°), which means that the products are
more ordered than the reactants. This is consistent with the fact that Reaction A takes 4
moles of gas and converts it to 2 moles of gas. Reaction B has a positive entropy change,
which means the reactants are more ordered than the products. This is consistent with the
fact that Reaction B takes 1 mole of gas and converts it to 2 moles of gas. This also makes
sense qualitatively because Reaction A is a combination reaction and Reaction B is a
decomposition reaction.
(c) ∆G° = –33kJ for Reaction A and ∆G° = 26kJ for Reaction B. The Gibbs free energy change is
governed by the equation ∆G° =∆H° – T∆S°. Here the temperature must be in K, and because
they tell us that these reactions take place under standard conditions, we know that the
temperature is 25°C or 298K. Plug the given values of ∆H° and ∆S° into the equation for each
reaction to get your answers. Reaction A is spontaneous because ∆G°<0 and Reaction B is
nonspontaneous because ∆G°>0.
(d) As temperature increases in the equation ∆G° = ∆H° – T∆S°, the ∆G° for reaction A will
become nonspontaneous, because the negative entropy change makes the term –T∆S a pos-
itive quantity. Reaction B will become spontaneous.
319
Chapter 29: Practice Test One

(e) Keq= 1.6 × 10–6.To answer this question, you must use the expression ∆G = ∆G° +
2.303RTlogQ. At equilibrium, ∆G=0 and Q is the equilibrium constant, so the expression
becomes Keq = 10(∆G/(2.303RT). Plug in your known values, remembering to convert ∆G into
joules (form kilojoules), and you calculate Keq = 1.6 × 10–6. 
3. (a) Your two half-reactions must be. Cd2+ + 2e– →Cd and Sn2+ + 2e– →Sn. You must look up
their standard reduction potentials to determine which occurs at the anode and which at
the cathode. Cd2+ + 2e– →Cd has an E° of –0.40 and Sn2+ + 2e– →Sn has an E° of –0.14. The E°
for Sn2+ is the higher of the two so it is reduced at the cathode. This means that Cd must be
oxidized at the anode in the reaction Cd →Cd2+ + 2e–.
(b) The standard cell potential is calculated using the equation E°
cell = E°
red(cathode) – E°
red
(anode). Plug in the values you looked up in the table to get E°
cell = –0.14V – (–0.40V) = 0.26V.
(c) Be sure to label the anode, cathode, salt bridge, voltmeter, and the wire connecting the
anode and cathode (see Figure 29-5).
(d) Electrons flow from anode to cathode.
(e) The net ionic equation for this cell is Sn2+(aq) + Cd(s) →Cd2+(aq) + Sn(s).
(f) Use the expression ∆G° = –nFE°, where n is the number of moles of electrons exchanged
in the net ionic equation (2 in this case) and F is Faraday’s constant (96,500 C per mol e–).
This gives you a ∆G°of –2 × 96,500 × 0.26 = –50.2kJ

4. (a) (i) Your balanced reaction should be NH4Br(aq) + PbCO3(s) →(NH4)2CO3(aq) + PbBr2(s).
It is a relatively simple double replacement reaction as long as you have memorized your
solubility rules and charges of the polyatomic ions. Eliminating spectators (NH4
+), you
should be left with Br–(aq) + PbCO3(s) →CO3
2–(aq) + PbBr2(s).
(ii) Carbonates are generally insoluble except for those containing ammonium and alkali
metals so (NH4)2CO3 is soluble. Bromides are generally soluble except for those containing
Ag, Pb, or Hg, so PbBr2 is insoluble.
(b) (i) This is a simple combination reaction of the form 2Ca(s) + O2(g) →2CaO(s).
(ii) Pure elements have oxidation numbers of zero and oxygen has an oxidation number of
–2 in the compound because it assumes its usual –2 charge.
(c) (i) The complete combustion of any hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen alone will
lead to the production of water and carbon dioxide. This reaction follows the equation
2C6H14 + 19O2 →14H2O + 12CO2.
(ii) Nitrogen is also present in air and takes place in a combustion reaction, leading to the
addition of N2 among the reactants and NO2 among the products.
5. See Figure 29-6.
(a) The carbon in CO2 is sp hybridized while the phosphorous in PO4
3– is sp3 hybridized.
(b) The balanced reaction has the form CO2 + H2O →H2CO3. In this reaction, the oxygen on
the H2O donates the lone pair to form a coordinate covalent bond with CO2, so it is the
Lewis base and CO2 is the Lewis acid.
(c) No. The carbon-oxygen bonds of CO2 are polar because O is more electronegative than
C, and so the two oxygen atoms in CO2 pull the electrons in their covalent bonds with
carbon closer to them, leaving the oxygens with a slight negative charge and the carbon
with a slight positive charge. However, the linear geometry of CO2 opposes these polar
bonds such that they cancel out and the molecule as a whole is nonpolar.
(d) PO4
3– is tetrahedral, so the O-P-O bond angles are 109.5 degrees.
6. (a) Carbon dioxide has a higher solubility in water at a higher pressure. Opening a can of
soda lowers the pressure in the air in the headspace to 1atm and CO2 begins to escape the
solution.
(b) Heartburn and stomach upset are caused by an overproduction of stomach acid.
Medications designed to relieve these symptoms contain hydroxide in order to fuel a neu-
tralization of the stomach acid.
(c) No two atoms have the same available electron energy levels and since the colors emit-
ted by an excited elemental gas depend on the energy difference between those levels, no
two elements have the same emission spectrum.
(d) The two lone pairs on the oxygen atom of H2O repel the hydrogen bonds, bending them
downward slightly and changing the bond angles.

Answers to Practice Test Two
Multiple choice
1. (E). As a group IA metal (that is, an alkali metal), lithium exclusively forms a +1 cation, the
better to achieve a full valence shell.
2. (C). Although phosphorous has an oxidation number of +3 in PI3, phosphorous isn’t a metal.
In iron (III) sulfate, the iron metal ions each have +3 charge, offsetting the (3)(–2) = –6
charge brought by the sulfate anions.
3. (D). Although nitrogen has a +4 oxidation number in NO2, nitrogen isn’t a metal. In man-
ganese (IV) oxide, the manganese metal ion has +4 charge, offsetting the (2)(–2) = –4 charge
brought by the oxygens.
4. (D). As 2-carbon hydrocarbon (too short for branching) with the general formula CnH2n, C2H4
can only be an alkene, H2C = CH2.
5. (E). As the only listed hydrocarbon with an oxygen-containing functional group, C2H4O must
be an aldehyde. In this case, C2H4O has the structure H3C-CHO. 
6. (A). As 2-carbon hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n+2, C2H6 can only be an alkane,
H3C–CH3.
7. (C). As the only listed hydrocarbon with an amine-containing functional group, C2H5NH2
must be the amine. In this case, the compound has the structure H3C-CHNH2.
8. (B). As a 2-carbon hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n–2, C2H2 can only be an alkyne,
HC-CH.
9. (E). Although sigma bonding is completely symmetrical around the axis of a sovalent bond,
pi bonding is symmetrical about only a single plane through that axis, with overlapping p
orbitals above and below the plane. 
10. (A). In pure ionic bonding, electrons are entirely transferred from one atom or group to
another. Because the separation of charge is so complete, the bond is extremely polar.
11. (C). Metallic bonding is characterized by a lattice of positively charged metal atom nuclei,
around and through which migrates a “sea” of mobile electrons.
12. (D). Because the molar mass of NO2 is the greatest among the compounds listed, its rate of
diffusion is the smallest.
13. (B). Because the two atoms of molecular oxygen are identical, the bonds that connect them
are entirely nonpolar. This apolarity results in very weak interactions between O2 molecules.
14. (E). As the compound with the lowest molar mass among those listed, the average kinetic
energy associated with a given temperature and pressure derives more from velocity in the
case of CO than is the case with the other gases. Because kinetic energy — equal between
gases at the same temperature — equals (1/2)(mass)(velocity)2, the kinetic energy of the
other gases derives more from mass.
15. (D). Because the molar mass of carbon monoxide is 28.0g/mol, the 56.0g described repre-
sents 2 moles CO. At STP, 1 mole of (ideal) gas occupies 22.4L, so 2 moles occupy 44.8L.
16. (D). Typically, conjugate acid/conjugate base pairs include a common molecular “chunk,”
differing only in the presence or absence of an H+. In the given reaction, for example, H2O is
the conjugate acid of OH–, a conjugate base. However, the conjugate base of ascorbic acid,
C5H7O4COOH, is ascorbate, C5H7O4COO–.

17. (B). Doubling the concentration of X doubles the reaction rate, suggesting the reaction is
first-order in X. Doubling the concentration of W further quadruples the reaction rate, sug-
gesting the reaction is second-order in W. These observations suggest the rate law, 
Rate = k[W]2[X]. The overall reaction order is the sum of the individual exponents, 2 + 1 = 3.
18. (C). Dissociated ions are necessary to carry current through a solution. Although many of
the listed compounds are soluble in water, and a few dissociate into ions, only NaOH
strongly dissociates into ions when dissolved in water.
19. (E). The given electron configuration is most obviously that of the noble gas, krypton. All
the listed ions either shed or gain electrons to achieve the same stable, filled valence shell
as krypton. Selenium, though it might gain two electrons to achieve the given configuration,
is shown in its neutral, elemental form.
20. (E). Use the Henderson Hasselbach equation, pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]). The pKa of 4.76 is
1 pH unit lower than the desired pH of 5.76. So, the term log([A–]/[HA]) needs to equal +1.
This, in turn, means that the ratio of A– to HA must equal 10:1.
21. (B). On the reactant side, copper is shown in elemental form, so its oxidation number is 0.
On the product side, copper participates in the compound CuCl2. Because the oxidation
number of chlorine within compounds is –1, and because the compound has two chloride
anions, you know that the oxidation number of copper within the compound must be +2 to
offset the negative charge.
22. (E). The Roman numeral within parentheses alerts you to the fact that iron in this com-
pound has +3 charge. Next, recognize the sulfate anion, SO4
2–. Finally, find the right numeri-
cal combination of iron cations and sulfate anions to result in a neutral ionic compound:
Fe2(SO4)3. 
23. (D). Before finding the mass of nitrogen gas, you must find the number of moles. To do so,
first recognize that at 273K, one mole of an ideal gas (like N2) occupies 22.4L at 1atm. But
the given pressure is half that — so one mole of gas occupies twice that volume, which is 
2 × 22.4L = 44.8L ≈45L. So, you’ve got about one mole of N2 on your hands. The molar mass
of N2 is 28.0g.
24. (B). The four electron pairs represented by the two bound atoms and two lone pairs suggest
a tetrahedral geometry. Because only two of the four orbital axes include actual bonds to
actual atoms, the overall molecular shape resulting from the tetrahedral orbital geometry
is “bent,” just like water.
25. (C). The signs on the terminals of the voltage source clue you into the direction of electron
flow within this electrolytic cell. Electrons flow away from the negative terminal, down into
electrode 1, through the electrolyte solution and up through electrode 2 toward the positive
terminal. So, at electrode 1, Zn2+ cations are reduced by the flow of electrons, electroplating
solid zinc onto the electrode surface. 
26. (C). The key idea in a neutralization reaction is that the total moles of acid must equal the
total moles of base. So, you must provide enough acid to counteract (0.500L)(1.5M KOH) =
0.75mol KOH, where each KOH contributes a single OH–. Because each mole of H3PO4 con-
tributes three equivalents of acid, 0.25M H3PO4 effectively acts as 0.75M acid. Adding
1000mL (that is, 1.00L) of H3PO4 therefore neutralizes the base.
27. (D). This is a colligative properties question, requiring you to know that the more moles of
solute you dissolve into a given mass of water, the more you’ll elevate the boiling point.
Because iron (III) nitrate, Fe(NO3)3, dissociates into four ionic particles, the given concentra-
tion of that solute contributes the most particles and leads to the highest boiling point.
28. (D). All the listed statements are correct except for the statement about point Y, which
alters the energy level of an intermediate state. The equlibirium concentration of product
depends on the energy difference between initial (reactant) and final (product) states.
339
Chapter 30: Practice Test Two

29. (B). Lewis acids are electron acceptors, and Lewis bases are electron donors. The boron of
BF3 has two spots still empty in its valence shell. The nitrogen of N(CH3)3 has two available
electrons in a lone pair. So, the nitrogen donates its lone pair to the boron, creating a coor-
dinate covalent bond in a Lewis acid/base reaction.
30. (A). First, recognize that the free energy change for a reverse reaction has the same magni-
tude and opposite sign as the free energy change for the forward reaction. So, the free
energy change for the reverse reaction is +35.7kJ = +35700 J. Second, recall the following
relationship between the equilibrium constant and the free energy change:
This means that x = –(–∆G/RT) = –35700 / (8.314 × 273).
31. (C). Recall Graham’s law of diffusion and effusion: The ratio of the square roots of the molar
masses equals the inverse of the rates of effusion or diffusion. Because the ration of the
rates of effusion is 0.35, the ratio of the molar masses is (1 / 0.35)2 = 8.3. Helium has a molar
mass of 4.0g/mol. Solve for the molar mass of the unknown by multiplying 8.3 × 4.0g/mol =
33 g/mol.
32. (E). Choices A and B are both strongly polar because of the carboxylate/carboxylic acid
group. Choices C and D are both moderately polar because of the alcohol and ketone
groups, respectively. Choice E, an alkene, is simply nonpolar, and is therefore the least
soluble in water.
33. (B). To understand the redox reaction involved here, view the reaction as a net ionic equation:
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
Now you can see that the first and third listed standard reduction potentials are the rele-
vant ones. Because copper is more easily reduced than zinc (as revealed by its more posi-
tive standard reduction potential), you know that copper reduction occurs at the cathode
and zinc oxidation occurs at the anode. Finally, apply the equation for calculating a stan-
dard cell potential:
E0
cell = E0
red(cathode) – E0
red(anode) = 0.34V – (–0.76V) = +1.10V
34. (D). Methyl red has a pKa of 5.1, the closest to the target pH, and is therefore the most
suitable.
35. (B). With a mass number of 40 and 21 neutrons, the element in question must have 19 pro-
tons, and therefore an atomic number of 19. Unambiguously, then, the element is potassium. 
36. (D). Choice A is the balanced reaction equation. Choice E is the total ionic equation. But
only choice D is the net ionic equation.
37. (C). Percent composition is all about mass. The only formula listed in which the mass of
sulfur is 20% of the total mass of the compound is Cu2S. Choice E is a red herring, because
in that compound sulfur is 20% of the compound by atom count, not by mass.
38. (B). First, concentrate on the moles of H2S produced by the given reaction. The molar mass
of nickel (II) sulfide is 90.8g/mol, so 45.4g represents 0.500 mole of the compound. The stoi-
chiometry of the reaction tells you that you’ll therefore produce 0.500 mole of hydrogen sul-
fide. At standard temperature and pressure, 1 mole gas occupies 22.4L volume. One half of
that quantity is 11.2L.
39. (E). Ionization energy increases overall upward and to the right within the periodic table.
So, the element with the lowest ionization energy should hold the lowest, most leftward
position. Of those elements listed, cesium best fits the bill.
40. (C). To answer this question, you must know the formulas for the common compounds
listed, and you must be able to balance a reaction equation:
2C2H6 + 7O2 →4CO2 + 6H2O

Part VII: Measuring Yields: Practice Tests 

41. (D). Each compound listed shares a 4-carbon skeleton. In linear (not cyclic) compounds,
geometric (cis-trans) isomerism doesn’t occur about single bonds, so choice A is out. Both
butyne compounds create sp-hybridized carbons with purely linear geometry. Double
bonds are classic sites for cis-trans isomerism, but 1-butene is disqualified because one of
the carbons participating in the double bond is a terminal carbon attached to two identical
hydrogen atoms. So, only 2-butene, with its central double bond, offers the possibility of cis-
trans isomerism.
42. (C). This problem requires you to use the dilution equation:
C1 × V1 = C2 × V2
Because you add 400mL to 100mL, notice that your final volume is 500mL, not 400mL.
43. (E). To answer this question, you must remember the definition of the solubility product
constant. For the dissolution reaction XY(s) →X(aq) + Y(aq), Ksp = [X]×[Y]. Each of the
listed compounds undergoes simple dissociation to 2 counterions (Cu2+ and CO3
2– on the
one hand, Ba2+ and CrO4
2– on the other hand), [X] = [Y] in each case. So, the concentration
of either ion in a saturated solution is simply the square root of the Ksp. This fact rules out
choices A and B. The common ion effect rules out choice C. The given Ksp values reveal
that choice D is wrong. Thus, by process of elimination and because the math works out
properly, choice E is correct.
44. (E). Ionic compounds have neutral charge. Iron can take on variable charge, as Fe (II) cation
or Fe (III) cation. Sulfate anion has –2 charge. Hydroxide anion has –1 charge. So, all three
compounds are possible.
45. (B). To answer this question you must first generate a balanced reaction equation:
4CH4 + F2 →2C2H5Fl + 3H2
If 48g of CH4 react, then 48g / 16g / mol–1 = 3 moles methane react. Because only 2 moles of
fluoroethane product are made for every 4 moles of ethane reactant, the theoretical yield
of fluoroethane is 1.5 moles. The molar mass of fluoroethane is 48g/mol. So, the theoretical
yield of fluoroethane is 1.5 mol × 48g/mol = 72g. The actual yield is 48g. Percent yield =
100% × (actual/theoretical) = 66%.
46. (C). Remember to take bonds to hydrogen into account. Carbons 1 and 2 each have three
bond axes, and so are sp2 hybridized. Carbon 3 has four bond axes, and so is sp3 hybridized.
47. (D). Standard reduction potentials reflect ease of reduction. Tin (II) cation is most easily
reduced, and therefore is mostly likely to oxidize other atoms. So, tin (II) cation is the
strongest oxidizing agent listed.
48. (C). Equilibrium shifts to oppose any perturbation. At constant temperature, increasing
volume decreases temperature. So, the equilibrium shifts mass in the way that increases
pressure — in other words, it shifts to increase the total moles of gas. Because the reactant
side has 6 moles gas to the product side’s 3 moles of gas, equilibrium shifts to the left.
Choice A is wrong because lower pressures decrease gas-phase reaction rates. Choice B is
wrong because lower pressure favors the water vapor, not liquid water. Choice D is wrong
because the equilibrium shifts to the left for the reasons already described. Choice E is just
plain wrong.
49. (D). Because the compound is decribed as unreactive, choices A, B, and E are unlikely.
Choice C may or may not be true, but has little relevance to the observed increase in mass.
Hygroscopic compounds are those which interact so strongly with water that they absorb
water vapor from the air, thereby increasing the overall mass of the sample.
50. (C). Begin this problem with the Gibbs equation: ∆G = ∆H – T∆S. Plugging in the given values
for ∆G, ∆H and T, you can solve for ∆S, getting –5 J mol–1 K–1. Next, recognize that the tem-
perature at which the reaction moves from spontaneous to nonspontaneous is the one at
which the free energy change is zero, so plug in “0” for ∆G, plug in the values for ∆H and ∆S,
and solve for T. Doing so gives you 300K.

51. (A). Because pKa = –logKa, it follows that Ka = 10–pKa. Using this equation, solve for the acid
dissociation constant, Ka = 1 × 10–4. Next, remember that Ka × Kb = Kw = 1 × 10–14. Using that
fact, solve for the base dissociation constant, Kb = 1 × 10–10.
52. (E). For any wave, velocity = frequency × wavelength. For electromagnetic waves in air, veloc-
ity = 3.00 × 108 m/s. So, to solve for the frequency, simply divide 3.00 × 108 m/s by the wave-
length, 300. × 10–9 m. Doing so gives you 1.00 × 1015.
53. (D). Molality = (moles solute particles) / (kilograms solvent). Start by determining the moles
of NaCl present in the 292.3g sample. Using the molar mass of NaCl (58.45g/mol), this figure
comes to 5.00 moles. To achieve 2.5 molality, you require 2kg water.
54. (E). Segments 2 and 4 are flat with respect to temperature — though heat is added, that
heat goes into accomplishing the phase change of melting or vaporizing, not into increasing
the temperature of the sample. So, within neither of these segments does kinetic energy
(the underlying cause of temperature) change. Choice D is tempting because solid does
melt in segement 2, but segment 4 does not include gas expansion, but rather the conver-
sion of liquid at the boiling point into gas.
55. (C). All the statements are true except choice C. What remains constant is the sum of energy
between system and surroundings.
56. (B). Water has some pretty anomalous properties, including regions of its phase diagram in
which either increasing pressure or decreasing pressure could result in a change from solid
to liquid state. However, nowhere in the phase diagram does decreasing temperature (that
is, reducing the kinetic energy of molecular motions) cause a shift from solid to liquid.
57. (D). For most solid solutes, adding heat increases solubility. Adding acid increases calcium
hydroxide solubility by converting dissociated hydroxide ions into water. Choices B and C
could conceivably reduce solubility, but by far the best choice is D, because adding base
(that is, effectively adding OH–) reduces calcium hydroxide solubility by the common ion
effect.
58. (B). Descriptive chemistry at its finest. The conjugate base of a weak acid is a stronger base.
That is why the weak acid is weak.
59. (D). Use the ideal gas law for this one. Rearranged to solve for moles, n, the equation
becomes n = (PV) / (RT). Substituting in known values (and leaving R unsubstituted) gives
you (2.00atm × 100.L) / (300.K × R) = 0.667 / R.
60. (E). Boiling point, vapor pressure, and osmotic potential are all colligative properties, prop-
erties that change as solute is added to solution..
61. (B). Current equals charge divided by time (I = Q / t), so to solve for time, you must divide
the total charge by the current. There are 2.00 moles of charge, which means there are 2 × F
coulombs, or 2(9.65 × 104 coulombs). Divide this quantity by 2.00 amperes (2.00 coulombs
per second) to get 9.65 × 104 seconds.
62. (D). A neutral solution (pH = 7) emerges when total moles of base and total moles of acid
are equal. Each mole of sulfuric acid contributes two moles acid, so the original solution
contains (0.100L)(0.100mol L–1)(2) = 0.0200 moles acid. Using similar calculations on the
choices, you’ll find that the 50.0mL of 0.400M KOH offered by choice D does the trick.
63. (D). First, you must be able to construct the expression for the equilibrium constant of the
reaction: Keq = [C]2 / ([A]×[B]). Next plug in the known values for Keq, [A] and [C], and solve
for [B]. Doing so gives you 20.M.
64. (A). When diluting concentrated acid or concentrated base, always add the concentrated
compound to a large volume of water, and not the other way around. The dilution may gen-
erate a lot of heat, and by adding to the large volume of water, that heat can be adequately
dispersed.

65. (E). Temperatures and pressures above the critical point produce a supercritical fluid. 
66. (B). The question is asking about a mole fraction — that of helium within the final mixture,
to be precise. From the ideal gas law, you can calculate for the separate helium container
that the moles of helium, nHe = (2.0atm)(1.0L) / (RT). Second, you can calculate the moles
of carbon dioxide, nCO2 = (3.0atm)(2.0L) / (RT). Because each question shares RT, you can
set up the proportion (3.0 / nCO2) = (1.0 / nHe). In other words, there are three times the
moles of CO2 as there are moles He. So, the moles fraction of He = 1.0 / (1.0 + 3.0) = 0.25.
67. (D). Start by writing a balanced reaction equation
Zn(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) →2Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)
From the equation you can see that two moles of solid silver form for every mole of solid
zinc consumed. So, to produce four moles of solid silver required two moles of solid zinc.
Because each mole of zince has 65.4g mass, the two mole total has mass 131g.
68. (C). To attack this problem, you need to recall that
Rf = (sample mobility) / (solvent mobility)
Substitute in the known values of Rf = 0.36 and solvent mobility = 8.4cm, and you can solve
for the sample mobility, which is 3.0cm.
69. (C). Although many of the other compounds have polar covalent bonds, only ammonia has
a geometric distribution of bonds and a lone pair whose polarities don’t entirely cancel out.
70. (E). If the pH of the final solution is 7.0 (that is, neutral), then the moles of base added equal
the moles of acid originally present in the strong acid solution. The moles of base added
were (0.400L)(0.025mol/L) = 0.010mol OH–. Because acid must have been equal to base for
the final solution to be neutral, there must have been 0.010mol H+ in the original 0.100L acid
solution. In other words, [H+] = 0.010mol / 0.100L = 0.10M. This means that the pH of that
acid solution was pH = –log[0.10] = 1.00. Because pH + pOH = 14.00, you know that the pOH
of the acid solution was 13.00.
71. (D). You must know the formulas of these polyatomic anions (CrO4
2– and Cr2O7
2–) to figure out
the oxidation numbers of the metals. In each case, start with the oxygen atoms, each of which
carries an oxidation number of –2. In order to offset much of this negative charge while still
leaving a –2 formal charge, each chromium atom must carry on oxidation number of +6.
72. (D). Increased pressure can increase reaction rates as particles collide more frequently.
Increasing pressure perturbs the equilibrium, which shifts to create lower pressure. In the
case of the reaction shown, shifting toward products results in lower pressure because
the products contain fewer moles of gas than the reactants.
73. (B). Water molecules have the greatest degree of intermolecular attraction, particularly
from hydrogen bonding. Methane molecules lag far behind water in this respect, but can
still experience a small intermolecular attraction due to London forces. Of the three sub-
stances listed, the atomic noble gas helium has the fewest intermolecular attractions. All
other things being equal, the gas with the greatest attractive forces will have the greatest
tendency to contract, so achieving any given pressure (at a given temperature) will require
more molecules for that gas than for the others.
74. (A). Focus on the atomic number here — the mass numbers can only mislead you because
they may represent different isotopes of different elements. Alkaline earth metals are in
group IIA, and only atomic number 38, strontium, fits that bill.
75. (D). Alpha particles are helium nuclei, containing two protons and two neutrons. So,
a nuclide that decays by alpha emission loses four mass number units and two atomic
number units. By losing two atomic number units, the element is transformed into a
different element entirely. The new mass number is 238 – 4 = 234. The new atomic number
is 92 – 2 = 90. The new element is thorium, Th.

1. (a) pOH = 11.83. Make sure you understand the meaning of the Ka for this system by writing
down the acid dissociation reaction. If the common name, formic acid, doesn’t help you
with the structure, the systematic name, methanoic acid, should do so.
CHOOH  CHOO– + H+
Ka = ([CHOO–]×[H+]) / [CHOOH] = 1.80 × 10–4
Making a 0.25mol/L formic acid solution begins the process of acid dissociation, in which
some concentration, x, shifts from CHOOH form to equivalent concentrations, x, of each of
the dissociated forms, CHOO– and H+:

Substituting into the expression for Ka
Ka = (x2) / (0.25–x) = 1.80 × 10–4
This equation is a somewhat messy quadratic to solve under time pressure, and it is reason-
able to assume that, because formic acid is a weak acid, 0.25–x ≈0.025. So, the equation sim-
plifies to
1.80 × 10–4 = (x2) / (0.25)
Solving for x gives you 6.7 × 10–3 = x = [H+].
pH = –log[H+] = 2.17
pH + pOH = 14.00, so pOH = 11.83
(b) Percent dissociation = 2.6%. If the total concentration of formic acid and formate
together is 0.25mol/L, and the concentration of formate alone is 6.7 × 10–3 mol/L, then the
percent dissociation is
100% × (6.7 × 10–3) / (6.7 × 10–3 + 0.25) = 2.6%
(c) pH = 3.64. This is a buffer problem, for which you should use the Henderson-Hasselbach
equation:
pH = pKa + log([formate]/[formic acid])
To calculate the pKa: pKa = –logKa = 3.74
pH = 3.74 + log(0.20 / 0.25) = 3.64
(d) (i) Sodium formate. Maximum buffering capacity occurs when the conjugate base and
conjugate acid are present in equal concentrations. The initial concentrations are 0.20mol
formate / 2.00L = 0.10mol/L formate; 0.25mol formic acid / 2.00L = 0.13mol/L formic acid.
You must add enough solid sodium formate, CHCOONa, to result in 0.13mol/L formate,
CHCOO–.
344
Part VII: Measuring Yields: Practice Tests 

(ii) 11g sodium formate
(0.10mol + x mol) / 2.00L = 0.13mol/L formate
Solving for x gives you 0.16mol formate (added as sodium formate, 68.0g/mol)
0.16mol × 68.0g/mol = 11g sodium formate
2. (a) –1.41 °C. Freezing point and melting point are the same temperature. The normal melting
point of water is 0 °C, and adding solute lowers the freezing point.
(b) 0.758mol/kg
∆Tf = molality × Kf
Substituting in the known values gives you 1.41 °C = molality × 1.86. Solving for molality
gives you 0.758mol/kg.
(c) 90.1g/mol
Molality = (moles solute particles) / (kilograms solvent)
Because the compound is a nonelectrolyte, you needn’t worry that a mole of compound
dissolves into multiple moles of ionic particles. So, you can substitute in the known values:
0.758mol/kg = (moles solute) / (0.750kg water)
Moles solute = 0.569 moles
Because the chemist added 51.2g of the compound, you can calculate the apparent molar
mass as (mass solute added) / (moles solute) = 51.2g / 0.569 moles = 90.0g/mol.
(d) C3H6O3. Begin by determining the empirical formula. Assume a 100.g sample of the com-
pound. At the given percent composition, the sample will contain 40.0g carbon, 6.70g hydro-
gen, and 53.3g oxygen. Based on the gram atomic mass of each element, these values
correspond to 3.33mol carbon, 6.67mol hydrogen, and 3.33mol oxygen. Dividing all mole
values through by the smallest among them (3.33), you come to 1 mole carbon, 2 moles
hydrogen, and 1 mole oxygen. These values correspond to the empirical formula CH2O.
Next, divide the apparent molar mass of the compound calculated in part (c) by the molar
mass of the empirical formula: (90.0g/mol) / (30.0g/mol) = 3. The molecular formula of the
compound is a multiple of 3 times the empirical formula:
3 × CH2O = C3H6O3

(b) 8.1 × 103 coulombs. Use the equation Q = It (charge = current × time).
Charge = (4.5 coulombs/s)(1.8 × 103 s) = 8.1 × 103 coulombs
(c) 8.4 × 10–2 mol electrons. To calculate the moles of charge, you must use Faraday’s con-
stant: 96485 C/mol e–:
Moles of electrons = (8.1 × 103 coulombs)(1mol / 96485 coulombs) = 8.4 × 10–2 mol
(d) 4.2 × 10–2 mol gas per electrode. Based on the half-reactions shown for the electrodes in
part (a), 2 moles of electrons are required to liberate 1 mole of H2(g) and 1 mole of Cl2(g), by
reduction and exidation, respectively.
8.4 × 10–2 mol electrons × (1mol gas / 2mol electrons) = 4.2 × 10–2 mol gas
So, 4.2 × 10–2 mol gas are liberated at each electrode, for a total of 8.4 × 10–2 mol gas.
(e) 2.5L total gas. Again, start with Q = It, then convert to moles charge by using Faraday’s
constant, and then to moles gas by using the half-reaction equations (noting that 2 moles
electrons frees 2 moles gas, if you count both electrodes), and finally to volume of gas by
using 22.4L/mol.
(3.0C/s)(3.6 × 103 s)(1mol e–/96485C)(2mol gas/2mol e–)(22.4L/1mol gas) = 2.5L gas (total) 
(f) As the electrolysis continues, dissolved hydrochloric acid leaves the solution as H+ is
converted into H2 and as Cl– is converted into Cl2. Because the concentration of acid
decreases over time, the pH rises.

are ionized and unchanged on both sides of the reaction equation, they are omitted from
the net ionic equation.
(ii) A solid precipitate forms as the reaction proceeds. The precise colors of the iron (III)
sulfate solution and iron (III) hydroxide precipitate depend on their concentrations. The
iron (III) sulfate solution typically has a greenish color, whereas the iron (III) hydroxide
product would appear as a red-brown precipitate.
(b) (i) Ni2+(l) + 2Cl–(l) →Ni(s) + Cl2(g). Molten salts are liquid, not aqueous. All reactants and
products remain because each changes during the reaction.
(ii) During the course of this salt hydrolysis, solid nickel would deposit at the cathode and
chlorine gas would bubble from the anode.

change during the reaction.
(ii) During the course of the reaction, the metal oxide, initially a white powder, would dis-
solve into a clear aqueous solution and undergo the reaction shown in part (c). Although
magnesium hydroxide is only sparingly soluble, some hydroxide ion would dissociate into
solution. As the reaction progressed, the pH of the solution would progressively increase
due to the appearance of hydroxide ion product.
5. (a) Although atmospheric oxygen occurs at the surface of a deep body of water, two impor-
tant parameters change as you move to greater depths. First, the temperature decreases.
Second, the pressure increases. Decreasing temperatures increase the solubility of gaseous
solutes (like oxygen); at lower temperatures, the solutes have decreased kinetic energy and
are less able to disrupt the solute–solvent interactions that hold them in solution. At
increased pressures, gaseous solutes are more soluble in accordance with Henry’s law.
(b) The tendency of a solute to heat or cool a solution while dissolving is quantified by
the parameter, ∆Hsoln, the molar heat of solution. If this parameter is negative, the solute
releases heat into solution as it dissolves. If the parameter is positive, the solute absorbs
heat from solution as it dissolves. The physical basis for differences in heats of solution lies
in the collection of solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent interactions that
govern the dissolution process. If, in dissolving, an excess of enthalpically favorable interac-
tions must be disrupted, dissolution is accompanied by an absorption of heat — in other
words, by cooling. If, in dissolving, an excess of enthalpically favorable interactions
becomes available, dissolution is accompanied by a release of heat — in other words, by
heating. Even when dissolution is enthalpically unfavorable, it may nevertheless occur if it
is driven by entropic effects.
(c) Solid copper, Cu(s), participates in metallic bonding. Solid copper (II) chloride, CuCl2(s)
participates in ionic bonding. In metallic bonding, metal atoms pack into a crystalline lattice
in which the electropositive nuclei sit amidst a sea of mobile electrons. The electrons move
freely throughout the lattice because the energetic penalty for hopping from one nucleus to
the next is negligible. So, when motivated to flow by an applied voltage, the mobile elec-
trons do so. In ionic bonding, the crystalline lattice is composed of alternating ectropositive
and electronegative bonding partners. One partner releases electrons and the other partner
binds them. In order for electrons to flow under an applied voltage, the favorable electron-
electronegative partner interactions would have to be disrupted, which is unfavorable.

Ten Math Skills to Bring 
with You to the Exam
In This Chapter
 Concentrating on the most important concepts
 Listing key math skills
 Using tips and tricks to manipulate equations
I
f you think that you’re going to get away with doing chemistry and chemistry alone on
the AP exam, you’re sorely mistaken. Chemistry is a very mathematically oriented sci-
ence, and you will be asked to do a great number of calculations as well as applying chem-
istry concepts. Listed in this chapter are the ten most essential AP chemistry math skills
and some tips and tricks on avoiding errors. In particular, this chapter points out the skills
necessary to build a natural intuition for the correctness of your answers.
Dimensional Analysis/Conversion Factors
You’re guaranteed to use conversion factors, perhaps the most essential of all math skills for
the purposes of AP chemistry, several times on every AP chemistry exam. The purpose of a
conversion factor is just as its name implies — to change (convert) one unit to another. All
conversion factors have the same essential property — their numerator and denominator
are two different representations of the exact same quantity. For example, at STP 22.4L and
1mol of a gas are the exact same thing, so both the conversion factor 22.4L/1 mol and its
companion 1mol/22.4L are equivalent to each other and both equal to 1 because their numer-
ators and denominators are exactly equal quantities. So what’s the purpose of multiplying
something by 1? It allows you to manipulate units, getting rid of unwanted ones and bring in
the ones that the problem asks for. In general, you will place the unit you wish to get rid of in
the denominator and the one that you wish to change it to in the numerator of the conver-
sion factor.
pH and Logs
pH calculations are notoriously difficult even for a seasoned Chemistry student such as your-
self because they apply the difficult algebraic concept of the logarithm. It is essential that you
realize that pH utilizes a base ten logarithm, which is the reverse operation of raising ten to a
number. In other words, you can “undo” a logarithm by raising ten to both sides of a pH equa-
tion. This step leads you to the very useful formula 10–pH = [H+], which allows you to backsolve
from pH to [H+]. The other essential thing to realize about pH is that if the coefficient on the H+

concentration is 1, then the negative power of ten to which it is raised is equivalent to the pH
and no actual calculation is necessary. Also, any coefficient greater than 1 will have a pH
between its power of ten and one less than its power of ten. For example, a solution with [H+]
= 4.55 × 10–12 has a pH between 11 and 12. This knowledge can save you lots of time on multiple-
choice questions or on free-response questions with which you cannot use a calculator.
Isolating a Variable
Another essential algebra skill to bring with you to the exam is the ability to isolate a variable
in an equation. The AP exam provides you with a plethora of equations. However, it will be
up to you to isolate each variable that you need to solve for (i.e. get it “by itself” on one side
of the equation). We are not attempting to undermine your intelligence by pointing out this
seemingly trivial concept. There is a subtlety to this skill that many AP chemistry exam-
takers neglect — you are much more likely to get the correct answer if you isolate the vari-
able that you need to solve for before you plug any numbers in. This minimizes algebraic and
rounding errors, which can lose you points.
Significant Figures
After you get an answer on the AP exam, make sure that you provide the correct number of sig-
nificant figures in your answer. Here is a summary of the rules for assigning significant figures:
 Any nonzero digit is significant. Thus, 6.42 seconds (s) contains three significant
figures.
 Zeros sandwiched between nonzero digits are significant. Thus, 3.07 s contains three
significant figures.
 Zeros on the left side of the first nonzero digit are not significant. Thus, 0.0642 s and
0.00307 s each contain three significant figures.
 When a number is greater than 1, all digits to the right of the decimal point are
understood to be significant. Thus, 1.76 s has three significant figures, while 1.760 s
has four significant figures. We understand that the 6 is uncertain in the first measure-
ment, but is certain in the second measurement.
 When a number has no decimal point, any zeros after the last nonzero digit may
or may not be significant. Thus, in a measurement reported as 1370 s, we cannot be
certain if the “0” is a certain value, or if it is merely a placeholder. Be a good chemist.
Report your measurements in scientific notation to avoid such annoying ambiguities.
 Numbers resulting from counting (e.g., one kangaroo, two kangaroos, three kanga-
roos . . .) or from defined quantities (e.g., 60 seconds per 1 minute) are considered
completely certain. These values are understood to have an unlimited number of sig-
nificant figures, consistent with their complete certainty. 
 When taking the log of a number, as when calculating pH or pOH from [H+] or [OH–],
only the decimal portion of the answer applies toward the significant figure count
(not the preceding integer). For example, if [H+] = 0.0100M and pH = –log[H+], then pH =
2.000. Why? 0.0100 contains three significant figures. Therefore, the decimal portion of
the log answer (the mantissa) contains three significant figures. The preceding integer
(the characteristic “2” in this case) does not count toward the significant figure total.
352
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

The final thing to burn into your brain about significant figures is that your final answer should
always be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the least-precise number you
were given in the problem. However, do not round any of the numbers you are given until the
very end after you have plugged them into your equations in their full, precise glory.
Scientific Notation
You must be comfortable with scientific notation before taking the AP chemistry exam.
Remember that the coefficient for a number in scientific notation must be greater than one
and less than ten, that positive exponents mean very large numbers, and that negative expo-
nents mean very small numbers. Also, you must be able to properly add, subtract, multiply,
and divide numbers in scientific notation. Adding and subtracting is easily accomplished by
adding or subtracting the coefficients as long as the exponents of the two are the same. So,
you must adjust the values to have the same exponents before adding or subtracting. To mul-
tiply two numbers in scientific notation together, you must multiply their coefficients but add
their exponents. To divide, you must divide their coefficients but subtract the exponent of the
denominator from that of the numerator.
Percent Error, Percent Yield, 
and Percent Composition
The key percentage measurements in chemistry all have the exact same underlying concept:
Remember, “percentage” is just asking how many would you have if you had a hundred of the
total. Keep that in mind and you won’t get lost. Divide the portion under consideration by
the whole and you have the percentage you’re looking for. For percent errors, subtract your
result from the accepted value of the quantity (this value is the error in your measurement)
and then divide that by the accepted value. Percent yield is calculated in an equivalent way:
by subtracting the actual yield from the theoretical yield and then dividing by the theoretical
yield. Unsurprisingly, percent composition is also quite similar, though even simpler. Divide
the number of grams of each particular atom in one mole of a substance by its molar mass
and you have its percent composition. For all three of these quantities, remember that
your answer will be in decimal form so you will need to multiply by 100 to change it into
percentage form.
The SI System of Units
Make sure that you’re familiar with the SI system of units and, more importantly, have a
sense of the relative size of each one. This familiarity can go a long way toward honing your
intuition as to whether an answer seems to be about the right size based on what you know
about the problem. The five SI base units that you will need to do chemistry problems, as
well as their non-SI equivalents, are given in Table 31-1.

Metric System Prefixes
Nobody, not even a chemist, likes dealing with scientific notation if she doesn’t have to.
Metric system prefixes often appear in problems in lieu of scientific notation. For example,
the size of the nucleus of an atom is roughly 10 femtometers across, which is a nicer way of
saying 10 × 10–15 meters. The most useful of these prefixes are given in Table 31-2 below for
you to memorize.

Deducing Qualitative Trends from an Equation
It is important not only that you be adept at manipulating chemical equations, but that you
also understand their underlying meaning if you wish to do well on the AP chemistry exam.
In other words, when you look at an equation, you should always be thinking first and fore-
most about the relationship between variables. Are they inversely or directly proportional
(in other words, does one increase as the other decreases, or do they increase or decrease
354
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

together)? Recognizing trends like this can help you eliminate wrong answers in the multiple-
choice section more quickly and can help to hone your intuition for correct and incorrect
responses. A typical example is in solving for changes in ideal gas
If P1V1 = nRT1, then changing to new conditions gives you P2V2 = nRT2. 
The Greek Letter Delta
The delta symbol (∆) appears quite often in chemistry and always signifies that a quantity
has changed from an initial to a final state. It can be interpreted to mean “change in” the
variable that follows it. For example ∆T is the change in temperature from the initial to
the final state and can be written as Tf – Ti.

uring the course of the AP exam, you’ll be asked to answer a variety of types of chem-
istry questions. Some of these questions will be explicit and straightforward; in other
words, you’ll know for certain just what you’re being asked. Other questions will be implicit
and indirect; in other words, you’ll have to unpack the question to determine just what
you’re being asked. Whether explicit or implicit, no matter what clothes they wear, the
questions will fall into one or another of a limited number of categories. Here’s an overview
of those categories.
Periodic Table
Knowledge of the patterns of the periodic table is essential to do well on the AP chemistry
exam; both explicitly and implicitly, questions will require you to refer to this basic chemical
knowledge. Here are some of the contexts in which you might be called to consult the table:
 What is the subatomic composition of a particular atom?
 What is the ground state or excited electronic structure of an atom?
 What kind of compound, with what formula, will be formed if two elements react?
 Is a particular chemical species likely or unlikely?
 Will two compounds react or not?
 What kind of bond forms between the atoms of two elements?
 Is a particular atom likely to form an ion and if so, which ion?
 How many covalent bonds will a particular atom form?

Composition and Structure
Knowing the rules by which atoms assemble into compounds is key. Know how to do the
following:
 Determine a percent composition for a compound, given the compound’s formula
 Determine a compound’s empirical formula, given its percent composition (and a
molecular formula, given the compound’s molar mass)
 Move easily between compound names and formulas
 Given a compound’s formula, be able to
• Determine whether the compound is ionic or molecular
• Propose a likely covalent structure for a molecular compound, including possible
double or triple bonds, and draw its Lewis dot structure
• Propose a likely molecular shape, especially by using VSEPR principles
• Explain the polarity of a molecule with respect to molecular shape and bond
polarity
Solubility and Colligative Properties
Solubility is important because it can control the phases of reactants or products, and even
determine whether a given reaction is possible. Almost all soutions on the AP exam have
water as the solvent. Whether or not a substance dissolves in a given solvent is intimately
connected to the structure and properties of both the substance and the solvent. In other
words, be familiar with the following:
 How molecular structure, especially polarity, controls solubility and miscibility in
different solvents
 How temperature affects the solubility of solid and gaseous solutes
 How pressure affects the solubility of gaseous solutes
Different chemistry problems require you to use different units of concentration. Some
problems require you to convert between different units. So, you must be familiar with these
different units, when it is appropriate to use each unit, and how to calculate dilutions:
 Molarity: Moles solute per liter solution — by far the most used
 Molality: Moles solute particles per kilogram solvent
• To be used in colligative properties calculations
 Partial pressure of an ideal gas: Equals the mole fraction of the gas multiplied by the
total pressure
 Percent solution: Mass percent, ppm, ppb, and volume percent — relatively less
common
358
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Colligative properties, the properties of a solution that depend on the number of solute parti-
cles, vary with molality. Molality can be used to calculate three key properties with which
you should be familiar:
 Boiling point elevation
 Freezing point depression
 Molar mass of a solute
In addition, you should be able to describe the effects of added nonvolatile solute on the
vapor pressure of solvent over a solution.
Gas Behavior and Phase Behavior
Don’t enter the exam without knowing ideal gas behavior thoroughly and effortlessly. Here
are the key relationships that may crop up in questions:
 Charateristics of an ideal gas: For instance, molecules have no volume, molecules are
in random motion, molecules neither attract nor repel each other, molecules collide
elastically
 Meaning of gas temperature: As the temperature of a gas increases, the distribution of
kinetic energies of the particles gets broader, and the average kinetic energy increases.
 Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT, the most complete statement of ideal gas behavior — forget
this one at your peril.
 Combined Gas Law: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2, a useful combination of other laws that allows
you to calculate responses to changes in pressure, volume, and temperature
• Boyle’s Law: PV = k, which leads to P1V1= P2V2
• Charles’s Law: V/T = k, which leads to V1/T1= V2/T2
• Gay-Lussac’s Law: P/T = k, which leads to P1/T1= P2/T2
 Dalton’s Law: Ptotal=P1+P2...+Pn
 Graham’s Law: The ratio of the square roots of the molar masses equals the inverse of
the rates of effusion or diffusion
The same concepts of kinetic energy and particle motion (in other words, kinetic molecular
theory) that inform our model of gas behavior can also be used to help explain the move-
ment of substances between gas, liquid, and solid phases. Be comfortable with the following:
 The microscopic description of solid, liquid, and gas phases, especially as it relates to
particle motions and kinetic energy
 How the microscopic details of each phase correspond to macroscopic properties
such as density, viscosity, and heat capacity
 How molecular structure and interparticle forces (like dipole-dipole and dispersion
forces) factor into phase behavior, especially in condensed phases
359
Chapter 32: Ten Critical Types of Chemistry Problems

Stoichiometry and Titration
Knowing the numerical relationships between reactants and products is the starting point for
countless questions. So, be sure you can do the following:
 Balance reaction equations
 Use balanced reaction equations to construct conversion factors
 Move easily between units of moles and other units (mass, volume, and particles)
 Apply balanced reaction equations to determine the identity of a limiting reagent and
calculate the theoretical, actual, and percent yield of a reaction
 Apply knowledge of stoichiometry to acid-base reactions, especially in accounting for
acid/base equivalents within titration reactions
 Make predictions about whether a given titration reaction is at its equivalence point
(equal amonts of acid and base reaction according to H+ + OH–  H2O)
 Move easily between molar concentrations of acid or base and related quantities of pH,
pOH, Ka, Kb, and Kw
 Understand the concept of a buffered solution, when buffered solutions are effective,
and be able to use the Henderson-Hasselbach equation
Equilibrium
The concept of equilibrium is core to understanding how chemical systems respond to
change, and it figures prominently in a large percentage of questions. Here are some of the
ways in which equilibrium might rear its head:
 Determine the direction in which a given reaction will shift, in response to the following
• increasing or decreasing the concentration of a reactant
• increasing or decreasing the concentration of a product
• increasing or decreasing temperature
• increasing or decreasing pressure or volume
 Given concentrations of reactants or products, calculate an equilibrium constant and
vice versa
 Using an equilibrium constant or a reaction quotient and the concentrations of reac-
tants or products to
• Determine whether a system is at equilibrium
• Determine the direction in which a nonequilibrium system will proceed
 Manipulate equilibrium constant expressions and values for coupled equilibria and for
forward versus reverse reactions
 Apply equilibrium concepts to questions of solubility and acid-base behavior, espe-
cially with respect to Ksp, Ka, Kb and Kw
360
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Thermodynamics and Thermochemistry
Thermodynamics deals quantitatively with differences in energy between reactants and
products and states of substances, and thermochemistry deals specifically with thermal
energy transfer as heat during chemical reactions. Reaction equilibrium can be predicted
from knowledge of thermodynamic parameters enthalpy and entropy. Both of these topics
are fundamental to chemical change. Have a solid grasp on the concepts and calculations
associated with them.
 Move easily between equilibrium concentrations and the free energy change for a
reaction by using ∆Go = –RT ln Keq. and for nonequilibrium conditions using ∆G =
∆Go–RT ln Q.
 Understand the interrelationships of free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and temperature in
determining the spontaneity of a chemical reaction
• Know and be able to use the Gibbs equation, ∆G = ∆H – T∆S
• Be able to connect the concepts of enthalpy and entropy with behavior at the
atomic and molecular level such as bonding and motion
 Understand and be able to differentiate the concepts of heat capacity, molar heat
capacity, and specific heat capacity
 Be able to apply the concept of heat capacity and calorimetry to reactions in which
heat is released or absorbed, especially by using q = mC∆T
 Apply Hess’s Law to coupled systems of chemical reactions and determine a missing
quantity from a Hess’s Law cycle
Kinetics
Just as a grasp of thermodynamics is key to understanding spontaneity, having a grasp of
kinetics is key to understanding the rates of reactions. Knowing one concept without the
other is like walking on one stilt — you go nowhere and you fall down a lot.
 Understand the concept of reaction rate and how questions of rate differ from questions
of equilibrium
 Given a set of experimental data, be able to formulate and use rate laws and understand
the distinct roles of
• Rate constants
• Reactant concentrations
• Reaction orders
 Be able to apply the concepts of molecularity, elementary steps, and rate-determining
steps to the mechanism of a chemical reaction
 Interpret reaction energy diagrams with regard to the kinetics and mechanism of a
reaction
 Understand the concept of activation energy, Ea, and be able to apply it to questions of
rate, especially by using the Arrhenius equation
361
Chapter 32: Ten Critical Types of Chemistry Problems

Redox and Electrochemistry
Charges can change during chemical reactions, and when they do, they become critical play-
ers, altering the stoichiometry and energetics of the reaction. Oxidation-reduction reactions
and electrochemistry are must-know categories for the exam, especially with respect to the
following skills:
 Determining the oxidation number of all atoms in a balanced reacton equation and
using those numbers to determine
• Whether or not a given reaction involves redox
• The identity of both oxidizing and reducing agents
 Decomposing redox reactions into oxidation and reduction half-reactions
 Using half-reactions to balance overall redox reaction equations (under acidic and
basic conditions)
 Applying redox chemistry to electrochemical and electrolytic cells in order to
• Determine the identity of anodes, cathodes
• Determine the direction in which electrons and ions flow
• Determine if and and at which electrode electroplating occurs
• Calculate standard cell potentials, especially with regard to standard reduction
potentials of half-reactions, electrical current and the Faraday, and free energy
changes under standard conditions
• Calculate cell potential under nonstandard conditions from concentrations and
the standard cell potential by using the Nernst equation
Descriptive and Organic Chemistry
These topics are sometimes given short shrift in general Chemistry classes, but that doesn’t
mean they’ll be absent from the AP exam — up to one-sixth of the material will test this infor-
mation directly or indirectly. Be sure to focus on these items:
 Given the reactants, make reasonable predictions about the products of the most
common kinds of reactions, to include
• Single and double replacement/displacement
• Synthesis/combination and decomposition
• Combustion
 Be familiar with scenarios most likely to result in
• Precipitation
• Gas release
• Redox
• Formation of a colored compound
362
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

 Be able to move easily between the names for organic compounds and their structures,
to include
• Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes
• Cyclic and aromatic compounds, including existence of isomers and resonance
structures
• Geometric isomers
• Compounds with functional groups, including halides, alcohols, ethers, and
carboxylic acids
 Be able to make reasonable predictions about the properties of simple organic
compounds (such as solubility, volatility, and reactivity)
 Be familiar with common organic reaction types, to include substitution, condensation,
hydrolysis, addition, and elimination

Ten Annoying Exceptions 
to Chemistry Rules
In This Chapter
 Putting all the annoying exceptions into one corral
 Handling exceptions more easily with tips and tricks
E
xceptions seem like nature’s way of hedging its bets. As such, they’re annoying — why
can’t nature just go ahead and commit? But nature knows nothing of our rules, so it
certainly isn’t going out of its way to annoy you. Nor is it going out of its way to make things
easier for you. Either way, seeing as you have to deal with exceptions, we thought we’d
corral many of them into this chapter so you can confront them more conveniently.
However, one big caveat! This chapter is at the end for a reason. Don’t get so hung up on the
exceptions that you don’t master the basics properly. Many AP students lose points on the
exam because they omit describing the basic principles that underlie the exceptions. It is
not enough to only understand the exceptions without quoting the “normal” rules or trends.
Hydrogen Isn’t an Alkali Metal
In the field of psychology, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs declares that people need a sense of
belonging. It’s a good thing hydrogen isn’t a person because it belongs nowhere on the peri-
odic table (which we describe in Chapter 3). Although hydrogen is usually listed atop Group
IA along with the alkali metals, it doesn’t really fit. Sure, hydrogen can lose an electron to
form a +1 cation, just like the alkali metals, but hydrogen can also gain an electron to form
hydride, H–, especially when bonding to metals. Furthermore, hydrogen doesn’t have metallic
properties under normal conditions, but typically exists as the diatomic gas, H2.
These differences arise largely from the fact that hydrogen has only a single 1s orbital and
lacks other, more interior orbitals that could shield the valence electrons from the positive
charge of the nucleus. (See Chapter 7 for an introduction to s and other types of orbitals.)
Another factor is that H+ is a bare proton with extremely compact charge density.

The Octet Rule Isn’t Always an Option
An octet, as we explain in Chapter 5, is a full shell of eight valence electrons. The octet rule
states that atoms bond with one another so as to acquire completely filled valence shells
that contain eight electrons. It’s a pretty good rule. Like most pretty good rules, it has
exceptions:
 Atoms containing only 1s electrons simply don’t have eight slots to fill. So, hydrogen
and helium obey the “duet” rule.
 Certain molecules (like NO, for example) contain an odd number of valence electrons. In
these cases, full octets aren’t an option. Like people born with an odd number of toes,
these molecules may not be entirely happy with the situation, but they deal with it.
 Atoms often attempt to fill their valence shells by covalent bonding (see Chapter 5). Each
covalent bond adds a shared electron to the shell. But covalent bonding usually requires
an atom to donate an electron of its own for sharing within the bond. Some atoms run
out of electrons to donate, and therefore can’t engage in enough covalent bonds to fill
their shell octets. Boron trifluoride, BF3, is a typical example. The central boron atom of
this molecule can only engage in three B–F bonds, and ends up with only six valence elec-
trons. This boron is said to be electron deficient. You might speculate that the fluorine
atoms could pitch in a bit and donate some more electrons to boron. But fluorine is
highly electronegative and greedily holds fast to its own octets. C’est la vie.
 Some atoms take on more than a full octet’s worth of electrons. This is known as an
expanded octet. These atoms are said to be hypervalent or hypercoordinated. The phos-
phorous of phosphorous pentachloride, PCl5, is an example. These kinds of situations
require an atom from period (row) 3 or higher within the periodic table. The exact rea-
sons for this restriction are still debated. Certainly, the larger atomic size of period 3
and higher atoms allows more room to accommodate the bulk of all the binding part-
ners that distribute around the central atom’s valence shell.
Some Electron Configurations 
Ignore the Orbital Rules
Electrons fill orbitals from lowest energy to highest energy. This fact is true.
The progression of orbitals from lowest to highest energy is predicted by an Aufbau diagram.
This isn’t always true. Some atoms possess electron configurations that deviate from the
standard rules for filling orbitals from the ground up. For Aufbau’s sake, why?
Two conditions typically lead to exceptional electron configurations:
 First, successive orbital energies must lie close together, as is the case with 3d and 4s
orbitals, for example.
 Second, shifting electrons between these energetically similar orbitals must result in a
half-filled or fully filled set of identical orbitals, an energetically happy state of affairs.
Want a couple of examples? Strictly by the Aufbau, but not by the “energy” rules, chromium
should have the following electron configuration:
[Ar]3d44s2
366
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Because shifting a single electron from 4s to the energetically similar 3d level half-fills the 3d
set and lowers the energy, the actual configuration of chromium is
[Ar]3d54s1
For similar reasons, the configuration of copper is not the expected [Ar]3d94s2, but instead is
[Ar]3d104s1. Shifting a single electron from 4s to 3d fills the 3d set of orbitals.
Strictly speaking, the above arguments only apply to isolated atoms. Once the atom is involved
in bond formation in a compound, the whole energy level scheme has to be re-examined, and
apparent filling order may change again.
Flip to Chapter 5 for full details on electron configurations and Aufbau diagrams.
One Partner in Coordinate Covalent Bonds
Giveth Electrons; the Other Taketh
To form a covalent bond (as we explain in Chapter 5), each bonding partner contributes one
electron to a two-electron bond, right? Not always. Coordinate covalent bonds are particularly
common between transition metals and partners that possess lone pairs of electrons.
Here’s the basic idea: Transition metals have empty valence orbitals. Lone pairs are pairs of
nonbonding electrons within a single orbital. So, transition metals and lone-pair bearing mol-
ecules can engage in Lewis acid-base interactions (see Chapter 17). The lone-pair containing
molecule acts as an electron donor (a Lewis base), giving both electrons to a bond with the
metal, which acts as an electron acceptor (a Lewis acid). When this occurs, the resulting mol-
ecule is called a coordination complex.
The partners that bind to the metal are called ligands. Coordination complexes are often
intensely colored and can have properties that are quite different than those of the free metal.
All Hybridized Electron Orbitals 
Are Created Equal
Different electron orbital types have grossly different shapes. Spherical s orbitals look noth-
ing like lobed p orbitals, for example. So, if the valence shell of an atom contains both s- and
p-orbital electrons, you might expect those electrons to behave differently when it comes
to things like bonding, right? Wrong. If you attempt to assume such a thing, valence bond
theory politely taps you an the shoulder to remind you that valence shell electrons occupy
hybridized orbitals. These hybridized orbitals (as in sp3, sp2, and sp orbitals) reflect a mixture
of the properties of the orbitals that make them up, and each of the orbitals is equivalent to
the others in the valence shell.
Although this phenomenon represents an exception to the rules, it’s somewhat less annoying
than other exceptions because hybridization allows for the nicely symmetrical orbital geome-
tries of actual atoms within actual molecules. VSEPR theory presently clears its throat to point
out that the negative charge of the electrons within the hybridized orbitals causes those equiv-
alent orbitals to spread as far apart as possible from one another. As a result, the geometry of
sp3-hybridized methane (CH4), for example, is beautifully tetrahedral. However, this is messed
up easily once total symmetry is upset. CH3I is no longer a perfect tetrahedron. Sigh.
Check out Chapter 7 for the details on VSEPR theory and hybridization.

Chapter 33: Ten Annoying Exceptions to Chemistry Rules

Use Caution When Naming Compounds
with Transition Metals
The thing about transition metals is that the same transition metal can form cations with dif-
ferent charges. Differently charged metal cations need different names, so chemists don’t get
any more confused than they already are. These days, you indicate these differences by
using Roman numerals within parentheses to denote the positive charge of the metal ion. An
older method adds the suffixes –ous or –ic to indicate the cation with the smaller or larger
charge, respectively. For example
Cu+ = copper (I) ion or cuprous ion
Cu2+ = copper (II) ion or cupric ion
Metal cations team up with nonmetal anions to form ionic compounds. What’s more, the
ratio of cations to anions within each formula unit depends on the charge assumed by the
fickle transition metal. The formula unit as a whole must be electrically neutral. The rules
you follow to name an ionic compound must accommodate the whims of transition metals.
The system of Roman numerals or suffixes applies in such situations:
CuCl = copper (I) chloride or cuprous chloride
CuCl2 = copper (II) chloride or cupric chloride
Chapter 7 has the full scoop on naming ionic and other types of compounds.
You Must Memorize Polyatomic Ions
Sorry, it’s true. Not only are polyatomic ions annoying because they must be memorized, but
they pop up everywhere. If you don’t memorize the polyatomic ions, you’ll waste time trying
to figure out weird (and incorrect) covalent bonding arrangements when what you’re really
dealing with is a straightforward ionic compound. Here they are in Table 33-1.

Liquid Water Is Denser than Ice
Kinetic molecular theory, which we discuss in Chapters 9 and 11, predicts that adding heat
to a collection of particles increases the volume occupied by those particles. Heat-induced
changes in volume are particularly evident at phase changes, so liquids tend to be less dense
than their solid counterparts. Weird water throws a wet monkey wrench into the works.
Because of H2O’s ideal hydrogen-bonding geometry, the lattice geometry of solid water (ice)
is very “open” with large empty spaces at the center of a hexagonal ring of water molecules.
These empty spaces lead to a lower density of solid water relative to liquid water. So, ice
floats in water. Although annoying, this watery exception is quite important for biology.
No Gas Is Truly Ideal
No matter what your misty-eyed grandparents tell you, there were never halcyon Days of Old
when all the gases were ideal. To be perfectly frank, not a single gas is really, truly ideal.
Some gases just approach the ideal more closely than others. At very high pressures, even
gases that normally behave close to the ideal cease to follow the Ideal Gas Laws that we dis-
cuss in Chapter 9.
When gases deviate from the ideal, we call them real gases. Real gases have properties that
are significantly shaped by the volumes of the gas particles and/or by interparticle forces. 
Common Names for Organic Compounds
Hearken Back to the Old Days
Serious study of chemistry predates modern systematic methods for naming compounds.
As a result, chemists persistently address a large number of common compounds, especially
organic compounds, by older, “trivial” names. This practice won’t change anytime soon.
A cynical take on the situation is to observe that progress occurs one funeral at a time. A less
cynical approach involves serenely accepting that which you cannot change and getting
familiar with these old-fashioned names. Table 33-2 lists some important ones; head to
Chapter 25 for details on organic compounds.
