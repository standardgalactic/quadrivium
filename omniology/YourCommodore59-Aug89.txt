 984 -  the year o f the ﬁrst un-
tethered spacewalk, Carl Lewis takes
four gold medals in the Summer
Olympics, Desmon Tu tu  wins the
Nobel Peace Prize, and Commodore
introduce the Plus/4 computer. Al l
right, so maybe the advent of the Plus/
4 did not have quite the same impact,
but its arrival did create something of
a stir in the microcomputer world. The
magazine Your Computer described
the machine as a "QL-Basher" and
suggested that the Plus/4 could replace
the ABC Micro in school and business
because of the powerful CBM BASIC
V3.5 and the integrated business
software. Unfortunately, these ambi-
tious claims were not to be fulﬁlled.
In recent times the Plus/ 4 has lost the
support of most software houses, and
has sadly slipped into relative obscur-
ity. Even so, the Plus/ 4 did have
considerable, if short-lived success in
both the U K  and, perhaps more
importantly, i n  Germany and the
USA. I was convinced myself of how
many people are still using the machine
by responses to a bug which appeared
in a program o f mine published in
Your Commodore last year. I received
numerous letters from as far as the
States a n d  H o l l a n d , a n d  w a s
impressed by how many people had
actually had a go at solving the bug,
rather than justing writing for help.
Although largely forgotten b y the
software industry, the Plus/4 is still
far from dead, ﬁve years after its
conception, and now i t has ﬁnally
received the recognition it deserved, in
this form -  an area of the magazine
set aside soley for the Plus/4 compu-
ter, and the name - FourGround!
Aims of The Series
When I  was approached b y  Your
Commodore to write this series on the
Plus/ 4 I accepted immediately -  the
Plus/4 is simply the most friendly,
useable machine I  have ever come
across and has been disregarded for
far too long. However, when I started
to think of some ideas to write about,
I realized the enormous job I had taken
on. The fact is that the Plus/4 excels
in so many things, and has so many
different uses from business to games
PLUS/4 +
playing that it is hard to target any
one area of interest. If I conﬁne myself
to machine language programming I
may alienate the Basic-only pro-
grammers, and o f course I  mustn't
forget those who use their Plus/ 4
mainly fo r  playing games. I  have
therefore selected a number of aspects
of the Plus/ 4 which I consider to be
deﬁnitive of the computer, and intend
to cater for as many diverse interests
as possible. If demand is high enough,
I would also be happy to run a "Plus/
4 Problems" type section. If you have
any ideas, suggestions, questions o r
requests, please write to  me at the
address shown at the end of the article.
If you require a reply, please do include
an S.A.E.
Having got the introductions over,
I thought that this month rather than
leaping straight into a new topic, we'd
take a look at what the Plus/4 offers.
What follows is a brief overview o f
the Plus/4 system, and an inventory
of those features of the Plus/ 4 which
will be covered in this space in future
issues o f the magazine. Because the
Plus/ 4 has so much to offer, the less
obvious aspects of the computer are
often forgotten. This month's overview
should act as a memory refresher and
a taster of subjects for future coverage.
An Overview Of The
Plus/4 Computer
The Plus/ 4 computer has essentially
three modes o f operation -  running
Basic programs, running the built-in
business software, and running com-
mercial or the user's own machine-code
programs. The dialect o f Basic pro-
vided with the machine is not the C64's
old Basic V2.0 which goes back to
CAM PET and VIC-20 days, but is
a far improved version 3.5. The main
difference is the provision o f  com-
mands to handle graphics and sound,
which had to  be performed using
endless strings of POKEs on the Plus/
4's big brother, the C64. In addition,
it is possible to write far more elegant
and structured programs in Basic 3.5
because of the DO...LOOP structures
omitted i n  the earlier versions o f
Commodore Basic. The set of graphics
commands included are as complete
a collection as can be found on any
computer. Basic 3.5 also offers com-
prehensive "house-keeping" facilities
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989

Plus/4 Past and Present...
By Mark Everingham
like program renumbering and auto-
matic line numbering which along with
a set of eight redeﬁnable function keys
make programming in Basic simplicity
itself. Commodore's enhanced full-
screen editor found o n  the Plus/ 4
means that prototyping o f  screen
displays is easy, and program editing
fast and reliable. Although Plus/4
Basic is not the speediest language
known, its importance and usefulness
should not be underestimated. By its
use of ROM/ RAM paging, Basic can
use the full 64k R AM o f the Plus/
4 computer. However, arguably the
most useful aspect of Basic 3.5 is that
it offers unique routines which allow
the machine-code programmer to
easily add new commands to the Basic
language. This means that there should
never be any need to use unfriendly
POKEs and SYS calls. Unfortunately,
like so many o f the Plus,' 4's other
features, the extension of Basic does
not seem to be documented in any
books or manuals, so you can expect
a full expose in the coming months.
The second major mode of Plus/
4 operation i s i ts built-in "3 +1 "
business software: the integrated word-
processor, spreadsheet, database and
graph software. Too often this aspect
of the Plus/4 is totally disregarded, yet
while the software is a bit spartan, it
is useable and with a little ingenuity
it can be made to perform a wide range
of extra functions due to  Commo-
dore's generous use of RAM-vectors.
I shall be presenting in FourGround
programs which overcome the lack of
word-count, copy quantity when
printing, apostrophe conversion as
well as providing more complex
functions such as control-code han-
dling and facilities for the insertion of
screen pictures into documents just like
the graphical word-processors availa-
ble on the Amiga.
By far the most interesting and
powerful aspect o f  the Plus/ 4 i s
machine-code, otherwise known as
Machine Language or Assembly Lan-
guage. Because of the Plus/ 4's built-
in machine-code monitor TEDMON,
the Plus/ 4 is the perfect machine on
which to learn machine language. The
7501 Processor in the Plus/4 is easy
to learn and powerful in its simplicity.
The inclusion of a Kernel ROM in the
Plus/ 4 makes device handling, disk-
drive access and printer control easy
to grasp. Machine language regretta-

bly has a certain stigma attached to
it. having gained the reputation of a
language beyond the reach of normal
mortals. This is not the case machine-
code can be simple and rewarding to
use. The problem is usually a  bad
method o f  teaching, so I  shall be
presenting a readable, easily under-
stood introduction to this fascinating
aspect of Plus/ 4 computing some time
in the future.
Of course, possibly the most
important aspect of Plus/ 4 machine-
code is correct use of the TED chip
which replaces the VIC chips found
in the older CM and VIC-20 machines.
The TED chip is a complex graphics/
sound handling chip which offers a host
of features:
High-resolution Text; Multi-colour

so many features that while
most people understand
the basic principles,
they do not appreciate
just how versatile
even the simplest
funciton can
be when used
in unconven-
tional
ways.
As an
example,
try
entering
this listing. On
running the program, a set of
concentric rings will be drawn and then
the screen should begin to ﬂash wildly.
Now depress the [SHIFT-LOCK] key
- Not something you'd normally do
when running a program. Immediately
you should see the chaos resolve into
a pattern of colours gliding effortlessly

up the background o f  the screen;
amazing when you consider that the
whole special effect is being produced
by just three Basic commands and
not a spot of machine-code in sight.
So how does the program work? If you
stop the program and type GRAPHIC
1 you'll see a pattern of black and white
rings, but in GRAPHIC 3, the same
pattern becomes different colours in
the Multi-color mode. Normally,
switching between the two screens just
causes the display to ﬂicker. Depress-
ing the [SHIFT-LOCK] key, or hold-
ing down any other key makes the
Plus/ 4's interrupts run a bit slower as
the keyboard is scanned. This in turn
brings the speed of ﬂicker down to a
rate close to the TV picture updating
speed, resulting in the rolling colours
effect. OK, so it's really just a gimmick,
but from the obscure use of a simple
function, we've learnt something about
graphics modes, keyboard scanning,

interrupt handling and T V  Picture
Handling (or the ubiquitous Raster).
It is often unconventional little pro-
grams like this which teach you the
most. So, if you have any interesting
short programs, send them in!
To complement such Plus/4-
speciﬁc subjects, I  should like t o
include features on computing pre-
viously not tried on the Plus/4, but
fully within its capabilities: Simple
artiﬁcial intelligence and strategy
programming for example. Another
subject th a t you can be sure o f
coverage i n  the near future is the
mandelbrot set and the whole ﬁeld of
fractal and chaotic maths. This exhi-
larating new area o f computing has
usually been conﬁned to the Amigas
and PCs o f  the world, b u t some
beautiful effects can be achieved with
incredibly simple Basic programs on
the Plus/4, with its 121 colours adding
a whole new dimension to the subject.
The Plus/ 4, as I  have tried to
demonstrate by this brief overview has
a wide scope of ability for any interests.
I hope I have whetted your appetite
for things to come. Next month we'll
kick o ff with something a bit more
substantial. Remember, this section of
the magazine should be for you the

New Fonts For Lasers
I  f you can own a HP or IBM laser
printer for use with your computer,
then the price o f new font cartridges
has probably put you off buying new
fonts for the printer. Now C.Itoh is
offering a new range of font cartridges
that are compatible with IBM and H P

same price as the "real" cartridges, but
offer twice as many options. C.Itoh
are also willing to make quotes for
people who want their own fonts on

The font library consists o f  12
cartridges, all ideally suited fo r use
with C.Itoh's C-I 5 printer and scanner.
Once a  picture o r design has been
scanned or merged with text, the whole
effect can be maximised b y  using

about to become twice as good!
That's the claim of Image Works as
it adds the ﬁnal touches to its game
Bloodwych, which allows two players
to control two parties while exploring
the same 3 D  castle. The castle i n
question is crawling with monsters to
slay, tunnels to explore and mysteries
to solve, and also hides four crystals
that together offer the choice to banish
evil or make it prevail forever.
A horizontal split screen will keep
the two parties apart and allow them
to explore the castle at their own speed,
but they are sure to meet somewhere
in the darkness.
Adventurers will be able to explore
the world of Bloodwych on the Amiga
from the end of July, and then later

T
program is not all that hard. If
you've got a fair grasp of the
language you're using and know your
computer quite well, you'll get some-
thing written pretty quickly. But then
comes the laborious bit: testing and
debugging!
This gets more difﬁcult and more
confusing the larger and more complex
your program becomes. A  computer
program can easily develop into a
gigantic jigsaw puzzle, and every bit
has to ﬁt exactly! A  computer is a
machine, and the machine has n o
mercy. You either get it right or you
don't. If you don't, the machine will
repeat the same kind of nonsense ten
times, a hundred times, a thousand
times. Computer novices (and often
programmers, who really should know
better) when confronted with a bug,
operate the program ten or 20 times
in the vain hope that the computer will
do it right eventually. But it never does!
A far more sensible approach is to
get some good debugging tools. Com-
modore Basic has no debugging tools
at all. So, in the next few articles in
this series on extending the Basic of
your CM. I'd like to develop a few
of those. Once you know how Basic
works in Rom, this becomes easier
than you might think! Let's start with
a trace routine.
PROGRAMMING
Extending
Basic
Make your life easier by adding a trace routine to
Commodore Basic.
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
All About Tracing
Tracing gets activated once the pro-
gram starts to execute, that is, after
you've given the Rom command.
Before each line (or part of a line, i f
it is a multistatement line) is inter-
preted and executed, the computer is
stopped and the trace routine, which
we will develop, prints the number of
the line to be executed and its contents
at the top of the screen,
To continue execution, just press
any key - this results in the line being
executed as usual. Then the computer
jumps to the next line, prints that one
at the top of the screen, stops again
and so on. The usefulness of all this
is that you can see exactly where in
the program the computer is at all
times. This i s also called single-
stepping a  program, because that's
exactly what the computer is doing.
Normally, things happen so quickly
that you barely have time to consider
what exactly is going on. Tracing or
single-stepping gives you the chance
to take it step by step and think things
through.
Stopping the C64 in Its
Track
We intercept the normal program ﬂow
right at the beginning of our extended
Basic routine before we look for an
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
13
extended Basic command (lines 490-
510). At this point, the accumulator
contains the ﬁrst letter of the extended
Basic command or the token code, if
it is an ordinary Basic command. Since
we need that later on, we save it on
the machine stack. Then we call the
trace routine itself (lines 1360-320).
First we test the system variable
$9D, which tells us whether we're in
program execution mode o r  direct
mode. I f  the computer i s i n  the
program mode, $9D contains zero,
otherwise it contains 128. We want to
know this, because if we've just given
a Basic command direct, we obviously
don't need the trace facility to  be
activated. Therefore, we exit straight
away from the routine (line 1430),
recover the former contents o f the
accumulator from the machine stack
(line 510), and continue as usual.
Plotting
Next, we need to save the current print
position, because i f  the program
outputs text or graphic characters to
the screen, we want them afterwards
to be output to  the proper print
position.
By the way, I've only bothered to
save the current print position and
recover i t  later on. To  make this
program more functional, I advise you
to save the screen colours too and print

the tracing line in a way which makes
it stand out nicely. As always, I leave
these ﬁner points to you!
To save the current print position
and initiate our own, we use a Rom
routine, called "Plot". If Plot is entered
with the carry ﬂag set, the current print
position contained i n  the system
variables $D6 and $D3 is put into X
(across) and Y (down).
If Plot is entered with the carry ﬂag
clear, the value contained i n  X  is
initiated as the new print column and
the value contained in Y is initiated
as the new print line. This knowledge
should make it easy for everybody to
develop an "AT" function, something
sadly lacking in Commodore Basic! In
lines 1470-1500, we use plot to save
the current print position in 251/ 252,
and in lines 1540-1570 we initiate the
top line of the screen as the new current
print position.
Next, we print an 80 characters-
long empty string to clear the top two
lines o f the screen (lines 1610-1630).
For this we use a Rom-routine which
prints any string, as long as it doesn't
exceed 256 characters and is termi-
nated w i th  a  zero. T o  point the
computer to the string we want to
print, we put the low byte of the start
address of the string in the accumu-
lator and the high byte into Y. I've
decided to clear two lines, to accom-
modate a Basic line of any length.
Then we reset the current print
position back to the beginning of the
top line (lines 1670-1700). Printing the
line number, which is the ﬁrst thing
we want to do, is also very easy: the
number o f the line the computer is
interpreting at present is contained in
the system variable $39/ 3A. To print
that number, we use a Rom-routine
which prints any number if the accum-
ulator contains the low byte o f the
number, and X its high byte.
Next, we print a separating space,
using the easiest-to-use o f all Rom-
routines. With this one, you simply
load the character to be printed into
the accumulator and call the routine.
You don't have to save any registers,
because this routine saves everything,
including the accumulator which
contains the character to be printed,
before it does its work and recovers
everything again, (with most other
Rom-routines you have to take care
of this yourself!).
By the way, both the above routine
and th e  Printstring routine also
PROGRAMMING
execute so-called "non-printable"
characters, such as carriage returns,
backspace, cursor movements and so
on. Just put the appropriate ASCII
code (not the Commodore code!) into
the accumulator or the string you want
printed, and it does it.
Basic Token Codes
In past articles, I have already men-
tioned that Commodore compresses
(or "tokenized", as the computer
jargon goes) Basic keywords. One
advantage of this is that it makes Basic
textﬁles more compact and thus saves
memory. It also tells the computer very
easily when it has to deal with a Basic
keyword and when it doesn't. A token
code is always larger than 128, while
an ordinary letter or number is smaller
than 128. To put it differently, with
a token code, bit 7 of the eight bits
of a byte (counted from 0 to 7) is set,
while with an ordinary ASCII code it's
clear.
Of course, this means that a Basic
keyword has to be tokenized before
the line is entered into the textﬁle, and
every time the line is reprinted on the
screen each token has to be expanded
into the keyword it stands for. When
interpreting the program, the compu-
ter just uses the token code, and never
expands it, because computers, unlike
human beings, are far happier just to
deal with numbers, rather than English
words.
To expand token codes, there is a
list in Rom of all Basic keywords. This
list starts at location $A09E. Since all
Basic keywords are of various lengths,
the programmers of the Commodore
Rom separated each keyword from the
next one by adding, once again, 128
to the last letter. Therefore, to print
the last letter correctly, one has to
subtract 128 from it.
Instead of this method, the Commo-
dore whizkids could have used another
method to build this table - they could
have padded each keyword that's
shorter than a  certain length with
spaces or zeros. This would have made
it much easier to jump from entry to
entry. But it would also have used up
much more memory. That's why they
went for the former solution.
To expand and print token codes
we use a subroutine (lines 2660-3200),
because there may be several token
codes in one line or line segment. This
is because Basic tokenizes not just
commands, but also functions. It also
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
14
tokenizes arithmetical operators, like
"+" and "-". The reason for this is again
to make them stand out clearly from
other characters in the line.
Expanding and printing a
token
When we enter our subroutine, the
token code is the accumulator. First,
we subtract 128 from the code to get
the actual number o f the keyword.
This we load into X, which will serve
us as the counter (lines 2660-2680).
Next, we load the base address of the
keyword table ($A09E) into a zero
page address so we can use indirect-
Y later on. I  use zero page $61/ 62,
which i s the ﬁrst location o f  the
ﬂoating point accumulator. I t  i s
completely safe to do this here, since
we won't use the ﬂoating point accum-
ulator (lines 2720-2750).
Now we enter the main loop, which
starts by testing X. If it contains zero,
we have found the keyword we were
looking for. This is because we use X,
which contains the number o f  the
keyword, to count backwards. With
every pass through our main loop, we
decrement X by one. (lines 2790-2810)
If we haven't found our keyword
yet, we zero Y and enter TOKENLP1
(lines 2850-2900). This loop tests each
character of the next keyword to ﬁnd
the last character, which has 128 added
to it. I f  it has found that character,
the carry ﬂag will be set. In the ﬁnal
part of the main loop (lines 2940-3010),
we update the base address contained
in $61/ 62 so that i t points a t the
beginning of the r..!xt keyword. This
is done by adding the contents of Y
(the index) to it.
Once we have found the right
keyword, it's printed onto the screen,
again each characer being tested to
ﬁnd the last character (lines 3050-
3110). When this has been found, 128
is subtracted from its value and it too
is printed (lines 3160-3180).
Tying it all up
The rest of our trace routine is pretty
simple.
Lines 2410-2440 reinstate the former
current print position.
Finally, a Rom-routine called "Getin"
is used to , wait fo r any key being
pressed (lines 2480-2490). If no key has
been pressed, the zero ﬂag is set.
Otherwise zero will be clear, because
Getin returns the ASCII code of the

PROGRAMMING

key which has been pressed in the
accumulator.
As always in this series, I haven't
done things as comprehensively as they
could have been -  I  justify this by
saying that I want to encourage you

Autoroute
Tony Heatherington discovers a unique new
pathﬁnding system that could make life easier for
tourists and travelling salesmen everywhere
A / l
to read, making it easier for
you to plan your journey.
But how often has the place you've
been aiming for been obscured by a
fold or a staple? How often have you
tried to ﬁnd your way around ''pro-
posed motorway routes", or stared at
your map trying to ﬁnd a path around
some particularly heavy roadworks or
locate a place to stop and eat on the
way? Wouldn't it be good if you could
use a computer to plan your routes
by simply typing in where you wanted
to go? Such a system is no longer
conﬁned t o  the realms o f  science
ﬁction - it already exists.
Autoroute fro m N e xt Base i s
available i n  several forms, ranging
from the basic Autoroute up to the
new Autoroute Plus and its add-on
modules. All you need to run it is a
PC with either twin ﬂoppies or a hard
disk drive, as a detailed map of Britain
eats up memory more than anything
else.
Using Autoroute couldn't be easier
- all you have to do is type in your
starting location and your destination.
If you misspell either place, o r  i f
Autoroute isn't sure where you mean,
it displays a menu of options to choose
from. That sounds easy enough, but
the real power comes when you can
add u p  to  20 stops o n  the route,
establish the time you'll be travelling,
specify road types you prefer or would
rather avoid, and rate the speeds you
travel at somewhere between 2Cv and
GTi.
Autoroute then uses this informa-
tion to calculate a series of routes, and
rates them as quickest or shortest using
you to choose the best option (the ﬁrst
is usually the quickest and the shor-
test). You can then display a map of
the route and a table of directions.
The map varies in quality depend-
ing on your graphics card, is functional
in C GA  and impressive i n  EGA.
Through a series of key presses and
a mouse pointer you can identify
unmarked roads, zoom in and out of
PC F E A T U R E
the map and increase or decrease its
detail. In fact you can ﬂood the display
with so many place names that it's
impossible to see the route.
Pressing the space bar takes you
to the table or list of directions that
you can print out and bring with you
in the car. These directions tell you
which turnings to take, the distance
from the last junction, the direction
you're heading in and even the time
at which you should reach it.
Although this is ideal for a nav-
igator t o  read, i t  would be very
dangerous for a driver to refer to such
crammed print while in motion, so it's
a shame there isn't an option to print
the directions in easy to read double-
sized print that you could clip onto
the dashboard.
Unlike a static map, Autoroute can
respond to exceptional circumstances.
For example, in bad weather you could
tell it to avoid B roads where possible,
and on Bank Holidays to steer clear
of packed motorways. Similarly, you
could compensate fo r major road-
works and other hazards that might
slow your journey down.
As if that isn't enough, Next Base
has just released an updated version
of Autoroute, with added features and
modules, that's logically called Auto-
route Plus, Auto Plus retains the same
easy route-planning structure, b u t
adds new features and options. For
example, by clicking on the map you
can dodge a speciﬁc stretch of road
to avoid road works, a snarl up or an
accident, or ﬁnd the nearest pub, hotel
or branch of your business.
You can also specify the time you
need to reach your destination at, and
Autoroute Plus will plan your journey
accordingly. Say, for example, you
wanted to travel from Newport on the
isle of Wight to Bristol, and travel via
Bournemouth. Southampton and
Winchester, but reach Bristol for a
meeting at 3PM. Autoroute Plus does
the rest, caluclating and displaying that
you must leave Newport at 11 am to
arrive a t Bournemouth a t 12:22,
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
18
- -
Southampton at 12:57 and Bristol at
3pm. Try working that lot out on a
normal road map.
Both the map and the table o f
directions can he printed o u t o r
exported as PCX ﬁles and used in DTP
packages, so you could tell all your
customers where your shop is and
include a map and directions of how
to get to it in the same document as
your latest price list and details o f
special offers. Similarly, you could use
it to ﬁnd sales or exhibitions, ranging
from the PC Show at Earl's Court
down to a car boot sale at the local
school.
Autoroute Plus is an open-ended
system that can be updated and further
expanded through a series of modules.
These incLude a  Gazetteer Editor,
Postcodes and optimisation and cost-
ing systems. For the general user the
Gazetteer shows most promise, as it
allows you to add places of interest

to the Autoroute maps. The examples
supplied are pubs and hotels, but you
could add anything from distributors
to branches and software houses to
customers.
For each entry, you can compile
a small text entry that appears when
the location is selected by mouse. For
example, clicking on the software
house in Staines would reveal some-
thing like... Next Base, authors o f
Autoroute and Autoroute Plus and its
expansion modules. Tel: 0784 460077.
Fax 0784 460582.
That's not all -  the Gazetteer also
allows you to add detailed departure
and arrival instructions th a t are
incorporated into the table so that
people will always know how to ﬁnd
you.
The postcodes module includes the
location of the centre of each o f the

Autoroute and Autoroute Plus will
have many users, ranging from com-
puter users wanting to impress family
and friends, to  travelling salesmen,
clubs organising events and small and
not-so-small businesses. It will run on
most PCs, but becomes really useful
when loaded into a portable that can
be used while you're in the car.
The basic Autoroute costs f  130,
which is quite reasonable considering
the mass o f data i t stores and pro-
cesses. Autoroute Plus is aimed more
at the professional user, and carries
a E299 + V A T price tag, with the
modules costing between f:149 and

I
may be considering changing your
machine for an Amiga, or another
16 bit machine. However, you may still
be confused as to what's available, or
the Amiga may n o t be the right
machine for you. What are the alter-
natives? The Atari ST is one, but you
could also consider getting a  PC
compatible. This might seem a strange
choice, b u t settling fo r what has
become the de facto industry standard
does in fact make a lot of sense. An
explanation of why you should take
such a course is necessary, so I will
attempt to make clear both the pros
and cons in this article.
The IBM Standard
The term IBM PC compatible refers
to a  hardware standard, that is a
machine which has certain minimum
speciﬁcations. These are: an 8088 8/
16bit CPU running a t a  speed o f
4.7Mhz, a minimum of 64k RAM, a
video card capable o f displaying at
least 80x25 rows o f  text, and one
double-sided 40 track disk drive with
360k capacity. To  be fully compati-
ble with the IBM standard, the ROM
chips inside the machine should also
be the same as IBM's,
You may wonder how manufactur-
ers have survived the threat of legal
action from one of the world's biggest
companies. The answer is, only at their
indulgence, b y n o t making copies
directly arid by using a technique called
'reverse engineering'. Even basic items
such as printer ports are not part of
the spec. However, one o f the great
advantages o f the standard is that a
large number of expansion slots come
in the basic machine, so you can buy
almost anything, and just plug it in.
Don't worry i f you're not quite sure
COMMODORE PCS

Commodore has joined just about every other computer
manufacturer and started producing PC Clones. We
start a regular column for Commodore PC owners.
what all this means - everything should
become clear as you read on.
MSDOS
Also called PCDos o n  true I B M
machines, MSDos is the heart of a PC
compatible. Without it, you cannot do
anything at all.
MSDos is usually loaded fro m
disk, but some portables, for example,
have a version in ROM. MSDos is
responsible for handling all input and
output, This means the screen, printer,
keyboard or disk drive. The software
that does all this is usually loaded once,
at switch on and then resides in the
machine until it is switched off. The
other part o f MSDos is made up of
a number of Transient commands. Of
these, by far the most important is
Command-corn, the so-called com-
mand processor. This program is like
the Basic interpreter, in that it sits in
memory intercepting your keypresses,
and turning them into something the
computer can understand.
All MSDos commands are given
from a prompt which initially consists
of just the disk drive Letter, and a >
symbol eg;
A: >  o r  C: >
This can be changed to suit your
needs to show the date, for example.
Here you will do most work, launch-
ing programs, formatting disks, and
keeping track o f  Data. Typing the
built-in command DIR at this prompt
will reveal what's on disk. Fig.]. shows
the directory listings o f the MSDos
system disk. You will see that ﬁles on
the disk all have up to eight letters,
then a dot (.) followed by an extension
of up to three letters. How a ﬁle is
treated by MSDos depends on these
letters. EXE or COM after the dot
means a program that will run from
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
20
the A: > prompt. BAT tells MSDos
that the ﬁle is a text ﬁle which can
be treated as a list of commands. One
of these .BAT ﬁles, Autoexec.bat is
special, because it executes automat-
ically on startup. This means you can
set your machine up to suit you, in
the knowledge that every time you
switch it on, it will be the same.
The other important thing to
understand about MSDos is that it is
a hierarchical ﬁling system, and so
within one directory you can have not
only ﬁles, but more directories, and
so on. Organising ﬁles this way is
essential i f you have a hard disk, of
which more later.
Programming the PC
The surprising thing about PC com-
patibles is they almost never have Basic
built into them. Instead Basic comes
as just another program that can be
run. GWBasic is generally accepted as
the standard here and comes with most
machines. An interpreted language, it
is generally considered t o  be well
featured and easy for beginners to get
to grips with, but it is slow. However,
numerous languages are available, and
if you wish to program professionally
you should consider one of the many
compilers available. Assembly lan-
guage programming i s also well
catered for, both commercially, and in
the public domain. PCs do of course
have the BATCH language built into
them. This is very simple, but expe-
rienced batch language programmers
can do some surprising things with it.
Software
Upwards of one million packages have
been written for the machine, and this
number is growing all the time. All
the big software houses write for the

COMMODORE PCS
PC, and some packages such as Lotus
123, DRase III, and Wordperfect are
standards in their own right. Stand-
ards are high, but be warned, unless
you have an expensive machine cap-
able of running Windows, most soft-
ware is still text-based. The quality of
games software can be variable with
only the more recent stuff for EGA
graphics adaptors being really excit-
ing. This will improve as more soft-
ware houses take to the PC. Public
domain and shareware is available in
large quantities, so even the impecun-
ious will ﬁnd something to meet their
needs.
Graphics
Probably the most perplexing aspect
of PCs is that of graphics and display
adaptors. Unfortunately there is no
single standard, and of those which do
exist there are many variations. Also,
many programs such as Aldus Page-
maker require a minimum conﬁgura-
tion before they will run. In Pagemak-
er's case an EGA adaptor and colour
monitor are required before it will run.
The problem has arisen because,
in the beginning the display standard
was 80x25 text in monochrome. Only
later did provision fo r colour and
graphics arise. Al l  PC's come with
some kind of graphics adaptor, usually
on a plug-in card and a monitor, so
it is important to get the right display
for your needs. The following list
should give an idea of what's availble.
The list shows just how desirable
some combinations can be.
The drawback however is cost.
With a suitable VGA setup costing as
much or more than most low cost PC's,
many users have to settle for some-
thing less. If you can afford it, I would
suggest an EGA to be the best over-
all value for money.
What to look for when
buying a PC
Thankfully, modern PC compatibles
far exceed the speciﬁcations of their
ancestors. You should expect memory
of 512 or 640K.

10Mhz is advisable. For those with
ample cash, an A T  class machine
which uses the fast 80286 processor
could be acquired. Serial and parallel
ports should be built in and at least
two or three expansion slots should
be available.
As Personal Computers are disk
based, a  minimum o f  two 360k 5
I / 4 inch, or one 720k 3.5 inch drive
should be included. Hard disks are
cheap in the PC world, and are really
worth the money at about 200 pounds
for 20Mbytes.
Check also what software is bun-
dled with the machine. An integrated
package such as Ability, o r Works
could be all you need for the ﬁrst six
months or so.
Conclusion
PC compatibles are a safe option. You
won't ever set the world alight with
one, but at the same time nobody is
going to laugh at you for getting one.
A very wide range o f  price and
performance is covered, so the chances
are there will deﬁnitely be one to match
your budget.
Commodore have a range typical
of many manufacturers, ranging from
budget 8088 machines, to fast 80386's
with huge amounts o f memory and
disk storage.

C128 PROGRAMMING
Reasoning
on the 128
The ﬁrst part of a series
that may help you turn
your humble 128 computer
into an expert system
By Paul Schoﬁeld
'
very little Al software available for
Commodore Machines. One likely
reason for this phenomenon is that
many people have been given the
impression that A t applications can
only b e  programmed i n  ei ther
PROLOG o r  LISP. Whilst these
languages are certainly very good tools
for this type of application, it's quite
feasible to employ almost any pro-
gramming language. A  second prob-
lem is that Al applications tend to be
very data intensive, and the combina-
tion of limited memory and slow disks
is somewhat restrictive.
Despite this, examples of modern
Al techniques are used in many CM
adventure games, some o f  which
feature quite sophisticated natural
language processors. In this article we
will look at another application area,
the Deterministic Expert System. All
the programs are written entirely in
Commodore Basic 7.0, but allow quite
a wide range of simple Expert Systems
to be created. Before looking at the
ﬁrst program, however, it's quite
natural to  look a t the features o f
traditional A l  tools and the typical
applications of expert systems.
PROLOG
PROLOG is quite unlike Basic and
other popular computing languages.
Whereas traditional programming
languages are concerned with arith-
metic calculations, P R OL OG i s
• • • • • -
dri
designed to tackle problems by logical
deduction. The language contains two
basic types of statement. The ﬁrst type
is used t o  establish relationships
between data items, which are then
used to create a so called Knowledge
Base. The second type of statement is
then used to interrogate the Knowl-
edge Base to  determine answers to
particular problems.
The great power of PROLOG is
that it doesn't need to understand the
relationships deﬁned. For example, if
a restaurant wants to organise its menu
to avoid dishes that include out o f
season fruits and vegetables, they can
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
22
use statements like:
expensive (strawberries, january).
This condition can then be tested by:
? — expensive (strawberries, january).
to which PROLOG will answer YES.
Not very exciting, but if strawberries
is replaced b y a  variable, then it's
possible to look at all things which are
expensive in January.
LISP
LISP stands for LISt Processor, and
can perform similar types of operation,

but in this case all the conditions must
be presented in the form of a list. The
language provides operations fo r
moving through the list structure, and
taking different paths according to the
value of individual elements in the list.
For a typical Al  application a LISP
list looks rather bewildering, with
many layers o f nested brackets used
to deﬁne the hierarchy o f sub-lists.
However, this approach is conceptu-
ally simpler, as each list element at the
lowest level is an English language
statement.
These are the questions the user is
asked and the user's responses (TRUE
or FALSE) determine the next list
element presented. ICPUG members,
who are interested i n  LISP should
request disk CL15 from the C128
library, which contains a Cl PM Mode
Lisp Interpreter. Be warned though,
you won't get very far without a text
book. Alternatively, you can ﬁnd quite
similar facilities within the CM Logo,
together w i th  a  very incomplete
example o f Knowledge Base on the
Utility Disk.
What's an Expert
System?
While the two favourite languages of
the Al  community can provide many
useful clues, it's also useful to look at
the basic concept of an Expert System.
As the name suggests, the best way
to start is to ﬁnd someone with a lot
of experience of tackling a complex
problem. You then spend a good deal
of time asking them to run through
how they approach the problem step
by step.
This will highlight a sequence o f
questions they ask o r  tests they
perform, and h o w  they proceed
according to the results obtained. It's
a well-known fact that all AI Engineers
have ve ry unreliable cars, a n d
although mine has proved very reli-
able, this is still quite a good place
to start.
There are a very large number of
problems, which can conspire to insure
that you're n o t getting optimum
performance from your car. For most
of us, the most serious problem is when
the car won't start, and so this should
be the ﬁrst consideration o f  our
computerised car maintenance expert.
The easiest way is if it asks:
CAR WON'T START?

analysis o f  this problem, otherwise
other problems are considered. If we
consider just the case of the car not
starting, w e now investigate the
simplest reasons ﬁrst, so as to minimise
the amount o f  work involved i n
isolating the cause of the problem. The
next question is likely to be:
FUEL TANK IS EMPTY?
and if this is not the case,
BATTERY IS FLAT?
A negative response at this point
will lead to  a series of questions to
trace through the fuel and electrical
systems. Car maintenance is a good
example o f  a  deterministic expert
system, because it clearly demonstrates
the two big advantages o f an expert
system:
1. A guide through the steps to analyse
a problem
2. Ultimately identiﬁes a solution.
Fuzzy Logic
The part of this example we've looked
at so far works very nicely, as it's quite
simple to answer TRUE or FALSE
to each question. If we proceed a little
further, we will encounter the question:
IS SPARK GOOD ON ALL PLUGS?
We can easily tell whether there is
a spark, but how do we know i f it's
adequate? Much research is currently
being done into fuzzy logic. As there's
no measurable divide between a good
and inadequate spark, a probability is
associated with the measured value
within the critical range, and can be
used in conjunction with probabilities
for other components to  give an
assessment of whether the combina-
tion works.
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
23
At this stage we now have a non-
deterministic expert system, which
can't give a deﬁnite answer, just the
most probable answer. As most home
motor mechanics would have n o
means o f  accurately measuring the
strength of the spark, these niceties can
be ignored, and the somewhat impre-
cise question employed. This falls in
rather nicely w i th  the L IS P  l i st
approach.
REASON 128
REASON 128 is an interactive Expert
System tool which enables you to
create, modify, save and interrogate a
moderately sized knowledge base. It
utilises the fact that almost all knowl-
edge bases can be represented as a
simple tree structure.
This representation greatly simpli-
ﬁes the problem o f  constructing a
Knowledge Base, as each statement
need only be associated with two
pointers to the next statement to be
displayed, according to whether or not
the previous one was TR U E  o r
FALSE. This is of course a doddle in
Pascal or C, as it's just a matter of
deﬁning records to create a binary tree.
It can also be achieved very simply in
basic using three arrays.
Designing a Knowledge
Base
The design o f  a  Knowledge Base
requires two things:
1. some knowledge of the subject (e.g
text book).
2. a large sheet of paper.
The reference text provides the
information on the question/tests and
eventually the conclusions and the
paper are used to arrange them in a
tree structure.

Let's move on now out o f  the
garage and into the chemistry lab. At
the back of a shelf we ﬁnd an unla-
belled bottle containing a clear liquid.
This could be water, sulphuric acid,
caustic soda or countless other things,
and it would be nice to know which
one i t  is. T o  keep this example
reasonably short, well only consider
tests related to the acidity or alkalinity
of the liquid.
We can do very simple tests using
litmus to determine whether it's acidic
or alkaline, and also make a subjective
analysis o f these tests. This can be
deﬁned in terms of four questions and
ﬁve conclusions, with these arranged
into a simple tree structure as shown
in Figure 1. If we get a positive result
to test I, we can ignore the righthand
half of the tree and proceed to question
2. Th e  answer t o  this results i n
conclusion 3 or 4.
Working with REASON
128
Once you have a tree diagram like the
one in Figure 1, you're ready to use
REASON 128. Run program one, and
a list of six options is displayed. Select
1 to create a new Knowledge Base. This
will then prompt for the ﬁrst question
to be asked. Type in the text string
you wish to be displayed, and press
RETURN. I t  then prompts for the
next questions to be asked, according
to whether the answer was TRUE or
FALSE. When you reach the end of
a branch, these are entered as 0 to
indicate that this is a conclusion rather
than a question.
When you've entered all statements
on your tree, type t o  the next

prompt and you will then be asked if
you want a hard copy of the Knowl-
edge Base. This is in the format shown
in Figure 2, and is useful both as a
check, and for future reference if you
wish to make any changes. You're then
returned to the main menu.
At this point it is advisable to use
option 3 to save the Knowledge Base
to disk. If you don't have a Formatted
data disk, use option 5 ﬁrst, when a
Knowledge Base has been saved, it can
be reloaded using option 2 . It's
important to note that the Save routine
adds the extension ".KB", and this part
of the ﬁlename should not be speciﬁed
when using load.
Finally, option 4 is used to inter-
rogate your Knowledge Base. Just
keep answering T(rue) or Raise) to the
questions until REASON highlights its
conclusion.
Problems and Limitations
For reasonably small applications,
you'll ﬁnd REASON 128 both efﬁcient
and easy to use. For more complex
applications, however, i t  i s often
difﬁcult to construct a complete tree
at the outset. It can also mean that
you have to use an identical question
at several parts of the tree, thus wasting
valuable data space.
For such applications, it would be
much nicer to  have a  system that
allowed you to  deﬁne just the fact
which you knew about possible solu-
tions. Later in the article, we'll look
at three programmes that create such
a system. You'll still ﬁnd REASON
useful, as such systems frequently
produce multiple solutions. REASON
can help in developing the extensions
to eliminate these and improving the
efﬁciency of the data structures.
Playing Games
Although REASON was designed
primarily for setting up and interro-
gating simple tree structures, it need
not be limited to  such applications.
One quite interesting area is repetitive
applications that can occur in many
simple games. Figure 3 is a listing of
the REASON knowledge base for a
Noughts and Crosses system. Like
many such games, the strategy is
complicated only fo r  the opening
moves, after which i t  i s simply a
repetition of a very simple set of rules.

Have you ever been stuck for words while writing a
letter or document? Then perhaps THESAURUS can
help _you
By Norman Hart
A
program's function is to pres-
ent groups o f  words w i th
similar meanings, derived from an
alphabetically presented list. A l l
procedures are menu driven, so even
if you don't possess great typing skills,
mistaken entries are impossible.
The database is sorted out in such
a way that searches are unnecessary;
the results of your enquiries are derived
directly from the array in memory, and
arc displayed instantly on the screen
- time after time. The program is of
course crash-proof, w i th  [R U N  i
STOP-RESTORE] your only means
of escape.
How it works
The program begins by POKEing an
alphabetical sort into location 49152
(the value of AS in line 180 - this can
be changed if you wish), the data for
this is held in lines 200 to 320. By the
way, do take care with the values, since
the sort is a very essential procedure.
The main database (lines 1860
onwards) is then sized up and dimen-
sioned (lines 360 & 370) before being
committed to  memory as the AS()
array. This ﬁrst array is a  simple
representation of the database, word
for word, and acts as the resource for
your enquiries. In order for this pool
of information to be tapped, a con-
trolling array is required - namely the
L$() array.
This second array is created on the
screen, for example "ABATE I20:" is
AS(120), together with its own sub-
script, is Input into memory as part
of the L$() array -  see INPUT 1 ,
LS(J) in line 460. Thus we eventually
end up with two arrays -  the ASO,
representing the database, and LSO,
C64 PROGRAM 1111
representing the ASO, together with
the appropriate A $ ( )  subscripts
MINUS the asterisks. Check line 360
for E
the asterisks in the D IM L$ (D-E-I)
in line 380, and check line 400 to see
how I avoided their appearance on the
screen in line 450,
Once the L$() array is completed.

the SYS AS in line 420 sorts the array
into alphabetical order. Despite its
machine code pedigree, the sort has
a lot of work to do, so be prepared
for a wait of up to three minutes in
this large program example! With that
important job done, the next task is
to create a special Control String that
allows the user to call up the word
list at whatever point he or she wishes
on the screen.
This string (C$) is a compilation
of array position numbers for each
fresh alphabetical change that occurs
in the L$O array. In  other words, i f
the user presses the letter "D", the list
on the screen will begin with words
starting with the letter "D ". This
facility works for the entire alphabet-
ical range. The SPACE bar also allows
the list to be paged forward and back
in follow-on order. In this way words
can be accessed very quickly. Study
lines 500 to 560 to see how the Control
String (CS) is created.

Now that the program has initiated
itself, an alphabetical list appears on
the screen t h i s  always begins with
words starting with the letter "A". This
list appears alongside all the necessary
prompts and safe guards. All you have
to do is press the appropriate letter
key and, i f needed, the SPACE bar
(Shift /SPACE i f  you wish to  page
backwards), then press the RETURN
key and the top left-hand word will
appear in Reverse.
Now use the up and down CUR-
SOR key to  position the Reverse
hightlight over the word you wish to
investigate. Press the RETURN key
again, and your list o f  associated
words will appear on the screen. For
example, the word BIG will reveal such
words as GIANT, MASSIVE, ENOR-
MOUS, etc.. The Ft key allows you
to return to the same previous position
in the main list.

the screen, but the printer has its share
of responsibilities, and there are three
types of print out at your disposal:
1. The full Data Base as i t appears
at the end o f the program. Tap the
F2 key, then immediately hold down
the CTRL key until the printer starts.
2. The Alphabetical List together with
the appropriate A$() subscripts. This
print out begins from its alphabetical
appearance on the screen. Tap the F4
key, then immediately hold down the
CTRL key until the printer starts.
3. A print out of your selected group
of words. Press the F2 key only.
Print items 1 & 2 are only available
while the Alphabetical List is on the
screen. They are protected from casual
use by employing the CTRL key as
described, and also there are a lack
of prompts on the screen I  have
intended their access only to you, the
programmer. Print item 3  is only
accessible while your selected group of
words appears on the screen. All print
outs end with a  word count, and
printing can be abandoned by holding
down any key on the C 64. Of course
if you don't have a  printer, simple
REM out lines 780,790 & 1410.
As for the databse itself, i t need
not be restricted to a Thesaurus. Any
groups of words, ideas or items that
share a  common interest can be
included -  parts for equipment per-
haps, or even foreign language trans-
lation. Just remember to encompass
them by asterisks as I  have done in
the enclosed example, and ﬁnish the
data statements with a double asterisk

Not only will you ﬁnd this program
useful for your own literary efforts, but
any younger members o f the family
will certainly beneﬁt too. My eight year
old son. Ian, told me to tell you!

and missiles clash in this game of futurisitc combat.
It's a game that's remarkable in two respects n o t
only is it based on a cult series of board games, but also
represents Infocom's entry into the world o f role-playing
games.
' I n  Battletech, you are Jason Youngblood, trainee mech
pilot and son of the legendary Jeremiah Youngblood. As
the game begins, you're a long way from the heat of the
battle, in fact you've only just started your training in mech
, control and weaponry. It's a process that's long and dull,
but necessary if you're going to survive the rest of the game.
' The problem lies with the Kuritans, a nasty bunch who
may at any moment invade your base and destroy your
entire city.
You always fear such an attack, and expect i t any
moment (the game can't be this dull for much longer), and
sure enough it comes just before you've crammed in all
the training you require. Suddenly, you're very alone and
. unarmed (unless you've had the sense to get yourself a riﬂe),
you set off for Starport to seek out fellow rebels.
. S t a r p o r t  is another town that's been seized from the
' Lyran Commonwealth, and is full of people who'd like to
have a shot at you, particularly if they ﬁnd out that you're
1 a rebel. So after a change of clothes, you try to inﬁltrate
a victory celebration hoping that other rebels will do the
same. You're in luck, as you meet your father's old friend
r• Rex, who even has a 'mech' for you, together with a quest.
• You must gather together all remaining Lyran rebels, ﬁnd
'the secret store olmech parts and get off the planet.
To add to your problems, Kuritans will pose as rebels
to damage your mission, which will take you into adventure-
style situations and battles with mechs and foot soldiers.
Combat involving mechs -  whether they are the fast but
lightly armed locusts, or the juggernaut chameleons -  is
a dangerous art, in • which you must use the terrain and
.your mech's abilities to  outsmart and out-gun your
opponent.
In the game, you must specify a target for each of your
weapon systems (a lengthy task for heavily armed mechs),
and then plot where your mech will move. Movement and
. combat are then carried out simultaneously, with text and
:
-
provide you with the chance to decide your own battle
:tactics. For example, if you're up against a Locust armed
with machine guns, then you'll want to keep your distance
and out of their range. Alternatively, a Wasp hurling missiles
at you has to be stopped fast, so you want to get as close
as possible and add kicking to your arsenal of weaponry.
A mech's main problem is overheating, which can cause
shutdown at the worst possible time. You can delay this
"by standing in water, but the best way is to conserve your
'weapons until you really need them. This can get critical

if some of your heatsinks get shot up, and the repair bills
can be extortionate,
You can increase your chances of success through skills
gained either at the training centre or added since, through
courses or people who join your party. The most useful
are medical skills to patch up your wounded (if a key
character such as Jason dies, then your game is over -
a bit like Neighbours, really -  Ed) and engineering, that
will allow you to salvage mech parts and ammo from the
debris of battle to patch up your own mechs or even build
new ones,
Battletech is a  massive game, with over 4  million
locations to explore, hundreds of mechs to battle, people
to deal with and ﬁght, and adventure-style sequences to
spice up the action just when you thought it was getting
predictable.

MacPics
on Amiga
How to port those superb black-and-white Mac
graphics over to your Amiga
By Jay Gross
H
ture before, one that origi-
nates o n  o n e  a n  Ap p l e
Macintosh computer? You have to
give them credit, their black-and-white
graphics really do look nice. But the
good news is that you can port those
pictures over to the Amiga with a little
effort, a little luck, and a kit of utilities
from the freely distributable libraries
of Amiga software. Oh, and a couple
of expensive pieces o f  commercial
software, too, if you want to get really
fancy.
To view a  Ma cPicture on the
Amiga, you ﬁrst have to ﬁnd a way
of getting the Mac File into the Amiga.
The easiest way is with your old friend,
the computer BBS. Many electronic
BBSs around the country offer graphic
ﬁles in the MacPaint picture format.
The Macintosh has many graphics ﬁle
formats, but MaePaint is one of the
most common. Look for MacPaint
formatted pictures ﬁrst, because
they're the easiest to  view o n  the
Amiga. Download the ﬁles from your
favourite BBS using your favourite
terminal program. I f  you don't have
a modem, you're pretty well stuck for
now, as there is currently no way to
read MacDisks directly.
If you see ﬁles labelled Stufﬁt,
forget them. Stufﬁt is a MacPacking
program like ARC, but is not machine
independent, so  ask. Maybe the
sysoppery where you call will unMac-
Stuff those ﬁles for you. While you're
downloading, o r at your next user-
group meeting, try to collect up the
following kit of utilities from the public
domain libraries:
A: MacView b y Scott Evernden -
preferably the most recent version.
B: Multiview2.0 by Wayne Hogue.
Documentation comes with the ﬁrst
version, and the program isn't terribly
easy to ﬁgure out without the does.
C: Your choice of graphic screen saver.
My suggestions are Iffencode by Matt
Dillon and ScreenX by Steve Tibbet.
If you have the commercial program
GR A BBIT, from Discovery Software,
you won't need the others, although
ScreenX does some neat additional
tricks. In  a pinch, you could get by
without a screen saver, but it's nicer
with than without.
The other pieces o f commercial
software (besides GRABBIT) are for
serious picture porting. First and most
important is the $69,95 (ouch! that's
the U.S. price) PixMate from Progres-
sive Peripherals. It's by Justin McCor-
mack, and i t has a  bunch o f neat
features that will be useful for many
other things besides porting MacPic-
tures. I f  you want to convert larger
MacArt to Amiga-sized screens, Pix-
Mate is just the ticket. Deluxe Pho-
tolab will accomplish the job, but not
in the same way as PixMate,
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
34
The other item on the shopping- 1st
is DigiView 3.0 from NewTek. It's
possible that some of the other dig-
itizing software on the market will
work, but you'll have to ﬁnd that out
for yourselves, DigiView's software is
all you need for this purpose. How-
ever, it comes WITH the hardware for
$199.95 (U.S. listed price). The current
version is 3,0, and it's worth upgrading
to if you have the older versions, just
to keep the headache quotient down
while loading and saving ﬁles.
Both Multiview2.0 and MacView
will show a MacPicture on the Amiga
screen. Multiview offers a number of
read options, and w i l l  sometimes
correctly display Ma cScreens that
MacVinsr cannot cope with. MacView,
however, offers the ability to SAVE
a MacPaint formatted ﬁle, as well as
the option to print pictures, and to
scroll around the displayed MacPic-
ture in Amiga high-resolution or low-
resolution modes.
Try MacView ﬁrst. If it complains
that the ﬁle is not MacPaint format,
try invoking it from the CL1 window
with the command:
MacView -f < ﬁlename > .
The "4" in there tells the program
not to  worry about an incorrect
MacPaint ﬁle header. The Macin-
tosh's various softwares aren't to o
careful about writing that ﬁle structure
out in an interchangeable manner, so
ﬁles generated with different products
may have variations of the ﬁle header.
If the ﬁle won't work with Mac-
View, tr y  Multiview2.0. Although
Multiview2.0 has an option for saving
to 1FF ﬁle, it won't accomplish what
is needed to make PixMate's job ﬁt
in only 512K o f chip memory. Use

AMIGA PROGRAMMING
MacView in hi-res. The program has
a slider on the right side of the screen
for choosing which part of the Mac
Picture is showing. In addition, you
can smooth-scroll the image with the
mouse by pointing into the image area,
holding the left mouse button down,
and moving the mouse.
Many Ma cPictures are smaller
than the Amiga screen, particularly
images intended for use as clipart. If
the picture you're trying to import is
smaller than the Amiga screen, you're
home free. Use MacView's SAVE LEE
option, o r  GRABBIT, o r  IFFEN-
CODE, or ScreenX to save the screen
to an 'FT disk ﬁle and that's that.
Most MacPictures are, however,
more lines tall than MacView (or the
Mac) can display at one time. On the
original Macs, the screen resolution is
512 x 380, so who but Apple knows
why the pictures are bigger than
Amiga's 640 x 400 screen? Maybe the
purpose is to print a letter-sized sheet
and not enjoy the whole thing on the
screen at one time at all. But whatever
the reason they are bigger.
To get the bigger MacPictures into
a single piece viewable on the Amiga,
you'll need PixMate's expensive fea-
tures. I f  your intent is to  use the
ﬁnished image as line art, you'll also
need DigiView 3.0 for the ﬁnal con-
version back t o  black-and-white.
Here's what you do for the bigger ones:
First, with MacView in 640x400
mode, get the top part o f the Mac-
Picture to show. Next, save the screen.
The latest version of MacView has a
nice pulldown menu option for this •
appropriately named SAVE L ER
However, if you have an older version,
you can multitask some screen saver
software to do the job. Using GRAB-
BIT, it's a  hotkey operation, with
ScreenX, a menu proposition. Using
1FFENCODE, you get a CL1, CD to
where you want the ﬁles to go, as well
as IFFENCODE. L e ft Amiga M
shows the picture so IFEENCODE
can copy it out to a ﬁle. Leave the
CLI active and press return when the
picture is showing.
The next step is obvious - do the
same thing for the bottom half of the
MacPicture. Be sure to use a different
ﬁlename so you'll have two halves in
two ﬁles. It's best to have some overlap
to make lining up the two images easier
later on in this involved process. The
rest is a job for PixMate.
Before you start, plan on using up
some disk space for all this, as the ﬁle
size for each half just about quadru-
ples. Also it's best to save frequently
and with incremental ﬁlenames, so if
you make a booboo (it's easy to do!),
you won't have to start over at Step
One. Allow at least 300-K of disk space
for EACH 40-50K MacPicture you
want to convert. Of course, when the
job is done, you can safely get rid of
all the extra ﬁles.
MacView's display is four colours
(note the green gadgets in its title bar).
You warn greys, not greens, but an
LEE screensave will have a four-colour
palette to start. You crop out the green
gadgets and reformat the picture to
allow 16 colours instead o f  four
(memory consumption goes W A Y
up!). Pictures saved with Mac View are
two colours, and so are much neater
to start with.
Although other products besides
PixMate will do the job we've done
you need Pix Mate for the next part:
diffusing the black-and-white image
into those extra bitplanes, making a
picture with shades of grey instead of
blobs of black. The purpose of con-
verting to shades o f grey is to keep
the next step -  removal of some o f
the lines of the image - from making
a big mess.
Okay, load the TOP half of your
picture into PixMate use the pro-
gram's DISPLAY option to turn ON
bitplanes 3 and 4. The program will
automatically reformat the picture to
16 colours when you exit this option.
To crop off the green gadgets, you
can either use the CLEAR AR EA
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
35
command, or scoot the image to the
right with SHIFT- < right cursor > .
What goes off the right side o f the
screen is gone forever, so centre the
image for further work. Next, do a
PACK C OL OR S a n d  a  S OR T
COLORS (low to hi) on the image,
and save the image, in case of disaster.
This is the TOP ﬁle.
The next step in all this is image
processing to "soften" the image into
those extra bitplanes. Most of the time,
the softening should be done at this
point. However, for particularly dense
pictures, you might get better (and
faster!) results by waiting till after
you've reunited the halves to do the
softening. Experimentation is the only
way to ﬁgure out which is which.
Using PixMate's image processing
panel, select "AVG." This will take a
couple o f  minutes, b u t i t's very
entertaining to watch. The result is a
grey-scale picture, and a  very good
one, too, so, save it just in case.
Next click back to the "DISPLAY"
option, and select "COLOR" in the
reduction/enlargement side. "Color,"
rather than "Even," "Odd," or "Aver-
age," is usually the best way to make
a size change fo r the MacPictures.
With some images, "Average" will
work ﬁne, and it's much quicker, so
you might want to give it a whirl and
see if it works ﬁrst. Use UNDO if it's
not any good.
You need to reduce the image size
in both directions. The dimension
containing the most detail will suffer
the worst, so you might need t o
experiment with choosing "Thinner"
or "Shorter" ﬁrst or second. Use the
"Pack Colors" option again, and then
do a "Sort Colors." You want "high
to low". Save this image! It's (ﬁnally!)
the ﬁnished version of the top half of
your picture. If you don't like the way
it looks, experiment with some of the
optional routes described earlier.
Obviously, to get the bottom half,
you'll have to go through the same
steps. Do the same thing, in the same

order, to get the bottom picture in the
same state. You can use the OTHER
SCREEN feature to line up the images
with each other before you go into
image processing, but the AVG func-
tion will insist on your closing down
the OTH ER  screen. It's  memory
intensive, and i t wants pure* unclut-
tered CHIP memory too.
The ﬁnal step is combining the
shrunken, grey-scale images into one.
Don't delete these ﬁles, however, if you
plan to go to the DigiView step - some
images work better through that part
as halves, rather than wholes. To save
perfectly, use the "Clip" option to get
both onto one screen. Save the image,
and it's (ﬁnally!) done.
The result so far is a grey-scale
picture half the size o f the original
MacPicture as ported to the Amiga
(the Macintosh uses only a nine-inch
screen, so the ﬁnal image size isn't
much different). However, if you want
to use the image as line art* say, in
a desktop publishing application,
you'll want to go the extra mile with
DigiView. But take heart -  the Dig-
iView part is not nearly as long and
involved as the PixMate section.
are quite nice, but HAM pictures don't
make the translation very well. After
the MacVersion of the Amiga ﬁle is
showing, save it either to MacPaint
format (fo r  torturing your local
MacBBSs) or to Amiga IFF, to get
a two-colour image from a colour one.
The Digi View step is called for if this
doesn't work. Especially i f you like
playing with Digi View.
First, load up DigiView. You don't
need to  hook up your camera and
lights, because this is a pure software
operation. Set DigiView's palette to
TWO colours, making the ﬁrst one
memory, you can try reducing the
number of colours back to two, after
all the diffusing, packing and shrinking
has been accomplished. However,
you'll lose detail from the picture.
Also, yo u  can tr y  MacView s

dither Amiga colour pictures into
blobs of black-and-white acceptable to
the MacScreen. Sometimes the results
To match the pictures, you want
the palettes to be exactly the same,
even i f  you use something besides
PixMate to do the joining. To match
the palettes, load both pictures into
Pix Mate at once - one on each screen
- pick out the one with the fewest
colours, and then invoke PixMate's
"Match Palette/ "With Other" option.
You should go through this step even
if there is no discernible difference
between the palettes, and i f you plan
to work on the images in some other
program, you should save the ﬁles
after the palette matching is complete.
To merge the two images with
PixMate, toggle between them with
"Flip" and adjust the position o f the
images with < Shift > < cursor key > .
When the tw o  images match u p

black, and the second one white, You'll
have to change the second one from
grey to white with the sliders. Select
FREEZE PALETTE, and click on
COLOR. This brings you t o  the
COLOR menu, where you need to
reduce the contrast by several clicks
(for a very detailed original), and/ or
raise the sharpness slider by three or
four clicks (for a blocky original).
Then, simply LOAD the ﬁnished
picture th a t you've saved o u t o f
PixMate. DigiView will display its
results as i t goes, so i f you see that
the image needs more contrast, bright-
ness, o r whatever, stop the process
with the left mouse button, make the
changes, and select DISPLAY. After
some trial and error, you should get
a pure black-and-white effect from the
ﬁnished picture that's every bit as nice
as the MacPaint original.
Whew! That's it. The whole process

start to ﬁnish. Just think how long

picture!

fall enumerable times as an
unchivalrous alien brings yet
another game to a quick and dissa-
tisfying end (one that everyone else,
it seems, can master easily), I decided
to have a go at writing a game that
would allow her to ﬁnish, yet remain
a challenge both to her and to those
a little more capable.
After much head-scratching, I
decided to  have a  go a t that old
favourite - the maze, where the object
is to  ﬁnd the exit i n  the shortest
possible time. However, m y  game
would have one added challenge - the
player would not only decide on the
dimensions of the maze, but also the
dimensions o f the window through
which the maze can be viewed. Furth-
ermore, players can decide to create
a new maze, or re-run the one before.
Another option is the choice o f
running speed. Run too fast, and you'll
crash into walls. You may also redeﬁne
the keys to be used. The game itself,
and the 'Maze Generator', are written
in Code -  I found Basic a little too
slow.
Note that on starting, the following
keys are deﬁned:-
Z = left: X  = right: RETURN z Up:
CSRL/ CSRR = Down
Space Bar gives time remaining.
(Joystick in port 2 can be used - button
= space).
ANY OTHER KEY WILL LEAD TO
MENU O R  R E R U N  T H E
PROGRAM.
Type in and save the listing. The
code is included in the basic program.
If you wish to increase the maze size,
then you can lower variable 'S', which
is the approximate end o f memory
used by the program. One way is to
take Out the R EM statements and
make the DATA statements a seperate
program. Don't forget to take out the
ﬁrst GOSUB if you do.
Finally, this program makes use of
the little-used Extended Background
mode of the 64.

COMMODORE A MIGA S
Amiga Workbench
More useful hints and tips for Amiga owners from
computer buff Burghard-Henry Lehmann
D
Many people who come to the
Amiga from 8-bit machines
like the Commodore 64, are in some
respects even more confused and
daunted by this multitasking, super-
graphic, stereophonic sound monster
than those for whom the Amiga is their
ﬁrst computer.
I'm talking about the well-known
adage about old dogs ﬁnding it hard
to learn new tricks. After all, those of
us - including myself - who grew up
on 8-bit machines like the Sinclair
Spectrum and the Commodore 64,
spend a lifetime (well, about ten years,
which in micro computer terms is a
lifetime) trying to  ﬁnd out exactly
where everything is on the Amiga and
how one uses and intercepts Rom
routines and so on.
In my time, a mouse was still a
pest to poison or shoot or get rid of
by some other inhumane method - it
was not something that nestled next
to your keyboard. So why did I torture
myself all those years with rubber
keyboards o f the Sinclair kind, i f it
can be that easy?
Now we have to learn about such
things as "open architecture", and i f
you want to use some memory, you
have to ask the computer nicely and
tell it how much you want and of what
type. And then, when you don't need
it any more, you must never forget to
give it back! But, most confusing of
all for the 8-bit brigade, there is no
detailed memory map on the Amiga!
How can you get used to such a thing?
I'm just joking, because I have to
admit that underneath it all, I'm far
too much o f a computer addict not
to be fascinated by it all. I think there
are few areas of expertise, short of the
philosophical question "Who am I?",
that offer more scope for constant
expansion o f  knowledge t h a n
computers.
The Amiga is no exception. It's just
another stepping stone i n  the con-
stantly changing sphere o f  micro
electronics and data processing con-
cepts. But let's get back down to earth
and try to make sense of some of the
new concepts of the Amiga and hope
we can understand them. As I've said
before, one o f  the most confusing
things about the Amiga is the missing
rigid memory map.
But why do we need such a memory
map? After all, computer memory
consists o f  nothing but a  row o f
locations, each location given a name
in the form of a number. Isn't it much
better for the computer itself to take
care of the organisation of its memory?
When I  started programming on
the Amiga, the concept o f libraries
confused me no end. How can one call
a routine i n  the computer without
having anything more than the name
of the routine? But let's get this clear
ﬁrst: libraries o n  the Amiga are
basically nothing more than Rom-
routines on any other computer. The
main difference is that the Amiga has
carried the concept o f using Rom-
routines much further than the older
machines.
On most of the 8-bit machines, you
only found out how to use the Rom-
routines after the machines had been
on the market for quite some time, and
only because the computer pro-
grammers went to  the trouble o f
disassembling the Rom.
On the Amiga, the Rom-routines
were from the start structured in such
a way that they are accessible to every
programmer. Some o f the old 8-bit
machines were, at least at the begin-
ning, pretty coy about telling people
how the operating system worked. The
Amiga, o n  the other hand, was
designed to  be accessible from the
start.
But how can one use something if
one doesn't know where it is?
The statement that one doesn't
know where each library is is strictly
speaking not true and therefore con-
fusing. I f  you look in the Appendix
D-5 of the Amiga Exec manual, you'll
ﬁnd all the library functions o f the
Amiga listed and i n  front o f each
function an address. Bu t this isn't
really an address - it's an offset, given
in the form of a negative number.
For example, the Exec function
AllocMem, which simply enables the
programmer to allocate some memory
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
40
•he needs for his program, is located
at -198. The base address for all Exec
libraries i s given i n  the one ﬁxed
memory address in the Amiga: loca-
tion 4. Get this address and subtract
198 from it, and you've got the calling
address o f  the AllocMem library
function.
If you want to call the function of,
let's say, the Intuition Library, you
have to open that library ﬁrst. That
is, you call the OpenLibrary function
of the Exec library, which is at -552,
and then Exec gives you the base
address for the Intuition Library, that
is, where the Intuition Library i s
located at this moment.
Each function o f  the Intuition
Library has a similar offset. In other
words, there is one ﬁxed point, and
everything else is related to that ﬁxed
point. I sometimes think that the over-
emphasis on C on the Amiga doesn't
help. On the old 8-bit machines, most
people started off with Basic and either
stood with it, quite happily, or changed
over to assembler.
Basic, of course, keeps you as far
away from the real machine as you
can get. But, with all its limitations
and depending upon the particular
Basic dialect the machine allows you
to use, at least it keeps things pretty
simple. I t  i s  really a  high level
language.
Assembler gets you well and truly
into the machine. I f  you really want
to learn about a computer, you should
attack i t on the machine code level.
The main problems with it is that there
are a lot of unnecessary myths about
machine code programming. Even the
Amiga is best explained on machine
code level. I  just proved this by my
explanation o f what Amiga libraries
are all about.
I could now go on to explain how
you pass certain parameters in certain
registers before calling a library, and
how it hands you certain parameters
back in certain registers.
If you look at it from the assembler
level, it's all pretty straightforward.
C, on the other hand, is neither a
true high-level language, like Basic,
which keeps you completely away
from the machine, nor to my mind is
it as exact in explaining the machine
as assembler is.
Somebody said, everybody should
learn about computer programming
by starting o ff with assembler. I t
sounds crazy, but I agree!

which was best known for its toughness. It was the
game that sorted the men from the boys, as the slightest
error resulted in failure. Now here's the sequel N a v y
Moves.
Your mission is to seek out and destroy an enemy nuclear
submarine, It's a task that's made even more difﬁcult by
the fact that you're alone. Your mission begins i n  an
inﬂatable motorboat that's travelling at high speed towards
a watery mineﬁeld full of ﬂoating contact mines that must
be hurdled i f your mission isn't going to falter before it
begins. To  add to  your problems, enemy troops riding
aquatic bikes come hurtling towards you. Luckily, you can
ﬁre back to  keep them at bay. Soon you'll reach the
underwater entrance to the enemy base, which means diving
into the depths and tackling scuba divers and sharks.
To get to the base, you'll have to travel through an
underwater cavern containing an octopus and a giant sea
monster. If you're still hanging on to one of your ﬁve lives,

the sub itself.
Now your mission becomes even tougher, as you must
plant a bomb at the base o f the sub's reactor and then
force it to surface so you can transmit a message to your
base and get rescued before the bomb explodes. Onboard,
you'll have to battle with marines armed with riﬂes and
ﬂamethrowers, and overpower ofﬁcers to gain their passes
(that will give you access to the more secret parts of the
subs) and codes (that will allow you to order the sub to
surface and transmit the message to your base).
Your realistic chances of completing this mission are
slim at best but, above average garners who like their
challenges tough will enjoy Navy Mows.

Tony Heatherington assesses the latest games releases
on the Commodore PC
688 Attack Sub
6 88 Attack Sub puts you in control of a top secret billion
dollar US submarine in a series of missions that will
take you into battle against surface destroyers, helicopters
and submarines. These range from training missions against
dummy ships to full battle missions in the world's most
dangerous sea lanes, and even to the early conﬂicts of World
War I
 To add to the fun, you can also swap to the helm of
a Soviet Alfa sub to see how the other half lives, and even
play a second player via a modem link which will surely
provide the ultimate in submarine simulation.
The sub is controlled through a series of screens manned
by your crew, that carry out your orders issued through
the mouse or keyboard. For example, at the sonar desk
you can deploy and retrieve towed-array sonar, as well as
create a 3D-sonar contour map to track enemy vessels. You
can also send out active sonar bleeps, but this has its risks
as it may alert the enemy to your position.
Stealth and silence are essential to submarine warfare,
and you must learn how to use the sea's thermal layers
to hide behind until you're ready to strike. When you go
to battle stations, o u  have Mark 48 tor edoes and even
,
a few missiles to sink the enemy with, before diving to
the depths and safety. Some commanders like to watch
the torpedoes strike their targets in glorious 3D, but this
can be hazardous, and may even cost you the mission.
If the enemy do track you down, you can either run
to safety or ﬁre a noisemaker to decoy their weapons as
you escape. The game really comes to life in a full combat
situation when you know there's an enemy out there looking
for you. I f  it's a juicy convoy, then you must plan your
attack, avoiding the destroyers, subs and helicopters that
will be escorting it.
In a one-on-one against an enemy sub, things get really
tense as you try and outmanoeuvre your opponent so that
you know where he is while remaining hidden from his
sonar. However, the sea is a noisy place, so you'll have
to develop your own sonar skills to track down your prey.
Submarine games are always popular, as they present
an irresistible mix o f skill and strategy and pile on the
atmosphere as you dive, dive, dive into action.

Abrams Battle Tank
A
brams Battle Tank is the land-based equivalent of 688
Attack Sub, and puts you in control of an M 1AI on
the frontline as World War III breaks out. Hundreds of
Russian tanks, infantry and helicopters have been detected
crossing the border. You're desperately outnumbered and
outgunned, but you're determined d o w n  ﬁghting.
1
As in 688, you control the tank from different stations,
including those manned by the tank commander, gunner,
loader and driver. Your tank is armed with an anti personnel
machine gun and a main cannon that can ﬁre either anti-
tank or anti-aircraft shells, so it's important to have the
right ammo loaded as the threat approaches.
Moving the tank can be a little tricky to start with,
as you can either move the tank or the turret through left
and right rotate controls and forward and back acceleration.
The gunner's station is probably the one you'll use most
as you can drive the tank, load weapons and aim and ﬁre
at targets. However you may want to view the driver's station
for accurate navigation, and the commander's screens to
check fuel and ammo levels, or even go up top to spot
approaching aircraft.
When the battle is raging, the battleﬁeld will become
strewn with smoking debris which may affect visibility,
although you can switch to thermal imaging to continue
tracking down your targets. The MIA1 is even ﬁtted with
a smoke discharger to hide you from enemies not ﬁtted
with thermal imagers.
All these features combine to give you a chance in the
battle ahead, but your early attempts may end up in your
tank spinning around helplessly as you ﬁre at anything that
comes into your sights. However, you will then learn to
use your scanner to plot the enemy and begin to use the
3D terrain to your advantage. Also, youll learn to stay
within fuel range of a base where you can rearm and refuel
before returning to the battle.
Eight different scenarios tune up your ﬁghting skills
before you take on the full World War Ill campaign.

A
ﬁght is taken to the air in this historical simulation
of naval air combat in World War II. It's set in
the Paciﬁc in 1942. when the USA sprang into action after
Pearl Harbour, and clashed with the Japanese navy in four
key battles including Midway. However, these naval battles
weren't decided by ships' guns but by aircraft that ﬂew
dangerous missions from the decks of carriers. In this game
you can take on the role of either an American or Japanese
pilot.
After a few training missions to spruce up your ﬂying
skills, you're ready for action and one o f the missions
associated with each of the battles. On average there are
three missions for each side in each battle, so there's plenty
of action waiting for combat pilots. To add to the game,
the disks are supported by a 150 page manual packed full
of historical mission data and accounts from the real pilots
which include useful tips on planning attack runs and
ensuring you get back home in one piece.
The missions fall into four basic categories - dogﬁght,
escort for bombers, dive bombing and torpedo attacks. The
ﬁrst two are aerial ﬁghts high above the waves, where height
and speed can give you the edge over your enemy, but
it's the bombing and torpedoing missions that will really
test your skills.
Your job is to deliver a bomb or torpedo on an enemy
carrier that's defended by guns and its own ﬁghters. Sounds
impossible, but many have succeeded before you. The idea
behind dive bombing is to ﬂy high over the target to avoid
contact and then dive down, drop the bomb and climb
out o f range before you get shot at or engulfed in the
explosion.
Torpedo attacks are the other extreme as you avoid
detection by ﬂying low -  very low -  over the sea before
launching your torpedo and pulling out to safety. However,
airspeed and range are important to ensure that the torpedo
hits the target and sends the ﬂattop to the bottom of the
sea.
Many of these missions are extremely hazardous, and
the aircraft unsuitable to carry them out but success brings
medals and promotions and a drive to play the game again
and again.

 game that all
trek h a v e  been waiting for, y o u  boldly go where
no game has gone before. In the game you control
Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and
Scott in the Enterprise's most challenging mission yet.
The Klingons have developed a  ray that causes
Federation starships to turn renegade, and this has set the
alarm bells ringing in Starﬂeet Command. Their answer
is to set up a guarantee zone around the infected areas
and send in the Enterprise to sort out the problem. This
works well in theory but the Klingons, Romulans and
Federation planets trapped within the Klein Sphere object
to this, making your task even more difﬁcult.
The screen consists of a large window surrounded by
seven smaller ones that can be selected by clicking on them
with a joystick controlled cursor. Through this method you
can select the main crew members and control the ship
through their departments.
For example, Kirk is in charge of the stores (items that
you ﬁnd on worlds) and decides who forms landing parties
by p l a c
information on planets and systems selecting through Sulu's
navigation controls. Scott, naturally, controls the warp and
impulse engines and warns if the dilithium crystals "canna
take it". Uhura sends ano receives messages from Starﬂeet
command, while Chckov controls the phasers, photon
torpedoes and the combat screens.
The object of the game is to locate the Klingon device
and ﬁnd the means to destroy it. This quest will take you
to planets and systems within the guarantee zone and into
adventure-like sequences on the surface of life-supporting
planets. Whatever the problem, each of your crew will have

 best way.
For example, a door blocks your path. Sulu and Chekov
want to break i t down with force, Uhura wants to send
signals at it, Scott wants to look for hidden switches and
Spock wants to analyse it. Selecting the wrong option may
either damage the door or the crew member so you can't
just blunder around without applying some logic.
Your reward for a correct solution will be a device that
may help solve another problem elsewhere in the zone, or
might be part of the ﬁnal solution.
Whenever an enemy ship approaches the alarm will ring
and it's up to you via Chekov to track the enemy ships
and blast them with either phasers or photon torpedoes.
Any careless shooting could result in damage to the ship,
its weapons or the invaluable dilithium crystals. Luckily,
the zone is packed full of planets containing reﬁneries to
restock crystal supplies and friendly bases for repairs, but
also strange worlds that drain your ship's energy. There
are 21 different types of worlds in the game, so you never
quite know what you'll ﬁnd in a system.
The original ST version of the game ﬁnally appeared
18 months late, over a year ago, so it's good to see the
C64 version here at last. It contains all the favourite Trek
characters (except the security guards with only 10 minutes
to live) and is sure to please Commodore trekkies.

Address Book
T
boon to all tape users who can't
afford a disk drive. Too often
we are left out in the cold when i t
comes to database type software.
This program offers a place to
keep all those important name
and address ﬁles, with
printout facilities if required.
This program has many advan-
tages for the tape user. For example,
as the entries are made, they are
automatically p u t into the Basic
program itself. When saved onto tape
at the ﬁnish, the program and its own
built-in Turbo loader are saved, thus
eliminating the need for a seperate ﬁle
of addresses, as well as the need to
keep track of the cassette counter. You
simply have to rewind the tape after
loading, and it will save over itself.
Building the program
The program is built by typing in Prog
I, and then saving it. Next, the Turbo
part of the program, Prog 2, is typed
in and saved. The third program, Prog
3, which is the main body o f  the
program, can now be typed in and
saved.
The three programs are now loaded
in and run one after the other to make
the ﬁnal version of the Address book
program.
'Bytes Free' is a  true value of the
available RAM,
'Entries left' is a  guess at the total
entries that might go in the program,
as the length of each entry is a variable.
If at some time this ﬁgure is found
to be incorrect, the adjustment can be
made to the value '52' in line 9070 in
the main program.

ﬁnal program is in use should be done
after the program has been run, and
then stopped in the normal manner.
This is because the turbo load part of
the program is loaded back with the
Basic, giving an incorrect value for the
start of Basic variables.
The nature of the program is such
that it will always take up the same
amount o f space on the tape, and
therefore will always load back in the
same amount of time - l min 45 secs.
Pressing the 'Left Arrow' key will at
most times return you to the menu.

From the MEN U , the following
options can be chosen:-
OPTION I: To enter a name etc. All
typed entries are limited to 20 char-
acters. INST/ DEL key will delete the
last character typed Afte r each entry,
press RETURN. To leave a line blank,
just press RETURN.

Tel. No: Enter the number,

For example - 0442877777
or 0442 877777 or 0442-877777
OPTION 2: To ﬁnd an entry,
enter just the surname,
On 'IS THIS THE RIGHT ONE':- 'N'
will move on to the next entry with
that name. 'Y' will show the complete
entry with options to Change Delete,
Exit or Print. Press the capital letter
of the key of your choice.
OPTION 3: Will list all entries with
options to Change, Delete or Exit.
OPTION 4 : Wi l l  save the whole
program to tape.
OPTION 5: Will tidy up the entries
whenever needed. Deletions are not
dealt with in the ﬁnal total until this
option is used. Therefore it is suggested
that this option is used prior to a re-
save.
OPTION 6: Will list through all the
entries giving the option to print.
Please note that the printer used
was a Citizen 2 colour mini printer,
and that using other types of printers
may necessitate alterations in the
program, namely in line 49660. The
size of the label used could also vary
with different printers, so some alter-
ations might have to be made, but
these should be obvious to you when
typing in Prog 3.
Final note
Because of the way the program saves
itself out each time, there's no reason
why you shouldn't use this program
for things other than an Address book.
For example, i t could be used fo r
Video collections or for the dreaded
Train Spotting or... the list is endless.
All you have to remember is to keep
the ﬁelds the same size, and only
change the text.

D
received rave reviews when it was imported into
the U K by the now defunct Advance Software'?
Well, now the game's US publishers Mindscape has set
up shop on this side of the pond, and has released its sequel
American Club Sports.
The game consists o f six sports that can be played
individually against the computer, o r with up to  three
friends. A title program is loaded in ﬁrst, and from there
the other games are selected. On the tape version -  the
review copy - this means remembering the counter position
for each sport or a long wait. First up is Foosball, which
is table football to you and me. It's the bar type that's
played in arcades, where you have to spin the players to
kick the ball into your opponent's goal.
Perhaps more unusual is the inclusion of two types of
billiards -  the English and Carom variants. Most people
will know the English game, so I'll concentrate on the
variant, in which there are no pockets and you have to
declare whether your effort will be a shot or a safety shot.
If you're wrong, your opponent gets a point. This means
that points are scored via cannons, and the game continues
until a set score is reached.
Pinball is a welcome addition, as I don't think there
are enough pinball games around. This one features a 3D
table, and you can even alter factors such as the angle of
the table to speed up the game, the tilt sensor and point
thresholds at which you'll gain extra balls to make the game
as easy or as difﬁcult as you want it to be.
Baseball is a strange game in which you must roll balls
up a ramp and into one o f the scoring rings at the top
of the screen. The big points are scored by landing in the
centre rings, but the pressure is piled on if you play either
against the clock or with a set number of balls.
Crazy Pool is weird -  it's played on a table that's a
cross between a pool table and a pinball machine. The

normal six pockets have vanished and are replaced by two
in the centre o f  the table. Unfortunately, these are
surrounded by pinball style bumpers arranged in an S shape,
making potting difﬁcult and totally altering the tactics of
the game.
Finally, there's a change from aiming balls into holes,
rings, goals and pockets, as the sixth event is a shooting
gallery in which you blow away ducks, rabbits, birds, foxes,
Frogs and ﬁsh to rack up the points. Once again, the choice
is either to ﬁght against the clock or to shoot with a limited
number of bullets. Either way, this completes an interesting
compilation of club sports. Indoor Sports was a big hit,
and this is sure to have some success. My favourite events
were pinball and billiards.

Xenon, which is just now becoming available on the
8-bit formats, then turned their hands to a futuristic
sports game on the ST and Amiga. Speedball was greeted
with great critical acclaim on its release, and has now found
its way onto the C64.
The question is, has it survived the transition well? I'm
glad to be able to report that it has indeed, and retains
virtually all of the ﬂavour of the I6-bit versions.
Speedball is a game of organised violence. Two team,
of ﬁve players (including a goalkeeper), race up and down
a vertically scrolling pitch. trying to ram a steel ball into
a thin goal slot while fending off the opposition.
The view is from above, and i f the ball gets thrown
above head height (when it becomes impossible to score),
then it grows in size as i t gets higher, before decreasine
as it drops earthwards.
Basically, in this game anything goes. so i f someone
from the other team whacks you in the kidneys and takes
the ball, just dust yourself off, go after him, push his nose
through the back o f his head, and then retrieve the ball.
Fighting the opposition is an integral part of the game as
it reduces their stamina, thus making them slower and more
susceptible to foul play.
Adorning the pitch are bumper-like obstructions, oil
which the ball ricochets. There are a number of differeni
pitch combinations, some of them making scoring quite
difﬁcult. From the main menu you can either play a one-
off game against a friend, or compete against the computer
in a league or knockout competition.
When playing in a competition (the league can be set
from 10-100 weeks) there is another important factor to

consider - Icons. When playing a game, some of these icons
have an immediate effect, like freezing the opponent, or
slowing them down, or giving you an unstoppable ball,
but there are others which are collectable.
These are very important, in that you can buy certain
services or improvements at the end of the game, even bribe
the timing ofﬁcial into letting you have another minute
of injury time. Most of them improve the statistics of your
team% stamina, skill or strength, but once these have reached
maximum then you'll be buying goals, bribing their coach,
making the icons last longer, and all sorts o f other dirty
tricks.
If you wanted to compare Speedball to anything it would
be Rollerhall, but what I  reckon proved the inspiration
for the game was a cartoon strip from many years ago
in the comic B a t t l e

Among the death-defying feats you'll be attempting are
ampolining, tightrope walking (gulp!), juggling, knife
rowing, and last but not least, being a jumping clown.

but at least you have the choice of practicing them before
nﬂicting your ineptitude on the public.

Circus Attraction
Always the clown, Duncan Evans fools around with
Rainbow Arts in the big top
ackward somersaults, but I didn't bother perfecting my
chnique on this event. Dusting off the dirt accumulated
y repeatedly hitting the deck, I began to climb bravely
p to the tightrope.
In this a pretty young lady precariously balances on
the rope high above the ground, and makes her way along
automatically. Rather her than me really, especially since
you're supposed to perform a scissor kick, a backward
somersault and a hand stand. As soon as I  started, the
poor girl wobbled dramatically and disappeared earthwards.
For complexity, the juggling event takes the biscuit. Not
only are you required to juggle up to six balls in order,
but you're supposed to juggle a club as well, volley a balance
ball and leap up in the air when a clown comes racing
towards you on a motorbike. It ain't easy, believe me.
I liked the next event knife-throwing t h e  best,
probably because as my doctor once told me, I'm a homicidal
maniac. Strapped to a rotating disc is the latest lovely young
assistant. Simply aim a erosshair and let ﬂy. What fun.
There are other targets beside the girl, but she's the
main one. You must also watch out for sticks of dynamite
being handed to you by your other assistant. Watching
people curse as you stick them is great fun, and this is
the one section I  practiced religiously until I  could hit
someone with every throw.
The ﬁnal event of the night is the jumping clowns, which
features three clowns leaping from seesaw to  seesaw
collecting bonuses in mid-air and avoiding the ghosts that
lurk up there.

all the events, there was only one that I actually
ed (knife-throwing). The others were ones that had
to p l a y e d  simply because I was reviewing the game. If
you are a fan of event-style games, then you'll probably
get more out of it than I did.
It's interesting that in the two player mode you have
to cooperate to score, rather than directly compete, which
may o r not may be a  good thing depending on your
viewpoint.
Circus Attraction is high on gloss (with the sound effects
d music done in a zany circus vein), but a little short
the gameplay front. With only ﬁve events, it doesn't
e too many dull ones to make the whole thing fail. Trying
before you buy is essential with this one.

B
person, I welcomed the oppor-
tunity of trying out this latest
Geos application. However, before I
go any further, I  must be perfectly
honest and say that I don't normally
use these kind o f programmes. Yes,
they do look very nice, and they also
do a very competent job. It's just that
somehow, a little of the magic of using
a computer seems to vanish when you
use this sort of package - at least for
me it does.
..._
For those that do not yet know,
GEOS stands for 'Graphic Environ-
ment Operating System', i n  other
words, a system that offers windows,
icons and pull-down menus. Anyway,
my ﬁrst thought on taking out the
manuals (yes, manuals, as in more than
one) was that i f I'd wanted to read
War and Peace I would have bought
it. l  needn't have worried though -  a
quick ﬂip through the pages put my
mind a t ease. The books are well
thought out, and explain everything
in great detail, so that even a complete
novice to the world of Geos will soon
feel at home.
The main problem with a package
like Geos is where to begin -  there's
so much on offer. You don't want to
miss anything out, but at the same time
you don't want to go into too much
detail and rewrite the programme. So
I've decided to tackle this particular
review in a more systematic way. First,
I'll list all the applications on the disks,
then brieﬂy go over some of the ﬁner
aspects o f some o f the applications.
Obviously I can't cover everything in

Paul Eves puts the latest update of the excellent Geos
package through its paces
the limited space of this review, but
by the end you should have a fairly
good idea of the package's potential.
There are three disks in the pack-
age, each being double sided. The ﬁrst
is the main systems disk, with the
reverse side given up for demos, Disk
number 2 is the back-up systems disk,
with a few applications on the reverse.
The ﬁnal disk contains the 'Write
Utilities' and a spell checker. By the
way, there is in fact a fourth disk, a
demonstration o f the Quantumlink.

Desktop
This is the main driving force of the
system. From the desktop you can
perform all your ﬁle handling proce-
dures. An extra bonus with the Version
2.0 is the use of cursor keys for pulling
down menus and making selections.
Indeed, you have a  whole range o f
keyboard shortcuts. Whenever you
make up a working disk, it is advisable
to include the Desktop on each one,
along with whatever else you may
require.
Geopaint
I have never been one fo r  paint
packages of any description, I suppose
partly because I  am not artistic by
nature. Secondly, I have always found
them to be rather long-winded and
awkward to  use. I  must confess,
however, that although Geopaint is
fairly complex in its functions, I found
it was actually fun to use.
fol- T h e  options in this section of the
package seem endless. You can create
images using special measurement and
constraining tools. You have access to
32 patterns and brush styles, overlay
can be achieved and text may be mixed
with images drawn, you can stretch
images -
your creations on a numerous list of
different printers. For those very small
increments needed, you can use the

C128 REVIEW
ound Window
cursor keys instead of the joystick or
mouse, for more accurate placement.
Geopaint works in either 40 or 80
column modes, and is interchangeable
while working within it. However, you
can only work with colour in the 40
column mode. The advantage o f
working in 80 column mode though
is obvious - you can see the whole of
your work area and plan accordingly.
Once you have the main parts drawn,
switch to 40 column mode and you
can then work in more detail.
Geowrite 2.1
Most o f us who use wordprocessors
tend to stick with the one we know
best. For example, for some time I only
ever used Easyscript. I know it's pretty
primitive compared to  most, but I
knew it inside out and back to front.
However, a fte r many months o f
badgering from the Editor, I relented
and now use either Superscript o r
Paperclip II. (Hip-Hip Hooray...Ed!).
I never really used Geowrite on
earlier Geos packages, but having used
the Geowrite 2.1, I  now think that
maybe 1 was missing out. This word-
processor, like everything else in the
system, is pretty comprehensive. You
have options to alter your document's
dimensions, change the writing win-
dow, even the ability to have different
fonts and styles. The fact that you can
mix your creations from Geopaint
with your text is most useful. You can
even add the date and time to your
page headers and footers. The usual

Tabs options are all available. You can
search for and search and replace text,
not only single words b u t whole
phrases.
In conjunction with Geowrite 2.1,
there are other related applications -
Geospell, Geomerge, Text Manager,
and Text Grabber. I don't think I need
explain Geospell and Geomerge in any
great detail. They are essentially like
most other spell checkers and docu-
ment mergers. The text manager is like
a temporary storage area -  you can
copy text into what is known as albums
for future recall. The text manager
works in the same way as Glossaries
from other wordprocessing packages.
The one really nice feature is the
Text Grabber. This application allows
you to get a document that was created
on some other Commodore supportive
W/ P. then convert i t to  Geow rite
format. The original document will
remain unchanged.
One feature I nearly forgot is the
Paint Drivers. These drivers allow you
to create special effects within your
Geowrite document. You can have
things like headlines, newspaper-type
column formats including graphics,
special border designs, etc.
Desktop Accessories
The calculator allows you to do your
calculations while running any of the
Geos applications. The results you get
may then be placed into the text scrap
so that you can recall them later, an
example would be i f you wanted to
include them in an invoice you were
preparing.
The Preference Manager enables you
to set up your own working environ-
ment. That is to say the colours you
want to work with, the colour of the
pointer and the shape of the pointer.
You can change the speed o f  the
pointer and set up the date and time.
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989

The Alarm Clock can be used to call
up the current time, providing it has
been set. You can set the correct time
and also set the alarm. Once the clock
and ,,' or the alarm are set, i t doesn't
matter which application you are in,
the clock stays active.
As its name suggests, the note pad is
used fo r keeping track o f  bits o f
information you may wish to  refer
back to. You have access to the note
pad no matter which application you
are presently in. The note pad can store
up to  127 pages, and each page is
capable of roughly 250 characters.

Like the note pad, Photo Manager is
used for storing graphic images. The
ﬁles stored are called albums. A n
album may contain up to 60 pages of
images. Therefore, you could have
albums set aside for speciﬁc images,
for example, you might have a graph
album, a pie chart album, etc.
That's just about it. I've really only
skimmed the surface of this package's
capabilities. There's so much you
could say about each application that
you'd need a whole magazine to do
it real justice. I have tried, in my own
small way, to point out some of the
ﬁner qualities. The only real way for
you to appreciate what Geos has to
offer is to' go and buy it. I've included
a couple of examples of the sort of
things you can produce. I  hope you
like them.

D
encode or decode the contents
of any block or blocks on your
disk. There are just two basic options
open to you:
SCRAMBLE -  this encodes the
speciﬁed area o f the disk. You may
do individual blocks, a series of blocks
or the entire disk. The scrambler alters
the code on the disk using a different
technique for each two-character code
entered by the user.
DESCRAMBLE - this is opposite
to SCRAMBLE. The speciﬁed area of
the disk is decoded using the same two-
character code entered previously for
that area of the disk. Please note that
if a different two character code is
used, the descrambling will not be
successful.
If you happen to enter a wrong
code on the descramble option, refer
to the troubleshooting guide.
The program is straightforward
and self explanatory. Type i n  the
listing and save it before running. Once
again, just follow the on-screen
options.

a few times on a blank disk.
If it still fails, check your listing
thoroughly, (you may have made a
mistake). If you ﬁnd no errors, check
out your hardware.
If you scramble a disk a number
of times, or attempt to descramble it
a number of times, and you cannot
restore your disk, then you must
descramble it with all the codes ever
used on that particular disk since i t
worked (they don't have to be in any

Please note that the author cannot
be held responsible for any disks that
may become corrupted beyond repair
by the use of this program.
Finally, an interesting aspect of the
program is this -  if you want to play

appear to work correctly, but in fact

Machine Code Disk
Programming
I
in Basic, Machine Code program-
ming comes very naturally. I t
demands slightly more work, but the
Kernal and DOS still do nearly all the
work fo r you. Machine code disk
commands have a close link with Basic
-,they both use the Kernal, Commo-
dore's Ii  0 routines. The difference is
that machine code routines, especially
ﬁle handling, happen a t lightning
speed. This article will concentrate on
ﬁle handling, the routines, and prac-
tical examples.
The Kernal
By the way, that's Commodore's
spelling, not mine! Note that all the
below routines are called with the JSR
instruction, with the appropriate
registers conveying data. Below is a
ﬂowchart for the use of the routines:
input •
CHKIN
•
CHRIN
SETLFS
•
SETNAM
•
OPEN

•  
•
CLOSE
•

CHKOUT

C64 PROGRAMMING
Continuing his series on disk drives, Fergal Moane
unravels the mysteries of Machine Code
Here is a summary of the necessary
routines:
SETLES SFTBA
A FILE NUMBER
X DEVICE NUMBER
Y SECONDARY ADDRESS
This sets up parameters for use
with any disk I/O, and is equivalent
to the ﬁrst three numbers in an OPEN
statement.
SETNAM SFFBD
A NAME LENGTH
X LOWB Y TE  O F  S TA R T
NAME
Y H IGH  BYTE O F  START O F
NAME
Sets a name for disk I/O. Note that
for disks, a  name must always be
speciﬁed, except opening a to channel
15 (OPEN 15,8,15)
OPEN SFFC0
NO PARAMETERS REQUIRED
Use to open a ﬁle after SETLFS
and SETNAM
CLOSE W M
A FILE NUMBER
Closes the speciﬁed tile
CHKIN SFTC6
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
56
X FILE NUMBER
Sets up a channel for input, after
using the OPEN command
CHKOUT SFFC9
X FILE NUMBER
Sets up a channel for output, after
using the OPEN command_
CHRIN SFTCF
A DATA INPUT
Inputs data from the input channel
OF d e ﬁn e d  by CHKIN, storing it in the
accumulator. Equivalent to GET
CHROUT SFTD2
A DATA OUTPUT
Outputs the data in the accumu-
lator to the output channel deﬁned in
CHKOUT. Equivalent to PRINT
CLRCHN SFFCC
NO PARAMETERS REQUIRED
Returns all input to the keyboard,
and output to the screen. Use after
ﬁnishing your own I/O
Examples
Here are tw o  assembly listings to
demonstrate the use o f  the above
routines.

N
knowledge o f  machine code
and disk editing, it's time to
turn o u r attention to  the internal
memory of the 1541. Inside the 1541
,.
lies a dedicated computer. It has a 6502
processor (as in the 64), I  6K ROM,
2K RAM, and interface chips.
Commodore's designers have for
once had foresight, and given us a host
of advanced commands to manipulate
the drive's internal memory. You can
use the drives ROM routines, or write
your own in the R AM buffers. This
allows advanced protection routines
and disk turbos to be created. I've even
seen a program which uses the drive's
6502 to calculate numbers for vector
graphics routines, effectively using the
drive as a  second slave processor,
speeding up things no end.
The Commands
The three commands below are the
approximate equivalent o f  PEEK.
POKE and SYS. Using these com-
mands, it's possible to create your own
machine code, or use the DOS rou-
tines. Unfortunately, Commodore has
never published disassemblies o f its
disk ROM, so use of it is extremely
Limited. The best way to use the disk
memory is to  buy a  machine code
minotor which allows assembly and
disassembly to disk memory. DATEL
and TRILOGIC have cartridges with
monitors possessing this facility.
MEMORY-READ

address in DOS that is to be read.
CHR$ (hi) is the high byte o f the
address.
CHR$ (number) i s  a n  optional
parameter which indicates the number
of bytes to be read.
This presumes that OPEN 15,8,15
has been performed earlier i n  the
program (as it always should be), A
GET # 15 will read the byte from the
error channel, peforming a PEEK of
the address speciﬁed by the CHR$
codes.
MEMORY-WRITE
PRINT #  15, " M-R "  CHR$ (10)
CHR$ (hi) CHR$ (number) CHRS
(data) CHR$ (data) etc...
Number obviously speciﬁes the
number o f bytes to be written. The
number o f  pieces o f  data should
correspond to the number in the third
CHR$ command. Th e  maximum
amount o f data that can be sent at
one time is 34 bytes.
MEMORY-EXECUTE
PRINT #  15, " M-E"  CHR$ (lo)
CHR$ (hi)
This command will call and exe-
cute a  machine code program that
resides i n  the D OS memory. This
routine should end w i th  a  R TS
instruction. DOS routines can be used
with this command.
USER COMMANDS
PRINT # 15, "Un"
See the table below for possible
values of N. These commands allow
a jump table jo be set up, as there is

using two letters, you can access a table
of routines quickly and easily, even

C64 PROGRAMMING
e 1541
This program alters the vital
location 106 in disk RAM. It controls
the number o f read attempts to be
made, i.e. how many times the disk
drive will try to read the sector. This
is usually ﬁve. The 'woodpecker' sound
made when the disk head hammers off
the end stop can be avoided. Also, if
your disk drive is out o f alignment,
the half track reads will increase the
chance o f  loading a  misaligned
program.
EXAMPLE 3 - disk name
10 OPEN 15, 8, 15, "1"
20 PRINT #15, "M-R" CHRS (144)
CHR$ (7) CHRS (16)
30 INPUT # 15, NAMES
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
61
40 PRINTNAMES: CLOSE 15
This reads the sixteen letter name
of the current disk. Note the CHR$(16)
to deﬁne the number of locations to
be read and the use of INPUT tt to
fetch multiple characters.
When ﬁddling around with your
disk drive, it makes sense to take the
disk out of the drive. This ensures that
if a duff value hits a sensitive spot,
your disk will not suffer the conse-
quences. Remember that you cannot
damage the drive by software, and
switching i t o ff and on again will
restore everything to normal.
Memory Map
There's little point in messing around
with drive memory if you don't know
what you're doing. Below is a 1541
memory map which details some of
the more interesting features I came
across. I  saw no point in providing
DOS disassemblies, so you'll need a
good disk monitor to experiment with
DOS routines.

Memory Man,

T
ble chips within it. There's the
VICII ch i p  f o r  40-column
screen output, the SID chip, which is
dedicated to sound, and the two CIA
chips which control interfacing and
interrupts on the C128. These chips
are identical to those found on the C64
- except for the VICII chip, which has
one extra register to control the clock
seed of the 8502 processor - and has
already been covered in a vast amount
of detail. But the Cl28 has two extra
chips. The ﬁrst is the 80-column screen
chip, th e  second i s the Memory
Mangement Unit (MMU for short). In
this article, we'll be taking a closer look
at the MM U.
C128 Memory
The C64 was very unique of its time
simply because the micro processor
could access more than 6 4 K o f
memory, though not all at the same
time, It could do this because the 6502
was upgraded to  allow fo r special
methods of 'bank' selection_ RAM and
ROM were separated into blocks, and
parts o f RAM could be mixed with
parts of ROM to produce a full 64K
of memory, which the 6510 microp-
rocessor would then see as a full 64K
of addressable memory.
The Cl28 also uses this concept, but
Commodore decided to add another
64K of RAM and a whole lot more
ROM. The 8502 (which is an upgraded
6510 to  allow 2  mhz operating)
couldn't cope with this amount o f
RAM and ROM, so a chip dedicated
to managing all this memory was
required. Thus the MMU  was born.
The upshot of this is that the Com-
modore has I 28K of accessible RAM
and a vast amount of ROM to provide
the operating system, Basic V7.0, and
of course the C64 operating system
with Basic V2.0, All this is managed
by the MMU so that a different variety
of mixtures o f RAM and ROM can
By David Kelsey
be produced to make up the full 64K
for the 8502 to address. Each one of
these varieties is called a conﬁguration.
Who uses the MMU
This chip is used frequently by the
operating system. When running a
Basic program, it has to retrieve the
actual program from RAM, but the
code for Basic which operates on the
Basic instruction is stored in ROM.
You may have also used the M M U_
The Basic command BANK provides
control over the MMU . This com-
mand is only used to allow selection
of the possible conﬁguration to allow
for running machine code programs
from Basic or to poke/ peek certain
memory locations.
The 8502 registers
Before I start on the MMU  registers,
I'll brieﬂy mention the 8502 registers
used t o  manipulate what the 8502
addressing sees in the way of ROM
and RAM. These registers are found
at locations $OO and S01 - location $OO
is the data direction register for register
$01.
In 64 mode, they operate as stand-
ard to a CM, and much has already
been written on this subject. In 128
mode, however, there is a difference.
Bits 0-2 of register $O I are used to tell
the VIC chip and the 8502 where to
get information.
Bits 0 & 1
The VIC chip gets the colour infor-
mation for the screen from R AM at
$0800, which is part of the I/O block.
However, there is another block o f
RAM which can be used for colour.
This means there are two colour RAM
blocks. They both reside at locations
$cI800 - ScIfff, and a block is selected
using bits 0 and I of address $OL
Bit I tells the VIC chip which block
to use to  display the colour -  '0'
represents R A M  block 0, and a  'I'
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
62
represents R AM block 1. Bit 0 tells
the M  MU which block will be seen
by the 8502 when the I/O section is
available to the 8502 (more about this
later). This allows the updating of one
colour block seen by the 8502 while
the other colour R A M  block i s
actually being displayed by the VIC
chip. I t  would then be possible to
switch the blocks displayed and update
the other RAM block.
On power up, the standard block
displayed by VIC and seen by the 8502
is ram block O.
Bit 2
Bit 2 selects whether the Character
information is within the VIC video
bank -  I  means that the character
information is found at RAM within
the video bank, while 0 means that the
character information is taken from
ROM at SD000.
More information can be found
with the text regarding the VIC chip.
The MMU  registers
The MMU is controlled using several
registers which allow a programmer to
control which blocks o f R AM and
ROM are concurrently visible to the
8502, select which micro processor is
being used (the C128 has a Z80 inside),
and a lot more besides.
What follows is a description o f
each register and its relative use.
The conﬁguration
register
The conﬁguration register is the one
that tell the MMU  how to make up
the 64K to be addressed by the 8502.
This register is based at address $0500
in the I/Omemory block, but can also
be found at SFR°. The reason for this
will become clear very soon.
The ﬁrst thing this register can do
is select which bank o f RAM will be
used - RAM 0-1 (0-3 is possible with
memory expansion). The area from
SC-000-SFFET can be varied in four
different ways. It could contain kernal
ROM, other types o f ROM or just
RAM. The area $8000-Sbfff is also
variable in a similar sort o f fashion.
I

Area S4000-$7ﬂt can either be Basic
ROM or RAM.
Lastly, the area f.d000-Scifff can
either allow or contain the I' 0 register
or RAM. This is why Sff00 shadows
the M M U  register a t $d500. It's
possible to switch out the I/O area,
but i f you did that, how could you
then change the 64K conﬁguration
again?
Figure 1 shows graphically how the
RAM and ROM sit:

For example, i f  you wanted access

at location Sff00. If you wanted RAM

the b i t pattern required would be
01001110 = 4E.

way of setting up ﬁxed conﬁgurations.

in one of the preconﬁguration registers
5d501-Sd504. Whenever you want that
conﬁguration, you just access the
corresponding registers Sff01-Sff04.
An access can be any type of store such
as STA, STX or STY to that address.
By way of example, consider this small
program:-
LDA # S7F
STA SD501 (assume that 1 0  registers
are accessed)
STA SET01 (select conﬁguration
$7F)
The registers at Sff00-SﬂO4 must be
available in both R AM blocks so as
to allow conﬁguration switching
anywhere. A  further useful point is
that when an interrupt occurs, the
system could be in any conﬁguration,
so at least part of the interrupt service
routine must be available i n  a l l
conﬁgurations. Instead of placing the
code in 'COMMON RAM', the con-
cept of which is described a little later,
code is copied from ROM to RAM
in both RAM blocks.
Mode conﬁguration
register
As you know the 028 has three modes
of operation; C64, Cl28 and Z80
mode. Via this register these modes can
be selected.
Below is a description of each bit
of the register and its function. This
register can be found at $c1505, and
isn't shadowed.

4,5 These are used for cartridge port.
They can detect signals on the car-
tridge port and and act accordingly.
For instance, a  C64 cartridge pulls
these lines low. The Cl28 detects this
on power up and puts the computer
into C64 mode to allow the cartridge
software to run.

Ram Conﬁguration
register
Although on a standard C128 there
are- two separate blocks of 64K RAM,
it's possible to have 'Common' RAM.
Common R A M  i s  R A M  which
appears in R AM 0 and R AM 1. To
illustrate this, try the following exam-
ple:-
BANK I:POKE 254,144
BANK 0:POKE 254,175
BANK I:PRINT PEEK(254)
The result will be 175. This means that
a certain part of memory is the same
no matter which RAM block you are
in. You change it while in RAM 0 and
switch to RAM 1, but at that certain
part o f memory the 8502 still sees
RAM O. This register is the one that
allows the programmer to  control
which parts of memory are common,
and how much of it is common. This
register is found at $d506.
Figure 2 gives a graphic illustration
of the concept o f 'common' RAM.
From 'T' to SFTFF, the contents of
the memory seen by the 8502 will
always be the same no matter what
ram block the 8502 is 'seeing'. Sim-
ilarly, from $0000 to  'B' the same
applies. Via this register you can move
'T' and 'B' around.

T $FC00 (inclusive)
i.e. common $0000 - $03ff, $fc00 - $ffff
Page 0 & 1 pointers
Another feature of the M M U  is the
ability to move page 0 and page I to
any part o f  memory. The 8502 is
transparent to this, and so the code
isn't affected.
For example, suppose the MMU
has 'moved' page zero to  location
$1000. Then, the example:-
LDA SOO
STA $60
LDA 1 $40
STA $61
LDY 0
LDA ($60),Y
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
64
will actually put 00 40 into locations
$1000 and $1001 respectively. The ﬁnal
line will of course execute as normal,
placing in A  the contents of address
$4000.
Whenever the microprocessor
accesses page 0, the MMU  intecepts
this and creates a new address based
on the contents of the page 0 pointer.
The microprocessor then uses this
address thinking it's page zero. What
this means is that you can move page
zero to another free area if you've no
spare memory in usual page zero. The
microprocessor doesn't recognise any
difference, and so all usual page zero
8502 instructions work. A  similar
description could be given for PAGE
1 pointer as it works in the same way.
Two registers are used to move the
page 0 boundary, and two are required
for page I. The two sets of registers
work in exactly the same way, so by
way of example I shall just talk about
the PAGE 0 pointer. Within the 64K
memory are page boundaries. There
are 256 page boundaries in MK, which
occur at every 256 bytes. The table
below outlines the page boundaries:
$0000 - First boundary
$0100 - second boundary
$0200 - Third boundary
$0300 - next boundary
sfe00 - boundary
$ff00 - ﬁnal boundary
The page 0 must be placed so that it
starts at one of these boundaries. The
address $D507 allows you to select 1
of the 256 boundaries you wist it to
go on.
You can also select which block of
RAM you want to place the pae you're
moving. This i s controlled b y  the
register at SD508. Bits 0-3 are used
to select the R AM block, but on a
standard 128 the only bit that has any
effect is bit O. An '0' indicates R AM
0, and a 'I' selects RAM block 1.
One further thing to  note: t o
change the contents of these registers
A.
1

requires a  special operation. The
registers are not changed until a write
operation is performed on the lower
register that controls page boundaries.
For page 0 this would be the register
at address $13507. You ﬁrst write to
the bank register at $D508 for page
0 (the value is stored but not in the
register). When you write t o  the
boundary register (at $D507 for page
0), this register is updated and then
the bank register is updated with the
value stored. Fo r example, moving
page 0 to location E1000 in bank I
could be done as follows

$D508 $ID508 write.
LDA b o u n d a r y  for address $1000
$IO ( i e  high byte of address).
STA
$D507
This isn't a very practical example -
if you try this it will crash the computer
because the operating system requires
access to  the correct page zero. A

program:

To summarize the registers:-
SD507 -  Boundary register for page

$D508 - Bank register for page O.
$1)509 -  Boundary register for page
SD50A - Bank register for page 1.
MMU version Register
This register is found a t address
$1)50B, and has two parts to it. The
high nibble -  i.e. bits 4-7 -  contains
the number of 64K RAM blocks that
the MMU can 'see'. In the case of the
standard Cl28, this is two blocks. The
low nibble (bits 0-3) contains the
version number of the M MU chip. The
current value is 0, so for a standard
Cl28, the contents of this register are
$20.
Accessing memory blocks
OK, we've seen the registers that are
available. The next thing to consider
is how we can access memory currently
not seen by the CPU, without appear-
ing to have to change the conﬁguration
and run the risk of crashing because
we switched o u t the memory the
program was actually running in. This
consideration i s only required fo r
machine code programmers. Basic
contains the BANK command which,
although not allowing all the conﬁg-
urations possible, does allow the
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
65
ability to access any part of the range
of commodore memory at any time.
The Commodore operating system
provides ﬁve routines fo r just this
situation. These are:-
I.DAFAR
STAFAR
JSRFAR
JMPFAR
CMPFAR
One way to call these routines is via
the kernal calls, which don't actually
call these routines directly but go into
kernal ROM ﬁrst. I don't recommend
this, as it restricts you to having the
kernal routines visible to  the CPU
before you can access these routines.
I found o n  one occasion, th a t I
couldn't get access to KERNAL ROM
but required these routines.
The ﬁrst question you may ask
yourself is how can these routines be
available from any conﬁguration? The
answer lies in how Commodore initi-
alises the M MU on startup. It deﬁnes
a common area from $000 to SO3ff,
and places the routines within this
block. Therefore, n o  matter which
conﬁguration you are in, these routines
are always there and as only RAM is
available at the address range $0000
- S13fff, these routines will always be
available.
IDAFAR, STAFAR &
CMPFAR
These routines provide extensions to
the L D A  (Sxx),y STA ($xx),y and
CMP (Sxx),y 8502 commands. The
format for calling is as follows:-
LDAFAR: I d a  x x  z e r o  page address used 4
(Sxx),y
sta $02aa
ldx conﬁg
jsr $02a2
STAFAR: l d x  x x
six SO2b9
ldx conﬁg
jsr $02af
CMPFAR l d x  x x
six $02c8
Id x conﬁg
jsr $02be
conﬁg is the conﬁguration required

The kernal version is similar, but i t
allows the BANK number to be given
rather than the conﬁguration. It then
converts the bank number to  the
required conﬁguration, updates the
routine to use the correct zero page
address, then calls the LDAFAR or
STAFAR routines. The call to these
routines are as follows (making sure
you have the correct conﬁguration):-
LDAFAR: I d a  x x
ldx bank
jsr $ff74
STAFAR: l d x  x x
stx SO2b9
Id x bank
jsr Sff77
CMPFAR: l d x  x x
stx E02c8
Idx bank
jsr Slf7a
JSRFAR J M P F A R
These routines provide an extension
to the standard JMP and JSR com-
mands found i n  8502. The kernal
routines don't have any extra code
before they call the routines stored in
$0000 -  $0400, unlike the STAFAR
and LDAFAR routines, so the use is
basically the same. These routines
make use o f addresses $02 -  $09 in
zero page to  pass all the possible
required information internal to the
CPU, such as the registers. Th e
memory has the following layout:-
$02 - Bank number.
S03 -  High byte of address to either
JMP or JSR.
$04 - Low byte part.
$05 - Processor status.
$06 - Accumulator.
$07 - X index register.
$08 - Y index register.
$09 - Stack Pointer.
We see that the address contained in
locations $03 & SO4 are in a different
order to  what would normally be
expected, so for example to jump to
addres $456F then set:-
$03 z $45
SO4 = SoF
Apart from location $09, the JSRFAR
C128 PR OGR AMMIN G
and JMPFAR require all the above
information to be setup.
Set up as above then:-
,IMPFAR: jsr Sf171 or $02e3
JSRFAR: jsr Sff6e or $02cd
(Both calls d o  exactly the same
actions.)
On the return after a JSRFAR
routine, the values in addresses $05-
$09 will contain relevant information
about the state of the internal registers
Upon exit of the subroutine called. This
information follows the layout des-
cribed above.

These routines would have been
very useful if Commodore hadn't made
one mistake. Even i f you call these
routines in the common area and not
via the KERN AL jump, the code then
tries to call a kernal routine to convert
the bank number to the conﬁguration
value. This means to use these routines
you must have a conﬁguration where
the kernal is visible to the CPU. It also
restricts you to only using 16 possible
conﬁgurations.
An example of this problem can
be seem when writing a machine code
program which will sit in RAM 1 at
high storage say $F000. This situation
YOUR COMMODORE august 1989
66
may occur when you want to add a
modiﬁcation to Basic, and you want
to sit the program above Basic variable
storage which is in RAM I. II at any
time the program needs to  call a
routine say in the kernal, it can't!
To try the solve the problem, we
need to examine the code more closely:
The subroutine call t o  JMPFAR
means that when a return is encoun-
tered in the code called, it returns back
to the address $23d0, which is common
memory.
By looking a t the code fo r  these
routines given above, we see that the
bank conversion call done by both
JSRFAR and JMPFAR is actually
done by the same piece of code (there's
no point looking at the KERNAL
versions, as all they do is directly jump
to the above routines). Also we see that
the JSR FAR routine assumes you
want to return to conﬁguration 00, but
this isn't always the case. It's obvious
that to  make these routines more
ﬂexible, they need to be modiﬁed. The
problem is that if they are modiﬁed,

will they remain compatable with
other codes th a t also call these
routines?
Solution 1
-
existing code:
SO2ef f r o m  20 to 2c
$02l2 f r o m  8d to Se
So the new JMPFAR code is:
You will have to put the contents of
location $ff00 into $02de before you
call the routine. This provides the
conﬁguration you want the routine to
return to after the ,ISRFAR.
If you change the code i n  this
manner then you must specify the
conﬁguration in location $02 before
calling. Because of this it is no longer
compatable with the original version,
and any other call to  this routine
expecting the usual code is liable to
crash. The interrupt routines don't use
this part of the code so there isn't any
problem. If, however, you are calling
Basic or KERNAL routines they may
use these routines and it won't work
in this modiﬁed form. An alternative
solution could be:

applies on return in the case o f the
ISRFAR routine. The disadvantage of
this system is that code is overwritten
from address $03F0-$03FC when the
,ISRFAR routine is stored. The code
removed is a D MA routine which is
used for initialising external memory
access. If ever a need for the JSR FAR
code was required, you could patch
it in, execute it, then patch back the
DMACALL routine either by saving
it ﬁrst using a program, or by just
knowing what it is and putting it back.
This code isn't used i n  the normal
running o f the system. You should
obviously select a method that's suited
to your needs.
One ﬁnal thing to  note. These
routines stored in the area $0000 -
$03ff are crucial for the programmer
to be able to access other blocks o f
storage.
Practical uses
We've now covered what registers are
available and what software is avail-
able for use. But what can you do with
it?
With the upgrade to  the system
software, you can now design pro-
grams to  run i n  any R A M  block
accessing any part o f  the available
commodore memory. Before, you may
have thought you were restricted to
just placing programs at certain points
because you required access to certain
ROMS. I've designed programs which
require access to RAM 0, but couldn't
actually be i n  R A M  0  i n  case o f
corruption of the data stored there. An
example o f  this i s th e  L ABEL -
LINKER featured recently in Your
Commodore, This used the available
routines of LDAFAR and STAFAR,
along with the modiﬁed JSRFAR and
JMPFAR of solution
Other possibilities
With so  much control over the
memory, all sorts of new techniques
can be used, and so new programs can
be created. The ability to move the
location o f  page zero and page I
should also broaden your computing
horizons considerably. Yo u  could
move the page I and store information
in memory via the PHA much faster
than the STA command ever could.
One possibility is the concept o f
multitasking machine code programs
making use of the ability to move page
0 and page *I

news or would just like to

First a letter:
Resetting the
C128
I n a recent review of the
Super Snapshot cartridge
(Your Commodore, April
1989), the author noted that
there was no switch to turn
it off. So to switch his Cl28
from 64 to 128 mode, he
had to switch off his
machine and remove the
cartridge. This is also the
case with the Action Replay
cartridge and I imagine
many others, much to the
annoyance of Cl28 owners
everywhere.
While it is technically
possible to add a switch
that would switch out a
cartridge on the C128,
without extra circuitry to
protect the computer
ﬂicking the switch with the
power on could damage the
computer. Perhaps
anything that adds a few
Our regular news letter and general comment spot for
C128 owners
pounds to the cost of the
cartridge purely for the
beneﬁt of Cl28 owners,
isn't considered viable by
the manufacturers!
I saw the Datel advert
for their motherboard -
'switch out any slot', it says.
Great, I thought, just what
need for my Cl28/Action
replay. But, after buying
this, 1 discovered that while
it does switch from one
cartridge to another, it does
it by switching the 5V
power supply to the
cartridge on and off. It
doesn't allow you to go
from C64 mode to Cl28
mode, even with the board
switched to an empty slot.
After a period of
switching off, inplugging
the cartridge and switching
on everytime I used C128
mode, I investigated both
cartridge and C64 manual.
I found that it's easy to
turn off any
cartridge by simply adding
a second switch to the
motherboard.
Pin 9, marked EXROM
in the C64 manual, is the
one that locks the 128 into
64 mode. Inserting a switch
into this track on the
motherboard would make it
possible to switch Out the
motherboard and
cartridges. On Datel's
board, the track from pin 9
conveniently goes to the
underside of the board for a
short distance. At this point
I scraped away part of the
track, soldered two small
wires to each end of the cut
track, and connected these
to a small switch mounted
beside the board's reset
button making pin 9
switchable. Now switching
the Cl28 on with this
switch closed
allows the use of cartridges
in C64 mode as normal.
But turning the computer
on with the switch open
means it powers up in Cl28
mode without having to
remove any cartridges!
Datel's board has some
protection ﬁtted to protect
the computer/cartridge
when switching between
slots, and this may mean
that turning the computer
off when switching between
modes isn't strictly
necessary - I haven't had
any problems anyway.
Switching in this way
may not be in any of the
manuals. but it is cheap,
requires only minimal
soldering, and has been
used by me for a few
months, letting me have the
choice of three cartridges
in C64 mode and use
Cl28 mode without
having to remove
any of them. It
should even

be possible to add a switch
to a cartridge connected
across a cut track from PIN
9, though in this case you
should turn off the
computer before moving
the switch.
Pin 9 is located on the
user port, and is the 9th
from the left on the top row
looking from the front of
the computer - check your
C64 manual for more
information.
Mike Vine, Dagenham.
It does seem a great
idea to modify your
motherboard and cartridges
in this way. I f  you were
really adventurous, you
could break the track to pin
9 inside your Cl28 and put
the switch inside the
computer. However, be
warned - we have been
uriable to try any of the
above alterations out, and
don't forget modifying any
item as indicated would
invalidate any warranty.
Make the modiﬁcations at
your own risk_
If anyone else has
similar modiﬁcations that
can be made to C128s.
please let us know so that
we can pass the information
on.
On the subject of
cartridges, you may like to
hear about the only
cartridge we know of that's
available for use in Cl28
mode. The cartridge is the
Warp Speed cartridge,
available from those Gurus
of everything to do with the
C128 - Financial Systems
Software. The cartridge
offers turbo disk loading, a
machine code monitor and
a host of other features.

software houses probably
haven't even heard of this
wonderful machine. If you
think that there isn't much
128 software, think again -
there's loads of it in the
public domain.
Public Domain software
is a collection of programs
written by various authors
with no desire to make
money from their labours.
The software can be copied
and given to other Cl28
owners, as long as any
information that the
program's author wishes to
be passed on with the
program is.

to be a whole new tv o f  game sp nging
up, games that tell stories but are deﬁnitely not
adventures in the traditional sense. One such title
is Project Fireman from Electronic Arts, written by the
same team that gave you Arcticfox and Skyfox
Horror is the theme behind the plot, coupled with a
setting i n  outer space. Prometheus is a  research ship
sponsored b y  the Space Science Foundation. Th e
experiments conducted o n  this ship involved genetic
manipulation with the aim of producing a form of cheap
labourer for various mining organisations_ The problem is
that the S_S.F. has lost contact with the Prometheus.
Something seems to have gone astray and, as their chief
troubleshooter, it's up to you to see i f you can ﬁnd out
what's gone wrong and restore some sort of order to the
mission_
The game is presented as a sort o f ﬁlm. Thus, while
you are walking round the ship, exploring, the game will
cut to close-ups of various items that it feels are signiﬁcant.
These are usually dead bodies, accompanied by a liberal
helping o f tomato sauce. Whatever the problem is, i t
certainly has a violent streak to it.
To keep you in touch with the plot, the scene will also
fade to show you what's happening elsewhere on the ship.
These scenes are usually connected with a failure in the
cryogenic systems - bodies waking up in cofﬁns, and then
getting ripped limb from limb a few minutes later.
The ship is presented in a mixture of 2 and 3-D views.
As you move close to anything important to the plot, a
text window at the bottom of the screen gives you the option
to carry out simple commands; pick up an object, turn
something on, open a door and so on. This manipulation
of objects is crucial to the game, although it will be some
time before you have much idea of what's going on.
Hindering your progress are a series of diminutive, but
angry, green monsters that appear not to have your best
, interests at heart. They can be zapped with your laser, but
this only has limited power, so you'll need to discover where
the weapons are stored. I found this the weakest part of
the game_ for the simple reason that you often get killed
without being able to do anything in self-defence. Fo r
example, at one point the story cut to another part of the
ship, and when it returned, I was surprised to ﬁnd several
monsters mauling my body! The monsters are best killed
at long range -  they drain too much of your energy when
they touch you, and two ganging up on you with no warning
is invariably fatal.
That apart though, Project Firestart is an interesting

idea, generally well presented. It comes on four sides o f
disk, so there is a lot o f game for your money, even i f
you do have to wait a long time for new locations to load.
The graphics are reasonable, although a bit more description
in the te xt would have added considerably to  the
atmosphere.
Sound is a mixture of effects and tunes t h e  program
always lets you know when the baddies are approaching!
It takes some time to get properly into the game, but it's
certainly worthwhile persevering.

Your chance to air your views in
Your Commodore
H
an Oceanic 118N, I  was
particularly interested to read
Norman Doyle's articles i n  various
editions o f  Your Commodore. A
comment made in that article has me
a little worried. This concerns the
remarks made about ﬂippy disks in the
paragraphs on the Commodore 1570/
71. I  wonder i f the friction damage
caused by turning disks over to use
'side 2' is a problem with the drives
- could it be harmful to my 0C-118N.
If so then there is no economy in
buying double sided disks.
I would be grateful fo r  your
comments on this.
F D A Rocha, London
/
Norman Doyle in the June '88
issue o f Your Commodore most
interesting. Wi th  reference to  his
comments on the 1551:
I have Commodore models C64
with 1541 Disk Drive and a Plus/ 4
with 1551 Disk Drive. Both the Plus/
4 and C16 will accept either type of
disk drive since they are ﬁtted with
the usual 6 - pin DIN sockets for serial
daisy chaining o f peripherals and a
User Port having a  2x 25 contacts
interface, This User Port is NOT the
same as that of the CM. The 1551 drive
has a ﬁtted data transfer lead which
terminates in a custom made cartridge
to lit into the User Port. This cartridge
has a 'through' connection in which
to daisychain o th e r  cartridges,
although I have never seen or heard
of any. Obviously more 1551s could
be used, but I merely plug the 1541
into the alternative serial socket when
I need two drives running. Visually and
physically the 1551 is similar to the
LETTERS
1541 except there is no provision for
daisychaining a 6 pin DIN-connected
printer, but this is unnecessary in view
of the facility being provided on the
Plus/4 and C16. The 'latch' is of the
'turn d o w n  ta b ' similar t o  th e
Excelerator and Blue Chip drives.
Performance comparison was
carried Out by entering a 34 block
(actually 8,515 bytes) data-storage
program from the 1551 drive into the
Plus/4. A timing program - see below-
was entered into the CM and used to
measure the time for the Plus/ 4 to load
the 34 block program. Loading time
was consistently nine seconds ﬁat. The
disk was then transferred to the 1541
for loading into the C64 and the timing
program entered into the Plus/ 4. The
tests were repeated on the 1541 and
loading took 23 seconds. Using these
ﬁgures: 1551 transfers at 9460 baud
compared with 1541 transferring at
3702 baud.
This c l e a r l y  i n d i ca te s a n
improvement o f  nearly 250% when
loading program ﬁles via the 1551.
Speeds may well differ on other disk
operations or ﬁling systems.
The Commodore 1551 disk was
distributed i n  some quantity, b u t
rarely, i f  ever, advertised. I  bought
mine from Green's in Nottingham's
branch of Debenhams late in 1986 for
about E159. They had several dozen
for sale at the time The odd one has
been offered in FOR SALE columns
of various publications.
Although games are not my forte
one must accept that their wide spread
appeal, especially to  the younger
members of society, generates the need
for advertising, and is a  necessary
source o f  income fo r journals and
magazines. Notwithstanding 1 would

and bought an excelerator!
Oh, don't get me wrong, it looks
good, sounded good and loaded all my
games, until I tried to load Defender
of the Crown. Then the cursing began,
crash after crash after crash. Instinct
told me that the Excelerator was at
fault because the game had always
loaded on my 1541 with no aggro.
I rang Evesham Micros to explain
the problems and was informed that,
"Yes, Defender o f the Crown would
not load on the Excelerator drive" -
for a moment I was lost for words!
The dry voice on the phone then
added: "the same applies to  Flying
Shark, they are the only two".
Apparently, Evesham have had to
give away at least one Amiga computer
because o f Defender o f  the Crown,
Although the manager quickly pointed
out how big hearted they had been
because the game did tend to mis-load
occasionally, even on the 1541. He
went on to suggest the fault lay with
the software company, saying that they
were at a loss as to the reason for this.
I then stated that I  was very
unhappy with the situation and was
told that if I sent my copy of Defender
to them (Evesham) they would re-
conﬁgure the software to run on the
Excelerator. The chap did explain that
the Excelerator could not be made
totally co mp a ti b l e  w i t h  t h e
Commodore because copyright laws
would be infringed.

I F
cle on disk drives in the Feb-
ruary issue, the letters have been
ﬂooding in. Now's your chance to set
a few things straight.
Using the reverse side o f a disk
known affectionately as a 'Hippy' disk,
is an established practise, born out of
the need to cut costs. Now that ﬂoppy
disks are cheaply available to the gen-
eral public, the drawbacks become
more obvious:
Because the disk is made to spin
backwards when you turn it over to
use the other side, the increased
friction (you can hear the difference)
must reduce the rotation speed, but
so slightly as not to affect a healthy
drive. The main drawback with ﬂip-
pys, is that spinning them backwards
releases all the dust conveniently
trapped inside the disk's outer sleeve.
Although this is not a major menace,
it tends to make the nippy side less
reliable. I only use ﬂippys for archival

storage, just to save space in my disk

The question of drive compatibility
has reared its ugly head once or twice
already. It's all down to interpretation:
if a manufacturer claims his product
is 'Commodore compatible', it should
be just that! There's no way anyone
can make a truly compatible drive, that
would involve replicating much that
is protected by copyright laws! Com-
petition, however, can't be a had thing
in this case, the customer will beneﬁt
from having a wider choice, after all!
Bear in mind also, Commodore's his-
tory of incompatibility! The 1541 was
not totally compatible with the older
1540 drive, the new 1541C is deﬁnitely
not compatible with the 1541. Even
C64's themselves have undergone de-
sign changes that have caused com-
patibility problems! You can't stop
progress though, and as long as the
software publishers keep abreast o f
these new developments, everybody

Evesham Micros, distributor for
the Excelerator drive, ended up giving
away two Amigas, and their offer of
a conversion job on your unloadable
games still stands. They are quick to
point out that that Defender Of The
Crown originally would load on the
1541C. , The situation was reversed
when the game was modiﬁed! Eve-
sham also point out that the Ex-
celerator loads more games than Com-
modore's own 154IC! Ya  pays ya
money and ya takes ya choice!
Owing to the lack of popularity of
the Plus/4 and CI6 computers, Com-
modore decided to abandon the 1551
drive some time ago. Pity!

Readers Problems
Though the Commodore 64 is one of
the world's most popular microcom-
puters, it can be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd
speciﬁc information about yo u r
particular machine.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we
receive literally hundreds o f  letters
from you, our readers, on a wide range
of subjects ranging from the simple
'Can you give me the telephone
number for...', to the more complex
'I'm trying to write a program that uses
a split screen. How do I do it?'
Unfortunately, the volume of mail
received has become so great that it
is impossible to answer every letter and
still manage to  publish a  magazine
each month.
For this reason we have felt i t
necessary to  produce a  number o f
guidelines fo r  getting information
from us:
I) We cannot guarantee to  answer
every- letter sent t o  the magazine.
Should i t  become apparent that a
number of readers are suffering from
the same problem, then we will reply
to the letter via the Letters page.
2) A new helpline has been set up. This
will be open fo r  your queries o n
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
between 2.00pm and 4.00pm. We will
not be able to deal with our telephone
queries at any other time. If our tech-
nical adviser is not available when you
ring, then a message will be taken.
3) If you are having problems with one
of our listings, can you please let us
know in writing. This will enable us
to see if a number of people are having
the same problem. When a common
problem becomes apparent with a pro-
gram, then a correction sheet will be
issued. Enclose a  self-addressed,
stamped envelope and we will send you
a copy of the correction sheet as soon
as it is available.
We are sorry that it has become
necessary to instigate these rules. How-
ever, we are sure that you will agree
with us that the more time that we
can spend making Your Commodore
the mo st informative magazine
around, the better.
