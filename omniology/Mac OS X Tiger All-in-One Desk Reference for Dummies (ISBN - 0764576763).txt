About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for more than 20 years — pushing comput-
ers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for decades now. His
first love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 1984 when he bought
his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now he spends entirely too
much time on the Internet and drinks far too much caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State University,
Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. However, after
five years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, he decided there must
be a better way to earn a living, and he became the Documentation Manager for
Datastorm Technologies, a well-known communications software developer.
Somewhere in between writing software manuals, Mark began writing computer
how-to books. His first book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 —
and after a short decade or so of fun (disguised as hard work), Mark is one of
the most productive and best-selling technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers
throw at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, design-
ing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — for
Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest computer
games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3-D flights of fancy with
TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of music
imaginable. Mark’s world-wide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at www.
mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, including
everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes iMac For Dummies, 4th Edition;
Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition; CD &
DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, 2nd Edition; Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks; Microsoft
Office v. X Power User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and CDs;
The Hewlett-Packard Official Printer Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Official
Recordable CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Official Digital Photography
Handbook; Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; Teach Yourself the iMac
Visually; Running a Perfect BBS; Official Netscape Guide to Web Animation; and
the Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little Black Book.
His books have been translated into 14 different languages so far — his
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments and questions about his books. You can reach

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my oldest daughter, Erin Chambers — “Version 1.0” —
with all the love and happiness I can give her.
—Mark Chambers


Author’s Acknowledgments
It’s high time I express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped produce
the book you’re holding!
Copious thanks are due (again) to the technical editor, Greg Willmore (along
with his equally Mac-savvy sons Matt and Chris), who checked each and
every word of this Desk Reference for technical accuracy . . . and that, my
friends, is no easy job, especially when you consider that Tiger was in
“squeaky” beta during the development of this book! I was very lucky to
have the help of such a knowledgeable technical editor. Mondo kudos also to
my friend Teresa Artman for her outstanding work as copy editor.
A book of this size places a huge burden on the publisher’s Composition
Services team because those folks have to design over 700 pages and then
prepare both the copy and the high-resolution figures. Again, as in the past,
the work they’ve done is wonderful, and I appreciate the hard work of every-
one on the Composition Services team.
As with all my books, I’d like to thank my wife, Anne, and my children, Erin,
Chelsea, and Rose, for their support and love — and for letting me follow my
dream!
Finally, I turn to the two people at Wiley who literally made this book possi-
ble: my friend Bob Woerner, the acquisitions editor whom I’ve been lucky
enough to know for several years now; and Mark Enochs, my uber-patient
(and remarkably calm) project editor, whom I was lucky enough to work
with for the first time on the Tiger edition of this tome. Their talents and
ongoing assistance made this project a joy instead of a job as they gave me
all the support that every author craves. Many, many thanks to you both
from a very grateful Mac owner!

Introduction
E
legant.
I remember the first moment that I moved a mouse across a Mac OS X
Desktop — at that time, it was the beta of version 10.0 — and I very well
remember the word elegant as my first impression. (My second impression
was UNIX done better.)
That’s really saying something because I’m an old operating system cur-
mudgeon: I cut my computing teeth on Atari, Commodore 64, and TRS-80
Model III machines, and I still feel much at home in the character-based
environment of DOS and UNIX. Of course, I’ve also used every version of
Windows that His Gateness has produced, including the much-improved
Windows XP. And yes, I’ve used Mac OS since before the days of System 7,
using a Macintosh SE with a 9-inch monitor (and a built-in handle).
But out of this host of operating systems, could you really call one elegant
before now? (Even Mac OS 9 didn’t deserve such a description although it
did provide the foundation of convenience and simplicity.) Mac OS X — now
at version 10.4, affectionately called Tiger — is something different: It’s a
fine-cut diamond amongst a handful of semi-precious stones. It’s the result
of an unnatural marriage, I’ll admit . . . the intuitive, graphical world of Mac
OS 9 paired with the character-based stability and efficient multitasking of
UNIX. Who would have thought that they would work together so well? Mac
OS X performs like a Ferrari, and (unbelievably) it looks as good, too.
Therefore, you can imagine just how excited I was to be asked by my friends
at Wiley to write this book and how I immediately jumped at the chance to
write a comprehensive guide to Apple’s masterpiece. The book that you
hold in your hands is a classic For Dummies design — it provides you the
step-by-step instruction (plenty of which my editors agree is humorous) on
every major feature of Mac OS X — but it also goes a step further from time
to time, delving into why something works the way that it does or what’s
going on behind the scenes. You can chalk that up to my sincere admiration
for everyone in Cupertino and what they’ve perfected.
What you won’t find in this Desk Reference is wasted space. All the new 
features of version 10.4 are here, including the latest iChat AV, Dashboard,
Spotlight, the new Automator application, the latest versions of all the iApps
(including GarageBand), and the new incarnations of the Finder and Apple
Mail. Everything’s explained from the ground up, just in case you’ve never

What’s Really Required
2
touched an Apple computer before. By the time you reach the final pages,
you’ll have covered advanced topics such as networking, AppleScript,
Internet security . . . and yes, even an introduction to the powerful world of
UNIX that exists underneath.
I sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy this book and that it will act as your guide
while you discover all the wonderful features of Mac OS X Tiger that I use every
day. Remember, if a Windows-enslaved acquaintance still titters about your
iMac, I’ll understand if you’re tempted to drop this weighty tome on his foot.
The official name of the latest version is (portentous pause here, please)
Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger. But who wants to spit out that mouthful every
time? Throughout this book, I refer to the operating system as Mac OS X, and
when I discuss something that’s particular to the latest version, I call it Tiger.
What’s Really Required
If you’ve got a Mac that’s either running Mac OS X version 10.4 (Tiger) or is
ready to be upgraded to it, you’re set to go. Despite what you might have
heard, you won’t require any of the following:
✦A degree in computer science: Apple designed Mac OS X for regular
people, and I designed this book for people of every experience level.
Even if you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find no hostile waters here.
✦A fortune in software: I do describe additional software that you can
buy to expand the functionality of your Mac; however, that section is
only a few pages long. Everything else covered in this book is included
with Mac OS X Tiger — and by the size of this volume, you get a rough
idea of just how complete Mac OS X is! Heck, many folks buy Macs just
because of the free software you get, like iMovie HD and iPhoto 5.
(Tough cookies to the vast Unwashed Windows Horde.)
✦An Internet connection: Granted, you’re not going to do much with
Apple Mail without an Internet connection, but computers did exist
before the Internet. You can still be productive with Mac OS X without
receiving buckets of spam.
Oh, you will need a set of Mac OS X version 10.4 installation discs, unless
Tiger came pre-installed on your Mac. Go figure.
About This Book
Although this book is a Desk Reference, you can also read it in a linear fashion
(straight-through) — probably not in one session, mind you. (Then again, Diet
Coke is cheap, so it is possible.) The material is divided into seven mini-books,

Conventions Used in This Book

each of which covers an entire area of Mac OS X knowledge. For example,
you’ll find mini-books on networking, the Apple Digital Hub suite of applica-
tions, customizing your Desktop, and Internet-related applications.
Each self-contained chapter discusses a specific feature, application, connec-
tion, or cool thing about Mac OS X. Feel free to begin reading anywhere or
skip chapters at will. For example, if you’re already using an Internet connec-
tion, you won’t need the chapter on adding an Internet connection. However,
I recommend that you read this book from the front to the back, like any
good mystery novel. (Watch out, oncoming spoiler: For those that want to
know right now, Bill Gates did it.)
Conventions Used in This Book
Even For Dummies books have to get technical from time to time, usually
involving commands that you have to type and menu items that you have to
click. If you’ve read any of my other For Dummies books, you’ll know that a
helpful set of conventions is used to indicate what needs to be done or what
you see onscreen.
Stuff you type
When I ask you to type a command or enter something in a text field (like

In case you’re curious about computers
No one expects a book in the For Dummies series to contain techno-jargon 
or ridiculous computer science semantics — especially a book about the
Macintosh, which has always strived for simplicity and user-friendliness. I
hereby promise that I’ll do my absolute best to avoid unnecessary techno-talk.

How This Book Is Organized
4
For those who are interested in what’s happening under the hood, I provide
sidebars that explain a little more about what’s doing what to whom. If you’d
rather just have fun and ignore the digital dirty work, please feel free to disre-
gard these additions (but don’t tear sidebars out of the book because there’s
likely to be important stuff on the opposite side of the page).
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve done my best to emulate the elegant design of Mac OS X by organizing
this book into seven mini-books, with cross-references where appropriate.
Book I: Introducing Mac OS X
This mini-book begins with an invigorating chapter explaining exactly why
you should be so happy to be a Mac OS X owner. Then I provide an introduc-
tion to the basic tasks that you’ll perform — things like copying files, run-
ning programs, and the like. Because Sherlock 3 and the Address Book are
such important elements of Mac OS X, I also cover them in this mini-book.
You’ll also find coverage of Tiger’s new Spotlight search engine, a guide to
normal Mac OS X maintenance and troubleshooting, and instructions on
using the Mac OS X Help system.
Book II: Customizing and Sharing
Who wants to stick with the defaults? The material in this mini-book leads
you through the steps that you need to customize Mac OS X to your specific
needs and desires . . . everything from a tweak to your background or screen
saver to a description of how to set up and administer multiple accounts on
a single Macintosh. You’ll also find coverage of the different settings that you
can change in System Preferences, which is an important place in Mac OS X.
Book III: The Digital Hub
Sweet! This mini-book jumps right in among the crown jewels of the Digital
Hub: iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, QuickTime, GarageBand, and the DVD
Player. Taken as a suite, these applications allow you to plug in and use all
sorts of electronic gadgets, including digital cameras, digital video (DV) cam-
corders, and MP3 players — plus, you can edit or create your own DVDs,
audio CDs, and movies.
Book IV: The Typical Internet Stuff
This mini-book contains just what it says. But then again, it’s easy to get
enthusiastic about Apple Mail, the latest version of Apple’s instant messag-
ing application (iChat AV), and the online storage provided by iDisk. I also

Icons Used in This Book

cover Safari, Apple’s hot-rod Web browser. Finally, you’ll discover more
about the built-in Internet firewall and how you can use it to safeguard your
Mac from Internet undesirables.
Book V: Networking in Mac OS X
Ethernet, Bluetooth, Bonjour, and AppleTalk are lurking in this mini-book. 
I explain them step-by-step, in language that a normal human being can
understand. Find out how to use wireless networks like AirPort Extreme
from Apple as well as how to share an Internet connection with other com-
puters in a local network.
Book VI: Expanding Your System
Time to take things up a notch. In this mini-book, I discuss the hardware and
software that everyone’s adding to Mac OS X and why you might (or might
not) need such toys. Memory (RAM), hard drives, printers, USB, and the
newest FireWire 800 . . . they’re all discussed here in detail. Consider this a
banquet of expansion information.
Book VII: Advanced Mac OS X
I know that I told you earlier that I was going to avoid techno-talk whenever
possible, yet I also mentioned the advanced things that you’ll find in this
mini-book, like using UNIX within Mac OS X and using Automator to build
your own custom script applications that handle repetitious tasks. If you
don’t mind immersing yourself in all that’s technical, read here for the
skinny on hosting a Web site and communicating with Mac OS X by using
your voice and your handwriting.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are more than just attractive — they’re also important
visual cues for stuff that you don’t want to miss.
Okay, so Mark’s Maxims aren’t marked with an icon, per se. However, they
represent way-important stuff, so I call your attention to these nuggets in
bold, like this:
Something Really Important Is Being Said that will likely affect your
person in the near future. Pay attention, commit those Maxims to
memory, and you’ll avoid the pitfalls that the rest of us have hit on
the way.™

Icons Used in This Book
6
The Tip icons flag short snippets of information that will save you time or
trouble (and, in some cases, even cash).
These icons highlight optional technical information for folks like me. If you
also used to disassemble alarm clocks for fun when you were 6 years old,
you’ll love this stuff.
Always read this information next to this icon first! Something looms ahead
that could put your hardware or software at risk.
Look to the Remember icons for those tidbits that you need to file away in
your mind. Just remember to remember.
Follow these road signs for all the cool updates and innovations in Mac OS X
version 10.4 Tiger.

t’s human nature to require instant gratification from your software.
I’ve seen it countless times: Someone runs a program, immediately feels
comfortable with it, and then spends the rest of his days using that program
religiously. Or another person plays with the same program for 120 seconds
and dismisses it as too difficult or too confusing. It’s rather like watching a
fancy fashion show runway in Rome or Paris: There had better be eye appeal
pretty quickly, or the bucks won’t flow.
Ditto for modern computer operating systems. An operating system is the
basic software that determines the look and feel of your entire computer
and usually extends to the programs that you run as well. Microsoft felt the
pinch of an old-fashioned operating system when Windows 98 and Windows
Me were starting to appear rather plain-looking. MS promptly released
Windows XP, where menus fade in and out like fireflies on a summer night,
little puppies help you find files, and animation abounds. To be honest, how-
ever, updating a PC by upgrading to Windows XP is a little like putting on a
polyester sports coat over the same tired old T-shirt and jeans — most of
what changes is on the outside.
Apple doesn’t work that way. Sure, Mac OS X looks doggone good. Forget the
minimum requirement of shirt and shoes because this operating system is
wearing an Armani suit. What’s really exciting for Macintosh owners around
the world, however, is the heart that beats beneath the pretty form. Mac OS X
is quite literally an operating system revolution, delivering some of the most
advanced features available on any personal computer in use today while
remaining as easy to use as the first Macintosh. (And yes, I do own, use, and
enjoy both PCs and Macs — what’s important to me is which computer does
the job the fastest in the easiest manner.)

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Now, I’m not going to just haul off and proclaim that Mac OS X can run rings
around — well . . . you know, the W word — without solid proof. In this chap-
ter, I introduce you to the advantages of Mac OS X and why it’s such a step
ahead for those running Windows. I also cover the hardware requirements
that you’ll need to run Mac OS X version 10.4 (Tiger) as well as guidelines on
switching from Windows. Finally, I familiarize you with the steps that you’ll
encounter the first time that you fire up the Big X.
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Apple pioneered the graphical approach to computing with the appearance
of the first Macintosh, so you’d expect Mac OS X to be simple to use — and
indeed it is. For many folks, that’s Job One. If you’re one of those people,
you can happily skip this section without need of further evidence because
Mac OS X is undoubtedly the easiest operating system on the planet to use.
(And believe me, I’m not knocking simplicity. Computers are supposed to be
getting easier to use, and techno-nerds like me are supposed to be rendered
unnecessary as computers advance.) Here is the mantra of the Mac — and
the first of Mark’s Maxims for this volume:
One Mouse, One Button, One King.™
Still with me? Need more testimony? Or perhaps you’re just curious about
the engine under the hood. Then read on — and if you’re a Macintosh owner,
feel free to gloat! (If you’re a PC owner, there’s always eBay.)
Pretty to behold
Let me illustrate with a screenshot or two: Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical
screen from a day spent in Mac OS v. 9.2, the capable — albeit rather 
old-fashioned — version of the Mac OS operating system that shipped 
in the days before Mac OS X.
Compare that screen with a similar screen from the latest version of the Big X,
as shown in Figure 1-2. As you can see, everything’s streamlined in appear-
ance, with maximum efficiency in mind. Tasteful 3-D abounds, from the 
drop-shadowed windows to the liquid-look scroll bars. Icons look like minia-
ture works of art. Macintosh owners appreciate outstanding design — and
can recognize the value of a great computer, even if it is lime-green (or looks
like half of a white basketball). After all, many Mac owners are professionals
in the graphic arts, and Apple provides the hardware that they need — like
the top-of-the-line, liquid crystal display (LCD) used with the 20" flat-panel
iMac G5 or the killer performance of the latest Power Mac G5 with dual
processors (liquid-cooled processors, no less).
Take a look at what’s going on behind the curtain — the Great Oz is actually
pretty busy back there.

The allure of Aqua
The Apple software developers who introduced us to Mac OS X designed
this new look from the ground up. They call it Aqua, and it’s Tiger’s standard
user interface.
Whoops, I just realized that I slipped a ten-cent example of techno-babble
into that previous paragraph. Let me explain: A user interface design deter-
mines how things look throughout both the operating system itself and all
applications that are written to run under an operating system (OS). This
includes the buttons that you push, the controls that you click or move, and
even the appearance of the windows and menus themselves. For example, if
you’ve already begun to use Mac OS X, you’ve probably stopped right in the
middle of a task and exclaimed to yourself, “Why, Self, look at that cool 3-D
contour effect on that menu bar!” That shapely contour is a tiny part of the
Aqua user interface design.
Aqua also extends to the placement of controls and how they’re shown to
you. For example:
✦Mac OS X uses Aqua sheets (which are attached to their parent dialogs
and windows) to prompt you for input, like confirming when you’re
about to close a document without saving it. Unlike Windows, multiple
programs can have multiple sheets open, so you can continue to work
in other applications without being rudely forced to answer the query
immediately.
✦Aqua’s file selection controls, like the one in Figure 1-3, make it much
easier to quickly navigate to a specific file or folder from within an 
application.
✦The Dock is another Aqua addition, replacing some of the functions of
the old Control Strip and the Launcher from Mac OS 9. The Dock launches
your favorite applications, indicates what’s running on your Mac, and
allows you to switch between those programs — and all in a strip that
you can relocate and customize at will. I talk about the Dock in greater
detail later in Book II, Chapter 2.
Consider Aqua as the look-and-feel of Mac OS X and virtually all applications
that it runs; you’ll discover how to use these Aqua controls in the pages to
come. Of course, Mac owners really don’t have to worry about Aqua itself; the
Aqua guidelines are a roadmap for those writing applications for Mac OS X.
Programs written to the common Aqua interface standard will be easier for
you to use, and you’ll become a proficient power user of that program much
faster.

The quality of Quartz
The second ingredient in the visual feast that is Mac OS X is Quartz Extreme —
again, I must ask your forgiveness, good reader, because I have to get a 
tad technical again. Quartz Extreme is a graphics engine: It’s the portion 
of Mac OS X that draws what you see on the screen (in the Aqua interface,
natch). Think of the engine in your car, which is responsible for making your
car move. Whether your Mac is running Microsoft Word or simply idling at
the Desktop waiting for you to finish your soda, Quartz Extreme is at work
displaying icons, drawing shapes, exhibiting the Finder, and animating things
in the Dock.
What sets Quartz Extreme apart from the ho-hum graphics engine that
Windows uses? It’s all about international programming standards . . . you
know, those things that Microsoft would much rather that you forget. To wit:
✦PDF: The Quartz Extreme engine is built around the Acrobat Portable
Document Format (PDF for short) developed by Adobe. If you’ve been
spending any time at all on the Internet in the last two or three years,
you know that PDF files have emerged as the standard for displaying
and printing the highest-quality electronic documents. Plus, Adobe has
released a version of the free Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com) for just
about every computer on this green Earth. This means that text and
graphics displayed in Quartz Extreme are razor sharp, resizable, and easily
Figure 1-3:
A typical file

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
14
portable from one computer to another. In fact, Mac OS X displays PDF files
without even requiring Acrobat, using the built-in Preview application.
Figure 1-4 shows a complex PDF document that I opened in Mac OS X.
✦OpenGL: Gamers will get really excited about this one: Quartz Extreme
also uses the OpenGL graphics acceleration standard, which delivers the
fastest 3-D graphics on the planet. (Think photo-realistic, high-resolution
graphics drawn in the blink of an eye.) In fact — and this is a really cool
trick — if you have an advanced 3-D card, OpenGL is even used to produce
the Desktop in Mac OS X Tiger.
In English, that means that today’s top-of-the-line, 3-D gaming and 3-D
graphics acceleration can take care of drawing everything; forget about
waiting for windows to close or menus to appear, even when you’re cre-
ating the world’s biggest honking spreadsheet or building a presentation
the size of Baltimore. As the Chairman of the Board would say, “We’re
talkin’ fast, baby, like a rocket ship to the moon!”

Yep, that’s a

ment, not a

Stable, stable, stable
“So it’s elegant in design. That’s great, Mark, but what if Mac OS X crashes?
Aqua and Quartz Extreme aren’t worth a plug nickel if my mouse doesn’t
move and I lose my document!” Believe me, I couldn’t agree more; I make my
living from computers, and every time that a misbehaving program locks up
one of my machines, I throw a tantrum that would make Godzilla back off.
Lockups shouldn’t be tolerated in this day and age . . . and, unfortunately,
Mac OS 9 crashed almost as often as Windows 98.
Luckily, the folks who designed Mac OS X were just as interested in producing
a rock-solid operating system as they were in designing an attractive look.
(Think of Tom Cruise’s face on The Rock’s body.)
Mac OS X is as hard to crash as the legendary UNIX operating system — that’s
right, the same reliable workhorse that techno-wizards around the world use
to power the Internet, where stability is all-important. In fact, Mac OS X is actu-
ally built on top of a UNIX base. It’s just well hidden underneath, allowing you
and me to focus on our programs and click with a mouse without learning
any of those obscure, arcane keyboard commands. You get the benefits of
UNIX without a pair of suspenders, a pocket protector, or the hassle of grow-
ing a beard. (Not to mention years of computer programming experience.)
Don’t forget QuickTime!
If you’ve recorded or edited digital video (DV),
you’re probably already familiar with Apple’s
QuickTime MOV format. QuickTime movies are
high-resolution, relatively small in size, and
easily created with iMovie HD, which I discuss
in Book III, Chapter 4. Although QuickTime isn’t
“on stage” all the time like Aqua or Quartz
Extreme, it’s still an important part of Mac OS X:
Every time you display a video clip that you’ve
recorded or watch a streaming TV broadcast
from a Web site, you use QuickTime. (Note,
however, that you don’t use QuickTime to watch
DVD movies — that job is reserved for the
Apple DVD Player.) And hold the phone: Tiger
adds support for AVC (Advanced Video Coding)
for the best possible display of the latest HD
(High Definition) video signals from the expen-
sive hardware that’s now appearing at your
local electronics Maze o’ Wires chain store.
QuickTime is actually not a new Mac OS X 
feature — it’s been around since the days of
Mac OS 8 — but the latest versions of Mac OS X
includes the free QuickTime Player, which pro-
vides support for the latest broadcast and Web
video. In fact, you can set up your own TV sta-
tion on the Web with the tools included in the
Professional QuickTime package.

Apple calls this UNIX foundation at the heart of Mac OS X by another nifty
title: Darwin. I could tell you that Darwin provides the latest in 64-bit
memory support and CPU management, but if you’re a normal human being,
your eyes will glaze over. Suffice it to say that Darwin makes the best use
of your computer’s memory (RAM) and your computer’s brain (CPU). Rest
assured that your Web server will stay up even if your misbehaving Virtual
Birdcalling simulation decides to run amok. (Emus running amok . . . how
dreadful.)
Yes, yet another standard is at work here — uh-oh, Overlord Gates is truly
angry now! For those who do have a beard and are curious about such things,
Darwin uses a FreeBSD kernel, so it also inherits all the protocol standards
that have made UNIX the foundation of today’s Internet. You can find more
about FreeBSD at www.freebsd.org. Because Mac OS X is developed as an
open source project, software engineers outside Apple can actually con-
tribute ideas and code, just like UNIX continues to evolve over time. (And
yes, you’ll even discover how to access the UNIX command prompt from
Mac OS X later in Book VII, Chapter 1!)
To get an idea of just how well-armored Mac OS X is, consider Figure 1-5. See
how one program, which I call Titanic 1.0, has locked up like San Quentin.
Under Mac OS 9, your only chance at recovering anything would involve
divine intervention. However, in Mac OS X, my Pages application is unaffected
because it has a completely protected area of system memory to play in.
Hint: I show you how to force a misbehaving application to go away a little
later in Book I, Chapter 3.
By the way, Darwin makes it easy for UNIX software developers to quickly
and easily port (or modify) all sorts of UNIX applications to work under 
Mac OS X. I think that you’ll agree that a wider selection of applications 
is a good thing.

Multitasking and multithreading 
for normal human beings
And now, for your entertainment, a short one-act play. (Yes, really.)
A Shakespearean Moment of Multitasking and Multithreading
Our play opens with Julius Caesar shaking his head in disgust at his Mac OS 9
Desktop.
Caesar: Anon, I am only one mortal, yet my Desktop doth abound with por-
tals to applications of all different mien. Tell me, foul beast, why thy spirit
seems slow and sluggish, and my Excel spreadsheet doth crawl on its belly!
[Enter Romeo, a cocky and rather brash young Apple software developer.]
Romeo: Dude, the problem is, like, your operating system. Y’see, older
versions of Mac OS ended up constantly, like, shifting your computer’s
attention from one app to another — Excel has to cooperate with every-
thing else that’s running in the background, like a good little corporate
boy. It’s less efficient and very, very ’90s. Upgrade to Mac OS X, and you
get pre-emptive multitasking — the app you’re actually using, like, gets
the lion’s share of the processing time, and everything runs smoother
when you need it. That’s the way UNIX works.
Caesar: Verily, your strange tongue doth annoy me. Guards, behead
him — then obtain for me this Mac OS X.
Romeo: I’m outta here — I’ve got a hot date — but don’t forget, like,
Mac OS X also uses multithreaded processing, so your Mac can handle 
different operating system tasks at the same time. It’s kind of like your
computer can both walk and chew gum at the same time: fast, fast, fast!
[Exit Romeo — rather swiftly — stage right.]
Fin
As the play closes, we can only hope that Romeo is fast as well. (I told you it
was a short play.)
The definition of Internet-savvy
Remember the classic iMac advertisements that touted the one-plug approach
to the Internet? That entire campaign was centered on one idea: that the
Internet was supposed to be easy to use. The folks at Microsoft sat up and
took notice when the iMac proved so incredibly successful, and Windows XP

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
18
actually reduced some of the overwhelming folderol that you had to encounter
just to connect to the Internet — but Mac OS X still wipes the floor with XP
when it comes to easy and complete Internet connectivity. For example:
✦Easy configuration: Mac OS X sets up your entire Internet connection
with a simple wizard of four screens. As long as you’ve got the right
information handy (which your Internet service provider [ISP] should
supply), it’s a snap to set up.
✦iDisk: What if I told you that for a reasonable yearly subscription fee,
Apple can provide you with a chunk of Internet-accessible, private hard
drive space — and that you can access this hard drive space from any-
where on Earth with an Internet connection? Absolutely, unbelievably,
massively cool. This neat trick is called iDisk, and I cover it later in detail
in Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦All the Internet behind-the-scenes stuff: The Internet is basically built on
a number of protocols (read that as rules for exchanging all sorts of data) —
and, as I mention earlier, UNIX machines dominate the Internet. Ergo,
adding Mac OS X to your Macintosh also provides you with support for
just about every Internet protocol on the planet. Even if you don’t know
them by name or write your own software, the applications that you buy
can use them.
✦A gaggle of great Internet applications: Mac OS X ships with all sorts of
Internet magic built in. For example, there’s Sherlock — a supercharged
search program that also acts as a doorway to information channels,
which I discuss in Book I, Chapter 5. You also get instant Internet and
local network communication with iChat AV (which I cover in Book IV,
Chapter 3), Safari (covered in Book IV, Chapter 5), and Apple Mail, a 
standard-issue, battle-ready e-mail program (which I discuss in Book IV,
Chapter 2). Yup, it’s all free.
✦And Apache, sweet Apache: Friends, as a Webmaster myself, I can tell
you that I was visibly moved — well, at least exceptionally excited —
when I learned that Mac OS X included the industry-standard Apache Web
server, which runs over half of the sites on the Web! (Yep, that includes
www.apple.com.) Get all the details in Book VII, Chapter 4.
Lots of free goodies
You don’t just get Internet applications when you latch your fingers onto a
box o’ Mac OS X — you can start doing all sorts of neat stuff without invest-
ing one extra dollar in more software!

Remember, what you receive along with Mac OS X depends on whether
you’re buying a boxed copy, upgrading from an older version of Mac OS, or
receiving the Big X already installed on a new Macintosh. With that in mind,
check out the possibilities.
✦This is the iLife: This suite of easy-to-use integrated programs is practically
as well known as the Macintosh itself these days: iDVD, iPhoto, iTunes,
GarageBand, and iMovie HD. Each of these stellar programs is covered in
full in Book III. If you’ve got a digital camera, an MP3 player, a USB musical
keyboard, or a DV camcorder, you’re going to be a very happy individual.
I promise.
✦AppleWorks: If you’ve bought a new Macintosh with Mac OS X pre-
installed, you’ve also received AppleWorks (Apple’s answer to Microsoft
Office). Good stuff, indeed. If you don’t want to spend the bucks on Office
2004 and you don’t need the complex gewgaws and baroque architecture
of Word and Excel, I can guarantee you that AppleWorks is powerful
enough to satisfy your office productivity yearnings.
✦The obligatory games: Apple couldn’t have picked two games that are a
better match: the finger-exercising arcade challenge of Marble Blast Gold
and the immersive 3-D fun of Nanosaur 2. Because this book isn’t a game
guide, I leave you to explore these two programs at your leisure.
Naturally, there are others that I haven’t mentioned here — in fact, bundled
programs like Quicken for Mac have entire For Dummies books devoted to
them — but that gives you a taste of what’s included.
It even runs the old stuff
Convinced yet? Before I go, I should mention one more outstanding feature
of Mac OS X that will undoubtedly please dyed-in-the-wool Mac users: When
properly configured, the Big X can run virtually all software written for older
versions of Mac OS 8 and 9! (It’s rather like Windows XP running Windows 98
programs without the hassle and the deluge of error messages.) The good
folks at Cupertino are sharp enough to ensure that you can run legacy soft-
ware if necessary. These applications are called Classic programs; to run a
Classic application, Mac OS X actually launches a virtual Mac OS 9 session.
If you’re a new Mac owner, you can promptly forget about this feature —
everything that you’ll be buying and using from now on will be written for
the Big X, and the latest Mac models no longer include Mac OS 9.2. (It’s kind
of like an appendix.)

What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
20
What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
I’ve written six other For Dummies books — I know, it’s getting to be a habit
(and a career) — and I always find the “Hardware Requirements” section a
hard one to write. Why? Well, I know what Apple claims as the minimum hard-
ware requirements necessary to run Mac OS X. But, on the other hand, I know
what I would consider the minimum hardware requirements, and they’re
substantially different. Oh, well, let me list the bare bones, and then I’ll give
you my take on what you really need. (Naturally, if Mac OS X Tiger is already
pre-installed on your computer, feel free to tear out this page and create a
handful of celebratory confetti.)
From The World According to Jobs, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: You’ll need any Mac with a G3, G4, or G5 processor —
except for older Macs without internal FireWire hardware and a DVD
drive (these older machines aren’t supported in Mac OS X Tiger). Other
than those exceptions, this means that just about any iMac, eMac, Mac
Mini, iBook, Power Mac G3/G4/G5 is technically eligible to play (although
you might find the performance of a G3 running Tiger to be unacceptable).
I should also mention that Mac OS X doesn’t support most third-party
CPU upgrade cards out of the box. Again, note that you’ll need a DVD
drive to install Tiger.
✦RAM: You’ll need at least 128MB of memory (RAM). At today’s low
prices, that’s like buying a pizza.
✦Hard drive territory: Although svelte by Windows standards, Mac OS X
still needs about 2GB of free space on your hard drive.
From The World According to Chambers, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: I recommend a Mac with at least a 500 MHz G4 processor.
Remember, this is my take on what you’ll need to really take advantage
of Mac OS X Tiger, and again, I have to say that I don’t think it performs
well enough on older, slower G3 computers. Of course, if your Mac is
lucky enough to sport a G5 processor, it can use Mac OS X to run rings
around a pokey Pentium 4 PC.
✦RAM: Don’t settle for anything less than 512MB. Again, with memory as
cheap as it is these days, this is like adding extra cheese to that pizza.
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
Any techno-nerd worth the title will tell you that the single most
important key to performance in today’s operating systems is RAM —
yep, it’s actually more effective than a faster processor!™

If you’ve got any extra spending cash in between your sofa cushions,
spend it on RAM. (Up to an Earth-shaking 8GB of RAM on the latest
Power Mac G5 racehorses!)
✦Hard drive territory: I’d recommend having 4GB free.
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Because the installation of Mac OS is as simple as loading a DVD and double-
clicking an icon, there’s not much to tell. What’s important is the steps that
you should take care of before you start the installation. I cover those in the
next section. Pay heed, or pay later. I won’t go into detail about the actual
installation because there really aren’t any details to speak of — you’ll answer
a question or two, and then hop up to get another cup of coffee or another
caffeine-laden soda while the installer does the rest. Would anyone expect
any different from Apple?
Back up — PLEASE back up
I know you’re anxious to join the In crowd, and Apple makes the upgrade
process as non-invasive and as safe as possible, but SNAFUs like power loss
and hard drive failures do happen. With a full backup of your system on CD
or DVD (or even to an external hard drive), you can rest assured that you’ll
get your precious files and folders back in pristine shape if tragedy strikes.
To be honest, you need to back up your system on a regular basis anyway.
Promise me now that you’ll back up your system, won’t you?
I recommend a good commercial back-up program like Retrospect Backup
from Dantz Development Corporation (www.dantz.com).
Snuff out disk errors
Before you upgrade, I recommend using the Mac OS 9 Disk First Aid utility
one last time — upgrading a disk with errors will take longer. You’ll find Disk
First Aid in the Utility folder.
On the plus side, Mac OS X comes with its own disk check-up program,
called Disk Utility, which I cover later in the book in Book I, Chapter 7.
Ain’t technology grand?
Plug it, Road Warrior
You’re on the road with your iBook, and you’ve just bought your copy of
Mac OS X. You’re thinking of installing your brand-spanking new operating
system. . . . Stop! NOW.

Personalizing the Big X
22
Before you decide to upgrade your Mac notebook, consider what will happen
if that magical vessel containing all your files should flicker and. . . . No, on
second thought, don’t even visualize it. (Even if the battery is fully charged.)
If you’re installing a Mac OS X upgrade on a PowerBook or an iBook, make
sure that it’s plugged in and receiving its share of good, clean AC power from
a handy, nearby wall socket. The installation process could take an hour, and
there’ll be constant hard drive and DVD drive activity — think “Attack of the
Energy Draining Installation from Planet Lithium.” You don’t want to try this
while your notebook is operating on battery power.
Heck, a techno-purist would probably recommend that you attach your
Macintosh to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the installation
process, but I’m not quite that paranoid about power outages.
Keep one thing in mind while installing Mac OS X: If you format the destina-
tion drive — the drive where you’ll install Mac OS X — you’ll lose everything
that it stored. No big surprise there, and the installation program will warn
you profusely about this beforehand. There’s really no reason to do so unless
you just crave a clean installation (an installation of a new operating system
on a newly formatted drive, compared with an upgrade of your existing Mac
OS System files). Oh, and don’t forget to use Mac OS Extended format.
Personalizing the Big X
After the installation has completed and you’ve rebooted the beast, stand back
and watch those beautiful rounded edges, brushed stainless steel surfaces,
and liquid colors appear. But wait — you’re not quite done yet! Mac OS X
needs to be personalized for you, just like your toothbrush or your SUV’s six-
way power seat; therefore, use the Setup Wizard that automatically appears
the first time that you boot Mac OS X Tiger.
Pet peeve number 1 . . .
The round object that you load into your CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM drive is a disc, not a disk, like your
hard drive or that flimsy floppy that the Windows
horde still uses. Anyone who pretends to talk
oh-so-knowingly about a CD-ROM disk or DVD
disk is a dweeb, and you should steer as far
away from that dweeb as possible in the future.

These wizard screens change periodically — and they’re completely 
self-explanatory — so I won’t march you through each one step by step.
However, here are a few tips that will provide a bit of additional over-the-
shoulder help while you’re setting things up.
✦How rude! If you’re outside the United States or other English-speaking
countries, you should know that Mac OS X defaults to US formats and
keyboard layouts. Rest assured, though, because Mac OS X does indeed
provide full support for other languages and keyboard configurations.
To display these options in the list boxes, click the Show All button at
the bottom of the wizard screen.
✦Accounts are important. When Mac OS X asks you to create your
account, don’t forget your password — oh, and they’re case-sensitive,
too, so THIS is different from this or ThiS. It’s a good idea to enter a pass-
word hint, but don’t make that hint too easy to guess. For example, My
first dog’s name is probably preferable to Plays Seinfeld on TV. Mac OS X
will use the name and password that you enter to create your account,
which you’ll use to log in if you set up a multi-user system for several
people. (More on this later in Book II, Chapter 4.) Never write down your
passwords, either; such crib sheets work just as well for others as for you.
✦I need to fix that. You can click the Back button at any time to return
to previous wizard screens. Mac OS X, being the bright child that it is,
automatically saves your choices for you, so when you click Continue to
return, everything is as you left it.
✦Extra stuff. Whether you decide to accept the news, offers, and related-
product information from Apple is your decision. However, it’s only right
that I point out that you can find this same information on the Apple Web
site, so there’s no need to engorge your e-mail Inbox unless you so desire.
(In other words, I turned this off.)
✦Local area network (LAN) connections. If you’re connecting your Mac
to a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network
(or you’re using an Internet router that uses Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol [DHCP]), it’s a good idea to click Yes when you’re asked whether
you should use the configuration supplied by the existing server.
DHCP automatically provides the computers on the network with all the
settings that they need to connect. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian,
find out more in Book V, Chapter 1.
✦Do create your .Mac account! Apple’s .Mac service just plain rocks —
especially the iDisk storage that you receive. Again, more on this in
Book IV, Chapter 4, but take my word for it. Join up, trooper. (The trial
subscription is free, and it’s easy to upgrade to a full membership if you
decide that you like the .Mac benefits.)

Personalizing the Big X
24
✦Have your Mail settings handy. If you set up your trial .Mac account,
you can set up your @mac.com address without any bother — again, this
is A Good Thing. However, if you’re setting up an existing account, make
sure you have all those silly settings and numbers and names that your
ISP supplied you with when you signed up. This stuff includes your e-mail
address, mail server variety, user account ID, password, and outgoing
mail server.

s the folks in Cupertino will tell you, “It’s all about the graphics.”
They’re right, of course — Mac OS X is a highly visual operating system,
and using it without a mouse is like building Hoover Dam with a pocketknife.
(And not a particularly sharp pocketknife, either.) Therefore, most of this
chapter will require you to firmly grasp the little rodent — I introduce you
to little graphical bits like icons and menus, and you discover how to open
windows that can display anything from the contents of a document to the
contents of your hard drive.
On the other hand, any true Macintosh power user will tell you that the key-
board is still a useful piece of hardware. Because I want you to be a bona fide,
well-rounded Mac OS X power user, I also demonstrate those key combina-
tions that can save you time, effort, and possible tennis elbow from all that
mouse-wrangling.

Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
26
Finally, I lead you through the basic training that you’ll need to run your pro-
grams: how to start them, how to open and save documents, and how to quit
an application as gracefully as Fred Astaire on his best day.
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
First things first. As the guy on the rocket sled probably yelled, “This is neat,
but how do you stop it?” Call ’em The Big Three — Sleep, Restart, and Shut
Down are the Mac OS X commands that you use when you need to take care
of other business. All three appear on the friendly Apple menu (Ú) at the
top-left corner of your Desktop (as shown in friendly Figure 2-1).
Each of these options produces a different reaction from your Mac:
✦Sleep: There’s no need for a glass of water or a bedtime story when you
put Mac OS X to Sleep, which is a power-saving mode that allows you to
quickly return to your work later. (“Waking up” from Sleep mode is much
faster than booting or restarting your computer, and it can conserve bat-
tery power on laptops.) Depending on the settings that you choose in
System Preferences — which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3 — your Mac
can power-down the monitor and spin-down the hard drives to save
wear and tear on your hardware. You can set Mac OS X to automatically
enter Sleep mode after a certain amount of inactivity. To awaken your
slumbering supercomputer, just click the mouse or press any key on the
keyboard. PowerBook and iBook owners can typically put their laptops
to sleep by simply closing the computer, and wake the beast by opening
it back up again.
✦Restart: Use Restart if your Mac has suddenly decided to work “outside
of the box” and begins acting strangely — for instance, if your Universal
Serial Bus (USB) ports suddenly lock up or your FireWire drive no longer
responds. Naturally, you’ll need to save any work that’s open. You also
elect to restart Mac OS X when you switch start-up volumes. (Many
applications and Apple software updates require a restart after you
install them.)
✦Shut Down: When you’re ready to return to the humdrum, real world
and you’re done with your Mac for the time being, use the Shut Down
option. Well-behaved Mac applications will automatically prompt you to
save any changes that you’ve made to open documents before the com-
puter actually turns itself off. If you’ve configured your Mac with multiple
accounts, you can shut down Mac OS X from the login screen as well.

Besides the Apple menu command, many Macs have a Power key on the 
keyboard that you can press to display the dialog that you see in Figure 2-2.
If you change your mind and decide to tie up loose ends before you leave,
click the Cancel button to return to Mac OS X.
If your Mac has a Drive Open key that you use to load and eject discs (like
the new G5 iMacs and G5 Power Macs), you can hold down the Control key
and press the Drive Open key to display the same options.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
“And in the beginning, there was the window.” Like older Mac operating 
systems, most of what you’ll do in Mac OS X occurs within these fancy rec-
tangular frames. And, as you might imagine, a number of controls are at
your disposal that you can use to control the size, shape, and appearance of
these potent portals. In this section, I’ll — well, to be blunt, I’ll do windows.
(No squeegee jokes, if you please.)
Opening and closing windows
Windows are generally opened automatically. Usually, a window gets opened
by an application (when you first run it or it needs to display a document) or
by Mac OS X itself (when the Finder opens a window to display the contents
of your hard drive). The Finder, by the way, is the application that Mac OS X
runs to display the operating system’s menus and windows.
Some programs even let you open new windows on the fly: For example,
Figure 2-3 illustrates a window in its purest form: a new Finder window. To
display this window on your own Mac, choose File➪New Finder Window or
press Ô+N. From here, you can reach any file on your Mac or even venture
onto the Internet.
Actually, we’re not finished just yet. . . .
I should probably also mention the other guys:
the Log Out command (which you can find
under the Apple menu) and the User Switch
menu (at the right side of the Finder menu).
 Choose Log Out when you’re running your
Mac with multiple users and you want to
completely pass control over to another
person. All your programs will quit, and 
the other person can take over by logging
in with his/her account. Mac OS X then
reconfigures itself with the other user’s
preferences.
 If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching,
another user can log in from the User Switch
menu. However, your applications do not
quit, you don’t have to formally log out, and
you can take control back when the other
user is finished. (Hence the words Fast and
Switching in the name.) To turn on this fea-
ture, display the Accounts panel in System
Preferences, click Login Options, and then
select the Enable Fast User Switching check
box. (More on Fast User Switching appears
in Book II, Chapter 4.)

The Command key has both an Apple (Ú) and a rather strange-looking
symbol (Ô) on it that I often call the Spirograph.
When you’re finished with a document or you no longer need a window
open, you can close it to free that space on your Desktop. To close a window
in Mac OS X, move your mouse pointer over the Close button; it’s the red 
circular button at the top-left corner of the window (refer to Figure 2-3). An X
appears on the button when you’re in the zone. When the X appears, just
click the mouse.
If you’ve been living the life of a hermit in a cave for the last decade or so,
pressing the mouse button is called clicking the mouse. In the Apple uni-
verse, a standard mouse has only one button; if you’re using a trackball
or an uber-mouse with a right mouse button, a right click usually acts the
same as holding down the Control key while you click with a standard Apple
mouse.
Most Mac applications don’t want you closing a window willy-nilly if you’ve
changed the contents without saving them. For example, try to close a docu-
ment window in Word or AppleWorks without saving the file first. The program
will ask you for confirmation before it closes the window containing your
Great American Novel. Most programs also have a Close command on their
File menu.

To close all windows that are displayed by a particular program, hold down
the Option key while you click the Close button on one of the windows.
Whoosh! They’re all gone.
Scrolling windows
Often there’s more stuff in a document or more files on your hard drive than
you can see in the space available for a window. Guess that means it’s time
to delete stuff. No, no, just joking! You don’t have to take such drastic meas-
ures to see more in a window.
Just use the scroll bars that you see in Figure 2-4 to move through the con-
tents of the window. You click the scroll bar and drag it — for the uninitiated,
that means clicking the bar and holding down the mouse button while you
move the mouse in the desired direction. Alternatively, you can click in the
empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages one at a time.

Depending on the type of application that you’re using, you might be able to
scroll a window with your arrow keys as well — or perhaps use the Page Up
and Page Down keys to move through a window.
Minimizing and restoring windows
The multitalented Figure 2-4 also displays another control that you can use
with a window: the Minimize button. When you minimize a window, you elim-
inate it from your Desktop and store it safely in the Dock — that strip of
icons that appears along the bottom (or the side) of your Mac OS X Desktop.
In fact, a minimized window appears as a miniature icon in the Dock, so you
can actually keep an eye on it (so to speak). Figure 2-5 illustrates a mini-
mized window from Safari, which is actually displaying my Web site at
www.mlcbooks.com. To minimize a window, move your mouse pointer over
the yellow Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus
sign appears on the button — and then click.
You’re gonna love this “Easter Egg” hidden in Mac OS X — if you hold down
the Shift key whilst you minimize, the window shrinks in cool slow motion.
(Who says operating systems have to be totally serious, anyway?)
When you’re ready to display the window again on your Desktop — a process
called restoring the window — simply click the thumbnail icon representing
the window in the Dock, and Mac OS X automagically returns it to its former
size and location.
By the way, some — note that I said some — applications continue to run
when minimized, while others will simply stop or pause until you return
them to the Desktop. Such is the crazy world we live in.

Zooming windows
Zooming windows has a kind of Flash Gordon sound to it, don’t you think?
It’s nothing quite that exciting — no red tights or laser guns — still, when
you’re trying to view a larger portion of a document, zooming is a good thing
because it expands the window to the maximum practical size for the appli-
cation that you’re using. In some cases, zooming a window fills the entire
screen; at other times, the extra space would be wasted, so Mac OS X zooms
the window to the maximum size that shows as much content as possible
(without any unnecessary white space). In fact, the Zoom button can even
be disabled by an application that doesn’t want you to muck about with the
window; for example, I own a game or two that don’t allow zooming.
To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the green Zoom button
at the top-left corner of the window. Again, Figure 2-4 struts its stuff and illus-
trates the position. (Man, that is one versatile figure.) A plus sign appears on
the Zoom button. Click to expand your horizons.
After you’ve finished with a zoomed window, you can return it to its previous
dimensions by clicking the Zoom button again.
Toggling toolbars
If you’re wondering what that little lozenge-shaped button is at the right
corner of many Mac OS X application windows, I won’t leave you in suspense:
It toggles the display of the window’s toolbar on and off. A toolbar is a strip
of icons that appears across the top of a window that you can click to per-
form common commands, like changing the display format or printing the
current document. (The toolbar in Figure 2-4, for example, features icons to
move Back and Forward, among others.) You’ll encounter more toolbar tech-
nology throughout the book.
Moving windows
Unlike the rather permanent windows in your home, you can pick up a window
and cart it to another portion of the Desktop. Typically, this is done when
you’re using more than one application at a time, and you need to see the
contents of multiple windows. To grab a window and make off with it, click
the window’s title bar — the strip at the top of the window that usually bears
a document or application name — and drag the window to the new loca-
tion. Then release the mouse button to plant it firmly in the new location.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
33
By the way, some applications allow you to arrange multiple windows in a
graceful swoop with a single click on a menu. Click the Window menu and
choose Arrange All to perform this magic.
I talk about Exposé later in the section, “Switching ’Twixt Programs with
Aplomb.” This cool feature helps you organize a large number of open win-
dows on your Desktop. You can use it to display all open application windows
so that you can pick the one you want . . . or even display all the windows
opened by a specific application.
Resizing windows
Next, consider how to change the width or height of your window. To change
the dimensions of a window to your exact specifications, move your mouse
pointer over the lower-right corner of the window (which is usually marked
with a number of slashed lines to indicate its status as a control), click, and
drag until the window is the size that you prefer.
Switching windows
Before I move to other graphical wonders of Mac OS X, it’s important that
you master how to switch between windows on your Desktop. First, remem-
ber this old Norwegian saying (or is it one of Mark’s Maxims?):
Only one can be active at once.™
What our Oslo friends are communicating is that only one window can be
active at any time. The active window appears on top of other windows, and
it’s the one that you can edit by typing or by moving your mouse. (It also
sports Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons in color.) Other windows that you
have open might be minimized, as I describe earlier in “Minimizing and restor-
ing windows,” or they can be inactive (mere ghosts of themselves) and remain
on your Desktop. Mac OS X dims inactive windows so that you can tell they’re
hanging around . . . but you can’t use them at the moment. Figure 2-6 illus-
trates a number of open windows, with the iTunes window active.
I know you’re going to get tired of hearing me say this, but here I go again:
Certain applications will continue to run while their windows are inactive,
like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and such. Most programs, however,
stop or pause until you make their window active.

Menu Mysteries Explained
34
And how do you switch to — activate — a different window in Mac OS X?
Again, Exposé allows you to activate another window, but if the window is
currently visible, you can simply click on any part of that window. I generally
click the window’s title bar if it’s visible, but any part of the inactive window
will do. The window that you click leaps like a proud stallion to the fore, and
the previously active window now skulks in the background.
You can still use a window’s Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons even when
it’s inactive.
Menu Mysteries Explained
Next, I move on to menu control in Mac OS X. Menus are handy drop-down
controls that allow you to select commands that are grouped together 
logically. For example, an application’s File menu will usually allow you to
create or open a document, save a document to disk, or quit the program.
To pull down a menu, click the desired menu group name on the bar at
the top of the screen and then click the desired menu option from the
extended menu.
Figure 2-6:
Many are
open, but
only one is
active.

Menu Mysteries Explained
35
Figure 2-7 illustrates the Safari menu: Note the submenus designated by right-
arrow icons. When you move your mouse pointer over a submenu command,
you get another set of even more specific menu commands — in this case,
the Services submenu command displays commands like Mail and Grab.
Some applications allow you to create your own custom menus; naturally,
configuring a new menu system takes some time to learn, but imagine the
productivity gains that you’ll enjoy! For example, my menus in Microsoft
Word 2004 for Mac feature only the commands that I use often — they’re
sleeker and easier to navigate. (However, you have to stop short of claiming
that you wrote the application. And yes, I already checked with Microsoft,
which got downright snippy about it.)
Mac OS X also provides another type of menu: contextual. A contextual menu
appears when you hold down the Control key and click certain items on the
screen, revealing commands that relate specifically to that item. (Unfortunately,
the items that sport contextual menus vary from application to application,
so it’s best to check the documentation for a program before you spend
countless hours Control-clicking everything onscreen.) The same items in
the Control-click menu appear when you select an item and then click the
Action drop-down list box, which looks like a mechanical gear.

Icons ’R Us
36
As I mention earlier, many manufacturers sell mice, trackballs, and other
pointing things that include a secondary mouse button. This is decidedly a
Windows trait — remember, Apple feels that a second mouse button is mere
filigree — but if you have one, the device might display contextual menus when
you click the secondary button. (This is often called right-clicking because
the left mouse button is typically the primary button.) Then again, you might
launch Aunt Harriet into a geosynchronous orbit, so double-check the manual
for your pointing thing on the default button assignment (and how to change
it, if necessary).
You’ll note that many commands in menus have keyboard shortcuts.
Because I’ll be holding forth on this subject in the upcoming section,
“Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User,” I’ll hold off on describing
them here.
Icons ’R Us
Icons are more than little pictures. They’re . . . well . . . actually, I guess they
are little pictures. However, these graphical WUDs (that’s short for Wonderful
User Devices) are really representations of the components of your Mac OS X
system, and therefore they deserve a section of their own.
For complete details on what any icon is, what it represents, and what it will
do, click the icon once to highlight it and then press Ô+I. This displays the
Info dialog that you see in Figure 2-8, which tells you what kind of icon it is,
where the item it represents is actually located, and how big it is. You’ll also
see a version number for applications — a handy way of quickly checking
what version of a program you’re running — and when the file was created
and last modified. The Info dialog also offers other settings and options that
you can display by clicking in the General drop-down list box, and I cover
them in other parts of the book.
Hardware
Mac OS X uses icons to represent the various hardware devices of your com-
puter, including your

✦CD or DVD drive
✦Printer
✦iPod

You get the idea. Just double-click a hardware icon to display the folders and
files that it contains, like with your hard drive and CD/DVD drive.
Generally, you’ll only encounter hardware icons on your Desktop or in Finder
windows. Figure 2-9 illustrates some of the hardware icons that live in my
system.

Programs and applications
These are the fancy icons, folks. Most applications have their own custom
icons, and double-clicking one will typically whisk you on your way. Mac OS X
also includes a generic icon or two for applications that don’t include their
own custom icon. Figure 2-10 illustrates a number of my favorite program
icons from all sorts of Mac OS X applications.
Running a program in Mac OS X can be as simple as double-clicking the
application icon — more on this later in the section, “Houston, We’re Go to
Launch Programs.”
Files
Your hard drive will contain many thousands of individual files, and the Big
X tries to make it as easy as possible to visually identify which application
owns which file. Therefore, most applications use a special icon to indicate
their data files. For example, Figure 2-11 illustrates several documents and
data files created by a range of applications: Microsoft Word, AppleWorks,
QuickTime, Safari, and Adobe Acrobat. Some cheeky applications even use
more than one icon to differentiate between different file types, like docu-
ments and templates in Microsoft Word.
Figure 2-10:

There are also a number of generic file icons that indicate text files, includ-
ing RTF (short for rich text format) documents and PDF (Portable Document
Format) documents, which use the Adobe Acrobat format.
You can open most documents and data files by double-clicking them, which
automatically launches the proper application and loads the document.
Folders
Folders have a 3-D look in Mac OS X — and, as you can see in Figure 2-12,
some applications even customize their folder icon!
To open a folder within Mac OS X, just double-click it. (Alternatively, you can
click it once to select it and then press Ô+O.) Discover more about how to
control the look of folder contents in Book II, Chapter 1.

Aliases
An alias is a strange beast. Although it might look like a standard icon, upon
closer examination, you’ll notice that an alias icon sports a tiny curved
arrow at the base, and the tag alias usually appears at the end of the icon
name. Figure 2-13 has roped in a variety of aliases for your enjoyment, along
with one or two actual icons for comparison.
Essentially, an alias is a link to something else on your system. For example,
a Photoshop alias can run Photoshop just like the actual program icon, but
it takes up only a scant few bytes on your hard drive. (If you’re a Switcher
who’s just crossed over from the Windows Wilderness, think shortcut —
Windows shortcuts work in a similar manner.) The alias file is just big
enough to hold the location of the actual file or folder, allowing it to yell at
Mac OS X: “Hey, the Human actually wants you to run this or open that thing
over there!”

Aliases come in handy for a number of reasons:
✦They allow you to launch applications and open files and folders
from anywhere in your system. For example, you might want an alias
icon in your MP3 folder that runs Roxio Toast so that you can launch
Toast and burn an audio CD without laboriously navigating to the Roxio
folder, which could be nested in goodness-knows-how-many layers of
subfolders.
✦They can be easily deleted when no longer needed without wreaking
havoc on the original application, file, or folder. If you decide that you’d
rather use iTunes to burn audio CDs, you can simply delete the Toast alias
without trashing Toast itself.
✦Their tiny size allows you to add multiple aliases (and mucho con-
venience) for a single application without gulping down hard drive
space.

Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
42
You might be wondering, “Why use aliases when I can just copy the actual
application, file, or folder to the desired spot?” Well, indeed you can do that.
However, the application might not work in its new location because you
didn’t copy any of the supporting files that most applications need to run.
(An alias actually runs the original application or opens the original file or
folder, so things should work just as if you double-clicked the original icon.)
Additionally, remember that copying applications willy-nilly throughout your
hard drive will eat up territory like a horde of angry Vikings.
If you dislike the alias hanging off the end of the icon name, feel free to
rename it (as I show you in the next chapter). The alias will continue to func-
tion nicely no matter what moniker you give it. (If you create an alias by
holding down Ô+Option whilst dragging the original icon to a new location,
the alias name won’t include the alias appendage.)
If the original file no longer exists, an alias naturally no longer works, either.
However, Mac OS X is sharp enough to automatically “fix” an alias if you
rename or move the original file, pointing it to the new location. Slick!
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
You’ll often find yourself performing different actions on one icon — or a
number of icons at one time. For example, you can copy or move files from
one location on your hard drive to another or delete a group of files that you
no longer need. (The idea of drag-and-drop file management using icons orig-
inated on the Macintosh, but I’ll wait until the next chapter to describe these
operations in detail.) For now, focus on the basics of selecting one or more
icons, which specifies which files and folders that you want to use for what-
ever you’re going to do next.
Selecting a single icon
First, here are the various ways that you can select a single icon for an
impending action:
✦Place your mouse pointer over the file and click once. Mac OS X dark-
ens the icon to indicate that it’s selected — a mysterious process called
highlighting.
✦Type the first few letters of the icon’s name. After you type enough
characters to identify the icon uniquely (whether it be one or a dozen),
Mac OS X highlights the icon that matches the text string.

✦If an icon in a window is already highlighted, you can move the high-
light to the next icon across by pressing the right-arrow key. Likewise,
the other three directional arrow keys move the highlight in the other
directions. To move through the icons alphabetically, press Tab to go
forward and Shift+Tab to go backward.
Selecting multiple icons
To select a gaggle of icons for an action, use one of these methods:
✦If the icons are next to each other, click and drag within the window
(and not directly on a specific item) to highlight them all. While you drag,
Mac OS X displays a selection box, and any icons you touch with that
box will be highlighted when you release the mouse button (as shown in
Figure 2-14). Think “lasso,” and you’ll get the picture.
✦You can also select multiple adjacent icons by clicking the first item to
highlight it and then holding down the Shift key while clicking the last
icon in the series that you want to select.
If the icons are not next to each other, you can hold down the Ô key
while you click each item that you want to select.
Just selecting an icon doesn’t launch or do anything . . . you’re just marking
your territory.

Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User

Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Virtually all Mac OS X applications have their own keyboard shortcuts — a
ten-cent term for a key combination that performs the same operation as a
menu command or a toolbar button. Although the mouse might seem the
easier path when controlling your Mac, it’s not always the fastest. Those hardy
souls who venture to learn common keyboard shortcuts can zip through a
spreadsheet or warp through a complex outline at speeds that no mere rodent-
wrangler could ever hope to attain.
With that in mind — and with the goal of “pumping you up” into a power
user — I hereby present the most common keyboard shortcuts for the Big X
in Table 2-1. I’ve also sprinkled other keyboard shortcuts liberally through
the book when I discuss other applications, but these combinations are the
classics that appear virtually everywhere.

By the way, I should mention that many keyboard combinations use three

they look something akin to Egyptian hieroglyphics, but you need only hold
down the first two keys simultaneously and press the third key. Common
“strange” key symbols that you’ll see in both the Finder and most applica-
tions are shown in Table 2-2.

The next stop on your introductory tour of Mac OS X is the launch pad for
your applications — although the Finder is useful, you’ll likely want to actu-
ally do something with your Mac as well.
Running applications from your hard drive
You can launch an application from your hard drive by
✦Navigating to the corresponding application folder — by either clicking
or double-clicking drive and folder icons — and double-clicking the
application icon.
✦Double-clicking a document or data file that’s owned by the application.
For example, double-clicking an MP3 audio file will run iTunes.
✦Double-clicking an alias that you’ve created for the application. (Get the
skinny on aliases in the earlier section, “Aliases.” I’ll wait.)
✦Clicking the application’s icon in the Dock (more on adding items to the
Dock in Book II, Chapter 2).
✦Selecting the application icon and pressing the Ô+O keyboard shortcut.
✦Adding the application to your Startup items list. (I cover this in more
detail later in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Running applications from a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
After you load a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can display its contents by double-
clicking the disc icon that appears on your Desktop. A Finder window opens
and shows the files that reside on the disc (see Figure 2-15).
After you locate the application you want to run on the disc, you can launch
it by double-clicking it or selecting it and pressing Ô+O.

You might think that juggling multiple applications will lead to confusion,
fatigue, and dry mouth, but luckily Mac OS X makes it easy to jump between
programs that are running on your Mac. Use any of these methods to jump
from open application to application:
✦Press Ô+Tab. If you’ve got a dozen windows open, this can get a bit
tedious, which leads us to one of Tiger’s sassiest features, brazenly
named Exposé and shown in Figure 2-16. (Am I stretching things a bit?
You say that technology doesn’t compare to the glamour of Hollywood?
Then take in a Steve Jobs keynote address at the yearly Macworld con-
vention! The man is a superstar. Poor Bill. . . .)
✦Press F9 to show all open application windows using Exposé; then
click the one that you want. Figure 2-16 illustrates the tiled window 
display on my Mac after I press F9. Your cursor changes into the tradi-
tional (and so very elegant) gloved hand. Move the cursor on top of the
window that you want to activate — the window turns blue when it’s

selected — and click once to switch to that window. You can specify
which keys you want to use to control Exposé within System Preferences.
✦Press F10 to show all open windows from the application that you’re
currently using; then click the one that you want to activate. This
Exposé function is great for choosing from all the images that you’ve
opened in Photoshop or all the Safari Web pages littering your Desktop!
✦Click anywhere in the desired application window to make it the
active window.
✦Click the application icon in the Dock. All applications that are running
have an icon in the Dock, and the icon will have an up arrow beneath it
to indicate that the application is open.
Along with the window switch, an astute observer will notice that the appli-
cation menu bar will also change to match the now-active application.
Besides the F9 and F10 hot keys that I just discussed, Exposé provides one
more nifty function: Press F11, and all your open windows scurry to the side
of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-17. (Much like a herd of zebras if you
dropped a lioness in the middle.) Now you can work with drives, files, and
aliases on your Desktop — and when you’re ready to confront those dozen
application windows again, just press F11 a second time.

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
Almost all Mac OS X applications open and save documents in the same
way, whether you’re typing a quick letter to your mom with AppleWorks or
expressing your artistic side with Painter. Therefore, I’m going to take a
moment to outline the common procedures for opening and saving docu-
ments. Believe me, you’ll perform these two rituals dozens of times a week,
so no nodding off.
Opening a document
First, the simple way to load a document: Double-click that document in a
Finder window, and . . . well, that’s it. (This is my preferred method because
I’m an ALT — short for Admitted Lazy Techno-wizard — who would rather use
complex hand movements to pour myself another Diet Coke.)
To open a document the hard way — from inside an application — here’s
the plan:
1. Choose File➪Open or press that handy Ô+O key combination.
Figure 2-17:
Scat,

Desktop.

Book I
Chapter 2
Navigating and
Running Programs
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
49
Your Mac OS X program is likely to display the attractive Open dialog
that you see in Figure 2-18.
2. Navigate to the location of the document that you want to open.
The drop-down list allows you to jump directly to common locations —
such as the Desktop, your Home folder, and your iDisk — as well as places
that you’ve recently accessed (Recent Places).
If the target folder isn’t in your drop-down list, move the slider at
the bottom of the dialog to the far left to display your hard drives,
CD-ROM/DVD drives, and network locations.
3. Click the habitat where the file will be found.
You’ll note that the right column(s) will change to show you the contents
of the item that you just clicked. In this way, you can cruise through 
successive folders to find that elusive document. (This somewhat time-
consuming process is somewhat derisively called drilling — hence, the
importance of using Recent Items, or dragging files, locations, and appli-
cations into the sidebar at the left of the Finder.)
4. When you sight the document that you want to load, either double-
click it or click once to highlight the filename and then click Open.
Figure 2-18:
The soon-
to-be-quite-
familiar
Open dialog.

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
50
“Hey, the Open dialog can be resized!” That’s right, good buddy — you can
expand the Open dialog to show more columns and find things more easily.
Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog to resize it.
Saving a document
To save a document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save.
If you’ve previously saved this document, your application should imme-
diately overwrite the existing document with the new copy, and you get
to return to work . . . end of story. If you haven’t previously saved this
document, the program will display a Save dialog that’s usually very 
similar to the Open dialog; it generally has a few more options, however,
so stay frosty.
2. Navigate to the location where you’d like to save the document and
then type a filename.
Often, you can use a default name that’s already provided by the
thoughtful folks who developed the software. Note that you might be
given the chance to save the document in several different formats.
For example, Figure 2-19 illustrates the AppleWorks Save dialog; you
can click the File Format drop-down list to choose other formats,
such as RTF, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and even bargain-
basement text.
3. Click Save (or OK, depending on the application).

Quitting Programs
51
If an application offers a Save As menu option in the File menu, you can in
effect copy the document by saving a new version of the document under
another name. Save As comes in particularly handy when you want to retain
the original version of a document.
Quitting Programs
If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I’d simply tell you to quit applica-
tions by pulling your Mac’s power cord from the wall socket. (Luckily, I don’t.)
There are, however, more sane ways to exit a program — use one of these
methods instead:
✦Press the Ô+Q keyboard shortcut.
✦Choose File➪Quit.
✦Control-click (or right-click) the application icon on the Dock and click
Quit on the pop-up menu that appears.
✦Click the Close button on the application window. Note, however, that
this doesn’t always completely close down the application. For example,
Safari stays running even if you close the browser window.

fter you master basic Mac spell-casting — things like selecting items,
using menus, opening and saving documents, working with windows,
and launching an application or two — it’s time to delve deeper into Mac 
OS X. (Can you tell I’m a Dungeons & Dragons old-timer?)
In this chapter, I discuss file management, showing you the hidden power
behind the friendly Apple menu. I also discuss some of the more advanced
menu commands, how to print within most applications, and how to listen
to an audio CD on your Mac. (It makes a doggone good stereo.) Finally, I
introduce you to the built-in CD/DVD recording features within the Big X.
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
So what exactly is the Finder anyway? It’s a rather nebulous term, but in
essence, the Finder gives Mac OS X the basic functions that you’ll use for the
procedures that I outline in this chapter. This UberOS has been around in
one guise or another since the days of System 6 — the creaking old days
when a Mac was an all-in-one, tote-able computer with a built-in screen.
Come to think of it, some things never change.

The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
54
The Finder is always running, so it’s always available — and you can always
switch to it, even when several other applications are open and chugging
away. Figure 3-1 illustrates the Dock with the rather perspective-crazy Finder
icon at the far left side.
Is that icon supposed to be one face or two faces? I’m still confused, and I’ve
been using the Mac now since 1991.
Don’t forget that Mac OS X gives you a second method of doing everything I
cover in this chapter: You can use Terminal to uncover the UNIX core of Mac
OS X, employing your blazing typing speed to take care of things from the
command line. Of course, that’s not the focus of this book, but for those who
want to boldly go where no Mac operating system has ever gone before,
you’ll find more in Book VII, Chapter 1. Despite what you might have been
led to believe, power and amazing speed are to be found in character-based
computing.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
55
Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Here’s where drag-and-drop makes things about as easy as computing 
can get:
✦To copy a file or folder from one window to another location on the
same drive: Hold down the Option key and click and drag the icon from
its current home to the new location. (Note: You can drop files and fold-
ers on top of other folders, which puts the copy inside that folder.) If
you’re copying multiple items, select them first (read how in Book I,
Chapter 2) and then drag and drop the entire crew.
“Is the Desktop a valid target location for a file or folder?” You’re darn
tootin’! I recommend, though, that you avoid cluttering up your Desktop
with more than a handful of files. Instead, create a folder or two on your
Desktop and then store those items within those folders. If you work
with the contents of a specific folder often, drag it into the column at the
left side of any Finder window, and you can open that folder from the
Finder with a single click — no matter where you are! (Alternatively,
drag the folder to the Dock and drop it there, and you can open it with a
single click from anywhere.)
✦To copy items from one window to a location on another drive: Click
and drag the icon from the window to a window displaying the contents
of the target drive. Or, in the spirit of drag-and-drop, you can simply drag
the items to the drive icon, which places them in the root folder of that
drive.
✦To move items from one window to another location on the same
drive: Simply drag the icon to the new location, whether it be a window
or a folder.
Mac OS X provides you with a number of visual cues to let you know what’s
being copied or moved. For example, dragging one or more items displays a
ghost image of the items, and when you’ve positioned the mouse pointer
over the target, Mac OS X highlights that location to let you know that you’re
in the zone. If you’re moving or copying items into another Finder window,
the window border is highlighted to let you know that Mac OS X understands
the game plan.
In case you move the wrong thing or you port it to the wrong location, press
Ô+Z to undo the previous action.
If the item that you’re dragging already exists in the target location, you get a
confirmation dialog like the one you see in Figure 3-2. You can choose to
replace the file, leave the existing file alone, or stop the entire shooting
match.

Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
56
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
No need for sci-fi equipment or billions in cash — you can create an exact
duplicate of any item within the same folder. (This is often handy when you
need a simple backup of the same file in the same folder or when you’re
going to edit a document but you want to keep the original intact.)
Click the item to select it, and then choose Finder➪File➪Duplicate. To distin-
guish the duplicate from the original, Mac OS X adds the word copy to the
end of the duplicate’s icon name; additional copies have a number added to
the name as well.
Alternatively, aficionados of the keyboard can hold down the Option key and
drag the original item to another spot in the same window — when you
release the button, the duplicate appears.
Heck, if you prefer the Control key, you can hold it down while clicking the
item, and then choose Duplicate from the contextual menu that appears.
Decisions, decisions. . . .
Oh, and don’t forget that Action button (it looks like a little gear with a
downward-pointing arrow) on the Finder toolbar (refer to Figure 3-1). You
could also click the Action button and choose Duplicate from the drop-down
list.
When you duplicate a folder, Mac OS X automatically duplicates all the con-
tents of the folder as well. Remember that this could take some time if the
folder contains a large number of small files (or a small number of large
files). Groucho would’ve loved computers!
Deleting That Which Should Not Be
Even Leonardo da Vinci made the occasional design mistake — his trash can
was likely full of bunched-up pieces of parchment. Luckily, no trees will be
wasted when you decide to toss your unneeded files and folders; this section
shows you how to delete items from your system.

Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
57
By the way, as you’ll soon witness for yourself, moving items to the Trash
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re immediately history.
Dragging unruly files against their will
In Mac OS X, the familiar Macintosh Trash can has been moved to the right
edge of the Dock — in fact, it’s now a spiffy-looking wire can instead of the
old clunker that the Mac faithful remember. You can click and drag the items
that you’ve selected to the Trash and drop them on top of the wire can icon
to delete them. When the Trash contains at least one item, the wire can icon
changes to appear as if it were full of trash.
You can also add a Delete icon to your Finder toolbar — for all the details,
see Book II, Chapter 1.
Deleting with the menus and the keyboard
The mouse isn’t absolutely necessary when deleting items. Your other
options for scrapping selected files include
✦Choosing File from the Finder menu and choosing the Move to Trash
menu item
✦Pressing the Ô+Delete keyboard shortcut
✦Clicking the Action button on the Finder toolbar and selecting Move to
Trash from the drop-down list
✦Holding down Control while clicking the item to display the contextual
menu and then choosing Move to Trash from that menu
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
As I mention earlier, moving items to the Trash doesn’t actually delete them
immediately from your system. Believe me, this fail-safe measure comes in
handy when you’ve been banging away at the keyboard for several hours
and you stop paying close attention to what you’re doing. (I usually also
blame lack of Diet Coke.) More on how to rescue files from the Trash in the
next section.
Like any folder, you can check the contents of the Trash by clicking the
Trash icon in the Dock.
After you double-check the Trash contents and you are indeed absolutely
sure you want to delete its contents, use one of the following methods to
nuke the digital Bit Bucket:

WAIT! I Need That After All!
58
✦Choose Finder from the Finder menu and choose the Empty Trash
menu item.
✦Choose Finder from the Finder menu and choose Secure Empty Trash.
Believe it or not, if you use the standard Empty Trash command, you
haven’t completely zapped that refuse! Some third-party hard drive
repair and recovery programs will allow an uncool person to restore
items from the Trash. Use the Secure Empty Trash method for those sen-
sitive files and folders that you want to immediately and irrevocably
delete — the data is overwritten with random characters, making it
impossible to recover. (A great idea for that Mac you want to sell on
eBay, no?)
✦Press the Ô+Shift+Delete keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the Trash icon in the Dock, hold down the mouse button, and
choose Empty Trash from the menu that appears.
✦Hold down Control while clicking the Trash icon in the Dock and then
choose Empty Trash from the contextual menu that appears.
Depending on the method that you select and the settings that you choose
in System Preferences (which I cover in Book II, Chapter 3), Mac OS X might
present you with a confirmation dialog to make sure that you actually want
the Trash emptied.
WAIT! I Need That After All!
In the adrenaline-inducing event that you need to rescue something that
shouldn’t have ended up in the scrap pile, first click the Trash icon in the
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. Then rescue the items that you
want to save by dragging them to the Desktop or a folder on your hard drive.
(This is roughly analogous to rescuing your old baseball glove from the
family garage sale.)
Feel free to gloat — if someone else is nearby, ask her to pat you on the back
and call you a lifesaver.
Renaming Your Items
You wouldn’t get far in today’s spacious virtual world without being able to
change a moniker for a file or folder. To rename an item in Mac OS X, use one
of these two methods:
✦With the mouse: Click once on an icon’s name (or just press Return).
Mac OS X highlights the text in an edit box — type the new name and
then press Return when you’re done.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
59
You want to wait a few seconds between clicks, as opposed to a rapid-
fire double-click.
✦From the Info dialog: Select the item and press Ô+I to display the Info
dialog; then click the triangle next to Name & Extension. Click in the
name field, drag the mouse to highlight the text that you want to change,
and type the replacement text.
Naturally, the first method is the easiest, and it’s the one that I use most
often.
Adding a Dash of Color
Tiger also provides the ability to color-code files and folders to help you
organize and recognize your data in a hurry. For example, why not assign the
green label color to the files and folders that make up your current project?
Or, if you need to mark a file for immediate attention, assign it the red label
color.
To assign a label color to selected files and folders, you have three options:
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click the desired
color.
✦Hold down Control while you click on the selection and then choose the
color from the pop-up menu.
✦Click File and choose that perfect shade from the menu.
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
The Finder’s Info dialog is the place to view the specifics on any highlighted
item (including drives and aliases). Select an item and press Ô+I, click the
Action toolbar button and select Get Info from the list, or choose the
Finder’s File menu and then choose Get Info (see the results in Figure 3-3). If
you select more than one item, the Info dialog combines as many properties
as possible to give you a summary.
Mac OS X displays the General information panel when you first open the
Info dialog, but other panels are usually available (depending on the type 
of selected items). To display the other panels, click the panel that you want
to see.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
60
For most types of files and folders, the Info dialog can tell you
✦Kind: What type of item it is — for example, whether it’s a file, folder,
drive, or alias — and what program automatically launches when you
open the selected item
✦Size: The total size of the item (or items) that you select
✦Where: The actual path on your hard drive where the item is located
✦Dates: The date when the item was created and was last modified
✦Version: The application version number
✦Permission: The privileges that control who can do what to the file —
more on this later in Book II, Chapter 6 — and whether a file is locked in
read-only mode
Some of this information you can change, and some can only be displayed.
To banish the Info dialog from your Desktop, click the dialog’s Close button.
For the rest of this section, I describe a number of tasks that you can accom-
plish from the Info dialog.
If you use a specific document over and over as a basis for different revi-
sions, you can enable the Stationery Pad check box on the General informa-
tion panel to use the file as stationery. Opening a stationery file auto-
matically creates a new, untitled version of the file in the linked application;
this can save you steps compared with duplicating the file or using the Save
As procedure that I show you in Book I, Chapter 2.

Adding comments
Mac OS X provides you with a comment field where you can add additional
text that’s stored along with the file (and can be matched with Spotlight). 
I use this feature to record the version number of manuscript chapters and
programs that I create during the course of writing books.
To add a comment, follow these steps:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
2. Click in the Spotlight Comments box and type the comment text.
If you need to expand the Spotlight Comments section of the Info dialog,
click the triangle next to the Spotlight Comments heading. The arrow
rotates and the Spotlight Comments box appears.
3. Close the Info dialog to save the comment.
Displaying extensions
Extensions are alien creatures to most Mac owners. However, these three- or
four-character add-ons that follow a period at the end of a filename have
been a mainstay in the DOS, Windows, and UNIX environments for years. An
extension identifies what program owns a specific file, and therefore which
application launches automatically when you double-click that file’s icon.
Examples of common extensions (and the applications that own them)
include
✦.pdf: Adobe Acrobat
✦.doc: Microsoft Word
✦.pages: Apple Pages
✦.key: Apple Keynote
✦.psd: Adobe Photoshop
✦.jpeg or .jpg: Preview, or your image editor
✦.tiff or .tif: Preview, or your image editor
✦.htm or .html: Safari, or your Web browser of choice
Why would someone want to see a file’s extension? It comes in handy when a
number of different types of files are linked to the same application. For
example, if you install Adobe Photoshop, both JPEG and TIFF images have
the same icon, so you can’t tell one from the other. With extensions dis-
played, it’s easy to tell what type of file you’re looking at.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders

Follow this procedure to hide or display extensions with your filenames:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
2. If you need to expand the Name & Extension section of the Info
dialog, click the triangle next to the Name & Extension heading.
3. To display the extension for the selected file, clear the Hide Extension
check box to disable it.
4. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Choosing the application to launch with a file
So what’s the plan if the wrong application launches when you double-click a
file? Not a problem: You can also change the linked application from the Info
dialog as well. (I told you this was a handy toy box, didn’t I?) Follow these
steps to choose another application to pair with a selected file:
1. Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and click Show Info to
display the Info dialog for the item.
2. Click the triangle next to the Open With heading to expand it.
3. Click the drop-down list button, and Mac OS X displays the applica-
tions that it feels are best suited to open this type of document.
4. Select the application that should open the file.
To go completely hog-wild and choose a different application, select
Other from the drop-down list. Mac OS X opens a Choose Other
Application dialog where you can navigate to and select the application
you want. (If the application is not recognized as recommended, click the
Enable list box and choose All Applications.) After you highlight the
application, click Add.
5. To globally update all the documents of the same type to launch the
application that you chose, click the Change All button.
Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog asking whether you’re sure
about making this drastic change. Click Continue to update the other
files of the same type or click Cancel to return to the Info dialog.
6. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Locking files against evildoers
“Holy Item Insurance, Batman!” That’s right, Boy Wonder: Before I leave the
friendly land of the Info dialog, every Mac owner needs to learn how to pro-
tect files and folders from accidental deletion or editing. By locking a file,

you allow it to be opened and copied — but not changed, renamed, or sent
to the Trash. Locked items appear in the Finder with a small padlock
attached to the icon.
To lock or unlock a file, you have to have ownership of the file. I cover privi-
leges in Book II, but on a Mac where you’ve configured only one administra-
tor account, you should already have ownership. Follow this procedure:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item.
2. Select the Locked check box to enable it.
The Locked check box is in the General section of the dialog.
3. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Creating an Alias
I mention aliases in Book I, Chapter 2. As I discuss in that chapter, an alias
acts as a link to an application or document that actually exists elsewhere on
your system (a handy trick to use when organizing items on your hard
drive). You have a number of different ways to conjure an alias after you
select an item:
✦Choose File from the Finder menu and choose the Make Alias menu item.
(You have to move the alias yourself.)
✦Press the Ô+L keyboard shortcut. (Again, you have to move the new
alias to its new location.)
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click Make Alias.
✦Hold down Control while clicking the selected item and then choose
Make Alias from the contextual menu that appears.
In addition, you can hold down the Ô+Option key combination and drag the
item to the location where you want the alias.
Although Mac OS X does a great job in tracking the movements of an original
and updating an alias, some actions can break the link. For example, if you
delete the original, the alias is left wandering in search of a home. However,
all is not lost — when you double-click a broken alias, Mac OS X offers to
help you fix the alias. This involves browsing through your system to locate
a new original.

Using the Apple Menu
The Apple menu is a familiar sight to any Mac owner. Although Apple con-
templated removing it during the original development and beta cycle for
Mac OS X version 10.0, the ruckus and cry from beta-testers ensured that it
remains today. It’s amazing how reassuring that little fellow can be when you
boot the Big X for the first time.
In this section, I cover the important things that are parked under the Apple
menu.
Using Recent Items
If you’re like most of us — and I think I’m safe in assuming that you are —
you tend to work on the same set of applications and files (and use the same
network servers) during the day. Normally, this would be somewhat of a pain
because each time you sit down in front of the keyboard, you have to drill
down through at least one layer of folders to actually reach the stuff that you
need. To make things easier on yourself, you could create a set of aliases on
your Desktop that link to those servers, files, and applications . . . but as you
move from project to project, you’d find yourself constantly updating the
aliases. As Blackbeard the Pirate was wont to exclaim, “Arrgh!”
Ah, but Mac OS X is a right-smart operating system, and several years ago
Apple created the Recent Items menu to save you the trouble of drilling for
applications and files (and, with the arrival of Tiger, network servers as
well). Figure 3-4 illustrates the Recent Items menu from my system. Note that
the menu is thoughtfully divided into Applications, Documents, and Servers.
When you open documents or launch applications, they’re added to the list.
(Accountants will revel in this First In, First Out technology.) To launch an
application or document from the Recent Items menu — or connect to a net-
work server — just click it.
To wipe the contents of the Recent Items menu — for example, if you’ve just
finished a project, and you want to turn over a new digital leaf — click
Recent Items and choose the Clear Menu item.
You can specify the number of recent items that will appear in the menu
from System Preferences; display the Appearance icon and click the
Applications, Documents, and Servers list boxes in the Number of Recent
Items field. (More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Also, remember the trick that I mention earlier: You can drag any folder or
server into the Sidebar column at the left of the Finder window, adding it to
that exclusive club that includes your Home folder, Applications folder, and
media folders.

Playing with the Dock
You know how Air Force One acts as the mobile nerve center for the presi-
dent? And how The Chief can jet all around the world and take all his stuff
along with him? Well, the Dock is kind of like that. Sort of.
If you want your Dock to go mobile as well, click the Apple menu and choose
the Dock item to display the submenu. Here’s a rundown of the options that
you’ll find:
✦Magnification: Click Turn Magnification On/Off to toggle icon magnifica-
tion when your pointer is selecting an icon from the Dock. With magnifi-
cation on, the icons in the Dock get really, really big . . . a good thing for
Mr. Magoo or those with grandiose schemes to take over the world.
Check out the rather oversized icons in Figure 3-5. (The amount of mag-
nification can be controlled from the System Preferences Dock settings,
which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.)

✦Hiding: Click Turn Hiding On/Off to toggle the automatic hiding of the
Dock. With hiding on, the Dock disappears off the edge of the screen
until you move the mouse pointer to that edge. (This is great for those
who want to make use of as much Desktop territory as possible for their
applications.)
You can press Ô+Option+D to toggle Dock hiding on and off from the
keyboard.
✦Position: Click one of three choices (Position on Left, Bottom, or Right)
to make the Dock appear on the left, bottom, or right of the screen,
respectively.
✦Dock Preferences: Click this to display the System Preferences Dock set-
tings, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.
Bad program! Quit!
Once in a while, you’re going to encounter a stubborn application that locks
up, slows to a crawl, or gets stuck in an endless loop — although Mac OS X is
a highly advanced operating system, it can still fall prey to bad programming
or corrupted data.

Now those,

Luckily, you can easily shut these troublemakers down from the Apple menu.
Just choose Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog that you
see in Figure 3-6. (Keyboard types can press Ô+Option+Esc.) Select the
application that you want to banish and then click the Force Quit button;
Mac OS X requests confirmation, after which you click the Force Quit button
again.
If you select Finder in the Force Quit Applications dialog, the button changes
to Relaunch. This allows you to restart the Finder, which comes in handy if
your system appears to be unstable. (This is much faster than actually
restarting your Mac.)
Forcing an application to quit will also quit any open documents that you
were working with in that application, so save your work (if the program will
allow you to save anything). If you relaunch the Finder, some programs
might restart as well.
Tracking down your version
This isn’t a big deal, but if you choose About This Mac from the Apple menu,
Mac OS X displays the About This Mac dialog that you see in Figure 3-7. In
case you need to check the amount of memory or the processor in an unfa-
miliar Mac, the About This Mac dialog can display these facts in a twinkling.
However, I primarily use it to check on the Mac OS X version and build
number as well as to launch the Apple System Profiler (which I discuss in full
in Chapter 7 of this mini-book). Click the More Info button to launch the
Profiler.

Apple includes a button that launches Software Update to both the About
This Mac dialog and the Apple menu . . . sheesh, they must really want you
to keep your Big X up to date, I guess.
Specifying a location
Mac OS X allows you to create multiple network locations — think of a loca-
tion as a separate configuration that you use when you connect to a different
network from a different locale. For instance, if you travel to a branch office,
you’d assign a location for your desk and a location for the remote branch. A
student might assign one location for her home network and another for the
college computer lab network.
A location saves all the specific values that you’ve entered in the System
Preferences Network settings, including IP address, AppleTalk Zones, proxy
servers, and the like. If all this means diddly squat to you, don’t worry — I
explain this in Book V, Chapter 1. For now, just remember that you can
switch between locations by choosing Location from the Apple menu, which
displays a submenu of locations that you can choose from.
Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
In Mac OS X, Services allow you to merge information from one application
with another. To Mac old-timers, that might sound suspiciously like the
Clipboard; however, services can also include functionality from an applica-
tion, so you can create new documents or complete tasks without running
another program! Services can be used in both the Finder and Mac OS X
applications.

Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu

To illustrate, here’s a fun example:
1. Launch TextEdit (you’ll find it in your Applications folder) and type
these words: Hello from your Macintosh!
2. Highlight those words.
3. Click the TextEdit menu — don’t switch to the Finder, use the TextEdit
Application menu — and choose Services.
4. From the Services submenu, choose Speech and then choose Start
Speaking Text.
After you’ve chuckled a bit at your Mac’s accent, consider what you just 
did — you ran the Speech application from within TextEdit, using the
selected words! Pretty slick, eh?
A glance at the other Services that show up from within most applications
gives you an idea of just how convenient and powerful Mac OS X Services
can be — I often use Services to take care of things like
✦Sending an e-mail message from an e-mail address in a text file,
AppleScript document, or the Address Book (via the Mail Service)
✦Capturing a screen snapshot within an application (using the Grab
Service)
✦Sending a file to a Bluetooth-equipped PDA or cell phone within an
application (using the Send File to Bluetooth Device service)
Remember, you can access the Services menu from a Mac OS X application
by picking that program’s Application menu (sometimes called the named
menu). For instance, in the demonstration earlier, I use the TextEdit menu
that appears on the TextEdit menu bar. In Microsoft Word, I would click the
Word menu.
Geez, I think the computing world needs another word for menu — don’t you?
Many third-party applications that you install under Mac OS X can add their
own commands under the Services menu, so be sure to read the documenta-
tion for a new application to see what Service functionality it adds.
Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
Remember the transporter from Star Trek? Step on the little platform,
assume a brave pose, and whoosh! — you’re transported instantaneously to
another ship or (more likely) to a badly designed planet exterior built inside
a soundstage. Talk about convenience . . . that is, as long as the doggone
thing didn’t malfunction.

The Finder’s Go menu gives you the chance to play Captain Kirk: You can
jump immediately to specific spots, both within the confines of your own
system as well as external environments like your network or the Internet.
(You can leave your phaser and tricorder in your cabin.)
The destinations that you can travel to using the Go menu and the iDisk sub-
menu include the following:
✦Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder: I lump these three commands together
because they’re all basic navigation commands. For example, Back and
Forward operate just like they do in Safari or your favorite Web browser.
If you’re currently inside a folder, you can return to the parent folder by
clicking Enclosing Folder.
✦Computer: This window includes your hard drives, CD and DVD drives,
and your network — the same places that appear when you open a new
Finder window with the Ô+N key shortcut.
✦Home: This window displays the home directory for the user currently
logged in.
✦Network: Did you guess this displays a window with all of your network
connections? Dead giveaway, that.
✦iDisk: This window displays the contents of your Internet iDisk storage
(or someone else’s). (More on the coolness that is iDisk in Book IV,
Chapter 4.)
✦Applications: This window includes all the applications that appear in
your Mac OS X Applications folder (a neat Just the programs, ma’am
arrangement that really comes in handy).
✦Utilities: This window displays all the utilities in your Mac OS X Utilities
folder.
✦Recent Folders: This window displays a submenu that allows you to
choose from the folders that you’ve recently opened.
You can also type the path for a specific folder (use the Go to Folder com-
mand) or connect to a specific network server (use the Connect to Server
command).
Note that most of the Go menu commands include keyboard shortcuts, prov-
ing once again that the fingers are quicker than the mouse.
Monkeying with the Menu Bar
Ever stared at a menu bar for inspiration? Fortunately for Mac owners like
you and me, people in Cupertino are paid to do just that, and these design-
ers get the big bucks to make the Mac OS X menu bar the best that it can be.

Thus were born menu bar icons, which add useful controls in what would
otherwise be a wasted expanse of white.
Using menu bar icons
Depending on your hardware, Mac OS X might install several menu bar
icons. The Volume icon is always there by default, along with the Clock dis-
play, which is actually an icon in disguise. Figure 3-8 illustrates these stan-
dard icons, along with a couple of others.
Some icons won’t appear unless you turn them on. For instance, the Displays
icon won’t appear unless you enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check
box within the Displays pane in System Preferences. The Displays menu bar
icon, which looks like a monitor, allows you to choose from the recom-
mended resolutions and color depth settings for your graphics card and
monitor. For example, the recommended settings for my G5 iMac, which has
an LCD monitor, includes 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, or 1680 x 1050 resolutions,
and my display can be set to thousands or millions of colors. Typically, it’s a
good idea to choose the highest resolution and the highest color depth. You
can also jump directly to the System Preferences Display settings by clicking
Displays Preferences.

To quickly change the audio volume level within Mac OS X, click the Volume
icon (it looks like a speaker with emanating sound waves) once to display its
slider control; then click and drag the slider to adjust the level up or down.
After you select a level by releasing the mouse button, your Mac thought-
fully plays the default system sound to help you gauge the new volume level.
Depending on the functionality that you’re using with Mac OS X, these other
menu bar icons might also appear:
✦Modem status: You can turn on the display of the Modem status icon
from the Internal Modem panel of the Internet Connect application,
which I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 1. Click this icon to connect to or dis-
connect from the Internet by using a modem. You can open the Internet
Connect application from the menu bar icon, and the icon can be set to
show the time that you’ve been connected to the Internet as well as the
status of the connection procedure.
✦AirPort: If you’ve installed an AirPort or AirPort Extreme card in your
Mac, you can check the status of the AirPort connection; click the
AirPort icon to toggle AirPort on or off. The icon displays the relative
strength of your AirPort signal, whether you’re connected to a Base
Station or a peer-to-peer computer network, or whether AirPort is
turned off. You can also switch between multiple AirPort networks from
the menu.
✦PPoE: The display of this icon is controlled from the Ethernet panel of
the Internet Connect application. Click this icon to connect to or discon-
nect from the Internet using Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPoE), which is
a type of Internet connection offered by some digital subscriber line
(DSL) providers.
Doing timely things with the Clock
Even the Clock itself isn’t static eye candy on the Mac OS X menu bar — I
told you this was a hardworking operating system, didn’t I? Click the Clock
display to toggle the icon between the default text display and a miniature
analog clock.
You can also open the System Preferences Date & Time settings from the
icon. From within the Date & Time settings, you can choose whether the sec-
onds or day of the week are included, whether the separators should flash,
or whether Mac OS X should display the time in 24-hour (military) format.

Eject, Tex, Eject!
73
Eject, Tex, Eject!
Mac OS X makes use of both static volumes (your Mac’s hard drive, which
remains mummified inside your computer’s case) and removable volumes
(like USB Flash drives and CDs/DVD-ROMs). Mac OS X calls the process of
loading and unloading a removable volume by old-fashioned terms — mount-
ing and unmounting — but you and I call the procedure loading and ejecting.
I won’t discuss loading/mounting a removable volume — the process differs
depending on the computer because some Macs need a button pushed on
the keyboard, others have buttons on the drive itself, and some drives have
just a slot, with no button at all. However, there are a number of standard
ways of unloading/unmounting/ejecting a removable volume:
✦Drag the Volume icon from the Desktop to the Trash, which changes to
an Eject icon to help underline the fact that you are not deleting the con-
tents of the drive. Let me underline that with a Mark’s Maxim because
Switchers from the Windows world are usually scared to death by the
concept of dragging a volume to the Trash.
Have no fear — in the Apple universe, you can drag removable vol-
umes to the Trash with aplomb.™
✦Click the Volume icon and use the Ô+E keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the File menu and choose Eject.
Mark’s totally unnecessary Computer Trivia 1.0
“Where the heck did mounting come from,
anyway? Sounds like a line from a John Wayne
Western!” Well, pardner, the term dates back
to the heyday of Big Iron — the Mainframe
Age, when giant IBM dinosaurs populated the
computing world. Sherman, set the WayBack
Machine. . . .
At the time, disks were big, heavy, removable
cartridges the diameter of dinner plates (and
about as tall as a 100-count spindle of CD-Rs).
The acolytes of the mainframe, called computer
operators, would have to trudge over to a cab-
inet and swap disk cartridges whenever the
program stopped and asked for them — that’s
right, those mainframes would actually stop
calculating and print, “I need you to mount car-
tridge 12-A-34, or I can’t go any further. Have a
nice day.” (Can you imagine what it would be
like loading and unloading a hard drive every
time you needed to open a folder?)
Anyway, even though eons passed and mini-
computers appeared — which were only the
size of a washing machine — the terms mount-
ing and unmounting still commonly appeared in
programs. This time, the removable volumes
were 8-inch floppy disks and tape cartridges.
Because UNIX and its offspring Linux date from
the Minicomputer Age, these operating sys-
tems still use the terms.

Common Tasks Aplenty
74
✦Click the Eject button next to the device in the Finder window sidebar.
✦Hold down Control and click the Volume icon to display the contex-
tual menu; then choose Eject.
✦Press your keyboard Eject key (if it has one) to eject a CD or DVD from
your built-in optical drive. (If you’re using a keyboard without a
Media Eject key, press F12 instead.)
You can’t unmount a static volume from the Desktop — you have to use the
Disk Utility application — so your internal hard drive icon will stay where 
it is.
Common Tasks Aplenty
Okay, I admit it — this section is kind of a grab bag of three very common
tasks. However, I want to walk you through these three procedures early in
the book. Most Mac owners will want to listen to and record CDs as soon as
Mac OS X is installed, and you’d be amazed how much information still flows
across the Internet in plain, simple text.
Therefore, hang around and take care of business.
Opening and editing text files
Text files would seem to be another anachronism in this age of formatted
Web pages, rich text format (RTF) documents, and word processors galore.
However, virtually every computer ever built can read and write in standard
text, so text files are often used for
✦Information files on the Internet, like FAQs (Frequently Asked Question
files)
✦README and update information by software developers
✦Swapping data between programs, like comma-delimited database files
Here’s the quick skinny on opening, editing, and saving an existing text file:
1. Navigate to your Applications folder and launch TextEdit.
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
3. Navigate to the desired text file and double-click the filename to 
load it.
You can also open an existing text file by dragging its icon from the
Finder window to the TextEdit icon.

4. Click the insertion cursor anywhere in the file and begin typing. Or,
to edit existing text, drag the insertion cursor across the characters to
highlight them and type the replacement text.
TextEdit automatically replaces the existing characters with those that
you type. To simply delete text, highlight the characters and press Delete.
5. After you finish editing the document, you can overwrite the original
by pressing Ô+S (which is the same as choosing File➪Save), or you
can save a new version by choosing File➪Save As and typing a new,
unique filename.
6. To exit TextEdit, press Ô+Q.
Listening to an audio CD
By default, Mac OS X uses iTunes to play an audio CD. Although I cover
iTunes in complete detail in Book III, Chapter 2, take a moment to see how to
master the common task of playing an audio CD (just in case you want to
jam while reading these early chapters). Follow these steps:
1. Load the audio CD into your Mac’s CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive.
An Audio CD volume icon appears on your Desktop.
2. Mac OS X automatically loads iTunes and displays its spiffy window.
3. Click the Play button at the upper left of the iTunes window to begin
playing the disc at the beginning. To play an individual track, double-
click the track name in the iTunes window.
4. To adjust the volume from within iTunes, drag the Volume slider to
the left or right — it’s under the Play button.
5. To eject the disc and load another audio CD, click the Eject CD button
at the lower-right of the iTunes window.
6. To exit iTunes, press Ô+Q.
The first time that you run iTunes, you’re asked to configure the program
and specify whether Mac OS X should automatically connect to the Internet
to download the track titles for the disc you’ve loaded. I recommend that
you accept all the default settings and that you allow automatic connection.
Is simple, no?
Recording — nay, burning — a data CD
Mac OS X offers a built-in CD recording feature that allows you to burn the
simplest form of CD: a standard data CD-ROM that can hold up to approxi-
mately 660MB of files and folders, and can be read on both Macs and PCs
running Windows, UNIX, and Linux. (To burn an audio CD, use iTunes, as I
show you in Book III, Chapter 2.). Naturally, you’ll need a Mac with a CD or
DVD recorder.

Common Tasks Aplenty
76
If you’re interested in recording all the exotic CD and DVD formats available
today, I can heartily recommend the best book on CD and DVD recording on
the shelves: CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by (sur-
prise!) yours truly (Wiley). CD & DVD Recording For Dummies is a compre-
hensive recording guide that shows you how to burn all types of audio, data,
and video by using the latest PC and Mac hardware and the best software on
the planet (Roxio Easy Media Creator for the PC and both iDVD and Toast for
the Mac). I can honestly say that it’s a good read.
Back to the story! To record a disc, follow these steps:
1. Load a blank CD-R, DVD-R, or CD-RW into your drive.
We’ll assume for this demonstration that you’re using a write-once CD-R.
Mac OS X displays an Untitled CD volume icon on your Desktop. (It’s
marked with the letters CDR so you know that the disc is recordable.)
You’ll be prompted for permission to open it.
2. Double-click the Untitled CD icon to display the contents — it’ll be
empty, naturally.
The window tells you that you have 660.7MB of space remaining on the
disc.
3. Click and drag files and folders to the CD window as you normally do.
4. Rename any files or folders as necessary — remember, after you’ve
started recording, this stuff is etched in stone, so your disc window
should look just like the volume window should look on the finished
CD-ROM.
Adding the perfect font with Font Book
Need to install a font in Mac OS X, or perhaps
you’d like to organize your fonts into collections
based on their theme or their designer? If so,
you’re talking about Font Book, which is the
font organizer that ships with Tiger. To open
Font Book, visit your Applications folder and
double-click the Font Book icon.
Press Ô+O (or choose File➪Add Fonts) to
import a new font into your system, or simply
drag the font file from a Finder window into the
Font Book window. Remember: Tiger can
accept both TrueType and OpenType PostScript
fonts. When it’s been added, your new font can
be categorized by dragging it into one of your
collections, thus making that font easier to
locate and display. Individual fonts and entire
collections can be enabled or disabled (by
using the plus and Disable buttons at the
bottom of the Font Book window), so that you
can “turn on” only those fonts that you need for
a specific application or project. The Font Book
window also comes fully equipped with a
Search box, so you can find any font by name.

Otherwise, click the Burn button and sit back and watch the fun.
Unfortunately, Mac OS X doesn’t support recording from the Finder for many

can’t burn from the Finder, I recommend that you buy a copy of Roxio Toast
recording software (www.roxio.com).
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
To close out this chapter, I turn the attention to another task that most Mac
owners need to tackle soon after installing Mac OS X: printing documents.
Because basic printing is so important (and in most cases, so simple), allow
me to use this final section to demonstrate how to print a document.
Most of us have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) printer — the USB being the
favored hardware connection within Mac OS X — so as long as your printer
is supported by Mac OS X, setting it up is as easy as plugging it in to one of
your Mac’s USB ports. The Big X does the rest of the work, selecting the
proper printer software driver from the Library/Printers folder and setting
your printer as the default power of the universe.
Before you print, preview! Would you jump from an airplane without a para-
chute? Then why would you print a document without double-checking it
first? Click Preview, and Mac OS X opens the Preview application to show you
what the printed document will look like. (Once again, some upstart programs
have their own built-in Print Preview mode.) When you’re done examining
your handiwork, close the Preview application to return to your document.
To print from within any application using the default page characteristics —
standard 81⁄2-x-11 inch paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
1. Within your application, click File and choose Print — or press the
Ô+P keyboard shortcut.
2. Mac OS X displays the Print dialog that you see in Figure 3-9.
Some applications use their own custom Print dialogs, but you should
see the same general settings.
3. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies that you
need.
You can also enable or disable collation, just like those oh-so-fancy
copiers.

4. Decide what you want to print.
• The whole shootin’ match: To print the entire document, use the
default Pages radio button setting of All.
• Anything less: To print a range of selected pages, select the From
radio button and enter the starting and ending pages.
5. (Optional) Choose application-specific printing parameters.
Each Mac OS X application provides different panes so that you can con-
figure settings that are specific to that application. You don’t have to dis-
play any of these extra settings to print a default document, but the
power is there to change the look dramatically when necessary. To dis-
play these settings, click the drop-down list box in the Print dialog and
choose one of these panes. For example, if you’re printing from the
Address Book, you can choose the Address Book entry from the drop-
down list and elect to print a phone list or an e-mail list.
6. When everything is go for launch, click the Print button.
Of course, there are more settings and more functionality to the printing
system within Mac OS X, and I cover more complex printing topics in much
more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4 — however, I can tell you from my experi-
ences as a consultant and hardware technician that this short introduction
to printing will likely suffice for 90 percent of the Mac owners on earth. ’Nuff
said.

T
iger introduces Spotlight, Apple’s new desktop search technology that
you can use to find anything on your computer as quickly as you can
type. (Yep, that includes all the documents, Address Book contacts, Mail
messages, folders, and drives that your Mac can access.) Remember, this
search system is only for your Mac. You can’t search stuff on your brother’s
Atari 800 in Dry Prong, Louisiana. (Not even the folks at Apple are that
good.) But if the information is on your Mac’s hard drive, or a CD, or on your
network, consider it located.
This chapter is your ticket to using this new search technology like a profes-
sional techno-wizard from day one. I discuss how Spotlight works, and how
you can use it to locate exactly what you want (and present those results
like a wine steward shows off a fine vintage).
If you’re looking for something on the Internet, you’ll need a different kind of
sleuth: Sherlock, which I cover in the next chapter in this mini-book, is the
Tiger tool of choice for Internet searches.
Basic Searching 101
Figure 4-1 illustrates the Spotlight search field, which is always available
from the Finder menu bar. Click the magnifying glass icon once, and the
Spotlight search box appears.

Basic Searching 101

To run a search, simply click in the Spotlight box and begin typing. You’ll see
matching items appear as soon as you type, as shown in Figure 4-2, and the
search results are continually refined while you type the rest of your search
criteria. Like the Search box in earlier Finder window toolbars, you don’t
need to press Return to begin the search.

Chapter 4
Searching
Everything with
Spotlight
Basic Searching 101
81
The results of your Spotlight search are presented in the Spotlight menu,
which is automatically updated in real time as you continue to type. The top
20 most-relevant items are grouped into categories right on the Spotlight
menu, including Messages, Documents, Folders, Images, Contacts, and so on.
Spotlight takes a guess at the item that’s most likely the match you’re looking
for, and presents it in the special Top Hit category that always appears first.
To open the Top Hit item like a true Tiger power user, just press Ô+Return.
Literally any text string is acceptable as a Spotlight search. However, here’s a
short list of the common search criteria I use every day:
✦Names and addresses: Because Spotlight has access to Tiger’s Address
Book, you can immediately display contact information using any por-
tion of a name or address.
✦E-mail message text: Need to open a specific e-mail message, but you’d
rather not launch Mail and spend time digging through the message list?
Enter the person’s e-mail address or any text string contained in the
message you’re looking for.
✦File and folder names: This is the classic search favorite. Spotlight
searches your entire system for that one file or folder in the blink of 
an eye.
✦Events: Yep, Spotlight gives you access to your iCal calendars.
✦System Preferences: Now things start to get really interesting! Try
typing the word background in the Spotlight field. As you can see in
Figure 4-2, three of the results are actually System Preference panes!
That’s right, every setting in System Preferences is referenced in
Spotlight. (In this case, the Software Update and Classic panes both con-
tain the word background while the desktop background setting is on the
Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences.)
✦Metadata: That’s a pretty broad category, but it fits. For example, I like
to locate Word documents on my system using the same metadata that’s
stored in the file, such as the contents of the Comments field in a Word
document. Other supported applications include Photoshop images,
Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and other third-party appli-
cations that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
To reset the Spotlight search and try another text string, click the X icon that
appears at the right side of the Spotlight box. (Of course, you can also back-
space to the beginning of the field, but that’s a little less elegant.)

Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
82
After you find the item that you’re looking for, you can click it once to
✦Launch it (if the item is an application).
✦Open it in System Preferences (if it’s a setting or description on a
Preferences pane).
✦Open it within the associated application (if the item is a document or a
data item).
✦Display it within a Finder window (if the item is a folder).
Here is another favorite timesaver: You can display all the files of a particular
type on your system by using the file type as the keyword. For example, to
provide a list of all images on your system, just use images as your keyword —
the same goes for movies and audio, too.
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Don’t get fooled into simply using Spotlight as another file-’n-folder-name
search tool. Sure, it can do that, but Spotlight can also search inside PDF and
HTML files, finding matching text that doesn’t appear in the name of the file!
To wit: a search for Tiger on my system pulls up all sorts of items with Tiger
in their names, but also files with Tiger in them:
✦Apple Store SF.ppt (a PowerPoint presentation that contains several
slides containing the text Tiger)
✦576763 bk01ch03.doc (a rather cryptically-named Word file chapter of
this book that mentions Tiger in several spots)
✦Conference Call with Bob (an iCal event pointing to a conference call with
my editor about upcoming Tiger book projects)
Notice that not one of these three examples actually has the word Tiger
occurring anywhere in the title or filename, yet Spotlight found them
because they all contain the text Tiger therein. That, dear reader, is the true
power of Spotlight, and how it can literally guarantee you that you’ll never
lose another piece of information in the hundreds of thousands of files and
folders on your hard drive!

Book I
Chapter 4

Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
83
Heck, suppose that all you remember about a file is that you received it in
your mail last week or last month. To find it, you can actually type in time
periods like yesterday, last week, or last month to see every item that you
saved or received within that period. (Boy, howdy, I love writing about truly
good ideas.)
Be careful, however, when you’re considering a search string. Don’t forget
that Spotlight matches only those items that have all the words you enter in
the Spotlight box. To return the highest number of possible matches, use the
fewest number of words that will identify the item; for example, use horse
rather than horse image, and you’re certain to be rewarded with more hits.
(On the other hand, if you’re looking specifically for a picture of a knight on
horseback, a series of keywords like horse knight image will shorten your
search considerably. It all depends on what you’re looking for, and how
widely you want to cast your Spotlight net.)
Because Spotlight functions are a core technology of Mac OS X Tiger — in
other words, all sorts of applications can make use of Spotlight throughout
the operating system, including the Finder — the Finder window’s Search
box now shares many of the capabilities of Spotlight. In fact, you can use the
time period trick that I mention earlier (entering yesterday as a keyword) in
the Finder window Search box.
Is Spotlight secure?
So how about all those files, folders, contacts,
and events that you don’t want to appear in
Spotlight? What if you’re sharing your Mac as 
a multiuser computer? Will others be able to
search for and access your personal information
through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by Spotlight
are controlled by file and folder permissions and
your account login, just like the applications that
create and display your personal data. For
example, you can’t access other users’ calen-
dars using iCal, and they can’t see your Mail
messages — only you have access to your data,
and only after you’ve logged in with your user-
name and password. Spotlight works the same
way. If a user doesn’t normally have access to
an item, it simply doesn’t appear when that user
performs a Spotlight search. (In other words,
only you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders and
disks from your own Spotlight searches if nec-
essary. Check out the last section of this chap-
ter for details on setting private locations on
your system.

Expanding Your Search Horizons

Okay, parents, listen closely: Here’s a (somewhat sneaky) Tip that might help
you monitor your kid’s computer time as well as what your kids are typing/
reading in iChat AV:
1. Enable the iChat transcript feature.
a. From within iChat, choose iChat➪Preferences.
b. Click Messages.
c. Select the Automatically Save Chat Transcripts check box.
2. Click OK to return to iChat.
Now you can use Spotlight to search for questionable words, phrases,
and names within those iChat transcripts. (For more on iChat AV, turn to
Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Expanding Your Search Horizons
I can just hear the announcer’s voice now: “But wait, there’s more! If you click
the Show All menu item at the beginning of your search results, we’ll expand
your Spotlight menu into the Spotlight Results window!” (Fortunately, you
don’t have to buy some ridiculous household doo-dad.)
Keyboard mavens will appreciate the Spotlight window shortcut key; and I
show you where to specify this shortcut in the last section of this chapter.
You can also press Return immediately after typing your search text into the
Spotlight box to automatically bring up the Results window.
Figure 4-3 illustrates the window; note the category groups at the upper
right. To sort your Spotlight results by a different category, click the desired
group. You can even take this sorting stuff a step further, if necessary. To
change how items are sorted within each group in the list, click the option
that you want under the Sort Within Group By heading.
You can also filter your results listing by the date the items were created or
last saved, or by their location on your system (such as your hard drive,
your Home folder, or a network server). Images appear as thumbnails, so
you can use that most sophisticated search tool — the human eye — to find
the picture you’re looking for. (If you don’t see thumbnail images, click the
Thumbnail button on the Images section header.)

To display more information about any item in the list (without leaving the
comfortable confines of the Results window), click the Info icon (lowercase
italic i in a circle) at the right side of the entry.
Again, when you’re ready to open an item, just click it in the Results 
window.
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
You might wonder whether such a revolutionary new Mac OS X feature has
its own pane within System Preferences — and you’d be right again. Figure
4-4 shows off the brand-new Spotlight pane within System Preferences: Click
the System Preferences icon (look for the light switch) on the Dock, and then
click the Spotlight icon (under Personal) to display these settings.

Click the Search Results tab to
✦Determine which categories appear in the Spotlight menu and Results
window. For example, if you don’t use any presentation software on
your Mac, you can clear the check box next to Presentations to disable
this category (thereby making more room for other categories that you
will use).
✦Determine the order that categories appear in the Spotlight menu and
Results window. Drag the categories to the order you want them to
appear in the Spotlight menu and window. For example, I like the
Documents and System Preferences categories to appear higher in the
list because I use them most often.
✦Specify the Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard
shortcuts. You can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut, and
choose the key combination from the drop-down list box.

Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 4-5) to specify disks and folders
that should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. I know, I know, I
said earlier that Spotlight respected your security, and it does. However, the
disks and folders that you add on this list won’t appear even if you are the
one performing the search. (This is a great idea for folders and removable
hard drives that you use to store sensitive information like medical records.)
To add locations that you want to keep private, click the Add button (bear-
ing a plus sign) and navigate to the desired location. Click the location to
select it, and then click Choose. (Alternatively, you can drag folders or disks
directly from a Finder window and drop them into the pane.)

even maps that help you chart your way to Grandma’s house from wherever
you happen to be on the planet. And yes, all that stuff is there, just waiting
to be used.
However, actually finding anything in the organized chaos that is the
Internet is a completely different matter. A favorite e-mail tagline of mine
reads as follows:
What good is a Web search engine that returns 324,909,188 “matches”? That’s
like saying, “Good news, I’ve located the information you want. It’s on Earth.”
In this chapter, I introduce to you to the famous sleuth who makes it easy to
search for the proverbial needle in the Internet haystack: Sherlock, which is
included in Mac OS X. (One note: If you don’t have an Internet connection,
you can skip this chapter because Sherlock depends entirely upon the
Internet while searching for the information that you need. There’s always a
caveat, right?) And remember that if you’re searching for something already
on your system, check out the new Tiger search tool, Spotlight. (Read all
about your internal sleuth in Book I, Chapter 4.)

Sherlock Is Just Plain Neat
90
Sherlock Is Just Plain Neat
I love Conan Doyle’s character Sherlock Holmes — he’s one of my favorite
fictional figures in literature, as a matter of fact — but even the Bloodhound
of Baker Street would be hard pressed to keep up with the great flood of
information available online. Apple’s Sherlock, on the other hand, was built
to do precisely that. To wit:
✦Help me, Mr. Wizard!: Sherlock simplifies the major search engines and
allows you to access them all from a single location — no longer do you
have to open your Web browser and laboriously visit search engine sites
like Lycos. If you find something on a Web site that you want to explore,
a simple double-click of the item automatically launches your Web
browser and displays that page.
✦Real-time, really: You can also display real-time information by using
Sherlock: Access stock prices, news and headlines, your eBay auctions,
and such.
✦Plug it in: Sherlock can provide additional services through the use of
plug-ins — software add-ons offered by companies, libraries, and Apple
itself that expand the functionality of Sherlock.
✦Show me: Depending on the type of information you’re seeking, Sherlock
can display text, graphics, and even video.
Looking for the Scent with the Great Detective
“By Jove, Watson, the game is afoot!” Depending on your installation of Tiger,
you can launch our computerized sleuth in two ways:
✦Clicking its icon on the Dock, which features Holmes’ hat and magnifying
glass.
✦Opening the Applications folder on your hard drive and double-clicking
the Sherlock icon you’ll find there.
To begin, take a look at the Sherlock window itself — Figure 5-1 does the job
nicely. The most common window configuration (for the Internet channel) is
divided thusly:
✦Use the Channel buttons displayed along the top of the window to quickly
switch between different types of searches. To display all the channels on
a single page — complete with descriptions — click the Channels button
on the toolbar.
✦In the Topic or Description box, type whatever you’re searching for. The
fields in this area can change depending on the type of search that
you’re conducting.

Book I
Chapter 5

Looking for the Scent with the Great Detective
91
✦Click the Search button — the button bearing the suave-looking magni-
fying glass — to start searching the selected sites. (Alternatively, you
can just poke the Return key.)
✦The fruits of your search appear in the results section — for more infor-
mation on an item, double-click it.
✦Clicking an item once often displays a quick summary of the information
in the summary section.
Several channels alter the basic look of the Sherlock window, so not every
channel will offer all these controls.
Note the handles — the double lines — that appear in the separator bars.
You can click and drag these handles to resize the dimensions of the channel
button display and the results section.
To sort a column in Sherlock, just click the column’s heading button. For
example, if you’re looking at your stock portfolio, click the Name column

heading to sort the sites in ascending order. Click again to sort in descending
order (so that the triangle at the corner of the column header points down).
You can also click and drag the right edge of each column’s heading button
to resize the width of the column.
You Don’t Need a Remote for These Channels
As I mention earlier in this chapter, Sherlock calls each different type (or
genre, or class) of search that you can perform a channel. For example, the
default Sherlock channels include
✦Internet: Click this channel to display popular Web search engines.
✦Pictures: Click this channel to search and select content from the Getty
Images online image collection.
✦Stocks: Use this channel to keep track of your stocks and recent head-
lines concerning each company.
✦Movies: Switch to this channel for movie listings and times in your area
or watch the latest movie trailers — now that’s techno-sassy!
✦Phone Book: Use this channel to search for brick-and-mortar 
businesses — just like that ponderous paper phone book — and even
display a map with directions to help you reach a business.
✦eBay: Click this channel and hang onto your wallet as you traverse the
auction place to hang out — search and track your auctions with aplomb.
✦Flights: Check the major airline schedules by departure and arrival city,
as well as flight information like plane type, altitude, and speed — you
can even pinpoint the location of a plane in flight!
✦Dictionary: If you use the Internet for research, this channel is, quite
simply, your Holy Grail. From this one location, you can peruse the
online versions of the American Heritage Dictionary, Webster’s Revised
Unabridged Dictionary, and other reference works.
✦Translation: Need to know the word for taxi in Portuguese? You can
translate phrases and words to and from different languages with this
channel.
✦AppleCare: Clicking this channel brings you to the Apple Knowledge
Base — a virtual gold mine for Sherlock searches — the Macintosh
Product Guide and the Apple Web site.
When troubleshooting a Mac OS X issue, fire up Sherlock and use the
AppleCare channel to check out keywords potentially related to your
problem.
As I mention earlier, you can display all the default channels and a short
description of each channel by clicking the Channels button on the Sherlock

toolbar. From this Channel panel — yes, I actually wrote that — click a chan-
nel icon to begin your search.
To switch channels, just click the desired channel icon at the top of the
Sherlock window.
Tracking Businesses, Movies, Definitions, and Auctions
To demonstrate the Fine Art of Search, I show you in this section how to
locate a business, how to check movie listings, the definition of the word
sleuth, and how to locate a print of Old London on eBay. (Something for
everyone there, wouldn’t you agree?)
Let your mouse do the walking
First, use Sherlock to locate the address and telephone number for a popular
local pizza restaurant. Follow these steps:
1. Launch Sherlock and then click the Phone Book channel button to dis-

By default, Sherlock provides directions starting from your home
address (as provided by your card in the Address Book). However, you
can click the Driving Directions From drop-down list box to select
another starting point for the directions.
The map display at the lower-right corner can be zoomed by dragging the

One of the tasks that I perform most often with Sherlock is searching for
word definitions. Follow these steps to find the definition of a word:
1. Click the Dictionary channel button.
2. Type the word sleuth into the Word to Define box and then click the
Search button.
The definition and synonyms appear, and you didn’t have to turn a

Translating ’Twixt Languages
Although Sherlock can’t help you with the word for bathroom when you’re in
the middle of the street in Berlin, you can use the Translation channel to
translate words and phrases from the comfort of your computer desk. (And
come to think of it, if you have a wireless Internet connection and an iBook, I
guess you could use it in the middle of a foreign street!)
Follow these steps to translate words and phrases:
1. Click the Translation channel button.
2. Type the word or phrase that you want to translate into the Original
Text box.
(Sorry about the very silly line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but
how could I possibly resist?)

You can highlight and copy the translated text into the Clipboard and
then paste it into your word processor or e-mail application.
Want to experience what I call the Tower of Babel Effect (or TBE)? Start
with an English phrase, translate it into a second language, and then
continue to translate the results to another language or two. Finally,
translate the end result back to English and — voilà! You’ll likely be sur-
prised by just how imprecise different languages can be.
Finding Flight Information
Finally, allow me to demonstrate how you can track flight schedules by using
Sherlock — truly, gentle reader, this program is as versatile as Apple claims!
Follow these steps:
1. Click the Flights channel button.
2. Click the Airline drop-down list to narrow your search to specific 
airlines.
To display information on a particular flight, type the flight number into
the Flight Number box.
3. To search by departure city, click the Departure City or Airport Code
drop-down list and then click the desired location.
Note that you can also type a city name or airport code directly into the
Departure City or Airport Code list.
4. To search by arrival city, click the Arrival City or Airport Code drop-
down list and then click the desired location.
Note that you can also type a city name or airport code directly into the
Arrival City or Airport Code list.
5. Click the Search button.
6. Click any flight entry, and Sherlock updates the summary section with
the specific flight information, as shown in Figure 5-11.
To display any leg of the flight, click the Leg drop-down list box.

o you have a well-thumbed address book stuck in a drawer of your office
desk? Or do you have a wallet or purse stuffed with sticky notes and odd
scraps of paper, each of which bears an invaluable e-mail address or phone
number? If so, you can finally set yourself free and enjoy the “Paperless
Lifestyle” of the new millennium with the revolutionary new Rauncho Digital
Address Book! As seen on TV! Only $29.95 — and it doubles as an indestructi-
ble garden hose! But wait! If you order now, we’ll also send you. . . .
Of course, you and I would tune that stuff out as soon as we heard, “As seen
on TV” — but, believe it or not, the Rauncho Digital Address Book does exist
(after a fashion), and you already have one if you’ve installed Mac OS X. It’s
called the Address Book, and in this chapter, I show you how to store and
retrieve all your contact data, including iChat information, photographs, and
much more.
(And before you ask, operators are not standing by.)
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
It’s true that in older versions of Mac OS X, Address Book was relegated to
the minor leagues and usually appeared only when you asked for it within
Mail. Although it could be run as a separate application, there was no con-
venient route to the Address Book from the Desktop, so most Mac owners
never launched it standalone.

Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
106
Starting with Mac OS X Panther, however, the Address Book arrived in the
limelight, earning a default location in the Dock and available whenever you
need it. Although the Address Book can still walk through a meadow hand-in-
hand with Mail, it also flirts with other Mac OS X applications and can even
handle some basic telephony chores all by itself through the use of Services.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the default face of the Address Book, complete with 
a personal address card: your own contact information, which you enter
within the First Use Wizard that I mention in Book I, Chapter 1. This card
carries a special me tag (indicating that it’s your personal card) as well as 
a suave-looking silhouette next to your name in the Name column. Other
Mac OS X applications use the data in your card to automatically fill out
your personal information in all sorts of documents. (In Figure 6-1, I added 
a number of well-known friends as well . . . a few TV characters, a composer
or two. You know the drill.)

Note those cool little dimples that mark the Group and Name column
dividers — click and drag on the dimples, and you can resize the Group and
Name columns as well as the display window on the right. Plus, you can click
the two buttons at the upper-left corner (underneath the window controls)
to hide or show the Group and Name columns.
Entering Contact Information
Unless you’ve actually met and hired a group of DataElves — see the sidebar
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?” — you have to add contacts to your
Address Book manually. Allow me to demonstrate here how to create a new
contact within your Address Book:
1. Launch Address Book from the Dock by clicking its icon.
The icon looks like an old-fashioned paper Address Book with an @
symbol on the cover.
2. Press the Ô+N shortcut to create a new contact. Alternatively, choose
File➪New Card or click the Add a New Person button at the bottom of
the Name column.
Address Book displays the template that you see in Figure 6-2, with the
First name field highlighted and ready for you to type.
3. Enter the contact’s first name and press Tab to move to the Last name
field.
4. Continue entering the corresponding information in each field, press-
ing Tab to move through the fields.
If a field is not applicable (for example, if a person has no home page),
just press Tab again to skip it. You can press Return to add extra lines to
the Address field.
When you complete certain fields — like the Address field — a plus
symbol pops up to the left of the field. That’s the Address Book telling
you that there are additional versions of the field that you can enter as
well. (Think home and work addresses.) Click this plus sign, and you can
enter the other version. For example, if you enter an iChat address for
the contact at home, the plus sign appears; click it, and then you can
enter the contact’s work iChat address, too.
5. To add a photograph to the card, just double-click the thumbnail
square next to the person’s name (or drag an image from a Finder
window on top of the thumbnail square).
Address Book displays an Open dialog that you can use to select the
image.

Entering Contact Information
108
6. When you’re done, click the Edit button (bottom-center) to save the card.
You can edit the contents of a card at any time by displaying it and clicking
the Edit button at the bottom (or by pressing Ô+L, or even by clicking Edit
and choosing the Edit Card menu item). You can also add new fields to a
card, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and the like.
No need to edit a card to add information to the Note field — just click and
type.
You can also add contact cards directly to your Address Book from the Mac
OS X Mail application — go figure. Within Mail, click the message (to high-
light it) from the person whom you want to add, click the friendly Message
menu, and then click Add Sender to Address Book, or press Ô+Y. Naturally,
this doesn’t add supporting information — just the person’s name and e-mail
address (and, if they used Mail on their end to send the message and they
have a photo attached to their personal card, their photo gets imported as
well). Once again, your nimble fingers will have to manually enter the rest.
For more on Mail, see Book IV, Chapter 2.

Don’t forget to add those fax numbers! Tiger can fax from any application —
just click File and choose Print (or press Ô+P) like you always have, and
then click the Fax button at the bottom of the Print dialog. Mac OS X auto-
matically fills in the address for you, but only if the contact has a fax number
entered as a part of the contact card.
If someone sends you a vCard (look for an attachment with a .vcf exten-
sion), consider yourself lucky. Just drag the vCard from the attachment
window in Mail and drop it in your Address Book; any information that the
person wants you to have is automatically added!
To delete a card, click the unlucky name to display the card, click Edit, and
then choose Delete Person.
Using Contact Information
Okay, after you have your contact information in Address Book, what can
you actually do with it? Often, all you really need is a quick glance at an
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?”
In my two decades of travel through the personal
computing world, one lovely recurring fantasy
shared by computer users keeps cropping up
over and over: I call it the DataElf Phenomenon.
You see, DataElves are the hard-working, silicon-
based gnomes in tiny green suspenders who
magically enter all the information that you want
to track into your database (or Address Book, or
Quicken, or whatever). They burrow into your
papers and presto! — out pops all that data,
neatly typed and . . . whoa, Nellie! Let’s stop there.
For some reason, computer users seem to forget
that there are no DataElves. I wish I had a dime
for every time I’ve heard a heartbroken computer
user say, “You mean I have to type all that stuff
in?” (My usual retort is, “Affirmative . . . unless
you want to pay me a hideous amount to do it for
you.”) Make no mistake — adding a lifetime’s
worth of contact information into your Address
Book can be several hours of monotonous and
mind-bendingly boring work, which is another
reason why many computer owners still depend
on paper to store all those addresses. But take
my word for it, dear reader, your effort is worth 
it — the next time that you sit down to prepare a
batch of Christmas cards or you have to find
Uncle Milton’s telephone number in a hurry, you
will appreciate the effort that you made to enter
contact information into your Address Book.
(Just make sure that you — say it with me —
back up your hard drive.)
By the way, if you’ve already entered contact
information into another PIM (short for Personal
Information Manager), you can re-use that data
without retyping everything — that is, as long as
your old program can export contacts in vCard
format. After you export the records, just drag
the vCards into the Address Book window to add
them, or import them by pressing Ô+I. (More on
this at the end of this chapter.)

address. To display the card for any contact within Address Book, just click
the desired entry in the Name column. You can move to the next and previ-
ous cards by using the directional arrow buttons at the bottom-right corner
of the Address Book window.
But wait, there’s more! You can also
✦Copy and paste. The old favorites are still around. You can copy any
data from a card (press Ô+C) and paste it into another open application
(press Ô+V).
✦Send an e-mail message. If you’ve already read through Chapter 3 of this
mini-book, you’ll remember the Mac OS X services feature that I tell you
about. Click and drag to select any e-mail address on a card; then click
the Address Book menu and click the Services menu. Choose Send To.
Bingo! Depending on the information that you select, other services
might also be available.
✦Add an iChat buddy. From within iChat, click the Buddies menu and
then click Add a Buddy to display the dialog that you see in Figure 6-3.
From here, you can select a contact card that has an Instant Messenger
address and add it to your Buddy List.
✦Export contacts to your iPod (or other applications). From within the
Address Book, select the contacts that you want to export, click File,
and then choose Export vCards. Address Book displays a standard Mac
OS X Save dialog. Navigate to the location where you want to save the
cards (for an iPod connected as a FireWire drive, that’s the Contacts
folder) and click Save.

✦Search amongst your contacts. If you’re searching for a specific person
and all you have is a phone number or a fragment of an address, click in
the Search field at the top right of the Address Book window and type
the text. While you continue to enter characters, Address Book shows
you how many contacts contain matching characters and displays just
those entries in the Name column. Now that’s sassy! (And convenient.
And fast as all get-out.) Check out Figure 6-4, where many of the charac-
ters from my favorite TV shows are gathered — note that a number of
very familiar folks share the same address in Gotham City, and I found
them by using the Search field.
Arranging Your Contact Cards
Address Book also provides you with a method of organizing your cards into
groups. A group usually consists of folks with a common link, like your
family, friends, co-workers, and others who enjoy yodeling. For example, you
could set up a Cell Phone group that you can use when syncing data with
your Bluetooth cell phone.
Figure 6-4:

Arranging Your Contact Cards
112
To create a group, choose File➪New Group or press Ô+Shift+N. (Using the
Hollywood method, click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Group
column.) Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column, with a
highlighted text box so that you can type the group name (see Figure 6-5).
After you type the group name, press Return to save it, and then click and
drag the entries that you want to add to the New Group icon.
If you already selected the entries for those contacts that you want to add to
the group, choose File➪New Group from Selection instead. This saves you a
step because the group is created and the members are added automatically.
After you create a New Group, you can instantly display members of that
group by clicking its icon in the Group column. To return to the display of all
your contacts, click the All group button.
To further organize your groups, you can drag and drop a group on top of
another group. It becomes a subgroup, which is handy for things like branch
offices within your company, or perhaps relatives to whom you’re not speak-
ing at the moment.
Click to add a new group.

Using Network Directories
113
Here’s another handy feature of an Address Book group: You can send all the
members of a group the same e-mail message at once. Within Mail, simply
enter the Group name in the To field in the Compose window, and the same
message is sent to everyone. Even Gandalf couldn’t do that (but my copy
editor bets that Dumbledore could).
Using Network Directories
I know, I know, I said earlier that you’d have to enter all your contacts 
yourself — but I was talking about your personal contacts! You can also
access two types of external directories from within Address Book:
✦If you’re a member of a company NetInfo network — and if you don’t
know, ask your wizened network administrator — you can search net-
work directory servers from within Address Book. These servers are
available automatically, so there’s no configuration necessary. Sweet.
✦You can search Internet-based LDAP directories. Sorry, folks, I know that’s
pretty cryptic, but others have written entire books on this technology.
Again, suffice it to say that your network guru can tell you whether LDAP
servers are available to you. (In another blazing display of techno-nerd
acronym addiction, LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.)
With LDAP, you can search a central company directory from anywhere in
the world as long as you have an Internet connection. To configure this
feature, click Address Book from the menu and choose the Preferences
menu item; click the LDAP tab, and then click the button with the plus
sign to enter the specific settings for the server that you want to access.
Your network administrator or the LDAP server administrator can supply
you with these settings.
To search either type of network directory, click the Directories entry in the
Group column and use the Search field like you normally would. Matching
entries display the person’s name, e-mail address, and phone number.
“But hey, Mark, what if I’m not online? My company’s LDAP directory isn’t
much good then, right?” Normally, that’s true. If you’re a mobile user, LDAP
information is only available to you when you’re online and the LDAP server
is available. Ah, but here’s a rocking power user Tip that’ll do the trick for
iBook and PowerBook owners: To make a person’s information always avail-
able, search the LDAP database and drag the resulting entry from the
Directories window to the All group. You’ll import the information to your
local Address Book — and you’ll see it even when you’re not online!

Printing Contacts with Flair
114
Printing Contacts with Flair
Next, consider how to print your contacts (for those moments when you
need an archaic hard copy). Address Book offers two different formats.
By default, Address Book prints on standard US letter-size paper (81⁄2-x-11
inches) in portrait orientation. You can change these settings right from the
Print dialog: Choose File➪Print or press Ô+P. From the Print dialog, you can
choose exotic settings such as legal-size paper or landscape orientation.
Follow these steps to print your contacts:
1. Choose File➪Print or press Ô+P.
Address Book displays the Print dialog.
If you need more than one copy, click the arrows next to the Copies field
to specify the desired number.
Need labels? We’ve got ’em! Click the Style drop-down list box and choose
Mailing Labels to specify what type of label stock you’re using on the
Layout panel. Click the Label button to sort your labels by name or postal
code, choose a font, select a text color, and add an icon or image to your
labels. To switch back to a standard contact list, click Style again and then
click Lists.
2. Select the desired Attributes check boxes to specify which contact
card fields you want to appear in your list.
The Attributes list appears only if you’re printing contacts in Lists style.
3. Click the Preview button to check the appearance of the list or click
the Print button to send the job to the selected printer.
Alternatively, you can create a PDF file in a specified location — a handy
trick to use if you’d rather not be burdened with paper, but you still need
to consult the list or give it to others. (PDF files are a special document
display format developed by Adobe; they display like a printed document
but take up minimal space and can’t be edited.) To display the contents
of a PDF file in Mac OS X, you need only double-click it in the Finder
window, and the built-in Preview application will be happy to oblige.
Swapping Bytes with vCards
A vCard is a standard file format for exchanging contacts between programs
like Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, Eudora, and the Palm computer
desktop. (Heck, if you’re lucky enough to have an iPod, you can even store

Book I
Chapter 6
Keeping Track 
with the Address
Book
Swapping Bytes with vCards
115
vCard data there.) Think of a vCard as an electronic business card that you
can attach to an e-mail message, send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or
exchange with others by using your cellular phone and palmtop computer.
vCard files end with the extension .vcf.
In Address Book, you can create a single vCard containing one or more
selected entries by clicking File and choosing Export vCards. Then, like any
other Mac OS X Save dialog, just navigate to the spot where you want the file
saved, give it a name, and click Save.
To import vCards into Address Book
✦Drag the vCard files that you’ve received to Address Book and drop
them in the application window.
✦Alternatively, choose File➪Import vCards or press Ô+I. From the Open
dialog, navigate to the location of the vCard files that you want to add,
select them, and then click Open.

T
he title of this chapter really sounds like a contradiction in terms, doesn’t
it? The concepts of joy and maintenance will likely be mutually exclusive
to you — and it’s true that most Mac OS X owners would rather work or play
than spend time under the hood, getting all grimy. I understand completely;
maintenance is far less sexy than Call of Duty or PowerPoint.
However, if you do want your work or play uninterrupted by lockups and
crashes — yes, believe it or not, the Big X can indeed take a dive if it’s not
cared for — and you’d like your Mac to perform like Lance Armstrong,
you’ve got to get your hands dirty. That means performing regular mainte-
nance on your hardware, Mac OS X, and your all-important applications,
documents, and folders.

Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
118
Like most techno-types, I actually enjoy pushing my system to the limit and
keeping it running in top form. And who knows — after you become a Tiger
power user, you could find yourself bitten by the maintenance bug as well. In
this chapter, I cover how to take care of necessary tune-up chores, step-by-
step.
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
Nothing lasts forever, and that includes your applications. You might no
longer need an application or maybe you need to remove it to upgrade to a
new version or to reinstall it. Unlike Windows XP, Mac OS X doesn’t have an
Add or Remove Programs utility for uninstalling software — nor does it need
one because virtually all Macintosh applications are self-contained in a single
folder or series of nested folders. (And not by accident . . . it’s always been a
rule for Apple software developers since the first days of the Macintosh.)
Therefore, removing an application is usually as easy as deleting the contents
of the application folder from your hard drive.
Always check the application’s README file and documentation for any spe-
cial instructions before you delete any application folder. If you’ve created
any documents in that folder that you want to keep, don’t forget to move
them before you trash the folder and its contents!
Some applications can leave preference files, start-up applications, or driver
files in other spots on your disk besides their home folder. When you’re
uninstalling a program that has support files in other areas, use the Search
box in the Finder toolbar to locate other files that might have been created
by the application. (I cover this feature in Book II, Chapter 1.)
For example, Figure 7-1 illustrates a Spotlight search that I’ve run on Microsoft
Office 2004. By searching for the word office, I’ve found a number of files 
created in other folders, like the settings file that’s in my Preferences folder.
Typically, you’ll want to delete the main application folder first and then
remove these orphans.
Spring Cleaning, from Allume Systems ($30; www.allume.com), also has the
ability to uninstall a program, as well as a feature that can find and remove
orphaned files left from past applications.

Popping the Hood: Using the Apple System Profiler
Need hard information about your hardware? You might need to determine
precisely what hardware is installed in your Mac for the following reasons:
✦If you’re working with a technical support person to solve a problem:
This person will usually request information about your system, such as
what processor you’re running and how much memory you have.
✦If you’re evaluating an application before you buy it: You’ll want 
to check its minimum system requirements against the hardware on
your Mac.
Figure 7-1:
Locate
support files
after

application
folder.

Popping the Hood: Using the Apple System Profiler
120
✦If you’re considering an upgrade to your Mac: You’ll likely need to
determine how much memory you have, what type it is, and which
memory slots are filled. (The same goes for your hard drive and your
video card, for those Macs with video card slots.) For more on upgrad-
ing your Mac, thumb through Book VI, Chapter 2.
Apple provides Mac OS X with an all-in-one hardware and software display
tool, aptly named Apple System Profiler, which you can find in the Utilities
folder within your Applications folder. You can also reach the Profiler through
the Apple menu (Ú). Just click About This Mac and then click the More Info
button.) As you can see from Figure 7-2, there’s a lot to digest from the System
Profiler window.
Like the folders in a Finder window in list view mode, you can expand or col-
lapse each major heading that appears in a Profiler screen. Just click the tri-
angle that appears to the left of each Contents heading to expand or collapse
that heading.

The System Profiler major headings include
✦Hardware: This heading tells you volumes about your hard drives —
forgive me — as well as specifics concerning your CD and DVD drives,
modem, AirPort and Bluetooth hardware, graphics hardware, AC power
settings, and any FireWire and USB devices connected to your system.
Figure 7-3 illustrates the information from my USB screen, with many of
the devices expanded so that you can see them. (The text you see at the
bottom half of the window is the detailed information on the item that’s
selected.)
✦Network: This heading shows a listing of your network configuration,
active network connections, and other assorted network paraphernalia.
You’ll probably need this screen only when asked by a technical support
person for the network protocols that you’re using, but it’s handy
nonetheless. (You’ll find details on your network connection here that
you can’t find anywhere else in Tiger.)
Figure 7-3:

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
122
✦Software: Okay, this heading shows something useful to the average
human being! This screen lists all the applications, fonts, and preferences
recognized on your start-up volume, along with their version numbers. If
you’re wondering whether you need to update an application with a
patch file (to fix bugs in the software) or update a file from the developer,
you can look here to check the current version number for the applica-
tion. You also get a rather boring list of the extensions (or drivers) used
by Mac OS X applications. Logs are usually valuable only to tech support
personnel; they document recent lockups, application crashes, and even
system crashes.
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
Our next stop in Maintenance City is a useful little application called Activity
Monitor, which is specially designed to show you just how hard your CPU,
hard drives, network equipment, and memory modules are working behind
the scenes. To run Activity Monitor, open the Utilities folder in your
Applications folder.
To display each different type of usage, click the buttons in the lower half of
the window; the lower panel changes to reflect the desired type (see Figure
7-4). For example, if you click System Memory, you see the amount of unused
memory; click CPU or Network to display real-time usage of your Mac’s CPU
and network connections.
Processes For Dummies
“Mark, what’s that arcane-looking list doing in
the middle of the Activity Monitor window in
Figure 7-4?” I’m glad you asked. A process is a
discrete task (either visible or invisible) that
Tiger performs in order to run your applications.
(Some processes are executed by Tiger just to
keep itself running.) For example, the Dock and
Finder are actually processes, as are Adobe
Acrobat and iPhoto.
You can quit a specific process within Activity
Monitor. Just click the offending process in the
list and then click the Quit Process button on
the Activity Monitor toolbar. But tread carefully,
Mr. Holmes, for there’s danger afoot. For exam-
ple, deleting a system process (like the Dock or
Finder) can result in all of Mac OS X locking up!
Therefore, delete a process only if instructed
to do so by a support technician. From the
Apple menu, choose Force Quit to terminate a
misbehaving application instead.

Chapter 7
The Joys of
Maintenance
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
123
You can also display a separate window with your CPU usage; choose
Window➪Show CPU Usage or press Ô+2. There are three different types of
central processing unit (CPU, which is commonly called the “brain” of your
Macintosh) displays available from Activity Monitor:
✦Floating CPU window: This is the smallest display of CPU usage; the
higher the CPU usage, the higher the reading on the monitor. You can
arrange the floating window in horizontal or vertical mode from the
Window menu.
✦CPU Usage window: This is the standard CPU monitoring window, which
uses a blue thermometer-like display. The display works the same as the
floating window.
✦CPU History window: This scrolling display uses different colors to 
help indicate the percentage of CPU time being used by your applica-
tions (green) and what percentage is being used by Tiger to keep things
running (red). You can use the History window to view CPU usage over
time.
Figure 7-4:
Keep tabs
on Tiger and
what you’re
running.

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
124
Whichever type of display you choose, you can drag the window anywhere
that you like on your Mac OS X Desktop. Use the real-time feedback to deter-
mine how well your system CPU is performing when you’re running applica-
tions or performing tasks in Mac OS X. If this meter stays peaked for long
periods of time while you’re using a range of applications, your processor is
running at full capacity.
You can even monitor CPU, network, hard drive, or memory usage right from
the Dock! Choose View➪Dock Icon; then choose what type of real-time graph
you want to display in your Dock. (Feeling like a Tiger power user yet? I
thought so.) When you’re monitoring CPU usage from the Dock, the green
portion of the bar indicates the amount of processor time used by applica-
tion software, and the red portion of the bar indicates the CPU time given to
the Mac OS X operating system (just like the CPU History window).
So what’s a disk image?
You might have noticed the New Image button
on the Disk Utility toolbar (or the image creation
commands on the File➪New submenu). If you’re
wondering what a disk image is, you’ve come
to the right place. Think of a disk image as a file
that looks (and acts) like an external storage
device within Tiger; for example, a mounted
disk image operates much like a CD or DVD,
and it can be ejected just like a disc. Images
can be read-only (just like a standard CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM), or they can be created blank
(just like an empty hard drive), ready to accept
files and folders that you copy using the Finder.
So what are images used for? They’re great for
storing data that would normally have to be
loaded from a CD or DVD (a great convenience
if you don’t want to lug optical media along with
you during a vacation). Remember, a disk image
acts just like removable storage media as far as
Tiger’s concerned. Many Mac Web sites also
offer images as download files because a
simple double-click is all that’s necessary to
automatically mount a disk image. (Software
developers like words like fast and simple
when offering their shareware and demo appli-
cations to the public.)
Finally, images are often used to create simple
archives of little-used data: The images can
be burned to CD/DVD or even copied to other
hard drives. Oh, and don’t forget the security
aspect — you can choose to encrypt the data
stored in an image, protecting it from prying
eyes. (However, I don’t recommend using disk
images to create full backups of your Mac’s hard
drives; more on this elsewhere in the chapter.)
If you’re intrigued, I encourage you to click New
Image on the Disk Utility toolbar (see Figure 7-10)
and create a simple, unencrypted blank disk
image on your Desktop. Then you can experi-
ment with it. A disk image can be ejected to
unmount it (just like a CD/DVD, an iPod, or a
USB Flash drive), and you can delete the image
file at any time. (Just remember not to delete it
if it contains anything you want to keep, of
course . . . but you knew that already.)

Note, however, that seeing your CPU capacity at its max does not necessarily
mean that you need a faster CPU or a new computer. For example, when I’m
running memory-ravenous applications such as Photoshop or Premiere, the
Activity Monitor on my iMac G5 is often pegged (indicating maximum use)
for several seconds at a time. The rest of the time, it barely moves. Whether
a computer is actually fast enough for you and the applications that you run
is more of a subjective call on your part.
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Another important application in your maintenance toolbox is the Disk
Utility, which you’ll find — no surprise here — in the Utilities folder within
your Applications folder. When you first run this program, it looks something
like Figure 7-5, displaying all the physical disks and volumes on your system.
The Disk Utility application has its own toolbar that you can toggle on and
off. Click the lozenge-shaped button at the upper-right corner of the window
to display or hide the toolbar.
Figure 7-5:

Tiger’s Disk

Displaying the goods on your disks
The volume tree structure on the left of the Disk Utility window lists both the
physical disks and the partitions that you’ve set up. A partition is nothing
more than another word for volume, which is the formatted section of a disk
that contains data. A single physical hard drive can contain several partitions.
The information display at the bottom of the Disk Utility window contains
data about both the volumes and the partitions on your hard drive.
To illustrate: On my system, clicking the drive labeled 149.1 GB (the physical
hard drive at the top of the tree) displays a description of the drive itself,
including its total capacity, interface (connection type), and whether the
drive is internal or external. (See Figure 7-6.)
Clicking the tree entry for Wolfgang, however — that’s the name of the parti-
tion that I created when I formatted the drive — displays information about
the type of formatting, the total capacity of the partition and how much
of that is used, and the number of files and folders stored on the partition
(as shown at the bottom of Figure 7-7).

Playing doctor with First Aid
From the First Aid pane, Disk Utility can be used to verify (or check) any disk
(well, almost any disk) for errors, as well as repair any errors that it finds.
Here are the two exceptions when the buttons are disabled:
✦The start-up disk: Disk Utility can’t verify or repair the start-up disk —
that’s Mac talk for the boot drive that contains the Mac OS X system that
you’re using at the moment — which makes sense if you think about it
because that drive is currently being used!
If you have multiple operating systems on multiple disks, you can boot
from another Mac OS X installation on another drive to check your cur-
rent start-up disk. Or, you can boot your system from the original Mac
OS X installation CD and run Disk Utility from the Installation menu.
Your start-up disk is automatically verified and repaired (if necessary)
during the boot procedure, so you really don’t need to worry about
checking the start-up disk.
Figure 7-7:
Display data
on a volume.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
128
✦Write-protected disks: Although you can use the Disk Utility to verify CDs,
DVDs, and write-protected removable disk drives (like a write-protected
Zip disk), it can’t repair them. (Sound of my palm slapping my forehead.)
You also can’t repair a disk that has open files that are currently being
used. If you’re running an application from a drive or you’ve opened a
document that’s stored on that drive, you won’t be able to repair that
drive.
You can also elect to verify and repair permissions (also called privileges) on
a disk; these are the read/write permissions that I discuss in detail in Book II,
Chapter 6. If you can’t save or move a file that you should be able to access, I
recommend checking that drive for permissions problems. Unlike fixing disk
errors, you can verify and repair permissions on any volume that contains a
Mac OS X installation (whether it was used to boot your Mac or not).
In order to verify or repair, you must be logged in as an admin-level user.
To verify or repair a drive, first select the target volume/partition in the list
at the left. To check the contents of the drive and display any errors, click
the Verify Disk button. Or, to verify the contents of the drive and fix any prob-
lems, click the Repair Disk button. (I usually just click Repair Disk because an
error-free disk will need no repairs.) Disk Utility displays any status or error
messages in the scrolling list; if you’ve got eagle eyes, you’ll note that the
window can be resized so that you can expand it to display more messages.
(You can also drag the dot between the left and right panes to expand the list.)
I generally check my disks once every two or three days. If your Mac is caught
by a power failure or Mac OS X locks up, however, it’s a good idea to immedi-
ately check disks after you restart your Mac. (Don’t forget that the start-up
volume is automatically checked and repaired, if necessary.)
A number of very good commercial disk repair utilities are on the market.
My favorite is Drive 10 from Micromat ($70; www.micromat.com) — however,
Disk Utility does a good job on its own, and it’s free.
Erasing without seriously screwing up
“Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!” That’s right, Robot, it is indeed very easy to
seriously screw up and get Lost in Erase. (Man, I can’t believe I actually typed
such a bad pun. I have no shame.) Anyway, it’s time for another of Mark’s
Maxims. To paraphrase the rules for handling a firearm responsibly:
Never click this button unless you mean to use it.™
Figure 7-8 illustrates the Erase controls within Disk Utility. You need erase a
disk or volume only when you want to completely wipe the contents of that
existing disk or volume. You can also erase a rewriteable CD (CD-RW) or DVD
(DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM) from this pane.

✦Erasing an entire disk deletes all volumes on the disk and creates a single
new, empty volume.
✦Erasing a volume only wipes the contents of that specific volume, leaving
all other volumes on the physical disk untouched.
To erase, follow these steps:
1. From the Erase panel within Disk Utility, click the disk or volume icon
that you want to erase from the list on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the format that you want to use from the Volume Format drop-
down list.
Always choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) entry from the Volume
Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File
System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File
System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). In some cases,
Disk Utility will force you to choose the Mac OS Extended entry instead,
but the end result is the same. Note that you do not need to format a disk
or volume with the MS-DOS File System just to read or write a floppy or
a Zip disk from a PC system — Mac OS X recognizes MS-DOS removable
media without a problem.

3. In the Name field, type the name for the volume.
If you’re erasing an existing volume, the default is the existing name.
4. If you’re worried about security, click Security Options and specify
the method you want to use.
By default, this is set to Don’t Erase Data, so Disk Utility doesn’t actually
overwrite any data while formatting — instead, it simply trashes the
existing directory, rendering that data unreachable. Or is it? With some
third-party disk utilities, some unscrupulous bum could actually recover
your files if you choose, so you can specify alternate, more secure meth-
ods of erasing a disk or volume. Unfortunately, these more secure erasure
methods can take a horrendous amount of time.
Therefore, it’s okay to use the Don’t Erase Data option unless you want
to make sure, or use the Zero Out Data to take a more secure route with
the least amount of extra waiting. For example, you’d want to use the
Zero Out Data option if you’re selling your Mac on eBay and you’re for-
matting the drive for the new owner.
You can even click Erase Free Space to wipe the supposedly “clean”
areas of your drive before you format. Man, talk about airtight security!
Again, the Zero Out method is the fastest.
5. Click the Erase button.
In the sheet that appears, click Erase to confirm that you do actually
want to do the deleterious deed.
Partitioning the right way
From time to time, just about everyone wishes they had additional volumes
handy for organizing files and folders, or at least a little extra space on a par-
ticular partition. If you find yourself needing another volume on a disk — or
if you need to resize the total space on existing volumes on a disk — click
the Partition tab within Disk Utility to display the controls that you see in
Figure 7-9. (Make sure that you select a disk and not a partition.) From here,
you can choose a volume scheme, creating anywhere from 1 to 16 volumes
on a single disk.
You can’t monkey around with the partitions on a start-up disk because
Mac OS X is currently running on that disk. Think about removing your own
appendix, and you’ll get the idea.

To set up the partitions on a disk, follow these steps:
1. From the Partition panel within Disk Utility, click the disk icon
(left side of the pane) that you want to partition.
2. Click the Volume Scheme drop-down list and choose the total number
of volumes that you want on the selected disk.
3. Click the first volume block in the partition list (under the Volume
Scheme drop-down list) to select it.
I have only one for this disk, as you can see.
4. Click in the Name field and enter the name for the selected volume.
5. From the Format drop-down list, choose a format for the volume.

Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File
System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File
System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
6. Type a total size for this volume in the Size field.
7. After you set up your first volume partition, mark the Locked for
Editing check box to prevent any further changes to that volume.
8. If you’re creating multiple volumes, click the next volume block to
select it and repeat Steps 4–7.
9. To delete a partition from your new scheme, click the unwanted
volume and then click the Delete button to remove it.
If the partition is locked, you’ll need to clear the Locked for editing
check box before deleting it.
10. To split a partition from your new scheme into two volumes, click the
desired volume and then click the Split button.
Some folks create multiple volumes so that they can boot from multiple
versions of Tiger — like us author types.
If the partition is locked, you need to clear the Locked for Editing check
box before splitting it.
11. When everything is set to your liking, click the Partition button to
begin the process.
If you suddenly decide against a partition change, click the Revert
button to return to the original existing partition scheme.
The Revert button is available only before you click the Partition button!
If you have more than one partition, check out the bar(s) with a handle sepa-
rating the volumes in the partition list. If you leave all your partitions unlocked
(by leaving the Locked for Editing check box disabled), you can click and drag
these separator bars to dynamically resize the volumes. This makes it easy
to adjust the individual volume sizes for the disk until you get precisely the
arrangement you want. If a volume is locked, it can’t be resized dynamically
in this fashion.
RAID has nothing to do with insects
The final stop on the Disk Utility hayride isn’t for everyone — as a matter of
fact, only a Mac OS X power user with a roomful of hardware is likely to use

it. RAID, Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is actually what
it says. In normal human English, a RAID set is a group of multiple separate
disks, working together as a team. Using RAID can
✦Improve the speed of your system
✦Help prevent disk errors from compromising or corrupting your data
The RAID controls within Disk Utility are illustrated in Figure 7-10. (Note that
I’ve turned on the Disk Utility toolbar as well, just to show you what it looks
like.) You’ll need at least two additional hard drives on your system besides
the start-up disk, which I don’t recommend that you use in a RAID set.
Figure 7-10:
The Disk

Updating Mac OS X
134
To set up a RAID array in Mac OS X, follow these steps:
1. From the RAID tab of Disk Utility, click and drag the disks from the list
at the left to the Disk box at the right.
2. Click the RAID Type drop-down list to specify the type of RAID that
you need.
• Striped RAID Set: Choosing this can speed up your hard drive per-
formance by splitting data between multiple disks.
• Mirrored RAID Set: Choosing this increases the reliability of your 
storage by creating a mirror backup of that data across multiple
disks.
3. Click in the RAID Set Name field and type the name for your RAID set.
4. From the Volume Format drop-down list, choose a format for the 
volumes.
Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Volume Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File
System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). Journaling helps
reduce the amount of disk fragmentation and also helps speed up your
hard drive’s performance.
5. Click the Create button.
Updating Mac OS X
As any good software developer should, Apple constantly releases improve-
ments to Mac OS X in the form of software updates. These updates can include
all sorts of fun stuff, like
✦Bug fixes
✦Improvements and new features
✦Enhanced drivers
✦Security upgrades
✦Firmware upgrades
Apple makes it easy to keep Mac OS X up-to-date with the Software Update
controls in System Preferences (see Figure 7-11). Alternatively, you can choose
the Apple menu and then choose Software Update. To check for new updates
periodically, enable the Check for Updates check box. Then from the drop-
down list box, choose how often you want these updates. (I suggest at least
weekly, if not daily.) For a manual check, make sure that you’re connected to
the Internet and then click the Check Now button.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
135
To download updates automatically, mark the Download Important Updates
in the Background check box to enable it; the Big X politely downloads the
updates behind the scenes and then alerts you that they’re ready to be
installed. (With automatic downloading disabled, Mac OS X displays any
available updates with short descriptions, and you can toggle the installa-
tion of a specific update by enabling or disabling the check boxes next to it.)
I recommend installing all updates, even for hardware that you don’t have
yet. For example, I always install AirPort updates even though I don’t use an
AirPort connection at home. The reason? Often, the functionality covered by
an update may include system software that you do use, so you’ll still bene-
fit from installing it.
After you specify the updates that you want to install, click the Install button
to begin the update process. You might have to reboot after everything has
been installed.
To see which updates you’ve already installed, click the Installed
Updates tab.
I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I know we’re friends, but there’s no excuse for not backing up your data. The
more valuable and irreplaceable that your documents are, the more heinous
it is to risk losing them. (I don’t get to use the word heinous in many of my
books, but it fits really well here.)
Figure 7-11:

I Further Demand That You Defragment
136
Although Apple does include the ability to create disk images and restore
them in the Disk Utility (see the sidebar titled “So what’s a disk image?” ear-
lier in this chapter), I’m not going to recommend that you use disk images for
backups. (Insert sound of stunned silence here.) That’s because the restore
process can be confusing, and the disk image method doesn’t offer the level
of control that you need when it comes to backing up individual files and
folders (or selectively backing up by date or recent use). Only a bona fide
backup application gives you such flexibility and convenience . . . and that’s
why Tiger power users turn to true-blue backup software for help.
If you’ve subscribed to Apple’s .Mac service, a back-up utility is included,
but it’s not a part of the default Mac OS X package. Therefore, if you’re not
a .Mac member, you can turn to a commercial back-up application for your
salvation — my personal recommendation is Retrospect, from EMC Dantz
(www.dantz.com). This well-written “software bungee cord” has saved my
posterior more than once.
Using Retrospect is cheap security, but if you can’t afford it at the moment,
take a second to at least back up your most important documents by copy-
ing them to a rewriteable CD or a Zip disk. Don’t trust a floppy (if your Mac is
actually old enough to sport a floppy drive); they’re far too unreliable. With
this poor man’s backup, even if you lose your entire hard drive, you can still
restore what matters the most.
I Further Demand That You Defragment
Defragmenting your hard drive can significantly improve its performance.
Using a defragmenter scans for little chunks of a file that are spread out across
the surface of your hard drive and then arranges them to form a contiguous
file. After a file has been optimized in this way, it’s far easier and faster for
Mac OS X to read than reassembling a fragmented file.
However, Apple dropped the ball on this one and didn’t include a defragmenter
with Mac OS X. Luckily, many third-party disk utilities (like Micromat Drive 10
from www.micromat.com) also includes a defragmenting feature. If you have
a defragmenter, I recommend that you use it once a month.
Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times
Mac OS X includes a number of special keys that you can use during the
boot process. These keys really come in handy when you need to force your
operating system to do something that it normally wouldn’t, like boot from a
CD instead of the hard drive.

Crave the Newest Drivers
137
✦To boot from a CD or DVD: Restart your Mac while pressing the C key.
This is a great way to free up your start-up volume when you want to
test it or optimize it using a commercial utility.
✦To eject a recalcitrant disc that doesn’t show up on the Desktop:
Restart Mac OS X and hold down the mouse button — or if you have
a late-model Mac, press the Media Eject key as soon as you hear that
magnificent startup chord.
✦To force your Mac to boot in Mac OS X: Hold down the X key while
restarting or booting the Mac.
✦To display a system boot menu: Hold down the Option key while
restarting or booting the Mac, and you can choose which operating
system you want to use.
✦To prevent start-up applications from running during login: Hold down
the Shift key while you click the Login button on the Login screen. If you
don’t see the Login screen during startup, just hold down Shift while
Mac OS X boots until the Finder menu appears.
Crave the Newest Drivers
No chapter on maintenance would be complete without a reminder to keep
your hardware drivers current. Drivers are simply programs that allow your
Mac to control hardware devices, like a video card or a Small Computer
System Interface (SCSI) card that you’ve added to your Mac. The Mac OS X
Software Update feature that I discuss earlier in the section “Updating Mac
OS X” provides most of the drivers that you’ll need for things like printers,
USB and FireWire peripherals, and digital cameras, but it’s still very impor-
tant to check those manufacturer Web sites.
Like the software updates from Apple, updated drivers can fix bugs and even
add new features to your existing hardware, which is my definition of some-
thing for nothing.

In This Chapter
 Understanding how Classic mode works
 Locating Classic applications, files, and folders
 Configuring Classic mode
 Restarting in Mac OS 9.2
T
o someone as familiar as you are with Mac OS X, using applications in
Mac OS 9 is like watching an evening of Lawrence Welk — you know
that this music used to be cutting-edge, and that tap-dancer used to be cool,
but now it all seems . . . well . . . horribly wrong. (I don’t mean to offend the
champagne-music crowd — Lawrence and the band were really quite good.
Perhaps it’s those unspeakable robin’s-egg blue tuxedos that give me such a
headache.)
We’re lucky because virtually all of popular Mac applications have been
updated for the Big X, but the process isn’t yet complete. Most older appli-
cations still run only in Classic mode, so if you’re using an older Mac and
older applications, it’s practically a sure thing that sooner or later you’ll
launch an application, see the bouncing number 9 on the Dock, and realize
that means Classic is revving up. For those times, this chapter will prove a
soothing balm.
Classic Mode Explained
Let’s start with a definition: Classic mode is actually an implementation of
Mac OS 9 that runs in Mac OS X. Think of it as a virtual session of Mac OS 9
that runs whenever you need it — although you won’t actually see the
Mac OS 9 session after it boots up. Instead, Classic runs in the background,
providing breathing space for applications that wouldn’t otherwise run in
Mac OS X.

Classic Mode Explained
140
The beauty of Classic is that virtually all older applications run fine in Classic
mode, and they have absolutely no idea that they’re actually working under
Mac OS X. Any problems that you’re likely to experience in Classic mode stem
from “confused” hardware that can’t communicate through ports that are still
controlled through Mac OS X, or the same “shared” memory problems that
plagued older versions of Mac OS. (Sigh.) In other words, if a lockup could
happen in a “real” Mac OS 9 session, it can also happen in Classic mode . . .
but luckily, the only thing that would crash is the Classic environment itself,
so the rest of your Mac OS X applications should continue working without
a hitch. (In fact, you can launch Classic from System Preferences, as I show
you later in this chapter, and try to run the Classic application again without
wreaking havoc on the rest of Mac OS X.)
If you need to use an application from time to time that simply won’t run cor-
rectly under Classic mode at all, you might be able to take drastic measures
and restart under Mac OS 9, which I demonstrate at the end of this chapter.
(Unfortunately, today’s Macintosh models won’t boot into Mac OS 9, so this
is no longer an option for those using recent Mac models based on the G4
processor (as well as all Macs using the G5 processor.)
Tiger no longer installs a Classic System Folder by default on new hardware.
If you buy a new Mac and need Classic, you’ll have to install it. For instruc-
tions on installing a Classic System Folder, crank up Safari and enter this
URL: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=86775.
Of Carbon and Cocoa . . .
First, a word about why Classic mode is required
in the first place — you can politely brush past
this section if you’re not interested in the Grand
Design, and I’ll catch up with you in a paragraph
or two.
Still here? Okay. Here’s the chop. Mac OS X
applications are written by using two software
development APIs (nerdspeak for Application
Program Interfaces). An APIspecifies how a pro-
gram communicates with the operating system.
Mac OS X recognizes two programming APIs:
Carbon and Cocoa. A Carbon application runs
in both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X. A Cocoa
application runs only under Mac OS X, such as
Microsoft Office 2004. Cocoa applications per-
form significantly better than Carbon under
Mac OS X, and Cocoa’s structure allows soft-
ware developers to finish an application faster.
If a program supports either Carbon or Cocoa, it’ll
work within Mac OS X (with a Cocoa application
providing the better performance). However, if
the program is older and was exclusively writ-
ten for earlier versions of Mac OS without
Carbon, it won’t run in Mac OS X, and Classic
mode automatically launches to run the appli-
cation in a comfortable environment.

Book I
Chapter 8
Using Classic Mode
Cranking Up Classic
141
Cranking Up Classic
The four methods of running Classic mode are
✦Double-click an application without Cocoa or Carbon support. In other
words, launch an older application. As I mention earlier, you’ll see the
sprightly bouncing Classic mode icon appear in the Dock, and a minimal
progress bar appears (as shown in Figure 8-1). Click the arrow next to
the progress bar to expand the Classic window and watch the boot
process, just as if you were actually staring at Mac OS 9. After Classic
mode loads, the Classic icon disappears from the Dock, the Mac OS 9
boot window/progress bar disappears, and the application menu and
window appear.
Note that applications running in Classic use the Mac OS 9 menu bar,
and Classic mode windows have the older Mac OS 9 window controls.
In fact, here’s an easy way to tell whether an application is running in
Classic mode: Just to look at the Apple logo (Ú) in the top-left corner
of the screen! If it’s a solid-colored apple, the active application is a
native Mac OS X application. On the other hand, if the apple appears
as the traditional six-color logo, the active application is running in
Classic mode.
✦Launch Classic from System Preferences. Click the System Preferences
icon on the Dock and choose Classic settings to display the dialog that
you see in Figure 8-2. Click the Start button.
✦Launch Classic from the Mac OS X Finder menu bar icon. If you’ve
enabled the Show Classic Status in Menu Bar check box (on the same
Classic settings panel in System Preferences), you get a nifty Classic icon
on your menu bar. You can click this menu bar icon to start, stop, or
restart Classic mode — or you can click Open Classic Preferences to 
display the Classic settings panel.
Figure 8-1:
Starting
Classic
mode with
just the pro-
gress bar.

Cranking Up Classic
142
✦Configure Classic to run automatically. To start Classic automatically
when you log in to Mac OS X — on a system on which you’re the only
user, that means when you boot your computer — click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock and choose Classic settings. Mark the Start
Classic When You Login check box to enable it, and then press Ô+Q to
exit System Preferences and save the change.
Tiger can hide Classic in the background when it runs automatically.
Mark the Hide Classic While Starting check box to enable it, and you’ll
never know that your little friend is alongside you. With this check box
disabled, you get the standard Classic startup mode with the progress bar.
(Oh, and one more caveat to the “hidden” Classic mode: If you enable
the Classic icon on the Finder menu bar, the icon will always let you
know that Classic is starting up. The little snitch . . .)
After Classic mode is running on your Mac, any number of Mac OS Classic
applications can use it. You have to launch Classic only once, and it remains
running until you log out, Mac OS X is restarted, or Classic mode goes to
sleep (more on this nocturnal behavior later in the section “Configuring
Classic Mode”).

To stop Classic mode — thus freeing up both system RAM (memory) and
your processor, as well as improving the performance of other Mac OS X
applications — open System Preferences, choose Classic settings, and click
Stop on the Start/Stop pane. (Alternatively, if the Classic icon is displayed in
your Finder menu bar, just click it and choose Stop Classic from the menu.)
Reaching That Antique Software
If you upgraded from Mac OS version 8 or 9 to Mac OS X, you’ll be happy to
know that all those legacy applications that you used before are still avail-
able. You can find them in a number of places on your system:
✦Applications (Mac OS 9) folder: Mac OS X places all the applications
that existed on your drive in the old Applications folder into this new
folder — and, in turn, all the new Mac OS X applications added to your
system are stored in the Applications folder. Although slightly schizo-
phrenic, it’s a great solution that actually works. After you upgrade to
Mac OS X, simply look in the Applications folder for your Mac OS X
native applications and open the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder for
your older stuff.
Many new Mac OS X native applications that use the Carbon API will
also install an alias (known as a shortcut to the Windows crowd) in your
Applications (Mac OS 9) folder so that you can easily run them when
you restart in Mac OS 9. If a Mac OS X application runs under Mac OS 9
but doesn’t automatically create an alias (how rude!), it takes but a
second to add the alias yourself in the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder.
(For more about aliases, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
✦The Mac OS 9 Desktop: Yep, you heard right, you can still reach the
icons and programs on your Mac OS 9 Desktop, including folders and
aliases. (Any changes that you make to this “Desktop in a Folder” in
Mac OS X will naturally be reflected when you restart in Mac OS 9.)
To reach your Mac OS 9 Desktop items from within the Finder window,
open the System Folder. Remember, this is your Mac OS 9 System Folder,
not the Mac OS X System folder (note the whomping big loss of the word
Folder there; it’s important). Within, you’ll find the Desktop Folder, which
contains the same Mac OS 9 items as the folder on your Desktop. Hang on,
I need more Diet Coke . . . it always helps me when I’m nearing a state of
confusion.

Configuring Classic Mode

Configuring Classic Mode
The default System Preferences settings for the Classic environment can be
tweaked to enhance performance or to change when Classic starts or how it
operates. These settings include the following:
✦Startup and Other Options: Click the Advanced tab to display the options
that you see in Figure 8-3. From the drop-down list box, you can elect to
start Classic with extensions off or to start the Classic Extensions Manager
to individually toggle Control Panels and Extensions on or off. Select the
Use Key Combination option and type up to five keys — one at a time —
that should be simultaneously pressed when you start Classic (which
allows you to simulate Mac OS 9 startup keys). Note: These Advanced
startup options work only when you launch Classic manually from this
panel using the Start Classic button.
✦Putting Classic to sleep: Click and drag the Classic Sleep slider to specify
the amount of inactivity that will trigger the sleep option. When Classic
is asleep, it uses much less system memory and doesn’t bog down your
Mac’s CPU. And, when a Classic application is launched, it takes Mac 
OS X far less time to activate Classic from Sleep mode than it does to
start Classic from scratch. To disable the Classic Sleep option, move the
slider to Never. After it’s running, Classic will continue to remain active
in the background until you manually stop it (as I describe earlier in this
chapter).

✦Rebuilding your Classic Desktop: Click the Rebuild Desktop button to
regenerate the Classic Desktop file. This process stores data on which
icons go with which Classic applications. This also sets which types of
documents link to which Classic applications. Normally, you need do
this only if your Classic applications no longer have the proper icons or
if double-clicking a document created with a Classic application no longer
launches the proper application.
To see what’s running in the Classic environment — something roughly akin to
asking, “I wonder how refrigerant is circulated in my central air conditioning
system?” — click the Memory/Versions tab of the Classic System Preferences
dialog. You’ll see how many Classic applications are running, the amount of
memory that they’re actually using, and the maximum amount of memory
that they’re allowed to have. To show what’s running in the background in
Classic mode, mark the Show Background Processes check box to enable it.
This dialog also displays the version of Mac OS that Classic is using. (If you’re
not interested in what’s happening behind the curtain in the Classic environ-
ment, you can gleefully forget that this tab ever existed in the Classic System
Preferences settings.)
Returning to Your Mac OS 9 Roots
If you need to take the plunge and travel back in time, you might be able
to restart your Mac in Mac OS 9 for as long as you like — simply change
the system Startup Disk! Remember, this ability to restart using Mac OS 9
depends on what model of Macintosh you own. Current Mac models 
(as well as most produced within the last year or two) can run Mac OS 9
only in Classic mode.
Follow these steps in Mac OS X to return to the days of yore:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Startup Disk icon.
3. Click the Mac OS 9 System Folder to select it.
Note that if you have multiple installations of Mac OS 9 on your system
on different hard drives — as I do — you’ll have to choose the proper
System Folder on the proper drive. For those with only one Mac OS 9
System Folder, all is well.
4. Click the Restart button and then click the Save and Restart buttons
on the confirmation sheet that appears.

Returning to Your Mac OS 9 Roots
146
After you finish your fun in Mac OS 9.2 and you want to return to Mac OS X,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú ➪Control Panels.
2. Choose the Startup Disk submenu item.
3. Click the Mac OS X System Folder to select it.
If you have multiple Mac OS X installations or multiple drives, you can
click the triangle next to a drive to expand the display.
4. Click the Restart button.
Voilà! You’ve returned to Wonderland. Say hello to the White Rabbit
for me.
Mac OS X also provides two neat “Choose your operating system weapon”
startup keys you can use when booting or restarting your system. If you
hold down the X key while booting or restarting, your Mac boots into
Mac OS X. In fact, the Startup Disk choice in System Preferences is actu-
ally changed to the Mac OS X System folder on the current boot drive, so
this eliminates the need to follow the steps that I just outlined! (Pretty
catchy, huh? Holding down X to start the Big X, I mean.) Alternatively, 
if you hold down the Option key while booting or restarting, your Mac
displays a menu of all the available operating systems on your system,
and you can pick one. Note, however, that the Option key does not
change your Startup Disk setting, so the next time that you reboot or
restart, you revert to the startup operating system that you selected in
System Preferences.

W
hether the voice echoes from a living room, home office, or college
computer lab, it’s all too familiar: a call for help. No matter how well
written the application or how well designed the operating system, sooner
or later you’re going to need support. That goes for everyone from the novice
to the experienced Mac owner to the occasional e-mail user to the most tal-
ented software developer.
In this short but oh-so-important chapter, I lead you through the various help
resources available within Mac OS X as well as native Mac OS X applications.
I show you how to tap additional resources from Apple, and I also point you
to other suppliers of high-quality (and even questionable) assistance from
sources on the Internet and in your local area.
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
Your first line of defense is the Mac OS X Help Viewer, as shown in Figure 9-1.
To display the Help Viewer from the Finder menu, click Help and choose Mac
Help; or, you can press the Ô+? keyboard shortcut (or, if you think about it,
Ô+Shift+/, or the forward slash key keyboard shortcut). This Help menu is
context-sensitive, so it contains different menu items when you’re working
inside an application.

Displaying the Help Viewer Window
148
As shown in Figure 9-1, the Help Viewer is divided into three sets of 
controls:
✦Toolbar: The toolbar includes navigational controls (Back, Forward and
Help Center buttons) and the Ask a Question (or Search) text box.
✦Quick Clicks: Clicking these links takes you directly to some of the most
frequently asked Help topics for the Finder (or the application you’re
using), such as Connecting to the Internet and Switching from Windows.
To use a Quick Click, just click once on the question that you want to
pursue.
✦Apple Web site link: Click this link to display the latest Mac OS X news
and the latest Help topics from the Apple Web site.
I know that the Help Viewer looks a little sparse at first glance. However,
when you realize how much information has to be covered to help someone
with an operating system — check out the size of the book you’re holding,
for instance — you get an idea of why Mac OS X doesn’t try to cover every-
thing on one screen. Instead, you get the one tool that does it all: the Ask a
Question text box.

Searching for Specific Stuff
149
Searching for Specific Stuff
To search for the help topic you need, click in the Ask a Question text
box, type one or two words that sum up your question, and press Return.
(Although you can ask a full sentence question, I’ve found that the shorter
and more concise your search criteria is, the better the relevance of your
return.) Figure 9-2 illustrates a typical set of topics concerning DVD movies.
Note that the topics are sorted by approximate relevance first. Articles taken
from the AppleCare Support section of the Apple Web site appear in the
Support Articles portion of the window. Note: You won’t see these articles
unless your Mac has an active Internet connection.
To sort the topics alphabetically or by their location within the Help system,
click the Topic or Location column headings, respectively. You can click
a column heading again to toggle the sort order between ascending and
descending.
You can double-click any topic to display the topic text, which will look like
the text that you see in Figure 9-3.

Prodding Apple for the Latest Gossip
As I mention in the earlier section “Displaying the Help Viewer Window,”
I heartily recommend that you visit the Apple Web site at www.apple.com
and surf wildly to and fro. You’ll often pick up on news and reviews that you
won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.
From the opening Web screen, you should click these three links during every
visit to the Apple site: the Hot News link on the Apple tab, the Support tab,
and the Mac OS X tab. These pages give you
✦Articles about the latest news from Cupertino
✦Downloads of the latest Mac OS X freeware, shareware, and demo-ware

✦The Knowledge Base (an online searchable troubleshooting reference)
✦News about upcoming versions of Mac OS X and Apple applications galore
You’ll also find Mac OS X product manuals in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and
online discussion forums that cover Mac OS X.
Calling for Help Deep in the Heart of X
A number of different help avenues are available within Mac OS X applica-
tions as well. They include
✦The Help button: A number of otherwise upstanding Mac OS X windows,
dialogs, and System Preference panes include a Help button, as shown in
the lower right of Figure 9-4. Click the button marked with ? to display
the text for the settings in that dialog or window.
✦Pop-up help for fields and controls: Most Mac OS X applications display
a short line of help text when you hover the mouse pointer on top of a
field or control. Sometimes it’s just the name of the item; sometimes it’s
a full descriptive line. Them’s the breaks.
✦Application-specific help: Applications typically have their own Help
system, which can use the Help Viewer, a separate Help display pro-
gram, or a HyperText Markup Language (HTML; read that Web-based)
Help system. Figure 9-5 illustrates the standalone online Help system for
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Other Resources to Chew On
Although the Help Viewer can take care of just about any question that you
might have about the basic controls and features of Mac OS X, you might
also want to turn to other forms of help when the going gets a little rougher.
In this last section, I cover resources that you can call on when the Help
Viewer just isn’t enough.
Voice support
As of this writing, Apple provides voice technical support for Mac OS X. You
can find the number to call in your Mac’s printed manuals or online in the
Support section of the Apple Web site. However, exactly when you qualify for
voice support and exactly how long it lasts depends on a number of different
factors, like whether you received Mac OS X when you bought a new machine,
or whether you purchased a support plan from Apple.
You can also try the general online support site at www.info.apple.com —
it’s a great starting point for obtaining Mac OS X help.

Mac publications and resource sites
You can refer to a number of great Mac-savvy publications and resources,
both printed and online, for help. My favorites include
✦Macworld (www.macworld.com) and MacAddict (www.macaddict.com)
magazines, both in archaic hard copy and oh-so-slick online versions
✦MacGamer (www.macgamer.com), the online gaming resource for the
Macintosh
✦VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), an online resource for the
latest updates on all sorts of Macintosh third-party applications
✦MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), a well-respected troubleshooting site
devoted to the Mac that offers downloads, news, and discussion areas
In most of my books, I mention specific Internet newsgroups that cater to the
topic I’m discussing — however, virtually all the Mac-specific newsgroups
around are devoted to illegally swapping pirated games and applications, so
I won’t be covering them. Also, the help that you receive from individuals in
newsgroups is sometimes misguided — and sometimes downright wrong, so
take any claims with a grain of salt.
As a general rule, never identify yourself or provide your snail-mail or e-mail
addresses in a newsgroup post! These messages are public, and they remain
hanging around in cyberspace on newsgroup servers for years — you’ll be a
prime target for spam (or even worse).
Local Mac outlets and user groups
Finally, you can find local resources in any medium- to large-sized town or
city: A shop that’s authorized by Apple to sell and repair Macintosh comput-
ers can usually be counted upon to answer a quick question over the phone
or provide more substantial support for a fee. (For example, my local Mac
outlet sponsors inexpensive classes for new Mac owners.)
You might also be lucky enough to have a local Macintosh user group that you
can join — members can be counted on for free answers to your support
questions at meetings and demonstrations. To find a group near you, visit
the Apple User Group Support site at www.apple.com/usergroups and use
the locator.

ac OS X Tiger is rugged, stable, and reliable — and as you can read
earlier in this mini-book (in Chapter 7), practicing regular maintenance
can help eliminate problems caused by everything from power failures to
faulty software drivers to cats upon the keyboard. However, sooner or later
you will encounter what I like to call The Dark Moments . . . a blank screen, a
locked Mac, or an external device that sits there uselessly like an expensive
paperweight.
How you handle The Dark Moments defines you as a true Mac OS X power
user because most folks seem to fall into one of two categories: Either you
panic and beat your head against the wall (which really has little effect on the
computer, when you think about it), or you set your brow in grim determina-
tion and follow the troubleshooting models that I provide in this chapter to
locate (and hopefully fix) the source of the problem.
Don’t Panic!
My friend, this is the first — and most important — rule of troubleshooting,
and yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
Whatever the problem, you can fix it.™
Most computer owners seem to forget the idea that a hardware or software
error can be fixed because they panic — they simply see The Problem, and
somehow they feel that they’ll never be able to use their computer again.

The Troubleshooting Process
156
Although the situation might look grim, don’t ignore these facts:
✦You don’t need to scrap your Mac. As long as you haven’t taken a
hammer or a chainsaw to your Mac, the problem is only temporary.
Sure, individual components do fail over time — heck, so do people —
but the problem is certainly something that can be tracked down and
fixed without scrapping your entire computer.
✦Don’t beat yourself up. As long as you haven’t installed a virus on 
purpose or deleted half your system files to spite yourself, the problem
isn’t your fault. Sure, it’s possible that you might have done something
by accident, but don’t blame yourself — it happens to everybody.
✦Trust your Apple dealer. As long as an Apple dealer is in your area, you
can always get your computer repaired professionally if a component has
gone south. (In some cases, professional help is a necessity: For example,
I’d be a fool to try to fix a power supply or a monitor on my own because
both can pack a heavy electrical punch.)
✦Rely on your backup. As long as you’ve made a backup — you did back
up your hard drive, didn’t you? — you won’t lose much (if any) work.
(I harp about backups further in Chapter 7 of this mini-book.)
Commit these facts to head and heart, and you can rest easy while you track
down and attack the real enemy — whatever’s causing the problem.
The Troubleshooting Process
When I first conceived this chapter, I had originally decided to divide this
section into separate hardware and software troubleshooting procedures.
However, that turned out to be impractical because often you won’t know
whether a problem is caused by hardware or software until you’re practi-
cally on top of it.
Therefore, here’s the complete 12-step troubleshooting process that I designed
while working as a consultant and Macintosh hardware technician for more
than a decade. Feel free to add your own embellishments in the margin or
include reminders with Post-it Notes.
If you’re not sure quite what’s producing the error, this process is designed
to be linear — meaning that it’s meant to be followed in order — but if you
already know that you’re having a problem with one specific peripheral or
one specific application, feel free to jump to the steps that concern only
hardware or software.

Book I
Chapter 10

The Troubleshooting Process
157
Step 1: Always try a simple shutdown
You’d be amazed at how often a reboot (the process of shutting down and
restarting) can cure a temporary problem. For example, this can fix the occa-
sional lockup in Mac OS X or a keyboard that’s not responding because of a
power failure. If possible, make sure that you first close any open documents,
or you might lose unsaved work. When troubleshooting, always do a shutdown
instead of simply restarting the computer because when Mac OS X shuts
down, all the hardware components that make up your system are reset.
If your Mac is locked tight and you can’t use the Shut Down command from
the Apple menu (Ú), you have two choices. First, press and hold the Power
button on your Mac for a few seconds (which turns your computer off). If this
doesn’t work — and, from time to time, it actually doesn’t — you’ll have to
physically pull the power cord from the wall (or turn off the surge suppressor,
if you’re using one).
Step 2: Check all cable connections
Check all connections: the AC power cord and the keyboard cord, as well as
any modem or network connections and all cable connections to external
peripherals. Look for loose connectors — and if you’ve got a cat or dog,
don’t forget to check for chew marks. (Yep, that’s the voice of experience
talking there.) If you’ve recently replaced a cable — especially a network,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire cable — replace it with a spare to
see whether the problem still occurs.
Step 3: Retrace your steps
If the problem continues to occur, the next step is to consider what you’ve
done in the immediate past that could have affected your Mac. Did you install
any new software or have you connected a new peripheral? If your Mac was
working fine until you made the change to your system, the problem likely
lies in the new hardware or software.
✦If you added an external device: Turn off your Mac and disconnect the
peripheral. Then turn on the computer to see whether all proceeds nor-
mally. If so, then check the peripheral’s documentation and make sure
that you correctly installed the driver — the software provided by the
device manufacturer — and that you connected it properly to the right
port. (You can also use System Profiler, which I discuss later in this chap-
ter, to check to see whether your Mac recognizes the external device.)
To verify that the cable works, substitute another cable of the same type
or try the peripheral on another Mac.

The Troubleshooting Process
158
Make it a practice to check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest
driver when you get new hardware. The software that ships in the box
with your new toy could have been on the shelf for months before being
sold, and the manufacturer has probably fine-tuned the driver in the
interim.
✦If you installed new software or applied an update/patch: Follow the
guidelines in Chapter 7 of this mini-book to uninstall the application and
search for any files that it might have installed elsewhere. (Searching by
date created and date modified can help you locate files that you recently
installed.) If this fixes the problem, it’s time to contact the developer
and request technical support for the recalcitrant program; you can
always re-install the program after the problem has been solved by the
developer.
Not all versions of Mac OS X are created equal. If you’ve recently upgraded
to a major or minor new release of Mac OS X, some of the applications
that you’ve been using without trouble for months can suddenly go on
the warpath and refuse to work (or exhibit quirky behavior). If this hap-
pens, visit the developer’s Web site often to look for a patch file that will
update the application to work with the new version of Mac OS X.
✦If you recently made a change within System Preferences: It’s possible
that you’ve inadvertently “bumped” something. For instance, you might
have accidentally changed your modem or network settings or perhaps
made a change to your login options. Verify the settings screens that you
visited to make sure that everything looks okay. Other locations to check
include the Printer Setup Utility (which I discuss in Book VI, Chapter 4)
and your Web browser’s Preference dialog. (I cover Safari in Book IV,
Chapter 5.)
Step 4: Run Disk Utility
Next, run Disk Utility (as shown in Figure 10-1) to check for disk errors and
permissions errors — especially permissions errors, which can wreak
absolute havoc on just about any application on your hard drive. (Click the
Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder.
Chapter 7 of this mini-book provides all the details.)
Step 5: Run antivirus software
Run your antivirus software and scan your entire system for viruses, includ-
ing all system disks and removable disks. Although Mac OS X doesn’t come
with antivirus protection built in, the world-class program Norton AntiVirus
(www.symantec.com) constantly scans each file that you open or download
for infections.

Book I
Chapter 10
Troubleshooting 
the X
The Troubleshooting Process
159
If you haven’t already set your antivirus application to automatically update
itself, download the latest virus update — usually called a signature file or
data file — to keep your virus protection current.
Step 6: Check the Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to make sure that you haven’t inadvertently
tossed something important that could be causing trouble for an application.
Click the Trash icon on the Dock to open the Trash window and peruse its
contents. (Hint: Switch to list mode to see the file types.) To restore items to
their rightful place, drag them from the Trash back to the correct folder on
your hard drive.
Step 7: Check online connections
If you’re connected to an Ethernet network, a cable modem, or a digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), check your equipment to make sure that you’re currently
online and receiving packets normally. Your network system administrator
will be happy to help you with this, especially if you’re blood relatives.

The Troubleshooting Process
160
Step 8: Disable troublesome Login Items
Disable any Login Items (called Startup Items in versions of Mac OS X before
Tiger) that might be causing trouble. As you can read in Book II, Chapter 3,
Login Items are automatically launched as soon as you log in. For example,
an older application that doesn’t fully support Mac OS X can cause problems
if used as a Login Item. You can do this from the Login Items settings in the
System Preferences Accounts panel (as shown in Figure 10-2); click the
Apple menu, choose System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the
Login Items button.
Unfortunately, if a Login Item doesn’t display an error message, your old
friend Trial-and-Error is just about the only sure-fire way to detect which
item (if any) is causing the problem. Click an item to select it, click the
Remove button (marked with a minus sign), and then press Ô+Q to quit
System Preferences. Shut down and reboot your Mac to see whether the
problem has been solved. (If not, don’t forget to add the item again to the
Login Items list.)

ing Login
Item can

The Troubleshooting Process
161
You can also disable Login Items entirely when you reboot. If the login window
appears when you reboot your computer, hold down the Shift key and then
click the Login button. If you don’t see the login window when you reboot,
hold down the Shift key when you see the progress bar in the startup window
and continue to hold down the key until the Finder appears.
Step 9: Turn off your screen saver
Another candidate for intermittent lockups is your screen saver, especially
if you’re running a shareware effort written by a 12-year-old with a limited
attention span. Display your System Preferences, choose Desktop & Screen
Saver, and click the Screen Saver button. You can deactivate the saver
entirely (by moving the Start Screen Saver slider to Never) or choose
the Computer Name saver (which is provided by Apple) from the Screen
Savers list.
Step 10: Check for write-protection
If you’re running a multi-user ship, check to make sure that another user with
administrator access hasn’t accidentally write-protected your documents,
your application, or its support files. If possible, log in with an administrator
account yourself (as I describe in Book II, Chapter 5) and then try running
the application or opening the document that you were unable to access
under your own ID.
Trying an application under someone else’s account is also a great way to
determine whether your user-specific Preference file for that application
has been corrupted. If you can run the application using another person’s
account, contact the software developer to see how you can repair or delete
a Preference file that’s causing problems.
Step 11: Check your System Profiler
If you’ve reached this point in the troubleshooting process and haven’t found
the culprit, you’ve probably experienced a hardware failure in your Macintosh.
If possible, display the Hardware category within the Apple System Profiler
(see Figure 10-3) and make sure that it’s able to recognize and use all the
internal drives, ports, and external devices on your Mac. To start the System
Profiler, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then click the
More Info button.

Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
162
Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation Disc
In case your Mac is in sad shape and won’t even boot from its hard drive,
here’s a last step that you can take before you seek professional assistance:
Reboot your Mac from the Mac OS X Installation disc. Hold down the C key
immediately after you hear the startup chord (which boots your system from
the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive) and then run Disk Utility from the Installation
Apple menu that appears. Because you’ve booted the system from the instal-
lation disc, you can verify and repair problems with your startup hard drive.
(Some new Mac models also come with a diagnostic CD-ROM that can help
you pin down hardware problems.) After you’re done, restart your system.
Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
To be honest, this is a difficult question to answer. Technically, you should
never need to reinstall the Big X, but there’s also no reason why you can’t.
I can only think of two scenarios where reinstalling the operating system
will likely solve a problem. One, if your system files have been so heavily
corrupted — by a faulty hard drive or a rampaging virus, for example — that
you can’t boot Mac OS X at all. Two, if the operating system encounters the
death-dealing kernel panic on a regular basis. A kernel panic displays a dialog

Profiler to
check the

Book I
Chapter 10

163
that instructs you to restart your Mac (in multiple languages, no less), usu-
ally overwriting whatever’s on the monitor at the time. (This is analogous to
the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death — I’ve grown to hate that color
of blue with a passion.)
If you receive kernel panics on an ongoing basis, something is really, really
wrong. Make sure that your documents are copied to a rewriteable CD or
network drive and don’t overwrite any existing backup that you have with a
new backup because the back-up application is likely to lock up as well.
To reinstall, you must reboot from your Mac OS X Installation disc. Hold down
the C key immediately after you hear your Mac’s startup chord. (Read the
earlier section “Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation Disc.”)
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can pursue other avenues to get help
when you can’t solve a troubleshooting problem on your own. Mind you, I’m
talking about professional help from sources that you can trust. Although you
can find quite a bit of free advice on the Internet (usually on privately run
Web sites and in the Internet newsgroups), most of it isn’t worth your effort.
In fact, some of it is downright wrong. That said, here are some sources that
I do recommend.
The Mac OS X Help Viewer
Although most Mac OS X owners tend to blow off the Help Viewer when the
troubleshooting gets tough, that’s never the best course of action. Always
take a few moments to search the contents of the Help Viewer — click Help
from the Finder menu — to see whether any mention is made of the problem
that you’ve encountered.
The Apple Mac OS X Support site
Home to all manner of support questions and answers, the Mac OS X
Support section of the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/support) should be
your next stop in case of trouble that you can’t fix yourself. Topics include
✦Startup issues
✦Classic mode problems
✦Internet and networking problems
✦Printing problems

It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources

You can search the Apple Knowledge Base, download the latest updates and
electronic manuals, and participate in Apple-moderated discussion boards
from this one central location.
Your local Apple dealer
Naturally, an Apple dealer can provide just about any support that you’re
likely to need — for a price — but you can usually get the answers to impor-
tant questions without any coinage changing hands. Your dealer is also
well versed in the latest updates and patches that can fix those software
incompatibility problems. Check your telephone book for your local dealer.

T
he Finder is the heart of Mac OS X — and we all know how heart sur-
geons like to tinker, don’t we? (Ouch. Start again.)
The Finder is the heart of Mac OS X, and as you might expect, it’s highly
configurable. You can customize the Finder to present icons, or you can
peruse folders with a column view that can pack much more information
onscreen at one time. Some folks prefer the default Finder toolbar, and
others like to customize it with the applications and features that they use
most often.
Decisions like these can help you transform Mac OS X into Your Personal
Operating System — and every Mac OS X power user worth the title will take
the time to apply these changes because an operating system that presents
visual information the way that you want to see it is easier and more efficient
to use.
No need for a hammer or saw — when you’re building the Finder of your
dreams, the only tool that you need is your mouse!
Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
The default appearance of a window in Mac OS X uses the familiar large-
format icons that have been a hallmark of the Macintosh operating system
since Day One — but there’s no reason why you have to use them. (In fact,
most Mac OS X power users whom I know consider the icon view mode rather
inefficient and slow.) Besides the icon view shown in Figure 1-1, Mac OS X
offers two other window view modes: list and column.

Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
168
✦List view: List view displays the folders on the volume in a hierarchical
fashion. To display the contents of a folder, you can either click the right-
facing small triangle next to the folder name — it rotates downward to
indicate that you’ve expanded the folder — or you can double-click the
folder icon to display the contents in a Finder window. To collapse the
contents of the folder, click the small triangle again; it rotates back to
face the right. Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Finder window in list view.
You can resize a column by dragging the right edge of the column 
heading.
✦Column view: Figure 1-3 shows the same window in column view, in
which the volumes on your Mac OS X system are displayed on the left.
Each column on the right represents a lower level of subfolders. Click
the volume, click the desired folder in the first second column to display
its contents, and so forth. (Personally, this is my favorite view — thanks,
Apple! It’s efficient and fast as all get-out.) As you drill deeper, the columns
automatically shift to the left. When you click an item (instead of a folder),
the Finder displays a preview and a quick summary of the selected item
in the rightmost column.
Figure 1-1:

Book II
Chapter 1
Building the Finder

Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
169
Each column has its own individual scroll bar (for those really, really
big folders), and you can drag the column handle at the bottom of the
separators to resize the column width to the left. When you hold down
Option and drag a column handle, all the columns are adjusted at once.
Another of my pet peeves is cluttered disks. If you’re continually having
problems locating files and folders, ask yourself, “Self, do I need to organize?
Am I — gasp — cluttered?” If your answer is yes, take an hour and organize
your files logically into new folders. (Remember, I’m talking your documents
and such — not your applications, which are usually where they need to
be — in your Applications folder.) Often, documents that you create end up
as stragglers, usually located in the root folder of your hard drive, which
sooner or later ends up looking like a biker bar after Ladies Night. (The same
can be said of many Mac OS X Desktops, too.) By keeping your root folder
and Desktop clean and saving your files in organized folders, you’ll end up
wasting less time searching for files and more time actually using them.
To switch between the three modes, click one of the three view mode but-
tons on the Finder window toolbar (the current view is highlighted) or click
the View menu and choose As Icons, As List, or As Columns. Mac OS X places
a helpful check mark next to the current view mode. (Keyboard lovers can
hold down Ô and press the 1, 2, or 3 keys to switch views.)

You can work your customization magic on the Finder toolbar as well! In this
section, I show you how to customize that strip of icons across the top of the
Finder window that’s affectionately called the toolbar. Or, if you like, you’ll
discover how to dismiss it entirely to gain additional real estate for the con-
tents of your Finder window.
Hiding and showing the toolbar
You can toggle the display of the toolbar in an active Finder window in one
of three ways:
✦By clicking the toolbar button located at the upper-right corner of the
Finder window
✦By pressing Ô+Option+T
✦By choosing View from the Finder menu and then choosing Hide
(or Show) Toolbar

Hiding and showing the status bar
The status bar at the bottom of the Finder window displays a number of
helpful informational-type tidbits about the window’s contents. Depending
on what you’ve opened, the status bar can include
✦Statistics: See the number of items in the window and the amount of free
space remaining on the volume.
✦A write-protect icon: This icon looks like a pencil with a line running
through it, as shown in Figure 1-4. This indicates that you don’t have
write permissions for the contents of the window — or the volume
where the contents reside. (Note that this does not necessarily mean
that folders at a lower level are write-protected as well.) You’ll typically
see this icon when you’re viewing the contents of a CD or DVD, where
everything is write-protected.

✦The current automatic icon view setting: For windows in icon view, the
status bar can display either a grid icon (indicating that the icons are set
to snap-to-grid) or four tiny icons (indicating that the icons are displayed
in a sorted order). You’ll discover more about these settings later in the
section “Configuring the View Options.”
To toggle the display of the status bar, choose View from the Finder menu
and then choose Show/Hide Status Bar.
Giving your toolbar big tires and a loud exhaust
The default icons on the toolbar include
✦Back and Forward: Like a Web browser, clicking the Back button moves
you to the previous window’s contents. If you use the Back button, the
Forward button appears. Click this to return to the contents that you
had before clicking the Back button.
✦View: Click this control to toggle between the three view modes
(icon, list, or column).
✦Action: Click this drop-down list box to display context-sensitive com-
mands for the selected items. In plain English, you’ll see the commands
that you would see if you hold down Control and click the selection.
✦Search: Okay, I know it’s not technically an icon, but the Search box is a
member of the default toolbar family nonetheless. You can search for a
file or folder using this box — more on this later in the section “Searching
for Files from the Toolbar.”
But, as one of my favorite bumper stickers so invitingly asks, “Why be
normal?” Adding or deleting items from the toolbar is a great way to cus-
tomize Mac OS X. Follow these steps:
1. From the active Finder window menu, choose View➪Customize
Toolbar to display the sheet that you see in Figure 1-5.
Along with controls like Back, Forward, and View, you’ll find a number of
system functions, like Eject and Burn.
2. To add items to the toolbar, drag them from the Customize Toolbar
dialog up to the toolbar at the top of the window.
To add an item between existing buttons, drop it between the buttons,
and they obligingly move aside. If you get exuberant about your toolbar
and you add more icons than it can hold, a double-right arrow appears
at the right side of the toolbar — a click of the arrow displays a pop-up
menu with the icons that won’t fit.
In fact, the Customize Toolbar dialog isn’t necessary for some toolbar
modifications: You can also drag files, folders, and disk volumes directly
from the Desktop or other Finder windows and add them to your toolbar
at any time. To remove a file, folder, or disk volume from the toolbar,

Book II
Chapter 1

of Your Dreams

173
hold down Control and click the icon on the toolbar; then click Remove
Item from the pop-up menu — it vanishes like a CEO’s ethics.
You can always drag a file or folder into the Sidebar column at the left of
the Finder window — the Sidebar column is a separate entity entirely
from the toolbar.
3. To remove an item from the toolbar, drag it off to the center of the
window, amongst the other icons.
4. Naturally, you can swap item positions. Just click an item, drag it to its
new spot, and then release the mouse button.
5. To choose the default toolbar configuration or to start over, drag the
default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top.
This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together
three times and repeating, “There’s no place like home.”
6. To toggle between displaying the icons with accompanying text
(the default), the icon only, or a text button only, click the Show 
drop-down list box at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialog.
7. After you arrange your toolbar as you like, click the Done button.

Searching for Files from the Toolbar
174
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
Need to find a file fast? The default toolbar has just what you need — the
Search field, which offers the ability to perform a Spotlight search for a string
of text within your files (including both filenames and contents). To locate a
file with the Search field, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Search box on the toolbar and type the text that you want
to find.
It’s the text box on the right with the magnifying glass. (The folks at Apple
are really, really into Sherlock Holmes . . . so am I!) If you need to clear
the field and start over again, click the circular X button, which appears
only when text is in the Search field.
Hey, who needs to press Return? The Finder immediately displays the
files with names that include the text, as shown in Figure 1-6.
2. To display the location of a file, click it once. To launch it, double-
click the entry.
Files can also be moved or copied from the Search results list with the
standard drag and Option+drag methods.

3. To perform a new search, click the circular X button and type new
text in the Search field.
To return to your original location in the Finder window, click the Back
button on the toolbar.
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
Although the Search box on the toolbar is all that you’ll need to find most
files and folders, sometimes you need a little more flexibility and power to
locate what you need on your system. To do so, add the Find controls, which
you can use to create custom searches with more complex criteria. To locate
a file by using the Find controls, follow these steps:
1. With the Finder active, display the Find controls by pressing Ô+F
(or choose File from the Finder menu and then choose Find).
Mac OS X displays the controls that you see in Figure 1-7.
2. Click the buttons at the top of the list to specify where you want to
search.
You can choose Computer (your entire system, including network 
volumes), a local volume, or your Home folder.
Figure 1-7:

176
3. To search for a specific filename, click the first drop-down list box in
a row and choose Name; then type all or part of the filename in the
Contains box.
Tiger automatically begins searching as soon as you type at least one
character.
After you locate the file or folder that you need, click the entry name to
reveal the location of the matching file or folder. You can also double-
click it to launch (or display) it.
4. If you want to search for a text string within the document itself, click
the first drop-down list box in a row and choose Contents. Then type
the string to match in the box.
The text must appear just as you’ve typed it, so it’s always a good idea
to restrict what you’re searching for to a minimum of words that you’re
fairly sure will cause a match. (Content searching is not case-sensitive,
though.) Content searching works only when you’ve generated an index,
which I explain later in this section.
5. To include additional search criteria lines, click the button with the
plus sign next to the last criterion line.
You can limit your results based on all sorts of rules, including the date
that the file or folder was last modified, when it was created, the file type,
the size, the extension, or whether the file or folder is marked visible or
hidden (such as a system file).
You can also remove a search criterion line by clicking the button with
the minus sign.
6. To save the search criteria that you selected, click Save.
This creates a Smart Folder, which (you’re gonna love this) Tiger auto-
matically updates (in real time) to contain whatever items match the 
criteria you’ve saved! You can specify the location for your Smart Folder,
and you can also choose to add it to your Finder sidebar for the ultimate
in convenience. Sweet.
7. When you’re done canvassing your computer, click the Back button in
the Find dialog to return to the Finder.
Configuring the View Options
As I discuss at the beginning of the chapter, you’ve got a lot of control over
how Mac OS X presents files and folders in the Finder. In this section, I cover

Book II
Chapter 1
Building the Finder

177
how you can make further adjustments to the view from your windows.
(Pardon me for the ghastly cliché posing as a pun.)
Setting icon view options
First, allow me to provide a little detail on housekeeping in the Big X. After a
few hours of work, a Finder window in icon mode can look something like a
teenager’s room: stuff strewn all over the place, as demonstrated with my
Applications folder in Figure 1-8. To restore order to your Desktop, click in
any open area of the active window and then choose View➪Clean Up. This
command leaves the icons in approximately the same position but snaps
them to an invisible grid so that they’re aligned, as shown in Figure 1-9.
After things are in alignment, work with the icon view options. (Naturally, you’ll
want the active Finder window in icon view first, so choose View➪As Icons or
press Ô+1.) From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View Options — or
press that swingin’ Ô+J shortcut — to display the View Options dialog that
you see in Figure 1-10. (Remember that these are the options available for icon
view; I discuss the options for list and column view later in this chapter.)

Note these first two radio buttons, which also appear in the list View

✦This Window Only: Select the This Window Only radio button to apply
the changes that you make only to the Finder window that opens when

you open the selected item — in other words, the item that appears in
the window’s title bar.
For example, any changes made to the settings in Figure 1-10 will affect
only my Applications folder because it was the active Finder window
when I pressed Ô+ J. (You might have noticed that the window name
also appears as the title of the View Options dialog.)
✦All Windows: Select the All Windows radio button to apply the changes
that you make to all Finder windows that you view in your current mode.
Of course, Mac OS X remembers the changes that you make within the View
Options dialog, no matter which view mode you’re configuring. Now, on to
the other changes that you can make from this dialog, which include
✦Resizing your Desktop icons: Click and drag the Icon Size slider to
shrink or expand the icons on your Desktop. The icon size is displayed
in pixels above the slider.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of
the Text Size drop-down box to choose the font size (in points) for icon
labels.
✦Moving icon label text: Select either the Bottom (default) or the Right
radio button to choose between displaying the text under your Desktop
icons or to the right of the icons.
✦Snap to Grid: Enable this check box to automatically align icons to
a grid within the window, just as if you had used the Clean Up menu
command.
✦Show Item Info: With this check box enabled, Mac OS X displays the
number of items within each folder in the window.
✦Show Icon Preview: If you enable this check box, the Finder displays icons
for image files using a miniature of the actual picture. (A cool feature for
those with digital cameras — however, this does take extra processing
time because Mac OS X has to load each image file and shrink it down to
create the icon.)
✦Keep Arranged By: To sort the display of icons in a window, enable this
check box and choose one of the following criteria from its drop-down
list: by name, date modified, date created, size, or item type.
✦Choosing a background: To select a background for the window, select
one of three radio buttons here:
• White: This is the default.
• Color: Click a color choice from the color block that appears if you
make this selection.
• Picture: Select this radio button and then click the Select button to dis-
play a standard Open dialog. Navigate to the location where the desired
image is stored, click it once to select it, and then click Open.

After all your changes are made and you’re ready to return to work, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings.
Setting list view options
If you’re viewing the active window in list view, choose View➪Show View
Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-11.
Like in icon view, select from one of the two top radio buttons to apply the
changes that you make in this dialog to this window only or to all windows
that you view in list mode. The settings include
✦Resizing your Desktop icons: You can choose from two sizes of Desktop
icons.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of the
Text Size drop-down box to choose the font size (in points) for icon labels.
✦Show Columns: Enable the check boxes under this heading to display
additional columns in list view, including the date that the item was modi-
fied, the creation date, the size, the item type, the version (supplied by
most applications), the label color, and any comments that you’ve added
in the Info dialog for that item. (In my personal opinion, the more columns
that you add, the more unwieldy the Finder gets, so I advise disabling the
display of columns that you won’t use.)
✦Use Relative Dates: Enable this check box to display modification dates
and creation dates with relative terms, such as Today or Yesterday. If this
freaks you out, disable this check box to force all dates to act like adults.

✦Calculate All Sizes: Enable this check box to have Mac OS X display the
actual sizes of folders, including all the files and subfolders they contain.
(Handy for figuring out where all your disk space went, no?) Note: Using
this option takes processing time, so I recommend that you avoid using
it unless you really need to see the size.
To save your settings, click the dialog’s Close button.
Setting column view options
To make changes to view options in column view mode, choose View➪Show
View Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-12.
You only have three column view options, and any changes that you make to
this dialog are always reflected in every column view:
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the Text Size drop-down box to choose
the font size (in points) for icon labels.
✦Show Icons: Enable this check box to display icons in the columns. If this
option is disabled, the icons don’t appear, and you’ll gain a little space.
✦Show Preview Column: If this check box is enabled, clicking a file in
column mode will display a thumbnail (reduced image) and preview
information in the right-most column, as shown in Figure 1-13.
If you store a slew of QuickTime movies and digital images on your
drive, the Preview column is great. (You can even play a QuickTime
movie from the Preview column.)
Click the dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

Setting Finder Preferences
Finally, you can change a number of settings to customize the Finder itself.
From the Finder menu, click Finder and choose the Preferences menu item
to display the Finder Preferences dialog that you see in Figure 1-14.
In the General section, the preference settings include
✦Displaying icons on the Desktop: Enable these check boxes to display
your hard disks, removable volumes (including CDs, DVDs, and Zip disks),
and connected network servers.
✦New Finder Windows Open: Click the drop-down list box to specify the
spot where a new Finder window should open. By default, a new window
displays the contents of your Home folder.
✦Always Open Folders in a New Window: When this check box is enabled,
double-clicking a folder will open it in a new Finder window, as did earlier
versions of Mac OS. (If disabled, the contents of the folder appear in the
same Finder window, which makes it easier to focus on just the folder you
need at the moment.)

183
✦Open New Windows in Column View: When you enable this check box,
each new Finder window that you open automatically uses column view.
(If disabled, the new window uses the last view mode you used.)
✦Spring-loaded Folders and Windows: It sounds a little wacky, but using
this feature can definitely speed up file copying! If this check box is
enabled, you can drag an item on top of a folder — without releasing the
mouse button — and after a preset time (controlled by the Delay slider),
a spring-loaded window appears to show you the folder’s contents. At that
point, you can either release the mouse button to drop the file inside the
folder (upon which the window disappears), or you can drag the icon on
top of another subfolder to spring it forth and drill even deeper.
Pssst. Hovering over a folder and pressing the spacebar makes the folder
spring open immediately. Pass it on.
The Labels preference panel is a simple one — just click next to each label
color to type your own text for that label. (I’ve gotta recommend red for
deadlines and green for contracts . . . call me sentimental.)
From the Sidebar preferences panel, you can choose which default items
should appear in the Finder window Sidebar column. Your choices include
locations (like your Home and Applications folders), network servers, remov-
able media, the Desktop itself, and — naturally — your hard drives. To add a
default item to the Sidebar column, select the corresponding check box to
enable it, or disable the check box to banish that item forthwith.
Figure 1-14:

prefer-
ences here.

Setting Finder Preferences
184
The Advanced preference settings include
✦Always Show File Extensions: If this check box is enabled, the Finder
displays the file extensions at the end of filenames, à la Windows.
This comes in handy for some applications, where everything from
a document to a preference file to the application itself all share the
same icon. However, I find extensions distasteful and leave things set
with the default of extensions off.
✦Show Warning Before Emptying the Trash: By default, this check box
is enabled, and Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog before allowing
you to — in the words of Mac OS X patrons around the world — toss
the Bit Bucket. If you’re interested in speed and trust your judgment
(and your mouse finger), you can disable this setting.
After you make the desired changes to the Finder Preferences, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

“T
weak! Tweak!” It’s not the cry of some exotic bird — that’s the call of
the wild Mac Power User. Power users like to tweak their Mac OS X
Desktops just so, with that menu color, this background, and those applica-
tions in the Dock. Non-computer types just can’t understand the importance
of the proper arrangement of your virtual workplace: When things are famil-
iar and customized to your needs, you’re more productive, and things get
done faster. In fact, if you’ve set up multiple users on your computer under
Mac OS X, the Big X automatically keeps track of each user’s Desktop and
restores it when that person logs in. (For example, when you use the Mac,
you get that background photo of Farrah Fawcett from the ’70s while your
daughter gets Avril Lavigne.)
In this chapter, I show you what you can do to produce a Desktop that’s
uniquely your own, including tweaks that you can make to the background
and your Desktop icons. I’ll also show you how to use Desktop Stickies
instead of a forest of paper slips covering your monitor.
With your Mac OS X Desktop clad in the proper harmonious colors — yes,
that can be your favorite photo of Elvis himself — and your new Dock icons
ready for action, you are indeed prepared for whatever lies ahead in your
computing world!

Changing the Background
186
Changing the Background
You might be asking, “Mark, do I really need a custom background?” That
depends completely on your personal tastes, but I’ve yet to meet a computer
owner who didn’t change his or her background when presented with the
opportunity. Favorite backgrounds usually include
✦Humorous cartoons and photos that can bring a smile to your face
(even during the worst workday)
✦Scenic beauty
✦Photos of family and friends (or the latest Hollywood heartthrob)
✦The company logo (not sure it does much for morale, but it does
impress the boss)
If you do decide to spruce up your background, you have three choices:
You can select one of the default Mac OS X background images, choose a
solid color, or specify your own image. All three backgrounds are chosen
from the Desktop & Screen Saver panel, located within System Preferences
(as illustrated in Figure 2-1).
You can also hold down Control, click the Desktop, and choose Change
Desktop Background from the pop-up contextual menu (or right-click, if
you’re using a mouse with multiple buttons).

Picking something Apple
To choose a background from one of the collections provided by Apple, click
one of these groups from the list at the left:
✦Apple Images: These default backgrounds range from simple patterns to
somewhat strange and ethereal flux shapes. (You’ll have to see them to
understand what I mean.)
✦Nature: Scenic beauty: blades of grass, sand dunes, snowy hills . . . that
sort of thing.
✦Abstract: Even weirder twisting shapes in flux, this time with bright con-
trasting colors. Good for a psychiatrist’s office.
✦Solid Colors: For those who desire a soothing solid shade — more on
this in the next section.
✦Pictures Folder: This displays the images saved in the Pictures folder by
the active user.
✦Choose Folder: You can open a folder containing images and display
them instead. (I discuss this in more detail in a page or two.)
If you see something you like, click the thumbnail, and Mac OS X displays
it in the well and automatically refreshes your background so that you can
see what it looks like. (By the way, in the Apple universe, a well is a sunken
square area that displays an image — in this case, the background image
that you’ve selected.)
Notice your iPhoto albums in the list? That’s no accident — Tiger automati-
cally offers your iPhoto Photo Library, so you can choose images from your
iPhoto collection!
How to annoy friends and confuse co-workers
Never let it be said that I can’t dish out revenge
when necessary. I don’t know whether I should
call this a Tip or a Devilish Practical Joke That
Will Drive People Nuts — anyway, it’s fun as all
get-out. Right before you go to lunch, use the
Grab utility in your Applications/Utilities folder
to take a snapshot of your Desktop with a
number of windows open (or an error dialog
with an OK or a Close button) and then save the
image to your Pictures folder. Select the image
as your Desktop background and then watch
others go crazy trying to click those faux win-
dows, buttons, and icons. For an archenemy, try
the same trick on his Mac! Arrange a slightly
embarrassing Desktop on his computer, specify
it as the background, and sit back while the fun
begins. (Perhaps a Web browser open to a
somewhat unusual Web site?)

Changing the Background
188
Mac OS X automatically manipulates how the background appears on your
Desktop. If an image conforms to your screen resolution, fine — otherwise,
click the drop-down list box next to the well and you can choose to
✦Tile the background. This repeats the image to cover the Desktop. (This
is usually done with pattern images to produce a smooth, creamy, seam-
less look.)
✦Fill the screen. This can be used with a solid color to get uniform cov-
erage. The original aspect ratio of the image is preserved, so it’s not
stretched.
✦Stretch the background to fit the Desktop. If your Desktop image is
smaller than the Desktop acreage, this works, but be warned — if you
try to stretch too small of an image over too large a Desktop, the pixi-
lated result can be pretty frightening. (Think of enlarging an old Kodak
Instamatic negative to a 16 x 20 poster. Dots, dots, dots.) The original
aspect ratio of the image is not preserved, so you might end up with
results that look like the funhouse mirrors at a carnival.
✦Center the image on the Desktop. This is my favorite solution for
Desktop images that are smaller than your resolution.
Note that this drop-down list appears only if the Desktop picture that you
select is not one of the standard Apple images. All the pictures in the Apple
Background Images, Nature, Abstract, and Solid Colors categories are auto-
matically scaled to the size of your screen.
To change your Desktop background automatically on a regular basis, enable
the Change Picture check box and then choose the delay period from the
corresponding drop-down list box. To display the images in random order,
also enable the Random Order check box; otherwise, Mac OS X displays
them in the order that they appear in the folder.
I just gotta have lavender
As I mention earlier, for those who want their favorite color without the 
distraction of an image, one can choose from a selection of solid colors.
You can choose from these colors the same way that you’d pick a default
Mac OS X background image (as I describe in the previous section).
Selecting your own photo
Finally, you can drag your own image into the well from a Finder window to
add your own work of art. To view thumbnails of an entire folder, click the
Pictures Folder (to display the contents of your personal Pictures folder) or
click Choose Folder to specify any folder on your system. Click the desired
thumbnail to embellish your Desktop.

Changing the Screen Saver
189
Changing the Screen Saver
Screen savers are another popular item. Because I cover the Screen Saver
preferences in Chapter 3 of this mini-book, I’ll simply illustrate here how to
choose one. Open System Preferences and click the Desktop & Screen Saver
icon; then click the Screen Saver tab to display the settings that you see in
Figure 2-2.
To add a third-party, screen saver module so that everyone can use it on a
multi-user system, copy it into the Screen Savers folder within the top-level
Library folder.
Click one of the entries in the Screen Savers column to display a thumbnail
of the effect. Enabling the Use Random Screen Saver check box, naturally,
runs through ’em all. You can also test the appearance of the saver module
by clicking the Test button; the screen saver runs until you move the mouse
or press a key.
Many screen savers allow you to monkey with their settings. If the Options
button is enabled (not grayed out), click it to see how you can change the
effects.

I can’t understand it, but some people just don’t appreciate menus with purple
highlights! (You can tell a Louisiana State University graduate a mile away.) To
specify your own colors for buttons, menus, and windows, follow these steps:
1. Open System Preferences and click the Appearance icon to display
the settings in Figure 2-3.
2. Click the Appearance drop-down list and choose the main color
choice for your buttons and menus.
3. Click the Highlight Color drop-down list and pick the highlight color
that will appear when you select text in an application or select an
item from a list.
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
Adding Stickies
Stickies are interesting little beasts — I don’t know their genus or phyla, but
they’re certainly handy to have around. To be technical for a moment, a
Stickie is actually nothing more than a special type of application window,

but these windows remain on your Desktop as long as the Stickies applica-
tion is running.
I use Stickies for anything that a Post-it Note can handle, including
✦Reminders that you don’t want to misplace
✦Snippets of text that you want to temporarily store while your Mac
is turned off (without launching a behemoth like Word or digging for
TextEdit)
✦Boilerplate (repeated and standard) text that you’re constantly including
in your documents, like your address
✦A quick note that includes someone’s e-mail address or phone number
✦Today’s Dilbert cartoon from www.dilbert.com
A Stickie can contain data pasted from the Clipboard, or you can simply type
directly into the Stickies application window. Stickie windows can include
graphics and different fonts and colors. You can even locate specific text from
somewhere in your vast collection of Stickies by using the Find command
within the Stickies application — just press Ô+F while the Stickies menu is
active to display the Stickies Find dialog. (And you don’t use up our bark-
covered friends of the forest, either.)
In Book I, I discuss the Mac OS X Services menu — you can make a Stickie
note from the Finder Services menu, as well.
Follow these steps to stick your way to success:
1. Open your Applications folder and run the Stickies application to dis-
play the new window that you see in Figure 2-4.
The text cursor is already idling in the new window. (The other windows
are Stickies, too, but they contain display text from the application. If
you like, you can close them.)
2. Type text in the window or press Ô+V to paste the contents of the
Clipboard into the window.
You can also import the contents of an existing file into a Stickie. Just
choose File and then choose Import Text to display a standard Open
dialog.
3. You can add text formatting, change the text font, and change the
color of the font from the Font menu.
From the Note menu, you can also choose to make the Stickie translucent.
(No pressing reason; they just look cool.)

Adding Stickies
192
4. To change the Stickie’s color, click the Color menu and choose the
appropriate hue.
5. Resize and drag the Stickie window to the desired location.
Press Ô+M to toggle between a miniaturized view (showing only the title
bar) and the expanded view.
To automatically run the Stickies application each time you log on, open the
Accounts settings in System Preferences and click your account in the list.
Click the Startup Items button and add Stickies to the list by clicking the
plus button.
To delete a Stickie, simply click the Close button at the upper-left corner of
the Stickie window. Or, click the Stickie to make it the active note and then
click Close. Stickies display a dialog to confirm that you want to close the
note; click Save to save the contents in a file or click the Don’t Save button to
close the note and discard its contents.
To close the Stickies application completely, click any note and press Ô+Q.
The application remembers the position and contents of each note until you
launch it again.

Customizing the Dock
193
Customizing the Dock
In terms of importance, the Dock — the launch pad for applications and 
documents that appears on your Desktop — ranks right up there with the
command center of a modern nuclear submarine. As such, it had better be
easy to customize, and naturally, Mac OS X doesn’t let you down.
Adding applications and extras to the Dock
Why be satisfied with just the icons that Apple places in the Dock? You can
add your own applications, files, and folders to the Dock as well.
✦Adding applications: You can add any application to your Dock by
simply dragging its icon into the area to the left of the separator line
(which appears between applications and folders or documents). The
existing Dock icons will obligingly move aside to make a space for it
wherever you like.
Attempting to place an application on the right of the separator line
sends it to the Trash (if the Trash icon is highlighted when you release
the button), so beware.
✦Adding files and folders: Folders and volume icons can be added to the
Dock by dragging the icon into the area to the right of the separator line.
(Attempting to place these to the left of the separator line will open an
application with the contents, which usually doesn’t work.) To open the
location in a Finder window, click and hold the mouse button (or press
Control when you click) to display a Dock menu, where you can open
documents, run applications, and have other assorted fun, depending on
the item you chose. Now that, my friends, is genuine sassy!
✦Adding Favorites: You can drag any URL from Safari directly into the
area to the right of the separator line. Clicking that icon automatically
opens your browser and displays that page. (Safari gets the treatment in
Book IV, Chapter 5.)
To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off the Dock. You get
a rather silly (but somehow, strangely satisfying) animated cloud of debris,
and the icon is no more. Note, however, that the original application, folder,
or volume is not deleted — just the Dock icon itself is permanently excused.
If you like, you can delete almost any of the default icons that Mac OS X installs
on the Dock; only the Finder and Trash icons must remain on the Dock.
To set up a Dock icon as a Login Item — without the hassle of opening the
Accounts pane in System Preferences — just click a Dock icon and hold the
mouse button down until the pop-up menu appears. Then select the Open at
Login menu item.

Stick It on the Dashboard
194
If you can’t delete items from the Dock, you’re using a managed account —
that’s a standard user account with certain limitations set. (In this case, your
account is set to Some Limits, and your administrator has disabled the Modify
the Dock check box in your account.) You’ll need an admin-level user to log
in; then visit the Accounts panel in System Preferences and enable the check
box again. For more information on user accounts, see Chapter 5 of this
mini-book.
Resizing the Dock
You can change the size of the Dock from the Dock settings in System
Preferences — I explain this in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3 — but
here’s a simpler way to resize the Dock, right from the Desktop.
Move your mouse cursor over the separator line on the Dock; the cursor
turns into a funky line with arrows pointing up and down. This is your cue
to click and drag while moving the mouse up and down, which expands and
shrinks the Dock, respectively.
You can also hold down the Control key and click when the funky line cursor
is visible. This allows you to change your Dock preferences without the hassle
of opening System Preferences and displaying the Dock settings.
Stick It on the Dashboard
One of Tiger’s funkiest new features is Dashboard, which you can use to hold
widgets and display them with the press of a button. (Okay, I know that sounds
a little wacky, but bear with me.) Widgets are small applications called applets
that typically provide only one function. For example, Dashboard comes
complete with a calculator, a clock, and a quick-and-simple calendar. You
can display and use these widgets at any time by pressing the Dashboard
key; by default, that’s F12, but you can modify the key on the Dahlsboard &
Exposé pane within System Preferences. Tiger also includes a thoughtful
Dashboard icon on the Dock, which you can click to display your widgets.
(Geez, that sounds kind of racy. Best not to pursue it.)
Figure 2-5 illustrates Dashboard in action. Press the Dashboard key, and the
widgets appear, ready for you to use. You can add or delete widgets to your
Dashboard by clicking the Add button (which bears a plus sign, naturally) at
the lower left corner of the Dashboard screen. When you click the Add button,
a scrolling menu strip appears at the bottom of the Dashboard display, and you
can drag new widgets directly onto your Dashboard from this menu. It’s also
easy to rearrange the widgets that are already populating Dashboard by drag-
ging them to the desired spot. (To remove a widget, just click the Add button 
to display the menu strip, and you’ll notice a tiny X button appears next to
each widget on your Dashboard; click the X button next to the widget you 
want to remove, and it vanishes from the display. You can add it back again 
at any time.) Press the Dashboard key again to return to your Tiger Desktop.

Arranging Your Precious Desktop

If you need to use a widget for only a second or two, press the Dashboard
key and hold it. When you release the key, you’re back to your Desktop.
Apple offers additional widgets that you can download on the Mac OS X
download site (www.apple.com/macosx). Third-party software developers
also provide both freeware and shareware widgets.
You can also modify the Dashboard key by turning it into a key sequence
(a good thing if you’re already using an application that thrives on F12). Visit
the Dashboard & Exposé pane in System Preferences, and use the Shift,
Control, Option, and Ô keys in conjunction with the Dashboard key to spec-
ify a modifier.
Arranging Your Precious Desktop
Finally, consider the layout of the Desktop itself. You can set the options for
icon placement from the Finder View menu. Just like the options for Finder
windows that I cover in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, you can clean up and
arrange your Desktop by name, date, size, or kind.

The View Options for the Desktop are slightly different than the View Options
for a Finder window in icon view. (Garner the scoop on setting these prefer-
ences in Chapter 1 of this mini-book.) First, you choose a background for the
Finder from System Preferences. Also, you don’t have to worry about whether
the options are global or not . . . you have but one Desktop, after all.

In This Chapter
 Displaying and customizing settings in System Preferences
 Saving your changes
 Changing settings
L
ike the Mac OS 9 Control Panel before it, the System Preferences
window is the place to practice behavior modification in Mac OS X. The
settings that you specify in System Preferences affect the majority of the
applications that you use as well as the hardware that you connect to your
Mac, your Internet and network traffic, the appearance and activity on your
Desktop, and how Tiger handles money, dates, and languages. Oh, and don’t
forget your screen saver.
In this chapter, I discuss the many settings in System Preferences. You’ll dis-
cover what does what and how you can customize the appearance and
operation of Mac OS X.
The Preferred Way to Display the Preferences
Apple has made it easy to open the System Preferences window. Just click
the System Preferences icon (which looks like a wall light switch, next to the
Apple logo) on the Dock, and the window shown in Figure 3-1 appears. You
can also open the window by clicking the Apple menu and choosing the
System Preferences item.
To display all the System Preferences panels at any time, click the Show All
button. You can also use the Back and Forward buttons (in the toolbar’s
upper-left corner) to move backward and forward through the different
panes you’ve accessed in System Preferences, just like the similar buttons 
in a Web browser (yes, just like Safari!).
Tiger even allows you to display all the System Preferences panes in alpha-
betical order, which can make it easier to choose a pane if you’re unsure
what group it’s in. To do so, choose View➪Organize Alphabetically. (Note
that you can also select any pane directly from the View menu.)

Saving Your Preferences
198
Saving Your Preferences
You’ll note that there’s no Save or Apply button on the System Preferences
window. Illustrating the elegant design of Mac OS X, simply quitting System
Preferences automatically saves all the changes that you make. (However,
some panes in System Preferences have an Apply Now button that you can
click to apply your changes immediately.) Like any other Mac OS X applica-
tion, you can quit the System Preferences window by pressing Ô+Q or by
choosing System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Searching for Specific Settings
Searching for a single button or check box amidst all the settings in System
Preferences might seem like hunting for the proverbial needle in a haystack,
but your friends at Apple have added a Search box to the right side of the
window toolbar. Click in this Search box and type the setting name, like
screen saver (or even a word that’s generally associated with a setting, like
power for the Energy Saver settings). Tiger highlights all the icons in System
Preferences that have anything to do with the search keywords you entered,
as shown in Figure 3-2. You don’t even have to press Return!

Appearance preferences
The Appearance group appears in Figure 3-3.
These settings are
✦Appearance: From this drop-down list, choose a color to be used for
buttons, menus, and windows.
✦Highlight Color: From this drop-down list, choose a color to be used to
highlight selected text in fields and drop-down list boxes.
✦Place Scroll Arrows: Select either radio button here to put the scroll bar
arrow buttons together (at the bottom of the scroll bar, in the lower-
right corner of the window) or at the top and bottom of the scroll bar.
✦Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Mac OS X jumps to the next or
previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. Mark
the Jump to Here radio button to scroll the document to the approxi-
mate position in relation to where you clicked. (You can also choose
smooth scrolling, which looks cool, but many folks think that it’s too
slow compared with the default scrolling speed.) If you enable the
Minimize When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box, you can
minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-clicking the
window’s title bar.

✦Number of Recent Items: The default number of recent applications,
documents, and servers (available from the Recent Items item in the
Apple menu, which you can read more about in Book I, Chapter 3) is 10.
To change the default, click any of the drop-down list boxes here and
choose up to 50. (Personally, I like 20 or 30 for each.)
✦Font Smoothing Style: Click this drop-down list for choices to make the
text on your monitor or flat-panel appear more like the printed page.
The best choices are Standard (for a typical CRT monitor) and Medium
(for a typical flat-panel LCD display).
✦Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text
smoothing isn’t much good for most onscreen fonts. By default, any font
displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is suitable for a
high-end video card and monitor. If you have an older monitor or a low-
end video card, you can speed up the display of text by turning off text
smoothing for fonts up to 12 point.
Dashboard and Exposé preferences
Figure 3-4 illustrates the Exposé settings — and the Dashboard settings,
which are new in Tiger — that you can configure in this group. You can use
Exposé to view all the application windows that you’re using at one time, 
so you can select a new active window. Or, you can move all windows aside
so that you can see your Desktop. Dashboard presents a number of mini-
applications called widgets, which you can summon and hide with a single
key.
Figure 3-4:

The settings here are
✦Active Screen Corners: These four drop-down list boxes operate just
like those in the Screen Savers panel, but they control the operation of
Tiger’s Dashboard and Exposé features. Click one to specify that corner
as an All Windows corner (which displays all windows on your Desktop),
an Application Windows corner (which displays only the windows from
the active application), a Desktop corner (which moves all windows to
the outside of the screen to uncover your Desktop), or a Dashboard
corner (which displays your Dashboard widgets). Note that you can also
set the Screen Saver Start and Disable corners from here.
✦Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each drop-down list box to set
the key sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Exposé
functions as well as the Dashboard.
Desktop and screen saver preferences
Figure 3-5 illustrates the settings in the Desktop & Screen Saver group.
The settings on the Desktop tab are
✦Current Desktop picture: You can drag a picture from the thumbnail
field at the bottom half of the screen and drop it into the well (the
square box in Figure 3-5) to use it as your Desktop background. To dis-
play a different image collection or open a folder of your own images,
click the Choose Folder entry in the left column and browse for your
heart’s desire.
✦Layout: As I explain in Chapter 2 of this mini-book, you can tile your
background image, center it, and stretch it to fill the screen. The layout
control appears only when you’re using your own pictures, so you won’t
see it if you’re using a desktop image supplied by Apple.
✦Change Picture: Enable this check box to change the Desktop back-
ground automatically after the delay period that you set, including each
time that you log in and each time that your Mac wakes up from sleep
mode.
✦Random Order: To display screens randomly, enable the Random Order
check box. Otherwise, the backgrounds are displayed in the sequence in
which they appear in the thumbnail strip.
Click the Screen Saver tab to see the following settings:
✦Screen Savers: In the Screen Savers list at the left, click the screen saver
that you want to display an animated Preview of on the right. To try out
the screen saver in full-screen mode, click the Test button. (You can end
the test by moving your mouse.) If the screen saver module that you

select has any configurable settings, click the Options button to display
them. (A screen saver is configurable if the Options button is enabled.)
✦Start Screen Saver: Click and drag the slider here to specify the period
of inactivity that will trigger the screen saver. To disable the screen
saver, choose the Never setting at the far right of the slider.
✦Use Random Screen Saver: Just what it says — if this check box is
enabled, a different screen saver module is used each time that the
screen saver is activated.
✦Hot Corners: You can click any of the four drop-down list boxes at the
four corners of the screen to specify that corner as an activation hot
corner (which immediately activates the screen saver) or as a disabling hot
corner (which prevents the screen saver from activating). As long as the
mouse pointer stays in the disabling hot corner, the screen saver will not
kick in no matter how long a period of inactivity passes. Note that you 
can also set the Exposé activation corners from here. (For the scoop on
Exposé, see the preceding section, “Dashboard and Exposé preferences.”)
Dock preferences
The Dock group is shown in Figure 3-6.
Settings here are
✦Dock Size: Move this slider to change the overall size of the Dock.

✦Magnification: With this check box enabled, a Dock icon will magically
expand like the national deficit when you move your mouse cursor over
it. You can move the Magnification slider to specify just how much mag-
nification is right for you.
This feature is useful for helping you click a particular Dock icon if
you’ve resized the Dock smaller than its default dimensions or if you
have a large number of items on the Dock.
✦Position on Screen: Choose from three radio buttons to make that crazy
Dock appear at the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
✦Minimize Using: By default, Mac OS X animates a window when it’s
shrunk into the Dock (and when it’s expanded back into a full window).
From the Minimize Using drop-down list, you can choose from a genie-in-
a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect. To demon-
strate, choose an effect and then click the Minimize button (the yellow
button in the upper-left corner) on the System Preferences window.
✦Animate Opening Applications: By default, Mac OS X has that happy,
slam-dancing feeling when you launch an application: The application’s
icon bounces up and down on the Dock two or three times to draw your
attention and indicate that the application is loading. If you find this
effervescence overly buoyant or distracting, disable this check box.
✦Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: If you like, the Dock can stay
hidden until you need it, thus reclaiming a significant amount of Desktop
space for your application windows. Enable this check box to hide the
Dock whenever you’re not using it.
To display a hidden Dock, move your mouse pointer over the edge of the
Desktop where it’s hiding.
You can also change these Dock preference settings from the Apple menu.

International preferences
The International group appears in Figure 3-7.
✦Language tab: Choose the preferred order for language use in menus
and dialogs as well as the standards that Mac OS X will use for each
script style.
✦Formats tab: Find these settings here:
• Date: You can select a region and use its date conventions (month-
day-year versus day-month-year), or you can build a custom format
for both the long date (Saturday, September 24, 2005) and short date
(9/24/2005) used throughout Mac OS X. The changes that you make
are immediately reflected in the sample box at the left.
• Time: Click Customize to select a region to use the preset time con-
ventions. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) time formats,
change the time separator (colons, a period, or a dash), and specify
different suffixes for morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.).
• Numbers: These convention settings determine the separators used
for large numbers or numbers with decimals, as well as the currency
symbol that you want to use and where it appears in a number. You
can also choose between standard (US) and metric measurement
systems.
✦Input Menu tab: Each check box toggles the keyboard layouts available
from the Input menu. You can click the Keyboard Shortcuts button to
toggle the shortcuts for switching layouts and input methods.
Security preferences
The Security group is shown in Figure 3-8.
Settings here are
✦FileVault: These controls allow you to set the master password for
FileVault encryption within the current user’s Home folder, which makes
it virtually impossible for others to access those files. Only an admin-
level user can set the master password. After the master password has
been set, you can click the Turn On FileVault button to enable FileVault
encryption for the user who’s currently logged in; the user’s Login pass-
word becomes his FileVault password as well.
✦Require Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver:
If you enable this check box, Mac OS X requires that you enter your log
in password before the system returns from a sleep state or exits a
screen saver.

can choose to disable the automatic logon feature, force Mac OS X to
require a log in password each time that a System Preference pane is
opened, automatically log off any user after a certain amount of inactiv-
ity, or use secure (encrypted) virtual memory on your hard drive.
Spotlight preferences
The Spotlight group is shown in Figure 3-9.
Settings here are
✦Search Results tab: You can enable or disable the check boxes next to
each of the categories to display or hide each category in the Spotlight
search menu and dialog. Click and drag the categories to the order that
you prefer. For example, I like to see matching documents immediately

you want to exclude from Spotlight searches. Alternatively, just drag the
folders or disks to exclude into the list from a Finder window.
It’s All about the Hardware
The next category, Hardware, allows you to specify settings that affect your
Macintosh hardware.
Bluetooth preferences
If your Mac has Bluetooth hardware available, the Bluetooth group shown in
Figure 3-10 appears. If you don’t have Bluetooth hardware, you’ll be blissfully
unaware of the existence of this group because the Bluetooth icon won’t
appear in your System Preferences window.
The choices on this pane include
✦Settings tab: From this panel, you can opt to allow other Bluetooth
devices to discover your Mac and also whether you want to automati-
cally launch the Bluetooth Setup Assistant when no Bluetooth devices
are recognized. If you’re using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard (as on
an iMac G5), you can wake your Mac using these devices. And, if you
like, Tiger can display a Bluetooth status menu in the Finder menu bar.
✦Devices tab: This panel lists all the recognized Bluetooth devices in
range and also allows you to configure or disconnect them. You can also
set up a new Bluetooth device from here.
✦Sharing tab: The Sharing panel allows you to enable and disable incom-
ing and outgoing file transfers over a Bluetooth connection as well as 
the synchronizing function built into most Bluetooth hardware. If you’re
using a Bluetooth connection as a virtual serial port, you can add or
remove serial services from this panel as well.
CDs and DVDs preferences
The CDs & DVDs group is shown in Figure 3-11.
Choices here are
✦When You Insert a Blank CD: Click this drop-down list box to specify
the action that Mac OS X should take when you load a blank CD-R or 
CD-RW. You can choose to be prompted or to open the Finder, iTunes, 
or Disk Copy. Additionally, you can open another application that you
select, run an AppleScript that you select, or ignore the disc.

what action Mac OS X should take when you load an audio CD. By
default, iTunes is launched.
✦When You Insert a Picture CD: Choices from this drop-down list specify
what action Mac OS X should take when you load a picture CD. By
default, iPhoto is launched.

The two panels here are
✦Display tab: Click the resolution that you want to use from the
Resolutions list on the left and then choose the number of colors (from
the Colors drop-down list) to display. In most cases, you’ll want to use
the highest resolution and the highest number of colors. You can also
choose a refresh rate (from the, ahem, Refresh Rate drop-down list).
Again, generally the higher the refresh rate, the better. Move the
Brightness slider to adjust the brightness level of your display. (Note
that these settings are different depending on what type of display
you’re using. For example, a Mac with a CRT monitor has more settings
to choose from than a flat-panel LCD system.)
Enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box if you’ll be switching
resolutions and color levels often — this means you, Ms. Image Editor
and Mr. Web Designer!
✦Color tab: Click a display color profile that will control the colors on
your monitor. To create a custom ColorSync profile and calibrate the
colors that you see on your monitor, click the Calibrate button to launch
the Display Calibrator. (You can also launch it from your Utilities folder
within your Applications folder.) This easy-to-use assistant walks you
step-by-step through the process of creating a ColorSync profile
matched to your monitor’s gamma and white-point values.

The two tabs here are
✦Sleep tab: Move the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For
slider to specify when Mac OS X should switch to sleep mode. The Never
setting here disables sleep mode entirely. To choose a separate delay
period for blanking your monitor, drag the Put the Display to Sleep
When the Computer Is Inactive For delay slider to the desired period.
You can also power-down the hard drive to conserve energy and prevent
wear and tear (an especially good feature for laptop owners).
If you want to start or shut down your Mac at a scheduled time, click the
Schedule button. Mark the desired schedule (the Start Up/Wake check
box and the Shut Down/Sleep list box) to enable them; then click the up
and down arrows next to the time display to set the trigger time. Click
OK to return to the Energy Saver pane.
✦Options tab: These settings can toggle events that can wake Tiger from
sleep mode, including a ring signal from the modem or a network con-
nection by the network administrator. If you’d like to put your Mac into
sleep mode by pressing the Power button, enable the Allow Power
Button to Sleep the Computer check box. You can also set Mac OS X to
restart automatically after a power failure, which is a good idea if you’ll
be running a Web or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server on your
machine. (Read more about this in Book VII, Chapter 4.)
Laptop owners can set two separate Energy Saver configurations:
• Battery Power configuration: Applies when their Mac is running on
battery power)
Figure 3-13:
The Energy
Saver pane.

It’s All about the Hardware
212
• Power Adapter configuration: Kicks in when the laptop is connected
to an AC outlet
If you’re running a laptop or a desktop with a G5 processor, you’ll see
the Processor Performance list box. From here, you can set your Mac’s
processor to reduce its power consumption and heat buildup. Choose
Automatic if you want Tiger to take care of stepping-down your proces-
sor’s performance whenever possible. Note: This setting isn’t available
for laptops. Choose Highest if you want the best possible performance
at all times; this is my favorite setting for use with iMac G5 and Power
Mac G5 desktop units. If you want to reduce your laptop’s power con-
sumption as far as possible to conserve your battery charge while
you’re working, choose Reduced.
Keyboard and mouse preferences 
The Keyboard & Mouse group is shown in Figure 3-14.
You’ll find either three or four panels in this group, depending on whether
your Mac has Bluetooth installed. The settings include
✦Keyboard tab: Move the Key Repeat Rate slider to alter the rate at
which a keystroke will repeat. You can also adjust the Delay Until Repeat
slider to alter how long a key must be held down before it repeats. To
test your settings, click in the sample box and hold down a single key.

a double-click — feel free to click in the sample box to test your settings.
Drag the Scrolling Speed slider to specify the rate at which the contents
of windows will scroll. Lefties might want to change the primary mouse
button for aftermarket pointing devices.
✦(Optional) Bluetooth tab: If you’re using a Bluetooth mouse or key-
board, you can check the battery level on these devices from this panel.
If you don’t have a Bluetooth card or external adapter, this tab won’t
appear.
✦Keyboard Shortcuts tab: If you’re a power user who appreciates the lure
of the keyboard shortcut, you can edit your shortcuts here.
Looking for even more keyboard customizing possibilities? Select the All
Controls radio button on the Keyboard Shortcuts panel to see additional
keys to use.
Printing and fax preferences
Figure 3-15 illustrates the Print & Fax preferences.
✦Printing tab: Click the Printer Setup button to launch the Printer Setup
Utility, and click the Print Queue button to display the Print Queue
window (no great shockers there). To add a new printer, click the Add
button, which bears a plus sign. You can read more about printer setup
in Book VI, Chapter 4.
The other settings here are
• Selected Printer in Print Dialog: Click this drop-down list box to select
the installed printer that should act as the default printer throughout
your system. If you choose Last Printer Used, Mac OS X uses the
printer that received the last print job.
• Default Paper Size in Page Setup: Will that be US Letter or Tabloid?
Click this drop-down list box to specify the default paper size for
future print jobs.
✦Sharing tab: Click this tab to take advantage of Tiger’s one-click method
of sharing your printers across your network: Enable the Share These
Printers with Other Computers check box, and enable the check box
next to each printer that you want to share. Mac OS X takes care of the
rest. Nice.
✦Faxing tab: Click the Faxing button to set up the fax send/receive func-
tions built into Tiger. To receive faxes on your Mac, you must first enable
the Receive Faxes on This Computer check box. After faxing has been
turned on, you can configure the other settings, which include

It’s All about the Hardware
214
• My Fax Number: Enter the phone number that others will call to
reach your Mac.
• When a Fax Arrives: You can determine how many times the phone
will ring before your Mac answers the incoming call. By default, Mac
OS X saves the incoming fax to your Shared Faxes folder, but you can
change that location — or, if you like, you can select an e-mail
address where the fax will be sent, or you can choose to print the
incoming fax on the printer that you specify. And check this out: If
you like, you can send your fax to all three destinations (a disk
folder, an e-mail address, and a printer)!
• Set Up Fax Modem: Click this button to configure your Mac’s internal
modem or to select an external USB modem for faxing.
If you send and receive a large number of faxes, make sure you enable the
Show Fax Status in Menu Bar check box.
Sound preferences
The Sound group is shown in Figure 3-16. To set the overall system audio
volume, drag the Output Volume slider. To mute all sound from your Mac,
enable the Mute check box. I recommend that you enable the Show Volume

The three tabs here are
✦Sound Effects tab: From this panel, you can choose the system alert
sound and the volume for alerts. You can also choose to mute application
and Finder menu sound effects, as well as toggle the sample sound effect
when the volume keys are pressed on your Mac’s keyboard (or from the
Volume slider).
✦Output tab: Use these settings to choose which audio controller your
Mac should use for playing sound. Unless you’ve installed additional
audio hardware, this should remain set to Built-in Audio. You can adjust
the balance between the left and right channels for the selected output
controller.
✦Input tab: These settings allow you to specify an input source. Unless
your Mac includes a Line In input source, leave this set to your Internal
Microphone. Drag the Input Volume slider to increase or decrease the
input signal volume; the input level display provides you with real-time
sound levels.

.Mac preferences
The .Mac group is illustrated in Figure 3-17.
The four panels are
✦Account tab: In the .Mac Member Name and the Password text boxes,
respectively, type your .Mac member name and password. If you’d like to
subscribe, click the Learn More button to launch your Web browser —
you’ll be whisked to the .Mac sign-up page. For more information about
joining Apple’s .Mac service, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
✦Sync tab: If you want to synchronize your computer (or multiple
Macintosh computers) with the personal information and data stored
online in your .Mac account, select the Synchronize with .Mac check
box, and click the drop-down list box to specify manual or automatic
synchronization. (To manually sync, click Sync Now.) You can also spec-
ify which categories of data you want to sync. Naturally, the fewer cate-
gories you choose, the less time it will take to sync. Tiger can display
your Sync status in the Finder menu bar.
I recommend that you click the iDisk Syncing Start button to enable
Tiger’s iDisk syncing function (which creates a local copy of your iDisk
on your Mac) and also select the Synchronize Automatically option. This
allows iDisk to run much faster because Mac OS X can read and write by
using your local iDisk copy on your hard drive. Your Mac will regularly
synchronize the data on your local hard drive across the Internet with
the iDisk on the Apple server.

✦iDisk tab: This tab displays your current iDisk usage and allows you to
subscribe for additional space with the Buy More button. You can set
your access privileges for your public folder to Read-Only or Read-Write,
and you can add a password that others have to enter before they can
access your public folder. For a complete description of iDisk, see Book
IV, Chapter 4.
✦Advanced tab: From this list, you can see which Macs you’ve registered
for synchronization with your .Mac account. Remember, the actual syn-
chronization settings are found on the Sync panel. To register the com-
puter you’re using, click the Register this Computer button.
Network preferences
The Network group is shown in Figure 3-18.
You can create a new Location by clicking the Location drop-down list at the
top of the dialog — Mac OS X prompts you for a name — or you can edit
your existing Locations by choosing Edit Locations from this list. (Automatic
is the default, and it does a pretty good job of figuring out what settings you
need.) As I mention in Book I, Chapter 3, creating Locations makes it easy to
completely reconfigure your Network preferences when you connect your
computer to other networks: for example, when you take your laptop to a
branch office. You can also set up Locations to accommodate different ISP
dialup telephone numbers in different towns.

If you need to create a new Location that’s very similar to an existing
Location, click the Location drop-down list box and choose Edit Locations.
Then select the Location that you want to copy and click the Duplicate
button. The new Location that you create will contain all the same settings
(without several minutes of retyping), so you can easily edit it and make
minor changes quickly.
You can choose locations from the Apple menu — a useful trick for laptop
road warriors.
When you select Built-in Ethernet from the Show drop-down list box, the
tabs displayed are
✦TCP/IP: These settings are provided either automatically (by using
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP]) or manually (by using set-
tings provided by your network administrator). For more details on
TCP/IP settings, see Book IV, Chapter 1 and Book V, Chapter 2.
✦PPPoE: The settings that you enter here — if necessary — are used for
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet connections. If you’re not using
PPPoE to connect to your ISP, you can forget about the settings in this
dialog. If you are using PPPoE, see Book IV, Chapter 1 for more details.
✦AppleTalk: If you’re connecting your Mac to older Macs or AppleTalk
network printers via an AppleTalk network, enable the Make AppleTalk
Active check box and choose an active Zone to join from the AppleTalk
Zone drop-down list box. Automatic configuration should work in nearly
every AppleTalk environment, but if you want to specify the Node ID and
Network ID for your computer manually, choose Manually from the
Configure drop-down list box.
Note that AppleTalk can be active on only one port within a location. 
For example, if you have AppleTalk active for Ethernet, you can’t select
AppleTalk for the wireless port in the same location. (You can, however,
define different locations for AirPort and Ethernet, both with AppleTalk
active.)
✦Proxies: Network proxy servers are used as part of a firewall configura-
tion to help keep your network secure, but in most cases, changing 
them can cause you to lose Internet functionality if you enter the wrong
settings.
Most folks using a telephone modem, cable modem, or digital subscriber
line (DSL) connection should leave these settings alone. Enable and
change these settings only at the request of your network administrator.
If you’ve enabled your Mac OS X firewall and you use FTP to transfer
files, enable the Passive FTP Mode check box on the Proxies tab. I rec-
ommend that you enable this setting to allow downloading from some
Web pages as well.

Book II
Chapter 3
Delving under the Hood

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
219
✦Ethernet: From this panel, you can configure the settings for your Ethernet
network interface card. I strongly recommend that you leave the Configure
drop-down list box set to Automatically (unless specifically told to set
things manually by your system administrator or that nice person from
Apple tech support).
When you select Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list box, the tabs
displayed are
✦TCP/IP: You can configure your Internet connection for Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP), AOL dialup, or enter the settings manually. The
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) dialup con-
nection that you choose determines what fields are available. Your ISP
will supply you with these settings.
✦PPP: These settings are used for a Point-to-Point Protocol connection
over a telephone modem. Again, your ISP will provide you with the right
values to enter here. If you’re supplied with a secondary telephone
number to dial when the primary is busy, enter it into the Alternate
Number field.
If you’re concerned about who’s using your Internet connection — or
you want to add an extra layer of security when you dial out — disable
the Save Password check box, and Mac OS X will prompt you each time
for your Internet account password.
✦Proxies: Some ISPs use proxy servers for their dialup accounts to main-
tain security, but (as I mention earlier in this section) changing these
settings willy-nilly is inviting disaster. Leave them disabled unless given
specific instructions on what to set by your ISP.
✦Modem: Click the drop-down Modem list box and choose the brand and
model of your modem. If Mac OS X detects an internal modem, it’s used
by default.
I strongly recommend that you enable both the Enable Error Correction
and Compression in Modem and the Wait for Dial Tone Before Dialing
check boxes because they will provide you with the best performance
and the fastest speeds.
You can also select tone or pulse dialing and whether you want to hear
the two modems conversing. (If the caterwauling bothers you, turn off the
Sound option.) If you like, Mac OS X can notify you with an alert sound if
you receive an incoming call while you’re connected to your ISP — just
enable the Connection check box on the Modem panel. If you live outside
the United States, click the Change button to select the proper Country
Setting; this governs how your modem dials your ISP. Finally, I recommend
that you enable the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check box, which
gives you a visual reference on your connection status.

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
220
When you select Built-in FireWire from the Show drop-down list box, the tabs
displayed are
✦TCP/IP: These settings allow you to configure a network connection
using TCP/IP over a FireWire connection. The choices here are the same
as with the Built-in Ethernet configuration above.
✦Proxies: If you need to configure proxy servers for use over your
FireWire network, you’ll find the same settings here that I outline earlier
for the Built-in Ethernet configuration.
To enable and disable your network ports, click the Show drop-down list box
and choose Network Port Configurations. You can enable the On check box
to toggle individual ports — for instance, if you don’t use your internal
modem on your laptop, you can turn it off to conserve power. And you can
drag configurations into any desired order to specify which ports Mac OS X
should use first when connecting.
QuickTime preferences
The QuickTime group is shown in Figure 3-19. For complete details on
QuickTime, streaming media, and viewing movies downloaded from the Web,
see Book III, Chapter 7.
If you’ve purchased a registration code for QuickTime Pro or Player Pro,
click the Register tab to enter it.
The other panels here are
✦Browser tab: These settings determine how QuickTime acts when it’s
used as a Web browser plug-in. Enable the Play Movies Automatically
check box to toggle automatic playback of movies that you’ve

downloaded from the Web. If you’ll be viewing downloaded QuickTime
movies often, it’s a good idea to enable the Save Movies in Disk Cache
check box — this improves the playback performance. Drag the Movie
Download Cache Size slider to the right to dedicate more hard drive
space for movie caching.
✦Update tab: By default, QuickTime checks for new updates automati-
cally, but you can check for new updates immediately by clicking the
Update button. You can also add QuickTime enhancement software from
other companies by clicking the Install button.
✦Streaming tab: Click the Streaming Speed drop-down list to choose the
data transfer speed closest to your connection rate. This optimizes
QuickTime’s streaming video performance to match your connection.
Click the Instant-On button to enable or disable streaming playback the
moment that you start to receive the media (without queuing a signifi-
cant amount first, which takes time). The faster your Internet connec-
tion is, the less time you’ll need to queue a media stream. Drag the delay
slider to adjust the time delay allowed for caching.
✦Advanced tab: If you’ve added a software-based music synthesizer (such
as Deck or VST) to Mac OS X, you can click Default Synthesizer to use it
instead of QuickTime’s built-in synthesizer.
When the Enable Kiosk Mode check box is enabled, the options available
from the Player window no longer include the ability to save movies or
change QuickTime settings. This is a good idea when your kids will be
downloading and watching movies from the Web.
If you receive protocol error messages from QuickTime, click the
Transport Setup drop-down list box and choose the Automatic setting.
Mac OS X will choose the correct transport protocol and port ID for 
your connection.
If you need to change the MIME file types that QuickTime will play from
a Web page, click the MIME Settings button. (These are the different
types of multimedia files that you’ll encounter on the Web, like video,
audio, and photographs.) However, I recommend that you use the
default settings because otherwise you might end up downloading a file
type that you can’t use because you’ve disabled it.
Often, third-party media players will, in effect, take over the MIME file
types from QuickTime. Naturally, this is what you want, if you like the
new player application. However, if you decide that the new player is not
your style, you can return QuickTime to its rightful place as Kahuna of
the Web Downloads by displaying the MIME settings, clicking the Use
Defaults button, and then clicking OK.
If you play MP3 or MOV files that require secure media keys, you can
click the Media Keys button and enter the category and key. To edit a
key, select it from the list and click the Edit button. To remove a key
from the list, select it and click the Delete button.

The three tabs here are
✦Services tab: Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of
sharing, including Personal File Sharing (with other Macs), Windows
Sharing (with PCs running Windows), Personal Web Sharing, Remote
Login, FTP Access, Apple Remote Desktop, Remote Apple Events, and
Printer Sharing. To turn on any of these services, enable the On check
box for that service. To turn off a service, choose it from the list and
click the Stop button that appears.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only
those services that you will actually use. A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not a good thing.™

✦Firewall tab: As I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 6, Mac OS X includes a
built-in firewall, which you can enable from this panel. When the firewall
is on, communication to any service not allowed in the list is blocked.
(In firewall-speak, these entries are called rules because they determine
what’s allowed to pass through to your Mac.)
After you click Start to enable the firewall, it’s easy to enable communi-
cations with a service: select the entry in the list and enable the On
check box. Click the New button to specify a new rule by entering a port
and assigning it a name. After you create a new rule, it appears in the
list, and you can toggle it on and off like any of the default rules. Click
the Edit button to edit the selected rule; click the Delete button to
remove the selected rule.
If you’re using an Internet or network connection, I strongly urge you to
enable the firewall (but only after you review Book V, Chapter 2). However,
if you suddenly can’t connect to other computers or share files that you
were originally able to share, it’s time to review the rules that you’ve
enabled from this panel.
✦Internet tab: If you want to share the Internet connection from this
Macintosh, click the port to use in the Share Your Connection From
drop-down list box — this will almost always be the Built-in Ethernet
option — and then click Start.
Tweaking the System
The last section of the System Preferences window covers system-wide set-
tings that affect all users and the overall operation of Mac OS X.
Accounts preferences
The Accounts group is illustrated in Figure 3-21.
Each user on your system has an entry in this list. The panels here change,
depending on the access level of the selected account. They can include
✦Password tab: Click in these text fields to enter or edit the account
name, password, and password hint for the selected user.
Click the Address Book Card button to edit the card that you’ve marked
in the Address Book as My Card. Mac OS X launches the Address Book,
and you can edit your card to your heart’s content. (For the complete
scoop on the Mac OS X Address Book, see Book I, Chapter 6.)
✦Picture tab: From the Picture panel, you can either choose one of the
thumbnail images provided by Apple to represent you or click Edit to
drag a new image from the Finder.

Tweaking the System
224
✦Login Items tab: The applications that you add to this list will launch
automatically each time that the current user logs in to Mac OS X. To
add an application, click the Add button (which carries a plus sign), 
navigate to the desired application and select it, and then click the 
Add button. (Alternatively, you can simply drag an item from a Finder
window into the Login Items list.) To remove an application from the 
list, click to select it and then click the Remove button (which has a
minus sign). Each application can be launched in a hidden state, meaning
that its window doesn’t appear on the Desktop. To toggle an item as
hidden or visible, enable the Hide check box next to the desired applica-
tion. The order that Login Items are launched can be changed by drag-
ging entries in the list into the desired sequence.
You can even set up Login Items directly from the Dock! Control-click (or
right-click) the desired Dock icon to display the pop-up menu and then
click Open at Login.
✦Parental Controls tab: This panel is available only when you’re adding
or editing a standard-level account. You can choose to assign limitations
based on specific applications and the Finder itself. For more informa-
tion about assigning limitations, refer to Book II, Chapter 5.
A word about the Login Options button (look for the little house icon, lower
left). Click it to set a number of global options that control how users log in.
For example, you can choose to display either a Name and Password field on
the Login screen (which means that the user must actually type in the cor-
rect username) or a list of users, from which a person can select a user ID.

(If security is a consideration, use the Name and Password option.) You can
also add VoiceOver spoken interface support at the Login screen, making it
easier for physically challenged users to log in to this Mac.
If you choose, you can log in automatically as the selected user by clicking
the Login Options button and enabling the Automatically Log in As
<Username> feature.
The Login Options panel also allows you to enable or disable Fast User
Switching (which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 5), and you can prevent
anyone from restarting or shutting down the Mac from the Login screen 
by enabling the Hide the Restart and Shut Down Buttons check box.
Classic preferences
Figure 3-22 shows the Classic System Preferences settings.
The three panels here are
✦Start/Stop tab: You can select from multiple Mac OS 9 System folders
when launching Classic, and you can elect to start Classic automatically
when the current user logs in. (Personally, I don’t use Classic often, so 
I don’t run it automatically at login — therefore saving those system
resources for my other applications.) If you’d rather be prompted before
Classic is launched, enable the Warn Before Starting Classic check box.
You can launch Classic manually from this panel by clicking Start; if
Classic is encountering problems, you can click the Restart or the Force
Quit buttons as well.
Note that you can monitor the status of Classic mode by enabling the
Show Classic Status in Menu Bar check box. This can be a boon for
those who use many legacy applications from the days of Mac OS 9.
✦Advanced tab: Three special start-up options are available from the
drop-down list — and only when you use the Start Classic button on this
panel. (As you might expect, these options are typically only for debug-
ging and troubleshooting.) You can elect to start Classic with all exten-
sions turned off, or you can open the Extensions Manager to toggle
individual extensions on and off within Classic. Finally, you can choose
Use Key Combination from the drop-down list to start or restart Classic
when you press a shortcut sequence of up to five keys.
To use preferences from the current user’s Home folder, enable the Use
Mac OS 9 Preferences from Your Home check box. If this is disabled,
preferences from the System folder that you choose on the Start/Stop
panel are used. You can specify the amount of inactivity before Classic
switches to sleep mode, and you can rebuild the Classic Desktop, which
is a good idea if custom icons disappear or documents that once had
recognized file types are no longer recognized.

✦Memory/Versions tab: This panel displays information on both Classic
and the applications that it’s running. To show background processes
that would normally be invisible, mark the Show Background
Applications check box to enable it.
Date and time preferences
Click the System Preferences Date & Time icon to display the settings that
you see in Figure 3-23.
The three tabs here are
✦Date & Time tab: To set the current date, click the date within the mini-
calendar; to set the system time, click in the field above the clock and
type the current time.
You can’t set these values manually if you use a network time server. To
automatically set your Mac’s system time and date from a network time
server, enable the Set Date & Time Automatically check box and then
choose a server from the drop-down list that corresponds to your loca-
tion. (Of course, you need an Internet connection to use a network time
server.)
✦Time Zone tab: Click your approximate location on the world map to
choose a time zone or click the Closest City drop-down list and choose
the city that’s closest to you (and shares your same time zone).

✦Clock tab: If you enable the Show the Date and Time check box, you 
can choose to view the time in text or icon format. The clock can appear
on the menu bar or in its own window. You can also optionally display
seconds, AM/PM, and the day of the week; have the time separator char-
acters flash; or use a clock based on 24 hours. If you choose a clock
window, you can even specify the transparency of that window so that 
it won’t interfere with applications behind it.
Personally, I get a big kick out of my Mac announcing the time on the
hour . . . plus, it helps pull me back into the real world. (You’ve got to eat
sooner or later.) Anyway, if you’d like this helpful reminder as well,
enable the Announce the Time check box on the Clock panel, and click
the drop-down list to select an hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour
announcement.
Software Update preferences
The Software Update settings are shown in Figure 3-24. (Oh, and don’t forget
that you’ll need an active Internet connection.)
The two panels here are
✦Update Software tab: I recommend enabling the Check for Updates
check box — and I also recommend that you choose Daily or Weekly
from the drop-down list box. (You can also elect to download critical
updates in the background automatically while you continue working.)
To check immediately, click the Check Now button.

✦Installed Updates tab: Click this tab to display a list of the updates that
you’ve already applied to Mac OS X. You can open the list as a log file as
well, which allows you to cut and paste text.
Speech preferences
Figure 3-25 illustrates the Speech settings. For a discussion of how these set-
tings are used, visit Book VII, Chapter 3.
The two panels here are
✦Speech Recognition tab: This tab has two tabs of its own: Settings and
Commands. With Speakable Items toggled on, you can control Tiger with
spoken commands.
• Settings tab: If you have more than one microphone, you can select
which one you want to use as well as set the input volume with the
Calibrate button. You can change the Listening key (Esc by default)
and specify whether your Mac should listen only while the key is
pressed or whether the Listening Key toggles listening on and off. You
can also change the name of your computer (using the Keyword box)
and whether that name is required before a command. From the Play
This Sound drop-down list, you can indicate what sound effect Mac
OS X will play when it recognizes a speech command. (Optionally,
Tiger can confirm the command by speaking it if you enable the Speak
Command Acknowledgement check box.)
• Commands tab: Here you can select which types of commands are
available as well as whether exact wording of command names is
required. Click the self-named button to open the Speakable Items
Folder from this panel. Read more about these settings in Book VII,
Chapter 3.

✦Text to Speech: Here’s a fun panel. Click a voice from the System Voice
drop-down list box, and Mac OS X will use that voice to speak to you
from dialogs and applications. You can set the Speaking Rate (from Slow
to Fast) and play a sample by clicking the Play button. (Try Zarvox,
Bubbles, and Pipe Organ.)
The Announce When Alerts are Displayed feature actually speaks the
text within alert dialogs; to configure spoken alerts, click the Set Alert
Options button. You can optionally add a phrase before the text, which
you can choose from the Phrase drop-down list box. To add a phrase to
the list, like Don’t Panic!, choose Edit Phrase List from the list. Move the
Delay slider to specify how much time your Mac should wait before
reading the dialog to you.
You can also optionally announce when an application wants your atten-
tion, and Tiger can speak the text that’s currently selected within an
application when you press a key that you specify.
This pane also provides a couple of convenient shortcut buttons that take
you to other “speech centers” within System Preferences — specifically, the
Date & Time and Universal Access panes.
Startup Disk preferences
Figure 3-26 illustrates the Startup Disk settings.
To select a start-up disk, click the desired start-up folder from the scrolling

Mac OS 9 System folders have a 9 icon, and Mac OS X folders have the famil-
iar blue X logo. Mac OS X displays the version numbers of each system and
the physical drives where each system resides. Select the Network Startup
icon if you’d like to boot from a System folder on your local network — typi-
cally, such a folder is created by your network administrator.
If you’re planning on rebooting with an external Universal Serial Bus (USB)
or FireWire start-up disk, that disk must already be connected, powered on,
and recognized by the system before you display these settings.
Tiger introduces a new button on the Startup Disk pane. Click Target Disk
Mode to restart this Mac as a FireWire external hard drive connected to
another computer. (This comes in especially handy when you’re upgrading
to a new Mac and you need to move files between the two computers. I’ve
also used it when the video card in one of my Macs decided to stop working.
This allowed me to make an updated backup copy of the ailing Mac’s hard
drive before I sent it off for repair.) You can also restart your Mac and hold
down the T key to invoke Target Disk Mode.
After you click a folder to select it, click the Restart button. Mac OS X con-
firms your choice, and your Mac reboots.
Universal Access preferences
The final group, Universal Access, is shown in Figure 3-27. These settings
modify the display and sound functions within Mac OS X to make them more
friendly to physically challenged users. Note that if you select the VoiceOver
On radio button, Mac OS X speaks the text for all text and buttons onscreen.

The four panels here are
✦Seeing tab: These settings make it easier for those with limited vision to
use Mac OS X. You can toggle VoiceOver on and off from here; I discuss
more on this feature and these settings in Book VII, Chapter 3. To turn
on the display Zoom feature, select the Zoom On radio button or press
Ô+Option+8.
To specify how much magnification should be used, click the Options
button. From the sheet that appears, you can set the minimum and maxi-
mum Zoom magnification increments. From the keyboard, use
Ô+Option+= (equal sign) to zoom in and Ô+Option+– (minus sign) to
zoom out. Optionally, you can display a preview rectangle of the area
that will be included when you zoom.
Mac OS X can also smooth images to make them look better when
zoomed. If you prefer white text on a black background, select the White
on Black radio button (or press the Ô+Option+Control+8 keyboard
shortcut). Note that depending on your display settings, it might be
easier on the eyes to use grayscale display mode by selecting the Use
Grayscale check box.

✦Hearing tab: If you need additional visual cues to supplement the
spoken and audio alerts in Mac OS X, click this tab and enable the Flash
the Screen When an Alert Sound Occurs check box. To raise the overall
sound volume in Mac OS X, you can click the Adjust Sound button to dis-
play the Sound System Preferences settings, where you can drag the
Volume slider to the right.
✦Keyboard tab: These settings help those who have trouble pressing key-
board shortcuts or those who often trigger keyboard repeats (repetition
of the same character) accidentally. If you mark the Sticky Keys On radio
button, you can use modifier keys individually that will be grouped
together automatically as a single keyboard shortcut. (You can optionally
specify that Mac OS X should sound a beep tone when a modifier key is
pressed and whether the modifier keys should be displayed onscreen.)
Sticky Keys (a feature that allows you to press the modifier keys in a key
sequence one after another instead of all together) can be toggled on
from the keyboard by pressing the Shift key five times. Turn Slow Keys
on to add a pause (of the length that you specify) between when a key 
is pressed and when it’s actually acted upon within Mac OS X. You can
optionally add a key-click sound each time that you press a key. To turn
keyboard repeat off entirely, click the Set Key Repeat button, which
opens the Keyboard preference settings that I discuss earlier.
✦Mouse tab: With Mouse Keys active, you can use the numeric keypad to
move the mouse pointer across your screen. Mouse Keys can be toggled
on and off by pressing the Option key five times. Drag the Initial Delay
and Maximum Speed sliders to specify how long you must hold down a
keypad key before the pointer starts to move, as well as how fast the
pointer should move across the screen. The cursor can be resized to
make it easier to spot onscreen. You can also click the Open Keyboard
Preferences button to turn on Full Keyboard Access.

W
hether you’re setting up Mac OS X for use in a public library or simply
allowing your 12-year-old to use your Mac in your home office, config-
uring Tiger for multiple users is a simple task. However, you must also con-
sider the possible downsides of a mismanaged multi-user system: files and
folders being shared that you didn’t want in the public domain, users log-
ging in as each other, and the very real possibility of accidental file deletion
(and worse).
Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to take those first steps before
you open Pandora’s Box — setting login options, configuring the personal
account that you created when you first installed the operating system, and
protecting your stuff. (Network administrators call this security check-up
locking things down.)
How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
When you create multiple users in Mac OS X, each person who uses your
Macintosh — hence the term user — has a separate account (much like an
account that you might open at a bank). Mac OS X creates a Home folder 
for each user and saves that user’s preferences independently from other
users. When you log in to Mac OS X, you select (or provide) a username and 
a password, which identifies you. The username/password combination tells
Mac OS X which user has logged on — and therefore, which preferences and
Home folder to use.
Each account also carries a specific level, which determines how much con-
trol the user has over Mac OS X and the computer itself. Without an account

How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
234
with the proper access level, for example, a user might not be able to display
many of the panels in System Preferences.
The three account levels are
✦Root: Also called System Administrator, this uber-account can change
anything within Mac OS X — and that’s usually A Very Bad Thing, so it’s
actually disabled as a default. (This alone should tell you that the Root
account shouldn’t be toyed with.) For instance, the Root account can
seriously screw up the UNIX subsystem within Mac OS X, or a Root user
can delete files within the Mac OS X System Folder.
Enable the System Administrator account and use it only if told to do
so by an Apple technical support technician. To enable the Root
account, you must launch NetInfo Manager, which is stored in the
Utilities folder inside your Applications folder.
✦Administrator: (Or admin for short.) This is the account level that you
were assigned when you installed Mac OS X. Note: The administrator
account should not be confused with the System Administrator account!
It’s perfectly okay for you or anyone you assign to use an administrator
account. An administrator can install applications anywhere on the
system, create/edit/delete user accounts, and make changes to all the
settings in System Preferences. However, an administrator can’t move or
delete items from any other user’s Home folder, and administrators are
barred from modifying or deleting files in the Mac OS X System Folder.
A typical multi-user Mac OS X computer will have only one 
administrator — like a teacher in a classroom — but technically, you 
can create as many administrator accounts as you like. If you do need 
to give someone else this access level, assign it only to a competent,
experienced user whom you trust.
✦Standard: A standard user account is the default in Mac OS X. Standard
users can install software and save documents only in their Home fold-
ers and the Shared folder (which resides in the Users folder), and they
can change only certain settings in System Preferences. Thus, they can
do little damage to the system as a whole. For example, each of the stu-
dents in a classroom should be given a standard-level account for the
Mac OS X system that they share.
If Parental Controls are applied to a standard account, it becomes a man-
aged account, allowing you to fine-tune what a standard account user
can do. (I discuss Parental Controls at length in Book II, Chapter 5.)
The next chapter of this mini-book covers the entire process of creating and
editing a user account.

Configuring Your Login Screen
235
Configuring Your Login Screen
Take a look at the changes that you can make to the login process. First, 
Mac OS X provides three methods of displaying the login screen:
✦Logging in with a list: To log in, click your account username in the 
list, and the login screen displays the password prompt. Type your 
password — Mac OS X displays bullet characters to ensure security —
and press Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Logging in with username and password: Type your account username
in the Name field and press Tab. Then type your password and press
Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Auto Login: With Auto Login set, Mac OS X automatically logs in the
specified account when you reboot. In effect, you never see the login
screen unless you click Log Out from the Apple menu. (Naturally, this 
is an attractive option to use if your computer is in a secure location —
like your office — and you’ll be the only one using your Mac.)
To specify which type of login screen you see — if you see one at all — head to
System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options button.
✦To set Auto Login, display the Login Options settings and select the
Automatically Log in As check box to enable it. Click the account name
drop-down list box and choose the account that should automatically log
in. When Mac OS X displays the user Name and Password sheet that you
see in Figure 4-1, type the corresponding password and then click OK.
Never set the Auto Login feature to an admin-level account unless you’re
sure to be the only one using your Mac. If the computer is rebooted,
you’re opening the door for anyone to simply sashay in and wreak
havoc!
✦To determine whether Mac OS X uses a list login screen, you must again
visit the Login Options settings panel (see Figure 4-2). Select the List 
of Users radio button for a list login screen or select the Name and
Password radio button for a simple login screen where you must type
your username and password.
To change settings specific to your account — no matter what your access
level — log in with your account, open System Preferences, and click
Accounts. From here, you can change your account password and picture,
the card marked as yours within the Address Book, and the Login Items
launched automatically when you log in. (Peruse more information on the
Address Book in Book I, Chapter 6.)

Locking Things Down
237
To log out of Mac OS X without restarting or shutting down the computer,
choose the Apple menu and then either choose Log Out or just press
Ô+Shift+Q. You’ll see the confirmation dialog shown in Figure 4-3. Although
Mac OS X will display the login screen after two minutes, someone can still
saunter up and click the Cancel button, thereby gaining access to your stuff.
Therefore, make it a practice to always click the Log Out button on this
screen before your hand leaves the mouse!
You can also enable Fast User Switching from the Login Options panel. This
feature allows another user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s
applications are still running in the background. When you enable switching,
Tiger displays the currently active user’s name at the right side of the Finder
menu bar. Click the name, and a menu appears; click Login Window, and
another user can then log in as usual. Even though you’re playing musical
chairs, the Big X remembers what’s running and the state of your Desktop
when you last left it. (When you decide to switch back, Tiger prompts you
for that account’s login password . . . just in case, you understand.)
Locking Things Down
If security is a potential problem and you still need to share a Mac between
multiple users, lock things down. To protect Mac OS X from unauthorized
use, take care of these potential security holes immediately:
✦Disable the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons. Any computer can
be hacked when it’s restarted or turned on, so disable the Restart and
Shut Down buttons on the login screen. (After a user has successfully
logged in, Mac OS X can be shut down normally by using the menu item
or the keyboard shortcuts that I cover earlier.) Open the Accounts panel
in System Preferences, click the Login Options button, and enable the
Hide the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down Buttons check box. Press Ô+Q 
Figure 4-3:
Always click
Log Out
before you
leave your
Mac.

Starting Applications Automatically After Login
238
to quit and save your changes. (You can find more about restarting and
shutting down in Book I, Chapter 2.)
✦Disable list logins. With a list login, any potential hacker already knows
half the information necessary to gain entry to your system — and often
the password is easy to guess. Therefore, set Mac OS X to ask for the
username and password on the Login screen, as I describe earlier. This
way, someone has to guess both the username and the password, which
is a much harder proposition.
✦Disable Auto Login. A true no-brainer. As I mention earlier in the chapter,
Auto Login is indeed very convenient. However, all someone has to do is
reboot your Mac, and the machine automatically logs in one lucky user! To
disable Auto Login, display the Accounts panel in System Preferences and
click the Login Options button; then disable the Automatically Log In As
<username> check box.
✦Disable the password hint. By default, Mac OS X obligingly displays the
password hint for an account after three unsuccessful attempts at enter-
ing a password. Where security is an issue, this is like serving a hacker 
a piece of apple pie. Therefore, head to System Preferences, display the
Accounts settings, click each user’s account in the list, and make sure
that the Password Hint box is empty.
✦Select passwords intelligently. Although using your mother’s maiden
name for a password might seem like a great idea, the best method of
selecting a password is to use a completely random group of mixed let-
ters and numbers. If you find a random password too hard to remember,
at least add a number after your password, like dietcoke1 — and no, that
is not one of my passwords. (Nice try.)
For even greater security, make at least one password character upper-
case, and use a number at the beginning and ending of the password. Or,
do the “c001” thing and replace characters with numbers, like the zero
that you insert in dietc0ke.
Starting Applications Automatically After Login
Here’s one other advantage to logins — each account can have its own selec-
tion of applications that run automatically when that user logs in. These appli-
cations are Login Items. (For the Mac OS 9 old-timers, these are the same as
the Startup Items in days gone by.) A caveat or two:
✦The users setting their Login Items must be logged in. Only the user
can modify his or her own Login Items.
✦Users must have access to System Preferences. If the person is using a
standard-level account, it must allow access to System Preferences.

Starting Applications Automatically After Login
239
Ready? Let’s begin. Open System Preferences and click Accounts, click your
account to select it, and then click Login Items (see Figure 4-4).
Including an application in your Login Items list is easy: Click the button
with the plus sign to navigate to the desired application, select it, and then
click Add. (Alternatively, you can just drag items from a Finder window and
drop them directly into the list.) Note that items in the list are launched in
order — if something needs to run before something else, you can drag the
item entries into any sequence.
To launch the application in hidden mode — which might or might not dis-
play it in the Dock, depending on the application itself — click the list entry
for the desired item and enable its Hide check box.

n the previous chapter, I introduce you to the different Mac OS X multi-
user account levels and the login process. If you’re ready to share your
Mac with others, you discover how to add new accounts and edit existing
accounts in this chapter. Oh, and yes, I also show you how to frag — that’s
multiplayer game-speak for delete — accounts that you no longer need. I
also demonstrate how to add optional limitations to an individual user
account and how to avoid using a keychain (which is supposed to make it
easier to store that pocketful of passwords that you’ve created on the
Internet).
Yes, you read correctly. By all that’s good and righteous, Mac OS X actually
has a feature that I don’t want you to use. Read on to find out more.
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
All multi-user account chores take place in a single System Preferences
pane. (Cue James Bond theme song.) The Accounts pane is the star of this
chapter, so open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
If you haven’t added any users to your system yet, the Users list should look
like Figure 5-1. You should see only your account, which you set up when
you installed Mac OS X, set to administrator (admin) level.
Adding an account
To add a new user account, follow these steps:
1. In the Accounts pane in System Preferences, click the New User
button — which carries a plus sign — to display an empty user record
sheet that you see in Figure 5-2.

Mac OS X automatically generates a short name for use as your screen
and Buddy name in iChat AV and various network applications. The
short name is also the name of the folder that Mac OS X creates on the
computer’s hard drive for this user. You can keep the default short name
or type a new one, but it must not contain any spaces. For more on iChat
AV, jump to Book IV, Chapter 3. (I’ll wait for you here.)
3. Press Tab again.
4. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
Click the question mark next to the Password field, and Tiger is happy to
display the new Password Assistant, complete with a suggestion. Click
the Suggestion drop-down list box to see additional suggestions. You can
choose the length of the password, and select from several types: letters
and numbers, memorable, or completely random. To insert a password
from the Assistant, use Ô+C to copy the password, click in the Accounts
Password text box, and then press Ô+V (or click the password and drag
it to the Accounts Password text box).
As always, when you enter a password or its verification, Mac OS X dis-
plays bullet characters for security.
5. Press Tab, type the password again in the Verify text box, and press
Tab again.
6. (Optional) If you decide to use the password hint feature that I
describe in Book II, Chapter 4, you can enter a short sentence or ques-
tion in the Password Hint text box. 
The hint is displayed after three unsuccessful attempts at entering the
account password.
I recommend that you do not use this option. Think about it: Any hack
could type in anything three times to get your hint to pop up! If you do
use this option, at least make sure that the hint is sufficiently vague!
Press Tab to continue.
7. To grant this account administrator-level access, enable the Allow
User to Administer This Computer check box.
If this check box remains disabled, the user receives a standard level
account.
8. Click the Create Account button to finish and create the account.
The new account now shows up in the Accounts list and in the Login
screen.

Editing an existing account
If you have administrator access, it’s a cinch to make changes to an existing
account from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Often, this is to
assign a personalized account picture, so I’ll demonstrate that here.) Follow
these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to change in the Accounts list.
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
3. Click the Picture tab to specify the thumbnail image that will appear
in the Login list next to the account name.
Apple provides a number of good images in the scrolling strip — just
click one to select it.
4. To add your own picture, click Edit to drag a new image from the
Finder into the Images well; then click Set.
Alternatively, you can click the Snapshot button to grab a picture from
your iSight or other video camera connected to your Mac. Most cool.
So you like your privacy . . .
These days, everyone’s interested in securing
their personal files from prying eyes. Granted,
this isn’t a problem if you’re the only one using
your Mac. However, if you’re sharing a computer
in a multi-user environment, you might want a
little more protection than just user permissions
for those all-important Fantasy Football forma-
tions that you’ll unleash next season.
Never fear, Tiger offers a feature called FileVault,
which provides Home folder encryption that
should prevent just about anyone except the
NSA or FBI from gaining access to the files in
your Home folder. You can enable the FileVault
feature from the Security panel in System
Preferences. Two passwords control access to
your Home folder when FileVault is active:
 The Master Password can unlock any
Home folder for any user. Only someone
with an admin account can set the Master
Password. The Master Password must be
set before you can turn on the FileVault fea-
ture for any account on your system.
 Your Login Password unlocks your Home
folder.
Personally, I love this feature, and I use it on all
my Macs running Tiger. Yet there is a risk
involved (insert ominous chord here). To wit:
DO NOT forget your Login Password, and make
doggone sure that your Admin user remembers
that all-important Master Password! Mac OS
X displays a dire warning for anyone who’s
considering using FileVault: If you forget these
passwords, you can’t retrieve any data from
your Home folder. Period. As Jerry Reed says,
“It’s a gone pecan.”

1. Click the account that you want to delete in the Accounts list.
2. Click the Delete User button (which is smartly marked with a minus
sign).
Mac OS X displays the confirmation sheet that you see in Figure 5-3.
Note that the contents of the user’s Home folder are saved in a file in 
the Deleted Users folder (just in case you need to retrieve something). If
you’re absolutely sure you won’t be dating that person again, click the
Delete Immediately button (which doesn’t save anything in the Deleted
Users folder).
3. Click OK to verify and delete the account or click the Delete
Immediately button to zap it completely. Click the Cancel button to
abort and return to the Accounts list.

Administrators are special people. Just ask one; you’ll see. Anyway, when 
an administrator creates or edits the account for a standard-level user, 
Mac OS X offers a number of levels of specific rights — Parental Controls —
that can be assigned on an individual account basis.
Figure 5-3:

Parental Controls are available only for standard-level users; administrators
don’t need them because an administrator-level account already has access
to everything covered by Controls.
When do you need Parental Controls? Here are three likely scenarios:
✦You’re creating accounts for corporate or educational users, and you
want to disable certain features of Mac OS X to prevent those folks from
doing something dumb. Just tell ’em you’re streamlining the operating
system. (Yeah, that’s it.) For example, you might not want that one par-
ticular kid making CD copies of The Illustrated Anarchist’s Cookbook in
the classroom while you’re gone. Therefore, you disable the ability for
that account to burn CDs or DVDs.
✦In the same environment, you might want to give a specific standard-level
account the ability to view all the settings in System Preferences. If Roger
in Accounting is both helpful and knowledgeable — oh, and add trustwor-
thy in there, too — you might want to give him this capability so that he
can make necessary changes to the system while you’re on vacation.
✦You want one or more users to access one — and only one — application
on the system, or perhaps just two or three applications. To illustrate: In
my years as a hospital hardware technician, we had a number of computers
that were used solely to display patient records. No Word, no e-mail,
nothing but the one program that accessed the medical records database.
We called these machines dumb terminals although they were actually
personal computers. (This trick also works well if you’re a parent and
you’d like to give your kids access without endangering your valuable
files. Just don’t call your computer a dumb terminal lest your kids take
offense. That’s experience talking there.) If you want to allow access to 
a specified selection of applications, you can set them in that account’s
Controls.
Setting Parental Controls
Time to review what each of the settings does. To display the controls for a
standard account, click the account in the list and then click the Parental
Controls tab. Tiger includes four different categories of controls, as shown in
Figure 5-4:
✦Mail: Click its Configure button to specify the e-mail addresses that this
user can exchange mail with. If the Mail check box is disabled here, the
user can exchange mail with anyone.
✦Finder & System: These settings (which I discuss in a second) affect
what the user can do within Tiger as well as what the Finder itself looks
like to that user.

Book II

User Accounts

247
✦iChat: Click this Configure button to specify the instant messaging
accounts that this user can chat with. If the iChat check box is disabled
here, the user can chat with anyone.
✦Safari: Mark the Safari check box to turn on access controls. The con-
trolled user can access anything in the Safari Bookmarks bar. However, 
if a user tries to access a site that’s not in the Bookmarks bar, he’ll get a
rather stern dialog box explaining that the site he’s trying to visit is off-
limits. (Safari also provides an Add Website button in the dialog that
adds the site to the Bookmarks bar, but an admin user ID and password
must be supplied.)
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the Finder & System controls. Select the Finder
& System check box to enable it, and then click the Configure button to modify
these settings:
✦Open All System Preferences: When this check box is enabled, this
option allows the user to view any setting throughout System Preferences,
just as if the account were administrator-level. However, in order to
change a setting, a managed user must still click the padlock (in the
Figure 5-4:

access 
to many

Standard
account.

lower-left corner of most panes in System Preferences) and enter a valid
admin-level username and password to unlock the controls.
✦Modify the Dock: Enable this check box, and the user can remove appli-
cations, documents, and folders from the Dock in the Full Finder. (If you
don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according to the whims of
other users, it’s a good idea to disable this check box.)
✦Administer Printers: With this check box enabled, the user can modify
the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in System
Preferences (as well as the Printer Setup Utility application). If disabled,
the user can still print to the default printer and switch to other assigned
printers, but can’t add or delete printers or manage the Mac OS X print
queue.
✦Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to change the
account password. If the user isn’t allowed to open all System Preferences
settings, this check box is disabled.
If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is sup-
posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
✦Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user from
recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in 
Mac OS X. (Note, however, that if you’ve loaded a third-party record-
ing program like Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
✦Allow Supporting Programs: If disabled, an application that the user
runs can’t automatically invoke another application.
✦This User Can Only Use These Applications: When this option is enabled,
you can select the specific applications that will appear to the user. These
restrictions are in effect whether the user has access to the Full Finder
or just the Simple Finder (which I cover in a second).
To allow access to all the applications in the specified folders —
Applications, Utilities, Applications (Mac OS 9), and an empty category
titled Other — click the Allow All button (which is the same as disabling
the This User Can Only Use These Applications checkbox). To restrict
access to all applications, click the Uncheck All button. You can also
toggle the restriction on and off for specific applications that Mac OS X
finds in these folders; click the triangle icon next to each folder to expand
the list and then either mark or clear the Allow check box for the desired
applications.

Book II

249
To add a new application to the Allow list, drag its icon from the Finder
and drop it in the list within the desired folder. Alternatively, click the
Locate button and navigate to it, click the application to select it, and
then click Add. After you add an application, it appears in the Others
section of the Allow list, and you can toggle access to it on and off like
the applications in the named folders. (This is a good reason to use the
Other folder, as you can create your own set of applications that you can
easily grant or suspend.)
Assigning the Simple Finder
You can restrict your standard-level users even further by assigning them
the Simple Finder set of limitations. The default Simple Finder, as shown in
Figure 5-5, is a highly simplified version of the regular Mac OS X Finder. The
simplified Dock contains only the Finder icon, the Trash, and folders for the
user’s approved applications, documents, and shared files.
This is the network administrator’s idea of a foolproof interface for Mac 
OS X: A user can access only those system files and resources needed to do
a job, with no room for tinkering or goofing off.
Figure 5-5:
Whoa! It’s

Finder —

great!

Using Keychains — NOT
250
A Simple Finder user can still make the jump to the full version of the 
Finder — click Finder and choose Run Full Finder. The user will have to 
enter a correct admin-level username and password.
You can also change the Auto Login account from the Accounts panel. 
Click the Login Options button under the Accounts list, and then enable the
Automatically Log in As <username> check box to enable it. Click the drop-
down list box to choose the account that will automatically log in when 
Mac OS X starts up. This is yet another good feature for those preparing 
a Mac for public use — if you set the Auto Login to your public standard-
access account, Mac OS X automatically uses the right account if the Mac 
is rebooted or restarted.
You can always choose Log Out from the Apple menu to log in under your
own account. If you need to temporarily disable the Auto Login feature with-
out changing which account it uses, disable the Automatically Log in As
<username> check box.
Using Keychains — NOT
Before I leave this chapter, I’d like to discuss a Mac OS X feature that’s been
around since the days of Mac OS 9: the keychain. Your account keychain
stores all the username/password combinations for Web sites, file servers,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and the like, allowing you to simply
waltz in and start using the service (whatever it is). Sounds handy, doesn’t
it? And it can be, but you’d better watch your step.
I will be perfectly honest here: I hate account keychains. With a passion,
mind you. As a consultant, Webmaster, and the SYSOP (an ancient Bulletin
Board Service acronym meaning System Operator) of an Internet-based
online system, I know what a hassle it is for users to remember separate
passwords, and I feel that pain. However, three massively big problems are
inherent with using keychains:
✦Anyone can log on as you. If your keychain is unlocked, which happens
automatically when you log in, all someone has to do is sit at your desk,
visit a site or connect with a server, and bam! They’re on. As you. Think
about that. And then think how many times you get up from your desk,
just for a second, to grab another Diet Coke or a doughnut.
✦You’ll forget your passwords. If the keychain file is corrupted — and it
can happen — your passwords have gone to Detroit without you. Either
you’ve got them on paper hidden somewhere, they’re on your recent
backup, or it’s time to change your online persona.
✦Keychains need yet another stinkin’ password. Yep, that’s right — your
keychain can be locked (either manually or, with the right settings, auto-
matically), and you have to remember yet another password/passphrase
to unlock your keychain. “When, oh when will the madness end?”

Book II

From a security standpoint, keychains should be completely off-limits for
anyone who’s interested in maintaining a well-locked-down machine. After
all, most folks can completely take care of all their Internet and network con-
nections with a handful of passwords, and that’s no big deal for anyone to
remember. Unfortunately, Tiger creates a keychain automatically for every
user, so you have to monitor (and delete) your keychain data manually. (Sigh.)
However, if you’re the only person using your Mac and it resides in your
home — personally, I’d prefer a bank vault — and you absolutely must use
keychains, you can display them all for the current account from the
Keychain Access application (see Figure 5-6), conveniently located in
Utilities within your Applications folder. Click the Attributes tab and then
click an item in the keychain list to display or edit all its information.
Heck, just think about what I just wrote — anyone can display and edit server
and site information just by launching this application! That includes your
nephew Damien — you know, the one who considers himself the hacker
extraordinaire. (While I’m at it, I should mention that it’s just as bad to set
the Auto Login feature — which I discuss earlier in this chapter — to an
admin-level account. One reboot, and you’re rolling out the red carpet for
the little rascal.)
Click to display information on an Internet password.
Figure 5-6:

advice —

To help lock things down — at least when it comes to your Internet 
communications — follow this path:
1. To display your Internet passwords, click the triangle icon next to the
Passwords category (upper-left) and then choose Internet.
2. Click each Internet password to select it in the list, and then click the
lower-case i button to display the information on that password in a
separate window.
3. Click the Access Control tab to display the settings that you see in
Figure 5-7, one of which I strongly recommend.
To minimize the damage that someone can do with this password, you
can enable the Confirm Before Allowing Access radio button. And for 
yet another level of security, enable the Ask for Keychain Password
check box.
Of course, you’re probably thinking, “Well, Mark, that pretty much 
eliminates the purpose of quick, convenient access without passwords,
doesn’t it?” Yes, indeed it does, but at least your online identity is some-
what safeguarded.

Click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Keychain Access window
to add a new password. Type a name for the item, the username that
you typically type to gain access, and the password for that server or
site. Then click Add and cross your fingers.
To display all the keychains you can access, choose Edit➪Keychain List. To
create a brand new keychain, choose File➪New Keychain. Mac OS X prompts
you for the filename for your new keychain file. In the New Keychain dialog
that appears, enter a catchy name in the Save As text box. By default, the
keychain file is created in the Keychains folder — a good idea — but if you’d
like to store it elsewhere, click the down-arrow button next to the Where list
box and navigate to the desired folder. When you’re ready, click the Create
button. Now you need to enter yet another password, type it again to verify
it, and click OK.
To lock or unlock your login keychain, click the Lock icon at the top-left of
the Keychain Access window. (Unlocking your keychain requires you to enter
your login password. Go figure.)
You might be saying to yourself, “Geez, this guy is more than a little para-
noid.” And yes, dear reader, I suppose that I am. But then again, who’s been
uploading all those questionable images and MP3 files to the company
server . . . using your account?

 Setting and changing permissions
 Sharing documents in Microsoft 2004 for the Mac

N
ow here’s a topic that any Mac OS X power user can sink fangs into —
the idea that a document on a multi-user system can be everyone’s
property, allowing anyone in your family, workgroup, or highly-competitive
mob to make whatever changes are necessary, whenever they like.
Of course, potential pitfalls lurk — even in the Apple world, there’s no such
thing as an operating system that’s both powerful and perfectly simple.
However, I think you’ll find that our dear friends from Cupertino have done
just about as well as can be expected and that the settings that you use to
share documents are fairly easy to understand and use.
Prepare to share!
Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
First, allow me to clear up what I’ve found to be a common misconception
by using another of Mark’s Maxims.
Sharing documents on a single computer is fundamentally different
from the file sharing that you’ve used on a network.™
True, multiple users can share a document over a network, which is a topic
that you’ll find covered in Book V. But although the results are the same, the
way that you share that same document on a single machine betwixt multi-
ple users is a completely different turn of the screw. In this section, I discuss
the factoids behind the matter.

Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
256
No network is required
Although reiterating that no network is required is seemingly the most obvi-
ous of statements, many otherwise knowledgeable Mac OS X power users
seem to forget that sharing a document over a network requires an active
network connection. (Note the word active there.) Unless you physically
copy the document to your hard drive — which defeats the purpose of docu-
ment sharing — any loss of network connectivity or any problem with your
network account will result in a brick wall and a brightly painted sign read-
ing, “No luck, Jack.” (Or perhaps it’s flashing neon.)
On the other hand, a document shared on a multi-user Mac in the home or
classroom is available whenever you need it. As long as the file is located in
the Shared folder, the file privileges are set correctly, and you know the pass-
word (if one is used), then — as they say on Star Trek — “You have the conn”
whether your network connection is active or not.
Relying on a guaranteed lock
Sharing documents over a network can get a tad hairy when multiple users
open and edit the document simultaneously. Applications such as Office
2004 for the Mac and AppleWorks have methods of locking the document
(giving one person exclusive access) when someone opens it or saves it.
However, you always face the possibility that what you’re seeing in a shared
network document is not exactly what’s in the document at that moment.
A multi-user system doesn’t need such exquisite complexity. You’re the one
sitting at the keyboard, and you have control: This is what network adminis-
trators call a guaranteed lock on that document file. Refreshing, isn’t it?
But wait! Mac OS X Tiger includes a feature called Fast User Switching — I 
discuss it in Book I, Chapter 2 — that allows other users to remain logged in
behind the scenes while another user is at the keyboard. Therefore, if you
enable Fast User Switching, two users could have the same document open at
the same time. To prevent this, you can simply turn off Fast User Switching
from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Click Accounts, click Login
Options, and clear the Enable Fast User Switching check box.)
Most places are off-limits
Network users are often confident that they can blithely copy and move a
document from one place to another with the greatest of ease, and that’s
true. Most shared network documents created by an application — such as a
project outline created in Word, for example — carry their own sharing infor-
mation and document settings internally. Thus, you can move that same file
to another folder on your hard drive, and the rest of the network team can
still open it. (Um, if they have the network rights to access the new folder, of
course.)

Book II

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
257
This isn’t the case when it comes to multi-user documents. As you can read
in Chapters 4 and 5 of this mini-book, Mac OS X places a rather tight fence
around a standard-level user, allowing that person to access only the con-
tents of certain folders. In this case, your document must be placed in the
Shared folder for every standard-level user to be able to open it. If everyone
using the document has administrator access, you can then store the file in
other spots on your system; as long as the permissions are set, you’re set.
And speaking of permissions. . . .
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Files are shared in Mac OS X according to a set of rules called permissions,
the ownership of the file (typically the person who saved the document the
first time), and an access level specified as a group. The combination of privi-
leges, ownership, and group determines who can do what with the file.
When you (or the person with the administrator account on your Mac) cre-
ated your user account, you were automatically granted ownership of your
Home folder and everything that it contains as well as any files or folders
that you store in the Shared folder or another user’s Public folder.
Four possible actions are allowed through permissions:
✦Read Only: This action allows the user to open and read the file, which
includes copying it to another location.
✦Read & Write: This permission grants full access to the file, including
opening, reading, editing, saving, and deleting. Read & Write permission
also allows the user to copy or move the file to another location.
✦Write Only (Drop Box): A neat permission setting that appears only
with a folder — it allows access to copy an item to the folder, but not to
read any files it contains. (Hence the informal name Drop Box, and the +
(plus sign) icon added to the folder’s icon to identify it.) For example, a
drop box is made to order for teachers: Students can submit homework
by dragging their work to the teacher’s drop box.
✦No Access: This is just what it sounds like — the user can’t open the file,
copy it, or move it.
No matter what permissions you’ve set, only the System Administrator (or
root user) can copy items into another user’s Home folder. Take my word on
this one: Simply consider that this can’t be done, and stay as far away from
the Root/System Administrator account as possible. (Trust me on this.)
Read all about the perils of enabling the System Administrator account in
Chapter 4 of this mini-book.

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
258
These permissions are set in the Info dialog for a file or folder (always acces-
sible by pressing Ô+I). If you’re setting the permissions for a folder, you can
also elect to apply those same settings to all the enclosed items within the
folder.
To set permissions, follow these steps:
1. Click the item to select it, press Ô+I (or choose Finder➪File) and then
choose the Get Info menu item.
If you have a mouse or trackball with a right button, you can right-click
the item and choose Get Info instead. Either way, Mac OS X displays an
Info dialog like you see in Figure 6-1.
2. Click the right-facing arrow next to the Ownership & Permissions
heading to expand it, as shown in Figure 6-2.
If necessary, click the right-facing arrow next to the Details subheading
to expand it as well.
Because I selected a folder, the Apply to Enclosed Items button appears
at the bottom of the section.
3. If you’re the file’s owner, you can click the lock icon to change the
owner.
Typically, the Owner drop-down list box is disabled.
The drop-down list box displays all the users with accounts on this
machine, as well as some less savory choices such as nobody, system,
and unknown. Don’t choose any of these.
Figure 6-1:
The
collapsed
Info dialog.

Book II
Chapter 6
Sharing Documents

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
259
Perhaps I should be a little less tactful here: Never choose an owner
other than yourself or another recognized standard-level user because
you can potentially prevent yourself from accessing the file in the future!
4. The first Access drop-down list box determines the access level for the
file’s owner.
This will likely be set to Read & Write, and it’s a good idea to leave it
alone. If you’re the file’s owner, you’re likely not a security risk.
5. Assign permissions for an entire group — this is a good idea for limit-
ing specific files and folders to only Administrator access.
Choose the group from the Group drop-down list and select the desired
access permission from the second Access drop-down list box.
6. Set the permission for the Others drop-down list (otherwise known as
“I’m going to lump everyone else into this category”).
If a user isn’t the owner of an item and doesn’t fit into any group that
you’ve selected, this access permission setting for this file applies to
that user.
Figure 6-2:

Info dialog.

Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
260
7. If you’re setting permissions for a folder, Mac OS X can automatically
change the permissions for all the items contained in the folder to the
same settings. Click the Apply to Enclosed Items button, and Mac OS X
displays the confirmation dialog that you see in Figure 6-3.
Generally, it’s a good idea not to override the permissions for all the
items in a folder, so click the Apply to Enclosed Items button only when
necessary.
8. Click OK to proceed or click Cancel to abort the process.
9. After all the permissions are correct, click the Close button to save
your changes and return to your friendly Finder.
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
After you get the basics of sharing files and assigning permissions under
your belt, you need to master when to change permissions and why you
should (and shouldn’t) modify them. Follow these common-sense guidelines
when saving documents, assigning permissions, and choosing access levels:
✦Do use your Shared folder. The Shared folder is the center of proper
document sharing. I know there’s a strong urge to create a new docu-
ment in your Home folder, but you’re just making more work for yourself
because you’ll end up copying that document from your Home folder to
the Shared folder. Instead of an extra step, store a document that’s
intended to be shared in the Shared folder — where it belongs in the
first place.
✦Don’t assign permissions just to protect a file from deletion. Remember,
if all you need to do is prevent anyone (including yourself) from deleting
an item, you don’t need to go to all the trouble of changing permissions.
Instead, just display the Info dialog for the item and select the Locked
check box to enable it, which prevents the item from being deleted from
the Trash until the Lock status is disabled.

Book II
Chapter 6
Sharing Documents

Sharing Stuff in Office 2004
261
✦Do review the contents of a folder before changing permissions for
enclosed items. That confirmation dialog doesn’t appear just for kicks.
For example, if you set a highly sensitive, private document with permis-
sions of No Access for everyone but yourself and then you apply less-
restrictive permissions globally to the folder that contains the document,
you’ve just removed the No Access permissions, and anyone can open
your dirty laundry. (Ouch.) Therefore, make sure that you open the folder
and double-check its contents first before applying global permissions to
the items it contains.
✦Don’t change permissions in the Applications or Utilities folders. If you
have Administrator-level access, you can actually change the permissions
for important applications like Mail, Address Book, iTunes, and Safari, as
well as their support files. This spells havoc for all users assigned to the
standard-access level. Be polite and leave the permissions for these files
alone.
✦Definitely don’t change System ownership. Mac OS X is stable and reli-
able. Part of that stability comes from the protected state of the System
folder, as well as a number of other folders on your hard drive. If you dis-
played the Info dialog for the System folder, you’ll see that the Owner is
set to system, and the Group is set to wheel (a term from the UNIX world
that encompasses all administrator accounts). Now, promptly close that
Info dialog, without making any changes!
✦Do not change any permissions for any files owned by the System
unless specifically told to do so by an Apple support technician. Do
not monkey with System-owned items.
Sharing Stuff in Office 2004
Many Mac OS X applications offer their own built-in document-sharing fea-
tures. For example, Microsoft Office 2004 for the Mac includes both file-level
and document-sharing features. Because Office 2004 is the most popular
productivity suite available for Mac OS X, I discuss these commands in this
final section.
Document-sharing features
You’ll find a number of commands that help multiple users keep track of
changes that have been made in a shared Office document. Probably the
most familiar is the Word revision tracking features (heavily used during the
development of this book), but there are others as well:
✦Revision marks: If several users edit a document, how can you tell who
did what? By using revision marks, which apply different colors to changes
made by different editors, those additions and deletions can be accepted

Sharing Stuff in Office 2004
262
or rejected individually at a later date. If Johnson in Marketing adds incor-
rect material, you can easily remove just his changes. In a worst-case 
scenario, you can actually reject all changes and return the document to
its pristine condition.
✦Compare Documents: Using this feature allows you to compare a revised
document with the original (if, of course, you still have the original file
handy). I use Compare Documents only if revision marks weren’t turned
on before editing began.
✦Comments: Editors can also converse within a document by using
embedded Comments. These don’t change the contents of the Word file
like revision marks do but store commentary and notes in a behind-the-
scenes kind of way. (Think of a Mac OS X Stickie that appears within a
document.) Again, the author of each comment is listed, allowing for
(sometimes heated) communication within the body of a document.
✦Highlighting: You’ve heard the old joke about. . . . Well, anyway, a 
traditional highlighter marker is pretty useless on a computer monitor
(leaving a nasty mess for the next user to clean), but Word allows multi-
ple highlighting colors for identifying text. (And for the occasional prac-
tical joke — nothing like adding eight different highlighting colors to that
important proposal. Just make sure that your résumé is up-to-date.)
File-level sharing features
Along with the document-level sharing commands, you’ll also find that Office
2004 applications also offer sharing features that control access to the docu-
ment file itself.
Password protection
You can add password protection to any Office 2004 document. Follow these
steps with a document created within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
2. In the Save As dialog that appears, click Options to display the Save
Preferences panel.
3. Click Security to display the Preferences panel that you see in Figure 6-4.
4. To password-protect the document, enter a password in the Password
to Open field.
This password must be provided when opening the document.
If you like, you can enter another password in the Password to Modify
field. This second password would then also be required to modify the
document.

Both passwords are case-sensitive.

If you like, Word can save multiple versions of a document in a single file.
Each version is identified by the date and time when it was saved, the user
who saved it, and an additional comments line. Choose File➪Versions to dis-
play the Versions dialog, from which you can choose to automatically save a
new version of the document whenever it’s closed. To save a new version
immediately, click the Save Now button.
Document protection
Think of the Protect Document dialog in Word, from which you can effec-
tively write-protect certain elements, as an extra level of security in a multi-
user environment. In this Office application, you can protect revision marks,
comments, and sections of a document containing forms. A password can be
added if desired. To display the Protect Document dialog, click Tools in any
of the Office 2004 applications and choose Protect Document from the drop-
down list that appears.

 Doing things the hub way
 Digitizing your life
 Making your digital devices work together
H
uzzah! After years of empty promises of professional-quality media
features for home and school — most of them coming from that silly
Gates person in Redmond — Apple has taken on the challenge and devel-
oped a recipe for digital success.
By using tightly integrated hardware and software (where everything works
smoothly together), Apple gives you the ability to easily organize and pro-
duce your own multimedia with the iLife suite of digital tools, which includes
iMovie HD, iDVD, iPhoto, GarageBand, and iTunes. That same software also 
provides fantastic editing capabilities. Finally (and this is very important) —
to paraphrase Will Smith in the movie Men in Black, “Apple makes these 
programs look good.”
First, Sliced Bread . . . and Now the Digital Hub
In today’s overloaded world of personal electronic devices, people can try
to juggle as many as five or six electronic wonders. Each device typically
comes with its own software, power adapter, and connectors to the outside
world. Although managing one or two devices isn’t terribly difficult, as the
number of devices increases, so do the headaches. When you have a half-
dozen cables, power adapters, and software to cart around, the digital life
can become pretty bleak. (And quite heavy. You’ll need more than a back-
pack to lug all that gear around.)
To combat this confusion, Apple came up with the idea of a digital hub,
whereby your Macintosh acts as the center of an array of electronic devices.
By using standardized cables, power requirements, built-in software, and
even wireless connections via Bluetooth (the standard for short-range wire-
less communications between devices), the Macintosh — along with its
operating system, Mac OS X — goes a long way toward simplifying your
interaction with all the electronic gadgets that you use.

What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
268
Given the hub terminology, think of the digital hub as a wagon wheel. (See
Figure 1-1.) At the center of the wheel is your Macintosh. At the end of each
spoke is a digital device. Throughout the rest of Book III, I give you the
skinny on each device, but this chapter gives you the overview and tells you
how they all work together.
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Computers are handy machines. They can process information very quickly
and never get bored when asked to do the same task millions of times. The
problem is that despite their propensity for reliability and speed, they aren’t
so hot in the intuition department. You have to tell them how to do everything
(and most of them only talk to application developers and programmers).
Computers know only one thing — numbers — although they do know num-
bers very, very well.
In fact, binary (the language of computers) has only two values — one and
zero, which represent on and off, respectively. (Think of a light switch that
toggles: The earliest computers were simply banks of switches that filled up
an entire room.) To work with a computer in meaningful ways, you have to
describe everything to a computer with numbers — or, if you prefer, digits.
Figure 1-1:
Hey, look
what’s in the
center of
your digital
hub!

What Can I Digitize?
269
By describing audio in numerical digits, you suddenly have something that a
computer can work with. Toss a computer as many numbers as you want,
and it can handle it. The scientists who figured this out knew that they had a
good thing going, so they proceeded to convert anything that they could get
their hands on into . . . well . . . digits. (Sorry about the atrocious pun.)
Anyway, this resulted in some interesting technologies, most of which you’ll
surely recognize:
✦Audio CDs: The music is represented as numbers and is stored on a
plastic disc.
✦Digital video: Images and sound are stored together on your hard drive
or a DVD as one really, really long string of numbers.
✦Digital fingerprints (no pun intended that time): Your fingerprint is
converted into numerical data, which a computer can use to compare
against fingerprint data from other people.
✦Automated telephone operators: When you call a phone operator these
days, you often aren’t speaking to a real person. Rather, the computer on
the other end of the line converts your voice into digits, which it uses to
interpret your words. (At other times, I think I’m talking to a real person,
but it’s hard to tell.)
What Can I Digitize?
As you’ve probably guessed by now, practically anything can be digitized. As
long as you can represent something as numbers, you can digitize that data.
Whether it’s photographs, video, or audio, your Mac is adept at digitizing
data and processing it.
Photographs
Perhaps the most popular of digital devices, the digital camera has trans-
formed photography forever. By using sophisticated electronics, digital cam-
eras convert the image that you see through the camera viewfinder into an
image made purely of numbers.
After this numeric information is transferred to your Macintosh, your 
computer can cut, twist, fade, label, and paint your digital images. Because
numbers are the only materials involved, you won’t need scissors, paint, or
adhesive tape to edit images. (Advertising photographers can say good-bye
to the old fashioned airbrush.) Your Macintosh does it all by manipulating
those numbers. It cuts down on the messy art supplies and gives you the
comfort of being able to go back in time — something that anyone who’s not
so handy with scissors can appreciate.

The Software That Drives the Hub
270
Music
As I mention earlier in this chapter, audio CDs are one application of music
represented as digital data. The physical CD is just a piece of plastic with a
metal coating, but you don’t even really need CDs any longer. Your Macintosh
can digitize audio for storage on your hard drive, too, which brings up another
important point. Not only is digital information palatable to a computer, but
it’s also very portable. You can store it on any number of storage devices,
such as an iPod or an external FireWire drive. (By the way, if you’re a musician,
you can use GarageBand and external instruments that will turn your Mac into
a combination synthesizer, amplifier, and backup band. Mozart would’ve loved
this stuff.)
Video
When you photograph a scene multiple times per second and then replay
the sequence, you get (tah-dah!) moving pictures. In the analog (as opposed
to digital) world, this would be a strip of celluloid film or a strip of magnetic
tape. In the digital world, such a sequence of photographs is called DV, or
digital video. After you take your digital video, you can transfer that data to
your Macintosh to further manipulate it: You can edit it and add transitions,
text, and other effects.
DVD
Like a CD-ROM or a hard drive, a DVD is simply a means of storing digital
data. Although you can use it to save many different kinds of data, its most
common use is for presenting video content. The Macintosh digital hub can
produce DVDs by using any digital information that you give it.
The Software That Drives the Hub
At the heart of your digital hub is your Macintosh. To use and manipulate 
all the data that arrives at your Mac, your computer needs software, which
provides instructions on what to do with the information that you send.
Fortunately, Apple has fashioned some of the most attractive and easy-to-use
software ever written to help you manipulate and manage your digital
lifestyle. The list of software that belongs to the digital hub includes
✦iPhoto: Use iPhoto to download, manipulate, and organize your favorite
digital photographs. After everything is just so, iPhoto can print them,
burn them to disc, or even help you design and order a hardbound
album! (For way more on iPhoto, go to Book III, Chapter 3.)
✦iTunes: iTunes offers the ability to create and manage your music collec-
tion. You can also purchase and download audio tracks from the Apple

Book III
Chapter 1
The World
According to Apple
The Software That Drives the Hub
271
Music Store. iTunes can even burn CDs! (Head to Book III, Chapter 2 for
more.)
✦iMovie HD: Every film director needs a movie-editing suite. iMovie HD
gives you the chance to set up Hollywood in your living room with out-
standing results. (For more, see Book III, Chapter 4.)
✦iDVD: As home video moves toward the digital realm, iDVD becomes an
essential tool for authoring your own DVD media. Home movies will
never be the same! (iDVD is covered in Book III, Chapter 5.)
✦GarageBand: Call it a “music-building” application! Even if you can’t play
a note, GarageBand makes it easy to create your own original songs —
and if you are a musician, you can turn your Mac into a production
studio. (Turn to Book III, Chapter 6 for more.)
✦iCal: To help keep your hectic digital lifestyle in order, iCal offers com-
plete calendar features. Besides tracking your dates and appointments
on your Mac, you can publish calendars on the Web or share them with
different parts of the digital hub. (Or, if you’ve got an iPod like me, you
can even download your appointments and carry ’em with you.)
✦iSync: With so many digital devices at your disposal, it gets hard to keep
them all straight. iSync is software for automatically synchronizing con-
tact and calendar information between cellphones, your personal digital
assistant (PDA), an iPod, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal.
iPhoto
What good is a camera without a photo album? iPhoto, Apple’s photography
software, serves as a digital photo album. Check out the cool contact sheet
view in Figure 1-2. Use it to help you arrange and manage your digital photos.
Beyond its functions as a photo album, iPhoto also gives you the ability to
touch-up your images through cropping, retouching, scaling, rotating, and
red-eye reduction (photographically speaking, not morning-after speaking).
Besides offering editing features, iPhoto also works automatically with your
digital camera. Simply plug in the camera to your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port, and iPhoto knows it’s there. Need to transfer photos from the
camera to your photo album? iPhoto can do that, too.
When you complete a collection of photographs that you find interesting, use
iPhoto to help you publish them on the Internet or even to create your very
own coffee-table book. (The latest in high-tech: a paper book.) And for those
of you who still want that nifty wallet print to show off at work or a poster to
hang on your wall, you can print them with your own printer or order them
online through iPhoto. Orders made with iPhoto show up in your mailbox —
the US Postal Service physical one outside your domicile — a few days later.

The Software That Drives the Hub
272
iTunes
To help you wrangle your enormous music collection, Apple offers iTunes
(see Figure 1-3). For starters, iTunes is a sophisticated audio player for all
your digital audio files. But iTunes is also handy for converting audio tracks
from audio CDs to a number of popular digital audio file formats, such as
AAC, MP3, and AIFF. After you import or convert your music into computer
files, iTunes helps you manage and maintain your music collection. You can
even listen to streaming online “radio stations,” 24 hours a day.
Plus, Apple throws in the Apple Music Store with iTunes, where you can pre-
view hundreds of thousands of songs for up to 30 seconds each without
spending a dime. If you hear something that you’d like to buy, you can use
your credit card to purchase and download your music (either as individual
tracks for 99 cents each, or as a complete album for a package price). After
the music that you’ve bought is comfortably nestled in iTunes, you can play
it on your Mac, burn it to an audio CD, or download it to your iPod.
Why do I keep harping on the iPod? Well, as a proud owner of one, I’m glad
you asked: Apple’s iPod is a versatile, lightweight audio player with hidden
extras that James Bond would covet. It has enough capacity to store your
entire collection of music, but it’s small enough to fit into your shirt pocket.
With iTunes, you can instantly exchange songs between your Macintosh and
your iPod. You can also use iTunes to create audio and MP3 CDs for playback

albums.

elsewhere. And the iPod even works as honest-to-goodness, back-up storage . . .
you see, it also functions as a standard external FireWire or USB 2.0 hard drive.
It can display text files and play games; you can carry even your Address
Book contacts and iCal appointments with you with aplomb. (For the low-
down on iPod, peruse Book III, Chapter 2.)
iMovie HD
You needn’t restrict yourself to still images: Hook up your digital camcorder
to your Mac as well. Use iMovie HD, the easy-to-use video editing application
shown in Figure 1-4, to create and edit digital movies. With stunning video-
editing candy like transitions, sound effects, and video effects, iMovie HD
turns your home movies into professional productions that you’ll be proud
to share with friends and family. Finally, you can have a home movie night
without putting everyone to sleep.
iDVD
Of course, after you create a video masterpiece, you probably want to save it
on a DVD for preservation and future viewing. To help you in your endeav-
ors, use iDVD to create — or, as video professionals call it, author — DVD
movies. With the preset templates, iDVD will have you cranking out stunning
DVDs with interactive menus in no time, ready to use with any DVD player.

Can I Use All This Stuff at Once?
274
GarageBand
Imagine the freedom to create your own original music by simply dragging
“digital instruments” onto a canvas . . . and then adding your own voice or the
lead instrument! After the basic melody is in place, you’d want to be able to
edit whatever you like, or even choose different instruments with the click of a
mouse. As recently as ten years ago, dear reader, that concept was indeed just
a dream. Then, software-based synthesizers and mixing applications brought
musicians into the digital age. (The problem was that normal human beings
couldn’t afford the expensive software or the sample libraries of literally thou-
sands of different instruments.) With the addition of GarageBand, however, the
iLife suite provides everything that you need to start making your own music
(inexpensively) and then create MP3 files or burn your own audio CDs. And
believe me, if I can create a techno track that actually hit the speakers at a
local dance club, then you can too!
Can I Use All This Stuff at Once?
What makes the digital hub idea even juicier is that it’s an interoperable
model. Let’s pause to appreciate that. (What, you don’t speak engineer? No
problem!) In plain English, the digital hub allows you to use digital media
from one part of the hub with another part of the hub. Thus, the individual
parts of the digital hub can work together to complement each other. To
illustrate, consider some digital sharing scenarios:

✦You shoot a great photograph of your kids. It’s so great, in fact, that you’d
like to use it as the title page of your family’s home movie. With the digital
hub, you can use that same photograph in iMovie HD to create your home
flick. When you’re done with that, transfer the whole thing to a DVD by
using iDVD, and your masterpiece is safe for decades of viewing. One
image just worked its way through three parts of the digital hub.
✦You just recorded a catchy song using GarageBand. You add the song to
the soundtrack of the music video that you’re creating with iMovie HD.
Then you create a fancy opening menu and burn the finished project to
DVD with iDVD to show prospective agents. Again, one piece of media
has traveled through three parts of the digital hub!
✦Your band becomes popular and starts to play some impressive gigs.
To document your band’s rise to stardom, your friend films a concert
with a DV camcorder. You use iMovie HD to transfer the video to your
Macintosh and create clips of your favorite performances of the concert.
After that, it’s a simple matter to author to DVD with iDVD, extract the
audio from the video for use as an MP3, and grab an image from the
video for a band scrapbook that you’re creating with iPhoto. Now you’ve
attained honest-to-goodness DHH (shorthand for Digital Hub Heaven).
You’ve traversed the entire hub, easily sharing the media along the way.
Lest I forget, I should mention the other advantage of the digital hub: The
media that you swap between all your “iApplications” remains in digital
form, so it never loses quality! In the previous example of shooting a concert,
for instance, that concert footage never lost quality while it was being trans-
ferred to DVD, converted to MP3, or pasted into your iPhoto album. Unlike
archaic VHS tape, you don’t have to worry about whether your source is
second-generation — and you can forget degradation and that silly tracking
control.

ood news! It’s time to throw out your Dad’s Hi-Fi from the early ’70s (you
know, the one with the four-inch speakers that you’re embarrassed to
show your friends). Every installation of Mac OS X comes with the newest
gadget in town: a great stereophonic audio application called iTunes. With
iTunes, you can listen to your favorite songs, organize your music collection,
listen to radio stations from around the world, buy music online, burn CDs,
and much more! iTunes has so many features that you’ll soon find yourself
wondering why you even own a stereo at all. In no time, you’ll be pondering
how much new speakers with a subwoofer will cost for your Mac.
In this chapter, I show you how to play audio CDs and Internet downloads, but
that’s just the beginning. You discover how to use iTunes’ Library to get one-
click access to any song in your collection. I even show you how to tune into
Internet radio (and share your favorite songs with others on your network),
burn audio CDs (if you have the necessary hardware), plug in your iPod, and
buy the latest hits from the iTunes Music Store. (And I demonstrate how to
make your iTunes window look just as good as your music sounds.)
Just in case, though, keep your Dad’s Hi-Fi . . . it might fetch a hefty sum as
an antique on eBay.
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is an audio player; it plays audio files. These files can be
in any of many different formats. Some of the more common audio formats
that iTunes supports are

Playing an Audio CD
278
✦MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size (at
the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-minute pop
song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
✦AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer the same recording quality at
significantly smaller file sizes. However, this format also supports a
built-in copy protection scheme that prevents AAC music from being
widely distributed on Macs. (Luckily, you can still burn AAC tracks to an
audio CD, just like MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download from the
Apple Music Store are in AAC format.
✦Apple Lossless: A recent introduction from Apple, Apple Lossless format
provides the best compromise between file size and sound quality: These
tracks are encoded without loss of quality. However, Apple Lossless tracks
are somewhat larger than AAC, so only the most discerning audiophile
usually considers this format for their entire music library.
✦AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the
absolute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the
files are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a
size of 30–50MB.
✦WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, like AIFF.
✦CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store CD
audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
✦Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with qual-
ity levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full qual-
ity of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still great
fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in the
chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your com-
puter’s disc tray, close the tray, start iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock,
and click the Play button. (Note that your Mac might be set to automatically
launch iTunes when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles
that of a traditional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the
iTunes are Play, Previous Song, Next Song, and the Volume Slider, as shown
in Figure 2-1.

Book III
Chapter 2

Playing an Audio CD
279
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the
Play button toggles to a Stop button. As you might imagine, clicking that
button again stops the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with a
mouse, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and
Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The Previous
Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight twist: If a song is
currently playing and you click the Previous Song button, iTunes first returns to
the beginning of the current song (just like an audio CD player). To advance 
to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song button. To change the
volume of your music, click and drag the volume slider.
Like other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with
the keyboard. Table 2-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard
shortcuts.

Playing a Digital Audio File
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can also play the digital audio files
that you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the
WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital
audio file is just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After down-
loading or saving your audio files to your Mac, open the Finder and navigate
to wherever you stored the files. Then simply drag the music files (or an
entire folder of music) from the Finder into the Library entry in the iTunes
Source list. (The added files appear in the iTunes Library. Think of the
Library as a master list of your music. To view the Library, select it in the
left-hand column of the iTunes player, as shown in Figure 2-2. Go figure.)
Heck, you can also drop a song file from a Finder window and drop it on the
iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to your Library as well.
If you happened to drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list,
iTunes adds it to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More
about playlists in a bit.)
To play a song, just double-click it in the Library. Alternatively, you can use
the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, Next Song) that I discuss earlier
in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
Note that the Source list of iTunes can list up to six possible sources for
music:
✦Library: I talk about this in this section.
✦iPod: Note: You have to have one connected.
✦Music Store: I discuss this later in the section, “Buying Music the 
Apple Way.”

Book III
Chapter 2

Playing a Digital Audio File
281
✦Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to
Maroon 5.
✦Shared music: If another Mac on your local network is running iTunes
and is set to share part or all of its library, you can connect to the other
computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears as a
separate named folder in the Source list.)
✦Radio: Think Internet radio stations, which I discuss further in the sec-
tion “iTunes Radio.”
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to
it, such as
✦Song Name: The title of the song
✦Time: The length of the song
✦Artist: The artist who performs the song
✦Album: The album on which the song appears
If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title,
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded
data that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always
add the information to these fields manually. I show you how later in the sec-
tion, “Setting or changing the song information manually.”
Figure 2-2:

282
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Song Name
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title. I click the Time
heading often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs. Oh,
and you can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like.
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become
a task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cum-
bersome as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help
out, iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, brows-
ing mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the Browse button in
the upper right-hand corner of iTunes, as shown in Figure 2-3.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion,
organizing your tunes into four sections:
✦Genre
✦Artist
✦Album
✦Song Name

Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window.
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)
Finding songs in your Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out,
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the
search field of the main iTunes window. As you type, iTunes tries to find a
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in
the results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might
return results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classi-
fied as electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs” later in
this chapter tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other
options.) Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to
restrict the search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes will
watch your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you delete a song from
the Library that’s located only in the iTunes
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes
from another location on your hard drive). That
means you’re about to delete the song entirely,
and there’ll be no copy remaining on your Mac
at all. Rest assured, though, that iTunes will
promptly prompt you to make sure that you
really want to move the file to the Trash. (I get
fearful e-mail messages all the time from read-
ers who are loath to delete anything from
iTunes because they’re afraid they’ll trash their
digital music files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library
that also exists elsewhere on your hard drive
(outside the reach of the iTunes music folder), it
won’t be deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if
you mistakenly remove a song that you meant
to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from the
Finder, or even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.

You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in
your Dock.
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart:
Organizing with Playlists
As I mention earlier, the iTunes Library can quickly become a fearsomely
huge beastie. Each Library can hold up to 32,000 songs: If your Library
grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your lifelong collec-
tion of Paul Simon albums is not going to be a fun task. Furthermore, with the
Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature.
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any
numbers of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist
displays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you
make to a playlist affect only that playlist, leaving the Library intact.
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
✦Choose File➪New Playlist.
✦Press Ô+N.
✦Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected.
✦Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s a
good idea to . . . well . . . name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you’ve got this
book?) For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-
loving friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song to change
the music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and start the playlist
at the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about changing the
music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the accordion.) To load a
playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the songs for that playlist.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a
playlist are simply pointers to songs in the Library — not the songs them-
selves. Add and remove them at will to any playlist, secure in the knowledge

that the songs will remain safe in the Library. Removing a playlist is simple:
Select the playlist in the Source list and then press Delete.
Removing a playlist does not actually delete all those songs from your Library.
Click the Party Shuffle playlist, and you’ll encounter a random selection of
songs taken from your iTunes Library — perfect for your next party! You can
change the order of the songs in the Party Shuffle playlist, add songs from
your Library, or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of your
gathering. Enjoy!
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add
Some playlists are smarter than others
Click the File menu and take a look at a menu
command for creating a smart playlist. The con-
tents of a smart playlist are automatically cre-
ated from a specific condition that you set via
the Smart Playlist dialog: You can limit the track
selection by mundane things like album, genre,
or artist; or you can get funky and specify songs
that were played last, or by the date you added
tracks, or even by the sampling rate or total
length of the song. For example, iTunes can
create a playlist packed with songs that are
shorter than three minutes, so you can fill your
iPod Shuffle with more stuff! Ah, but wait, you’re
not limited to a single criterion. If you want to
add other criteria, click the Plus sign at the right
side of the dialog, and you get another condition
field to refine your selection even further.
You can choose the maximum songs to add to
the smart playlist, or limit the size of the playlist
by the minutes or hours of play or the number
of megabytes or gigabytes the playlist will
occupy. (Again, great for automatically gather-
ing as much from your KISS collection that will
fit into a specific amount of space on a CD or
your iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box
for the ultimate in convenience. iTunes auto-
matically maintains the contents of the smart
playlist to keep it current with your conditions
at all times in the future. (If you remove tracks
manually from a smart playlist, iTunes adds
other tracks that match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. I
created a smart playlist that selects only those
songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 25 songs,
selected by least often played, and live updating
is turned on. The playlist is named Tracks I’ve
Gotta Hear because it finds the 25 rock songs
(from my collection of 1,654 songs) that I’ve
heard least often! After I listen to a song from
this smart playlist, iTunes automatically “fresh-
ens” it with another song, allowing me to catch
up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring. Completely,
unbelievably sweet — and another reason why
iTunes is the best music player on Planet Earth!

to the Library has a complete set of information associated with it. iTunes
displays this information in the Info dialog with the following fields:
✦Name: The name of the song
✦Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
✦Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the
song
✦Album: The album where the song appears
✦Grouping: A group type that you assign
✦Year: The year the artist recorded the song
✦BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
✦Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
✦Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
✦Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing Ô+I —
the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Library might or might not have song
information included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD,
iTunes connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the informa-
tion for each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it
often comes with some information embedded in the file already; the amount
of included information depends on what the creator supplied. (And believe
me, it’s often misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you don’t have
an Internet connection, iTunes can’t access the information and displays
generic titles instead.
Setting or changing the song information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name! To
view and change the information for a song, perform the following steps:
1. Select the song in either the Library or a Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Book III

Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of the
songs in your Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. Incomplete
song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in a hurry. If
you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song (it just
makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with setting
only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, how-
ever, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange.
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but
the DataElves are out to lunch.)
Want to add album covers to your song info? Select one (or all) of the songs
from a single album in the track list, display the Info dialog, and click the
Artwork tab. Now launch Safari, visit Amazon.com, and do a search on the
same album. Drag the cover image from the Web page right into the Info
dialog, and drop it on top of the image well. When you click OK, the image
appears in the Summary pane, and you can display it while your music is
playing by pressing Ô+G, or by pressing the Show or Hide Song Artwork
button at the lower left of the iTunes window! (Note that adding large images
can significantly increase the size of the song file.)

Ripping Audio Files
288
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your
audio CDs with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different for-
mats is ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this process digi-
tal extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular crowd.)
Depending on what hardware or software you use, each has its own unique
format preferences. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or AAC files,
but your audio CDs are not in that format. Being able to convert files from
one format to another is like having a personal translator in the digital
world. You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can simply
convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to MP3 format. To
rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock.
Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the Importing tab.
4. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
5. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and
then click OK.
This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality (it
gives you better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size (tracks
you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates like 192
Kbps or higher).
6. Load an audio CD into your Mac.
The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list, which is on the left side
of the iTunes interface. The CD track listing appears on the right side of
the interface.
7. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from
the CD.
All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default.
Unmarked songs will not be imported.
Notice that the Browse button changes to Import.
8. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click
the Import button.

Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
289
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter,
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way that
your music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 2-5), do one of the following:
✦Choose Window➪Equalizer.
✦Press Ô+2.
✦Click the Equalizer button (refer to Figure 2-1).
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use leftmost
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting a
slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to play
back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that fre-
quency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the
volume of that frequency.
Figure 2-5:
Use the
Equalizer
sliders to

sound of
your music.

A New Kind of Radio Station

Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds how you
like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your set-
tings until you change them again. If you prefer to leave frequencies to the
experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most
musical styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer window to
select a genre.
After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes
from James Brown.
A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in Internet
radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a large number
of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recognized by iTunes, or
even add your favorite stations to your Playlists. This section shows you how
to do it all.
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet —
a process usually called streaming amongst the “In” Internet crowd. iTunes
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with
only a few mouse clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located
directly beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of
more than 20 types of radio stations, organized by genre.
What’s with the numbers next 
to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep
your Internet connection speed in mind. If you’re
using a broadband DSL or cable connection —
or if you’re listening at work over your company’s
high-speed network — you can listen to stations
broadcasting at 128 Kbps (or even higher). The
higher the bit rate, the better the music sounds.
At 128 Kbps, for example, you’re listening to
sound that’s as good as an audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dialup modem
connection, iTunes can’t keep up with audio
streaming at higher bit rates, so you’ll be limited
to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or lower.

When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations
for that category. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis (those passing fads, like
new wave, classical, or alternative), there’s something here for everyone.
The Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you would like to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action,
loads the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web,
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Stream (or press Ô+U). In the Open
Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 2-6), enter the URL of your
desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes will tune in
your station.

This particular technology author has a preference for a certain hot Net sta-
tion: It’s http://12.217.39.187:8000, the address for MLC Radio, which
is the Internet radio station I’ve been running for several years now. I call
my station a ’70s Time Machine because it includes hundreds of classic hits
from 1970–1979, inclusive. You’ll hear everything from Rock and Roll Hoochie
Koo by Rick Derringer to Moonlight Feels Right by Starbuck. (Hey, I’m sum-
ming up a decade here, so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain and
Tenille, too.) The station broadcasts at 128 Kbps, so you’ll need a broadband
connection to listen. Just follow the steps in the next section to add MLC
Radio to your playlists! For more details or additional help connecting to
MLC Radio, visit my Web site at www.mlcbooks.com.
Radio stations in your Playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its Playlists. To add a
radio station to a Playlist from the Radio, do the following:
1. Open the category that contains the station that you want to add to
your Playlist.
2. Locate the station that you would like to add to your Playlist and drag
it from the Radio list to the desired Playlist on the left.
If you haven’t created any Playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier
but possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio sta-
tion URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced
menu, it doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the Playlist. Follow these
steps to add a radio station to a Playlist:
1. Add any radio station from the Radio to your desired Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog
for that station.
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit
URL button.
4. Enter the desired URL.
5. Name the station to your liking and then click OK.
This name is just a reminder for yourself. It doesn’t change the actual
name of the radio station.

Sharing Your Music Across Your Network
293
iSending iTunes to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that
iTunes has features for your personal jukebox as well. iPods, Apple’s MP3
players, comprise an entire family of portable devices (ranging from $99 to
about $399) that can hold anywhere from about 300 songs to literally thou-
sands of songs. This great gadget and those like it have replaced the venera-
ble Sony Discman and Walkman as the preferred portable music player.
You connect your iPod to your Macintosh with a FireWire or USB 2.0 cable
(which are included, natch). After the iPod is connected, it automatically
synchronizes to the Playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes software
communicate with each other and figure out what songs are in your iTunes
Library (as compared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs in your
iTunes Library that are missing from your iPod, the songs automatically
transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains songs that are no longer
in iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those files from its drive.
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in an
effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you con-
nect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you won’t be able to transfer
songs from the iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it
from the marketing perspective as a feature that makes sure your Mac and
iPod are always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and
read all warning dialogs when connecting to a Mac other than your own, or
you might wipe out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . .
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately.
Sharing Your Music Across Your Network
Ready to share your music — legally, mind you — with other folks on your
network? You can use the same type of streaming music broadcasting that I
mentioned earlier (in the section on Internet radio) to offer your music to
other iTunes users across your local network. Follow these steps:
1. Click iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog.
2. Click Sharing.
3. Select the Share My Music check box.
4. Specify whether you want to share your entire library or only
selected playlists.

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
294
Sharing selected playlists is a good idea for those Meatmen and Sex
Pistols fans who work at a cubicle farm in a big corporation.
5. Enter a name for your shared folder.
6. If you want to restrict access to just a few people, select the Require
Password check box; then type a password in the text box.
7. Click OK.
Your shared folder will appear within the Source list for all iTunes users
who enabled the Look for Shared Music check box on the same pane of the
Preferences dialog. Note that the music you share with others can’t be
imported or copied, so everything stays legal.
Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too.
iTunes makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few
mouse clicks — making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is
easier than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of
three formats:
✦Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
✦Data CD: A standard CD-ROM is recorded with the audio files. This disc
can’t be played in any standard audio CD player (even if it supports MP3
CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can listen to these songs only
by using your Mac and an audio player like iTunes 4, or a PC running
Windows.
Sending music elsewhere with AirTunes
If your Mac has an AirPort Extreme wireless
card and you’re using an AirPort Express
portable wireless Base Station, you can ship
your songs right to your Base Station from within
iTunes, and from there to your home stereo or
boom box! (I get into some serious discussion of
AirPort Express in Book V, Chapter 4.)
After your AirPort Express Base Station is
plugged in and you connect your home stereo
(or a boombox, or a pair of powered stereo
speakers) to the stereo mini-jack on the Base
Station, you’ll see a Speakers pop-up list button
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. (If
the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences
dialog, and click the Audio tab. Make sure that
the Look for Remote Speakers Connected with
AirTunes check box is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology
truly grand?

✦MP3 CD: Like the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I just describe, an MP3
CD holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged in such
a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that support the
MP3 CD format (especially boomboxes and car stereos). Because MP3
files are so much smaller than the digital audio tracks found on traditional
audio CDs, you can fit as many as 160 typical 4-minute songs on one disc.
These discs can also be played on your Mac via iTunes.
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs are not the same as the standard audio CDs that
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc
that you burn at home for your own collection.
First things first: Before you burn, you need to set the recording format. Open
the iTunes Preferences dialog by choosing iTunes➪Preferences; then click the
Burning tab. Select the desired disc format by enabling the corresponding
radio button. Click OK to close the Preferences window when you’re finished.
The next step in the CD creation process is to build a playlist (or select an
existing playlist that you want to record). If necessary, create a new Playlist
and add to it whatever songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the ear-
lier section “Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with
Playlists” if you need a refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select
the playlist. When you do, the Browse button changes into a Burn Disc
button. Click that button to commence the CD burning process. iTunes will
let you know when the recording is complete.
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that it
can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music,
as shown in Figure 2-7.
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose Visuals➪Turn Visual On (or press
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins dis-
playing groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the
visuals, choose Visuals➪Turn Visual Off (or press Ô+T again). The usual
sunny, brushed aluminum face of iTunes returns. You can also turn visuals
on or off by clicking the starburst button at the bottom right of the window,
as shown in Figure 2-1.
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the Visuals
menu. From the Visuals menu, choose Small, Medium, or Large to alter the
size of the visual presentation. Similarly, to view the graphics at full screen
size, choose Visuals➪Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape from the Full
Screen mode, click the mouse or press Esc.

Buying Music the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music: the
iTunes Music Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of iTunes.
(That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s time to
turn the page to the next chapter.) If you’re not in iTunes, go to www.apple.
com/itunes/store.
Figure 2-8 illustrates the lobby of this online audio store. Click the Music
Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments, you’ll be presented
with the latest offerings. Click the Choose Genre drop-down list to browse
through the store according to musical genre, or click the Power Search link
to search by song title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward but-
tons at the top of the Music Store window operate much like those in Safari,
moving you backward or forward in sequence through pages that you’ve
already seen. A click on the Home button (which, through no great coinci-
dence, looks like a miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album or track, just click it. If you’re
interested in buying just certain tracks (for that perfect road warrior mix),
you get to listen to 30 seconds of any track — for free, no less, and at full
sound quality. To add a song or album to your Music Store shopping cart,

Buying Music the Apple Way
298
click the Add Song or Add Album button. When you’re ready to buy, click the
Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy Now button. (At
the time of this writing, tracks are 99 cents a pop, and an entire album is typ-
ically $9.99 . . . what a bargain!)
The Music Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address,
and it also keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the Music Store once, you never have to log in or
retype your credit card information again.
The tracks that you download are saved to a separate playlist called
Purchased Music. After the download is finished, you can play them, move
them to other playlists, burn them to an audio CD, share ’em over your net-
work or ship them to your iPod, just like any other track in your iTunes
Library.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio could

F
or years, the Macintosh has been the choice of professional photogra-
phers for working with digital images — not surprising, considering the
Mac’s graphical nature. Apple continues this tradition with iPhoto, a photog-
raphy tool for the home user that can help you organize, edit, and even pub-
lish your photographs. (It sports more features than a handful of Swiss army
knives.) After you shoot your photos with a digital camera, you can import
them into iPhoto, edit them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos
that you take yourself, either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of
digital image files. You can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto
interface to order a handsome hard-bound copy shipped to you.
In this chapter, I walk you through an overview of what iPhoto can do. After
that, I give you a brief tour of the controls within iPhoto so you can see what
features are available to you, including features for managing, printing, and
publishing your photos.
What iPhoto Can Do
iPhoto performs many different types of tasks. From your camera to the
printed page and everything in between, iPhoto steps you through the
process of digital photography:
✦Import: Digital cameras are everywhere these days, so it’s important for
your Macintosh to quickly and easily connect with them. iPhoto takes
the guesswork out of working with a digital camera. Simply plug any sup-
ported digital camera into your Mac’s USB port, open iPhoto, and click a
button or two. (I give you the details later in the section “Importing
Images 101.”) iPhoto automatically imports the images that you’ve taken.
If iPhoto doesn’t recognize your camera, it’s likely either out of battery
power or is not supported.
✦Organize: Ansel Adams would be shocked that a digital camera has no
film (while your kids don’t even raise an eyebrow). Instead, most of

today’s digital cameras use memory modules called cards, which are
instantly reusable. For that reason, you might find yourself taking many
more pictures than usual — and as your collection of photographs
grows, you’ll need some help keeping them all organized (perennial
favorites like paper albums and shoeboxes are out). iPhoto is, at its
core, a digital photo album that you can use to organize, sort, and search
your photographs in seconds. iPhoto offers many great features to help
you manage your digital equivalent of a shoebox full of photos. You’ll
never lose an important photo again.
✦Edit: After you see the images from your camera on your computer moni-
tor, you realize that your dog Lucifer has red eyes (no big surprise there),
your ocean pictures are upside down, and the campfire photos are too
dark. With a traditional film camera, you’d probably toss that campfire
photograph in the trash; thankfully, iPhoto has an array of image-editing
tools that make the bad photos good and the good ones better.
✦Publish: With all these photographs on your computer, you decide that
it would be nice to pass a few on to Aunt Harriet, post a couple on your
Web site, and print the rest. iPhoto guides you through a number of
ways to share your photographs with others. From print to the Internet
to e-mail to CD-ROM, iPhoto takes away the hassle of working with
images on a computer with a simple-to-use interface.
Delving into iPhoto
The iPhoto interface continues in the vein of other iLife iApps, using only
one window (plus the occasional dialog) to work all its magic. The main
iPhoto window is split into three sections: its Toolbar, the Album List, and
the Viewer. Figure 3-1 shows the three main sections of the iPhoto window.
✦Toolbar: The iPhoto Toolbar is the main control center for iPhoto. Along
the Toolbar is a row of buttons (see Figure 3-1). They give you one-click
access to the various modes of iPhoto.
When you change modes, the Toolbar panel changes to reflect the func-
tions available in that mode. For example, click the Edit button to view
the editing functions, such as Crop, Adjust, or B & W (black and white).
Click the Book button to see the controls necessary to publish a hard-
cover or soft-cover photo album.
✦Source List: To the left side of the iPhoto interface is the Source list
(refer to Figure 3-1). This is where you organize your photo albums, film
rolls, and the books you’ve designed. You can also select any source for
viewing or editing.
✦Viewer: The largest portion of the iPhoto interface is the Viewer (also
shown in Figure 3-1). The Viewer, where you see your photographs when
you browse through photo albums, is also the main window for editing
individual images and laying out photo books.

Importing Images 101
After you have the iPhoto basics under your belt, it’s time to get busy. Before
you do anything else with iPhoto, you need to import some photographs
into it. iPhoto provides a couple of ways to import photos, depending on the
source of the image.
Importing images from a digital camera
To import photographs from your digital camera, follow these simple steps:
1. Connect your digital camera to your Macintosh.
Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into
your Macintosh’s USB port. Then prepare your camera to download
images; for most models, that means simply turning on the camera.
2. Launch iPhoto.
Launch iPhoto by clicking its icon in the Applications folder. The first time
that you launch iPhoto, you have the option of setting its auto-launch 
Source list

Viewer
Figure 3-1:
The iPhoto
window has

sections.

feature. If you turn on auto-launch, iPhoto starts automatically whenever
you connect a camera to your Mac. If you want to change the auto-launch
setting at a later date, you can access it from the Preferences menu of
Apple’s Image Capture utility, also located in the Applications folder.
3. Type a roll name for the imported photos.
4. Type a description for the roll.
If you want to delete the images from your camera’s memory card after
they’re safely in iPhoto, mark the Delete Items from Camera After
Importing check box to enable it.
5. Click the Import button to import your photographs from the camera.
While you import images from your camera, iPhoto displays a small preview
in the Toolbar panel. iPhoto sticks the newly imported images in the Photo
Library, which is the warehouse for all your images, as well as in a separate
“virtual” film roll in the Source list.
You can even import short digital video clips from today’s digital cameras!
These clips are stored like your images, but double-clicking a clip thumbnail
in the Viewer plays the clip. And yes, you can drag clips into iMovie HD from
the iPhoto Viewer window. Uber-sassy!
Importing image files
Besides images that you shot with your digital camera, you can also import
any image file on your system into the Photo Library. This could include
images that friends have sent you, that you’ve downloaded off the Internet,
or that you’ve created in a graphics program such as Photoshop. You can
import image files in one of two ways:
✦Choose File➪Add to Library: When you choose this, iPhoto displays a
standard Open dialog. From there, you can choose your favorite image
files for import. (From the keyboard, press Ô+O.)
✦Drag-and-drop: Drag files from the Finder and drop them in the iPhoto
window. iPhoto instantly adds them to the Photo Library.
If you drag a folder of images into iPhoto, it creates a film roll — a famil-
iar method of organizing things, of course — with the folder name as the
roll name. Within that roll are all of your images.
iPhoto recognizes a variety of popular graphics formats, so none of your
image files will feel left out. You can add images with the following formats:
✦JPEG
✦GIF

Book III
Chapter 3

Organizing with Photo Albums
303
✦PICT
✦PNG
✦RAW
✦TIFF
Note that the iPhoto Import function also works with removable hard drives,
external CD/DVD drives, and USB Flash drives. If you can move to a location
in the Open dialog, you can import from it. (Downright versatile, don’t you
agree?)
Organizing with Photo Albums
After you build up your Photo Library by importing photographs with your
camera, your hard drive, and other storage media, you might become over-
whelmed with the volume of images at your disposal. The easiest way to
organize your images for quick access is to use the iPhoto Album feature.
Creating a new Photo Album
To create a new Photo Album, do one of the following:
✦Choose File➪New Album.
or
✦Click the + button at the bottom of the Photo Album List.
Either method brings up the New Album sheet, as shown in Figure 3-2. Type
the name for your new photo album and click OK.
Note that you can rename your Photo Album anything you like. Just double-
click the Album name in the Source List and type the new name.
You can also create a Smart Album from the File menu. A Smart Album con-
tains only photos that match certain criteria that you choose, using the
keywords and rating that you assign your images. (For example, I have a
Smart Album that includes all images with the keyword Family.) Other cri-
teria include recent film rolls, text contained in the photo filenames, dates
the images were added to iPhoto, and any comments you might have
added. iPhoto automatically builds and maintains Smart Albums for you,
adding new photos that match the criteria (and deleting those that you
remove from your Photo Library). Smart Albums carry a gear icon in the
Source list.

Organizing with Photo Albums
304
Adding photos to a Photo Album
After you have your newly created, empty Photo Album in place, add some
photographs to it. Click the Photo Library icon in the Source list (refer to
Figure 3-1) to view all the images in your collection. Drag any photograph that
you want from the Photo Library to your new album in the Source list; iPhoto
instantly adds it to the album, without a single drop of glue. (Remember, a
Smart Album does all this automatically, behind the scenes, so you never
have to add an image manually to a Smart Album.)
“Hey, Mark, isn’t this going to use more of my precious hard drive territory?”
Don’t worry — you’re not making copies of the photograph: iPhoto simply
creates a reference to the image in the Photo Library and adds it to your
Photo Album.
To view the photographs that you’ve added to a Photo Album, click that
album’s icon in the Source List. The images instantly appear in the Viewer.
Note the size-changing slider at the lower right corner of the Viewer. You can
use it to enlarge or reduce the size of the thumbnail images in the Viewer.
(Gee, those good folks in Cupertino think of everything!)

The Art of Organizing with Keywords

Removing photos from a Photo Album
If you suddenly discover that your boyfriend or girlfriend is now an 
ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, you’ll probably want some way to remove
those unwanted photographs from your Photo Album. (Or maybe your rela-
tionship is still rock-solid, but you just want to change the location of a
photo from one Photo Album to another.) Whatever the case, iPhoto makes
it a cinch to remove photographs from a Photo Album. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Photo Album from the Source list.
2. In the Viewer, select the photo that you want to remove from the
Photo Album.
3. Press Delete.
Keep in mind that removing a file from a Photo Album doesn’t remove it from
the Photo Library. (Remember that the Photo Album is just an assortment of
links to your photos.) To really remove that image of your “ex,” you need to
navigate to the Photo Library and delete the picture there, too.
Deleting a Photo Album
It’s just as easy to remove a Photo Album (and every image that it contains)
from your collection as it is to remove photos from that Photo Album. To
delete an entire Photo Album, here’s the overly complex, terribly involved
process:
1. Select the Photo Album in the Source list.
2. Press Delete.
Told you it was easy!
If you mistakenly delete a Photo Album, you can immediately use iPhoto’s
Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and your last action is reversed. However, if
you’ve already gone too far and you can’t use Undo to restore an album, you
can always re-create it manually because the images that were within that
Photo Album still reside in the Photo Library. Simply create the empty Photo
Album again (as I demonstrate earlier), open the Photo Library folder in the
Finder, and drag the files into the album again.
The Art of Organizing with Keywords
Using Photo Albums is a great way to organize your photo collection, but it’s
just the start of what iPhoto can do: You can also assign keywords to images
to help you organize your collection. Keywords give you the opportunity to
quickly search through your photos later. You can use iPhoto’s standard key-
words or create your own. For example, you could organize your photos

The Art of Organizing with Keywords
306
according to important family events. Birthday photos would get one key-
word; graduation photos would get another. Later you can search for that
birthday shot where the cake caught on fire or the graduation where the
valedictorian fainted. When you use keywords, they’re just a few keystrokes
away. Remember this Mark’s Maxim:
Using keywords to organize your photos takes time, but it’s worth it.™
To begin using the keyword feature, select one or more photos in the Viewer.
Then display the Photo Info dialog by choosing Photos➪Get Info — or, for
those who prefer fingers, press Ô+I. Click the Keywords tab, and iPhoto dis-
plays the Keywords dialog, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Select the check box next to the keyword that you want to attach to the
selected images. When you’re done, click the Close button on the Photo Info
dialog to save your changes. Straightforward, just like I like it.
iPhoto comes stocked with a handful of useful preset keywords:
✦Favorite
✦Family
✦Kids
✦Vacation
✦Birthday
✦Grayscale
✦Widescreen
The Checkmark keyword causes a small check mark-in-a-circle icon to
appear in the bottom right-hand corner of any image that gets that assign-
ment. For example, you might temporarily mark your favorite photographs
with the Checkmark keyword. Then it’s a cinch to retrieve just your favorites
by searching for the Checkmark keyword.
You can also display the keywords assigned to each photo in the Viewer.
(Check out Figure 3-3 to see what this looks like.) Choose View➪Keywords to
toggle the display of keywords on and off.
Customizing your own keywords
Besides the keywords that are included in iPhoto by default, you can create
a number of custom keywords . . . after all, not everything fits in Family or
Birthday. To create your own keywords, follow these steps:

Book III
Chapter 3

307
1. Press Ô+, (comma) to display the Preferences dialog.
2. Click the Keywords button on the toolbar.
3. Click Add.
4. Type your own custom keyword name into the edit box that appears
and press Return.
Note that you can also rename existing keywords (by selecting a key-
word and clicking Rename), but keep in mind that they will affect all
images that already use that keyword. You can also delete a keyword:
Select it in the list and then click Delete from the list.
Searching for keywords
As I mention earlier, the more keywords that you assign, the easier it is to
use iPhoto. As your photo collection grows, it can become unmanageable —
to help you out, iPhoto lets you search for photos by using the keywords
that you assigned to the images. To search for images using keywords, do
the following:
1. Click the Keywords button at the bottom-left corner of the iPhoto
window to display the Keywords panel.
The Keywords button proudly bears the label of a key. (Someone was
thinking clearly that day.)
Figure 3-3:

Archibald,

out the
keywords!

2. Click as many keywords as you would like to search by.
3. When you’re done searching, click the Keywords button again to hide
the Keywords panel.
Use the Search tool as a quick and easy way to build a Photo Album. To
create a Photo Album of pictures of your wedding, for example, you could
search for the keyword Wedding (assuming that you assigned that keyword
to your wedding pictures) and then drag the results of the search to a Photo
Album in the Album list. Convenient and sassy to boot!
Taking Care of Business: Basic Editing
Okay, let’s face it: Sometimes mere mortals like you and I don’t take the
greatest photographs. For those times, iPhoto provides a helping hand with
several important editing features with which you can save your dark photos
from the Trash and improve “keepers” into honest-to-goodness art.
To begin editing your photographs, select the photo that you want to edit
and click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar. This displays the Edit panel
of the toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-4. (And yes, that’s my close personal
friend James Brown . . . he likes my soulful ’64 Cadillac two-door. Her name is
Princess Grace, and she’s driven only on weekends.)

The editing tools include
✦Crop: This lets you trim off any unwanted edges of the photo and focus
on the photo’s subject.
✦Enhance: This is a one-click solution that automatically adjusts the
color and contrast of the image.
✦Red-Eye: No more vampires! Remove the evil-looking red-eye phenome-
non from your photos.
✦Retouch: Remove minor imperfections in photographs by blending them
into the surrounding area.
✦B & W (black and white): For that vintage look, you can also convert
color pictures to black and white.
✦Sepia: Another antique look, this time in shades of copper and brown.
✦Adjust: These controls allow you to fix photos that are too dark, too
light, or washed-out.
✦Done: Click this button when you’re done editing, and iPhoto saves your
changes and returns you to the thumbnail view.
✦Navigation arrows: Click these to advance to the previous or next image.
Constrain and crop
Sometimes your photos have additional clutter around the edges. To get rid
of this problem with traditional photographs, you’d resort to a pair of scis-
sors to cut off the unwanted portion of the image. Professional photogra-
phers call this cropping. Digital image-editing software packages (including
iPhoto) have borrowed this term. The Crop feature of iPhoto gives you the
ability to remove unwanted stuff from around the edges of your otherwise
perfect photographs, like the strange guy who blundered into the corner of
your perfect Grand Canyon composition.
To crop a photo, you must first select what portion of the image that you
want to keep by clicking and dragging on the image in the Viewer. As you
drag, a rectangle appears indicating what part of the image you want to
keep, as shown in Figure 3-5. Everything outside of this rectangle will disap-
pear after a crop operation. (The selection rectangle can be dragged and
resized if necessary.)
After you select the portion that you want to remain, click the Crop button in
the Edit panel to remove the rest. If you would like to constrain your selection
to a specific size, select that size from the Constrain pop-up menu to the left
of the Crop button. This lets you resize a photograph according to a preset
size. (For example, certain aspect ratios are better for certain media — a 4 x 3
ratio looks best in an iDVD project or a bound book, whereas a 4 x 6 is per-
fectly proportioned for printing a postcard.)

Taking Care of Business: Basic Editing
310
“Hey, I didn’t want that to happen!” (Yep, time to mention Undo again.) You
can always remove any editing change you’ve just made to an image; just
press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo. iPhoto offers a multiple Undo function, so
you can press Ô+Z multiple times to backtrack through your changes.
Enhance
Things can’t get much easier than this. If the colors in your image look
drab, you can click the Enhance button to automatically increase (or
decrease) the color saturation and automatically improve the contrast
within the photo. (Note that this is different from the manual contrast con-
trol that I discuss later.) Everything’s done for you, so there are no settings
to change. To compare the even fresher-smelling photo with the earlier
version, press the Control key, and you’ll see the un-enhanced image.
When you release the Control key, the enhancement is applied again, so
you can compare the results.
You can click Enhance more than once to continue your attempts to improve
the image, but sooner or later, iPhoto can make no additional adjustments.
The Enhance button only works when no part of an image has been selected
with the rectangle (that way, the controls will affect the entire image). If you
need to deselect a portion of the photo, just click anywhere in the image out-
side the selected area, and the selection rectangle disappears like beer at a
football game.

Retouch
Do you suffer from spots or specks in an otherwise-perfect image? Click the
Retouch button, and the cursor turns into a crosshair; click and drag the
cursor across the imperfection in short movements to remove it. Again, you
can hold down and release the Control key to compare the retouched ver-
sion of the image with the fixed photo.
Naturally, Retouch won’t add detail to an image, so it won’t add highlights to
your girlfriend’s hair or fix the dented fender on your Harley — instead, it’s
best used to clean up specks within a solid band of color, like a photo of a
sunset. I find Retouch especially handy with pictures that I’ve scanned from
slides and existing photographs.
Adjust
Shooting photographs that look perfect is a tough task, and sometimes
things don’t work out the way that you plan. If your images turn out too dark
or light, iPhoto can help you clean up after the fact. To adjust the brightness
and contrast of an image, simply move the Brightness/Contrast sliders until
the image looks the way that you want. You’ll also find:
✦Color adjustment sliders on the Adjust dialog for fixing tint, tempera-
ture, and saturation problems
✦A straighten slider that’s boffo for straightening images that are slightly
off-kilter
✦A sharpness slider that increases the definition of borders and edges in
your image
✦Exposure and histogram sliders that allow you to fine-tune the color
and exposure range for an image
Red-eye removal
Have you ever picked up your photographs from the local photo developer
only to discover that the subjects in your photographs all look like rather
unsettling red-eyed zombies? Red-eye is a phenomenon that occurs when the
camera captures light reflecting off the retinas of eyeballs. This problem isn’t
limited only to human eyes, either. Even Spot, your loving canine pal, can
have that “Demon Doggy” possessed look! To help exorcise these red-eye
problems from your photographs, iPhoto gives you a Red-Eye filter.
To remove red-eye problems in your photographs, click the Red-Eye button
and then click in the center of each offending eyeball. Your red-eye problem
disappears in an instant. When you’re done eradicating red-eye, click the
Red-Eye button again.

Black and white, or sepia
In the old days, photographers had to cart around several rolls of film if they
wanted to shoot in color, black and white, and sepia. These days, you can
simply shoot in color because iPhoto can do the black-and-white or sepia
conversion for you. It’s really simple, too! Just click the B & W button to con-
vert an image from color to shades of gray, or click Sepia to convert the
image to shades of brown and copper.
If you change your mind and want to revert to a color image, choose Edit➪
Undo to see colors again. For an interesting artistic effect, you can select just
a portion of a photo with the Crop tool and click the B & W or the Sepia
button to work your antique magic on just the selected area.
Don’t forget to rotate!
Although it’s not technically an Edit mode feature, rotation is a sort of edit, so I
discuss it here. This feature is useful for viewing those images where you held
the camera sideways to fit that tall building into the viewfinder. To rotate an
image, simply click the Rotate button at the left-hand side of the Toolbar. The
default rotation is in a counter-clockwise direction. Hold the Option key while
you click the rotate button to rotate in a clockwise direction.
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
Computerized photo albums are fun and all, but sometimes people long for
the real photo albums of the past. They like to turn pages, put it on the shelf,
and view it without a computer screen. For those folks, iPhoto offers a way to
create and print your own professional-quality photo album. Use iPhoto to
create a Photo Album (the digital kind), tweak its formatting until you’re satis-
fied, and then transmit your finished product via the Internet to a vendor who
will print, bind, and send you a copy of your finished album, for a small fee, of
course. At the time of this writing, costs ranged from a small soft-cover book
with 20 pages for around $4 to a large hard-cover album with 20 pages for
about $30.
Here’s how to create your own bound work of art:
1. Create a new Photo Album in iPhoto by choosing File➪New Album or
clicking the + button at the left edge of the Toolbar.
The name of the album is editable, so you can name it to your liking.
2. Click the Photo Library icon at the left side of the iPhoto interface
and drag your favorite photos into the new Photo Album.
These are the images that appear in your bound photo album.

When preparing a photo album that will be printed on paper, use the
highest quality images available. It takes higher-resolution images to
look good on paper (as compared with your Mac’s monitor).
3. After you complete the preparation of your Photo Album in iPhoto,
select that Photo Album in the Source list by clicking it.
The Source list appears on the left side of the iPhoto interface.
4. Click the Book button on the Toolbar.
5. iPhoto prompts you to select the size of the book and a theme.
The choices you make here determine the number of pages and layout
scheme, as well as the background graphics for each page. Note that you
can also choose double-sided pages for the larger books.
6. Click Choose Theme.
iPhoto displays a dialog asking whether you want to layout your photos
manually or allow iPhoto to do everything automatically. (The remain-
der of these steps show the manual process.)
7. Click Manually.
In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the
page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail strip
(looks like a page with a turned-down corner) to display thumbnails of
each page in your book. To return to the album image strip, click the
Photos button under the Page button.
8. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of
any page from one location to another in the strip.
9. In the Book panel below the toolbar, you can adjust a variety of set-
tings for the final book, including the book’s theme, page numbers,
and comments.
Besides photos, you can also add text to the pages of your photo album.
(Nothing on the order of Stephen King or Tom Clancy — more like cap-
tions with short descriptions.) Selecting Show Guides draws faint blue
boxes in the Viewer that show where you can add text.
10. Click any one of the text boxes and begin typing to add text to that
page.
When you’re satisfied with the results of the photo book, it’s time to
publish it.

11. Click the Buy Book button.
In a series of dialogs that appear, iPhoto guides you through the final
steps to order a bound book. (Don’t forget your credit card.)
A fast connection to the Internet like cable or DSL is very handy for this
process. The images that you must submit are too large for a slow dialup
connection.
Remember, you can also save that book as a PDF file and print it later
(either on your own inkjet printer, or a nicer one at the copy shop 
downtown)!
Sharing Photos with Friends and Family
Besides creating a photo book, iPhoto offers many other ways for you to
share your photos. Click the Share menu to see the possibilities (some are
also available from the toolbar).
Here are the different ways that you can share your photos with iPhoto:
✦Print: Don’t forget about your computer’s printer. It’s mundane, I know,
but you can print photographs from iPhoto with your inkjet or laser
printer.
✦Slideshow: Display a slideshow presentation of your photos in iPhoto,
complete with background music.
✦Email: Send photos to your friends via e-mail. You’ll need an active
Internet connection. (Go figure, indeed.) iPhoto will launch your default
e-mail client when you’re ready to send your photographs.
✦Order Prints: Order photographic quality prints of your favorite images.
Kodak prints the photographs for you and will ship them wherever you
want them to go.
✦Book: Allows you to order a bound book, as I demonstrate in the previ-
ous section.
✦HomePage: Publish your photos on your .Mac Web site.
✦.Mac Slides: Publish your photos as a slide show on your iDisk, where
others with .Mac accounts can view it.
✦Desktop: Change your Desktop picture to one of your iPhoto images.
✦Burn: Leads you through the process of recording your images on a
blank CD or DVD.

sionals use. From basic editing to audio and video effects, iMovie HD has
everything that you need to get started creating high-quality movies.
The iMovie HD Window
To launch iMovie HD, either navigate to the Application folder and double-
click the iMovie HD icon or click the iMovie HD icon that’s hanging out on
the Dock. When you first launch iMovie HD, the application displays a top-
level dialog from which you can choose to create a new iMovie HD project,
open an existing project, or make a Magic iMovie. For now, just click Create
a New Project, type a name for your project, and click Create.
You’ll notice that the window fills most of the screen, even when it’s resized
as small as possible (as shown in Figure 4-1). In fact, you can’t run iMovie
HD at resolutions less than 1024 x 768.

The iMovie HD Window
316
This seemingly rude behavior is actually a requirement. If you think about it,
creating and editing a movie requires a lot of elbow room (both on your mon-
itor and on your hard drive). To hide the iMovie HD window, press either
Ô+H or Ô+Tab to switch to other applications that are running. (You can
also use the Exposé key, F9.)
You’ll notice that the interface consists of three main parts:
✦Monitor: The Monitor is the big, black, square viewer where you watch
movies.
✦Tool palette: The iMovie Tool palette appears on the right side of the
iMovie HD window. The palette offers one-click access to an array of
movie-building tools.
Just above the Tool palette is the Clips pane. The contents of the Clips
pane vary, depending on which of the Tool palette buttons you’ve
selected. Clicking the Clips button displays the Clips pane, for example,
which is where iMovie HD stores your movie clips for use in full-length
movies that you create. A click on Photos allows you to add still images
from your iPhoto library (as demonstrated by the versatile Figure 4-1).
Clicking the Audio button whisks you to a pane with audio files in it.
iMovie stores your audio clips here, which you can also use in any
movie that you create.

The Titles, Trans (transitions), and Effects tools let you twist, turn, and
label your movies like the pros do. Finally, the iDVD button displays the
Chapter List — it’s used with iDVD 5, where you can build a DVD movie
with your finished masterpiece.
✦Viewers: The viewers are where you compose your movie masterpiece.
The two main tabs here are the Clips viewer and the Timeline viewer. I
cover these in more detail later.
The Powers of Three
The minimalist approach of iMovie HD provides power with simplicity
(something that the average Joe like you and I can appreciate). Instead of
the nested windows and cryptic film jargon of traditional movie-editing
packages — which also, by the way, tend to cost hundreds or thousands of
dollars a pop — iMovie HD reduces the clutter to three elements. Use this
trio of tools, and you’ll be on your way to movie-making bliss.
Monitor
The Monitor is the largest of all the iMovie HD window elements — it func-
tions just like the video monitor and control deck that a traditional film
editor uses. You can think of it as iMovie HD’s screen, where you view clips
and preview your movie while you edit it. (Check it out in Figure 4-2.) When
you launch iMovie for the first time, the Monitor appears black, indicating
that you haven’t created a movie yet. (Apple is, if anything, eminently sensi-
ble.) On subsequent launches of iMovie HD, it displays the most recent
movie project.
Nestled directly beneath the iMovie Monitor are the playback controls (see
Figure 4-2). Resembling buttons on a conventional DVD player, the iMovie HD
playback controls let you play, stop, and return to the beginning of movies
that display in the Monitor.
In addition to the buttons that control playback, the Monitor sports other
important controls. The scrubber bar contains the playback head, which tells
you visually where you are in the movie. The playback head is a blue triangle
positioned directly below the Monitor. While your movie plays, the playback
head moves to indicate the current location of playback. The playback head
isn’t just a visual indicator, though: It also has an important function. You
can also click and drag the playback head to move forward or back in the
current movie.
All the remaining Monitor button controls affect the playback head’s posi-
tion with one click. Table 4-1 lists the various playback controls and how
they affect the playback head’s position.

Palette
The palette occupies the rightmost portion of the iMovie HD window and
offers a complete set of tools for creating movies. Divided into seven sec-
tions, the palette houses the building blocks that you need to construct
your cinematic masterpiece as well as your connection to iDVD. (Refer to
Figure 4-1.)
Throughout the creation process, you’ll use the tools located in the palette
to build the content of your movie. Table 4-2 describes the role that each
palette plays in the movie-making process.

Viewers
The final stops on the iMovie window tour are the viewers. Located at the
bottom of the screen, your trusty viewers are the heart of editing operations
in iMovie, where you add audio and video clips to construct the perfect
movie. As shown in Figure 4-3, they offer a visual representation of the order
in which the various clips appear in a movie.
As you can see in Figure 4-3, the viewer interface has two modes:
✦Clip viewer: Displays the sequence of video clips in a movie — this is
the mode shown in Figure 4-3.
✦Timeline viewer: Displays the duration and juxtaposition of the various
audio and video clips in a movie. (I think it’s safe to say that’s the only
appearance of the word juxtaposition in this particular tome.)

The Movie-Making Process

The Movie-Making Process
After you’re on friendly terms with the three main sections of the iMovie HD
window, follow the following simple six-step process to create professional
looking movies in minutes. I go into more detail about each of these steps in
the following sections.
Or, if you need to quickly create a movie, see the upcoming section, “Creating
on-the-fly with Magic iMovie.”
Making an iMovie the traditional way
Have you got ample time to produce your movie? If there’s no imminent dead-
line, you can follow the hallowed, age-old method of hand-crafting your movie,
choosing settings manually, and adding clips, audio, effects, and transitions
(as in previous versions of iMovie). To create a movie manually, follow these
steps:

The Movie-Making Process
321
1. Import and edit your movie footage.
The first step in creating a movie is to import movie clips into iMovie
HD, either from your digital video camcorder or from video clips already
on your hard drive. You will use these clips to construct a full-length
movie.
2. Add clips from the Clips pane to the Timeline.
After you prepare your movie clips, you can add them to the movie. By
using drag-and-drop, it takes only a few seconds to add the movie seg-
ments found in the Clips pane to your full-length movie.
3. Apply transitions, effects, photos, and text to the movie.
With your movie clips in place, it’s a snap to enhance them with visual
effects and transitions. You might also want to spice up the movie with
titles and credits.
4. Import or record audio clips.
Great movies look even better when accompanied by great audio. You
can import audio into iMovie HD from your iTunes audio files, audio files
you’ve created with GarageBand, audio CDs, your iTunes playlists, or
even what you’ve recorded yourself with a microphone.
5. Add audio from the Audio pane to the Timeline.
Drag audio clips from the Audio pane to the Timeline to arrange your
movie’s soundtrack. (And yes, you documentary fans will find it easy to
add narration.)
6. Preview, build, and burn the final product.
After you build the next Gone with the Windows — sorry, couldn’t help
that one — iMovie HD makes it a snap to preview your creation. Then
it’s just a few clicks before your project becomes a movie. iMovie helps
you distribute your completed movie as well: You can burn it to a
CD-ROM, import it into iDVD for use on a movie DVD, or export it into
QuickTime for online distribution.
The remainder of this chapter guides you through the details of these steps.
Before you know it, you’ll be showing that upstart Spielberg a thing or two
without setting foot out of your home.
Creating on-the-fly with Magic iMovie
The arrival of iMovie HD includes a new feature, called Magic iMovie, that lit-
erally reduces all the six standard steps I described to a single dialog and a
Create button. Magic iMovie is perfect for those times when speed is of the
essence: producing a wedding video immediately after the ceremony, for
example, or a video of a school field trip that your teacher can show within
minutes of your return to the classroom.

Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
322
iMovie HD produces the movie automatically, using the movie title you pro-
vide, the transition you specify between clips, and the audio soundtrack of
your choice. (Naturally, you won’t get the chance to be Cecil B. deMille with
a Magic iMovie project, but he was never known for the speed of his film-
making, anyway.) You can optionally choose to send the completed movie
directly to iDVD, where you can even use OneStep DVD to create a DVD-
video disc automatically! (I swear, if it were any more automatic, your Mac
wouldn’t need you at all. Of course, with AppleScript, your presence can be
eliminated, anyway.)
Here’s how to create a Magic iMovie.
1. Plug in your digital video (DV) camcorder, turn it on, and set it to VCR
(or VTR) mode.
2. Connect your DV camcorder to your Mac using a FireWire cable.
3. Launch iMovie HD, and then click the Make a Magic iMovie button on
the opening dialog.
If the dialog doesn’t appear because you were working on a film, choose
File➪Make a Magic iMovie.
iMovie HD prompts you for a project name and location as it normally
would.
4. When you see the Magic iMovie dialog, type a name for your movie in
the Movie Title box.
5. Mark the Use Transitions check box and choose the transition you
want (from the drop-down list box) to insert between clips.
6. (Optional) Add a soundtrack by enabling the Play a Music Soundtrack
check box.
To choose the song you want to use, click the Choose Music button to
browse your iTunes music library or to select an audio CD that you’ve
loaded.
7. (Optional) Mark the Send to iDVD check box to send your completed
project for later use in iDVD (which Tiger also launches automatically).
8. Click Create, sit back, and relax!
Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
The first step when creating a movie is to add video clips to the Clips pane.
These clips usually form the bulk of the video that you use in the completed
movie. iMovie HD is flexible in that it permits you to import video clips from
more than one source:

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic with
iMovie HD
Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
323
✦Import from a digital video camcorder: Connect a DV camcorder to
your Macintosh to transfer video.
✦Import from files: Import any DV clip (including high-definition [HD]
format) directly from your hard drive. (You can tell a DV clip by its HD
DV or DV file type, as shown in the Finder’s Info dialog.)
If your favorite movie clip isn’t in DV Stream format, you can export it
from QuickTime Pro. Then import it into iMovie. See Book III, Chapter 7
for more on QuickTime Pro.
After you import your video, you can perform a variety of editing functions
on the clip: You can edit clips together to tell a story; edit mistakes or bad
footage; apply audio, transitions, and effects; and even add titles, for that
cinematic touch.
Adding clips from media files
iMovie HD allows you to import many different kinds of media files. From
graphics to video to audio files, iMovie HD has you covered. Table 4-3 lists
the most common file formats that iMovie HD can import into your project.
Table 4-3
File Types That iMovie Understands
File Type
What It’s Used For
AAC
Compressed audio
AIFF
Audio from an audio CD
MP3
Compressed audio
JPEG
Standard for still images from the Web, scanners, or a digital
camera
GIF
Standard for still images from the Web, scanners, or a digital
camera
PSD
Images from Photoshop
HD DV
High-definition (widescreen) digital video
MPEG-4
Digital video in MPEG format
DV
Standard digital video (including the feed from your iSight
camera)
The file type dictates what happens when you import that file. For example,
when you import an image or video file, the file goes directly into the Clips
pane. In contrast, importing an audio file automatically places it in the movie
at the audio pointer’s current location. To import an audio or video file,
choose File➪Import. Select a file to import in the Open dialog and click OK.
The imported file appears in the Clips pane or the Audio pane, depending on
the file type.

Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
324
Still images can also be parked on the Clips pane — a holdover from earlier
versions of iPhoto, where pictures were handled like static video clips.
Therefore, photographs can actually be added to your movie from either the
Clips pane (for imported photos) or the Photos pane (for pictures from your
iPhoto collection).
Adding clips from your camcorder
Adding clips from your DV camcorder or iSight camera is just as simple as
playing a movie. To retrieve video from your camcorder, do the following:
1. With a FireWire cable, connect a FireWire-compatible camera to your
Macintosh and set it to VTR (or Playback) mode.
If your camera is not FireWire-compatible, you should be able to buy an
adapter. Setting your camera to VTR mode allows remote control of the
camcorder by iMovie. If you’re not sure how to set VTR mode on your
camera, consult its manual.
2. In iMovie, slide the DV Camera/Edit Mode switch to the Camera posi-
tion, which is labeled with a miniature camcorder icon (refer to
Figure 4-2).
This initiates the camera capture mode. When you set this mode, an
Import button appears above the Play button.
3. Find the video.
Click the Monitor’s playback buttons to locate the video on your cam-
corder that you wish to import, fast-forwarding or rewinding until you
find the correct footage, watching your progress in the Monitor. When
you find the video, stop the playback and position the playback head a
few seconds prior to the place where the desired video begins. When
you’re ready, click the Play button again.
4. When the video that you want to capture appears in the Monitor, click
the Import button to begin transferring that video from the camcorder
to your Macintosh.
5. Stop the video.
Click the Import button again to stop the video transfer.
Imported video from a camcorder transfer appears in the Clips pane.
Importing multiple clips from your camcorder results in multiple separate
clips in iMovie!
Editing video clips
iMovie HD gives you several different ways to edit your video clips. You can
copy, trim, and crop your video clips to your heart’s content; and if you
mess up along the way, an instant fix is but a click away.

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic with
iMovie HD
Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
325
Copying video clips
Sometimes you’ll want to work on multiple copies of the same video clip. This
gives you the ability to try out different edits on the same piece of footage
without altering the original. To duplicate a video clip, do the following:
1. Select a clip in the Clips pane.
The selected clip turns blue.
2. Press Ô+C or choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Press Ô+V or choose Edit➪Paste.
A new copy of the video clip appears in the Clips pane.
Of course, you can also follow the Macintosh convention of Option-dragging
a clip from its cell on the pane to an empty cell or to the Timeline. Doing so
makes a copy wherever you release the mouse.
Who needs a camcorder?
If you’re a serious couch potato — one of those
folks who are permanently affixed to their living
room furniture, constantly awaiting this TV
show or that one — rejoice! Hardware devices
are on the market that can capture your favorite
programs as digital video, providing you with yet
another source of iMovie HD video clips. (The
signal can come from a cable-ready TV or from
a standard analog video source like a VCR.)
After you create a video clip by using one of
these video capture devices, you can then
import the clip into iMovie HD.
For example, the EyeTV unit from Elgato Systems
is practically a complete solution for digitizing
analog video: It comes with a built-in, cable-
ready TV tuner and a hardware MPEG encoder
(the hardware that can create a DV stream from
analog video). For around $200, EyeTV can pro-
vide the somewhat mundane convenience of
watching TV on your Mac’s monitor, along with
the ability to “pause” a live TV show . . . but for
me, the real treat is creating digital video from
all those old VHS family reunion videos that are
currently collecting dust in your closet. EyeTV is
a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device, so it works
with just about any Mac that can run Mac OS X.
Each hour of video takes up about 650MB of
hard drive space, so a high-capacity 200GB
FireWire hard drive suddenly looks most attrac-
tive indeed.
For the complete details on EyeTV, visit the
Elgato Software Web site at www.elgato.
com. And don’t forget to honor the copyrights
on the material you capture from TV broad-
casts, commercial video tapes, and DVDs —
consult a lawyer if you plan on distributing any
movies that include copyrighted material.

Basic Composition the iMovie Way
326
Cropping, splitting, and trimming video clips
Cropping, splitting, and trimming are three important editing functions that
iMovie HD affords you. Here’s the skinny on these functions:
✦Crop: Deletes everything from the clip except a selected region
✦Split: Breaks a single clip into multiple clips
✦Trim: Deletes a selected region from the clip
To perform any of these functions, you must first select a region of a clip.
Choose a clip in the Clips pane. This causes the clip to appear in the
Monitor. Position the playback head at the beginning of the region that you
wish to select. Then Shift-click anywhere on the scrubber bar to the right of
the starting point. (iMovie HD places markers at the edges of the selection,
and you can further adjust the selection by dragging them.) A region turns
yellow when you select it. After you select a region, perform the editing
operation.
✦Crop: Choose Edit➪Crop. Everything but the selected region disappears.
✦Split: Choose Edit➪Split Video Clip at Playhead. The clip instantly splits
into two clips.
✦Trim: Choose Edit➪Clear. The selected region disappears. (If you have a
section of video selected in the middle of a larger clip, two clips will
remain: one with the video before the selection, and one with the video
after the selection.)
Naming video clips
As your movie project grows, you’ll want to take care to label your clips. This
helps to remind you when you return to the project later. It’s also a godsend
when you begin working on multiple copies of the same clip. Otherwise, you
have no easy way to differentiate two identical clips because they appear the
same in the Clips pane.
To edit the name of a clip, click the text of the clip name near the clip’s bottom
edge. When the text appears in a text edit box, type a new name for the clip;
then press Return to brand the clip with the new name, pardner. (You can also
change the clip name from the Get Info dialog by pressing Ô+I.)
Basic Composition the iMovie Way
After you import and edit some video clips, it’s finally time to begin creating
a movie. Adding video to your movie is a simple drag-and-drop operation.

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic with
iMovie HD
Transitions for the Masses
327
Adding clips to a movie
Before you add clips to your movie, select the desired viewer tab. The Clip
viewer displays clips in sequential order, with each clip occupying the same
amount of space in the Timeline. The Timeline viewer displays clips with
lengths that are relative to their duration. For example, a 30-second clip will
appear as half the length of a 60-second clip when you view clips in the
Timeline viewer.
To add a clip to your movie, drag it from the Clips pane to the desired loca-
tion in the Timeline. Constructing a movie is just a matter of repeating this
step with the various clips that you want to add to your movie.
Removing clips from a movie
Eventually you’ll add a clip that you soon decide doesn’t belong in your
movie; to delete a clip from a movie, select the clip in the Timeline and press
Delete. The clip disappears, and any clips that follow the deleted selection
slide to the left to fill the void.
iMovie HD has its own Trash, which appears at the bottom of the application
window — you can drag unwanted items from the pane or from the viewers
and drop them on top of this icon to delete them. You can empty the iMovie
HD Trash at any time by choosing File➪Empty Trash.
If you mistakenly remove a clip that you intended on keeping, press Ô+Z or
choose Edit➪Undo to cancel the delete operation.
Rearranging clips in a movie
If you decide at some point that certain clips are in the wrong order, it’s a
cinch to change. Simply drag a clip in the Clip viewer. Release the mouse
when the clip reaches the desired destination; clips in the Timeline will
move apart to make room for the nomadic clip.
Transitions for the Masses
Stringing together a bunch of video clips to make a movie is cool stuff, but
that’s only a small fraction of what iMovie HD can do. Beyond simple editing,
iMovie HD offers a set of video transitions for you to use in your movies.
Transitions are video effects that perform their magic at the point where two
clips connect. They help smooth out the joint between the two clips. If
you’re a television viewer, you see transitions all the time — any time that
the screen fades to or from black, you’re seeing a transition in action.
(Remember the cool swirling bat from the old Batman TV series?)
iMovie HD gives you a wide variety of transitions from which to choose.
These can be displayed by clicking the Trans (transitions) button in the Tool
palette, as shown in Figure 4-4.

Transitions for the Masses
328
Clicking any of the transitions in the Transitions pane causes a brief preview
of the effect to automatically play in the preview window at the top of the
pane. You can vary the duration of the transition with the Speed slider. The
list of available transitions provided free with iMovie HD is short, but it
covers most of the basic movie needs:
✦Billow: The view from the first clip shrinks into a grid of circles to reveal
the next clip.
✦Circle Closing: Video shrinks with a circular viewport (like a lens shut-
ter) to the next clip.
✦Circle Opening: Video expands with a circular viewport to the next clip.
✦Cross Dissolve: Video dissolves from one clip to the next.
✦Fade In: Video fades in from black.
✦Fade Out: Video fades out to black.
✦Overlap: Video fades from one clip to another.
✦Push: Video slides to an edge of the screen over time. Select which edge
by clicking the directional arrows that appear when you select the Push
transition.
✦Radial: Video wipes in a circular motion around the center, like a radar
screen.

329
✦Ripple: The video from the next clip wipes in a liquid motion across the
preceding clip.
✦Scale Down: Video shrinks over time to reveal a clip behind it.
✦Twirl: The first clip spins and shrinks into the center of the screen,
while the next clip twirls and expands to fill the frame.
✦Warp Out: Video wipes from the center outward to the next clip.
✦Wash In: Video fades in from white.
✦Wash Out: Video fades out to white.
For those who just can’t get enough, Apple offers a number of additional
transitions, effects, and audio clips for free at www.apple.com/imovie. You
can also purchase many transitions and special effects as add-on packages
from third-party developers.
To add a transition to your movie, drag the desired transition from the
Transitions pane to the Timeline. A transition merges two clips together, so
you’ll want to drop the transition in an appropriate location — in between
two clips. If you change any settings of a transition, make sure to click the
Update button. It refreshes the preview of that transition in your movie.
Transitions are a wonderfully subtle way to improve the look of your movie.
Use them judiciously to emulate professional movie and television editing.
(Too many transitions within a movie can distract your audience from your
message — unless, of course, you’re filming an episode of Laugh-In 2005.) To
give you a feel for how the pros do it, pay attention when you watch televi-
sion or movies and focus on the transitions. Sometimes the simplest transi-
tion can have a dramatic effect on a movie.
Even Gone with the Wind Had Titles
Besides transitions, professional movies and videos have text, and lots of it;
from the title at the beginning of a movie to the litany of names that scroll by
in the credits after the movie, movie editing clearly demands sophisticated
text-editing abilities. With over a dozen title styles to choose from, iMovie
HD can handle most text tasks that you throw at it.
The Titles pane is where you can find the text features of iMovie HD. Figure
4-5 shows you the basic layout of the Titles pane.
The Titles pane changes to accommodate different amounts of text depend-
ing on which title style you choose. Otherwise, the controls for the title
styles are identical for each effect. Table 4-4 lists the settings and functions
that are common to all title styles.

After you successfully adapt the text style to match your needs, you can add
it to a movie by dragging the title style from the list to the Timeline. When
you do, the title appears in the Timeline as a movie segment.
Like deleting a movie clip, removing a title from your movie requires a click
of the mouse and one key press. Click the title in the Timeline to select it and
then press Delete to remove it from the movie. Should you delete a title acci-
dentally, press Ô+Z to undo the operation.
What Good Is a Movie without Special Effects?
Although iMovie HD can produce some nice transitions and titles, it doesn’t
stop there. It also comes stocked with a handful of cool video effects for you
to use in your movies.

Tiles your clip into four smaller copies, with each taking up a
quarter of the screen.
Sepia Tone
Adds a sepia-colored tint on your movie; can give movies rustic,
old-fashioned, or romantic moods.
Sharpen
Defines edges in a blurry movie; makes everything look more
crisp.
Soft Focus
Makes a movie blurry; fun for I-lost-my-eyeglasses shots.
Rain
Simulates raindrops — anyone for a downpour?
Adding Effects to a movie
To work with Effects in your movies, follow these five easy steps:
1. In the Timeline, click a movie clip.
The clip changes to a blue color to indicate that you selected it 
successfully.
2. Open the Effects pane by clicking the Effects button in the Tool
palette and then select an effect.
In the Effects pane, choose an effect from the list of available effects by
clicking the effect’s name.
3. Adjust the effect.
From the effect’s controls, tweak its settings to suit your needs. The
Effect In and Effect Out sliders let you phase in an effect a certain

amount of time from the beginning of the clip and then phase it out
before it ends. While you adjust the effect’s parameters, the results
appear in the miniature preview window at the top of the Effects pane.
4. Preview the effect at full size.
After you choose and adjust the effect to your liking, you might want to
see what it will look like in action. Click the Preview button to see a pre-
view of the effect in the Monitor.
5. Apply the effect.
If you’re happy with the results of the effects preview, it’s easy to perma-
nently add it to the movie clip by clicking the Apply button.
When you apply an effect to a movie clip, iMovie HD begins building the
movie effect — the faster your Mac is and the more memory you have, the
faster the effect is finished. To track the progress of an effect being built,
iMovie HD displays a small red line in the movie clip found in the Timeline.
While the build progresses, this red line grows until it spans the entire length
of the clip. If you try to preview the clip before it’s built, you’ll still be able to
view it but at a lower quality. This temporary preview permits you to view
the effect while iMovie HD builds the real effect.
Hey, There’s a Photo in My Video!
Of course, not everything has to move around like Fred Astaire within your
frame. You can use still images to begin your film, add a background, or slap
an old-fashioned Intermission placard right in the middle of your movie! In
fact, iMovie HD includes a cool panning feature called the Ken Burns Effect,
which is named after the man responsible for all those great documentaries
on public television: The camera slowly pans and zooms across a static pho-
tograph, bringing motion to your images (and suddenly adding interest to
that snapshot of Uncle Milton at the Grand Canyon).
Click the Photos button in the Tool palette to display the Photos pane shown
in Figure 4-7. It operates much like the Clips pane — just click and drag an
image from the pane to the Timeline or Clip viewer. To display other images
from your iPhoto Library (or any of your iPhoto albums), click the drop-
down list box and then click the desired album.
Now for the Ken Burns Effect — man, that really sounds like an avant-garde
jazz group, doesn’t it? Anyway, mark the Ken Burns Effect check box to
enable it. You can set the duration of the pan and the total zoom throughout
the effect. Click the Reverse button to reverse the pan and zoom out instead.
Unlike the other preview windows in iMovie HD, you can click and drag the
image in the preview window to set the starting and finishing points for the
Ken Burns Effect.

Working with Sound
334
Working with Sound
In addition to video and graphics, iMovie HD is adept at working with sound.
With iMovie HD, you can use your favorite audio files, music CDs, and micro-
phone to create professional-sounding soundtracks. (Sorry, John Williams is
not included.)
Adding sound to a movie
All audio that you add to a movie resides in one of the two audio tracks in
the Timeline. The audio tracks are visible only in the Timeline viewer tab.
To begin working with audio in iMovie HD, open the Audio pane by clicking
the Audio button in the Tool palette. Note that the Audio pane is split into
the Audio Library and Voice Recorder sections (which has an input level
meter for your microphone and a record button).
Using the built-in sound effects
To get you started with audio in your movies, iMovie gives you a set of prere-
corded sound effects, as shown in Figure 4-8. These make great background
noises to enhance your movies. To preview any one of the sounds, click the
drop-down list at the top of the pane, click iMovie Sound Effects, and then
double-click the desired sound.

To add the sound to your movie, drag the sound effect from the Audio pane
and drop it on the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. When you do, the
audio clip appears in one of the audio tracks for the movie. Feel free to move
the sound effect clip anywhere in the track by dragging it, or change the
length of the effect by clicking the arrows at the ends of the clip and drag-
ging them. This gives you precise control over when the sound plays so that
you can synchronize it with video events.
Adding your own sound effects
If you’d like to add your own sound effects to the Audio pane, you need to do
a little work in the Finder. Drag any audio file recognized by iTunes (includ-
ing your favorite AIFF, AAC, or MP3 files) in the Finder to your Sound Effects
folder (which is located in your home folder under Library➪iMovie➪Sound
Effects).
Restart iMovie HD to see your new sound effects in the Audio pane. With a
quick drag, you can add the new audio files to your movie.
Recording voice-overs for your movie
Sometimes you might want to narrate a segment of your movie rather than
rely on sound effect files. Fortunately, iMovie HD gives you the ability to do
just that. From the Voice Recorder section of the Audio pane, you can record
Figure 4-8:
The Sound

your voice and add it to the audio track of your movie. What’s more, you can
record your voice as you watch the movie playing in real-time. This allows
you to perfectly synchronize any narration you speak with the video onscreen.
(Somebody deserves a raise in Cupertino!)
To record your voice, perform the following steps:
1. Position the playback head at the place in your movie where you’d
like to begin recording narration.
The playback head tells you where you are in the movie. You can posi-
tion the playback head in either the Monitor or the Timeline viewer.
2. Open the Audio pane by clicking the Audio button.
3. (Optional) On the Monitor playback controls, click Play.
By clicking Play, you are able to view the video in your movie. By watch-
ing the video while you narrate, you can synchronize your speech to the
video track. This step is optional because you don’t have to play a
movie while recording a narration. Slower Macs might have trouble play-
ing and recording audio at the same time.
4. Back in the Audio pane, click the Record Voice button to begin
recording.
When you speak, the meter in the Audio pane helps you monitor the
incoming volume level.
5. Click Stop in the Audio pane.
When you complete the recording process, iMovie HD displays the
newly recorded segment in the Timeline. Now you can manipulate the
audio in the Timeline just as you would any other movie or audio clip. If
you aren’t happy with the result, you can always press Delete to remove
the audio clip and return to Step 4.
Importing audio from a CD
Wondering about adding music from an audio CD? No problem! To import
clips from an audio CD, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD into your Mac’s CD drive.
2. Open the iMovie HD Audio pane.
3. Click the drop-down list box and click Audio CD.
If your Mac is connected to the Internet, the song titles appear in the
Audio pane. Without the connection, you see generic track titles, such
as Track 01 and Track 02.

4. Click whichever song you’d like to import into iMovie HD.
5. Drag it into your Timeline viewer.
When you’re finished importing a song from an audio CD, it appears in the
Timeline in one of the audio tracks.
Removing sound from a movie
To remove an audio clip from your movie, select it in the Timeline and press
Delete. Removing an audio clip does not have any effect on the position of
other audio clips. This ensures that your audio clips stay in sync with exist-
ing video clips.
You can also disable all audio for a track: Just mark the check box at the
right of the track to disable it. (This is a good way to temporarily mute the
track so you can concentrate on something else.) To vary the volume of an
audio or video track, press Ô+Shift+L to show the volume level lines. To
raise or lower the volume of a clip (for that great fade-in or fade-out), drag
the line up or down. iMovie HD adds points on the volume level lines to indi-
cate where you make changes.
Completing Your Cinematic Masterpiece
Are you done, Mr. Hitchcock? Congratulations, you’ve made it through the
movie-making process! You’ve shot, composed, and edited your own movie,
but now what? Like any good filmmaker, the goal of creating a movie is to
have people watch it — therefore, iMovie HD gives you more than one way
to share your movies.
✦Digital video camcorder: Transfer your completed movie back to the
camcorder and take it with you.
✦HomePage: Share your movie through your .Mac Web site.
✦QuickTime movies: Millions of Macs and PCs around the world have
QuickTime software. These computers can view iMovie HD movies, too!
The great part about QuickTime movies is that you can use them in a
variety of applications, from Web pages to PowerPoint presentations.
✦iDVD: iMovie can prepare your movies for use with iDVD — including
chapter markers, which I discuss shortly. The iDVD application lets you
create a DVD. Read more about iDVD in Book III, Chapter 5.
Each type of export has its specific purposes and uses — the medium that
you choose depends on your audience, video quality needs, and desired
format.

Exporting to a camcorder
To export your completed movie to a DV camcorder, choose File➪Share. In
the dialog that appears, choose Videocamera in the toolbar. iMovie HD pres-
ents you with settings for exporting to the camcorder. As the dialog warns
you, be sure that your camera is in VTR mode and has a writeable tape in it.
Exporting to QuickTime
QuickTime is a multimedia engine in use on millions of computers every-
where. Its popularity makes it a natural for many different uses:
✦CD-ROM video
✦Internet delivery
✦High-quality playback from hard drive or removable disk
To export your completed movie to a QuickTime file, choose File➪Share. In
the dialog that appears, choose QuickTime from the toolbar. iMovie HD pres-
ents you with settings for exporting to QuickTime. From the Compress
movie for drop-down list box, choose the option that best fits the intended
use of your movie.
Exporting to iDVD
If your movie is destined to be part of an iDVD project, click the iDVD button
(in the Tool palette) to display the iDVD pane. Click the Create iDVD Project
button, and iMovie HD will save your movie (if necessary) and automatically
launch iDVD with your movie as a new iDVD project. Life is good, don’t you
agree? (For a full discussion of iDVD, run — don’t walk — to Chapter 5 of
Book III.)
Here’s another neat function within the iDVD pane — you can choose to add
chapter markers in iMovie HD before you export it to iDVD. (In case you
haven’t used markers while watching DVD movies, they allow you to jump
immediately to certain points in the film. For example, each scene in a DVD
movie is likely to have a chapter marker assigned to it, so you can jump
directly to your favorite scenes.)
To add a chapter marker, move the playback head to the desired spot in the
Timeline viewer, click the Add Chapter button, and then enter a name for the
chapter marker in the list.

Chapter 5: Burn Those DVDs!
Using iDVD 5
In This Chapter
 Putting together your DVD Menu
 Adding media to a DVD
 Burning a DVD for your friends and family
A
number of years ago, I was witness to yet another proud moment in
Apple history: the arrival of a powerful DVD recorder in an affordable
computer. The SuperDrive was revolutionary because suddenly folks could
create and view their own professional-quality DVDs.
Today the tradition continues: Apple includes iDVD 5 free with today’s
SuperDrive-equipped Macs as part of iLife ’05. With iDVD, you can easily
create beautiful presentations with animation and interactive menus that
anyone can watch in a standard DVD player or computer DVD drive. And
that, friends and neighbors, is the quintessential definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you the basics of creating your first home-cooked
DVD movie — you’ll even have fun doing it!
What Am I Doing, Anyway?
Creating a DVD is a unique process: Combining talents in art, video, and
presentation, DVD authoring demands that you dabble in all these skills. At
its core, a DVD is simply a collection of digital video files. Unlike a CD-ROM
or videotape, however, a DVD also has a fancy presentation and navigation
system built into it. With the DVD authoring tools of iDVD, you can
✦Create a menu with buttons, text, animated zones, background music,
and images to enable viewers to navigate your DVD.
✦Add still and moving images to your DVD.
✦Burn your DVD to a disc for permanent storage and distribution to
friends, family, and co-workers.

Mastering Menus
340
Apple overcomes the complexity of DVD authoring with its powerful iDVD 5
software. Use it to create professional-looking menu systems to present your
videos and digital slideshows. Then, when you’re ready, a few clicks burn the
presentation, videos, and slideshows onto a DVD using your SuperDrive. In
fact, iDVD 5 will burn a disc only on a system that has a SuperDrive.
(Apologies to the CD-RW crowd.)
Use iDVD to reduce the process of manually creating a DVD to three simple
steps:
1. Customize the Menu.
The Menu of a DVD is the main screen that viewers use to navigate the
completed DVD. You can use one of the menus supplied by Apple, or
you can create your own.
2. Add media.
What’s a DVD without movies? Use drag-and-drop to fill your DVD with
movie files from iMovie, photographs from iPhoto, and music from
iTunes. (Read more on these in Chapter 4, Chapter 3, and Chapter 2 of
this mini-book, respectively.)
3. Preview and burn a DVD.
You can preview your DVD at any point during the design process. When
you’re satisfied with the results, slip a blank DVD-R in the drive and click
the mouse to burn a finished product.
I go into more detail on each of these steps throughout this chapter.
iDVD 5 includes a new feature called OneStep DVD, which makes the entire
process of creating a DVD virtually automatic — so much for three simple
steps I just listed. (Now those same three steps seem so . . . well, complex!)
However, you’ll lose the creative opportunity of choosing everything your-
self, so you might want to do things the manual way after all. I discuss
OneStep DVD later in this chapter.
Mastering Menus
As a Macintosh owner, you’re no doubt familiar with the term menu. When it
comes to DVD authoring, however, menu takes on a new meaning. Instead of
the traditional menus that display when you click toward the top of your
screen in Mac OS X, a DVD Menu is the name of the entire DVD screen that
your viewers will see, including all the buttons that you see.

When you launch the iDVD 5 application, you might immediately see the
opening application dialog shown in Figure 5-1. This appears if you didn’t
have a project file open the last time you closed iDVD. You can choose to
create a new project, open an existing project, or begin the OneStep DVD
process (which I describe later).
If you did have a project file open, iDVD loads it automatically, displaying a
DVD Menu like the one shown in Figure 5-2. Like that of any commercial DVD
movie, you’ll see this DVD Menu when you load the completed DVD in your
favorite DVD player.

Mastering Menus

Four components make up a typical DVD Menu:
✦Background image or movie: The backdrop picture that appears behind
all the controls
✦Buttons: Icons that represent the video clips and slideshows on the DVD
✦Background music: The background music that plays while the menu is
displayed
✦Titles: Text that appears in your DVD Menu
You can change the look and style of the background, buttons, and titles by
using one of the Apple-provided themes, or you can customize all parts of
the DVD Menu by using your own images, fonts, and buttons.
Themes
If you can’t draw anything from a matchbook cover and you didn’t have a
single class in graphic arts — like yours truly — you’ll be happy to know that
iDVD offers several professional-looking, pre-packaged themes for you to
use. A theme is just a group of settings that determine the look and feel of
your DVD Menu. (Many thanks, Apple. Especially from those of us who can’t
draw a stick figure without an eraser handy.)
To view the included themes, click the Customize button in the lower-left
corner of the iDVD window. When you do, a drawer pops out from the side of
the window, as shown in Figure 5-3.

The iDVD drawer contains a panel with buttons, which subdivides the
drawer into four sections:
✦Themes: The Themes panel is where you select one of the included
themes for your DVD Menu.
✦Settings: Select the Settings panel to tweak the settings of your theme,
like the background or audio track.
✦Media: Click this button to organize and import three different types of
media. You can choose from Audio (from your hard drive or audio CDs),
Photos (images from your iPhoto libraries or other locations on your
system), or Movies (manage your existing collection of movie clips or
import clips from iMovie HD).
✦Status: The Status tab gives you some extra information about the files
in your DVD presentation, like the size of the project. From this tab, you
can always see how much space remains on a DVD for you to work with.
Use choices from the Themes and the Settings tabs in the iDVD drawer to
personalize your DVD Menu to match your tastes. Start with the Themes
panel to choose from a list of professional themes, like Travel Cards, Anime
Pop, and Wedding White.
Clicking any one of these themes updates the DVD Menu to reflect your
selection. A theme contains a background image, a menu audio track, a
button style, and settings that affect the onscreen text.
Most of the animated themes provided by Apple also offer drop zones. A
drop zone is an area within the menu that can hold a single video clip or still
image, which then actually becomes part of the animation itself. For exam-
ple, the Travel Cards theme has a whopping six drop zones! (Note, however,
that a drop zone isn’t a link to other content, so you can’t use it like a
button.) To add a video clip or image to a drop zone, just drag the clip or
photo from a Finder window (or the Movie and iPhoto panes within the iDVD
drawer, or the iMovie HD window, or the iPhoto window) and drop it on top
of the drop zone. To delete the contents of a drop zone, just Control-click (or
right-click) the drop zone and click Clear.
A theme includes everything that you need to start building a project, so
when you find one that’s suitable, you can skip ahead to the section, “Adding
Media Files to Your DVD.”
On the other hand, if you don’t find a theme that fits your needs like a glove,
you can customize one of the included themes to match your own style. I’ll
show you how throughout the rest of this section.

Setting the background
The first thing that you see when you pop your DVD into your DVD player is
the background image. The rest of the DVD Menu controls hang out on top of
this picture. Besides the beautiful images that iDVD provides in its themes,
you’re free to use any other image that you prefer: You can use still or
motion images as a background and even add background music.
Adding a still background
To change the background of your DVD Menu, perform the following steps:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
This opens the iDVD drawer.
2. Click the Settings tab, as shown in Figure 5-4.
From here, you can set the various aspects of your DVD Menu.
3. Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background well
in the Menu section.
In Apple-Talk (power user pun intended), a well is a box that holds an
image or movie — you see a thumbnail preview of its contents. A well
also acts as the target for a drag-and-drop operation like this one.
iDVD updates the DVD Menu to reflect your new background choice.

Adding a moving background
The fun doesn’t stop there, though. Not only can you use any image from
your collection as the backdrop to your DVD Menu, but you can also use any
QuickTime movie to animate the background. Outstandingly sassy!
Using a movie clip as a background is not the same as adding a clip to a drop
zone. Rather, it replaces the original background provided with the theme
instead of occupying just a single area within the background, like a drop zone.
When you choose a movie to use as a background, make sure that it’s a
short clip, preferably no longer than 30 seconds. To make it look really pro-
fessional, try making the end of the movie clip sync with the beginning of the
movie. Because the short clip loops continuously, you don’t want too much
of a visual difference between the first and last frames of the clip.
To liven up your background with a movie, follow these steps.
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings tab.
The Settings tab enables you to change the various aspects of your DVD
Menu.
3. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
4. In the main DVD window, click the Motion button (bottom-right) to see
how your background video looks in action.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the background motion.
Adding audio to your menu
You can make your customized background even cooler — oops, I meant
more professional — by adding some audio to the mix. To add some back-
ground music or audio to your DVD Menu, follow these steps:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings tab.
Use choices here to change the background audio that plays while view-
ing your DVD Menu.
3. Drag an audio file from the Finder and drop it into the Audio well.
iDVD accepts AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files. If
you’re a .Mac subscriber, you can download dozens of free, professional-
quality audio clips that make good background audio for a DVD.

Mastering Menus
346
4. Click the Motion button in the main iDVD window (bottom-right) to
hear the background audio of your DVD Menu.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the audio.
When your DVD is complete, your viewers will hear the custom audio play
whenever the main DVD Menu is displayed. Here are some suggestions for
adding some extra style or mood to your DVD Menu system:
✦Play a rendition of “Happy Birthday” for a birthday DVD.
✦Play the “Wedding March” or the song you first danced to as the back-
ground for a wedding DVD.
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard TV,
make sure that your background image has the
same dimensions as standard digital video —
640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions of your image
don’t match the dimensions of digital video,
iDVD will stretch or shrink the image to fit,
which might have undesirable effects. When
your image is stretched and skewed to fit the
DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might end up looking
like Shrek. (Don’t forget that you can resize
images in iPhoto to help you with this step.)
Because standard TV sets have a different
aspect ratio than a digital video clip, activating
the Show TV Safe Area option, which you can
find under the Advanced menu, is also a good
idea. This draws a smaller rectangle within the
larger full screen. If you place your buttons
within this smaller rectangle and make sure
that the important parts of the background
image also appear within it, you can be certain
that any television will be able to display the
DVD properly. Go outside of this “safe area,”
and you might end up cutting Aunt Harriet’s
head off in the background image or losing
some of your most cherished clips.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to
change the dimensions of your background
image for import into iDVD. For example, you
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the
overall shape of the image and then resize it
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you
export the image from iPhoto and then save the
file in the Pictures folder located in your Home
folder so that you can find it easily later. (For
more on working in iPhoto, see Book III,
Chapter 3.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) or
HD (high-definition) TV display, you naturally
might not have the same problem. And because
iDVD 5 supports HD video and 16:9 video,
maybe prepared to kiss the phrases pan-and-
scan and full-screen goodbye and forget about
the Show TV Safe Area feature. If your com-
pleted DVD projects are purely for your own
enjoyment, that’s a great idea. However, don’t
forget that if you distribute your discs to others
with old-fashioned TVs dating back to the
archaic ’80s and ’90s, they might not be pleased
with what they see!

Adding Media Files to Your DVD

✦Bring back memories of the family vacation in the backseat of the car
with a DVD that plays “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall” as the background
music.
With a little imagination, you can probably come up with numerous ideas to
personalize the audio that accompanies your DVD projects.
Adding Media Files to Your DVD
With the background of your DVD Menu in place, it’s time to start adding
some content to the project — either video or still images. With iDVD, you
can add your movies or photographs to a DVD presentation. It’s a great way
to present and preserve your photographs and videos for years to come . . .
never again will your guests groan when you announce that you want to
show them home movies.
Adding a Movie Button
iDVD displays video clips in the Menu with small buttons. These Movie
Buttons display small previews of the video. To play the video, the user just
selects the Button. To create a Movie Button, you need to add some video
content to your DVD. To do so, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder
and drop it into your DVD Menu. If you happen to have iMovie HD open, you
can drag a clip from the iMovie HD clip palette into the iDVD window.
(Alternatively, open the iDVD drawer and display the Media pane and then
click Movies from the drop-down list box — now you can drag clips from
your Movies folder.)
When you drop a clip into your DVD Menu, a Movie Button appears, as
shown in Figure 5-5.
A Movie Button serves two important purposes:
✦Preview: Displays a small thumbnail image of the movie
✦Navigation: Permits a person to navigate the DVD
After you drag a movie file into your DVD Menu and create a Movie Button,
you can place the button anywhere in the DVD Menu that you wish. To repo-
sition a Movie Button, simply click it and drag it to the desired destination.
By default, Movie Buttons snap to an imaginary grid when relocated. To posi-
tion Movie Buttons outside the confines of this grid, select the Free Position
option in the Settings drawer.
An iDVD Menu limits you to 12 buttons. If you’d like to have more than that,
add a folder by clicking Folder — which automatically creates a submenu —
and drag another 12 movie files into the submenu.

Adding Media Files to Your DVD

Setting the Movie Button style
Like the Menu backgrounds, you can also customize Movie Buttons. To
adjust your Movie Buttons, do the following:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings tab.
3. Click any Movie Button from the DVD Menu to select it.
When you select a Movie Button, a small slider appears above it. Move
this slider to set the default thumbnail picture for that Button in the
Menu. If you select the Movie check box, the Movie Button animates in
the Menu.
To create a button with a still image instead of a movie clip, drag an
image file from a Finder window and drop it on top of the button.
4. Adjust the button’s properties in the Button section of the Settings
panel.
You can customize Movie Buttons in several different ways. Table 5-1
describes the settings and what they do.

Buttons in the DVD Menu, you can add a group of images to the Menu as
Slideshow Buttons. Slideshow Buttons are nearly identical to Movie Buttons,
with one exception: They play back a sequence of digital photographs
instead of a movie. Click the Slideshow button at the bottom of the iDVD
window to add . . . uh . . . well, a Slideshow Button. (It’s not easy to write
these books, you know.)
When you add a Slideshow Button, iDVD rearranges the buttons in the DVD
Menu to account for the new button.
Add images to the Slideshow
With a new Slideshow Button in place, you can add images to it by following
these steps:
1. Double-click the Slideshow Button that you just added to the Menu to
open the Slideshow window.
2. To add images to the Slideshow, drag your favorite images from the
iDVD drawer (specifically, the Photos section of the Media pane) to the
Slideshow window.
Feel free to drag several photos at once. After the photos are in the
Slideshow window, you can drag them around to change their order of
appearance.
You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto
window itself (if you happen to have it open).

3. To add some audio, simply drag your favorite audio file from the
Finder and drop it on the Audio well within the Slideshow window (or
click the drop-down list in the Media pane and click Audio to select an
audio track from iTunes).
4. When you’ve completed setting up your Slideshow, click the Return
button to return to the main Menu.
Setting the Slideshow Button preview
Because multiple images comprise a Slideshow, iDVD gives you the opportu-
nity to select which image you want for the DVD preview. To choose an
image as the preview, click the Slideshow Button that you added to the Menu
to select it. A slider appears above the Slideshow Button. Move this slider to
scroll through the various images in the Slideshow. When you find the image
that you want to use for the Slideshow Button in the DVD Menu, click the
Slideshow Button again to finish the task.
Customizing Titles
Your DVD Menu isn’t just a container of images, movies, and sound. It can 
do text, too! Labeling items in your DVD Menu makes it easier to use, and
iDVD makes it a cinch. You can find titles in your DVD Menu in two different
locations:
✦Main Title: The main Title usually appears at the top of the DVD Menu.
It’s the text that uses the largest font.
✦Button captions: Each Movie Button and Slideshow Button has its own
caption (a Title).
Use a Title to label a video clip with a description or add a date for future ref-
erence. As your collection of DVDs grows, you’ll be glad that you took the
time to properly label your Menu and Movie Buttons.
To change the text of the Title or the captions below Movie Buttons, select
the text by clicking it and then click it again to edit it. When you do, a rectan-
gle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit the text. Type the
text that you want to appear and then press Return when you’re finished.
As I mention earlier in the chapter, you can also customize the font, color,
and position of the various Titles by clicking the Customize button at the
bottom of the iDVD window. The iDVD drawer appears, and you can click
Settings to modify Titles.

Checking Things Out with a Preview

Checking Things Out with a Preview
Hey, you’re now a DVD-authoring professional! (Although you’re not getting
paid like one.) You’ll no doubt want to see the results of your efforts. Review
your work often to make sure that the results are up to your stellar ambi-
tions. To help you out, iDVD 5 gives you a full-featured Preview mode, in
which you can view your DVD creation much as you would with a traditional
DVD player. To preview your DVD, just click the Preview button at the
bottom right of the main iDVD window.
Previewing your DVD project also gives you the opportunity to check your
content. After all, you don’t want the “Wedding March” to play in the back-
ground of your birthday party footage or “The Old Gray Mare” at your in-
laws’ anniversary bash. Because you eventually want to commit this DVD
presentation to real DVD media, it makes sense to scrupulously preview
your presentation; you’ll avoid wasting blank DVDs.
The latest version of iDVD is far less finicky about the media you feed it — in
fact, if your SuperDrive can record using a specific type of blank DVD, you
can bet that iDVD now supports that media as well. Besides DVD-R, iDVD 5
can burn to DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW. Remember, however, that your
SuperDrive must be able to burn that type of disc, too. iDVD can’t perform
miracles. If you’re using a Power Mac G5, an iMac G5, a Mac Mini, or an eMac
that’s a year old or less, it’s a good bet that you can burn DVD-RW, DVD+R,
and DVD+RW media, too.
Or, you can let iDVD take care of things!
The new OneStep DVD feature in iDVD 5 allows
you to plug in your DV camcorder and gawk
while the application itself imports all the clips
you’ve shot, prepares everything, and then
burns the doggone thing — all automatically!
And after using OneStep DVD, I can tell you that
it does a pretty good job.
OneStep DVD is a neat way of producing a
“rough” DVD right after a special event, so that
you can give it as a gift (or sell it, if you’re in
business). Other possibilities include sample
presentations on DVD that you can supply to
clients, or a daily DV journal that you distribute
among members of your class to keep every-
one current on what’s happening.
To begin using OneStep DVD, click the OneStep
DVD button on the iDVD 5 top-level menu (refer
to Figure 5-1). iDVD prompts you to connect the
FireWire cable from your DV camcorder, and
then to turn on the camcorder and set it in VCR
mode. Click OK, and load a blank DVD.
A completed OneStep DVD plays automatically
when you load it.

Saving and Burning a DVD
352
Saving and Burning a DVD
After your DVD Menu is complete and the project looks great in Preview, it’s
time for the final step in the process. iDVD makes it just as easy to burn your
DVD as it was to lay out the menu and add media to it.
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window to begin
recording a DVD.
When you click it, the Burn button changes into something that looks
like a serious nuclear warning. (No need to run for cover, though. iDVD 5
is powerful . . . but not that powerful.)
iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive. When this
happens, you might see a message that reads like this:
Disc Insertion... Waiting for Device to Become Ready...
2. Insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive.
As I mention in the previous section, you can use any type of blank DVD
media that’s supported by your SuperDrive — however, keep in mind
that only DVD-Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest gen-
eration of DVD players will usually recognize DVD+R media, too.
3. After you load the disc, wait a moment for iDVD to recognize that the
ball is in its court.
iDVD begins the process of burning the DVD. The length of this process
varies depending on a few factors:
• DVD burner speed: The faster the drive, the shorter the wait
• Amount of material: The more content on your DVD, the longer the
wait
As the burning proceeds, iDVD updates you with progress messages.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand all the messages that it displays.
The language of the DVD creation process is a technical one, and some-
times iDVD speaks this language. Just ignore the messages as the burn-
ing proceeds.
Because iDVD has to encode all the content before the burn can take
place, it might take a couple of hours to create a DVD. After the first DVD
is done, though, iDVD lets you create additional DVDs in a fraction of the
time. It will keep asking you for additional discs until you cancel the
operation.
(Insert plug here.) If you want to find out what all these messages mean —
as well as how to burn all sorts of data, audio, and exotic CD and DVD 
formats — I would naturally recommend CD & DVD Recording For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by yours truly (Wiley). It’s a comprehensive guide
to everything optical for both Macs and Windows PCs.

4. When iDVD completes the burning process, remove the disc from the
drive and pop it into any consumer-grade DVD player.
Alternatively, you can leave the DVD in the drive, fire up DVD Player by
clicking its icon in the Applications folder, and view your new work of art
right on your Mac.
Personally, I find that iDVD 5 gives me all the features that I need. If you need
industrial-strength DVD authoring, Apple offers DVD Studio Pro 3 software,
which allows you to author DVDs like those that you find in the store. The
learning curve is a little steeper, naturally, and the application carries a profes-
sional price tag hovering around the $500 mark. However, with a little effort,
DVD Studio Pro 3 can be mastered by anyone who’s an expert at iDVD!

W
hen I was a kid, I always thought that real rock stars trashed their
instruments after a hard night’s worth of jamming — you know, like
The Who, Led Zeppelin, KISS, and the Rolling Stones. Guitars got set on fire,
or pounded into the stage, or thrown into the crowd like beads during a
Mardi Gras parade.
I can make my own music now, but you’ll never see me trash my instrument
because I compose music on my Mac with GarageBand, Apple’s latest addi-
tion to the iLife application suite. You can solo on all sorts of instruments,
and even add horns, drums, and a funky bass line for backup . . . all with
absolutely no musical experience (and, in my case, very little talent to
boot)!
In this chapter, I show you how to create a song using GarageBand, and then
you’ll make use of that shiny digital hub and listen to your own music in
iTunes. (And you know what that means — your own soundtracks in iDVD
and iMovie HD.)
Your Digital Instruments Await
Figure 6-1 illustrates the GarageBand window. Doesn’t look much like a rock
band, does it? Don’t worry; these controls will make perfect sense by the
end of this chapter. I start with introductions all around:

Your Digital Instruments Await
356
✦The timeline: This scrolling area might remind you of the timeline in
iMovie HD, and the concept is indeed the same: The timeline holds the
music loops (more on loops shortly) that you add or record, and scrolls
automatically while your song is playing. You can select and move loops
effortlessly across your timeline.
✦The track list: Each track is a separate instrument that plays one part of
your song. In Figure 6-1, the track is a Grand Piano. The track list dis-
plays all the instruments you’re using. Each track scrolls across the
timeline, all the way to the end of your song. Like loops, you can add,
delete, or modify tracks as necessary to change the sound of your
music.

357
✦Loops: Each loop in your song is the sound of an instrument played in a
specific style and tempo. To compose a song, you can drag loops from
the Loop Browser into an empty track.
✦The playhead: (Another similarity to iMovie HD, where you also have a
playhead that works in the same fashion.) In GarageBand, the playhead
is a moving vertical line that indicates the notes currently playing in
your song as it scrolls by in the timeline. You can change your position
in your song by dragging the playhead to a new location.
You can also consider the playhead as the insertion point for new loops,
as well as loops and regions of the timeline that you’ve copied onto the
Clipboard — they appear at the current playhead position.
✦Play: This familiar button works just like the Play button in iTunes or
the Play button on any audio CD player. As your song plays, the Play
button glows blue; to stop the music, press Play again. (If you press Play
again, your song starts at the current playhead position.)
✦The Create a New Track button: Most songs you compose have multiple
tracks; click this button to add a new track to the list.
✦Time/Tempo display: Musicians — and those that have used software
synthesizers before — will immediately recognize this display, which
shows the current playhead position in seconds. To change the tempo of
your song (a fancy word for speed), click the tempo indicator.
✦Track info: Click this button to display more information on an instru-
ment. You can also add effects like Echo from the Info dialog.
✦Show/Hide Loop Browser: This button reveals (or banishes) the Loop
Browser at the bottom of the GarageBand window.
✦Return to Beginning: This is a handy button: Click it to jump to the
beginning of your song. The playhead automatically returns to the begin-
ning of the timeline.
✦Volume: You get one guess on this one . . . and you’re right! Drag the
slider to raise or lower the volume.
These main controls are really all you need to start composing your first
song. I’ll introduce you to other fun stuff throughout the rest of the chapter.
Your First Steps as a Composer
I don’t think Mozart began a new work this way, but you can start a new
song at any time by pressing Ô+N. You’ll see the New Project dialog shown
in Figure 6-2, where you can name your new song and choose the tempo
(which determines the speed of the music). Click Create, and the
GarageBand window appears.

Your First Steps as a Composer
358
A song can have only one tempo in GarageBand; however, you can change
the tempo at any time.
If you’re not a musician, don’t fret too much (sorry about that) when it
comes to nuances like the time signature (Time) of the song and its key. The
defaults of 4/4 (Time) and C Major (Key) are very common in today’s popu-
lar music. To discover more about time signatures and keys, find a good
book on music theory.
Adding a track to the list
You’ll notice that a new song is automatically awarded two things: a single
track using Grand Piano (must be a favorite of Steve Jobs) and a tiny key-
board window. The keyboard window allows you to record your own loops
in the Grand Piano track by clicking notes with your mouse. Unfortunately,
this is a rather ponderous chore, so hip musicians prefer to buy a MIDI key-
board or instrument and connect it to the Mac through a USB port. You can
choose from all sorts of MIDI instruments; most are keyboards, but I’ve even
seen a MIDI saxophone. Apple offers a 49-key MIDI USB keyboard from M-
Audio for around $100. If you add a USB keyboard to your system, the key-
board window won’t appear . . . but for now, dismiss the keyboard window
by clicking its Close button.
If you actually want to use a Grand Piano in your new song, all is well.
However, if you don’t need it for your new alternative rock single, click Track
in the GarageBand menu and click Delete Track to remove the unnecessary
track from the list.
GarageBand provides two basic types of tracks that you can use in your
music:
✦Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio record-
ing, just like you’d make with a cassette recorder. Real instrument tracks
allow you to add your voice or a physical instrument like an electric
guitar or flute (with or without a MIDI connection) to your songs.
Figure 6-2:
A new song

Band begins
here.

Book III
Chapter 6

GarageBand
Your First Steps as a Composer
359
✦Software instrument tracks: These tracks actually don’t exist as conven-
tional audio recordings. Rather, they’re constructed from loops (mathe-
matic algorithms that are controlled by GarageBand), but they sound
just as good as real instrument tracks. (Think of an old-time piano roll —
a sequence of note instructions read by the instrument.)
If you’re like me (and can’t play an instrument at all), you’ll be using soft-
ware instrument tracks exclusively, and that’s what I’ll use in this demonstra-
tion. (In other words, you and I get to use our ears and creativity, and
GarageBand takes care of the rest.)
Your song needs at least one track, so follow these steps to add one:
1. Click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) at the bottom-left
corner of the GarageBand window.
The New Track dialog, as shown in Figure 6-3, appears.
2. Click the Software Instrument tab.
3. Here’s the beginning of the fun part: You get to pick an instrument
category from the left column. Click your favorite type of instrument.
For this track, I pick Bass.
4. Click the unique instrument from the general category in the right 
list box.
In this case, I need a good backup for a James Brown-style funk song, so
I pick Slapped Electric Bass, as you can see in Figure 6-3.
5. Click Create to create the track.
Your GarageBand window contains the first track for your new song.
Figure 6-3:

Your First Steps as a Composer

If you decide something doesn’t work while composing your song, don’t
forget that you can undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing Ô+Z imme-
diately afterward.
Selecting and adding instrument loops
If you’ve followed my example to this point, GarageBand knows what instru-
ment you want in your first track, but the track is empty! To add music to
your song, you need to select software instrument loops and add them to
your track, using the Loop Browser.
Click the Loop Browser button (which is marked with a cool-looking eye
icon) to display the collection of hundreds of loops provided by Apple (see
Figure 6-4). The Loop Browser can be displayed using either column or
button view mode, and you can toggle between them by clicking the button
in the lower-left corner of the Loop Browser. (I use button view mode here.)
Because I’m using a bass track in this example, the Bass button is the likely
candidate for the best-sounding loops. When you click it, you’ll see a list of
different loops. Because I’m interested only in the software instruments,
click any loop marked with a green musical note icon. I’ll pick a favorite of
mine: Slap Bass 02.

Chapter 6

361
When you click a loop, GarageBand begins playing it so that you can tell
whether that sound is what you’re looking for. If you choose another loop in
the list, GarageBand switches immediately to the new loop. This is a great
way to compare two loops, and you’ll quickly find that you can identify just
the loop you’re looking for in a jiffy.
Check out the familiar-looking Search box at the bottom of the Loop Browser.
Click in the box, type a keyword to search for a particular instrument or
sound, and then press Return. To reset your search and try another key-
word, click the X icon that appears at the right side of the Search box.
Click the Reset button in the Loop Browser to choose another instrument or
genre.
You can pick from any category of loops, not just those that are supposed 
to work the best — there’s no rule that says that you can’t use a piano loop
with your guitar! The instrument stays the same, no matter what type of 
loop you use, and you can get some really great riffs mixing styles and
instruments. Just make sure that you use Software Instrument tracks and
software instrument loops, as marked with the green musical note in the
Loop Browser.
I use Slap Bass 02 for this song. To add the loop to your track, drag it into
your Slapped Electric Bass track and drop it at the very beginning of the
timeline. The GarageBand window should now look like Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5:
A funky
“Seinfeld”
bass loop is

house!

Your First Steps as a Composer
362
You’re not limited to a single loop in each track. You could drag a different
loop after the first Slap Bass 02 loop, if you like. However, if you want that
same beat throughout your entire song, I’ll show you how to extend the beat
in a page or two.
Now you’re ready to add more tracks — one for each instrument you want in
your song — and then you should add at least one loop for each track. A
loop can start anywhere in the timeline, so instruments can solo or play
simultaneously . . . whatever floats your musical cruise ship. As you can see
in Figure 6-6, the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business would be down-
right proud of my composition so far, with electric guitar, drums, and all-out
organ involved!
You can mute a track, making it easier to listen to specific tracks and how
they work together in your song. Click the tiny speaker button under the
track name in the list, and it turns blue to indicate that the track has been
muted. To turn off the mute, click the speaker icon again. In the same
manner, you can crank up or drop the volume (and even change the stereo
balance) of each individual track using the controls next to the track name.
After all, a solo instrument deserves to be a little louder!

363
Editing and moving loops
Even after you add all the instruments and loops, your song isn’t finished.
Click Play, and you’ll find that it probably doesn’t last very long. After the
playhead moves past the last loop in the timeline, the song is done. What
you need is a way to extend the loops and make ’em last longer! There’s
gotta be a way to do that, right?
Hey, this is an application from Apple. There are actually three ways to
extend your song! You can
✦Resize the loop. To change the length of a loop, hover your mouse
cursor over either the loop’s lower left or right edge. When your cursor
changes to a vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop,
that’s your cue to click and drag. As you drag, you’ll see that most loops
expand to fill the space you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect
time. If you can’t resize the loop, read the following bullet.
✦Repeat the loop. Some loops can’t be resized because of the length or
the number of beats in the loop; however, these loops can be repeated.
Move your mouse cursor over the upper edge of the loop until it turns
into a vertical line with a circular arrow, indicating that you can click
and repeat the loop. GarageBand automatically adds multiple copies of
the same loop, as shown with the Rock Drum kit in Figure 6-7, for as far
as you drag the loop.
Figure 6-7:
Repeating a
loop
extends
your song.

Adding Effects the Easy Way
364
✦Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow of
the music. Again, the instrument stays the same, but it’s as if your studio
musician switches to another style!
Feel free to use Tiger’s standard cut and paste editing keys to cut, copy, and
paste loops wherever you like on the timeline. Or, you can click a loop and
drag it where you want it. Even tracks can be dragged into a different order
on the Track list.
Figure 6-8 illustrates my biggest hit — at least among my friends and family
members with truly good taste in techno-rock! Notice that several instru-
ments get a chance to solo, giving the music a more complex and interesting
sound.
Adding Effects the Easy Way
How would you like to add effects to your music, just like the professionals?
No problem! Each instrument in your track list can be customized by adding
echo and reverb (great for those wailing guitar solos), or perhaps you’d like
to fine-tune the sound of that funky bass line by using GarageBand’s built-in
equalizer settings.
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:

Listening to Your New Hit in iTunes
Yes! Your song is perfect — now, how are you going to share it with your
adoring public? (Or, more likely, how can you listen to it yourself without
having to launch GarageBand every time?) No problem: GarageBand can
share the songs you create by exporting them to iTunes. And from there 
(as you can read throughout this mini-book), you can use your original
music in iMovie HD and iDVD.
Your first step is to configure the iTunes preferences within GarageBand.
Choose GarageBand➪Preferences, and then click the Export button in the
Preference window toolbar to display the settings shown in Figure 6-10.
GarageBand supplies defaults for the target playlist within iTunes, as well as
the composer and album names to assign to your exported songs. To change
these defaults, click in each box and type your own text. GarageBand names
each exported song the same as the name you entered when you created the
song.
After you set your Export preferences, you can create an MP3 file from your
song in just two simple steps:

 Keeping track of your favorite media
 Tweaking QuickTime preferences
QuickTime is a set of exciting technologies that gives you access to the
greatest multimedia experience around. Despite its power, don’t be
surprised if you don’t even realize that you’re using it sometimes. Built with
the average Joe in mind, QuickTime takes multimedia to new heights with-
out forcing its users to become rocket scientists in the process. And dig that
sassy chrome sheen — not bad for a software application!
QuickTime Can Do That?
QuickTime was created by Apple to perform all sorts of multimedia func-
tions. Although normally associated with movie playback, QuickTime can do
much more. Whether movies, audio, animation, or music, QuickTime acts as
the main engine that drives all your multimedia needs.
✦Media player: QuickTime’s main claim to fame is playing all sorts of
media — and I do mean all sorts. Table 7-1 lists some of the media types
that QuickTime can play.
The real beauty of QuickTime is that it transparently handles playback
of all these media formats and more. You don’t even really have to know
what each of these formats is to play them. QuickTime takes care of that
for you.
✦File converter: The world of multimedia includes all kinds of file 
formats — so many, in fact, that it can take a rocket scientist to figure
them all out. Fortunately, beyond its abilities as a world-class media
player, QuickTime also has a full suite of conversion tools at its heart.
QuickTime can import many kinds of media and spit them back out into
practically any other format that it supports. Again, QuickTime handles

the messy details behind the scenes for you. You don’t need to know a
.mov file from an .mp4 file to import and export to and from either
format. QuickTime’s got you covered.
✦Internet media tool: When it comes to using media from the Internet,
QuickTime is in a league all its own. With its plug-in feature, QuickTime
takes its functionality to the Web browser. In addition to playing the
usual movies and audio files found on the World Wide Web, QuickTime
can play (or display) 3-D scenes and animations. If that weren’t enough,
QuickTime even lets you interact with some media. For example, with
QuickTime, you can navigate within 3-D worlds or play Flash games.

*Movies in AVI format use a wide range of compression schemes, many of them proprietary (like movies
produced with the DivX plug-in). For this reason, QuickTime might not be able to play some AVI movies
that you download.
Playing Media with QuickTime
QuickTime makes a world of movies, audio, graphics, and music instantly
available to you. Whether you want to view professional movie trailers or
listen to a garage band’s new single, QuickTime faithfully reproduces nearly
any media format that you feed it.
At the center of the action: QuickTime Player
At the heart of QuickTime’s playback functionality is the QuickTime Player
application. To launch QuickTime Player, double-click its icon in the Finder.
You can also launch QuickTime Player from the Finder by double-clicking a
media file that QuickTime can play. (See Table 7-1 earlier in this chapter for a
listing of these file types.)
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that QuickTime and QuickTime Player are
the same thing: QuickTime is a technology that hides in the background wait-
ing for instructions to do something with media; QuickTime Player is an appli-
cation that uses the QuickTime technologies. You’ll do media conversions,

playback, and editing with QuickTime Player. What you won’t see is the
QuickTime technology in action behind the scenes.
You can also launch QuickTime Player from its oh-so-convenient Dock icon.
For more on the Dock, read Book II, Chapter 2.
QuickTime has two versions: free or Pro. The main differences between the
free and Pro versions of QuickTime lie in the QuickTime Player application
itself. The free version just plays media, and the Pro version adds extra fea-
tures to QuickTime Player, such as converting ’twixt different media formats
and full-screen playback. If you’re using QuickTime Pro, all items listed in
this chapter will work as described.
If, however, you notice that a feature is dimmed out or missing altogether,
you might be using the free QuickTime license. To find out whether you’re
using a free or Pro license, open the System Preferences and navigate to the
QuickTime panel. If you’ve registered as a QuickTime Pro user, you can find
its registration information here, as shown in Figure 7-1. If you’re not a regis-
tered user, you can purchase the upgrade at www.apple.com/quicktime.
The upgrade will cost you $29.99, at the time of this writing.
Opening QuickTime movies
To begin viewing and hearing — aw, what the heck, how about absorbing —
multimedia files, choose File➪Open File from the QuickTime Player applica-
tion. This isn’t the only way to open a file with QuickTime Player, though.
Some of the other ways to open files with QuickTime Player are
✦Drag a file to the QuickTime Player icon on the Dock.
✦Double-click the media file in the Finder. If it has a QuickTime-style
icon (a blue letter Q), it will automatically open in QuickTime Player.

Operating QuickTime Player
When you open a QuickTime file, QuickTime Player creates a new window to
display it. All QuickTime Player windows share some common features.
✦Close, Minimize, and Zoom controls: These three controls appear at the
top left-hand corner of most windows in Mac OS X. You probably recog-
nize them by their colors: red, yellow, and green, respectively.
✦Resize handle: Drag the lower right-hand corner of QuickTime Player to
resize its movie for playback. Hold Shift while dragging to break free from
constrained resizing. If the document contains sound media only, the
window will grow or shrink in a horizontal direction when you resize it.
Any resizing that you perform makes no changes to the original file.
QuickTime provides it for your convenience during playback.
Although some window features are common to all QuickTime Player win-
dows, many features depend on the type of media that you wish to play.
Table 7-2 lists some of the window features that you might find and the
media types associated with those features.

To make your life easier, QuickTime does a lot of work for you behind the
scenes each time that it opens a media file. Although you might think that
there are different combinations of controls in QuickTime Player, the reality
is that the various media windows are more similar than they are different.
Figure 7-2 shows the location of various QuickTime Player controls.

Playing media
Playback begins as you might suspect — by clicking the Play button. While a
file is playing, the Play button toggles to a Stop button. Click that button to
stop playback, which toggles the button back to Play.
Clicking the buttons with double-arrows on them advances the playback head
at high speed in the direction of the arrows. If the file has audio in it, you hear
the playback at high speed, which sounds like an episode of those helium-
inhaling Chipmunks. (Remember? Meee, I waaant a hooola hooop.) Despite its
comical sound, it’s helpful for quickly scanning through a file. Click the but-
tons with a single arrow to advance to the beginning or end of a file.
You can also advance through the file by dragging the playback head in
either direction. This action is permissible while the file is playing or when
it’s stopped. Unlike when you use the buttons, however, you miss out on the
high-speed sound and video.
To adjust the volume of a movie, simply move the volume slider left or right.

Advanced playback features
QuickTime Player offers advanced playback features that go beyond simple
play and stop functions. Keep in mind, however, that some of the advanced
features of QuickTime Player are meant only for registered QuickTime Pro
users. The general rule is that registered Pro users of QuickTime Player can
modify QuickTime content. If you aren’t registered as a QuickTime Pro user,
you can take advantage of only playback features in QuickTime Player.
Video playback
To adjust video playback quality, choose Window➪Show A/V Controls or
press Ô+K. When you do, QuickTime presents you with the A/V Controls
dialog. The audio and video settings that you can change from this dialog
(see Figure 7-3) include
✦Volume
✦Bass
✦Treble

Looping features
Sometimes you might want to play a piece of media more than once. In these
situations, you need to loop the playback. To force a movie to loop, choose
View➪Loop or press Ô+L. Press Ô+L again to turn off looping.
If you want to get fancy, you can also play a movie in a forward direction fol-
lowed by playback in reverse. Apple calls this looping back and forth. To do
this, choose View➪Loop Back and Forth.
Movie info
To see more information about the files that you’re playing, ask the expert:
QuickTime Player. To view basic information about a movie, choose
Window➪Show Movie Info or press Ô+I. The resulting window displays the
following data:
✦Source: Location of the file
✦Format: Compressor and dimensions of the file
✦FPS: Preferred rate of playback in frames per second (fps)
✦Playing FPS: Actual rate of playback in fps (available during playback
only)
✦Data Size: Size of the file
✦Data Rate: Preferred rate of playback (in bytes per second)
✦Current Time: Position of the playback head (in units of time)
✦Duration: Length of the movie file (in units of time)
Figure 7-3:

controls and

Playing Media with QuickTime

✦Normal Size: Default movie dimensions
✦Current Size: Actual movie dimensions (if you’ve resized the movie
since opening the file)
These bits and pieces of information are read-only, which means that you
can’t change them from the Movie Info window.
Movie properties
In addition to general movie information, you can also peek inside a
QuickTime movie to see what makes it tick. To display the Movie Properties
window, choose Window➪Show Movie Properties or press Ô+J.
The Movie Properties window displays the tracks via the pop-up menu on
the top left of the Movie Properties window. Selecting a track causes the
pop-up menu on the top right to display a set of properties that pertain to
the selected track.
Unlike the Movie Info window, the Movie Properties window does let you
change many aspects of a movie. For example, to resize, skew, or even rotate
a movie’s video track, follow these steps:
1. With QuickTime Player, open a QuickTime movie.
2. Press Ô+J to open its Movie Properties window.
3. From the Tracks pop-up menu of the Properties window, choose the
first available Video Track.
4. From the Properties pop-up menu, choose Size.
Back on track
Every file that you open with QuickTime Player
consists of one or more tracks. A track contains
one (and only one) type of media. For example,
a typical QuickTime movie might comprise two
tracks:
 Video track: Stores the video data of the
movie
 Sound track: Stores the audio data of the
movie
In contrast, opening an audio file with QuickTime
Player might have only a single sound track.
Other files don’t have a video or sound track at
all: Shockwave and Flash (.swf) files, for exam-
ple, usually contain only one Flash track. MIDI
files have yet another type of track. Luckily,
QuickTime makes it simple for you to ignore
these technical trivia facts altogether (which
most of us prefer).

5. Click the Adjust button.
Red adjustment handles appear in the movie player. Resize and rotate to
your heart’s content!
6. After you adjust the track’s size to your liking, click the Done button.
With a similar approach, you can change many other properties of a track,
such as Annotations settings.
QuickTime: The Super Converter
QuickTime Pro also makes a great tool for converting media files. As your
collection of multimedia grows, you’ll eventually find yourself wishing that
certain files were in a different format. For example, you might want to con-
vert a QuickTime movie to a digital video (DV) file for use with iMovie. With
a few clicks, QuickTime Pro can open a media file in one of dozens of formats
and convert it to most any other format that QuickTime understands. To do
so, you must import the file into QuickTime and then export it into the
format that you prefer.
Importing files
For most operations, you can open a file with QuickTime Player by using the
usual File➪Open File menu item. For some formats, however, this won’t work.
In these instances, QuickTime gives you the chance to import a file. The dif-
ference between open and import is subtle but important: If QuickTime can
natively handle a file’s media, you can use the Open menu. If it can’t handle a
media’s data natively, it must import the file. The import process converts
the file to a format that QuickTime can use. To start the import process, just
choose File➪Import.
For example, QuickTime doesn’t normally display text files. Using the Import
command, however, converts a text file into a movie file. Then you can view
the text in a traditional movie player window.
Table 7-4 lists the file types that QuickTime can import. For a more compre-
hensive discussion of the formats you can import, visit the QuickTime area
on the Apple Web site at
www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qt/specifications.html

Exporting files
After you open or import a media file, QuickTime Pro will let you export it to
one of many formats. For example, you might export a QuickTime movie to
an AVI movie for those Windows users who don’t have QuickTime installed.
To export a movie, choose File➪Export. In the dialog that appears, select the
desired output format from the Export pop-up menu. Each export type also
has a set of options. To view them, click the Options button on the right side
of the Export dialog.
Make QuickTime the Center of Your Digital Universe
Although QuickTime Player and Pro are great at actively importing, export-
ing, and altering all kinds of media, most Mac OS X owners don’t care about
these features. For those who could care less what the media type is for an
e-mail attachment, QuickTime transparently handles the chore of displaying
the file without having to know all the technical details behind it. With
QuickTime as your ally, you can watch the latest Star Wars movie trailer, view
an image in a Web page, or (if you’re like me) you can listen to Bob Hope jaw
with Bing Crosby (if you have a collection of classic radio shows in MP3
format). QuickTime makes a great tool for viewing and exploring all sorts of
exciting multimedia content.
Favorites
The quickest way to keep track of your media files is with the Favorites
menu. It offers one-click access to the media files that you use most. To add
a file to the Favorites menu, do the following:
1. Open your favorite media file.
2. Press Ô+D or choose Window➪Favorites➪Add Movie as Favorite.

Chapter 7

Now, anytime you want to watch and/or hear this file, you simply choose it
from the Favorites menu.
You can remove files later from the Favorites menu by performing these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Favorites➪Show Favorites.
2. In the Favorites window that appears, select the file that you wish to
remove.
3. Press the Delete key to remove the file from the Favorites menu.
Free content for all
QuickTime Player offers you one-click access to a variety of multimedia con-
tent, including news, entertainment, and educational features. Naturally, an
Internet connection is required. To view the QuickTime Player Content
Guide, click Window and click Show Content Guide (see Figure 7-4).
When you do, a new window opens in the Player — this is the Content
Guide’s main menu. From here, you can click any of the provided links just
as you might click a link in a Web page.
Clicking any item in the Content Guide opens a Web page in your preferred
browser.

QuickTime and your browser
QuickTime is equally at home in a Web browser. Like the QuickTime Player
application, the QuickTime Web plug-in offers convenient playback utilities
directly in your Web browser. To view a movie in a browser window, simply
navigate to a Web page that contains a QuickTime movie; QuickTime auto-
matically loads the movie and plays it in the Web page. In many cases, you
can even save a movie from a Web page — just click the triangle icon at the
far right of the movie controller, or Control-Click/right-click in the movie
window. A menu appears, giving you two options to save the movie:
Choosing Save As Source saves the file in the format in which you originally
downloaded it, and choosing Save As QuickTime Movie converts the file to a
QuickTime movie.
To aid your quest for QuickTime content on the Web, Apple hosts a vast
array of materials on its site. You can find movie trailers, free tunes from
your favorite artists, game trailers, and Internet radio news at this site:
www.apple.com/quicktime
Tweaking QuickTime
After you become comfortable with using QuickTime for media playback,
you might want to expand your horizons. QuickTime has many features —
so many, in fact, that it requires two different Preference windows to handle
them all.
Setting QuickTime Player Preferences
To open QuickTime Player Preferences, choose QuickTime Player➪
Preferences. A General Preferences dialog appears with a number of settings
that affect how the QuickTime Player application works.
Working with QuickTime Preferences
To open the Preferences for QuickTime, do one of the following:
✦Open System Preferences and click on the QuickTime icon.
✦Using the QuickTime Player application, choose QuickTime Player➪
QuickTime Preferences.
Click the various tabs of the QuickTime Preferences to change its settings.

Besides the Registration panel, which I discuss at the beginning of the chap-
ter, the QuickTime Preferences consist of four other panels:
✦Browser: To play QuickTime content, your browser uses a QuickTime
plug-in. Configure the plug-in’s settings here.
✦Update: Wondering whether you have the most current version of
QuickTime? Let QuickTime look for you! In this panel, you can force
QuickTime to update itself.
✦Streaming: QuickTime can tailor your online multimedia experience to
the speed of your Internet connection. Tell QuickTime what speed your
connection uses, and it takes care of the rest.
✦Advanced: QuickTime can do music! Select QuickTime’s synthesizer in
this panel. Click the Media Keys button to set authentication for secure
media. You can also click the MIME Settings button to configure the file
types recognized by the QuickTime Plug-in.

In This Chapter
 What you need to watch DVDs on your Macintosh
 Using the DVD Player software
 Mysteries of the hidden controls unearthed!
A
ll the creative capabilities of the Mac OS X digital hub are a lot of fun,
but at some point, you’re going to want to take a break from work. In
recent years, DVDs have exploded onto the home entertainment scene;
because of its high fidelity, convenience, and seemingly limitless storage
capacity, the DVD has taken consumers by storm. The idea of an honest-to-
goodness theater in your home is now within the grasp of mere mortals
(with, coincidentally, merely average budgets). Mac OS X has everything
that you’ll need to enjoy a night at the movies without ever leaving home. In
fact, I can highly recommend the new 20-inch iMac G5 or the 17-inch
PowerBook for those wide-screen classics.
The DVD Hardware
Before you watch one second of film, get your setup in order. Playing DVDs
requires a bit of hardware; fortunately, most recent Macintosh computers
come equipped with the stuff that’s necessary to watch DVDs.
To play DVD movies, you’ll need either an internal DVD-compatible drive in
your Macintosh or an external DVD drive with a FireWire or USB 2.0 connec-
tion. Note: DVD-ROM drives can only play discs, while others, like the
SuperDrive, can both play and record discs. Either type of drive will work
fine for watching movies on your Mac.
You can watch any standard DVD that you purchase at your local video
store as well as any DVD that you create with iDVD. (For more on iDVD 5,
iRead Book III, Chapter 5.)

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
384
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
To watch Frodo Baggins, Don Corleone, or James Bond, you’ll need DVD
player software. Mac OS X comes stocked with the perfect tool for the task:
DVD Player.
Apple’s DVD Player application is included with Mac OS X — you’ll find it
within the confines of your Applications folder. But instead of rooting
through the Finder, you can launch DVD Player an even easier way: Simply
insert a DVD into the drive. As soon as you do, your Mac recognizes the disc
and launches DVD Player by default for you. (Time for another round of well-
deserved gloating about your choice of personal computer.)
This automatic behavior can be curbed, however. You can control what
action Tiger takes (if any) when you load a DVD via the CDs & DVDs panel
within System Preferences. For all the details, visit Book II, Chapter 3.
However you choose to start DVD Player, you’ll notice that it offers two 
windows:
✦Controller: The small, silver-colored, remote control-looking interface
that holds all the controls for the Player
✦Viewer: The large window where you view your DVD movies
If you’re already using a traditional DVD player, you’ll be right at home with
Apple’s DVD Player. Even if you’ve never used a traditional DVD player, it’s
not much different than using a software-based audio player like iTunes.
Using the Controller
The Controller is the command center of the DVD Player software. Arranged
much like a VCR or tape deck, all the familiar controls are present. Check it
out in Figure 8-1. (If your controller is facing in the other direction, don’t
panic — the controller can be switched between horizontal and vertical ori-
entations from the Controls menu.)
Table 8-1 details the fundamental commands present in the DVD Player
Controller. Apple software usually has some goodies hidden beneath the sur-
face, and DVD Player is no exception. The controls in DVD Player have a few
functions that might not be obvious to the casual user. These are listed in
the third column of Table 8-1.

As I mention earlier, you can switch the Controller between horizontal and
vertical orientation, which can make it easier to fit onscreen. Choose
Controls➪Use Horizontal Controller (or Use Vertical Controller, depending
on the current orientation).
Keep your eyes on the Viewer
As soon as you begin playing around with the DVD Player controls, you’ll
notice activity in the Viewer window, shown in Figure 8-2.
You can think of the Viewer window as a television inside your Macintosh if
it helps, but DVD Player goes one step further. Unlike a television screen, the
Viewer has some nice tricks up its sleeve: For example, you can resize the
Viewer window by using one of the four sizes listed in the Video menu (half,
normal, maximum, and full-screen sizes). This is useful for watching a movie
Figure 8-2:
The Viewer
is the real
star of
Tiger’s DVD

Jumping right to the flying-monkey action
Movies on DVD are divided into chapters that
enable you to jump directly to that point. That
way, you can jump right to the scene, say, where
the flying monkey guards march into the Wicked
Witch’s castle in The Wizard of Oz. (Or skip that
egg-hatching scene in Alien that always makes
you nauseous.) You can navigate to chapters,
play the movie from the beginning, or check out
special bonus features (such as trailers and doc-
umentaries) from the DVD’s main menu.

in a small window on your Desktop while you work with other applications.
From the keyboard, you can toggle half-size with Ô+1 (one), normal size with
Ô+2 (two), and maximum size with Ô+3 (three),
If you’re in it for the entertainment factor only, you’ll probably want to resize
the Viewer to fill the screen. I like to watch movies in full-screen mode,
which you can toggle with the Ô+0 (zero) keyboard shortcut.
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
As anyone with a little DVD experience knows, DVDs can do a lot more than
those archaic tapes that you used to feed your VCR. Apple has included sev-
eral functions that allow you to explore the extra features and content pro-
vided with a DVD movie.
Controller extras
To use the additional Controller features, double-click the small tab at the
rightmost (or bottom) edge of the DVD Player Controller. When you do, a
trick drawer slides out displaying the extra controls. (See Figure 8-3.) You
can also display or hide the drawer with the Controls➪Open Control Drawer
menu command or by pressing Ô+] (that’s the right bracket key).

Although you won’t find a Bookmark button on the Controller, DVD Player

that you can return to at any time, like a favorite scene. To set a bookmark 
at the current spot in the movie, click the Controls menu and click New
Bookmark or press Ô+= (the equal sign key). DVD Player even allows you to
name the bookmark so it’s easier to remember. To return to a bookmark,
choose Go➪Bookmarks and click the desired bookmark.
DVD Player preferences
The DVD Player application has a variety of settings that you can access and
adjust via its preferences window. To open the preferences window, choose
DVD Player➪Preferences. This brings up the preferences dialog.
This window consists of five panels:
✦Player: Settings that affect how DVD Player operates
✦Disc Setup: Settings for Audio, Subtitles, Language, and the Web
✦Full Screen: Settings that determine your Viewer window configuration
✦Windows: Settings for displaying onscreen information during playback
✦Previously Viewed: Settings that determine what happens when you
load a DVD that you’ve already watched
The advantage of these preference settings is that you can customize your
copy of DVD Player to match your needs or desires. (Thanks yet again to the
Cupertino Crowd!)

Player
As you can see in Figure 8-4, the Player settings take care of much of the
automation within DVD Player.
✦When DVD Player Opens: These two check boxes affect what happens
when you launch the DVD Player application. You can force DVD Player
to play in full screen mode and automatically begin playback every time
you start the application.
✦When a Disc Is Inserted: Besides automatic playback on startup, you
can also make DVD Player start playing a disc automatically when the
application is already running. (To illustrate: If this check box is dis-
abled, loading a new disc will not automatically start it playing if DVD
Player is already running.)
✦When Muted: Do you answer a lot of telephone calls while you sneak a
quick DVD movie at work? If so, enable this option . . . if you have to
press the Mute button on your keyboard while a movie is playing, DVD
Player automatically adds the subtitles/closed captions so that you can
keep up with the dialog. Super sassy!
✦During iChat with Audio: Another option for those who like multiple
applications at once. If you’re watching a DVD and start an audio chat in
iChat AV, you can choose to either mute the DVD audio, or pause the
DVD playback until you click Play again.
✦When Viewer Is Minimized: Watching a DVD at the office, eh? Enable
this check box, and DVD Player automatically pauses the movie when
you minimize the DVD Player window. (Managers label this feature down-
right sneaky.)

Disc Setup
The second tab of the Player preferences window consists of these sections:
✦Language: Sprechen Sie Deutsch? DVDs are designed to be multilanguage-
aware. Feel like brushing up on your German, Spanish, or Chinese? You
can control the language used for the audio, subtitling, and menus in this
section.
✦Internet: One lonely setting resides in the Internet section. Some DVDs
can access information on the Internet. Mark this check box to allow
that function.
✦Audio: Click this drop-down list box to specify the default audio output
signal that you’d like to use. You can also choose to disable the Dolby
dynamic range compression feature, which might enhance the sound for
two-speaker systems.
Multiple languages and Web access are not mandatory features of a DVD, so
don’t be surprised if you see variations of support when it comes to these
settings.
Full Screen
These preference settings control the default screen display settings within
DVD Player.
✦Controller: I generally like to hide the Controller after a defined time of
inactivity; select the Hide Controller If Inactive For xx Seconds check
box if you agree. To set the delay period, click in the seconds box and
type a new value.
✦Displays: These options specify how DVD Player shares your Desktop
with others: politely or downright rude. You can choose to automatically
dim other monitors while a movie is playing (if you have more than one
display connected to your Mac), and DVD Player can stay in full-screen
mode even if another application actually has the active window. Finally,
you can choose to remove the menu bar altogether (often called kiosk
mode), which helps cut down on interruptions and accidents if small
hands are nearby — and you can optionally allow Tiger’s screen saver to
appear on the DVD menu in kiosk mode.
Windows
This panel gives you the chance to configure the behavior of the Controller
and status information for the Viewer window.
✦Options: Mark the Display Status Information check box, and DVD Player
adds a small text box at the top-left corner of the Viewer window. In this
text box, you see the name of the last task that you performed with

DVD Player. For example, click the Stop button to see the word Stop dis-
played in the Viewer on top of the video beneath it. You can also set the
Controller to fade away instead of just disappearing — it’s eye candy, but
doggone it, it’s good eye candy!
✦Floating Overlays: If you do decide to display status information, you
can click the color buttons to specify the text color for the status infor-
mation and closed caption text. You can also choose the font for your
text. Heck, if your Mac has a powerful-enough video card, you can
choose to make these lines of text semitransparent to boot. (Think
Return of the Son of Eye Candy.)

Our final DVD Player Preferences panel controls what happens when you
load a disc that you’ve seen already . . . or perhaps your significant other
watched it and didn’t tell you. (Insert growling noise here.)
✦Start Playing Discs From: If you have to quit DVD Player for some reason,
the application is smart enough to remember where you were . . . and you
can choose to begin watching from the beginning, from the last position
(where you were when you stopped the last time), or from a default book-
mark. Alternatively, just select Always Ask, and DVD Player will prompt
you each time that this situation crops up.
✦Always Use Disc Settings For: Enable these check boxes to specify
whether DVD Player should use the same settings you used the last time
you watched this disc.
Don’t forget to click OK to save any changes that you make to your DVD

Chapter 1: Getting on the Internet
In This Chapter
 Selecting an Internet service provider (ISP)
 Understanding how your Mac gets on the Internet
 Setting up your Internet connection
I
’ll be honest — the Internet is a terribly complex monster of a network. If
you tried to fathom all the data that’s exchanged on the Internet and
everything that takes place when you check your e-mail for Aunty Joan’s
fruitcake recipe, your brain would probably melt like a chocolate bar in the
Sahara Desert. There’s a shoebox full of archaic things tucked under the
Internet: communications protocols, routing addresses, packets, servers,
and other hoo-hah that’s beyond the grasp of just about everyone on the
planet.
Luckily for regular folks like you and me, Mac OS X closes the trapdoor on
all these details, keeping them hidden (as they should be). You don’t have to
worry about them, and the obscure information that you need in order to
establish an Internet connection is kept to a minimum. In fact, the happiest
computer owners that I’ve met think that the Internet is a little blinking light
on their DSL or cable modem: If the light blinks in the proper manner, all is
well. (I don’t argue with them.)
In this chapter, I provide help and advice to those who are searching for an
on-ramp to the Information Superhighway — and I lead you through the pro-
cedure of adding an Internet connection under Mac OS X. (In other words,
you’ll get your light blinking properly.)
Note: If you entered your Internet configuration information while you were
in the First Use Wizard during the installation of Mac OS X — or if you
upgraded to Mac OS X from Mac OS 9, and you already had a working
Internet connection — you can skip this chapter! The information contained
herein is only for those who add or change their Internet connectivity after
installing Mac OS X.

Shopping for an ISP
396
Shopping for an ISP
Before you can connect to the Internet, you must sign up for Internet access.
If you already have an ISP (acronym-speak for an Internet service provider) or
your company provides Internet access, smile quietly to yourself and skip to
the next section. Otherwise, hang around while I discuss what to look for in
an ISP and how to locate one in your local area.
ISPs are as thick as Louisiana mosquitoes these days, and often they’re
judged solely by the amount that they charge for basic access. Cost defi-
nitely is a factor, but it’s not the only thing that should determine your
choice in a service provider. Consider these guidelines when choosing or
switching ISPs:
✦Local calling rates: If you live in a rural area, check to make sure that all
prospective ISPs offer local calling rates. Believe me, no matter how
much fun and how useful the Internet is, it’s not worth hours of long-dis-
tance charges. (Oh, and don’t forget to make sure that your ISP has local
access numbers in the cities that you visit regularly.)
✦Broadband service: Most ISPs now offer digital subscriber line (DSL)
and cable modem access. Collectively, these connections are called
broadband because they offer the fastest method of transferring informa-
tion to and from the Internet. If you have a home business, a large family,
or students — or you telecommute to your office — using broadband
can make your life much simpler.
✦Quality technical support: A 24-hour/7-day telephone support line is a
godsend for the Internet novice — don’t settle for voice support during
business hours. Forget e-mail-based support, too; your e-mail applica-
tion will be dead and gone if your Internet connection gives you prob-
lems. (Sound of your palm whacking your forehead.)
✦Static IP addresses: A static IP address — the unique number that identi-
fies your computer on the Internet — allows you to set up a professional
Web server or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. (More on these
adventures later in Book VII, Chapter 4.) Most ISPs charge an additional
amount for a static IP address, so it’s not really a good idea for a typical
Mac owner at home. Suffice it to say, however, that a business or organi-
zation running a Web server or FTP server will benefit from a static IP
address.
✦E-mail accounts: Investigate how many individual accounts that you
receive with various ISPs. Also, find out whether you can maintain them
yourself through a Web site. If so, that’s a good sign. Additionally, if the
prospective ISP provides a Web site where you can read and send e-mail
messages, you can stay on top of your e-mail even while you’re on the
road or vacationing halfway across the globe.

Chapter 1

the Internet
Investigating Various Types of Connections
397
✦Web space: If you want your ISP to host your Web site, this is a no-
brainer: The more space you get, the better. A minimum of 5MB is
acceptable, but most ISPs provide 10MB or 20MB these days. Also,
beware of ISPs that charge you for your Web site if it receives a large
amount of traffic: It can be expensive to host a popular Web site if you
join one of these ISPs.
✦Domain name service: Finally, the better class of ISP also offers a
domain name service, which allows you to register something like 
yournamehere.com. For the most professional appearance, you can 
usually pay a yearly fee, and the ISP takes care of all the details in setting
up your own .com or .org domain name.
Locating an ISP is much easier in the modern Internet-savvy world than it
was just two or three years ago. In the order that you should try them, here
are the tricks that I recommend for finding your local ISPs:
✦Check with your cable or telephone companies. If you’re already sub-
scribing to cable service in your area, you’re likely to be a candidate for
cable Internet access. Also, many local phone companies offer DSL
access, but that access area is often limited to certain locations. Call the
customer service numbers for these companies and check out what they
offer — and don’t forget that a broadband cable or DSL connection is
always more expensive than an old-fashioned, dialup connection.
(“Maude, did you see the Internet bill this month?”)
✦Get recommendations from friends and neighbors. Folks love to give
free advice: Ask them how much they’re paying, how reliable the con-
nection has been, and how well they rate the ISP’s technical support.
✦Check your phone directory. Check the phone book for Internet 
service.
✦Investigate ISP Web sites. If you have Internet access at work, a 
friend’s house, or your local public library, you can surf to The List
(www.thelist.internet.com) where you can search for ISPs within
your area code and location.
Investigating Various Types of Connections
Next, consider the types of connections that are available under Mac OS X to
link your Mac to said ISP. You can choose from four pathways to digital 
freedom:

Investigating Various Types of Connections
398
✦A dialup connection: Old-fashioned, yes. Slow as an arthritic burro,
indeed. However, an analog (or telephone modem) connection is still the
primary method for reaching the Internet for most computer owners. It’s
the cheapest method available, and all you need for this type of connec-
tion is a standard telephone jack and a modem. If you remember your
classic iMac commercials, any Mac that can run Mac OS X should have a
built-in modem.
✦A broadband connection: Be it through DSL (which uses a standard
telephone line) or cable (which uses your cable TV wiring), broadband
Internet access is many times faster than a dialup connection. Plus, both
these technologies are always-on, meaning that your computer is auto-
matically connected to the Internet when you turn it on and that connec-
tion stays active. With DSL or cable, there’s no squeaky whine that
accompanies your modem making a connection each time that you want
to check your movie listings Web site. Both DSL and cable require a spe-
cial piece of hardware (commonly called a modem, but it really isn’t);
this box is usually thrown in as part of your ISP charge. Broadband con-
nections usually require a professional installation, too.
✦A satellite connection: If you’re really out there — miles and miles away
from any cable or DSL phone service — you can still get high-speed
Internet access. The price for a satellite connection is usually much
steeper than a standard DSL or cable connection, but it’s available 
Oh, please! Not ISDN!
If you’re thinking, “Hey, Mark, you forgot
ISDN!” allow me to reply, “So did everyone
else.” I don’t mean to anger all those prophets
who predicted that we’d all be using Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) by now, but
the truth is that ISDN turned into a joke.
Essentially, ISDN was the ancestor of DSL,
which actually realized the potential of the idea.
ISDN, which was the first broadband connec-
tion method to use regular phone lines, was
supposed to revolutionize the Internet five or
six years back (along with curing male pattern
baldness and explaining UFO abductions).
Unfortunately, ISDN technology requires all
sorts of very complex and expensive hardware,
and it really isn’t as fast as all that — most
cable modem Internet access is much faster.
(Consider what happens to the first entry in just
about any technological advance . . . sigh.)
ISDN was quickly eclipsed by the other broad-
band technologies . . . therefore, its abbrevia-
tion has come to mean It Still Does Nothing, and
anyone with an option to use DSL or cable
should give ISDN a wide berth.

anywhere you can plant your antenna dish with a clear view of the sky.
Plus, a satellite connection is actually faster than other types of broad-
band access. Older satellite technologies actually required you to use a
dialup connection — and the antenna could only receive, not send —
but most ISPs that can handle satellite connections now offer satellite
systems that both send and receive through the dish.
✦A network connection: The last type of connection concerns those
Macs that are part of a local area network (LAN) either at the office or in
your home. If your Mac is connected to a LAN that already has Internet
access, you don’t need an ISP at all, and no other hardware is required:
Simply contact your network administrator, buy that important person a
steak dinner, and ask to be connected to the Internet. On the other hand,
if your network currently has no Internet access, you’re back to Square
One: You’ll need one of the previous three types of connections.
After you connect one of your computers on your network to the Internet,
you can use an Internet sharing device to allow all the computers to share
that Internet connection. Book V, Chapter 5 goes into all the details on shar-
ing an Internet connection on a network.
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Okay, so you sign up for Internet access, and your ISP sends you a sheet of
paper covered with indecipherable stuff that looks like Egyptian hieroglyph-
ics. Don’t worry; those are the settings that you need to connect to your 
ISP. After you get them in Mac OS X, you should be surfing the Web like an
old pro.
Before you jump into this configuration, make sure that you’ve configured
the Internet settings within System Preferences, as I discuss in Book II,
Chapter 3. That way, you’ll already have entered your default e-mail and Web
settings.
Using your internal modem
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using your
Mac’s internal modem:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and choose Network.
2. Select Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list.
3. Click the TCP/IP tab (as shown in Figure 1-1) and enter the settings for
the type of connection that your ISP provides:

Setting Up Your Internet Connection
400
• If your ISP tells you to use PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Click the
Configure IPv4 drop-down list and choose Using PPP. If your ISP pro-
vided you with DNS Server or Search Domain addresses, type them
now in the corresponding boxes.
• If you’re using AOL: Click the Configure IPv4 drop-down list and
choose AOL Dialup. If AOL provided you with DNS Server or Search
Domain addresses, click in the corresponding box and type them now.
• If you’re using a manual connection: Click the Configure IPv4 drop-
down list box and choose Manually. Then click in the IP Address,
DNS Servers, and Search Domains fields and enter the respective set-
tings provided by your ISP.
4. Click the PPP tab to display the settings shown in Figure 1-2.
5. In their respective fields, enter the account name, password, tele-
phone number, and (optionally) the service provider name and an
alternate telephone number provided by your ISP.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
In Book V, Chapter 1, I discuss these Internet settings in depth.

Using Ethernet hardware
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using a net-
work, cable modem, or DSL connection:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and choose Network.
2. Select Built-in Ethernet from the Show drop-down list to display the
settings that you see in Figure 1-3.
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
• If your ISP tells you to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP): Select Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-down list,
and your ISP can automatically set up virtually all the TCP/IP settings
for you! (No wonder DHCP is so popular these days.)
• If you won’t be using DHCP: Select Manually from the Configure IPv4
drop-down list box. Then enter the settings provided by your ISP in
the IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router, and DNS Servers fields.
4. If your ISP uses PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), click
the PPPoE tab to display the settings shown in Figure 1-4.

5. Mark the Connect Using PPPoE check box to enable it and then enter
the account name and password.
If your ISP includes the Service Provider name and a PPPoE Service
Name, you can enter those as well.
6. To allow everyone who uses your Mac to access the Internet with this
account, mark the Save Password check box to enable it.
I recommend that you enable the Show PPPoE Status in Menu Bar check
box. When you do, Mac OS X displays a menu bar icon that lets you
know the status of your PPPoE connection.
7. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
If you need help entering Internet settings or you want to know more about
what you’re actually doing, I discuss these settings in depth in Book V,
Chapter 1.
Connecting with a Dialup ISP (The Hard Way)
Before you leave the serene confines of this chapter, I’d like to demonstrate
how to use the Internet Connect application to connect to your ISP via your
internal modem. (As I mention earlier in this chapter, most connections
made over a network, DSL line, or cable modem won’t need to use Internet
Connect.) You can also use this application to connect if you’re using a DSL
line with PPPoE or an AirPort connection. Many ISPs that provide high-speed
access for Macs offer PPPoE, which provides more efficient communications
than the older PPP protocol that you might have used in the past. Further, if
you’re using an AirPort wireless connection, you can launch Internet
Connect to take advantage of an existing Internet connection available
through your wireless network.
To be honest, I always like Mac OS X to connect automatically when I’m
using a modem. I hate excess mouse movements, which usually lead to a bad
case of Rodent Elbow. To automate your connection, follow these steps:
1. Re-open the Network settings in System Preferences and choose
Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list.
2. Click the PPP tab (refer to Figure 1-2), click the PPP Options button,
and then enable the Connect Automatically When Needed check box.
3. Click OK.
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.
You can forget about using Internet Connect!

Connecting with a Dialup ISP (The Hard Way)
404
Follow these steps to connect to the Internet manually:
1. Open your Applications folder, launch the Internet Connect applica-
tion, and click the Internal Modem toolbar button, which displays the
Internal Modem dialog.
2. From the Configuration drop-down list box, choose Modem
Configuration, Built-in Ethernet (for a DSL PPPoE connection), or
AirPort.
3. Select the connection options for the hardware that you’re using:
• Modem connection: Type the telephone number provided by your ISP
into the Telephone Number text box and then type your password in
the Password box (if prompted). I recommend that you enable the
Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check box, too.
• PPPoE connection: Type your password in the Password text box 
(if prompted).
• AirPort connection: If you have an AirPort/AirPort Extreme card
installed, click the Turn AirPort On button (if AirPort is currently
powered off) and select the network that provides your Internet
access from the Network drop-down list box.
4. Click the Connect button, sit back, and watch the fun!
Note that you don’t have to click the Connect button if your AirPort 
(or AirPort Extreme) Base Station is already connected to your ISP.

O
kay, how many of you can function without e-mail? Raise your hands.
Anyone? Anyone at all?
I suppose that I can function without my Internet e-mail, but why should I?
Mac OS X includes a very capable and reliable e-mail client, Apple Mail
(affectionately called Mail by everyone but Bill Gates).
In this chapter, I discuss the features of Apple Mail and show you how
everything hums at a perfect C pitch. However, you’ll have to sing out,
“You’ve got mail!” yourself. Personally, I think that’s a plus, but I show you
how you can add any sound that you like.
Know Thy Mail Window
To begin our epic e-mail journey, click the Mail icon on the Dock. Figure 2-1
illustrates the Mail window. Besides the familiar toolbar, which naturally car-
ries buttons specific to Mail, you’ll find the following:
✦Status bar: This heading bar at the top of the Mail window displays
information about the current folder — typically, how many messages it
contains, but other data can be included as well.
✦Message list: This resizable scrolling list box contains all the messages
for the folder that you’ve chosen. To resize the list larger or smaller,
drag the handle on the bar that runs across the window. You can also
resize the columns in the list by dragging the edges of the column head-
ing buttons.

Know Thy Mail Window
406
To specify which columns appear in the message list, choose View➪
Columns. From the submenu that appears, you can toggle the display of
specific columns. You can also sort the messages in the message list
from the View menu; by default, messages are sorted by the Date
Received. (Alternatively, use Lazy Mark’s method: Just click the column
that you want to sort by.)
✦Drawer: The extension to the right of the main Mail window is the
Drawer. You can click any of the folders to switch the display in the mes-
sage list. The Drawer can be hidden or shown from the View menu by
clicking the Mailboxes button on the toolbar, or you can press the
Ô+Shift+M keyboard shortcut to hide and show it. The Drawer is also
automatically hidden when you maximize the Mail window.
✦Preview box: This resizable scrolling list box displays the contents of
the selected message, including both text and any graphics or attach-
ments that Mail recognizes.

Setting Up Your Account
407
Mail uses the following folders (some of which appear only at certain times):
✦Inbox: Mail you’ve already received.
✦Outbox: Messages that Mail is waiting to send.
✦Drafts: Draft messages waiting to be completed.
✦Sent: Mail you’ve already sent.
✦Trash: Deleted mail. Like the Trash in the Dock, you can open this folder
and retrieve items that you realize you still need. Alternatively, you can
empty the contents of the Trash at any time by pressing the Ô+K short-
cut or by choosing Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages.
✦Junk: Junk mail. You can review these messages or retrieve anything
you want to keep by choosing Message➪Transfer. After you’re sure
there’s nothing left of value, you can delete the remaining messages
straight to the Trash. (Junk mail filtering must be enabled from the Junk
Mail settings in Preferences before you’ll see this box.)
✦Import: Messages that you’ve imported from another e-mail application,
or an earlier version of Mac OS X Mail.
You can add new personal folders to the Drawer to further organize your
messages. Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox and then type the name for your
new folder in the Name box. Click OK to create the new personal folder.
Messages can be dragged from the message list and dropped into the desired
folder in the Drawer to transfer them. Alternatively, you can move ’em from
the Message list by selecting the messages that you want to move, choosing
Message➪Transfer, and then clicking the desired destination folder.
Also note that Spotlight has staked its claim with the Search box at the
upper right in the Mail toolbar.
Setting Up Your Account
By default, Mail includes one (or more) of these accounts when you first 
run it:
✦The account that you entered when you first installed Mac OS X: Go
back to the beginning — literally, Book I, Chapter 1 — to read about the
first use wizard that I discuss at the beginning of this book. If you
entered the information for an e-mail account, it’s available.

Setting Up Your Account
408
✦Your .Mac account: If you registered for a .Mac service account, it will
be included.
✦Upgraded accounts: If you upgraded an existing Mac OS system, your
existing Mail accounts will be added to the Accounts list in Mail.
Speaking of the Accounts list, choose Mail➪Preferences and click the
Accounts button to display the Accounts dialog that you see in Figure 2-2.
From here, you can add an account, edit an existing account, or remove an
account from Mail. Although most folks still have only one e-mail account,
you can use a passel of them. For example, you might use one account for
your personal e-mail and one account for your business communications. To
switch accounts, just click the account that you want to use from this list to
make it the active account.
Adding an account
To add a new account within Mail, click the Add Account button, which car-
ries a plus sign (see bottom-left, Figure 2-2) to open an Account wizard that
leads you through the process. ’Nuff said.
However, I’m a manual kind of guy — at least, that’s what I’m told — so I
should describe how to add an account from the Preferences dialog. Open
the Preferences dialog by clicking Mail and choosing Preferences; then click
the Accounts button on the Preferences toolbar. Follow these steps:
Figure 2-2:
The
Accounts
list, where
all is made
clear (about
your e-mail
accounts).

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Setting Up Your Account
409
1. Click the Add button at the bottom-left corner of the window, which
(also) carries a plus sign.
2. On the General Information panel, click the Account Type drop-down
list box and choose the protocol type to use for the account.
You can select an Apple .Mac account, a Post Office Protocol (POP)
account, a Microsoft Exchange account, or an Internet Message Access
Protocol (IMAP) account. If you’re adding an account from an Internet
service provider (ISP), refer to the set-up information that you received
to determine which is right. Most ISP accounts are POP accounts.
3. In the Description field, name the account to identify it within Mail
and then press Tab to move to the next field.
For example, Work or Mom’s ISP are good choices.
4. In the Full Name field, type your full name — or, if this is to be an
anonymous account, enter whatever you like as your identity — and
then press Tab.
Messages that you send will appear with this name in the From field in
the recipient’s e-mail application.
5. In the User Name field, type the username supplied by your ISP for
login to your e-mail account and then press Tab.
This is sometimes different from the username and password that you
use to connect to the Internet.
6. In the Password field, type the password supplied by your ISP for
login to your e-mail account.
Again, this might be different from your connection password.
7. Click Continue.
8. Click Continue on the Account Summary sheet.
9. Click Done on the Conclusion sheet.
You’re done! The new account appears in the Accounts list.
You can specify advanced settings for an account. I cover those in the sec-
tion “Fine-Tuning Your Post Office,” later in this chapter.
Editing an existing account
Need to make changes to an existing account? Choose Mail➪Preferences and
click the account that you want to change. Mail displays the same settings
that I explain in the preceding section.

Deleting an account
If you change ISPs or you decide to drop an e-mail account, you can remove
it from your Accounts list. Otherwise, Mail can annoy you with error mes-
sages when it can no longer connect to the server for that account. Display
the Mail Preferences window, select the account that you want to delete, and
then click the Remove button (which is graced by a minus sign).
Naturally, Mail will request confirmation before deleting the folders associ-
ated with that account. Click OK to verify the deletion, or click the Cancel
button to prevent accidental catastrophe.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
The heart and soul of Mail — well, at least the heart, anyway — is receiving
and reading stuff from your friends and family. (Later in this chapter, I show
you how to avoid the stuff you get promising free prizes, low mortgage rates,
and improved . . . um . . . performance. This is a family-oriented book, so
that’s enough of that.)
After you set up an account (or select an account from the Accounts list), it’s
time to check for mail. Use any of these methods to check for new mail:
✦Click the Get Mail button on the toolbar.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail in All Accounts or press Ô+Shift+N.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choose the specific account
to check from the submenu.
This is a great way to check for new mail in another account without
going through the trouble of making it active in the Preferences window.
Mail can also check for new messages automatically — more on this in the
upcoming section, “Checking Mail automatically.”
If you do have new mail in the active account, it appears in the Message list
(and the Mail icon on the Dock sports a bright red number indicating how
many new messages you’ve received). As you can see in Figure 2-3, new
unread messages appear marked with a dot (it’s blue) in the first column.
The number of unread messages is displayed next to the Inbox folder icon in
the Drawer.
Mail also displays the number of new messages that you’ve received on its
Dock icon. If you’ve hidden the Mail window or sent it to the Dock, you can
perform a quick visual check for new mail just by glancing at the Dock.

Reading and deleting your messages
To read any message in the message list, you can either click the desired
entry (which displays the contents of the message in the preview box) or
you can double-click the entry to open the message in a separate message
window, complete with its own toolbar controls.
To quickly scan your mail, click the first message that you want to view in
the list, and then press the down-arrow key when you’re ready to move to
the next message. Mail displays the content of each message in the preview
box. To display the previous message in the list, press the up-arrow key.
Mail also allows you to read your messages grouped within threads. A thread
contains an original message and all related replies, which makes it easy to
follow the flow of an e-mail discussion (without bouncing around within your
Inbox, searching for the next message in the conversation). Choose View➪
Organize by Thread, and the replies in the current folder are all grouped
under the original messages and sorted by date. To expand a thread, click
the original message to select it; then press the right-arrow key (or choose
View➪Expand All Threads). To collapse a thread, select the original message
and press the left-arrow key (or choose View➪Collapse All Threads).

to your iBook speak at the same time!) Simply select one message or a group
of messages and then choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking. Wowsers!
To delete a message from the message list, click the desired entry to select it
and then click the Delete button on the toolbar (or press the Del key). To
delete a message from within a message window, click the Delete button on
the toolbar.
Replying to mail
What? Aunt Harriet sent you a message because she’s forgotten where she
parked her car last night? If you happen to know where her priceless ’78
Pinto is, you can reply to her and save her the trouble of retracing her steps.
If Aunt Harriet isn’t in your Address Book yet, this is a good time to add her.
With the message entry selected in the list, choose Message➪Add Sender to
Address Book or just press the convenient Ô+Y keyboard shortcut. The
person’s name and e-mail address are automatically added to your Address
Book. To add more information in the Address Book, however, you have to
open that application separately. (Read through Book I, Chapter 6 for the
skinny on the Address Book.)
To reply to a message in Mail, follow these steps:
1. To respond to a message from the message list, click the desired mes-
sage entry and then click the Reply button on the toolbar.
To respond to a message that you’ve opened in a message window, click
the Reply button on the toolbar for the message window.
If a message was addressed not just to you but also to a number of dif-
ferent people, you can send your reply to all of them. Instead of clicking
the Reply button, click the Reply All button on the Mail window toolbar.
(This is a great way to quickly facilitate a festive gathering, if you get my
drift.)
Displaying all Mail headers
Mail actually hides the majority of the heading
lines that help identify and route an e-mail mes-
sage to its rightful destination. By default, 
all you’ll see is the filtered heading, which
includes only the From, Date, To, and Subject
fields. This is great unless for some reason you
need to display the entire message header in
all its arcane madness. If you do, press
Ô+Shift+H. You can toggle back to the filtered
heading by pressing the same shortcut.

You can also add carbon copies of your message to other new recipi-
ents, expanding the party exponentially; more on carbon copies later in
the section, “Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail.”
If you’d like to send your reply under a different account, click the
Account drop-down list box and choose the account. This is a handy
method of rerouting a message that you received with your home e-mail
account to your office account.
Mail opens the Reply window that you see in Figure 2-4. Note that the
address has been automatically added and that the default Subject is Re:
<the original subject>. Mail automatically adds a separator line in the
message body field that reads On <day><date>at<time>, <addressee>
wrote:, followed by the text of the original message; this is done so that
the addressee can remember what the heck he or she wrote in the first
place to get you so happy/sad/angry/indifferent. The original text is
indented and colored blue to set it apart. If you like, you can click in the
Subject line and change the default subject line; otherwise, the cursor is
already sitting on the first line of the text box, so you can simply start
typing your reply.

To choose the text from the original message that you want to include in
a reply, select the desired text in the original message before you click
the Reply button.
2. After you complete typing your reply, you can select text in the mes-
sage body and apply different fonts or formatting.
To change your reply’s formatting, click the Fonts button on the mes-
sage window toolbar. From the window that appears, you can choose
the font family, the type size, and formatting such as italic or bold for the
selected text. Click the Close button on the Fonts window to continue. 
(If you like menus, you can also choose Format from the menu and make
changes from there.)
To apply color to the selected text, click the Colors button on the mes-
sage window toolbar and then click anywhere in the color wheel that
appears to select that color. You can also vary the hue by moving the
slider bar at the right of the Colors window. After you find the color that
expresses your inner passion, click the Close button on the Colors
window to continue.
3. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar.
Mail displays a familiar file Open dialog. Navigate to the to-be-attached
file, select it, and click the Open button to add it to the message. (More
on attachments in the upcoming section, “Attachments on Parade.”)
4. When you’re ready to send your reply, you have two options. You can
click the Send button to immediately add the message to your Out
folder, or you can click the Save As Draft button to store it in your
Drafts folder for later editing.
After a message is moved to the Outbox folder, it is sent either immedi-
ately or at the next connection time that you specify in Mail Preferences
(more on this in the section, “Checking Mail automatically,” later in the
chapter). However, saving the message to your Drafts folder will not
send it. Read the following section for the skinny on how to send a mes-
sage stored in your Drafts folder.
When you reply to a message, you can also forward your reply to another
person (instead of the original sender). The new addressee receives a mes-
sage containing both the text of the original message that you received and
your reply. To forward a message, click the Forward button on the Mail tool-
bar instead of Reply or Reply to All.
If you don’t want to include the text of the original message in a reply,
choose Mail➪Preferences➪Composing and disable the Quote the Text of the
Original Message check box.

By default, Mail checks your spelling as you type and also underlines any
words that it doesn’t recognize. (Very Microsoftian.) I like this feature, but if
you find it irritating, you can turn it off. Just choose Mail➪Preferences➪
Composing and disable the Check Spelling as I Type check box.
Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
To compose and send a new message to someone else, follow these steps:
1. Click the New button on the Mail toolbar or choose File➪New Message
(or avail yourself of the handy Ô+N keyboard shortcut).
Mail opens the New Message window that you see in Figure 2-5.
Hey, what does MIME mean?
First, a note of explanation about Internet
e-mail. (Don’t worry about notes; you won’t be
tested on this stuff.) Decades back, Internet
e-mail messages were pure text, composed
only of ASCII characters — that means no
fancy fonts, colors, or text formatting. However,
as more and more folks started using e-mail,
the clarion call rang forth across the land 
for more attractive messages (as well as
attachments, which I cover in the section,
“Attachments on Parade”). Therefore, the
MIME encoding standard was developed. In
case you’re interested, MIME stands for
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions — a
rather cool (and surprisingly understandable)
acronym.
Originally, virtually all e-mail programs recog-
nized MIME, but then the Tower of Babel prin-
ciple kicked in, and now there are actually
multiple versions of MIME. Apple Mail uses the
most common variant of MIME, so most folks
who receive your e-mail should be able to see
them in all their glory (even under Windows).
However, if one of your addressees complains
that he got a message containing unrecogniz-
able gobbledygook and a heading that men-
tions MIME, he’s using an e-mail client
application that either doesn’t support MIME or
supports a different version. (Of course, that
person could have unknowingly turned off
MIME support.) You have two possible solutions:
You can ask the addressee to double-check
whether MIME is enabled on his end in their
e-mail application, or you can disable MIME
when sending a message to that particular
person. When you’re composing an original
message or a reply, you can use pure text by
choosing Format➪Make Plain Text. (Naturally,
this prevents you from doing anything fancy,
and files that you attach to a plain text message
might not be delivered correctly.)

2. Enter the recipient’s (To) address by
• Typing it in directly.
• Pasting it in after copying it to the Clipboard.
• Dragging an e-mail address from your Address Book.
or
• (My favorite) Clicking the Address button, which shows you the
scaled-down version of the Address Book (the Addresses window)
that you see in Figure 2-6.
From the Addresses window, click the address that you want to use and
then click the To button. To pick multiple recipients, hold down the
Command (Ô) key while you click the multiple addresses. Click the
Close button on the Addresses window to close it and then press Tab.
If you’ve got a huge number of entries in your Address Book, use the
Search field on the Addresses window toolbar, which operates just like
the Finder window Search box.

3. When Mail highlights the Cc field (the spot where you can send
optional carbon copies of the message to additional recipients), you
can type the addresses directly, use the contents of the Clipboard, or
display the Addresses window.
If you use the Addresses window, select the addresses that you want to
use and click the Cc button. Then click the Close button on the
Addresses window and press Tab.
Looking for the Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc) field? To display it, choose
View➪Bcc Address Field. (A blind carbon copy is a message sent to multi-
ple recipients, just like a regular carbon copy, but the recipients aren’t
listed when the message is displayed — that way, the other recipients
won’t know who else got a copy of the message.) You can also click the
small drop-down list box at the left side of the Subject field to toggle the
display of the Bcc Address Field.
4. In the Subject field, enter the subject of the message and then 
press Tab.
Your text cursor now rests in the first line of the message text box —
type, my friend, type like the wind! It’s considered good form to keep
this line short and relatively to the point.
5. When you’re done typing your message, select any of the text that
you’ve entered and use the toolbar features I describe in the earlier
section “Replying to mail” to apply different fonts or formatting.
Click the Fonts button in the message window toolbar to open a window
of formatting choices. (Click its Close button to continue.) If you like
menus, you can also click Format and make changes from there.

6. Add color to any selected text, if you like.
Just click the Colors button in the message window toolbar and make
choices there; when the hue is perfect, click the Close button on the
Colors window to continue.
7. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar, navigate
to the to-be-attached file in the dialog that appears, select the file, and
then click Open to add it to the message.
8. When your new message is ready to post, either click the Send button
to immediately add the message to your Out folder or click the Save
As Draft button to store it in your Drafts folder (without actually send-
ing it).
To send a message held in your Drafts folder, click the Drafts folder in the
Drawer to display all draft messages. Double-click the message that you
want to send, which will display the message window — you can make edits
at this point, if you like — and then click the Send button on the message
window toolbar.
If you don’t have access to an Internet connection at the moment, Mail
allows you to work off-line. This way, you can read your unread messages
and compose new ones on the road to send later. After you regain your
Internet connection, you might need to choose Mailbox➪Online Status➪
Go Online (depending on the connection type).
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
Spam — it’s the Crawling Crud of the Internet, and I hereby send out a life-
time of bad karma to those who spew it. However, chucking the First
Amendment is not an option, so I guess we’ll always have junk mail. (Come
to think of it, my paper mailbox is just as full of the stuff.)
Thankfully, the latest version of Apple Mail has a net that you can cast to col-
lect junk mail before you have to read it. The two methods of handling junk
mail are
✦Manually: You can mark any message in the message list as Junk Mail.
Select the unwanted flotsam in the message list and then click the Junk
button on the Mail window toolbar, which marks the message as you see
in Figure 2-7. (Ocean-front property in Kansas . . . yeah, right.) If a mes-
sage is mistakenly marked as junk but you actually want it, display the
message in the preview box and then click the Not Junk button at the
top of the preview box.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
419
✦Automatically: Apple Mail has a sophisticated Junk Mail filter that you
actually train to better recognize what’s junk. (Keep reading to discover
how.) After you train Mail to recognize spam with a high degree of accu-
racy, turn it to full Automatic mode, and it will move all those worthless
messages to your Junk folder.
You customize and train the Junk Mail filter from the Preferences dialog
(available from your trusty Mail menu); click Junk Mail to show the settings.
By default, Mail starts in Training mode, using the When Junk Mail Arrives,
Leave It in My Inbox option. This means that it takes its best shot at deter-
mining what’s junk. When you receive more mail and mark more messages as
junk (or mark them as not junk), you’re actually teaching the Junk Mail fea-
ture how to winnow the wheat from the chaff. In Training mode, junk mes-
sages are not actually moved anywhere — they’re just marked with a
particularly fitting, grungy brown color.
After you’re satisfied that the Junk Mail filter is catching just about everything
that it can, display this submenu and choose the Move It to the Junk Mailbox
(Automatic) option. Mail creates a Junk folder and prompts you for permission
to move all junk messages to this folder. After you review everything in the
Figure 2-7:
“Be gone,
sludge
demons of
Junk Mail!”

Attachments on Parade
420
Junk folder, you can delete what it contains and send it to the Trash folder.
To save a message from junkdom, click the Not Junk button in the preview
window and then drag the message from the Junk folder message list to the
desired folder in the Drawer.
If you don’t receive a lot of spam — or you want to be absolutely sure that
nothing gets labeled as junk until you review it — click the Enable Junk Mail
Filtering check box to disable it. (And good luck.)
By default, Mail exempts certain messages from Junk Mail status based on
three criteria: if the sender is in your Address Book, if you’ve sent the sender
a message in the past, or if the message is addressed to you with your full
name. To tighten up your Junk Mail filtering to the max, you might want to
disable these check boxes as well.
To reset the Junk Mail filter and erase any training that you’ve done, visit the
Junk Mail settings in Preferences again and click Reset. Then click the Yes
button to confirm your choice. To display the Junk rule and edit it if neces-
sary, display the Junk Mail settings and click Advanced. (I discuss filtering
rules at length at the end of this chapter.)
Attachments on Parade
Attachments are a fun way to transfer files through e-mail. However, remem-
bering these three very important caveats is imperative:
✦Attachments can contain viruses. Even a message attachment that was
actually sent by your best friend can contain a virus — either because
your friend unwittingly passed one along or because the virus actually
took control of your friend’s e-mail application and replicated itself auto-
matically. (Ugh.)
Is it a Mark’s Maxim, or is it a dire warning? (It’s both!)
Never — I mean never — send or receive attachments unless you
have an up-to-date antivirus scanning application running.™
✦Corpulent attachments don’t make it. Most corporate and ISP mail
servers have a 1–4MB limit for the total size of a message, and the
attachment counts toward that final message size. Therefore, I recom-
mend sending a file as an attachment only if it’s less than 1MB (or per-
haps 2MB) in size. If the recipient’s e-mail server sends you an auto-
mated message saying that the message was refused because it was too
big, this is the problem.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
421
✦Not all e-mail applications and firewalls accept attachments. Not all
e-mail programs support attachments in the same way, and others are
simply set for pure text messages. Some corporate firewalls even reject
messages with attachments. If the message recipient gets the message
text but not the attachment, these are the likely reasons.
With that said, it’s back to attachments as a beneficial feature. Follow these
steps to save an attachment that you receive:
1. Click the message with an attachment in your message list.
Having trouble determining which messages have attachments? Choose
View➪Columns and then click the Attachments item from the submenu
that appears to toggle it on. Now messages with attachments appear
with a tiny paper clip icon in the entry.
If Mail recognizes the attachment format, it displays or plays the attach-
ment in the body of the message; if not, the attachment is displayed as a
file icon.
2. To open an attachment that’s displayed as a file icon, click the file
icon, and then choose Open Attachment from the pop-up menu that
appears.
If you know what application should be used to open the attachment,
click the Open With button and choose the correct application from the
submenu that appears.
3. To save an attachment, hold down Control, click the attachment (how-
ever it appears in the message), and then choose Save Attachment
from the pop-up menu.
In the Save dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you want
to save the file and then click Save.
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
Like all other Apple software, Mail is easily customized to your liking. In this
section, I discuss some of the preferences that you might want to change.
Adding sound
To choose a sound that plays whenever you receive new mail, choose
Mail➪Preferences➪General. Either click the New Mail Sound drop-down list
box and choose one of the sounds that Apple provides or choose Add/
Remove from the drop-down list to choose a sound file from the Sounds
folder (which, in turn, is located within your Library folder). Choose None
from the drop-down list to disable the new mail sound altogether.

Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
422
Checking Mail automatically
By default, Mail automatically checks for new mail (and sends any mail in
your Out folder) every five minutes. To change this delay period, display the
General panel in the Preferences dialog, choose the Check for New Mail
drop-down list box, and then choose one of the time periods. To disable
automatic mail checking, choose Manually; you can click the Get Mail tool-
bar button to manually check your mail any time you like.
Automating message deletion
If you like, Mail can be set to automatically delete sent mail and Junk mes-
sages (as well as permanently erase messages that you relegate to the
Trash). To configure these settings, display the Accounts list in the
Preferences window, click the desired account, and then click the Mailboxes
Behaviors tab.
To delete Sent messages automatically, enable the Erase Copies of Sent
Messages When drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action.
You can choose to delete mail after a day, a week, a month, or immediately
upon quitting Mail. Alternatively, you can leave this field set to Never, and
Mail will never automatically delete any messages from the Sent folder.
To delete Junk messages automatically, click the Erase Messages in the Junk
Mailbox When drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action.
(They’re the same as the options available for Sent mail.)
To delete messages from the Trash, click the Erase Deleted Messages When
drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action — again, the
choices are the same as those for Sent messages.
Adding signatures
To add a block of text or a graphic to the bottom of your messages as your
personal signature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences➪Signatures.
2. From the Signatures pane that appears, click the Add Signature
button.
3. Type a descriptive name for the signature in the Description box and
then press Tab.
4. Type the signature itself in the text entry box or copy the signature to
the Clipboard and paste it into the text entry box.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Automating Your Mail with Rules
423
Because downloading a graphic in a signature takes long — and because
some folks still use plain text e-mail — avoid the temptation to include
graphics in your signature.
If you enter a block of formatted text, click the Make Plain Text button to
reduce those fancy fonts to plain text.
5. Click OK to save the signature.
6. If you have multiple signatures, click the Choose Signature drop-down
list to choose which one you want to use or to use them all randomly
or in sequence.
If you use specific signatures for different subjects, you can also enable the
Show Signature Menu on Compose Window check box, which allows you to
switch signatures from the Compose window.
Changing the status of an account
Sometimes you won’t be able to reach one of your accounts. For example,
maybe you’re on the road with your laptop and you’re unable to access your
office network. Apple Mail allows you to enable and disable specific
accounts without the hassle of deleting an account and then having to add it
again.
To disable or enable an account, choose Preferences➪Accounts and click
the desired account; click the Advanced tab and then enable (or clear) the
Enable This Account check box as necessary.
If you disable an account, you should also disable the Include When
Automatically Checking for New Mail check box to make sure that Mail doesn’t
display an error message. You can always check any account for new mail by
choosing Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choosing the desired account
name from the submenu.
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Before I leave the beautiful shores of Mail Island — “GILLIGAN!” — I’d be
remiss if I didn’t discuss one of its most powerful features: the ability to
create rules, which are automated actions that Mail can take. With rules, you
can specify criteria that can perform actions such as
✦Transferring messages from one folder to another
✦Forwarding messages to another address
✦Highlighting or deleting messages

Automating Your Mail with Rules
424
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Rules button on the 
toolbar.
Mail displays the Rules dialog.
2. To duplicate an existing rule, highlight it in the list and then click the
Duplicate button. (For this demonstration, however, create a rule from
scratch by clicking the Add Rule button.)
3. In the Description field, type a descriptive name for the new rule and
then press Tab to move to the next field.
4. Click the If drop-down list to specify whether the rule will be trig-
gered if any of the conditions are met or whether all conditions must
be met.
5. Because each rule requires at least one condition, click the target
drop-down list boxes to see the target for the condition.
These include whom the message is from or to, which account received
the message, whether the message is marked as junk, and whether the
message contains certain content. Select the target for the condition.
6. Click the Criteria drop-down list box to choose the rule’s criteria.
The contents of this drop-down list box change depending on the condi-
tion’s target. For example, if you choose From as the target, the criteria
include Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and so forth.
7. Click in the expression box and type the text to use for the condition.
For example, a completed condition might read
Subject Contains Ocean-Front
This particular condition will be true if I get an e-mail message with a
subject that contains the string Ocean-Front.
8. Add more conditions by clicking the plus sign button at the right of
the first condition.
To remove any condition from this rule, click the minus sign button next
to it. Remember, however, that every rule needs at least one condition.
9. To specify what actions will be taken after the condition (or condi-
tions) has been met, click the first Perform the Following Actions
drop-down list box to see the action that this rule should perform.
Then click the second drop-down list box and then select the action
for the rule.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Automating Your Mail with Rules
425
Choices include transferring a message from one folder to another, play-
ing a sound, automatically forwarding the message, deleting it, and
marking it as read.
Each rule requires at least one action.
10. Depending on the action that you select, specify one or more crite-
rion(a) for the action.
For instance, if I select Set Color as my action, I must then choose
whether to color the text or the background as well as what color to use.
Like the plus button next to the conditions, you can also click the plus
button next to the first action to perform more than one action. To
remove an action, click the minus button next to it.
11. When the rule is complete, click OK to save it.
Here’s an example of a complex rule:
If the message was sent by someone in my Address Book and the
Subject field contains the text FORWARD ME, forward the message to
the e-mail address fuadramses@mac.com.
This is a good example of an automated forwarding rule. With this rule in
place and Mail running on Mac OS X, any of my friends, family, or co-workers
can forward urgent e-mail to my .Mac account while I’m on vacation. To trig-
ger the rule, all the sender has to do is include the words FORWARD ME in the
message subject. And if the sender isn’t in my Address Book, the rule doesn’t
trigger, and I can read the message when I get home. Mondo sassy.
Each rule in the Rules dialog can be enabled or disabled by toggling the
Active check box next to the rule. You can also edit a rule by selecting it in
the Rules dialog and then clicking the Edit button. To delete a rule com-
pletely from the list, select it and then click the Remove button; Mail will
prompt you for confirmation before the deed is done.

 Adding Buddies
 Inviting a Buddy to chat
 Sending and receiving files via iChat AV
 Ignoring those who deserve to be shunned
T
hroughout man’s history, our drive has been toward communication —
from the earliest cave paintings, through written language, to the tele-
graph, the telephone, and the cellular all-in-one PDA that the guy in the SUV
in front of you is using . . . and he’s arguing with someone and he’s not
paying attention and . . . (whump).
So much for the learned and scholarly introduction — forget that silly cellu-
lar phone and your complicated calling plan! As long as you have Mac OS X
and an Internet connection, you can instantly chat with your friends and
family whether they’re across the aisle in another cube or halfway across
the world. And, by golly, if you both have a Web cam or digital video (DV)
camcorder connected to your computers, you’ll see each other in glorious,
full-color video! This modern marvel is iChat AV, and it fulfills the decades-
old promise of the video telephone quite well, thank you.
In this chapter, I show you how to gab with the following folks:
✦Others who use iChat AV (either on your local network or on the
Internet)
✦Anyone who uses AIM — that’s short for America Online (AOL) Instant
Messaging
✦Folks who participate in AOL chat rooms

Configuring iChat
428
Configuring iChat
When you first run iChat AV (by clicking the iChat icon in the Dock), you’ll
be prompted to create an iChat account. Type the first name (your name)
that you want to use in the First Name field, press Tab, and then type the
surname that you want to use. (Yes, you can even use Bullwinkle Moose —
just leave out the middle initial J.)
By default, iChat AV uses the .Mac account that you set up when you first
installed Mac OS X. In this case, your .Mac account name and password are
automatically entered for you, and you’re good to go. However, if you’re
already using AIM and you’d like to use your existing AIM account, click the
Account Type drop-down list and choose AIM; then enter your AIM name
and password instead.
iChat will also set up Bonjour (new name in Tiger) messaging automatically.
As you can read in Chapter 1 of Book V, think of Bonjour as plug-and-play for
your local network. In iChat, Bonjour messaging displays a separate window
where you can see (and yak with) anyone on your local network without
having to know his iChat name. That’s because Bonjour automatically
announces all the iChat AV users who are available on your network. If you
have others using iChat AV or AIM on your local network, go for this option;
if you’re not connected to a local network, however, Bonjour messaging isn’t
necessary. Also, if you’re on a public AirPort/AirPort Extreme network or if
you’re connecting to the Internet with a modem through dialup, I recom-
mend disabling Bonjour messaging. (For all that’s cool about AirPort and its
faster sibling AirPort Extreme, see Book V, Chapter 4.)
After you finish these configuration necessities, iChat AV displays the Buddy
List window (or, if you’re using Bonjour messaging, two windows) that you
see in Figure 3-1. Remember that your Bonjour window displays only those
iChat AV folks on your local network.
A few things to note here about the Buddy List window:
✦If you don’t like your picture, don’t panic. By default, iChat AV uses your
user account thumbnail image as your visual persona. However, you can
add a picture to your iChat iDentity — sorry, I couldn’t resist that — by
dragging an image to the well next to your name at the top of the Buddy
List window. If necessary, iChat AV will ask you to position and size the
image so that it will fit in the (admittedly limited) space. This picture is
then sent along with your words when you chat. In the figures for this
chapter, I borrow the smiling face of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Click your image to display your recent thumbnails. This way, you can
even use a different thumbnail image for each of your many moods.
(Geez.) Also, you can click Edit Picture from the pop-up menu and cap-
ture a new thumbnail with your iSight camera.

• Start a Text Chat (plain, old-fashioned chatting via the keyboard)
• Start an Audio Chat (chatting with your voice, using microphones)
• Start a Video Chat (the ultimate chat, where the parties can both see
and hear each other)
Using these buttons can handle about 90 percent of the commands that
you need to give while using iChat AV, so use ’em! (Note that the Bonjour
window doesn’t have an Add a New Buddy button because the Buddy
List in the Bonjour window is automatically populated by other iChat AV
folks on your local network.)
✦Hey, look, there’s an iChat menu bar icon! When you’re running iChat
AV, the application adds a balloon menu bar icon next to the clock dis-
play in the upper-right corner of your screen. Click it to display the
options that you see in Figure 3-2. You can change your online/offline
status, immediately invite a Buddy for a chat, or display the Buddy List
(which I discuss later in the section, “Will You Be My Buddy?”). The
menu bar icon appears only if you enable the Show Status in Menu Bar
check box. Click iChat in the menu and choose Preferences; then click
the General button in the Preference dialog.

Changing Modes in iChat AV
To launch iChat AV, you can click its icon from the Dock or launch it from its
iChat AV application icon (which you’ll find in your Applications folder). Or,
you can click its menu bar icon, which is grayed out when you’re offline. If
you’re not already familiar with the terms online and offline, here’s the
scoop: When you’re online, folks can invite you to chat and communicate
with you. When you’re offline, you’re disconnected: iChat AV isn’t active, you
can’t be paged, and you can’t chat.
Even when you’re offline, you can choose Available from the friendly balloon
Finder menu bar icon, which will automatically switch iChat AV to online
mode. Or you can click a Buddy name directly, which will automatically
switch iChat AV to online mode and open the paging window for that Buddy.
(Naturally, you have to have the proper network or Internet connection first.)
You can use another mode, Away, whenever iChat AV is running and you’re
still online but not available. For example, if I’m away from my Mac for a few
minutes, I leave iChat AV running but I switch myself to Away mode. My
Buddies get a message saying that I’m Away, so they won’t bother trying to
contact me. When I return to my computer, I simply move my mouse, and
Figure 3-2:
The iChat

leaps into
action.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Staying in Touch
with iChat AV
Will You Be My Buddy?
431
iChat AV intelligently inquires as to whether I’d like to return to Available
mode. You can also use the menu bar icon to switch from Away to Available
(or my other favorite mode, Twiddling My Thumbs). Refer to Figure 3-2 to see
these choices.
Speaking of modes, you, too, can create a custom mode — like Bored stiff! or
Listening to the Pointy-Haired Boss — and use it instead of the somewhat
mundane choices of Available and Away. To do this, display the Buddy List
window, click the word Available beneath your name (refer to Figure 3-2),
and a drop-down list appears.
To choose an existing mode, click it; modes with a green bullet are online
modes, and red bullet modes are offline modes. Click the Custom menu item
for either color to open an edit box; type the new mode there and then press
Return. The new mode is automatically added to your mode list. You can also
switch modes from this drop-down list. (You’ll notice in Figure 3-2 that I cre-
ated a custom mode called Getting Another Diet Coke... cAfFeInE fills my life.)
Will You Be My Buddy?
I know that question sounds a little personal, but in iChat AV, a Buddy is
anyone whom you want to chat with, whether the topic is work related or
your personal life. iChat AV keeps track of your Buddies in the Buddy List.
You can also add them to your Address Book or use the AIM entry in an
Address Book contact to generate a new Buddy identity.
To add a new Buddy, follow these steps:
1. Choose iChat➪Buddies➪Add Buddy, or click the Add Buddy button at
the bottom of the iChat AV window and click Add Buddy from the
pop-up menu, or press Ô+Shift+A.
iChat AV displays the sheet that you see in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3:
Add a buddy
from your
Address
Book.

Will You Be My Buddy?
432
2. To create a Buddy entry from an Address Book contact who has an
Instant Messaging username, click the entry to select it, and then click
the Select Buddy button.
3. To add a brand-new person who’s not already in your Address Book,
click the New Person button to display the sheet that you see in 
Figure 3-4.
4. In this new sheet, select the proper account type (either .Mac or AIM),
press Tab, and then type the person’s Instant Messaging account
name.
If you like, you can also add your own picture to represent that person
(instead of using the icon that he provides). Just locate the image file
that you want to use within a Finder window and drag the image to the
Buddy Icon well.
(Optional) You can also enter the person’s real name and e-mail address,
and iChat AV obligingly creates an entry in your Address Book for your
new Buddy. (Apple, you truly rock.)
5. Click Add to save the Buddy information.
Even when you add a new Buddy and that name appears in the Buddy List,
don’t be surprised if the name actually fades out after a few seconds — that
indicates that the person is offline and unavailable. You can also tell when a
person is available if her name appears with a green bullet in the Buddy List.
You can also specify a number of actions that iChat AV should take if a
Buddy logs in or out of Instant Messaging, or if a Buddy changes his or her
status to Available. To display these actions, click the desired Buddy’s entry
in your Buddy List and then press Ô+Shift+I. Click the drop-down list box at
the top of the Info dialog, click Actions, and then choose the event that
Figure 3-4:

433
should trigger the action from the Event drop-down list. Enable the desired
check box to specify whether iChat AV should play the sound that you
select, speak a line of text, and/or bounce the iChat AV icon on the Dock. (My
technical editor prefers, “Elvis has just left the building.”)
Chat! Chat, I Say!
Turn your attention to getting the attention of others — through inviting
others to chat. Good chatting etiquette implies inviting someone to a conver-
sation rather than barging in unannounced.
If you want to join an AIM chat already in progress, choose File➪Go to Chat
(or press Ô+Shift+G). Depending on the service being used, you might have
to specify both the type of chat and the specific chat room name.
At this point, it’s time to draw your attention to the green phone and video
icons next to each person in your Buddy List (as well as next to your own
name at the top of the list). If the green phone icon appears next to both
your name and your buddy’s name, you can enjoy a two-way audio (or
voice) chat. If both you and your buddy are lucky enough to have iSight or
DV cameras connected to your Macs, you can jump into a real-time, two-way
video chat, complete with audio.
If your Mac has a microphone or video camera hooked up but you don’t see
these icons, click the Audio menu and make sure that the Microphone
Enabled and Camera Enabled menu items are selected.
To invite someone, click the desired Buddy from the Buddy List, click
Buddies, and then choose Invite to Chat. (If your pointing thing has two but-
tons, right-click — or Control-click — on the Buddy in the list and click Invite
to Chat.) You can also click directly on the phone or camera icon next to the
person’s name in your Buddy List. iChat AV displays the Group Chat window
that you see in Figure 3-5, which also doubles as an Invitation window.
Figure 3-5:

Chat! Chat, I Say!
434
You can invite additional Buddies to enter the chat by clicking the plus button
at the bottom left of the Participants list and choosing another Buddy. If the
Participants list isn’t visible, click the View menu and choose Show Chat
Participants.
Type your invitation text into the entry box at the bottom of the window. If
you’d like to use bold or italic text, highlight the text and press Ô+B for Bold
(B) or Ô+I for Italic (I). You can also add a Smiley face to your invitation text:
Click in the desired spot in the text, click the Smiley button to the right of
the text entry field, and then choose the proper Smiley from the list. To send
the invitation text, press Return.
The recipient of your chat invitation can decline or accept your chat invita-
tion. You’ll be notified (as delicately as possible) if the chat has been declined.
To invite a Buddy to an audio chat, select that person in the Buddy List, click
the Buddies menu, and then choose Invite to Audio Chat (or One-Way Audio
Chat, if only one of you has a microphone). A video invitation works in a sim-
ilar fashion: Click Buddies and choose either Invite to Video Chat or Invite to
One-Way Video Chat, depending on the hardware available.
If the chat is accepted, iChat AV displays a message saying that the Buddy
whom you invited has joined the chat, and you now can begin the chat. 
You don’t have to alternate sending messages back and forth between 
participants — everyone in a chat can compose and send messages at the
same time — but I personally like to alternate when I’m chatting one-on-one.
See the volley in Figure 3-6. By the way, you might notice that AIM users are
represented by the AIM Running Dude icon (unless AOL changes it, or you
assign an icon picture of your own as I describe in the previous section).
You can resize the Chat window by using the handle at the bottom-right
corner, just like most other application windows in Mac OS X.

You can also change fonts and colors while composing a line of text. Simply
select the text and then choose Format➪Show Fonts or Format➪Show Colors
(or press Ô+T or Ô+Shift+C) to display the Fonts and Colors windows, respec-
tively. These windows can be resized and moved wherever you like.
To save the discussion in a chat, choose File➪Save a Copy As. In the dialog
that appears, type a name for the chat file, select a location where you want
to store the file, and then click Save. To automatically save transcripts of all
your chats, choose iChat➪Preferences and click Messages; then select the
Automatically Save Chat Transcripts check box. The transcripts are saved in
an iChats folder that’s created inside your Documents folder in your Home
folder.
When the iChat AV window is active, a number of display choices can be
made from the View menu, including
✦Show as Text: Each line that you write and receive in a chat can be 
displayed in balloons, just like your favorite comic — the default — or as
simple text.
✦Show Names and Pictures: Each line can be displayed with the individ-
ual’s picture, just the name, or both the name and picture.
✦Background display: Choose the Set Chat Background menu item to
choose a graphic to use for the Chat window. To return to the original
appearance, choose the Clear Background menu item.
Click the Buddy List, and the View menu offers a different set of controls:
You can sort your Buddy List by first name, last name, or availability; and
you can also toggle the display of offline Buddies. These options are also
available from the Buddy List toolbar.
To close a chat, click the Close button on the Chat window.
Sending Files with iChat AV
To send a file to a Buddy, click the desired entry in the Buddy List and then
choose Buddies➪Send a File. Alternatively, you can use the Ô+Option+F key-
board shortcut; right-click and choose Send a File; drag the file from a Finder
window to the person’s entry in the Buddy List; or even drag the file into the
text typing window. (How’s that for convenience?) A dialog appears to indi-
cate that the recipient is being offered a file transfer request. If the file
request is accepted by your Buddy, the transfer begins and is saved where
the recipient specifies on her system.

Eliminating the Riffraff
436
If a Buddy sends you a file, the Incoming File Request pane appears. You can
then either click the Decline button (to decline the file transfer) or the Save
File button (to save the incoming file to any spot on your system).
Always check any files that you receive from iChat AV with your antivirus
scanning software before you run them!
Eliminating the Riffraff
Here I need to explain something that I hope you won’t have to use — what I
like to call the Turkey Filter. (iChat AV is a little more subtle — you just ignore
people.)
To ignore someone in a chat group, click her name in the list and choose
Buddies➪Ignore Person. When someone is ignored in a chat group, you
won’t see anything that she types or have to respond to any file transfer
requests from that person.
If only it were that easy to ignore someone when he’s standing close to you.
Anyway, if the person becomes a royal pain, you can also choose to block
that person entirely. That way, the offensive cur won’t even know that you’re
online, and he can’t reach you at all. Click the person in the list and choose
Buddies➪Block Person — the deal is done.

 Using public files
I
f you ask the average Mac owner what’s available on the Internet, you’ll
likely hear benefits such as e-mail, Web surfing, Google, and instant 
communication via iChat AV. What you probably won’t hear is, “Convenient,
trouble-free storage for my files and folders.”
You might have tried to use one of the dozens of storage sites on the
Internet that allow you to upload and download files from a personal file
area via your Web browser. Unfortunately, these Web-based storage sites are
slow in transferring files, lacking in convenience, and typically offer only a
small amount of space. As a result, most computer owners decide that the
idea of online storage is neat . . . but impractical.
In this chapter, I show you what real online storage is all about. I’m talking
about iDisk, which is the online storage feature that’s integrated into the
Mac OS X Finder. No jury-rigged Web site is necessary (although you can use
one if you’re not on a Mac running Mac OS X). I’ll admit that online storage
won’t replace the hard drives on your Mac, but with a .Mac subscription,
you can easily make use of online storage for backups and sharing files with
your friends . . . from anywhere on the planet!
So how do you actually use iDisk? That’s the simple part! To use iDisk within
Mac OS X, just do what comes naturally — it works like any other removable
volume’s Finder window. You can copy and move files and folders to and
from your iDisk, create new subfolders (except in the Backup, Library, and
Software root folders, which are read-only), and delete whatever you don’t
need.

Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
438
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
To set up iDisk on your Mac OS X system, you’ll need a .Mac account. You
did create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial accounts
are limited to a maximum of 25MB of storage, and the trial account is active
for only 60 days. Therefore, if you decide that you like iDisk, you should 
subscribe to .Mac; a subscription increases your online treasure chest to
125MB of iDisk storage. To subscribe, visit www.mac.com and follow the
prompts to join from there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription fee
is $100 per year.)
With a .Mac account active, iDisk is automatically available. To see how
much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public folder,
open System Preferences, click the .Mac icon, and then click the iDisk button
to display the settings that you see in Figure 4-1. (You can also click the Buy
More button on this panel to subscribe to Apple’s .Mac service, or (if you’re
already a .Mac subscriber) add more than 125MB of storage.)
The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk
territory you’re using. (Note that the account shown in Figure 4-1 is an evalu-
ation account, so it shows only a total of 25MB.)
You can specify the access privilege level for other .Mac users from this
panel as well. Select the Read-Only radio button to prevent any other .Mac
user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read-Write radio
button to allow others to save files there.
Figure 4-1:

settings are
available
from System
Preferences.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Expanding Your
Horizons with iDisk
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
439
No matter which privilege level you choose, you can also set a password
that other .Mac users must type before they’re allowed access to your Public
folder — this is the very definition of A Truly Good Idea. (More on the Public
folder in the next section.)
If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking the Set
Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype the
word in the Confirm box to verify it; then click OK to save the change and
return to the .Mac System Preferences panel.
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
Unlike the physical hard drive in your Mac, your iDisk never needs format-
ting or defragmenting, and you’ll never have to check it for errors. However,
the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy creating your
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when you
use your iDisk? In earlier versions of Mac OS X,
your acre of storage farmland always sat on 
one of Apple’s iDisk file servers — perhaps in
Cupertino, perhaps elsewhere. These server
computers are especially designed to store 
terabytes (TB) of information (1TB equals
1,000GB), and they’re connected to the Internet
via high-speed trunk lines. (And yes, they do
have a firewall.)
However, you can elect to keep a local copy of
your iDisk storage area — usually called a
mirror — on your Mac’s hard drive. (Because
Macs have copious hard drives, reserving
125MB is no problem.) Before you scratch your
head wondering why you’re duplicating your
iDisk files on your computer, here’s the reason:
If you do decide to keep a local copy of your
files, you can work on them even when you’re
not connected to the Internet! Tiger automati-
cally synchronizes any files that you’ve updated
locally with your remote iDisk whenever you
connect to the Internet. (If you use multiple
Macs at different locations, think about being
able to access the latest copies of your files
from any of them, right from the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things
when you’re browsing the contents of your
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk
document; that’s because you’re working with
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any
changes that you make to the corresponding
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell that
things are updating when that funky little yin
yang, circular doodad — the thing next to your
iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating in its
animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on good
authority . . . that’s what the Apple software
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. To
disable the mirroring feature and return to the
remote-only operation of old, click the iDisk
Syncing On button on the iDisk settings panel
to turn it off. Remember, though, that with the
mirroring feature turned off, you must have an
Internet connection to use iDisk, and things will
move more slowly because you’re accessing
everything across the Internet.

Understanding What’s on Your iDisk

own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — the top 
level — of your iDisk at all, but you can create new folders inside most of the
root folders.
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you’ll find
hanging out in your iDisk:
✦Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created
with the .Mac Backup application. You can, however, copy the files in
this folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level of
safekeeping.
✦Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want
to store . . . things like spreadsheets and letters. No one but you can
access these items.
✦Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other .Mac features.
✦Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies
stored here to your Web pages. (I cover QuickTime like a blanket in Book
III, Chapter 7.)
✦Music: This is the repository for all your iTunes music and playlists, and
the contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star of
Chapter 2 in Book III.) Mine is stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that
Bach fellow.
✦Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, including
those that you want to use with iCards or your Web pages.
✦Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If
you’ve allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder
as well.
✦Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with Apple’s
HomePage utility — which is available to all .Mac members — or you
can use your own Web page design application and copy the completed
site files here.
✦Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to .Mac mem-
bers; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and com-
mercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the Software
folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop. Then you
can install and run the application from the local copy of the files.

441
Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of
the following ways:
✦From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk
from the submenu or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the iDisk icon in the Finder Sidebar.
✦Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by choosing
View➪Customize Toolbar.
After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from
anywhere in the Finder.
Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window. After you use one of these methods
in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on the Mac OS X Desktop;
Figure 4-2 shows the iDisk icon on the Desktop, the iDisk contents in a Finder
window, and its properties in the Get Info dialog. The iDisk volume icon
remains until you shut down or restart your Mac. (Alternatively, you can dis-
miss the iDisk volume icon from your Desktop using the same method that
you eject an external drive: Click the iDisk icon and press Ô+E, or click the
Eject button next to the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.)
If you’re using a remote computer with an Internet connection, you can log in
to the .Mac page at www.apple.com and use your Web browser to access the
contents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice you have.)
Figure 4-2:

tents of

I’m thinking.

Opening and Using iDisk
442
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to
use it because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Load, Save, or Save
As commands.
You can also open an iDisk’s Public folder — either yours or the Public folder
inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server. As I
explain earlier, if that person has set a password, you need to enter that
password to gain access to all of their iDisk folders. From the Finder menu,
choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly to their Public
folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If you choose the
former, Tiger prompts you for the other person’s member name and pass-
word; if you pick the latter, you need only enter the other .Mac member’s
account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required),
you’ll see the .Mac member’s Public folder.
You can also use the server address
http://idisk.mac.com/username-Public?
to connect to an iDisk from computers running Windows and Linux. Check
the Help for your operating system to determine how to connect to a
WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the Windows world). When
prompted for your access username and password, use your .Mac account
name and password. If you’re using Windows XP, Apple has provided an even
easier way to open an iDisk Public folder: Use iDisk Utility for Windows,
which you can download from www.mac.com.

W
hen I was designing the Table of Contents for this book, I seriously
considered leaving this chapter out. After all, more people use a Web
browser now than any other software application. Who really needs a guide
to mowing a lawn?
But then again, I suddenly thought of all the hidden features that folks don’t
know about Apple’s Safari browser — for example, the tips and tricks that
can help you organize your online visits. It’s a little like learning more about
the lawn mower itself: Even though you might not need tips on mowing, many
people don’t know how to remove the spark plug in the winter or how to
sharpen the blade so you can handle taller grass. Remember, magic is noth-
ing more than technology that someone understands.
In this chapter, I show you how to use those other controls and toolbar but-
tons in Safari — you know, the ones in addition to the Forward and Back
buttons — and you’ll discover how to keep track of where you’ve been and
where you’d like to go. (Oh, and did I mention that you’ll need an Internet
connection?)

Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
444
One note: Many authors have written entire books on Web browsing. As you
might guess, this chapter is far narrower in scope than those books — I’ve
got more ground to cover before dinner — and it doesn’t include every one
of Safari’s features. However, I think the coverage that you find here will
explain all that you’re likely to need for most surfing sessions.
Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 5-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from
the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon within your Applications folder.
Major sections of the Safari window include
✦The Address bar: You’ll find the most often-used commands on this
toolbar for things like navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching
Google. Plus, here you can type or paste the address for Web sites that
you’d like to visit. The Address bar can be hidden to provide you with
more real estate in your browser window for Web content. To toggle
hidden mode, press Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or
choose View➪Address Bar.

✦The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click. I show you later in
the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks” how to add and remove sites
from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you can toggle the
display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Bookmarks Bar, or
press Ô+Shift+B.
✦The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through all
the pre-game show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages are
actually displayed. Like any other window, the Content window can be
scrolled; when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail
(minimized) image of the Content window.
The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
✦The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the
mouse pointer is currently resting upon, like the address for a link or the
name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page
is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash).
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of 5 knows how to do . . .
but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just not be aware of all the
myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page from any of the fol-
lowing methods:
✦Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address bar and then
press Return.
If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. If
this is a new site, just keep typing.
✦Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
✦Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you
specify.
More on this in the section “Setting Up Your Home Page” later in this
chapter.
✦Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
✦Click a page link within another Web page.

Navigating the Web
446
✦Use the Google box in the Address bar.
Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
✦Click a Safari page icon on the Dock or in a Finder window.
For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the default Dock that takes
you to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
This trick only works on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with
the Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to
restore the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one page
to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding the rest.
However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need to return to
where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home page. Safari
offers these navigational controls on the Address bar:
✦Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to return
to the last page that you visited. Additional clicks take you to previous
pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t visited
at least two sites.
✦Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or
through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. The
Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
✦Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your home
page.

Not all these buttons and controls might appear on your Address bar. To
display or hide Address bar controls, choose View➪Customize Address
Bar. The sheet that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet
within a Finder window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to your
Address bar, or drag a control that you don’t want from the Address bar
to the sheet.
✦AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences
and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the pad-
lock icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the
site’s Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be
treated.
✦Text Size: Shrinks or expands the text on the page, offering smaller,
space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, easier-to-
read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which is labeled
with a small and large letter A.
✦Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh (reload)
the contents of the current page. Although most pages remain static,
some pages change their content at regular intervals or after you fill out
a form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy arrow),
you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every hour or
so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the Reload button
turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and you can click it
to stop the loading of the content from the current page. This is a real
boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can happen when you’re
trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site (especially if you’re
using a dialup modem connection to the Internet). Using Stop is also
handy if a page has a number of very large graphics that are going to
take a long time to load.
✦Add Bookmark: Click this Address bar button (which carries a plus
sign) to add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More
on this in a tad.)

Setting Up Your Home Page
448
✦Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine —
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click the
down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the drop-down
list.
✦Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari
window — dig that crazy printer icon!
✦Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button makes it easy to
alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display properly in
Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs — hence the name.)
When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the settings shown
in Figure 5-2; take time to enter a short description of the problem that
you’re having. (I also enable the Send Screen Shot of Current Page and
the Send Source of Current Page check boxes to give the Apple folks
more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) Then click the Submit
button to send the bug report to Apple.
Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your
Web surfing, especially if you’re using a dialup modem connection. However,
a large percentage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked to have never set
their own home page, simply using the default home page provided by their
browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare
your own freedom to choose your own home page:
1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, display
it in Safari.
I recommend electing a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popular
site.

You’ll see the settings shown in Figure 5-3.
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With drop-down list box

a blank page.
This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.
Visit your home page at any time by pressing the Home button on the
Address bar.
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you collect
bookmarks in Safari, you’re able to immediately jump from one site to
another with a single click on the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the
Bookmarks bar.
Figure 5-3:
Adding your

Adding and Using Bookmarks
450
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the
following:
✦Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
✦Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the book-
mark and also select where it will appear (on the Bookmarks bar or the
Bookmarks menu).
✦Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Address bar to the
Bookmarks bar.
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note
that doing this only adds a bookmark for the page corresponding to the 
link — not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark:
✦Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this sec-
tion, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its contents
and then click the bookmark.
Lean, fast, and mean — That’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want
you to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary)
pages! RSS Web sites display updated infor-
mation using a shortened list format, rather like
a newspaper headline, without unnecessary
graphics or silly advertisements. You can tell
when a Web site has RSS pages available
because Safari displays an RSS icon at the
right side of the Address box. (When you click
the RSS icon, the Web address switches to a
feed:// prefix — another indication that
you’re not in Kansas reading HTML pages 
anymore.)
To display more information about a news 
item on an RSS page, click the item headline.
Safari opens the corresponding Web page — 
yep, once again you’re back in the world of
HTML — and you can read the full story. To
return to the RSS feed, click the Back button 
on the Address bar. Naturally, RSS feed pages
can be bookmarked. In fact, Apple gives you 
a number of RSS sites that you can explore
immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose Safari➪
Preferences, and then click the RSS tab. By
default, Safari checks for updated RSS head-
lines every 30 minutes, but you can change this
to an hourly or daily check. (Of course, you can
also check for updates manually by reloading
the RSS page, just like you would any other
Web page.) New articles can be assigned any
color you like, and you can specify the amount
of time an item should remain on the RSS page
after it’s published.

✦Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the
buttons.
✦Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small opened
book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired bookmark.
The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 5-4 appears, where you
can review each collection of bookmarks at leisure.
The more bookmarks that you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks
menu and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized,
choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the
new folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collec-
tions, which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window
(or as separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag
bookmarks within the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and
then press Delete.

Downloading Files
452
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, typi-
cally you just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari
takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, which keeps
you updated with the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading,
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files on your Mac OS X Desktop,
which I like and use. To specify the location where downloaded files are
stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them automatically with an
antivirus program — follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To
drop-down list box.
3. Choose Other.
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
5. Click the Select button.
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your mouse
pointer over the image and hold down Control while you click. Then choose
Download Image to Disk from the pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts
you for the location where you want to store the file.
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtu-
ally any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve down-
loaded a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display
it, try loading the file within QuickTime. As you can read in Book III, Chap-
ter 7, QuickTime is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia players, and it can
recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that
page you forgot to bookmark!

Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
453
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an
address that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mention in the earlier sec-
tion, “Visiting Web Sites.”
If you’re worried about security and you’d rather not keep track of where
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file
in the upcoming section, “Handling ancient history.”
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and organ-
ize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit of com-
parison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online stores,
tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a tab
representing the new page appears under the Bookmarks bar. Just click the
tab to switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert to business
as usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the new page.)
Figure 5-5 illustrates a number of pages that I’ve opened in Safari using tabs.
Figure 5-5:
Hang on,

Saving Web Pages
454
To turn on tabbed browsing, choose Safari➪Preferences to display the
Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, select the Enable Tabbed
Browsing check box to turn on tabs.
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button
next to the tab’s title.
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to
disk in its entirety. (Just the text, mind you, not the images.) Follow these
steps:
1. Display the desired page.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.
4. From the Where field, navigate to the location where you want to
store the file on your system.
To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system,
click the button with the downward arrow.
5. Click Save to begin the download process.
After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of
background and text colors might conspire together to render your printed
copy practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale
setting (if it has one). Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select
the text on the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word
or AppleWorks, where you can print the page on a less offensive background
(while still keeping the text formatting largely untouched). You can also save
the contents of a page as plain text, as I just demonstrated.
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link to
the page, which is faster to send over a dialup Internet connection — choose
File➪Mail Contents of this Page/Mail Link to this Page. (From the keyboard,
press Ô+I to send the contents in an e-mail message, or press Ô+Shift+I to
send a link in e-mail.) Mail loads automatically, complete with a prepared
e-mail message. Just address it to the recipients and then click Send!

Protecting Your Privacy
455
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security,
both against outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around
your Mac. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
Although diminutive, the tiny padlock icon that appears in the top-right
corner of the Safari window when you’re connected to a secure Web site
means a great deal! A secure site encrypts the information that you send and
receive, making it much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain
things like credit card numbers and personal information.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the offer-
ings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal
information. Also, if you do a large amount of surfing, cookies can occupy a
significant amount of your hard drive space over time. (Not to mention that
some cookies have highly suggestive names, which could lead to all sorts of
conclusions. End of story.)
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to 
disable cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept all cookies. To
change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or CAP, for those who absolutely crave
acronyms), follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 5-6.

Protecting Your Privacy
456
3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
• Never: Block cookies entirely.
• Always: Accept all cookies.
• Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this default
option, which allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly with-
out allowing a barrage of illicit cookies.
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies
button.
The site that used that cookie will forget any information that it stored in
the file, meaning that you might have to take care of things manually, like
providing a password on the site that used to be read automatically from
the cookie.
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.
Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint).
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to
clean up your cache.

Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the
History menu, choose History➪Clear History.
Another built-in security feature can also help save your sanity: Safari can
block those incredibly irritating pop-up advertisement windows that are
automatically displayed by some Web sites. (I rank such Webmasters at the
same social level as spammers!) Click Safari and choose Block Pop-Up
Windows or press Ô+K — in case you’re visiting a site that actually uses
pop-up windows to your advantage, you can toggle off the block feature 
temporarily.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and click Block Pop-Up
Windows to toggle the menu item on.
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does some-
thing constructive with pop-up windows, like present a download or login
prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press Ô+K 
to toggle it off. Then press Ô+K again to turn pop-up blocking back on after
you’ve finished with the site.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the dangers of going online
 Using a firewall
 Avoiding trouble online
I
know that you’ve heard horror stories about hacking: Big corporations
and big government installations seem to be as open to hackers as a
public library. Often, you read that even entire identities are being stolen
online. When you consider that your Mac can contain very sensitive and 
private information in your life — such as your Social Security number and
financial information — it’s enough to make you nervous about turning on
your computer long enough to check your eBay auctions.
But how much of that is Hollywood? How truly real is the danger, especially
to Mac owners? And how can you protect yourself? The good news is that
you can easily secure your data from all but the most determined hacker —
in fact, depending on the hardware that you’re using to connect yourself to
the Internet, you might be well guarded right now without even knowing it.
In this chapter, I continue a quest that I’ve pursued for over a decade now —
to make my readers feel comfortable and secure in the online world by
explaining the truth about what can happen and telling you how you can
protect your system from intrusions.
One quick note: This chapter is written with the home and small business
Mac owner in mind. Macs that access the Internet through a larger corpo-
rate network are very likely already protected by that knight in shining
armor, the network system administrator. (Insert applause here.) Of course,
if you’re using Mac OS X in your office, you’re still welcome to read and follow
this material — especially if you have a laptop that could act as a carrier 
for viruses from home — however, check with your system administrator
before you attempt to implement any of the recommendations that I make.
What Can Really Happen?
Before I begin, I want to offer you a moment of reassurance and a little of 
my personal background to explain that I’m well qualified to be your guide
through this online minefield. (After all, you don’t want Jerry Lewis lecturing

you on how to maintain your Internet security. He’s a funny guy, though, 
convenez-vous?)
✦I’ve been running and managing all sorts of online systems since the
days of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), the text-based dinosaurs that
used to rule the online world in the late ’80s and early ’90s. (In fact, my
first book was on this very subject — and it contained a chapter on
viruses long before they were the darlings of the techno-media.)
✦As a consultant, I run Web sites and squash virus attacks for a number of
companies and organizations.
✦I run a popular Internet radio station that serves up ’70s hits in CD-quality
to anyone with a high-speed DSL or cable Internet connection and
a copy of iTunes. (More on this broadcasting revolution in Book III,
Chapter 2.)
✦I keep my own office network of six computers safe from attack while
still providing readers all over the world with Web sites and the afore-
mentioned radio station and BBS.
With that understood, here’s what can happen to you online without the
right safeguards, on any computer:
✦Hackers can access shared information on your network. If you’re run-
ning an unguarded network, it’s possible for others to gain access to
your documents and applications or wreak havoc on your system.
✦Your system could be infected with a virus or dangerous macro. Left
to their own devices, these misbehaving programs and macro com-
mands can delete files or turn your entire hard drive into an empty
paperweight.
If it smells phishy . . .
Ever heard of the word phishing? It’s a recently
coined Internet term, so you might not have
encountered it yet. Con artists and hackers
create Web sites that look just like major online
stores — including big names like eBay, PayPal,
and Amazon. These turkeys then send out junk
e-mail messages that tell you that you must 
log on to this Web site to refresh or correct
your personal information. As you’ve no doubt
already guessed, that information is siphoned
off and sold to the highest bidder. Your credit
card, your password, and your address. Luckily,
if you follow the tips that I give later in this
chapter in the section, “A Dose of Common
Sense: Things Not to Do Online,” you’ll avoid
these phishing expeditions!

✦Unsavory individuals could attempt to contact members of your
family. This kind of attack may take place through iChat AV, e-mail, or
Web discussion boards, putting your family’s safety at risk.
✦Hackers can use your system to attack others. Your computer can be
tricked into helping hackers when they attempt to knock out Web
servers and public access File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the
Internet. Along the same lines, that innocent Web server that you put
online could be misused by spam-spewing, online “entrepreneurs.” (Cute
name, right?)
✦Criminals can attempt to con you out of your credit card or personal
information. The Internet is a prime candidate for identity theft.
To be absolutely honest, some danger is indeed present every time that you
or any user of your Macintosh connects to the Internet. However, here’s the
good news. With the right safeguards, it’s literally impossible for most of
those worst-case scenarios to happen on your Macintosh, and what remains
would be so difficult that even the most die-hard hacker would throw in the
towel long before reaching your computer or network.
More of Mark’s totally unnecessary 
computer trivia
The term hacker dates far back in the annals of
the personal computer — in fact, it originally
had nothing to do with networks, the Internet,
or illegal activities at all . . . because In The
Beginning, there was no public Internet!
“Explain yourself, Chambers!” All right. The
original hackers were electronics buffs, ham
radio operators, computer hobbyists, and engi-
neers who built (or hacked) a working computer
out of individual components with a soldering
gun and a whole lotta guts. At the time, you
didn’t simply order a computer from Dell or visit
your local Maze o’ Wires store in the mall to
select your favorite system.
No, I’m talking about the mid-’70s, in the hal-
cyon time before IBM even introduced the IBM
PC (and when the only folks using the Internet,
which wasn’t called that back then, were 
military folks and researchers). Even the sim-
plest computer — really nothing more than a
glorified calculator by today’s standards — had
to be lovingly assembled by hand. These early
personal computers didn’t run software as we
know it. Instead, you programmed them manu-
ally through a bank of switches on the front,
and they responded with codes displayed on a
bank of lights. (Think about that next time you
launch Microsoft Word.)
Today, of course, the need to assemble a com-
puter from individual transistors is nonexistent,
and the word hacker has an entirely different
connotation — but don’t be surprised if you meet
an older member of your Macintosh user’s group
who’s proud to be an old-fashioned hacker!
(Look for the soldering gun, usually worn in a
holster like a sidearm.)

“Shields Up, Chekov!”
462
And you’re using a Macintosh — hackers and virus developers (there’s a
career for you) are traditionally interested only in “having fun” with PCs run-
ning Windows, so the likelihood that Tiger could pick up a virus is far less
than it would be if you were using Windows XP. Evidently, Apple just doesn’t
have the numbers to attract the attention of the Bad Guys . . . yet another
reason to enjoy the exclusive nature of the Mac universe! (Heck, I even know
a couple of fellow Mac owners who feel they just don’t need antivirus protec-
tion — but believe me, this is not an area where you want to be lax and lazy,
and you still need an antivirus application! More on antivirus software later
in this chapter.)
I also want to point out that virtually everyone reading this book — as well
as the guy writing it — really doesn’t have anything that’s worth a malicious
hacking campaign. Things like Quicken data files, saved games of Half-Life 2,
and genealogical data might be priceless to us, of course, but most dedicated
hackers are after bigger game. Unfortunately, the coverage that the media
and Hollywood give to corporate and government attacks can turn even Aunt
Harriet more than a little paranoid. Therefore, time for another of Mark’s
Maxims:
It’s not really necessary to consider the FBI or Interpol each time you
poke your Mac’s power button. A few simple precautions are all that’s
required.™
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
“Okay, Mark, now I know the real story on what can happen to my computer
online. So what do I do to safeguard my Macintosh?” You need but two essen-
tial tools to protect your hardware (besides a healthy amount of common
sense, which I cover in the upcoming section, “A Dose of Common Sense:
Things Not to Do Online”): a firewall and an antivirus program.
Firewall basics
A firewall is a piece of hardware or software that essentially builds an imper-
meable barrier between the computers on your side of the wall (meaning
your Mac and any other computers on your network) and all external com-
puters on the other side of the wall (meaning the rest of the Internet).
“But wait a second — if other computers can’t reach me and my Mac can’t
reach them, how can I use the Internet at all?” Ah, that’s the beauty of today’s
firewalls. By using a series of techniques designed to thwart attacks from the
outside, a firewall allows you to communicate safely, even monitoring what
you send and what you receive for later examination. Figure 6-1 illustrates
the basics of a firewall.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Staying Secure
Online
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
463
A firewall sounds grand and incredibly complex and highly technical — and
sometimes it is — but it can also be incredibly simple. For example:
✦You can spend anywhere from $50 to thousands of dollars installing
sophisticated firewall hardware and/or software.
or
✦You can activate your firewall by disconnecting your dialup, digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), or cable modem from the wall socket.
Believe it or not, both of those examples technically involve a firewall. In the
first case, the firewall is a physical, tangible presence on the network; in the
second case, the lack of a connection to the Internet actually acts as a fire-
wall. (Think of it as the Air Firewall.) I’ve spoken to a number of readers who
actually do this — however, if you’re running a Web site or downloading a
file from your company’s FTP site, yanking the connection when you head 
to bed isn’t an option. Therefore, most of us will install a physical firewall
through hardware or software.
Do I already have a firewall?
In some cases, you might already be using a hardware firewall and not even
know it. For example, many Internet-sharing devices include a built-in NAT
firewall. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it’s the most effec-
tive and popular hardware firewall standard in use by consumer devices. If

you’re using an Internet sharing hub or router, check its manual to determine
whether it offers NAT as a firewall feature — and if so, turn it on if NAT isn’t
enabled by default. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for more on Internet sharing,
routers, and firewalls.)
For instance, Figure 6-2 illustrates the configuration screen for my Internet
router. Note the options to disable port scanning and ping responses, which
are two tricks that hackers often use to detect what’s often called a hot 
computer — meaning that the computer can be identified and is accessible to
attack. (Wireless networks are notoriously hot — for more information on
securing your wireless connections, visit Book V, Chapter 4.)

Using the internal Mac OS X firewall
Mac OS X includes a powerful internal firewall called IPFW. I’m happy to say
that Tiger makes IPFW very simple to use! (In earlier versions of Mac OS X,
IPFW — actually a UNIX application — was completely command driven
from the Terminal.) The Mac OS X firewall is configured through System
Preferences — find more information on setting up IPFW in Book V, Chapter 2.
Using a commercial software firewall
You’ll also find a number of popular alternatives to Tiger’s built-in firewall on
the market. Here are two commercial software firewall applications that are
proven to be both effective and easy-to-use:
✦Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall, $70 (www.symantec.com):
Symantec provides both antivirus and firewall protection for the PC 
and Macintosh. Frequent updates and top-of-the-line technical support
ensure that your firewall stays current and that you can get help when
you need it.
✦Intego, NetBarrier X, $60 (www.intego.com): NetBarrier X comes with 
a number of preset configurations that allow you to choose a basic fire-
wall for your network environment with a single click.
Whether you set up IPFW, a shareware firewall, or a commercial firewall, visit
a favorite site of mine on the Web: http://grc.com, the home of Gibson
Research Corporation. There you’ll find the free online utility ShieldsUP!!,
which will automatically test just how tight your firewall is and how suscep-
tible your Mac could be to hacker attacks. Visit this site often because this
service is updated periodically to reflect new hacking techniques.
Antivirus basics
Next, consider your antivirus protection. Viruses are typically transmitted
through applications — you run a program, and the virus is activated.
(Although not the traditional definition of a virus, both scripts and macros
can be used to take control of your system and cause trouble, as well.)
Therefore, you need to closely monitor what I call The Big Three:
✦Web downloads: Consider every file that you receive from the Internet
as a possible viral threat.
✦Removable media: Viruses can be stored on everything from CD-ROMs
and DVD-ROMs to Zip disks and even archaic floppy disks.
✦E-mail file attachments: An application sent to you as an e-mail attach-
ment is an easy doorway to your system.

“Shields Up, Chekov!”
466
Horrors! Mac OS X has no built-in antivirus support. (Then again, neither
does Windows XP.) However, a good antivirus program will take care of any
application that’s carrying a virus. Some even handle destructive macros
within documents. Make sure that the antivirus program that you choose
offers real-time scanning, which operates when you download or open a file.
Periodic scanning of your entire system is important, too, but only a real-
time scanning application like Norton AntiVirus can immediately ensure that
the StuffIt archive or the application you just received in your e-mail Inbox is
actually free from viruses. (Oh, and don’t forget that many of the Software
Updates released by Apple for Tiger will plug security holes in our favorite
operating system.)
Virus technology continues to evolve over time, just like more beneficial
application development. For example, recently a virus has been discovered
that’s actually contained in a JPEG image file! With a good antivirus applica-
tion that offers regular updates, you’ll continue to keep your system safe
from viral attack.
I heartily recommend both Norton AntiVirus from Symantec and Intego’s
VirusBarrier X (as shown in Figure 6-3). Both programs include automatic
updates delivered while you’re online to make sure that you’re covered
against the latest viruses.

A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
One more powerful weapon that you can use to make sure that your Mac
stays safe from unlawful intrusion is this: Practicing common sense on the
Internet is just as important as adding a firewall and an antivirus application
to Mac OS X.
With this in mind, here’s a checklist of things that you should never do while
you’re online:
✦Never download a file from a site you don’t trust. And make sure that
your antivirus software is configured to check downloaded files before
you open them.
✦Never open an e-mail attachment until it’s been checked. Don’t give in
to temptation, even if the person who sent the message is someone you
trust. (Many of today’s macro viruses actually replicate themselves by
sending copies to the addresses found through the victim’s e-mail pro-
gram. Of course, this problem crops up regularly in the Windows world,
but it’s been known to happen in the Macintosh community as well.)
✦Never enter any personal information in an e-mail message unless 
you know the recipient. Sure, I send my mailing address to friends and
family, but no one else. In fact, even e-mail can be intercepted by a deter-
mined hacker, so if you’re sending something truly important, use an
encryption application like PGP Personal Desktop (www.pgp.com).
✦Never enter any personal information on a Web site provided as a link
in an e-mail message. Don’t fall prey to phishing expeditions. Some of
these e-mail message/Web site combinations look authentic enough to
fool anyone! No reputable online company or store is going to demand
or solicit your personal information through e-mail or through a linked
Web site. In fact, feel free to contact the company through its real Web
site and report the phishing attempt!
✦Never include any personal information in an Internet newsgroup
post. After all, these posts can be viewed by anyone with a newsgroup
account, so there’s no such thing as privacy in a newsgroup. (For a
glimpse of just how long a newsgroup post can linger in the great Internet
continuum, visit www.google.com, click the Groups button, and search
for your name. I can pull up newsgroup messages that I posted back in
1995!)

A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
468
✦Never buy from an online store that doesn’t offer a secure, encrypted
connection when you’re prompted for your personal information and
credit card number. If you’re using Internet Explorer or Netscape, you
can tell when you’re using a secure connection by checking the status
bar at the bottom of the Web browser window: If a small padlock icon
appears in the status bar, the connection is encrypted and secure.
If you’re using Apple’s Safari browser, the padlock icon appears at the
top-right corner of the Safari window.
✦Never divulge personal information to others over an iChat AV 
connection.
✦Never use the same password for all your electronic business. Use dif-
ferent passwords that include both letters and numbers, change them
often, and never divulge them to anyone else.
✦Never give anyone else administrative access to your Web or FTP
server.
✦Never allow any type of remote access to your Macintosh or your net-
work without testing that access first; restrict that access to visitors
whom you trust.

Internet hacker attacks — in Book V. I cover System Preferences that can

I
n the not-so-distant past — I’m talking 10–15 years ago — networks were
found only in huge companies that had the money and workforce to pay
for and maintain them. But now, as technology rolls on, a home or small
office network is both very affordable and relatively easy to create. In this
chapter, I introduce you to this helpful beastie: You discover what networks
are, what you can do with them, and how to set up a small network of your
own for your home or small business.
Networks can be used for many things. Computers exchange all types of data
over a network: files that you want to send between computers or to net-
worked printers; streaming audio or video broadcasts; data for multiplayer
computer games; or even a private company Web site (typically called an
intranet). Anything that you can imagine that would involve moving data
between multiple computers can be done by using a network.
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
First, let me define network. In a nutshell, a network is a combination of hard-
ware, cables, and software that allows computers and printers to talk to
each other. (Heck, you don’t even need cables with a wireless network, as I
show you in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.) To have a network, you need the
right hardware and software. Some of the hardware and most of the soft-
ware that you’ll need probably came with your Mac, depending on which
Mac you have. As you progress through this chapter, you’ll discover every-
thing that’s required to set up your network so that you can pick up any
additional parts you need. Any good-sized computer store (either the brick-
and-mortar or online variety) has everything that you need to get up and
running.

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
472
Now, back to the requirements: You need the right hardware and software to
make your network sing. This section covers each component with a descrip-
tion about the role that each part plays on the network and other good stuff
that you’ll want to know to get your network right the first time.
Something to network
Okay, this might be obvious, but I’m nothing if not thorough. The first thing
that you need to build a network is . . . well . . . stuff! That’s right, you need to
have devices that you want to network. Most times this will be computers
(whether Macs or PCs running Windows/Linux/UNIX), printers, personal dig-
ital assistants (PDAs), and other standalone, network-capable devices (such
as file servers and shared tape back-up drives).
Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card, or NIC, is a hardware device that your computer uses
to talk to the rest of the network. The NIC connects to the network cabling,
and it speaks the language of electronics, sending data around the network.
Nowadays, most networks use the Ethernet networking protocol, and most
NICs are Ethernet-compatible. Most modern Macs have an Ethernet NIC built
right in that, in fact, isn’t really a card at all but something built right onto
the Mac’s main system board. If you have an older Mac, say one bought
before 1998, you can purchase an add-on NIC at any computer store.
Hub or switch
So you have an assortment of devices in your home or small office that you’ve
decided to network. How do you make them all interconnect? Although you
could connect just two computers together by using nothing more than a
single crossover cable, you need fancier hardware to connect more than two
computers: namely, a hub or a switch. The hub or the switch, used to con-
nect everything, is the focal point of the network. Without a hub or switch,
you wouldn’t have a network.
Hubs
A hub is a small box that has a bunch of Ethernet ports on it. A port is really
just like an Ethernet NIC on your computer, but a hub or switch has lots of
them. Inside, a hub connects all those Ethernet ports so that the talking
(sending) wires from each port connect to the listening (receiving) wires on
all other ports — therefore, when one computer talks, all others listen. As a
side effect of how hubs work, if more than one computer tries to talk at once,
a collision happens. Collisions are a Bad Thing: The data that was being sent
by the two computers is destroyed and has to be re-sent.

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small
Network
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
473
Although they might seem relatively harmless, collisions can really take a
toll on your Ethernet network. When data starts flying around your network,
collisions will take over and limit the amount of data that you can get through
the network. (My technical editor compares this problem with dining in a
noisy restaurant while you endeavor to listen to three conversations at once.)
Typically you’ll only be able to use about 40 percent of the total speed, or
bandwidth, of the hub. With the cost of switches barely above that of hubs,
you really have little reason to get a hub instead of a switch.
Setting up a hub or switch (and therefore giving birth to your network, which
sounds more painful than it is) is usually no more difficult than connecting 
a power cable to the device and then plugging in your computers with their
own Ethernet cables. You’ll see various lights on the hub — usually a power
light indicating that the hub is powered on and operational. You’ll also see
Thirty-nine flavors of Ethernet . . . 
but no Rocky Road
Ethernet standards allow for operation at dif-
ferent speeds. Because the Ethernet standard
has improved over time, some older Ethernet
devices support only the older (slower) speeds.
Ethernet’s speed is rated by how much data it
can transfer in a second — usually in millions
of bits per second, or megabits per second
(Mbps). Originally, Ethernet was designed to
run at 10 Mbps. Now there are three different
speeds of Ethernet: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000
Mbps, and even faster.
1000 Mbps Ethernet — also called Gigabit
Ethernet or just Gigabit for short — is still a bit
on the expensive side for small home or office
networks. All consumer-level Gigabit Ethernet
NICs also support running at 10 Mbps or 100
Mbps, so you will hear them called 10/100/1000
Ethernet NICs. PowerBook G4s and G4/G5
towers come with a 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC
built in, but the iMac, iBook, Mac Mini, and
eMac still come with just 10/100 Ethernet NICs
built in. Although Gigabit NICs are now priced
under $100, most of the devices that can con-
nect Gigabit NICs still cost hundreds of dollars.
That fact, coupled with the reality that most
computer systems can’t really even handle or
dish out that much data, makes Gigabit Ethernet
a choice for only those wanting an extremely
high-end and costly network.
NICs and other Ethernet equipment that only
handle 10 Mbps are rapidly becoming obsolete
because virtually all the modern NICs and other
Ethernet hardware support both 10 Mbps and
100 Mbps. Most times, you will see this labeled
as 10/100 Ethernet. For your home networking,
you probably want to invest in 100 Mbps or
10/100 Mbps.
Remember: Keep your eye out for Ethernet
NICs and equipment that handle only 100 Mbps.
You won’t see it much, but be wary because it
can’t interconnect with 10 Mbps Ethernet NICs
and equipment. I advise against buying it —
stay compatible, and you’ll be a happy puppy.

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?

lights that correspond to each port on the hub — these lights tell you what’s
going on in the hub. For instance, you normally see the following types of
lights:
✦Link light: Each port on a hub should have a link light. Link lights simply
tell you which ports have something alive connected to a given port: That
is, a device is connected and powered on. On hubs that support 10 and
100 Mbps, the speed light is also used to indicate a link, so there isn’t a
separate link light.
✦Speed light: Each port on the hub should have a speed light. On hubs
that support both 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps, this tells you the speed of the
device at the other end. Some hubs have different lights for different
speeds, and some use a single light and make it different colors for dif-
ferent speeds.
✦Activity light: When one computer speaks, they all hear it. Typically, an
entire hub has only one activity light for the entire hub, indicating that
someone is speaking. With heavy traffic, the light could appear solid.
✦Collision light: Just like the activity light, collisions affect everything
connected to the hub, so logic dictates having only one collision light for
the entire hub. This light will flash whenever a collision occurs, which
can happen even with only two devices attached. When you add more
devices, you get more collisions; if this light stays on most of the time,
look into getting a switch (which I describe in the next section).
Switches
A hub is a relatively simple way to connect a bunch of cables to allow com-
puters to talk. (They’re not particularly intelligent or efficient creatures.) 
A hub just receives network data on one port and sends (broadcasts) a 
copy out through all the other ports. A switch, on the other hand, is a more
advanced “post office” for your network because a switch uses the informa-
tion in the network data to eliminate collisions and thus increase the effi-
ciency of your network.
Bear with me whilst I spew techno-talk for a paragraph or two. When an
Ethernet switch receives a frame — that’s the name for a standard unit, or
packet, of network data — it reads the label on the frame to see the return
address of the computer that sent the frame. In a short amount of time (after
being turned on and watching the data move around), a switch learns which
computer is located on which port. Then, whenever data comes into the
switch, it looks at the header (some information on the front of all frames,
much like a mailing label on a package that you send) and sees which com-
puter should receive the frame. The switch then sends the frame out the
port for that computer only.

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
475
This is A Good Thing. Instead of forcing all computers on the network to
listen while one Mac speaks (like a hub does) — known as half-duplex — a
switch can actually send the data directly to the only computer that needs
to hear it. This gets rid of the evil collisions, allowing all the computers to
speak and talk at the same time (full-duplex). Now, twice as much informa-
tion can be shoved around because a computer can now send and receive
data at the same time. This is a major breakthrough and can happen only on
a switch.
Just how much of a performance improvement do you get with a switch
compared with a hub? On average, you’ll move from a 100 Mbps hub that
can handle an average of 5 Mbps of traffic per device (assuming that eight
computers are communicating at once) to a 100 Mbps switch that can
handle 200 Mbps per device (no matter how many devices are connected).
That’s a speed increase of 4,000 percent, leading me to another inescapable
Mark’s Maxim:
Buy a switch for your network, and say goodbye to collisions!™
Cables
Cables are the ties that bind . . . literally. Cables are used to connect the NIC
card on each computer to the central hardware of the network: namely, hubs
(which you don’t really want) or switches (which you do want). With a little
experience, you’ll be a cable-wielding superhero with hundreds of feet of
cable draped across every piece of furniture in your place for your first LAN
party. (A LAN party, by the way, is when way too many techies bring their
computers into a very small space, connect them, and play games for 48
hours straight. Oh, and we eat a lot, too. Good stuff!)
Here’s the scoop on what kind of cables to use. Technically, you can run 10
Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable (like a super-version of the wire that you use
for your telephones). Some networks still use coaxial cable (the kind of cable
that you use to connect your TV to your cable service), but coaxial is no
longer used for home and small office networks like yours or mine. You can
run 100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable or fiber optic cable.
Although you can do 10/100 and most times 100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5
cable, any new cables that you buy should be Cat5E — which I talk about in
the following section — because it is specifically meant to be used with 1000
Mbps Ethernet.
I’m sure that you noticed that the common denominator here is the Cat5
cable. Although you could get by using coaxial cable, it’s pretty much gone
out of style as a network cable because it’s limited to 10 Mbps Ethernet. In
fact, it’s very hard to find a NIC with a coaxial connection any more. Fiber

Setting Up Your Network
476
optic cable, although supporting speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and even 10
Gbps, is much more expensive and more difficult to install.
Hey, did I mention that you can eschew cables entirely? For more informa-
tion on the lean, mean world of wireless networking, see Chapter 4 of this
mini-book.
Be sure to buy straight-through Cat5E cables (also called patch cables) and not
crossover cables, which are only used in certain circumstances. Crossover
cables are mainly used to connect two computers directly together (to form
a tiny, two-computer network), connect a cable/DSL modem directly to a com-
puter, or connect multiple switches.
Cat5 cable supports speeds of 100 Mbps. 1000 Mbps Ethernet, of course, is
designed to run ten times faster than that; luckily enough, it was engineered
to be compatible with 90 percent of Cat5 installations. Having said that, some
Cat5 cable doesn’t stick to the stringent specifications that 1000 Mbps
Ethernet requires. The newer version of Cat5 cable is Category 5 Enhanced,
or Cat5E for short. Cat5E is recommended for any new installation because 
it can easily handle 10/100 Mbps Ethernet and yet can handle 1000 Mbps
Ethernet as well. Even if you’re using 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, you can upgrade
someday to 1000 Mbps without having to worry about upgrading your cabling.
Setting Up Your Network
After you collect the hardware components listed earlier in this chapter,
you’re ready to connect things. Here’s a quick list of things to do to get your
network fired up:
1. Find the best location for placing your hub or switch.
To keep costs down, try to place the hub or switch in a location close 
to a power outlet that’s centrally located so that you can use the least
amount of cable. If cost isn’t an issue, hide the unit in a closet and just
run all the cables along the walls to the hub or switch. And if cost really
isn’t an issue, get your house fully wired with Cat5E cable.
2. Plug the hub or switch into the power socket.
Some hubs and switches come on automatically when you plug them in
and can never be turned off. Others have a power switch that you need
to turn on the first time that you plug them in.
3. Verify that the hub or switch is working by looking at the lights on the
front. Check the manual that came with the hub or switch to see what
light configuration is normal for that particular unit.

Book V
Chapter 1

Network
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
477
Until you have computers or printers attached to it, you might just have
a status light that shows the hub is powered on. But if the lights on your
unit don’t match up with what the manual says, you could have a bum
unit that you need to return.
4. Verify that all your devices are near enough to the hub or switch to be
connected by your cables and then turn them all on.
5. Get one of your Cat5E cables and connect one cable from the Ethernet
jack on your computer, usually on the side or back, to an open port on
the hub or switch.
You should see a link light or speed light come on that verifies that the
two devices sense each other. (You might also have a link light on your
NIC where you plug in the cable, but that depends on the Mac that you’re
using.)
6. Repeat Step 5 until each device is attached to the hub or switch.
Congratulations, you’re a network technician! (Don’t forget to call your
friends and brag.) The first phase of the network, the physical connection, 
is complete; the next step is the configuration of Mac OS X.
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
Take a deep breath, there’s no need to panic — in fact, configuring your net-
work software basically involves entering a lot of numbers and other stuff in
dialogs. (In fact, most folks can just allow Tiger to take care of network set-
tings automatically.) But just so you’ll understand what’s involved, this sec-
tion explains what those numbers are, what they do, and why you ought to
know it. Because this is a Mac OS X book, I stick with configuring Macs run-
ning the Big X.
TCP/IP
First things first: Protocol is just the techno-nerd word for a set of rules or 
a language. A protocol is a language that computers use to communicate.
Without protocols, the computers on your network would never be able to
speak to each other even though you have NICs, cables, and a hub or a
switch. The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the TCP/IP suite is what you’re
really interested in because it’s the most important part of your network
configuration chore.
IP addresses
IP addresses are like street addresses for computers on a network. Each com-
puter on the network has an IP address, and it needs to be unique because
no other computer can share it. When a computer wants to communicate

Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
478
with another computer, it can simply send the data on the network in a nice
package that has its address as well as the address of the computer that it’s
trying to talk to. (Remember frames? If not, take a refresher in the earlier
section, “Switches.”)
An IP address is just a number, but it’s written in a strange way. (Go figure.)
All IP addresses are written as four numbers between 0 and 255 with a dot
(period) between them: For instance, a common IP address that you might
run into is 192.168.0.1. As everyone knows, engineers can’t sleep unless they
have three or four ways to write the same thing, including IP addresses. The
form shown above — which is by far the most common — is dotted notation.
Each number, like 192, is an octet.
Don’t worry too much about this stuff: You don’t have to remember terms like
octet to create your own network. They could be helpful, however, if some-
thing goes wrong and you need to place a call to tech support. Plus, you can
impress the computer salesperson (gleefully called a wonk by Mac power
users) at your local Maze ’o Wires store with your mastery of techno-babble.
IP addresses at home versus on the Internet
One very important thing to keep in mind is that the Almighty IP Address
Police — Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (www.iana.org) — has broken
IP addresses into groups. The two main types of IP addresses are public and
private:
✦Public IP addresses can be used on the Internet and are unique through-
out the whole world.
✦Private IP addresses are used in homes or businesses and cannot be
used to talk to the public Internet. Private IP addresses are used over
and over by many people and most commonly take the form 192.168.x.x.
You will almost always get a public IP address from your Internet service
provider (ISP), whether you’re using a cable modem, digital subscriber line
(DSL), or a regular dialup modem. If you use a cable/DSL router or some-
thing like IPNetShareX to share your Internet connection among multiple
computers, you’ll be using private IP addresses on your network while 
using a single public IP address to talk to the Internet (more on that later 
in Book V, Chapter 5).
“Great! I get an IP address, put it into my Network settings in System
Preferences, and off I go. Right?” Well, you’re close, but here are a few other
pieces of information that you might need before you can go surfing around
the world:

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small
Network
Configuring Network System Preferences
479
✦Default gateway: When you send information to other networks —
whether in another building or around the world on the Internet — your
computer needs to know the IP address of the gateway that will forward
your data down the line. The default gateway is really just the IP address
of a router, which is a device that connects multiple networks. A gateway
gets its name because it really is your gateway to all other networks.
✦Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a number that helps your computer
know when it needs to send stuff through the router. It’s a group of four
octets with dots, just like an IP address, but almost always it uses 0 or
255 as the four octets. Most often, the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0.
If the wrong number is entered for the subnet mask, it could keep you
from talking to the Internet or even computers on your own network.
Software applications
After you have the hardware in place and you’ve chosen and configured a
protocol to allow the computers to all talk to each other, you need software
to make use of your new network connections. Time for more good news: A
lot of the software that you’ll need to move data on your network is already
included in Mac OS X! Here is a quick list of some of the network software
and protocols already built into Mac OS X and what they’re used for:
✦FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
allows computers of any type — Mac, PC, Linux, UNIX, mainframe, or
whatever — to transfer files back and forth between them.
✦Telnet: Telnet is also part of the TCP/IP suite — you can use it to remotely
connect to a computer and execute commands on the remote machine.
✦Samba: Samba, an open source software suite, enables Mac OS X users
to share files with people using Windows computers and also allows the
Mac user to connect to files that the Windows computers share.
✦HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), also part of the TCP/IP suite,
is used by Web browsers to provide access to all the various pages on
the World Wide Web.

other computers on a local network.

network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP for short, is a proto-
col that enables a computer to automatically get all the information that I’ve
talked about to this point. (Check in your Webster’s . . . this is the very defi-
nition of the word godsend.)
You’re saying, “Mark, there’s gotta be a catch, right?” Well, here’s the bad
news: Before you can use DHCP, you have to first add a DHCP server, which
provides other computers on the network with their configuration settings.
Here’s the good news: Most Internet connection-sharing hardware devices
(and software-sharing implementations as well) provide a DHCP server as
part of the price of admission. (Internet connection sharing allows all your
networked computers to access the Internet through a single Internet con-
nection. I cover it more in Book V, Chapter 5.) Even many switches can pro-
vide DHCP services these days . . . technology marches on.
If you plan to use Internet connection sharing or you know that you have a
DHCP server on your network, you can set up your Mac to automatically
obtain the required IP address and information. Open System Preferences
from the Dock or the Apple menu and choose Network. From the Network
dialog that appears, click the Show drop-down list box and select Built-in
Ethernet. Select Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-down list on the
TCP/IP tab. Click the Apply Now button, and Mac OS X will contact the DHCP
server to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address,
and a Domain Name System (DNS) address. (DNS servers convert a human-
friendly address like www.yahoo.com to a computer-friendly IP address like
66.218.71.86.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply Now button, you should see the infor-
mation come up. Notice the addition underneath IP Address: (Provided by
DHCP Server.) This lets you know that the process worked and configuration
is complete. You might also notice that the DNS information is empty — fear
not, Mac OS X is really using DNS information provided by the DHCP server.
Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
If you ever make a network change that screws things up, like entering the
wrong subnet mask or an IP address that isn’t in the same range as others 
on your LAN, you can always click the Revert button to get back your old
settings.
One DHCP server on a network is princely, but two or more DHCP servers 
on a single network will fight like alley cats and grind everything to a halt.
Therefore, if you’re considering adding a DHCP server to an existing network,
make doggone sure that you’re not treading on another server’s toes. (Ask
that network administrator person.)

Manually choosing an IP address range
You say you don’t have a DHCP server, and you need to manually assign IP
addresses? This configuration means two things: You need to manually config-
ure the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.
Keep in mind that for now, you’re not concerned with the Internet — just com-
puters on the local network.
A result of being on a local network — because it’s not connected to the
Internet, it’s also called a private network — is that you must use IP addresses
that are reserved for private network use. You can use a few different ranges
of IP addresses, but I recommend that you choose an address range from the
192.168.x.x networks. In the next section, I show you how.
Down to business: I recommend that you use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x
range. What does this mean exactly? Well, here’s the scoop:
✦Use IP addresses where the first two octets are 192 and 168 (192.168).
Octet numbers are conjoined by periods.
✦For the third octet, choose any number between 1 and 254.
It doesn’t matter which one you choose as long as you use this same
third number on all computers on your network.
✦For the fourth octet, choose any number between 1 and 254.
Make sure that every computer on your local network has a different
fourth octet number. This is very important — your network will not
work otherwise.
✦Use 255.255.255.0 as your subnet mask.
For instance, suppose that you’re using three computers on your network.
All the IP addresses that you use will start with 192.168. Next, suppose you
choose 123 for the third octet. (Remember that you can choose any number
between 1 and 254.) Finally, for the fourth octet, choose the numbers 100,
105, and 110 for the three computers, respectively. (Again, you can choose
any numbers between 1 and 254.) The resulting IP addresses used on the
three computers are
192.168.123.100
192.168.123.105
192.168.123.110

Configuring Network System Preferences
482
By the way, I should mention that there are other range possibilities for
reserved private networks — AirPort and AirPort Extreme hardware uses 
a 10.x.x.x network range, for example — but the 192.168.x.x range is defi-
nitely the most popular and the most common default on Ethernet network
hardware.
After you know the IP addresses and the subnet mask that you’re going to
use, start setting up each computer. Being a nice guy, I’d like to walk you
through the process of configuring Mac OS X with the 192.168.123.105
address as an example.
Be sure that you have all the physical portion of your network powered up
and connected as outlined in the earlier section “Setting Up Your Network.”
1. Select any of your Macs to start with and open System Preferences
(either from the Apple menu or from the Dock).
2. From the System Preferences dialog, choose Network.
The Network pane appears.
3. Click Built-in Ethernet in the list and click Configure.
The TCP/IP panel should already be active by default; if not, click the
TCP/IP button to bring it forward.
4. Select Manually from the Configure IPv4 drop-down list of the TCP/IP
panel.
Figure 1-1 shows how things should look at this point.
5. Enter the IP address for this machine (192.168.123.105 in this exam-
ple) in the IP Address text box.
6. Enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask text box.
7. Click the Apply Now button, and your new network settings will take
effect.
8. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences.
Repeat this same procedure using the other IP addresses for each of the
other Macs that are connected to your network.
Most ISPs also supply DNS server addresses and search domains. If your ISP
included DNS server addresses or search domains, don’t forget to type them
into the corresponding boxes on the TCP/IP panel.

Verifying Connectivity
After you have your Macs connected and your TCP/IP configuration is done,
you need to check to make sure that everything is working. After you have at
least two computers on your network, each with a TCP/IP address, you can
use a simple little utility called ping to test the connection.
ping is a very simple, yet extremely helpful, utility that’s the first connectivity-
testing tool out of the box, even for network professionals. When you use the
ping utility — referred to as pinging something — the application sends out
a small packet of data to whatever destination you’re trying to reach. When
the receiving computer hears the ping, it answers with a ping reply. If the
original computer receives the ping reply, you know that the connection
between the computers is good.
To ping a computer, you use a little application built in to Mac OS X called
Network Utility, which allows you to work various network wonders (includ-
ing checking connectivity, watching the route that your computer takes to
get to another computer, and looking up information about Internet domain
names). To use Network Utility to check network connectivity, follow these
steps:
Figure 1-1:

settings.

Verifying Connectivity
484
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and click Utilities.
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
3. Click the Ping tab (see Figure 1-2).
4. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the
IP address of the computer that you want to ping.
5. To simply verify connectivity, select the Send Only x Pings radio
button and enter a low number, such as 5, in the text field.
Five or ten pings are plenty to see whether the connection is good.
6. Click the Ping button.
Your Mac sends ping packets to the IP address that you entered.
If the pings are successful, text appears in the text box at the bottom of the
Ping tab: one line for each ping reply received from the other computer. The
end of each line reads time= with a number at the end. That number is the
amount of time, in 1⁄1000 of a second (milliseconds [ms]), that it took for the
ping packet to go from your computer to the other computer and back.
If your ping is unsuccessful, you will see nothing, at least for a little bit. Each
ping that you send takes two seconds before it’s considered missing in action.
So, if you chose five pings, you need to wait ten seconds before you see the
results. After all the pings time out — a ping times out when it doesn’t get
returned in the proper amount of time — you see a line of text appear that
reads ping: sendto: No route to host or 100% packet loss. Both
error messages mean the same thing: All the ping packets that you sent out
are now in the packet graveyard, never to be seen again. As you’ve likely

guessed already, this is not a good sign for your network connectivity. Look
ahead to “Troubleshooting Your New Network” to find out where to begin
troubleshooting this problem.
If you can ping all the other computers on your network from one of the
computers, you don’t need to go to each computer and ping all the others.
You can logically assume that all the computers can communicate. For
instance, if you can ping computers B, C, and D from computer A, you don’t
need to bother with ping tests from computer B, C, or D.
After you have your computers configured and you’ve verified connectivity
between them, start doing the fun stuff that a network allows you to do, like
sharing data, printing, and (most importantly) playing games with users on
other computers.
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After a network is set up and operating, it rarely has problems — still, Murphy
sometimes takes charge, and the darn thing just won’t work right. When you
do have problems with the network, I recommend using a standard, consis-
tent approach to finding and fixing the problem. This section breaks down
troubleshooting into two areas:
✦The hardware: The best place to start troubleshooting a network prob-
lem is with the actual equipment, such as the NICs, cables, and hubs/
switches. (See earlier sections on each equipment type.)
✦The software: The second place to check for problems is in the configu-
ration of the computers on the network, specifically the configuration on
the computer(s) having the problem that you’re troubleshooting.
Physical problems with your network
Although many things on a network can go bad or cause problems, usually
network problems are caused by faulty equipment or wiring. Sometimes it’s
something as simple as a cable not being plugged in snugly. Looking at the
physical cables, connections, and equipment is always the best place to
start looking for problems. Here is a quick list of physical things to check
while trying to fix network problems:
1. Make sure that both ends of the network cable are firmly connected.
First check the end that plugs into the computer and then check the end
that connects to the hub/switch.
2. Turn on the problematic computer to be sure that it’s connected to a
hub or switch.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
486
Check the port on the hub/switch to see whether the link/speed light is
lit. (Depending on the hub or switch that you have, you might not have a
link light. Many hubs and switches use a speed light to indicate a link.
Check the manufacturer’s manual for your model.) If your computer is
on and connected but no link/speed light is lit, try replacing the network
cable.
3. If you replace the network cable and there is still no light, try unplug-
ging the cable from the hub/switch and plug it into another port.
Choose one of the other computers connected to the hub/switch that
works, unplug it, and plug the broken computer into that port for test-
ing. Occasionally a single port on a hub or switch will go bad; if that hap-
pens, just mark it as bad and don’t use it anymore. But if all computers
connected to the hub/switch stop working, it’s probably the hub or
switch that has gone south. If the hub/switch is still under warranty, I
recommend getting it fixed or replaced.
4. If you replace the cable, try a different port on the hub, and other
computers work fine on that hub/switch, the NIC inside your com-
puter has possibly gone bad.
If you reach this determination, call your local service center to have it
looked at and repaired. If you have an older model where the NIC was
added instead of built in, you can simply replace the NIC yourself.
The key when troubleshooting physical problems is the link/speed light on
the hub or switch. If the link/speed light still won’t work, the problem isn’t
likely a physical problem. You need to start troubleshooting the network
configuration on the computer itself.
Network configuration problems
After checking the physical layer, look for problems in the network settings.
When using TCP/IP on your network, look for these specific things: the TCP/
IP configuration mode, IP address, subnet mask, and router IP address (if
you’re using a router to connect to the Internet or other networks). To check
these settings, choose Apple➪System Preferences➪Network to bring up the
Network dialog.
1. Make sure that the Configuration drop-down list on the TCP/IP
Properties tab is set to the appropriate option.
• Using DHCP: Select the Using DHCP option only if you’re using a
cable/DSL modem/router or other DHCP server. Otherwise, set this
to Manually.
• Manually: If the configuration is set to Manually, check the IP Address,
DNS Servers, Router, and Subnet Mask fields to make sure that they’re

487
correct. If you’re not sure whether your Subnet Mask field entry is
correct, you can usually make it the same as other computers on the
same network with you. Most times, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.
2. To check your Internet connectivity to the rest of the Internet, try
pinging www.apple.com.
This checks the router and DNS settings.
3. If you’re set up for DHCP and your TCP/IP settings remain blank,
make sure that your DHCP server — which could be your cable/DSL
modem/router — is turned on and working properly.

H
ere’s one of those incredibly complex concepts that you always find 
in these computer books: After you have your network all set up and
ready to go, you can do all kinds of things with it. (Now wasn’t that utterly
painless?) You can use your network to share files, share printers, remotely
control your Mac, or even play multi-user games like Call of Duty — my
favorite — against other friends. To keep your files safe from unwanted
snoops, you can configure the Mac OS X built-in firewall. In this chapter, I
cover the basics of file sharing, sharing printers, and using the firewall to
protect yourself from intruders.
It’s All about (File) Sharing
One of the main reasons for building a network is sharing files between com-
puters. You might even want to set up a server, which is a computer with
shared files that are always available to anyone on the network. Think of a
server as a common file storage area for the rest of the network. Really, any
computer that shares files is technically a server because it is serving, so to
speak. But usually most people only use the word server to mean a computer
that’s dedicated solely to serving files, printers, and so on for the rest of the
network.
Creating an account
Sharing files on your Mac with other Mac users is a piece of cake. Remember,
however, that you need to create an account for anyone whom you want to
have access to your files. The accounts that you create can only access two
folders, shown in Figure 2-1:

It’s All about (File) Sharing
490
✦The account’s Home folder: That specific account’s Home folder carries
a short version of the username that’s in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Figure 2-1 shows the Home folder, which is noted with an icon that
looks like a house, for the chambers account (where chambers is the
short account name for Mark Chambers). The Home folder icon always
bears the short account name for the user who’s currently logged in.
✦The Shared folder: This folder is also in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Anyone with an account on your Mac can access the Shared
folder, so it’s a great place to keep common files that everyone wants to
copy or use.
By the way, here’s a quick note about the drive names that you see in these
figures. I’ve never liked that rather mundane Macintosh HD moniker, and as I
mention elsewhere in the book, I’m a huge (okay, really huge) fan of Mozart —
hence the drive name Disk Wolfgang. My other drive is an external FireWire
drive where I keep all beta builds of upcoming Mac OS X versions . . . and it’s
thoughtfully named FireWire Drive. (Technology authors can be somewhat
eccentric; chalk it up to our techno-nerd beginnings. On the other hand, we
never type e-mail messages in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. That’s considered
shouting, you know.)
To create an account, you need to be logged in as an Admin user. Follow
these steps:
1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ú) or the Dock.
2. Click Accounts under the System section.
3. Click the New Account button, which carries a plus sign.

4. Fill in the appropriate information, including the name for the account
and a password.
Note that the name that appears as the short name determines the name
of that user’s Home folder.
5. Click Create Account.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.
I cover creating accounts in greater detail in Book II, Chapter 5 but that’s the
short version.
Enabling file sharing
When you enable file sharing, your files are exchanged over Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and/or AppleTalk, depending on
which protocols you’ve enabled. (To enable AppleTalk for compatibility with
older Macs on your network, see Book V, Chapter 3.)
Regardless of which protocol you use to share your files, follow these steps
to turn on sharing:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences panel.
3. On the Services panel, select the Personal File Sharing check box to
enable it.
4. Click Start.
After the computer thinks for a second, you see the message Personal
File Sharing On appear just above the Stop button. This lets you
know that file sharing is enabled.
Connecting to a shared resource
Toward the bottom of the Sharing panel, you can see that other Macintosh
users can access your computer at afp://<ip address>, where ip
address is the IP address for your specific computer. When another Mac
user wants to connect to your shared files, that person can do the following:
1. Open the Finder and choose Go➪Connect to Server.
2. After the Connect to Server dialog opens, other Mac users can type
afp://<ip address> (where ip address is the IP address of your
Macintosh) and then click the Connect button.
Alternatively, you can choose Go➪Network and then browse your net-
work for the server name listed at the bottom of the panel.

Sharing a Connected Printer
492
You can also browse for a shared resource on the Connect to Server dialog.
Choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K. Click Browse to locate the
shared computer. Note that you might be prompted to choose whether you
want to connect as a Guest or a Registered User. To connect to the server as
a Registered User, you must supply the right username and password. If you
connect as Guest, you don’t have to supply a password, but you will have
restricted access to only the Public folder for each account on the system
that you connect to. If you need to connect as a Registered User, ask an
Admin user who controls that Mac to supply you with the correct username
and password.
Give the username and password that you created to the person using the
other Mac, and he can now access files in that account’s Home folder as well
as any other Public folders on your computer.
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing your printer for others to use is one of the best reasons to have a
network. Setting up your Mac to share your printer is very easy under 
Mac OS X. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do:
1. Open System Preferences from the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. On the Services panel, select the Printer Sharing entry.
4. Click Start.
There will be a slight pause while Mac OS X gets everything ready, but
when it’s done, you see the message Printer Sharing On appear just
above the Stop button. This lets you know that printer sharing is enabled.
By default, when you turn on Printer Sharing, Tiger automatically shares
all the current printers connected to your Mac. To select which printers
can be used for shared printing, click the Print & Fax icon in System
Preferences, and then click Sharing. From this panel, you can enable and
disable sharing on individual printers.
After Printer Sharing is enabled, follow these steps to connect to that printer
from other computers on your network:
1. Click System Preferences on the Dock.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).

Sharing Files with Windows Computers
493
You might be prompted to add a printer automatically when the Printer
Setup Utility opens. Click the Add button to begin the addition. (For
more on adding a printer with the Printer Setup Utility, see Book VI,
Chapter 4.)
4. From the Printer List window that opens, click the Add button.
5. Click IP Printing on the toolbar.
6. Enter the IP address of the Macintosh that’s connected to the target
printer and then click the Add button.
Already got the Printer Browser open? Then follow the easier path: Clicking
the Default Browser toolbar button displays all the available local shared
printers. Click the desired printer and then click Add.
You can also click More Printers at the bottom of the Printer List window to
select a printer using Bonjour. Click the drop-down list box at the top of the
dialog and choose Bonjour to automatically recognize printers on your local
network. Printers just appear in your Printer List automatically. It doesn’t get
any easier than that!
Sharing Files with Windows Computers
If you’ve deigned to allow PCs running Windows on your network (a gener-
ous gesture to the lower classes), you’ll probably want to also share files
with those computers. Sharing files with a Windows PC — actually a Windows
user — is very similar to sharing files with other Mac users.
Follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. On the Services panel, mark the Windows Sharing check box to
enable it.
After a few moments, you see the message Windows Sharing On appear
just above the Stop button, confirming that you’re now open to connec-
tions from the Great Unwashed Windows Horde.
Just like when sharing files with other Mac users, you see a helpful reminder
toward the bottom that tells you what the Windows users need to type in
order to gain access to your Mac. Also, you might have to enable Windows
access on the desired account before it can be used. Click Enable Accounts
and then mark the check box next to the account that you want to share

with Windows users. Tiger prompts you for your password, smugly inform-
ing you that the account password will be stored “in a less secure manner.”
(Take that, Mr. Gates!)
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
If you allow a Windows PC to access your files, you’ll also probably want to
putter around with files on a Windows PC. Easy!
Accessing files on Windows computers relies on the Samba component (a
part of the UNIX foundation of Mac OS X). Follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder.
The Connect to Server dialog opens.
2. In the Address box, enter smb://<ip address>, where ip address is
the IP address of the Windows computer that you want to connect to.
3. Click the Connect button.
Depending on the type of account you have on the Windows PC, Mac OS X
might display an SMB (Server Message Block) authentication dialog in
which you can enter your username and password. (Think security for
the Windows crowd.)
4. Select the desired shared drive to mount from the drop-down list box.
5. Mount the shared drive, OS-version-dependent:
• If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows 95 or Windows 98 com-
puter: Simply click OK to mount the share.
• If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows NT, 2000, or XP com-
puter: Click the Authenticate button. Then enter your username and
password, click OK, and then click OK again to mount the share.
Using FTP on the Internet
Because File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a part
of the TCP/IP suite, it works on virtually every
type of computer (over both the Internet and
your local area network). So, assuming that you
have your computer connected to the Internet
through a modem or a local area network (LAN)
connection, everything that I discuss about FTP
and how to use it applies to connecting to FTP
servers on the Internet as well. When you con-
nect to FTP servers on the Internet, you can use
the Fully Qualified Domain Name (or FQDN for
short) like ftp.apple.com instead of an
actual IP address. You can also use the FTP
server in Mac OS X to make files available to
friends on the Internet just as you would to
make them available on a LAN.

After you mount the shared drive, you’ll see it appear on your Desktop, just
like a Mac volume. You can use this drive just like any other drive on your
system. To disconnect from the Windows share, you can

or
✦Hold Control, click the icon, and then choose Eject from the menu

Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite — the hoary acronym FTP stands 
for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is one of the oldest methods for sharing files
between computers; however, because it’s part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
it can be used on many different kinds of computers, including those running
just about any type of strange and arcane operating system. You can still
manage to exchange files regardless of whether you’re using Mac OS X,
Windows, Linux, or UNIX. (Heck, even DOS can join the party.)
FTP is a client/server application. In plain English, this means that two pieces
make things tick: the server (which hosts the connection, rather like a file
server) and the client (which connects to the server). Mac OS X, thanks to its
UNIX foundation, has both an FTP server and client built in. To use FTP, you
need a computer running the FTP server software to give others access to
files; then the other computer, or client, can connect to the FTP server. After
the connection is made, the client can either send files to the server (upload-
ing) or get files from the server (downloading). In this section, I cover how to
use FTP to give others access to your files as well as talk about the FTP
applications that come with Mac OS X.
Using the Mac OS X built-in FTP to share files
One way to give others access to your files is to run an FTP server on your
Mac. Mac OS X comes with an FTP server built in, so you just have to acti-
vate it. You might wonder why you’d use FTP to share files when you can use
Personal File Sharing or Windows File Sharing. The main advantage to FTP is
compatibility: Not only can people on your LAN access files, but anyone on
the Internet can also access your files, regardless of the type of machine that
they’re using.
Just like with the other file-sharing methods, you need to create a user account
on your computer before someone can connect to and get files from your Mac.

Using FTP to Access Files
496
After you have accounts created for the users, you can enable FTP sharing
like this:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. Mark the FTP Access check box to enable it.
You see the message FTP Access On appear above the Stop button,
which proclaims that FTP access is enabled. Also you can see toward
the bottom of the dialog that people can use ftp://<ip address>,
where ip address is the IP address of your Mac.
If you’re using an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station or other cable/digital
subscriber line (DSL) router to share your Internet connection, you need to
place the Mac that you want people on the Internet to access in a DMZ, or
demilitarized zone. Check your cable/DSL router documentation for more
information.
Using FTP from Terminal to transfer files
You can use FTP to transfer files with an FTP server by using the command
line interface (CLI); to use the CLI, you need to open a Terminal, or shell, ses-
sion. To use a Terminal session, click the Terminal icon in the Utilities folder
inside the Applications folder. When you open a Terminal session, you’re
presented with a window that accepts text commands. You’ll see a prompt
that consists of your computer’s name and the folder that you’re currently
in, followed by your user ID. It’s at this prompt where you type various FTP
commands.
After you’re in the Terminal session, you’ll use a series of commands to con-
nect to another computer, move in and out of folders, and transfer files.
Following is a list of the basic commands that you need to use FTP as well as
a brief description of what each command does.
✦ftp: This command starts the FTP command line interface session. You
can tell that you’re in the FTP client application when you see ftp> as
your command prompt. This is where you will type all other FTP com-
mands to do things.
✦open: This command is used to start your connection to another com-
puter. Type this command followed by the IP address of the FTP server
that you want to connect to.
✦ls: Use this command to see a listing of all files and folders in the cur-
rent folder on the FTP server.

✦cd: This command allows you to change the folder that you’re in. Type
cd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to move into 
a subfolder on the FTP server. Type cd .. (that’s c, d, space, and two 
periods) to go back out a folder level.
✦lcd: This command acts exactly like cd except that it changes the folder
that you’re currently in on your local system, not the FTP server. Use
this command to put yourself in the folder on the local drive that you
want to transfer files to and from.
✦bin: Type this command to get in binary mode to transfer files that aren’t
plain text files. (Always use binary mode unless you’re specifically trans-
ferring plain text files.)
✦ascii: This command puts you in ASCII mode for transferring text files.
✦get or mget: To retrieve a single file, use the get command followed by
the filename of the file that you want to retrieve. If you want to get multi-
ple files at once, use the mget command followed by a filename contain-
ing * and/or ? as wildcards.
✦put or mput: To send a single file, use the put command followed by the
filename to send a file to the FTP server. To send multiple files, use the
mput command followed by a filename containing * and/or ? as wildcards.
✦quit: Use the quit command to end your FTP session.
To end a Terminal session and exit Terminal at any time, press Ô+Q. Terminal
will prompt you for confirmation if necessary.
Many FTP servers will only let you send files to certain folders. Most times
this folder is named Upload, Uploads, or something similar.
Using these commands will enable you to exchange files with an FTP server.
Here’s an example of how to use these commands within the Terminal
window:
1. Type ftp to get into FTP mode.
2. Type open <ip address> to open your connection to the FTP server.
3. At this point, you’ll be asked for a username and password.
For many FTP servers, using the username anonymous and your e-mail
address as the password is enough to get you logged in. Some sites even
allow you to log in without any username or password at all. On secure
sites, however, you must use an assigned username and password pro-
vided by the administrator of that particular server.

Using the Built-in Firewall
498
4. Use the lcd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) com-
mand to change into the folder on your local drive that you want files
to come to/from.
5. Use the ls and cd commands to place yourself into the desired folder
on the FTP server.
6. Use the ascii or bin commands to set your file transfer mode to ASCII
or binary, respectively.
This is important because choosing the wrong type will likely cause the
transfer to fail. Unless it’s a plain text file, always use binary mode.
7. Use the get/mget/put/mput commands to send or receive the desired
files.
8. Use the quit command to close the connection and exit the FTP 
session.
Using the Built-in Firewall
A firewall watches all the network communications coming into your Mac —
it automatically plays the role of security guard, blocking or denying certain
network traffic that you want to avoid from reaching your Mac. It acts as
another layer of security to help keep you safe from unwanted attacks. That’s
all well and good, but you must be careful to set up your firewall correctly
before you turn it on: A configuration mistake could make your Mac inacces-
sible from the network.
For instance, if you want to enable FTP access on your Mac but you also
want to keep all other traffic from coming into your Mac, you can tell the
built-in firewall to only allow FTP traffic. The firewall on the Mac will only
block or allow TCP/IP traffic — not AppleTalk — so AppleTalk traffic (which
is always from your local network and not the Internet anyway) is always
able to get in.
When enabled, the firewall blocks all traffic that comes into your Mac. By
default, however, the firewall is turned off. So, your first job is to enable the
firewall, following these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Firewall tab to show the settings that you see in Figure 2-2.
4. Click the Start button.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
Using the Built-in Firewall
499
This enables the firewall. And, by default, all incoming TCP/IP traffic is
blocked. You must enable each sharing method that you want to be able to
use. As you enable different sharing methods, such as Personal File Sharing
or FTP Access, notice that under the Firewall tab, those types of traffic now
have a check mark in the box for each type of traffic. (In other words, when
you turn on a sharing method, the firewall automatically allows traffic for
that sharing method. Most excellent.)
Sometimes you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall that
isn’t on the list. At that point, you can click the New button to create a new
definition for your firewall to use. The resulting dialog has a drop-down list
with some common things that you might want to allow, such as Internet
Relay Chat (IRC), I Seek You (ICQ), QuickTime, and MSN Messenger.
If you need to add ports for another application that’s not in that drop-down
list — for instance, a multiplayer game — you need to select Other from the
Port Name drop-down list. Then you can enter a port number, a port range,
or a series of ports. You might need to check the documentation for a spe-
cific application to see which ports it uses.
Ports are like an extension to an IP address. For example, when you communi-
cate with a Web server, you send a request not only to that Web server’s IP
address, but you send it on port 80 — the standard port for HyperText Transfer
Figure 2-2:

Protocol (HTTP) traffic. Different applications use different port numbers, so
you need to check which ports are used when you want to adjust your firewall
to allow that traffic.
I highly recommend that you click the Advanced button whilst you’re turn-
ing on your firewall — then make doggone sure that the Enable Stealth Mode
check box is enabled. Hackers and other undesirables will have a much
harder time locating your Mac’s presence on the Internet with this feature
turned on.
Remote Control of Your Mac
Forgive me whilst I wax techno-nerd here: One of the coolest advantages to a
network is the ability to take control of one computer from another computer.
For example, sometimes you might need to access files on your Mac while
you’re on a trip, but you don’t have Personal File Sharing enabled. What can
you do? You can remotely connect into your Mac and then — just as if you
were sitting in front of it — enable Personal File Sharing (as I demonstrate
earlier in the chapter). Perhaps you have a file on your computer with some-
one’s phone number that you suddenly need on the road — with remote con-
trol, it’s at your fingertips! (Sigh . . . ah, technology.)
Remotely control your Mac (for free, no less!)
Virtual Network Computer (or VNC, available for many platforms at www.
realvnc.com) is a very nice application that enables you to remotely con-
trol a computer from pretty much anywhere that has an Internet connection.
VNC is easy to install and configure, but the best feature is that it’s free. VNC
can run on many different platforms, ranging from Windows XP and UNIX on
desktop computers and servers to Palm OS and Windows CE on personal
digital assistants (PDAs). Wrap your mind around this: You could be at a
friend’s house on her wireless network and use your PDA to remotely con-
trol your Mac at home over the Internet. Pure, undiluted sassy!
Some networks have proxies and firewalls that might interfere with VNC’s
operation. You can remotely control a computer that’s behind a firewall or
cable/DSL router, but the firewall/router needs to be configured properly.
Because the process varies from one manufacturer to the next, check your
cable/DSL router manual for instructions on how to do this.
Speaking of firewalls, make sure that you configure the Mac OS X firewall to
allow VNC traffic. Follow the steps that I outline in the previous section to
allow communications over the port you use for VNC.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your Network

How VNC works
In a nutshell, VNC takes the graphical interface on your monitor, turns it into
data, and sends it to the computer that you’re using to remotely control it.
The computer that you’re using sends keyboard presses, mouse movements,
and clicks to it, acting just the same way it would if you were sitting right in
front of it.
A specific version of VNC, called Share My Desktop (SMD), is available for
Mac OS X. You can download SMD at
www.bombich.com/software/smd.html
There you’ll find instructions on how to install and set up SMD. Figure 2-3
shows a screenshot of a Mac running SMD being remotely controlled from a
computer running Windows 98.
Mr. Paranoia speaks again: Make doggone sure that you set up the pass-
word access correctly for SMD, or don’t run it! I can’t stress enough how
much fun a hacker would have with free remote control over your Mac OS X
Desktop.

Remote control of another computer from your Mac
A few different VNC viewers exist for Mac OS X. A VNC viewer is just an appli-
cation you use to remotely control your computer running VNC. You can
download them at www.realvnc.com/download.html. If you find yourself
on a computer without a VNC viewer — heaven forbid — VNC server actu-
ally runs over the Web as well! As long as the computer that you’re using has
a Web browser that supports Java — which Safari and Internet Explorer do —
you can still remotely control your computer.
When you connect to the computer running VNC using a Web browser, the
Web server sends a default page that contains a Java applet. That Java applet
asks you for the password to connect; upon entering the correct password,
it brings up the remote control session right in the Web browser. Good golly,
Molly!

In This Chapter
 Connecting to a legacy AppleTalk network
 Configuring the AppleTalk network preferences
 Using Mac OS X to access AppleTalk resources
W
hen emoting concerning networking and Macs, I’d be terribly remiss
for not discussing AppleTalk, which is the so-called “archaic” com-
munications protocol created years ago by Apple. AppleTalk allows a net-
work of Macs to share files and printers; before the arrival of an Ethernet
port, AppleTalk was the cat’s meow for connecting Macs. AppleTalk is still
used in environments like homes, offices, and college campuses. However,
AppleTalk is now disappearing from the corporate world because it simply
cannot scale (that’s administrator-speak for grow) to handle large networks
like standard Ethernet and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) can.
Although Apple finally made the move to TCP/IP as its primary network 
protocol — like the rest of the civilized world — Apple still includes support
for AppleTalk in Mac OS X Tiger, but it’s disabled by default. About the only
time when you might need to use AppleTalk is if you find yourself trying to
access an existing AppleTalk network (which is practically the definition of
the phrase rare occurrence) . . . but hey, I like to cover everything in a desk-
top reference. Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to enable the
AppleTalk protocol on your Mac as well as how to access files and printers
on a network that’s running AppleTalk.
Setting Up AppleTalk
Just like most network configuration tasks under the Big X, configuring your
Mac to use AppleTalk and play well with others in an AppleTalk network isn’t
very difficult. In this section, I talk about how to configure the settings in the
Network dialog of System Preferences so that you can join the file sharing
and network printing party.

Setting Up AppleTalk
504
You can configure AppleTalk on Mac OS X in two ways: manually or automat-
ically. I’ll bet you could see this Mark’s Maxim coming from a mile away:
Automatic is always good.™
Unless you’re given specific AppleTalk settings by a network administrator, I
highly recommend using the automatic AppleTalk configuration. However, I
cover both methods in this chapter just to be on the safe side. (That’s just
the kind of guy I am.)
Automatically configuring AppleTalk
To automatically configure AppleTalk, follow these steps.
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ú) or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences window, click Network to open the
Network Preferences pane.
3. Click the Show drop-down list box and choose Built-in Ethernet (or
the connection you’re currently using).
4. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page.
5. Enable the Make AppleTalk Active check box and then click the Apply
Now button.
Mac OS X defaults to using the automatic AppleTalk configuration mode.
Now, I know this is going to be hard to believe, but you’re done!
Now your Mac is configured to use the AppleTalk protocol to share and access
files and printers. AppleTalk is ready to go as soon as you click the Apply Now
button, but you won’t notice anything special when you turn on AppleTalk.
(Like TCP/IP, AppleTalk is invisible in Mac OS X until you use it.) Check the
“Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk” section later in this chapter to
actually start using AppleTalk to do stuff.
Manually configuring AppleTalk
Although not as simple as using the automatic configuration, manually con-
figuring AppleTalk is quite easy as well. To manually configure AppleTalk,
follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences window that appears, click Network to
open the Network Preferences pane.

Book V

3. Click the Show drop-down list box and choose Built-in Ethernet (or
the connection you’re currently using).
4. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page.
5. From the Configure drop-down list, choose Manually.
When you do, two more text boxes appear where you can enter informa-
tion, as Figure 3-1 illustrates: Node ID and Network ID. Unless you’re the
network administrator — check to see whether you’re surrounded by a
glowing aura of authority and wisdom — you must obtain these two ID
numbers from that glowing individual who is administering your network.
Use manual configuration only if you’re designing an AppleTalk network
or you have information from a network administrator on the correct
settings to use. If you enter the wrong settings, you won’t be able to
communicate with other Macs on your network . . . but at least you don’t
need to worry about blowing something up or watching your Mac melt.
6. After you enter the appropriate Node ID and Network ID, click the
Apply Now button to save those settings.
A word about Zones
The final option on the AppleTalk settings page
is the AppleTalk Zone drop-down list box. (Stick
with me here, things are going to get techni-
cally flamboyant for a few sentences, but it
can’t be helped.) Zones are logical groupings of
computers that an AppleTalk network adminis-
trator creates for ease of use. For example,
consider a large company that employs many
graphic artists: This company has many build-
ings, but because of how the business has
grown, the graphic artists are spread between
several different locations in different buildings.
An AppleTalk network administrator would
likely have created a Graphics Zone that con-
tains all the Macs and servers and printers that
make up the graphics department; this way, the
artists can get to files on servers or print to
printers that are meant for them simply by put-
ting themselves in the Graphics Zone. This
works as a handy way to keep people who are
physically separate logically grouped into a
common area, or Zone. (Think of Zones as a
convenience thing — they don’t help your
system performance.)
When you configure AppleTalk, you might or
might not need to set the AppleTalk Zone. If
you’re on a network in which the administrator
has configured AppleTalk Zones, you’ll see a
list of all the Zones by clicking the AppleTalk
Zone drop-down list; from there, simply select
the name of the Zone that you want to partici-
pate in. If you’re on a network in which no
Zones are configured, the AppleTalk Zone drop-
down box will be grayed out and unavailable —
and if you can’t choose a Zone anyway, don’t
worry about it. (In other words, don’t let your
lack of AppleTalk Zones spoil that upcoming trip
to Vegas.)

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
506
Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
After you have AppleTalk configured and ready to go, you can share files and
printers from your Mac. If you’re wondering what to do after AppleTalk is
enabled, the following sections show you how to share your files and print-
ers as well as how to access files and printers that others have shared on the
network.
Accessing AppleTalk share points
Accessing share points — a collection of files that are shared to the network —
by using AppleTalk is much like accessing other shared files with Internet
Protocol (IP). In this section, I talk about finding AppleTalk servers, connecting
to AppleTalk share points, and how to disconnect when you are done. Follow
these steps each time when you start your computer or if you get discon-
nected for any reason.
Even though a server version of Mac OS X exists that is meant to run on cor-
porate servers that do nothing but serve up files and printers to people, in
this entire section, I use the word server to simply mean any Mac or other
computer that has AppleTalk running and is sharing files or printers.

Choosing an AppleTalk server
To choose an AppleTalk server, perform the following steps:
1. From the Finder, choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K on the
keyboard.
This brings up the Connect To Server dialog.
2. From this dialog, click the Browse button.
Your Mac searches the local network for any AppleTalk servers and dis-
plays a Finder window listing all the available servers.
3. Double-click the icon representing the appropriate AppleTalk server
that contains the share point that you want to access.
4. After you choose the AppleTalk server, click the Connect button.
To help cut down on the time that it takes to connect to this same server in
the future, just click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus sign), and
the server’s path is added to the Favorite Servers list. The next time that you
need to connect to that server, you need only double-click the server entry
in the Favorite Servers list. (This works for all servers, not just the AppleTalk
variety.) Ain’t life grand?
Tiger also maintains a list of the servers that you’ve connected to recently,
even if they don’t appear in the Favorite Servers list. Click the Recent Servers
button (which carries a clock icon) and then click the desired server from
the menu. You can also click Recent Items under the Apple menu to show
the same servers.
Connecting to the AppleTalk server
Each time you want to access files or printers via AppleTalk, you must con-
nect to the server. To connect to an AppleTalk server, you need to connect
as a Guest or, if you have a username and password for that server, as a
Registered User. After clicking the Connect button of the Connect to Server
dialog, you’ll be prompted to choose whether you want to connect as a
Guest or a Registered User.
If you’re connecting to the server as a Registered User, you must supply the
right username and password. If you connect as a Guest, you don’t have to
supply a password, but (depending on the access rights that have been 
configured) you might have restricted access only to the Shared folder that
appears in the Users folder on each system that you connect to. If you con-
nect as a Registered User, you need to get the correct username and pass-
word from the person who is in control of user accounts on a given Mac.

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
508
Before you click the Connect button to complete the connection, consider
whether you’d like to automate things in the future. If so, enable the Remem-
ber Password (Add to Keychain) check box. Enabling this check box saves
the username and password for this connection so that you don’t have to
manually type it in each time that you reconnect to this particular share
point (particularly handy if you connect to a share point every time that you
use your Mac). However, use this option only if your Mac is in a secure loca-
tion, or if you can be sure that others won’t use this connection.
Choosing a share point from the AppleTalk server
Whether or not you chose to play with the connection options, finalize the
connection by clicking the Connect button after choosing to log in as a Guest
or a Registered User. After you click Connect, you see a list of share points
on the AppleTalk server.
Double-click the icon for the share point that you want. You see a network
drive appear on your Desktop, which you can treat as you would any other
attached drive.
Disconnecting from the share point
When you’re done using the share point, you can disconnect from the share
point in a few different ways:
✦Control+click the network drive Desktop icon and choose Eject from
the contextual menu that appears.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then choose
Eject from the File menu.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then press
Ô+E.
✦Click the network drive icon in a Finder window sidebar and click the
Eject button next to it.
✦Click and drag the network drive Desktop icon to the Trash on the
Dock. Hint: The Trash changes into an Eject icon when dragging a net-
work drive. Simple but sassy.
Accessing AppleTalk printers
The other major thing (besides file sharing) that you can do with AppleTalk
is to connect to and use AppleTalk network printers. Again, like most things
under Mac OS X, it’s pretty straightforward and easy.

Adding an AppleTalk printer
Before you can print to an AppleTalk printer, you first need to add that
printer to your setup. Follow these steps to add a printer:
1. Open your hard drive from the Desktop, double-click the Applications
folder, double-click the Utilities folder, and then double-click the
Printer Setup Utility icon.
This opens the Printer Setup Utility.
2. If you’re prompted to add a printer the first time that you open the
Printer Setup Utility, as seen in Figure 3-2, click Add to start the
process.
If you’ve already opened Printer Setup Utility and have already added
printers in the past, you add another network printer by clicking the
Add toolbar button.
3. Click More Printers.
4. From the resulting Printer List sheet, select AppleTalk from the top
drop-down box.
You see a list of all the AppleTalk shared printers that your Mac sees on
the network.
If you’re on a network with more than just the local Zone, you might
need to select the appropriate Zone from the second drop-down box
before you see the desired printer.
5. Click the desired printer to select it in the list.
6. If necessary, select the proper printer from the Printer Model drop-
down list at the bottom of the Printer List dialog.
If the Auto Select feature doesn’t identify the correct printer, you might
have to select the closest match from the Printer Model drop-down list.
(Check the printer manufacturer’s Web site for updated printer drivers
that might be necessary to use this new printer.) Choosing Generic from
Figure 3-2:

the list will work with most printers, but (depending on your model) you
might be restricted to text-only output and might not have access to
special features like tray selection or print quality.
7. Click the Add button to complete the process.
You can now treat this as any other printer that could be connected
directly to your machine. You can view the print queue and hold, resume,
and delete print jobs from the Queue menu.
Removing an AppleTalk printer
Removing an AppleTalk printer that you’ve connected to is very simple. From
the Printer Setup Utility, click once on the printer that you wish to remove
and then either click the Delete icon in the Printer Setup Utility toolbar or
choose Delete Printer from the Printers menu.

owadays, wireless connectivity is king. For example, cellphones have
gone from being a toy of the technological elite to a permanent fixture
on the hip of the common man. The shorts that I’m wearing right now have
a special pocket just for a cellphone to ride in; when I’m without my phone,
it usually carries a 5th Avenue candy bar. (Perhaps that was too personal . . .
sorry.)
Because people have become accustomed to being able to keep in touch
wherever they are, they also want to be able to have access to their network,
at least within their house or workplace, without the hassle of cables. (Which,
by the way, are magnets for pets that enjoy a good chew toy.) This desire 
for convenience and the advances in wireless technology have combined to
bring you the concept of the wireless network (and wireless coffee shops,
and wireless access providers, and even wireless gaming centers).
Now you can be connected to your home local area network (LAN) and your
shared Internet connection (which I cover in Book V, Chapter 5) from your
balcony, deck, lounge chair in the yard, or even your bedroom. In this chapter,
I talk about how wireless networks work, and then I give you a lot of informa-
tion to help you get the right pieces to free yourself — securely, mind you —
from the world of the wired.
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Wireless networks aren’t all that different from their wired siblings. In this
chapter, I discuss some of the features and limitations of wireless network-
ing, but you must first be familiar with a foundation of information.
Because of the technology involved in wireless networks and how things 
are changing rapidly in this area, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of
acronyms and other techno-babble. Although you don’t need to know every

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet

little detail to be able to set up your own wireless network, you should know
some of these terms so that you can avoid getting stung by hackers or stuck
with equipment that’s on the verge of obsolescence. Here is a quick list of
terms that you’ll see on your road to becoming a wireless network guru:
✦WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless LAN. If you’ve already read previous
chapters in this mini-book, a LAN (local area network) is just a bunch of
computers and other devices connected together.
✦IEEE: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. This is an organi-
zation that approves standards that allow computers, network equipment,
and just about anything else electronic to play nicely together. Sometimes
IEEE helps create these standards before approving them, and sometimes
it just approves standards that others have produced.
✦802.11: This is the part of the IEEE standards that deals specifically with
wireless networking. Although wireless is usually generically referred to
as wireless networks (or sometimes even Wi-Fi), it’s all really a wireless
form of Ethernet.
✦Wireless access point: A wireless access point, or WAP, is a device that
allows wireless network devices to connect to a wired Ethernet network.
✦Service Set Identifier: The Service Set Identifier, or SSID, is used to tell
your computer the name of the wireless network that you want to use.
✦Wired Equivalency Protocol: Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is an
encryption that wireless networks can use to keep your wireless net-
work more secure from snoopers and hackers.
✦Ad Hoc mode: An Ad Hoc wireless network is one where each wireless
device talks directly with all other wireless devices. Apple calls this
mode a computer-to-computer network.
✦Infrastructure mode: This is where all wireless devices talk to a WAP,
and the WAP then talks to other wireless devices and the wired network.
As I cover the different parts of wireless networking and how to set it up,
you’ll find yourself using these terms over and over. Before you know it,
you’ll be spouting these wireless-related acronyms like a pro. (No, really. 
I’m not kidding.)
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
One of the first things that you might notice when you start looking into
wireless networking is the different wireless standards. You should at least
be aware that these different standards exist: That way, you can be sure to
get wireless network components that will work together because some of
the different wireless standards are not compatible. (Feel free to photocopy
this list and stick it on your fridge door.)

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
513
IEEE 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b has another name that you’ll likely see on product advertise-
ments, literature, or boxes in stores: Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity.
(Kinda like that cutting-edge Hi-Fi stereo from the ’60s and ’70s, where Hi-Fi
stands for High Fidelity.) Most folks proclaim Wi-Fi as only 802.11b. Wi-Fi was
the first version of wireless Ethernet. This version of wireless runs at speeds
up to 11 million bits per second, or 11 Mbps. The reason why I say that it
runs at speeds up to 11Mbps is because the actual speed that the data is
transferred depends on things like signal strength and quality. When the con-
ditions are such that your signal strength or quality is decreased — such as
an inconvenient concrete wall between you and your AirPort Base Station —
you might find that your wireless connection changes down to 5.5 Mbps, 
2 Mbps, or even as slow as 1 Mbps.
Most available wireless Ethernet equipment, including Apple’s AirPort net-
work cards and standard-issue AirPort Base Station, uses 802.11b. In fact, 
it’s time for Mac owners to swell with pride yet again: Apple was the first
computer company to ship 802.11b hardware. (Back then, in 1999, it was the
original AirPort Base Station.) Now, of course, Apple has raised the bar with
AirPort Extreme, which I discuss later in this chapter, and the AirPort
Express mobile Base Station.
In general, Wi-Fi network cards have the ability to communicate with other
Wi-Fi devices and WAPs that are up to 1,000 feet away. Having said that, real-
ize that 1,000 feet is a generous estimate when outdoors on a clear day with
no wind blowing — you see what I’m getting at. In reality, when you set up
your wireless network, things such as walls — especially concrete walls, like
in basements — decrease the distance that you can cover. If you use a WAP,
plan on no more than 150 feet between wireless computers and the WAP.
However, your mileage might vary.
Wireless Ethernet networks operate just like wired Ethernet networks that
use a hub. (See Book V, Chapter 1 for more info on hubs.) This means that
the 11 Mbps bandwidth is shared between all computers using it. Collisions
can also occur if more than one computer tries to communicate at the same
time. If you have a lot of people on your wireless network, the network can
and will get noticeably slower because of increased collisions. Remember
that the total bandwidth is shared between the computers on the wireless
network. This applies not only to Wi-Fi but also to the 802.11a (which I cover
in the next section) and the 802.11g standards.
One last thing about 802.11b networking: Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency
range. It actually uses 11 different channels, but they’re all around the 2.4 GHz
range. I bring this up because if you’re using a 2.4 GHz cordless phone or
even a microwave, using either device can definitely interfere with or even

shut down your wireless network. Keep this in mind when you buy your next
phone or wonder why your file transfers stop when you’re communing with
Orville Redenbacher in the microwave.
802.11a
802.11a is a newer version of wireless Ethernet. No, I didn’t get my letters
mixed up. For some reason that I don’t know (or understand), 802.11b came
out first, and 802.11a came out next. (I guess someone ran into a doorframe.)
Anyway, 802.11a doesn’t have a generally recognized handy nickname like
Wi-Fi, so just call it 802.11a.
802.11a isn’t all that much different than Wi-Fi, but the few differences make a
big impact. First off, 802.11a can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps — almost five
times faster than Wi-Fi. This is because 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency range
instead of the cluttered 2.4 GHz range that Wi-Fi uses. The powers that be set
aside the 5 GHz range just for wireless networking, so cordless phones and
microwaves (or any other wireless devices for that matter) can’t interfere with
the network. The downside to using the higher 5 GHz range, though, is that the
distances that can be covered are even less than that of Wi-Fi — no more than
about 60 feet to maintain the highest speeds.
Remember, 802.11a equipment isn’t compatible with Wi-Fi or any of the
AirPort Base Stations, so don’t make the mistake of buying both 802.11b and
802.11a network equipment. Instead, I recommend that you follow the AirPort
Extreme course charted by Apple, and use the 802.11g standard (which is
backward-compatible with Wi-Fi).
Let’s get Extreme: 802.11g
Although some hardware manufacturers have designed equipment that will
handle both Wi-Fi and 802.11a, Apple’s release of AirPort Extreme provides
both the speed of 802.11a and the compatibility with Wi-Fi. That’s because 
it uses the 802.11g standard, which operates at speeds up to 54 Mbps (like
802.11a) but will also operate at the same frequency ranges and play nicely
with existing 802.11b equipment. (Notice that we’re heading in the right
direction again when it comes to naming conventions. Go figure.)
Oh, and did I mention that Apple is once again the first company to offer
802.11g hardware as standard equipment? Feel free to enjoy the Superiority
Dance yet again as you use AirPort Extreme.
Naturally, there is a downside: 802.11g returns to that pesky 2.4 GHz range,
so your cordless phone and microwave can also wreak the same havoc that
they did with your original AirPort equipment.

I should also mention Bluetooth — a strange name for a wireless standard, 
I admit, but it works like a charm. Bluetooth devices use 2.4 GHz as well, 
but they’re designed only for very short distances . . . only about 30 feet.
Bluetooth is the future for linking mobile devices (like personal digital assis-
tants and cellphones) and external peripherals (like wireless keyboards and
mice) to your Mac. In fact, Bluetooth is a popular feature for the iMac G5,
which can turn it into a completely cordless machine — except for the power
cord, of course. Tiger provides built-in support for Bluetooth through the
iSync application.
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
Are you worried about the security of your AirPort wireless network? You
should be, bunkie. As you might (or might not) know, the government has
said that intercepting calls made from wireless phones isn’t a violation of pri-
vacy. Because of the similarities between wireless phones and wireless net-
works, it stands to reason that if/when a court has to make a determination,
it will most likely determine that it’s not illegal for someone in the next apart-
ment or house — or standing right in your street — to listen to and intercept
your data from your wireless network.
But before you decide to toss the idea of a wireless network, keep this in
mind: Even though it is technically possible that someone might camp out
on your doorstep in order to gain access to your wireless network, for most
home networks, this possibility isn’t very probable. Even if someone tries to
gain access to your wireless network and perhaps even sniff your network —
a techno-nerd term meaning to record all the data flying around a network —
there isn’t a whole lot someone can do with that information.
If a friend invites you for an evening of war driving, think “recreational mobile
hacking.” War driving is the act of driving through neighborhoods in a car
equipped with a laptop computer and a wireless network card. The payoff? If
the hacker is lucky enough to locate a house with an open wireless network,
we’re talking free wireless Internet access . . . from the comfort of his car!
Again, keep security in mind when installing wireless hardware, and these
bozos will get nothing from your network.
You might say, “But I use my credit card on the Internet to buy stuff.” Sure,
this is a valid concern — however, if you purchase things on the Internet
with your credit card, you should already be using a secure connection pro-
vided by the Web site for your personal information so that the data you’re
sending across your wireless network is already encrypted and relatively
safe from thieves. (You’ll find more on this when I discuss Safari in detail in
Book IV, Chapter 5.)

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
516
“I have shared my files on my computer. Can the Bad Guys access those
shared files?” Another good question, but if you read Book V, Chapter 2, you
have to create an account for those whom you want to access your files.
Unless the would-be hacker is very good at guessing usernames and pass-
words, your files are pretty safe, too.
This is not to say that you bear absolutely no risk of being hacked. If a legiti-
mate user on your wireless network connects to your computer and starts
transferring a file, a would-be hacker could potentially record all the traffic
and then reconstruct the file that was sent from the data that was recorded.
In other words, a hacker could grab that user’s username and password.
That’s where WEP comes in.
WEP
Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is A Good Thing (even if it makes for a
silly-sounding acronym). It’s an encryption scheme that can be used on your
wireless network. WEP is a part of all 802.11 standards, so all your Wi-Fi
equipment supports WEP. Apple’s implementation of WEP comes in two vari-
eties: 40-bit and 128-bit. The more bits used in the encryption, the more
secure (and the better) it is.
To use WEP, you need to select a WEP key, which is really just a code word.
The longer the key, the better. Also, when making a key, be sure to use some-
thing like ab8sher7234ksief87 (something that’s random with letters and
numbers) as opposed to something like mykey that’s easily guessed. If you’re
using an Ad Hoc wireless network, all the computers need to have their wire-
less network card configured with the same WEP key in order to communi-
cate. If you’re using a WAP to connect to the rest of the network, you need to
use the same key on your computers that you’ve configured on your WAP.
One thing to note about WEP is that it has been broken, meaning that some-
one has figured out how to undo the encryption that WEP provides. For 
businesses, especially those with sensitive data, WEP is not a good security
solution.
However, for home users, WEP works well as a deterrent to keep people out.
In order for someone to crack your WEP key, that person needs to record
somewhere around 1 million encrypted packets or more. For a business, that
might only be an hour or so of monitoring for a hacker, but for most home
networks, this could take much longer. Remember that a typical home net-
work carries much less traffic than a business network. So, not only would
someone need to pitch a tent outside on your porch, he would need to be
able to record at least a million of the packets going over your network and
then have the knowledge to crack your encryption key. Although WEP isn’t
going to ward off the spies at the National Security Agency, it’s good enough
to protect home networks like yours and mine.

Other security standards
Although all Wi-Fi network equipment supports WEP, a few standards are
worth mentioning: LEAP and 802.11n.
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a protocol developed
by Cisco Systems. To use LEAP, you need to have a server that’s set up to
enable users to log in to gain permission to the wireless network. After you
initially log in (authenticate) to your network, LEAP changes encryption keys
on the fly at a time interval that you determine. You could set it so that every
15 minutes, your encryption key is changed: Even if someone is in that hypo-
thetical tent on your front lawn, he would never be able to record enough
packets to figure out your key because it changes so often.
Setting up a server so that you can use LEAP isn’t something for the novice to
attempt. I would encourage you to read up on LEAP only if you are very seri-
ous about airtight security on your WLAN. The Cisco Web site (www.cisco.
com) is a good place to read about LEAP.
All the Apple AirPort 2.0 (and above) and AirPort Extreme wireless network
cards and Base Stations are compatible with the Cisco LEAP for higher security.
The other thing worth mentioning is the new upcoming wireless standard
from IEEE: 802.11n. Right now, IEEE is still trying to hammer out many of the
fine details; however, the final 802.11n standard will probably be based on a
system very similar to Cisco’s LEAP. After 801.11n is ratified (agreed on and
finalized) by IEEE, expect to see it integrated with the other 802.11 standards.
And did I mention that 802.11n is slated to deliver throughput in excess of
100 Mbps? Don’t bet your house that you’ll get that kind of speed, though —
like the other members of the 802.11 family, that’s likely to be a theoretical
maximum speed.
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
On to the good stuff. This section describes installing an AirPort Extreme
card as well as how to set up an Ad Hoc or infrastructure-based WLAN (wire-
less LAN).
Installing an AirPort Extreme network card
Some Macs come with an AirPort (802.11b) or AirPort Extreme (802.11b and
802.11g) card built in, especially if you ordered one pre-installed. However, if
your Mac doesn’t have either type of AirPort card installed, you can usually
add one yourself. Naturally, older Macs don’t have a slot or antenna for an
AirPort card, such as the Indigo iMac with a 350 MHz CPU. However, all Mac
models in production at the time of this writing do have a slot for an AirPort

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
518
card, or have AirPort Extreme functionality built in. You just need to check
www.info.apple.com/applespec to see whether your particular Mac can
use an AirPort card.
In case you have any issues using AirPort or need more information about
anything related to AirPort, check this page at the Apple Web site:
www.apple.com/support/airport.
You should be able to use any standard 802.11b Wi-Fi or 802.11g card, but
you might run into some issues with drivers and such. Be sure that any 
non-AirPort/AirPort Extreme card that you might buy is backed up with 
Mac OS X drivers.
A variety of 802.11b/g wireless network devices are available, many of which
come with drivers for the Mac. Some of these devices connect via a Universal
Serial Bus (USB), which could be handy if you want to be able to move it
between a desktop Power Mac or iMac to an iBook and back (without the
hassle of opening the case each time). Before you can set up your wireless net-
work, you have to connect your wireless hardware. Because of the differences
between manufacturers, check the installation instructions that come with
whichever device that you choose.
After you have your AirPort, AirPort Extreme, or other 802.11b/g wireless
network card or device installed, you’re ready to connect.
Using non-Apple wireless equipment 
with AirPort Extreme equipment
Because of Apple’s implementation of wireless
standards within the AirPort Extreme product
line, keep in mind some things when trying to
mix Apple wireless equipment with other ven-
dors’ 802.11b or 802.11g equipment. As you dis-
cover elsewhere in this chapter, using AirPort
wireless networks can require a password,
which corresponds to the 802.11b/g WEP key for
encryption. However, the password that you
enter for AirPort networks isn’t exactly the same
as the WEP key for that same network. If you’re
using an AirPort network card and are trying to
connect to a non-Apple 802.11b WAP, you need
to follow a specific procedure. You can find 
this procedure by going to http://kbase.
info.apple.com/index.jsp and search-
ing on the number 106250 (the Apple Knowledge
Base article number). If you’re using a non-
Apple 802.11b network card and are trying to
connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station, go to
the same URL and search on 106864. These arti-
cles will show you how to convert the Apple
AirPort password to a WEP key and vice versa.
You want my opinion? Because of the issues of
using non-AirPort 802.11b/g hardware with The
Real Thing (AirPort/AirPort Extreme stuff), I rec-
ommend that you stick with Apple equipment if
possible.

Setting up an Ad Hoc wireless network
Using an Ad Hoc network — also called a computer-to-computer network — is
a fairly easy thing to accomplish in Mac OS X. Plus, you’re not limited to just
Macs: With an Ad Hoc network, you can also swap niceties with PCs and PDAs
that have 802.11b/g network interface cards (NICs) installed. This Ad Hoc net-
work is great for setting up an impromptu network in a classroom, exchanging
recipes and pictures at a family reunion in a park, or blowing your friend up
while gaming across the aisle of a Greyhound bus at 70 mph.
To set up an Ad Hoc network, you first have to create the computer-to-
computer network on one of your Macs. This takes advantage of the AirPort
Software Base Station that’s built into Mac OS X. To create a computer-to-
computer network, follow these steps:
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
If you haven’t set Tiger to display your AirPort status in the Finder menu
bar, run Internet Connect in your Applications folder and click the AirPort
toolbar button. Select the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box to
enable it, and then press Ô+Q to quit Internet Connect. Alternatively, open
the Network pane in System Preferences, click the Show drop-down list
box, and choose the AirPort entry. You’ll see the AirPort Status check box
is among these settings as well.
2. Click the Network drop-down list box and click Create Network to dis-
play the dialog that you see in Figure 4-1.
3. Enter a name for your network.
4. Click Show Options (if necessary) and mark the Enable Encryption
check box to turn on WEP encryption.

5. Enter a password for your network, and then enter it again to con-
firm it.
Although you can leave encryption disabled, I highly recommend that
you turn it on and choose a password for that extra bit of security. (Just
call me Security Man.) Note that the password must be an exact length
(which is determined by whether you choose a 40-bit (5-character) key
or a 128-bit (13-character) key).
Out of the 11 channels available for 802.11b networks, channels 1, 6, and
11 are the only ones that don’t overlap other channels — and are there-
fore the best choices to use. If you’re close to other WAPs, AirPort Base
Stations, or other Ad Hoc networks, you need to try to find a channel
that’s not being used, or performance can be degraded. (If you have only
one access point, it doesn’t matter which channel you select — just allow
Tiger to automatically select a channel, which is typically Channel 11.)
6. Click OK.
Creating a computer-to-computer network gives the illusion of having an
AirPort Base Station. So for people to join your network, they would follow
the same steps that they would to join any other AirPort network, as I cover
in the next section.
Setting up wireless networks 
with an AirPort Base Station
After one computer is running a computer-to-computer network or you’ve
set up and configured an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, you’re ready
to invite other computers with wireless hardware to the party.
Joining in an existing AirPort network
After you have a network set up on one of your wireless-enabled computers,
you just need to have the other wireless-enabled computers join that net-
work. You can use the same process, as I describe here, to join any wireless
network. Simply click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar, and then
select an existing network connection that you’d like to join from the list that
appears in the AirPort menu.
If you want to join a network whose name doesn’t appear in the list — also
called a closed network — select Other from the AirPort status menu and then
enter the name of the network that you want to join and the password (if any
is required). A closed network is another added measure of security — one
that’s good enough for most people because it’s very unlikely that a hacker is
going to try to hack a hidden network.

Disconnecting from an AirPort network
To disconnect from an AirPort/AirPort Extreme network, you can turn off
your AirPort card altogether, which I cover in the next section. (Simplicity,
they say, is an art.) Another way is to simply connect to another AirPort 
network — but this option is really only useful if you actually want to con-
nect to another network.
Turning your AirPort card on or off
You might want to use your Mac, usually your laptop, in a place where your
wireless card shouldn’t be used, like on an airplane (when they tell you to
turn off all cellphones) or in a hospital in an area that doesn’t allow cell-
phones or other wireless devices. Plus, turning off your AirPort/AirPort
Extreme card will conserve your notebook’s battery life. Being able to turn
your AirPort/AirPort Extreme card on and off actually has its uses.
To turn your AirPort card on or off via the AirPort status icon on the menu
bar, give it a click and choose Turn AirPort On/Off from the resulting menu.
If you would like to control exactly which wireless network cards can access
your wireless network, go to http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.jsp
and search on 58571, which is the Apple Knowledge Base article number of a
document that explains exactly how to limit access to your network to spe-
cific wireless network cards.

A
lthough I discuss lots of fun stuff that you can do with your network in
previous chapters, this has to be my favorite: sharing a single Internet
connection between all the computers on your network. If you have more
than one computer, I’m sure that you’ve had to deal with the dilemma that
pops up whenever more than one person wants or needs to access the
Internet at the same time.
Luckily, because most small home and office local area networks (LANs) 
use our old friend TCP/IP for network communications, connecting an entire
network to the Internet isn’t as troublesome a task as you might think. In
this chapter, I talk about different hardware and software options for sharing
your Internet connection as well as how to include your wireless devices.
Sharing the Internet
Sharing a single Internet connection between all your computers can be a
boon simply because of the reduced chances of random acts of violence.
Internet deprivation can be an ugly thing, you know. Although I won’t 
claim that Internet sharing will save lives, it can indeed save you from
headaches and arguments when more than one person wants to use the
Internet at once.

Using Network Address Translation
524
Throughout this chapter, I talk a lot about cable modems and Asynchronous
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. Both of these are high-speed
Internet connections — both are relatively inexpensive — that are offered 
by your local cable company and your local phone company, respectively.
The phone company offers different kinds of digital subscriber line (DSL)
connections, the most common of which is ADSL. However, because differ-
ent kinds of DSL connections exist, in this chapter, I refer to them all generi-
cally as DSL.
To share your Internet connection, you need a few things, so here’s a quick
checklist:
✦An Internet connection: This could be a dialup Internet connection that’s
accessed via a standard v.90/v.92 analog telephone modem, or it could
be a cable or DSL modem connection.
✦A LAN: You need a standard LAN (which is connected with cables) or a
wireless LAN. See Book V, Chapter 1 for more information about setting
up a LAN and Book V, Chapter 4 for more on setting up a Wireless LAN
(WLAN).
✦An Internet-sharing device: I use the word device because the method
that you use to share your Internet connection could be software that
you run on one of your computers or hardware that is standalone,
depending on how you connect to the Internet and what fits your 
needs best.
When you have these three things ready to go, you can share your Internet
connection. However, you need to know some background information to
help you choose the right components and get everything up and running.
Using Network Address Translation
You must determine one thing before you start your Internet sharing quest:
the set of network Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you’ll use. If you
used Book V, Chapter 1 to set up and configure your LAN, you might recall
that I suggest a specific range of IP addresses to use on your LAN. In case
you missed out on Chapter 1 of this mini-book, I briefly cover this important
topic again so that you can share your Internet connection smoothly.
(Forgive me if I wax technical, but ’tis only for the moment.)

Book V
Chapter 5
Sharing That
Precious 
Internet Thing
Using Network Address Translation
525
When talking about IP addresses, the ruling body that tracks IP addresses
and where they are used has broken all IP addresses up into two parts:
✦Public IP addresses: Public IP addresses are used to communicate on
the Internet, and only one device in the entire world can use a given
public IP address at any given time.
✦Private IP addresses: Private addresses, on the other hand, are sup-
posed to be used only on networks (like your home LAN) and do not
connect directly to the Internet. Lots of people can use the same 
private address because their networks never go public: That is, they
never access the Internet, so their IP addresses never conflict.
Typically, you’ll use addresses in the form of 192.168.x.x on your LAN. See
Book V, Chapter 1 for an overview of IP addresses and how they work.
You might be wondering to yourself thusly: “If I use private IP addresses 
on my LAN at home or in the office and I have to use a public IP address 
to communicate on the Internet, how can my private IP addresses on my
LAN communicate with public IP addresses on the Internet?” That is an
excellent question, and the answer is Network Address Translation (or NAT
for short).
NAT acts as a gatekeeper between your private IP addresses on your LAN
and the public IP addresses on the Internet. When you connect to the
Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP) gives you one — and usually
only one — public IP address that can be used on the Internet. Instead of
one of your computers using that public IP address and depriving all the
other computers on the LAN, the hardware or software that you use to 
share the Internet will take control of that public IP address. Then, when 
any computer on your LAN tries to communicate on the Internet, your NAT
software/hardware intercepts your communications and readdresses the
traffic so that it appears to be coming from your allotted public IP address.
(Think of a funnel that collects water from several different sources and 
then directs all the water into a single stream.)
When the Web site, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or whatever strange
Internet intelligence you’re using on the Internet replies, it replies to your
NAT device. The NAT device remembers which private IP address it should
go to on the LAN and sends the information to that computer. See NAT at
work in Figure 5-1.

526
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
After you have an Internet connection and your LAN is set up, you need some-
thing to make this NAT thing work. You have two different options to take care
of NAT for your shared Internet connection: hardware or software. (Go figure.)
Each has pros and cons, so take a look at each option individually.
If you’ve already read Chapter 4 of this mini-book, you know that Tiger has
AirPort software built in. So, if you have an AirPort or AirPort Extreme wire-
less network card in your Mac and you’re using Tiger, you can have your
Mac act like an AirPort Base Station for all the wireless computers on your
network, which in turn can use a software NAT.
Using hardware for sharing an Internet connection
Probably the most popular way to share an Internet connection is to buy 
a hardware device that connects to your Internet connection, which then

connects to your LAN. These devices are referred to as cable/DSL routers.
The main downside to a hardware Internet connection-sharing device is that
it costs more than a software solution.
Don’t let the name throw you: Although these devices are usually used to
share cable/DSL connections, many have the ability to use an external analog
telephone modem to connect to a standard dialup Internet account.
Cable/DSL routers are nice because they’re easy to set up and configure.
Too, you can leave them on, which means constant Internet access for those
on your LAN. You don’t have to worry about turning on another computer to
connect to the Internet like you do with a software solution. Sounds like a
good spot for a Mark’s Maxim: In my opinion, hardware routers are the best
choice for sharing your Internet connection, so if you can afford one, you
should get one.
Hardware routers are the best choice for sharing your Internet 
connection, so if you can afford one, you should get one!™
Apple’s AirPort and AirPort Extreme Base Stations are not only Wireless
Access Points (WAPs) for your network, as I discuss in Chapter 4 of this
mini-book, but they also act as Internet connection-sharing devices. (The
AirPort Express can’t share an Internet connection . . . sorry.) Some flavors
of AirPort Base Station have a built-in v.90 modem for sharing a single 56 Kbps
connection using a dialup account as well as two Ethernet connections for
sharing a high-speed Internet connection: one to connect to a cable/DSL
router and one to connect to the LAN.
If you think that a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station could
be the karma pathway for you to achieve your goal of sharing your Internet
connection, here are some things to consider when deciding which device to
buy for your LAN:
✦Do you need a switch? Most cable/DSL routers have a small 3-, 4-, or 
5-port switch built in. Refer to Chapter 1 of this mini-book to discover
more about hubs and switches. This multiport capability is nice because
the same cable/DSL router that shares your Internet connection is also
the centerpiece of your LAN where all your connections meet, thus
saving you from having to buy a hub or switch on top of the cost of the
cable/DSL router.
Some cable/DSL routers, however, have only a single Ethernet connec-
tion to connect to your LAN. So keep in mind that if you choose a device
with a single LAN connection, you must supply your own hub or switch
that would then connect the cable/DSL router to the rest of your LAN.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
528
✦Got modem? On your cable/DSL router, look for a built-in analog tele-
phone modem, like the one that you find on the more expensive model 
of AirPort Extreme. If your only Internet connection is through a dialup
modem account, you must have this feature if you want to use a hardware
device to share your Internet connection. AirPort Extreme is great for this
because the modem is built in. Even if you have cable/DSL service, most
ISPs also include a dialup account with it. With such a bountiful selection
of connections, you can plug in both your cable or DSL service to the
cable/DSL router as well as use the dialup account as a backup in case
your main service has problems.
✦Want a printer with that? Some cable/DSL routers also have a port for
connecting a printer — a great feature to have because it allows you to
leave the printer connected and turned on so that anyone on the net-
work can print to it anytime. (This is much better than connecting the
printer to a computer and sharing it because then the computer doing
the sharing must always be on in order to make the printer available.)
Mac OS X can send a print job to a printer by using Bonjour or TCP/
IP, so just make sure that your printer is compatible with TCP/IP print-
ing, also called LPR (Line Printer Remote).
Using software for sharing an Internet connection
As I mention earlier, if you’re using Mac OS X Tiger and have an AirPort or
AirPort Extreme wireless network card installed, your Mac can act like an
AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, providing both wireless Ethernet con-
nectivity for other computers on the LAN and a shared Internet connection.
Tiger also has built-in software that allows a single computer on your network
to share its Internet connection with others on the LAN. To share your Internet
connection, follow these quick steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Internet tab of the Sharing dialog.
This brings up the settings shown in Figure 5-2.
4. Click the Share Your Connection From drop-down list and choose
Built-in Ethernet.
5. Select the Built-in Ethernet check box (in the To Computers Using list)
to enable it.
When you do, you will be issued a warning that enabling this could
affect your ISP or violate your agreement with your ISP. In my experi-
ences, this step has never caused any networking problems. However, if
you have any doubts, contact your ISP and verify this.

6. Click OK in the warning dialog to continue.
You go back to the Sharing dialog, which now has a Start button.
7. Click Start to enable Internet sharing.
If you’re using a dialup modem to access the Internet, you need to also make
sure that the computer that has the modem also has an Ethernet or wireless
LAN connection. The iMac is a great example of a computer that can do this
because it has both a built-in modem and an Ethernet connection.
If you’re using a cable or DSL modem for your Internet connection, the Mac
that you want to run the sharing software on should have two Ethernet con-
nections: one to connect to the cable/DSL modem and one to connect to the
rest of the LAN.
The main disadvantage to using a software solution for Internet connection
sharing is that the computer that connects to the Internet must be turned 
on and ready to go all the time so that others on the network can get to the
Internet. And although the sharing software operates in the background on
the machine it’s running on, it still chews up some of that Mac’s processing
power and memory, so it could slow down other applications that you’re
running on that computer.

Connecting Everything

Connecting Everything
After you decide whether to use a software or hardware solution, it’s time 
to get your hands dirty: All the pieces of the puzzle must be set up and 
connected. In this section, I tell you how to connect things for either the
software or hardware method of sharing the Internet connection.
Using the software method
When you use the software method to share your Internet connection, one of
the computers on your network has both the connection to the Internet and a
connection to the LAN. Figure 5-3 shows a typical setup for software Internet
sharing, whether you’re using a dialup modem account or a cable/DSL modem
for your Internet connection.
Keep in mind, though, that when using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet
connection, the computer running the sharing software must have two
Ethernet connections. If you’re using a standard dialup modem for Internet
access, chances are that it’s built into the computer used for sharing the
Internet connection.
Using the hardware method
Not only does using a dedicated piece of hardware free one of the Macs on
your network from the onerous job of hosting the shared connection, but it
also keeps you from having to have more than one Ethernet connection on a
single computer if you’re using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet access.
Figure 5-4 shows how you would connect your devices for hardware Internet
sharing by using either a cable/DSL router with a built-in Ethernet switch or
a cable/DSL router with a standalone Ethernet hub or switch, like you would
need to use AirPort or AirPort Extreme.
If you choose to buy a cable/DSL router that has a built-in Ethernet switch,
you can simply connect all your computers on the LAN to the built-in switch.
However, if you buy a cable/DSL router that has only a single LAN connec-
tion, like AirPort/AirPort Extreme, you must connect that single LAN connec-
tion to an external hub or switch in order to get all the computers on the
same network.
Regardless of whether you use the hardware or software method to share
your Internet connection, all the computers on your LAN — except the one
that’s doing the sharing if you’re using software sharing — should be config-
ured to obtain its IP address automatically through our old friend, Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). (See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for

detailed instructions on how to do this in Tiger.) Although it’s not a require-
ment that you set up your other devices with DHCP, it is recommended unless
you understand the IP addressing scheme required by your cable/DSL router
and you are willing to set up the addresses manually. You need to follow the
instructions that come with the cable/DSL router or software that you pur-
chase for detailed information on how to configure that.

Adding Wireless Support
You might have noticed that I mention wireless here and there in this chap-
ter. This section is going to cover in a bit more detail how you can add wire-
less capabilities to your shared Internet party. To discover more about how
wireless networks work and how to set one up, see Book V, Chapter 4.

Adding Wireless Support
533
Basically, you’ll encounter a couple of situations when trying to add wireless
capabilities into the mix. Either you already have an Internet connection-
sharing mechanism in place (either hardware or software), or you don’t yet
have your Internet connection shared.
If you already have a cable/DSL router 
or are using software Internet sharing
If you already have a cable/DSL router or if you’re using software Internet
sharing, like that built into Tiger, you can simply buy a WAP and connect it to
your LAN. Adding a WAP enables anyone using wireless Ethernet access to
your network and thus to your shared Internet connection. There are many
WAPs that you can buy to add wireless to your network. AirPort and AirPort
Extreme are good examples; however, because AirPort also can do Internet
sharing, make sure that you don’t enable the Internet sharing on the AirPort
card! (In this case, you don’t want or need this feature because it can conflict
with your cable/DSL router operation.)
If you do not have a cable/DSL router 
or an AirPort Base Station
If you don’t have a cable/DSL router or an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base
Station for Internet sharing, you have a few options. Each option has an
upside and downside.
One option is to get an AirPort or AirPort Extreme Base Station, which 
provides both wireless access for AirPort-enabled wireless computers and
Internet sharing for the entire network. If your Base Station has only a single
LAN Ethernet connection and you have more than one computer using wired
Ethernet, you must buy an additional hub or switch to connect them.
The other option is to buy a combination cable/DSL router, which has a
built-in WAP. Most cable/DSL routers — including the ones that have wireless
built in — also have multiple Ethernet ports on them, so connecting comput-
ers by using wired Ethernet can be done without buying an external hub or
switch.
The final option is that you can use the AirPort software built into Tiger to
turn your Mac into an Airport or AirPort Extreme Base Station — that is, if
you have an AirPort wireless card on that particular Mac. This is a great,
low-cost way to add wireless and Internet sharing to your network. However,
many Macs don’t come with an AirPort wireless card built in, and you still
can eat up processor time and memory by running the AirPort software. For
more on wireless networking, read Chapter 4 of this mini-book.

ardware. We love it. To a Mac power user, new hardware holds all the
promise of Christmas morning, whether your new toys are used for
business or for pleasure. We pore over magazines and visit our favorite Mac
Web sites like clockwork to check on new technology.
These hardware devices don’t come cheap, however, forcing you to make
the painful decision of deciding which new hardware you really need in order
to accomplish what you want and which hardware is a luxury. Also, if you’re
a new Mac owner, you might not know what’s available. For example, I con-
stantly get e-mail from readers, asking, “What can I connect to my new com-
puter?” I guess I could reply, “Why, the kitchen sink!” To that end, I decided
to add this chapter to the book to let you know how you can expand the
hardware for your Mac OS X Tiger powerhouse.
Each section in this chapter provides a description of what a particular device
does, approximately how much it costs, and a set of general guidelines that
you can use when shopping. Although this isn’t in-depth coverage — after all,
the book is supposed to be about Tiger — it will serve to get you started if
you’ve just become a Mac owner. If you’re especially interested in a specific
piece of hardware, I recommend other books that you can read for the
exhaustive details.
Ready? To quote a great line from the first Batman film: “Alfred, let’s go
shopping!”

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
538
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, 
DV Camcorders, and Scanners
The first category of hardware toys revolves around images — hardware for
creating original images, capturing images in real-time, and reading images
from hard copy.
Digital cameras
A digital camera shares most of the characteristics of a traditional film
camera. It looks the same, and you use the same techniques while shooting
photographs. The difference is in the end result. With a digital camera, instead
of a roll of film that has to be developed, you have an image in JPEG or TIFF
format that’s stored on a memory card. The contents of the memory card
can be downloaded to your Mac from within iPhoto (which I discuss with
great pleasure in Book III, Chapter 3), and then the real fun begins. Here are
some things that you can do with a digital photograph:
✦Edit it with an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop
✦Print it with an inkjet or color laser printer
✦Record it to a CD or DVD
✦Add it to a Web page
✦Print several of them in a coffee-table book (using iPhoto)
✦Mail it to friends and family
What they cost
Consumer-level digital cameras typically sell for anywhere from $100 (for a 
2-megapixel [MP] model) to $500 (for a 6MP camera). Megapixel is a general
reference to the resolution (the size of the image, measured in individual dots
called pixels) and detail delivered by the camera. Such digital cameras can
produce photographs that are well suited for just about any casual shutter-
bug. Professional digital cameras, which capture far more detail and offer
designs that more closely resemble the best SLR film camera, can set you
back $1,000 or $2,000. Because of their cost and complexity, I wouldn’t rec-
ommend them to someone who’s just discovered digital photography.
What to look for
Here are some general guidelines that I recommend when selecting a digital
camera:

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will
Make You Giddy
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
539
✦At least a 3MP camera: As a general rule, the higher the megapixel
value, the better the camera.
✦At least a 32MB memory card: The memory card stores the images that
you capture.
✦A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to your Macintosh: USB is cov-
ered in all its glory in Chapter 3 of this mini-book. USB 2.0 is definitely a
better choice than a slower USB 1.1 connection.
✦An optical zoom feature: Optical zoom allows you to draw closer to sub-
jects that are farther away.
Note that I recommended optical zoom there and not digital zoom.
Essentially, digital zoom is a silly feature that simply resizes a portion 
of your image, providing a blocky close-up. In fact, an image editor like
Photoshop Elements can produce exactly the same result as a camera
with digital zoom . . . and it looks as bad. Only an optical zoom results in
a sharper magnification of the subject.
✦A self-timer: With a self-timer, your camera can snap a photo automati-
cally, allowing you to finally be seen in your own pictures!
✦A manual flash setting: Although automatic flash is a good thing most 
of the time, a manual setting allows you to disable your camera’s flash
for artistic shots (or just to prevent the glare on subjects with polished
surfaces).
For a full (even exhaustive) exposé of everything in digital photography,
check out Digital Photos, Movies, & Music Gigabook For Dummies, edited by
some guy named Mark L. Chambers (Wiley). Believe me, if it’s got anything
to do with digital photography, it’s in there!
DV camcorders
Like digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders are the counterpart to the
familiar video camcorder. A DV camcorder looks and operates like a VHS cam-
corder, but you can connect it to your Macintosh via a FireWire cable and
download your video clips directly into iMovie. (Chapter 4 of Book III explains
all about iMovie, and FireWire is tackled in Chapter 3 of this mini-book.)
Besides the higher quality of digital video, it has a number of other real
advantages over analog video:
✦Digital video can be edited with applications such as iMovie or Adobe
Premiere.
✦Digital video can be recorded to a CD or DVD.
✦Digital video can be posted for downloading on a Web page.

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
540
What they cost
A typical DV camcorder starts at about $400, with the more desirable MiniDV
camcorders selling for around $800.
If a DV camcorder is too costly of an investment, you can always convert
analog video — video from your current VHS camcorder or VCR — into digi-
tal video by using an inexpensive device called an AV converter.
What to look for
I recommend the following when shopping for a DV camcorder:
✦The highest optical zoom in your price range: Again, like a digital
camera, it’s important to be able to capture subjects and action when
you can’t get any closer — think the lion exhibit at the zoo.
✦Image stabilization: This helps steady the picture when you’re holding
the camcorder without a tripod.
✦Onboard effects: These effects generally include some snazzy things
like black and white footage, fades, and wipes.
✦AV connectors: Use these to display your video by connecting the cam-
corder directly to your TV.
✦Support for FireWire (IEEE 1394) connectivity: For more details on
FireWire, see Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
✦Digital still mode: This enables you to take still photographs if your digi-
tal camera isn’t handy; however, the image quality isn’t as good as a
bona fide digital camera.
For an in-depth look at digital video, check out Digital Video For Dummies,
3rd Edition, by Keith Underdahl (Wiley).
Scanners
Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical flatbed scanner, which is the tool of choice for
those Macintosh owners who want to digitize images and text from printed
materials. Although you can also connect a sheet-fed scanner, flatbed models
are much more versatile and produce better-quality scans.
Images produced by a scanner can be edited, mailed, displayed on the 
Web, or added to your own documents, just like the images from a digital
camera.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will
Make You Giddy
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
541
What they cost
A good-quality scanner should cost anywhere from $100–$300, with the best
models — featuring the fastest scanning speeds, best color depth, and high-
est resolutions, or those meant for scanning film negatives — going for any-
where from $500–$1,000.
What to look for
Try to get the following features in a scanner:
✦The highest color depth that you can afford: Get a minimum of 48-bit.
✦The highest resolution that you can afford: Get a minimum of 1200 dots
per inch (dpi) (optical).
✦Single-pass scanning: This feature results in a faster scan with less
chance of error.
✦Transparency adapter for scanning film negatives: If you’re a traditional
film photographer, you’ll find that a transparency adapter turns a stan-
dard flatbed scanner into an acceptable negative scanner.
✦One-touch buttons for e-mailing your scanned images or uploading
them to the Web: These are controls of convenience — pressing one of
these buttons automatically scans the item and prepares the image to be
e-mailed or uploaded to a Web site.
✦USB or FireWire connection: I cover the advantages of both in Chapter 3
of this mini-book.
Another shameless (but good-natured) plug. My best-selling book Scanners
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) offers comprehensive coverage of all types
of scanners, as well as chapters devoted to advanced features, image editing,
and step-by-step projects.

Although your Mac is already equipped with a keyboard and a mouse, you
can replace them with enhanced hardware that will add functionality and
precision to your work. (Or, you can buy a joystick and spend your days
wreaking havoc on your enemies.)
Keyboards
If you’re using the latest iMac G5 or G5 tower model, you don’t really need to
upgrade your keyboard. These new machines come with excellent keyboards
already, replete with volume controls and a Media Eject key. However, if you’re
using an older Macintosh — or you have an iBook or PowerBook and you
want to add an external keyboard — you can take advantage of the conven-
ience of a USB keyboard like the one in Figure 1-2.
What they cost
Aftermarket (nonstandard-issue) keyboards generally cost anywhere from
$30–$100.
What to look for
Look for the following keyboard features when shopping for a keyboard:

✦One-touch buttons to launch your browser or e-mail application: Press
one of these buttons to launch your Web browser or Mail.
✦Ergonomic wrist pad: Use these to help prevent wrist strain and repeti-
tive joint injuries.
Trackballs
Some folks prefer using a trackball, like the one shown in Figure 1-3, over a
mouse any day. Graphic artists find that trackballs are more precise and offer
better control, usually including a secondary button to display contextual
menus. (One model on the market has eight buttons. Who needs a keyboard?)

Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
544
What they cost
Trackballs range in price from $50–$90. Most are optical (see the following
section), so they need little cleaning, and they’ll last for many years of pre-
cise pointing at things.
What to look for
Look for the following features when shopping for a trackball:
✦More programmable buttons: Opt for at least two buttons!
✦Optical tracking: An optical trackball — one that doesn’t use rollers,
instead using a photosensitive sensor to record the movement of the
ball — is more precise and easier to keep clean.
✦A scroll wheel: Use this gizmo to scroll documents up and down.
✦Ergonomic design: Look for a wrist pad or slanted buttons.
Joysticks
Game players, unite! For arcade and sports games, using a joystick results in
increased maneuverability, more realistic action, higher scores, less wear
and tear on your keyboard . . . and just plain more fun. Joysticks range from
the traditional USB aircraft controller shown in Figure 1-4 to USB controllers
and gamepads that rival anything offered on the PlayStation 2 or the Xbox.

What they cost
Joysticks vary in price from $30–$120. At the low end, you’ll usually find the
gamepad-type controllers, and aircraft controllers carry the highest price tag.
What to look for
Get the following features in a joystick:
✦Yet even more programmable buttons.
✦Pitch and yaw controls. These are for the flight simulator crowd.
✦Force feedback. A force feedback joystick rumbles and moves in tandem
with the action in the game, providing an extra feeling of realism.
Drawing tablets
A drawing tablet like the one you see in Figure 1-5 might be pricey, but if
you’re a graphic artist or a designer, using a tablet will revolutionize the 
way that you work with your Mac — especially with the Inkwell technology
built into Mac OS X. Rather than use a mouse or trackball to sketch, you can
draw on the tablet freehand, just like you would draw on paper or canvas.
Tablets can recognize different levels of pressure, allowing applications 
such as Photoshop and Painter to re-create all sorts of photo-realistic brush
effects.

Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders and Tape Drives
546
What they cost
Depending on the size of the tablet, you’ll pay anywhere from around $100 
to a whopping $500, depending on the size and the pressure levels that you
need.
What to look for
I recommend the following tablet features:
✦Programmable buttons: See a trend here?
✦Accessory mouse: Some high-end tablets include a mouse that you can
use along with the tablet.
✦A cordless stylus: Make sure that it doesn’t require batteries.
✦The highest number of pressure levels possible: The more levels that
the tablet offers, the more subtle and precise your control is over paint-
ing effects.
Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders and Tape Drives
I don’t include Zip drives in this category because the arrival of cheap, reli-
able optical storage has rendered a 750MB Zip cartridge obsolete. Even the
once-awesome 2.2GB capacity of the original Orb drive seems a little insig-
nificant next to a rewriteable DVD-RW drive, which can store 4.7GB on a
single disc.
If you’d like to trade data with another Mac or a PC via floppy disks, you 
can get an external USB floppy drive for under $50 — however, I personally
eschew floppy disks, which are very unreliable and carry a mere 1.44MB of
data. Pick up a USB Flash drive instead.
CD and DVD recorders
Virtually all recent Mac models include a rewriteable optical drive — either a
CD-RW or the DVD-R SuperDrive — but if your computer is older and didn’t
come equipped with a recorder, you can always add an external model, like
the external DVD-RW drive shown in Figure 1-6.
What they cost
A typical USB or FireWire CD-RW drive costs about $100. A FireWire DVD-RW
drive averages about $200.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will

Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders and Tape Drives
547
What to look for
Get the following features in an external CD-RW/DVD-RW drive:
✦An internal buffer of at least 2MB: The larger the buffer, the less chance
that you’ll encounter recording errors and the faster your drive will burn.
✦At least 8X DVD recording speed: A no-brainer here. The faster the
recording speed, the less time you’ll wait for the finished disc.
✦AC power through the USB 2.0 or FireWire cable: This eliminates the
need for a separate AC power supply.
✦Burn-proof technology: This virtually eliminates recording errors because
of multitasking so that you can continue to work on other applications
while you record.
Okay, just one more. I’m very proud of another of my books in the For
Dummies series, CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). It
covers everything that you need to know about producing all sorts of discs —
everything from basic data and audio CDs to DVDs and more exotic formats
such as CD Extra. Mac owners will be happy to know that this book covers
the Mac like a blanket, too.
Tape drives
If you’re looking for a real high-capacity back-up solution, use a tape drive. A
tape drive is a storage device that uses a tape cartridge (much like a music
cassette). A Travan tape drive (which averages about 40–60GB of storage) is
much less expensive than a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) drive, which has a
higher capacity of 120GB or more.
Figure 1-6:

548
What they cost
Travan drives typically range around $500 (storing around 60–80GB per tape),
and most DAT drives start at $1,000 (and can store several gigabytes of data
on a single tape).
What to look for
Get the following features in a tape drive:
✦Hardware data compression: This provides a faster backup on fewer
tapes.
✦Automatic head cleaning: Head cleaning helps reduce errors while writ-
ing data (and reading it back later).
✦FireWire connection: A FireWire drive provides much faster data trans-
fer, so your backups take a fraction of the time needed by a USB tape
drive.
✦A transfer rate of at least 12 Mbps: The faster the transfer rate, the
shorter the time necessary to back up your drive!
Awesome Audio: Subwoofer Systems 
and MP3 Hardware
Although virtually all Macs ship with speakers, I’ll be honest — the “stock”
speakers don’t measure up to the standards of a true audiophile. For those
who really enjoy their music and their game audio, this last section covers
the world of Macintosh aftermarket sonic enjoyment.
Subwoofer speaker systems
The ever-popular USB port again comes to your rescue. This time, it enables
you to connect a more powerful speaker system with a subwoofer, like the
one shown in Figure 1-7. If you’ve never heard a subwoofer — think chest-
rattling thump, thump, thump — they provide the basement-level bass that
can add power and punch to both your music and your games. Being hit by
an asteroid is a rather flat, tinny experience with a pair of battery-powered
speakers that you salvaged from your Walkman years ago. With a new set of
speakers and a subwoofer, you’ll swear that Han Solo is sitting in the cockpit
chair next to you!
With the growing importance of the computer as a replacement for your
home entertainment center, investing in a more powerful set of speakers will
help you enjoy all those audio CDs and MP3s that you’ve added to your
iTunes Playlists. (Read all about iTunes in Book III, Chapter 2.)

549
What they cost
Most USB-powered speakers with a subwoofer are priced below $200, but
true audiophiles looking for surround sound can spring for a $500 system
that includes several satellite speakers and a subwoofer.
What to look for
Get these features in a subwoofer:
✦At least 30 watts of power: The higher the wattage rating, the more
powerful the speakers (and the louder your music can be).
✦Additional headphone jacks and stereo mini-plug input jacks: Use
these for connecting your iPod or MP3 player directly to your speaker
system. (Read all about iPods in the next section.)
✦Magnetic shielding: This helps prevent your speakers from distorting
your monitor display.
MP3 players (well, actually, just the iPod)
I’ve lusted after Apple’s iPod MP3 player ever since it arrived on campus.
Depending on which model you get, this incredible device can hold anywhere
from 512MB–60GB of MP3 digital audio — that’s over 15,000 songs of average
length in the 60GB version! Plus, the iPod also acts as your personal data
butler by carrying your files; it’s an honest-to-goodness, external FireWire

drive. (USB 2.0 connectivity is also supported. If you pick up an iPod Shuffle, it
acts as a USB Flash drive and supports only USB 2.0.) You can download your
contacts and appointments from Mac OS X and view them wherever you go,
and some models can now display color photos as well. Just think: Carry your
files to and from your office and carry Devo and the Dead Kennedys as well!
Oh, and did I mention that you can play games with the latest iPod models?
All this fits into a beautiful, stylish package about the size of a pack of ciga-
rettes, with up to a 18-hour lithium rechargeable battery, high-quality earbud
headphones, and automatic synchronization with your iTunes MP3 library.
(The iPod Shuffle is even smaller — it’s about the size of a pack of chewing
gum.) Life just doesn’t get any better for a technoid like me. If you think that
your Mac is a well-designed piece of equipment, you’ll understand why this
little box is so alluring. (And why I have one now.)
Sure, there are other MP3 players out there, but most of them share the
same following problems:
✦They use digital memory cards, which offer far less capacity than 
the iPod.
✦They use standard batteries, or you have to furnish rechargeable batter-
ies (which don’t last 18 hours).
✦They don’t operate as an external hard drive, photo slideshow reposi-
tory, or a contacts/appointment database.
I say forget ’em. The iPod is worth every cent that you’ll pay.
The 512MB iPod Shuffle is less than $100 at the time of this writing, while the
4GB iPod mini runs $199 and the 60GB iPod photo model costs $449.

ost Macintosh owners will make two upgrades — adding more memory
(RAM) and additional hard drive space — during the lifetime of their
computers. These two improvements have the greatest effect on the overall
performance of Mac OS X. By adding RAM and additional hard drive space,
you not only make more elbow room for your applications and documents,
but everything runs faster: Think of the Six Million Dollar Man, only a heck of
a lot cheaper to operate (and no strange noises accompanying your every
move).
In this chapter, I steer you around the hidden potholes along the way for
those who aren’t well versed in selecting memory modules or weighing the
advantages of different types of hard drives. However, if you buy the wrong
piece of hardware, remember that using a hammer to make it fit is not a
workable option.
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
Of all the possible upgrades that you can make to your Macintosh, adding
more random access memory (RAM) is the single most cost-effective method
of increasing the performance of Mac OS X. (In fact, your machine will likely
run faster with more memory than a reasonably faster processor!) Here is
exactly what Mac OS X uses available RAM for:
✦Applications: Naturally, Mac OS X needs system RAM to run the applica-
tions that you launch. The more memory in your machine, the larger the
applications that you can open and the faster they’ll run.

Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
552
✦Overhead: This includes the operating system itself, Classic mode (if it’s
running), as well as various and sundry buffers and memory areas
devoted for temporary work. As you would guess, the more memory
here, the merrier. (For more information on the settings that control
Classic mode, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
✦Virtual memory: A-ha! Now here’s something that I mention lightly and
politely in Book I but didn’t really amount to a hill of beans until this
moment. (Can you tell I’m a big fan of Bing Crosby?) Virtual memory
allows Mac OS X to use empty hard drive space as temporary system
memory, as shown in Figure 2-1. Data is written to your hard drive
instead of being stored in RAM, and then it’s erased when it’s no longer
needed. It’s a neat trick that’s also used by Windows, Linux, and dear old
Mac OS 9 (just nowhere near as well as Mac OS X). Virtual memory
works automatically within Mac OS X, so you don’t have to enable it
manually as you did in Mac OS 9.
At first, virtual memory sounds like absolute bliss, and it does indeed allow
your Macintosh to do things that would otherwise be impossible, like run-
ning an application that requires 300MB of RAM in just 128MB of actual 
physical RAM. However, here come the caveats:
✦Virtual memory is slow as molasses in December. Even today’s fastest
hard drive is many, many times slower than real silicon, so any use of
virtual memory instead of RAM slows down Mac OS X significantly.
✦Virtual memory abuses your hard drive. If you’ve ever run Photoshop
on a Windows PC with 64MB of RAM, you’re having flashbacks right 
now — whenever your Macintosh is using virtual memory, your hard
drive remains almost constantly active. (Hardware types like myself call
this phenomenon thrashing because we know what’s happening inside
that poor hard drive.) Over time, running any computer with insufficient
RAM and behemoth applications will result in a significant increase in
hard drive wear and tear.

✦Virtual memory costs you processing power. With sufficient RAM, 
Mac OS X gleefully runs as efficiently as it can — when virtual memory
kicks in, however, your Mac has to spend part of its quality time shut-
tling data to and from the hard drive, which robs your computer of 
processing power.
The moral of the story is very simple, so it’s time for another of Mark’s
Maxims:
The less that Mac OS X needs to use virtual memory, the better.™
To put it another way, physical memory (meaning memory modules) is
always a better choice than virtual memory. This is why power users and
techno-types crave as much system memory as possible.
A mere two years ago, 128MB of RAM was a quite comfortable figure for most
folks, but most of today’s Macs can accept at least a whopping 1GB (that’s
short for gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes) of system RAM. (At the extreme end
of the scale, the King Kahuna — Apple’s latest Power Mac G5 — can now
accommodate an unbelievable 8 gigabytes of RAM!)
If you’ll be keeping your current Macintosh for a few years more, install as
much memory as you can afford — you’ll thank me every time that Mac OS X
Tiger boots.
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
Before you click your mouse on some online computer store’s Buy button,
you need to determine two things that will help you determine which memory
module to buy: how much RAM you’ve already got and how much more your
system can handle.
Finding out the current memory in your Mac
Memory modules are made in standard sizes, so you need to determine how
much memory you already have and which of your memory slots are filled.
To do this, open an old friend you might have used in Mac OS 9, the Apple
System Profiler. Here, open System Profiler by clicking the Apple menu,
choosing About This Mac, and then clicking the More Info button.
After you launch this application, it takes a few seconds to scan your
Macintosh and display all sorts of identifying information about the hardware
and software that you’re using. Check out the Memory item in the Hardware
section. Here you can see exactly how many memory modules you have,
what type they are, and how much memory each provides. For example, in

Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
554
Figure 2-2, my iMac G5 has two memory slots — labeled DIMM0 and DIMM1.
One of those slots is filled with a 1GB module, and the other sports a 256MB
module, giving me a total physical memory of 1280MB. Jot down the name
and contents of each slot on a piece of paper — or, if you’re a real Mac OS X
power user, add a Stickie to your Desktop with this information. (Stickies are
covered in Book II, Chapter 2.)
However, on some machines, only one memory module can be upgraded by
a mere mortal. For example, on many older iMac G4 models, DIMM0 is an
internal module and can be upgraded only by an Apple technician. (Insert
sound of harps playing here.)
Unfortunately, this arrangement differs on just about every model of
Macintosh ever made — some have more memory slots, and others allow
you to upgrade all the system memory instead of just one module. The only
way to determine which modules are accessible on your Mac is to identify
the exact model of your computer.
Determining the exact model of your computer
Most folks know the type and model of their computers, but there’s a catch
here, too: Sometimes the memory that you need varies by the processor in
your Macintosh. For instance, many different versions of iMacs have been
made since the Bondi Blue Beast debuted, and over the course of those years,
Apple has made a slew of changes inside. Your eye should be on the actual
processor speed and bus speed — the transfer speed that data reaches whilst
speeding across your motherboard — because they’re the identifying factors
here. An older iMac with a 333 MHz G3 processor, for example, will use a dif-
ferent type of memory from the latest iMac with a 1.8GHz G5 processor.

Again, your salvation turns out to be Apple System Profiler. Just click the
Hardware section to display both the Machine Speed (or processor speed)
and the Bus Speed. (For example, my machine has a 1.8GHz G5 running at
600 MHz bus speed.) Grab that same piece of paper (or open that same
Stickie) and add these two figures to your list.
Now you’re armed with the information that you need to go online and buy
the right memory — or, if you’d rather work directly with a human being,
you can visit your local Apple dealer, present him with the list, and have him
order the memory upgrade for you.
Buying memory online is much cheaper. I recommend the following online
stores:
✦MacMall: www.macmall.com
✦MacWarehouse: www.cdw.com
✦MacConnection: www.macconnection.com
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Next, turn your attention to the other popular Mac upgrade — adding extra
hard drive space. With today’s cutting-edge, 3-D games using a gigabyte of
space each and Photoshop CS expanding to 500MB, IDC (short for Insidious
Data Creep) is a growing problem. (Bad pun most certainly intended.)
You can save space by deleting those files and folders you don’t need, but
what fun is that? To reduce your Mac’s waistline before you consider adding
more room, I recommend using Spring Cleaning from Allume Systems, which
you can find at www.allume.com. It’s a great tool for locating duplicates,
removing empty folders, and uninstalling old programs that you no longer use.
To determine how much free space remains on a hard drive, click the drive’s
icon on your Desktop and press Ô+I to display its information, as shown in
Figure 2-3. (I’m a major-league Mozart fan-boy, hence the name of my hard
drive.)
As a general rule, the following factors indicate that you’re ready to upgrade
your hard drive territory:
✦You have less than 2GB of space on your current hard drive.
✦You’ve cleaned off all unnecessary files, and your Mac is still lagging
behind in storage.
✦You need to share a large amount of data between computers that aren’t
on the same network. (Read on to discover why.)

Internal versus External Storage
556
Internal versus External Storage
Just about everyone who upgrades their existing hard drive does so because
they need extra space; however, you might also need to add a hard drive 
to your system that can go mobile whenever necessary. Unlike an internal
drive — which resides hidden inside your Mac’s case — an external drive is
a lean, mean, self-contained traveling storage machine that’s perfect for road
warriors.
External drives
External removable cartridge drives, such as a Zip drive, are fine for folks who
have to send cartridges to other locations. Unfortunately, however, the capaci-
ties of these drives are rapidly falling behind conventional, non-removable
external hard drives. Also, most Macs now have either a CD-RW or DVD-R
drive, which basically render Zip technology obsolete. Therefore, if you’re
considering an external unit, go with the most popular pick — a high-capacity
non-removable hard drive, which offers the most storage for your dollar.
Most external drives are shock-mounted (meaning that they can take more
abuse than an internal hard drive), and they carry their own power supply.
In fact, some external drives actually don’t need a separate power supply
because they draw their power through your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) or FireWire port. (The next chapter in this mini-book tells all about
USB and FireWire.)
Figure 2-3:

Internal versus External Storage
557
External drives also have a number of other advantages:
✦No installation hassle: You can easily install a USB or FireWire drive in
seconds. Simply plug in the drive to the proper connector on the side or
back of your Mac, connect the power supply (if necessary), and turn it
on. (No software installation necessary. As the folks in Cupertino are
fond of saying, “Look, Ma — no drivers!”)
✦No extra space needed: Many Macs simply don’t have the internal space
for another drive — laptops, iMacs, and the Mac Mini are good exam-
ples. Therefore, if you want to keep your existing internal drive as-is
while you’re adding more storage, an external drive is your only choice.
✦File sharing with ease: With an external drive, you can share your data
between multiple computers or bring your files with you on your next trip.
✦Safe from prying eyes: Unlike an internal drive, external drives are easy
to secure. Take your sensitive information home with you or lock it in a
safe.
After you plug in an external drive, Mac OS X displays it just like any other
hard drive volume. Figure 2-4 illustrates my 30GB FireWire drive in action.
Internal drives
Your other alternative is to upgrade your internal drive, which can be a hassle.
Like a memory upgrade, adding or swapping an internal drive involves opening
Figure 2-4:
A typical

Determining How Much Space You Need
558
your Mac’s case. In fact, it’s a somewhat more complex procedure than adding
memory.
I usually recommend that folks add a second drive rather than swap out
their existing drive. You’ll avoid the hassle of backing up and restoring your
system on a new drive or (even worse) reinstalling Mac OS X and then rein-
stalling all the applications that you use. (Swapping a hard drive should be
the definition of the word hassle.) Instead, add a second drive and leave your
current hard drive as-is.
However, here are a number of very important reasons why many Mac owners
choose updating internal drives, even with the hassle of swapping:
✦They’re cheaper. You’ll spend significantly less on an internal drive
because it doesn’t need the case and additional electronics required by
an external drive.
✦They’re faster. Even a FireWire or USB 2.0 drive isn’t as fast as an inter-
nal drive.
✦They take up less space in your work area. An internal drive elimi-
nates the space taken by an external drive, which can range any-
where from the size of a paperback to the size of a hardback book.
After you establish that you are in fact ready for more space — and you’ve
decided whether you want to add an internal drive, an external drive, or (if
you enjoy punishment) upgrade your existing internal drive — you’re ready
to consider how big of a drive you need.
Determining How Much Space You Need
Your next step is to decide just how much hard drive space is enough. I 
suppose that if your last name is Gates and you live in Redmond, you can
probably pick just about any drive on the market. However, I have a family, 
a mortgage, a car payment, and lust in my heart for the latest computer
games; therefore, I must be a little more selective.
I have two hard-and-fast rules that I follow when I’m determining the capac-
ity of a new drive:
1. If you’re buying a replacement for your existing drive, shop for a drive
with at least twice the capacity of the existing drive (if possible).
2. If you’re buying an external USB or FireWire drive, shop for a drive with
at least half the capacity of your existing internal drive (if possible).
Those rules seem to work pretty doggone well in most circumstances with
these two exceptions: gamers and digital video gurus. These folks need to
shoehorn as much space as they possibly can into their systems. If you’re a

Book VI

and Stir
Shopping for a Hard Drive
559
hardcore gamer or if you work primarily with digital video, you need a wheel-
barrow’s worth of hard drive capacity. Trust me: Buy the biggest hard drive
that you can afford.
Shopping for a Hard Drive
Ready to brave the local Wireless Shed superstore (or perhaps its Web site)?
Here’s a list of guidelines to keep handy while you’re shopping for a new
internal or external hard drive:
✦Faster is indeed better. You’ll pay more for a 10,000 revolutions per
minute (rpm) drive than a slower 5,400 or 7,200 rpm drive, but the extra
cash is worth it. Faster drives can transfer more data to your Mac in less
time — and that’s especially important for storing digital video.
✦Serial ATA and EIDE drives are different. If you’re replacing your inter-
nal drive, you have to get the same type of drive that you already have.
Again, System Profiler can tell you which type of drive your Mac is cur-
rently using.
✦Avoid used or refurbished drives. Hard drives are one of the few 
components in your computer that still have a large number of moving 
parts. Therefore, buying a used drive isn’t a good idea unless it’s priced
very low.
Because the prices on new hard drives are constantly dropping, make
sure that you check on the price for a new, faster drive of the same
capacity before you buy that bargain used drive.
✦Pick FireWire over USB 1.x every time. Compared with a FireWire con-
nection, a USB 1.x external hard drive is simply a joke when it comes to
performance. Because most Macs with USB ports also have FireWire
ports, make very sure that you buy a FireWire drive! (If your Mac has
USB 2.0 ports, which will show up in System Profiler as well, you can buy
a USB 2.0 drive without being embarrassed.)
✦Watch the size of the drive when buying internal drives. Most SATA
(short for Serial ATA) and EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics)
drives are standard half-height 3.5" units, but check to make sure that
you’re not investing in a laptop drive — unless, of course, you’re upgrad-
ing a laptop.
✦Do I need SCSI? In most cases, the answer is no — Macs built within the
last three or four years all use either EIDE or SATA drives. However, older
Macs do use Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) hardware, so make
sure that you check before you buy. (SCSI and EIDE are the two different
types of internal hard drive interfaces — a fancy word for connection —
used on Macs that can run Mac OS X.) Again, you can use the Apple

Installing Your New Stuff
560
System Profiler to determine what type of drives you have. Click the
Hardware category in the Contents column on the left and then click
both the ATA and SCSI subcategories to display the information for your
hard drives.
Installing Your New Stuff
After you get your memory modules or hard drive, pick from one of two
methods of installing them: easy and hard. Guess which method will cost
you money?
The easy way
Your Apple dealer can perform either type of hardware installation for you.
You can rest easy knowing that the job will be done right, but money will def-
initely change hands.
Personally, I always recommend that owners of iBooks and PowerBook lap-
tops allow their dealers to install memory upgrades and hard drives because
these laptops are much more complex than a desktop, and they’re much
easier to damage.
The hard way
If you’re familiar with the inside of your Macintosh, you can install your own
upgrade and save that cash. A memory upgrade is one of the simpler chores
to perform, but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels comfortable taking the
cover off and jumping inside a computer; hard drives are a tad more complex.
If you have a knowledgeable friend or family member who can help you
install your hardware, buy him the proverbial NSD (short for Nice Steak
Dinner) and enlist him in your cause. Even if you still do the work yourself,
it’s always better to have a second pair of experienced eyes watching, espe-
cially if you’re a little nervous.
Because the installation procedures for both memory modules and hard
drives are different for every model of Mac — heck, even removing the cover
on each model of Macintosh involves a different challenge — I can’t provide
you with any step-by-step procedures in this chapter. Many online stores
include installation instructions with their hardware. Other sources for
installation instructions include the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) or
your Apple dealer. You can use Sherlock (more about this in Book I, Chap-
ter 5) to scan the Internet for installation information for your particular
model. However, here are guidelines to follow during the installation:

Book VI
Chapter 2
Add RAM, Hard 
Drive Space, 
and Stir
Installing Your New Stuff
561
✦Watch out for static electricity. When opening your Macintosh and 
handling hardware, make certain that you’ve touched a metal surface
beforehand to discharge any static electricity on your body. (You can
also buy a static wrist strap that you can wear while working within the
bowels of your Mac.)
✦Check the notches on memory modules. Most types of memory mod-
ules have notches cut into the connector. These notches make sure that
you can install the module only one way, so make certain that they align
properly with the slot.
✦Make sure you’re using the right memory slot. As I mention earlier in
this chapter, most Macs have multiple memory slots, so check the label
on the circuit board to make sure that you’re adding the memory to the
correct slot. (Naturally, this won’t be a problem if you’re installing a
module into an unoccupied slot.)
✦Take good care of older hardware. If you replace an existing memory
module or hard drive with a new one, put the old hardware in the left-
over anti-static bag from your new hardware and immediately start
thinking of how you’ll word your eBay auction . . . Used 128MB Memory
Module for 333MHz iMac, for example.
✦Check your hard drive jumper settings. If your Mac uses EIDE hard
drives, you must set the Master and Slave jumpers correctly on the back
(or underside) of the new drive. A jumper is simply a tiny metal-and-
plastic connector that is used to change the configuration on a hard
drive. Setting jumpers indicates to your Mac which drive is the primary
drive and which is the secondary drive. (I don’t know how engineers 
got into the whole Master/Slave thing . . . they’re normally not quite so
exotic when naming things.)
If you’re adding a second drive to a G3 or G4 tower, you’ll probably have
to change the jumper settings on the original drive as well. (If you’re
replacing the existing drive, you’re in luck; simply duplicate the jumper
settings from the old drive and use them on the new drive.) Because the
configuration settings are different for each hard drive model, check the
drive’s documentation for the correct jumper position.
✦Leave the cover off while testing. After you install the upgrade, leave
the cover off your Mac while you boot the computer and test to see how
well you did. That way, if you have to replace the original hardware for
some reason, you won’t have to remove the cover a second time.
To determine whether a memory upgrade was successful, you can again 
turn to the Apple System Profiler. Open the Profiler again and compare the
memory overview specifications with the original list that you made earlier.
If the total amount of memory has increased and the memory module is rec-
ognized, you’ve done your job well. If not, switch off the Mac and check the
module to make sure it’s completely seated in the slot.

A
pple’s list of successes continues to grow over the years — hardware,
applications, and (of course) Mac OS X — but the FireWire standard
for connecting computers to all sorts of different devices is in a class by
itself. That’s because FireWire has been universally accepted all over the
world as the port of choice for all sorts of digital devices that need a high-
speed connection. Even Windows owners have grudgingly admitted that
FireWire just plain rocks. Ya gotta love it.
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of FireWire to the digital hub that I
discuss in Book III, and I compare it with both version 1.1 and version 2.0 of
Intel’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection technology. I also talk trou-
bleshooting and expansion using a hub.
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
So what’s so special about FireWire, anyway? Why does Apple stuff at least
one (and usually two) FireWire ports in all its current Macintosh models?
Heck, even the iPod (Apple’s MP3 player, which you can read more about in
Book III, Chapter 2) originally used only a FireWire connection. (Its official
name is IEEE 1394, but even the Cupertino crew doesn’t call it that — at
least very often.)
First things first. As countless racing fans will tell you, it’s all about the
speed, my friend. The original FireWire 400 port delivers a blazing fast 400
Mbps (megabits per second), which is fast enough for all sorts of peripher-
als to communicate with your Macintosh. The following list includes a
number of hardware toys that are well known for transferring prodigious file
sizes:

564
✦Digital video (DV) camcorders
✦High-resolution digital cameras
✦Scanners and some printers
✦External hard drives and CD/DVD recorders
✦Networking between computers
For example, consider the sheer size of a typical digital video clip captured
by one of today’s DV camcorders. DV buffs commonly transfer several hun-
dred megabytes of footage to their computers at one time. Check out the rel-
ative speeds of the different types of ports in Table 3-1, and you’ll see a big
attraction of FireWire.

Ouch! Not too hard to figure that one out. Here are three other important
benefits to FireWire:
✦Control over connection: This is a 10-cent term that engineers use,
meaning that you can control whatever gadget that you’ve connected
using FireWire from your computer. This is pretty neat when you think
about it; for example, you can control your DV camcorder from the com-
fort of your computer keyboard, just as if you were pressing the buttons
on the camcorder.
✦Hot-swapped: You don’t have to reboot your Mac or restart Mac OS X
every time that you plug (or unplug) a FireWire device. Instead, the
FireWire peripheral is automatically recognized (as long as the operating
system has the correct driver) and ready to transfer.
✦Power through the port: FireWire can provide power to a device
through the same wire — typically, there’s enough power available for
an external drive or recorder — so you don’t need an external AC power
cord for some FireWire devices. (Apologies to owners of DV camcorders,
but those things eat power like a pig eats slop.)

Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
565
However, FireWire isn’t finished evolving yet — the new, cleverly named IEEE
1394 B (called FireWire 800 by anyone with any sense, including the folks at
Apple) is designed to deliver a whopping 800 Mbps. That, dear reader, oughta
be fast enough for both you and your loved ones. These ports only appear on
the top-of-the-line Apple desktop and laptop models at the time of this writing,
but if you can afford the best, you’ll have to wear racing goggles to use ’em.
Oh, and as you would expect from Apple, the new ports will be backward-
compatible with older FireWire hardware. However, the ports aren’t exactly
the same, so you’ll need a plastic port converter to connect FireWire 400
devices to a FireWire 800 port. (Such important little conversion fixtures are
commonly called dongles. No, I’m not making that up. Ask your favorite
techno-nerd.)
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
The other resident port on today’s Apple computers is the ubiquitous USB,
which is short for Universal Serial Bus. (By the way, ubiquitous means ever-
present or universal, which I quickly looked up by using Sherlock — read all
about this super sleuth in Book I, Chapter 5.) Although version 1.1 of the USB
standard is nowhere near as fast as FireWire, USB has taken the world by
storm. It’s used for everything from mice to keyboards, speakers, digital
cameras, and even external drives and CD recorders. (A friend of mine never
misses the chance to point out that USB — which was originally developed
by Intel, the makers of the Pentium 4 processor — was given its first wide-
spread implementation on the original iMac. You’re welcome, Intel.)
Unfortunately, those last two are somewhat problematical: Technically, you
can add a USB 1.1 external hard drive, but don’t expect response times any-
where near what you’d enjoy with an internal hard drive. Ditto for a CD
recorder — 4X is about the limit for the recording speed with a USB 1.1 con-
nection. (Don’t even think about recording DVDs over a USB 1.1 connection.)
Now, compare this performance with that of similar equipment using a
FireWire connection, which provides nearly the speed of an internal hard
drive and CD and DVD recording at the fastest pace possible.
Like FireWire, USB connections are hot-swappable and provide power over
the connection. A USB port also offers a more limited version of Control over
Connection as well, making it a good choice for virtually all digital cameras.
The average 2- or 3-megapixel (MP) digital camera creates a JPEG image
that’s about 400–500K, so USB is the connection of choice for all but the 5MP
and 6MP (and higher) camera models. Why is it the connection of choice,
even though it’s slower than FireWire? Most PCs still don’t come standard
with FireWire ports, and transferring a 500K file doesn’t take that long over
USB. (On the other hand, try transferring a 20MB file from a 6MP camera,
and FireWire suddenly makes a lot of sense.)

Hey, You Need a Hub!
566
Not to be outdone, a new USB 2.0 specification arrived a couple of years ago
that delivers even better performance than the original FireWire standard —
USB 2.0 can transfer 480 Mbps. These ports are backward-compatible —
meaning they work with the original USB 1.x ports as well. (Don’t call Apple
a snob . . . at the time of this writing, all of the Mac models in Apple’s current
stable have USB 2.0 ports.)
If you have an expandable tower G3, G4, or G5 machine, you can use an
empty Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot to add USB 2.0 ports to
your Mac. For example, Orange Micro sells the OrangeUSB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI
card for about $50 (www.orangemicro.com); you can add a USB 2.0 port to
many older laptops by using a PC Card.
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Suppose that you’ve embraced FireWire and USB and you now have two
FireWire drives hanging off the rear end of your Mac — and suddenly you
buy an iPod. (Or you get another FireWire device that’s as much fun as an
iPod, if that’s actually possible.) Now you’re faced with too many devices for
too few ports. You could eject a drive and unhook it each time that you want
to connect your iPod, but there must be a more elegant way to connect. Help!
Enter the hub. Both the FireWire and USB specifications allow you to con-
nect a device called a hub, which is really nothing more than a glorified split-
ter adapter that provides you with additional ports. Note that this device
has nothing — repeat, absolutely nothing — to do with the network hubs that
I discuss in Book V. With a FireWire or USB hub at work, you do lose a port;
however, most hubs multiply that port into four or eight ports. Again, all this
is transparent, and you don’t need to hide anything up your sleeve. Adding a
hub is just as plug-and-play easy as adding a regular FireWire/USB device.
I should also mention that FireWire supports daisy-chaining — a word that
stretches all the way back to the days of the Atari and Commodore comput-
ers, when devices had extra ports in the back so that additional stuff could
be plugged in. However, not every FireWire drive has a daisy-chain port (also
called a passthru port). With daisy-chaining, you can theoretically add 63
FireWire devices to your Mac — talk about impressing them at your next
Mac user group meeting!
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Man, I hate it when FireWire and USB devices act like boat anchors. FireWire
and USB peripherals are so doggone simple that when something goes
wrong, it really aggravates you. Fortunately, I’ve been down those roads
many a time before, so in this section, I’ll unleash my experience. (That
sounds a little frightening, but it’s a good thing. Really.)

Common FireWire and USB headaches
Because FireWire and USB are so alike in so many ways, I can handle possi-
ble troubleshooting solutions for both types of hardware at once:
✦Problem: Every time I turn off or unplug my external peripheral, Mac OS
X gets irritated and displays a nasty message saying that I haven’t prop-
erly disconnected the device.
Solution: This happens because you haven’t ejected the peripheral. I
know that sounds a little strange for a device like an external hard drive
or a digital camera, but it’s essentially the same reasoning as ejecting a
CD or DVD from your Desktop. When you click your USB or FireWire
device and hold the mouse button down, you’ll see that the Trash icon
turns into an Eject icon; drag the device icon to the Eject icon and drop
it, and the external device disappears from your Desktop. (You can also
click the device icon to select it and press Ô+E.) At that point, you’re
safe to turn it off or unplug the FireWire/USB cable.
If Tiger recognizes the device as an external drive, which is usually the
case with a digital camera, external hard drive, or external CD/DVD
recorder, you can simply click the Eject button next to the device icon in
the Finder window’s sidebar.
✦Problem: The device doesn’t show a power light.
Solution: Check to make sure that the power cable is connected —
unless, of course, you’ve got a device that’s powered through the con-
nection itself. This can sometimes pose its own share of problems, how-
ever, when using USB devices. Not all USB ports provide power because
some are designed only for connecting mice, keyboards, and joysticks.
To check whether an unpowered USB port is your problem, either con-
nect the device to a USB port on the back of your Mac or connect it to a
hub or another computer. If the device works when it’s connected to
another port, you’ve found the culprit.
✦Problem: The device shows a power light but just doesn’t work.
Solution: This can be because of problems with your cable or your hub.
To check, borrow a friend’s cables and test to see whether the device
works. If you’re testing the hub, try connecting the device directly to
your Mac using the same cable to see whether it works without the hub.
If you’re attempting to connect a FireWire device through another
FireWire device, try connecting it directly to see whether it works. If so,
the middleman device either needs to be switched on to pass the data
through or it doesn’t support daisy-chaining at all — in which case,
you’ll have to connect both devices directly to your Macintosh.
✦Problem: Mac OS X reports that I have a missing driver.

Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
568
Solution: Check the manufacturer’s Web site and download a new copy
of the USB or FireWire drivers for your device because they’ve been cor-
rupted, overwritten, or erased entirely. Because Mac OS X loads the
driver for a USB or FireWire device when it’s connected, sometimes just
unplugging and reconnecting a peripheral will do the trick.
Check those drivers
Speaking of drivers . . . old and worn-out drivers are a sore spot with me.
Drivers are simply programs that tell Mac OS X how to communicate with
your external device. Each new version of Mac OS X contains updated driv-
ers, but make certain that you check for new updates on a regular basis.
That means using both the Software Update feature in Mac OS X (which I
cover in Book II, Chapter 3) and going to the Web sites provided by your USB
and FireWire hardware manufacturers.

 Setting up a shared printer
O
f all the improvements made in Mac OS X over Mac OS 9, one of the
most important is the simplified printing process — no Chooser, no
strange printer ports . . . just a heap of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and net-
work printing goodness. As I discuss in Book I, Chapter 3, if your USB printer
is recognized by Tiger, you can print within seconds of plugging it in, with
no muss or fuss. A USB printer is connected physically to your Mac, but you
can also send print jobs over the network to a network printer or even to a
wireless printer. (Unfortunately, if that network printer is in another room,
you do have to get up out of your comfortable chair to retrieve your printed
document . . . not even Tiger is that powerful.)
But what if you want to print to an AppleTalk printer or perhaps send docu-
ments to a printer over TCP/IP? (For more on AppleTalk, read Book V,
Chapter 3.) To take care of tasks like that, you need to dig a little further —
and I do so in this chapter. You also discover here how to use the features of
the Printer Setup Utility and how to juggle print jobs like a circus performer.
Meet the Printer Setup Utility
The Printer Setup Utility runs automatically whenever it’s needed by Tiger —
for example, when you print a document — but you can also run it at any time
from two other places:
✦The Print & Fax pane within System Preferences
✦The Utilities folder inside your Applications folder

Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
570
Although the Printer Setup Utility doesn’t look like much (as shown in
Figure 4-1), power lurks underneath.
If you find the Printer Setup Utility hard to reach and you need to manually
launch it often, add it to the Dock (as I show you in Book II, Chapter 2). That
way, you can launch it with a single click.
Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
Along the top of the Printer Setup Utility, you’ll find six default toolbar icons.
They are
✦Make Default: If you have more than one printer listed in the Printer
Setup Utility, you can select which printer Tiger will use by default.
Hint: The entry for the default printer appears in bold type. Click the
desired entry and then click the Make Default icon. (You can also use
the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.)
When you add a new printer to the list, it automatically becomes the
default printer. (Some folks like this feature; others would banish the
person responsible to Siberia for a decade.)
✦Add: In Book I, Chapter 3, you can read how to add a typical USB printer
(both with and without an installed driver). In the next section, I show
you how to add a non-USB printer.
“What if I add a printer by clicking the plus sign button on the Print &
Fax pane in System Preferences?” Ah, but it’s a trick question — System
Preferences simply launches the Printer Setup Utility! Hence my cover-
age of the utility first.
If your USB printer is already natively supported (has a preloaded driver
in Tiger), you might not need to go through the trouble of clicking the

Chapter 4
I’m Okay, You’re

Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
571
Add icon on the toolbar. Mac OS X can add a new USB printer automati-
cally, so don’t be surprised if your Mac swoops in and does it for you as
soon as you plug in a new printer. Also, the manufacturer’s installation
program for your printer might add the printer for you in a behind-the-
scenes way, even if Mac OS X lies dormant.
✦Delete: First click a printer in the list to select it and then click this icon
to remove a printer from your list of installed printers. This isn’t some-
thing that you’re likely to do often, but if a printer is no longer available,
it helps keep your list nice and tidy.
✦Utility: Clicking this icon displays the model-specific configuration set-
tings and features (if any) that are available for the selected printer. Of
course, these settings vary for every printer produced by the hand of
Man — they’re actually determined by the manufacturer’s printer driver —
but they usually include actions such as cleaning and alignment, and 
settings such as print quality.
✦ColorSync: Click this toolbar button to display the color matching con-
trols that are specific for your printer. Graphic artists and print media
professionals use color matching to make sure that a shade you picked
called Antique Rose also looks like Antique Rose on the printed version.
(Wouldn’t want Vamp Red instead, now would we?)
✦Show Info: From the Printer Setup Utility menu, click the Show Info tool-
bar button (or press the Ô+I keyboard shortcut) to display information
on the selected printer. You can change the printer name in this list, but
you have other options, too. Many Mac printers use the PostScript stan-
dard printing language; the dialog displays the PPD (Postscript Printer
Description) data files for the printer (the PPD field will be empty if the
printer doesn’t use PostScript) as well as any installable options, such
as a paper feed or scanning upgrade. Click the drop-down list box to dis-
play any installable options.
Here are two additional important features that don’t seem to rate their own
buttons on the Printer Setup Utility toolbar (but would doggone well be
there if I were running the show):
✦Preferences: Click the Printer Setup Utility menu and choose Preferences
to display the Print & Fax settings within System Preferences (see Figure
4-2). The choices that you make here affect the defaults in all the applica-
tions on your system — in this case, for my HP LaserJet printer. Choose
the Default Paper Size in Page Setup from the drop-down list for use with
all your printers. Click the Selected Printer in Print Dialog list box to pick
the default printer that will be used in all your applications. Click the
Print Queue button to display the printer queue window, where you can
monitor, pause, and stop active print jobs, or display completed jobs.
✦Show Jobs: Click Printers and click Show Jobs (or press Ô+O) to open
the very same printer queue window I just mentioned. Find more on this
later in the upcoming section “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”

Adding a Funky Printer
572
Adding a Funky Printer
“And what,” you might ask, “is a funky printer?” Well, you have a number of
possibilities, but they all add up to a non-USB connection:
✦An AppleTalk printer: If you’re sharing a printer on another Mac by
using AppleTalk (or if you have an older printer that supports AppleTalk),
you can print to that device. For more on AppleTalk, read Book V,
Chapter 3.
✦IP printing: Sending a job to an Internet Protocol (IP) printer actually
shoots the document across a network or Internet connection by using
a target IP address or domain name. Generally, it’s best to have a static
(unchanging) IP address for a network printer; if the IP address changes
often, for example, you’d have to reconfigure your connection to your IP
printer each time that it changed.
✦Bonjour: Shared printers on your local network use the built-in
Bonjour networking system, which means that they’re automatically 
recognized, and you needn’t enter any bothersome settings to reach
’em. (Go, Cupertino!)
✦Open Directory: This connection uses Mac OS X Directory Services to
share a printer. If your network uses Directory Services, your network
system administrator will have to set up mappings (essentially configu-
rations that point the way to a shared printer). Many network system
administrators favor Directory Services, which provide a much higher
level of security and make it easy to limit access to a printer by user ID
or location.

Chapter 4

Adding a Funky Printer
573
✦Windows printing: “Hey, I get to use the enemy’s printers, too?” That’s
right, as long as a Windows user on your network has shared his printer
(via the ubiquitous Windows File and Printer Sharing feature), you can
use it. Remember that HP printer of mine? It’s actually connected to my
PC server. Sweet.
✦Application printer drivers: Some printers aren’t actually physical devices
at all. For example, if you don’t want to use Tiger’s built-in faxing system,
you can print directly to a third-party fax program such as FAXstf X Pro
(www.smithmicro.com), which then dials, connects, and sends the 
document to a fax machine.
Although you can install Adobe Acrobat under Tiger, the operating system
provides built-in support for printing documents in Adobe’s PDF format
(which can then be viewed and printed on any other computer with the
Acrobat Reader, or added to your Web site for downloading). In fact, you
don’t even have to install a PDF print driver or display Printer Setup Utility!
To print a document as a file in PDF format, click the PDF drop-down button
in the application’s Print dialog, navigate to the desired folder and enter a
filename, and then click Save.
No matter which type of funky printer you add, it will need a driver installed in
the Printers folder, which resides inside your Library folder. (A driver is a soft-
ware program provided by the printer manufacturer that tells Mac OS X how to
communicate with your printer.) Also, if the printer is PostScript-compatible,
it will need a PPD file installed in your PPD folder, which also appears in the
Printers folder. Luckily, Tiger comes complete with a long list of drivers and
PPD files already installed and available — bravo, Apple dudes and dudettes!
To add a funky printer, follow these steps:
1. Launch the manufacturer’s installation application, which should copy
the driver and PPD files for you.
If you have to do things the hard way, manually copy the driver file into
the Library/Printers folder and then copy the PPD file (if required) into the
Library/Printers/PPD folder.
2. If you’re adding a physical printer — instead of an application printer
driver — verify that the printer is turned on and accessible.
If you’re printing to a shared printer connected to another Mac, that com-
puter has to be on. Luckily, most network printers (and their computer
hosts) remain on all the time.
3. Launch Printer Setup Utility and then click the Add icon on the toolbar.
Shared printers using Rendezvous network technology should show up
on this list, so you can click the printer to select it, and enter optional
name and location labels to help you identify the printer. Click the Print
Using drop-down list box and choose the printer model; then click Add.

Adding a Funky Printer
574
4. To add an IP printer, click the IP button on the browser toolbar.
Click the Protocol drop-down list box to choose the IP printing protocol
(typically either IPP or the manufacturer-specific socket protocol). If you
have a choice, it’s always a good idea to use the manufacturer-specific
socket. 
Click in the Address box and type the printer’s IP address or Domain
Name System (DNS) name, which should be provided by your network
administrator or the person running the print server. You can use the
default queue on the server — which I recommend — or select the Queue
check box and type a valid queue name for the server.
If you don’t know a valid queue name, you’re up a creek — hence, my
recommendation to use the default queue.
If you like, you can type a name and location for the remote printer —
this is purely for identification purposes. Finally, click the Print Using
drop-down list, choose the brand and model of the remote printer, and
then click Add.
5. To add an AppleTalk, Bluetooth, Windows Printing, or application
printer driver, click the More Printers button at the bottom of the
Printer Browser. Click the top drop-down list box to select the connec-
tion type.
The settings that appear depend on the connection type you choose. If you
don’t know the correct choice, huddle with your network administrator.
• AppleTalk: If you choose AppleTalk, click the second drop-down list
and choose the correct AppleTalk Zone. After a scan of the specified
Zone, Printer Setup Utility displays the list of printers that it can
access from that Zone.
• Bluetooth: Choose Bluetooth to display a list of Bluetooth printers
that your Mac can recognize. (Remember, Bluetooth devices have a
practical range of only 20–30 feet.)
• Windows Printing: If you choose Windows Printing, click the second
drop-down list and then click the correct Windows workgroup that
includes the printer(s) that you want to use. After a scan of the speci-
fied workgroup, Printer Setup Utility displays the list of printers that
it can access. (Don’t forget to thank His Billness later.)
• Application Name: If you choose an application name, like FAXstf X
Pro, the application’s driver will display its own settings. Set the 
configuration as necessary.
After everything is tuned correctly, click the Printer Model drop-down list
and choose the brand and model of the remote printer. Then click Add.

Managing Your Printing Jobs
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can also exercise some control over
the documents — or, in technoid, print jobs — that you send to your printer.
To display the jobs that are active (in line and preparing to print), use one of
these methods:
✦Click Printers on the Printer Setup Utility menu, click a printer in the list,
and choose Show Jobs.
✦Launch the Printer Setup Utility and press Ô+O.
✦Open the Print & Fax pane in System Preferences and click the Print
Queue button.
Where’s the chapter on faxing?
Good question, and here’s the answer: Tiger
handles faxing so seamlessly that you don’t
need a chapter’s worth of instruction! As long
as your Mac has either an internal or external
analog (dialup) modem connected to a phone
line, you’re a lean faxing machine.
To fax any open document within an active
application, just choose File➪Print or press
Ô+P. Click the PDF button at the bottom of the
Print dialog and click Fax PDF. Either type a
telephone number directly in the To field, or
click the suave-looking button with the profile
next to the field and choose a contact with a
telephone number from your Address Book.
Next, type a dialing prefix if one is necessary to
reach an outside line. (Usually, you won’t have
to select an external modem because virtually
all modern Macs have an internal modem.)
If you need a spiffy-looking cover page, select
the Cover Page check box. Click in the Comment
box directly below it and type whatever you
like. You can optionally type a subject as well.
When all is ready, you can either click the
Preview button to see the fax before you send it,
or throw caution utterly to the wind and click the
Fax button. The Printer Setup Utility treats a fax
just like any other printed document, so you can
cancel it or monitor its progress, as I discuss in
the section, “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”
Your Mac can also receive faxes. To enable this
feature, open System Preferences and click the
Print & Fax icon. On the Faxing tab, select the
Receive Faxes on This Computer check box.
Make sure that you type your fax number into the
My Fax Number field and then set the number
of rings Tiger should wait before answering the
call. You can save your incoming faxes as files
within a folder you specify, or e-mail the contents
automatically to any e-mail address you like.
(Perfect for vacations!) If you like, you can even
take the mundane route and print them on your
system printer.
If you’re going to use your Mac as a fax machine
often, I would definitely recommend enabling the
Show Fax Status in Menu Bar check box. That
way, you can monitor what’s happening as your
Mac sends and receives throughout the day.

Managing Your Printing Jobs
576
The actions that you can perform from the printer queue window (as shown
in Figure 4-3) are
✦Delete: When you click a print job in the list and then click the Delete
icon, the print job is removed from the queue. You might need to delete
a print job if you discover a mistake in the document while printing.
If the job is currently printing, several additional pages might be printed
before the job is finally cancelled. In other words, information already
sent to the printer might have to be printed before the cancel request
can be processed.
✦Hold: Click the Hold toolbar icon to pause printing of the current print
job. The status of the print job changes to Hold.
✦Resume: Click a print job in Hold status in the list and then click the
Resume icon to resume printing.
✦Stop Jobs: Click this icon to stop all printing to this printer. Note, how-
ever, that unlike using the Delete command, Stop Jobs doesn’t remove
any print jobs from the list. When jobs are stopped, the Stop Jobs icon
morphs into Start Jobs — click it to restart all jobs in the queue list.
This is a good feature to use when your printer is about to run out of
paper.
✦Utility: Click this icon to display any model-specific configuration settings
and features (if any) that are available for the printer assigned to the
selected queue.
✦Supply Levels: If your printer supports remote supply monitoring, you
can click this icon to display the current levels of ink and paper in your
printer. (Thus saving your feet from the wear and tear of walking.)

577
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Before we leave the Island of Big X Printing, I’d like to show you how to share a
printer with others on your local network, using Tiger’s super-easy Rendezvous
network sharing feature. (Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to connect
to other shared printers around you. Here, you’re going to share a printer
that’s connected directly to your Mac.)
If you decide to share your printers, don’t be surprised if Mac OS X seems to
slow down slightly from time to time. This is because of the processing time
necessary for your Mac to store queued documents from other computers.
The hard drive activity on your Mac is likely to significantly increase as well.
Once again, turn to the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences. (When it
comes to printing, Tiger gives you more than one way to skin a . . . well, you
get the idea, even without the bad pun.) To share a printer, click the Sharing
tab (as shown in Figure 4-4) and mark the Share These Printers with Other
Computers check box. Mark the check box next to each printer you want to
share. Voilà! You’re the guru!
“Hey, what about my firewall? And don’t I have to do anything on the Sharing
pane in System Preferences?” Perhaps you would if you were using that Other
Operating System — which shall remain nameless here — but you’re using
Tiger, and everything is set automatically for you the moment you click that
Figure 4-4:
Tiger takes
care of

Sharing a Printer across That There Network
578
check box! Tiger automatically opens the correct port in your firewall to allow
printer sharing, and even turns on printer sharing for you. (And yes, if you
decide not to share your printers and you disable the check box later, Tiger
cleans up after you. It disables Printer Sharing and closes the port in your
firewall on the Sharing pane in System Preferences.) Super-flippin’ sweet.
The printers that you specify are available to other computers within the
same IP subnet. In other words, someone in your local network is able to use
your printers, but no one outside your network has access.
If you haven’t already assigned a printer a descriptive name, launch the
Printer Setup Utility, select the printer in the list, and press Ô+I. This dis-
plays the Show Info dialog for that particular printer. With Name & Location
chosen from the drop-down list, simply enter the name of your printer in the
Printer Name text field. You can also identify that printer’s location in the
Location text field. For example, in an office environment, I like to add the
room number to a shared printer name (as well as the Location field).

n Chapter 1 of this mini-book, I present you with an overview of the most
popular hardware that you can add to your Mac — and where there’s
hardware, software can’t be far behind. (Somebody famous said that —
I think it was either Bill Gates or Dennis Miller. I consider both of them
famous comedians.)
Anyway, Mac OS X comes with a full suite of software tools right out of the
box. You get Internet connectivity, disk repair, basic image editing, digital
video editing, and — depending on the price that you paid or the Mac model
that you bought — even games and a complete set of productivity applica-
tions. However, if you’re willing to pay for additional features and a manual
(at least what passes for a manual in the manufacturer’s opinion), you can
make all these tasks easier and accomplish them in shorter time.
Read on for an overview to the most popular third-party software applica-
tions for Mac OS X: what everyone’s using, how much they cost, and why
they’re (usually) better. But before you drop a wad of cash on a fancy new
application, though, remember yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
If a program you already have does everything you really need, you
don’t have to upgrade. Honest and truly.™

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
Yes, I know I’ve been poking fun at His Gateness for much of this book — you
have to admit, he makes a pretty good target — but he did pull PC owners
out of the character-based world of DOS, and I’ll be the first to say that he
does get things right from time to time.
For example, I’ve always been more impressed with Microsoft Office than I
have been with Microsoft Windows. (At least Windows XP Professional is a
step in the right direction, but it still has a long way to go to match Mac OS X.)
Office has long been the productivity suite of choice in the Windows world,
and it’s also been a popular favorite in years past on the Macintosh side.
A lot of hard work was put into the latest version of Microsoft Office, and it
shows. Office 2004 was designed specifically for Mac OS X, using the rules that
Apple recommends for the Aqua user interface. As you can see in Figure 5-1,
it looks as much like a native Mac OS X application as AppleWorks 6, which
is Apple’s competing office productivity suite.

Applications That

Gotta Have
The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
581
However, like Mac OS X itself, Office 2004 isn’t just an attractive exterior.
Consider some of the advantages of Office 2004:
✦Perfect document compatibility with the Windows version of Office:
You can both read and write documents with transparent ease, no matter
which platform gets the file. Documents can be shared between platforms
on the same network.
✦Mirrored commands: Both the Windows XP and Mac OS X versions of
Office share virtually identical menu items, dialogs, and settings, thus
making Mac OS X instantly familiar to anyone who’s used Office on a
Windows PC.
✦Support for native Aqua features: This includes transparent graphics
within your documents, input and confirmation sheets, and palettes for
formatting.
✦Tons of templates, samples, and support files: Microsoft doesn’t scrimp
on ready-to-use documents and templates, as well as additional fonts,
clip art, and Web samples.
✦Entourage: Entourage (as shown in Figure 5-2) is the Macintosh counter-
part to Windows Outlook. It combines most of the same features that
you’ll find in the Apple Mail, iCal, and Address Book applications. (Read
about Apple Mail in Book IV, Chapter 2; read about the Address Book in
Book I, Chapter 6.) Use Entourage to participate in Internet newsgroups;
it also includes a Mailing List Manager to help you keep track of the
deluge of list messages that you receive every day.
What about AppleWorks?
If you’re already using AppleWorks, you might
have noticed that the Office applications provide
roughly the same features. (The drawing and
painting elements of AppleWorks are integrated
into the Office 2004 suite.) Therefore, you might
wonder whether you should scrap AppleWorks.
Remember my maxim — if the AppleWorks suite
that you’re familiar with is doing the job, I rec-
ommend that you keep it. After all, AppleWorks
is a powerful productivity suite on its own, capa-
ble of producing results that are easily as good
as Office 2004. Also, Apple does provide conver-
sion filters that can allow you to open and save
Office documents, so you’re not isolated from the
Office crowd. If you’re still using Mac OS 9 on one
or more of your Macs, I should also point out that
Office 2004 doesn’t run under Mac OS 9 — but
AppleWorks runs like clockwork on both Mac 
OS 9 and X. (Note that AppleWorks will eventu-
ally be phased out by Apple’s new iWork suite.)
On the other side of the coin, I would recom-
mend that you buy Office if
 You prefer the Office 2004 menu design and
features.
 You’d like to keep most of the same com-
mands replicated in the same places as the
Windows version of Office.
 You want to seamlessly share documents
with co-workers who use Windows Office
on your network or through e-mail.

Your Mac OS X ToolBox: Drive 10

Besides Entourage, Office 2004 includes three other applications:
✦Word: The word processing application that rules the planet
✦Excel: The leading spreadsheet application
✦PowerPoint: A favorite presentation development application
The Office 2004 for Mac Professional Edition suite costs about $500 at the
time of this writing. You might save a few dollars if you buy it online from a
Web store like Mac Warehouse (www.cdw.com).
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: Drive 10
My favorite native Mac OS X disk repair application is Drive 10 from
Micromat (www.micromat.com).
More than just about any other type of application, it’s important for a disk
maintenance program to be built “from the ground up” for Mac OS X. Never
attempt to repair a Mac OS X disk in Classic mode, nor should you try to use
an older repair utility that was written for use under Mac OS 9.

With Drive 10 (shown in Figure 5-3), you can thoroughly check a hard drive
for both physical errors (such as faulty electronics or a bad sector on the
disk surface) and logical errors (incorrect folder data and glitches in the file
structure). The Disk Utility that’s included with Mac OS X does a fine job of
checking the latter, but it doesn’t perform the physical testing — and Drive
10 does both.
I should note, however, that Drive 10 doesn’t take care of viruses. Pick up a
copy of VirusBarrier X (www.intego.com) to protect yourself against viral
attack.
Drive 10 also takes care of disk optimization, which is a feature that’s been
conspicuously absent from Mac OS X ever since the beginning. As I explain
earlier in Book I, Chapter 7, defragmenting your disk will result in better per-
formance and a faster system overall.
Drive 10, which will set you back about $70, comes on a self-booting CD-ROM
so you can easily fix your startup volume by booting your system from the
Drive 10 disc.
Image Editing for the Masses
The only one true King of the Retouching Hill in Mac OS X, Adobe Photoshop
(www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) has been the digital-image editing
favorite of Mac owners for many years now. Like Office 2004, the newest ver-
sion of Photoshop (CS) also takes full advantage of the Aqua standard (see
Figure 5-4).

You can find more three-pound Photoshop books on the shelf than politi-
cians in trouble, so it’s no surprise that I can’t provide you with a sweeping
list of its features in this section. However, here’s a summary of what you
can expect from Adobe’s crown jewel:
✦Superior editing: The most sophisticated image editing possible for a
digital photograph. If you can accomplish an image-editing task in soft-
ware, it’s very likely that Photoshop can do it. You can even combine and
splice parts of different images to produce a new work of art or perhaps
distort and liquefy an image to produce a new look.
✦Image retouching tools: These help you rescue images with problems
such as overexposure and color imbalance. (You can also use tools
like the new Healing brush to erase imperfections in the photograph’s
subject.)

The Morass of Digital Video
585
✦Plug-ins: Photoshop has been a standard for plug-in functionality since it
first appeared. If you need features that aren’t in the application out of the
box, you can add them through third-party plug-ins.
✦Web posting: Prepare images for use on the Web.
✦Painting tools: Use these gems to simulate different types of inks, paints,
and brushes on different types of media.
Although Photoshop is a hefty $650 for the full package, Adobe has also cre-
ated a kid brother, Photoshop Elements, that sells for a mere $90. Designed
for the novice or intermediate level photographer, Elements has most of the
functionality of the full package that you’re likely to need. Elements also pro-
vides a number of very helpful wizards to help automate the most common
image-editing tasks, as well as one of the most comprehensive Help systems
that I’ve ever used.
The Morass of Digital Video
Two types of applications make up the DV market: digital video editing (in
which you create a movie) and DVD mastering (in which you take that movie
and create a DVD movie). You can find a number of great applications on the
market in both of these categories, all at different price points and different
levels of complexity. They include
✦iMovie HD: I cover this easy-to-use video editing iApp in Book III,
Chapter 4. A good choice for any novice, it’s usually bundled for free
with today’s new Mac models, and you get it as part of the iLife suite.
You might also receive it with Mac OS X.
✦iDVD: This is the DVD mastering counterpart to iMovie. Although it’s a
snap to use, it doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features. (Book III, Chapter
5 explains iDVD 5 in detail.) Again, you’ll receive it free with your Mac if
you bought a model with a SuperDrive.
✦DVD Studio Pro: Apple’s entry into the ranks of DVD mastering can 
produce a commercial-quality DVD movie disc, but don’t expect any
hand-holding or assistants with this application. This is a serious tool
for professionals, and it’ll set you back $500. With DVD Studio Pro 3
(www.apple.com/dvdstudiopro), you can add interactive, animated
menus, subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and Web interactivity to your
DVD projects.
✦Final Cut Pro HD: At $1,000, you’d assume Final Cut Pro (www.apple.
com/finalcutpro) to be the best DV editing package on the market for
Mac OS X . . . and you won’t get any argument from me. It offers real-time
playback with RT Extreme HD — no waiting for rendering, like you have
to within iMovie — and high definition support over a FireWire connec-
tion. Sassy.

Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Time to turn your attention to a subject near and dear to my heart: record-
ing data CDs, audio CDs, and DVDs on the Macintosh (which I cover in detail
in another of my For Dummies books, CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley). Of course, Mac OS X can burn basic data CDs that you can
share with your Windows and UNIX friends without any add-on software. If
you have a Mac equipped with a SuperDrive, you can also create standard,
cross-platform data DVDs, too. But what if you need an exotic format, like CD
Extra, where data and digital audio tracks can co-exist peacefully on one disc?
Or perhaps you need a self-booting disc?
There’s one clear choice: When you’re ready to seriously burn, you’re ready
for Roxio Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com), the CD and DVD recording choice
for millions of Mac owners. (No snickering about the name, please.) Figure 5-5
illustrates this powerhouse of an application, which is an elegant design that’s
both simple to use and perfectly Aqua. Files, folders, and digital audio tracks
that you want to record are simply dropped into the application window.
As for exotic formats, here’s a list of what types of discs that you can record
with Toast:
✦Standard data CDs and DVDs
✦Standard audio CDs
✦Video CDs
✦MP3 discs (which store MP3 audio tracks)
✦Discs recorded from an image file
✦Mac volumes
✦Hybrid PC/Mac discs
✦ISO 9660 discs
✦Multisession discs
✦CD Extra discs
Toast works with both internal and external CD and DVD recorders, taking
advantage of the latest features on today’s drives — in particular, burn-proof
recording, which can practically eliminate recording errors. You can also
copy existing discs, using one or multiple drives.
Toast is quite affordable at $90. You can buy it directly from the Roxio online
store at www.roxio.com.

If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
Here’s where Mac power users usually start grinning from ear to ear like
Santa’s elves on the day after Christmas, because — get this — the great
Unwashed Windows Horde actually thinks that you can’t run Windows XP on
a Macintosh! Can you believe that? Obviously, they haven’t heard of Virtual
PC 7 from Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/mac), which without a doubt is
one of the coolest applications ever written for the Mac.
No, my friend, your eyes are not deceiving you — you are indeed looking at
Windows 2000 running on my iMac G5 in Figure 5-6. Virtual PC 7 (which
requires Mac OS X) provides a near-perfect PC environment for any version
of Windows from 95 all the way up to XP; literally, Windows has no idea that
it’s not running on a typical piece of PC iron.
Virtual PC simulates everything necessary for you to get the full functionality
out of Windows. For example, this jewel automatically (and transparently)
handles your Windows Internet connection, network tasks, and CD and DVD
access. Heck, it even allows you to use your single-button mouse as a two-
button PC mouse (by holding down the Control key while you click). You can
run full-screen or run Windows in a window. (Pun joyfully intended.)
If that weren’t enough, you can also run multiple operating systems. So, if
you need Linux or Windows 2000 along with your XP system, no problem —
all it takes is the install disc for those operating systems and the hard drive
space to hold ’em. Just plain sassy.
Figure 5-5:
Toast is the

Naturally, performance is an issue — and, to be honest, Virtual PC isn’t for
the PC gamer, even with the newest Macs and their super-duper GeForce and
Radeon video cards. Because today’s PC games push an actual PC to the
limit, they just run too sluggishly on a Mac emulating a PC — they do run,
just too slowly. (Also, virtually all of today’s blockbuster PC games are also
being ported to Mac OS X, so why not just run the Mac version?)
However, when it comes to just about any other type of application, Virtual
PC running on a late-model G5 Mac can deliver performance equal to a
Pentium 4 PC. The more memory that your Mac has, the more you can give
your virtual PC, so it also pays to have 512MB or more of RAM. (And natu-
rally, a dual-processor Mac runs Virtual PC much faster.) I use Virtual PC
with niche Windows programs that have never appeared on the Mac as well
as native Mac versions of all other applications. Again, you don’t need to use
Mac to run the Windows version of Photoshop CS because Photoshop CS is
also available for the Mac.
If you’re tired of the undeserved taunts from your clueless Windows friends,
run — don’t walk — to your browser and order a copy of Virtual PC 7. The

program comes prepackaged with fully licensed copies of several different
flavors of Windows and Linux. For example, the version with XP Home costs
around $200 — or you can buy a version without an operating system for
about $120 and supply your own copy of Windows.
All Hail FileMaker Pro
If databases are the name of your game, you’ve already been using FileMaker
Pro for years (on both Mac and Windows, more than likely). For the uninitiated,
FileMaker Pro (www.filemakerpro.com) is the premier database creation,
editing, and maintenance application for Mac OS X. It comes with dozens of
ready-made database templates for business, home, and education use, or
you can construct your own database in surprisingly short order.
Right out of the box, FileMaker Pro 7 can create
✦Business databases and forms for inventory, personnel, purchase
orders, and product catalogs
✦Home databases for budgeting, recipes, music CDs, DVD movies, family
medical records, and event planning
✦Education databases for student records, expense reports, field trip
planning, book and multimedia libraries, and class scheduling
FileMaker Pro 7 can add images and multimedia to your database, and you
can quickly and easily publish your databases on your Web site by using one
of the built-in theme designs. (In fact, visitors to your Web site can update
your database online, if you like.) FileMaker Pro can also allow multiple users
to share data across your network, no matter whether they’re running the
Mac or Windows version.
At $299, FileMaker Pro 7 is one of the least expensive — and most powerful —
applications that you can buy for the Big X. For a comprehensive yet easy-to-
read book on FileMaker Pro 7, check out FileMaker Pro 7 Bible by Steven A.
Schwartz and Dennis R. Cohen (Wiley).

StuffIt
In the Windows world, the Zip archive is the king of archiving formats. An
archive contains one or more compressed files that you can uncompress
whenever you need them. Folks store files in archives to save space on their
hard drives; archiving is also a neat way to package an entire folder’s worth
of files in a single convenient file, which you can attach to an e-mail message
or send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
On Planet Macintosh, the archiving format of choice is StuffIt. Manage your
archives with StuffIt Deluxe, from Allume Systems (www.allume.com), as
shown in Figure 5-7. StuffIt Deluxe can both archive and unarchive .sit files
(the common name for StuffIt archives) as well as Zip archives from your
Windows friends. You can also encrypt the contents of a StuffIt archive for
those “sensitive” transfers. The application runs $80 at the Allume Systems
online Web store.
QuicKeys X
QuicKeys X, from CE Software (www.cesoft.com), is another example of
someone’s thinking properly. This time, the idea is to automate repetitive
tasks by allowing Mac OS X to memorize what you do. Think of QuicKeys X
as a system-wide, macro playback application. Unlike AppleScript, however,
QuicKeys X works within any application and can play back mouse movement
and clicks/double-clicks. (And unlike Automator, which is new in Tiger, you
can perform any action that you could normally perform within an applica-
tion by typing.)

I’ve used QuicKeys X for a number of different tasks, including
✦Typing a commonly used block of text (like my address) into applica-
tions that don’t support macros
✦Launching applications at specific times and dates
✦Operating menus within programs to automate complex tasks
✦Launching Classic or choosing a specific startup disk with a single key
sequence
QuicKeys X sells for $100 on the CE Software Web site.
BBEdit
Although we all know and love Mac OS X as a graphical operating system,
folks still need a powerful text editor for creating and modifying text files.
For example, software developers and Webmasters still use text editors daily
to write applications or apply a quick fix to the HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) that makes up a Web page. (I use a text editor to make minor changes
to my Web site, MLC Books Online, without firing up a horrendous Web design
application. Talk about overkill!)
At first, you might think of TextEdit, which is the free application that ships
with Mac OS X. It’s not a bad editor, either, with features that are very similar
to Notepad in the Windows environment. However, serious text and code
editing requires a more powerful tool, and the text editor of choice for Mac
owners is universally considered to be BBEdit, from Bare Bones Software
(www.barebones.com). Figure 5-8 shows a document open within BBEdit 8.
Bare Bones Software pulls no punches in describing BBEdit — its advertising
still proclaims, “It doesn’t suck.” Gotta give Bare Bones credit; this incredibly
popular editor includes features like
✦Support for DOS/Windows, Mac, and UNIX text files: Yes, differences
do exist between the platforms, even with a so-called pure text file.
✦Works with text files up to 2GB in size: Try that with TextEdit. Hmm . . .
on second thought, please don’t.
✦HTML tools for Web design: These tools include syntax checking and
browser preview.
✦grep pattern-based, multifile search and replace: In non-programmer/
non-UNIX English, that means a very sophisticated search-and-replace
function that can span more than one text file.
✦Syntax coloring: Use this to help you quickly locate commands and
qualifiers in programming languages.
✦Built-in FTP transfer commands: No need to launch a separate FTP
application: You can send your files right from within BBEdit.

592
You can even expand the functionality of BBEdit with plug-ins, many of which
are free extensions written by programmers and developers specifically for
languages like C/C++, Java/JavaScript, Perl, and Pascal.
BBEdit 8 is available from the Bare Bones Software site for $199.
REALbasic
The final application that I want to mention really isn’t a utility as such; how-
ever, you can use it to write your own software, so I guess that it should qualify.
As an ex-COBOL programmer, reluctant Visual Basic shareware developer, and
recalcitrant dBASE coder, I can tell you that REALbasic (from REAL Software)
is definitely the easiest visual drag-and-drop programming environment that
I’ve ever used. If you want to develop your own productivity applications, 
Mac OS X utilities, or — dare I say it? your own game! — award-winning
REALbasic is the way to go.
Development in REALbasic is as simple as designing the application window
by first simply adding controls, text, and multimedia wherever you like. Then
just fill in the blanks, like setting variables and specifying what happens when
Figure 5-8:

Book VI

the controls are triggered, by using a new implementation of the tried-and-
true BASIC language. Of course, some programming knowledge is required
but far less than you’d need with Visual Basic. And the results look as good as
anything you can accomplish in those so-called real programming languages.
Check out these features:
✦Cross-platform support so that you can write your program once and
compile it for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Code it once; then release
three versions with no extra work — this is a very superb thing.
✦Support for all sorts of multimedia, including QuickTime.
✦Ability to animate and rotate text and objects, or tap the 3-D power of
QuickDraw3D and OpenGL graphics.
✦Capability to allow printing, network, and Internet communications
within your application.
✦Automation of Microsoft Office applications and connection of your
REALbasic application to business databases (like FileMaker Pro 7).
✦Completely royalty-free applications, so you can give them away or
release them as shareware.
REALbasic has been such a popular development tool on the Macintosh that
dozens of user-supported Web sites and mailing lists have sprung up, offer-
ing all sorts of REALbasic plug-ins, tutorials, and sample code for you to use
in your own projects.
I would be seriously remiss if I didn’t mention the bestselling REALbasic For
Dummies, written by Erick Tejkowski (Wiley). I’ve practically worn out my
copy, and it never leaves my desk. If you’re looking for a complete tutorial on
writing your own applications in REALbasic, I give REALbasic For Dummies
my highest recommendation!
REALbasic 5.5 comes in two versions — the Standard Edition ($149.95) and
the Professional Edition ($449.95). You can order either version from the
REAL Software site at www.realsoftware.com.
At Least One Game
To be completely accurate, Mac OS X already comes with at least one game —
a very good version of chess, which I cover in the next section — but the
Macintosh has never been considered a true gaming platform by most com-
puter owners. Until recently, many popular Windows games were never ported
(or converted) for the Mac, and only the most expensive Mac models had
the one important component that determines the quality of today’s games:
a first-rate, 3-D video card.

At Least One Game
594
However, within the last two years or so, all that has changed dramatically.
All of today’s Mac models feature muscle-car-quality video cards that use
the NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon chipsets; they can handle the most com-
plex 3-D graphics with ease. Match that with the renewed popularity of the
Macintosh as a home computer and the performance of the current crop of
G4 and G5 processors, and — wham! Suddenly you’ve got the best game devel-
opers in the business — id Software (www.idsoftware.com) and Blizzard
(www.blizzard.com), to name two — releasing Macintosh versions of their
newest games concurrently with the Windows version.
For the gamer in you, allow me to take you on a tour of the best of the new
generation of entertainment.
Mac OS X Chess
No mercenaries, no rail guns, and no cities to raze — but chess is still the
world’s most popular game, and Mac OS X even includes a little 3-D as well.
Figure 5-9 illustrates the Chess application at play; you’ll find it in your
Applications folder.
The game features speech recognition, move hints, take back (or undo) for
your last move, and a 2-D or 3-D board. You can also list your games in text
form and print them or save games in progress. Maybe it’s not a complete
set of bells and whistles like commercial chess games, but the price is right,
and the play can be quite challenging when you set it at the higher skill levels.
Nanosaur 2
It’s not hard to understand why Apple has bundled this 3-D dinosaur adven-
ture game with many of the latest Macintosh models: The graphics are
simply out of this world! You have complete three-dimensional freedom,
flying a pterodactyl throughout the skies of prehistoric times in search of
stolen dinosaur eggs. There’s a series of two-player levels as well.
You’ll encounter evil in many forms: automated defenses, other dinosaurs,
and far worse. There are a wide range of power-ups and weapons in this 3-D
shooter. Enemies are smart and hard to beat, and the immersive audio envi-
ronment is incredible when experienced through a good set of headphones
or a speaker system equipped with a subwoofer. (Read about beefing up
your sound system in Book VI, Chapter 1.)
Graphics are literally the best you can get on the Mac, using all the tricks
offered by those GeForce and Radeon cards. Optional graphics features that
will make any Windows gamer nervous include
✦Highest-quality, 32-bit textures
✦Resolutions up to 1280 x 800 widescreen
✦Support for 3-D glasses (both the old-style paper kind and today’s latest
electronic LCD shutter glasses)

Note: This game comes with a new Mac, not with Tiger.
WarCraft III
To finish my survey of must-have games, I’ll end with Blizzard’s best:
WarCraft III. This heady mixture of RTS (short for real-time strategy) and
RPG (short for role-playing game) is yet another sequel in another popular
game series. WarCraft III puts you in the boots of human princes, Orc battle
generals, undead champions, and elfin lords — in fact, in single player mode,
you’ll play each of these warrior races in turn. My recommendation: Stick
with the Night Elves, my friend.
Combat, however, is only half of the job. Each mission is different; typically,
you also have to gather resources by mining gold and cutting trees while you
build new structures and train new troops. You can take to the air, buy goods
from mercenaries, or even hire goblins to do your dirty work (if you have the

gold handy). Spells abound, as do siege weapons and mounted warriors.
(Personally, my favorite units have to be the living guardian trees of the
Night Elves, which toss boulders. I want one of those — a friendly one, mind
you — in my backyard.)
Although visually stunning, WarCraft III is no first-person game. Instead, you
view the action from an overhead perspective, as you can see in Figure 5-10.
Control is by both keyboard and mouse; the game is easy to learn, but you’ll
always find someone to kick your posterior in multiplayer games, both over
the Internet and across your own local area network (LAN).
You’ll find the storyline in this game riveting — it keeps you playing with its
twists and turns. Your units include heroes, which are no static figureheads.
As they gain experience, you can teach them new skills and outfit them with
all sorts of magical items.
You’ll pay about $30 online for WarCraft III, and it’ll be worth every single
penny you spend. (This is a program you’d buy on your own; it does not
come with your Mac or with Tiger.) For all the details and some great desk-
top backgrounds, check the official site at www.blizzard.com/war3. (Oh,
and don’t forget: After you complete the original WarCraft III, you can con-
tinue the adventure with the Frozen Throne expansion pack, which sells for
around $20 online.)

Lurks Beneath
In This Chapter
 Why use UNIX?
 Doing things with the keyboard
 Introducing UNIX commands
 Creating text files
 Exploring deep inside Mac OS X
A
s I mention in the first chapter of the book — at the beginning of our
Tiger odyssey — UNIX lurks deep beneath the shiny Aqua exterior of
Mac OS X. UNIX is a tried-and-true operating system that has been around
for decades, since the days when mainframe computers were king. If you
don’t believe that it’s a powerful (and popular) operating system, consider
that over half of all Web servers on the Internet use some variety of UNIX as
their operating system of choice.
Besides being battle-tested and having a long history, UNIX also offers some
fantastic features. Unlike the graphical world of Mac OS X, the keyboard
plays an integral role while you’re using a UNIX-based operating system.
Because UNIX is text-based, you’ll find that it has evolved a large set of
useful keyboard-driven commands that can perform powerful feats that a
mouse user just can’t easily equal. This chapter examines the role of the
keyboard in UNIX operating systems and describes how to execute standard
file system commands. You also discover how to use Apple’s additional set
of commands and install your own commands (and simple programs) from
the Internet.
Why Use the Keyboard?
To begin benefiting from the UNIX underpinnings of Mac OS X, get used to
doing things with the keyboard. Although mouse skills can be applied to
UNIX, you’ll generally find performing UNIX functions faster and easier with
the keyboard.

Why Use the Keyboard?
600
UNIX keyboarding is fast
Why on Earth would any red-blooded Macintosh owner want to leave the
comfort of the mouse to use a keyboard? After all, the graphical user inter-
face is what made the Macintosh great in the first place. With the Finder, you
can navigate and manage the various files on your hard drive with a few clicks.
This sounds simple enough, but for some tasks, using the keyboard can be
just as fast, if not faster.
Suppose, for example, that you need to copy a file from somewhere on your
hard drive to somewhere else on that same drive. To do so with the Finder,
you must first open a Finder window (by clicking the Finder icon on the
Dock, or by double-clicking a drive icon on your Desktop). Then, by using a
succession of mouse clicks, you navigate to where the file that you wish to
copy resides. Next, you might open another Finder window and navigate to
the folder where you wish to copy the file. (Note that opening the second
Finder window requires pressing Ô+N; clicking the Finder icon on the Dock
does not open a second Finder window.) Finally, you duplicate the original
file and drag that copy to its intended destination.
Comparatively, by using the keyboard and the power of UNIX, you can
accomplish the same task with a one-line command. For some tasks, the
mouse is definitely the way to go, but you can perform some tasks just as
quickly, if not faster, with the keyboard. For the skinny on one-line com-
mands, skip down to the upcoming section, “Uncovering the Terminal.”
The UNIX keyboard is a powerful beast
So maybe you’re not an expert typist, and using the mouse still sounds invit-
ing. For many scenarios, you’d be correct in assuming that a mouse can
handle the job just as quickly and easily as a bunch of commands that you
have to memorize. Using the keyboard, however, offers some other distinct
advantages over the mouse. To allow you to control your computer from the
keyboard, all UNIX operating systems offer the command line tool. With this
tool, you can enter commands one line at a time: hence, its name. Mac OS X
ships with the command line application, Terminal. You can find it here:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
One shining feature of the command line is its efficiency. To wit: When you
use a mouse, one mouse click is equal to one command. When you use the
command line, on the other hand, you aren’t limited to entering one command
at a time; rather, you can combine commands into a kind of super-command
(minus the silly cape, but with bulging muscles intact), with each command
performing some action of the combined whole. By using the command line,
you can string together a whole bunch of commands to do a very complex task.

Why Use the Keyboard?
601
For example, consider how many times you’d have to click a mouse in the
Finder to do the following:
1. Find all files that begin with the letters MyDocument.
2. From this list of files, add a number to the beginning of the filename,
indicating its size in kilobytes.
3. Save the names of all altered files to a text file.
By using the command line, you could accomplish all these tasks by typing
only one super-command: that is, a collection of three simple commands
combined to form one instruction. The built-in Terminal program that ships
with Mac OS X Tiger gives you everything that you need to start using the
command line. I show you how in the section “Uncovering the Terminal,”
later in this chapter.
Delving farther into super-commands is not for the faint-hearted; things get
pretty ugly pretty quickly, and this chapter can only show you the very
beginning of the UNIX Yellow Brick Road. Therefore, if your thirst for UNIX
dominance so compels you, I invite you to do a little independent study to
bone up on the operating system. Pick up a copy of the great book of lore
entitled UNIX For Dummies, 5th Edition, written by John R. Levine and
Margaret Levine Young (Wiley).
Go where no mouse has gone before
The Finder is generally a helpful thing, but it makes many assumptions about
how you work. One of these assumptions is that you don’t have any need to
handle some of the files on your hard drive. As I mention in Book II, Chapter 6,
Mac OS X ships with its system files marked Off Limits, and I generally agree
with that policy (which keeps anyone from screwing up the delicate innards
of Mac OS X). To secure your system files, Apple purposely hides some files
from view.
But what road do you take if you actually need to view or modify those
system files? Yep, you guessed it: The command line comes to the rescue!
You can use the command line to peer inside every nook and cranny of your
Mac’s vast directory structure on your hard drive. It also has the power to
edit files that aren’t normally accessible to you. With the command line, you
can pretend to be other users — even users with more permissions. By tem-
porarily acting as another more powerful user, you can perform actions with
the command line that would be impossible in the Finder. (Just remember to
make sure that you know exactly what you’re doing, or you’re working with
an Apple technical support person — a wrong move, and it’ll be time for an
Ominous Chord.)

Automate to elevate
If all these benefits are beginning to excite you, hold on to your socks! Not only
can you perform complex commands with the command line, you can go even
one step further: automation. If you find yourself using the same set of com-
mands more than once, you’re a likely candidate for using automation to save
time. Instead of typing the list of commands each time, you can save them to a
text file and execute the entire file with only one command. Now that’s power!
Of course, you probably don’t like doing housekeeping tasks while you’re
busy on other things, so schedule that list of commands to run in the middle
of the night while you’re fast asleep. The command line lets you do that, too.
Note that automation of UNIX commands is totally separate from automation
of Mac OS X applications with AppleScript and Automator, which I cover in
Book VII, Chapter 2.
Remote control
“So, Mark, the command line is the cat’s meow for efficiently accessing and
working with files on my Mac, and I can use it to automate many operations.
Anything else?” I’m glad you asked! By using the command line, you can also
send commands to another computer anywhere in the world (as long as you
know the right login and password). After you log into another computer,
you can use the same commands for the remote computer.
UNIX was created with multiple users in mind. Because computers used to
be expensive (and honking huge machines to boot), UNIX was designed so
that multiple users could remotely use the same machine simultaneously. In
fact, if Mac OS X is your first encounter with UNIX, you might be surprised to
know that many UNIX beginners of the past weren’t even in the same room,
building, state, or even country as the computer that they were using.
Not only can you work with a computer that’s in a different physical loca-
tion, but it’s also very fast to do so. Instead of the bandwidth hog that is the
Internet, the command line is lean and mean. This permits you to use a
remote computer nearly as fast as if it were sitting on the desk in front of
you. (This is a great advantage for road warriors who need to tweak a Web,
an e-mail, or an FTP server from a continent away.)
Uncovering the Terminal
The best way to learn how to use command line is to jump right in. Mac OS X
comes stocked with an application named Terminal. The Terminal applica-
tion is where you enter commands in the command line. It is located in the
Utilities folder within the Applications folder on your hard drive — choose
Applications➪Utilities.

Double-click the icon shown in Figure 1-1 to launch Terminal.
By the way, feel free to make Terminal more accessible by dragging its icon
to the Dock or the toolbar. That way, you won’t have to dive this deep into
the Applications folder in the future.
What’s a prompt?
Upon launch of the Terminal application, you’ll immediately notice some
text in the window that appears onscreen.
Last login: Sun Jun 23 17:51:14 on console
Welcome to Darwin!
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$
As you might guess, this text details the last time that you logged into the
Terminal, followed by a greeting from the Darwin underbelly of Mac OS X.
(As I mention in Chapter 1 of Book I, Darwin is Apple’s name for the UNIX
underpinnings of Mac OS X.) The last line, however, is the most important
one. It’s called the prompt.
The prompt serves some important functions. First, it lists the current direc-
tory, which is listed as ~. A tilde character (~) denotes a user’s Home directory.
By default, you will always be in your Home folder each time that you begin
a new session on the Terminal. After the current directory, the Terminal dis-
plays the name of the current user, which is markchambers in this example.
The final character of the prompt is a $. Consider this your cue because
immediately after this character is where you enter any command that you
wish to execute. Go ahead; don’t be shy. Try out your first command by typing
uptime in the Terminal application. (It’s a good idea to type UNIX commands
in lowercase.) Your text appears at the location of the cursor, denoted by a
small square. If you make a mistake while entering the command, press the
Delete key to back up and then type the characters again. (If the typing error

Utilities
folder.

Uncovering the Terminal
604
is stuck deep in a longer command, press the left- or right-arrow key to move
the cursor immediately after the incorrect character and press Delete to
back up; then type the correct characters.) After you type the command,
press Return to execute it.
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$ uptime
6:24PM  up  2:42, 4 users, load averages: 2.44, 2.38, 1.90
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$ 
If all goes well, you should see a listing of how long your Mac has been running
since the last reboot or login. In the example listing, the computer has been
running for 2 hours and 42 minutes (2:42 in line 2). Simple, eh? Immediately
following the listing of the uptime command, the Terminal displays another
prompt for you to enter more commands. I examine many more commands
later in this chapter.
A few commands to get started
Using the command line is simply a matter of entering simple instructions —
or commands — into the Terminal application and pressing Return to execute
them. It’s easy to use the command line to navigate through the various folders
on your hard drive. You’ll become accustomed to using two vital commands:
ls and cd. The ls command is shorthand for list, and it does just that: It lists
the contents of the current directory. Enter ls at your prompt, and you should
see a listing of your Home folder as shown in Figure 1-2.
The complementary cd command (lowercase) — which incidentally stands
for change directory — opens any folder that you specify. It works much the
same as double-clicking a folder in the Finder: The difference is that follow-
ing the cd command, you don’t immediately see all of the folder’s content.
Figure 1-2:

ing the ls

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Uncovering the Terminal
605
However, the cd command requires a parameter (extra options or informa-
tion that appear after the command) so that your Mac knows which folder
to open.
For example, to open the Documents folder that resides in your Home direc-
tory, type cd Documents and press Return. When you do, you might be 
surprised to see another prompt immediately displayed. So where are all
the files in the Documents folder? You must enter another command to see
what items are in the folder that you just opened. Type ls again to see the
contents of the Documents folder, as shown in Figure 1-3.
If you try to open a folder that has a space in its name, make sure to enclose
the folder’s name in quotes, like this:
cd “My Picture Folder”
Read more about using quotes in your commands in the upcoming section,
“Command line gotchas.”
To return to your Home folder, enter a modified version of the cd command:
cd ..
This causes your Mac to move back up the folder hierarchy one folder to
your Home directory. By using these three simple commands — ls, cd
foldername, and cd .. — you can traverse your entire hard drive.
After you successfully enter a command, you can recall it by pressing the 
up-arrow key. Press the up-arrow key again to see the command prior to that,
and so forth. This is an extremely useful trick for retyping extra long file paths.

command

Using the skills you already have
Just because the Terminal is text-based doesn’t mean that it doesn’t act like a
good Macintosh citizen. All the usual Mac features that you know and love are
there for you to use. Copy and Paste functions work as you might expect —
but only at the prompt position.
Drag-and-drop is also at your disposal. After you play around with the Terminal
for a while, you’ll find yourself bored to tears typing the long paths that rep-
resent the files on your hard drive. To automatically enter the path of a file
or folder to a command, simply drag it to the active Terminal window, as
shown in Figure 1-4. The file’s full path instantly appears at the location of
your cursor. (Thanks, Apple!)
You can even use the mouse while entering commands in the Terminal. Click
and drag your mouse over text to select it. From there, you can copy to the
Clipboard as you might expect with any other application.
UNIX Commands 101
To use the command line effectively, you need to familiarize yourself with
the commands that are available to you. After all, how can you use a tool
without knowing what it can do? Despite having to memorize a few com-
mands, UNIX usually makes it easy on you by abbreviating commands, by
following a standard grammar (so to speak), and by providing you with
extensive documentation for each command.

UNIX Commands 101
607
Anatomy of a UNIX command
UNIX commands can perform many amazing feats. Despite their vast abili-
ties, all commands follow a similar structure:
command <optional flag(s)> <optional operand(s)>
The simplest form of a UNIX command is the command itself. (For a basic
discussion on UNIX commands such as ls, see the earlier section, “A few
commands to get started.”) You can expand your use of the ls command by
appending various flags, which are settings that enable or disable optional
features for the command. Flags are preceded by a dash (-) and always
follow the command. For instance, you can display the contents of a direc-
tory as a column of names by tacking on an -l flag to the ls command.
ls –l
Besides flags, UNIX commands sometimes also have operands. An operand is
something that is acted upon. For example, instead of just entering the ls
command, which lists the current directory, you can add an operand to list a
specific directory:
ls ~/Documents/myProject/
The tilde (~) denotes the user’s Home directory.
Sometimes a command can take multiple operands, as is the case when you
copy a file. The two operands represent the source file and the destination of
the file that you want to copy, separated by a space. The following example
copies a text file from the Documents folder to the Desktop folder by using
the cp command (short for copy).
cp ~/Documents/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
You can also combine flags and operands in the same command. This exam-
ple displays the contents of a specific folder in list format:
ls –l ~/Documents/myProject/
Command line gotchas
In earlier sections, I describe a few simple command line functions. All these
commands have something in common: You might not have noticed, but
every example thus far involved folder names and filenames that contained
only alphanumeric characters. Remember what happens if you have a folder
name that has a space in it? Try the following example, but don’t worry when
it won’t work.

UNIX Commands 101
608
The cd command stands for change directory.
cd /Desktop Folder
The result is an error message:
-bash: cd: /Desktop: No such file or directory
The problem is that a space character is not allowed in a path. To get around
this problem, simply enclose the path in double quotation marks, like this:
cd “/Desktop Folder”
Mac OS X lets you use either double or single quotation marks to enclose a
path with spaces in it. Standard UNIX operating systems, however, use double
quotation marks for this purpose.
In a similar vein, you can get the space character to be accepted by a com-
mand by adding an escape character. To escape a character, add a backslash
(\) immediately prior to the character in question. To illustrate, try the last
command with an escape character instead. Note that this time, no quotation
marks are necessary.
cd /Desktop\ Folder
You can use either quotes or escape characters because they’re 
interchangeable.
Help is on the way!
By now, you might be wondering how a computer techno-wizard is supposed
to keep all these commands straight. Fortunately, you can find generous docu-
mentation for nearly every command available to you. To access this built-in
help, use the man command. Using the man command (shorthand for manual)
will display a help file for any command that it knows about. For example, to
read the available help information for the ls command, simply type man ls
at the prompt. Figure 1-5 illustrates the result.
Autocompletion
To speed things along, the bash shell can auto-magically complete your
input for you while you type. Although the Terminal permits you to enter
commands via the keyboard, it is the shell that interprets those commands.
Many kinds of shells are available to UNIX users. The shell that Tiger uses

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Working with Files
609
by default is named bash — another common shell is named tcsh. Use the
autocompletion features of bash to autocomplete both commands and file-
names. To demonstrate, begin by typing the following:
cd ~/De
Then press the Tab key. This result is that the shell predicts that you will
want to type
cd ~/Desktop/
Of course, if you have another folder that begins with the letters De in the
same folder, you might need to type a few additional characters. This gives the
autocompletion feature more information to help it decide which characters
you want to type. In other words, if you don’t type enough characters, auto-
completion ends up like a detective without enough clues to figure things out.
Working with Files
If you’ve used a computer for any time at all, you’re no doubt familiar with
the idea of files. Even before the first floppy drive appeared in personal com-
puters, operating systems have stored data in files . . . they date back to the
days when a mainframe computer occupied an entire floor of an office building.
Mac OS X is no exception, and it’s important to understand how Mac OS X
arranges them into folders and how you go about accessing them via the
command line. This section describes the basic file and folder information
that you need to know to tame the beast that is UNIX.
Figure 1-5:
Use the man
command to

information.

Working with Files
610
Paths
Before you dive into UNIX commands, you should first know a few facts . . .
nasty things, facts, but you can’t earn your pair of techno-wizard suspenders
without ’em. For starters, as a Mac user, you might not be familiar with how
paths work in UNIX. A path is simply a textual representation of a folder or
file. The simplest path is your Home directory, which is denoted by a tilde
character (~) — the tilde character acts as the equivalent of /Users/<your
short account name> (in my case, /Users/markchambers). Any folder
within the Home directory is represented by the folder’s name preceded by
a forward slash (/). For example, a document entitled myDoc that resides in
the current user’s Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myDoc
Similarly, a folder named myFolder that resides in the current user’s
Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myFolder/
As you’ve probably surmised, a folder and a directory are two different names
for the same thing. Folder is the name with which most Mac users are familiar,
and directory is a term that UNIX power users prefer. I use the terms inter-
changeably throughout the remainder of the chapter.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, you might sometimes want
to work with folders or files somewhere other than in your Home folder.
Starting from your Home folder, enter the following command:
cd ..
This will move you to the folder right above your Home folder, which hap-
pens to be the Users folder. Using another quick ls command will show you
all users who are permitted to use the machine, as shown in Figure 1-6. In
this figure, you can see the three users that are allowed to use this machine:
markchambers, baberuth, and fuadramses. (By the way, Shared isn’t a user —
it’s a folder with privileges set so that any user can access its contents.)
Enter cd .. once again, and you find yourself at the root of your main hard
drive. The root directory is what you see in the Finder when you double-click
your hard drive icon on the desktop. A user’s Home directory is represented
by a tilde character (~), and the root of the hard drive is denoted by a forward
slash (/), as displayed by the prompt:
[WHITEDRAGON:/] markchambers$

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Working with Files
611
It’s easy to return to your Home directory by following this sequence:
[WHITEDRAGON:/] markchambers$ cd Users
[WHITEDRAGON:/Users] markchambers$ cd markchambers
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$
Here’s a faster way. Instead of moving through each successive folder until
you reach your intended destination, you can specify the path by using just
one cd command:
[WHITEDRAGON:/] markchambers$ cd /Users/markchambers
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$
Of course, the Home directory is a special folder in that you can also navi-
gate there by simply entering cd ~, but the main point here is that you can
navigate directly to specific folders by using that folder’s path in conjunction
with the cd command.
Furthermore, when you navigate your hard drive by using paths, you can
jump directly to your desired destination from any place. When you enter
cd .., it is in relation to your current position, whereas entering
cd /Users/markchambers
will always take you to the same directory, regardless of your starting point.
Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
After you’re comfortable with moving around the hierarchy of your hard
drive, it’s a cinch to copy, move, and rename files and folders.
Figure 1-6:
The Users

Working with Files
612
To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. Because using
the cp command will copy a file from one place to another, it requires two
operands: first the source, and then the destination. For instance, to copy a
file from your Home folder to your Documents folder, use the cp command
like this:
cp ~/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
Keep in mind that when you copy files, you must have proper permissions
to do so. Here’s what happens when I try to copy a file from my Desktop to
another user’s Desktop:
[WHITEDRAGON:~] markchambers$ cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument/Users/fuadramses/
Desktop/MyDocument 
Denied! Thwarted! Refused!
cp: /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument: Permission denied
If you can’t copy to the destination that you desire, you will need to precede
the cp command with sudo. Using the sudo command allows you to perform
functions as another user. The idea here is that the other user whom you’re
“emulating” has the necessary privileges to execute the desired copy opera-
tion. When you execute the command, the command line will ask you for a
password. If you don’t know what the password is, you probably shouldn’t be
using sudo. Your computer’s administrator should have given you an appro-
priate password to use. After you enter the correct password, the command
executes as desired.
In case you’re curious, sudo stands for set user and do. It sets the user
to the one that you specify and performs the command that follows the 
username.
sudo cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument
Password:
A close cousin to the cp (copy) command is the mv (move) command. As you
can probably guess, the mv command moves a folder or file from one loca-
tion to another. (I told you that all this character-based stuff would start to
make sense, didn’t I?) To demonstrate, this command moves MyDocument
from the Desktop folder to the current user’s Home folder:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/MyDocument

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Working with Files
613
Ah, but here’s the hidden surprise: The mv command also functions as a
rename command. For instance, to rename a file MyDocument on the Desktop
to MyNewDocument, do this:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
In this case, you can see that the mv command is really copying the original
file to the destination and then deleting the original. Because both folders in
this example reside in the same folder (~/Desktop/), it appears as though
the mv command has renamed the file.
Again, like the cp command, the mv command requires that you have proper
permissions for the action that you wish to perform. Use the sudo command
to perform any commands that your current user (as displayed in the prompt)
is not allowed to execute. On UNIX systems, not all users are necessarily
equal. Some users can perform functions that others can’t. This is handy for
keeping your child’s mitts out of important files on your computer. It also
creates a hurdle should you choose to work on files while using your child’s
restricted user account. The sudo command lets you temporarily become
another user — presumably one that has permission to perform some func-
tion that the current user can’t.
What would file manipulation be without the ability to delete files? Never fear;
UNIX can delete anything that you throw at it. Use the rm (short for remove)
or rmdir (short for remove directory) command to delete a folder or file. For
example, to delete MyNewDocument from the Desktop folder, execute the rm
command like this:
rm ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
Once again, deleting files and folders requires that you have permission to
do so. In other words, any time that you manipulate files with the command
line, you are required to have the proper permission. If your current user
lacks these permissions, using sudo will help.
Opening documents and launching applications
Launching applications and opening documents is child’s play for a UNIX pro
like you. The open command does it all. For example, to bring the Finder to
the foreground without touching the mouse, use
open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app

Useful Commands
614
To open a document from the command line, follow a similar scheme. For
example, to view an image named myImage.tif that’s stored in your
Documents folder using Preview, try this:
open ~/Documents/myImage.tif
Useful Commands
Manipulating files and viewing folder content is fun, but the command line is
capable of so much more! Now I focus your attention on some of the other
useful tasks that you can perform with the command line.
Mac OS X comes stocked with a full set of useful commands. You can dis-
cover what commands are installed by viewing the files in /usr/bin. Type
cd /usr/bin to navigate there.
Calendar
One of my favorite command line functions is the cal command, which dis-
plays a calendar in text form. Simply entering cal at the prompt displays a
calendar for the current month, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Append a number to the cal command to display a 12-month calendar for
that year. The number that follows the cal command is the year for which
you’d like to see a calendar. For example, to view a calendar for 1970, type
cal 1970. The result appears in Figure 1-8.

Processes
Have you ever been curious as to why your hard drive seems to spin and grind
on occasion while your system is seemingly inactive? Mac OS X sometimes
has a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. To discover just what your
computer is busy doing at any time, use the top command to display all the
actions that your computer is currently performing, as shown in Figure 1-10.
These activities are called processes; some are created when you launch
applications, and others are simply tasks that Mac OS X has to take care of
to keep things running smoothly.
Besides listing the names of the various processes currently in use, top also
tells you how much of your CPU is being devoted to each process. This lets
you know what process is currently hogging all your computing power.
Figure 1-10:
The top

displays all

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks

UNIX Cadillac Commands
617
Sometimes a process stalls, effectively freezing that action. By using the top
command to find the Process ID (PID) of the offending process, you can halt
the process. Simply use the kill command followed by the PID of the process
that you want to stop.
Do not go killing processes with a cavalier attitude! Although Mac OS X is
extremely stable, removing the wrong process — such as init or mach_
init — is rather like removing a leg from one of those deep-sea drilling plat-
forms: the very definition of Not Good. You could lock up your system and
lose whatever you’re doing in other applications. If you simply want to shut
down a misbehaving program, go graphical again (at least for a moment) and
use the Force Quit menu command from the Finder menu.
Like top, another handy command for examining process info is ps (short
for process). Most often, you will want to append a few flags to the ps com-
mand to get the information that you desire. For example, try the following
command:
ps –aux
The man page for ps explains what each flag means. (Read more about using
the man command in the earlier section, “Help is on the way!”)
UNIX Cadillac Commands
Besides working with files and processes, the command line has all kinds of
sophisticated commands. For example, with the command line, you have
instant access to a variety of tools for finding files or even stringing together
commands.
Finding files
The command line also gives you a number of ways to search for files on your
hard drive. The two most commonly used commands are find and locate.
To use find, specify a starting point for the search followed by the name of
the file or folder that you wish to find. For example, to find the Fonts folder
that belongs to your user, enter the command like this:
find ~/ -name “Fonts”
You should see at least one result of the find command.
/Users/markchambers//Library/Fonts

UNIX Programs That Come In Handy
618
One great feature of the find command is that you can look for a file or
folder in more than one location. Suppose you want to find a file named
MyDocument that you know resides either in your Documents folder or on
your Desktop. For this kind of search, use the find command like this:
find ~/Documents ~/Desktop\ Folder -name “MyDocument”
In this example, you are telling the find command which folders it should
search when looking for the file named MyDocument.
Using pipes
Nearly all UNIX commands can take on greater abilities by using a construct
called the pipe. A pipe (|) is represented by that funny little vertical line that
shows up when you press Shift+\. The pipe routes data from one command
to another one that follows — for example, many UNIX commands produce
large amounts of information that can’t all fit on one page. (You might have
noticed this behavior when you used the locate command.) Joining two
commands or functions together with the pipe command is piping. To tame
the screens full of text, pipe the find function to the less command. The
less command provides data one page at a time.
find ~/ -name “Fonts” | less
When the results fill up one page, the data stops and waits for you to press
any key (except the Q key) to continue. When you reach the end of the results,
press Q to quit and return to a command line prompt.
UNIX Programs That Come In Handy
As a Macintosh user, you might be surprised to know that many applications
on your hard drive don’t reside in one of the typical Applications folders of
Mac OS X. These applications, in fact, don’t have any graphical user inter-
face like you’re accustomed to. They’re only accessible from the command
line. The remainder of this chapter covers some of these applications.
Text editors
UNIX has many text-editing applications for use at the command line. Some
of the more popular ones include pico, vi, and emacs. Each of these text
editors has its pros and cons — and thanks to the thorough folks at Apple,
because all three are included with Tiger! For my examples here, however,
I use pico because it’s simple to use and sufficient for our needs.

Creating a new document
To create a text file by using pico, simply type pico at the command line.
The result should look like Figure 1-11.
This is the rough and tumble world of UNIX, which preceded the Macintosh by
many years. Perhaps this will also help you to appreciate why the Macintosh
was so revolutionary when it was introduced. (You can just hear the designers
crowing, “We’ll call this a menu! Yeah, that’s the ticket!” The only graphics
that you’d see on your monitor were the comics and sticky notes that you
stuck to the bottom.)
At the bottom of the screen is a menu of common commands. Above the
menu is a large empty space where you can enter text, much like the word
processors that you already know and love. (For those of us that remember
the halcyon character-based days of DOS, think older versions of Word and
WordPerfect . . . or, if you’re a real computing dinosaur like I am, consider
the original WordStar.) Type some text in that area. Anything will do . . . a
letter to a friend, a grocery list, or your school homework.
When you’re finished entering your desired text, save the document with 
the WriteOut command in the pico menu. Directly next to each command
in the pico menu is a keyboard sequence used to perform that command.
(Refer to the bottom of Figure 1-11.) The ^ character is shorthand for the
Control key on your keyboard. Thus, to save a file, press Control+O. This
flies in the face of standard Mac keyboard conventions, where the letter O
is traditionally used to mean Open.
Figure 1-11:
The pico
program is a
full-strength
text editor,

the com-
mand line.

620
After pressing the Control+O sequence, pico prompts you for a filename
(see Figure 1-12). Like most UNIX files, you’re permitted to enter a simple
filename here or a full path to a file. For this example, save the file to your
Documents folder, naming it MyPicoDocument.
After you’ve completed and saved the document, pressing Control+X will
transport you away from Planet Pico and back to the command line.
Networking with the Terminal
Because UNIX isn’t a new phenomenon, it has many useful networking abili-
ties built into it. In fact, UNIX was instrumental in creating much of what we
now take for granted: e-mail, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Thus,
you will be happy to know that you can communicate over networks with the
Terminal in practically any manner that you can dream of . . . and then some!
WWW and FTP
If you’ve used the Internet for any time, you’re probably familiar with the vari-
ous means to transport data over a network. From FTP (short for File Transfer
Protocol) and Telnet to e-mail and the Web, UNIX can handle it all. In fact, UNIX
has a command for each of these functions (and many more that have passed
into historical obscurity). Rather than use each individual command to send
and retrieve data with the Terminal, Apple has conveniently provided a com-
mand that can handle them all: curl. The curl command is competent at
all the standard network protocols. To see it in action, pass a Web address
(or URL, to The Enlightened) to the curl command:
curl http://www.mlcbooks.com
Figure 1-12:
When you
save your

you for a

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
UNIX Programs That Come In Handy
621
The result is that you will see the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page
that’s located at www.mlcbooks.com. Because this isn’t particularly useful
for most people (it’s not very easy to read), you need to add the letter o as a
flag. This specifies where you would like to save this file upon download. To
save the HTML page to your Home directory, add the -o flag and a path to
the destination file.
Don’t forget to precede all flags with a hyphen. For this example, it would
be -o.
curl -o ~/mlcbooks.html http://www.mlcbooks.com
If you now perform an ls command, you will see that curl has, in fact,
downloaded the HTML found at www.mlcbooks.com and saved it to a file
named mlcbooks.html in your Home directory.
The beauty of curl is that it does much more than just retrieve Web pages:
It’s equally comfortable with FTP transfers. FTP is used to download (or
receive) files from a server as well as upload (or send) them. Like the previ-
ous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) examples, you only have to provide
an FTP address in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format, and curl will
take care of the rest. Of course, most people want to save any files that they
download via FTP — not view them in the Terminal like I did the HTML file.
Therefore, like the previous example, you should add the -o flag and a path
to the destination of your download. This time, I download a README file
about curl directly from the makers of curl.
curl -o ~/Desktop/README.curl
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/utilities/curl/README.curl
If you’re familiar with FTP, you might be wondering whether curl can upload,
too. Yes, indeed! Instead of using the -o flag, you will need to use two flags: -T
and -u. The -T flag denotes which file you wish to upload. The -u flag denotes
the username and password. Then, specify the FTP destination address of
where you want to upload it. Because this example deals with an upload, the
remainder of this example is for an imaginary FTP server. In real life, you’d
use the appropriate FTP address, username, and password for an FTP server
where you are allowed to upload.
curl -T /Desktop/README.curl -u username:passwd ftp://ftp.yoursitehere.com
/myfiles/README.curl
This example uploads the README.curl file from the Desktop folder that I
downloaded earlier to an imaginary FTP server.

622
How do you spell success? C-u-r-l!
Sure, HTTP and FTP are handy, but did you know that there are many
other protocols for network communications? One of the niftier ones is
the Dictionary protocol. With it, you can look up words from any server that
understands the protocol. Suppose, for example, that you would like to know
the meaning of the term CD-ROM. Enter the following command to find out:
curl dict://dict.org/d:CD-ROM
The results are shown in Figure 1-13. With curl, Sherlock and your Dictionary
Dashboard widget on the same Macintosh, you might never use a “real”
paper dictionary again!

U
sing a Macintosh is supposed to make your life easier — and in many
ways, it does. But there’s a limit to how much your Mac can do by
itself, right? After all, you still have to move the mouse, press keys on the
keyboard, and read information on the screen to get things done . . . or do
you? Why not let your computer do the dull chores — such as renaming a
thousand digital photographs from your family vacation and organizing them
into folders based on the subject of each photo — for you? Although most
people are familiar with controlling their Macs with the mouse and keyboard,
few realize that they can operate their machines without touching a key, a
mouse button, or even glancing at the screen.
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
If one word could describe what AppleScript is all about, it would be automa-
tion. AppleScript is a technology for automating practically any action that you
perform with your Macintosh, including both common tasks in the Finder and
those that you perform in other applications.
Automate common tasks in the Finder
If you’ve ever found yourself repeating some task more than once, you’re
an ideal candidate for becoming an AppleScript techno-wizard. AppleScript
is particularly good at taking the boredom and tedium out of using your

Macintosh by performing all sorts of tasks automatically. To illustrate, 
consider a few jobs that would take a fair amount of time to do by hand but
are a snap with AppleScript:
✦While writing your next best-selling Great American Novel — or For
Dummies book on Mac OS X — you make a mistake and misnumber the
chapters. All the chapters have a filename bearing the chapter number,
but they’re all off by one. Sure, you could rename each file by hand, but
your book is a large tome and renumbering 42 chapters manually doesn’t
sound like much fun. (Take my word for it. Please.) It’ll require several
minutes and lots of tedious attention on your part, not to mention intro-
duce the likelihood of human error. But wait, there’s another way! When
using a simple AppleScript of only a few lines of code, you can rename
the chapters in seconds whilst you go grab another Diet Coke.
✦You’re a neat individual and think that your Mac should reflect your pen-
chant for order — in fact, you like your Desktop icons to be placed just
so. Being left-handed, you prefer the icons over on the left side of the
Desktop, like some of those inferior operating systems. In this situation,
an AppleScript can help you do things that aren’t humanly possible; not
only can you rapidly rearrange the icons on your Desktop, but you can
do so with pixel-point accuracy. Without AppleScript, it would be nearly
impossible to precisely align dozens of icons. And if you could, it would
take a long time and probably cause you to go blind.
✦After a font-download binge, you find yourself with hundreds of fonts.
You really want to organize them into separate folders based on the date
that you downloaded them. AppleScript comes to the rescue again! With a
brief script, you could knock out this challenge without ever looking at a
single date. Add a couple more lines of code to the script, and AppleScript
will take care of creating the folders, too. Right, you know the word: sassy.
Automate tasks in other applications
By using AppleScript, you can also often automate your work from beginning
to end, despite the fact that you need multiple applications to do so. Look at
a few scenarios, and you’ll begin to appreciate why AppleScript is such a
powerful technology:
✦You’ve just completed creating the ultimate library of bagpipe songs in
iTunes — no, really! — and you want to share the list with your friends
at the next Bagpipers Anonymous meeting. You could easily send every-
one in the group an iTunes Playlist, but not everyone in the club has a
Macintosh, let alone a computer. This is going to require creating a hard

Book VII
Chapter 2

copy for those members without a computer. Because your bagpipe song
list contains thousands of songs, you don’t want to retype the name of
each song. AppleScript can save the day by extracting the song titles for
you and compiling them into a list just in time for your meeting.
✦AppleScript can take care of your computer-owning bagpipe friends, too.
With a few extra steps, you can e-mail all of them the list as well.
✦Being so doggone fond of bagpipes, you want to send your bagpiping
friends a special note during the holidays. To help manage your holiday
greeting cards, you can create a record in FileMaker Pro or some other
database listing the name and address of each person who should receive
a card. If you’ve entered their street addresses in the Contacts section of
your e-mail application, AppleScript can aid in transferring the addresses
from your e-mail application to the database. Never again will your bag-
piping friends miss a holiday greeting . . . and the world is a much better
place.
As you can imagine, there are literally thousands of ways that you can use
AppleScript to automate your workflow.
Running a Script
The easiest way to get started with AppleScript is to use some scripts that
others have already written. Scripts are small files that contain a list of com-
mands; this list of commands tells your Mac what function to perform and
when to perform it. Fortunately, Apple is kind enough to provide you with
several completed scripts with your installation of Tiger. You can find a large
cache of scripts in the scripts folder, found in the Library folder, under Scripts.
Many scripts (but not all) end with the extension .scpt. Before you get
started running scripts, however, you should know a few things first.
Identifying scripts in the field
Each script that you encounter will be in one of these three formats:
✦Script application: Some AppleScripts act much like an application. To
use one, simply double-click it in the Finder, and off it goes to perform
whatever tasks it was meant to do. Depending on an internal setting of
the script, it might quit when it’s finished doing its thing. Most often, the
script completes its mission and quits. Scripts are typically identified by
the icon that you see in Figure 2-1.

Running a Script
626
✦Compiled script: You might also encounter AppleScripts that won’t
run without the aid of another application. Apple calls these compiled
scripts. Although they’re not able to execute on their own, they do have
the abilities of a script built in. They just require a host application to
use them.
✦Text file: In addition to compiled scripts and those that act like applica-
tions, a third category of AppleScript that you might encounter is a script
stored in a text file. Scripts that are stored in a text file also need a host
application before they’ll do anything. The main difference between a
text file script and a compiled script is that you can read a text file script
with any application that can open a text file.
The Script Editor application
Two of the three possible script types (compiled scripts and text files) require
some sort of host application before they’ll perform any action. Luckily, Tiger
provides you with just such a host: the AppleScript Script Editor application,
which comes with Mac OS X and can execute any AppleScript with ease.
With the Script Editor, you can also do much more, including

Executing a script
After you have the Script Editor application running, you can run any
AppleScript that can you find. To get you started, Apple has conveniently
provided a handful of useful scripts. Navigate to the Scripts folder, which is
located in the Library folder.
The scripts are divided into folders based on functionality, such as fonts,
mail, color, and navigation. For example, open the Internet Services folder,
where you’ll find a script named Current Temperature by Zipcode.scpt.
You need an active Internet connection to test this script.
Double-click the script to open it. Because it’s a compiled script and not an
application script, the Script Editor automatically loads the script and comes
to the foreground (see Figure 2-3). This particular script prompts users for
their ZIP code and then displays the current temperature, which it retrieves
from a Web site. To see the script in action, click the Run button or press Ô+R.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Using someone else’s scripts is fun and all, but the real joy of AppleScript
comes when you create your own. Not only can you customize a script to your
own needs and desires, but saving all those keystrokes can really produce a
feeling of euphoria. (Okay, perhaps just Tiger power users will actually expe-
rience a heightened sense of existence . . . you’ll be there soon.)
Create a script without touching a key
You needn’t wear a pocket protector or tape the bridge of your glasses to
become proficient with AppleScript. In fact, the Script Editor can get you
up and running with AppleScript in no time at all. The secret weapon of the
AppleScript author is the Record function of the Script Editor. You click the
Record button, perform one or more actions in a recordable application, and
then return to the Script Editor where you click the Stop button. The Script
Editor stores each of your actions and compiles the whole list into an
AppleScript.
In theory, this is how it should all work, but in reality, finding recordable
Macintosh applications is not always so easy. The Finder is, perhaps, the
most recordable application on the Mac. Although some other applications
support recording, so few do that the Finder could be the only recordable
application most Mac users ever see.
To try it yourself, do the following steps to automate actions in the Finder:
1. Bring Script Editor to the foreground.
If Script Editor isn’t currently running, double-click its icon in the Finder.
If it is running, click its icon on the Dock.
2. Create a new script by pressing Ô+N.
3. Click the Record button.
The Record button is one of four buttons positioned near the top left of
a new script window. Refer to Figure 2-3.
4. Switch to the Finder and perform the actions that you want to automate.
When the Finder is active, you can select some icons on the Desktop
and move them around, resize any open Finder windows, or navigate to
your home directory. Any action that you perform in the Finder should
be acceptable fodder for the Script Editor. As you perform tasks in the
Finder, the Script Editor automatically generates a script that replicates
your actions.
5. Return to the Script Editor and click the Stop button.
To reactivate the Script Editor, click its icon on the Dock. Click the Stop
button to cease the recording of your script.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
630
When you’re finished, you should be looking at a complete AppleScript. To
test your work, return to the Finder and revert any icons or windows that
you might have moved or repositioned. (You don’t want to run a script that
doesn’t appear to have any effect.) Then return to the Script Editor and click
the Run button to watch your automated Finder tasks being performed.
Building your own scripts
An AppleScript novice can perform all kinds of amazing feats with the
recording features of the Script Editor. Because AppleScript uses a kind of
pseudo-English language, it’s usually pretty easy to figure out what’s going
on behind the scenes. Consider the following script for an example:
tell app “Finder”
activate
set windowList to every window --save list of open windows
repeat with theWindow in windowList
tell theWindow
if collapsed is true then
--do nothing, because the window is collapsed
else
set collapsed to true
end if
end tell
end repeat
end tell
(By the way, in the preceding code, I bolded the commands you’ll be working
with, but they don’t have to be bolded for the script to work.) Anyway, the
first thing that you might notice about this script is the first line: the tell
command, which indicates that this script relates to the Finder. This script
activates the Finder, creates a list of open windows, and then examines the
state of each window: Is it collapsed or not collapsed? (In Tiger, a collapsed,
or minimized, window appears on the Dock.) If the window is already mini-
mized and on the Dock, nothing happens, and the script continues through
the list of windows. If the window isn’t minimized, the script collapses it.
This continues until the script has examined all open windows. The end
result? All open windows end up minimized on the Dock.
Another thing to note about this script is that it has two comments in it
(save list and do nothing). Comments can help you remember what
you were thinking months later when you open the script again. Although
comments help us humans know what’s happening, they don’t really have
any other function. An AppleScript comment begins with two dashes (--).
Here’s a big-time Mark’s Maxim that every script author should remember:
Comments are your friend!™

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
Creating AppleScripts can soon become very involved, bordering on pro-
gramming. Don’t let that term programming scare you away, though. You
needn’t be a software developer to take advantage of AppleScripts. Apple
provides a lot of help to get you started along the AppleScript trail.
Grab the Dictionary
Perhaps the greatest resource for AppleScript novices and experts alike is the
AppleScript Dictionary. Although many applications are scriptable, not all
are. To be scriptable, an application must contain an AppleScript Dictionary.
An AppleScript Dictionary details the various commands and objects of an
application that you can access via AppleScript.
The Script Editor application allows you to peer inside an application and
view its AppleScript Dictionary. To open an application’s Dictionary, choose
File➪Open Dictionary. Mac OS X searches through your installed applications
and presents you with the Open Dictionary dialog, as shown in Figure 2-4,
which lists all applications that have a dictionary and are therefore scriptable.
If you don’t see your favorite application in the list, alas, it’s probably not
scriptable. To make certain, click the Browse button and select the applica-
tion in question.
After you select an application, the Script Editor displays that application’s
AppleScript Dictionary. An application’s dictionary lists all the features of
that application that are scriptable.
Scriptable features are divided into categories, called Suites, which you can
see on the left side of the AppleScript Dictionary. Every Mac application is
supposed to support the Standard Suite, which lists common terms that
most applications should support.
Click an item in the Suite on the left side of the Dictionary to view detailed
information about its capabilities, as shown in Figure 2-5.
By surveying the various Suites of an application, you begin to see what
tasks you can automate. The Finder, with its huge AppleScript Dictionary,
is perhaps the most scriptable of all applications.

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
632
Anatomy of a simple script
Although a full discussion of AppleScript programming is beyond the scope
of this book — after all, we have other things to talk about, too — that doesn’t
mean that you can’t produce some quick and useful scripts. Most AppleScripts
begin with a command that addresses the application that you want to auto-
mate. Enter this command into a new AppleScript document, which you
create by pressing Ô+N.
tell application “Finder”
This is like saying, “Hey, Finder, listen up! I’m going to send commands your
way!” The double quotes surround the application name that you’re address-
ing in the command.
Figure 2-4:

Book VII
Chapter 2

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
633
Similarly, after you finish instructing the Finder what tasks you want per-
formed, you must also tell it to stop listening. As such, typical scripts
end with
end tell
With the shell of a script in place, all you have to do is add commands in
between the tell and end tell commands of the script. If you want your
script to force an application to the foreground, an activate command is
usually the first line within the shell of your script.
tell application “Finder”
activate
end tell
Believe it or not, this is technically a complete and valid script! It doesn’t do
much, though, so add some more functionality to make it accomplish some-
thing worthwhile. For example, suppose you would like to perform some
housekeeping chores each time you log in to your Macintosh. Some desirable
tasks might include
✦Emptying the Trash
✦Having your Mac say, “Hello!” to you
Figure 2-5:

and syntax.

634
(Okay, I’ll grant that hearing your Mac say, “Hello!” isn’t a housekeeping chore,
but it makes the whole script that much more fun — and really impresses
your visitors, too. No one ever said programming had to be boring!)
To add these functions, you can do so by using a language you already know:
English. As I mention earlier, Apple tries (and sometimes succeeds) to make
AppleScript as English-like as possible. That way, you don’t have to learn some
silly computer language; just use your native tongue. For example, to empty
the Trash, tell the Finder to do so.
empty trash
The trickiest line of code might be the speech, and that’s only because you
need to remember to add quotes. AppleScript thinks that anything without
quotes is an AppleScript command.
say “Hello!”
The result is a super-simple script that anyone can read but that performs
two powerful functions. The completed script looks like this:
tell app “Finder”
activate
empty trash
say “Hello!”
end tell
After you complete the script, choose File➪Save to save your script. Because
you want the script to execute and then quit, use the File Format field to save
it as an application. Also, make sure that the Stay Open check box is disabled
and that the Startup Screen check box is disabled. And don’t forget to name
your script in the Save As text field.
To have the script automatically run each time you log in to your Mac, save
the script anywhere that you wish. (Assign its home folder in the Where field
of the Save window.) Open System Preferences by clicking its icon on the
Dock, click the Accounts icon, and then click Login Items. Click the Add
button (which proudly bears a plus sign) and navigate to your script in the
Open dialog that appears. After you click the Add button of the Open dialog,
you’ll see the script in the Login Items window.
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
Okay, perhaps I’ve watched too much Iron Chef over the years. Anyway, Tiger
ushers in a new kid in town — Automator (as shown in Figure 2-6) — and he’s
your own personal robotic AppleScript coder. In fact, Automator can create
custom applications that can handle your repetitive tasks. You can even

Chapter 2

635
create workflows, which are sequential (and repeatable) operations that are
performed on the same files or data, and your Automator application can auto-
matically launch whatever applications are necessary to get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD
every week with new product shots for your company’s Marketing department.
Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-megapixel
camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you move
them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to laboriously resize
each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.
With Automator’s help, you can build a custom application that automati-
cally reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and even generates
a thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves the massaged images
to the proper folder. You would normally have to manually launch Preview to
perform the image operations and then use a Finder window to move the new
files to the right location. But now, with Automator, a single double-click of
your custom application icon does the trick.
You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator can
handle specific tasks within about 20 applications (including the Finder), but
both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new Automator task
support to all sorts of new and existing applications.

To create a simple application using Automator, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired application in the Library column.
Automator displays the actions available within that application.
2. Drag the desired action into the workflow area (right side of the
window).
3. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
5. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.
Use sample files while you’re fine-tuning your application lest you acci-
dentally do something deleterious to an original (and irreplaceable) file!
Figure 2-7 illustrates an application that will take care of the earlier
example — resizing and rotating a folder full of images, and then
moving them to the Pictures folder.
6. When the application is working as you like, press Ô+Shift+S to
save it.
7. In the Save dialog that appears, type a name for your new application.
8. Click the File Format drop-down list box and choose Application.
9. Click Save.

To find all the actions of a certain type within the Library list, click in the

If a task in your Automator application needs different values each time you
run it, you can set your application for manual input by selecting the Ask When
Run check box in the workflow, which allows your application to prompt you
with a dialog requesting the necessary values (like a target folder on your
hard drive, or a prefix to add to your images).
Help Is at Your Fingertips
If you would like to explore AppleScript further, you have many resources
on hand. Sometimes the easiest way to use AppleScript is to copy existing
scripts and modify them as necessary; other times, it’s a good idea to read
the documentation included in Apple’s Help system. Whichever approach
you use, with a little practice and guidance, you’ll soon be doing stupendous
tasks with your Mac.
Built-in AppleScript Help
The most readily available AppleScript reference is built into Mac OS X.
Choose Help➪Mac Help to launch the Mac OS Help Guides from the Finder
or choose Help➪Script Editor Help from the Script Editor. This is a great
place to begin your AppleScript exploration. It includes detailed documenta-
tion about the AppleScript language and loads of demonstration scripts for
you to try (or alter) yourself.
AppleScript on the Web
In addition to the built-in AppleScript help in the Finder, the Internet has
much to offer in the way of AppleScript training and examples. Like so many
other excellent Web resources, AppleScripts are free!
Not all AppleScripts are created equal: When downloading scripts from the
Internet, make sure that they’re compatible with Tiger (Mac OS X v. 10.4).
Although the majority of scripts made for Mac OS 9 also work with Mac OS X,
some simply won’t. The converse is also true: Sometimes a script is meant
solely for use with Mac OS X.
Apple Computer
The first place on the Web that you should visit for AppleScript help is the
Source of All That Is Good, also called the Mother Ship: Apple Computer.
Although the built-in OS X help offers a lot, the Apple Web site offers even

Help Is at Your Fingertips

more scripts, tutorials, and general AppleScript goodness. You can even find
a list of all known scriptable applications, which can save you from search-
ing for them with Script Editor. Furthermore, the site maintains an extensive
list of links to other useful AppleScript sites.
www.apple.com/applescript
ResExcellence
For the hacker in all of us, ResExcellence sports many unique system tweaks,
modifications, and outright hacks. Among the ResExcellence bag of tricks is
an extensive list of AppleScripts for you to download. Although not geared
strictly towards AppleScript, ResExcellence offers many excellent scripts for
customizing your Desktop, doing things you didn’t think possible, and gener-
ally making your Macintosh experience more fulfilling.

MacScripter.net
MacScripter.net devotes its site to all Macintosh scripting. Because AppleScript
is such a huge part of scripting the Mac OS, you can be certain that there’s
something here for you. Besides offering up-to-date news on scripting for the
Mac OS, MacScripter.net also gives you access to many scripts, information
about scripting books, and details on Apple’s new AppleScript Studio soft-
ware, which lets you create AppleScripts with interfaces. The sheer volume
of information at this site makes it one you shouldn’t skip.

f you’re a hunt-and-peck typist — leaving you certain that there must be
some better way to get information into your computer — you’ll be happy
to know that Apple has you in mind. Since the very first Mac rolled off the
assembly line, Apple has had a keen interest in alternative modes of interac-
tion between human and machine. Mac OS X continues in this tradition of
alternative computer controls, offering two options for controlling Mac OS X
without the keyboard: handwriting and speech.
✦Handwriting: By using a pen and computer tablet, you can enter text
into your Mac by simply writing as you would on a sheet of paper.
✦Speech: Talk to your Mac to make it listen and obey your commands.
It even talks back!
This chapter guides you through the various options that you have for 
controlling your Macintosh without using the keyboard. First, I cover the
Mac OS X Inkwell feature, which you use to write on a tablet to enter data
into your computer. (Although it sounds a bit ironic, think of Inkwell as your
“digital paper” for the new millennium.) Whatever you write on the tablet
appears on the screen as text.
I also take a look at the more space-age speech capabilities available to you
in Mac OS X. With your voice, you can command a Macintosh to perform all
sorts of interesting feats. And just so you don’t get lonely, the Mac will even
talk back to you. (Now you can control your computer just like Spock from
Star Trek!) And Tiger’s new VoiceOver feature makes it easy for your Mac to
read aloud all sorts of text, including Web pages, Mail messages, and word
processing documents.
So, scoot away from your computer, lean that chair back, and let your Mac
take care of the rest.

Using Ink with a Tablet
640
Using Ink with a Tablet
Typing on a keyboard can be a tedious and error-prone experience for even
the best typists. To help out, Apple added some useful handwriting features to
Mac OS X. Based in part on some of Apple’s handheld software for the Newton
(one of the first personal digital assistants [PDAs], and a product released
before its time), the handwriting recognition in Mac OS X gives you the abil-
ity to write text on a compatible tablet for use in your favorite applications.
The basic process of working with handwriting on Mac OS X goes like this:
1. Attach a tablet to your Mac.
Most tablets use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, so connecting
one to your computer is as simple as plugging in the cable from your
tablet to the USB port on your Mac.
2. Write on the tablet with the stylus that accompanies it.
A stylus is the name given the fake “pen” that accompanies most tablets.
A stylus doesn’t have any ink in it: It’s just a pen-shaped tool with a plas-
tic tip meant for writing on a tablet.
3. Your Mac interprets your handwriting.
After your Mac recognizes the handwriting, it sends that text to the fore-
most application at the cursor location where you would normally type
with the keyboard. You’re spared the whole training bit, too.
You aren’t restricted to writing just text on the tablet, naturally. You can use it
to control the interface of your Mac as you would a mouse. A tablet also works
great for graphics applications like procreate Painter and Adobe Photoshop.
Many artists are frustrated when drawing with a mouse; but when you use a
tablet, you can feel right at home with the natural pen or brush movements
that you’ve always used.
Although Inkwell pretty much takes care of preparing your Mac for handwriting
recognition, it does offer you a few settings in the Inkwell panel within System
Preferences. To view the System Preferences, click the System Preferences
icon on the Dock. From there, click the Inkwell icon to adjust settings for
your tablet.
If you don’t have a tablet connected to your Macintosh, you won’t be able to
view the System Preferences pane for Inkwell. Mac OS X is smart enough to
show you only the settings for your current hardware setup.

Talking and Writing

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
641
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Remember that classic scene from the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
where Scotty picks up the mouse on a Macintosh and tries to talk directly to
the computer? Since the very early days of the Mac OS, Apple has included
some form of speech recognition in their computers. Tiger continues to
improve on speech recognition by offering a host of tools that let you get
more work done in a shorter amount of time. (We’re not to that point yet,
Scotty, but we’re working on it.)
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X let you speak a word, phrase,
or sentence. After you’ve spoken, your Mac goes to work translating what you
said — and if it understands the phrase, it then performs an action associated
with that phrase. The great part about this system is that you can say any
phrase in continuous speech and have your Mac perform any sort of action
that you can imagine. In fact, you aren’t limited to just one action: You could
perform dozens of actions upon speaking a particular phrase.
Before you get started using Speech Recognition, you need a microphone
to get sound into your Mac. Most current Macintosh models have a built-in
microphone; for example, if you use an iMac G5, your microphone is built into
the monitor. PowerBooks and iBooks have a similar microphone built into the
screen. If your Mac doesn’t have a microphone, connect one to the rear of
your Macintosh by plugging it into the microphone jack.
If you’re looking for the best quality audio input from your microphone for
use with iChat AV, check out a microphone with a USB connection. You’ll get
far better sound quality than a microphone that connects to your analog jack.
The Speech Recognition tab
To get started with Speech Recognition in Mac OS X, open the System
Preferences window by clicking its icon on the Dock and then clicking the
Speech icon. This brings up the Speech panel, as shown in Figure 3-1.
You’ll find that two tabs comprise the speech settings of Mac OS X:
✦Speech Recognition
✦Text to Speech
In this section, I’m only concerned with the Speech Recognition tab. Later, in
the section “Your Mac Talks Back!” I explore the Text to Speech tab.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
642
The Speech Recognition tab consists of two sub-tabs:
✦Settings: The Settings tab provides a number of settings that control
how your Mac listens to Its Master’s Voice. (Meaning you, friend reader.)
From here, you can set the sound input, adjust the key on the keyboard
that toggles speech recognition on and off, change microphone settings,
and name your computer with a keyword. (You do want to call your com-
puter by name like any techno-wizard, don’t you?)
✦Commands: When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac can under-
stand any number of commands. From the Commands tab, you tell the
Mac what type of command it should expect you to give. You can also
specify whether you will be giving the commands word-for-word or
whether your Mac should be prepared to interpret paraphrasing. A
number of specific applications and menus can be configured with
speakable items, like contact names within Tiger’s Address Book.
Crowning the Speech Recognition panel are the Speakable Items On and Off
radio buttons. You’ve probably already guessed how to use ’em to switch
Speech Recognition features on and off.
When you select the On radio button, the small circular Speech Recognition
Feedback window appears on your screen, floating above all other windows.
Learn this face well because the Feedback window (also shown in Figure 3-1)
is your friend and partner. If you use Speech Recognition often, it’ll become a
constant companion on your Desktop. (More on it in the next section.)

The Settings panel
At the bottom of the Settings panel is the Upon Recognition section. When
your Mac comprehends one of your stentorian commands, you can set it to
respond by playing a sound, speaking a confirmation, or both. This is helpful
when you’re not sure whether your Mac understands you. One hundred per-
cent recognition is not a reality on any computer at this point, so sometimes
it helps to have any feedback that you can get. Otherwise, you might feel silly
shouting at your machine while it sits there doing nothing. (Or perhaps not,
if you’re into really cheap anger management.)
You can choose between two styles of listening with the Listening Method
options:
✦Listen Only While Key Is Pressed: Speech Recognition works only while
the designated key is held down.
✦Listen Continuously with Keyword: When you speak the keyword, lis-
tening turns on and remains on.
To change what key must be toggled or held down, click the Change Key
button.
Why change the keyword? Instead of saying, “Computer, empty the Trash!”
you might prefer, “Elrond, empty the Trash!” This adds a little bit of person-
ality to the interaction and also gives your computer a slightly longer time to
react to your command. (As a general rule, the longer the spoken phrase, the
more likely your Mac will understand it.) If you select the Listen Continuously
with Keyword feature, you can change your computer’s name via the Keyword
text box.
Finally, you can select the microphone that you want to use from the
Microphone drop-down list box on the Settings panel — a great feature if
you have more than one microphone connected to your Mac. Click the
Calibrate key to adjust the sound volume for better recognition.
The Commands panel
When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac listens for whatever phrases
appear in your Speakable Items folder (a directory on your hard drive that
holds a number of scripts). The Commands tab (as shown in Figure 3-2) allows
you to view the contents of this folder. When you speak a phrase that matches
one of these filenames, your Mac automatically executes that script. The script
can perform any number of actions, which is what makes Speech Recognition
so powerful. Apple includes a large number of scripts with Mac OS X, but
you’re free to create your own, too.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
644
To make something speakable, select the item and then speak the command,
“Make this speakable.” The new speakable command is based upon the
item’s name.
To view the contents of the Speakable Items folder, click the Open Speakable
Items Folder button on the Commands panel. The Finder comes to the fore-
ground and navigates to the folder that holds the scripts. This is handy
because each item in the Speakable Items folder is speakable.
To the right of the Open Speakable Items Folder button is another button:
Helpful Tips. Click it to get some pointers on how to get the best perform-
ance from your microphone.
As I mention in the preceding section, the Speech Recognition features of
Mac OS X are not restricted to items in the Speakable Items folder. Any 
application that supports Speech Recognition is also fair game for your
verbal manipulation. To control commands within other applications, use
the Commands tab (refer to Figure 3-2). Here you can enable the following
check boxes:
✦Address Book
✦Global Speakable Items
✦Application Specific Items
✦Application Switching

✦Front Window (requires that you activate assistive devices in the
Universal Access panel within System Preferences)
✦Menu Bar (requires that you activate assistive devices in the Universal
Access panel within System Preferences)
Mark any one of these options to allow your Mac to listen to those kinds of
commands.
The Feedback window
After you activate Speech Recognition, you’ll instantly see the Feedback
window. You can click and drag the edge of the window to position it any-
where on your Desktop.
The Feedback window includes controls and displays of its own:
✦Microphone Level Meter: The Feedback window displays indicators to
let you know how loud the input to your microphone is.
✦Visual Indicator: The Feedback window displays visual feedback to
let you know what mode it is in: idle, listening, or hearing a command.
When the microphone is not grayed out but there are no arrows on either
side of the microphone, you’re in listening mode. When the microphone
is flanked by animated arrows, your computer is hearing a command
spoken. When Speech Recognition is idle, no arrows are present, and the
microphone is grayed out.
✦Quick-Access Menu: You can quickly access the Speech preferences
for the System or view the Speech Commands window. Just click the
downward-pointing arrow at the bottom of the Feedback window, and
a menu appears giving you one-click access to both.
As soon as you disable speech recognition in the System Preferences, the
Feedback window disappears.
The Speech Command window
Because Speech Recognition might be listening for different sets of com-
mands from the Finder or many other applications, Mac OS X provides you
with a single listing of all commands that you might speak at any given time:
the Speech Commands window. To open the Speech Commands window,
click the triangle at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open
Speech Commands Window from the menu that appears.
The Speech Commands window is a simple one, but it serves an important
purpose: to let you know what commands Mac OS X understands. The Speech
Commands pane, as shown in Figure 3-3, organizes commands into categories
that match the settings in the Speech pane of the System Preferences.

Your Mac Talks Back!
646
If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac OS X
adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window. Speak
any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For example,
Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as “Mail To”
and “Video Chat With.”
Apple might be a big, serious, computer company — yeah, right — but it isn’t
without a humorous side! With Speech Recognition enabled, say the phrase,
“Tell me a joke.” Your Mac will reply with a random joke. Say it again, and
your Mac will tell you another joke. (Brace yourself, these jokes were likely
written by Windows users . . . they’re really, really bad.) Oh, and if you get a
“Knock, Knock” joke, remember that you have to actually say, “Who’s there?”
Your Mac Talks Back!
Mac OS X is great at listening to your speech, but the fun doesn’t stop there . . .
your Mac can talk to you, too! By using one of the many available voices, you
can make your computer talk or even sing. (Not as well as Sinatra, but better
than Bob Dylan.) And although Speech Recognition lets you speak to your
Macintosh, the new VoiceOver feature in Tiger gives your Mac the ability to
speak text. This is an especially useful feature because it lets you listen to
Figure 3-3:
The Speech
Commands
window,

work.

your e-mails, Web pages, or even your homework — sometimes the eyes
need a break. Text-to-speech gives you the opportunity to lean back in your
chair or even get up and walk around while still using your Macintosh.
Text-to-speech settings appear in three places within System Preferences:
our old friend, the Speech pane; the Date & Time pane; and the VoiceOver
settings within the Universal Access pane.
The Text to Speech panel
The text-to-speech engine that comes with Tiger has a collection of many dif-
ferent voices from which to choose; some voices are male, some are female,
and some aren’t human at all. To select your Mac’s voice in Mac OS X, follow
these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Speech icon.
3. Click the Text to Speech tab, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Click the System Voice drop-down list box to choose a voice for your Mac.
To hear the voice, click Play; Tiger speaks a sentence as a demonstration. To
the left of the Play button is a slider for adjusting the speed of the speech.
Move the slider to the right to increase the speed at which your Mac speaks
and to the left to slow it down.
Figure 3-4:

648
Personally, I think that Bruce, Vicki, Victoria, Kathy, and Ralph have some of
the more intelligible voices of the bunch. (I’m a Vicki kinda guy myself.)
Talking alerts
After you select a voice, you have a variety of ways to make your Macintosh
speak automatically to you, based on some simple rules. For example, every
Mac owner has run into an Alert dialog. (Alert dialogs are typically accompa-
nied by a select group of words — better left unspoken — from the human
behind the keyboard.) An Alert dialog usually displays some kind of icon
from the following list:
✦Stop sign: Indicates that something particularly important requires your
attention — usually an error or a dire warning.
✦Yield sign: Signals that you should cautiously proceed; not as severe as
the Stop sign, but important nonetheless.
✦Notification: Looks like the profile of a person speaking; displays an
informative message, but not a warning. You could use this feature, for
example, to have a calendar application alert you when you have a meet-
ing or a deadline.
From the Text to Speech panel, you can choose to have your Mac speak a
specific phrase or the contents of the Alert dialog by selecting one of the
check boxes at the middle of the panel. If you enable the Announce When
Alerts Are Displayed check box, click the Set Alert Options button to set
alert-specific options:
✦Voice: Choose the voice that should speak alerts. (By default, it’s the
voice you choose earlier.)
✦Phrase: Click this drop-down list box to choose a “prefix” phrase that
will be spoken before the actual alert text. By default, Tiger speaks the
name of the application that displayed the alert, but you can also choose
a phrase from the list, or choose to mix up the phrases for a little variety.
To add or remove phrases, click the Edit Phrases item.
✦Delay: Drag this slider to control the increment of time that Tiger allows
to pass before it speaks.
To hear what your spoken alert settings will sound like in use, click the Play
button.
If you click the Play button on the Set Alert Options sheet and don’t hear
anything right away, remember that it won’t begin speaking until the time
has elapsed that you set with the Delay slider. To hear the spoken alerts
speak as soon as you click the Play button, move the slider to 0 (zero).

Other spoken items
In addition to spoken alerts, you can allow your Mac to speak when other
actions occur. Again, these settings are found on the Text to Speech panel.
Your Mac can speak in the following circumstances:
✦Announce when an application requires your attention: In case you
have your Dock hidden from view, it’s not always clear when an applica-
tion needs your attention. In these instances, Mac OS X will grab your
attention via speech.
✦Read a selection of text when you press a particular key: If you have a
child who is learning to read, the Mac can help them by reading a selec-
tion of text. Kids can learn how to drag and select text often more quickly
than they can read that text.
✦Announce the time: Are you like me, constantly getting lost in time
while immersed in your work? (Not to mention your favorite game.)
I’ve set my iMac G5 to announce the hour, which always keeps my time
sense firmly planted.
The Date & Time panel
There you are, deep in concentration as you finish up the final chapter of
your Great American Novel, when you glance at the clock in the Finder menu
bar and realize that you were supposed to pick up your kids at soccer prac-
tice a full hour ago!
You can avoid this shameful lapse of parental responsibility by turning on
Tiger’s automatic spoken time feature, which is controlled from the Date &
Time pane within System Preferences (and is much more effective than a
mechanical cuckoo clock). But why go to all the trouble of clicking Show All
when you can just click the Open Date & Time Preferences button on the
Text to Speech panel? Tiger immediately switches to display the Date &
Time panel. You can even click the Clock on the Finder menu bar and click
Open Date & Time. (Again, it’s all about the convenience when it comes to
the geniuses at Apple.)
Mark the Announce the Time check box to enable your Mac to speak the
time; then use the Period drop-down list box to choose spoken time at the
quarter, half, or full hour. You can also customize the voice for spoken time
as well.
After you’re done, zip back to the Speech pane by clicking the Back button at
the top-left corner of the System Preferences window.

Your Mac Talks Back!
650
Configuring VoiceOver within 
the Universal Access panel
With Tiger’s VoiceOver utility, your Mac can provide you with all sorts of verbal
feedback, creating a spoken English interface with Tiger — a valuable addition
to the operating system for the physically impaired. The feedback includes
✦Announcing when certain keys are pressed: Tiger can tell you when a
modifier key (like Control, Option, or Ô) is pressed or when the Caps
Lock key is pressed.
✦Announcing cursor movements: You’ll hear an audible alert when your
mouse cursor switches between windows or when you’ve clicked on a
menu.
✦Announcing the position of the VoiceOver cursor: VoiceOver can audibly
identify all operating system controls (like buttons, sliders, and list boxes)
by using a special onscreen cursor.
✦Reading documents, Web pages, and Mail messages: VoiceOver can read
aloud the contents of all sorts of documents and application windows.
✦Speaking the characters you type: You can set VoiceOver to speak
every character or each word you type.
Here is how to enable VoiceOver (or to launch the VoiceOver utility, as
shown in Figure 3-5):
1. Click the Open Universal Access Preferences button on the Text to
Speech panel.

2. Select the On radio button (or press Ô+F5) to enable VoiceOver.
To customize how VoiceOver operates, click the Open VoiceOver Utility
button.
Speaking text through applications
Although VoiceOver provides a comprehensive text-to-speech interface for
Mac OS X, it might be more than you need. If you simply want to hear text
spoken within your applications, there are a number of alternative methods
included in Tiger that don’t require VoiceOver.
One of the simplest ways to hear spoken text in Mac OS X is by using the
TextEdit application. TextEdit is a simple text processor that accompanies
every copy of Mac OS X. Besides its handy word processing features,
TextEdit can also speak text. This is good for reviewing a document after
you’ve written it by listening to it. To hear spoken text with TextEdit, follow
these steps:
1. Launch TextEdit from the Applications folder.
To open the Applications folder, choose Go➪Applications from the
Finder. In the window that appears, double-click the TextEdit application.
This launches the TextEdit application and opens a new document.
2. Enter some text.
Either type some text on the keyboard or paste some into the document
from the Clipboard. Here’s a favorite example from this book’s technical
editor (especially when you use the Cellos voice):
Billy Gates has lots of cash
Lots of cash
Lots of cash
Billy Gates has lots of cash
I’d like $10 please!
3. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking.
Your Mac will begin speaking the text from the document. The speech
engine has some intelligence, so you can enter dollar amounts (such as
$25,423.12) or Roman numerals (such as Chapter XIV), and the speech
engine will read them back in plain English. The result of these two strings
would be “twenty-five thousand, four-hundred twenty-three dollars, and
twelve cents” and “chapter fourteen.”
4. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.
You Mac will stop speaking. It will also stop speaking when it reaches the
end of the text.

Your Mac Talks Back!
652
Speaking text through services
You can also speak text within most applications by using the Services menu,
located under the application’s named menu. To speak text from an applica-
tion, first select that text. Then, choose Application➪Services➪Speech➪Start
Speaking to speak text from many applications (where Application is the name
of the currently running application). If you don’t want to use VoiceOver, this
works great for doing things like
✦Speaking a Web page aloud
✦Reading your e-mail
✦Listening to a speech you’ve written in Pages
As you might expect, choosing Application➪Services➪Speech➪Stop
Speaking ceases the banter emanating from your Mac’s speaker.
Alas, not all applications are created equal. Some applications cannot access
the Services offered in the Services menu — if you don’t see Speech in the
list of services, you’re out of luck.

n the last ten years, surfing the Internet has gone from a nerd’s hobby to
a fun activity enjoyed by the whole family. For children and grandparents
alike, Web surfing has become one of the world’s most popular spectator
sports — and at some point, you’ll probably get the itch to become more
involved. Everyone else has a Web site, so why not you?
Creating and hosting your own Web site can be a rewarding experience, and
with some help from Apple and Mac OS X, it’s a cinch to do. Whether you want
to share your favorite eggplant recipes, display pictures of your aubergine
Auburn, or just post a purple résumé, Mac OS X has you covered in more
ways than one. So put on your seat belts — you’re now entering a strange
world of servers, mysterious codes, and things that go bump in the Net. No
need for alarm, though . . . Apple has made the topic so simple that even a
politician can do it.
Building a Site with .Mac
To get you up and running on the Web quickly, Apple offers a suite of online
Web-publishing tools. The toolbox, collectively known as .Mac, gives you
easy and fast access to a variety of Internet functions. A .Mac membership
costs $99.95 per year and offers the following features:

Building a Site with .Mac

✦iCards: Send customized electronic postcards via the Internet.
✦HomePage: Build and edit your own Web site.
✦iDisk: This disk space on Apple’s servers is where you can post a Web site
or files. (And this is where you store files for use in your own HomePage
creations.)
✦Backup: Safeguard your data the right way — across the Internet, or to
your Mac’s CD or DVD recorder.
✦Address Book and iCal sharing: Store and publish data from your local
Address Book and iCal files.
✦Email: This covers Web-based e-mail for your Mac.com e-mail account.
Registering as a .Mac user
You can visit Apple’s home on the Internet to register as a .Mac user:
www.mac.com
To register for your free 60-day trial, you must create a username and 
password. The username that you select is an important part of the .Mac
experience, so choose it carefully. Your username plays a part in your
e-mail address, your Web address, your login name, and even the bar code
on your forehead. (Okay, the bar code is a joke — for now, anyway — but
the rest aren’t.) Take a few minutes to carefully plan your .Mac username.
It will save you some typing, be easier for your friends to remember, and
(like a customized license plate for your car) can convey a certain personal-
ity to others on the Web.
Setting up your site with HomePage
After you successfully register as a .Mac user, log in to the .Mac section
of the Apple Web site. You can find it on the toolbar at the top of the
Web page.
Click the HomePage icon that appears at the left side (or top) of the page.
This takes you to the login screen (see Figure 4-1). Enter your username
and password that you entered upon registration and click the Enter 
button.

HomePage is a complete publishing tool for building Web pages that’s actu-
ally a Web site itself. HomePage lets you choose from a variety of styles that
you can then apply to your Web site within a matter of seconds; because it’s
template driven, even non-techies can produce impressive-looking Web sites.
After you finish designing your Web pages by selecting one of the premade
templates, HomePage automatically posts them to your .Mac Web site.
The HomePage interface includes two sections: the Pages section and the
Create a Page section. The Pages section (as shown at the top of Figure 4-2)
is where you manage the various pages of your site; here you can view a list
of all pages on your site as well as password-protect any pages on your site.
After you complete your site, you can get spiffy and formal by sending an
announcement (click the Announce Site button) to all your friends from the
Site section.

Scroll down to the Create a Page section, as shown in Figure 4-3, from which
you can directly add a page to your site based on a variety of premade Web
page templates. Apple offers a multitude of styles to suit your needs. Click
any one of these styles to add it to your Web site. When you do, .Mac walks
you through a series of questions that indicate what specific information,
graphics, or movies you want on that Web page.
✦Photo Album: Display your favorite photos and images for your friends
and family.
✦File Sharing: With HomePage, you can quickly post your favorite files
for others to download.
✦Site Menu: This top-level menu design helps visitors navigate quickly
around your site.
✦iMovie: Post your home videos or iMovie creations on the Web. 
(To discover all about iMovie HD, read Book III, Chapter 4.)
✦Writing: Want to update all those close (and not-so-close) relatives on
your family’s doings? Put out a newspaper or post an online diary.
✦Resume: Looking for a job? A Web-based résumé is a handy tool for
impressing prospective employers.

✦Baby: When your bundle of joy arrives, it’s a cinch to post photos of
the new baby to your HomePage site. This works great for long-distance
relatives because they can cyber-visit the hospital without leaving home.
It also works well for keeping those curious aunts and uncles out of the
delivery room.
✦Education: Schools are depending more and more on the Internet. To help
the student and the teacher, Apple provides several useful education-
related pages for you to use, including event calendars, homework pages,
and an online school newspaper.
✦Invite: The Web makes for a great tool when it comes to delivering invi-
tations. Gone are the hassles of standing in line at the post office, licking
300 stamps, and having cards lost in the mail. Send your guests a Web-
based invitation. Your guests will thank you. The trees that you save will
thank you. Moreover, your tongue will thank you. The post office, how-
ever, might not thank you, but why should it start now?
✦Advanced: Click this tab to add pages you’ve created with an external
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) editor. (Read more about these
editors in the upcoming sections, “Creating a Home Page with HTML
and iDisk” and “Serving static information.”)
Figure 4-3:
Create new
pages here.

Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
658
Keep adding pages to your site as you see fit. Each type of page has a differ-
ent layout. If a page requires media like images or movies, for example,
HomePage automatically lists all media available on your iDisk. You simply
select the desired media file, and HomePage adds them to the current page.
The following section elaborates more on iDisk.
After you complete your Web site, you access it by using a URL like this
(with your_username replaced with your actual username):
http://homepage.mac.com/your_username
Adding files with iDisk
If you create a Web page with HomePage that requires images or movies, you
add them to your site by using iDisk. iDisk is a space on Apple’s servers des-
ignated just for you, where HomePage stores the elements of your site when
you add or change Web pages.
You aren’t limited to iDisk access via HomePage: Simply choose the iDisk menu
from the Finder’s Go menu to mount your iDisk. (No need for a saddle — I
explain more about mounting volumes in Book I.) When you mount an iDisk,
it shows up as an icon on your Desktop, just like you might see when you
insert a CD into your Mac. The icon for your iDisk, however, looks like a hard
drive with a blue globe on top of it.
With your iDisk mounted, double-click its icon to view its contents. Apple
organizes iDisk with a handful of folders that correspond to the page types in
HomePage; you can’t delete or rename these folders, however. If you need an
image for your photo album page, stick it in the Pictures folder. If you need a
movie for your Web page, copy it to the Movies folder. When you return to
HomePage, your files now appear in the list of items that you can use in a
Web page.
Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
For those folks who like driving a car without knowing what goes on under
the hood, HomePage is perfect: You just use it to create and post Web pages
without knowing what makes it all work. On the other hand, some folks are
born mechanics and like to get under the hood. If you’re itching to see what
goes on behind the scenes, Apple gives you a chance to get your hands dirty.
Of course, you don’t have to use HomePage to work on your Web site. If you’re
well versed in HTML, you can edit your Web page files on your iDisk just like
you would any file on your hard drive.

Book VII
Chapter 4

659
Within your iDisk, open the Sites folder to see the various files that compose
your Web page. If you’re an old pro at HTML, you can add your own pages to
your iDisk with your favorite text editor. In other words, the iDisk acts much
like any other disk that you’re accustomed to using. (For all the inside infor-
mation on iDisk, see Chapter 4 of Book IV.)
As I mention earlier, you can also click the Advanced tab in the Create a Page
section to have HomePage assist you in uploading your own pages.
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
With .Mac, Apple takes care of the Web server for you, but you aren’t lim-
ited to .Mac: You have other options when it comes to posting Web pages.
Mac OS X comes stocked with its own high-powered Web server, so you can
run things without .Mac. Consider the advantages, won’t you?
✦Privacy: Everyone in the house wants access to the family phone book.
You want all computers on your home network to see the telephone list
but not the whole world. Posting it on the home network keeps it secure
from prying eyes outside your home.
✦Your own domain: Want a name like www.size14feetphotos.com?
(Don’t even think about it, I’ve already taken it.) Anyway, if you run your
own Web server, you can arrange for your own domain name.
✦Speed: Your friend needs a copy of your iMovie HD masterpiece for a
class project. Rather than wait for you to post the file to your iDisk, he
decides to download it directly from your computer.
✦Coolness factor: It’s fun, easy to do, and your mother will truly be
proud. Seriously, it is fun and easy to run your own Web server.
(And although your mother might not actually give a hoot, companies
appreciate employees who know useful skills; therefore, Web server
stuff is good to know.)
I love Apache: Confessions of a UNIX Webmaster
Deep in the guts of Mac OS X lies one of the most popular Web servers
around: Apache, which turns your Macintosh into a full-featured Web server.
The Apache Web server is well known around the world and comprises
about half of all personal and commercial Web servers in use today. Yes,
that’s right! You have one of the world’s most-used Web servers already
installed on your Mac!

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
660
Apache’s first appealing feature is its price — absolutely free. Free is sassy!
Free isn’t any good without quality, though. Fortunately, Apache is extremely
reliable — and combined with the crash-proof Mac OS X, you can be almost
certain that your Web server will always be available. Besides being rock-
solid and free, Apache sports all the features you’d expect from a top-notch
Web server, such as techno-wizard integration with databases and scripting
languages. Believe me, it can serve anything you throw at it.
Configuring and running Apache
In addition to all its great qualities, Apache is dead simple to operate in
Mac OS X. Open System Preferences and click the Sharing icon; then mark the
check box next to Personal Web Sharing to launch Apache. That’s it! It doesn’t
get any easier . . . at least, when it comes to turning on Apache. (See Figure 4-4.)
To begin using your Web server, open a Finder window and navigate to the
Sites folder that resides in your Home folder; this is the root of your personal
space on the Web server. Any files that you add to this folder are accessible
via your Web server.
You might find a file named index.html already installed in the Sites folder.
This is the default file for your Web site. To view it, open your favorite Web
browser and load this URL, replacing ~username with the username that
you’re currently using:

Apache is

http://127.0.0.1/~username/
The 127.0.0.1 address is a generic Internet Protocol (IP) address, which means
self. (In other words, your Mac is connecting to itself. Faintly unsettling, but
absolutely legal.) You can also use your real IP address, which appears at the
bottom of the Sharing panel in the System Preferences when you turn on
Personal Web Sharing.
To see the Web page from another computer, you must use the real IP address.
The 127.0.0.1 address is merely a convenience for use when you’re using the
actual machine that runs the Web server.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, each user can host a Web
site. The key is the username found at the end of the URL; replace it with
the appropriate username, and you’re ready to go. If everything goes
smoothly, you should be viewing the default Mac OS X Web page, as shown
in Figure 4-5. The default page displays a welcome message and some impor-
tant information for Web-sharing beginners. Make sure that you read the
information carefully.
Figure 4-5:
Replace this
default Web
page with

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing

In addition to a main page for any individual that logs in, the Web server also
has a global default page. To find the global default page, follow these steps:
1. Open a new Finder window.
2. Double-click the drive that contains your Mac OS X installation.
3. Choose Library➪WebServer➪Documents.
Here you’ll find dozens of HTML files. These files are the default global home
pages for many different languages. For English versions of the Mac OS, this
means that the file named index.html.en serves as the default home page
for the server. To view this file in your browser, try this URL:
http://127.0.0.1/
Serving static information
To change the default Web page, simply open it in your favorite HTML
editor and start changing it. An HTML editor is an application that lets you
lay out your Web page with what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) ease.
If you’re familiar with a word processor, you’re well on your way to using
an HTML editor. Of the many HTML editors available, VersionTracker (www.
versiontracker.com) will give you a good head start on finding some of
the most popular ones.
You aren’t limited only to HTML editors, of course. Many word processors
support HTML export — I particularly like Microsoft Word — so it’s trés easy
to create Web pages with them by simply choosing File➪Save As.
If you already know HTML (Webmasters might say, “If you can bang out raw
HTML code”), you can edit your Web pages by hand. Open the existing index.
html file with a text editor like TextEdit or BBEdit (www.barebones.com) by
choosing File➪Open and change it to suit your needs. For example, a simple
Web page might read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!
</body>
</html>

Plain old HTML pages are handy for displaying the same information repeat-
edly. Computer Web-wizards call this type of information static. (That is, it
doesn’t change. Like a fully grown Chia Pet, you can set it once and forget
about it.)
Serving information dynamically
Although static displays are good for things like your copy of the Magna
Carta or sports stats from the past 20 years, they’re not so great for data that
changes a lot (usually referred to as dynamic, if you hadn’t already guessed).
Some good examples of dynamic information are the date, the time, your age,
or the weather. If you were to display your age on a Web page by using only
HTML, you’d have to change it only once every year. This isn’t so bad, but
consider what happens if you want to post the date on a Web page: Now you
have to update the Web page once per day. Add the time, and now you’re
down to HTML changes every hour, minute, or second, depending on how
reliable you want to make the clock. Clearly, you need something besides
static HTML for dynamic information.
The Apache Web server allows you to use a variety of tools to produce
dynamic Web pages. The most basic tool for serving dynamic data is the
Server Side Include. The Web server executes a small piece of code in your
HTML; then the Web server replaces that code with some text and sends the
page to whomever requested it. The result is dynamic text in your Web page.
Adding Server Side Includes requires that you perform a few preparatory
steps beforehand. To alter Apache settings, you must change text in its set-
tings file. The file is named httpd.conf and is located here:
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
You probably won’t be able to find this file if you go searching for it in the
Finder because it’s a hidden file. Some text editors like BBEdit can open
hidden files, but you might not have that on hand. You do have the Terminal
application, though. Launch the Terminal by double-clicking its icon. (You can
find it in the Utility folder that resides in your Applications folder.) Book VII,
Chapter 1 has more information about the Terminal in case you need a
refresher. At the prompt that appears, enter this command:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
You are then nudged to provide a password at the following prompt:
Password:

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
664
When prompted for a password, use a password of an administrator account
on your machine. If you’re the only user, this might be the password of the
user that you’re currently signed in as. Press Return, and you will be looking
at the innards of the Apache setup file. There’s a lot of what I call Programmer
Pig Latin in this file, but don’t be discouraged. Scroll down through the file
(use the arcane UNIX Control+V key sequence) and look for this chunk of text:
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
If you don’t feel like scrolling through a bunch of text, you can jump to the
text by pressing Control+W (shorthand for where), entering the text that
you want to find (for example: Options Indexes FollowSymLinks), and then
pressing Return.
Whenever you find the desired text in the file, add the word Includes to the
end of the last line of this text.
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes
Notice the many pound (#) characters. A pound character denotes a com-
ment: Think of comments as notes to yourself that help you remember what
the heck you were doing at this point in the file. Techno-wizard coders would
say it this way: When a comment character (#) precedes a line, that line of
text performs no function. You can use this to your advantage to turn settings
on and off for the server. Add a pound character to the beginning of a line, and
that function stops working. Remove the character, and the function works
again. Continue scrolling through the httpd.conf file by using the arrow
keys or the Control+W search trick, looking for the following:
# To use server-parsed HTML files
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
Make sure that no # characters precede the AddType and AddHandler lines.
After you finish, press Control+O, press Return to save the file, and then press
Control+X to exit the pico text editor. After you finish editing Apache’s set-
tings, you have to restart it for the changes to take effect. Open the System
Preferences and click the Internet tab. Deactivate Web Sharing and then
reactivate it again.
Next, open your favorite text editor and add some text to a new file:

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
665
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” -->
</body>
</html>
The <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --> part is a Server Side Include. The
server understands the “DATE_LOCAL” message, and in its place, adds text
that displays today’s date. Save the text file and give it the name index.shtml.
Make sure that you include the .shtml extension. It’s important for making
the Server Side Includes work properly.
Save the file in your global Web folder, located here:
/Library/WebServer/documents/index.shtml
Finally, it’s time to check out your handiwork and rest your fingers from all
this typing. Open a Web browser and navigate to the URL of your global Web
folder:
http://127.0.0.1/index.shtml
The result should be a Web page that displays today’s date. (I know, it’s not
particularly material for the Louvre at this point, but I think you can appreci-
ate the possibilities.)
If you’re not content with appending .shtml to your files to take advantage
of Server Side Includes, you need to perform another step. When you view
your Web site with a Web browser, it’s customary to use default pages for a
particular directory. For example, when loading the following URL:
http://127.0.0.1/
the server looks for a default page to load on the server because you didn’t
specify one. This is normally a file named index.html, which causes prob-
lems for Server Side Includes because they require a filename ending with
.shtml. The easiest way to fix this is to tell the server that index.shtml
can also be a default page. To fix this discrepancy, reload the Apache config-
uration file by using this command line:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
666
If you perform this step within 15 minutes of your last sudo command, you
won’t have to re-enter a password. If it’s been longer, you might have to
enter the password — I told you in Chapter 1 of this mini-book that UNIX had
sophisticated security, didn’t I? Then scroll down through the httpd.conf
file and find this bit of text:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.html
</IfModule>
Change it by adding index.shtml to it:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
</IfModule>
Notice that index.shtml precedes index.html. This line indicates which
filenames you can use for the default filename of any folder on the Web
server. In this case, I’m forcing index.shtml as the default filename before
index.html. This means that when you load a Web page from your server
without specifying a specific file, Apache is going to look for a file named
index.shtml in that folder first. If it can’t find one, it looks for a file named
index.html. With that change in place, press Control+O to write the file to
disk and then press Control+X to quit the pico text editor. To see your work
in action, stop and restart Personal Web Sharing on the Sharing pane in
System Preferences; then load this URL with your Web browser:
http://127.0.0.1/
The result should be that your index.shtml page loads with Server Side
Includes intact.
Server Side Includes can perform a few other simple functions besides the
date, including
✦DATE_GMT: Today’s date in Greenwich Mean Time.
✦DATE_LOCAL: Today’s date in your local time zone. (You’re already an
expert with this one.)
✦DOCUMENT_NAME: The name of document.
✦LAST_MODIFIED: The date when this document was last modified.

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
667
To see them all in action, alter your index.shtml file to read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site! <br><br>
GMT date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_GMT” --> <br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Name of this document: <!--#echo var=”DOCUMENT_NAME” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br>
</body>
</html>
Reload your Web server’s main page to see the results.
Fancier dynamic stuff
Another common use of Server Side Includes gives you a chance to remove
whole chunks of your HTML files and put them into another file. (Sounds
messy, doesn’t it?) You might want to do this for HTML that will appear on
each page of your Web site: For example, you might like today’s date and the
page’s last modified date to appear at the bottom of any page of your whole
Web site. Webmasters, being the sedentary, nerd-beast crowd that they are,
don’t want to type this information repeatedly for each HTML page that they
create. Furthermore, they don’t want to have to retype all that information
for every file if it should change. What’s a lazy techno-wizard to do? Server
Side Includes come to the rescue!
The first step is to modify your main page: in this case, index.shtml:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
You might notice that I removed all the Server Side Includes from before and
added a new one. The new line
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
tells the Web server to load the file named footer.shtml and dump its con-
tents into index.shtml in place of this Server Side Include. Save this file.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
668
Next, create a new text file. To the new file, add this code:
<center>
<hr width=”50%”>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br><br>
</center>
If you’re familiar with HTML, the first thing that might strike you is that this
file doesn’t follow proper HTML formatting. Because this file is just a chunk
of HTML that’s going to be part of a fully formed HTML file, it doesn’t need
the full treatment. Otherwise, this code is standard HTML with a few Server
Side Includes tossed in for good measure. Just to spruce things up a bit, the
text is centered with a small horizontal line above it. Save this file, giving it
the name footer.shtml.
Now, whenever you want this footer to be at the bottom of any Web page on
the server, add the <!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”--> line from
before. Besides saving you time from reconstructing the footer each time in
an HTML file, you only have to add one line of code, and Server Side Includes
take care of the rest. Even better, you can alter the footer file whenever you
want, and the changes appear in the HTML of every page that contains the
footer.
When bad things happen to good Webmasters
If you have browsed the Web for any time at all, you’ve no doubt stumbled
across a dead link. This phenomenon occurs when you attempt to load a
Web page that no longer exists on a particular server. If you were lucky and
the server still existed, you probably saw a boring error message telling you
that the page no longer exists. Apache provides default error messages like
this for you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve the messages that
your visitors see — a true power user eschews defaults when creativity
kicks in!
Open your httpd.conf file for editing with pico like before.
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Scroll through the file until you find the ErrorDocument directives.
#    2) local redirects
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
669
Whenever a server can’t find a page, it produces a 404 error — also well
known as “That Damn Screen” to Web surfers around the world. (Please
excuse my clarity there.) In fact, the number 404 has entered popular slang,
meaning dead or broken. Normally, Apache directs itself to a default error
message, but by removing one comment (note the now-absent pound char-
acter at the beginning of the second line), you can specify which file you
would like to display (in the form of a page for the viewer) in the case of a
404 error.
#    2) local redirects
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Press Control+O to save the httpd.conf file and then press Control+X to
exit pico. Now whenever someone comes across a missing Web page on your
site, your server will redirect him to a file named missing.html. Of course,
you also need to create this missing.html file. Use your favorite text editor
to create a new HTML file. To it, add this code:
<html>
<head><title>Uh-oh!</title></head>
<body>
Holy Toledo! <br><br>
We can’t find the page you requested. <br>
Would you like to <a href=”index.shtml”>return to the main page</a>?
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
Save this file, giving it the name missing.html. Save it in your Web server’s
root directory.
/Library/WebServer/Documents/missing.html
Return to the System Preferences Sharing panel, click the Internet tab, and
toggle Web Sharing off and on again. This will force your Web server to read
in the changes to the httpd.conf file.
To test it out, load a URL that you know doesn’t exist. Anything will do.
http://1270.0.0.1/some_missing_page_I_forgot_to_add.html
If you’ve configured things properly, you should see a personalized Web
error page — this way, perhaps your visitor will chuckle instead of curse
when a dead link is encountered.
