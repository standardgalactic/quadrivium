Software Shopping
Software is an area of the computer
market which is nearly always booming
with new  products. At  the moment
there is  a vast choice and everyone
should ﬁnd something to please them
from utilities to the most basic of zapp-
ing games. So let's launch ourselves into
the software supermarket straight away.
Something for Everyone
Those of you who have bought and
enjoyed New Generation games in the
past, will be interested to know that
Virgin Games has now acquired all rights
to New Gen's back catalogue plus the
rights to seven new titles.
No one has yet announced which
Commodore titles are going t o  b e
included in  this new deal o r  given
release dates, however Virgin's Nick
Alexander was very effusive about the
new deal: "I have been a fan of New
Generation's software since my ﬁrst days
in the business when I saw their ZX81
programs at  Mic rofairs. We've both
come a long way since then and I look
forward to further progress."
Chess buffs, always on the look out
for a new way to indulge their regrett-
able addiction, should look  out for
Audiogenic's Grand Master Chess. This
version has now been around for a while
but Audiogenic recently announced
that the C-16 game is now totally com-
patible with the Plus/4. 03.95 is the price
for C-16, Plus/4 and a seperate C64
version.
Quicksilva has  invented a  n e w
character -  Jeremy the punk photo-
grapher. H e  has t o  wander around
snapping new inventions to meet his
editor's photography deadline (sounds
familiar!). Your Commodore's photo-
graphic boys seem to have an easier life
since they  haven't y et had mutant
monsters trying to nick their ﬁlm! took
out for Jeremy in Quicksilva's Hocus
Focus (E8.95) on the C64.
Those who like a bit of recent history
intermingled with their gaming can try
Microprose's Conﬂict in Vietnam war
game. The game features events dating
back to 1954 and features the decisive
battles of la Drang (1965), Khe Sanh
(1968) and Cambodia (1970). There is 110
pages of documentation to keep you
occupied for hours. In the states it sells
for $39.95 so you'll need to be a fairly
dedicated war gamer to afford this one.
Ariolasoft is hoping you'll prefer the
more leisurely pursuit of a few rounds
on the green and try your hand at the
new Golf Construction set. Build your
own golf course or just play around on a
few wor ld famous ones which are
reproduced o n  t he program -  The
Belfry, We n t w o r t h  O l d  Cour s e,
Sunningdale and Royal St George.

STATEMENTS
An added incentive for those who
become really expert is Ariolasoft's mag-
nanimous offer of E500 worth of golf
equipment for the ﬁrst 12 people who
get their handicaps down t o scratch
(zero - to us uninitiated plebs). The disk
version is on sale for £14.95 and a twin
cassette version is priced at 112.95.

Donavan. All you need to do is ﬁnd out

ing their air conditioning.
It's available now and costs a mere
£8.95.
Imminently arriving in  your local
computer s hop is  CRL's new sci-ﬁ
adventure, Tau Ceti. Set on a plague-
devastated earth colony in the middle of
a far ﬂung interstellar galaxy, your role is
that of the intrepid suicidal maniac who
has volunteered to go and repair the
damage defence system of the stricken
planet so that it can be recolonised, The
•

only way to do this is shut down the
massive fusion reactor which fuels the
planet.
If you want to diequickly and often it
might be worth a shot at f9.95.

Work, Work, Busy, Busy
Never a dull moment from Ariolasolt.
This proliﬁc software house has recently
released three new utility programs.
The ﬁrst - Calkit(04.95)- is a toolkit
for solving number problems. It should
help you sort out the mess which is play-
fully termed your ﬁnances. Balance your
cheque book, simplify your income tax
and develop accurate home and busi-
ness budgets. In other words it's a very
simple to use spreadsheet.
If you use your C64 or C128 to run a
business fr om home then perhaps
Ariolasoft's second utility will b e of
interest to you. Entitled B/Graph, it is a
visual presentation t o o l f o r  sales,
marketing, forecasting, accounting,
management and could also have used
for teachers and students. It costs f 29.95
on C64/128 disk.
Last, but not least in the new Ariola-
soft batch of utilities is Paperclip with
Spellpack. I t ' s  a  w o r d  processing
package on CM disk. Ariolasoft claims
that it's timesaving and in addition you'll
produce totally error free documents
because of the 15,000 word dictionary.
This one's for the C64 disk and is priced
at [59.95.
Back t o  s pr eads heets  a n d
Audiogenic's successful Swift spread-
sheet is now available on cassette or
disk. The package includes two copies of
the program. One runs on the CM and
C128 in 64 mode and the other runs on
the 128 and uses the full 128K memory
and 80 column display.
Audiogenic has also imported Turbo
MIRV (Multiple Information Retrieval
Vehicle) from the states. It loads into the
64 or 128 and runs concurrently with
other programs so the user can switch
between the main program and the
desktop functions o f  Turbo MIRV.
Functions include calculator, memo
pad, alarm clock, calendar and auto
dialler.

ful Spec trum t it le  -  Doomdark's
Revenge - for the C64. It is the sequel to
Lords of Midnight and contains 6,144

It's an adventure cum war game set in
a medieval fantasy world. It's a text

that all possible moves can be accomp-
lished by pressing only one key. There's
a free audio cassette with the games
which tells the story of Doomdark with a
musical accompaniment. The price is

sequel to Archon. It's on C64 cassette
and costs £9.95.
There's also a new text adventure
now out from CRL. The game is called
Pilgrim and it's for the C64.
It is  set in  the peaceful land o f

protector of the land. The price is (7.95.

Decline and Fall
IT CAN BE SAFELY SUGGESTED THAT
the h o m e  c omputing industry i s
primarily aimed a t  those w ho play
computer games and those who wish to
develop programming skills and the
usage of their machine. However, there
appears to be a growing contradiction
between these ideas and the content of
available publications.
In response to Allen Webb's letter
(April 86, Your Commodore), I ﬁnd it
increasingly difﬁcult to ﬁnd fault with his
synopsis that t he home computing
market is in decline. Virtually all of the
British home computing magazines,
Your Commodore excepted, offer a
diminishing amount of real interest to
the average key bashing fanatic.
As a n  example, o n e  magazine,
although not speciﬁcally Commodore
orientated, has always been able to offer
a cross section of professional programs
and utilities for the discerning reader.
Unfortunately this format appears to
have been re-directed towards more
advertising, previews and reviews for
hardware and software. Although
understand the need for publication to
advertise, and indeed the value of in-
depth reviews, I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to see
why this mus t b e  achieved at the
expense of  actual programming (the
very basis of home computing). Surely a
lack of programs, hints, utilities etc. will
bring into question the concept of value
for money. Subsequent loss of readers
will inevitably lead to loss of revenue
from advertising until eventually... ?
Although I  have now joined the
ICPUG, I have recently found the need
to purchase American magazines such
as Compute! and RUN to satisfy my
hunger for new ideas and information.
Both o f  these magazines offer good
quality diverse programs whilst still
advertising. T he problems with this
situation are that ﬁrstly, these magazines
are wildly expensive (approx L31 and
secondly, in my heart of hearts I would
much r ather  purchase a n  English
monthly that c an compete, i f  n o t
surpass, the American competition.
As many magazines have either
disappeared or  are on the brink of
oblivion, I shall watch future editions of
Your Commodore with apprehension
and perhaps a little hope. At present I
am generally pleased with the quality of
the magazine and writers such as Allen
Webb c obtinue t o  perpetrate this
quality. Your Commodore appears to
be the last bastion of sensibility for home
computing enthusiasts o r  are there
changes on the way that I should fear?

ONE PROBLEM WHICH THE
vast majority o f  disk drive
owners come across sooner
or later, is the massive con-
fusion which can build up
when y ou realise that you
have large numbers of disks
lying around and you have no
idean what's on any of them.
When it comes to ﬁnding a
speciﬁc ﬁle then the process
is annoying and tedious.
Help is at hand, with this
program -  Disk Base 128. It
will store the contents of up
to 300 disks on ﬁle and help
you ﬁnd what you need.
What It Does
When you run the program.
press 'space' at the title page
to enter the main program.
You will then be faced with 11
icons and a ﬂashing cursor.
To place disk ﬁle-into the
program's memory move the
cursor (using the cursor keys -
left and shift left) over the
Write File ic on and press
return. You will then be asked
for a  ﬁeld number. 1-300.
Select your choice and then
insert t he disk whic h y ou
want to store in memory in
the disk drive. Then, press
Return. T he program w ill
then load the directory and
store it.
When this  is  complete,
press Return to get back to
the menu. The contents of
that dis k  ar e n o w  stored
under t h e  ﬁeld number
which you selected.
You may now repeat the
process as many times as you
12
wish, just increment the ﬁeld
number every time.
If you store the same disk
twice, or you merely wish to
get rid of one which you no
longer need, then you can
delete it by selecting the Erase
File icon. In this case, when
asked whic h ﬁeld number
you wish t o  erase, simply
make your choice and key it
in, press Return and the ﬁle
is then erased.
When you've ﬁnished and
all your disks are in memory,
select the Save File option.
You should then enter the
number of ﬁelds you wish to
save. For instance if you only
have 40 disks in memory in
ﬁelds one to 40, then you can
just save that number of ﬁles,
It's q u ic k e r  a n d  s av es
memory.
Load ﬁles is  simply the
reverse of Erase Files. Select
the Load icon, enter the ﬁeld
limit and ﬁle name and press
Return.
The Scratch icon is so that
you can remove an unwanted
ﬁle f r o m  d is k  w i t h o u t
breaking out of the program.
Select the Scratch icon, press
Return and enter t he ﬁle
name to be erased. It's as easy
as that.
The Directory Icon will get
the directory of a disk and
display it on the screen but it
will not store it in memory, it's
just to check and view disks
without leaving the program.
Select the Dir icon and press
Return, t h e  directory w ill
then load, press space t o
return to the menu.
New dis k  i s  s ell e x -
planatory.
View ﬁles icon will display
the contents and/or titles of
disks in memory. Select View
icon and press Return. Then
you can select TITLES or FILES
by pressing T or F.
When s elec ting t it les
enter the ﬁeld limit you wish
to ex amine (1-XXX). T h e
program will then list all the
titles i n  memory  i n  that
section. Press Retur n t o
return.
Whtn selecting Files enter
the ﬁeld number you wish to
look at and press space, that
will then be displayed to you.
Press space to return.
If you know you've got a
ﬁle somewhere b u t  c an't
seem to ﬁnd it select the Find
File Icon and press Return.
You will then be asked what
ﬁle you're looking for. Enter
the title and press Return. The
program will then search the
ﬁelds and lis t any  whic h
contain your lost ﬁle. Press to
return.
Print ﬁles will list to the
printer the title and contents
of a  ﬁeld o f  your choice.
Select the icon, press Return
and enter  t h e  ﬁeld y o u
require to be printed.
The icons available to you
(from left to right) are:
Write File, Erase File, Save
Files, Load Files, Scratch ﬁle,

Disk, End Program, Print File.
End ﬁle takes you back to the
title page, t h e  dis k s  i n
memory will not be lost.

[Stuart Cooke takes a look at
a sub £50 printer.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING
with your computer there will be a time
when you will need to get some sort of
printout. If you are writing your own
programs then you will need to get a
printout so that you can check it through
carefully as you develop it. If on the
other hand you are copying a listing,
such as one from Your Commodore,
then errors are bound to creep in and it
is much easier to check the magazine
listing against a printout than it is against
your TV set.
However, t h e r e  i s  o n e  s mall
problem. cost. Nearly all printers are
well over the f100 mark, in fact it is very
difﬁcult to ﬁnd a printer that is under
1200. Well don't worry, Spectrum, a
company that has a retailer in just about
every high street, is importing a printer
that is set to change this.
The printer that Spectrum is selling is
manufactured in Japan by Citizen. It is
designed to be completely compatible
with the Commodore range of home
computers. So much so that they have
even made the case a similar colour to
that of the C64. The price of this printer
is just [49.99.
Obviously there are bound to be
some corners cut with a price like this.
Well there are. for a start the printer will
only use roll paper that is 80mm in width.
This is very easy to obtain as it is the size
of paper used b y  many desk t o p
calculators. Secondly the printer will
only print a maximum of 40 characters
per line. A n  example printout i s
included (full size) with this article so
that you can judge for yourself the actual
quality of the print. My feeling is that the
manufacturers claim that the printer
'Expands your Commodore into a word
and data processing system' is a little
wide of the mark. I couldn't see myself
sending business letters out on paper
that is only 2
does work well and if you don't already
own a  printer then it  is well worth
looking at. In fact a second printer of this
quality is quite often useful t o have
around for producing quick directory
listings etc.
Even though the printer does have a
few 'faults' it has a surprising number of
points in its favour. The printer measures
only 240mm by 176mm. This means that
it takes up very little room, in fact the
review model is  sat o n  t op o f  my
monitor.
Even though it is small and cheap it
also has a large number of commands
available. A l l  Commodore graphic
characters can be printed so there are no
problems reading listings. Some printers
totally ignore the Commodore graphic
codes. It is possi ble to print out listings in
lower case mode as well as in graphics
mode. It is also possible to produce user
deﬁned graphics on the printer.

Enhanced printing is also catered for
and one unusual feature is the fact that
the ribbon is both black and red. Unfor-
tunately you can only use one colour per
line. Even so this is extremely useful for
highlighting text.
Even t h o u g h  q u i t e  a  b i t  o f
comparability is there, there are many
programs that will not work correctly
with this printer. You should be OK with
a program that simply produces listings
but if any graphics are printed you may
get into problems. This is because most
programs that print graphics or perform
screen dumps assume a printer width of
80 characters.
16
Even so it is very difﬁcult to complain
at a printer that offers quite a large
amount o f  compatibility w it h y our
Commodore computer at a very low
price.
If you could with a printer but until
now thought that the price was putting
you off, take a look at this one.

TIGRESS MARKETING ARE VERY PROUD
of the latest addition to their ventures.
Released through Ariolasoft, the Golf
Construction Set should prove to be the
ultimate in computer golf simulation
until laser disk games appear.
Whether you're a golﬁng pro or a
rank amateur, this package has every-
thing to recommend it. A full bag of
clubs selected by yourself, a range of
skills and techniques plus several world
famous courses to play on.
Wentworth, Sun ningdale, the Belfry
and St Georges are all supplied initially
and Ariolasoft promise more courses to
follow in the future. The construction kit
is so detailed that it  is possible to
recreate the special features of each
course from the claustrophobic wooded
appearance o f  Sunningdale t o  t he
numerous water hazards of the wet-look
Belfry.
Golﬁng competitions t ake t w o
forms: Match Play and Competition.
Competition is the familiar game
where the player who holes out on the
eighteenth green in the fewest number
of strokes i s t h e winner. I n  this
simulation u p  t o  four players can
compete.
Match Play is a two player game and
each hole is either won, lost of halved.
This means that the winner is the ﬁrst
person to win 10 holes and the re-
maining holes a re  lef t  unplayed.
Normally, a drawn match is played on
from the ﬁrst tee until a two hole lead is
established by one of the players but this
is not possible in this simulation so a
drawn match can occur.
As each new hole is played It is
loaded from tape to disk. Fortunately
this can be described as the normal
delay caused by the players walking
from green to tee. As the game starts this
is hinted at by the legend 'Walking to the
ﬁrst tee' emblazoned across the screen
as the rest of the game loads after the
initial option screens.
A lull complement of clubs cannot
be carried so three must be selected for
omission at the start of the game. Playing
a shot involves several further decisions.
The screen design is there to assist your
judgement. The top left quadrant of the
screen shows the view towards the tee in
3D. Under this is a panel which gives all
the vital statistics of the hole and the
weather and turf conditions. The right
half of the screen shows the plan view of
the hole.
Weather and turf conditions affect
the length of shot which can be played.
Wind direction dictates a  particular
extra force on the ball, warm air slows

the ball less than cold air, rain has a
similar effect and the dryness of the turf
affects bounce and distance.
Taking all of these factors into con-
sideration your club is chosen and the
direction of the shot is determined by
moving a cross in the direction of play.
At this point the extremely clever nature
of the 3D display becomes obvious. Each
time you reposition the cross the view is
redrawn. In this way a very realistic view
is created.
Next the amount of loft and fade is
selected. Loft determines whether the
ball will ﬂy high or skim across the grass.
Fade causes the ball's trajectory to bend
in a deliberate way unlike slicing or
hooking which are caused by incorrect
handling of the club.
The ﬁnal decision is the actual stroke.
A small golfer appears at the bottom of
the n o w  cleared tex t screen a n d
proceeds t o take swings at the ball.
Pressing t h e  ﬁr e  but t on o n o  the
backswing causes the golfer to hit the
ball fr om his  current position. The
higher his backswing the harder the ball
is hit.
If the ball lands in an unplayable
position you have the option at the start
of each stroke selection sequence to
move back t o  y our balls  previous
position. end the game or  proceed
immediately to the next hole.
On reaching a distance within a few
yards of the ﬂag, the 3D screen gives way
to a large scale plan view of the green
showing t he vertical and horizontal
components of the slope of the ground.
Allowing for the roll which thisslope will
cause, you place your targeting cross
and swing. If you manage to hole out
before reaching this plan view you are
treated to a slow-motion, action replay
of your shot.
As in the real game each player has a
handicap. Starting as a  novice your
handicap is 28 and you must prove your
worth as your play each round. The
handicap is designed to smooth out the
differences between professionals and
amateurs. At the end of a Competition
g a m e
the total number of strokes taken and
this gives your ﬁnal score. If this value
minus the total par for the course is less
than your handicap value,a new grading
is generated and this lower handicap can
be saved to tape or disk.
In Match Play each hole is allotted
difﬁculty level in comparison with the
other holes. This means that each course
has a fully nominated scale of one to 18,
each hole having a unique value. This is
taken into account in conjunction with
your handicap when deciding which
player has won.
The construction section is very easy
to us e i f  the correct procedure is
followed. After choosing the par value
for the hole, the tee and ﬂag are placed
using a joystick and a screen readout of
the distance between them.
Next the boundary line is drawn and
then the elements of the course can be
added. The choice is made via two icon
menus., one for the size of object and the
other for the type. The types available
are water, bunker, green, fairway,
rough, woodland or  scrub. The size
gauges are roughly circular but range
from about four characters in area to
almost pixel size so most shapes can be
created.
After entering the relative slope on
the course and the stroke index, the
hole is complete.
I loved this game and I know that the
Chairman and the Pro at Wentworth feel
the same way about it. If this is still not
recommendation enough then just try
the game. few will be able to resist its
immense appeal.

Like everyone that has had the pleasure of seeing this system in
operation you will be amazed by both the speed and ease of
use. It is compatible with the majority of commercial software.
speeding up both the program loading and SEO/REL ﬁles.
Fitting requires the insertion of two sub assembly boards. one
in the 1541 and one in the -
entail soldering. although a small amount will be necessary
with some machines.

Get more details from your I
'disks with this routine fronil
L. Jones.
DISK DIRECTORIES O N A  C64 CAN
only be described as a pain. Unless you
have a utility program that will display a
directory on your screen the only way of
ﬁnding what is on your disk is by loading
the direc tory i n t o  t h e  computer.
Obviously this erases the program that
was already in there. Hence the need for
a program such as this.
The machine code section of this
program (DIRECT.CODE) consists o f
three small routines.
From C000 to COA9 is a routine that
will dis play  t h e  direc tory . O n c e
DIRECT.CODE is stored in your C64 then
the command SYS 49152 will display the
directory of  any disk t o the screen.
Leaving your program intact.
At COAA to COE0 is a routine that is
used for ﬁnding the end address of a
program. At COE1 to COF9 is a small
relocatable routine that produces a
striped border effect.
Detailed Dir is a program that was
written around these three routines to
provide a very useful disk utility.
Firstly you can get a listing of any disk
on either the screen or printer. If you are
using the printer then you have the
option of printing on the right hand side
of the paper. As you are no doubt aware
directories only ﬁll up half the width of a
standard piec e o f  paper. Wit h this
program you can feed the paper back
into the printer and use the other half.
Secondly the program can also give
the following information:
Disk Header.
Track No and Sector No where program
is stored.
Number of blocks a program uses.
Program name.
Program start address.
Program end address+1.
If you wish to use any of the machine
code routines in your own programs
then careful study o f  Detailed D ir
should show you how to use them.
Getting It In
1
Detailed Dir is a Basic program so you
should have no problems typing it in.
DIRECT.CODE is a Basic loader for
the machine code Type this in as a
normal program and SAVE it in case you
should have made any errors.
Now RUN DIRECT.CODE and if all is
well you should be asked t o 'PRESS

IN THIS ARTICLE I SHALL BE
concentrating on setting up
and using split screens. These
are extremely useful in a wide
range of games and have the
distinct advantage of making
available extra memory within
the machine and are based on
raster interrupts.
Raster Interrupts
The one type of interrupt not
discussed last month was the
raster interrupt. In order to
explain h o w  t o  use raster
interrupts I  had better ﬁrst
explain what they arel Rasters
basically relate to the screen
picture sent by the C-16 to the
TV. As the computer outputs
the screen signals t o  t h e
television it scans from the
top o f  t h e  screen t o  the
bottom, 50 times a second.
Therefore each pixel line that
is generated (there are eight
pixel lines in each character
line of text) is called a raster
line. There are, therefore,
25x8=200 raster lines for  a
screen. The border uses a
further 111 lines at the top
and bottom o f  the screen
display for the PAL colour
television system as used in
the UK. O n  the American
NTSC system there are only 61
raster lines for the border.
The two memory locations
SFF28 and SFF1C (65308 and
65309 decimal) are the vertical
raster count registers. These
two bytes can be read to ﬁnd
which raster line is currently
being displayed. A s  t h e
picture is displayed from top
to bottom, these registers
increment from zero to 311
(or 261 for the NTSC system).
before going back t o  zero
again for the next frame.
Bit zero of address $FF1C
(65308 decimal) contains the
highest b i t  o f  t h e  raster
compare register and address
SFF1D (65309) contains the
lower eight bits. Also, address
SIF1E ( 65310 d e c im a l)
contains the upper eight bits
of the nine bit horizontal
raster position register. This
increments so fast that its only
real use to the programmer is
to generate random numbers.
Figure 1  shows a  short
machine code program t o

Lines 10100-10170 then set the

screen. Lines  10250-10270
then set the background and
border t o  white —  it then
goes round again. The result
is a two colour screen. Figure
2 shows this listing as code in
case you don't have my C-16
Assembler w h i c h  w a s
published in  the tune 1985
edition of Your Commodore.
Right, so now we have
looked at what rasters are,
let's start think ing about
raster interrupts.
Addresses S U M  a n d
SFFOB (65290 a n d  -65291
decimal) contain the nine bits
of t h e  r as ter  c ompar e
register. Address SFFOB holds
the lower eight bits, and bit
zero of address SFICIA holds
the most signiﬁcant bit. The
remaining bits of SFFOA hold
the interrupt mask register,so
be careful not to alter any of
these when changing zero.
When the raster line count
in registers SFF1C and SITIO
equals the value in the raster
compare register, bit one of
the interrupt status register at
SFF09 is set (see my interrupts
article). I f  bit  zero o f  the
interrupt enable register
(SFF OA) i s  a ls o  s et, a n
interrupt is  generated. As
explained i n  m y  previous
article addresses $0314 and
$0315 (88 and 89 decimal)
hold t h e  address o f  t h e
interrupt vector whic h i s
usually SCEOE, but can b e
altered to go to a user routine.
Therefore by  setting bit
one o f  the interrupt mask
register, setting t h e  raster
compare registers to the line
where you wish to interrupt.
and redirecting the interrupt
vector y ou should get a n
interrupt —  right? Well, it's
not so simple unfortunately,
because the C-16 also uses the
raster interrupt itself all the
time for its own split screen
routines for graphics modes
two and four. Unfortunately
these routines are also active
in a l l  - the other  graphics
modes and c an never b e
turned off.
So why not change the
machine's ex is ting s p lit
screen routines to create your
own interrupts  a n d  s plit
screens? Well, you can't. In
fact you can't even change
the line at which the screen
splits. Therefore t o  create
your own raster interrupts,
split screens etc., you have to
write it all yourself, including
some of the interrupt service
routines, because these also
mess about w ith t he split
screen.
So is it all worth the effort?
The answer is  'yes'. Split
screens are more useful for
the C-16 than just about any
other computer due t o  its
limited memory capacity.. At
present w h e n  t h e  high-
resolution mode is selected, a
huge 10.3 Kbyte portion of
the 12.3 Kby te maximum
available memory is used up
leaving you with a couple of
thousand bytes in which you
24
can do very little. However if
you split the screen and use
say 15 of the 25 available high-
resolution character lines.
leaving the remaining 10 in
low-resolution mode, y ou
can save 3200 bytes in the
high-res screen space plus
another 400 bytes i n  t h e
luminance and 400 bytes in
the chrominance tables. We
also gain another 600 bytes in
the low- r es  s c reen a n d
another 600 bytes in the low-
res colours giving a total of
3200+400+400+600
bytes saved. -
total o f  7245 bytes fr ee
compared with the original
2045. Admittedly this memory
is scattered all over the place,
but this  is  n o t  a  serious
problem for  machine code
programs. There will be much
more a b o u t  u s i n g  t h e
additional space in a future
article. For now just bear in
mind that it is possible to have
three and a half times as much
memory w h e n  i n  hi- r es
mode.
Split Screen Routine
Figure 3 shows the assembly
listing f o r  the split screen
routine. Figure 4 shows the
code for  t he split screen.
Enter Figure 4  instead o f
Figure 3 if you don't have the
C-16 Assembler. In Figure 4
lines 10000-10020 load the
machine code. The routine is
stored in an unused area of
memory a t  $0600 (1536
decimal) and is around 200
bytes long.
I have included a table
which is a breakdown of the
system variables used in the
split screen program:

F
Note that the position of
the splits must follow in order
down t he screen, i.e. t he
raster line for the second split
must be greater than that for
the ﬁrst split. The raster lines
for the screen start at one at
the top of the screen and go
down to 202 at the bottom.
Although the screen has only
200 raster lines and therefore
in theory the last line of the
screen should be (200+1S, for
some reason the lines end at
202. Also, i f  y ou need an
interrupt right at the top of
the screen it is better to set
the raster line to zero instead
of one as the change will take
place off the screen avoiding
any ﬂicker, To avoid ﬂicker
and attribute difﬁculties, the
raster line number for  the
split should be set from the
following equation:
Raster line no, = (Character
line)+8 + 1
Note that the character line
can be from zero to 24, The
equation makes the screen
split at the bottom of  the
character line; ﬂicker c an
occur if the raster line is set to
the middle of the character
line.
Assembly Listing
Lines 10100-10290 — turn on
the split screen, altering the
position of the interrupt to
S0630. They also 'enable' the
raster interrupts and sets the
raster compare register up to
the ﬁrst split.
Lines 10300-10380 — turn off
the split screen system by
redirecting the interrupt to
the ROM service routine.
Lines 11000-11520 — contain
the interrupt service routine.
This routine, mainly adapted
from t h e  C- 16's  R O M ,
contains a l l  t h e  c o d e
necessary to make it read the
keyboard, update the clock,
etc. Note that it is not possible
in this case to use the C-16's
own ROM routines because
these would r uin the split
screen.
Lines 11050-11080 — perform
a split if the interrupt was a
raster interrupt.
Lines 11100-11170 -
all the RS232 interrupts used
in operating printers, disk
drives, etc.
Lines 11170-11280 — turn off
the 'raster interrupt' ﬂag in
the raster status register if
there was a raster interrupt
and also set the new split
line position i n  the raster
compare register.
Lines 11290-11310 —  decide
whether it is a new 1/50th of a
second and if it is (i.e. if the
next split is  the top split),
update- the clock, read the
keyboard a n d  inc r ement
sound duration registers in
the routine at lines 11400-
11520. I f  it is not however,
they jump to the IRQ 'exit'
ROM routine in line 11350.
Lines 12000-12090 — perform
a split. This routine interrupts
the D a t a  b y t e  i n t o  i t s
appropriate instrtictions.
Because all screen changes
must b e  done at once, it
pushes the numbers t o be
changed into registers X and Y
and stores a ll t h e  values
toward t h e  e n d  o f  t h e
routine, at lines 12500-12560.
Lines 12100-12110 —fetch the
data byte.
Lines 12120-12180 —deal with
the ' T E D  fetc hes  f r o m
RAM/ROM' bit, altering bit 2
of address SFF12.
Lines 1 2 1 8 2 -1 2 1 9 4
the 'position o f  the video
matrix' bit  b y  setting byte
SFF15 to 8 for low-res or with
the position of the start of the
luminance table (stored i n
address $07FB for a high-res
screen).
25
Lines 12200-12260 — deal with
the '24/25 line screen', the
'bit-map' m o d e  a n d  t h e
'ex tended b a c k g r o u n d
c
bits 3,5 and 6 of register SFF06
accordingly.
Lines 12300-12390 —
the '38/40 column screen' bit
by altering bits 3 and 4 of
register SFF07 accordingly.
Lines 12500-12560 — store all
these values virtually simul-
taneously t o reduce ﬂicker
between splits.
Lines 12600-12700 —  move
the split position counter on 1
to the next split,or back to the
beginning if the end of the
split table is reached.
Data Bytes
The data byte for each split
contains all the information
about the window below it.
For example if you want a
screen split in the middle with
the top half in high-res and
the bottom in low-res, set the
date byte for a split at the top
of the screen for high-res, and
the data byte for the a split
half way down for low-res.
Here is how the bits of the
data byte are arranged;
Bit 0: 38/40 Column Screen: 0
for 38 columns and 1 for 40
columns. This  i s  us ed i n
smooth scrolling and will be
explained in a later article.
Bit 1: Multicolour Mode: 0
for mode OFF and 1 for mode
ON.
Bit 2 :  TED Fetches f r o m
RO M/RAM, I n  lo w - r e s
normal mode and character
set is contained in ROM, so
TED (the text editor device in
the C-16) therefore fetches
information from ROM. In
programmable c harac ter
mode (see my article in the
November 1985 issue) t h e
character set is in RAM, so
TED therefore fetches from
RAM. In high-res mode also
TED fetches from RAM. The
bit is 0 for 'TED fetchs from
RAM' and 1 for 'TED fetches
from ROM'.
Bit 3: 24/25 Line Screen. This
is als o us ed i n  s mooth
scrolling. 24 line mode cuts
off half a character line from
the top and half a character
line from the bottom of the
screen ( t h e  actual v is ible
effect depends on where the
window below the split is. If
the window is in the middle of
the screen only. this bit will
have no effect at all).
The bit is 0 for 24 lines and 1
for 25 lines.
Bit 4: not used.
Bit 5: Bit Mapped (high-res
mode). The bit is 0 for OFF
(for low-res screen) and 1 for
ON (for high-res screen).
Bit 6: Extended Background
Colour Mode (we my article
in the March 1986 issue of
Your Commodore). The bit is
0 for OFF and 1 for ON.
Bit 7 :  Position o f  V i de o
Matrix. 0 sets the video matrix
address to 2048 for low-res
mode, 1 sets the address to
the start o f  the luminance
table f o r  high-  resm o d e .
Therefore the bit is 0 for low-
res and 1 for high-res.
For example t o  s et a
normal low-res screen bits 0,2
and 3 should be set, the rest of
the bits  should b e  reset.
Therefore t h e  data b y t e
would be 1+4+8=13=SOD. For
a standard high-res screen
(non-multicolour) t h e  by te
should b e  128+32+8+1=169
=SA9.
Operating
Instructions
To turn on the split screen
routine type: SYS 1536.
To turn off the split screen
routine type: SYS 1568.
Then to set up a simple
split screen with the top half
of the screen in high-res and
the bottom half in low-res:
POKE 209,4 — for (2 splits x 2)
POKE 210,0 — split at top of
the screen
POKE 211,169 — data byte for
1st high-res split
POKE 212,97 — for a split at
the 12th line
POKE 213,13 — data byte for
2nd split (low-res)
SYS 1536 — turn it ON.
The GRAPHIC commands
do not have an effect an
more, but serve their purpose
in specifying which window
we are using in Basic. E.g.
GRAPHIC 0 speciﬁes low-res,
GRAPHIC 1 speciﬁes high-res
and GRAPHIC 3  speciﬁes
high-res multicolour mode.
Also t o  clear a  particular
screen put a one after the end
of the GRAPHIC command.
For instance, i f  y ou have
entered the above commands
in y o u  s hould n o w  s ee
rubbish on the top half of the
screen. Type GRAPHIC 1.1
and the top high-res window
will clear. Note that either
GRAPHIC 2,1 or GRAPHIC 4,1
clears both the low and the

1
high resolution screens
simultaneously.
Now type CIRCLE,150,45,
45 (don't forget the initial
comma) to draw a circle in the
high-res window.
Then type PAINT,150,45,
to ﬁll the circle in.
Finally type SYS 1568 to get
back to normal.
The a b o v e  exam p le
should have given you some
ideas on how t o use split
screens, but does not convey
much of the power of these
routines. Figure 5  lists a
demonstration program
which is designed to show up
to four screens in action.
Datamaka
The follow ing ro u t in e,
although not having much to
do with split screens, is an
important u t ilit y w h en
dealing with machine code
and data. This routine was
used when I printed the code
in this and the previous two
installments of Programming
the C-16. Basically it turns a
given block of code into DATA
statements with the option of
a checksurn at the end of each
line. This program greatly
reduces the amount of time
you spend turning your
machine code games etc. into
data so that you can send
them to Your Commodore!
Figure 6  shows t h e
DATAMAKA program. When
the program is RUN enter the
START ADDRESS and END
ADDRESS o f  the code in
response t o the questions.
Next enter the starting Basic
line number of the block of
DATA statements in response
to LINE NUMBER ? and the
step between line numbers in
response to STEP FOR LINE
NUMBERS ? Lastly enter "Y"
or " N "  i n  response t o
CHECKSUM(Y/N)? depend-
ing on whether you want a
checksum (sum o f  all the
numbers in a line and a useful
check) at the end of each line.
The program then goes off
and constructs t h e DATA
statements. Note that it ends
the last line with a '-1'.
In setting up the DATA
statements one or two tricks
are u sed ,  n o t ab ly t h e
automatic execution of the
lines putting t h em in t o
memory once every ﬁve data
statements h a v e  b e e n
displayed on the screen. This
is d o n e  b y  PO K Ei n g
characters into the keyboard
buffer so that, when the end
of line 15100 is reached,
commands are stored in the
keyboard buffer to make it
enter t h ese lin es i n t o
memory. The actual charac-
ters are a HOME directing the
cursor t o  the lo p  o f  the
screen, followed by six ENTER
instructions. The number of
characters in the keyboard
buffer is POKEd into the
'index t o keyboard queue'
register at address 239 in line
15100.
The o t h er interesting
technique employed is the
way the program is restarted
automatically t o  continue
DATAMAKAing. Every time a
new DATA line is ENTERed
into memory the computer
wipes all the variables, so all
the information o n  e n d
addresses etc. i s lost. T o
overcome this a line is printed
on the screen (by line 15030)
that records all the variables
in the form of commands, for
instance, S=15020:P=1000:
and so on at the end of each
group o f  ﬁve DATA lines
followed by a GOTO 15010.
When the C-16 executes this
line all t h e variables are
restored and the program
continues execution.
The variable A in line 1000
should b e set t o the start
address o f  the code. Line
10020 checks the sum of the
numbers in each line with the
checksum value and if they
do not 5gree the program
exits with DATA ERROR IN'
followed b y the offending
line number. This program
line should be changed to
10020 LOOP and line 10010
should change to
10010 POKE A,D:ArA+1
if the checksum mode was
not speciﬁed when the data
was generated. To put this
program at the start of the
data and delete the rest of
DATAMAKA delete line 500
then type DELETE 15000-
15100.
Well, that concludes this
month's article, I  hope it
provided s o m e  u sef u l
routines and some food for
thought. Next time I shall be
applying this an d  ot her
routines t o  creating extra
memory o n  the C-16 and
showing how to have 4K for
Basic in high-res mode and
still have untouched high-res
and l o w - r e s  screen s.

has collided with another, but
not which one it has collided
with. This is line for games

most games this will riot
sufﬁce. For this reason I have
detected c o llis io n s  b y
comparing the X and Y co-
ordinates of the Frog and the
other characters.
'ROADCHK' is  the ﬁrst
routine t o b e called. This
checks if the Frog issitting in a
puddle. The code from the
start to fCHKir is used to
ascertain that t he Frog is
sitting down. To check this
the current sprite deﬁnition is
found — if this is equal to 200
then t h e  co-ordinates ar e
checked.
To s e e  w h e t h e r  t h e
characters underneath him
are puddle ones, we must ﬁrst
ﬁnd t h e  position o f  t h e
relevant characters. Remem-
ber that the ﬁrst visible sprite
X co-ordinate is 31 and that
the fr og graphics start 1 7
pixels into ihe front sprite we
must subtract 48 from the x
position. I f  w e divide this
value by eight (the width of
one character in pixels) then
we have t h e X  character
position of the Frog.
'1_00P31' checks to see if
the next seven characters are
puddles or not,and if they are
we go t o 'GOTIT'. At  this
point we decrease the delay
'RDDEDEL' t o  reduce t h e
damage s u s t a in e d  f o r
each contact, then if this has
reached zero we reduce the
'FOOD' left.
•BIKECHK' is a very simple
c hec k . W e  t a k e  t h e
Frenchman's position, add 48,
and store this in SAC. If the
frog's X position is less than
this, he is dead.
'FLYCHK' f o llo w s  t h e
same comparisons, with the
addition that the Frog must
be jumping, and if a collision
takes place, the Fly's position
is reset to the start again.
'SVARS' transfers t h e
variable block to the end of
the program in order that they
can be retrieved at the start of
a new game. 'RVARS' does
exactly the opposite, and is
called in 'FINAL' to reset all
variables t o  their original
values.
The ﬁn a l  r o u t i n e  i s
'BRDCHK' which operates in
the same way as 'FLYCHK'.
Next month — frills.

your computer.
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM
is tor use on ﬁles saved whilst
using T elc om 6 4  ( Your
Commodore, Ap r il- Ma y
1986). I t  provides a n easy
means o f  e d i t i n g  a n d
changing a  ﬁle w it h  t h e
choice t o  resave w it h  a
different, and perhaps, more
appropriate name.
All t h e  func tions  a r e
available via the main menu
(Figure 1) and perform the
following tasks.
View File
This is a copy of the view ﬁle
function found in Telcom 64.
It allows the ﬁle to be viewed
on the screen.
Use the space bar to pause
the display and run-stop to
exit back to the menu.
Edit File
This function gives access to
the ﬁle (assuming one has
been loaded in) and allows
changes to be made.
For ex ample, a  ﬁl e
downloaded from a bulletin
board could perhaps contain
two pictures: (1) Snoopy, (2)
pinup (see Figure 4).
Using the cursor left/right
keys you can step through the
ﬁle. To step through at high
speed c ur s or  u p / d o w n
should be used as this steps in
blocks of 255 bytes instead of
single ones.
Delete a n d  insert keys
work the same as normal
(although slower), however,
for large deletes, Fl and 12
come into there own.
When the start of delete
position is reached Press Et
"Delete from xxx" appears on
the screen (where x x x  =
current position). Now step
through to the end of delete
position and Press 12. The
portion between pressing Fl
and 12 is now deleted and the
ﬁle is viewed from the point
where 11 was ﬁrst pressed.
If an error was made when
El was pressed i t  can b e
repressed to give a new start
position .F2 selection is ﬁnal
and cannot be changed.

Run-stop will place an end
of ﬁle marker (chequered
ﬂag) at the position above the
arrow, this point cannot be
passed until it is over written
with a space or charactor.
Shifted run-stop will exit
to the menu. Pressing any
valid key will overwrite the
original character above the
arrow and then step on to the
next.
Remember in this section
an up arrow (t) denotes a
return and can affect both the
printout and vievvﬁle displays.
File Length
Displays t h e current ﬁle's
st art /en d  a d d re s s  i n
decimal/hex and the number
of spare bytes available
should you wish to type in
more details.
Load File
Fairly obvious this one, but it
should be noted that only one
error message is displayed for
both disk and tape regardless
of t h e actual error. I t  is
"ERROR LOAD/SAVE" and
could be any fault from 'ﬁle
not found' on disk to the tape
stop key being pressed on
tape player.
The ﬁlename must b e
known, although t h e ﬁle
symbol will be placed in front
automatically as it is in Telcom
64.
Save File
This will resave the current
ﬁle up to the chequered end
of ﬁle marker. Any alterations
made in edit mode (option
two) will be saved and the
length of ﬁle can be made
longer or shorter by moving
the end of ﬁle market. This
allows one log ﬁle to be split
into shorter ones with only
the required information left
in them.
Hex to Basic
If a  h e x  ﬁl e  has b een
downloaded (Figure 2 )  i t
should be edited so that the
ﬁrst digit is at current position
zero. An end of ﬁle marker
should be placed at the end of
the hex.
By selecting option six, the
hex will b e  converted t o
ASCII and placed at  2048
onwards to build up a Basic
program i n  memory. O n

completion the program exits
to Basic and the new program
can b e  listed o r  saved as
normal.
Print File
This is an option to print out
the new edited ﬁle for a hard
copy. Again no check is made
to see if the device is present.
A choice of printer is given
when t h e  program is  ﬁrst
started up.
Exit to Basic
This one speaks f o r  itself.
Restart FILE EDITOR w it h
SYS49152.
Loader
For people using an 801/803
printer, only lines 10 and 50
are needed.1520 users should
enter t h e  o t h e r  l i n e s
depending on their require-
ments. The option of device
four for 1520 is only for those
with the modiﬁed 1520.

Note
The screen layouts shown in
Figure 3 and 3A will both give
the same result on screen.
However, when viewed, the
difference is quite consider-
able. In Figure 3 there are 15
spaces e a c h  s i d e  o f
'WELCOME TO' then another
15 to 'TELCOM 64' giving a
total of 65 bytes. In Fig 3A the
ﬁle only  has Si bytes as a
return has been placed after
the 'TO' which causes the
cursor to return to the start of
the next line.
As already mentioned this
will differ between different
boards and viewing the ﬁle is
the only way to know which
method is being used.

Joe Bradley delves
into the Plus/4's
memory and looks at
machine code
programs.
MANY NEWCOMERS T O
computing may have bought a
Plus/4 and have been dis -
appointed that very few articles
have been written f o r  this
machine. This article is  for
those new  enthusiasts w h o
wish to look into the machine
and start writing machine code
routines.
There is some difﬁculty in
°Wining a full memory map
for the Plus/4 but this article is
intended to help in making a
start_
First let us have a look at the
different sections o f  th e
memory -  owners of a Plus/4
are fortunate here because the
computer contains an inbuilt
monitor which will help.
If you wish to write machine
code r outines  y o u  m u s t
become familiar with the way
the monitor works and the
different commands that are
available.
The computer contains two
different types o f  memory
location, those that you can
change, called Random Access
Memory or RAM, and memory
locations that are Read Only
Memory or  ROM, these are
used by the operating system
and cannot be altered.
Switch on your Plus/4 and
type:
MONITOR 'RETURN]
the computer will respond with
MONITOR
PC SR AC XR YR SP
FFIF 00 FF FF FF F9
or something similar.
The abbreviations are:
Now type;
M0000 003F [RETURN]
If a question mark is printed
you have made an error in
entry, probably you have typed
letter 0  instead of a 0 (Zero
number).
lithe entry was correct you
will see displayed eight rows of
numbers t h e s e  a r e  t h e
numbers stored in the memory
locations 0000 to 003F. Note
addresses are usually given in
Hexadecimal c o d e  w h ic h
counts in, units, 16s, 256s and
4096s. Thus 003F is 3 X 16 and
another is 15 i.e. 63 in normal
decimal numbers.
Each location can hold a
number from zero to 255 this is
called a byte and is made up of
eight binary 'bits' which can be

either z er o o r  one. Mo r e
details of this may be read in
any book of machine code.
The block on the extreme
right in  reverse print is  the
ASCII dump of the code if it is
possible to be printed. When a
character cannot be printed it
is displayed as a full stop (.).
The highest address that can
be read by  the processor is
5FEFF. The dollar sign shows
that this  i s  a  hexadecimal
number and is equal to (15 X
4096) + (15 X 256) + (15 X 16) + 15.
In decimal this works out as 64
X 1024 which is almost 64,000
and is the reason most early
computers wer e limited t o
64K (approximately).

when HIRES is being used,
All the locations from 0000
to 003F which are on the screen
are RAM locations that you can
change but only with care! The
ﬁrst 4K (actually 4 X 1024) bytes
of memory are used by  the
operating system and problems
can arise if you can change the
value_ Let's examine this in
more detail.
Locations 002B and 002C (43
and 44 decimal) are pointers to
the start of Basic. To ﬁnd their
values, read down the left hand
side numbers to 0028 and then
move right counting 8,9, A, B.
C. The $2B and $2C locations
should contain the values of 01
10. If you have not written any
machine code then this is your
ﬁrst surprise in that addresses
are always s tor ed i n  t h e
computer in what appears to
be the wrong order, what is
called the lo  (Low) byte ﬁrst
and then the Hi (High) byte.
The pointers tell us that the
current start to a Basic program
is $1001.
Now let us try to alter these
values. Move the cursor over
the 01 a t  location $38 and
change i t  t o  0 6 ,  Pr es s
'RETURN]. The value will now
be changed and when w e
return to Basic the computer
will take $1006 to be the start of
Bd Sir.
Return to Basic by typing a
letter X and then [RETURN].
The computer prints READY
and everything look s  O K.
However, enter a Basic line,
say:
1 PRINT [RETURN]
Your screen will go haywire
and nothing you do with the
keyboard w i l l  b r in g  bac k
control. We say the computer
has hung. Now we see another
advantage of the Plus/4 over
many other computers, it has a
RESET key. This key is at the side
next to the ON/OFF switch.
Press this small button and the
computer will be reset without
switching off. Later when you
are developing machine code
routines your computer may
sometimes hang but you will be
able t o  keep your programs
intact if  you hold down the
RUN/STOP key while you press
the RESET button. ( A  very
valuable feature which you will
learn to treasure).
Your computer is now reset
and you now know that some
parts of RAM cannot be altered
without t h o u g h t !  A s  y o u
develop your machine code
expertise y ou w ill need t o
know which locations you can
use without dire consequen-
ces. The abbreviated table of
memory locations from 0000 to
50EFF shows some that I have
found useful, a safe rule is to
restore the original value after
use.
Consecutive locations i n
the region $0000 to $00FF are
particularly valuable - this area
is called Zero-Page because the
Hi byte of these addresses is
zero. Consecutive bytes in zero
page are often used as pointers
in machine code routines e.g.
LDA ($3B),Y tells the computer
to look at $38 for the Lo byte of
an address, look at $3C for the
Hi byte, add the value of the Y
register t o  t h e  addr es s
obtained and then load the
accumulator with what it ﬁ
at the calculated address.
We have seen that Basic
normally starts at $1001 but if
you type
GRAPHIC1 'RETURN'
The s c r een w i l l  s h o w  a
haphazard pattern because
you will have moved into the
High Resolution mode. This
mode takes an extra 12K of
RAM m e m o r y  a n d  t h e
computer gets this by moving
the start of Basic up to $4001.
Even though you may not be
able t o  see on your screen

1
P l u s / 4
which key you are pressing,
carefully type:
GRAPHIC° [RETURN]
and y ou w ill return t o  the
normal screen.
So we see that the operating
system takes either  $1000
(approx 4K) at the bottom of
RAM for normal Basic or $4000
(approx 16K) for high resolu-
tion graphics.
What about t h e  t o p  o f
RAM? Well, apart from a small
area from $FD00 to SEM which
is again used by the system, the
rest of RAM is available for
Basic programs. The amount of
memory from $1000 to $FCFF is
60671 and this is the number
that appears on the screen at
ﬁrst power up.
However, to work all the
Basic system of the computer, it
needs another 32K of memory
- the ROM. Where does this go
- we already know that the
computer can only read 64K of
memory and it looks as though
this is all taken by RAM. What
happens is that the ROM for
the operating system has
addresses from $8000 to SIFF.
So there are two different bytes
of memory that have the same
address one byte in RAM and
another byte in ROM. When
the computer is  working it
needs a switch between RAM
and ROM so that the correct
byte is read.
Different areas of memory
are called memory banks and
we need banking routines to
switch different banks in or
out.
The Plus/4 memory map
may be illustrated by Diagram
When ﬁrst switched on the
computer has access to RAM
memory bank $0000 to $7FFF
and ROM $8000 to WEE. How-
ever t h e  PEEK a n d  PO KE
commands will always access
RAM. A  m a c h in e  c o d e
program could be POKED to
the top of RAM (below SEDOOI
but a system call to this part of
memory would result in a ROM
routine being entered at an
unusual point and execution
continued f r o m this  point.
(Execution usually means death
of the computer in this case - it
will probably hang!)
The i n b u i l t  m o n i t o r
TEDMON allows you to display
memory locations o r  d is -
assemble either RAM or ROM.
Let us try some examples.
Type a n d  enter  this  Basic
program:
10 SA=992
20 FORI=Oto9

40 NEXT
50 DATA 162,26,138,157,200,12,
202,208,249,96
This is the type of program that
appears in this and other com-
puter magazines. The numbers
in t h e  data statement ar e
POKED into memory one by
one starting at location 992 if
the program is RUN.
The simple machine code
program following w ill b e

Tape Buffer area and thus safe
from corruption.

The ﬁrst command loads or sets
the X register to $1A which is
the same as 26, the number of
letters in  the alphabet. The

value of X, which is 26, to the
accumulator so both X and A
are now 26. The location $OCC8
is the initial or zero column of
the sixth r ow in the screen
memory. The instruction STA
$OCC8,X stores A in location
SOCC8 plus the value o f  X
which will be column 27 of row
six ( 27 because t h e  initial
position corresponds to X = 0).
The STA instruction is like a
POKE so a letter Z will appear
on the screen. The next line
decrements X by  one which
now becomes 25. This is not
zero so the BNE (Branch Not
Equal) sends t h e  processor
back to the TXA. This will result
in a Y being printed and so on
until X  i s  z er o when t h e
program will g o t o  the RTS
(ReTurn from Sub-routine) and
return to Basic. So all the letters
of the alphabet will be printed
in reverse or der . SYS 992
IRETURn] will run the routine.
OK, so far so good. Now
let's tr y  t he Monitor. Type
MONITOR and [RETURN].
Actually M and (shifted 0) is an
abbreviation that c ould b e
used.
Then type:
37
D 03E0 03E9
when the above machine code
should be displayed.
Let us try to move this to an
address where we have both
ROM and RAM - above $8000.
Type X and [RETURN] t o
return t o  Basic. Lis t t h e
program already entered and
change l i n e  1 0  t o  r e a d
SA=32768. It is a good idea to
save this program now. The
number 32768 is the decimal
equivalent of $8000. now RUN
the program. T he machine
code will now be in RAM from
$8000 and it might seem that
SYS 32768 w ould r u n  t h e
program. Well tr y  it !  What
happens is that the SYS call
goes to the memory bank that
is switched in, which is ROM
above $8000 and happens to
have a routine to give a warm
start. If you saved your program
then reload or type it out again.
RUN to make sure the machine
code is in RAM.
To check, go back into the
monitor by typing M (Shifted
0) and [RETURN] then D 8000
[RETURN].
What you now see is ROM
and not our little program.
However t he Monitor  is
controlled by location $07F8.
Type M 07E8 07E9 to display
memory locations and ty pe
over the ﬁrst 00 with 80 then
[RETURN]. The monitor will
now display RAM above $8000.
Type D 8000 again and there
should be our little machine
code program- Yo u  should
note that although the monitor
is displaying RAM, if you used
the G command, i.e. G 8000.
then R O M  would again be
executed. (Don't do it!)
How can a machine code
above $8000 be executed? The
secret lies  i n  t w o  memory
locations.
SFF3E — ROM select
SUN — RAM select
Any write (i.e. POKE) t o
UBE will select ROM and any
write to $FF3F will select RAM.
However care is needed. If you
do POKE to $FF3F the machine
will hang! This is because at the
ﬁrst interrupt t h e  interrupt
vector will point to RAM and
not the usual interrupt routines
in ROM. Thus the interrupt
must b e  disabled before a
switch t o  R A M  a n d  t h e n
cleared after the call to RAM is
ﬁnished.
Type the following extra lines:
60 SA=992
70 FORI=0 to 11
80 READX:POKE(SAH),X
90 NEXT
100 D AT A 120,141,63,255,32,
0,128,141,62,255,88,96
Now, i f  y o u  R U N  t h e
program i n  a d d it io n  t o
entering the old routine at
$8000 in RAM you will also have
entered the following routine
at $03E0:
03E0 78 S E I
03E1 8D 3F FF STA $FF3F
03E4 20 00 80 (SR $8000
03E7 8D 3E FF STA $FF3E
03EA 58 C L I
03E1360 R T S
You could check by going
into monitor and disassembl-
ing from $03E0 and also $8000.
The c o m m a n d  S Y S  9 9 2
[RETURN] will run routine.
Eel's examine this in detail.
When you enter the command
SYS 992 the program will go to
$03E0 and set the interrupt i.e.
the interrupt no longer occurs.
The nex t op-code at  $03E1
looks as though we are trying to
put the value of A  into the
location SiFF3F but actually this
acts as a switch which changes
from ROM to RAM. The next
op-code makes the processor
jump t o  the sub routine in
RAM at $8000 and executes it -
printing out the alphabet as
before. The RTS at the end of
the $8000 sub-routine returns
the processor to $03E7 where
the STA VHF switches back to
ROM. The interrupt is returned
to normal and the ﬁnal RTS
returns us to Basic.

GRAPHICALLY
SPEAKING
Stuart Cooke takes a close
look at Vidcom 64, a new I
low priced art package.
NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF PROG-
ram you are writing for your C64,
presentation is important. If  you are
writing a  business package then the
screen should be made to look as inter-
esting as possible. On the other hand if
you are writing a game you will need to
provide an interesting backdrop for
your game. There's no point in writing
the best ever platform game if it isn't
pleasing to the eye.
Designing screens on the C64 is not
that easy since there are no inbuilt
graphics commands availab le.
Therefore, many programmers will use a
graphics package that will help them
draw 'pictures' in as short a time as
possible and with ease. Numerous
packages and peripherals are available.
For example you could use a light pen or
a touch tablet or even your joystick.
Vidcom 64 is another package to add
to that already overﬂowing number of
programs available, it does however
have one feature that will make it stand
way above the others, its price is only
E4.95.
Vidcom's 64 will work on either the
C64's multi colour or standard bit map
screens. Standard bit map mode allows
you to use two different colours in any
character square on the screen while
multi-colour mode allows you to have
four colours in any square with a loss in
horizontal resolution, i.e. the coloured
'dots' are twice as big.
The best controller t o  use with
Vidcom 64 is a trackball, however for
those who can't afford one of these fairly
expensive devices, a normal joystick will
work just as well.
Layout
On entering the program the screen is
split into two halves. The upper half is
the top half of the screen on which you
will draw, the other half is the control

panel whic h displays mos t o f  t h e
functions available. I say most as there
are actually three menus which appear
at this position, each one being selected
by the function keys. Moving your con-
troller will move a small arrow around
the screen allowing you to choose which
command you want to use. Each press of
the ﬁrebutton is acknowledged by a
tone and the command that you have
selected starts to ﬂash.
Entering the drawing area is simple,
you just have to press the control key. As
I have previously said you can only see
half of the drawing screen at once.
However, if  you move your pointer
down the screen the command menu
will ﬂip up to the top of the screen
allowing you to alter the contents of the
bottom half of the screen. Sometimes
this is quite difﬁcult to use as you can't
see what is on the other half of the
screen to which you are writing on.
Thankfully the author of the program
has included a way of turning off the
command menu allowing access to the
full screen.
The three command menus available
are the drawing menu which allows you
to select all of the drawing commands,
the deﬁnition menu which allows you to
manipulate sprites, characters and
patterns and the I/O menu which allows
you to save all of your work to disk or
tape.
Commands
All of the expected drawing commands
are available. We have the freehand
draw, band draw, box, circle etc. There
are even some extra ones such as the
ability to duplicate areas of the screen,
rotate the contents of a box on the
screen and reverse the contents of a box.
A few ﬁll commands are also avail-
able from the drawing menu. Vidcom 64
has two graphic screens available for
use. The-merge ﬁll routines available in
this menu allow you to merge areas of
one of the graphics screens with the
other.
A 'normal' ﬁll routine is available
from the deﬁnition.
The PAT FILL command allows you to
ﬁll areas of the screen with a pattern of
your choice. This can be one of the
patterns included in the program which
consist of everything from a solid to a
brick wall, or you can use the grab
deﬁnition command which allows you
to generate a new pattern by grabbing
an area of the screen.
As you are no doubt aware, the
screens in most games programs are not
saved as a picture. Rather, the screens
are built u p  from a  number of  re-
deﬁned characters. The reason for this is
that using characters will take up a lot
less memory and you can use characters
39
from one screen on another, saving
even more space. With Vidcom 64 it is
possible to grab character deﬁnitions
from the screen. This means that you can
use this package to design your screen
and then save i t  as  a  number o f
characters. You can use these characters
to design your other screens.
Not only can you grab characters but
it i s  als o possible t o  gr ab sprite
deﬁnitions. Now it is a simple matter to
change an area of the screen into sprites
for use in another program.
Input/Output
The I/O  menu offers a wide range of
functions. It is possible to LOAD, SAVE,
VERIFY and REPLACE data. Data can be
the actual graphics screen, o r  t he
pattern, character or sprite deﬁnitions. It
is also possible to select whether you are
using cassette or disk from this menu.
Gripes
Obviously no program is perfect and I
did think of a few improvements that
could have been made to this package to
really make it stand out from the rest.
There is no function that allows you
to get a printer dump of the screen that
you are designing. A screen dump is
often quite useful for reference without
having to load the screen back into the
computer. There ar e many  similar
packages that do offer this facility.
I previously mentioned that the
program mak es  a  beeping nois e
whenever you select a command from
one of the menus. However some of the
drawing commands need more than
one press of the ﬁre button to operate.
No indication i s  giv en w hen t h e
program has acknowledged the ﬁrst
press. From experience this quite often
means that you end up with circles and
boxes that you can't see. A simple beep
after each press of the ﬁre button would
have made things a lot clearer.
For f  4.95 it is very difﬁcult to fault
Vidcom 64. It is an extremely easy to use
and powerful program offering many
facilities that are only available on more
expensive programs.
If you don't own a graphics program
then I would suggest that you go out and
buy this. Even if you can't draw its great
fun just messing around.
If y o u  already o w n  a  graphics
package then this is still worth looking at
as it has some very powerful features.

KONAMI'S PING P o
gine
THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE
number o f  ' ﬁg h t i n g '
programs appearing o v e r
recent months, we've had
kung-fu, wrestling and shoot-
ing. Now Beyond has brought
out a game that combines the
elements of a 'ﬁghting' game
with those that expect you to
get a ball in the goal, as in
football.
You ﬁnd your player in an
arena, you at one side and
your opponent at the other.
Both players are tied to the
wall behind them by a length
of elastic, and are armed with
some sort o f  scoop with
which you can try to catch the
ball that is ﬂying around the
screen.
ONE O f  THE BLOODIEST
battles in the Second World
War was the attempt by the
US Marines t o  regain the
island of Iwo Jima from the
Japanese. Jo h n  W a y n e
managed it. Now, thanks to
the title in the PSS Wargames
Series, you too can Eee if you
have a ﬂair for tactics.
You have between 32 and
36 turns to eliminate all the
Japanese forces from t h e
island depending on which of
the ﬁve skill levels you select.
Tactics must be selected care-
fully as both all out attack and
solid defence are likely to
meet with failure. Whilst you
receive re-inforcements
(weather permitting), t he
IN THE DIM AND DISTANT
past the only video game
available was a crude table
tennis simulation called Ping
Pong. Do not confuse it with
this little pearl from Imagine.
The opening screen i s
typical Japanese cuteness
where a  ping-pong b all
bounces out Konami's name
and then bounces down on to
the head of an unsuspecting
mole. After selecting the level
of play the next bold graphic
display shows the view of the
table from the human player's
end with an audience just off
in the wings. At each end of
the table is a disembodied
hand grasping a bat.
Points are awarded for
getting the ball in the net,
which is situated at the top of
the screen or for knocking
your opponent over.
What makes this game so
much fun is watching your
players ﬂoundering on the
ﬂoor being dragged along by
the elastic and seeing them
being knocked senseless by
the walls at either end.
There really isn't a  lot
more that can be said about
this game apart from the fact
that the idea is extremely
original and that Beyond has
created a game that is great
fun to play.
S.C.
Japanese don't and so tend to
launch suicide attacks when a
unit is close to being wiped
o u t
The game is controlled
entirely via a joystick using it
to select from your various
units and determine their
options from assorted menus.
These options include land-
ing on one of the six beaches,
move, at t ack o r  pass.
Each unit has aggression and
defensive factors, a  move-
ment allowance and a combat
range.
Iwo Jima is a very user
friendly wargame and I found
it more challenging to play
than its sister game Falklands

H
.
During p lay t h e  bats
follow the path of the ball
automatically and the only
control that you need worry
about is the kind of stroke to
play.
Occasionally a stroke will
result in a 'ﬂoater', a weak
shot w h ich  suggests a
superfast smash as a reply. In
the lower levels this is no
problem but as you progress
through the levels, the game
gets faster and faster and
relies more on reﬂex action
just like the real thing.
The only qualms about
this excellent conversion is
the lasting appeal o f  the
game.

Va4uo For
DURING THE CURRENT
burst of interest in the C-16/
Plus/4 market a lot of C-64
games are gaining a new lease
of life. Skyhawk resembles
Virgin Games Falcon Patrol
which has long been a
favourite of mine.
As t h e  pilot  o f  a n
advanced VTOL ﬁghter it is
your job to see off the enemy
bombers which are devastat-
ing the countryside. Fuel and
air-to-air missiles (AAMs)
must be monitored carefully
during each battle and should
the need for re-equipping
your ﬁghter arise you will
have to be fast and careful
and keep an eye on the radar
for approac ing • om • ers.
At ﬁrst each wave consists
of two planes but this gradu-
ally increases to four as the
game progresses.
Unlike Falcon Patrol, the
jet cannot descend into the 3D
scrolling landscape. This
makes refuelling less hazard-
ous, but still tricky, because
the plane cannot crash unless
it collides with a bomber.
Skyhawk is a  game of
survival. The bombers keep
coming until you have run
out of jets or fuel after all of
the refuelling platforms have
been destroyed. Cheap,
cheerful and quite addictive.

AIR ATTACKS FROM AIR-
craft carriers can best be
stopped by sinking the ﬂoat-
ing airstrip which harbours
the planes. Sound logic but
not as easy as it seems. First
you have to battle through
the waves of ﬁghters which
protect the ship. This is your
mission in Bandits at Zero and
it is quite a challenge.
The game starts with your
solo ﬁghter-bomber ﬂying
low over the sea searching for
the enemy. First there is an
encounter with a refuelling
plane to top up your tanks
ready for the long day ahead
but soon your radar display
becomes live with tiny blips
which denote the enemy
'ﬁghters ahead. As the plane
ﬂies to join combat the screen
scrolls smoothly as a coalline

seascape is  gradually un-
furled, but this is no tourist
trip because soon the enemy
is there in front of you.
The ﬁrst day is  easy
pickings because most of the
planes are ﬂying in the same
direction as yourself but more
slowly. Taken by surprise, the
pilots rarely ﬁre back and the
only real problem is your own
skill a t avoiding collisions
with them. A  cautious eye
should be kept on the radar
screen for  the occasional
attacking plane which zeros
in on you from the opposite
direction at high speed. If a
collision occurs you lose one
of your seven protective
shields.
After this leisurely cruise
across the rolling seascape,
night gradually falls (nice use
of colour as the daylight
gradually fades). By now your
fuel is critically low but there
is help at hand as you rendez-
vous with the tanker once
more. Tricky business, this
aerial refuelling lark. Altitude
and speed are critical as the
umbilical cord is attached and
If you take too long dawn will
break and the tanker will
zoom off to safety. Enemy
attacks are few at night but
occasionally a  ﬁghter will
appear. The best policy is
prayer. Fue l i s  m or e
important than ﬁghting so
• with a little bit of Divine inter-
vention and a gritting of your
teeth as you bite the cord, the
night will pass without the
loss of another shield and the
sun will come up on a freshly
refuelled j e t  eager f or
another day's action.
The new day brings with it
a new breed of pilot, the rear
guns blaze in your face and
their rockets spit out at you if
they get behind your plane.
More jets appear to be ﬂying
towards you at high. velocity
and your shield count is in
danger. Night seems a long
way off as you ﬂy on towards
your target across the never-
_ ending sea.
Another nocturnal r e -
fuelling ﬁnds you closer still
to your target. This is
indicated by  the ﬂeet of
battleships which are sending
up a battery of shells. Still the
enemy planes attack and the
tiny black ﬂecks o f  ﬂak
threaten to blot out the sun.
Before long you begin to
wish that day three had not
dawned and regret that it
did.
Graphically, t he  game
appears a lot more sophisti-
cated than it actually is and in
comparison to many other C-
16 games it shows what a
thoughtful programmer can
do within t he  cramped
memory conﬁnes o f  the
machine. Adding an extra
problem to deal with as each
screen goes by, helps to stave
off the boredom of a straight
forward shoot-ern-up.
The only really weak point
of the game is the music
which is mournful and un-
imaginative. It only appears at
the end of each day so I won't
complain too loudly.
Ammunition supplies are
reminiscent of a cowboy's six-
gun in the old silent movie
days, bullets are unlimited.
In this way the
temptation to ﬂy with trigger
ﬁnger down would have to be
curbed in favour of accurate
and thoughtful gunnery skills.
Don't allow these criti-
cisms to draw you away from
the fact that this is a superb
game worth every penny of
your hard earned cash. If
things do get a little dull you
can sweep your jet back and
forth across the skies.
In this way the program
commits more enemy planes
into ﬂying towards you at a
high rate of knots increasing
your problems three-fold.

IN DECEMBER 1944 HITLER'S
army was being driven back
towards the Fatherland and a
major counter offensive was
needed to drive the allies
away from the Rhine. The
conﬂict that ensued became
known as the Battle of the
Bulge a nd marked t he
beginning of  the end of
World War II,
A major part in the offen-
sive was played by the Panzer
Tank Divisions of the German
army. These powerful tanks
had earned themselves the
nickname of 'tigers', hence
the title of this simulation.
As in the real battle the
action be gins  o n  1 6
December and ends on 27
December. Players can take
charge of each army or the
computer will play the role of
the e ne m y .
The weather conditions of
those fateful days of long ago
are faithfully reproduced
during the  game, deter-
mining whether your air-
borne supplies can be ﬂown
in or not. Being Northern
Europe in the dead of winter,
you soon learn to take ad-
vantage of the few clear days
that occur. Supply level
affects the ﬁghting strength of
your units and can become a
crucial factor in your success.
The situation at the be-
ginning of the game is that the
Allied Forces are represented
by greenhorn American
troops against a very experi-
enced and strong German
army. The initial aim of the
Allies is to hold back the on-
slaught until reinforcements
arrive, For the Germans it is to
break through and cross the
River Meuse, taking the
4
major towns of  Bastogne,
Marche and Rochefort on the
way for maximum points. The
eventual aim of the Allies is to
breakthrough to the East.
Each day is broken down
into a sequence of ﬁve moves.
Firstly the Germans alter their
positions and enter into such
skirmishes as these moves
allow, Next it is the Allies turn
to do the same. After this, re-
inforcements are placed on
the map and Victory Status is
assessed to see if the game
can continue. Finally, you are
given the option to save the
game before the next day
dawns,
The result of a battle is
determined principally on
the relative strength of the
units involved a nd t he
strategy chosen for attach and
defence. If the result of a
battle is a dramatic win, the
victorious unit may advance
three squares and attack
again later that day. Defeated
forces may retreat if there are
any combat points left. Some-
times this will overtax an
undersupplied unit and they
will be wiped out.
Attack strategy can be a
major offensive, a medium
battle, a light skirmish or a
gnat bite of a reconnaissance
mission. In defence you may
chose to counter-attack, try
to hold your position, with-
draw or try delaying tactics.
Choosing the  correct re-
sponse to your opponents
strategy is the aim so that you
will lose fewer combat points,
if any, and live t o ﬁght
another day. The longer a unit
survives the  greater the
number of combat ponts that
are awarded at the end of
each day. A unit with fewer
than 25 points is in serious
trouble and must rely on
plenty of movement points to
pull back out of harm's way
while they recover. This I
learned from bitter experi-
ence!
Extra combat points can
be awarded it you chose to
include an artillery barrage
with your attack. Each day you
have a number of artillery
points awarded and you are
given the option of using a
limited amount of ﬁre power
to shore up a ﬂagging unit.
The documentation which
accompanies the game is
extensive but confusing. A
map of the whole area is also
supplied but I found it to be
confusing. Locating my start-
ing position took a while and
this wasn't helped by the key
being some distance from the
map itself.
Eventually, I  struggled
through the documentation
and found that the best way to
learn is through experience. I
fought long and hard but I
regret to say that if it had been
left up to me we'd all be sing-
ing German folk songs by
now! This is an enjoyable
simulation but this battle is
popular f o r  computer
strategy games and I  have
seen better in my time.

YES, IT'S YET ANOTHER
ﬂight simulator! This one sees
you in charge of a jet ﬁghter
defending your island from
the enemy planes. Their
target is the nuclear power
plant and it is vital that you
intercept their bombers
before they reach their
destination.
The screen display is in
two halves, the top window
showing the view from your
cockpit whilst the bottom
part of the screen contains
your instruments. These
include a  radar, compass,
several guages and warning
indicators and a scrolling map
of part of the island. A full
screen map of the entire
island can be called up at the
press of a button.
Although the instruments
look complicated, controlling
your plane is very simple. You
can attack an enemy plane with
either cannon or missile, but
you have ﬁnite supplies of
both. You also get the chance
to refuel in mid-air providing
that certain conditions are
met.
Wing Commander was
written back in 1994 and is
beginning to look a bit dated
now but if you want to try a
cheap ﬂight simulator before
splashing out on a  more
sophisticated model, it could
be just the thing you are look-
ing for.

as possible. Thankfully in the
case of Off The Hook the 10
programs included are all of a
fairly high quality.
Programs included on the
tape are the second of Act-
ivisions programs featuring
Pitfall Harry and is great fun to
play. Harry is trying to rescue
his niece -  makes a change
from Princess -  w h i l e
avoiding the many dangers
on his way such as scorpions,

giant frogs an d  electric
eels. This game kept m e
occupied for a  long time,
never d i e s  m a y  h a v e
something to do with this!
Next on the cassette is
Space Pilot 2 from Activision.
This game offers nothing out
of the ordinary and looks a
little dated. Nevertheless
ﬂying your space ship over a
scrolling backdrop a n d
shooting enemy ships is still
great fun.
Probably the largest and
most complex game on this
cassette i s  Psytron f ro m
Beyond. When this game was
launched on the Spectrum
around two years ago I didn't
get anywhere with it and I've
not improved in those two
years. You are in charge of the
Betula 5 installation and must
defend i t  against enemy
invaders. This means that you

must shoot them out of the
skies, go after any that get into
your buildings and see to any
repairs that your complex
needs. Psytron is a very com-
plex game - the fact that the
instructions take u p  more
space than all of the other
games on the cassette put
together shows this.
Fall Guy from Elite allows
you to play that famous TV
character Colt Seavers the
stunt man. Your job is to
perform all the stunts set in as
little t i m e  a s  possible.
Nothing really exciting here
but well worth loading in for a
quick half hour.
Demons of Topaz from
Firebird places you on the
asteroid Topaz. Your aim is to
ﬁnd the sacred crystals that
are scattered around t h e
many levels of the asteroid,
Yes yo u ' ve guessed i t ,
Demons of Topaz is a plat-
form game. I t  is however
quite well produced and is
good fun to play.
Sheep i n  Space f ro m
Llamasoft should need n o
introduction. But, just in case
you've never heard of it, it's a
little similar to a Defender
game, but in this case there's
no one to rescue and you
must kill all of the Hostiles
before they can blow up your
planet. Oh by the way, you
aren't given a spaceship, this
time you are an intergalactic
sheep.
Kong Strikes Back from
Ocean is probably the most
ANYONE WH O  DEFEATED
the evil pumpkin i n  t h e
original Cauldron now has the
chance to turn the tables. The
Witch Queen is in charge of a
wholly evil regime. The only
person who can..put things
right again is you -  a brave
pumpkin warrior!
Cauldron II is a sort ot
platform game but instead of
jumping, you bounce and this
is likely to take you sometime
to get used to as our hero
rebounds off walls like a ball
bearing on a pin table. Start-
ing i n  o n e  o f  several
randomly chosen locations,
you must collect assorted
objects bef ore y o u  c a n
depose t h e queen. These
disappointing game on the
cassette. Mind you, when you
think of the price it's not all
that bad. In this game you
must guide your man up the
fairground track t o  rescue
your damsel in distress. Of
course there are objects for
you to avoid on your way up
such as roller coaster cars and
springs.
Black T h u n d er f ro m
Quicksilva ﬁnds you charg-
ing along a number of roads
shooting evrything in sight.
An extremely last game and
great fun to play.
Death St ar Interceptor
from System 3 is the penul-
timate game on the cassette.
This game ﬁnds you once
again in control of a space-
ship trying to save the galaxy.
Again nothing out o f  the
ordinary is offered but if you
are into zapping aliens then
you'll probably enjoy it.
Bringing up the rear is
Talledega, and that's exactly
what I did in this racing &vile.
and this one offers nothing
out of the ordinary though it
is great fun to play.
When you consider the
amount o f  money that is
being asked for this cassette
and then work out how much
is being asked for each game
it's impossible to complain.
Even if there are only a
couple o f  games o n  t h e
cassette that yo u  haven't
already got then its still worth
the asking price. Go out and
buy it NOW.

include crown, scissors and
axe. There are various nasties
trying to stop you and collid-
ing with these depletes your
energy. You can however
pick u p  glowing spheres
which both replenishes your
energy and allows you to ﬁght
back by hurling these spheres
at your enemies.
The graphics are good and
amusing with some lovely
touches such as when a gar-
goyle tips you off a platform
into open space. But I would
have preferred it  if every-
thing scrolled instead o f
jumping f ro m  screen t o

sure what nasties lie in wait

nuclear pow er  plant, t h e
central core is overheating
and there is a considerable
danger of a second blast. Your
task is to dampen down the
reactor rods using a team of
remote controlled android
commandos.
You have eight robots to
manipulate, each with a dif-
ferent set of skills and must
guide them through the 2000
rooms on eight levels as you
try to reach the core in time.
There are assorted intruders

have been with us for many
years but this is the ﬁrst that I
have seen for the C-16.
The game is one of survival
as you roam the galaxy facing
the attacks of  innumerable
alien craft. Flying singly or in
formation these demons are
armed w i t h  heat-seeking
missiles which will attemp to
snuggle up close to your ship,
vapourising you as they do so.

PROGRAMMER STEVEN
Kellett's name keeps cropp-
ing up on C-16 games. He
specialises i n  unsophiscti-
cated shoot-em-ups whic h
rely purely on fast reﬂexes for
survival.
This time he appears on
the Bug-Byte label with a
typical product o f  his  en-
deavours w h ic h  prov ides
mayhem with a storyline.
Solo is  the ﬁghter y ou
control in your battle against
the aliens w h o  appear i n
droves to annihilate you. The
action is  swift as they hurl
everything a t  y ou i n  their
venomous attack. Solo can
move in any direction on the
screen.
until he can be repaired by
one of his companions.
Moving the robots and
ﬁring is via the joystick but
there are also several key-
board commands for using
the objects that you have
found. The graphics are fairly
simplistic -  3D views of the
rooms with exits and rustles
shown but y ou can switch
between views to show the
doors more clearly.
Countdown is an interest-
ing game that will keep you
quiet for ages -  you can save
your current position. If you
enjoy large scale mapping
games, this is good value for
money.

lessening t h e  excitement
which t h e  gameply has t o
offer.
It is also noticeable that
the complexity of the angled
scroll i s  slower than t h e
simpler vertical or horizontal
scroll but I will accept this as a
game 'feature'.
I do feel that the game is
playable and certainly stunn-
ing. Each of the lour waves of
aliens are armed with missiles
which behave in their own
characteristic way.
To use a cliche, this is a
ﬂawed masterpiece.

Bugs, sparks and the odd
spanner i n  t h e  works r un

This is a platform game
and a  conveyor belt runs
along t h e  bottom o f  t h e

DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE
was o n  t h e  "other  s ide"
during t h e  Second Wor ld
War, Rommel was renowed
and respected for  being a
decent fellow and a brilliant
commander. It was only the
fact that the British, under
Montgomery, had cracked
the German codes and s o
knew every move that he was
going to make, that led to his
ultimate defeat i n  N or th
Africa.
The ﬁrst thing to be said is
that this  is  a n  incredibly
complex wargame and would
be best suited to someone
with a  fair amount o f  ex-
perience or a lot of patience.
Players take it in turn to rein-
to the switch at the top of the
screen to wind the belt on.
The nasties also wander
around t h e  platforms and
contact with them can b e

George Duval has managed
to get hold of some Amiga
games software. Read on to
ﬁnd out what's available.
IT IS A REAL SHAME THAT COMMOD-
ore, in all its wisdom, has decided that
the Amiga should b e  a  business
machine_ When you think about it, with
amazing graphics, 40% colours, stereo
sound and a  68000 processor, there
cannot be a machine more suited to
high quality games.
Fortunately, many o f  t h e large
American software houses agree with
me, and slowly b u t  surely some
excellent products are appearing. Elect-
ronic Arts was the ﬁrst company to
produce games for the Amiga, not
surprisingly perhaps -Commodore gave
development machines t o Electronic
Arts more than six months before
anyone else!
Most 64 owners will recognise the
ﬁrst three games EA released-Archon,
One-on-One, and Seven Cities Of Gold
as they are all conversions from C64
originals. None of these products take
full advantage of the Amiga's capabili-
ties, but each has its own touches that
make it just that little bit better than
anything available for a normal home
micro. But then the Amiga is no 'normal
home micro'!
Seven Cities of Gold was the ﬁrst
complete game for the Amiga, however
it is also the least good. It is ridiculously
similar to the 64 version, even down to
the chunky horizontal scrolling; which
is more reminiscent of the Vic 20 than a
f1500 Amiga!
In The Basket
Things improve greatly, however, with
One-on-One. Although i t  too is a
straight conversion from a well known
64 game, the graphics are goad and the
sound is absolutely mindblowing! In
case you don't know the game, it's a
basketball simulation, except that you
don't play a whole team, just one player
Dr .1, or Larry Bird (both of whom I am
assured are well known basketball
stars!). You must try and out-fox your
opponent and score as many points as
possible in the time allotted.
Graphically One-on-One is good,
though by no means special. By using
vertical sprites, the programmers have
taken the easy way out. Had they used
the much vaunted 'Blitter chip' the end
result would have been truly outstand-
ing. The sound however is a different
story. Using sound-sampling EA has
managed to use sounds from a real
game, and everything from the ball's
bounce t o  t h e popcorn seller i s
fabulous.
A  Arctic Fox
A  Vivnd W;Ilket
Adventuring
Perhaps the best known of EA's conver-
sions is Archon. As a 64 game I rated it
very highly, since i t  managed t o
combine the strategy of chess together
with a more exciting 'arcade' section.
On the Amiga it is the same game only
better. The graphics are beautifully
deﬁned, the sound is fun,and the game-
play is gripping -  what more could you
ask for?
Out In The Cold
Arcticfoxl If the ﬁrst three games are
good conversions, then Articfox is what
the Amiga is all about. Programmed by
Dynamix, it must be the best game on
any personal computer. To describe the
Flight Simulaitor
game in full would take hours, but
brieﬂy it is true 3-D (as opposed to sprite
3-D) Battlezone type game, in which you
control a  3 7 ton missile launching
100mph tank! This is the only game I
have seen that shows what can be done
on the Amiga. It has amazing graphics,
great sound, and is immensely playable.

On the packaging of Arcticfox is a
line which I think sums up what this
game is all about. It reads "Where do
you sleep when you own a 37-ton tank?
Anywhere you want to"!
Arcticfox's mission is set in 2005, and
you must inﬁltrate the Alien's force ﬁeld_
and blow up the main fort, thereby
defeating the aliens. Against you are a
wide variety of  stationary as well as
mobile weapons which will do their
utmost to make sure you get massacred
well before you reach the main fort.
What makes Arcticfox so good is the
attention to detail. The instrument panel
alone is  amazing, with each o f  the
weapons you have being activated by
moving an on-screen hand. Radar too
has been implemented, and the mini
screen used for displaying the guided
missiles is incredible.
Reviewing this  game poses one
difﬁculty, what superlatives are there
left to use? Screen shots cannot do this
game justice, and even the fact that it is
quite slow doesn't alter the fact that this
game is great.
In On The Act
Although EA is the biggest producer of
Amiga software, o t h e r  Amer ic an
software houses saw this computer as
their chance to be 'there at the begin-
ning'. Activision managed t o  release
three titles very quickly, yet retained a
very high standard.

A  Borrowed Time
As with most of EA's games, Activi-
sion has converted three best selling
Commodore 6 4  t it le s ;  H ac k er ,
Borrowed Time, and Mindshadow.
In 1985, Hacker was one of Activi-
sion's best selling games. On the Amiga,
it has been upgraded graphically, but
the gameplay remains the same. You
have broken into a computer and must
travel around t h e  wor ld collecting
sections of a secret document. What
makes this game so good on the Amiga is
that the small 'monitor' within the game,
which is used to display the locations,
shows some incredibly well deﬁned
pictures of all the major cities around
the world (Tower bridge is especially
good!).
Mindshadow and Borrowed Time
are both graphical adventures, and
although they  have n o  sound, the
graphics are of a very high standard. In
Borrowed T ime y o u  play  a  1930s
detective called Sam Harlowe, and it is
your job to crack a complicated case,
and avoid being murdered - not an easy
task!
Mindshadow is a more impressive
adventure, in which you play a victim of
amnesia who must ﬁnd out who and
where he is. Although neither of these
games use the full potential of  the
Amiga, they were created fast, and as
such bode well for what Activision will
do in the future.
Although England is well behind on
Amiga development, we do have one
game -  Brataccus fr om Liverpool's
Psygnosis. Originally a QL game, more
recently it has been released for the
Atari 520ST, Mac and Amiga. It is an odd
game, i n  whic h y ou must wander
around a spacecraft, doing battle using
your sword and refusing offers of drinks
at the bar! Unfortunately Brataccus is
another example of a game that does not
take advantage of ANY of the Amiga's
facilities, even down t o the reduced
screen size and limited colour.

What Next?
What the future holds for Amiga games
is uncertain, but I have seen sneak pre-
views of two games which should be
released towards the end of 1986. Wynd
Walker will be Commodore's ﬁrst, and
quite possibly only, game for the Amiga.
It is  an arcade adventure with y ou
playing the hero, a wizard. As yet Wynd
Walker has no gameplay, but enormous
potential.
The Amiga is most suited to 3-D
simulations, a n d  I  hav e s een a n
unﬁnished ﬂight simulator that, when it
is released, w ill have airline pilots
aghast! Programmed b y  t h e  team
responsible for the now legendary Flight
Simulator II for the IBM PC, it is fast, has
wonderful s olid objects a n d  great
potential. Unfortunately in the version
have, y ou can also ﬂy  UNDER the
runway, and THROUGH the Pyramids!
As yet, no one has written a game
purely for  the Amiga, using all the
potential o f  this incredible machine.
However I know for a fact that EA is
writing t h e  arc ade class Ma r b le
Madness, which should be out within
two to three months. All eyes are on it
and another EA title Return To Atlantis -
the ﬁrst game to make use of the Blitter -
to show what really can be done.

This article should give you a
better grasp of this subject.
The program listed at the

the series to investigate the
drive, and allows the user to
store and retrieve programs
and data within the drive's
own memory. The program is
rather slow, as it is written in

as well as being a useful tool.

The Serial Bus
The 1541 Disk Drive is one of
the m a n y  p e r ip h e r a ls
available for the Commodore
64 which use the serial bus to
send and receive data to or
from the host computer. The
bus i s  a  d a is y  c h a i n
arrangement allowing up to
ﬁve peripheral devices to be
connected together , f o r
example, one printer and two
disk drives. Sinc e several
devices may be connected at
the same time, there must be
a way of distinguishing one
device from another. This is
the purpose of  the device
number, and the 64 assigns
numbers zero to 31 to the
serial bus, eight to 11 covering
up to four drives.
The 64, known as the bus
controller, can command a
device to receive data on the
bus (LISTEN) or transmit data
(TALK). Only one device may
talk on the bus at a time, but
many devices may listen to
one talker, and the 64 is the
only device on the bus that
may act as controller. When a
device is addressed, the 64
sends a n  attention signal
(ATM) over the bus, alerting
all connected devices that
they should be aware that
PROGRAMM
THE
data communication is being
established with one of them.
The 64 then sends the number
of the desired device, and if
that device is present, it will
res pond t o  t h e  A T N ,
otherwise a time out error will
occur, and the M will report a
DEVICE NOT PRESENT.
The 64 then indicates to
the selected device whether it
should b e  a  listener, and
receive data from the bus, or
be a talker, and send data. A
second address may also be
sent to perform any further
set up operations. To ensure
the accuracy of the following
data transmission, the data is
sent o v e r  t h e  b u s  o n e
character a t  a  time. O nly
when the receiver acknow-
ledges the accurate receipt of
the data may  t h e  sender
transmit. another character.
This fairly lengthy procedure
is known as handshaking, and
is necessary due to the 64 and
1541 n o t  being centrally
synchronised. When the data
transmission is complete, the
device is de-addressed; if the
device was sending data, the
64 s e n d s  a n  U N T A L K
command; if the device was
receiving data, the 64 sends
an UNLISTEN command. The
bus is then free to handle the
next transmission.
Controlling the 1541
Various housekeeping duties
such as renaming a ﬁle can be
executed by sending special
commands t o  the 1541. I n
order for us to manipulate the
drive's memory, t h e  Disk
Operating System (DOS)
designers k indly  inc luded
some extra commands, some
vital, some seemingly super-
ﬂuous. T h e  t h r e e  mo s t
important of these allow us to
store, retrieve and execute
1541
machine code routines and
data within the 1541 RAM.
They are similar to the POKE,
PEEK and SYS functions in
Commodore Basic, and work
in much the same way. These
special commands along with
their relevant parameters are
sent to the drive along the
command channel (15), and
are covered in depth in the
1541 user manual, so I will
only brieﬂy  rev iew t heir
syntax:

The s ame r outine w h e n
written in machine code is
considerably more involved,
but as long as the rules are
strictly followed, i n  t h e
correct sequence, equal
results can be achieved, and
often a  lot faster. Luckily,
most of the hard work has
been done for us, and we only
need t o  c all t h e  correct
Kernal routines:
Serial Bu s  KE RNAL
Routines
LISTEN SFE81 — Command a
device on the serial bus to
LISTEN.
SECOND SFF93 —  S e nd
secondary addres s after
LISTEN.
CIOUT SFEA8 —  Output a

UNISN SIFAE —  Command
all devices on the serial bus to

TALK SFIFIlit —  Command a

TKS A S F F 9 6  —  S e n d

UNTIK %FAB —  Command
all devices on the serial bus to
UNTALK.

Routines
IONIT $1E84 —  Initialise

READST SFF117 — Read status
word
To transmit data to a device,
the accumulator (acc.) is
loaded w it h  t h e  device
number, an d  t h e LISTEN
routine i s  called . T h e
secondary address (channel
number) is then stored in the
acc.. bits ﬁve and six are set
(result = s.a. * $60) and the
routine SECOND is called.
Data characters stored in the
acc. are then sent over the bus
using CIOUT, and the whole
sequence is terminated with
the UNLSN routine, which
sends a n  E 0 1  ( En d  O r
Identify).
Getting a device to send
data over the bus is just as
easy. T h e  KERNAL t al k
routines are used in place of
their corresponding LISTEN
calls, and data is input using
ACPIR. Bit six of the status
ﬂag (updated after a READST
call) can b e checked after
each ACPTR call to test for an
E01 from the drive.
To open a ﬁle or direct-
access buffer, bits ﬁve, six,
seven an d  eight o f  t h e
secondary address value are
set (result = s.a. + $10). Bits six,
seven and eight are set (result
= s.a. + $E0) t o close the
ﬁle/buffer.
Armed with this inform-
ation, we can now write our
machine code routine. Note
that because t h e LISTEN/
SECOND sequence is used
three times I have set it aside
as a complete routine call. Ina
program full of disk access,
this is often a valuable space
saving technique.
This co vers a l l  t h e
"Memory" commands and
their various peculiarities. As
reference o n ly, I  h a v e
included details of those less
well known commands I
mentioned earlier. So far I
have o n ly encountered
these commands implement-
ed i n  e l a b o ra t e  d i s k
protection schemes; t h ey
tend to suggest exact usage
because o f  their limiting
qualities. As in the case of the
Men wry cvoninands, they are
executed b y  sending t h e
function and its parameters
along the command channel.
BLOCK-EXECUTE: Reads a
speciﬁc track and sector into a
previously opened buffer and
executes the machine code
routine at the start of that
buffer,
Format: "B-E";CHR$(chan-
nel);CHR5(drive no.) ;CHR$
(track);CHRS(sector)
E.g. PRINT #15, "B-E"; 2; 0; 18;
10
USER-JUMP :Apart from the
two "Ux" commands used to
read ( U1/UA)  an d  w rit e
(U2/UB) speciﬁc sectors to
and from the diskette, and the
two "Ux" commands used to
set t h e  drive b u s speed
(U9/UI) and reset the drive
(U10/U.1), there are six "user-
jump" functions which, when
called, execute code at the
beginning o f  buffer #  2
($0500).
U3(UC) — jump to $0500
U4(UD) — jump to $0503
US(UE) — jump to $0506
U6(UF) — jump to $0509
U7(LIG) — jump to $050C
U8(UH) j u m p  to $0501
The nat ure o f  these
commands would suggest a
"jump-table" set  u p  t o
perform varied tasks within
the 1541
called up from an external
Basic o r  machine co d e
routine. F o r example, a
routine which reads section
18,0 into buffer# 1 and sends it
at high speed along the bus
could possibly be called by:
PRINT #15,"UC";CHR$(18);
CHR$(0)
Although, so far I  have
referred only to the 64 and
1541, the above kernal calls
and communcation protocols
are analogous to both the Vic-
20 with 1540 Disc Drive, and
the C128 in 64 mode with
1570/1571 disk drives.

Eric Doyle takes another
I long hard look inside your
[
THE 6500 SERIES CENTRAL PROCESSOR
may be the heart of a computer but it is
the slave of the operating system. The
OS is either a machine code program or,
more usually, the program contained in
the Basic ROM. This is the language of
convenience devised b y Microsoft
which the computer uses when it is ﬁrst
powered up.
For Convenience
A language of convenience has nothing
to do with the scrawlings on a lavatory
wall, it is merely a compromise language
used when communications cannot be
conducted i n  the speaker's mother
tongue. Basic is such a  language, a
computer speaks in pure binary but we
use English so a stylised form of English
has been devised to ease the job of prog-
ramming. Similarly, a computer does not
use variables in its operation, it uses
deﬁnite memory locations.
The use of variables in Basic is so
essential that I used to take it for granted
that my old Vic 20 knew what I was
talking about when I referred to them. It
wasn't long before I started to wonder
how it responded to and stored all the
variable names I came up with.
One possible answer was that every
conceivable variable name had a space
allocated by the ROM from the moment
I turned the computer on. Of course this
is impossible in a mere 3.5K of memory.
To allocate sufﬁcient space to 26 strings
tA$-XS) would need a reserved space of
6.5K and when arrays are taken into
account there wouldn't b e enough
room in a C128!
The only answer is that the computer
adds to the list of variables as each is
encountered when a program runs. This
still means that space has to be allotted
in RAM but it also means that there is a
limit to the number of variables which
can be deﬁned. It doesn't take much
effort to verify this by trying to dimen-
sion a large array like DIM A$(256,256).
This list is stored in the same area of
memory as the Basic program and ef-
fectively reduces the space which is
available. The more variables you use,
the shorter your program must be.
This means that the computer needs
to keep track of where the variable
space is to be found. How many types of
variable are there? Integer, string and
ﬂoating point make three but there are
also arrays and deﬁned functions.
How do we ﬁnd where these are
stored? Memory locations 45 to 52 hold
the secret (C128 owners in C128 mode
should add two to all the following
values):
Loci Loc2 Description
45 — 46 Start of variables
47 — 48 Start of arrays
49 — 50 End of arrays
51 —  52 String storage
55 — 56 End of string storage (end of
Basic memory)
The locations pointed to by the con-
tents of this tiny block of memory can be
found by multiplying the contents of
Loc2 and 256 and adding the contents of
Loci.
Down to Work
Time to experiment. Enter the following
short program and run it:
10 A%257
C H
We must ﬁnd the start and end of
variable storage so type in the following:
PRINT 256*PEEK(45)+PEEK(46),256*PEEK
(46)-1)
The values obtained will vary dep-
ending on the model of your Com-
modore but you will ﬁnd the difference
between the two values to be seven
bytes. This is the amount of  space
allotted to all integer variables.
Now let's see what's in these seven
bytes. Normally we'd use a loop to PEEK
each location in turn but this means
setting up a new variable and possibly
affecting these memory pointers.
Luckily, when a variable is set up another
pointer pair indicates where the variable
is stored. These are locations 71 and 72
(73, 74 in 128 mode). Add the following
lines to your program.
10 REM BANK1 IN C128 MODE
20 POKE 828,PEEK(71):REM POKE .2816,
PFEK(73) IN C128
30 POKE 829, PEEK(72):REM POKE 2817,
PEEK(74) IN C128
40 LO=PEEK(828)+PEEK(829)•256:REM
2816,2817 IN C128
50 FOR X=0 TO 6:PRINT PEEK (.0-t-X);:
NEXTX
Running the program should give
these values: 193,128,1,1,0,0,0.
You're probably wondering what all
this means. Let's examine the ﬁrst two
58
1
ﬁgures. What happens if we subtract 128
from both numbers? We get 65 and O.
Ah! 65 is the ASCII code for the letter A,
our variable's name. What if we'd called
it AA%? Could it be that we'd have
found 193 in the second byte? Try it and
see. Change your program line 10
variable to AA%.
Eureka! It works. So we now know
that the ﬁrst two bytes of a stored integer
variable is the ASCII code of the ﬁrst two
characters of its name plus 128.
The next two numbers reveal their
identity if we treat them in a similar way
as w e treated the variable pointers
earlier. This time we must multiply the
ﬁrst number by 256 and add the second
number. Put your computer down, you
can d o  this one in  your head. O k
Einstein, the answer is 257. Weil, well,
this is the value of the variable. Clever
isn't it?
What do the zeros mean? Precisely
that, nothing whatsoever! They're just
padding and you'll see why later.
Complex Integers
Let's try a larger value for AA%, like
32768. See, your computer can't take it.
Now try 32767. It likes that, why?
To answer that we've got to go
binary. Each byte consists of  eight
switches which can either be off or on
and each indicates a different number.
From left to right these are 128, 64, 32, 16,
eight, four, two, one. The number four
would be represented by the four switch
being turned on and all the others off,
ﬁve would need switch one and four on
and 255 would mean all switches were
on.
We have found that the stored
number is held in two bytes. In this case
the 16 switches add eight higher levels to
the existing group; 32768, 16384, '8192,
2048, 1024, 512, 256.
Adding all 16 numbers together we
get a maximum value of 65535. Sub-
tracting the highest permissable integer,
32767, from this gives 32768, the highest
switch value. If this switch is not used for
number storage what purpose does it
have?
If the switch is on, the integer is a
negative value and if it is off,the number
is positive.
The proof of the pudding etc. Give
AA% a value of -257. The resulting values
are 254 and 255. This gives 65279. We
know the number is negative so 32768
can be subtracted to give the answer
32511. If 32768 is subtracted again the
result is -257!

This is a mathematical solution. What
actually happens is that a negative num-
ber is represented in a form known as
two's complement.
To get a two's complement number
we need to look at the binary repre-
sentation of the positive value 257. An
on switch is represented by one and off
is shown as zero. From our previous
example we can see that 257 consists of
256+1, so we turn on those switches
only:
0000000100000001
Next we turn all on switches off and
all off switches on:
1
The ﬁnal act is to turn the last switch
back on:
1 1 1
Evaluating this gives the value 65279.
Now try for yourself to split the 16
switches into two groups of eight and
see what values you gel using the 128, 64,
32, 16, eight, four, two, one series in both
cases. You should get 254 and 255.
What would happen if the last switch
was on as in this case?
Number 0010011100000100
Complement 1101100011111011
1
We can't turn the last switch on to
complete our two's complement so we
turn it off and try the next switch. It's also
in the on position. Turn it off and move
along the line until you ﬁnd a switch in
the off position, remembering to turn
off any switches you have to pass.
In the example the third switch is off
so we need search no further:
Two's comp. 1101100011111100
To convert the number back to a
'real' value, reverse the process.
0010011100000011
1
001001110000010
=00100111 00000100
= 39*256 +  4
= 9988
Don't forget the minus: -9988
Play with the program giving AA%
different identities and then trying work
out from the dated PEEKed the number
you ﬁrst thought of.
Highly Strung
LT
Alternatively, if all this binary is too
much for you, work out the value stored
and subtract 65536 from ihe result to
give the negative value.
Flushed with success, we'll now look at
strings. Change line 10 to AS="FIND IT"
and run the program again.
This time the ﬁrst three values are 65.
128, seven. The next two numbers will
vary from machine to machine but the
last two will both be zeros. Ignore the
zeros, they're more padding. This time
the ﬁrst letter of the variable name is
directly represented by its ASCII value
but the second letter still has 128 added.
The next value is interesting count the
number of letters in the string. Ah so!
Treat the fourth and ﬁfth ﬁgures as a
two byte number and use this equation:
PRINT CHIMPEEK(fourtht+PE(K(ﬁlth)
*256)
Substitute t h e  values fr om y our
program for  the words 'fourth' and
'ﬁfth'.
It gives an "F". Enter the line again but
put 1+ between the ﬁrst bracket and the
command PEEK. I think we've found it!
Note that the computer reads the
value from the program line. Why do
locations 51 and 52 point to 40960?
Replace line 10 with this:
10 AS="FIND IT":135= "YOURSELF":CS
AS+BS
Run the program and, in the words of
the variable, ﬁnd it yourself.
Functional Storage
Straight in the deep end with you:
10 DEF FN AA(A)=PEEK(71)+256*PEEK(72)
20 LO=FN A A (0)-7
Erase lines 30 and 40 and r un the
program.
This t ime  t h e  ﬁrst character is
ASCII+128 and the second is straight
ASCII. The third number plus the fourth
multiplied by  256 gives the memory
location which follows DEF FN AA(A)=in
your program. PEEK it to make sure.
In t h e  deﬁnition w e  created a
variable A as well as a function variable
AA and the location of this variable is
given by the next two bytes. As usual
ignore t h e  sixth number whic h is
another zero.
59
Pause for a while to appreciate the
cleverness of the program which uses
the function deﬁnition t o  ﬁnd t h e
location of variable A and then back-
tracks seven places to get to the function
entry. PRINT L0+7 should give the same
value as the ﬁfth ﬁgure plus the sixth
ﬁgure multiplied by 256.
In my next article I will be raising
arrays and immersing you in ﬂoating
point variables.

you an Editor
l
ICU&
I HIS UTILITY IS INTENDED
for use on a Commodore 128
system operating i n  1 2 8
mode. The program is fairly
simple as assemblers go, but it
could be useful to someone
who perhaps cannot afford a
more comprehensive package.
Both t ap e an d  disk a r e
supported a s  w ell a s  a
printer.
Before g o in g  o n  t o
describe the program in more
detail, I  will give a  brief
overview.
In 1 2 8   m o d e ,  t h e
computer maintains two 64K
banks of RAM (RAM 0 and
RAM 1). There are a couple of
common areas in the memory
map to allow programs to
operate correctly between
banks. T h e r e  a r e  1 6
predeﬁned memory co n -
ﬁgurations. Of these, BANK
12 is used for this program.
This is a combination of RAM
0 from 0400-7FFE hex and the
kernal ROM from 8000 hex
upwards. This allows t h e
program to make direct calls
to the kernal routines without
having t o  g o  through a
complicated bank switching
routine. This area from 0000
to 03f F hex is a common area
in all banks. The source code
is edited in  RAM 1  from
04000-FEFF h e x  (approx.
62.75K) although the actual
amount allocated may b e
altered.
The assembler will allow
code to be assembled in any
of t h e  predeﬁned banks
(actually only RAM 0  and
RAM 1 are valid unless you
have a 256K machine), and a
limited relocation facility is
provided. The Commodore
machine language monitor
(MEM) can be accessed at any
time f r o m  t h e  e d i t o r
command mode. The MEM X
command will re-enter the
editor.
The program will be given
in two sections. In this article I
will deal with the editor.
When you have typed in the
editor you may use any of the
commands except C which
calls the assembler. Without
the assembler co d e t h e
system will probably crash.
The Editor
ﬁrst type in and save the small
program RELOCATE. This
program moves Basic to a
higher address in RAM 0 so as
to allow the assembler to be
constructed i n  the correct
place.
Note
You must always run this
program before using the
LOADER.
Now type in and save the
program LOADER. Use this to
enter the hex data from the
main listing. It will be a long
job so my advice is that you
do it in stages. That way you
won't g e t  frustrated if you
keep making mistakes.
If you look at the main hex
dump, you will see that each
line has an address, a hex data
string and a checksum value.
When you run the LOADER,
the m en u  w i l l  appear.
Options two and three save
and lo ad  t h e  complete
program area i.e. the memory
occupied by both the editor
and the assembler (which will
be published in  the near
future).
When asked for the start
address, enter 1C01. If  you
save an incomplete version of
the program and intend to
resume at a later time, make a
note of the next address you
have to enter and use this
when asked f or t he start
address. Wh en  yo u  have
entered the whole program,
type END,0 to return to the
menu.
During entry the program
uses the cherksum to validate
the input. It will request re-
input i f  an error is found
otherwise it will prompt you
with the address of the next
data string.
Keep these two programs
for use with the assembler.
Running the Editor
The program can be loaded
and saved l i k e  a  Basic
program. Type RUN to enter
the editor. A  message is
displayed and the computer
locked into lower case mode.
All commands mu st  b e
entered i n  l o w ercase
although uppercase may be
used i n  source text. The
assembler translates every-
thing into lowercase anyway.
The exception to this is the
text directive which will be
explained when you get the
assembler.
62
The Editor in
Operation
The operation of the editor is
similar to that of the normal
Commodore l i n e  editor.
l
numbers and the cursor keys
may be used to move around
the screen.
When ﬁrst starting out on
the program. I suggest you
think carefully about how big
the source code is likely to be
and allocate as necessary.
Unlike the Commodore
editor, this program does not
remove spaces (max lin e
length is 255 characters). This
means that you can make
your text more readable by
indenting sections of code.
A list of error messages
follows. M o s t  a r e  s e l f
explanatory.

Editor Commands in Detail
? — Display help page. This displays a summary of the
editor commands.
A — Auto line numbering. This enables and disables
the automatic line numbering during program
entry. T h e  for mat o f  t h e  command is  A
<increment>as in A 10 which sets an increment of
10. Auto numbering will commence from the last
line number entered plus the increment. The
operation of  this command is similar in most
respects to the Basic 7,0 auto command.
B — Set bottom of text memory in Ram 1. Initially the
allocation to the editor in RAM 1 is about 63KB.
This command along with T alters that allocation.
Addressing is  done i n  blocks o f  256 bytes,
numbered 0 to 250. Giving the command B20 will
set the bottom of text to block 20 (actual address is
256*(block+4) therefore this address would be 6144
decimel or 1800 hex). The message ARE YOU SURE
is printed and the user must give the Y response
before the relocation is carried out. This is done
since this command destroys any program in
memory.
C — Compile. Details will be given with the assembler
listing.
D — Block delete. Format is D<start>—<end>as in D
20-230. Deletes a block of lines.
E — End edit and exit. The message ARE YOU SURE is
printed and the user must give a Y response. This is
donw since exiting the editor may destroy the
program in RAM 1.
F D is p la y s  current tex t memory allocation and
number of bytes free.
Input output. There are several forms of this
corn mand.
I —  Display I/O information
IC — Display current device directory
ID — set current device
IN — Set current ﬁlename
IS —  Save ﬁle
IL —  Load ﬁle
63
An important concept is that of the current device
and ﬁlename. For example:
Enter ID
Editor responds
CURRENT DEVICE =8 [DISK]
ENTER NEW DEVICE>
Enter 1
Editor responds
NEW DEVICE =1 [TAPE] OK.
Now enter IN
Editor responds
CURRENT FILENAME =""
ENTER NEW FILENAME >
Enter "test" including the quotes
Editor responds
NEW FILENAME ="test" OK.
Now enter 1
The editor prints the following:
CURRENT DEVICE =1 [TAPE]
CURRENT FILENAME ="TEST"
PRINTER IS OFF
When IS or IL is used the current device and name are
used. Note that ID and IN may be used as follows:
ID1
IN"test"
The IC command will display the directory of the current
device if it is a disk drive.
IS and IL always load and save from/to the current
base block as determined by the B command. These two
commands will fail if no ﬁlename has been set or the
printer is on.
K — Kill program. Simply deletes the current ﬁle.
Conﬁrmation is  required. The program may,
under certain circumstances, be recovered with
the 0  command.
L L i s t  lines. Format is <start>—<end>. Run/stop may
be used to halt the listing.
M — Enter MLM. Monitor's X command will re-enter
editor command mode.
0  — Recover deleted program.
P — Printer preﬁx. Preﬁxing most commands with this
will cause output to be deﬂected from the screen
to the printer. Will not work with 11,IS and IC.
R — Renumber lines. Format is R<start >,<increment>
as in R 10,20.
S S e a r c h .  There are two different format to this
command. 1.5 "<string1>",R"<string2>":<start>,
<end>
2. S "<stringl>":<start>,<end>.
Form 1 ﬁnds every occurence of <stringl> and
replaces it with string 2 I f  *is used for<start>or
<end > ,  scanning w i l l  b e  fr om/to t h e
beginning/end of the ﬁle.
Form 2 ﬁnds every occurence of <stringl>.
T — Set top of RAM 1. Same type of parameters as
B. Note that bottom cannot be greater than top.

Tony Crowther
shows how to speed
up the C128 in C64
mode.
WHEN C O M M O D O R E
launched the C128 computer
they said that it had a CM
computer ins ide it .  They
claimed at the time that this
was completely compatible
with the normal C M  com-
puter. Well, time has demon-
strated that it isn't,, as many
programs will not work on the
C128. Obviously there must
be some differences between
the normal C64 and the one in
the C128.
The differences don't only
have to be a bad point. It is
possible to use some of them
to y our  advantage i f  y ou
know what you are doing.
As you probably know the
C128 has a FAST instruction
that blanks the screen and
causes i t  t o  r un in  2N4Hz
mode. You probably didn't
know that this fast mode is
also available from the C64.
Below a r e  t w o  ex ample
programs that will allow you
to use this 'bug' t o  y our
beneﬁt. For each program I
have supplied an assembly
listing for those of you who
wish to know how they work.
I use the Machine Lightning
assembler, but for those who
simply wish to use them I have
included a  s imple Basic
loader that w ill SAVE the
machine code on to your disk
or tape. If you are using tape
then change the ,5,1 after the
SAVE"name” in each loader
to .1 .1.

Program 1
This machine code program
when activated by SYS 49152
will access the C128's 2MHZ
processor so that the execu-
tion speed o f  t he C M  is
changed f r o m  .9Meg t o
1.2Meg w it h  f u l l  screen
display. The program doesn't
ﬁnish fher e however. By
pressing t h e  'F7' k ey  t he
screen is blanked out from
the bottom up. By blanking
more o f  t h e  screen i t  is
possible to alter the speed of
the CM from 1.2Meg up to
2Meg. T h e  gr eater  t h e
amount of screen blanked the
faster t h e  program. T h e
screen can be unblanked by

pressing the 'F8 key slowing
the CM down.
Note when this program is
running y ou w ill lose the
ability t o  talk t o  any peri-
pherals. Therefore hit RUN
STOP/RESTORE to quit. If at
this point the screen goes
funny then either h it  the
RESET button o r  type the
following line in blind;
POKE 53296,252.
RUN STOP/RESTORE does
not always reset the 2Meg
latch as this is inside the C128
and not the C64, hence the
need for this POKE to reset
the latch to normal.
Both of the programs in
this article can be used on the
128 if you alter the interrupt
vectors a t  $314 and $315.

Don't attempt this unless you
know what you are doing.
Program 2
This program works i n  a
similar fashion to the above
program. However, this time
the screen is blanked from
the top down, not from the
bottom. Blank ing i n  t his
program is also much quicker
than the other version of the
program.
So what use are these
programs? You could use the
routines t o  impr ov e t h e
speed o f  c a l c u l a t i o n
programs. Who knows w e
may e v e n  s tar t t o  g e t
programs that have a faster
mode for C128 computers.

[ﬁrst part of a series which will
I
most of your C64's musical
[talents.
IT'S A  FREQUENTLY REPEATED FACT
that Commodore Basic is the worst thing
about the 64. From a musical point of
view, all the instructions are realised as
POKEs (or PEEKs in some instances) to
memory locations corresponding t o
particular registers on the machine's 6581
programmable sound generator.
This makes f o r  a  relatively easy
transition to machine-code programming
— a topic we'll be dealing with in detail
later in the series since sound synthesis
and mus ic  programming ar e mor e
effective as you get closer to the hardware
level. An introduction to Basic techniques
is useful because the 64 sound commands
are already very close to the hardware
level. Unless you use a Basic extension, a
high-level language o r  music utility,
music programming in Commodore Basic
will inevitably bring you to within spitting
distance of the computer's hardware. This
is not the case with any other popular
machine.
For Basic use, all you really need to
know is that location 54272 corresponds
to register zero on the 6581 chip and the
locations, like the registers ,are numbered
in steps of one upwards. This is because
the 6581 s ound interface device i s
memory-mapped. I t  i s  addressed a t
location 0400 HEX (54272 DECIMAL). That.
is, the chip is enabled when address lines
A15, A14, Al2 and A10 are all high. The
lines AO to A4 are then used to address
SID's registers. While there are 32 possible
addresses using AO to A4, SID actually has
only 29 registers. The last three addresses
(54301, 54302 and 54303 — or, in hex,
D41D, 041E and D41F) are not used.
In general, POKEing a  memor y
location can best be understood as setting
certain data lines high and others low.
There ar e three independent sound
channels on the Commodore, each one
requiring at least ﬁve and at most seven
different locations to be POKE& Then
there are seven locations which relate to
all three channels -  three write-only
locations and four read-only locations.
The write-only locations are the SID
registers used to set up the sound you
wish to produce. Setting up the sound is
just a matter of POKEing the right data
into the right location.
Typically, the procedure is ﬁrst t o
POKE location 54296 with a  volume
setting which, as it were, sets up all the
channels. This setting is a value between
zero (off I and 15 (maximum). Thus 54296

can be divided into two nybbles (four bit
numbers), the least signiﬁcant or right-
hand nybble comprising bits number
three, two, one and zero of the byte
addressed at  location 54296, POKEing
54296 with, say, nine sets bit three high (1),
bit two low (0), bit one low (0)and bit zero
high (1). This gives 1001 as our nybble, in

binary code, and 1001 binary is equivalent
to nine decimal. The other, high order,
nybble at location 54296 is made up of the
four most signiﬁcant bits of the byte —
numbers seven, six, ﬁve and four. Setting
six, ﬁve and four high or low has the effect
of switching on or off one of the 6581
chip's ﬁlter modes. Setting bit seven high
or low has the effect of turning off or on
the audio output of channel three,
Having set a volume, you must then
select the desired channel for output and

bytes which set attack, decay, sustain and
release characteristics. The ADSR values
must b e  entered before the note is
actually turned on, which is a feature of
the hardware.
ADSR values ar e represented b y
nybbles — attack is the high order nybble
of one byte and decay the low order
nybble of the same byte, while sustain and
release are the high and lo w  order
nybbles, respectively, of the byte entered
into the next location in memory. Thus
there are 16 possible values for each of the
ADSR parameters, corresponding to the
16 possible values of one nybble. Decay
values, for example, are — in decimal —
any number between zero and 15, while
attack values (as the high order nybble)
are any multiple of 16 between 0'16 and
15*16. They can, of course, be added
together to give a combined setting for
attack and decay, since we can visualise
this process simply as one in which bits are
set lo w  o r  high in  both nybbles by
determining a value for a single byte. If
the value to the POKEs are exact and
different powers of two, (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
64, or 128), the effect of adding them is the
same as performing a logical OR on them,
since POKEing a location with one of the
above powers of two sets precisely one
data line high. This point should be borne
in mind for future reference.
The table below gives the real values
corresponding t o  ADSR parameter
settings. Note that A,D and R are given as
rates (that is, the lower their value, the
faster that phase of the envelope is over)
while S is a proportion of peak volume.
During the attack phase, the sound rises
to the level set by POKEing 54296 (the
peak level). During the decay phase, the
sound diminishes to a level set by the
sustain value (the plateau level). This can
be any of 16 values from the peak value
itself (if sustain is set at 15) to zero. Setting
sustain to eight, for example, would give a
plateau level of roughly half the peak
value — that is, for all practical purposes,
plateau level p e a k  value •  (sustain
value/16). All amplitude values on the 64
increase linearly, which is to say that
amplitude (which is heard as a linear
increase) you need to double the setting:
thus an amplitude of eight is twice an
amplitude of four which is not the'case
with other computers). Programs 1 and 2
use FOR-NEXT loops to create decaying
notes, the ﬁrst decreasing in volume or
amplitude by linear steps, the second by
an approximate halving at each step.
Notice the difference in effect. Also note
the actual locations used.

The s us tain ﬁgur es  a r e  o n l y
approximate and the timings are bawd on
a 1 MHz clock, while the actual clock rate
is 1.02 MHz in the US and 0.98 MHz in
Britain. The attack ﬁgures give the amount
of time taken for the note to rise from
zero to whatever the peak amplitude is.
Therefore, with a low peak amplitude, the
attack will appear gentler than with a high
peak amplitude. Similarly, decay and
release rates give the amount of time
taken for the note to decay or release to
zero amplitude. I f  a non-zero sustain
value is set, the decay will be interrupted
before the speciﬁed time is up. If a note
decays from a  low peak value, or  is
released from a low plateau value, then
the time taken is as speciﬁed, so that the
decay or release will be gentler than if the
peak or plateau values were higher.
Having s et overall amplitude and
envelope parameters, the next step is to
set frequency. The Commodore has a
range o f  almost eight octaves. T he
nominal frequencies can be calculated
using the formula: F=N*C/16777216 Hz,
where N is the decimal equivalent of the
familiar t w o  by te (16 bit) frequency
number and C is the clock rate.
Data is entered as a two byte number
(that is, as two bytes in  consecutive
locations and is, again, linearly related
frequency rather than pitch. Pitch is the
term we use to describe the sensation of
music at frequency, in which the basic
units are notes and tones. Two notes, for
example C  and D , will have a much
greater difference in frequency at a high
pitch than at a low pitch, which means
that errors may creep in at the bottom end
of the 64's octave scale, where small
numerical differences can have a large
effect on pitch.
Since the resolution is so good —
65536 values covering a range of 90-plug
notes —  accurate tuning is  easy, i f
somewhat tedious. The most accurate, if
least efﬁcient, method f o r  entering
frequencies is to specify the frequency
data for each note to be used in a program
as one of two items in a DATA statement.
(The relationship between the two byte
representation of frequency and a single
number value is given by FN=256*HE14-LB,
where FN is a frequency number and HB
and LB are the equivalent high and low
bytes in decimal). This method makes
overall tuning difﬁcult and it is often the
best compromise t o  actually calculate

of data in  your program, including a
tuning variable i n  t h e  calculation.
Program 3 plays a tune using frequencies
entered as DATA, while Program 4 uses
core data-to calculate frequencies. Note
how easy it is to tune Program 4 by just
changing a  single parameter i n  t he

Frequency data is entered as a low byte
and a high byte in consecutive locations
— the low byte allowing ﬁne tuning, the
high by te allowing coarse sweeping
through octaves. The range of values is, of
course, zero to 255 for each byte and out-

POKEd to the relevant location. Adding 16
and 32 (or performing a logical OR on the
values) produces a very thin pulseas a
result of logically ANDi ng the waves, but
adding 16 and 65 actually produces a fairly
rich composite waveform with a shape
rather like the top half of a sine wave
(Program 5).
If pulse is chosen, as in the above
example, it is necessary to set a pulse-
width o r  duty  cycle. There are 4096
possible values set by POKEing a byte and
a nybble into consecutive locations. The
byte has a range of zero to 255 and the
nybble a range of zero to 15. The reason
for setting different pulse widths is that
pulse width does affect timbre, because
the harmonic content of a pulse wave at a

given frequency depends on duty cycle. A
value of zero POKEd into both registers or
a value of 4095 (that is, 15 in the high
nybble and 255 in the low byte) wil give a
constant DC output. A value of 2048 (eight
in the high nybble and zero in the low
byte) will give a square wave. It is worth
experimenting w it h  combinations o f
waveforms, as above, using different
width pulses plus triangle or  sawtooth
waves, since the logical ANDi ng involved
works on the harmonics, cancelling out
some and magnifying others.
Setting the waveform should be the
last POKE in any series of commands,
because the waveform registers are also
the control registers for any channel. The
values for waveforms are as given above
plus 125 for noise, but the sound will only
be beard if bit zero of the control register
is set to one. This is known as the gate bit,
and it triggers the start of the attack phase
of any sound. If it is set to zero, the sustain
phase of the note terminates and it enters
its release phase. Thus, to start a note
playing, for instance a sawtooth wave, the
location corresponding to the relevant
waveform/control register mus t b e
POKEd with 33. To turn the note off, POKE
the same location with zero on any even
number. Thus a note duration is governed
by the attack time (given in the table
above), plus the proportion of the decay
time it takes to reach the sustain level

assocaited locations), plus the duration of
the sustain phase, plus the release time
(given above). Sustain duration is set by
means of a delay in the program. This can
be almost any command, but typically, a
FOR...NEXT loop is used_ Other common
delay techniques use the 64's internal
dock to measure a ﬁxes amount of time
(the variable TI holds clock data), a WAIT
command to detect a particular event or a
GET command to detect the presing of a
key. Problems sometimes occur with the
64's keyboard buffer, which should be
cleared by a POKE 198,0 instruction if a
key is pressed to initiate a note.
The remaining sound locations will be
dealt with in a future episode of the series,
after which we'll move on to machine-
code and a discussion of some theoretical
aspects of music-making. Meanwhile, you
should note that all locations and data
used in the sample programs have been
ascribed to variables to simplify the actual
POKEs. This not only makes the program
easier to understand, but it also saves
time, since the 64 deals with variables
quicker t han i t  does  w it h  numeric
constants. To ﬁnish, Program 6 shows
what can be done with the 64's ﬁlter
facility as a taster of things to come.

happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All o f  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual f o r  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

ARGUS SPECIALIST PUB LICATJONS LTD
would like to order the following cassettes: (please tick box)
programs o n  tape or  disk tor  them.
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
We are therefore proud to announce
the start of the Your Commodore Soft-
ware Service'. Most of the programs from
each issue of the magazine will now be
available on a single cassette for a price of
just £4.00. We will not be making disks
available since they would have to bea lot
more expensive and more difﬁcult to
post. This  shouldn't cause y ou any
problems though as none of the programs
will be protected and it will be a simple
matter t o  save the programs t o  disk
yourselves.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved us ing a  tape tur bo routine.
However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present. W e  therefore
recommend that before you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not
the original.

John Fletcher prove
that good games are
possible in Basic.
YOUR C I T Y I S  UNDER
attack f r o m  t h e  a l i e n
'Honker'. Your mission is to
rescue all o f  your people
from the city before 'Honker'
reaches it. Should he reach it,
then you can wave good bye
to your three lives.
There may seem to be
nothing original about the
game but there are a couple
of things that make it worth
looking at. Firstly it is fun to
play presented. Secondly,
John Fletcher has proved that
not all good games need to be
written totally in  machine
code, Lunar Ordeal is written
mainly in Basic.
A joystick in  port 2  is
needed to play the game.

HERE AT  YOUR COMMODORE WE
pride ourselves in the quality of the
listings that we print. Obviously we try to
make sure that all programs are correct
but occasionally errors do slip through,
usually because they occur at stages of
production that are out of our control.
This is the page where we come clean
and give you details of errors that have
appeared in recent issues.
MACH
The author of this program made some
late changes to the actual listings. This
meant that the end addresses for each
part should have been altered. Unfor-
tunately we did not spot this. Below you
will ﬁnd the start and end address for
each part_ Don't forget you can save the
program from within the monitor with
the S command.
Monitor - S8200 to $8E75
Macro - $9000 to $9C30
Assembler - $9000 to S9DB8
Some people are also experiencing
problems with the _SER command in the
Macro program. I t  appears that any
labels generated d o  not increase in
numeric order., b u t  rather graphic
characters are placed in the label. This
only happens on some machines and
does not effect the operation of the
program as each label is still unique.
However the author of the program is
looking into this to see if he can ﬁnd the
problem.
March 1986
A couple of weird characters appeared
in the listing of Kung Fu Masters. The
characters should be the Commodore
key and the @sign when you see ii, and a
space when you see the a symbol. Also a

Some people are also experiencing
problems with TOPMON in the same
issue. This is because you have to move

and you should have no problems.
The author of the article '2 for the
C128' made a mistake with the position-
ing of the arrow in PROGRAM 2 line 220.
The arrow should point to the 66 not the

Unfortunately the gremlins crept into
the layout of the Programming the C-16
article. The last section of the program
SYNTHDATA was placed at the end of
the COMPILER b y  mistake. T h e
COMPILER should only go up to line
45150 and lines 20080 onwards should
follow line 20070 of the SYNTHDATA
listing. Also line 55020 of the DEMO

POLAR PETE suffers from a couple of
problems. Firstly a couple of digits have
been swapped in the POKE statement
that you must enter before you RUN the

WORDPROK suffered from duplica-
tion. On page 71 the listing is duplicated
from page 70_ You can ignore the listing
on page 71 and the very last line on page
70 that starts < -128.
As far as we are aware these are all of
the problems in recent issues. Obviously
we ar e trying t o  get listings more
accurate each month. If in the meantime
you do have problems then please do
write in and we will deal with your query
as soon as possible.

design easier.
AFTER PLAYING YOUR THREE THOU-
sandth game of 'Blast the Alien' you'll
probably think that you can do more
with your C64 than just play games. Who
knows you may even get the urge to
write y our  o w n  games t o  occupy
yourself? However, there is one very big
problem - programming. If you've ever
tried to move an object around your
C64's screen you will have found that it's
not quite as easy as the professional pro-
grammers make it look. What you need
is some sort of tool that takes the hard
work out of games design. Well Activi-
sion has come to your rescue with Game
Maker.
Game Maker is actually a number of
tools, each one is aimed at helping you
to des ign a n d  w r ite y our  games
program. The Scene Maker lets you
draw the background for your game.
Sprite Maker allows you to design the
characters that will appear o n  your
screen. Music Maker and Sound Maker
allow y ou t o add music and sound
effects t o  your program. The Editor
allows you to 'write' a program that links
all the above parts together to form a
game.
Write is  probably not quite the
correct word for the way in which you
write programs. You very rarely need to
actually type anything on the keyboard
as all of the programming commands
are selected from the screen with a
joystick. I f  the commands need any
parameters then these are also selected
with a joystick. For example if sprite
number one was a dog then you would
select the 'Sprite 1 is' command. The
computer would then get the catalog of
available sprites from your disk drive,
selecting the dog sprite is simply a
matter of moving the joystick until the
word 'DOG' appears in the window. You
have now told the computer that 'Sprite
1 is DOG'. Simple isn't it?
Some people may say that if you are
going t o  have to program the game
anyway why bother using a program
such as this? Why not just write your
program i n  Basic o r  machine code
instead? If we take a look at the example
program that you build up over the ﬁrst
few pages of the manual the reason for
using a program like this shou Id become
apparent.
olD
Let's assume that WP have used the
different 'Maker' programs to create.i
dog sprite, a jungle background and I
piece of music, in this case the William -
Tell,..erture WViltel). Now lets have
+
loo s i  mpleprog ram. Firstly we want
to s p

let's t h e  DOOtisprite at positi

on the screen. Firstly we need to select
the sprite and then pgoitiOn it. This is
done withl
SPRITE 1 IS DOG
SPRITE 1 X POSITION = 040
SPRITE 1 Y POSITION = 154
Simple isn't it? Now let's animate the
dog and move it across the screen. The
t E 2
following commands do this:
SPRITE 1 ANIMATION SPEED = 030
SPRITE 1 D O  064 RIGHT
SPRITE 1 MOVEMENT SPEED = 045
Altars our program ﬁnished. Simple
tt it? Ii we now RUN the program a
our jungle scene

ﬂóm left to right.
OP T h e  reason for using a program like
this should now be a p p a r e l, "  is so
simple to use.

that every rograrrmer w
'
can o h a v e  two screens to your
me arid secondly, you can only have
eight spifts on the screen at once. If you
ere writing the program in Basic or
achine code you could have as many
screens as the computer's memory will
allow. You can also get more than eight
sprites on the screen at once through
careful programming.
Even so it is possible to write a wide
variety of 'games' with this program.

Obviously the quality of the games that
you design with this program depends
very much on how good the various
Editors are. Well you will be pleased to
know that they are all excellent. In fact
some of them are better than some stand
alone programs that ar e available.
Because the programs are so powerful it
is probably worth dealing with each one
in turn,
Scene Maker
This is the program that allows you to
design your back drops. If you have ever
11 •

used a graphics program then you will
recognise most o f  t h e  available
commands. Draw allows you to sketch
on the screen in one of the available
colours. You can have four different
colours on the screen at any one time.
All drawing is carried out via the joystick.
The functions of Line, Box and Circle are
quite obvious and Fill allows you to
colour in areas of the screen. it is poss-
ible to copy areas of the screen from one
position to another as well as Zoom in on
a speciﬁc area so that it is easier to add
ﬁne detail.
One interesting thing about this
-program is the way that the menu of
commands covers the top half of the

get. Thankfully there are a fair range of
tunes supplied on the Game Maker disk
ranging from William Tell to Happy
Birthday so there should always be
something to suit your game.
Sound maker is the part of the pack-
age that lets you play around with a 'real'
synthesiser. Again the program is under
joystick control and everything is easy to
alter. You can alter the type of wave
form that you are using, alter the attack,
decay, sustain and release of the volume
and put the sound through ﬁlters. If you
don't know what any of the above para-
meters are then I suggest that you just
play around, twiddle the knobs and see
what comes out. It is possible to link
together a number of sound to create
one effect. For example one sound may
be a falling tone, another may be an
explosion. Stick them together and
you've suddenly got bombs falling from
your aircraft.

ign quality out or it. However, it is a
very good step up the ladder of design-
ing your own games. Even if you can't
program, the package will allow you to
- create those masterpieces that you so far
have been unable to do anything about.
Not only does this package let you try
eas out but it will also allow you to
grasp what exactly goes into making up a
game so that when you eventually go it
on your own and try to write your own
programs in either Basic or machine
code you'll know exactly what you must
do.
Game Maker is an extremely well
thought out and easy to use package.
The documentation is simple enough so
that a fairly new computer owner could
be writing games in a few house. All that
is needed is a good imagination.
If you do have some ideas for games
then this is a package that you should
have in your collection.

16 bit  numbers are the
subject of Alien Webb's
l
ARE YOU READY FOR THE DELIGHTS
of 16 bit arithmetic. Even if you're not,
that's what I intend to deal with in this
article.
Up to now we've struggled within
the constraints of eight bits, which, as
you will have realised can become very
messy.
If we work with 16 bit resolution,
suddenly everything is simpler. You will
recall that to increase a value by one, we
can use the INC instruction. Consider
Listing 1:
Listing 1
10 ASSEMBLE 90.1
90 REM *=$C000
100 REM INC 900
110 REM BNE LOOP
120 REM INC 901
130 REM 1 0 0 P : RTS
140 REM 1
150 FOR 1=010300
160 SYS 12*4096
170 PRINIPEEK (9011 *256+PEEK 1900)
180 NEXT
This increments a  16 bit number
stored in locations 900 and 901. The low
byte, 900, is ﬁrst incremented in line 100.
Line 110 checks to see if the low byte has
reached zero. I f i t has, w e  need to
increment the high byte. This will be
obvious if you consider what happens as
the low byte approaches zero:
Low byte H i g h  byte Combined
value
254
255
0
1
11
254
255
256
257
The combined value is the low byte
plus 256 times the high byte.
To reduce a memory location, you
may recall that DEC is used. Listing 2
does this for a 16 bit number:

The principle o f  this routine is
slightly different. The  ﬁrst step is to
check whether the  high byte needs
reducing. This is done in line 110 which
checks for a zero value in the low byte.
Line 130 decrements the low byte every
time.
You will have noted that there is an
intimate relationship between the two
bytes in a  16 bit numbers. Before we
- look a t this, consider what happens
when you add two numbers in decimal.
the two numbers add to above 10, you
carry tens. Remember? Consider this
sum:
The computer works in the same way
in tha t i f  the  result o f  adding tw o
numbers exceeds 255. you have a carry
to tell you about it. This effectively gives
you nine bits and the carry ﬂag is used to
tweak the high bit. Addition with carry is
performed by the instruction ADC.
Imagine that you wish to add the
numbers 7 and 22. In binary these are:
The result is less than 255 so we can
still use an eight bit number. Consider
the addition of 5E4 and $3A:
900000001 and ".4 00011110
CLS
W A  # $E4
ADC # $3A
Suddenly, we have a number greater
than 255 and the  second byte must
be used. The number is split as:
In practical terms, h o w  d o  w e
perform this addition? Consider this
sequence of instructions:
The ﬁrst step is to clear the carry ﬂag
— this prepares the way for the carry.
The accumulator is then loaded with the
number SE4. Lastly. $3A is added to the
accumulator with the carry ﬂag set as
required. The result of this sequence is
to leave the  accumulator holding 30
(binary 00011110) and the carry ﬂag set.
Consider listing 3:

This adds two numbers in 900 and 901
and puts the result in the 16 bit number
in 902 and 903. Lines 100 to 120 clear tht
16 number and lines 130 to 150 add the
two numbers. Line 160 stores the low
byte of the result and lines 180 to 190
store the carry in the high byte.
Subtraction is a simlar process albeit
slightly trickier t o  understand. T h e
relevant instruction is SBC (Subtract
with Carry) and again the carry ﬂag is
used t o  convey information o n  the
result of the subtraction. This time, the
carry is cleared if the subtraction results
in a n underﬂow (negative number).
Don't worry about the  mechanism of
SBC this  time , I 'l l  de a l w i th twos
complimenting and other mysteries in
the future. For now, simply accept that
SBC is the reverse of ADC. Consider
listing 4,

lhe ﬁrst step, Line 100, is to set the
carry ﬂag. Th e  accumulator is  th e n
loaded with the ﬁrst number and lin e
130 subtracts the second number. The
result i s  p u t  in t o  location 901. Try
messing about with the routine and see
what effect it  has when you make B
larger than A.
Let us consider a useful example. The
ﬁrst a n swe r t o  y o u r  la st  mo n t h 's
homework was rather tacky answers at
the end of this article. Listing 5 gives a
method using 16 bit arithmetic.

The key to the routine is the 16 bit
number i n  locations SFR a n d  V C .
Instead of varying the Y register 10 index
this address, we will keep it set to zero
and alter the base address. Lines 110 to
200 set the address to the start of the
screen ($0400). We  then ze ro  th e  Y
register. The main loop puts an asterisk
at t h e  cu rre n tly addressed location
(Lines 220 to  230). Lines 250 and 270
increment t h e  base address b y one,
lines 280 t o  330 compare t h e  base
address to 807E8 (the last address of the
screen) and loop back if it hasn't been
reached. Since we 're  dealing with  16
bits, two comparisons (Lines 290 and 320
are required). This is clearly a  mo re
satisfactory way of working.
Finally. Listings 6 and 7 give routines
for the addition and subtraction of two
16 b it  numbers. O n e  n u mb e r is in
locations 900/901 a n d  t h e  o th e r i n
902/903. The resulting number is left in

I n o w  wa n t t o  brieﬂy discuss an
alternative w a y  o f  ma n ip u la t in g
numbers. Consider the binary number
seven:
' 4 , 0 0
If the bits are shifted left one place
with the left-most bit lost and the right-
most bit set to zero, we get:
00001110
or the number 14. What we have done is
multiply the number by two. Similarly, if
you shift the bits right one place, we
85
divide b y  two . Th e  instructions ASL
(Arithmetic Shift Left) and LSR (Logical
Shift Right) perform these functions, To
multiply a number in  location 900 by
two, you simply use:
ASL 900
to multiply by four, use:
ASI 900
ASL 900
and so on.
In fact, these instructions d o  n o t
lose the end bit. A s  they shift the bit is
pushed into the carry ﬂag:

instructions:

These rotate t h e  b it  pattern b u t
incorporate t h e  c a rry  b i t  i n t o  t h e
number. Consider the pair of bytes:
BYTE 1 B Y T E  2
00000000 10101010 = 170
Let us shift byte two left once and then
roll byte one left once. The left-most bit

C 6 4

of byte two moves into the carry ﬂag and
is then moved into byte one giving:
BYTE I B Y T E  2
00000001 01010100 = 340
Voila! We ' v e  multiplied a  1 6  b it
number by two. The general methods of
doing this are:
Multiply by 2;
ASL Low byte
ROL High byte
Divide by 2:
LSR High byte
ROR Low byte
The shift and roll instructions operate
on th e  accumulator and in  absolute,
zero page, absolute,X and zero page,X

you haven't fully grasped them.

COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by a mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT) means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.
Any character that is accessed by pressing
shift and a  letter will b e  printed as
[Stetter].
[SA] s hift and A

Any character that is  accessed by
pressing the Commodore key and a letter

mnemonic will be followed by a number.
This number is  how many times you
should enter the character. Any number

Any other characters should be easily
recognisable for example CTRL-N means
press CTRL and N  and LEFT-ARROW
means press the left arrow.
Any number of mnemonics can be

means type 10 shift A's 10 spaces and
another 10 shift A's.

Your mission is to take vital
messages to the garrison headquarters.
As you travel through the scrolling landscapes,
you will be under constant ﬁre from the tribesmen bent on
reaching the fort. Y ou will have to use your machine gun with great skill
to get past them. There are seven separate areas of scrolling landscapes before
the fort can be reached and each area requires increasing skill.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
I o use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it  will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is s p a c e  ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer_
Of course, we do also publish Ziarnes
programs, and with classics like s
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card
