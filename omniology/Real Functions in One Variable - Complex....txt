Preface
Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Complex Numbers, cf. also Calculus 1a, Functions of One
Variable. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution strategy I have as far as possible
structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Example 1.10 Calculate (1 + i)8. (Consider the various possibilities of calculation).
A. Calculation of a complex number, where it is indicated that there way of calculation is not unique.
D. Perform the following variants:
1) Apply the modulus and the argument.
2) Apply that (1 + i)8 = {(1 + i)2}4, etc.
3) Apply the binomial formula.
4) Try some other methods.
I. 1) From 1 + i =

= (24)2π = 16.
2) By a small manipulation we get
(1 + i)8 =

(1 + i)24 = (2i)4 = 24i4 = 16.
3) Using the binomial formula we get the following rather ridiculous variant,

=
1 −28 + 70 −28 + 1 = 72 −56 = 16.
4) Finally, one may of course successively calculate
(1 + i)2 = 2i,
(1 + i)3 = −2 + 2i,
. . . ,
(1 + i)8 = 16,
which is even worse than the application of the binomial formula, though one ﬁnally gets the
right result.

Example 1.13 In former days (i.e. before the 1950s) one used tables for addition of complex numbers.
Suppose e.g. that a = rv and b = sw are two given complex numbers, written in the form of modulus-
/argument. We shall also express the complex number a+b in the form of modulus-/argument. Assume
that we have a table of 1 + ϱϕ for given modulus r and principal argument v, when ϱ and ϕ are given.
Describe how one can apply such a table to ﬁnd the modulus and argument of the sum rv + sw.
A. Addition of complex numbers given in the form of modulus-/argument, assuming that the function
(R)α = 1 + (ϱ)ϕ is given in a table.
Adverse element. The description is not possible in a simple way, because one shall encounter a
similar problem without being able to solve the problem.
It is historically not correct to claim that one before the 1950s only added complex numbers in
this way. I do not remember where I found this claim, but I must say that I feel that the usage
belittles without justiﬁcation all mathematicians before 1950.
D. Multiply 1 + (r)v and 1 + (s)w and analyze.

I. The most obvious would be to multiply
(R)α = 1 + (r)v
and
(S)β = 1 + (s)w.
This gives
(RS)α+β
=
{1 + (r)v}{1 + (s)w}
=
1 + (rs)v+w + {(r)v + (s)w}
=
(T)γ + {(r)v + (s)w} ,
where (T)γ = 1 + (rs)v+w is known in its form of modulus-/argument by the assumption. This
gives apparently the result
(r)v + (s)w = (RS)α+β −(T)γ.
The problem here is that we on the right hand side shall subtract two complex numbers written in
the form of modulus-/argument, thus in principle the same task as our starting poin, so we have
ended in a vicious circle.

real numbers.

A. Manipulations with modulus.

Example 2.8 Apply the interpretation of a complex number as a point in the complex plane to sketch
each of the following point sets on a ﬁgure:
1) M1 = {z ∈C | |z −i| < 2}.
2) M2 = {z ∈C | |z −i| = |z + 1|}.
3) M3 = {z ∈C | |z −3| + |z + 4i| = 5}.
It is here useful to consider |a −b| as the distance between the two points in the complex plane,
corresponding to the numbers a and b.
A. Point sets in the complex plane.
D. Interpret |a −b| as the distance between a and b, and sketch the point sets.

Example 2.10 A complex number A = a1 + i a2 may be considered as a vector, which we here for
clarity denote by A. Let · denote the scalar product of vectors, and let ˆA denote the vector which is
obtained by rotating A the angle of π
2 .
1) Prove that if B = i A, then B = ˆA.
2) Prove that for complex numbers A and B we have
A B = A · B −i(A · ˆB).
3) What is the geometric interpretation of
|Im(AB)|?
4) Show that
Re(AB −BA) = 0.
5) Show that
Re{(A + B)(A −B)} = 0
if and only if
|A|2 = |B|2.
6) The results in (5) and (2) give a geometric theorem of parallelograms. Which theorem?
A. Correspondence between the complex plane and vectors in the Euclidean plane.
D. Calculate; if necessary, sketch a ﬁgure; analyze.
I. 1) Since we obtain the vector ˆA by rotating A the angle +π
2 , we get
B = ˆA ∼A · (1) π
2 = iA = B.
2) Straight forward calculations give
AB = (a1 −i a2) · (b1 + i b2) = a1b1 + a2b2 −i{a1(−b2) + a2b1},
and
A · B −i(A · ˆB)
=
(a1, a2) · (b1, b2) −i(a1, a2) · (−b2, b1)
=
a1b1 + a2b2 −i{a1(−b2) + a2b1} = AB.
3) From (2) follows
|Im(AB)|
=
|A · ˆB| = |A| · |B| ·
cos
π
2 + θ

=
|A| · |B| · | sin θ|,
where θ is the angle between A and B.
This number is equal to the area of the parallelogram, which is deﬁned by A and B.
4) From (2) follows
Re{AB −BA} = A · B −B · A = 0.

Figure 7: The parallelogram deﬁned by A and B, and the corresponding vector ˆB.
5) By a calculation,
(A + B)(A −B)
=
(A + B)(A −B)
=
|A|2 −|B|2 −(AB −BA),
thus, according to (4),
Re{(A + B)(A −B)} = |A|2 −|B|2.
It is immediately seen that
Re

(A + B)(A −B)

= 0
if and only if
|A| = |B|.
6) According to (2),
(A + b)(A −B) = (A + B) · (A −B) −i((A + B) · (
ˆ
A −B)),
hence,
Re

(A + B)(A −B)

= (A + B) · (A −B).
According to (5) this expression is equal to 0, if and only if |A| = |B|.
It follows from the above that
(A + B) · (A −B) = 0,
if and only if |A| = |B|, i.e. if and only if the parallelogram deﬁned by A and B is a en rhombus.
The condition is also equivalent to that the parallelogram deﬁned by A −B and A + B is a
rectangle, and thus equivalent to the theorem that the diagonals, 2|A| and 2|B|, have the same
length.

Figure 8: The triangle T with its corners 0, a and b, and with the height h from b onto the line 0a.
Example 2.11 In the complex plane we choose two complex numbers a and b, which together with
0 form the three corners of a triangle T. The angle from a to b measured in the positive direction is
called θ.
1) Show that
ab = |a||b| cos θ + i|a||b| sin θ.
2) Apply (1) to prove the cosine relation
|a −b|2 = |a|2 + |b|2 −2|a||b| cos θ.
Hint: Start e.g. by proving that
ab + ab = 2 Re(ab).
3) Apply (1) to prove that the area A(T) of the triangle T can be expressed by
A(T) =


2 Im(ab)
 .
4) Let z1, z2, z3 be three complex numbers in the complex plane, and let T ′ denote the triangle of
corners z1, z2 and z3. Prove that the area of T ′ is given by
A(T ′) =

1
2 Im {z1z2 + z2z3 + z3z1}
 .
A. Triangle in the complex plane. Area of this triangle.
D. Sketch a ﬁgure. Use polar coordinates. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) If a = r eiϕ and b = R ei(ϕ+θ), then
ab
=
r e−iϕ · R ei(ϕ+θ) = |a| · |b| · eiθ
=
|a| · |b| · cos θ + i |a| · |b| · sin θ.

2) It is immediately seen that
ab + ab = ab + ab = 2 Re(ab).
Combining this result with (1) we get
|a −b|2
=
(a −b)(a −b) = |a|2 + |b|2 −ab −ab
=
|a|2 + |b|2 −2|a||b| cos θ.
3) The area of T is given by 1
2 |a| · h, where a geometric consideration shows that h = |b|| sin θ| is
the length of the height from b onto the side 0a. When we apply the imaginary part from (1),
we get

Figure 9: The triangle T ′ and the translated triangle T with one of its corners in 0.
4) By a parallel transform of the amount −z1 we see that
A(T ′) = A(T),

The equation of second degree
Example 3.1 1) Find the complex numbers z, which satisfy the equation z = z2.
2) For which complex numbers z is z2 = |z|2?
A. Solution of non-typical equations.
D. Compare the moduli and the arguments.
I. 1) Obviously, z = 0 is a solution.
When z ̸= 0, the moduli must still be identical, thus |z| = |z|2, i.e. |z| = 1.
Then by a
multiplication by z,
z3 = zz = |z|2 = 1 = (1)2pπ,
z = (1) 2pπ
3 ,
and we see that the solutions are
z = 0,
z = 1,
z = −1
2 + i
√
3
2 ,
z = −1
2 −i
√
3
2 .
Notice that we obtain four solutions, which is not a contradiction to the fundamental theorem
of algebra, because z2 −z is not a polynomial in Z.
2) By putting z = x + iy we immediately get
x2 −y2 + 2ixy = x2 + y2,
and then by a splitting into real and imaginary part,
2y2 = 0
and
2xy = 0.
Hence, y = 0 and x ∈R, i.e. z ∈R.
C. We see in both cases that the found solutions are in fact correct.
Example 3.2 Find in the form z = a + ib, a, b ∈R, the solutions of the equation
z2 + 2z −2 −4i = 0.
A. Equation of second degree.
D. Solve the equation. This can be done in more than one way, although the methods in principle
rely on the same idea.
I. First variant. From (z + 1)2 = z2 + 2z + 1, we get the inspiration of performing the following
rearrangement,
0
=
z2 + 2z −2 −4i = (z2 + 2z + 1) −(3 + 4i)
=
(z + 1)2 −(4 + i2 + 4i)
=
(z + 1)2 −(2 + i)2 = (z + 3 + i)(z −1 −i).
It is immediately seen that the roots are −3 −i and 1 + i.

Second variant. An unconscious application of the solution formula from high school gives the
awkward solutions
z = −1 ±
√
1 + 2 + 4i = −1 ±
√
3 + 4i.
We assume that √3 + 4i = a + ib for some a, b ∈R. Then by squaring,
a2 −b2 + i 2ab = 3 + 4i,
i.e.
a2 −b2 = 3,
2ab = 4,
thus
(a2 + b2)2 = (a2 −b2)2 + (2ab)2 = 9 + 16 = 25,
from which a2 + b2 = 5. Together with a2 −b2 = 3 this gives a2 = 4 and b2 = 1. Now, ab > 0,
so a and b have the same sign, i.e. √3 + 4i = ±(2 + i). Then by insertion
z = −1 ± (2 + i) =

−3 −i,
1 + i
C. The solutions of normed equations of second degree are checked by using that the sum of the roots
is the coeﬃcient of z with opposite sign, and the product of the roots is equal to the constant term.
In the present case we get
(−3 −i) + (1 + i) = −2,
(−3 −i)(1 + i) = −3 + 1 + i(−3 −1) = −2 −4i.
Q.E.D.

C. The sum of the roots is

i.e. the coeﬃcient of z of the opposite sign,
The product of the roots is

i.e. equal to the constant term. Q.E.D.

A. A non-normed complex equation of second degree.
D. First multiply by −i; then solve the equation.

C. The sum of the roots is
(2 −3i) + (1 + i) = 3 −2i,
which is the coeﬃcient of z of the opposite sign in the normed equation (2).
The product of the roots is
(2 −3i) · (1 + i) = 2 + 3 −3i + 2i = 5 −i,
which is equal to the constant term in (2).
Thus, the solutions are correct for (2). Finally, when (2) is multiplied by i, we obtain the equivalent
original equation.

Example 3.6 Let ±√w denote the two solutions of the equation z2 = w. Find the values of the
following expressions written in the form a + ib:

2) ±

3) ±

A. Splitting into real and imaginary part by a square root. A very diﬃcult example!
D. Let z2 = w for given w. Insert z = a + ib and ﬁnd two equations for a and b. Then ﬁnd in each
case the corresponding equation without the symbols ±√·.
I. First some general theory.
Let z2 = w = u + iv, where u and v are given real numbers. If we put z = a + ib, we get by
insertion and separation into real and imaginary parts that
a2 −b2 = u
og
2ab = v.
Then
(a2 + b2)2 = (a2 −b2)2 + {2ab}2 = u2 + v2,
and thus
a2 + b2 =
 
u2 + v2 = |w|.
Since we already have that a2 −b2 = u, we get
a2 = |w| + u
2
,
b2 = |w| −u
2
,
2ab = v,
and we can ﬁnd z = a + ib. The latter equation is used to check whether a and b have the same
or opposite sign.
1) z = ±√1 + i.
Here, z2 = (a + ib)2 = 1 + i, thus u = 1 and |w| =
√
2, and ab > 0. It follows from the above
that
a = ±

Example 3.7 Solve the equation of second degree, z2 −4iz −1 + 4i = 0. Then ﬁnd the roots of the
polynomial
P(z) = z4 −4iz2 −1 + 4i.
A. An equation of second degree and another one in disguise.
D. Solve the equations, either by means of a formula or by inspection.
I. 1) We get by inspection,
z2 −4iz −1 + 4i = (z2 −1) −4i(z −1) = (z −1)(z + 1 −4i),
so the ﬁrst polynomial has the roots −1 + 4i and 1.
2) When we here replace z2 by z, we obtain the equation in (1). We therefore conclude that
P(z) = 0, if and only if either
(i) z2 = 1,
or
(ii) z2 = −1 + 4i.
a) When z2 = 1, the roots are ±1.
b) Then we solve z2 = −1 + 4i. If we put z = a + ib, we get

Then ﬁnd all complex solutions y of the equation

0 = z2 −z + 1 −i = (z2 + 1) −(z + i) = (z + i)(z −1 −i),
thus the roots are 1 + i and −i.

The binomial equation
Example 4.1 Let w be a solution of the equation wn = 1. Show that when w ̸= 1, then
1 + w + w2 + · · · + wn−1 = 0.
A. Prove an identity.
D. The trick is to multiply by w −1 ̸= 0.
I. By the multiplication by w −1 ̸= 0, followed by a calculation and a reduction we get by the
assumption that
(w −1)(wn−1 + wn−2 + · · · + w + 1)
= (wn −wn−1) + (wn−1 −wn−2) + · · · + (w2 −w) + (w −1)
= wn −1 = 0.
Then one of the factors must be 0. Now, w −1 ̸= 0, so we conclude that
1 + w + w2 + · · · + wn−1 = 0.
Example 4.2 Solve the equations

(2) z3 = i.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

1) Indicate the roots of the binomial equation z5 = −1 in polar coordinates. Sketch the roots in the
complex plane.
2) The real polynomial x5 + 1 can be written as a product of a polynomial of ﬁrst degree and two
polynomials of second degree, all of which have real coeﬃcients.
Show that the two polynomials of second degree are
x2 −ax + 1
and
x2 −bx + 1,
where
a = 2 cos π
5
og
b = 2 cos 3π
5 .
3) Apply the factorization of x5 + 1 to ﬁnd a + b and ab. Then set up an equation of second degree,
having a and b as its roots.
4) Find the exact values of cos π

5 .
A. Calculation of cos π

5 by means of complex numbers.
D. Follow the guidelines. We have here several variants.
I. 1) From

p ∈Z,
we get immediately that the roots in polar coordinates are

,
p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
When p = 2 we get z2 = −1, and since z5 + 1 has real coeﬃcients, the other roots must
necessarily be pairwise complex conjugated,
z0 = cos π
5 + i · sin π
5 = z4,
z1 = cos 3π
5 + i · sin 3π
5 = z3,

and z2 = −1.

3) First variant. Since
x5 + 1 = (x + 1)(x2 −ax + 1)(x2 −bx + 1),
we get for x ̸= −1 that
(x2 −ax + 1)(x2 −bx + 1) = x5 + 1
x + 1 = x4 −x3 + x2 −x + 1.
On the other hand,
(x2 −ax + 1)(x2 −bx + 1)
= x4 −(a + b)x3 + (2 + ab)x2 −(a + b)x + 1.
When we identify the coeﬃcients we get
a + b = 1,
and
2 + ab = 1,
i.e.
ab = −1.
This means that a and b are the roots of the λ polynomial
(λ −a)(λ −b) = λ2 −(a + b)λ + ab = λ2 −λ −1.
Second variant. By a straight forward calculation we get
x5 + 1
=
(x + 1)(x2 −ax + 1)(x2 −bx + 1)
=
(x+1)(x4−(a+b)x3+(2+ab)x2−(a+b)x+1)
=
x5+(1−a−b)x4+(2+ab−a−b)x3
+(2+ab−a−b)x2+(1−a−b)x+1.
By identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients we get
 1−a−b=0,
2+ab−a−b=0,
i.e.
 a+b=1,
ab=a+b−2=1−2=−1,
hence a + b = 1 and ab = −1.
Then continue as in the ﬁrst variant,
(λ −a)(λ −b) = λ2 −(a + b)λ + ab = λ2 −λ −1,
thus a = 2 cos π
5 and b = 2 cos 3π
5 are the roots of the equation
λ2 −λ −1 = 0.
4) Since a = 2 cos π
5 > 0 and b = 2 cos 3π
5 < 0 are the roots of the equation
λ2 −λ −1 = 0,
we get by the usual solution formula,
λ = 1

and ﬁnd such numbers.
1) q(t) = cos 3t + sin 3t,
2) q(t) = e−t cos 2t −e−t sin 2t,
3) q(t) = et cos t −3et sin t,
4) q(t) = k1eαt cos βt + k2eαt sin βt.
In (4) the constants k1, k2, α and β are real.
A. Reduction of mixed exponential/trigonometric expressions to pure exponentials.
D. The easiest way is to start from (4), because the other three cases can be derived from (4).
However, for pedagogical reasons we solve the example in the given succession.
I. First notice that since

we have

Example 5.3 Prove that ez ̸= 0 for every z ∈C.
A. Exponential.
D. Prove that |ez| > 0 for every z ∈C.
I. If z = x + iy, x, y ∈R, then
|ez| = |ex+iy| = |ex| · |eiy| = ex > 0,
thus ez ̸= 0 for every z ∈C.
Example 5.4 Apply Moivre’s formula to express cos 3v and sin 3v by cos v and sin v.
Then use the addition formulæ to express sin 4v by cos v and sin v.
A. Trigonometric relations.
D. Apply Moivre’s formula.
I. From
cos 3v + i sin 3c = (cos v + i sin v)3
= cos3 v + 3i cos2 v sin v −3 cos v sin2 v −i sin3 v,
we get by a splitting into real and imaginary part,
cos 3v = cos3 v −3 cos v sin2 v = 4 cos3 v −3 cos v,
sin 3v = 3 cos2 v sin v −sin3 v = 3 sin v −4 sin3 v.
Then by the addition formulæ,
sin 4v
=
sin(3v + v)
=
sin 3v cos v + cos 3v sin v
=
3 cos3 v sin v −sin3 v cos v + cos3 v sin v −3 cos v sin3 v
=
4 cos3 v sin v −4 sin3 v cos v.
Remark. Notice that we have alternatively,
sin 4v
=
2 sin 2v cos 2v = 4 sin v cos v(cos2 v −sin2 v)
=
4 sin v cos3 v −4 sin3 v cos v.

Since the periphery angle is x

an rectangular triangle with the hypothenuse of length 2, hence the modulus is 2 cos x

Example 5.11 Let F(t) and G(t) be complex functions in the real variable t. Put
F1(t) = Re(F(t)),
F2(t) = Im(F(t)),
G1(t) = Re(G(t)),
G2(t) = Im(G(t)).
It is well-known that
F ′(t) = G(t)
if and only if
F ′
1(t) = G1(t) and F ′
2(t) = G2(t).
1) Let F(t) =

Find F ′(t), and then calculate the integrals

Example 5.12 Consider a linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order
dx
dt + a x = q(t),
t ∈I,
where a is a constant. It is well-known that we have a standard solution formula for such a diﬀerential
equation. We shall in this example show how one in special cases can ﬁnd a solution by applying the
complex exponential.
1) First consider the diﬀerential equation
(3) dx
dt + 2 x = cos ωt,
t ∈R,
where ω > 0 is a constant. Consider the complex equation
dx
dt + 2 x = eiωt,
t ∈R.
Find a solution of the form x = c · eiωt of this diﬀerential equation and then use this solution to
ﬁnd the complete solution of (3).
2) Similarly, ﬁnd the complete solution of
dx
dt + 2 x = sin ωt,
t ∈R.
3) As an example from the applications we consider a network containing the resistance R, a coil of
induction L, and a voltage generator of the voltage E(t) at time t.
We shall put E(t) = E0 cos ωt.
It is possible to show that the current intensity I(t) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
(4) L dI
dt + R I(t) = E0 cos ωt.
Find by means of the complex exponential a solution I(t) = I0(t) of this diﬀerential equation, and
then the complete solution.
In practice one is only interested in I0(t) and not in the other solutions of (4). Explain why.
A. Linear diﬀerential equations of ﬁrst order of constant coeﬃcients. There are given some guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) By insertion of x = c · eiωt into the left hand side of (3)we get
dx
dt + 2 x = c i ω eiωt + 2 c eiωt = (2 + iω)c eiωt,
which is equal to eiωt for c =

2 + iω = 2 −iω

that

Example 5.13 In this example we show that if a complex function h(z) ̸= 0 satisﬁes the two proper-
ties:
K 1. h (z1 + z2) = h (z1) · h (z2) for every z1, z2 ∈C,
K 2.
d
dt{h(R · t)} = R · h(R · t) for every R ∈C and t ∈R,
then er h(z) is equal to the complex exponential. We therefore assume that h(z) satisﬁes K 1 and
K 2.
1) Apply K 1 to show that h(0) = 1.
2) Apply K 2 and (1) to show that
h(t) = et
for t ∈R.
3) Put h(i · t) = α(t) + i β(t). Apply K 2 to prove that
α′(t) = −β(t)
and
β′(t) = α(t)
for t ∈R.
4) Apply (1) and (3) to prove that
h(i t) = cos t + i sin t
for t ∈R.
5) Finally, apply K 1, (2) and (4) to prove that
h(x + i y) = ex{cos y + i sin y}
for all x, y ∈R.
A. A theoretical derivation of the exponential. There are given some guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) If we choose z1 = z2 = 0, then it follows from K 1 that
h(0) = h(0 + 0) = h(0) · h(0) = h(0)2,
so we have either h(0) = 0 or h(0) = 1.
If h(0) = 0, then it follows from K 1 that
h(z) = h(z + 0) = h(z) · h(0) = 0,
hence h ≡0, which was excluded by the assumptions. Therefore, h(0) = 1.
2) Then let R = 1. It follows from K 2 that h(t), t ∈R, satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
dh
dt = h(t),
with the complete solution h(t) = c · et. Then it follows from (1) that h(0) = 1 = c · e0 = c,
hence c = 1, or
h(t) = et,
t ∈R.

3) According to K 2,
d
dt h(i · t) = i h(i t),
which can also be written
α′(t) + i β′(t) = i{α(t) + i β(t)} = −β(t) + i α(t).
By a separation into real and imaginary parts we get
α′(t) = −β(t),
β′(t) = α(t),
for t ∈R.
4) It follows from (3) that α(t) and β(t) both satisfy the diﬀerential equation
(5) d2x
dt2 + x = 0.
They must therefore be among the solutions of (5). The characteristic polynomial R2 + 1 has
the roots ±i, so the complete solution is
c1 cos t + c2 sin t.
From (1) we get h(0) = 1 = α(0) + i β(0), hence
α(0) = 1 = c1 · 1 + c2 · 0,
i.e. α(t) = cos t + c2 sin t. Then it follows from this and from (3) that
β(t =) = −α′(t) = −(−sin t) −c2 · cos t = sin t −c2 cos t.
From β(0) = 0 = 0 −c2 we get c2 = 0, so
α(t) = cos t
and
β(t) = sin t.
All things put together we have
h(i t) = cos t + i sin t,
t ∈R.
5) Finally,
h(x + i y) = h(x) · h(i y) = ex(cos y + i sin y),
where we in the ﬁrst equality have used K 1, and in the second one, (2) and (4).

A. Complex numbers and equations.

and the set of solutions is the union of the two straight lines y = x and y = −x.
Remark. It is also possible to ﬁnd the solutions by using polar coordinates, z = r exp(iϕ),

2ϕ = ±π
2 + 2pπ,

ϕ = ±π

Roots in a polynomial
Example 6.1 Let
P(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0
be any complex polynomial.
1) Show that there exist two polynomials Q(z) and R(z) of real coeﬃcients, such that
P(z) = Q(z) + i R(z),
z ∈C.
2) Show that if x0 is a real p-tuple root in both Q(z) and R(z), then x0 is also a p-tuple root in P(z).
Do we also have a converse result?
3) Prove that if P(z) has real roots, then these are common roots of the two real polynomials Q(z)
and R(z).
4) Solve the equation
z5 −2z4 + z3 −iz2 + 2iz −i = 0.
A. Real roots in complex polynomials.
D. There is a guideline, and ﬁnally the theory is applied in (4).
I. 1) This is a trivial statement,
P(z)
=
anzn + · · · + a1z + a0
=
({Re an} zn + · · · + {Re a1} z + Re a0)
+i ({Im an} zn + · · · + {Im a1} z + Im a0)
=
Q(z) + i R(z).
2) According to the assumption,
Q(z) = (z −x0)pQ1(z)
og
R(z) = (z −x0)pR1(z),
s˚a
P(z) = (z −x0)p {Q1(z) + i R1(z)} .
It follows immediately that x0 is a p-tuple root in P(z).
Assume conversely that
P(z) = (z −x0)pP1(z) = Q(z) + i R(z).
If z = x is real, then we immediately get
(x −x0)p Re P1(x) = Q(x)
and
(x −x0)p Im P1(x) = R(x),
and x0 is a p-tuple root in the two real polynomials Q(x) and R(x). Since the coeﬃcients are
not changed, when x is replaced by z, this also holds for Q(z) and R(z).
Remark. It is here important that x0 is real. If z0 ∈C \ R is a p-tuple root, the result does
not hold in general.
Example. If P(z) = z −i, then Q(z) = z and R(z) = −1. It is obvious that z = i is a root of
P(z), and of course neither a root in Q(z) nor in R(z). ♦

Example 6.2 Let the polynomial P(x) be given by
P(x) = x4 −2x3 −x2 + 2x + 10.
It is given that P(x) has a root of the form λ(1 + i), λ ∈R.
1) Find λ ∈R, such that P(λ(1 + i)) = 0.
2) Find all the complex roots of P(x).
A. Complex roots of a polynomial.
D. Put x = λ(1 + i) and ﬁnd λ ∈R. Then exploit that λ(1 −i) must also be a root.
I. 1) When x = λ(1 + i), λ ∈R, we get
P(λ(1 + i))
=
λ4(1 + i)4 −2λ3(1 + i)3 −λ2(1 + i)2 + 2λ(1 + i) + 10
=
λ4(2i)2 −2λ3 · 2i(1 + i) −λ2 · 2i + 2λ + 2iλ + 10
=
−4λ4 + 4λ3 + 2λ + 10 + i

−4λ3 −2λ2 + 2λ

.
This expression is zero, if and only if both the real part and the imaginary part are zero, i.e. if
and only if
2λ4 −2λ3 −λ −5 = 0 and 2λ3 + λ2 −λ = λ(2λ2 + λ −1) = 0.

From the latter equation we get the possibilities
λ = 0,
λ = −1
and
λ = 1
2.
Of these only λ = −1 also fulﬁls the ﬁrst equation. We can only conclude that z = −1 −i is a
root.
2) Since the polynomial has real coeﬃcients, and z = −1−i is a root, we must have that z = −1+i
is also a root, hence
(x + 1)2 + 1 = x2 + 2x + 2
must be a divisor in P(x). By division we get
P(x) = x4 −2x3 −x2 + 2x + 10 = (x2 + 2x + 2)(x2 −4x + 5).
Finally we conclude that the roots are
x = −1 ± i
og
x = 2 ± i.
Example 6.3 1) Sketch the set S of complex numbers z, which satisfy the inequality
|z −(2 + i)| ≤3.
Consider the polynomial
P(z) = z4 + 2z3 −z2 + 2isz + (11 + s2),
where s is a complex constant.
2) Determine the values of s, for which z = 1 + i is a root of P(z), and mark them on the ﬁgure in
(1).
3) Find for s ∈S all complex roots in P(z).
A. Complex numbers, and a polynomial containing a complex parameter.
D. Apply the geometric interpretation; insert the root and solve the equation in s.
I. 1) The set S of complex numbers z, satisfying
|z −(2 + i)| ≤3,
is the closed disc of centre z0 = 2 + i and radius 3.
2) Insertion of the root z = 1 + i in P(z) gives the equation of second degree in s:
0
=
(1 + i)4 + 2(1 + i)3 −(1 + i)2 + 2i(1 + i)s + 11 + s2
=
(2i)2 + 2(1 + i) · 2i −2i + 2(−1 + i)s + 11 + s2
=
−4 −4 + 2i −2(1 −i)s + 11 + s2
=
s2 −2(1 −i)s + (1 −i)2 −(1 −i)2 + 3 + 2i
=
{s −(1 −i)}2 + 3 + 4i
=
{s −(1 −i)}2 + (2 + i)2

It follows from |i −(2 + i)| = 2 < 3 and |2 −3i −(2 + i)| = 4 > 3 that only s = i belongs to
the set S.
3) When s = i (∈S), then
P(z) = z4 + 2z3 −z2 −2z + 10
is a polynomial of real coeﬃcients. We know already that z = 1 + i is a root, thus z = 1 −i
must also be a root, corresponding to the fact that
(z −1 −i)(z −1 + i) = z2 −2z + 2
is a divisor in P(z). By division we get
P(z)
=
z4 + 2z3 −z2 −2z + 10
=
(z2 −2z + 2)(z2 + 4z + 5),
and the roots are

Example 6.4 1) Find all complex roots of the polynomial
P(z) = z7 + z6 + 8z + 8.
2) Let w1 and w2 denote the two non-real roots of numerically smallest principal argument. Write
w1 and w2 in the form a + ib (a, b ∈R), and calculate w1 + w2 and w1w2.
3) Write the polynomial P(z) as a product of four real polynomials, where one is of ﬁrst degree, and
the others are of second degree.
A. Polynomial with complex roots.
D. Find the roots by going through the succession (3), (1), (2) of the questions above.
I. 3. We get immediately the factorization
P(z)
=
z7 + z6 + 8z + 8
=
(z + 1)(z6 + 8)
=
(z + 1)(z2 + 2)(z4 −2z2 + 4)
=
(z + 1)(z2 + 2)(z4 + 4z2 + 4 −6z2)
=
(z + 1)(z2){(z2 + 2)2 −(
√
6 z)2}
=
(z + 1)(z2 + 2)(z2 +
√
6 z + 2)(z2 −
√
6 z + 2).
1. It follows from the factorization that the roots are
z = −1,
z = ±i
√
2,
z = 1
2 (−
√
6 ± i
√
2),
z = 1
2 (
√
6 ± i
√
2).
2. The meaning of the example is here that we shall solve the binomial equation
z6 = −8 = 23eiπ
in polar coordinates, where z = −1 has the principal argument π. Thus we get
z =
√
2 · exp

i π
6 + ip π
3

,
p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
The two non-real roots of numerically smallest principal values are
w1 =

2 ·

cos π
6 + i sin π
6
	
=

2 + i

w2 =

2 ·

cos π
6 −i sin π
6
	
=

6
2 −i
√

2 .
We immediately get from this that
w1 + w2 =
√
6
and
w1 · w2 =
√
2 · ei π
6 ·
√
2 e−i π
6 = 2,
so w1 and w2 are the roots of the polynomial z2 −
√
6 z + 2, which also can be seen from the
factorization in (3).
3. Just in case, we calculate (3) once more, because the original task was the following: According
to the above, z2 −
√
6 z + 2 is a divisor, and it is easy to see that z2 + 2 is also a divisor. Then
by division by polynomials,
P(z) = (z + 1)(z2 + 2)(z2 +
√
6 z + 2)(z2 −
√
6 z + 2).

Example 6.6 Let
P(z) = z4 + 2z3 + 3z2 + 2z + 2.
We are given the information that z = i is a root of P(z).
Prove that P(z) can be written as a product of two polynomials of second degree, and then ﬁnd all
roots of P(z).
A. Factorization of a polynomial of fourth degree.
D. Solve either by inspection or by using the information that z = i is a root.
I. First variant. By inspection we get that
P(z)
=
z4 + 2z3 + 3z2 + 2z + 2
=
(z4 + 2z3 + 2z2) + (z2 + 2z + 2)
=
(z2 + 1)(z2 + 2z + 2),
and we see that the four roots are
i,
−i,
−1 + i,
−1 −i.
Second variant. Since z = i is a root, and P(z) has real coeﬃcients, we also have that z = −i is
a root, so
(z −i)(z + i) = z2 + 1
is a divisor in P(z). By division we get
P(z) = (z2 + 1)(z2 + 2z + 2),
and it follows again that the four simple roots are
i,
−i,
−1 + i,
−1 −i.
