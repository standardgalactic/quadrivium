Bonus DVD #1  
Group Integration Induction To Give You Super 
Confidence On The Streets 
 
 
Bonus Hypnotic Induction 
 
You can sit up for a bit if you like or just lie straight back down. It doesn’t really matter. 
Those of you who are sitting up, make sure you look around yourself and just check the 
area around yourself because if at some point during the next proceedings you decide 
that sitting up is a bit too tedious, I’ll understand. Just make sure that when you do 
recline, you don’t end up reclining in someone’s lap. It might be a little bit exhilarating 
for them but a bit too much for what we’re doing right now. 
 
Just check the environment around you so that you have a sense of where you can 
orient and if you want to lie back straightaway, that’s fine. If you want to sit up for a 
while and then crash out later, that’s fine. If you want to sit up and stay sitting up 
throughout, that’s fine. If you want to sit in a chair, that’s all good. 
 
Really, I guess what I’m saying at this point is just make yourself comfortable. Make 
yourself as comfortable as you possibly can right now.  
 
One of the things that will increase your comfort as we go through this process will be 
for you to make sure that your limbs are, generally speaking uncrossed. Just release 
pressure from them and let the blood flow and circulate smoothly. It will help you to 
increase the blood flow and the benefits that it brings. 
 
Whenever you need to, just make yourself really comfortable. Again, just part of your 
orienting response, just make sure that there’s really nothing that you need to think 
about, nothing that you need to do, nothing that you need to pay attention to, just the 
comfort of being in here. That’s right. 
 
As most of you have done already, just go ahead and close your eyes if you haven’t done 
so already and enjoy the peacefulness that closing your eyes can bring. It’s a wonderful 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
5 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
thing to be able to just have your eyes closed and relax letting your attention drift 
around. Whatever ideas and experiences are of importance to you right now or are 
assisting the relaxation, the comfort is continuing to deepen right now. 
 
You’ve had important experiences in this training already. You’ve felt the excitement of 
doing hypnosis well. You’ve felt the anticipation of going off on the streets, meeting new 
people and doing hypnosis in public live. You’ve been through somewhat of a roller 
coaster of experiences and through it all your skills have increased.  
 
Just consider how much you’ve learned in this training. Consider all the things that you 
already know how to do. Enjoy the comfort of learning. It really is easy because right 
now there is nothing for you to do other than to go into a trance deeply, comfortably. 
Let your unconscious mind do the learning.  
 
In a lifetime we learn so many things without knowing how. They’re just there for us 
when we need it. You have a wealth of experiences that you can draw upon at any time 
that will help you through even the toughest of situations.  
 
An unconscious mind on your side, some part of you that has protected you throughout 
your life, looked after you and made sure that ultimately things turned out just right, 
and it’s good to have these experiences just as it’s good to build new ones.  
 
If you and I were to take a walk somewhere pleasant and soothing, we could choose to 
go anywhere we wished. I might enjoy showing you some pleasant scene of nature, a 
path or trail leading into woods with green leaves shining with sunlight, glowing as 
though they had a light of their own.  
 
This path could lead deep inside the forest and you could enjoy walking there as I 
pointed out some sights to you – a flower just over there, an unusual bird, the 
wonderful sound of dreams as the leaves rustle in the breeze. 
 
At some point we might find a pleasant spot on which to rest. Close your eyes and go 
deep asleep and have dreams that allow us to integrate important experiences. Your 
unconscious mind can take any experience and learn from it, can take any skill and 
master it, can take any idea and understand it, take any tool and use it. 
 
Whilst you’re having a dream, you might as well let your unconscious do the work for a 
change. You might as well dream something that will allow you to integrate all that you 
have learned and more because each one of you came here for a reason, and there are 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
6 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
probably reasons that you came here and that you decided to learn these skills that 
you’re not even aware of yet. 
 
All that a reason needs is a resource and then a dream can become reality. So, go ahead 
and allow your mind to drift comfortably, allowing all the sounds to just pass you by, my 
voice staying with you, guiding you, having a deep healing experience in which an 
important dream or goal for you can become real. And all that it takes is to trust that 
your unconscious will select the right experiences, the right resources for you to learn 
from and make important changes. 
 
I can be silent as this happens, and you don’t need to be aware of anything other than 
how good it feels to just drift. That’s right. That’s right. Trust your unconscious and let it 
all happen quite naturally. No need to think anything, do anything. 
 
I can even be silent for a while, and in that silence even the smaller sounds from the 
environment around you just lead you deeper into this dream for change, integration, 
healing some important aspect of yourself and you can keep going deeper and deeper, 
allowing that to happen. 
 
A long time can pass before you need to do anything on this journey. Rest assured I’ll 
remind you long before it’s time to come back. Right now just rest. Go deeper and let 
your unconscious help you make this important change. That’s right. That’s right. That’s 
right. Deeper and deeper, more and more. 
 
Even as my voice fades out, continue on this journey until I ask you to return. Right now 
keep drifting, keep changing. Allow it to happen. That’s right, deeper and deeper. That’s 
right, deeper and deeper. That’s right. Continue to drift, learn and change. That’s right. 
Further and further, more and more. That’s right. A little more than that. That’s right. 
More and more. 
 
Continue right along. Nothing for you to do but trust your unconscious. Positive changes 
and every human being has energy levels. There’s the physical energy that moves your 
muscles, allows you to travel through the world; and there is mental energy that allows 
you to think thoughts, solve problems and think ahead.  
 
We all have emotional energy. Feelings need their own sauce like an inner battery that 
feeds it. This is a good time to replenish all that energy and make it positive, make it 
something really worthwhile. Some find that a warm soothing shower replenishes them. 
For others it’s simply sitting or lying in the sun and feeling that warmth, all that light 
come rushing towards them.

A single beam of light could expand, become larger and larger as it approaches each one 
of us and do so much more than simply replenish our inner levels of energy. It might 
even straighten us out in places where there are kinks. Like a garden hose, the water 
can’t flow right if there’s a kink or pressure at some point constraining that hose, and 
our energy levels can flow so much more naturally when the constraints, the blocks are 
removed. 
 
These could be emotional blocks or mental blocks in the form of ideas or something 
completely different, and you could rest there and feel some form of energy cycling 
through you like your breathing in and out, in and out with its own rhythm. Those cycles 
could naturally straighten you out like a good stretch can release tense muscles. 
 
Where would you discover a source of something that can straighten all this out as it 
replenishes, recharges, refreshes, refills you all the way up? It could come from 
anywhere – a soothing breeze on a hot sunny day, that ray of sun that expands and 
grows larger, and where would it touch you first?  
 
Perhaps you could feel that warmth in the top of your head replenishing, relaxing, 
refreshing, healing and straightening you out. It can’t be long before it reaches your 
eyes, your nose, your cheeks, and all your expressions can just melt away, a whole new 
face waiting to be discovered. Let your muscles relax as all the reasons for carrying 
around tension, stress and anxiety just disappear. 
 
The warm healing light massaging your neck, your shoulders, letting go, a cycle 
developing, a natural rhythm of health, maybe even experienced as a tingling or 
vibrating, resetting the whole body, mind, emotions, spirit, everything, a light drawing 
down through your chest, clearing up lungs, easy to breathe now. Feel each breath 
getting easier, stronger, lighter and deeper as though your whole chest was aglow. 
 
Those arms just melting away as though shedding an old skin, taking off an old suit or 
dress, piece of clothing so that something new can be worn, and all hypnotists go 
through a stage when they change and become something new. 
 
Consider a cocoon that a caterpillar has spun around itself preparing for change. It’s safe 
and warm in here, and what does a caterpillar experience when it makes a change? Can 
it be its arms or legs or torso? At some point the whole body must vanish.

Can it be its senses, what it sees, what it hears or feels, and yet it must be aware, aware 
enough to change and go right on making that change to a much different, lighter, 
better, more colorful. That’s a good thing.  
 
There’s a cycle for everything, a rhythm, a natural flow like a warm soothing light 
touching your back, your spine, realigning everything. New changes resetting everything 
all the way to the hips, the stomach, all the internal organs, curious to know how often 
cells replace themselves. A liver cell, kidney, intestine, stomach, spleen constantly re-
growing itself.  
 
It could be a whole new you. Just a natural cycle with a comfortable light guiding, 
replenishing, refreshing, rejuvenating through the bones and the skeleton, and bones 
have a life of their own – marrow, tissue constantly growing, producing the cells you 
needed to fight off infection, stay healthy. 
 
The interesting thing about bones is that they get stronger each time they’re tested. 
Gravity alone strengthens your bones. Each step sending a mild wave of force through 
your body from the ground up strengthens your bones. Each bump, scrape, clash tells 
your bones to get stronger, healthier, more resilient. 
 
It’s not just your bones. That’s right. If a light could penetrate beyond something merely 
physical, I wonder what it would do inside your mind – your emotional centers, clear up 
your thoughts, feelings, a simple awareness developing, an awareness that’s more than 
just physical in your body. Something more, you, where you don’t even need to be 
aware of yourself.  
 
A complete reset from the inside out, and there’s that path and the trees. That flower is 
still over there and the forest sounds. Interesting how far the mind can go in a dream. If 
you and I were on such a forest path, we’d realize that it would lead somewhere of 
importance.  
 
You may as well find out where it is because up ahead there’s someone there, someone 
that looks quite interesting, confident, healthy, balanced physically and emotionally. 
With a gust of wind, you could be right there looking back at two people standing on a 
forest path, and smiling to yourself knowing how far they think they have to go, but 
really it’s just around the corner. 
 
We can leave all thoughts and experiences of forests and pathways where they belong, 
a resource inside as a new comprehension dawns of a certain room in which you started 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual

all this, a pleasant place in which the experience began, and knowing that you can just 
leave it all safely inside your unconscious. 
 
As you begin to bring yourself back into your body right here in this room, I really don’t 
know how your orientation will begin. Will you begin to sense your hands and your feet 
first, or would it be your breathing? Perhaps it wouldn’t be until you started to move 
some part of your body – hands, feet, head – that you’d begin to realize that your back 
here in this room with me right now. 
 
It’s good to know that at the end of every journey you don’t just have memories to take 
with you, but you have experiences that have changed you. So in the spirit of such 
things, feel free to bring yourself back now, all the way back to the present moment, 
eyes open, a little stretch and a yawn. Oh, that feels good. 
 
Look around the room. Notice how nothing seems to have changed and yet it looks kind 
of different, doesn’t it? It’s not the room that changed, just in case you were wondering. 
 
I guess all that’s left for me to say is thank you all very much. I hope you enjoyed the 
journey we took together. That’s right. Remember, you can forget all that you need and 
always remember that you had a journey and it was kind of fun, wasn’t it? 
 
Go ahead and enjoy yourselves, folks. Remember that everything that starts on the 
inside will eventually come out.  
 
Have a nice day, guys.

Hypnosis Demonstrations With Strangers On 
The Streets Of London 
 
 
London Day 1 
Demo 1 
 
Bob: 
Hi, this is Bob Cobb. I’m at the Anthony Jacquin and Igor Ledochowski 
Street Hypnosis Course. Right now we’re out in a little bar area just 
outside of Covent Gardens in downtown London, and we’re about to go 
out and have a little fun and see who’s open for adventure. 
 
It’s very easy. Come on. Step right up and I’ll show it to you real quick. This 
is all you’ve got to do. Put your feet together. See, I’ve got my fancy 
hypnotic shoes on. The process has already begun. Look at me. Hold your 
hands out in front of you and just clasp your hands together. Just like that. 
Interlock your fingers and then just bring your elbows up and look there at 
your thumb. 
 
Now take your fingers and spread them about an inch apart. Just 
concentrate on that space in between and let the power of your magnetic 
personality hold them together, closer and closer, closer and closer, 
deeper and deeper. As they go together, you’re just going to feel a 
wonderful sense of peace and comfort and allow them to touch. 
 
That was easy, wasn’t it? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Bob:  
That’s hypnosis. Do you want to try something else? 
 
Subject: 
Oh my God, seriously.

Bob: 
Do you want to try something else? This is even more fun. This will get 
even more fun. Are you ready? Hold your hands out and we’ll do it bigger 
this time. Not just with your fingers; something a whole lot bigger. 
 
Hold your hands out. Not quite that far apart, just there. Now I want you 
to just to imagine – and you can do this with your eyes closed. Use the 
power of your imagination. Go ahead and close your eyes and with the 
power of your imagination, imagine big powerful magnets here pulling 
your hands together, closer and closer together.  
 
Feel the energy as it starts to pull and bring your hands closer together. 
There it goes. You’re doing great getting closer and closer together. Feel 
them come together closer, closer, closer and closer. Feel the power. As 
that energy grows, just allow your fingers and your hands to come closer 
and closer together. You’re doing fantastic. 
 
Just let that energy go. Let them guide your hands closer and closer. 
They’re getting very close now. Feel that energy start to grow as your 
hands get closer and closer. There. They’re almost ready to touch. Allow 
them to touch and when they go together, boom.  
 
Now just look up at me real quick and now close your eyes and sleep, 
deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Let all the tension go from your body, 
deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Every breath you take, just allow the 
tension to go out of your body and allow good healing energy to come in 
there. 
 
You know what? You’re going to have more fun tonight than you’ve ever 
had because you’re going to be so relaxed. All of the stress of your day, all 
of the stress of everything that’s going on is just melting away with every 
breath you take. You’re allowing yourself to go more and more relaxed. 
Let all the tension go out of your body, deeper and deeper and more 
relaxed. 
 
Now in a second, I want to increase the good feelings that you’re going to 
have tonight. Your legs are going to support you. I’m going to support you. 
You’re safe. You’ve got your friends about you. You’re well. You’re feeling 
good and that feeling of good is just going to get more and more 
profound, deeper and deeper. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
12 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
In fact in a second I’m going to reach down there and I’m going to touch 
the back of your right hand, and when I do that you’re going to feel your 
right hand just get light and want to come up. Coming up now, just allow 
that to start to come up. Bring your hand up and imagine that there’s a 
wire to the back of it or balloons. There it goes. It’s starting to come up, 
more balloons.  
 
Just imagine that your hand is coming up. That’s it. You’re doing 
phenomenally well. As your hand comes up, you’re feeling better and 
better, more relaxed, deeper and deeper.  
 
Allow that good feeling to continue to grow and as it continues to grow, 
know that the intensity of the joy that you’re going to experience tonight 
being with your friends is just going to grow with it. Allow it to keep 
growing up, up, up. When it’s there, you can just leave your hand out like 
that.  
 
Now let’s increase your strength and your personal power. I want you to 
just hold your hand there. It doesn’t need to go any higher than it is right 
now. In fact what I’d like you to do is just take your arm and make it nice 
and straight. Make it strong and straight. Feel the power. Get into some 
internal power. Tap into some very strong powers that you’ve got and just 
close your fist.  
 
Make your fist nice and strong, your arms together. It’s nice and strong. 
You’re very strong. It’s almost like it’s a steel beam very strong. In fact, 
your friend is going to come over in just a second – or maybe he’s not. 
Your friend is not going to come over in a second. I’ll do it in just a second. 
 
You’re feeling nice and strong. Your arm is a beam. It is nice and strong. 
You’re powerful. You’re in touch with some very strong inner powers, 
many powers that you didn’t even know that you had before.  
 
In a second I’m going to try to push your arm down, but I’m not going to 
be able to do that because the strength is there. It’s so strong. Feel the 
strength in that arm. That’s unbelievable. No matter how much I push, I 
can’t push it down. What’s up with that? Did you have any idea that you 
could do that before?  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
13 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Okay, now in a second I’m going to just grab it, and you can just let it relax 
and allow your intensity to go even deeper. Relax, deeper and deeper, 
more relaxed. Deeper and deeper, more relaxed. 
 
Now in a second we’re going to do something that’s really fun and you’re  
three but just for a time. You’re going to remember all of the other 
numbers. You’re going to be able to count but for some reason the 
number three is not going to be there anymore. The number three will be 
gone but it will only be gone temporarily. Just for a moment. 
 
In a moment I’m going to count up to two, I’m going to snap my fingers, 
your eyes will be wide awake but you’ll still be deeply into trance. 
 
One, two, eyes open wide awake. How are you doing? How was that so 
far? We’re not done yet. We’ve got one more fun thing to do. In fact, 
could you hold out your hand for me just like that? Could you count? 
 
Subject:  
One, two. 
 
Bob:   
What’s the next one? 
 
Subject:  
One, two, three. 
 
Bob: 
Close your eyes again, deeper and deeper. Relax, go down, deeper and 
deeper and more relaxed. Deeper and deeper. Go down. Go down deeper, 
deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Let all the tension go. Let all the tension 
go.  
 
In a second we’re going to open our eyes again and that number three is 
going to be completely gone. You’re not going to remember the three 
anymore but just for a time, just for fun. You’re going to find that it’s 
funny. You’ll try to think about it but you’ll just automatically skip over to 
the very next number. You cannot remember the number three anymore. 
 
Eyes open, wide awake. How are you doing? 
 
Subject: 
I’m fine. 
 
Bob:  
How is this feeling?

Subject: 
It’s great. 
 
Bob: 
This feels really crazy. I’ll tell you what. Could you do me a favor? He’s run 
away. Could you count my fingers? 
 
Subject: 
One, two. One, two, three. 
 
Bob: 
Three. Back to three again. Go down. Will just take you down one last 
time, deeper and deeper, more relaxed? Let all the tension go out of your 
body. In a moment I’m just going to count you back up, and you’ll be 
returned to the joy of your friends. You’ve been a very, very wonderful 
subject tonight.  
 
You’re going to have an absolutely phenomenal time, and you’re in touch 
with some really, really powerful resources that maybe you didn’t even 
know that you have. 
 
In a second I’m going to count to five and when I do, you’ll be wide awake 
and you’ll feel the equivalent of having had a three-hour nap. You’ll be 
ready to greet the night. You’ll be ready to go out and have a massive 
amount of fun, more fun than you’ve had in a very long time. 
 
One – you’re becoming aware of the sounds of everybody around you. 
Two – feeling the energy come back into your body. Three – having all of 
those silly suggestions that I made before just go away, keeping only the 
ones that are really useful for you. Four – having all the strength come 
back to your shoulders. Five – eyes open, wide awake, feeling really great. 
 
How are you doing? 
 
Subject: 
I’m fine. 
 
Bob: 
Brilliant. You were wonderful. Thank you very much for playing along. My 
name’s Bob. 
 
Subject: 
Nice to meet you, Bob. 
 
Bob:  
Good to meet you as well. Thanks for playing along. Bye.

Someone say your names first of all that’s always good. 
 
Kirsti:  
I’m Kirsti. 
 
Steve:  
Kirsti, you’re wonderful. 
 
Fiona:  
I’m Fiona. 
 
Steve: 
And you’re Fiona. Okay, name’s Steve. I’m a street performer and hypnosis 
is what I do. It’s all about good fun. What we’re going to do is just a couple 
of simple tests to do with hypnosis. This is known as suggestibility. Sounds 
like you’ve done this before. 
 
What we’re going to do first, is just stand with your legs apart, just slightly 
so that you’re nice and well balanced on your legs. What I want you to do 
is just put your arms out in front of you like so. That’s it. Put your bags on 
the floor. That’s always useful.  
 
Just put your arms out like that. Absolutely fantastic. What I want you to 
do is just clasp your hands together, and what I want you to do is make 
sure that your palms are right together and your thumbs are locked over 
the top. That’s it. Absolutely fantastic. 
 
What I’m going to ask you to do now is just pull them slightly back towards 
you. The next thing we’re going to do is you’re just going to take your two 
fingers, and we’re going to stretch them apart about an inch or so. An inch 
is that an inch? Fantastic. That’s almost three inches.  
 
What I need to do now is focus on that gap between your fingers. Very 
important that you focus and focus because there are magnets on your 
fingers, and they’re starting to pull together. Focus on the gap between 
your fingers and away we go. 
 
They’re starting to move. Just focus on the gap. Just feel nice about what’s 
happening between your fingers. That’s right. Just focus your attention 
right between the middle. That’s right. They’re slowing starting to move 
together, and you see your fingers both at the same time starting to move. 
That’s it. Absolutely fantastic. That’s right.

Your fingers are starting to shake. That’s right. You can feel the tension. 
Don’t resist it. Just let your mind pull those fingers together. That’s right. 
Focus your attention. We’re almost there. We’re almost there. Just let 
your attention focus on the space between your fingers. You’re not 
moving at all. That’s right. Don’t resist.  
 
Just let your mind look at me, look at your fingers and they start to pull 
together. Now close your eyes. That’s it. Just put your hands down for a 
moment. That’s brilliant. Just hold it right there. Now just focus yourself 
now and relax. Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out. That’s right. 
Focus on that.  
 
I’m just going to push those together at the moment. You’re working really 
well for me. Thank you very much.  
 
Okay, that’s all about concentration. Just put your hands down for a 
moment and relax. That’s all we’ve done at the moment. We’ve used your 
attention, checking your attention, checking the concentration.

Steve: 
Hello there. We’re making a film today on hypnosis. Have you had some 
experience in hypnosis before? 
 
Ira: 
 
Yes, once. 
 
Steve: 
We’re with a gang of people – street hypnotists. What we’re doing is we 
just want to show people some interesting things that you’ve might not 
seen before. We’re not going to take you into hypnosis. I’m going to take 
two minutes of your time, is that all right? 
 
Ira: 
 
Yes. 
 
Steve: 
What we’re going to do is we just want to show you a couple of things that 
are interesting that you can take away to your family and share it with 
them as well. I’m not going to put you under, not going to make you cluck 
like a chicken. You’re just going to have a bit of fun for a moment.

Just put your bag between your legs. This is my camera man here. He’s 
doing this. We’re on a course, which is Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We’re 
all hypnotherapists but we’re also learning the art of street hypnosis, 
which is a totally different kettle of fish. 
 
It’s about making people just have a bit of fun and experience hypnosis in 
their lifetime. I just want to show you a couple of interesting things that 
are hypnotically involved but they don’t take you under or anything like 
that. Okay? 
 
What’s your name to start with? 
 
Ira: 
 
Ira. 
 
Steve: 
Ira. This is Ira on camera here. Fantastic. Okay, Ira, what I want you to do is 
just stand with your hands beside you and just shake your hands for a 
minute, just to get yourself nice and relaxed. Take a deep breath in and a 
deep breath out. That’s fantastic. 
 
What I’d like you to do now is put your hands in front of you and close 
your hands together. That’s it. Fantastic. Just make sure that your palms 
are touching and your thumbs over the top. I always forget what the name 
of that piece of body work is. 
 
Now what I want you to do is lift your two forefingers up like so with about 
an inch gap apart. I want you to focus now on that gap and just look at 
that gap because there are two magnets on your fingers, which are 
starting to drag those fingers together. Just put your hands out here. 
That’s right. Just lift them up that way. Just look at that gap now.  
 
That’s it. Nice and comfortable. Deep breath in, deep breath out and 
they’re slowly going to touch completely on their own accord. That’s right. 
Nearly there, nearly there. Fantastic, and relax. 
 
Okay, nothing hypnotic about that. Do you know what that tells me? That 
tells me you’ve absolutely got the attention and the focus for what we’re 
doing today. I’m going to try one more thing now. Is that okay? 
 
Okay, what I want to do now then is a very similar thing. I’ll just explain 
this first. We’re going to put our arms out in front of us and on the palm of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
18 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
our hand we’ve got a great big magnet, and we’ve got a great big magnet 
on our own little palm of our hand and we’re going to focus on this energy 
that’s between our hands. 
 
As I talk, slowly but surely those hands are going to come together, as they 
do they’re going to drop down, the difference this time is you’re going to 
shut your eyes while we do it. Is that okay? 
 
Subject: 
All right. 
 
Steve: 
Okay, just put your arms out in front of you. That’s right. No problem at 
all. We’ll keep an eye on that. Just hold it out there about six inches apart. 
That’s great. Just remember that you’ve got a magnet just there and a 
magnet just there.  
 
Just focus now on that energy. That’s right. Just focus on the energy that’s 
in between your hands, and slowly but surely you’ll start to feel them 
moving together. You can’t see it at the moment but that’s right. It is 
starting to move. It’s starting to come together. That’s right. It’s moving. 
That’s right. That’s absolutely perfect. We’re just a few inches away now. 
 
Take a deep breath and breathe out nice and slowly. Those hands have got 
a great big magnet. They’re coming right together and you’re almost going 
to touch, just one inch to go now. Almost there. Absolutely fantastic. And 
they touch, and relax. Fantastic.

Garry: 
Hi, William. I’m Gary. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. I’m the 
hypnotist and you’re the victim. You’re sure you’re okay with that? 
 
William: 
I’m fine. Yes. I’m a bit of a skeptic but we’ll see how it goes.

Gary: 
Good. Let’s just play for a little bit then. We’ll just play for a little bit. Go 
ahead and step right over here. Put your feet together for me. Good. We’ll 
do very it very similar to what he did over there. 
 
I want you to stick your arms straight out like this, and go ahead and 
interlace your fingers. Then go ahead and bend your arms just like that. 
Excellent. You’re doing real well.  
 
Bring your index fingers up and separate them about an inch or so. 
Excellent. You’re doing real good. I want you to focus on this spot right in 
between those two fingers, and you’re going to notice that the fingers are 
going to start to come together. Just as they start to come together, as 
soon as they do come together, your eyes are going to close and you’re 
going to want to drop. 
 
Okay, you’re good. You’re good. Excellent. Go ahead and bring your arms 
back down. Relax. You’re doing good. You’re doing fine. All right, let’s do 
another.  
 
Put your arms straight out like this about this far apart. Keep your arms 
straight, hands straight. Excellent. I want you to imagine, just picture in 
your mind that you’ve got a big magnet here and here, both of these, and 
in these hands are magnets that are just going to pull themselves 
together. All right. 
 
I want you to focus your eyes right here and picture magnet, magnet. 
They’re going to bring your hands together. Go ahead and close your eyes. 
Excellent, and as you do that, you’re going to begin to notice, you’re going 
to begin to experience your hands are starting to come together. 
 
You can try to keep them apart but you cannot. They’re going to start to 
come. That’s it. Just like that. Just like that. You’re doing great. Just like 
that, they’re going to magnetically come together. Just as if I tied a big 
rubber band around your wrists here, those magnets are pulling closer 
together, closer, closer and closer.  
 
Closer and closer and as they touch, sleep deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper 
down. Deeper relaxed. The deeper you relax, the deeper you’ll go. The 
deeper you relax, the better you’ll feel. The better you feel, the more you 
relax. Excellent. You’re doing real well.

London – Day 2 
 
Michael: 
Good day. I’m Michael in the streets of London on a Street Hypnosis 
course, and we’re at the lunchtime break at the moment hitting the 
streets of London to do some live hypnosis on people walking around the 
streets. 
 
It’s Saturday, lunchtime and there are lots of people out here about to 
have some really good fun. 
Demo 6 
 
Bob: 
In fact just look at your hand. Focus on the lines of your hand. Take a look 
at just the little spot right there and focus on it. Notice as your eyes get 
closer, the focus changes and just sleep. Deeper down. Deeper and 
deeper, more relaxed. Go all the way. Let everything go this time.  
 
You can go so much deeper this time. You did phenomenal last time 
around. That was so impressive but this time you’re going to go even 
deeper, and you’re going to have more fun and you will never forget your 
last night in London and neither will your friends. It’s going to be an 
amazing experience for absolutely everybody. 
 
Let’s just go deeper and deeper. Very deep. That’s excellent. More 
relaxed. Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper. Your legs can support 
you as you go deeper and deeper and more relaxed. Deeper and deeper 
and more relaxed. 
 
Okay, stand back up and you can feel yourself feeling really good. Eyes still 
closed. You can support yourself. Now in a second we’re going to bring this 
arm back up again, but we’re going to do something even neater and 
much more powerful than we did last time. 
 
In fact I’m going to ask one of your friends to help us out but not yet, in a 
moment. Feel this arm just start to begin to rise and just feel the live 
feeling coming from this hand as it gets higher and higher. The higher it 
goes, the better you feel. Just straighten it out, nice and straight and 
strong. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
21 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Your legs are going to support you. I’m going to support you and as it goes 
out, straighten it all the way out. Nice and strong as though it’s an iron bar, 
as though it’s something that’s amazingly powerful. Unbelievable inner 
strength that you’ve been able to tap into here. 
 
Make yourself a fist. Make a nice strong fist. Tap into that. An iron bar. Tap 
into inner strength. Amazingly strong. Feel the strength. As you tap into 
the inner strength, it’s as though you can shoot the power out to the 
buildings on the other side of the street. It’s as though you can tap into the 
building on the other side of the street and create an unbelievable 
strength.  
 
Feel how strong it is. It’s amazing. No matter how hard I try to push down, 
you just get stronger. Your arm is stronger and it’s stiff. That’s the inner 
power.  
 
Now in a second I’m going to reach up and I’m going to touch your hand, 
and you’re just going to relax and go deeper and deeper, more relaxed. 
Deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Deeper and deeper, more relaxed. 
 
Now in a second we’re going to have an absolutely amazing amount of fun 
because in a second I’m going to count to three, and when I count to three 
you’re going to be wide awake, eyes open, but you’ll still be in trance. 
 
One of the things that you’re going to find is that you’re completely and 
totally able to support yourself but you’re only able to move on a pogo 
stick, which conveniently your legs have turned into. 
 
You cannot walk. No matter how hard you try, you cannot walk but you 
can bounce on your pogo stick. You’ll be safe. You’ll be secure and when 
you move, you’ll go boing, and that will allow you to jump higher.  
 
The higher you jump, the more fun it’s going to be but you will be safe and 
secure at all times, able to control yourself. On the count of three you’re 
going to open your eyes wide open, wide awake. You will not be able to 
walk.  
 
On the count of three – one, two, three boom. Wake up. How are you 
doing? How did that feel? How’s it going? Can you move around? How do

you move around? You’ve got the power of the pogo stick. How do we 
move with the pogo stick? Boing. Boing. Boing. It feels great, doesn’t it? 
Boing. Boing. Boing.  
 
It’s funny. It feels so good, doesn’t it? It’s an incredible experience.

relax. Yes, relax. Go deeper. 
 
Now one, two, three open your eyes. Excellent! You’ve shown me that you

that those two palms have very powerful magnets all right.   
 
You can see the space between them as they are attracted to each other, 
coming closer and closer together. That’s right. Let those two palms come 
together. You can relax. It’s fun to know that this space is coming together 
closer and closer, more and more relaxed. Excellent. Those two palms are 
going to clasp.

and focus. Focus on this one and as this is coming toward your face you’ll 
notice a change in focus of your eyes. Now this one is coming to your eyes. 
That’s right. This one is coming to your face. You begin to feel more and 
more relaxed.

steel bar. That hand now becomes a steel bar, tighter, tighter, tighter,

I want you to know at any time you can go into the state of relaxation, no 
matter where you are. You’re in the middle of a crowded street in London 
and yet you feel a sense of profound relaxation, peacefulness, and you can 
relax and start feeling a peacefulness at any time in the future when you 
clasp your hands together like they are now. 
 
Now what I want you to do is just to unclasp your hands. Just relax. On the 
count of three you’re going to open your eyes, wide awake, back with me. 
One, two, three – here you are back now.  
 
How did that feel? 
 
Subject: 
That’s really weird. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re not trying to force it, are you? No. Okay, do you want to try 
something else? This is another good one. It’s a really good one. This will 
make you feel so good you’re going to want to do it again and again. It’s 
something that you can then do in the future, which will continue to make 
you feel good. It’s something Paul McKenna does all the time, so it’s a 
really good trick of the mind. 
 
This is what I want you to do. Just close your eyes again. That’s right. What 
I want you to do now is open your eyes and look at my hand, look at my 
finger and as it draws closer towards you, you’re going to feel yourself 
become more and more relaxed, more and more relaxed, a deeper sense 
of relaxation, concentration, focus. 
 
When I touch your forehead, you’re just going to close your eyes and go 
even deeper still now into relaxation. Deeper still. That’s it. Just relax all 
the way down. Relax those arms. That’s right. You’re standing there; 
you’re doing absolutely wonderful. Just continue to relax now. 
 
What I want you to do is do another test now. This one’s going to make 
you feel absolutely wonderful. What I want you to do is to think of 
somebody in your life who you love and somebody in your life who loves 
and respects you. 
 
As you continue to think of that person, I’m going to touch your hand. As 
you continue to think of that love and respect that person has you’re just 
going to find your hand’s will irresistibly rise up. Rise up because of all the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
25 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
love that person has for you, and all the love that you have for them is 
going into that arm and making it by an invisible wire rise up, rise up, 
rising, rising, just feeling that love. 
 
I want you to think of that person as that hand continues to rise. Continue 
to think of that person, all that love that respect, those good feelings that 
they give you, that you give them and it’s filling your arm up. 
 
I want you to imagine now that you have some helium balloons tied to 
your wrist and it’s going to make your hand go up even faster than before, 
all that love and those balloons just pulling your hand up towards your 
face. It’s moving now towards your face, that hand all the way now. That’s 
right, towards your face, and all that love is just continuing to flow through 
your arm all the way, all the way.  
 
Just really allow yourself to feel it. Feel what you’re feeling, see what 
you’re seeing, hear what you’re hearing as you think of that person, and 
that hand continues faster now, faster now to come towards your face, 
towards your forehead. That’s right. That’s right, and as it touches you’re 
going to experience a profound sense of deep relaxation. That’s right. 
 
Now you can just relax your hand and go even deeper now deeper now 
into relaxation, that wonderful feeling.  
 
Remember that wonderful feeling that you had in your arm, I want it now 
to just spread all the way through your body from your head all the way 
down to your toes, all the way that good feeling, all the way down, all the 
way spreading through every fiber, every nerve of your body feeling 
absolutely wonderful. 
 
Just let it fill you fill. Fill you up with that sense of completeness, of 
thankfulness, of gratitude, a those positive feelings just continuing to fill 
you up all the way. Now what I want you to do is to just squeeze your 
thumb and forefinger together as you think of that. That’s right, as you 
think of all those positive feelings. 
 
Now just relax your thumb and forefinger. Three, two, one – come back to 
me. How are you feeling? 
 
Subject: 
Yeah, pretty good.

Hypnotist: 
Now what I want you to do is just squeeze your thumb and forefinger 
again, and now just recapture that feeling, those feelings, those really 
positive feelings. Can you do that? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Fantastic. Okay now sleep. All the way down, all the way. That’s right. 
 
Demo 9 
 
Hypnotist: 
Feet together, you’re here, you’re focused on me. Good. Now you’re going 
to extend your arms just like this. Okay, put them together. Close your 
fingers just like that. Put a little pressure, more pressure. Feel the 
pressure. Feel the pressure just like that over here, and relax your elbows 
all the way. That’s right. 
 
What I’d like you to do is just extend your index fingers just like that. Keep 
a space about a half an inch to an inch apart in between, and focus all your 
attention on the space in between the fingers, all your attention. Just keep 
focusing and focusing. 
 
Imagine that these two little magnets are pulling those fingers together. 
That’s right. Just like that. As soon as they touch, you’re going to relax. 
Relax. That’s right. Just drop your hands. Relax your hands. Let them relax. 
Hands are relaxing, relaxing. That’s right. You’re feeling loose, limp and 
relaxed. Very heavy. That’s right. That’s right. 
 
Now you’re going to find this nice and peaceful place inside of you where 
you feel very tranquil, very peaceful, very happy. This warm and fuzzy 
feeling is growing inside of you and as this feeling grows, you feel that 
something really strange is happening to your left hand.  
 
As this warm and fuzzy and pleasant feeling is growing, somewhere inside 
of you, you feel that your left arm wants to start some movement but you 
don’t really know what it is. As soon as I touch your left arm, the back of 
your left palm, your left arm will slowly start lifting. Very slowly.

27 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
You don’t need to do any effort but it will just start lifting by itself. You 
don’t need to do anything but just focus on this warm and fuzzy feeling 
inside of you. As it’s growing, your left hand is starting to lift higher and 
higher, and as the feeling of peace and tranquility builds, your hand is 
lifting up and it’s actually getting stiffer at the same time.  
 
It’s getting stiffer and stiffer, stronger and stronger and making a fist. 
That’s right, and it’s getting stiffer, stiffer, stiffer here, stiffer here. Just 
turn around a little bit just like that. That’s right, and it’s very stiff. Your 
shoulder is very stiff. You feel that some steel is running through your 
hand. Just like that. Just like that, becoming stiffer, stiffer and much stiffer. 
 
Feel the stiffness. Feel the steel. It’s like an iron bar. That’s right. Your 
hand is very, very stiff. As you focus on how stiff this hand is, your 
relaxation throughout the rest of your body is growing. That’s right. You’re 
relaxing and your hand is getting stiffer, even stiffer. The steel is running 
through your veins right here, through your muscles. 
 
You’re focusing all your attention on how stiff your hand is. As the feeling 
of wellbeing is growing inside of you, the hand is getting even stiffer. As 
you’re focusing on this feeling of growing wellbeing inside of you, your 
hand is getting very, very stiff. 
 
You’re trying to bend it right now but you feel that you can’t. Just try to 
bend it as you focus on this feeling of relaxation in the rest of your body, 
and you can’t even bend it. That’s right. 
 
Now relax. That’s right. Your hand is relaxing. You’re doing very well by the 
way. Very relaxed, very happy, very tranquil and you can go back to this 
place inside of you that’s near the ocean. It’s very peaceful, very tranquil 
and you can always access this place with ease, at will at any time in the 
future, whenever you want. 
 
In a moment I would like you to come back and feel awake but not fully, I’ll  
tell you to go back to sleep, you’re going to go back to this state once 
again but five times deeper. That’s right. 
 
One, two, three – awake. Sleep. That’s right. You’re doing wonderfully. 
That’s right. Both hands are feeling very relaxed, very loose, limp, heavy, 
relaxing, relaxing. That’s right.

You can balance on your own feet but the rest of your body is very 
relaxed. You cannot fall because you’re still in control. Your unconscious 
mind is doing the job, but you’re fully relaxed and you’re going back to 
this. Imagine you are going to close and as soon as I touch your head, 
you’re going to relax again and go back to sleep. That’s right, and you’re 
fully relaxed and you know exactly what it feels like already. It’s so easy for 
you to relax.  
 
Demo 10 
 
Hypnotist: 
Your left arm will start rising very slowly. As you’re focusing your attention 
on it rising, and as it rises you feel that while the rest of your body is very, 
very relaxed, tranquil and peaceful, your left hand is becoming stiffer, 
much stiffer. 
 
It’s now making a fist over here. That’s right, and you feel that your hand is 
growing stronger. Your palm, your hand is getting stronger. Your arm is 
growing stronger as well. You feel that your shoulder here and the elbow 
area is like steel running through your veins. 
 
Just imagine that your hand is becoming like an iron bar. The steel is 
running through your muscles, your veins. You feel the pressure inside. It’s 
getting stronger and stronger. Absolutely strong. 
 
As you focus on your well-being on this warm and fuzzy place inside of 
you, the youth is growing even stronger. As the feeling of well-being is 
growing, the hand, the pressure inside of your hand is growing and 
growing. That’s right. You even want to test it and try to bend the hand 
while you experience this feeling inside of you and this pressure, and you 
can’t bend it. 
 
Try to bend it while you’re feeling the pressure inside of you and you can’t 
bend it. That’s right. Now you’re relaxed, fully relaxed that’s right. You’re 
doing absolutely great. Just remember that what you’re experiencing right 
now is the power of your unconscious, your subconscious mind.

In a moment’s time I would like you to come back. On the count of three – 
one, two, three – you’re going to feel awake. You’ll not be fully awake. 
Remember, you’re going to be very conscious and aware of the situation 
around you. As soon as I say the word sleep again, you’re going to go back 
into this nice, warm and fuzzy state inside of you five times deeper. That’s 
right. 
 
I’m going to count from one to three – you are coming back. One, two, 
three – awake. Sleep. That’s right. You’re doing absolutely great. You’re 
going deeper. The deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel,

One thing strange will happen in just a moment. The strange thing that will 
happen in a moment is when I touch that hand, the hand will start to 
lower very slowly, but as it slowly lowers, you find it the funniest thing on 
Earth. 
 
The slower it lowers, the funnier it gets. The slower it lowers, the funnier it 
gets. That’s it. Just watch it. It’s going down. Isn’t that weird? You just 
don’t know why it did it. What’s going on? What are you doing? What are 
you doing?

thing with you, all right? Get in that relaxation? It’s almost like your body 
popped isn’t it? Sleep. Hand out. Sleep. Hand out. Sleep. Hand out. Sleep. 
Hand out. That’s right. Hand out, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff. 
 
Now, Alex, I’m going to leave you with something very, very, very 
pleasurable. It’s something I don’t normally do but I’m going to do it for 
you because you’ve been so good. Stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, 
stiff. Not moving, an iron bar, stiff, stiff, iron bar, stiff, iron bar, stiff. You’re 
doing really, really well. 
 
Now what I want to let you know, Alex, is that this hand is a very special 
hand. It’s connected to a very special arm, and that arm is connected to a 
very special person. The reason why that arm is so special is because the 
more I speak to you, as I speak to you, anything that you know you want to 
do, everything that you’ve ever wanted is contained in this hand. 
 
Every dream that you’ve ever had is contained in this hand. As you open 
your arms – and I’m going to ask you to open your eyes in a minute – 
you’re going to look at that hand and all the dreams that you’ve ever 
dreamed, the best dreams that you’ve ever had in your life, all the things 
that you’ve wanted to do are contained on the end of this fist. 
 
When you open your eyes, every dream that you’ve ever had, all the 
things you’ve always wanted to do are contained in this fist here. Open 
your eyes and just see all your dreams right out there. Just look right out 
there. All the things you’ve wanted to do. Everything you’ve wanted to be 
is just at the end of your wrist.

your wrist, the better you feel. That’s right. Okay. In a minute I’m going to

thing is, is that because your hands are here you can feel the electricity 
shooting from your hands right now, can’t you? You can feel it, can’t you? 
 
What I want you to do is I want you to imagine that electricity is going 
between two super high-powered magnets, giant magnets. As they are 
there, you’re going to start to notice your hands are coming together as if 
on their own. You don’t even have to pay attention. You can look right 
here but the hands are coming together. That’s right. They are, aren’t 
they? 
 
As they come together, you’re going to get a good feeling inside of your 
body. Some really good feeling that starts in that spot. Yeah that spot. As 
your hands come together, you’re going to feel it all the way. As they 
come closer and closer together, you’re going to take a deep breath in.

down. Relax. Deep breath. Good. Relax. Sleep all the way down. Relax all

Here in Las Vegas we have an opportunity to experience new states of 
mind and new states of being. We can be anybody we want to be here. 
While you are being here, you can experience total relaxation letting your 
hands dangle and letting everything relax as if every muscle in your body is 
relaxing all the way around. 
 
In just a moment I’m going to count from one to five and you’re to come 
right back to this moment. One, two, three, four and five – wide awake. 
That was just an exercise. Everybody, give them a round of applause. Good 
job. 
 
We haven’t even done hypnosis yet. This is just an exercise. Are you right-
handed or left-handed? 
 
Subject: 
Right-handed. 
 
Johnny: 
Can I borrow that hand? 
 
Subject: 
Yes, don’t take it off. 
 
Johnny: 
I don’t plan on taking it off. I plan on using it in such a good way. 
 
Subject: 
Oh good. 
 
Johnny: 
What I want you to do is I want you to take your hand. What I want you to 
do is look right at your hand. I want you to look at the lines on your hand. I 
want you to look at a single point on your hand.  
 
In a moment you’re going to begin to notice that the hand is coming closer 
and closer to your face. As it does, you’re going to notice the changing 
focus in your eyes. In just one moment you’re going to notice that 
happens.  
 
You’re going to close your eyes. Sleep. Relax all the way down. Relax. Take 
a deep breath all the way down. Watch her. Notice how relaxed she can 
be. She’s so calm, so relaxed. Good. Every time you hear my voice, it’s 
going to help you to go deeper and deeper and deeper into total 
relaxation, relaxing all the way down. That’s right, relaxing all the way 
down.

39 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Go ahead and every time you hear my voice, it’s going to help you to get 
even more deep. What I want you to do is I want you to look at her. Do 
you notice how calm she can be? Even here in Vegas, even as exciting as 
this can be, we can calm down and feel really good. 
 
What I want you to do is look right into my eyes. Take a deep breath. 
Good. Relax all the way down. Sleep. Relax, calming your mind all the way 
down and your body all the way down, letting your tired day, any tension, 
any stress just melt out of your body right now all the way down. Relax all 
the way down. That’s right. 
 
In just a moment as you listen to the sound of my voice, an arm, one arm – 
I don’t know which arm that’s going to be, but an arm is going to begin to 
lift. I don’t know which arm is going to begin to lift because we both know 
that uplifting our hands into the sky can make us feel so much better. I 
don’t know which hand is going to begin to lift up on its own.  
 
Yes, you can feel good allowing that arm, whichever arm is that arm, it’s 
going to begin to lift. That’s great, and you can let that arm as it lifts make 
you feel better and better and better. It’s going to help you to recall a 
great memory, some really awesome experience, a really good feeling and 
you can let that feeling crawl up inside of your body as that arm continues 
to lift. That’s right. Lifting and lifting and lifting all the way up.  
 
Yes, that’s right, and it can feel good, can’t it? Yes, it can. It can feel so 
good. Good, and as that hand continues to lift more and more and more, 
you can just let it lift like it’s got 1,000 balloons attached to it and those 
balloons are carrying your arm up into the sky.  
 
The more and more they lift, the more calm and relaxed you can be letting 
that arm lift. The more and more that arm, go ahead and let that lift just 
like it wants to. Yes, it does. The more and more it lifts, the more and 
better and better you can feel. 
 
In just a moment you’re going to feel a magnet just like before. You’re 
going to feel this high-powered magnet on that hand, and there’s another 
high-powered magnet located right here on your head. That’s right, right 
here on your head. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
40 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
In just a moment that hand is going to begin to move towards those as if 
those magnets were coming together on their own. That’s right. You can 
let those begin to come together now as if the magnets were just moving, 
as if it’s magic that hand can just move. That’s right. Just let it move. That’s 
right. Let it move all the way and all the way up and all the way up. You 
can carry it and take it all the way to the head. 
 
When that hand hits the head and the two magnets come together, you’re 
going to relax completely 10 times deeper, 20 times deeper, 100 times 
deeper all the way. Good. Sleep. Relax.  
 
Take a deep breath in and relax all the way down, feeling phenomenal, 
listening to the power and sound of my voice, letting your hand stay there 
and being completely calm.  
 
In just a moment that hand is going to stick right to your head but only in a 
moment. That’s right. This hand can go all the way up, all the way up, all 
the way up to your head as it gets magnetized, as if those magnets can do 
nothing but move together. That’s right. Good. Sleep. Relax all the way 
down 10 times deeper. All the way down. Relax. Completely relax. 
 
Your hands are now completely stuck to your head, stuck as if it is the 
most stuck thing you’ve ever seen in your whole life. Krazy Glue has fallen 
on your head and your hand can no longer leave your head at all. You can 
try. In fact right now try in vein. Try as hard as you can to move that hand, 
but it can’t. You just find that it can’t move. Try. Come on. Try, try harder 
than that but it can’t, can it? 
 
The more you try, the better you feel. That same feeling is doubling, isn’t 
it? It’s tripling. It’s starting in that spot right there and moving all the way 
up your spine. 
 
In just a moment I’m going to count and snap from one to three. What I 
want you guys to do is your hands are stuck so much that if you could 
actually move your hand to grab this $20, could you grab it? Can you get 
your hand? Come on. Come on. You’re almost there. Sleep. Relax all the 
way down. Relax all the way down. All the way down. Good. Staying there 
and finding yourself in deep sleep. Deep, calm and relaxed all the way 
down.

In a second I’m going to count from one to three. As soon as I count to 
three, that arm is going to drop by your side and you’re going to feel 
phenomenal. Ready? On the count of three. One, two, three – drop, relax 
all the way down. Good, good. 
 
In a moment I’m going to bring you guys back into this place, in this place 
and this time. You will remember absolutely everything you experienced, 
absolutely everything, and that feeling that you guys created and helped 
to build together with each other and with me today can carry with you 
forward all the way into the future. 
 
Here we go, on the count of three. I’m going to count up bringing you back 
into this place and this time. On one – coming back to this place, feeling 
your feet underneath you. Two – feeling fantastic, taking a deep breath all 
the way in. Number three – come all the way back up. 
 
Give them a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen. High five. You 
girls are rock stars. Tell me where the feeling started. 
 
Subjects: 
In my stomach.

Maybe. 
 
Johnny: 
Twins. It started in the same place. Where did it move to? 
 
Subject: 
All over. My arms. From the bottom all over. 
 
Johnny: 
Up and out. Look at you. See, mom, you’re raising a good one. She’s a little 
kinky for me but I like that. We are in Vegas. High five from mom, you 
guys, this is a camera. This is for one of our shows, so if you could do me a 
favor and tell me what your experience of hypnosis was like.

Demo 2 
 
Hypnotist: 
Do you want to try a little trick to start with, just something to get started? 
Why don’t you put your hands out in front of you, hold them straight out 
like this and then clasp them together real tight. Watch out for your rings 
because you don’t want your rings to get in the way of your hands. 
 
Now fold them tight like this. Cross your fingers and thumbs over and as 
you feel that pressure there, really hold that tight. Push them hard 
together. Are you pushing them hard? It doesn’t look very tight to me.  
 
Now, bend your arms like you’re praying for something amazing. Now take 
your two fingers and hold them up straight. You can relax. You can 
absolutely relax. These two index fingers and hold them up straight in 
front of you like this about an inch apart. 
 
Now focus on the space between those two fingers and as you’re focusing 
on that space, start to feel yourself relaxing. Allow your arms and legs to 
relax. Feel your body beginning to relax.  
 
Now focus on that space and as you focus on it more, you’ll notice that 
those two fingers of yours start to move closer together, closer together. 
As you relax more, those fingers move even closer together. As your 
fingers move closer together, notice your mind starting to relax. 
 
When they touch, you’ll feel your eyes wanting to close. Allow them to  
your hands together tighter, you’ll notice that those fingers start to close. 
As they closer and closer, notice your eyes starting to feel like they want to 
close.

43 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
As your fingers touch, just close your eyes and relax and go deep into 
trance. That’s right. Just close your eyes and relax all the way down. Allow 
your fingers to touch. Allow your mind to relax. Close your eyes all the way 
down. That’s right. Nice and relaxed.  
 
Let your hands fall down by your side. Take a deep breath. The more you 
relax, the better you feel. The better you feel, the more you relax. Feel 
that feeling and feel your right arm just dangling. 
 
Allow your body to relax – your arms, your legs, your feet, all the way 
through your neck and shoulder. Allow your face to relax – your eyes, your 
cheeks, your lips. As you do that, start to feel your body relaxing. The more 
you relax, the better you feel.  
 
In a moment I’m going to bring you out and we’re going to do a little bit of 
hypnosis. This was an experiment for you to see what it feels like. It feels 
good, right? Imagine this feeling and being able to take this feeling with 
you. 
 
In a moment I’m going to bring you out and we’re going to do some 
hypnosis. I’m going to count backwards from three. Three – starting to feel 
relaxed and coming back into your consciousness. Two – noticing the 
sights and sounds around you. One – opening your eyes wide awake. 
 
How do you feel? 
 
Subject: 
Okay. I feel like tingly. 
 
Hypnotist: 
How so? 
 
Subject: 
A little tingly. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Do you feel any warmth in your body? 
 
Subject: 
A little bit. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Where would you point to that warmth? 
 
Subject: 
Here.

44 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Hypnotist: 
Is that right? Do you want to do some more? 
 
Subject: 
Yeah, I’ll try it again. I’ll do it again. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Is that right? Are you right-handed or left-handed? 
 
Subject: 
Right handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Do you mind if I touch your hand? Do you mind if I just hold that and put it 
up above your head? If you stare at your hand, just look at that closely and 
pay attention to your individual fingers. Feel that sensation as I push 
across them.  
 
Now notice the lines on your hands and as you notice those lines, find a 
spot on your hand you want to focus on. Focus your eyes on that spot. Pay 
attention to that. As your hand starts to move closer towards your face, 
you’ll notice that your eyes start to change focus. 
 
As your eyes start to change focus, you’ll notice that you start to relax. As 
you relax and your hand approaches your face even more, notice your 
eyes starting to want to close. As your hand gets closer to your face, close 
your eyes and relax. Now sleep. That’s right. Relax all the way down. 
Deeper and deeper down. 
 
The deeper you go, the more you relax. The more you relax, the deeper 
you go. As you’re starting to relax your right arm, feel that same motion in 
your left arm. Allow it to just dangle down by your side. Allow your two 
shoulders to relax. 
 
As your shoulders relax, you’ll feel it working its way down your spine into 
your lower back. As you feel that in your lower back, you’re going to start 
to feel that all the way down to your feet. 
 
Notice that your body is relaxed but it’s supporting itself with its body 
weight. Now just allow yourself to relax and rock back and forth a little bit 
using that weight. Now imagine that time that we talked about earlier, 
that time in your life when you had an amazing feel, when you felt like 
your life couldn’t be any better, where you had total confidence and total 
joy.

45 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Bring that feeling into your mind and imagine that scenario for a moment. 
Now as you’re doing that, notice your right hand starts to want to move. 
You’ll probably notice it as just a small twitch in your fingers and as it 
starts to twitch your fingers, feel that arm start to relax. Allow it to do 
what it wants to do naturally. 
 
As you start relax, notice that you start to get deeper and deeper. The 
deeper you go, the better you feel. The more you relax, the deeper you go. 
Now you probably notice as I tap on that right hand of yours, it will 
actually start moving up towards your face. 
 
As you notice that, notice that your arm starts to get weightlessness, like 
there’s a bunch of balloons attached to the top of that finger, your index 
finger. It starts pulling your index finger. Your index finger starts coming 
closer and closer up towards your face. As it gets lighter, notice your hand 
is starting to move on its own all the way to your face. 
 
Notice there’s nothing you need to do, only to relax. The more you relax, 
the more that hand is going to want to start to move. It’s feeling lighter 
and lighter now. Feel that relaxation.  
 
As you start to relax, notice that hand starts to move. It starts to feel even 
lighter and more relaxed. Notice that feeling, that passion, those feelings 
we discussed and feel that welling up inside of you. 
 
As you start to feel that, you can feel that arm start to move up towards 
your head. You’ll feel that feeling starts to grow richer and richer, deeper 
and deeper, more and more relaxed. 
 
Now feel that arm starting to become weightless. It’s starting to move 
closer to your face. As you start to rock back and forth, find your body 
starting to relax. As your left arm starts to move, as it starts to tingle out 
by your side, notice that your body can relax. 
 
Now remember that emotion we talked about, that feeling from earlier. If 
you had to point to it on your body, where would you point to? Right here 
in your stomach? How does that feel when you put it on your stomach? 
Does it well up inside of you? Does it make you feel relaxed?

If you feel that feeling and then take your right hand and put it out to your 
right hand side, let your body relax. Just allow your arms to dangle. Just 
allow them to dangle. That’s right. Deeper and deeper down.  
 
In a moment I’m going to ask you to come back into the room. I’m going to 
count back from three. Three – noticing the world around you, feeling 
your body coming back to your consciousness. Two – noticing the sights 
and sounds and your friends standing to your left-hand side. One – eyes 
open wide awake. 
 
How do you feel? 
 
Subject: 
I felt light.  
 
Johnny: 
What sort of light? 
 
Subject: 
Just like I really wanted to like fall, I just felt very light. 
 
Demo 3 
 
Hypnotist: 
Close your eyes. Every time you close your eyes, you’ll feel more relaxed. 
Open your eyes. Close your eyes now. Your entire body will be relaxed, all 
the way down. Excellent. We’re going to do it one more time. We’ll do it a 
couple more times.  
 
When I ask you to open your eyes and close your eyes, it sends a wave of 
relaxation throughout your whole body. Here we go. Now open your eyes. 
Close your eyes down, relaxing, staying in perfect balance. 
 
Here we go now. You’re going to open your eyes again. Open your eyes. 
Close your eyes way down, way down deep, way down deep. Sleep. 
Excellent.  
 
Now I’m going to lift your left arm just a few inches and when I drop it, 
you’re going to go even deeper now. Just go even deeper. Let it go. Loose 
and limp. Don’t you do it. Let me do it. Loose and limp like a rag doll. Let it 
go. Let it drop. There you go. Just let it drop. Let it drop. You’re almost 
there. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
47 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I’m going to do it here, loose and limp. Loose and limp. Just let it go. 
You’re almost there. Loose and limp. You’re almost there. Absolutely 
great. 
 
Now I’m going to touch your left hand now. I’m going to touch your left 
hand because I want you to go deeper and deeper into a hypnotic state. 
No sounds disturb you. It doesn’t matter if someone yells right in your 
face. You’ll stay in this relaxed state of absolute wonderful hypnotic 
relaxation. It’s so relaxing and absolutely a wonderful feeling now. 
 
Now in a moment you’re going to notice something very unusual. You’re 
going to notice sometime really unusual about your left hand. You see, 
your left hand is actually tied to a bunch of balloons. Your left hand is 
actually tied to a bunch of helium balloons and it’s going to begin to float 
up in the air, float up in the air, float up in the air. 
 
As it goes towards your face as if it’s drawn by an actual magnet, as if it’s 
magnetized, drawn, in by an actual magnet, it’s going to begin to float 
right up towards your face, floating up towards your face, going right 
towards your face like a magnet. There it goes.  
 
It’s starting to lift up now. I’m going to tie 50 balloons onto that hand, 50 
balloons onto that hand full of helium. What color are those balloons? 
Here are 100 balloons now floating up in the air, floating way up in the air. 
Let that hand come right towards your face, and here’s the unusual thing. 
 
You get an unusually wonderful feeling as that hand begins to lift and rise 
right up towards your face. In fact it begins to get rather funny to you as it 
begins to lift and rise. I’m going to put 100 helium balloons on that hand 
now, and now I’m going to tie a pulley from the top of your hand through 
your shoulder. 
 
Now I have a pulley and every time I pull the pulley, that hand’s going 
higher and lifting, lifting towards your face. Maybe it will rest on your 
cheek or maybe on your jaw and it becomes funnier and funnier the higher 
it goes. Now let’s get that hand to go right to your face. Faster now. It’s 
moving towards your face and I want you to remember an unusually funny 
feeling as that hand begins to lift and rise. Excellent. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
48 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Now let’s put 300 helium balloons and really pull on that pulley as that are 
begins to lift and rise, to lift and rise right towards that face. A little grin 
now is starting to happen because you remember a very funny episode in 
the past. It makes no sense as to why you’d be thinking about this but it’s 
funny as can be. 
 
In fact the higher that hand goes, the funnier it is. You can’t believe that 
you’re remembering this very funny episode and have this incredible 
unusual wellbeing, a feeling of wellbeing as that hand goes right towards 
your face. Get that hand to lift up faster and faster right towards your 
face. There you go. 
 
A little smile is starting to appear as I pull harder and harder and harder on 
that arm, way hard on that arm. Very interesting, very unusual feeling.  
 
Now in a moment I’m going to have you open your eyes. Not yet but in a 
moment. What  that arm is my arm. You’re going to take a look at that arm 
and you’re going to see that arm is actually not your arm. That arm 
actually belongs to me. 
 
You’re going to have a very unusual feeling when you open your eyes and 
look at that arm. That simply is not your arm. I’m going to count to three 
and you’re going to open your eyes and take a look at that arm. It’s simply 
not your arm. It’s simply stuck on your body. It’s somebody else’s arm.  
 
Go ahead and open your eyes now. Open your eyes and take a look at that 
arm. What do you think? Whose arm is that anyway? It’s my arm. What’s 
it doing on your body? That arm belongs to me. Incredible. 
 
I want you to close your eyes. Sleep now, deep down, deep. When I count 
to three I’m going to take your name away just for a moment. I’ll give you 
your name back. I’ll give you your name back no problem, but just for a 
moment you forgot your name. I’m going to give you a new name. Very 
strange. Your name is going to be Aritha T Flopper. I know, but the thing is 
if anybody makes fun of your name, you get rather upset about it because 
after all that’s your name Aritha T Flopper, do you understand? Nod your 
head. Excellent.  
 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
49 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
When I open your eyes I’m going to ask you your name. Your name is 
Aritha T Flopper. If anybody laughs at your name, you get a little upset. 
Not violent. You’re not going to say anything nasty to them but it’s a 
rather weird thing because after all that’s your name. It’s been your name 
for generations.  
 
Okay, one, two, three – open your eyes. Excellent. Could you just ask her, 
her name? 
 
Bystander: 
What’s your name? 
 
Hypnotist: 
Excellent. That’s not very nice. That’s not very nice. Close your eyes. Go 
ahead and sleep. I’m going to take this hand gently now, gently now and 
I’m going to stick it right on your head. That hand is stuck on your head. 
That hand is stuck on your head and you can’t get that hand off your head 
no matter how hard you try. 
 
In fact the harder you try, the more relaxed you become and the more 
difficult it becomes to actually get that hand off your head. This hand is 
actually part of your head. It’s an unusual thing. You just happened to be 
born with that hand stuck on your head. That’s just the way it is.  
 
No matter how hard you try, you can’t get that hand off your head. When I 
count to three you’re going to open your eyes and you’re going to go 
ahead and try to pull that hand off your head. One, two, three – open your 
eyes and get that hand off your head. 
 
It’s impossible. It’s part of your head. Go ahead and try hard now. Try 
hard. Oh, there you go. Oh, it sort of came off a little. Okay, close your 
eyes now and go back to sleep. I think you’ve had enough.  
 
You’ve been an excellent subject, so I want to give you a gift. I’m going to 
give you a gift from your mind to yourself, okay? In a moment I’m going to 
get you out of this state but before I do, I want to give you something very 
nice that’s coming from you towards yourself, all right? 
 
First of all I’m going to count to three and your arm’s going to drop off 
your head and you’re just going to relax. One, two, three – get it off your 
head and let it drop down and just relax.

I want you to think of a time when you’ve been incredibly successful, 
when you had an incredibly positive experience, when life was really good, 
when you achieved everything you wanted to achieve.  
 
When you have a picture of that, when you can see it, when you can hear 
it, when you can feel it, I want you to nod your head. A time when you had 
an incredible positive experience, when life was good, everything was 
going your way, it was a wonderful experience. Go ahead. Do you have it 
in your mind? Excellent. 
 
I want you to take your thumb and touch it to your little finger. Touch your 
thumb to your little finger. Now I want you to think of that incredibly 
wonderful experience you had. See it. Step into it. When you were 
successful and powerful and achieved everything you ever wanted to 
achieve. 
 
From this moment forward whenever you touch that thumb to your little 
finger, that feeling is going to come back to you. You’re going to have a 
little smile on your face and you’re going to know whatever challenges you 
face in life, whatever obstacles you face, all you need to do is touch those 
fingers and you’re going to get an incredibly positive feeling. Nod your 
head if that’s on board with you. Excellent. 
 
Let your fingers go now. I’m going to count you out of this. You’ve been a 
wonderful subject. You’ve been a wonderful person basically. We’re going 
to count from one to five. When I get to the number five, you’re going to 
be fully awake and alert, no longer hypnotized, back to normal in every 
way. 
 
When I say the number one, your limbs relax now. When I say the number 
two, you can feel the energy coming into your toes and into your hands.  
The number three – I want you to fill that chest up with life-giving oxygen.

Everything is completely safe. I wouldn’t do anything to you guys that I 
wouldn’t do to my own mother, okay? You’re absolutely safe. 
 
Now could you just take your glasses and put them in your purse there? 
The first thing we’re going to do is warm up your hypnosis muscles, okay? 
Just rub your hands like this together, nice and fast. Now feel the warmth. 
All right.  
 
Now clasp them together like this, nice and tight. Nice and tight just like 
that, and make a steeple like that. Like this, nice and tight, about an inch 
apart. Focus on the gap because in a moment they’re going to touch. Your 
fingers are going to touch just like magnets bringing them together using 
just the power of your imagination. That’s right. Sleep. Relax. Perfect. 
 
Touch and then relax. Don’t resist and sleep. Relax all the way down. Just 
relax all the way down. Don’t resist it. Just allow the magnets to bring 
them together. You’re millimeters away, and when they touch just close 
your eyes and relax. Okay. Just relax just all the way down. It’s really easy 
stuff.  
 
One, two – wide awake, wide awake. One, two – wide awake, wide awake. 
That just tells me that you have the power to concentrate. It’s really easy, 
right? Let’s try another thing, all right? Just look at your hand here, right 
there. Just focus on the lines on the hand. Just focus on a spot and as the 
hand moves closer to your face, you’ll notice that it changes the focus in 
your eyes. 
 
When you’re aware of your eyes, just close your eyes. Just all the way 
down. Relax all the way down, deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
and deeper. The deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel, 
the deeper you go all the way down. 
 
You can hear noises outside. The noises are just going to make you more 
and more and more relaxed all the way down. I’m going to leave you here 
on your balance and the more you feel the balance, the deeper you go. 
Nod your head, nod your head if you understand me. Okay, just stay right 
there. 
 
Okay, we’re going to do the same thing. Can I borrow your hand for a 
second? Great. Just look at the lines on your hand. Just pick a spot and as

52 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
the hand goes closer to your face like that, notice that it changes the focus 
in your eyes. When you’re aware of your eyes, just close your eyes and 
sleep all the way down, deeper and deeper and deeper, deeper and 
deeper down. 
 
The deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel, the deeper 
you go into a wonderful state of relaxation. Now feel your balance. The 
more you feel your balance, the deeper you go. The more you feel your 
balance, the deeper you go. Nod your head if you understand me. All right, 
just stay right there. 
 
Now sleep. All the way down deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper. All 
the way down, deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. The deeper 
you go, the better you feel. All the way down to a wonderful state of 
relaxation. Perfect. Stay right there. Nod your head if you understand. Just

gift, okay? Now just find a balance point, all right? Just find a balance 
point. Perfect, just right there. Perfect. Awesome. Just stay right there.

Just close your eyes. Just close your eyes deeper and deeper. That’s right. 
Very good just allow the hand to just float in the air. Perfect. Awesome. 
Nathan, same thing just find your balance point. Perfect. Awesome. 
 
Now all of you pick a time in your life that you had an incredible memory, 
something that you made you feel warm and fuzzy inside. Nod your head 
when you have the memory for me. Very good. Now would you like that 
memory to increase? Would you like that? Very good. Do you want to feel 
better? Lock it into your memory so that you can bring that memory any 
time you want and feel incredible any time you want. 
 
What we’re going to do is just notice that your right hand will begin to 
float up just magically as that memory intensifies. As that memory 
intensifies, allow that right hand to float up. Notice that the higher it floats 
up, the more the memory intensifies, feeling better and better and better 
and better.

Just allow that right hand to float up in the air just magically. You can 
imagine there’s a balloon tied to it, a helium balloon. Just allow that – 
that’s right, Nathan, you’re doing great. Allow that right hand to rise up in 
the air only as quickly though as you want to feel incredible. 
 
If you want to feel totally incredible, it will feel better and better – that’s 
right, Stephanie. Awesome. The higher it goes, the better you will feel. The 
higher it goes – way to go, Nathan. Keep going. The higher that hand goes,

higher your hand will go, the better you’ll feel. Awesome. 
 
Stephanie, you’re doing amazing. It’s higher and higher and higher. Let it 
go as high as it can. Nathan, good job. When it can get as high as it can 
you’re going to maximize the feeling of that happiness, that joy within and 
you’re going to be able to take that joy with you anytime. 
 
Nathan, good job. Oh my God. Stephanie, a little higher. Intensify it. Higher 
and higher and higher, feel that helium balloon really pulling up, okay? 
Higher and higher and higher and higher that a boy. Good job, Nathan.  
 
When it’s at its highest, when it’s at its highest, intensify it by 10 times, by 
100 times and you’ll begin to notice that you start smiling because the 
feeling will start to spread throughout your whole body. 
 
That’s right, Nathan. It’s started spreading throughout your whole body. 
Feel it in your heart right there, all right? Let’s see that smile on your face. 
There you go. Stephanie you too, the more you intensify it – there you go.

you want to laugh for some reason, right Nathan? That’s right. You want to 
start laughing. Right Nathan? You want to start laughing, don’t you? That’s 
right. Stephanie, it’s incredibly funny, isn’t it?

Now lock that feeling inside. Lock that feeling inside and relax. Lock it in,

eyes closed all the way down. Just remember that moment, that 
experience that you had today, locking that feeling in, feeling incredible 
inside. The power of the mind, Stephanie – good job. 
 
One, two – wide awake. One, two – wide awake. One, two – wide awake. 
All the way back. Give them a round of applause, everyone. Any time you 
want to feel that moment again – just try it now. Just raise your hand up. 
Can you feel it? You try it. Any time you want to feel incredible – you just 
can’t help it, right? That’s the power of the mind. Anyway, thanks. Good 
job. 
 
Demo 5 
 
Hypnotist: 
As soon as they touch, you’ll get a feeling. Close your eyes. You’re getting 
closer, getting closer, getting closer and sleep. Nice and relaxed. There you 
go. Nice and relaxed. Does that feel good? That’s right, it does feel good. 
All right, in the same way I’m going to count from to three and you’re back 
into normal awareness. One, two and three – wide awake. Feels pretty 
good right? 
 
All right, now we’re going to do the big one. Are you right-handed or left-
handed? 
 
Subject: 
I’m right-handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
All right, let me steal your left hand for a moment then. What I want you 
to do is look at the palm of your hand right here. Look at it. Now focus on 
one spot and one spot only. As that hand gets closer, notice your eyes 
start to change, your focus starts to change. As soon as you become aware 
of your eyes, allow them to close and sleep. Nice and relaxed.  
 
There you go, down, down, down. Nice and relaxed. The deeper you go,  
and relaxed, deep and relaxed. Excellent. Excellent.

Okay, now what I’m going to do is I’m going to take your hand again. 
That’s right, just take your hand again. There it is. There it is. Okay, that’s 
right. It’s going to want to stay right there. 
 
In a moment you’re going to notice that hand is going to want to lift all by 
itself, like maybe it’s got a string tied around it with a helium balloon 
pulling up on it. The higher it goes, the funnier you’re going to think that is 
because it is pretty funny when things do things all by themselves. That’s 
right, you feel it lifting. 
 
Now you’ve got like two helium balloons floating up even higher. The 
higher it goes, the funnier it gets. The funnier it gets, the higher it’s going 
to want to rise. That’s right. You feel that going up? Yes, it’s pretty funny, 
isn’t it? 
 
The higher it goes, the funnier it gets. The funnier it gets, the higher it 
wants to rise all by itself. Now we’re going to tie four big balloons on 
there. Oh, it’s pulling really hard. You can’t even stop it now. The higher it 
goes, the funnier it gets. That’s right. Feel the giggle. 
 
As you’re laughing, you remember times when you were with your friends 
and things were absolutely hilarious, right? That’s right. That’s right. You 
remember that. The more your hand raises up, the funnier it seems. The 
funnier it seems, the more it raises up. That’s right. It’s going up. Oh yeah, 
it’s pretty funny. Don’t hold back. You know it’s funny. You know it’s funny 
and you’ve got to let it out. That’s right. That’s right. 
 
You know what? Any time you want to bring that feeling back, all you’ve 
got to do is raise your hand right here. Okay, go ahead and relax now. 
You’re doing a great job by the way. Fantastic.  
 
I’m going to count from one to five. When I get to five, you’re going to be 
normally awake and alert, but when I get to three you’re going to feel that 
laugh come back. When that laugh comes back, what that is, is all that 
stress and tension that you had that you didn’t know you had letting out.  
You’re going to let go of all that because you’re in Vegas baby. You’re here 
to have a good time, right? Excellent. 
 
Okay one – getting a little more awake. Two – deep breath, filling yourself 
with energy. Three – there’s that little giggle letting the stress out. That’s

right. Four – more and more awake and five – wide awake. You did an 
excellent job. Thank you so much. Give her a big round of applause. That 
was excellent. Excellent.

Hypnotist: 
Notice a spot on your hand. Just stare at that spot. It seems to jump out at 
you, right? As it jumps out at you, your hand goes closer and closer to your 
head, closer and closer to your head. It’s just drawing like there’s a string 
that’s pulling it, pulling your hand closer and closer to your head, almost 
like the magnets again, right? 
 
Your fingers are closing. Your fingers, your hands – what are the 
sensations you’re noticing in your hands? Tingly-ness, a little numb? Okay, 
well, when they touch you’re going to close your eyes again and sleep, 
sleep, sleep. That’s right, just sleep.  
 
What I want you to do now is to just remember, just recall a time when 
you were extremely happy, a fun time with your friends, maybe when you 
had a good laugh, when you were doing something when you were really 
happy, a good time in your life that brought lots of joy.  
 
You got that memory now? What I want you to do is feel it flowing, all the 
fun, all the good feelings, all the joy, all the laughter is flowing directly into 
this hand. Feel it, the sensation, the tingles and as you feel it, as you 
clench your fist it goes stronger and stronger and stronger, getting 
stronger and stronger and stronger. You can feel it. It’s a little bit of a 
weird feeling.  
 
It makes you smile. It almost makes you chuckle, right? Do you want to 
laugh? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You can laugh. It’s an odd thing, right? Okay, any time you want to 
remember this good feeling, any time you need it all you have to do is 
clench your hand together. Can you feel it? It will bring a smile to your 
face, okay? How about that? 
 
Subject: 
Awesome.

Hypnotist: 
The higher it gets, the better you feel. As it raises, you feel better and 
better. Just your whole body starts to radiate, feeling good. You even get a 
smile it’s so good. You really can’t believe how good this feels. That’s 
getting better and more exquisite and better over and over. It goes up and 
up and you’re feeling really great, really wonderful. Excellent. 
 
Just allow it to come down and continue to feel really good. Now what I’m 
going to do right now is you’re going to hold your hand up and just relax, 
totally and completely. I’m going to let go of it.  
 
Now I know you’ve had really experiences in your life and you’ve had 
many good experiences. Now I’d like you to choose one in particular, a 
really good experience, one that you would love to have over and over and 
over again. The feelings in that experience. Have you got one? Excellent. 
Okay. 
 
What I want you to do is when I drop this, you’re going to really 
experience that. Ready, one, two, three and go. We’ll do it again and even 
more so. Ten more times as powerful. Ready, one, two, three – and relax. 
Excellent. Excellent. We’ll do it one more time. Really feel that. This is 
going to be 100 times. One, two, three – 100 times. Excellent. 
 
Now what I want you to do is lift your hand up right like that, and now 
drop it and just let those feelings come right all the way back. How’s that 
going? Does that feel good? Excellent. Let’s do it one more time. Drop it 
and just feel great, and excellent. Good, good, good. 
 
Okay, now I’m going to count from one to five. Again, you’ll come up and 
on five your eyes will open, you’ll feel great, fantastic. You’ll be ready to 
have the best time of your life tonight. One, two, three – take a deep 
breath. And four – really feel all the people around you, and five – eyes 
open, alert and ready to go.

Michael: 
Those are your sunglasses, right? Those are nice. I’m Michael. 
 
Bianca: 
I’m Bianca. 
 
Michael: 
Bianca, that’s a beautiful name. Now if I may ask you to do something for 
me. I’d like you to stick your hands right in front of you. Okay, clasp them 
together and lock the fingers tight. That’s perfect. You’re doing this great. 
 
This is really just a test if you can pay attention and follow direction. If you 
would just squeeze your hands tightly together, perfect. Now bend your 
elbows, so you raise your hands right in front of you. 
 
I know you can hear me, so stick your fingers right up like that. Perfect. 
Make a gap about an inch wide because soon your fingers will touch. In a 
moment your fingers will touch as you feel like there’s a little magnet, and 
you’re concentrating on that space. Watch your fingers move closer 
automatically, only slowly. You’re doing it perfectly. 
 
You’re feeling what you should be, and that’s good. As you’re doing that, 
watching your fingers moving closer and closer together like I’m winding 
the rubber band tighter and tighter and tighter. Perfect. I’m winding the 
rubber band. That’s funny because the more you laugh, the faster your 
fingers move together because it’s quite amusing, and we all like to laugh. 
 
Watching your fingers move closer and closer together, she’s doing it 
really well. Give her a round of applause. She’s doing it perfect. Isn’t that 
cool? That’s right because as soon as the fingers touch, your eyes will 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
59 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
close. You already tried that? That’s good. Watch that. That’s good. That’s 
good. You’re doing good. You know what it feels like. Excellent. See how 
you can do that? 
 
Actually now this is what hypnosis feels like. You shouldn’t expect to black 
out. Now with your eyes closed, I’m just going to count one, two, three 
and we’ll say wide awake. One, two, three – now wide awake. Open your 
eyes, relax your fingers and your hands. Excellent. 
 
How much fun was that? 
 
Subject: 
I didn’t feel anything. 
 
Hypnotist: 
That’s good because the only difference between that and actual hypnosis 
is that you’re going to be a lot more relaxed. Are you ready? Give her a 
round of applause. She did a really good job.  
 
What this is like is just paying attention and following directions. I’d like 
you to stick your hands out like this and the smartest people do the best 
with this, so as you watch and imagine there’s a finger right here and do 
you see where that finger went? Okay, now pretend there’s a magnet. I 
put a magnet right in the palm of your hand.  
 
Imagine that staring right past your hands. Imagine a magnet right here 
and continue to breathe. That’s right. Take another deep breath. That’s 
right. Your hands have already started to move together you imagine 
there are magnets, and as those magnets get closer they get more strongly 
attracted. 
 
As you’re feeling that and seeing that, the magnets are more strongly 
attracting your hands together closer and closer. When your hands come 
together, you’re going to feel even better because as you notice – you’re 
doing this perfectly. That’s good because it’s funny. 
 
The more your hands move closer together, the more you laugh because 
this could be one of the more interesting and funny things that you’ve 
experienced today. As you’re watching this – give her a round of applause. 
She’s doing really well. Excellent job.

60 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Every time you hear applause, you actually feel better and you actually 
notice as your hands are moving closer together – and you’re doing really 
well, isn’t she? She’s doing great.  
 
Bianca, you’re just doing this the way you should be. In fact everyone is 
enjoying this because you are the star. You are the star of the show. As 
you watch your hands move closer together, soon they’re going to end up 
like this. Watch as your hands are moving close together and they’re 
actually discovering they’re being more strongly attracted. You’re feeling 
that strong attraction. 
 
As you’re looking at your hands moving close together, just become aware 
of the sound of my voice. Everything else fades and watch your hand move 
closer. When they touch, you actually discover they press tight together, 
so tight that the harder you try now, the tighter your hands squeeze 
together. 
 
The harder you try, the tighter your hands squeeze together. Notice her 
hands are actually stuck. Do you feel that? Your hands are squeezing so 
tight they shake. You can actually remember this feeling that the harder 
you try, the more your hands shake and the tighter they squeeze together. 
 
Actually satisfy yourself with that sensation as you’re doing that perfectly. 
Isn’t she doing great? Yeah, look at your friends. You can look at your 
friends and notice the smiles on their faces, the smile on your face. 
 
Now one, two, three I’ll clasp my hands and your hands will fall loosely 
apart. One, two, three – that’s it. Awesome job. She’s amazing at this. Give 
her a round of applause. Look, they’re sincerely enjoying this. 
 
Do any of you want to join? Okay, are you ready? Now I’m about to give 
you a little gift. Why do you need to be hypnotized? 
 
Subject: 
Well, what are you going to have me do? 
 
Hypnotist: 
I’m just going to have you do the same things that you’ve been doing 
already. 
 
Subject: 
Am I going to be like running around like crazy?

Hypnotist: 
Well, how about you guys? We’ll ask for a vote. She should stay here and 
be safe, right, so you can see her. Let’s do that. That way we can have you 
on video and you’ll be the star.  
 
Are you okay with this? 
 
Subject: 
Okay. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Okay, now I’m going to ask you to – wait a minute. Which hand do you 
write with? Can I borrow that arm? Okay, I’d like you to look at this hand 
and stretch your hand right out like that. Just look right at the hand.  
 
I’m going to actually touch your shoulder for a moment. Just notice as 
your hand is in front of you, look at the lines on the hand and focus on one 
spot. In a moment I’m going to move your hand closer and the focus of 
your eyes will change.  
 
When you become aware of your eyes, your eyes will close. After you 
become aware of your eyes, your eyes will close. That’s right. You’re doing 
great. After you become aware of your eyes, your eyes will close. That’s 
right. Sleep now. That’s it. That’s it. That’s okay. 
 
What I’m going to have you do is something a little different. What I’m 
going to ask you to do is just pay attention to your hand – and you’re 
doing this right. Watch the lines on the hand. Watch the spot on the hand. 
When you see that spot, nod your head.  
 
When you’re ready, I’m going to raise the hand a little higher and now I’m 
going to ask you to pay attention. Focus your gaze, all of your awareness 
on that spot and when you see that spot move closer to you, your focus 
will change. As you become more aware of your eyes, your eyes can close. 
That’s right. 
 
Now just let this hand relax and you feel safe. Let this hand relax, let this 
whole arm fall to your side and you feel safe. That’s right. You feel safer 
now. Take a deep breath in and let it all out. Let all that stress go away. Let 
all that tension go away. Take another deep breath in. Let all the stress go 
away.

You’re safe, protected. Everyone here, your friends like you and we all like 
our friends, don’t we? They’re nodding their heads. Imagine them smiling 
and nodding at you because I’m going to just ask you to remember a 
beautiful time in your life. In a moment this hand that I touch, this hand – 
in a moment when you feel me touch that hand, you’ll actually feel it rise 
up and go all the way to your upper rib cage right below your neck.  
 
You’ll feel that and as you feel this hand start to go up – that’s right, just 
like a string is pulling it – that’s perfect. Actually, start to feel it go up. The 
faster it goes up, the more you feel better and more relaxed. That’s right. 
You’re giving yourself a little gift. That’s good. Perfect. That’s good. 
Exactly. Touching your chest, feeling good.  
 
We’re doing a hypnosis show here. Give her a round of applause because 
she’s doing really well. Isn’t she doing really well? That’s excellent. Now as 
you’re feeling that and because every time you hear applause, you drift 
deeper. That’s right. Give her another round of applause. Help her feel 
good. Excellent.  
 
Your friends are applauding and they’re laughing with you because now 
you can start laughing because you remember having it on the inside and 
then on the outside. You’re doing really well. It’s a really pleasant time. 
Remember that pleasant time? That’s right. Then start laughing on the 
inside. Feel that on the inside and as you feel this hand touching your 
abdomen and your rib cage, start to laugh on the outside now. 
 
Beginning to feel like getting twice as strong that’s right. Twice as strong 
it’s good. That’s good. You’re doing it right. Yes, it’s pretty funny and 
everybody is smiling with you. You start to smile more and more, not 
because I suggested that. Only as much as you feel that. Only as much as 
you’re feeling that, Bianca, because you’re taking the pressure off yourself.  
 
When I touch your shoulder, take the pressure off yourself and just relax 
and smile. That’s it. You’re doing great. Now I’d like you to remember that 
when you put your hand right there, you’re giving yourself this gift again. 
Every time you put your hand right there, you give yourself that gift.  
 
Imagine right now that the hand is stuck. Just imagine right now the hand 
is stuck. Tell yourself, want that, feel that. Is that all right with you? Good. 
Now feel that. I’m going to count one, two and say wide awake and you’ll

63 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
be able to open your eyes and look into your hand and it will feel stuck. It 
will be one of the funniest things that’s happened today. 
 
One, two – wide awake. Look at your hand. Notice it feels stuck, doesn’t 
it?  
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Also the harder you try, the more stuck it is. Give her a round of applause. 
It is the funniest thing she’s had today. That’s actually pretty funny, isn’t 
it? The more you try, the more funny it becomes because it’s pretty 
intriguing.  
 
What’s happening now is just close your eyes, just like that. Go deeper, go 
deeper and discover now when I snap my fingers, your hand can relax and 
you’ll be able to do this any time you want. One, two, three – now relax 
the hand. Let it fall away. You’ll be able to do that any time you want. Put 
the hand back there. Feel fun, feel joy and happiness every time you do 
that. That’s it.  
 
It gets stronger. You’re giving a gift to yourself and nod your head when 
you’re feeling that. Do it again. When you’re ready, do that again. Feel it 
get stronger? That’s right. You can see that on her face, can’t you? 
 
Demo 9 
 
Hypnotist: 
What I’d like you to do is go ahead and just look at that hand and notice 
the hand and if you’ll notice the lines on the hand and now pick a spot and 
then notice that spot. Focus all of your attention on that spot and as this 
hand comes closer to your eyes, you’re going to notice your eyes change 
focus.  
 
When your eyes change focus, just go ahead and let those eyes close and 
let yourself drift down inside into a deep and comfortable state of 
relaxation. That’s right. Just go ahead and close those eyes and go all the 
way down inside and just relax deeper and deeper. 
 
The deeper down inside you go, the better you feel, and more and more 
relaxed. You can feel your whole body just starting to relax. Just notice

how your arms are just becoming loose and limp. The deeper you go, the 
better you feel. The better you feel, you can find yourself drifting down in 
deeper and deeper and deeper. 
 
In a moment I’m going to count from one to three, and when I count to 
three you’ll open your eyes. After that when I say the word sleep, you’ll 
just go ahead and go down even deeper, even deeper into a deep state of 
relaxation. Go ahead and one, two, three – go ahead and open your eyes 
and sleep all the way down, all the way down and deeper. 
 
The deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel, the deeper 
you go. The deeper you go, the better you feel. The deeper you go, the 
better you feel. Just feel yourself relaxing deeper and deeper and deeper, 
and you can feel safe standing there knowing that you’re safe here and 
you’re relaxing deeper and deeper and deeper. 
 
In a moment I’m going to borrow this hand again. Just go ahead and lift 
this hand up here. What I’d like you to do is just go ahead and notice the 
sensations in this hand. I’d like you to imagine that there are 1,000 helium 
balloons just tied around the wrist of this hand, and you can just see all 
those bright colors of those balloons and just feel that hand starting to lift 
more and more and more as those helium balloons pull and just tug at 
that hand. 
 
You can feel it going higher and higher. That’s right. Just go ahead and see 
those balloons and feel what it feels like just to have those balloons right 
around that wrist just tugging. Notice that hand how it wants to rise, and it 
really wants to go up higher and higher and higher.  
 
You’re going to begin to find it funny when that sensation of that hand 
moving, as it’s pulling higher and higher. That’s right. That’s right. That’s 
perfect. You’ll notice the higher that hand goes, the funnier it feels. The 
funnier it feels, the higher it goes. Just go ahead and see those balloons, 
feel those balloons just pulling that hand higher and higher and higher. 
That’s right. That’s right. That’s right, all the way, all the way. 
 
 
Just go ahead and let those balloons continue holding that, and the higher 
it goes the funnier it becomes. It just becomes the funniest thing, like 
when a friend tells you the funniest joke you’ve ever heard before in your

life and you just can’t help but just laugh. The higher it goes, the funnier it 
becomes. That’s right.  
 
Demo 10 
 
Hypnotist: 
This arm’s going to start feeling light, like it’s tied to helium balloons. It’s 
started to feel light like it’s tied to helium balloons, pulled up by those 
balloons, getting higher and higher, lighter and lighter, all the way up into 
the sky now. That’s right lighter and lighter. It starts going up higher and 
higher into the sky all by itself, lighter and lighter all the way up. That’s 
right, all the way up into the sky, faster and faster.  
 
More helium is attached now. All the way up, quicker. You’re going to feel 
the center of that feeling into this profound state as long as it gets higher 
and higher, lighter and lighter. That’s right, all the way up. That’s right, 
moving by itself higher and higher into the sky now. That’s right, all the 
way up. That’s right, Veronica. That’s right. That’s right. 
 
I know you feel like you’re wide awake. You’re deeply asleep. That’s right. I 
want you to feel as if there’s been a steel block completely locked down to 
the floor now. You can’t lift it and you don’t know why. In a moment I’m 
going to tap you on the shoulder and you’ll realize your feet are 
completely stuck. Look at those feet and realize it’s weird that you can’t 
move them, isn’t it? You don’t know why you can’t move it. It’s stuck 
down completely. That’s right. It’s so strange. 
 
In a moment – close your eyes. Okay, Veronica, you’ve done great. I’ll let 
your feet become unstuck from the floor now and you’ll be wide awake, 
all suggestions washed away. Thank you for doing that. It’s weird how you 
felt stuck, wasn’t it?

Hypnotist: 
Put your hands out in front of you. Clasp your hands together nice and 
strong. Interlock your fingers like this, nice and strong and just bend your 
arms up towards your chin. Keep them together nice and tight. Feel the 
strength and the power in there.

Now in a second I’d like you to take these two fingers and put them about 
one inch apart, and this is the first test of your power of concentration. I 
want you to focus your energy between the space in those fingers and feel 
your magnetic personality pulling those fingers together. They’re going to 
touch.  
 
They are going to touch and when they touch, it’s going to feel really good. 
When they touch, you can just close your eyes and relax and go deeper 
and deeper, more and more relaxed. Deeper and deeper and you can put 
your hands at your side. Let them go loose and limp. Feeling good, feeling 
great.  
 
I’ll give you a third gift today, which is the ability to party as much as you 
want to party with your friends. You will not have a hangover tomorrow. 
You will feel great. When your pillow hits the bed, you’re going to sleep 
the best sleep that you’ve ever had in your entire life. 
 
On the count of three, I’m going to have your eyes open, wide awake. 
One, two, three – look at me. How are you feeling? 
 
Subject: 
Good. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re feeling good so far? 
 
Subject: 
So relaxed. Put me to sleep. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Okay, I’ll put you all the way out. You ready? Are you right-handed or left-
handed? 
 
Subject: 
Right handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Can I borrow that right hand? Here’s what I want you to do. Look at that 
right hand, focus on the lines of your hand and just pick out a single spot. 
In a moment I’m going to start moving it closer to your head and when I 
do, your eyes will change focus. 
 
As your eyes change focus, you can just have a deeper level of relaxation 
and now sleep, deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Let all of the tension go 
out of your body. As you let the tension go out of your body, your ability to 
go even deeper increases.

As your ability to go even deeper increase, your ability to relax even more 
also increases and you can have an absolutely phenomenal time during 
your little thing of street hypnosis here. 
 
In a second I’m going to bring your hand up and I’m going to get you in 
touch with a certain power inside of you, the power of invincibility, the 
power to be able to lift up. Are you doing okay? Your legs will hold you. 
You’re completely grounded. You’re able to stand on your own. You don’t 
need my assistance. 
 
Now in a second I’d like you to bring up this right arm, and I’d like you to 
think of the strongest time in your life, a time when you felt unstoppable, 
a time when you felt completely invincible and get in touch with that 
moment in just a second. 
 
Bring your arm up. Bring your arm up to your side. Make a fist. Make a 
nice tight fist and just feel the strength, feel the power locking in like a 
steel bar locking in. Imagine that you’re shooting out a beam over to the 
hotel over there. The strength, get that so strong, so tight that even if you 
wanted to move it, you could not.  
 
In a second I’ll bring over one of your friends and we’ll get them to test it. 
Have him try. Go ahead and try. Lock it in. Lock it in with that sense of 
invincibility, that sense of internal power and go deeper, deeper and 
deeper, more relaxed.

Hypnotist: 
And all you need to do is pay attention and have a sincere desire to be 
hypnotized. Close your hands just like that. Lock them together. Just pay 
attention to my voice. Bend your arms like you’re going to pray. You might 
need to.  
 
Now stick your fingers up here. Put a little gap about an inch between 
them because soon they’re going to touch. That’s right. Look at that space 
between your fingers and you’re welcome to join us. That’s right. Looking 
at that space between your fingers. Soon they’ll touch as you’re 
concentrating. You’re doing that perfectly.

As soon as your fingers touch – that’s right, you’re doing it exactly right. 
When your fingers touch, your eyes will get heavy and they’ll need to 
close. That’s perfectly normal. That’s right, everybody. Excellent. Perfect 
and you’re feeling that right now. Good. 
 
Now what I’m going to ask you to do is just one more thing. Cross your 
fingers and squeeze your hands really tight. Squeeze your hands really 
tight. That’s right. Exactly. You’re doing this perfectly right. 
 
As soon as your fingers touch, close your eyes. Excellent. That’s right. 
Perfect. Those of you who haven’t had their fingers touch yet, your eyes 
will close once your fingers touch. Keep taking a moment to just feel your 
hands squeeze tighter and tighter. That’s all right. You’re doing pretty 
good. 
 
Subject: 
Thank you. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re welcome. What I’m going to ask you to do is with your fingers 
squeezing tighter together, just take a deep breath in. I’m going to count 
one, two, three – eyes open. One, two, three – you can take your hands 
apart.  
 
What’s you’ve proven is that you can be hypnotized. Would you like to go 
any further? 
 
Subject: 
Sure. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Soon in a moment I’m going to just imagine – and you can imagine too. 
Your hands are full of magnets. Imagine your hands are full of magnets 
and as you look at that space between your hands, soon your hands will 
move closer and closer together.  
 
There is no wrong way to do this. That’s right. You’re feeling that right now 
because it’s automatic and it’s really funny. The more you laugh, the faster 
your hands move together. That’s right. The more you laugh, the faster 
you hands move together. Give him a round of applause. He’s doing really 
amazing. They’re awesome people. Fantastic.

Watch your hands move closer together. Once they touch – in a moment 
they’re going to touch and they’ll start to squeeze tighter and tighter 
together, feeling your hands squeeze so tight together that they become 
even stuck. 
 
Imagine they become stuck. Your hands are squeezing so tight they start 
to shake. They start to feel stuck and the harder you try, the more tightly 
your hands stick. That’s right. Now the harder you try, the funnier it 
becomes. That’s right. The harder you try, the funnier it becomes.  
 
Now in a moment I will count from one to three and your hands will fall 
loosely to your sides and you’ll be ready to be hypnotized. Is everyone 
okay with that? Is everyone on board with that?  
 
Okay, one, two, three – now you can release your hands ready to be 
hypnotized. Okay, relax. Awesome, you did really well. You should be 
congratulated and having a lot of relaxation right now. I’m going to go one, 
two, three. When I snap my fingers you’ll just close your eyes and go into a 
deep, deep state of sleep.  
 
One, two, three – only as deep as you want to go right now. One, two, 
three – just like that, only as deep as it feels good. That’s right. Give him a 
round of applause. You’re doing well. You’re doing exactly right. 
 
Now I’d like everyone to be quiet for a moment because this will require a 
little concentration. What I would like you to do with your eyes 
comfortably closed and keeping your eyes comfortably closed, feeling very 
comfortable, roll your eyeballs upwards looking through your eyelids at 
the same spot.  
 
Be very gentle with yourselves. Be very gentle. That’s right, and you start 
to feel your eyelids get heavy or stuck. You can move your eyebrows up 
and down. That’s not a test. That’s right. Move your eyebrows up and 
down and find that the harder you tuck in your eyelids like that, the 
heavier they feel. It’s pretty funny. 
 
It feels weird but every time you feel weird, it feels really funny. Now you 
can stop testing just like that and go even deeper. That’s right. Stop testing 
and go even deeper, feeling strong and secure.

In a moment you’re going to have a chance to relax 10 times deeper. 
You’re going to feel your arm. When I touch your arm, you’re going to feel 
your hand and make a fist. Then I’ll count from one – that’s a fist; two – 
your arm goes straight. Two, make your arm straight. Three – take all the 
stress out of your mind and push it into that arm. Take all the stress from 
your mind and push it into that arm. 
 
It becomes stiff and rigid. The harder you try to bend that arm, the stiffer 
and more rigid it becomes. Notice the harder you try to bend the arm, the 
better you feel. In fact you feel powerful, strong. Feel your arm becoming 
really strong. 
 
I’m going to count from one to three, and your eyes will be open. One, 
two, three – eyes open. Look at your arm totally strong and solid. You feel 
that, don’t you? Notice the harder you try to bend the arm, the stronger it 
becomes.  
 
I’m going to ask you to come over here. Come over here and tap this arm. 
Make sure it’s strong. Wow, someone else come over here. Okay, another 
volunteer. Give him a round of applause, and now ready? Close your eyes. 
Just close your eyes and sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper that’s it. You’re 
doing perfectly. 
 
This is what hypnosis feels like. As you know you can hear my voice, you 
can hear some things going on around you. You can feel very strong and 
solid. I would like you to discover something amazing about the super 
powers of your unconscious.  
 
Something that I would like you to remember is you are here to have some 
fun tonight. Is that true or false? Nod your head if that’s true. Okay, and so 
what I’m going to ask you to do in a moment is when I count from one to 
three, your eyes will open and you’ll actually be seeing the funniest movie 
you’ve ever seen. 
 
Do you remember seeing a really funny movie? You start to smile when 
you think about it. The giggles are starting again and now one, two, three 
– eyes open. You’re looking at the funniest movie. You look at each other 
and the more they laugh, the funnier it gets. That’s right.  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
71 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
The funnier it gets, the more they laugh, the more you laugh the funnier 
they laugh. That’s pretty funny. As you look at each other laugh – oh, it’s 
so funny. Oh my gosh.  
 
Now just sleep, that’s it. That’s it. Does she look like she’s hypnotized? 
Sleep. That’s right. No longer funny. Everything’s calm and normal. I’d like 
to have you guys give them a round of applause. Everybody that’s 
watching this show, give them a round of applause. They’ve been doing 
amazingly. 
 
Soon what I’m going to have you do in a moment is the same arm actually 
becomes very light. You’ll start to feel that arm become very light. It will 
actually rise all the way up to your forehead. When it touches your 
forehead, you feel this arm become very light. When it touches your 
forehead, you’re going to feel amazingly good, amazingly happy and 
amazingly good. 
 
When you feel that good feeling, as the hand gets closer it gets stronger. 
Once the hand touches your forehead, you start to press it into your 
forehead. Pressing the hand into your forehead because you’re feeling 
amazingly good, and you discover that now. 
 
Nod your head when you’re feeling good. That’s right. Now in a moment 
when I ask you to, your hand will feel stuck. Actually you actually 
suspected it to feel stuck already because it feels amazingly good. 
 
The harder you try, the more stuck your hand becomes. The harder you 
try, the better you feel. Notice that the harder you try, the better you feel. 
It’s feeling very good. You’re feeling that good feeling. 
 
I’m going to count one, two and say awake, and your eyes will be open. 
One, two – eyes open. Notice your hand is stuck. Try harder. That’s a really 
good feeling. The harder you try, the better you feel. Look around at your 
neighbor. It’s amazing. That’s amazing.  
 
What I’m going to ask you to do now is with your hands stuck, close your 
eyes. Just go inside and enjoy that pleasurable feeling. You can close your 
eyes and enjoy that pleasurable feeling because only you know what 
you’re feeling right now.

I’d like you to remember this feeling with your hand. Whenever you touch 
your hand to your forehead you will be able to remember this feeling. In 
fact you can transfer this feeling to anybody else.  
 
In a moment you’ll be able to transfer that feeling all the way to your feet 
and you’ll feel strong and rigid, stable, secure. Just when you release your 
hands and when I count from one to three, you’ll be able to release your 
hands. The feeling will transfer to your feet and you’ll feel strong, stable 
and secure.  
 
One, two, three – release your hands now. Feel that feeling going all the 
way to your feet and all the way back up to the top of your head, so you 
feel it double every time it goes back up to the top of your head. 
 
Now you’re feeling even better. As you’re feeling that, notice it’s a good 
feeling and you’re really strong. You’re actually stuck right there. Both of 
your feet feel stuck right there, and discover when I say one, two awake, 
your feet are stuck and everyone around here is actually wearing the 
weirdest shade of purple, which is going to be really silly and ridiculous like 
Barney. 
 
One, two, three – awake, eyes open. Notice how everybody’s wearing a 
weird shade of purple. Do you see that? Yes? It’s kind of interesting, isn’t 
it? Now you might start to remember something – because it’s pretty 
funny.  
 
Now I’d like you to close your eyes. Just go deeper, just go deeper. 
Excellent job. That’s right. As you’re feeling this good feeling, you totally 
recall that your name can change because your old name simply starts to 
fade and go way off, like the laser show off into the distance.  
 
Your old name just goes off and you seem to have it slip your mind. Nod 
your head when you’re on board with this. Okay, and one, two – awake. 
All right. Give him a round of applause. You’re doing amazing.  
 
Hi, I’m Michael. What’s your name? I didn’t get it before. Okay, sleep. 
That’s it. Sleep. That’s it. Now all the suggestions are cancelled except the 
useful ones. I’m going to count from one to five and you’ll return to your 
full awareness. You’ll remember your names. You’ll be able to move 
around. Every step you take you will feel better.

73 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
One – starting to feel a little better now. Two – getting ready to feel safe, 
protected and secure. Now three – feeling comfortable. Four – a pleasant 
feeling washes through your body. Five – opening your eyes feelings 
strong, able to move your feet and pick them up.  
 
Remember your name? My name’s Michael. What’s your name? Nice to 
meet you. What’s your name? 
 
Lauren: 
Lauren. 
 
Michael: 
You did excellently.  
 
Demo 12 
 
Hypnotist: 
… a state of hypnosis just relaxation moving through. You’re doing a great 
job, Mike. Now Mike, I just want to make sure your arms are nice and 
relaxed. I want to make sure you’re in a nice comfortable state. 
Everything’s good.  
 
Now in a moment, Mike, what I’m going to do is I’m going to ask you what 
your name is, and for the life of you you’re not going to be able to 
remember your name. Now it’s only temporary. It’s only while we’re 
standing here on the Strip and while I’m talking to you, but for the life of 
you you’re not going to be able to remember what your name is. 
 
Even if I actually tell you what your name is and ask you what your name is 
using your name, you’re not going to be able to think of what your name 
is. It’s going to be the funniest thing and you’re not going to figure out why 
this is going on, but it doesn’t really matter because you’re having fun and 
you’re in Las Vegas and everything’s cool. 
 
Mike, in a second I’m going to ask you to open your eyes. I’m going to 
count to three and I’m going to ask you to open your eyes. I’m going to ask 
you what your name is and you’re not going to be able to remember what 
your name is. You’re going to look over at your lovely wife and she’s going 
to ask you what your name is, and you’re not going to be able to 
remember what it is.

Even if she says Mike, what’s your name, you’re going to say I don’t know 
what my name is. It’s on the tip of my tongue. I had it a second ago but for 
some reason I can’t think of it anymore. 
 
One, two, three – open your arms. What’s your name?  
 
Subject: 
Giggling. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Really? Could you ask him what his name is please. 
 
Bystander: 
What’s your name? 
 
Subject: 
Giggling. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Isn’t that the funniest thing when it’s on the tip of your tongue and you try 
to remember what it is? I know what that is. I just can’t think of it.  
 
Demo 13 
 
Hypnotist: 
A happy strange feeling. Now I want you to try as you might, I want you to 
try and lift your hand off your head but it’s so tightly stuck to your head, as 
hard as you try you just will not be able to pull it. 
 
The harder you try, the funnier it becomes. The funnier it becomes – this is 
really funny, isn’t it? It’s strange, isn’t it? How on Earth is this happening 
that you can’t take your hand off your head? How did it get stuck there? 
That’s it. That’s wonderful. That’s wonderful. That’s wonderful and sleep, 
down, down. That’s wonderful. You’re doing a fantastic job there. 
Fantastic job.  
 
Okay, now as you sit there, you can sit there, stand there even, you can 
support your body and go deeply down into a wonderful state of 
relaxation. You came to Las Vegas and you had no idea what was going to 
happen to you, but you wanted to have a good time and you are going to 
have a good time. 
 
Your time is going to get even better. In fact your life is going to get even 
better. Why? Because you just came down the street tonight and the 
whole universe is going to just line up in front of you, and your life is just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
75 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
going to get mysteriously better for absolutely no reason at all. Does that 
not sound wonderful? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Absolutely wonderful. That’s great. Okay, in a few moments I’m going to 
count from one to five. When I get to five, you’re going to come back, 
you’re going to feel relaxed, refreshed and absolutely fantastic knowing 
that something crazily nice happened. You don’t know what it is and you 
don’t need to know and you don’t care. It was just funny. It was good and 
now you’re just going to have good feelings and good stuff for the rest of 
your life. 
 
One – you’re just starting to come back being aware of the noises around 
you. Two – coming more and more back. Three – just starting to take a 
nice breath. Four – just coming more and more back and five – coming 
back feeling relaxed, refreshed and absolutely fantastic. 
 
Subject: 
Thank you 
 
Hypnotist: 
Thank you very much. That’s it. That’s great.

yourself calming down. That’s right. Relax these arms all the way down to 
your side. That’s very, very good. Let’s go ahead and relax all the way 
down. 
 
I’m going to show you guys and exercise in just a brief moment. When you 
guys do that, you guys are going to begin to recognize that it’s just an 
exercise. We’re not actually doing hypnosis yet. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
77 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
What I want you guys to do is I want you to take your arms and place them 
straight out in front of you. Lock them all the way out, and what I want 
you to do is, clasp them together. Yeah, I know I’m that good. Go ahead 
and do it again and again and again and again. I know, thank you very 
much. Don’t worry we’re going to get to that in a second. 
 
Go ahead and keep your arms up there like there. Go ahead and clasp 
them together. Now I want you to interlace your fingers just like this. Lock 
them all the way in. Make those hands all the way tight, tight, tight, tight, 
tight together like you’re squeezing a lump of coal all the way into a 
diamond. That is perfect. Well done. 
 
Then what I want you to do is take your arms and I want you to bend them 
like you’re praying. Thank you Mr. Hypnotist so much for picking me. Now 
what I want you to do is I want you to take your index fingers and I want 
you to point them all the way up to the sky about an inch apart. I really 
want them an inch apart but I want you to squeeze really tight because in 
just a moment I want you to focus on that space right in between those 
fingers because in a moment they’re going to begin to come together. 
That’s right.  
 
Like magnets, they’re going to be coming together, come together, come 
together and when they touch, you’re going to relax completely, eyes shut 
and your whole body is going to get completely relaxed. That’s right, all 
the way down.  
 
Right when they touch, you’re going to relax completely. Sleep all the way 
down. Just relax. That’s right. Nice. It’s a good feeling and when they do 
touch – that’s right – let them go ahead and touch. Let them touch and 
when they do touch, you’re going to sleep. Relax all the way down. Just 
relaxing all the way down letting every muscle in your body completely 
relax all the way down. 
 
Now this is just an exercise. We’re not even doing hypnosis yet but you 
can recognize that the more and more I talk and the more and more you 
feel good – that’s right – the more and more you feel good and completely 
relaxed, that you begin to recognize that hypnosis is a really great place to 
be all the time if you want.

You can actually be in trance any time that feels good. When I count from 
one to three, you guys are going to come back in the room feeling 
absolutely amazing and ready to actually do some serious hypnosis.  
 
One – feeling phenomenal. Two and three – wide awake. Everybody give 
them a big round of applause. 
 
That was just an exercise, right? What I want you to do is I want you to 
take your right hand and stick it up in the sky like this. Turn around like this 
and go God, I’m so good. Oh, I’m so good at this. If you need a little bit of 
extra kudos, give yourself a little hug. That’s nice. Isn’t that cute? Cool. 
 
What I want you to do is I want you just to pick a spot right out there. I just 
want you to pick it just above eye line for me and when you do that, I want 
you to take a deep breath all the way into your chest right here. Good, and 
when you exhale I want you to relax and let it come all the way down into 
the belly. Good, one more time. Take a deep breath in, focus, focus, focus 
and sleep. Relax all the way down, relaxing your body all the way down. 
 
I want both of you just to watch how nice and comfortable this looks 
because as much as you can feel good, you can actually feel 10 times 
better than what he’s already feeling now. Good.  
 
The more and more you listen to the sound of my voice the more you hear 
the sound of my voice. The more and more relaxed you’re going to get, 
the more calm you’re going to get all the way down, so that even the 
smallest muscles in every arm and every toe and even this tiny little hair 
on the top your head right here is going to relax all the way down. Kind of 
cool, huh? Yeah, you like that? 
 
What I want you to do is I want you to look at him and I want you to 
actually imagine you’re him, right? I want you to imagine that you’re 
actually standing where he’s at because in just a second, you’re going to 
sleep. Good, relax all the way down. Relax, deep, deep, deep all the way 
down feeling 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times deeper than you’ve ever felt 
relaxed in your entire life. 
 
That’s nice, isn’t it? It’s nice to look at, right? Do me a favor and take this 
arm and stick it straight out in front of you. I want you to focus on your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
79 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
own arm. I want you to focus all the way out at that point where it’s 
pointing. Can you focus on that? Focus on that, focus on that.  
 
That’s good because I want you to in just a moment let that arm begin to 
drop. You can do that. You can do it on your own. You can watch it go. 
Good. Sleep all the way down. That’s right. Relax all the way down letting 
every muscle in your entire body relax all the way down. That’s good. 
 
In just a moment all three of you – I’m going to use the word relax. Every 
time you hear the word relax, you’re going to relax and be calm much 
more deep, much, much, much deeper all the way down and all the way 
down. Every time you hear the word relax, you’re going to feel really good, 
really calm – in fact so good that a smile is going to begin to creep itself up 
onto your face. 
 
I don’t know where it’s going to come from but you do. Every time you 
hear the word relax, you’re actually going to relax at the same time as you 
feel good. Every time I say the word relax, anybody can relax, right? We all 
can relax. We’ve had moments in life where we relaxed constantly, and 
every time you hear the word relax, that feeling is going to get bigger and 
bigger and bigger. 
 
You’re going to draw from every really funny experience. I don’t know if 
you’ve ever seen a comedy show but it’s going to begin to put a smile on 
your face. That’s right. It’s going to begin to put a bigger smile on your 
face. The more and more you relax, actually the better and better you feel.  
 
You, the person I am touching right here right now with my left hand right 
here, you suddenly start to itch. I have no idea where that itching is going 
to begin to start but when it does, you really want to itch it but you can’t. 
Your arms are absolutely dead. You can’t itch it.  
 
You’re going to want to find any other way you could possibly begin to itch 
that thing but you can’t itch it with your hands because your hands and 
your arms don’t work. You’re going to want to itch it. In fact in a second 
when I count from one to three, you’re going to open your eyes coming 
wide awake and you’re going to begin to look around for people in the 
room that could actually you itch your body. That’s right.

One, two, three – wide awake looking around. Who’s going possibly help 
you? Who’s going to? I mean I can’t because I’m busy but what’s itching 
on you? Are you itching? 
 
Subject: 
My knee. 
 
Johnny: 
Your knee? That hand absolutely doesn’t work. The more and more you 
want it, the more and more you want to use that hand, the more and 
more you can’t use that hand. The more and more you want to use that 
hand, that itch is going to jump. As the itch jumps from place to place on 
your body – that’s right – that itch is going to jump and jump and jump 
and jump. 
 
It’s actually not an itch at all. It’s a bug. It’s a little bug that’s bugging you. 
That’s right. It’s absolutely bugging you and it’s all over the place. That’s 
right. It’s moving, it’s moving, it’s shifting. Where’s that bug at? It’s kind of 
annoying but you really don’t know what to do with it. That’s right.  
 
That’s absolutely right. It’s bugging you but you’re going to stay 
completely safe on this stage. Even though that bug is completely bugging 
you, there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it because it’s just there.  
 
Now that you’re up on stage and knowing and recognizing that you are 
here, that’s exactly right. The more that bug jumps and bounces and pisses 
you off – that’s right. It’s getting really annoying. It’s not just annoying 
anymore. It is extremely annoying. You’re going to want to shift and get it 
off of you but you can’t because now your feet are locked to the floor. 
 
Now the only thing you can do is just try and breathe as best as possible, 
hoping to God that insect, that bug, that thing that’s been bugging you is 
actually going to try and go away on its own. That’s right. That’s exactly 
right. 
 
In three seconds I’m going to count from three to one. When I do, you’re 
going to drop completely into a deeper trance. One, two and three – relax 
all the way down, relaxing all the way down. That’s right. 
 
There is no longer a bug bugging you. Good, calm. In a moment I’m going 
to touch one of you. In a moment I’m going to touch one of you. When I 
do touch you, you suddenly are attracted, completely and utterly attracted 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
81 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
to the first person you look at. They are the person that you’ve wanted to 
look at and be connected to for your entire life. That’s right. 
 
The first person I touch – that’s right – you right here. When I count from 
one to three, your eyes are going to come open, you’re going to look out 
in the audience and you’re going to find one person that you’re absolutely 
totally and completely attracted to. However, you’re one of those people 
that you’ve never had the guts to be able to tell them how much you 
actually care about them, how much you actually love them, how much 
you actually want to take care of them for the rest of your life. So all 
you’re going to find yourself doing is starting kind of like a creeper. 
 
You’re just going to find yourself looking at them and looking at them and 
looking at them. It’s going to feel really good because the more and more 
you look at them, the better and better you feel starting from the heart 
and gravitating all the way up, but not until I get done counting from one 
to three. 
 
One, two, three – eyes open. Go ahead and find them. Okay, the person 
I’m touching right here – that’s right – right here. You are officially a tickle 
monster. You have this unbelievable desire to tickle someone. It doesn’t 
matter who it is. It could be anybody on this stage. It could be me but the 
problem is you’re stuck. You can’t move. You are stiff and rigid, stuck 
exactly where you are on this stage. 
 
You will reach as far as you can with that hand to tickle someone, anyone 
that you can possibly tickle on the count of three. One, two, three – wide 
awake. Open your eyes. That’s right. Hi. Good. Sleep. Relax all the way 
down. That’s right. Relax all the way down. 
 
You’re finding yourself perfectly balanced, standing perfectly balanced. 
The more you stand, the better you feel. The better you feel, the more you 
can relax completely. In just a moment I’m going to say one, two, three 
sleep. Relax all the way down feeling good, completely relaxed all the way 
from the top of your head to the tips of your toes, relaxing all the way 
down completely. 
 
Every suggestion I’ve said on this stage, all the silly little suggestions I said 
on this stage can immediately begin to vanish like a wisp of smoke. They 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
82 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
can float away like you’re watching them wisp poof, all the way out into 
the distance.  
 
The faster and faster you allow that wisp of smoke to merely float away, 
the better and better you’re going to feel knowing that you are and have 
always been capable of being an amazing hypnotist. That’s absolutely 
right. Every breath you take, every breath you take – that’s right, I said 
every breath you take for the rest of today and for the rest of your life will 
only reaffirm the fact that you are and have always been an amazing 
hypnotist. 
 
I’m going to count from one to five and when I do count from one to five, 
I’m going to bring you back into the room feeling absolutely phenomenal. 
Not just phenomenal, but fantastic. Not just fantastic or phenomenal, but 
absolutely amazing as if you could take amazing and phenomenal and stick 
them together like Play-Doh.  
 
When you take those two feelings or three feelings and you stick them all 
the way through your body, I want to make sure you feel them all the way 
from the tips of your toes to the top of your head but only when I count to 
five.  
 
Coming back into the room – one. Taking a deep breath, feeling 
phenomenal – number two. Letting the energy rush all the way back up 
into your body – number three. A big deep breath. Everybody take a big 
deep breath on three. Four – coming back into the room feeling absolutely 
phenomenal and five – wide awake. Everybody, please. 
 
The Michael Show 
 
Hypnotist: 
Hello. I’d like two volunteers. Come up here please. That’s right. One 
more. The first one’s the bravest. Give him a round of applause. One more 
volunteer. Excellent. Please come up. Give her a round of applause. 
Excellent. 
 
All right, now I am about to hypnotize you and I know both of you are 
excellent candidates because I have seen what you’re able to do. What I’d 
like you to do is take your hands – both hands - just lend them to me. 
Good. Excellent. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
83 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Now I’d like you to stand over here. Come over here. That’s good. 
Excellent. Step back a little bit. Step back a little bit. All right, with both 
your hands, stick them in front of you like this. Cross one over the other. 
Okay, that won’t work. Let’s do it this way. Excellent job. Now squeeze 
them really tight, so tight they start to shake and as you’re feeling them 
squeeze so tight, they begin to shake. 
 
Just discover, sleep and relax. That’s right. Just relax. That’s perfect. Now 
you can feel a pleasant reason to let go of this and just relax more. That’s 
it. Begin to relax now. That’s it. Sleep and relax. Let the arms fall.  
 
What I’d like you to do now is release your fingers and follow my 
directions. That’s it, this way and that way. Look at this hand. Stare right at 
this hand and you continue to relax as you’re listening to me speak. Look 
at the lines on this hand and look at the spot. As you see the spot move 
closer, the gaze on your eyes, become more aware of your eyes. Your eyes 
will need to close. 
 
After you close your eyes, feel safe and relax all the way down. Soon 
you’re going to feel one of your hands begin to become very light, feeling 
strong and stable. As you feel your feet planted on the floor, one of your 
hands will become very light, floating up as if supported by a cushion of 
air. 
 
As you’re starting to feel that arm rise up a little more, you feel a lighter 
sense of wellbeing, a greater sense of wellbeing, lighter emotions. As you 
discover your arm rising – that’s right, exactly – your arm rising up. You’re 
doing this correctly, feeling your arm rise a little more. Excellent job, just 
discovering as you’re feeling that, the arm is going up, up, up. You’re 
already feeling that by now. Excellent job. 
 
The higher the arm goes, the better you feel. You notice you can release 
all of the stress from your mind and body and push it into that arm. While 
you feel this greater sense of wellbeing, the arm goes higher and higher. 
Excellent. 
 
Notice right now, soon in a moment I will ask you to release all of the 
tension. Let your arm fall to your sides, just going 10 times deeper, 10 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
84 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
times deeper. That’s right. One, two, three – relax your arm. That’s it, 
going 10 times deeper. Excellent job, feeling strong and stable and secure. 
 
Now you can stand strong, stable and secure. The person I’m touching on 
the shoulder right now, when I count from one, two and I tell you to open 
your eyes, you will open your eyes. You will discover that you are here in 
the room all alone. Everybody has left. You seemed to have slept through 
the rest of the seminar and that’s perfectly okay.  
 
You actually feel that you are a rock star and you know that, and you just 
have the rest of the room to play with. Ready? One, two – awake. Give 
him a round of applause. All right, give him a round of applause.  
 
You continue to relax feeling strong and stable. In a moment when I count 
from one to three, you’re aware of everyone being around here and you 
have no idea why that guy’s acting goofy as you realize that you’re safe. 
 
One, two, three – eyes open feeling safe and noticing you have no idea 
why that guy’s acting goofy but we’ll hide over here. That’s right. You’re 
okay. I will protect you. You’re protected. I’m going to go take care of that. 
You stay right here. Now sleep. That’s it. Perfect. Excellent. Okay, stand up 
on your feet. Close your eyes and sleep. That’s it. Excellent. Now come 
over here. What do you do for a living? 
 
Subject: 
I’m a nurse in a jail. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Thank you. Thank you very much. What I’m going to ask you to do is while 
we didn’t really understand what was going on over there, did we? We 
were just totally baffled. You’ve seen weird behaviors like that before, 
haven’t you?  
 
Okay, what I’m going to ask you to do is become something calm. Give me 
your other hand. That’s good. You have a really strong grip on your left 
arm. I’m going to shake your hand three times and your eyes will become 
very heavy on the first shake. On the second shake they will become 
impossible to remain open. They will need to close. On the third shake 
you’ll go into a deep trance. Do you understand? 
 
One – your eyes are getting heavier. Three – close your eyes and go into a 
deeper trance than before. That’s right. Are you feeling that right now?

85 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
The person I’m touching on the shoulder, when I say one, two open your 
eyes, you will open your eyes and you will realize that you are the 
toughest, burliest, strongest police officer in the jail. In fact nobody can 
touch you. Everyone is scared of you. You remain on the stage and your 
entire role is to tell everyone who’s making any noise to be quiet because 
that’s against the law to make noise or to laugh. 
 
You start one, two – awake. The person I’m touching on the shoulder right 
now, you’re going to discover that you are a parrot and when I say one, 
two awake… 
 
Subject: 
Shut the fuck up. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re starting to make the noise of a parrot. One, two – awake. Give him 
a round of applause. Stay on the stage. Sleep. Now feeling stable, safe and 
secure. Move a little to your right, turning to your right, relaxing your 
arms, closing your eyes. Relax and just go even deeper still. That’s right. 
 
Subject: 
That’s right, yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
That’s it. Give our stars a round of applause. We’re going to do one final 
thing. I’m going to ask you to just follow the sound of my voice. When I 
count from one to five, you will regain that wonderful sense of 
exhilaration, wellbeing and confidence. All the silly suggestions will be 
cancelled. You’ll get to keep the beneficial and useful ones.  
 
One – coming back slowly, feeling that strong energy surge all the way up 
through your feet, up to the top of your head. That’s right. Two – feeling 
even better, healthier and stronger. Three – physically, mentally and 
emotionally well and secure. Four – that’s it – all the way rushing up to the 
top of your head. Five – opening your eyes, feeling wonderful and 
returning to the stage.  
 
The Colin Show 
 
Hypnotist: 
What we’re going to now is we’re just going to demonstrate the power of 
the hypnosis, the power of the mind. I know that you two already have 
experienced hypnosis many times before, have you not? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
86 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
All right, so that’s good. Good stuff. What I’d like to do first of all is just put 
your hands out this way. Clasp the hands together tightly. Now bend the 
elbow. Can you follow Chris as well please? Bend the elbows. 
 
Now tighten your hands together. Tighten them together, tighten them 
together. Focus your attention on the hands. Focus your attention on the 
hands. I’d like you to open the fingers this way. Focus on the space in 
between. As you focus on that space in between, in a moment – in a 
moment as if like magic, you’re going to pull together. 
 
As you draw them together, you’re going to find this irresistible urge to 
allow your eyes to close and just allow the arms to drop and drift. That’s 
right. Sleep now. That’s right, taking full responsibility for maintaining a 
steady position on the stage. That’s right. Just allow that focus, allow that 
focus.  
 
The closer they get, the closer they get, the better you feel. The better you 
feel, the more relaxed you’ll become and let the eyes close only when they 
come together, just at that point. That’s right. That’s right. Just sleep now. 
Excellent! Deeper, deeper and every time I touch you in this way you’ll go 
deeper and deeper still. In a moment I’m going to ask you to open your 
eyes and get ready to go into an even deeper place of trance where all the 
suggestions I make, you’ll take on instantly and assimilate them for the 
purpose of this session that we’re doing here today. 
 
Just nod your head both of you, if you would. Just let me know if that’s 
okay. Excellent. I’m going to count from one to three. On the count of 
three, come out and get ready to go into a deeper place. 
 
One, two and three – open your eyes wide awake. Feel good? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Do you feel okay? Good. All right, I want you to just focus on my eyes now. 
Focus on my eyes. Focus on my eyes. Sleep. That’s right, deep down, so 
deep, so deeply relaxed. Take your full responsibility for maintaining a 
steady position here on the stage. That’s right. So deeply relaxed. Good.

87 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel, the more 
relaxed you’ll become. The more relaxed you become, it just goes on and 
on and on. That’s right. Just relax. Good.  
 
I’d like you to if you would just press down. Give me your hand. Just press 
down on your palm. Focus your attention into my eyes. Look into my eyes. 
I’m going clip my fingers and say sleep, down, down. Right, there you go. 
Just take full responsibility to maintain a steady position. That’s right. 
Feeling good, feeling absolutely alive.  
 
The stronger you feel, the more stable you feel and the more relaxed you 
become. That’s right. In a moment when I touch you in this way, you’re 
going to come out and you’re going to have an amazing ability, an ability 
to read palms. You’re going to look into the audience and you’re going ask 
somebody to come, and you’re going to be able to read into their past. 
That’s right. 
 
You’re going to read into the past. You’re going to be able to read and 
come up with some funny situations that are not too intimate, but funny 
situations that make the audience laugh. Just nod your head yes if you 
understand that. Excellent. That’s right. Good. 
 
Crissy, in a few moments I’m going to ask you to come outside, note I talk 
now to your actual awareness. You’re going to be an opera singer. You’re 
going to be able to sing this way. When you hear my voice in this way, 
you’re going to be able to sing and break into an opera song. That’s right. 
Okay, excellent. 
 
We’re ready now to talk straight to your awareness, coming back to this 
place feeling good. Excellent. How are you doing? 
 
Subject: 
Good. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Yes, I believe you’ve got this special ability to read palms. Is that right? 
 
Subject: 
Yes. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Would you like to give us a demonstration?

Subject: 
Normally I don’t, but sure. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Just choose anybody in the audience who’d like to have their palm read. 
Sure, give them a round of applause.  
 
Audience Member: Hi, nice to meet you. 
 
Subject: 
Hello, good to meet you. Have you ever had your palm read before? 
 
Audience Member: No, I never have. 
 
Subject: 
Are you an animal lover at all? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Subject: 
Yes? Did you ever have an interesting situation with a gorilla before? 
 
Audience Member: No, not with a gorilla. 
 
Subject: 
Not in the forest or anything like that? 
 
Audience Member: No, not in the forest.

Audience Member: No. 
 
Subject: 
No? Interesting. 
 
Audience Member: No gorilla. 
 
Subject: 
No family member has? 
 
Audience Member: No. No family member has an orangutan. 
 
Subject: 
So that’s close. It’s ball-parking it, I guess. Let me see your other hand. No 
UFO abductions at all? 
 
Audience Member: Not that I know of.

Subject: 
That jagged one that looks like Interstate 15, that’s not like you’ve never 
been to another planet? Nothing like that?

Mars? 
 
Audience Member: Yes, Mars. 
 
Subject: 
Recently? Like in the recent present?

Oh, okay. 
 
Audience Member: The ground was really red. 
 
Subject: 
Yeah and warm. 
 
Audience Member: Very, very warm. 
 
Subject: 
Yeah, okay. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Can you tell him anything about his past just before this few minutes? 
 
Subject: 
It seems kind of strange because usually I’m better at reading the backs of 
your hands. 
 
Audience Member: Oh, okay. Excellent. 
 
Subject: 
And the lack of hair in this area means your parents are divorced, right? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Subject: 
Yeah, okay. Although this one hair right here, it was when you were a child 
they got divorced, right? 
 
Audience Member: Yes.

Subject: 
Do you have a fear of roller coasters? 
 
Audience Member: No, I like roller coasters. 
 
Subject: 
Well, then its clowns. It’s something. It’s like carnival acts – carnies – like 
short… 
 
Audience Member: Midgets yeah.

Okay, so that’s pretty correct. Are you sure you haven’t been Mars, like 
years ago?

Huh, okay. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re doing a great job, a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen. Good 
job. Now sleep. Good. Excellent. Now I want you to just look into my eyes.

way – la-da-da-de-la-da-da-de – you’re going to be able to sing opera. I 
don’t know how you know it. You can sing opera and everybody’s going to 
give you a big round of applause. The audience is going to clap so loudly. 
That’s right. 
 
On the count of three, you can come outside and wow the audience. 
That’s right. One, two, three - la-da-da-de-la-da-da-de. I believe you’re an 
opera singer, aren’t you? Go la-da-da-de-la-da-da-de.

give you a shout later on.

you think hypnosis is? 
 
Michael: 
A state of high suggestibility. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Correct. Now look, all of you are right, okay, but hypnosis is all about using 
your imagination. It’s all about using your concentration. It’s all about 
relaxing, trusting me but most important trusting yourselves that you can 
do this. 
 
Hypnosis only works if you want it to work but I’m going to make you feel 
awesome about yourself. You’re going to go away from this restaurant and 
make sure you come back in two weeks’ time because you loved the 
entertainment, you loved the food.  
 
This is where you plug the restaurant, the manager gets excited, he books 
me for another 10 years. Sorted. So you know, you say this and you say 
this especially when the manager is walking past, okay? That would be 
good. 
 
All right, so you do all of that stuff. That’s the pre-talk by the way. If 
anyone heard that, I did a pre-talk. Now what I’ve achieved from the pre-
talk is this is what I want from you and this is what you’re going to get 
from me. Okay? 
 
You’re going to feel fantastic. You’re going to feel great. They’re partying. 
They’re having a few drinks. There are all sorts of people there and my 
goal is to get every single table looking at me. Yeah. Anthony said earlier 
on, well yesterday, he’s not the type of guy who wants the attention. I do. 
I’m an entertainer. I want them to book me and 95% of the time, everyone 
will take my business card. I don’t tell them that look, here’s my business

card. They’ll come up to me because they love the entertainment. People 
will look around and they’ll be like right, come here. Okay? 
 
I’m not going to do anything stupid because that’s going to put them off. If 
they book me for a private party and that’s what they want then may be. 
So guys, ready for a bit of fun? Awesome! Great. Okay, put your feet 
together for me. Fantastic. Okay, extend your hands out for me just like 
so. That’s good.  
 
Interlock your fingers thumbs across nice and tight for me. Okay, now look 
at one spot on your thumb. Now this is I’m looking if they’re 
concentrating. If they’re looking at their girlfriend in the seat next to them, 
I’m not interested. I want to get their concentration. 
 
So look at one spot on your thumb for me. That’s good. Keep your eyes 
fixated on that one spot. Now put your hands into a praying position just 
like so. Now take your two index fingers and put them one inch apart. Now 
look at the gap in the index fingers because in a moment your fingers will 
come closer and closer together. 
 
Some of you might be there but when they touch, just close your eyes for 
me and just relax and sleep. Deeper sleep, every nerve, every fiber. You’re 
doing fantastic. Close your eyes and sleep. Deeper sleep, every nerve, 
every fiber as much as you want and just totally relaxing. 
 
The more I rock your body, the more deeper and the more relaxed you’re 
going to go. Guys, you’re doing absolutely fantastic. In a moment I’m going 
to wake you and you’re going to be ready for your next instruction. Just 
nod your head if you understand. Good. 
 
One, two – open your eyes. Good. That’s showing me you all have got a 
good imagination and concentration. We’re going to take this one step 
further. In a moment I’m going to ask you to put your hands out like this. 
Not now. I know you’re excited. Okay, you’ve had a bit too much to drink. 
Just calm down, that’s good. 
 
In a moment I’m going to ask you to put your hands out like this. I want 
you to imagine there are two powerful strong magnets on the palms of 
your hands. Your hands will come closer and closer and closer together.

When they touch, your hands will drop. Your hands will fall down towards 
your neck and you’re going to go into a deep state of relaxation and 
hypnosis. Ready? Good. So guys, put your hands about six inches apart. 
That’s good. Is that six inches, sir? Okay, that’s good. 
 
Now what we’ll do is just look at the gap. Close your eyes for me, 
everyone. I want you to imagine there are two powerful strong magnets. 
Your hands will come closer and closer together. That’s right. 
 
When they touch, they’ll just drop. Your feet will support you and you can

your body is totally, totally relaxing. You’re feeling absolutely fantastic. 
 
The person I’m just touching now you just want to open your eyes. Just 
look at your friends. You can take a bit of film if you want and just stick it 
on YouTube and we’ll show everyone how funny friends get later on. 
That’s good. Okay. 
 
Guys, in a moment I’m going to say one, two – open your eyes. You’re 
going to open your eyes and you’re going to be ready for your next 
instruction. One, two – open your eyes. Good.  
 
Sir, are you right-handed or left-handed? 
 
Subject: 
Right-handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Right-handed. Can I just borrow your right hand? That’s good. Just take a 
look at one spot on your right hand for me and keep your eyes fixated on 
that one spot because in a moment your hand will come closer and closer 
and closer towards your face.

98 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
As your hand comes closer and closer towards your face, it’s going to 
change the focus in your eyes. As you see the change in focus in your eyes, 
you can just relax your eyes. Close them and sleep for me. Deeper sleep.  
 
As I rock your body, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you 
feel about yourself. The person I’m touching now, this is you. Everything I 
say will instantly and automatically become your reality. Everything I say 
will instantly and automatically become a reality.  
 
You are now a statue. Wherever I place your hand, whatever I say to you, 
you will instantly go into that position. Now this is a restaurant by the way, 
and I do this routine all the time. I like to make them a statue. I like to 
make them believe they’re the waiter and like they’re working for me. 
 
In a moment I’m going to say one, two open your eyes. You’re going to 
open your eyes and wherever I put you, you’re a statue. I can move your 
hand but you have no control over your body. Just remember, and you’re 
going to enjoy this feeling of me taking control over you. Yes, that’s right. 
 
One, two – open your eyes. That’s good. See this hand? See how I can just 
go like this and it just stays there? That’s good. Try moving it and find that 
you cannot. Try and move it and find you cannot.  
 
Now normally I’ll take my jacket off. Can I just borrow one of you guy’s 
jackets? Is that all right? That’s good. Try moving it and just find that you 
cannot. That’s right. That’s good.  
 
Then I’ll actually just keep him in that position for a moment and just take 
advantage of him, like a statue, just like so. Thank you very much. I’ll tip 
you later on. 
 
Hi, sir. How are you doing? Yeah, that’s good. Yeah? You like it? Just sleep.

the only thing you can see is my head and nothing else. (Click) Okay, that’s 
good. That’s good. All right, then I’ll just carry on performing. I want to get 
everyone involved and I’ll get people involved from the audience, from the 
tables and let them become the hypnotist.  
 
I’ll get them involved and hopefully draw them into my crowd, and then 
hypnotize the other tables. I’m just going to wake them out of hypnosis. 
Just give them a big round of applause and they’re going to go back and 
hopefully you can go and do this. 
 
Now the great thing about all of this is I’m using the same techniques that 
have been taught to you, but from this I’ll get so many clients. I’ve had a 
lady who works for the NHS back in U.K. who’s got me on their stop

because there are going to be like magnets on my hands, and those hands 
are going to come drawing together. Not yet for you. Just watch what’s 
happening, and they’re going to come together. 
 
When my hands touch together, my head’s going to drop and I’m going to 
be completely relaxed like there are magnets on them, and they are

your face, you’ll go deeper. Very good. Very good. All right. 
 
I’m going to lift this arm and that arm is going to become – it’s going to 
take its own weight. It’s going to be like an invisible wire holding that arm 
up. Very good. Very good. That arm will just be weightless. Your hand 
floats closer and closer to your face. Closer and closer and closer and when 
that hand touches your face and your hand is floating upward, and as that 
hand floats up you’re enjoying a wonderful memory. 
 
A wonderful memory comes flooding back to you. Very good. This arm is 
floating up, lighter and lighter and as that arm floats up towards your 
head, a wonderful memory is coming back to you. A wonderful memory is 
coming back to you. Very good. 
 
Just allow that hand to float up. The better you feel, the stronger that 
memory comes and you can try to pull that arm away. You can try and 
you’re a strong guy. You can try hard. Try hard to pull that arm away. All 
right, you can stop trying now. Just relax and that’s a very odd thing. You

become a chuckle. It could become a laugh. It can become an outrageous 
guffaw. That’s right. Very good.  
 
It is terribly funny. Yes, and the funnier and funnier it becomes as that arm 
floats down, and just enjoy that feeling. Enjoy that so much and stop. Just 
relax. Very good. All right. What shall we do with you? All right, I’m going

to you in the past, and just keep that memory with you.  
 
Allow that arm to float down only as quickly as you can have a wonderful, 
wonderful memory. You can allow this arm to float down only as quickly as 
you can have a wonderful memory of success and happiness. That’s right.

Hypnotist: 
Into a really deep state of relaxation. That’s it. Almost there– almost there, 
that’s it. Down, down, deep, deep state of relaxation. That’s absolutely 
wonderful. You are doing a fantastic job. 
 
The deeper you go, the more relaxed you feel. The more relaxed you feel, 
the more comfort can start to spread all through your body, and you can 
just think good thoughts. All that negative crap that was in your life, let it 
just disappear into the atmosphere, gone forever, never to be seen again. 
Only happy thoughts, that’s what we need here, only happy thoughts. 
 
Again I’m going to count from three to one. When I get to one, you’re just 
going to come back and then we’re going to try another thing, okay?

105 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Hypnotist: 
Can I take that right hand? Oh, that’s it. That’s fantastic. Now I want you to 
look at this right hand here. I want you to stare at the lines on your hand. 
Focus on the lines in your hand. Focus on those lines in a particular spot 
and notice that your hand is coming towards your face and vision is 
starting to get a little bit blurred now. 
 
When your hand touches your face, your eyes are going to close, head’s 
going to fall forward and you’re go into a – that’s it – deep state of 
relaxation. That’s it. Let your hand fall down. 
 
The deeper you go, the more relaxed you can feel. That’s absolutely 
fantastic. Wonderful, wonderful feeling of relaxation. That’s it. That’s it. 
Absolutely wonderful. Now I’m going to touch you on your right hand and 
when I start touching you on the right hand, your hand’s going to start to 
rise like it’s got a mind of its own, like it’s coming up towards your face. 
 
As I start touching your hand, your hand’s going to feel like it wants to 
move, like it wants to rise, like it’s on a cushion of air. That’s it. That’s it. 
That’s it. That’s it. It’s starting to rise up now, rise up more and more. 
That’s it. More and more like a cushion of air is underneath your hand and 
it’s lifting your hand up. It’s lifting your hand up, lifting it up, lifting it up, 
lifting it up more and more. That’s it. 
 
The more it comes up, the easier it becomes and it starts moving towards 
your face. It starts moving towards your face slowly. That’s it. More and 
more that’s it. The more it comes, the easier it becomes. The easier it 
becomes closer it’s coming to your face.  
 
When it gets to your face, it’s going to become stuck on your face and 
you’re going to go even deeper and more relaxed, deeply, deeply. That’s 
it. Almost there, almost there, that’s it. Down you go and your hand is now 
stuck to your head. 
 
Your hand is now stuck to your head. Now I want you to try, I want you to 
try really hard to take your hand off your head. I want you to really try 
hard. The harder you try, the more difficult it’s going to become because 
it’s stuck to your head. Now let it go and it will drop down. Relax, relax. 
That’s it.

The deeper you go, the more relaxed you become. That’s absolutely 
wonderful. That’s wonderful. Now I want you just to squeeze your finger 
and your thumb together like that. Squeeze your finger and your thumb 
together like that.  
 
Now I want you to think of some fantastic wonderful feeling of your past, 
some really happy and positive feeling and squeeze those fingers together. 
I want you to squeeze those fingers together and think of something really 
happy, some really nice happy experience that you’ve had in the past, 
something that made you laugh, that made you just burst from the inside 
out – joy, real happiness, real happiness.  
 
I can see it on your face now. It’s starting to build and as I touch your 
shoulder here now, every time I touch you, I want it to build more and 
more and more. That’s it. It’s starting to build. That happiness is starting to 
build.  
 
Squeeze your thumb and forefinger together and the more you squeeze, 
the more it doubles itself and trebles itself. 
 
Demo 3 
 
Hypnotist: 
I’d like you guys to put your hands up in front of you like this. Go ahead 
and clasp your hands together nice and tight. Put your arms up like you’re 
making a desperate prayer. That’s right. Go ahead and put your fingers 
about an inch apart – index fingers. Go ahead and focus on that space in 
between your index fingers. 
 
In a moment those fingers are going to close and touch each other, just 
like magnets. That’s right. That’s right. As they close, close your eyes and 
sleep, sleep, sleep. That’s right.  
 
As you go deeper, the better you feel. The better you feel, the deeper you 
go. The better you feel, the deeper you go. The better you feel, the deeper 
you go. I’d like you guys to remember a time in your past, a wonderful 
experience that you had. I’d like you to bring up that feeling. Let that 
feeling well up inside you to a peak. That’s right.

Allow your hands to just relax at your sides. Let that feeling keep brewing 
up inside you. Let it well up and at the moment it peaks, I’d like you to 
touch your thumb to your index finger. All right, and as I bring you back up 
on the count of three, you’re going to bring that feeling back with you and 
any time that you touch your thumb to your index finger, you’ll experience 
that wonderful feeling. One, two, three. 
 
Demo 4 
 
Hypnotist: 
Can I get a volunteer? All right, we’re going to try and do a little hypnosis 
here today. What I’d like you guys all to do is stick your hands straight out. 
Put your feet together and face me. There you go. Put your hands straight 
out. Now bring them together, slap them together. That’s right. Slap them 
together. Hold them really tight. Bend at the elbows like you’re praying.  
 
Now I want you to stick your fingers out. Pull them out about an inch 
apart. That’s right, about an inch apart. As they come together, you’ll find 
yourself closing your eyes as they come together and touch. As they touch, 
I want you to close your eyes. That’s right. Deeper and deeper. 
 
The more you relax, the deeper you go. That’s right. That’s right. You can 
stand on your own power. That’s right. You can stand on your own feet. 
That’s right. Down deeper and deeper. Down. That’s right. Just stand on 
your own strength. Stand completely relaxed. That’s right. Down deeper 
and deeper. That’s right. Completely relaxed. 
 
Now in a second – just go ahead and stand on your own. That’s right. In a 
second I want you to come back out of trance, bringing with you that 
knowledge that you can be hypnotized deep into trance, into a deep 
hypnotic state. 
 
On the count of three, I’m going to bring you back out of trance. One – 
starting to feel more awake and alert. Two – starting to feel this power of 
being able to be hypnotized. Three – awake, ready to be hypnotized again. 
 
All right, what I want you to do now is I want you to just – are you right-
handed?  
 
Subject: 
Yes.

Hypnotist: 
You are right-handed. Let’s see your right hand. Can I borrow that from 
you? What I want you to do is just look at your hand. Just gaze at your 
hand. See the lines in your hand and focus on one spot in your hand. 
That’s right. Just focus on one spot. I want you to focus on that one spot, 
realizing your vision changes as you focus. 
 
As that point happens, I want you to sleep. That’s right, sleep. Deep into 
trance. There you go. Deeper and deeper. The more you relax, the deeper 
you go. That’s right. Now just stand there on your own power. That’s right. 
That’s right. Sleep, deeper and deeper. Deep into trance. That’s right. 
Deeper and deeper. 
 
Just stand there on your own power. That’s right. That’s right. Look into 
my eyes, and I want you to completely relax. That’s right. Just gaze into my 
eyes and relax. Sleep, deeper and deeper into trance. There you go.  
 
Just stand there on your own power. That’s right. There you go. Everybody 
just stand there on your own power. You can hear my voice. You can hear 
the crowd walking around you and yet my voice drives you deep into a 
trance. The more you hear my voice, the deeper you go. 
 
Now I want you to hold your hand up. Just hold that hand right up like 
that. That’s right. Excellent job. You’re doing great. Hold that hand up. 
There you go. Hold it right up like that. Excellent. Excellent. There you go. 
Just hold that.  
 
Now what I want you to do is I want you to think of a time in your life, a 
wonderful time in your life when you had just the happiest moment that 
you can think of. When that time comes to you, just give me a big smile, a 
big smile. Yes, that’s right. That’s a good time. How about you? You’ve got 
a great moment in your life. Give us a big smile. That’s right, a big smile. 
 
You can think of a time, a very happy joyous time in your life. I want you to 
think of that time. That’s right. Now what I want to do is I want to increase 
that feeling, so just allow your arm to drop. Allow it to drop down 
increasing that feeling of relaxation, that feeling of joy and that happiness 
that you had. That’s right. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
109 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Bring that arm back up, back up. There you go. There you go. There you 
go. Once again I want that feeling of joy, that feeling of happiness that you 
get. I want it to intensify two times more. Just drop your arms now. Enjoy 
that feeling. Let that feeling come up. There you go. That’s it. 
 
One more time. We’re going to bring your arms up one more time bringing 
them up and allowing yourself to feel that feeling, that feeling of joy and 
happiness that you’re going to carry with you all through the day. Any time 
you need to feel joy or happiness in your life, you’ll just allow your arm to 
drop. Let it drop now. Now. Now. That’s right. 
 
On the count of five, we’re going to come up out of trance bringing with us 
this feeling of joy and happiness. One – starting to feel more awake and 
alert. Two – starting to come up and out. Three – bringing that feeling, 
bringing a smile to your face. Four – being even more awake. Five – 
opening your eyes and feeling simply fantastic. All right, good job. You 
guys were fantastic. 
 
Demo 5 
 
Hypnotist: 
 Knowing you’ll be able to control your body, what I’m going to ask you to 
do is hold your hands straight out like this, sir. Hands straight out like this 
and clasp them together and hold them as tight as you possibly can. Tight, 
tight, tight, tight, tight, tight and hold them up like you’re having a prayer. 
Very good.  
 
Extend your forefingers up like this until they are far enough apart. Very, 
very good. Hold your fingers about an inch apart, tight. Hold them tight, 
tight, tight. Very good, very good. 
 
Now pretty soon you’re going to see like a magnetic field. These fingers 
start coming together and as your fingers touch, what I want you to do is 
to close your eyes and go deeper. That’s right, deeper, deeper, deeper. 
Very good.  
 
The deeper you go, the better you feel. That’s right, deep, deep, totally 
relaxed, totally relaxed. Very good. The more relaxed you are, the better 
you feel. The better you feel, the more relaxed you become.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, all of our subjects here qualify, so on the 
count of two they can open up their eyes and be ready to get hypnotized. 
One, two – open your eyes. Very, very good.  
 
Tell me, are you right-handed or left-handed? 
 
Subject: 
I’m left-handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
You’re left-handed. Okay, can I have that arm? 
 
Subject: 
Sure. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Okay, what I want you to do is I want you to take a look here at your hand 
and notice that you have lines in the hand, and I want you to look at a 
particular spot. I want you to focus into that spot very, very closely. Focus 
deeper and as your hand goes closer, your focus will change. 
 
When your focus changes, I want you to close your eyes and go deep, 
totally deep, totally deep, totally asleep; very good. Very good. Now find 
your balance and go deeper still, deeper, deeper. Sir, are you right-handed 
or left-handed?  
 
Subject: 
Left handed. 
 
Hypnotist: 
Left handed. Can I borrow your left hand for a second? That’s okay, I won’t 
take it away. What I’d like you to do is I’d like you look at your hand. I want 
you to notice the lines on your hand and I want you to focus on a 
particular spot in the hand.  
 
As you see that spot, your hand comes closer and you can notice that your 
focus changes. Ever so slightly you’ll notice your focus changes. As your 
focus changes, you close your eyes and go deep, deep, totally relaxed 
deeper still, deeper, totally and completely relaxed from the top of your 
head to the tips of your toes; completely relaxed.  
 
You’re totally controlling yourself and your surroundings as you go deeper, 
deeper, deeper relaxed. We’ll start with this one. Okay, terrific. Is it all 
right if I take this hand? Okay, here, what I want you to do is I want you to 
look at your hand. See the lines in your hand and pick a spot. Pick a spot, 
deeper, deeper focus. Focus very much on that hand.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
111 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
As your hand comes closer, you’ll see your focus starts to shift a little. As 
your focus shifts, it’s okay to close your eyes and sleep, totally relaxed 
completely relaxed. Just let it go, let it go. Now find your balance. There 
you go. Okay, deeper, deeper. Close your eyes. You’re in a safe place. 
You’re protected. Everything is okay. Deeper and totally relaxed. Very 
good.  
 
Now I want you to remember a special time, that very special time. You 
know, that evening with that special someone and you had that special 
memory. Remember how wonderful that was? Remember how good that 
felt? A time in your life when you were on top of it all. 
 
I want you to get the feeling of that just really deep down inside of you 
and as you do, I want your hand to rise. The feeling intensifies. Just as the 
feeling intensifies, I want your hand to rise as you start feeling better and 
better and better. The hand will rise as you feel better and better and 
better. 
 
This is your gift to you. This is how good you can feel. It’s important how 
good you can feel, and we know that you can feel good because we know 
that you’re good people. Now what I want you to do is connect your 
fingers together like this and every time you connect your fingers together 
like that, you can bring this feeling back into your body.  
 
Regardless of the circumstances around you, you can bring this feeling 
back into your body. How are you feeling now, sir? Feeling good? Feeling 
really good? Feeling good? Very good. Very good. 
 
As your hand goes down now, you can feel that assimilate into your body, 
into your body’s records so that your body will always know that that’s 
always available to you. On the count of five, I’m going to have you open 
your eyes and get present with everybody. 
 
One, two, three – coming up now. Four and five – welcome back. Come on 
back. Open your eyes. There you go, feeling good, feeling refreshed. 
Terrific. Now I’d like you to do this for me. How are you feeling? Feeling 
good, all right. Very good. Congratulations.

Bonus DVD #5 - Practical Demos 
Practical Demos, Mini Shows & How To Make 
Money Using Street Hypnosis 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Anthony: 
Morning, everybody. How are you doing? Very good. Last night was by far 
the best street action we’ve seen on a training course, and we’ve been 
doing them for quite a few years, taking people out.  
 
I mean within an hour, the vast majority of you came down there and 
pretty much nailed it. Some of you were doing that with crowds of 50, 60 
plus. I thought it was incredible. Any feedback? Any success stories?  
 
Student: 
You’ll have to excuse me because we stayed out a little bit late last night. 
We had some great atmosphere in the street was amazing really. It’s 
interesting how the crowds gathered round. 
 
Anthony: 
Hugely receptive to it as well. 
 
Student: 
I mean so much so that I don’t know who’s stayed on tonight, but we’re 
going to go down again tonight. We’re going to hit the streets. It was 
amazing. Really amazing. 
 
Anthony: 
Good, great stuff. Okay, well look, this morning we’re going to start to put 
this in some other contexts. I know this is essentially about street 
hypnosis, but it’s a bit of a misnomer really. It doesn’t have to take place 
outside on a street corner.  
 
I’ve said a few times that my route into hypnosis was indirect, Ericksonian 
hypnotherapy, which I love lots of metaphors, lots of kind of vague, 
ambiguous suggestions that just seem to be effective. I know that once my 
performance practices developed a direct approach, exactly the approach 
that we’ve been going over in the last two days, that my therapy work 
became more effective. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
113 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The marketing of that business became more effective because when 
people asked me can you hypnotize me, can you show me something 
really cool, then I could. Prior to that, I would skirt around those questions 
or opportunities and say it’s a bit noisy and so on and so forth. 
 
The first couple of things I’m going to show you today, you can put if you 
like in a sort of therapeutic frame. That doesn’t mean that it has to be a 
full on therapy session where somebody’s seeking hypnotherapy. 
 
How many people in here are hypnotherapists? So it’s going to be pretty 
relevant. For the rest of you who aren’t hypnotherapists, there are going 
to be moments where you want to illustrate something to someone and 
you don’t necessarily want to take it down the route of silliness and such. 
You want to do something good for them, but again if you’re not qualified 
in therapy you probably shouldn’t be getting too deeply involved in 
therapy, but you can make very simple changes and run very simple 
applications, which I’ll show you two or three. 
 
Bonus Demo – Self Hypnosis 
 
Anthony: 
You’ll see they’re very similar techniques. It’s just a case of taking them in 
a different direction. I asked if you’d like to volunteer. Are you up for doing 
this? Give her a round of applause. Take a seat there. I’ll come around this 
side. What’s your name? 
 
Laurie: 
Laurie. 
 
Anthony: 
Laurie. There you go, Laurie. I promise you no silliness, but let’s imagine 
we’ve met and I’ve happened to say I’m a hypnotist and you’ve shown 
some interest. Oh, I’ve always been interested in hypnotherapy, or can 
you show me something? We’ve kind of left that pretty open. 
 
Then this is the kind of thing that I’d do let’s start with something – we’ve 
been doing this quite a lot. This exercise I’m going to show you now is 
even tinier than that, but I use this a lot. I’ll explain where it comes from in 
a moment. 
 
Are you left-handed or right-handed?

Laurie: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
What I’d like you to do is just make a fist down there with your right hand. 
Just keep it on your lap like that and just look down at a knuckle or 
something. That’s right. Keep your eyes fixed on one spot and make that 
really, really tight, as tight as you can like you’re crushing something in 
your fist. 
 
Now when you’re ready, I want you to just close your eyes and with your 
eyes closed, you can continue to listen to me. You’re not asleep. We all 
know that we’ve got a pulse in our wrist and we’ve got a pulse in our 
thumb. That’s why you shouldn’t take someone’s pulse with your thumb. 
 
What I want you to do is keep this as a fist but let go of the tension. Feel 
the tension just draining away from it. Let go of all the muscle tension, so 
there’s a tiny bit of space in your fist there, big enough that you can hold 
something like a pebble or a tiny creature even that’s got a pulse, 
something that has a pulse of its own. 
 
When you can feel a pulse in the center of your palm, just nod your head 
so that I understand. Again, you really have to empty yourself. That’s right. 
Still yourself. When I click my fingers, you’re going to feel that pulse jump 
straight to your index figure. Concentrate on your index finger and when 
you can feel it there, again just nod your head so that I understand. That’s 
right. 
 
I’ll do it again. It will be a strange feeling but it’s going to jump to your 
little finger this time and when you can feel a pulse in your little finger, 
again just nod your head for me. That’s right. I know it’s a strange feeling. 
 
Now what I want you to do is very, very slowly just allow this hand to 
open, your fingers to uncurl, allow the hand to open and you’ll feel this 
kind of wooden, waxy feeling in the fingers and in the hand and it will be 
resting there nice and light. 
 
As I talk to the group, you can just continue to relax, allowing each breath 
you take to take you into a very comfortable state of mind, where you’re 
just happy to just relax there.

115 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
That’s the first exercise. I’ll give that exercise as a demonstration. I use 
that exercise with a crowd if I’m giving a lecture. What I’m going to do 
now, again you’ve kind of seen this but I’m just going to put it in a 
therapeutic context. 
 
In a moment what I’m going to do, Laurie, is I’m going to touch the back of 
that hand and it’s going to start to drift upwards towards your face. It’s 
just going to start to drift upwards all by itself, like it’s being pushed up on 
a cushion of air. I don’t know if it will be the thumb or the fingers that 
move first, but you’ll feel it start to become lighter and lighter. 
 
Those tiny movements – that’s right – barely touching now as it lifts up, 
the wrist lifting lighter and lighter, higher and higher. As it lifts, you’re 
going to enjoy this unusual sense of wellbeing, an unusual sense of 
wellbeing, a growing sense of wellbeing. 
 
Now I came across an idea, Laurie. There is something that you’d love to 
feel differently about. If you could smile or laugh about it, you’d be so 
much better off. That’s right. As that lifts towards your face, it’s going to 
start to seem funny to you. 
 
You’re going to drift out of your body and you’re going to see this thing 
from five miles up and then 50 miles up, and you’re going to see it getting 
smaller and smaller. You’re going to begin to put it in its true perspective, 
not just of your life – that’s right, it’s going to get funnier and funnier and 
funnier – but of your region, of your country and this planet. 
 
The closer that gets, the less serious you can become. It’s going to get 
closer and closer and closer, and you’re going to realize now you can 
change the way you think. You can change the way you feel and respond 
and when your hand touches your head, you’re just going to laugh. 
 
You’re going to look at this thing and you’re going to laugh. It will never 
bother you again. You can let go of every negative thought, every limiting 
belief that you or anyone else that your circumstance placed on you. You 
can just laugh at this thing – that’s right – and let go of every negative 
thought, every limiting belief that you or anyone else has placed on you. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
116 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
It’s going to get funnier and funnier, and later on should you ever think 
about this, if I even ask you to think about it you’re just going to smile. You 
will no longer be able to fine – that’s right. This is ridiculous. 
 
I’m going to push your hand down and as I push it down, you can keep all 
the good feelings – that’s right – and you can let all those memories you 
no longer need just disappear back where they belong. 
 
Now for today, whenever you wish to relax in this way and take yourself 
into this controlled state of hypnosis, all you need do is repeat the word 
relax four times in your mind. The fourth time you repeat the word relax, 
you will return to this state of hypnosis more comfortably, more 
effortlessly and deeper each time. It will be easy. It will be effortless. 
 
You’ll be able to do this any time it’s safe and appropriate for you to do so. 
Now you could just do this for the purpose of relaxing, taking a catnap, 
chilling out for a while but when you’re in this state of mind, you can tap 
into your resources however you name that. Whether it’s your 
unconscious, the back of your mind or just that creative part of you, you’ll 
be able to tap straight into those resources. 
 
If there’s something that you wish to do; it could be a short-term or long-
term goal. It could be a physical or financial goal, it could be you just want 
to feel better, you want to get a good night’s sleep – all you need do is sit 
quietly, repeat the word relax four times in your mind, and the fourth time 
you’ll find yourself back inside, back in this state. That’s right. 
 
You’ll be completely in control and then you can use that voice in your 
head – your own inner voice – to direct those resources. You’re going to 
do that and you’ll remember how to do this using positive terms – in other 
words, telling your mind what you want and when and how you will feel 
and when, rather than how you don’t want to feel or what you don’t want. 
 
This will be easy. You will remember to use positive terms to tell it what 
you want and when, how you will feel and when. You can even put a time 
on how long you’re going to do this for, and you will begin to move in that 
direction.

The opportunities that naturally come along to move towards your goals, 
you’ll make note of and you will make use of. Again, in a way that works 
for you and those around you. 
 
Now should you ever do this and for some reason you suddenly need to be 
wide awake and alert, then of course you would be and you’d be perfectly 
able to respond to any situation presenting itself. You could give yourself a 
certain amount of time as you take yourself into hypnosis and tell yourself 
that you’re going to do this in five minutes or 20 minutes, or you could 
bring yourself back up to full and wakeful alertness by just counting in 
your mind from one to five. 
 
In a moment I’m going to count from one to five and on the count of five, 
you will be back wide awake and alert, feeling great, feeling refreshed, 
feeling revitalized. Again, throughout the rest of the seminar when I’m 
working with other people up here on stage, you’ll find that you can stay 
out of hypnosis quite easily. You can remain alert even though you can 
hear my voice and hear those key words.  
 
One – feel a surge of energy pouring in through your fingers and toes. Two 
– take a deep breath. That’s right energy going through your system. Three 
– take another as that energy rushes through our fingers, toes, arms, legs 
and right to the top of your head. That’s right. Four – take a deep breath 
one more time. Nose clear, eyes clear, throat clear, chest clear, stomach 
clearing and five – eyes open, wide awake. 
 
Give her a round of applause. Just stay there a moment. So the very first 
thing we did there is a technique by a performer actually, but he’s also got 
30 years of experience and is an Ericksonian hypnotherapist. His name is 
Bill Cushman and this little technique is actually in a product for magicians. 
It’s not really going to be of much interest but I’ve got his permission to 
show it to you. It’s called The Jumping Pulse. 
 
I use this everywhere. I love it and especially in kind of one-to-one 
situations or small groups, at a dinner party where they’re not expecting 
fireworks, then I’ll use this demonstration and it’s hugely reliable.  
 
Just to go through the steps for you, the first thing I’ll do is get focus of 
attention and ind of get into a hypnotic mode even though I’m saying this 
is not hypnosis. It’s in a document called Suggestibilities. As I say, the rest 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
118 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
of it is about magic and sneaking. I demonstrate it on a DVD. Correct, I do. 
I just fell apart doing the explanation. 
 
This is what I’m going to do. Are you left-handed or right-handed? Again, 
this is just a pointless question but it kind of gives me an air of expertise. In 
performance terms we call it the witchdoctor effect, which is if you as the 
expert put emphasis on something, even if you don’t explain why you’re 
doing that, then the person you’re working with will assign some value 
and some meaning and some purpose to that. 
 
Are you left-handed or right-handed? 
 
Laurie: 
Right handed. 
 
Anthony: 
Right handed. What I’d like you to do is this. I’d like you to just look at the 
back of your hand. Again, I’m already starting to narrow her attention and 
I’m giving instructions. This is very much a doing at this point, rather than 
a happening. 
 
I want you to make a tight fist. Again, I’ll always remind people to be 
careful if they’ve got long nails and that kind of thing. Make a really tight 
fist really tight. Again, by having her fist tight, it’s much easier then to feel 
this pulse and feel the change when the relaxation occurs. 
 
I’ll say pick a point and what I’d like you to do is just close your eyes and 
let go of any tension in the fist. Keep it as a fist but let go of any muscle 
tension. If you’ll do that, you have to wait for like five or 10 seconds. If 
you’ll make a tight fist, really tight and then very, very slowly relax it so 
that it looks the same but there’s no tension there, you’ll feel all that 
tension draining away, the same as when you open the hand slowly at the 
end of this exercise. 
 
I know what’s going on there. I know she’s got some weird novel feelings 
going on in her hand, and I can describe them ambiguously as wooden, 
waxy feelings, sensations of heaviness but kind of feels light and that kind 
of stuff. 
 
I then remind whoever I’m working with that they have a pulse in their 
wrist and a pulse in their thumb, and everyone nods because we all got 
that information from somewhere that you shouldn’t take a pulse with 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
119 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
your thumb, but it kind of confirms that we haven’t got a pulse anywhere 
else in our hand, which is nonsense. We have pulses everywhere, all over 
our body, everywhere that blood flows. 
 
So, all that’s really happening in this exercise is that a person’s attention is 
being pointed from one finger to another. For some people when you’re 
doing this to them, they’ll be really surprised. They will feel it jump and the 
more interested in it they get, then the way I’m gauging it is the quicker 
those responses are when I say it’s going to jump to this finger or that 
finger, the more I feel like she’s now acting on my suggestion rather than 
just being a trick of me directing her attention. Is that clear? 
 
I know this is going to happen anyway if she puts her attention in the right 
place, but I want to make it happen. It’s a bit like I know this is going to 
happen and this is going to happen, but I want to make it happen. 
 
I normally get it to jump a few times. Again, just tune into that pulse in 
your index finger, Laurie. Do you feel it there? Now I’m going to ask you to 
do something now. Consciously I’d like you to just make a guess of where 
that pulse might jump to next, which finger it might jump to next when I 
click my fingers. Just make a guess. You don’t have to say it out loud. Have 
you made one? Okay, that’s fine. 
 
 
Now just again feel this pulse right here in your index finger because your 
unconscious mind is going to make this choice. The inner part of your mind 
will decide. It always has. When I click my fingers, you’re going to feel that 
pulse in another finger. (Click) Do you feel it? Did you guess correctly? 
Excellent. Your conscious and your unconscious minds are perfectly 
synchronized.  
 
You can open your eyes and be wide awake and alert. I didn’t do this in the 
initial demonstration but I’ll often ask the person to guess three times out 
before they’re wrong. Again, it doesn’t matter if they’re correct because 
obviously their conscious and their unconscious are perfectly aligned, if 
that’s the language you want to use. If she gets it incorrect, then it’s a 
demonstration of the power of their mind and decisions we make and 
where they come from and that kind of stuff.

This little exercise can be used to teach people self-hypnosis. If you’re into 
kind of mindfulness and meditation and that kind of stuff, this exercise is 
perfect for that kind of thing. I know it’s kind of a tiny discreet little thing 
to do but it has a big effect on people. 
 
Sorry, this is what I was going to come onto. The next exercise I did there 
is something that pretty much in any session I will do this. Because I’ve 
seen thousands and thousands of people in therapy and the type of 
therapy I do is often geared towards seeing that person once or twice, 
then when a capable as a subject, it’s kind of a massive opportunity missed 
in my opinion not to give them the ability to [audio gap]. 
 
Now when people try to learn self-hypnosis from a book or even from a 
class, it’s a bit like learning to meditate in that you sort of sit there and 
relax your shoulders and you relax your arms and you sort of open your 
eyes and think am I hypnotized yet? Am I meditating yet? Because it’s not 
just this big empty void and you have to work at it to kind of get there. 
 
My preferred way of teaching people self-hypnosis is the easy way, which 
is to hypnotize them and give them the suggestion that they’ll be able to 
do, give them the key. Again, just to keep it simple for myself because I’ve 
given this suggestion to so many people, I always say the same thing. My 
trigger is always the same.  
 
I could use something from Laurie’s life, something she already does. I 
don’t know, some activity or something that she comes up with but 
generally I just put it the way I did there. The suggestion just goes like this 
– and I’ll be prepared to give this suggestion at any point in a session I’m 
doing. In a kind of impromptu demo where I’ve demonstrated something 
like this, I’ll just give them the self-hypnosis suggestion straightaway.  
 
Again, even in impromptu situations, I’ll teach people self-hypnosis and 
that is the demonstration. I did this to someone last night. She did this on 
some problem and notice it’s content-free. I don’t know what the thing is 
that the person is laughing at or letting go of. It’s kept very general. 
 
I’ll just give the self-hypnosis suggestion and show them how to use it and 
people are very grateful for that. It’s like a little gift, especially at the end 
of a hypnotherapy session.

The suggestion is this. From today whenever you wish to relax in this way 
or take yourself into hypnosis, all you need do is sit quietly and repeat the 
word relax four times in your mind. The fourth time you repeat that word, 
you will immediately go back into hypnosis. 
 
That’s the core bit. Do some health and safety. Just say any time it’s safe 
and appropriate to do so. You’ll know if you read in the literature of 
hypnosis, quite often people will give the impression that you couldn’t do 
anything harmful to yourself or that would be against your best interest or 
your morals or your ethics and that kind of stuff. 
 
I taught someone this exercise years ago on a training course. She went 
back to her hotel and it was good, capable subject like Laurie and took 
herself into hypnosis and then counted herself out and was like oh, it 
worked. Then she did it again and it worked.  
 
Then she picked up a hot cup of coffee, said the word relax four times and 
it didn’t work because she’d been given the suggestion any time it’s safe 
and appropriate to do so in my opinion, rather than because when we’re 
hypnotized this veil of protection descends upon us and protects us from 
everything. I don’t see why it should. It’s not like that when we’re not 
hypnotized. We’re quite capable of getting in predicaments. 
 
I don’t believe that, so I will say any time it’s safe and appropriate to do so. 
I don’t want the curious person driving home and thinking what was that 
thing he said? I really wouldn’t expect them just to be knocked out or 
anything like that, but I’m going to say it – any time it’s safe and 
appropriate for you to do so. 
 
I then encourage the person to deliver suggestions to themselves and if 
you remember what I said there was using positive terms. That’s not 
positive thinking. It’s saying I want to wake up at 7:00 o’clock, or when my 
head touches the pillow I’ll drift into a comfortable sleep; as opposed to 
don’t keep me awake. It’s that simple really. 
 
State what you want in a positive and put a time on it. Just saying I want to 
be happier is probably not defined enough. So I encourage people to say 
when I stand up and speak tomorrow, I will speak confident and calmly 
and fluently. You put a time on it and you state it in the positive.

Then again, just kind of health and safety but just to give some choice to 
Laurie, is that she can wake herself up by counting one to five. As she sets 
this up, she can give herself a time to emerge and it’s a bit more like a sort 
of timed meditation if you like or should there be some situation that 
demands she gets back in the room? Then she will and she’ll be 
completely normal and capable of responding to any situation. 
 
That all might seem a little over the top with the health and safety, but 
that’s how I want it covered off. Do you have any questions about teaching 
people that exercise? No? 
 
Give it to people as a gift. It’s really that simple. Once I’ve done it, 
immediately afterwards I will then get the client to prove it to themselves. 
That’s what you’re going to do.  
 
Just pick a spot. It could be anywhere. It could be the back of your hand. It 
could be some area in the room. You don’t have to say anything. You don’t 
have to do anything. Just keep your eyes fixed on that spot.  
 
When you’re ready, I want you to repeat the word relax four times just in 
your mind. That’s right. The fourth time, you can allow your eyes to close. 
Now again, you might be sitting there as you drift into hypnosis wondering 
am I really hypnotized, just by repeating a word to myself four times? 
 
Well, to demonstrate that you are, again I don’t want you to pretend or 
act. I want you to actively use that voice in your mind and tell your mind, 
like it’s there on your shoulder listening to you, to push your hands up off 
your legs. Tell it to do that. Repeat that instruction in your mind, and again 
you feel them start to go. 
 
Now the strange thing is as it lifts, even as you become aware of it lifting, 
fingers twitching, you can test it. You can try and keep it still and find it 
goes even higher. That’s right. You can try and hold it steady, try and keep 
it where it is and find it just continues to lift. You can try and push it down 
and find it just wants to drift up. 
 
Again, I know it’s a strange feeling, but one that you’re going to enjoy. 
There is a fundamental learning for you in that arm right now. From today 
it will be easy for you to take yourself back into hypnosis. All you need do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
123 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
is repeat the word, relax four times and then you go any time it’s safe and 
appropriate for you to do so. 
 
Just like you’ve told your mind to lift that arm, you can just as easily tell it 
something much more useful. Now when you’re ready I want you to bring 
yourself back up to fully awake, full alertness, feeling great, feeling 
refreshed and you know how to do that. You just count in your mind and 
when you do, that arm will drift down and you’ll drift back up to a big 
round of applause, feeling great. 
 
Bonus Demo – Mini Hypnosis Show 
 
Anthony:  
Let’s start with the exercise. I’ve already shown you this but I’m going to 
show you how to take it a little bit further. It could be two people, five 
people, 20 people, 500 people. It doesn’t matter as long as you can hear 
me, we can do this. 
 
I’m going to start by showing you a little bit about hypnosis and how it 
works, and the bit in the mind that we’re actually interested in – your 
ability to concentration, use your imagination but most importantly tap 
into your creative mind. The bit of you that has ideas and dreams that 
makes plans and finds solutions, the bit that just does stuff.  
 
I promise you that if you do what I’m asking you to do, if you follow these 
instructions, you will have an experience that you’ll remember, an 
experience that will stay with you for years and years and years in a good 
way. 
 
If you’re ready to do this, I’d like you all to just place your feet flat on the 
floor. Just place your hands nice and lightly on your lap. If you’re chewing 
gum, take it out or at least be careful with it. With your feet on the floor, 
what I’d like you to do is this. Place your hands out in front of you about 
six inches apart. That’s right. 
 
Now clasp them together. If you’ve got long nails or rings, mind your rings 
and mind your fingernails. Clasp them really tight. That’s right. Bend your 
elbows like you’re making a prayer keeping those palms together, your 
thumbs locked on top. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
124 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Put your first fingers up about an inch apart. You’re going to enjoy this. 
Look at the gap between your fingers. Don’t look at me. Don’t look 
anywhere else now because in a moment your fingers will touch like 
they’re two powerful magnets being pulled together. They will get closer 
and closer and closer together like magnets. 
 
When they touch, just allow your eyes to close. That’s right. Eyes closed, 
eyes closing. If you’re not there already, just keep concentrating on that 
idea. If you are there already, just being breathing in nice and slowly, 
breathing out even more slowly.  
 
Pretend and imagine you’re breathing in calm and you’re breathing out 
any doubts, letting go now just for a time. With those hands still locking 
together, fingers squeezing together, I want you to enjoy this. That’s right. 
I want you to think about the person who is dearest to you on this planet. 
Make a decision if there’s more than one. 
 
When you’ve got an image in mind, just nod your head for me so that I 
understand. Nod your head clearly so that I understand, and enjoy it. See 
their face. See them smiling. Hear their voice. Hear their laughter. Feel 
what you feel for that person and as you feel that feeling and as you listen 
to me, your fingers are becoming stuck and bolted together. 
 
You can imagine they are fused together. You can imagine there’s nothing 
that you can do about that because they’re locked tight together. When 
you realize they’re stuck, I’d like you to raise your hands up a little higher 
so that I understand. Again, this might seem funny to a few of you, but just 
raise your hands up a little higher so that I understand. Higher and higher 
and higher that’s right. 
 
Raise them up so that I understand. As you raise it imagining those hands 
now, your fingers locked to the back of the hands, your palms stuck 
together as if they’re Super Glued together.  
 
When you realize they’re absolutely stuck, you can test them. Try and pull 
them apart and find they’re stuck and glued together. If you’re trying, 
again raise your hands higher so that I can see them.  
 
I’m going to come out into the audience and I’m going to grab a few of 
you. Again, as you try to pull them apart, some of you will find your hands 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
125 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
beginning to shake or tremor slightly. If you find they have come apart, 
that’s fine. You can just relax but for the rest of you, you’re going to find – 
that’s right – your hands are absolutely stuck and bolted. 
 
If I touch you on the shoulder, again in a moment when I ask you to come 
up on stage, you’ll come right up on stage. Again, make sure you’re testing 
those hands. Really try and pull them apart. Put some real effort into that. 
Really try and pull them apart. That’s right. Put some effort into that. 
That’s right, Jonas.  
 
Put some effort in and you’ll find your hands beginning to shake. I know 
it’s a strange feeling. That’s right, Alex. Put some effort in. If you try and 
pull them apart now, show me by raising your hands even higher. That’s 
right. You’re doing brilliantly. That’s right. 
 
Now when I clap my hands, you’ll find your hands un-stick but those good 
feelings remain. (Clap) If you were touched on the shoulder, then just 
come up here and I’ll just show you something. Just give them a round of 
applause if you were touched on the shoulder, I think there are four or five 
of you. Just stand in a row here. We’re not going to sit down. Just come 
out and just stand in a row for me. We did this little exercise. Everybody 
did it. You followed it particular well. Oh, Marcus, nice to see you. 
 
We’re going to do another very simple exercise, a similar sort of thing. This 
time I’m going to count to three. You’re going to have your eyes closed, so 
just listen to these instructions.  
 
On the count of one, I want you to make a fist with your left hand. On the 
count of two, I want you to raise that out in front of you. Raise it up 
towards the ceiling. On three, squeeze it really tight and I’m going to ask 
you to use your imagination.  
 
Just place your feet together if you would. That’s right. Stick them 
together nice and tight. You will not fall over. You will not fall off the stage. 
You will not move unless I ask you to move. 
 
Take a deep breath in and just close your eyes. You can just imagine that 
you can sleep and stand, but you’re not asleep. You understand the 
difference between the sleep you have at night and the relaxed focused 
state you’re in now.

On the count of three – on one, make a tight fist. On two, raise it up in 
front of you. On three, squeeze that tight.  
 
One – make a fist. Two – raise it up towards the ceiling, right up towards 
the ceiling higher and higher and higher. Three – make it nice and tight, 
imagining that fist is made of rock, that arm is made of granite, completely 
stiff and rigid, stuck fast completely, stiff and rigid, absolutely stuck fast, 
tighter and tighter and tighter. 
 
As you concentrate on that idea, imagining it’s like a steel bar, feeling that 
rigidness from the fist right up to your shoulder, tighter and tighter and 
tighter, you’ll find you can try and bend it and you cannot bend it. 
 
The crazy thing is you can’t bend it, and this is going to seem funny to you 
for some unknown reason. There is a fundamental learning in that arm 
right there. You’ve tapped into a power here. It’s called your unconscious 
mind. It’s working for you right now. It’s going to get funnier and funnier 
and funnier with every passing second. This is ridiculous. You don’t even 
care anymore. 
 
Now in a moment I’ll click my fingers and when I do, your eyes will open, 
you’ll look up at that arm and it will be even more unbendable, even more 
stiff and rigid. Look up at your arm. Is that your arm? What are you doing 
there? What are you doing there? 
 
Now I’m going to come along to each of you individually and I’m going to 
hypnotize you. I’m going to hypnotize you, each of you individually. When 
I’m working with one of you individually – that’s right – the rest of you will 
just relax in your own little way. Just close your eyes. That’s right.  
 
Let your arm un-stiffen now and just come all the way down. You can 
wake up, open your eyes and you can let that un-stiffen. That’s right. You 
can open your eyes. You can let your arm relax. You can see the tension 
disappearing but the fun remains. I’ll leave you for there now, Marcus. 
You’re doing just fine. 
 
Just take a small step back if you would, gents. That’s right. Are you left-
handed or right-handed? You’re right-handed. Can I borrow your hand for 
a second? That’s right. Just look up here. Look at the lines on your hand.

127 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Look at one spot. As it moves towards your face, your eyes will begin to 
change focus. You become of aware of them, close them and sleep and 
relax. Let go, deeper, deeper down.  
 
Your head is like a bowling ball, your neck relaxing, your shoulders 
relaxing. You will not fall over. Your legs will support you. You’re perfectly 
safe, well protected. You have a super powerful mind. That’s right. You’re 
doing brilliantly. 
 
Just look right here underneath my eyes. Right at this spot. What’s your 
name? 
 
Johnny: 
Johnny. 
 
Anthony: 
Johnny, keep looking here. My name’s Anthony. I’m going to shake your 
hand three times. The first time I shake your hand, your eyes are going to 
begin to change focus. The second time I shake your hand, they’ll get even 
heavier. Just try and keep them on that spot. The third time I shake your 
hand, your eyes close and you go into hypnosis.  
 
Nod your head if you understand. That’s right. I’ll shake it once and your 
eyes are going to start to feel tired. Just keep them fixed on that spot. The 
second time, they get even heavier and heavier. Again, you’re doing 
brilliantly. Just try and keep them fixed on that spot. That’s right. 
 
The third time, your eyes close and just sleep and relax deeper, deeper 
down now. You will not fall over. Your legs will support you, sinking and 
floating and drifting down. Just look up here if you would. Keep your eyes 
right on this finger right here. Keep your eyes on it. Take a deep breath. 
Close your eyes. Sleep now, deeper relaxed. Let go, sink and float and drift 
all the way down now, all the way down. 
 
The person I’m touching now, you try and open your eyes and you find you 
can’t open your eyes. They’re completely stuck, completely stuck even 
though you don’t believe you’re hypnotized at all. You do not believe 
you’re hypnotized at all.  
 
Marcus, keep trying to undo that arm. How are you doing there? That’s 
right. Just relax your arm. Just press down on my hand if you would. That’s 
right. Take a deep breath and just breathe out. Now sleep, deeper, deeper 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
128 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
down now, sinking and floating and drifting down, letting go, letting go, 
Marcus. 
 
Everything I say to you becoming your reality, understanding what you 
imagine will become real. What you imagine will become real with a sense 
of automatic-ness, instantly and immediately, deeper and deeper. Relax. 
You will not fall over, Marcus. You will stay there perfectly poised, 
perfectly relaxed.  
 
Again, everything I say to you all, gentlemen, as a group now becoming 
your reality, however stupid or silly it seems just for a time. You’ll see what 
I say you can see. You’ll know what I say you know. You’ll hear what I say 
you can hear. Nod your head if you understand. 
 
If I say the word sleep or deeper sleep, you’ll immediately return to this 
state. That’s right. You can stop trying to open your eyes. If I say the words 
one, two, wide awake, your eyes will open and you’ll act perfectly on the 
suggestion you’ve been given. Again nod your head if you understand. 
 
If for some reason we just have to leave here in a hurry or in an 
emergency, then everything will be back to normal. Now just go deeper 
and deeper inside your own mind right now, letting go of your inhibitions. 
Imagine them just falling away from you, letting go of your inhibitions, 
letting go of your doubts. You’re doing brilliantly. 
 
In a moment what I’m going to do is clap my hands. When I clap my hands, 
your left hand is going to start to be pulled upwards towards your face, 
like your head’s a magnet and your hands are magnets. They’re going to 
be pulled together. (Clap)  
 
It’s just going to start to lift. It’s going to start to feel light. It will move on 
its own accord. You’ll feel it in your forearm and your wrist. That’s right 
lighter and lighter and lighter. The closer it gets to your head, the better 
you’re going to feel. You’re going to enjoy this wonderful sense of 
wellbeing, an unusual sense of well being is going to fill out every cell of 
your body, even the space between them. 
 
As it gets towards your head, you know what’s going to happen. This is 
going to start to seem funny to you, lighter and lighter for some unknown 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
129 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
reason, funnier and funnier with each millimeter it moves, 10 times 
funnier, 100 times funnier. 
 
When it touches your head, you’re going to laugh out loud as 
inappropriately as you possibly can. Laughing out loud as inappropriately 
as you possibly can that’s right. Higher and higher, higher and higher. 
Louder and louder, Alex.  
 
Alex, this is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. This is [audio gap]. It’s silly. It gets 
funnier and funnier and funnier, and the sound of other people’s laughter 
just fuels it more and more and more there’s nothing you can do about it.  
 
You try and pull it off your head and you realize you can’t. That’s just going 
to crack you up. You’re going to laugh like a little girl. You don’t even know 
why. You’re just going to titter away like a little girl, and even that is going 
to seem funny to you. 
 
When I clap my hands again, you’re going to laugh like an evil demon. 
Right now you’re going to start laughing like an evil demon. This is absurd. 
This is ridiculous to you. That’s right. 
 
Now again remain standing, stop laughing. Sleep right now, deeper, 
deeper, deeper, deeper down, sinking down. This arm can un-stick all the 
way down. Un-sticking all the way down. Un-sticking all the way down, all 
the way down. Deeper and deeper and deeper asleep, letting go, sinking 
and floating and drifting down. 
 
Now in a moment when I clap my hands, you’re going to feel this same 
stiffness you had in your arm, you’re going to feel it starting to spread 
through your toes and your feet and your calves and your knees, all the 
way up. You won’t get cramped but you’re going to feel yourself becoming 
a statue and you’re going to straighten up as that happens.  
 
You’re going to start to stand up right now. You’re going to feel this 
stiffening like concrete. You’re becoming more and more solid as if you’re 
made of marble as you straighten up, and once you get all the way up 
you’ll have this realization that all you can move is your head.  
 
All you can move is your head. Nothing else will move. If you try and take a 
step, you try and move a finger, you’ll find they just get stiffer and stiffer, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
130 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
more and more statue like. Again, you’ll still be able to breathe. You’ll be 
just fine but you’ll feel those muscles stiffening up and tightening up, and 
all you can move now is your head. 
 
All you can move is your head. If you try and lift a foot, you’ll find it’s 
impossible to do so. Put some effort in. Put some effort in. Try and lift it 
up. That’s a strange feeling, isn’t it? 
 
When I touch you on the shoulder, you’ll open your eyes and you’ll try 
even harder. Is that your foot? Is that your foot down there?  
 
 
Alex:  
No. 
 
Anthony: 
No? Whose foot is it? 
 
Alex:  
No clue. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s my foot, isn’t it? It belongs to me now. 
 
Alex:  
Absolutely. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s right. What about this money? Is that my money or is that your 
money? 
 
Alex:  
I want it to be mine. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah? Do you feel like you could try and touch that with one of your arms? 
Come on, put some effort in. It’s $30. Put some effort in and if you can 
touch it, you can have it. Really get mad about this. You’re going to get 
angry. You will not be able to move because anger just makes this stiffer 
and more rigid 
 
I’ll tell you what, there’s about – I don’t know - $400 there. If you can 
touch that, I’ve got about 80 witnesses because they think you’re 
pretending. They think you’re acting. Do you think you can get to that with 
one of your hands? I’ll count to five. 
 
One – that’s right, get mad. Two – this is really starting to piss you off. 
Three – try even harder. Put some effort it. You’re a strong guy. What’s 
the matter with you? Five – sleep. Let go of the tension. Let go of the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
131 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
anger. You feel fantastic. You feel amazing. Releasing tension always does 
feel good. You feel fantastic. You will not fall over. Deeper, deeper, relax 
now, sinking, floating, drifting down to sleep. Deeper sleep, deeper sleep. 
That’s right. 
 
The person I’m touching on the shoulder, in a moment we’re going to do a 
card trick and I’m going to ask you to think of a card. You’re going to try 
and fool me. You’re going to change your mind at least three or four times, 
and then you’re going to settle on one card. That card will be the three of 
hearts. 
 
There’s absolutely no other card that you will settle on. You’ll change your 
mind a few times and you’ll really think you’ve fooled me. Should that card 
– the three of hearts – be revealed to you, you’ll be amazed. You’ll be 
astonished. You’ll have absolutely no idea why that happened because you 
can completely forget that this has been said to you. 
 
Your head will not when that’s been understood. That’s right. Deeper 
relaxed now. Deep and relaxed, letting go of the tension, Alex, letting go of 
the stiffness now that’s right. You can just stay there, Marcus, turning into 
a statue, turning to marble. We’ll come to you in a while. 
 
Deeper relaxed, letting go now. Letting go that’s right. That’s right. You’re 
doing brilliantly. One, two – wide awake. How are your eyes? You have 
amazing eyes. 
 
Student: 
Thank you. 
 
Anthony: 
I’m sure you’ve heard that before. I’ll tell you what, let’s try something. 
I’m doing a magic trick. I haven’t got a pack of cards on me, but if I was to 
show you this entire pack of cards and just say look through it and you got 
all the different suits – spades, clubs and whatever – just look through it 
and just mentally select one of the cards. 
 
In fact physically just take a virtual card out of there. I’m going to throw 
the rest away. You changed your mind a few times though, didn’t you? 
You did, didn’t you? What’s the card you’re thinking of? 
 
Student: 
It’s a magic trick.

Anthony: 
You tell me. Out loud, what is it? I’ll tell you what, turn around. There’s a 
card on the table. There’s only one card on the table. It’s right behind you. 
Pick it up. Have a look. That’s right, Alex. Sleep, relax deeper down now, 
sinking, floating and drifting down. This is going to astonish you over 
there. You’re going to be baffled by that for hours and hours. Deeper 
relaxed. 
 
Again, Alex, everything I say to you becoming your reality. Let go of those 
usual binds. Understand you have a super powerful mind that can be 
empowering to imagine things, and as you imagine those things to 
experience those imaginings, they’re just happening.  
 
This is like the difference between sculling away, floating on a pool, 
making an effort and just drifting there and being part of the water just for 
a time. Everything I say to you becoming your reality.  
 
In a moment when I say the words eyes open wide awake, you will no 
longer be able to remember your name. Just for a time it will be gone. It 
will be rubbed out of your mind completely, vanished as if it’s been rubbed 
off a blackboard or a whiteboard and just turned to dust. Just for a time 
it’s floating out there in the ether.  
 
You’ll believe you know your name but when you try and say it, when you 
try and speak it, it will not get any further than the tip of your tongue. This 
is going to be really frustrating. This is going to be really, really annoying 
because it’s ridiculous because you’re standing in front of an audience. 
That’s right. 
 
One, two wide awake. How are you doing? I’m terrible with names. What 
is your name? 
 
Alex:  
Just something. 
 
Anthony: 
Jeff something? 
 
Alex:  
Jest something. 
 
Anthony: 
Jest? 
 
Alex:  
Jest.

Anthony: 
Really? 
 
Anthony: 
Okay Jest and just sleep for me. Sleep, sleep. Your name is Jennie 
Camelhumper, III. That’s right. Your name is Jennie Camelhumper, III. You 
want to be called Jennie from now on. You want to be called Jennie from 
now on. You’re serious about this, deadly serious about this. Your name is 
Jennie Camelhumper, III. You’re from a long line of Camelhumpers going 
way back. Nod your head when that’s on board. That’s right. 
 
One, two – wide awake. One, two – wide awake. It’s hot in here, isn’t it? 
What’s your name? 
 
Alex:  
Jennie Camelhumper, III. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, are you from a long line of Camelhumpers? 
 
Alex:  
We are, yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, that’s a lovely name. That’s a lovely name. When anyone laughs at 
your name, do you get annoyed? 
 
Alex:  
I used to. Not anymore. I love my name. 
 
Anthony: 
You love your name. You’re proud of your family name. Excellent. Sleep, 
relax deeper, deeper down. You will not fall over. You will stand up 
straight going even deeper into hypnosis. That’s right, even deeper into 
hypnosis.  
 
Again, the person I’m touching now, as I touch you on the shoulder, you’re 
going to feel your head starting to move from side to side. You aren’t 
going to know why but it’s just like you’ve got something stuck on your 
head and you need to get rid of it. That’s right. 
 
The more you flick your head around, the closer you’re going to get to 
getting rid of that thing. Left to right, you keep flicking. Really put some 
effort in. You need to get this thing off your head. It’s starting to irritate 
you. It’s irritating your nose. It’s irritating your ears. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
134 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
In a moment I’ll tap you on the shoulder. When I tap you on the shoulder, 
your eyes will open and the irritation will be twice as bad. The irritation 
will be twice as bad but you will only be able to speak the truth. 
 
You’ve got this strange little tick and you can only speak the truth, the full 
truth and nothing but the truth just for a time. That’s right. In fact just 
forget everything I said there. Your head will keep moving. Your head will 
keep moving. That’s right. 
 
The next time I say one, two wide awake, your eyes will open and that 
irritation, that stuff on your head – well, you’re going to have to try and 
get rid of it by flicking your head around even more, but you have this 
strange tick. You are a liar. You’re a huge liar. You’re the biggest bull 
shitter in the world. Everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie, and 
each lie is bigger and more outlandish than the last, but you’re convinced 
of your own untruths.  
 
Your head can twitch when that’s understood. Excellent. One, two – wide 
awake. How are you doing? Did you enjoy the weekend? 
 
Marcus: 
I’ve had better. 
 
Anthony: 
You’ve had better? Oh, man. What size feet have you got? 
 
Marcus: 
Fourteen. 
 
Anthony: 
Fourteen, and how many children do you have? 
 
Marcus: 
Eleven. 
 
Anthony: 
Eleven children. How old are you? 
 
Marcus: 
Thirty-eight. 
 
Anthony: 
Thirty-eight. What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever stolen? 
 
Marcus: 
It was an ’89 Mercedes. 
 
Anthony: 
An ’89 Mercedes. Excellent. Sleep and relax deeper, deeper down now. 
You are a truth teller. You’re a truth teller. You can only speak the truth, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
135 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. That’s all that comes out of 
your mouth. You even try and lie, and the truth will just emerge. Nod your 
head when that’s on board. That’s right. 
 
One, two – wide awake. Excellent. Did you have a good weekend? 
 
Marcus: 
Yeah, I’ve had a great weekend. 
 
Anthony: 
Excellent. What size feet do you have? 
 
Marcus: 
Twelve. 
 
Anthony: 
And how old are you? 
 
Marcus: 
Thirty-nine. 
 
Anthony: 
How many children have you got? 
 
Marcus: 
Zero. 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, really? Tell me, what’s your biggest regret? Sleep! I don’t need to 
know that. Let go, sinking and floating and drifting down. Deeper and 
deeper down, letting go now, just for a time. You have a super, super 
powerful mind. It is working for you. You can let go of all those concerns. 
That’s right, Marcus, just going deeper and deeper and deeper.  
 
Again, just like those first times you were hypnotized and everything just 
became your reality so easily, so instantly. That’s right. Deeper relaxed 
again. You will not fall over. What did you make of the magic? 
 
Student: 
Is there a midget under the table? 
 
Anthony: 
A midget under the table? I haven’t seen one but I haven’t looked under 
the table. This card here, it’s a real interesting card. Just take hold of it like 
this, okay? Just take hold of the card. Put your arm out just like this and 
just bend your wrist up like that. 
 
I want you to just look right at the three of hearts there. Just keep your 
eyes fixed on it. As you keep your eyes fixed, locked onto the three of 
hearts, you can note with interest that card is becoming stuck and glued to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
136 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
your fingers, completely stuck to your fingers. When you try and drop it, it 
will be impossible for you to drop it.  
 
You can be some effort it but it will become more and more stuck, and it’s 
going to get hot. It’s going to get hotter and hotter and hotter. This is 
going to get boiling hot, red hot. This is hot. This is really, really quite 
painful now. Oh, shit.  
 
It’s stopped burning. That’s right. You can stop burning now. It’s still stuck. 
It stinks actually. It sticks. It’s as if someone dropped that in some dog shit. 
It absolutely stinks. It’s terrible. That’s right. 
 
The person I’m touching now, in a moment when I say one, two wide 
awake – when I say one, two wide awake, your eyes will open. Your eyes 
will open and you will have turned into an exam invigilator, and you will 
demand silence in this room. If anyone laughs, titters, speaks, makes a 
movement – you understand this is the most important examination. 
 
That’s right, that smell is getting 10 times worse with each passing 
moment. That’s right. If anyone laughs, makes a noise in here, you are 
going to call them out. You are going to tell them to be quiet. You will not 
be violent. You will not be physical but you will be furiously angry about 
this. Nod your head when you understand. That’s right. 
 
One, two – wide awake.  
 
Student: 
Keep your mouths shut! 
 
Anthony: 
Sleep, and you have Tourette’s syndrome. You have an incredibly foul 
mouth. One, two – wide awake. 
 
Student: 
Excuse me, you dirty mother-fucking bastard. Stand still for two seconds. 
This is not – no, keep this as far away from me, because that smells like 
ass. Keep that as far fucking away from me as possible you dirty, stupid 
bastards, you fucking son of a …. 
 
Anthony: 
Sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, sinking and floating and 
drifting down to sleep. Deeper sleep now.

137 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
The person I’m touching now, in a moment when I say one, two wide 
awake, your eyes are going to open. You are going to turn into Michael 
Jackson. You are Michael Jackson, the world’s greatest dancer, the world’s 
biggest pop star. You are Michael Jackson. You move like him, you make 
noises like him and you love every single second. That’s right.  
 
You’re so good. You feel so good. You’re going to walk down these steps 
just like Michael Jackson would and you’re going to pop some Michael 
Jackson moves out right there on the carpet. Your head will nod when that 
is on board. 
 
One, two – wide awake. It’s your stage. That’s right. Come on let’s give 
him some love, ladies and gents. 
 
Michael, Michael, sleep now. Sleep now. Deeper sleep, deeper sleep. Just 
melt down, down into the ground, deeper sleep, deeper sleep. 
 
Everybody who’s been on stage, including Marcus, everybody who’s been 
on stage close your eyes now. Close your eyes. You can let go of that card. 
That’s right. Your fingers still absolutely stink of dog shit though. I’m 
kidding. 
 
Close your eyes and sleep. Close your eyes and sleep. Close your eyes and 
sleep. Let go of any tension now. Let go of any tension. Deeper relaxed, 
deeper relaxed.  
 
Now in a moment I’m going to wake these five people up and when I wake 
them up, I want a massive round of applause. It takes a lot of guts to come 
up here and do this. Any other of you that want to get involved, then 
you’re going to have an opportunity to get involved in a very short period 
of time. 
 
Everybody on stage – and Marcus – when I say the words one, two, three, 
four, five – in a moment I’ll get to five and your eyes will open and you’re 
going to be wide awake, alert, back in the room, everything back to 
normal, all the silly suggestions gone but you will be on your best form. 
You’ll be on fantastic form.  
 
When we go out later on, you’re going to be full of confidence. All the 
ideas that you’ve learned over these two days will flow. Your words will 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
138 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
flow. Your knowledge will be there. This is going to be easy for you. It’s 
just like breathing. It’s just like a heartbeat. This is going to be easy. You’re 
going to be on top form. 
 
Getting ready now, letting go of all the silly suggestions, again 
understanding when you go out later on you’re going to be on absolutely 
top form, understanding you are the hypnotist. 
 
You can forget much of the silly stuff you did up here on stage unless you 
particularly want to remember it, and if you want to remember it then of 
course you can just find it quietly and easy. 
 
One – feeling wonderful. Two – feel a surge of energy pouring in through 
your fingers and your toes, right up to the top of your head. Three – take a 
deep breath. That’s right. More and more energy coming and take a deep 
breath. Fill your chest up with energy, giving oxygen. Four – your head 
washed through with cold spring water, feeling amazing. Five – let’s hear it 
for them, ladies and gents. 
 
Feeling good? 
 
Hallucinations 
 
Anthony: 
A few questions – people keep asking me about hallucinations, and you’ve 
seen people having hallucinations now. You get a variety of responses. In 
terms of how to suggest a hallucination, it’s not really that different to 
anything else. You just have to find the language and describe how it will 
be. 
 
I would still have the same structure as we outlined when I went for 
amnesia. Let’s say it was invisibility – kind of a classic thing. 
 
Once you give some amnesia, there’s one stepping stone – invisibility – 
standing in front of someone and being absolutely invisible is another 
stepping stone. I know I can remember very clearly the first time I gave 
that suggestion, it felt ridiculous. It felt absurd to even be saying it.   
 
I said open your eyes and he opened his eyes and I stepped to the side, 
and the proof for me is that his eyes didn’t even flicker. They didn’t even 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
139 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
register to the side. I was invisible so I could make things float and I do 
what I wanted to do. 
 
The best way of giving the suggestion I think is firstly to say it directly. In a 
moment when I say one, two wide awake, your eyes will open and you’ll 
no longer be able to see me. I will be invisible.  
 
I normally say in fact you’ll no longer be able to see me or the clothes I’m 
standing up in. I will be invisible. I will then find a few analogies and other 
ways of saying that. It will be as if I’m completely gone, vanished.  
 
The harder you try and find me, the more difficult it becomes because I am 
invisible. You will no longer be able to see me or the clothes I’m standing 
up in. 
 
This will seem completely normal to you because I don’t want him to be 
thinking oh, where is he, where is he, where is he? What I want is that 
when things starting floating past him, that freaks him out, not the fact 
that I’m not there. 
 
You can do all sorts of things with that kind of hallucination. You can make 
things move. You can make things float. You can make things levitate. You 
can touch the person’s tie and jacket and kind of freak them out a little bit 
like that. 
 
Earlier on someone made everyone in here invisible. Again, that can be 
quite amusing sometimes. If people think they’re on their own, you’ll see 
stage hypnotists doing the x-ray glasses routine, so you can see through 
people’s clothes.  
 
It’s 10 times funnier if you say but you don’t believe anyone can see you 
because then they really do go and have a good look and think they’re 
getting away with it. 
 
You can hallucinate in all of the senses. I think one of the major blocks that 
some of us have as subjects, rather than as hypnotists, is that our 
expectation about what a hallucination will be is that it will be solid and 
perfect and tangible.

You know, there’s a dog over there that I really could go over there and 
touch the dog. When you look at assignments and particularly detailed 
reports from the post, detailed interviews of people, that’s not really what 
they described. They often describe this kind of semi-transparent realities. 
They will say I knew you were there but it just wouldn’t register.  
 
They are seeing you at some level obviously. The information is still going 
through their eyes, but the beliefs they have at that moment are that 
you’re not there. That’s what’s firing off in their brains. They respond 
accordingly. 
 
That’s why some people just seem to naturally accept that when they’re 
seeing this kind of semi-transparent reality, this dog or what it is in their 
peripheral view and they know it’s there. If you’re a good hypnotist, you’ll 
say what kind of dog is it? How big is it? Imagine it twice as big. Make 
them imagine that too.  
 
They can describe it and that can be your act, but if you were to really, 
really interrogate that person afterwards and say what was it like, what 
was the experience of invisibility actually like, then very often it’s not quite 
as tangible as that. 
 
We perform with something of an illusion, if you like. It’s not that they’re 
making it up. It’s that imagined and projected thing that they’ve got no 
sense of control over is automatic. It’s becoming more solid if you like in 
the eyes of the audience because of their response to it, because of the 
questions that are being asked of them. 
 
It’s the same with amnesia. If you really interrogate people afterwards and 
say at any point did your name go through your mind, about 70% of the 
people say yeah, I think it did actually, but they couldn’t say it. They 
couldn’t find it, so the illusion was that this was gone and it was 
irretrievable.   
 
Make Money 
 
Student: 
Yes, short of seeing things on television, how is a direct way we can 
actually make money with these skills? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
141 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
Sorry? 
 
Student: 
How do you make money? 
 
Anthony: 
Firstly if you take this into your existing work, if you’re in sales and you 
have to give sales presentations and you have to motivate a sales team or 
a team of – I don’t know – telly sales people, or you’ve got to give a big 
presentation, then use some of these techniques. 
 
This is an extension of what you do. The suggestions can be about 
motivation and focus and energy. I mean you can do amazing things with 
sales people. You can speak to a telly salesperson and say every time you 
get a no, you’ll know you’re just one step closer to the yes. You’ll pick up 
the phone as if it’s the first time you’ve picked it up that day. 
 
Then they’ll just be like a machine. They will make more phone calls. They 
will have more success. You can make money out of it by looking at what 
you do already and being special, having a special skill.  
 
If you want to perform, then the concept of a walk-around hypnotist, like a 
walk-around close-up magician, it wasn’t really there until very recently 
but I get paid to do that. I know plenty of other people who get paid to do 
that, or at least mix it in with what they do.  
 
I know someone who does ghost tours up in Scotland, and he picks 
someone out. There is going to be at least one person absolutely freaking 
out when they walk in that room because they’re going to have this 
freezing cold breeze going through their body and stuff like this. 
 
His tours are more special than others. No one knows that he uses 
hypnosis but there’s a lot more activity going on, on his tours. That’s one 
way of charging more money. 
 
Another way – it’s kind of like whatever I do, I will be doing hypnosis. I was 
doing this for a number of years when I had other jobs. I worked in sales 
for years and I had to give those kinds of presentations, and sometimes I’d 
just use it to illustrate points and stuff like that. 
 
Firstly perform. Just get used to performing. Get used to charging for your 
services, even if you’re going to turn up at a party for an hour. They will 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
142 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
have a completely different experience if you’re there, that’s one thing 
you can do. Just blatantly perform with it. 
 
You’ll find it easy to get into local press with this for good reasons, 
hopefully, 
for 
the 
right 
reasons. 
They’re 
always 
looking 
for 
demonstrations. Groups, Rotary Clubs, hobbies, interests. You heard Bob. 
He doesn’t even play golf anymore. He just does a five-minute 
presentation.  
 
Yes, he knows therapy, so he can sell his therapy by magnetic fingers and 
people’s feet being stuck to the floor. If you’re a hypnotherapist, your 
practice should be busier because of this. There’s no question.  
 
If you’re a hypnotherapist, you’ve been asked dozens if not hundreds of 
times can you hypnotize me, and you probably as I did for a few years 
avoided it. If you say yes, let me show you something really cool, bang. 
Come and see me, but let me show you what I do. I’ll give you a taste of it 
right now. Just get used to it. 
 
You will get more clients and they’ll report. The other thing about it is you 
can do good therapy, just relaxed therapy style. Just have the person 
relaxed and whisper away a little metaphor to them and it’s very nice, and 
it can be effective. 
 
They’ll leave thinking was I hypnotized? When they’re asked by their 
friends, they’ll say I don’t know. I mean I haven’t had a cigarette, but I 
don’t think I was hypnotized. I must have just been ready to change. They 
are saying that, trust me.  
 
If their hand was stuck to their face midway through that session, that is 
what they’ll be talking about. It’s exactly the same experience but they 
have something they can sneeze about, that they can talk about. Yes, I did. 
I could hear him but the weirdest thing was at one point I swear I couldn’t 
put my hand down. 
 
That becomes the little gem that the person talks about. You should be 
busier if you’re a hypnotherapist. You should be special if you’re in any 
kind of profession – nursing or any other kind of therapy, sports coach.

Again, it’s to go around the world attending difference conferences and 
things like that. I know a heart surgeon who does the same. A lot of his 
time is spent amongst professionals. They’re still fascinated with hypnosis. 
He’s the one people gravitate toward in a room because he’s the one with 
the fun skills. He’s the cool guy at the party. 
 
Personally, I get money from this from performing. I get a busier therapy 
practice because I’ve been doing therapy a long, long time. I’ve got a 
busier therapy practice because of it, and whenever I get opportunities to 
get in local press, local paper, local radio or whatever, I will be doing a 
demo. I will never go and just speak and theorize about it. It’s pointless. 
You’ve got to show the person something. 
 
Student: 
I’d like to ask a quick question. With street hypnosis, like you’re just going 
out where we did last night, yesterday or whatever, how do you make 
money out of that. 
 
Anthony: 
You make money out of that – I don’t make a huge amount of money by 
just going out on the street. That’s just what I do. It’s a way of raising 
awareness, but however – if I lived around here, then I’d be the 
entertainer outside someone’s casino who’s causing some traffic and 
pushing them towards somewhere. 
 
If you don’t want to do stage hypnosis, then why don’t you go and do this 
on someone’s conference stand. In the same way they’ve got a snake in a 
box or some other random thing standing there, occasionally they’ll have a 
magician. We’ll do this. Gather a crowd, do a performance, get them 
promoting the company. You’ll get paid thousands of dollars a day to do 
that and it’s impromptu. How do you get paid to do hypnosis on the 
street? It’s a little bit more difficult. 
 
Student: 
I’ll tell you, last night I actually – there were a lot of street performers if 
you noticed along that Freeman street. I just slipped in a line at the end of 
what I was saying. I just said I don’t get paid for being here, guys. Thanks 
for watching. I got about $80 handed in my hand just from everyone 
watching. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, so you can busk. 
 
Student: 
You can’t busk. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Bonus Transcript Manual 
 
144 Advanced WUSH Bonus Transcript Manual       ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
You can busk with it. A guy came up to us at one of the casinos last night 
and just said there was an act down here, he did this and he did that, and 
it didn’t sound that amazing. It sounded like something you might all have 
seen, and he picked up $1,000 in one hit from one crowd. 
 
You can earn money but if you’re going to go down that road, then you’ve 
got to look into licensing. You’re going to need permission from a venue, 
or you’re going to have to start to really think about this as a performance 
business. 
 
It’s kind of tough to earn money on the street unless you’re busking and 
working with somebody. 
 
Student: 
She was asking about making money – I mean the essential skills we get 
here can be brought to the stage and you can do, like you said, Rotary, 
Lions Club, fundraisers for them.  
 
In the United States, unlike the U.K., I can go and do fundraisers for the 
high school band and do shows for all the kids at the school. They can 
charge $8 a ticket. I get a percentage of that and they get the rest of the 
door, and it’s very easy for them to do. They make a really nice return on 
it. They make a nice chunk of change, and all the kids have had just a 
fabulous time. 
 
You can raise money for these clubs and in raising money for them, you 
get a piece of it and that’s good money. 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, although this is very much about performance and we keep getting 
people on the stage, it kind of looks a bit like stage hypnosis. I would just 
add that if you want to do a traditional stage hypnosis act to get some 
training, not that the hypnotizing bit need be any different. 
 
As you can probably tell now, I don’t really have a need or believe in 
advanced techniques and masters, master training. To me that’s not 
important. The hypnotizing bit, I’m going to choose a technique that suits 
where I’m at and what I’m doing. If it’s quiet and I’m sitting at a table with 
someone, then I’ll make their pulse jump around and then we’ll get into 
something like that.

If I’m on the street, it’s going to big, it’s going to bigger, it’s going to be 
arms in the air. If I’m on stage, it’s quite often dropping people on their 
back on the stage. I don’t do that anymore but that’s a classic induction. 
 
The core difference with stage is there are some particular ways of 
managing the crowd and the audience and health and safety, but apart 
from that you can perform with hypnosis. You’re right. You could turn up 
as an impromptu – essentially impromptu act and do it. 
 
Student Earns $7,000 With Street Hypnosis 
 
Bob: 
 This is actually something that all of you guys can do. It’s using everything 
we’ve learned over the past couple of days. I did a demo at a golf course 
for a friend who is a general manager at a very expensive, high end golf 
course and I was invited to go do a peak performance hypnosis for golfers.  
 
The last time I played golf I couldn’t break 100. I used to be an okay golfer, 
but it was like 20 years ago. I know nothing about golf, I hate golf, but I can 
still do really, really good peak performance hypnosis. 
 
Two of the beliefs that I have anytime I’m going out on the street doing 
hypnotherapy are: 
 
1. Everyone already has all the resources they need inside of them; I’m 
just going to help them get in touch with those resources. I don’t need 
to be a good golfer. If they play golf, they already know how to be a 
good golfer. 
2.  Everything that happens was supposed to happen.  
 
I’ll tell you how there was one thing that kind of got screwed up that I just 
went and rolled with and kept going. 
 
 
I went and did a demo and the three things I did were magnetic fingers, 
magnetic palms and the levitation. The levitation was for them to get in 
touch with their internal focus.  
 
So if you talk to golfers they’ll tell you the things they need are strength, 
focus, concentration and the ability to stay grounded when they’re 
swinging. You know every golf coach tells you, keep your eye on the ball.

So I did those three things, three or four minutes, they were having a good 
experience, then I asked for somebody to be a volunteer and I brought up 
one guy to be the volunteer. I took him through a street show, just like 
you’ve been doing for the past couple of days. 
 
First I did the hand to eye fixation, then I did the arm catalepsy, and the 
arm catalepsy was for the power. Then I got other people to come up, and 
he’s locked and I got a couple of guys to come up and I said “Try to push it 
down. Try and find that you can’t. Don’t push too hard because you don’t 
want to knock him over” to keep them from it becoming a contest.  
 
Then again, I did the focus and brought his hand in, but this time I was 
doing a much more dramatic visualization with him and getting his 
feedback and telling the group. As he was coming up, he was more vividly 
able to focus and have greater concentration.  
 
Then the third thing I did was grounding him to the ground so he’d stay 
grounded. I got him to lock his feet to the ground so that he couldn’t 
move, try as hard as you will, you’re not going to be able to move. 
 
When I tested that, it actually failed. I said “Go ahead, try to take a step 
right now” and I didn’t even have a chance to say “Stop testing or 
anything”, he just walked.  
 
To me, that was supposed to happen, so I just said “That’s right, your 
unconscious mind wants you to know you’re still in control. Always in 
hypnosis, you’re completely in control. Your unconscious mind is also 
telling you that you’re not yet as fully grounded as you want to be. And 
you want to be grounded because this is what’s really going to help your 
golf game.” 
 
I got him to do it again, but now I’m anchoring the emotion and building it 
back in there. If you want to have that firm state of grounding, then you 
need to be able to master this particular skill and so next time around, told 
him he’d be able to move everything but his feet and everyone’s going 
wild. 
 
And afterwards, and this has taken maybe 25 minutes, and afterwards 
everybody’s going ‘do me, I want to do that.’ Toward the end of the

presentation, I was offering a package for 20 minutes worth of stuff. Guys, 
if you’ve had a really good experience and you really want to get this stuff 
and have a life changing experience, it’ll not only change your golf game, 
it’ll change your entire life, then I have a package of four hypnotherapy 
sessions that I’ll do right here at the golf course. 
 
My recommendation is that we do two in rapid succession, like maybe one 
on Monday and one on Thursday and then you go out and play several 
rounds of golf. Play golf for three or four weeks, then I’ll come back and 
we’ll do another session, then two or three months later I’ll come back 
and we’ll do the fourth session, so you’re able to integrate this material. 
 
This is a very expensive golf club to join, for rich people, it’s one of the 
nicest ones, but I sold the package for $997.00. I had 25 people that were 
there and seven of them took me up on it, so in twenty minutes I had a 
$7,000.00 day. Using only stuff you all know how to do.
