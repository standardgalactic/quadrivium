About the Author
A writer and cycling aficionado who has lived in Spain, Brazil, 
and Ecuador, Neil E. Schlecht now resides in Litchfield County,
Connecticut. His first exposure to Spain was as a college sopho-
more teaching English at Col.legi Sant Ignasi in Barcelona. He
returned to Barcelona just before the 1992 Summer Olympics and
stayed for most of the following decade, working as a consultant
on social and economic development projects for the European
Union and as a contributing writer for a Spanish art and antiques
magazine. The author of a dozen travel guides, as well as articles
on art and culture and art catalogue essays, Neil is especially keen
on assignments that take him back to Spain.
The author counts among the highlights of his Spanish travels a
few treasured road miles cycling in the Navarra countryside along-
side Miguel Indurain, Spain’s five-time Tour de France champion.
Neil’s favorite reminder of Spain is his Labrador retriever, who
hails from a farm on Ibiza, one of the Balearic Islands. Despite her
relocation to the United States, she plays deaf to any commands
not in Spanish.


Dedication
To Keny, who immersed me in the ways of Spain, and Solà, whose wine-
fueled charlas in his art studio helped me interpret them. 
And to Sharon, who makes me want to hurry home.
Author’s Acknowledgments
A special thanks (and un abrazo muy fuerte) to Pilar Vico of the Tourist
Office of Spain in New York. Her generosity and good-natured assistance
proved essential to the completion of this book.

Introduction
F
or decades Spain has ranked as one of Europe’s premier vacation
destinations, popular among both Europeans and visitors the world
over. If you’ve been considering a trip to Europe, but haven’t been sure
which country would best fit your interests and budget, Spain makes a
superb choice for just about everyone. It appeals to the art lover, eco-
tourist, historian, gourmand, pop-culture scholar, backpacker, and unre-
pentant hedonist. And, although Spain may no longer be the European
destination of choice for individuals on a budget — who among us
remembers Europe on Five Dollars a Day? — bargain hunters can still
find enticing deals across the country.
One of Europe’s oldest yet most dynamic countries, Spain offers rich
travel experiences: architecture dating back to the Romans and Moors,
some of Europe’s most spectacular art museums, warm and welcoming
people, vibrant festivals, fantastic food, and brilliant weather. Its well-
rounded roster of attractions makes it ideal for year-round vacationing;
you can soak up the good life at outdoor cafes, hit the beaches, and join
sports-mad Spaniards in everything from golfing and boating to cycling
and skiing. Spain is a nation of many cultures, traditions, and even lan-
guages. From the stoic independence of the Basques to the progressive
architecture and design of the Catalans and the sultry rhythms and sun-
drenched siestas of the Andalusians, you will discover a country that in
fact comprises many Spains and many different Spaniards.
Since its incorporation into the European Union, Spain has represented
one of the E.U.’s most rapidly modernizing nations. Yet many parts of the
country refreshingly hold on to ancient Spanish traditions and mores. 
It’s not yet a place where the young and old speak English as well as they
do their native tongue — so you may have to trot out some beginner’s
Spanish to get by when visiting. Spain is one of the most relaxed and
rewarding European countries you can visit, and compared to many
northern European nations, it still remains affordable. You shouldn’t have
to kiss your retirement fund goodbye for a two-week jaunt to Spain.
About This Book
Spain is one of Europe’s largest countries, so it’s unlikely that you can go
everywhere you want — at least not on a single trip. You have to pick
and choose carefully, and that’s where this book comes in handy. Rather
than try and pack the entire country into a tome that’s too heavy to
carry around, I focus on the best of the best, the top destinations for a

first- or second-time traveler to Spain — the places you just have to see,
the best spots to stay and eat, and the easiest ways to design efficient
regional trips instead of trying desperately to scurry across the country. I
also offer you tips for saving money and give you careful selections and
recommendations in every crucial category, from small, intimate inns to
tantalizing tapas bars (bars that serve Spanish appetizers). Furthermore, 
I provide detailed insider information on activities such as choosing the
best seat at a bullfight. And just as important, I steer you away from the
places that really aren’t worth your time.
This book differs from other guides. It doesn’t just dump the information
in your lap and expect you to sort it all out, somehow unearthing the
gems in all that rough. I’ve traveled throughout Spain for nearly two
decades now, and in this book, I list the destinations and activities that I
recommend to my family and close friends. Spaniards are famously wel-
coming and helpful, but if you’ve never been there, arriving in Madrid or
Barcelona and just winging it would be pretty daunting. I’ve done the
homework so that you can hit the ground running — or relaxing, if that’s
more your speed.
I load Spain For Dummies, 4th Edition, with easy-to-understand informa-
tion and advice about Spanish customs, culture, and, of course, lan-
guage. The best place to start, though, may be with two simple phrases
you’re likely to hear frequently in Spain: Bienvenido (Welcome) and
¡Salud! (Cheers!).
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book I use some standard terminology to help you access informa-
tion quickly and easily. I give all prices in euros, the common European
Union currency. The euro has held its strength relative to U.S. dollar, with
the rate of exchange at 1:1.20 or even slightly higher. For last-minute
updates on the exchange rate, please see one of the currency conversion
tables in major newspapers or online (such as at http://money.cnn.
com/markets/currencies).
I use the Spanish method for providing street addresses. Using this style,
the building number comes after the street name, not before. For exam-
ple, if a hotel has a building number of 22 and is located on Calle Atocha
(Atocha Street), the address is written “Calle Atocha 22.” Likewise, in
many small towns, you often come across an address in which the build-
ing has no number. In these cases, the address is written “Calle Atocha,
s/n,” where s/n stands for sin número (without number).
I compile my favorite hotels, restaurants, and attractions across Spain.
Especially for the hotels and restaurants, I include abbreviations for
commonly accepted credit cards:

In the larger destinations, I divide hotels into two categories: my per-
sonal favorites (in a variety of price categories) and those that don’t
quite make the standout list but are still very much worth a stay. Don’t
be shy about considering these “runners up” if you’re unable to get a
room at one of my favorites or if your preferences diverge.
What the Dollar Signs Mean

46€–75€ ($55–$90)
$$$$$
more than 275€ ($330)
more than 75€ ($90)
I define price categories as double room (and double occupancy) for
hotels; for restaurants, it’s the average cost of a three-course, à la carte
lunch or dinner (appetizer, main course, dessert, one nonalcoholic
drink, tax, and tip) for one person. Where available, a prix-fixe menú del
día usually is cheaper, and a multicourse menú de desgustación, or tast-
ing menu, more expensive.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
I provide a page reference in the listing information. If, however, a hotel,
restaurant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way
area, it may not be mapped.
Travel information is subject to change at any time — this is especially
true of prices. Therefore, with listings in this book, I suggest that you
write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. As
much as we’ve invested in the creation of this travel guide, the author,
editors, and publisher can’t be held responsible for the experiences of
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so
above all, we encourage you to stay alert and pay attention to your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all
favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Introduction 3

Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I make a few assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler:
 You’re an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when deter-
mining whether to take a trip to Spain and how to plan for it.
 You’re an experienced traveler, but you don’t have much time to
devote to trip planning, or you don’t have much time to spend in
Spain after you arrive. You want expert advice on how to maximize
your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides every last bit of infor-
mation available about Spain or one that lists every hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a
book that focuses on the places that give you the best or most
unique experiences in Spain.
If you fit any of these criteria, rest assured that Spain For Dummies, 4th
Edition, gives you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Spain For Dummies, 4th Edition, is divided into six major parts. It starts
with introductory information about the country and planning advice,
and then moves on to the major regional sections, which contain individ-
ual destination chapters.
Part I: Introducing Spain
The first part introduces you to the glories of Spain and helps you
decide exactly where and when to go. It gives tips on planning your
budget and offers tailored tips to travelers with special interests —
everything you need to consider before planning a trip to Spain.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain
The second part helps you with all the nitty-gritty stuff — everything
from deciding what documents you need to bring with you to searching
the Web for more information. It helps you choose and book the best air-
fare and hotel (or package tour); understand how to get around Spain
and how to budget and pay for your trip; and figure out exactly what you
need to pack.
Part III: Northern Spain: Barcelona, the Costa Brava,
and the Basque Country
In Parts III through V, you can find a chapter on each major destination
in the region. Each chapter includes all you need to know about getting
Spain For Dummies, 4th Edition 
4

there and getting around; information on the top hotels and restaurants;
recommendations of the best attractions and what to do, including
shopping and nightlife; and details about easy day trips in the area.
Part III covers the best of Northeastern Spain, including Barcelona, the
Costa Brava, and the Basque Country.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile
This part covers central Spain, which includes Madrid — Spain’s 
capital — and the best of the surrounding region of Castile — Segovia,
Salamanca, and Toledo. These destinations are all easy day trips from
the capital.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia
This part is all about the region of Andalusia: Seville and Córdoba;
Ronda, the so-called pueblos blancos (white villages), and the sunny
coasts; and Granada.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
With a nod to my habit of making and keeping lists, the final part is a
couple of Top 10 lists — a compendium of both my personal faves and
curious tidbits about Spain.
Appendix: Quick Concierge
I also include an appendix, the “Quick Concierge,” which contains handy
information that you may need when traveling in Spain, such as phone
numbers and addresses for emergency personnel or area hospitals and
pharmacies, contact information for babysitters, lists of local newspa-
pers and magazines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more.
Check out this appendix when searching for answers to the many little
questions that may come up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
Keep your eyes peeled for these icons, which appear in the margins:
This icon provides you tips on pinching euros and cutting corners to
make your trip more affordable, as well as activities that are, in my opin-
ion, great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best the destination has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Introduction 5

Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware. On occasion, Heads Up icons also
indicate words to the wise aimed to make you look and feel less like a
guiri (foreigner).
Find out useful advice on what to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
This symbol designates authentic doses of Spanish culture and España
at its most real, from customs to food and drink.
Where to Go from Here
Spain for Dummies, 4th Edition, is designed for use as a reference text.
You don’t have to plow through all the chapters like a novel from front
to back; the chapters function independently of each other, allowing you
to pick up any planning section or city or regional chapter without wor-
rying about losing out on information placed elsewhere in the book.
At this point, you’re ready to dive into Spain and design the trip that
best suits you. You don’t need to get all stressed out about finding time
to brush up on your Spanish, visit travel agents, research Spain, and
plan your trip at the same time. Relax. Planning your trip doesn’t have to
be a hassle, and daydreaming about all the cool stuff you’ll see and do
can actually be fun.

t’s easy to rhapsodize about many things in Spain, so vast is its his-
tory and culture and so delightful are its people, cuisine, and wines.
You’ll literally trip over your own contenders for the best restaurants,
hotels, architecture, and museums, no matter where you go. Surely
you’ll return from a trip to Spain having compiled your own “best travel
experiences.”
The following are places and experiences that rank among the best I’ve
encountered in a couple of decades of travel in Spain. I consider many 
to be “must-sees” that I’d recommend to any friend going to Spain. In
others, you might just as well treat them as suggestions and jumping-off
points. The idea, though, isn’t for you to just check off my list of what I
think is best, but to plunge into Spain and discover for yourself all that it
has to offer.
The Best Travel Experiences
 Strolling Barcelona’s La Rambla. Much more than just a pretty
mile-long pedestrian boulevard, La Rambla is a vibrant street
parade and the epicenter of life in the Catalan capital. Lined with
newspaper kiosks, fresh-flower stands, bird sellers, human statues
in elaborate costumes and face paint, and historic buildings, it’s
where locals come day after day to practice the art of the paseo
(stroll). Stop for tapas, dip into the redolent Boquería food market,
and continue your rambles in the Gothic Quarter — the city’s

oldest section and a maze of palaces, squares, antiques shops, and
surprises. See Chapter 10.
 Racing with beasts at the Running of the Bulls. If you’re nuts
enough to run, you’ll be running from, not with, the bulls. Every
July, Pamplona hosts the festival of San Fermín and the encierro, a
mad, exhilarating rush in which throngs of locals and tourists high-
tail it through narrow cobbled streets with one-ton beasts nipping
at their heels. To live it up, you don’t have to run; the 24/7 festival
ranks as one of Europe’s great party scenes, with nonstop drinking
and dancing (and sleeping) in the streets. Whether you run or just
watch safely behind barriers, you’re unlikely to forget the mayhem.
See Chapter 12.
 Tripping along on a tavern and tapas crawl. The most inescapable
element of Spanish cooking is tapas, small snacks now popular the
world over. A tapeo is the food equivalent of an Irish pub crawl — a
bar-to-bar treasure hunt, searching for and wolfing down finger
foods that range from the endearingly simple, such as a wedge of
tortilla omelet, to the piled-high pintxos in the Basque Country.
You’ll see Spaniards at their most festive and famished when
they’re out grazing. Traipse along the streets of medieval Madrid,
the Triana neighborhood across the river in Seville, San Sebastián’s
Parte Vieja, the old town of Bilbao, or the Gothic Quarter in
Barcelona — or any small town in Spain, for that matter. Pop into a
tavern, knock back a drink and a couple of snacks, and hit the road,
onto your next stop. See Chapters 10, 12, 13, and 15.
 Getting lost in a tangle of time. Spain overflows with fine museums,
excellent repositories of Spanish art and history, but Spaniards live
with their history on a daily basis. As a visitor, wandering the
crooked streets in a lively old quarter makes for an exceptionally
enjoyable history lesson.
The streets of Toledo may be impossible to make sense of, but 
they teem with synagogues, mosques, and palaces — centuries of
Jewish, Moorish, and Christian history. Cordoba’s Judería and
Girona’s El Call, two of Spain’s best-preserved old Jewish quarters,
are appealing mazes of white-washed streets, while Barcelona’s
Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter) is a slightly spooky but vibrant
warren of alleyways that once formed the core of a walled-in city.
Salamanca’s old quarter around the stunning Plaza Mayor is the
place to relive the academic life and extracurricular activities of
university students. Other great places to wander, get lost, and
absorb a dose of history are Granada’s Albaycín district, San
Sebastián’s Parte Vieja, Bilbao’s Casco Viejo, and Seville’s enchant-
ing Barrio de Santa Cruz. See Chapters 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.
 Joining the faithful at Andalusia’s fiestas. There’s nothing quite
like the stately pageantry of springtime festivals in southern Spain.
The biggies are Semana Santa (Holy Week) and Feria de Abril, the
April Fair that erupts two weeks after Easter in Seville. The galas
Part I: Introducing Spain 
10

transform Seville into the most festive and colorful place in Spain.
For Easter, the mood is deadly serious: Long processions parade
throughout the city carrying religious floats, accompanied by peni-
tents in long robes and pointy hoods, dirge music, and candles. The
Feria de Abril is the purging after Easter, when the city erupts with a
festival of flamenco and sevillana dancing, drinking, horse parades,
and gorgeously bedecked Andalusian women in polka-dotted fla-
menco dresses. At the end of May, the El Rocío pilgrimage in
Huelva is perhaps the rowdiest religious festival you’ll witness.
Attending one of the big festivals can mean extra headaches in
terms of hotel rooms, crowds, and expense, but that’s the cost of
cultural immersion. See Chapter 15.
 Appreciating art for art’s sake. Name the greatest artists of all time,
and you’ll count a significant, perhaps even disproportionate,
number of Spaniards among them. You can view many of the master-
pieces at some of the finest art museums in Europe. Madrid’s Prado,
endowed by kings, has monumental works by Velázquez, El Greco,
and Goya (as well as great Italian and Flemish works). Pablo
Picasso’s impassioned Guernica is on view down the street at the
Reina Sofía, as are the works of many other modern masters.
Barcelona boasts an impressive collection of Picasso’s early works,
single-artist museums dedicated to native sons Joan Miró and Antoni
Tàpies, and a splendid collection of Romanesque and Gothic reli-
gious art at the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya. Salvador Dalí’s
tortured genius holds surreal court at several museums in Spain, but
the best place to get a taste of his unique gifts is his museum-theater
in Figueres (Catalonia) and the home-museums he left behind in the
Catalan countryside. See Chapter 10, 11, 13, and 15.
 Meandering through Andalusia’s pueblos blancos. Dotting the
rolling hills and earthy olive groves of southern Spain is a collec-
tion of tiny, picturesque whitewashed villages, some dramatically
perched atop 1,524m (5,000-ft.) limestone slopes. Onetime defen-
sive strongholds under the Moors, the perfect white towns are tiny
mazes of medieval alleyways. The two largest pueblos blancos are
Ronda and Arcos de la Frontera; from a base at either, you can
easily take a driving tour of the many villages that lie between. See
Chapter 16.
The Best Architectural Landmarks
 Barcelona’s moderniste madness. The Catalan Art Nouveau move-
ment, known locally as modernisme, was spearheaded by the aus-
tere aesthete Antoni Gaudí, the stunningly imaginative architect
behind the futuristic (but still unfinished) cathedral La Sagrada
Familia and the wondrously wavy La Pedrera (Casa Milà). But
Gaudí was just one of several moderniste masters who left their
imprints on Barcelona. Follow the city’s Ruta del Modernisme and
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Spain 11

visit some of the other standouts, such as the apartment houses on
Paseo de Gracia’s Manzana de la Discordia (Block of Discord). See
Chapter 10.
 Museo Guggenheim Bilbao. Frank Gehry’s rapturous titanium
sculpture on the banks of the River Nervión not only single-handedly
revitalized industrial Bilbao, it revolutionized the way the public
sees art museums, setting off a competition among cities across the
globe to get their own Gehry (or something nearly as distinct and
attention-grabbing). Critics have called it the greatest building of
the modern era. Even if the structure were devoid of art inside,
droves would come to experience its sensual curves and soaring
presence. See Chapter 12.
 Segovia’s Roman Aqueduct. Going on 2,000 years, the graceful
Roman Aqueduct is one of the greatest examples of Roman engi-
neering — in Spain or anywhere. Constructed of massive blocks of
granite, in A.D. 90, without the aid of mortar or clamps, the 1km-long
(2⁄3 of a mile) aqueduct is 29m (95 ft.) high and has 166 perfectly
designed arches. Whether appreciated as a feat of engineering or
for the incredible beauty with which it stretches across the city, it’s
one of Spain’s most memorable sights, especially when illuminated
at night. See Chapter 14.
 Avila’s city walls. The imposing city walls (murallas) that enclose
the small but surprisingly plain city of Avila are perhaps the finest in
Europe. Built in 1090, Spain’s very own great wall is 2.4km (11⁄2 miles)
long, 11m (36 ft.) high, and 3m (9 ft.) thick. If you’re an architecture
buff, get up close for a view of how remarkably unscathed the walls
remain, and then retreat to see them framed against the horizon,
from Cuatro Postes (Four Pillars), an old shrine just beyond the
river. See Chapter 14.
 Salamanca’s stunning Old Quarter. A university town and a living
museum of early Spanish Renaissance architecture, Salamanca is a
stately assembly of unique architecture built around Spain’s loveli-
est Plaza Mayor. Salamanca’s architecture is renowned for ornate
Plateresque details — masterful Baroque carving — on stately
facades. See Chapter 14.
 Cordoba’s Mezquita. After the Alhambra, the great mosque stands
as the pre-eminent architectural achievement of the Moorish
dynasty that ruled Spain for 700 years. Unlike any mosque you’ve
ever seen, the eighth-century structure dazzles visitors with a magi-
cal forest of candy cane–striped arches, consisting of more than
850 columns constructed of granite, jasper, and marble. See
Chapter 15.
 Granada’s Alhambra. The supreme achievement of the Moors, and
one of the greatest pieces of architecture anywhere in Europe, is
the spectacular fortress and palace complex La Alhambra, a place
of magic, mystery, and legend. Built by the Nasrid dynasty in the
Part I: Introducing Spain 
12

13th and 14th centuries, it’s a stunning, sprawling, and serene 
compound of palaces, residences, mosques, gardens, reflecting
pools, patios, and a royal summer estate. It truly is as the Moors’
intended — an earthly paradise. See Chapter 17.
The Best Luxury Hotels
 Hotel Arts (Barcelona; % 800-241-3333 or 93-221-10-00). This
waterfront high-rise overlooks Barcelona’s beaches and is within
easy reach of the Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas. It’s a model of
modern, high-tech sophistication. Rooms are spacious and airy,
with dazzling views of the Mediterranean Sea and the city creeping
up into the hills. See Chapter 10.
 Hotel Claris (Barcelona; % 800-888-4747 in the United States, or
93-487-62-62). The Catalan capital’s other great top-of-the-line hotel
is wonderfully eclectic: Its chic contemporary design coexists
easily with a 19th-century palace facade and a private museum of
Egyptian art. This hotel draws a stylish crowd. See Chapter 10.
 Gran Hotel Domine Bilbao (Bilbao; % 94-425-33-00). A luxury
hotel with hipster design cred and abundant style, its primary 
calling card is its unrivaled location: Across the street looms the
titanium juggernaut that has the world beelining to Bilbao, the
Guggenheim Museum. Rooms are sleek, and the lounge resounds
with retro charm. See Chapter 12.
 Hotel María Cristina (San Sebastián; % 888-625-5144 in the United
States, or 943-43-76-00 in Spain). A stately, Belle Epoque hotel where
stars hunker down for the San Sebastián Film Festival, this place
has formal grace and unrestrained Old World opulence. It can’t be
beat in northern Spain. See Chapter 12.
 AC Palacio del Retiro (Madrid; % 902-29-22-93). Overlooking the
serene expanse of Retiro Park and within walking distance of the
Prado, this handsome upscale hotel, in a beautiful early-20th-
century palace, adds a perfect dose of modern style and creature
comforts to a historic structure. See Chapter 13.
 AC Ciudad de Toledo (Toledo; % 902-29-22-93 or 925-28-51-25).
With spectacular views across the river to Toledo, pretty nearly as
El Greco painted it, this stylish, modern, midsize hotel with cheer-
fully decorated rooms is the top choice in this tourist magnet south
of Madrid. See Chapter 14.
 AC Palacio de San Esteban (Salamanca; % 923-26-22-96). Tasteful
contemporary design complements the historic shell of a 16th-
century convent in the heart of Salamanca’s monumental quarter.
Though chic and minimalist, the building’s beautiful bones, includ-
ing stone walls, arched ceilings, and an interior courtyard, have
been lovingly preserved. See Chapter 14.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Spain 13

 Hotel Alfonso XIII (Seville; % 800-325-3535 in the United States, or
95-491-70-00). One of Spain’s most famous hotels, this historic place
is a favorite of royalty and others with noble means. At the edge of
lush María Luisa park, it is elegance incarnate, with marble floors,
carved wooden ceilings, and Moorish arches and tiles. It has plenty
of attitude to go with its exalted status. See Chapter 15.
 Hacienda Benazuza (Sanlúcar la Mayor/Seville % 95-570-33-44). In
the countryside about 16km (10 miles) outside Seville, this lovely
farmhouse estate, an Arab country house dating to the tenth cen-
tury, seems far too extravagant to be a hotel. It pampers guests 
in rustic Andalusian luxury, and the restaurant, overseen by the
famed chef of El Bulli in Catalonia, ranks as one of the most exclu-
sive in Spain. See Chapter 15.
 Casa de Carmona (Carmona; % 95-419-10-00). In a pretty small
town 32km (20 miles) east of Seville, this magnificent property
gracefully inhabits a distinguished Renaissance palace. The small
hotel evokes a feeling of aristocratic luxury and privilege, with
chess and billiard rooms and a richly styled library. See Chapter 15.
 AC Palacio de Santa Paula (Granada; % 902-29-22-93). A beauti-
fully converted convent is home to Granada’s plushest accommo-
dations. Though its location can’t compete with the Parador de San
Francisco (within the grounds of the Alhambra), it has style to
burn, a winning mix of contemporary and historic design. See
Chapter 17.
The Best Unique and Boutique Hotels
 Prestige Paseo de Gracia (Barcelona; % 902-20-04-14).
Surrounded by the city’s most upscale shops and quintessential
moderniste buildings, this new boutique hotel is a quiet, Zen-like
retreat bathed in soothing style. Confident and restrained, it does
design as well as any hotel in the city, but never shouts its cutting
edge. See Chapter 10.
 Relais d’Orsà (Barcelona; % 93-406-94-11). High on a hill with a
bird’s-eye view of Barcelona and the sea is this handsome secret of
an inn laid out in a palace dating to 1900. Refined and oh so relax-
ing, it exudes a fresh air that’s not really a part of the city, though
getting down to Gaudí and the Ramblas is easy enough if you can
tear yourself away. See Chapter 10.
 La Plaça de Madremanya (Baix Empordà; % 972-49-04-87). Part
fine-dining establishment and part relaxed country hotel, this
delightful little place, converted from a 15th-century farmhouse,
has an abundance of chic style. Terraces overlook gardens, an
architectural pool, and green rolling hills. The restaurant, La Plaça,
is among the best north of Barcelona. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Spain 
14

 Castell de’Empordà (Baix Empordà; % 972-64-62-54). This winning
rural inn exhibits a comfort and elegance that belie the fact that it’s
in a 700-year-old castle. Although rooms in the castle, tower, or
more modern annex are all inviting, you’ll be drawn outdoors to 
the handsome pool, gardens, and terrace with serene views of the
plains and rolling hills of the Baix Empordà. See Chapter 11.
 Miróhotel (Bilbao; % 94-66118-80). One of Spain’s hippest fashion
designers, Antonio Miró, created this chic, modern boutique hotel
just down the street from the Guggenheim Museum. The high-tech
hotel is like Miró’s clothes: clean, cool, artful, and quietly luxurious.
See Chapter 12.
 Posada Mayor de Migueloa (Laguardia; % 945-62-11-75). In a tiny,
hilltop medieval town in the heart of the Rioja wine region, this
charming and friendly family-run inn is a place for wine aficionados
and gourmands. Rooms are cozy, the restaurant is first-rate, and
the cavernous wine cellars deep beneath the inn have been storing
wine since the early 17th century. See Chapter 12.
 Villa Soro (San Sebastián; % 943-29-79-70). An exquisite small
hotel in a late-19th-century villa nestled in a residential neighbor-
hood of San Sebastián, Villa Soro combines the services of an
upscale hotel with the intimacy (and more accessible prices) of an
inn. Quiet and elegant, it’s a perfect discreet retreat — and it’s just
down the street from one of Spain’s finest restaurants, Arzak. See
Chapter 12.
 Parador Príncipe de Viana (Olite; % 948-74-00-00). This fine
parador, or state-owned hotel, has bones no other hotel can match.
In Olite, one of the oldest towns in the Navarrese kingdom, just
south of Pamplona, it’s ensconced within one section of the fairy-
tale medieval Palacio Real de Olite, the royal palace and castle
topped by cone-shaped turrets. See Chapter 12.
 Casa de Madrid (Madrid; % 91-559-57-91). Bed and breakfasts
aren’t exactly common in Spain, and although technically a B&B,
this swank little place is more like a small 18th-century palace.
Perfectly located near an actual palace, the Palacio Real, the seven
rooms are superbly decorated with antiques and rich fabrics. A few
rooms have kitchenettes, ideal for longer stays. See Chapter 13.
 Hotel Residencia Rector (Salamanca; % 923-21-84-82). This fine
small hotel, in a distinguished mansion at the edge of Salamanca’s
monumental historic district, is an oasis of refined calm. It gets all
the details exactly right, and the friendly, unobtrusive service is
unequaled in hotels of this size. You’ll think you’ve stepped into 
a five-star luxury hotel, only the prices are much friendlier. See
Chapter 14.
 Casa de los Azulejos (Córdoba; % 957-47-00-00). Finally, a small
hotel worthy of the gorgeous Mezquita and old Jewish quarter in
Córdoba. The 17th-century colonial house features a central patio
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Spain 15

overflowing with plants and just eight character-filled, colorful
rooms — which don’t lack for the Andalusian tile floors of the inn’s
name. See Chapter 15.
 Hotel Las Casas de la Judería (Seville; % 95-441-51-50). Tucked
into a tiny street at the edge of the Santa Cruz neighborhood, this
midsize hotel, part of a small chain, nailed an unbeatable formula —
stylish inns housed in historic mansions — and begat a wave of imi-
tators across Seville and the rest of Andalusia. In a 17th-century
palace that once belonged to the patron of Cervantes, it wears its
colorful history with a dose of good cheer. See Chapter 15.
 Hotel San Gabriel (Ronda; % 95-219-03-92). This folksy and
family-operated inn aims to be more personal even than most bou-
tique hotels. The friendly owners and their children put their heart
and soul into this lovely 1736 mansion, and San Gabriel is as cozy
as staying at your favorite aunt’s house — if she lived in a beautiful,
historical part of charming Ronda. A bargain. See Chapter 16.
 Hotel Casa Morisca (Granada; % 958-22-11-00). This is a romantic
and magical place to stay after you’ve visited the Alhambra, which
itself is romantic and magical and then some. This small inn, in a
15th-century villa in the Arab quarter, is similar in style to the
nearby, equally atmospheric Palacio de Santa Inés and Carmen 
de Santa Inés. See Chapter 17.
The Best Fine Dining Restaurants
 Àbac (Barcelona; % 93-319-66-00). A pioneer in El Born, the
hippest dining scene in Barcelona, still-trendy Àbac continues to
stand out for its confident and stylish presentation of Catalan haute
cuisine. Details clearly matter here, and this chic restaurant com-
petes with the best in Spain. See Chapter 10.
 Comerç 24 (Barcelona; % 93-319-21-02). A creative and chic take
on tapas by one of Barcelona’s hottest young chefs, this Born dis-
trict spot is cool enough to be a nightclub. And the suitably theatri-
cal tapas are tiny works of art. See Chapter 10.
 El Celler de Can Roca (Girona; % 972-22-21-57). Just outside of
Girona is this modern but relaxed restaurant that showcases the
individual talents of three brothers. One is the chef, another the
wine master, and the youngest the dessert wizard. Dining here is a
culinary treat of the imagination, with flavors and presentation that
are cutting edge but not self conscious. See Chapter 11.
 El Bulli (Roses/Catalonia; % 972-15-04-57). North of Cadaqués on
the Costa Brava is one of the most famous and innovative restau-
rants in Europe. Foodies from around the world fight for reservations
at Ferrán Adrià’s legendarily experimental and influential dining
palace, which is open just six months a year. If you think you’ve had
Part I: Introducing Spain 
16

inventive cuisine, you’ll reassess all that’s come before — if you can
get in. See Chapter 11.
 Zortziko (Bilbao; % 94-423-97-43). Basques are famous for their
cooking, and Bilbao’s top restaurant is right up there with San
Sebastián’s finest. The elegant and formal dining room allows
patrons to appreciate Daniel García’s memorable menu of both
innovative dishes and traditional Basque dishes. The wine cellar is
one of the most impressive in the region. See Chapter 12.
 Akelarre (San Sebastián; % 943-31-12-09). Pedro Subijana’s distin-
guished restaurant, on a hill above the Bay of La Concha, is a major
destination for gourmands. A perennial, amicable rival of the other
San Sebastián gurus, Arzak and Martín Berasategui, Subijana is per-
haps the most classic of the three, but that’s not to say he’s not a
creative artist in the kitchen. See Chapter 12.
 Arzak (San Sebastián; % 943-27-84-65). The standard-bearer of
new Basque haute cuisine, Juan Mari Arzak refuses to rest on well-
earned laurels. In a house that’s been in his family for more than
100 years, Arzak and his daughter Elena run surely the friendliest
gastronomic temple in Spain. Elegant but inviting, this is one place
not to miss in Spain if you’re serious about eating. See Chapter 12.
 Martín Berasategui (San Sebastián; % 943-36-64-71). How can 
one city have so many exquisite restaurants? The youngest of San
Sebastián’s top-ranked fine-dining establishments continues in the
esteemed tradition of Arzak and Subijana, though the determined
and creative Berasategui isn’t one to be content. He’s now involved
with several restaurants, including the one at the Guggenheim
Bilbao, but it’s clear why this one carries his name. See Chapter 12.
 Santceloni (Madrid; % 91-530-88-40). Until recently, Madrid’s top
restaurants were formal and largely traditional. However, creative
fine dining has arrived in a big way, and leading the pack is this
chic and starkly modern place connected to the upscale Hespería
hotel. Santi Santamaría, who has a thing for truffles and foie gras,
has brought some of the flair and creativity of legendary El Bulli to
the capital. See Chapter 13.
 El Pecado (Salamanca; % 923-26-65-58). Salamanca may be a digni-
fied, ancient university town, but it gets an unexpected dose of
Almodovarian flair at this campy but excellent restaurant not far
from the Plaza Mayor. Outfitted with a wink-wink religious theme
and named for wrongdoing, the kitchen makes few missteps in its
creative, modern approach to Spanish cooking. See Chapter 14.
 La Ermita (Toledo; % 925-25-31-93). This sleek new restaurant is
all picture windows looking across the river to Toledo on the hill. If
you can distract yourself from the unrivalled view, you’ll find a well-
executed and refined contemporary menu, which adds a modern
touch to traditional Castilian dishes. See Chapter 14.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Spain 17

 Almudaina (Córdoba; % 957-47-43-42). This elegant and inviting
restaurant in a 16th-century mansion, with six dining rooms and a
vine-covered patio, is Cordoba’s most sophisticated. The market-
based menu includes regional Andalusian as well as French dishes.
See Chapter 15.
 Egaña Oriza (Seville; % 95-422-72-11). In Seville, land of fried
finger foods, is this top-notch restaurant specializing in Basque cui-
sine. Elegantly located in a restored mansion just off the Murillo
Gardens and near Parque María Luisa, it’s the place to go in town
for a unique dining experience. See Chapter 15.
 Tragabuches (Ronda; % 95-219-02-91). Quiet, charming Ronda,
one of the south’s “white villages,” seems almost too easygoing to
have a wildly inventive restaurant. With a young chef at the helm,
unapologetically modern Tragabuches creates audacious interpre-
tations of classic Andalusian dishes. See Chapter 16.
The Best Museums
 Museu Picasso (Barcelona; % 93-319-63-10). Before moving to
Paris and making his mark as the greatest artist of the 20th century,
Pablo Picasso spent much of early creative career in Barcelona. His
museum in the Catalan capital, in a dazzling, sprawling palace in
the Gothic Quarter, is the largest collection of his works in Spain.
It’s not comprehensive, but it’s a great place to get a handle on
Picasso’s forming genius. Also of interest, in Picasso’s native city in
southern Spain, is the new Museo Picasso Málaga. See Chapters 10
and 16.
 Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC; Barcelona; % 93-
622-03-76). The foremost museum of Catalan medieval art, one of
the best of its kind in the world, is a surprisingly lively and engross-
ing collection of Romanesque and Gothic. Especially cool is how
the museum displays altarpieces, icons, and frescoes in apses, just
as they were in the country churches in which they were found. See
Chapter 10.
 Teatre Museu Dalí (Figueres; % 972-67-75-00). Salvador Dalí was
one of the most famous artists of the 20th century, and the Catalan
surrealist painter designed this funky theater-museum as his legacy.
Oddball, idiosyncratic, and amusing, it’s as much funhouse as it is
museum. See Chapter 11.
 Museo Chillida-Leku (San Sebastián; % 943-33-60-06). On the out-
skirts of San Sebastián is the open-air museum of the city’s favorite
son and one of the greatest sculptors of the 20th century, Eduardo
Chillida. Scattered around the pastoral grounds surrounding a 500-
year-old farmhouse are a couple dozen of his monumental abstract
sculptures in stone and iron. It makes for a lovely, relaxed outing,
and it’s great for families. See Chapter 12.
Part I: Introducing Spain 
18

 Museo del Prado (Madrid; % 91-330-28-00). The granddaddy of
Spanish museums and one of the very finest and most extensive
classical art collections in the world, the Prado is a place art afi-
cionados could get lost in for weeks. Even casual fans should thrill
at the opportunity to see so many Old Masters and masterpieces
by Velázquez, Goya, El Greco, Titian, Raphael, Botticelli, and
Rubens. Velázquez’s stunning masterpiece, Las Meninas, is the
showstopper. See Chapter 13.
 Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid; % 91-467-
50-62). Madrid isn’t only about Old Masters. The Reina Sofía is all
about contemporary art, and you can’t find a greater modern work
than Picasso’s Guernica, a massive statement about war that still
sends shivers up the spine. The museum also possesses a wonder-
ful collection of works by Miró, Dalí, and the top painters and
sculptors of abstract expressionism, pop art, and minimalism. See
Chapter 13.
 Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza (Madrid; % 91-369-01-51). A private
collection purchased by the Spanish government, this major art
museum contains more than 800 works that span the range of
Western Art, from primitives and medieval art to 20th-century
Avant Garde and Pop Art. It may not be the Prado (which is literally
across the street), but it’s the next best thing. See Chapter 13.

s the old refrain goes, it never rains in Spain, but this southern
European country of 40 million people definitely reigns on the pop-
culture radar. Think about it: the legends of Don Quixote and Don Juan;
death-defying bullfights (chronicled by Hemingway in Death in the
Afternoon) and Pamplona’s crazed Running of the Bulls; and Pablo
Picasso and Salvador Dalí, towering figures as inimitable as their ground-
breaking art. Sultry Spanish actors, such as Antonio Banderas and
Penélope Cruz, have become stars in Hollywood, making Spain even
sexier in the world’s eyes.
Of course there’s much more: the fiery rhythms of gypsy flamenco, miles
of sun-drenched beaches, lazy midafternoon siestas, costumed religious
festivals, and raucous bars flowing with wine and tantalizing tapas
(small plates of appetizers). In the language of travel brochures, Spain
has become easy shorthand for sun, fun, and passion.
Although the tourism industry has figured out how to trade quite hand-
somely on that reputation, Spain is much more than a Mediterranean
cliché. The third-largest country in Europe — but a little smaller than
Texas — Spain is a stunningly varied nation with five indigenous lan-
guages, regions and peoples defined by their own unique cultures and
histories, and an astounding geographical diversity. The Spanish land-
scape ranges from 3,300m (11,000-ft.) peaks to misty green hills that look
more like Ireland than the stereotypical Spain and the parched plains in
which Carmen, the opera heroine, once strutted her stuff. Wherever you
touch down, Spain is a fascinating country, a place to plunge into,
absorb, and return to again and again.

Welcome to España
Spain has been on the international tourism radar since the 1960s, but it
really exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, following the demise of the long-
ruling dictator Francisco Franco, Spain’s return to democracy, and its
integration into the European Union. Today, incredibly, Spain’s annual
visitors outnumber its citizens. The 1992 Summer Olympics splashed
cutting-edge, design-crazy Barcelona across TV screens, and, more
recently, Frank Gehry’s gleaming Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao piqued
the interest of art and architecture lovers around the globe. Hedonist
Spain draws not only topless sun worshippers but also night owls intent
on keeping up with Spaniards’ unparalleled ability to forego sleep, not to
mention thrill-seekers with a hankering to run for their lives while 900kg
(2,000-lb.) bulls chase them down narrow cobblestone streets. Others,
meanwhile, come to experience the traditional, gentle attractions of
Spain — the great castles and cathedrals, grand plazas, Moorish monu-
ments, art masterpieces at the Prado, and slow-paced “white villages” of
the south.
At the apex of its golden age, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain was
the most powerful nation in the world, ruling an empire that stretched
from the Americas east to the Pacific. Modern Spain is forward-looking
and dynamic, but it’s also starkly traditional, with reminders of its illus-
trious history at every turn. It’s a place where ultramodern design, cut-
ting-edge cuisine, and a robust economy coexist easily with medieval
villages seemingly untouched by the passing of centuries.
Ancient Spain was inhabited by waves of successive cultures, including
the Romans, Visigoths, Celts, and Moors (the Muslims who crossed into
Spain from North Africa and lived in and ruled Spain for more than 700
years). Today, Spain continues to be a nation of disparate cultures fash-
ioned together as one people. In fact, what is perhaps most remarkable
about modern Spain is its hard-won regionalism. Under Franco, regional
languages and cultures were suppressed in the service of a centralized
state, but today those same cultures thrive as part of 17 separate
autonomías, or autonomous regions, each with its own government.
For example, the Catalans in the northeast corner have a long history
independent of the rest of Spain, and for the most part they speak
Spanish as a second language, after Catalan. Up north, the Basques are an
ancient people who have preserved an inscrutable language that boggles
linguists, and many Basques continue to argue for political independence
from Spain. Gallegos, the people of Galicia, a region in the extreme north-
west of Spain, descended from the Celts; their language is a melding of
Portuguese and Spanish. The Spaniards of central and southern Spain
speak the national language, but their regional ties are just as strong as
those felt by the Basques and Catalans. Despite these distinct cultures
and unique points of view, which occasionally have degenerated into out-
breaks of separatist violence, Spain seems wholly unlikely to disintegrate
into small factions of independent states. (To get an idea of where these
regions are located, see the “Spain” map in Chapter 3.)
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 21

Spain is a historic, complex European nation, as well as a Mediterranean
vacation wonderland, the second-most toured destination in the world.
Northern Europeans flock to the far south for its vastly superior year-
round weather. Enticed by 300 sunny days a year, they crowd the
beaches along Spain’s east and south coasts, as well as on the islands.
You can go boating, golfing, hiking, cycling, or take part in virtually any
outdoor activity — including skiing. Although Spain’s two major moun-
tain ranges may not quite rank with the Alps, the Pyrenees in the north
and the Sierra Nevada down south are both excellent spots to hit the
slopes in winter.
Spanish History 101: The Main Events
Spain, one of the oldest inhabited places on Earth, has a long and com-
plicated history of conquerors and cultures. Cave dwellers and hunter-
gatherers — perhaps the forefathers of the Basque people — arrived on
the Iberian Peninsula around 800,000 B.C. The prehistoric cave paintings
of animals in Altamira, in the north of Spain, date from at least 13,000
B.C. and are possibly the world’s oldest.
Some 5,000 years ago, at the beginning of recorded history, a people
known as Iberians occupied parts of Spain. By 1100 B.C., a series of
Mediterranean invaders began a pattern of conquests. First came the
Phoenicians, followed by the Greeks and Carthaginians. The Romans
conquered Iberia around 200 B.C., and it remained part of their massive
empire until A.D. 414, when they ceded the Peninsula to the Visigoths,
who stayed in Spain some 300 years.
The next group of invaders had a huge and lasting impact on Spanish
culture, language, and architecture. The Moors crossed the Strait of
Gibraltar from North Africa in 711. In 756, they founded an independent
Muslim emirate in Córdoba, Europe’s most advanced city during the
ninth and tenth centuries. The Moorish occupation of Iberia — which
endured for nearly eight centuries — extended all the way to the Basque
Country in the north of Spain and resulted in a prosperous civilization,
al-Andalus (today’s Andalusia).
By the 11th century, though, Muslim dominance weakened, and Christian
kingdoms ruled the north of Spain in Navarra, León, Castile, Aragón, and
Barcelona. About this time, pilgrims began to make their way from all
over Europe along the St. James trail across northern Spain to Santiago
de Compostela, in Galicia. Factions developed in the Moorish Caliphate
and eroded the emirate’s power and influence. The Moors suffered
losses to the Christians in many parts of Spain, and the sphere of
Moorish control shrank to the Nazarid kingdom in Granada, site of the
spectacular Alhambra palace. Los Reyes Católicos, the Catholic Monarchs
Ferdinand and Isabel, captured Granada in 1492, capping the Reconquest
campaign to rid Spain of the Moors. The year was the beginning of per-
haps the most important — certainly the best documented — phase in
Spanish history.
Part I: Introducing Spain 
22

The Spanish Inquisition, a campaign of religious fervor and severe
repression of Jews, Moors, and Protestants, was instituted several years
before the end of the Reconquest. After their victory, the Spanish
Monarchs, los Reyes Católicos, declared Catholicism the national reli-
gion of Spain. All Jews were expelled in 1492, and Moors were given the
choice to convert to Christianity or suffer the same fate. Also that year,
Italian-born Cristóbal Colón — Christopher Columbus — was credited
with discovering the Americas. Under the Catholic monarchs, Spain
entered a period of glory during the 16th century. Carlos, a Habsburg
and the son of Queen Juana (called Juana the Mad) and King Philip
(called Philip the Fair), became king and was named Carlos V, Holy
Roman Emperor, in 1519. Riches flowed back to Spain from the
unabashed pillaging of the New World. Under Carlos (Charles) V and
Felipe (Philip) II, Spain flourished, extending its colonies throughout the
Americas and, to the east, as far as the Pacific. Madrid became the capi-
tal of Spain in 1561, but an economic crisis of inflation and debt rocked
the country, the result of a succession of wars against France and other
European countries.
By the end of the 16thcentury, political and economic decline beset Spain,
even as it entered its greatest artistic period. The 17thcentury is known
as Spain’s Golden Age, because the art patronage of the Habsburgs gave
rise to brilliant painters, such as Velázquez, El Greco, Zurbarán, Ribera,
and Murillo. Felipe V and the Bourbon dynasty assumed the throne in the
1700s, but additional wars and unenlightened leadership further weak-
ened the country. Another artistic genius, the wildly talented court
painter Francisco de Goya, emerged. Napoleon invaded Spain in the early
19thcentury, and Spain lost its American colonies to wars of independ-
ence. In Barcelona and then Paris, Pablo Picasso became an art-world star,
basically defining 20th-century modern art.
Spain was neutral during the First World War (1914–1919), but political
instability reigned. By the 1920s, Spain found itself under a military dic-
tatorship (though the king remained on the throne); in 1931, a revolution
led to the formation of a republic, forcing King Alfonso XIII to flee the
country. In 1936, the army ended the five-year-old Second Republic, and
civil war broke out. Ultraconservative Nationalist troops led by General
Francisco Franco stormed the country and fought Republican and
Anarchist factions for three years, defeating them in horrific battles that
drew volunteers to the Republican side from England and the United
States. Franco emerged as the military victor. He ruled as a repressive
dictator for almost 40 years.
After the end of World War II, Franco was the only remaining fascist head
of state in Europe, and he isolated Spain from the rest of the continent,
severely impeding economic development. After his death in 1975, Juan
Carlos, the handpicked successor to Franco, became king of Spain, and
democracy was restored. Spain’s budding democracy suffered a grave
threat on February 23, 1981, when the military launched a coup, even
firing shots in Parliament. But King Juan Carlos interceded, putting the
military in its place and preserving Spain’s post-Franco democracy.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 23

Spain entered the European Economic Community (now called the
European Union) in 1986 and announced its growing international pres-
ence with the celebration of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the
World Expo in Seville, both in 1992. The Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
González failed to get elected for a third term, and the center-right
Partido Popular (Popular Party) candidate José María Aznar was elected
in 1996. Aznar positioned himself as a committed ally to the United
States and backed the war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Terrorists linked to Islamist groups attacked Madrid’s commuter rail
lines on March 11, 2004, just days before a national election, killing
nearly 200 and injuring more than 1,400. The worst terrorist attack in 
the history of modern Europe, the date in Spain is referred to as “3-11.”
Aznar’s administration initially (and erroneously) linked the bombings
to ETA, the Basque terrorist group, and the Partido Popular lost the
national elections to the Socialist Party’s José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero,
who made good on a campaign promise to withdraw Spanish troops
from Iraq. Zapatero has also followed through with plans to negotiate a
ceasefire with ETA and to give the independent-minded region of
Catalonia greater autonomy.
Tourism, one of the country’s most important industries since the late
1960s, has continued to grow exponentially, and by the beginning of 
the 21st century, Spain had catapulted to second place among the most
visited countries in the world. Today, with the consolidation of the
European Union and full implementation of the euro, Spain is more inte-
grated in Europe than at any point in its history.
The Legacy: Spanish Art and Architecture
From religious art of the Middle Ages to the latest revelations of the con-
temporary art scene, Spain has produced more great artists than virtually
any other country. Several — Veláquez, Goya, El Greco, and Picasso — are
among the finest artists the world has ever seen. Spain abounds with
Romanesque and Gothic masterpieces, but the masterworks of Spain’s
Golden Age, the 17thcentury, and the 20thcentury are what most visitors
come to see. Don’t miss the Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Reina Sofía
museums in Madrid (see Chapter 13); the Museu d’Art de Catalunya,
Museo Picasso, and Fundació Miró in Barcelona (see Chapter 10); the
Theatre-Museu Dalí in Figueres (Catalonia) (see Chapter 11); and the
Museo de Bellas Artes in Seville (see Chapter 15). Those museums are the
biggest and finest, but I also highlight other eminently worthwhile reposi-
tories of Spanish art throughout the country in individual destination
chapters.
The wealth of architectural styles on display throughout Spain is
astounding; the country is like a survey of architecture from the fifth
century B.C. to the present. With relatively little effort, your trip to Spain
can encompass everything from Roman and Romanesque to Moorish
and Mudéjar, Gothic and Renaissance to baroque and Catalonia’s

unique moderniste architecture, not to mention the latest in avant-
garde design and works by some of the finest contemporary interna-
tional architects, including Frank Gehry’s famed Guggenheim Museum 
in Bilbao.
Taste of Spain: Local Cuisine
Spain has earned a reputation as one of Europe’s most sensual coun-
tries, and nowhere is this reputation more evident than in the abundant
pleasure that Spaniards take in eating and drinking. One of the greatest
attractions of a visit to Spain is the chance to follow suit, with all the
gusto of the locals. Spain’s predominantly Mediterranean diet is rich in
olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and peppers. The Moors introduced Middle
Eastern elements, such as rice and saffron, to Spanish cooking. You’ve
probably heard of, and maybe even have tried, signature dishes like
paella (the huge rice-based seafood dish), gazpacho (cold vegetable
soup), and tapas. (See the box “Talking tapas,” later in this chapter.)
If you’re expecting to find only the heavy, medieval-style cooking of clas-
sic Castilian dishes, such as roast suckling pig, or if you assume Spanish
cooks crank out spicy Latino dishes, you’re in for a big surprise. Beyond
tapas, gazpacho, and the ubiquitous tortilla española (a potato-and-
onion omelet, served hot or cold), speaking of a national Spanish cuisine
is nearly impossible. Instead, Spain takes pride in a number of unique
regional cuisines. With Catalonia’s rich Mediterranean diet — both
sophisticated and rustic — the Basque Country’s delicate preparations,
Central Spain’s roasted meats and game, the north coast’s fresh seafood,
and Andalusia’s revered cured hams, fried fish, and refreshing cold veg-
etable soups, you’ll find a culinary variety in Spain that’s hard to match
anywhere else in the world. In addition to the almost endless regional
bounty, a number of young Spanish chefs, especially in places such as
Barcelona and San Sebastián, have revitalized Spanish cooking with
edgy, modern flair and catapulted Spain into a European gastronomic
temple. Indeed, many gastronomes and critics now cite Spain, rather
than France, as the European leader in culinary achievement.
Spain is surrounded on almost all sides by water, and fresh seafood is a
fundamental part of the Spanish diet. But meat is equally important.
Spaniards especially love pork and cured ham. In fact, jamón serrano
(cured ham) is one of Spain’s true delicacies. Spaniards also eat plenty
of salads, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Spain may not be the easiest place
for vegetarians (and it’s harder still for vegans), because good vegetar-
ian restaurants are few and far between. But nearly every restaurant has
a good selection of salads, nonmeat soups, and vegetables.
Spanish cooking has really started to make its mark around the world,
with tapas bars sprouting like mushrooms in the United States, Canada,
and the United Kingdom. At some places abroad, tapas are just an
excuse to serve a tiny bit of food for a big price, but that’s not the case
in Spain. Tapas, which cover everything from free little snacks, such as
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 25

olives, chips, slices of spicy chorizo sausage, and cubes of cheese, to
haute-cuisine minimeals, are a longtime Spanish tradition. Joining a jubi-
lant tapeo, or tapas crawl, is one of the finest eating experiences in
Spain. People refer to tapas bars by a variety of names — tascas,
mesones, bodegas, and tabernas — but they all serve small amounts of
food and free-flowing beer and wine. Like ravenous Spaniards, you can
saunter from bar to bar, nibbling on an amazing array of snack foods laid
out before you and then wash it all down with a sherry, un tinto o vino
blanco (red or white wine), or cerveza (beer).
Knowing what to expect when you’re eating out
Spaniards are passionate about many things, eating chief among them.
Dining — whether at home, at a tavern, or at an elegant restaurant — is
an important social affair, a time to relax, and an event to prepare for,
savor, and talk about afterwards. Lunch is the main meal of the day, and
savoring a fine meal is always cheaper at this time than it is at night.
Look for the fixed-price menú del día (menu of the day), which usually
includes an appetizer, main course, dessert, bread, and wine or water for
a reasonable price (often around 15€, or $18). Be warned, though, that
for most North Americans and northern Europeans, Spain’s dinner hours
are absurdly late (see “Chow time: Knowing when and what to eat,” later
in the chapter).
One of the highlights of eating in Spain is sampling regional specialties —
suquet de peix (seafood stew) in Catalonia; cordero asado (roast baby
lamb) in Castile; bacalao al pil-pil (salt cod in garlic sauce) in the Basque
Country; gambas al ajillo (garlic-soaked shrimp) in Andalusia; and many
more. In each dining section, I highlight some of the typical regional
Part I: Introducing Spain 
26
Talking tapas
The hunt for tapas is called a tapeo. The term tapas covers all types of snacking, but
there’s actually an entire vocabulary that goes along with finger foods. A ración (rah-
thyohn) is a full serving, a plate to be shared with one or more amigos. You may, how-
ever, consume a media-ración (half-ration) solo. A tapa, strictly speaking, is a tiny
morsel served free along with your beverage, or a slightly more substantial single serv-
ing, also called a pincho (peen-choh).
The word tapa means lid, and tapas, the snacks, emerged from a tradition of placing
scraps of food on top of wine jugs in taverns. Patrons drank the wine and then downed
the contents of the lid, too. Pretty soon, tavern owners started setting snack-filled
saucers on top of drinks. The tapeo, the often boisterous bar-to-bar snack cruising,
has its own curious origin. After church, men would gather at the tavern while the
women went home to prepare the Sunday meal. The men would stroll from tavern to
tavern, meeting up with friends and scarfing down finger foods and wine until it was
time to go home for dinner.

dishes. Look for the sections titled “Eating Like a . . .” and try what I 
recommend.
You’ll find a whole range of restaurants in Spain, from informal taverns
and family-owned joints to elegant European dining rooms. In the cities,
finding a wide variety of cuisines won’t present a problem — French and
Italian are common, and more diverse ethnic choices, such as
Vietnamese, Mexican, and Indian, are also beginning to take hold. In this
book, however, I focus largely on the best Spanish restaurants and
regional Spanish cooking.
Keeping the price right
You can keep your costs down and eat wonderfully for much less than
you may spend in most other parts of Europe. However, if you eat like
most Spaniards — four-course meals twice daily with a bottle of wine
each time — you may find your food budget becoming as tight as your
belt. At lunch, a cheap menú del día costs 1€ to 15€ ($12–$18) or less; at
a mid-range restaurant, expect to pay from 15€ to 20€ ($18–$24); and an
upscale-restaurant meal costs from 20€ to 30€ ($24–$36). At lunch,
paying much more than that is rare. You generally spend more at dinner,
when the menú del día is much less common. Dinner is almost always à
la carte (menu items priced separately). An inexpensive restaurant often
costs from 15€ to 20€ ($18–$24) for a full dinner; at the moderate range,
from 20€ to 35€ ($24–$42); and at upscale restaurants, dinner starts
around 35€ ($42) per person and goes up from there. At even the finest
Spanish restaurants in top dining cities, though, you’re unlikely to spend
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 27
Still smoking — but not as much
Spain — among the E.U.’s biggest consumers of tobacco — has long been one of
those European nations, like France and Italy, where it seems as if smoking is, simply,
a national characteristic. In fact, the number of adult smokers has dropped steadily,
and only about one-third of the population continues to smoke. That doesn’t neces-
sarily mean you won’t see groups of 11-year-old girls in Catholic-school uniforms light-
ing up on the way to their first class (despite the fact that the legal age for purchasing
tobacco has been raised from 16 to 18). Still, a new law banning smoking in public
places, including on public transportation and in offices, hospitals, and some bars and
restaurants, was enacted in early 2006 (similar to laws already in effect in Ireland,
Norway, and Italy). The law allows bars and restaurants smaller than 100 square
meters to choose whether or not they will be smoke-free; larger establishments must
demarcate nonsmoking areas. In addition, the current ban on tobacco advertising on
TV will be extended to billboards. Though 70 percent of the population in a govern-
ment survey supported the ban, Spain is still adjusting to the new law (after all, this is
a country where it is legal to smoke small amounts of marijuana and hashish). Though
smoking is not as prevalent as it was only a few years ago, in practice, many Spaniards
simply disregard the smoking ban. To sit in a nonsmoking section, ask for no fumar.

much more than 75€ ($90) a head — a figure that’s almost ridiculously
easy to reach in London, Paris, or New York. One exception is the 
multiple-course tasting menus at the Michelin-starred restaurants in 
San Sebastián, known to be the best and most expensive dining scene in
Spain, where the dinner of your life will run you more than 100€ ($120) 
a head.
Chow time: Knowing when and what to eat
Spaniards eat late — often very late — and meals are leisurely. You may
want to try and adopt the rhythm of later mealtimes before you go, even
if that requires snacking and/or napping. Only a handful of restaurants
outside of the tourist areas adapt to foreigners who want to eat lunch at
noon and dinner at 6 p.m.
Breakfast (desayuno)
For desayuno (breakfast), most Spaniards eat little — perhaps just a café
con leche (coffee with milk) and a few tostadas (toast with jam, cheese,
or sometimes, ham and olive oil) or churros (fritters) on their way to
work. They more commonly get to the office and then, around 10 a.m.,
drop down to the local bar or cafe for a croissant and coffee, or even a
beer, sherry, or a shot of a stronger drink.
Lunch (almuerzo; comida)
Membership in the European Union is slowly but surely changing
Spaniards’ daily routines and eroding some long-held traditions. Today,
fewer and fewer people return home from the office for the midday meal
and quick siesta. Sandwich shops are making inroads, and many bars
and cafes sell bocadillos (cheese, ham, tortilla, and chorizo sandwiches).
However, almuerzo (lunch — known as comida, too) remains the center-
piece of the day, and many offices close from 1:30 or 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Most restaurants open for lunch at 1 p.m., but many only begin to see
crowds just after 2 p.m. (Sneaking in before the 2 p.m. rush is wise.)
The midday fixed-priced menu, which has all but disappeared in most of
Europe, remains one of Spain’s best deals. A set price of about 12€ to
15€ ($15–$18) buys a three-course meal, often including a bottle of
house wine. (Spaniards not only share a bottle of wine over lunch, even
Part I: Introducing Spain 
28
Taking a siesta!
The siesta, a post-lunch nap, used to be one of the defining customs of Spain. Yet only
20 percent of Spaniards, according to a study by Barcelona’s Dexeus Institute, con-
tinue to find time for daily siestas. But, although businesses and shops have slowly
conformed to American and European work schedules, many continue to close
between 1:30 or 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.

during the week, but they may very well have a cocktail before or
cognac after the meal, too.)
Dinner (cena)
In Spain, the tarde (afternoon) lasts until about 8 p.m., so if you sit down
to supper at 6 or 7 p.m., you’ll be eating dinner in the afternoon, a most
peculiar concept. People in Spain eat dinner uncommonly late, usually
beginning no earlier than 9 p.m. and often starting as late as 11 p.m. or
even past midnight.
You don’t have to eat quite as late as locals, however. Restaurants gener-
ally open for dinner at 8 p.m., though you can expect to be one of the
few people ordering dinner at that hour. Everybody else is enjoying
tapas and cocktails in the bar. The best plan is to down some tapas at
your normal dinnertime to pace yourself for the late hours.
Tasting Spanish wines
A lot of visitors are surprised to discover that Spain grows more wine
grapes than any other country. Although Spain still ranks behind France
and Italy in terms of wine production and reputation, Spanish wines are
definitely on the rise, and some of the most exciting wines to emerge in
the last few years have come from previously little-known wine-producing
regions and small vineyards in Spain. Spanish wines enjoy a long and
illustrious history, and many excellent Spanish wine producers are
finally earning the worldwide acclaim that they deserve, with their wines
sitting alongside great Bordeauxs and Brunellos in the cellars of the
most celebrated restaurants. For their level of sophistication, though,
Spain’s fine wines are remarkably affordable, even in restaurants. Red
wines remain the country’s standouts for fine dining, while light whites
and dry rosés are prized casual wines. The fortified wines from the
south make particularly good aperitifs and dessert wines.
Among Spain’s most celebrated vinos tintos (rich reds, made predomi-
nantly from tempranillo and garnacha grapes) are those from wineries in
the most traditional regions: La Rioja, Ribera del Duero, and Navarra
(north of Madrid). Riojas are by far Spain’s best-known wines, and in
general still the most traditional, though Riberas are now every bit their
equal. Other regions producing quality reds are Penedès (south of
Barcelona) and the two newest stars, Priorat (southwest of Barcelona)
and Toro (northwest of Madrid), both of which turn out sophisticated
and powerful wines that have garnered plenty of international attention.
Several regions still largely unfamiliar to many wine drinkers outside
Spain — Yecla, Jumilla, and La Mancha, all southeast of Madrid, and
Bierzo, in Galicia — in the last few years have begun to market very
good reds that are excellent values both home and abroad. Many
regions, including Penedès, Rueda, and Rioja, produce refreshing vinos
blancos (white wines). The young, light, and fruity whites of Galicia,
Albariños, and Ribeiros are excellent with shellfish and seafood. To top
it off, there’s jerez (or fino), classic sherry from Andalusia, and the
world’s best-selling bubbly, cava — the sparkling wine of Catalonia.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 29

Individuals who already know Spanish wines will be delighted to dis-
cover lengthy cartas de vino (wine lists) that offer many wines unavail-
able outside Spain. If you’re not really much of a wine connoisseur, you
usually can’t go wrong with the vino de la casa, the house wine. (In small
restaurants the house wine is a carafe or bottle of regional wine, while in
fine restaurants it may be a bottle selected by the sommelier or a wine
made especially for the restaurant.) Vino de mesa refers to the most
basic category of standard, young table wines.
The following are terms to look for if you want to taste Spain’s best table
wines (note, however, that some modern winemakers are moving away
from these designations to allow themselves greater aging flexibility).
They’re generally used with red wines, and all indicate wood-matured
(predominantly red) wines that have spent from one to five years aging
in barricas (oak casks) and bottles:
 A crianza is the youngest of wood-matured wines; it has spent at
least one year in a cask and several months in a bottle aging and
can’t be sold until its third year.
 Reservas wines are so designated from a particularly good vintage
and spend at least three years aging, with at least one year in a
cask. Reservas aren’t released until the fourth year after harvest.
 Gran reservas, culled from vintage years judged to be outstanding,
spend at least two years in a cask and another three years in a
bottle; they aren’t released until six years after harvest. Cosecha
(which literally means “harvest”) is the term for vintage year.
For recommended vintages and specific wines to look for when dining
out in Spain (or shopping at Duty Free at the airport), see the yellow
“tear-out” charts at the beginning of this book.
You’ve probably had sangria, and many tourists who go to Spain sit down
to a fruity pitcher of it at nearly every stop. But most sangria is a tourist
concoction, little more than wine-based Kool-Aid. Many restaurant owners
Part I: Introducing Spain

The coffee buzz
Spaniards love coffee, and stopping for café is a several-times-a-day ritual. For the
most part, people stand or sit in a cafe to have a coffee rather than get it in a paper or
Styrofoam to-go cup. If you order un café in Spain, you get a small cup of rich, strong,
and delicious espresso. Un cortado is an espresso with a dash of creme. If you aren’t
an espresso drinker, ask for a café con leche (coffee with milk, which is half milk) or
a café americano (weaker coffee diluted with water). Because few Spaniards opt for
an americano, yes, they’re sort of making fun of gringos.

know foreigners want it, so they trot out their cheapest wine, dilute it, and
toss in a handful of thin orange slices. Voilà! Sangria. Maybe you’ll be
lucky, though, and enjoy splendid, fruity sangria that actually tastes like
wine at a small tavern or restaurant. However, I don’t recommend order-
ing it at one of those obviously touristy places with menus in six lan-
guages displayed on sandwich boards. You’re usually much better off
ordering an inexpensive bottle of tinto, blanco, or cava.
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo for Gringos
Until recently, Spaniards mostly studied French and spoke little English.
That all changed with the country’s 1986 introduction into the European
Union and with the increasing linguistic globalization brought on by
MTV, CNN, and the Internet. English is now the foreign language of
choice, and even if relatively few people older than 40 speak it fluently,
most young people have at least a basic grasp of English. And, of course,
major hotels have staff fluent in English and other languages.
However, Spain remains thankfully resistant to some elements of global
homogenization. Only in primarily tourist areas and in tourist restau-
rants is English flung around with impressive ease. Knowing (or remem-
bering from high school or college) some español can help you on your
trip. You can talk to more people and get clearer directions, and you may
not be quite as surprised when plates are set down in front of you.
If conjugating verbs is way beyond you and all you want is the ability 
to utter a few basic pleasantries and ask a few questions, you probably
won’t have too much trouble. The most important words and phrases to
learn are: por favor (pohr fah-vohr; please), gracias (grah-thyahs; thank
you), and ¿Habla inglés? (ah-blah een-glehs; Do you speak English?).
Never automatically assume that someone speaks your language. You
win big points by asking politely if she does.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 31
The art of the paseo: The stroll español
In towns small and large, Spaniards seem to be in constant motion, walking to and fro.
They don’t necessarily seem to be walking with particular purpose, however. Where
are they going? Often, nowhere in particular. They’re strolling. The stroll español — the
paseo — is a time-honored tradition, an inescapable component of Spanish social life.
There’s the lovers’ stroll, the family paseo, and the takin’-care-of-business stroll. Not
only good exercise, they’re also expressions of Spanish life at full tilt. The paseo is
usually timed around meals, coming before or after lunch or coinciding with prime
tapas hour at the end of the work day. People meet up with old friends, stop at a cafe,
have a drink and a few tapas, and move on. Join the paseo, or pull up at a sidewalk
cafe and watch Spanish life lazily roll on by.

32
In the ring: The raging bull
To many, if not most, Spaniards, bullfighting is an art — a cultural tradition suffused
with high drama and delicate choreography. Los toros (the bulls), as it’s called collo-
quially, is a time-honored ritual with all the solemnity of midnight Mass — anything
but a sport. I have attended a number of bullfights and had Spanish friends explain it
and heard them praise its virtues with great passion, but, much as I try to see the appeal,
it remains a tough sell — as it does for many foreigners. No matter how you spin it, I
can’t get past the fact that at its most basic level it celebrates the cruel slaughter of inno-
cent and magnificent creatures. Despite those who became fans of the sport — most
famously, Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles — most foreigners probably need
Spanish blood coursing through their veins to really appreciate the drama of life-and-
death struggle. Everyone else is more likely to see it only as a life-and-death struggle
for the bull.
Even though you’re unlikely to fully grasp and appreciate its complex nature, a 
corrida — bullfight — in Madrid, Seville, or Ronda remains a quintessential Spanish
experience and a sight to see once in your life (but not if you’re squeamish). While
Spanish opposition to the sport has grown, Spaniards still spend over $1 billion annu-
ally at bullfights, of which there are some 17,000 every year. The season runs from
March to October and is especially popular in Madrid and Andalusia (Seville and
Ronda are two of the best spots to see a corrida). The bullfight revels in pageantry,
bravery, and risking death for one’s art, which underlines the Spanish obsession with
mortality and a fascination with violence and blood. Practiced since the Middle Ages
and once unleashed in town squares, bullfighting, formerly on the wane, is again enjoy-
ing renewed popularity in Spain. Top matadores are national celebrities whose spot-
lights eclipse even matinee idols. The current king of Spanish cinema, Pedro
Almodóvar, has prominently featured bullfighters in at least two of his films, even call-
ing one of them Matador.
Each bullfight has three basic chapters.
 In the first, the matador appraises his opponent and entices the fighting bull with
a large pink cape. Picadores (horsemen) use long lances to weaken the 1,000-
pound bull’s brute shoulders (so his head will drop and allow the matador to kill him
eventually).
 In the second stage, bandilleros (assistants on horseback) plunge colorful pairs
of darts into the bull, further weakening him for the matador. (You begin to grasp
what a “fair” fight this really is.)
 In the final stage, the matador, in his brilliant traje de luces (suit of lights, so named
for its vivid colors that seem to glow in the sun), orchestrates showy passes at
the bull with his muleta (red cape) while choruses of ¡olé! resound throughout the
ring. It’s all dramatic buildup to the kill — the moment of truth in which the mata-
dor plunges (in theory, precisely) his sword between the bull’s shoulders. If the
lance drives straight to the heart, the bull drops in a heap, dead.
Bullfights go through six bulls; a spectacular kill earns the matador the doomed bull’s
ear or tail. For more detailed information about bullfighting in Spain, visit www.mundo-
taurino.org.

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Spain 33
In regions such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, which have their
own indigenous languages that are used in preference to Castilian
Spanish, trying a few words of the native tongue is a very polite gesture —
though no one expects you to be able to speak it.
Speaking Spanish in Spain
Two features distinguish Iberian Spanish (the type of Spanish spoken in
Spain) from Latin American Spanish. One is the lisp-heavy pronunciation
of the letters c and z. Thus, in Spain, cerveza (beer) is pronounced
thehr-beh-thah. And the second is that the native population uses the
third-person vosotros (you) form, rather than the ustedes form common
throughout Latin America. So in Spain, “What are you doing?” becomes
“¿Qué hacéis?” (keh ah-thays) rather than “¿Qué hacen?” (keh ah-thehn).
Beyond these minor differences, Spanish is one of the rare languages
that’s perfectly phonetic, so don’t worry about lisping and give it your
best shot. Spaniards aren’t at all like the notoriously snooty French
(okay, Parisians), who sometimes look down on foreigners mangling
their language. Locals amply appreciate any effort to speak Spanish, and
you’ll receive a warm response. Check out the handy Cheat Sheet in the
front of this book for some more phrases and important menu terms.
Also, check out Spanish For Dummies, by Susana Wald (Wiley), if you’re
interested in broadening your foreign-language abilities.
Sounding like a Spaniard
Spaniards are wonderfully expressive. Their voices are deep — most
Spanish women sound as though they’re speaking straight from the ster-
num. If you know some Spanish, and especially if you know the kind they
never taught you in high school, you’ll marvel at how widely everyone
swears. A foreigner prone to parroting the locals can run into difficulties.
Don’t repeat anyone unless you know what he or she is saying — and
you mean to say the same.
A couple of key, indigenous phrases will give you a head start on under-
standing the locals. ¡Hombre! (ohm-breh; meaning “Man!”) is a common
exclamation with a zillion applications and intonations. You’ll see men
and women say it with great satisfaction when they cut into a great
steak, see an old friend, or when they don’t believe a word that the old
friend says. Vale (bah-leh) is uttered about as often as most people say,
“Um.” It means roughly, “Okay, yeah, right, I’ll do it, yep, okay, no prob-
lem, I said okay, all right?” Spaniards are capable of using vale about
eight times in a single sentence.

 Building your trip around special events, festivals, and holidays
Your options in this complex, delightfully varied, and scenically rich
country are virtually endless. And almost any kind of trip is possi-
ble: You can storm the Prado and every other art museum in a country
that has produced a disproportionate number of masters, including
Velázquez, El Greco, Goya, Picasso, and Dalí. Indulge in seafood paella (a
rice and seafood casserole) and red wines from Rioja. Attend a bullfight
or one of the many colorful festivals. Relive Spain’s past in great palaces,
castles, and cathedrals. Savor cosmopolitan cities or soak up small vil-
lages where time seems to stand still. Hit nightclubs where the action
doesn’t start until the wee hours and pulses until dawn. Or bask in the
beach culture that has made Spain a magnet for sun-starved northern
Europeans. One of the hardest things about planning a trip to Spain is
that it offers so much variety and so many possibilities. But I’m here to
help you figure it all out.
In this chapter, I review the different regions of Spain and cover the best
times to enjoy Spain’s great weather and the special festivals that you may
want to be a part of, such as Semana Santa (Easter) or the San Fermín (the
Running of the Bulls). And, if you prefer traveling off-season to avoid
crowds and high prices, I have you covered there, too.
Going Where You Want to Go
A first-time traveler to Spain could be forgiven for believing the stereo-
type: that all of Spain is sunny and hot; dotted with castles, cathedrals,
and windmills; overwhelmingly flat; and lined with long beaches. But, in
fact, Spain is one of Western Europe’s most diverse nations, with wildly
distinct regions, cultures, cuisines, and even languages. Spanish is obvi-
ously the national language, but the locals in three regions of the country

speak a primary language — Catalan, Euskera (Basque), and Gallego — in
addition to Spanish (castellano, or Castilian Spanish).
Of course, much of Spain is as advertised: hot and sunny, flat, and lined
with sparkling beaches. However, visitors can just as easily see a Spain
that is quite the opposite: one of rich green mountains, winding rivers,
and misty skies. The good news is that no matter where you are in the
country, a dramatically different region is usually just a short flight away.
Which Spain do you want to visit? Many visitors, whether on their first
trip or fifth, find it better to concentrate on a single region and see some
of the diversity within it. Others have more wanderlust and time and
want to experience two or more regions of Spain. Either way, you’re in
for a treat.
When planning a trip to a big country, you not only choose where to go,
but you also choose where not to go. So that you can start narrowing
down your own choices, the sections below break down Spain’s regions,
following the order in which I discuss them in greater detail in later
chapters. To see where these regions are located in the country, refer to
the “Spain” map in this chapter.
Northeastern Spain: Barcelona, the Costa 
Brava, and the Basque Country
The region of Catalonia may not be familiar to you, but I’m sure Barcelona
is. The site of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, Barcelona (bar-theh-
loh-nah) is a 2,000-year-old city that was founded by the Romans. It’s a
thoroughly modern place with rich architectural and artistic legacies,
including those of Antoni Gaudí, Pablo Picasso, and Joan Mirò. Barcelona
is the capital of Catalonia, a region of 6 million people whose first lan-
guage is Catalan (though almost everybody also speaks Spanish, even if it
takes a little prodding). Catalonia (Catalunya in Catalan) is Spain’s most
prosperous region, and many fiercely independent Catalans choose to
think of their homeland as a separate nation within Spain. It borders
France in the north and traces the long Mediterranean coastline, including
the rocky Costa Brava north of Barcelona. Catalonia’s interior is a largely
agricultural region of beautiful, fertile plains and small medieval villages. It
seems sedate and pastoral, until you realize that this region gave birth to
Salvador Dalí’s surreal genius.
An independent streak doesn’t come any stronger than in the unique
País Vasco (pah-ees bahs-koh; the Basque Country), which begins just
west of the French border and the Pyrenees, hugging the northern coast-
line and inhabiting the remote interior above the River Ebro. (For sim-
plicity’s sake, I lump Navarra in with the Basque Country, though strictly
speaking it’s no longer Basque. My apologies to geographical purists.)
The Basque Country is primarily agricultural, hilly, and full of emerald
meadows, quiet villages, and rustic farmhouses.

Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

Spain’s sixth-largest city, Bilbao, was, for most of the 20th century, a
grimy industrial metropolis. That all changed with the arrival of Frank
Gehry’s stunning Guggenheim Museum, which has suddenly trans-
formed the city into one of Spain’s top tourist attractions. San Sebastián
(called Donostia in Basque) is a splendid summer resort and one of
Spain’s prettiest cities, with serene beaches framing a perfect shell-
shaped bay. It’s also Spain’s acclaimed dining capital.
Navarra (sometimes spelled Navarre in English) is an ancient region that
was once an independent kingdom. People in some parts of the province
still speak the Basque language. Navarra is a mountainous region, domi-
nated by the Pyrenees, and, like most of the north, is agricultural. The
capital, Pamplona, is a conservative place that rockets to life once a
year, during its famous summer festival, San Fermín — the Running of
the Bulls. You can drink especially well in Navarra; besides its own reds
and rosés, the famous red-wine region, La Rioja, is just a few kilometers
southwest.
The main attractions in this region are
 Barcelona’s medieval Gothic Quarter, mind-altering early-20th-
century architecture (including Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia), and
sparkling urban beaches.
 Barcelona’s dynamic restaurant and bar scene.
 Girona, a quiet medieval city on a hill with a Jewish past, ancient
Empordà villages, and the Dalí Triangle — three towns touched by
surreal Salvador.
 The beaches, piney coves, and icy blue waters of the Costa Brava.
 Bilbao’s mind-blowing Guggenheim Museum, universally acclaimed
as one of the standout buildings of the 20thcentury.
 San Sebastián, a leisurely small city perched on a perfect bay —
with Spain’s greatest concentration of haute cuisine restaurants.
 Pamplona, a reserved city where hysteria reigns once a year when
one-ton bulls rule the streets.
 Basque cuisine — Spain’s most sophisticated and inventive. In
other places, eating is a complementary activity; in the Basque
Country, everything else takes a back seat.
But keep in mind . . .
 Barcelona is especially popular now with tourists, and its hotels
and restaurants do a good job helping you part with your euros.
 In the verdant Basque Country, rain often rules the day. If you only
get mist while in the area, it’s the equivalent of brilliant sunshine
anywhere else.
Part I: Introducing Spain 
38

 Pamplona, during the Running of the Bulls, is an expensive night-
mare if you don’t have reservations, and though the festival is a
blast, it’s also a messy, raucous, and smelly affair.
Central Spain: Madrid and Castile
When most people think of Spain, they probably picture the central and
southern parts of the country. The flat, arid plains of Central Spain are
punctuated by dozens of castles and palaces marking ancient kingdoms
and conflicts.
Madrid is the largest city in Spain. In addition to occupying the geo-
graphic middle, Madrid is the core of the Spanish cultural world: It
claims several of the finest art museums in Europe, with the world-
famous Prado leading the way.
The previous Spanish capital was Toledo, just south of Madrid. Toledo’s
fascinating juxtaposition of Arab, Christian, and Jewish cultures has
made it one of Spain’s top draws for decades. Toledo, along with Segovia
and Salamanca, are the top day trips (or better yet, “couple-of-days”
trips) from Madrid. Their proximity to the capital makes it extremely
easy to design a Central Spain visit.
The main attractions in this region are
 Madrid and its many parts: Viejo Madrid (Old Madrid), Habsburg
Madrid, and Bourbon Madrid. Across the board, the capital is
lively, full of world-class art, and the most frenetically paced
nightlife scene in Spain.
 Right on the outskirts of town: the somber — but still eye-popping —
palace El Escorial and Aranjuez, the regal garden retreat of royals.
 Segovia, a town molded like a medieval dreamscape, with a 2,000-
year-old Roman aqueduct and a picture-book castle on a hill.
 Salamanca, one of Spain’s most architecturally inviting cities — a
classic university town, much the same as Oxford in England.
 Toledo, the labyrinthine city on a hill where the artist El Greco
thrived, as well as Romans, Visigoths, Christians, Jews, and Moors.
But keep in mind . . .
 An arid, flat plain like the meseta is unforgivably hot in summer and
brutally cold in winter.
 Much of Central Spain, especially Toledo, is a tourist magnet; it’s
tough to visit the cities of Old and New Castile and not get tram-
pled by boisterous bus groups.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 39

Southern Spain: Andalusia
Andalusia, or Andalucía (ahn-dah-loo-thee-ah), is the sultry, passionate
Spain touted on posters: flamenco-dancing gypsies, bloody bullfights,
blistering sun, and scorching señoritas. Clumps of olive groves sprawl
across unending acres of khaki-colored earth, producing golden extra-
virgin olive oil for much of the world.
Andalusia (called al-Andalus by the Arabs who once inhabited this region)
is the part of Spain that the Moors influenced most distinctly. They ruled
Spain for seven centuries, and their dominance and sophistication are evi-
dent in the alluring Alhambra palace in Granada, the magnificent Great
Mosque in Córdoba, and the arresting Alcázar, or palace-fortress, in
Seville. The south of Spain is also home to some of the country’s most
colorful and traditional local festivals, such as Semana Santa (Holy Week)
and the Feria de Abril (April Fair) in Seville. You also see a distinctive
Moorish presence in the white villages, or pueblos blancos, perched in the
Andalusian Mountains.
Spain’s southern coast is an international playground for the rich, famous,
and often tacky. The glitzy Costa del Sol has been Spain’s jet-setting beach
getaway for decades, but you can find better, less crowded, and less
expensive beaches — on the Costa de la Luz, for example.
The main attractions in this region are
 Seville, Córdoba, and Granada — the three pillars of Moorish
Andalusia — and their great monuments: Seville’s cathedral, the
world’s largest Gothic building; the awe-inspiring Great Mosque in
Córdoba; and Granada’s Alhambra, a miracle palace of light and
legend.
 Andalusia’s famous spring festivals: Seville’s Holy Week and April
Fair, Cordoba’s decorated patios and May Festivals, and the pil-
grimage to Rocío.
 The delicious art of the tapas crawl, invented by Andalusians, who
still practice it with unequaled flair (see Chapter 1).
 The pueblos blancos, medieval whitewashed villages perched on
the peaks of the southern mountain ranges.
 The leisurely, hedonistic south: Andalusia’s famed coasts.
But keep in mind . . .
 In summer (and to a lesser extent year-round), few places on earth
are hotter.
 Those great spring festivals draw crowds from around the world
and push prices through the roof.
 To see much of the south, you have little choice but to rent a car.

Scheduling Your Time
If you’ve never been to Spain and think of it as a smallish European
country, you may believe that you can cover Barcelona, the Basque
Country, Madrid, the castles of Castile, and all of Andalusia in a couple
of weeks. Although doing so is theoretically possible (and easier than
ever with faster trains and cheaper flights), you’d have to endure a light-
ning-fast tour across Spain, and quantity rarely equals quality when
you’re traveling.
Many travelers today instead focus on one particular region, concentrat-
ing on the big and small attractions of that area and (I think) getting a
better overall flavor of the country. I encourage you to do that as well,
and not get too manic about seeing everything. The hassles of trans-
portation can eat into your vacation; if you spend more time getting to
places than experiencing them after you’re there, you may return from
your trip feeling that you need a vacation to recover from the one you
just had. Especially if you think you may return to Spain some day, I
advise that you plan a regional-based trip.
Because you can get a huge dose of Spanish flavor in any region, I always
tell friends to start with a list of what they absolutely must see or experi-
ence, and then build an itinerary around that. If you’re a certified art
head and you can’t step foot in Spain without seeing the great Spanish
masters at the Prado, plan a couple of days in Madrid and then decide
on day trips to Castile or a visit to southern Spain. If you’re dying to see
Barcelona’s famed moderniste architecture, focus on the Catalan capital
and add the Costa Brava, perhaps. Food junkies may want to take a seat
at the splendid tables of San Sebastián and Bilbao and then walk it off
touring northern Spain.
Spain is fairly easy to get around, whether by public transportation or
rental car — though distances can be significant, and you have to factor
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 41
Dealing with the daily tourist grind
When planning your trip, be sure to build some time into your schedule to get into the
rhythm of Spanish life. Taking time to relax and absorb your stay in Spain — listening
to the exuberant Castilian Spanish all around you, checking out the fashions, and so
on — is, for most people, more important than seeing that one last cathedral or
museum.
The easiest way to dive into the culture is to get off your feet and plunk yourself down
at an outdoor cafe. Cafes are a Spanish institution and a daily ritual for most Spaniards.
Not only can you reflect on what you’ve seen so far, but you can also watch Spanish
life all around you. In smaller towns, take time to stroll the central promenade — also
a time-honored element of Spanish life — and hit the local tapas joints.

in travel time. You can’t just zip effortlessly from Barcelona to Madrid to
Seville to Bilbao unless you fly. Some Spanish trains still aren’t up to par
with those in northern Europe, but between major destinations the
trains are generally excellent. The best of the lot is the fantastic high-
speed rail (abbreviated in Spanish as AVE) between Madrid and Córdoba
and Seville in Andalusia. Unfortunately, the long-awaited high-speed line
between Barcelona and Madrid still isn’t a reality; trains between these
two cities are pretty slow, and the best option is to fly.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Almost any time of year is the right time to go to Spain, which has some
of the best year-round weather in Europe. Though Spain is renowned
and revered for its sun, avoid some sunny areas in the deadly hot
summer. Fortunately, no matter when you go, you can find a part of
Spain tailor-made for the time of year you’re visiting.
Even in winter you can find the warmth of the Spanish sun. Spring and
fall are overall the most pleasant seasons, when you can enjoy festivals,
fewer crowds than in summer, and a respite from scorching summer
heat. If you visit Spain in summer, you may want to do as Spaniards
themselves do and head north.
Spring
Spring (especially late spring, from mid-April to mid-May) is ideal for
Central Spain, Andalusia, the Mediterranean coast, and the Balearic
Islands. The sun hasn’t cranked up to its full potential yet (many regions
only get up to between 15°C and 25°C (60°F–75°F), flowers are in daz-
zling bloom, and Spaniards, who love to be outside, fill sidewalk cafes. 
In addition, some of the best festivals take place in spring.
But keep in mind that the north can be pretty rainy, and the spring festi-
vals in Andalusia put hotel accommodations at a premium.
Summer
Summer is an excellent time to hit northern “green” Spain, which is usu-
ally rainy in winter and spring. From the Basque Country to Galicia, the
temperatures are the peninsula’s coolest, averaging around 21°C (70°F).
Keep the heat and crowds in mind, however. Madrid and Andalusia are
extremely hot and dry, like an overheated brick oven. Temperatures rou-
tinely soar to the near 38°C (100°F) or worse. Barcelona’s pretty humid,
so even though temperatures may only be around 29°C (85°F), you can
feel sticky and uncomfortable. During summer, Europeans pour into
Spain, especially the coastal regions. In August, 90 percent of Spaniards
are on vacation, so much of the country (inland, at least) closes up for
the month. During the last week of July and first week of August, highways
Part I: Introducing Spain 
42

crisscrossing Spain clog with expatriate Moroccans returning home from
northern Europe for the summer holidays.
Fall
Fall may be the best time to visit Spain as a whole, with sunny days, clear
skies, comfortable temperatures, and fewer crowds than in summer.
Temperatures range from lows of 4°C (40°F) to highs in the low to mid-
20s (mid-70s or low 80s) in the south.
Although fall offers great weather for traveling, the Atlantic coast gets 
a good bit of rain, and the summer heat may still linger in central and
southern Spain.
Winter
Winter is a good time to travel to the southern Mediterranean and the
mountains in both the north and south for snow sports. Crowds are non-
existent, and prices drop for hotels and airfares.
But consider that some coastal resorts, especially on the Costa Brava,
virtually shut down during this slow season. And in Central Spain, where
extremes rule, winter can be as cold (with temperatures dipping into the
single digits Celsius/30s Fahrenheit) as summer is hot.
Getting a handle on crowds and prices
Spain is one of the world’s top tourist destinations; it gets more visitors
every year than it has citizens. During much of the year, parts of Spain
are quite crowded with tourists and expensive. You can find the best
bargains during the shoulder seasons (late fall and early spring) and off-
seasons. Prices are lower at hotels, and getting a reservation and doing
just about everything else — going to a restaurant, visiting a museum or
cathedral, traveling by train or on the highway, and so on — is much
less difficult. The shoulder seasons are cheaper than summer (if not
rock-bottom).
Prices in Spain are usually lowest in November through February and
highest in July and August. If a bargain trip is high on your list, keep this
pricing information in mind when making your reservation.
Besides July and August, prices are also highest during Easter week.
Avoid these times if you don’t want rushes of Spanish and European
tourists sweeping you away. Traditionally, Europeans, en masse, take 
off the month of August and try to beat each other to the beaches (as it
happens, they end up clogging highways leading to the beaches and
then squeezing in next to each other on the sand). Most Europeans don’t
yet have the vacation flexibility that many North Americans enjoy (that
said, though, most Europeans get a full month or more of vacation!). So
take advantage of your greater flexibility if you can visit Spain in fall,
winter, or early spring.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 43

Knowing when not to go
You’ve probably already figured out that Spain in August can be miser-
able. The sun bakes the heck out of everything in sight, major cities
become ghost towns as wise Spaniards flee to the coasts, and the most
desirable places where water or cooler temperatures are within reach
are packed with Spanish and European tourists. If you’re not on the
coast, you may find the short hours and closings frustrating, and few
restaurants are even open.
Christmas and Easter holidays can be great times to visit Spain as long
as you know what you’re getting into: religious holidays, during which 
a number of museums and businesses are closed for business. But 
that’s the trade-off to see Spain at its religious and folkloric best. Many
Spaniards have the entire Holy Week (Easter) off, so coasts and popular
Easter cities such as Seville and Málaga fill up not only with Spaniards
but also with people from the rest of the planet.
Prices follow the law of supply and demand and go through the roof when
everybody wants to visit a particular place. That’s April and May, during
the celebrated festivals of Seville and Córdoba, and summer (July and
August) in the Balearics, Northern Spain, and along the Mediterranean
coasts. If you don’t want to run with the bulls or watch other people per-
form that original extreme sport, stay away from Pamplona in early July
(July 6–14).
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Spain’s special fiestas are what make it unique. No other European coun-
try has maintained the variety of vibrant expressions of culture and
color like Spain has. However, if you want to plan your vacation around
them, keep in mind two important words: Plan ahead. Several of the fes-
tivals are extremely popular with national as well as international travel-
ers, and unless you’re partial to sleeping on the street, they require
reservations way in advance.
Every city and town in Spain also celebrates a patron saint’s feast day.
These days are impossible to keep track of, so understand that you may
arrive in a place and discover that it’s a holiday, even though I don’t list
it with the rest of Spain’s major holidays in the “Spain’s national holi-
days” box in this chapter. Having some cash on you at all times is a good
idea in case banks are closed. For a more comprehensive list of the
patron saints’ feast days, consult the Web site for the Spain Institute 
of Tourism, www.tourspain.es.
Note that with most of these events, exact dates change from year to
year, according to the calendar. Therefore, confirm the dates with the
National Tourist Office of Spain (see the Appendix) if you want to make
sure that you’re in town for a specific event.

January
Spain has traditionally celebrated the gift-giving of Christmas on Día de
los Reyes (Three Kings Day), although Santa Claus, also known as Papá
Noel, is starting to visit Spanish kids. In most cities, elaborately dressed
kings and their entourages parade through the city. January 6.
February/March
Cádiz’s Carnaval — Spain’s best and most flamboyant carnival celebra-
tion — is also the oldest. It’s the closest Spain comes to Venice or Rio at
carnival time, but with a flavor all its own. Get more information online
at www.cadiznet.com/carnaval and www.andalucia.com/festival/
carnival-cadiz.htm. Late February or early March, depending on the
dates of Easter.
April
Spain’s most revered religious celebration is Easter, and nobody cele-
brates it like the residents of Seville. Dead-serious processions run
round the clock during Semana Santa (Holy Week), from Palm Sunday
until Easter Sunday. Brotherhoods of men carry pasos (floats) of Christ
or one of the pantheons of traditionally honored Virgenes (Virgins) and
shuffle through the streets to the eerie wail of the saeta, a religious
funeral hymn. Make hotel reservations three months to a year in
advance. To find out this year’s dates for Semana Santa, visit the Web
sites www.andalucia.org and www.sevilla.org. Mid-April.
Sevillanos pull out all the stops for Feria de Abril (April Fair), which fol-
lows the solemn Easter celebrations. Women dazzle in brightly colored,
polka-dotted flamenco dresses; men play the part of country caballeros
(gentlemen). Coaches are decked out with so many flowers they look
like floats in the Rose Bowl parade, and the streets rock with all-night 
flamenco dancing, bullfights, and horseback riding. Feria de Abril fills
Seville to the rafters. For more information visit the Web sites www.
andalucia.org and www.sevilla.org. Third week of April.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 45
Spain’s national holidays
National holidays celebrated in Spain include January 1 (New Year’s Day), January 6
(Feast of the Epiphany), March 19 (Feast of St. Joseph), Good Friday, Easter Monday,
May 1 (May Day), June 10 (Corpus Christi), June 29 (Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul),
July 25 (Feast of St. James), August 15 (Feast of the Assumption), October 12 (Spain’s
National Day), November 1 (All Saints’ Day), December 8 (Immaculate Conception),
and December 25 (Christmas).

May
Cordobeses, known for the beauty of their whitewashed patios and
courtyards, go all out every May during Festival de los Patios (Patio
Festival), daring their neighbors to better their flower-bedecked dis-
plays. For more information, visit the Web site www.andalucia.org.
First two weeks in May.
San Isidro is the patron saint of Madrid, and locals throw a ten-day cele-
bration to honor him during Fiesta de San Isidro. You can enjoy daily
bullfights at Las Ventas, food fairs, folklore, parades, parties, concerts,
and plenty of food and drink. Make hotel reservations early. For more

You must see Romería del Rocío (Pilgrimage of the Virgin of the Dew;
also called simply El Rocío), Spain’s most famous religious procession, to
believe it. A million people go south to see a large group of men carry the
statue of the Virgin 16km (10 miles) to Almonte, through the marshes of
Coto Doñana, for consecration. Massive crowds do their best to touch
the Virgin and feel her healing power. For more information, visit the Web
site www.andalucia.com/festival/rocio.htm. Mid- to late May.
June
For 50 years, Granada has put on the International Music and Dance
Festival, a notable program of dance and music at incredible venues: the
Alhambra and Generalife palaces, among others. This festival is a great
way to see those places enlivened by top-notch talent. Reserve at least a
couple of months in advance. Visit the Web site, www.granadafestival.
org, for more information, tickets, and reservations. June 21 through
July 7.
Vino becomes ammo during the Battle of Wine Festival in Haro (La
Rioja) as people douse each other with 70,000 liters of red wine — then
they stumble around a lot. For more information, visit www.haro.org/
ingles/turismo.htm. June 29.
July
Spanish classical and flamenco guitar fuels the rhythms of everyday life in
Andalusia, and Córdoba gets some of the finest national and international
guitar heroes to town for its Festival de la Guitarra (Guitar Festival), a
series of concerts. For more information, visit www.guitarracordoba.
com. First two weeks of July.
Popularized by Hemingway, the Fiesta de San Fermín (Running of the
Bulls) involves massive beasts racing through the streets of Pamplona,
while joyful and crazy humans try to outrun them. People who choose
not to run get swept up in the revelry just the same. Reserve months or,
at some hotels, years in advance. For more information visit www.san
fermin.com. July 6 through 14.

Spain’s oldest and most prestigious jazz party, Jazzaldia, the San
Sebastián Jazz Festival, unites some of the international biggies for
smooth jazz and soulful bebop every July. Enjoy big-ticket shows
(Wynton Marsalis and Pat Metheny were recent performers), as well 
as some freebies. Visit www.jazzaldia.com for more information. Last
two weeks in July.
September
The site of Spain’s oldest bullfighting arena and the home of a legendary
matador, Ronda dips back in time every September for Feria de Pedro
Romero (Pedro Romero Fair). Its corrida goyesca re-creates the atmos-
phere of an 18th-century bullfight from the era of Spain’s great painter,
Francisco Goya. Men and women decked out in fancy dress ride through
the streets on horse carriages, and bullfighting aficionados come from
all over the world to see classical exhibitions. For more information,
visit www.turismoderonda.es. First week of September.
The International Film Festival, Spain’s top film festival, shakes up 
the beautiful resort city of San Sebastián. You can find nearly as many
screenings and stars here as at the Cannes Film Festival in France. For
more information, visit www.sansebastianfestival.com. Second half
of September (dates vary).
Head to Logroño (and throughout La Rioja) for the Fiestas de la Vendimia
Riojana (Wine Harvest Festival) to celebrate the great grape with danc-
ing, bullfighting, music, and parades. Oh yeah, and drinking, too. For infor-
mation, visit www.larioja.org/turismo. Third week of September.
During La Mercé Barcelona rolls out the cabezudos — big papier mâché
heads — that roam the streets, fascinating (or frightening) kids and hon-
oring Our Lady of Mercy. For more information, visit www.barcelona

October/November
Spanish and international artists participate in Madrid’s Festival de
Otoño (Autumn Festival), a program of opera, ballet, dance, music, and
theater. Make hotel reservations early; information about schedules and
tickets is at www.madrid.org/clas_artes/fo06/index.html. Late
October to late November.
December
Noche Vieja (New Year’s Eve) revelers throughout Spain stuff grapes
into their mouths, one at the sound of each of 12 chimes at midnight, to
ring in the New Year. In Madrid, people crowd into the Puerta del Sol
plaza and cheer on the clock tower. December 31.

se the information in this section to get down to the
nitty-gritty and start planning. To have a successful
trip, you need all the facts at hand so you can tackle issues
such as planning your budget, handling money, and deciding
on (or against) package tours. The biggest questions you
probably have at this point, though, are the following: What’s
the best way to get to Spain? How do I get around after I’ve
landed? And where the heck am I going to stay?
In addition to addressing those questions, I offer some sug-
gestions for keeping costs down and provide speciﬁc advice
for families, seniors, gays and lesbians, and other travelers
with individual needs. This section lays the best resources on
the line (including many that are online). I also explain pre-
liminary matters you need to consider, such as passports and
visas, Customs, travel insurance, staying connected by cell-
phone and e-mail, and airline security.

 Looking out for hidden expenses
 Keeping costs down
 Checking out sample budgets for one- and two-week tours
 Finding out what things cost in Spain
You’re probably at least curious — if not yet clutching a calculator —
to know approximately how much a vacation to Spain will set 
you back. Of course, that amount depends on what kind of trip you’re
taking — an anniversary or honeymoon blowout, or a more economical
taste-of-Spain trip. Although Spain was once the European destination of
choice for budget-minded travelers, that’s no longer the case. And the
euro has risen to an uncomfortable exchange rate against the dollar, so
now more than ever before, budgeting accurately for a trip to Spain is
important.
Although Spain isn’t the bargain it once was, on the whole it remains rel-
atively affordable compared with other popular destinations such as
England, France, Germany, and Italy. You may find that some items in
Spain are cheaper than they are in your home country. Dining out can be
a remarkably good value, with excellent wines — thought of as a staple
and thus not overtaxed in restaurants — surprisingly accessible. Renting
a car isn’t cheap, and, as in all of Europe, gas is very expensive, but
public transportation is a good deal. And many smaller inns and hotels
are affordably priced. Not surprisingly, the big cities (especially Madrid
and Barcelona), nicer hotels, and top-tier restaurants are still expensive
(though cheaper than in many other parts of Europe).
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting a trip to Spain depends on where you go, how long you plan
to stay, and what you plan to do while you’re there. Your major expendi-
tures are airfare and accommodations. You can find reasonably priced
dining, but if you want to sample the best in big cities, expect to pay for
the privilege. Where and when you go greatly affects your budget. A
room in Barcelona or Madrid costs a lot more than a room in a smaller

city; and accommodations in Pamplona during the Running of the Bulls,
or in Seville during Easter or April Fair, cost considerably more than
during the shoulder or off-seasons. This same principle of expecting to
pay more in cities also applies to all other expenses (meals and so on).
Table 4-1 gives you a sampling of what things cost in a large Spanish city.
(Smaller cities and towns are less expensive, especially for hotels and
restaurants.) Check out Table 4-2 for a sampling of transportation costs,
along with other common travel-related expenses.

Transportation
Airfare is one of your biggest expenses, even after you apply all the cost-
cutting tips that I give you later in this chapter. Airfares fluctuate year-
round, with airlines offering special deals during low travel season and
hiking up prices for holidays. Of course, fares vary widely depending on
your point of origin and your destination. For example, from the New
York area, with the shorter distance to Europe and the greater frequency
of flights, you may pay anywhere from $700 to $1,000 for a round-trip
coach ticket to Madrid or Barcelona. Prices from the rest of the United
States are usually at the upper end of that range, or even slightly higher.
If you’re flying from London, you’re in especially good luck, because you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
52

can take advantage of plenty of special flight deals and charters. If you’re
flying from another country, check out Chapter 5 for airline information.
Most transportation costs on the ground are reasonable — even surpris-
ingly affordable — in Spain. Within major cities (such as Barcelona,
Bilbao, and Madrid), the metro, or subway, is efficient and a great deal,
especially if you purchase a multitrip ticket. Buses are just as affordable,
and even taxis won’t bust too many budgets (most in-town trips cost
less than 8€/$9.60).
As for transportation in a specific region or around Spain, your primary
choices are air, rail, or rental car (though particularly in the Basque
Country in the north, buses are a better bet, because the highways are
superb and the buses much faster than trains). Unless you’re in a real
hurry, or you need to cover a lot of ground (say, Barcelona to Seville or
Madrid to Bilbao), you probably don’t need to fly. Flights within Spain
aren’t overly expensive; the Barcelona-Madrid shuttle flight — once pro-
hibitively costly — is now very affordable (around 100€/$120, though
certain flights are as low as 50€/$60) and a worthwhile alternative to the
slower trains and buses. As a whole, Spanish trains are punctual and
attractively priced.
The most costly option is renting a car. At 40€ ($48) and up per day,
only consider renting under certain circumstances; a rental is great for
traveling in areas where good public transportation options don’t exist,
where you need to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time, or
where the flexibility of your own car really adds to the trip (the pueblos
blancos in Andalusia is a good example). In each region’s chapter, I dis-
cuss whether a rental car is a good idea.
Petrol (gasoline) is one of the major expenses in European countries, and
this holds true in Spain. At this writing, unleaded gasoline (sin plomo)
costs .94€ per liter, or about $4.25 per gallon — although very expensive
by North American standards, believe it or not Spain has one of the
cheapest prices in Europe for gas! Diesel is cheaper, at .91€ per liter
(about $4.15 a gallon). One U.S. gallon equals 3.79 liters. (For the latest
costs, consult www.aaroadwatch.ie/eupetrolprices.) Though not
low-priced in Spain, renting a car isn’t quite as costly as it is in many
other European countries.

Lodging
Unless you book a package that combines the costs of airfare and
accommodations (see Chapter 5 for details), lodging vies with (or may
exceed) the cost of flying. You can find a budget hotel for about 50€
($60) a night, though in some popular destinations, such as Barcelona or
Seville, finding a good and clean place for that price is becoming increas-
ingly tough. An economy hotel runs 50€ ($60) to 100€ ($120) per night
for a double room. A moderately priced hotel costs from 100€ ($120)
and 195€ ($234). Expensive hotels run 195€ ($234) and up to 300€
($360). For the most part, only the famous palacelike hotels and ultra-
luxe designer hotels in Spain (such as Hotel Arts in Barcelona, the Ritz 
in Madrid, and Alfonso XIII in Seville; see Chapters 10, 13, and 15) cost
upwards of 300€ ($360) a night. Many hotels include buffet breakfast but
not the 7 percent IVA tax in their rates; make sure you inquire about
both items. (See “Taking Taxes into Account” later in this chapter for
more about the IVA.)
Dining
You can subsist on cheap tapas and fast food, or break the bank with
fancy, multicourse dinners at restaurants specializing in seafood or
Basque Country cuisine. Sensible tapas munching (heck, sometimes you
can put a small meal together with the free snacks you get with glasses
of wine and beer) and fixed-price menús del día (daily menus that are
usually available for lunch) can really keep down your costs. Indeed,
eating out in most of Spain is considerably less expensive than it is in
much of Europe. So what does an average Spanish dining experience
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
54

cost? A typical three-course dinner in a low-key neighborhood restau-
rant runs about 15€ to 30€ ($18–$36) a head. You can also find restau-
rants serving satisfying two- (or more) course meals for as little as 12€
to 15€ ($14–$18). Lunch is always cheaper than dinner, so follow the
Spaniards and eat a full lunch (when most sights are closed anyway) and
go light at dinner.
As a rule, Spaniards don’t eat much more than some toast or a croissant
and coffee for breakfast. Breakfast buffets at hotels usually aren’t included
in the cost of your room, and if you blindly stumble into the breakfast
room each morning, you may find that you’re tacking as much as 20€
($24) onto your daily lodging bill.
Sightseeing
Entry fees to museums and other sights aren’t too expensive in most
parts of Spain, but they can quickly add up, especially if you’re a
museum maniac. (Museum and monument admissions generally range
from 1€–8€, or $1.20–$9.60.) Make a list of must-dos to get a ballpark
figure of how much money to set aside for sightseeing. Many museums
offer free admission on certain days; when applicable, I list good deals
along with hours and admission costs in attraction listings throughout
this book.
Shopping
Shopping is the most elastic part of your budget, and the part most
dependent on your own tendencies, because you can buy nothing at all
or enough to fill a dozen suitcases. Spain isn’t exactly Mexico — a haven
for inexpensive crafts — and although the steady rise of the euro has
made things considerably more expensive, you may still well want to
bring home Spanish fashions, crafts, or ceramics. Steering clear of most
items you can buy at home is a good idea. Although the clerk won’t add
on a tax to your purchase price, you can rest assured that it’s built in. If
you live outside the European Union, you may be able to reclaim a
healthy portion of the 16 percent value-added sales tax (VAT, or IVA in
Spanish), but only if you meet certain requirements. (See “Taking Taxes
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 55
Is there no such thing as a free munch?
All tapas aren’t created equal. You can enjoy the free variety — small snacks that you
get to nibble along with a vinito (glass of wine) or cerveza (beer) — or the slightly
larger tapas and raciones (full portions) that you must pay for but that are inexpensive
(unless you order the king-sized prawns). However, beware of the place that sets down
a too-good-to-be-true salad or whopping plate of food next to your glass of wine. It
may be none-too-good to your wallet. Ask about any unsolicited food if you’re unsure
whether additional charges apply.

into Account” later in this chapter, for information on how to get your
IVA refunded.)
Your dollars may go further in Spain than you imagine, even with the
recent ascension of the euro, the European Union’s common currency.
(See “Handling Money” later in this chapter for more about the euro.)
Although Europe is now generally more expensive than the United
States, you may still find some good deals if you know where to look
(barring, of course, a major crash in the dollar or sudden surge of the
euro between the writing of this book and your trip).
In Spain, the law actually determines when sales take place, with twice-
annual sell-offs of inventory that all begin at the same time: the second
week of January and the last week of July (as you’ll find in much of
Europe). Signs announcing rebajas (sales) are plastered over store win-
dows. Prices continue to drop when stores move from first to second
(segundas rebajas) and, finally, to últimas rebajas (like the final clearance
sale).
Nightlife and entertainment
The price of your evening entertainment depends on your finances and
stamina level. See Table 4-2, earlier in this chapter, for a general idea of
what tickets and cover fees cost around town. Although beer and wine
are rather affordable, alcoholic drinks in nightclubs and special bars can
make even a New Yorker weep. If you’re planning on several late nights
out, budget big in order to paint the town rojo (red).
Keeping a lid on hidden expenses
Unless you plan for hidden costs, you’re likely to return from your trip
over budget. Among costs that you must consider are
 Additional rental car costs: Surcharges such as a 10€ ($12) airport
pickup; a value-added tax of 15 percent if you don’t prepay for the
car; and gasoline costs.
 Costs of communicating with folks back home: Either through
international phone calls or Internet cafes.
 Hotel taxes: Factor in an additional 7 percent of your total hotel 
bill — including goods and services.
 Tipping: Though it’s probably less here than you’re accustomed 
to back home (see “Tipping tips,” below), you’ll still want to factor
it in.
You can’t avoid some of these costs, of course, but keeping them in mind
can certainly inform the decisions you make on your trip to Spain.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
56

Tipping tips
Many Americans over-tip in Spain. The difference is most noticeable in a
Spanish restaurant, where a gratuity is officially figured into the bill — but
none of it goes to the server. In nice restaurants, adding about 10 percent
to the cost of the bill is customary. If you leave a 20 percent tip, you may
see your picture hanging on the wall the next time you come back. Don’t
tip bartenders for each round of drinks; leave a 1€ ($1.20) coin or two at
the end of the night to show your appreciation. Give 1€ ($1.20) per bag to
bellhops and doormen, and 1€ to 2€ ($1.20–$2.40) per night for a maid.
Pay a concierge who has gone out of her way to help you between 5€ and
10€ ($6–$12). Tipping taxi drivers isn’t necessary; just pay the meter, or 
at the most, round up (though a driver who is especially helpful should
receive about a 5 to 10 percent tip). Likewise, give ushers who help you to
your seat in a theater or bullring a few small coins.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
Throughout this book, Bargain Alert icons highlight money-saving tips
and/or great deals. Here are some additional cost-cutting strategies:
 Go off-season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (Oct–Mar, for
example), hotel prices and flights cost less than during peak
months — often saving you anywhere from 20 to 50 percent. Note
that major holidays and local festivals are the exceptions to the
cheaper off-season rules; on those occasions, you may see hotel
prices double.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
than if you put the trip together. (See Chapter 5 for more on pack-
age tours.)
 Reserve a room with a small refrigerator and coffeemaker. You
don’t have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs. Buying sup-
plies for breakfast can save you money — and probably calories.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-person
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 57

rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay 10€ or 15€ ($12–$18) extra for a rollaway bed, not
taking two rooms can save you hundreds.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of at dinner. Lunch is
the main meal in Spain, and lunch tabs are usually a fraction of what
dinner would cost at a top restaurant even though the menu often
boasts many of the same specialties. Plan to load up on midday
menus — lunchtime fixed-price meals are a Spanish classic — and
you can get a full meal for around 12€ to15€ ($14–$18). Also, order
house wine, or vino de la casa.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river, or
located in less-convenient areas are great bargains. Outlying motels
often have free parking, with lower rates than downtown hotels
offering amenities that you may never use. Sure, at a motel you’ll be
carrying your own bags, but the rooms are often just as comfort-
able and a whole lot cheaper. Big cities and resorts are, in general,
much more expensive than small towns and the Spanish country-
side. See Chapter 7 for more on hotels.
 Walk a lot. Spaniards love to stroll, so you’ll fit right in if you walk.
A good pair of walking shoes can save you money on taxis and
other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know your 
destination more intimately as you explore at a slower pace.
 Sit in the sol and not the sombra. At bullfights, the cheap seats
are in the sol, or sun. Sitting in the sombra (shade) costs more.
Similarly, if you’re going to see the inside of a hall more than to
hear a particular program, choose the nosebleed seats; they’re
often around 5€ ($6).
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories are the best
mementos of your trip; do without the endless T-shirts, key chains,
salt-and-pepper shakers, Mexican sombreros (why they sell those in
Spain, I don’t know), and other trinkets.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.

Making sense of the euro
The euro gives the European Union a single common currency, so cur-
rency-exchange headaches in member nations — including Spain — are
largely a thing of the past. You no longer have to worry about getting
your hands on pesetas. But even with currency exchange simplified, you
still need to think about some money matters before your trip. What’s
the best way to deal with money matters while you’re traveling in Spain?
With traveler’s checks? Using local ATMs to withdraw cash, just like at
home? Or whipping out plastic across the country? This section answers
your questions about dishing out your dough.
The common E.U. currency, introduced January 1, 2002, is the euro (in
Spain, it’s pronounced eh-oo-roh), abbreviated by the symbol €. Coins
come in eight denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 eurocents, and 1 and
2 euros. Bank notes are issued in seven denominations: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100,
200, and 500 euros.
The euro has held its strength against the U.S. dollar, and the rate of
exchange between the two at press time was 1.20:1 (meaning 1€ was
roughly equivalent to 83¢).
Look for information about the European Union’s common currency on
the Web at www.euro.ecb.int. For the latest exchange rates, log on to
CNN’s travel Web site, www.cnn.com/travel/currency, which features
a convenient conversion tool. Plug in any world currency against the
euro and instantly receive the current, official exchange.
Take some time at the beginning of your trip to familiarize yourself with
the euro. Bank notes differ in size and design. In color, the euro notes are
also distinct; the 5 is gray; the 10 is red; the 20 is blue; the 50 is orange;
the 100 is green; the 200 is yellow; and the 500 is purple. Architectural
features, from classical to modern, are represented on the bank notes,
which are the same across Europe. The front of each bill features land-
mark windows and gates, and the back features images of landmark
European bridges. Coins have one face common to all member coun-
tries; the images on the reverse sides are chosen and produced by indi-
vidual nations.
Exchanging money
You can exchange foreign currency for euros at all banks, open Monday
to Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. (except June–Sept, when they close
on Sat), as well as at casas de cambio (exchange bureaus) in the main
cities. Many hotels and travel agencies also exchange money. Banks
(including Banco de España, BBV, and Barclays), even those that charge
a 1 percent commission, almost always offer more advantageous rates.
When you can avoid exchanging money at casas de cambio and hotels,
do; their rates are much worse. Likewise, be careful of exchange houses
that advertise no commission; their rates are so low that you lose
money. Also, don’t exchange much money into euros before leaving for
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 59

your trip. The rates at home are considerably less advantageous than
those rates in Spain.
Using Spanish ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span
the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which network
you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM locations at your desti-
nation. Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN)
before you leave home and find out your daily withdrawal limit before
you depart.
ATMs are as ubiquitous in Spain as they are in the United States, Canada,
and other places. Look for signs advertising cajero automático or cajero
24 horas (24-hour ATM). As long as your bank card uses a four-digit PIN,
you can use your card at ATMs abroad to withdraw money directly from
your home bank account. Instead of withdrawing U.S. or Canadian dol-
lars or British pounds like you do on your home turf, you get euros. The
exchange rate is usually the best you can get; it’s calculated at the cur-
rent rate, and ATMs (and their affiliated banks) don’t usually charge a
commission.
Spanish ATMs only accept four-digit PIN codes. If your PIN is more than
four digits, make sure you change it before leaving, or you won’t be able
to withdraw money from any ATM on Spanish soil. Check with your bank
to see whether you need to reprogram your PIN code for usage in Spain.
Keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used
at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international
transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re
rarely more than $1.50). In addition, the bank from which you withdraw
cash may charge its own fee. Ask your bank for what its international
ATM fees are.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are invaluable when traveling; they’re a safe way to carry
money and provide a convenient record of all your travel expenses when
you arrive home. You can get cash advances from your credit card at
any bank, and you don’t even need to go to a teller; you can receive a
cash advance at the ATM if you know your PIN (in Spain, ATMs accept
only a four-digit PIN). If you’ve forgotten your PIN or didn’t know that
you had one, call the phone number on the back of your credit card and
ask the bank to send it to you. Receiving your PIN usually takes five to
seven business days, though some banks will give you the number over
the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or follow some
other security-clearance procedure.

A hidden expense to contend with when receiving a cash advance from
your credit card is that interest rates for cash advances are often signifi-
cantly higher than rates for credit card purchases. More importantly, you
start paying interest on the advance the moment you receive the cash.
Likewise, on an airline-affiliated credit card, a cash advance doesn’t earn
frequent-flier miles.
The most commonly accepted credit cards in Spain (in order of most
widely accepted to least widely accepted) are Visa, American Express,
Diner’s Club, and MasterCard (called Eurocard in Spain). Don’t bother
taking your Discover Card — it’s only good in the United States.
When you use your credit card abroad, the exchange rate you receive is
the rate that is in place when the charge actually goes through — as much
as a month after the fact. Therefore, you’re essentially functioning as a 
foreign-exchange trader, betting on an exchange rate. If you want to bet 
on the dollar (or pound, and so on) getting stronger against the euro, use
plastic. If you prefer the current exchange rate to a future one, use cash.
Don’t sweat this decision, though. Unless you’re purchasing Picassos, the
difference in exchange rates between when you make the purchase and
when your transaction goes through is likely to be negligible.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa or
MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on credit
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in things such as exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson is to carry more than one card with you
on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so having
a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
Although most Spanish hotels, restaurants, and shops accept traveler’s
checks, they are less necessary these days because most cities have 24-
hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed.
However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM with-
drawal fee if the bank isn’t your own, so if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided that
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 61

also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges from 1.5 to 2 percent;
checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. Call
% 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain Visa checks
without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378.
MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for a
location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
In Spain, the only thing you need to worry about tax-wise is something
called IVA (pronounced ee-bah) — Spanish for value-added tax (abbrevi-
ated VAT in English). IVA is a tax assessed on virtually everything you
purchase, from clothing to hotel rooms to meals.
Europe’s value-added tax is hefty — ranging from 6.5 to 25 percent,
depending on the item being taxed. The good news for nonresidents of
the European Union is that you can get back much of the tax heaped on
items you buy — with a few conditions. Spain’s IVA on most consumer
goods is 16 percent. Hotels and restaurants charge 7 percent IVA, but
you can’t get that money refunded. To get money back, you have to be
vigilant. Global Refund, a company that acts as a third-party agent for
IVA refunds, claims that Americans lose an estimated $50 million a year
in unclaimed refunds.
When shopping, look for the blue-and-gray TAX FREE SHOPPING or TAX FREE
FOR TOURISTS signs in the windows of stores. Such a sign means that the
store participates in the IVA Refund Program and, therefore, can provide
you with the necessary forms. The required paperwork — filled out at
each store and then signed and stamped by Customs officials at the air-
port on your way out of the country — can be a pain, though, so hold on
to all your receipts and forms. (Fortunately, personnel in many stores
accustomed to dealing with tourists are well-versed in IVA refund mat-
ters, and most can walk you through the steps.)
You’re only eligible for a refund if you spend a minimum of 90.15€ ($108)
in a single store (you can get multiple refunds as long as you spend that
minimum amount in each store). At the departing airport (or border
crossing), present the refund request forms at Customs and get them
stamped. Afterward, go to the “Cash Refund” office and show the receipt
for the purchase and, if requested, the actual items bought, and surren-
der the stamped tax-free slips and receipts. (You can also mail receipts
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
62

and slips from your home country; when you get the forms from each
store, an envelope is included for doing this.) At the Global Refund air-
port kiosk, show your stamped receipts, and Global Refund gives imme-
diate cash refunds in the local currency or in the currencies used for the
purchases. It can also issue a credit to a major credit card (your refund
amount is converted to your home currency). Global Refund claims a fee
of approximately 3 percent, and if you want your refund in dollars, you
must pay another fee. In the end, your refund is slightly less than the 16
percent VAT — 13.8 percent.
Be sure to leave a little extra time to complete the necessary bureaucratic
steps at the airport if you want a refund. For more information before you
go, consult the Global Refund Web page: www.globalrefund.com.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen. Most credit card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in Spain: American Express, % 917-43-70-00; Diners Club, 
% 902-40-11-12; MasterCard, % 900-97-12-31; Visa, % 900-99-11-24.
Odds are that if your wallet is gone, you’ve seen the last of it, and the
police aren’t likely to recover it for you. However, after you realize that
it’s gone and you cancel your credit cards, call to inform the police —
either the Policía Municipal (municipal police) or Policía Nacional
(national police). Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when banks and American
Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you via Western
Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; the airline personnel may allow you to
board the plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate
and a copy of the police report you’ve filed.

G
etting there is supposed to be half the fun, so the saying goes —
but researching how you’re going to get to Spain probably seems
much less of a thrill. Nevertheless, before you start packing for your
trip, you need to do a little homework. Sort out package and escorted
tours and find a good airfare. With all the information now available
online, this homework isn’t as complicated as it sounds.
Flying to Spain
Logically, most travelers will be flying to Spain. After you arrive in Spain,
low-cost airfares across Europe make flying more convenient than taking
a train or ferry, even for those travelers arriving from another European
country.
Finding out which airlines fly to Spain
Spain is the second most popular destination in the world, and most 
of the big airlines fly there from North America, the United Kingdom,
Australia, and New Zealand. A majority of travelers fly into either Madrid
or Barcelona, although several European airlines also fly directly to
Málaga as well as several to other Spanish cities (such as Bilbao and
Palma de Mallorca).
Flying from North America
Iberia Airlines (% 800-772-4642; www.iberia.com), the national car-
rier of Spain, is the principal carrier with the most routes into and within
Spain. It offers daily nonstop flights from New York, Chicago, and Miami
to Madrid (with connecting flights to Barcelona and other cities). You
can also catch flights from Los Angeles (with a brief stop in Miami).
Iberia also offers daily service to Madrid from Montreal.

Air Europa (% 888-238-7672; www.aireuropa.com), another Spanish
carrier, offers daily nonstop service from Newark, New Jersey, to Madrid
(and on to Barcelona after switching planes). It flies once a week from
New York to Málaga.
Air Plus Comet (% 877-999-7587; www.airplususa.com), headquartered
in Madrid, flies once a week (Fridays) from New York JFK to Málaga and
then on to Madrid.
Many North American airlines also fly to Spain. American Airlines
(% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com) offers daily nonstop service to Madrid
from Miami and New York (sharing routes with Iberia). Continental
Airlines (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com) has daily nonstop
flights from Newark to Madrid. Delta (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com)
maintains daily nonstop service from New York to both Madrid and
Barcelona (separate flights) and from Atlanta to Madrid. US Airways
(% 800-428-4322; www.usair.com) features daily flights to Madrid from
Philadelphia.
Among European (non-Spanish) airlines, British Airways (% 800-AIR-
WAYS; www.britishairways.com) flies from Toronto, Montreal, and
Vancouver (as well as from cities in the United States) to Madrid,
Barcelona, and Bilbao via London. TAP Air Portugal (% 800-221-7370;
www.tap-airportugal.pt) flies daily from New York to Madrid and
Barcelona via Lisbon. Lufthansa (% 800-645-3880; www.lufthansa-
usa.com) travels via Frankfurt, Germany, from major U.S. and Canadian
cities to the Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, Bilbao, and Palma de Mallorca.
Flying from the United Kingdom
British Airways (% 0870-850-9850 in London; www.britishairways.
com) and Iberia (% 0845-601-2854 in London) are the two major carriers
that fly from London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as from
Manchester. British Airways flies to Alicante, Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid,
Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Seville, Tenerife, and Valencia. Iberia offers
daily service to several points in Spain from London and Manchester,
including Alicante, Barcelona, Bilbao, La Coruña, Madrid, Oviedo, Málaga,
Santiago, Seville, and Valencia. Air Europa (% 0870-777-7709 in London;
www.aireuropa.com) flies from London Gatwick to Madrid and Palma de
Mallorca.
A number of low-cost European air carriers, among them EasyJet 
(% 087-0600-0000; www.easyjet.com) and RyanAir (% 087-1246-0000;
www.bookryanair.com), fly from the United Kingdom to many cities in
Spain. For more information, visit www.tourspain.co.uk.
Flying from Ireland
From Ireland, Aer Lingus (% 1-886-8844 in Ireland, or 0845-084-4444 in
London; www.aerlingus.com) flies daily to Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid,
Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, and Tenerife from Dublin. RyanAir (% 081-
830-3030) flies to several smaller Spanish cities from Dublin.
Chapter 5: Getting to Spain 65

Flying from Australia and New Zealand
There are no direct flights to Spain from either Australia or New Zealand.
Often the cheapest routes are through Asia, on carriers such as Japan
Airlines (% 02-9272-1111 in Australia; % 09-379-9906 in New Zealand;
www.japanair.com), Garuda Indonesia (% 02-9334-9970 in Australia;
% 09-366-1862 in New Zealand; www.garuda-indonesia.com),
Singapore Airlines (% 13-10-11 in Australia; % 0800-808-909 in New
Zealand; www.singaporeair.com), and Thai Airways (% 1-300-651-960
in Australia; % 09-377-0268 in New Zealand; www.thaiair.com).
British Airways (% 1-300-767-177 in Australia; % 09-966-9777 in New
Zealand; www.britishairways.com) flies to a number of Spanish cities
via London (see “Flying from the United Kingdom,” earlier in the chap-
ter). You can also fly Qantas (% 13-13-13 in Australia; % 0800-808-767
in New Zealand; www.qantas.com) to London and catch a British Air
flight to Spain from there.
Deciding which airport to fly into
Most international flights go to Madrid’s Barajas or Barcelona’s El Prat
airports (though others, especially European flights, also use Málaga,
Palma de Mallorca, and Bilbao). Which airport you fly into depends
upon your itinerary in Spain. If you plan to see Catalonia (including
Barcelona) or the north of Spain, flying into Barcelona’s El Prat is your
best bet. For most other parts of Spain, including Castile and Andalusia,
you’re better off flying into Madrid’s Barajas, which offers more direct
train and air service to those destinations, or into Málaga. Madrid also
has easy connections to the Basque Country and Navarra.
Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (a coach seat 
is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday), you can qualify for the
least-expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most
flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare is
close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket may
cost less than half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase requirements
and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you plan
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
66

your vacation, watch for these sales, which tend to take place in seasons
of low travel volume — in Spain, traditionally from October through
March. You almost never see a sale around the peak summer vacation
months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when
many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald. For less-developed destinations, small travel
agents who cater to immigrant communities in large cities often have the
best deals.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide, but particularly to that continent. Flights.com also
has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith
MyTravel and has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations.
AirTicketsDirect (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montreal and leverages the weak Canadian dollar for low fares.
Air Brokers International (% 800-883-3273; www.airbrokers.com) spe-
cializes in round-the-world travel, but also offers one-way and business
travel tickets to Europe. Airline Consolidator.com (% 888-468-5385;
www.airlineconsolidator.com) is an online travel agency offering 
discounted fares from more than 50 airlines, as well as Eurail and hotel
discounts.
Booking Your Flight Online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell the majority of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian trav-
elers should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. resi-
dents should check out expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has
different business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on
the same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity
will also send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes
available to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web
sites, SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users.
It’s a browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in
reality only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Chapter 5: Getting to Spain 67

Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
megasites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials, such
as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips, www.
site59.com in the U.S. and www.lastminute.com in Europe often have
better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control of your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mys-
terious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-
known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to
Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play
their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004 Priceline added nonopaque
service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times,
and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. 
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Arriving by Other Means
By train, the major international routes to Spain are from Lisbon to
Madrid, from Paris to Barcelona or Madrid, and from Geneva and Zurich
to Barcelona (all on sleeper-car trains). For more information, contact
Rail Europe (% 800-382-7245; www.raileurope.com).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details, and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront and, in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
68

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think that they’ll fulfill their insurance obli-
gations either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I
tell you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 9.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operators cancel the
trip if they don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they
cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to 
fit 25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to
relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum group
size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough people. If a
quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are to reaching
it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers, but the
information may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, no
exceptions? Are all meals planned in advance? Can you choose
your entree at dinner, or is it the same chicken cutlet for everyone?
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Petrabax Tours (% 800-634-1188; http://petrabax.com) has
organized, escorted motorcoach tours of Spain for nearly three
decades. Its long list of tours include bus tours, locally hosted city
packages, and fly/drive packages combining stays at different
paradores (a government-run chain of hotels; see Chapter 7). The
company offers four different parador routes through major cities.
Combinations with trips to Portugal or France are also available.
Chapter 5: Getting to Spain 69

 Trafalgar Tours (% 866-554-4434; www.trafalgartours.com) is
the world’s biggest-selling escorted tour operator, which translates
into attractive prices. Tours to Spain include a ten-day Spanish
Discovery trip that visits Madrid, Toledo, and the highlights of
Andalusia. Prices begin at $775 per person.
Choosing a Package Tour
For the most popular, tourist-oriented destinations in Spain, such as
Costa del Sol or Madrid, package tours are a smart way to save money.
In many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and trans-
portation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a
tour you book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour
operators who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your
vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one
who buys the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a
time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
You can buy a package at any time of the year, but the best deals usually
coincide with low travel season — October through March — when
room rates and airfares plunge. You may find your flight dates are more
limited during this time, because airlines cut back on their schedules
during the slow season, but if you’re flexible and don’t mind a little rain
or chilly weather, you can get some great bargains.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines. Liberty
Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.liberty
travel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast, and usually
boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
Most European airlines also offer competitive packages (see the appen-
dix for their Web sites and toll-free numbers). Likewise, the biggest hotel
chains, casinos, and resorts offer packages. If you already know where
you want to stay, call the hotel or resort and ask if it offers land/air pack-
ages (airfare, hotel room, and sometimes car rental, depending on the
deal).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
70

Sometimes penny-pinching packages pop up right before your trip. To
get the latest on last-minute package deals, log on to the Frommer’s Web
site (www.frommers.com) and check out deals for Spain. You may find a
$299 round-trip airfare or a $599 hotel and air package.
General-interest package tours
When considering a trip to Spain, you have hundreds of packagers to
choose from. (For a thorough, if still not exhaustive list, visit www.
okspain.org, which features more than 220 tour operators.) Spain 
specialists organizing general-interest package tours include
 Abreu Tours (% 800-223-1580; www.abreu-tours.com), a
Portuguese agency that claims to be the world’s oldest and, with
offices in New York and the United Kingdom, has an extensive
roster of package, escorted, and self-drive tours to Spain (and
Portugal). They also offer cruise, city combo, and rail travel
options at competitive prices.
 Solar Tours (% 800-388-7652; www.solartours.com), a whole-
saler, offers many standard packages. The company also conducts
themed tours like “Castles of Spain,” “Horses and Wine,” “White
Villages,” and “Jewish Heritage,” as well as self-drive packages
through Andalusia and Northern Spain. The service is only avail-
able through U.S. travel agents.
 Spanish Heritage Tours (% 800-456-5050; www.shtours.com) spe-
cializes in low-cost airfares to Spain and arranges custom tours of
Barcelona, Madrid, Costa del Sol, the Balearic and Canary Islands,
as well as cruises. Packages include round-trip air fare from New
York, transfers, three- or six-night hotel accommodations (starting
at just $229 per person), and daily buffet breakfast.
Special-interest tours
Dozens — if not hundreds — of tour companies cater to travelers with
specific active or cultural interests. The following list is just a tiny sample
of good organized trips targeting special interests:
 AtlanticGolf (% 800-542-6224; www.atlanticgolf.com) has been
organizing golf tours of England and Scotland since 1987 and now
also offers golfing vacations along the Costa del Sol in southern
Spain, with opportunities to play eight of Spain’s finest courses.

Chapter 6
Getting Around Spain
In This Chapter
 Jetting across Spain by plane
 Riding the country’s rails
 Boarding a bus to select destinations
 Renting a car and saving money while you do it
S
pain is easy to navigate with lots of excellent train and air options. It
isn’t nearly as big as the United States or Canada, but Spain is one of
the largest countries in Europe, and distances are deceptively long. If
you plan to cover a lot of ground after you arrive in Spain, you’ll proba-
bly want to travel those long legs of your trip by air. On the other hand,
if you’re planning more of a regional trip, rail and road are the best ways
to get around. In the destination chapters that follow, I give tips on the
best way to get to and around given regions.
By Plane
Flying between distant points sometimes makes sense in Spain; doing so
is not only efficient but relatively inexpensive. Some airlines advertise
domestic routes as inexpensive as 60€ ($72), and most 100€ ($120) or
less. The following carriers fly the domestic routes within Spain:
 Air Europa (% 888-238-7672 in the United States or 902-40-15-01 in
Spain; www.aireuropa.com)
 Iberia and its smaller cousins, Aviaco and Air Nostrum (% 800-
772-4642 in the United States or 902-40-05-00 in Spain; www.
iberia.com)
 Spanair (% 888-545-5757 in the United States or 902-13-14-10 in
Spain; www.spanair.com)
By Train
Unless you’re traveling in a region where renting a car for a driving tour
makes sense (see “By Car,” later in this chapter), the most economical —
and generally the most enjoyable and relaxing — way to travel in Spain

is on the Spanish State Railroad (abbreviated RENFE in Spanish). The
network of trains crisscrosses Spain, allowing you to travel to all but the
smallest towns. RENFE trains now enjoy a 98 percent punctuality rate.
Primary long-distance routes are served by night express trains with
first- and second-class seats as well as literas (bunks). High-speed trains
include the TALGO and AVE trains. Although TALGO and AVE trains are
slightly more expensive than regular largo recorrido (long distance)
trains and regionales (regional) and cercanías (local) trains, they are
vastly superior and faster.
Spain’s train fares are among the cheapest in Europe, and discounts are
available for students and seniors. Purchase tickets at the estación de tren
(train station) or RENFE taquilla (tah-kee-yah; ticket office). Many stations
are equipped with automated ticket-vending machines. Generally, reserva-
tions are only necessary for overnight sleeper berths and the high-speed
AVE trains during high season. Make reservations in person at the train
station or call the local RENFE office (see specific destination chapters) or
the toll-free number (% 34-902-24-02-02). You can find timetables at any
train station or travel agent’s office in Spain. You can also log on to the
RENFE Web site (www.renfe.es) to download schedules and fares.

Save with air passes
The Iberiabono España allows you to fly within Spain for 60€ ($72) per flight coupon
(minimum two coupons; 160€/$192 in business class). The air pass is good for all of
Spain’s most popular mainland destinations as well as the Balearic Islands. The air
pass is available year round, but you must purchase it prior to departure and in con-
junction with a round-trip transatlantic ticket to Spain on Iberia. It’s only available to
nonresidents of Spain. Additional coupons can’t be purchased after international travel
has begun; route changes are permitted at a cost of 25€ ($30) per change. Call 
% 800-772-4642 or visit www.iberia.com for more information and conditions.
Spanair offers two different air passes. The Discover Spanair Pass is a program that
allows passengers to purchase discounted tickets (68€/$87 per flight) to as many as
21 destinations in Spain, with no minimum; you must purchase the tickets outside the
country before arrival. Flights to the Canary Islands are 98€ ($125). The Spain Pass
offers flights within Spain for 55€ ($70) each (110€/$140 for the minimum of two flights).
Additional flights are 55€ ($70) each plus tax (flights to the Canary Islands are
102€/$130). Call % 888-545-5757 or, in Spain, 902-13-14-10; or visit www.spanair.
com for additional information.
The Europe by Air Flightpass allows you to create customized flight itineraries within
Europe for 78€ ($99) per flight (plus tax). The Europe by Air Pass works with Spanair
and other European carriers. For information, call % 888-321-4737, or visit its Web site
at www.europebyair.com.

Two superb vintage luxury trains, reminiscent of the Orient Express,
operate in Spain. One is El Transcantábrico, which runs across the
green north of Spain, from San Sebastián to Santiago de Compostela. The
other is Al-Andalus Expreso, which travels through romantic Andalusia.
For more information on El Transcantábrico, visit www.feve.es; for
additional information about the Al Andalus Expreso, see www.rail
europe.com. In the United States, for reservations and brochures on 
Al-Andalus Expreso, contact EC Tours (% 800-388-0077; www.ectours.
com); for El Transcantábrico, contact Marketing Ahead (% 800-223-1356
or 212-686-0271; www.marketingahead.com).
Saving money with rail passes
Rail Europe offers the Eurail Spain Pass, which allows any three days of
unlimited first- or second-class travel throughout Spain in a two-month
period (183€/$234 in first class, 143€/$182 in second). A Eurail Spain-
Portugal Pass, with prices that start at 212€ ($270), permits any three
days of travel within a two-month period for first-class train travel in
Spain and Portugal — including the high-speed AVE train from Madrid to
Seville. You can purchase additional days, up to a maximum of seven, for
an additional 29€ ($37) per day. The Spain Rail ’n Drive pass combines
three days of unlimited first-class train travel and two days in a rental
car (prices begin at 226€/$289 for two people in an economy car). On all
these rail passes, children under age 4 travel free, and children ages 4 to
11 pay half the adult fare. You can only purchase passes outside Spain,
prior to your departure. For more information, consult Rail Europe
(% 800-4-EURAIL in the United States, or 800-361-RAIL in Canada; www.
raileurope.com/us/rail/passes/spain_portugal_index.htm).
Knowing the language of el tren
You don’t need to know much Spanish to ride the trains in Spain, but a
few basic words can help. When reserving your ticket, ask for either 
ida (ee-dah; one-way) or ida y vuelta (ee-dah ee bwel-tah; round-trip).
Economy class is turista (too-ree-stah), and first class, primera clase
(pree-meh-rah klah-seh).
By Bus
Reserve bus travel mostly for places that you can’t get to by train. Though
buses are inexpensive and go everywhere, in my opinion they’re a less
preferable mode of transportation because they can be hot, crowded, 
and uncomfortable. The biggest exceptions to this rule are the buses to
Toledo from Madrid and those around the Basque Country, which are
faster and more frequent than trains. For information about bus travel to
those and other locations, see the relevant destination chapters later in
this book.
Chapter 6: Getting Around Spain 75

By Car
A car gives you the greatest flexibility while traveling in Spain, allowing
you to reach small towns, make detours, and stay any amount of time that
you want, independent of public transportation. On the other hand, rent-
ing an auto is more expensive than riding the train or bus, and you need
to worry about the business of driving in Spain — for example, reading
maps, extricating yourself from traffic and one-way streets, and following
street signs in Spanish (or Catalan) if you wander into a large city.
Generally, I’d save car rentals for the following regions:
 Day trips from Barcelona and around Catalonia, including the 
Costa Brava
 Side trips from Madrid — to Segovia, Salamanca, and Toledo
 Touring the pueblos blancos, or white villages, of Andalusia
Arriving in Spain with vouchers and reservations in place is both more
convenient and more economical. Otherwise, you risk not getting a car
(or the car of your choice) during the high season in popular areas.
Getting a good deal on your rental
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars. Check
into these issues:
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is for Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport; this is most often the case.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. You can check rates at
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
76

most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major travel sites —
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.
com), for example — have search engines that can dig up discounted car-
rental rates. You can even make the reservation through any of these
sites.
Covering all the charges
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply 
to most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
Many credit card companies cover the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW),
which requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Check
with your credit card company before you go so you can avoid paying
this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Check your insurance policy on your car at
home to see whether it covers any of these sorts of overseas incidents.
However, if your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you
don’t have auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage
(ask your car-rental agent for more information). You can probably skip
the personal effects insurance, but driving around without liability or
personal accident coverage is never a good idea. Even if you’re a good
driver, other people may not be, and liability claims can be complicated.
If you decline the insurance offered by car-rental companies because
your credit card covers it, keep in mind that, according to Spanish law,
you’re held liable for damage or theft to the car until your credit card
covers the charges. This means that you’re held responsible for up to the
full value of the car (in Europe, easily $20,000–$30,000 or more) until you
file a claim with your credit card company and they pay the claim. Be very
sure that your credit card does provide coverage. This Spanish law has
never stopped me from relying on my credit card’s policy of insurance,
Chapter 6: Getting Around Spain 77
Singing the stick-shift blues
In Spain, prepare yourself for small cars, narrow lanes, expensive gas, and standard
transmissions. Almost all Spanish cars have stick shifts. If you can find an automatic-
transmission car, it will be larger, more luxurious and significantly more expensive. If
you don’t drive a stick, make your rental reservations well in advance, because most
agencies have access to very few automatic cars. If it’s been a while since you last
drove a four- or five-speed standard transmission, brushing up before arriving on
Spanish soil is a good idea. Otherwise you may wind up on a steep, narrow one-way
street, nervously absorbing the impatient honks of a stream of drivers behind you.

but I’ve also never had an accident or a car stolen, so I hesitate to advise
you to do the same. Think about the consequences, and ask your credit
card company about its coverage (and response time) in such a situation.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas upfront and can return the car with an empty gas
tank. If you reject this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you
have to return the car with a full tank or face very high surcharges for
any shortfall. If you usually run late and a fueling stop may make you
miss your plane, you’re a perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Choosing a company
Most of North America’s biggest car-rental companies, including Avis,
Budget, and Hertz, maintain offices throughout Spain. You can also find
Spanish car-rental companies, but you’re better off going with a name
and company familiar to you.
Auto Europe (% 888-223-5555; www.autoeurope.com) may not be
immediately recognizable to you, but this wholesaler can reserve cars for
you in any Spanish city through its agreements with Avis or Europcar. I
found this service uniformly excellent and the prices very competitive.
Any reservation problems are easily solved by using a toll-free service
with English-speaking representatives, even in the smallest of towns.
Even if you prepay after making your reservations, you must still fork
over money for local tax and insurance matters at the local rental
agency in Spain. Your cost is a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA tax in
Spanish) plus any insurance that you decide to take out. If you’re pulling
out of an airport lot, expect to pay a surcharge of up to 10€ ($12).
Companies require that drivers be at least 18 years of age (some may
stipulate 21). To rent a car, you must have a passport and a valid driver’s
license; you must also have a valid credit card or a prepaid voucher.
Your home-country driver’s license is sufficient; no international license
is necessary.

Gas facts
In Spain, unleaded gasoline is called sin plomo. Americans find that gas (petrol in
Spanish, pronounced peh-trol) is very expensive in Spain — nearly twice as much as
in the United States. It’s also sold by the liter (a little more than a quart). To fill up, tell
the attendant (make sure you tip her a few coins): “lleno, por favor” (yeh-noh por fah-
vohr). Many Spanish gas stations, especially off highways, are now automated self-
service stations, so you don’t need to unleash your Spanish.

Understanding the rules of the road
Most traffic signs are international and easy to understand. Spaniards
drive on the right side of the road, and they drive fast. When they pass
on the left, they often zoom up quite close before darting around the car
in front of them. They may also honk their horns as they move to pass
you. Unless you’re willing to travel as fast as they do, move to the right
lane.
Spaniards tend to drive as though the entire country were one big south-
ern European racetrack, but in fact, speed limits do exist. Routinely
ignored but in force just the same, speed limits are: 120km/hr (74 mph)
on motorways and highways; 100km/hr (62 mph) on main roads; 90km/hr
(56 mph) on secondary roads; and 50km/hr (31 mph) in urban areas.
Spain has two types of express highways: autopistas, which sometimes
charge exorbitant tolls (peajes), and autovías, which are free. The prefix
A- or E- (the latter a European Union designation) precedes autopista
numbers on road signs. Exits are labeled salida, except in Catalonia,
where the sign reads sortida. Carreteras nacionales are countrywide main
roads designated by N- and a Roman numeral. To turn around and go the
other direction on a highway, look for the sign that reads CAMBIO DE SEN-
TIDO (change of direction) or shows a U-turn arrow.
Parking your car facing oncoming traffic is illegal. Cities have zona azul
(blue zone) areas where you can park in a metered spot. The meter is
normally just a few paces away; put in a few euro coins for the time
desired (rates are generally about 1.50€/$1.80 per hour) and place the
printed receipt on the dash inside your car (face up so parking police
can see how long you’re legally parked). Parking hours are from 8 a.m. to
2 p.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Saturday. In underground
parking areas, collect the ticket and pay upon exiting.
Never leave anything inside your car in full view. Break-ins and theft of
rental cars, especially in Madrid and Andalusia, aren’t uncommon. What
you can’t leave in the hotel, lock securely in the trunk.
Chapter 6: Getting Around Spain 79
Breakdown!
In the event of a vehicle breakdown, look for emergency phone boxes on major motor-
ways. On secondary roads, call for help by asking the operator to locate the nearest
Guardia Civil (police station), which can direct you to a garage or repair shop.
AAA maintains an association with the Real Automóvil Club de España (Royal
Automobile Club of Spain), José Abascal, 10, Madrid (% 91-594-74-00), which pro-
vides helpful information about road conditions and travel data, as well as limited
emergency road service. For assistance, call % 91-593-33-33.

The American Automobile Association (AAA; % 800-222-4357; www.

Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Considering your options, from hotels to castles to paradores
 Understanding everything you need to know about rack rates
 Looking for deals and making reservations
W
hen I backpacked around the globe as a college student, where 
I slept was usually the least of my concerns — I camped out in
train stations and on the floors of new acquaintances’ homes. Those
days — I’m mostly relieved to say — are long gone. For obvious reasons,
where you stay is a significant logistical detail when planning your trip
to Spain. You need a place to stay after long days of sightseeing. But
where you stay can also have a significant impact on how you experi-
ence the country. In Spain, you have the chance to stay in everything
from family-run inns to 16th-century monasteries and palaces.
In this chapter, I focus on the essentials about accommodations, includ-
ing what you get for your money (and how to get more).
Getting to Know Your Options
If you play your cards right, your accommodations in Spain can be as
evocative as the museums, castles, and flamenco shows that you experi-
ence. From converted medieval castles and Renaissance palaces to 16th-
century and Art Nouveau mansions, Spain has an unrivaled network of
atmospheric palaces in which to stay — and many are surprisingly
affordable. If those options sound too grandiose, you can also find sim-
pler hotels and guesthouses. A unique hotel can nearly equal the experi-
ence of visiting a special museum, though, as well as enhance your
appreciation of Spain. On the other hand, don’t overestimate the impor-
tance of a hotel room: If you can’t get into a particular place or your
budget won’t permit a stay at high-end hotels, don’t sweat it; your trip to
Spain can exceed your expectations even if you don’t stay at your (or
my) top choices.

Hotel accommodations are more reasonably priced in Spain than in
many other European countries, so I focus on moderate to expensive
hotels and the national paradores (a chain of state-owned properties
that I discuss in “Introducing paradores: Spain’s historic, government-run
hotels,” later in this chapter). Most of the small and very inexpensive
pensiones (pensions), hostales (hostels), and albergues (guesthouses)
have few amenities (such as private bathrooms) and even fewer person-
nel who speak English, so with a couple of exceptions, I stay away from
this category. Instead, I include the best-value hotels in each city and
region and make a special effort to include hotels with convenient loca-
tions and hotels with special Spanish character or architectural distinc-
tion. I also include a few high-priced hotels in several places, because
they’re simply worth the splurge.
If you’re traveling with a small group or your family and are interested 
in luxury villas and apartments for weeklong stays, have a look at the
Spanish offerings through Doorways Ltd. Villa Vacations (% 800-261-
4460; www.villavacations.com). They list a number of unique, gor-
geous properties across Spain.
On the whole, most Spanish hotels are a delight. Don’t expect them all 
to have 24-hour room service, coffeemakers, fax machines, e-mail, and
other American-style conveniences, however. What you can expect from
most hotels is personal service and a willingness to help you with direc-
tions, travel advice, and personal recommendations. At the more pricey
properties, you can almost universally expect hotel staff to speak fairly
fluent English. At smaller hotels, however, you need a little patience,
because sometimes employees may not understand you. Spaniards are
patient and eager to help, though, and communicating in simple English
or with sign language is part of the fun of traveling abroad. Most larger
hotels in large cities and resort towns offer nonsmoking rooms. If you’re
not a smoker, definitely ask your hotel if it has nonsmoking rooms.
Though Spain has gotten more expensive with the ascendancy of the
euro, finding affordable accommodations isn’t a massive problem in
most parts of Spain, though Barcelona and Madrid are considerably
more expensive than the rest of the country. Determining how much to
budget for a hotel depends not only on your finances but also on how
much time you plan to spend in your room. If you’re happy with a clean
but functionally furnished double hotel room with a private bathroom
and cable TV, expect to pay from 50€ to 100€ ($60–$120). This price
doesn’t get you luxury; it’s strictly budget territory. Rooms for this price
are no frills where décor is concerned, but have a livable and perfectly
inoffensive environment. Occasionally you can get a great location, but
doing so is a rarity.
If you’re willing to part with 101€ to 175€ ($121–$210), in most cities
and towns you can get a room with a good deal of comfort and, often,
some Spanish charm. You can also land a desirable, convenient location.
Naturally, the more you’re willing to spend, the better the service and
more luxurious the accommodations. However, be extremely careful

about extras such as telephone calls and minibar goodies, for which
Spanish hotels, just like their counterparts all over the world, charge
highway-robbery prices. (Avoid calling home from your hotel without a
calling card at all costs.) Check out Table 7-1 for a key on the dollar signs
I use in this book.

less than 50€ ($60)
These accommodations are rather
simple and inexpensive. Rooms will
likely be quite small, and televisions
aren’t necessarily provided. Parking

$$
50€–100€ ($60–$120)

176€–275€ ($211–$330)
These are what most people think of

top-rated restaurants. 
$$$$$
more than 275€ ($330)
These top-rated accommodations are
the crème de la crème, with the finest
of everything (in Spain, this category
is usually called “Five-star Grand
Luxury”). You will find valet parking,
on-premise spas, and other amenities,
such as at-your-service concierges.
At this rate, the hotel is likely to have
a unique quality, such as coveted
views or location, a restaurant with a
star chef, or ultrachic interior design.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 83

Breakfast most often costs extra, and a 7 percent value-added tax (IVA
tax in Spain) is added to the price of your room and anything else you
consume (including breakfast, telephone calls, laundry, and minibar
items). Note that the hotel VAT, or IVA tax, is nonrefundable to non-
European residents, unlike taxes on other consumer purchases (see
Chapter 4 for additional information).
In general, make your hotel reservations a couple of months in advance
(desirable, smaller hotels fill up fast). If you’re traveling in high season
(Apr–Sept) or to places that are swamped for special events, make your
reservations even earlier. Many hotels fill up in Seville during Feria de
Abril (April Fair), in Córdoba during May festival, and in both cities
during Easter week; for any of these times, I recommend making reserva-
tions six months or more in advance. For Pamplona’s Running of the
Bulls in July, making your reservations even a year in advance still may
not find you a place to stay.
Staying at a luxury hotel
The top-flight hotels in Spain are generally less expensive than their
counterparts in other parts of Europe, and Spain has some of the finest
luxury hotels on the continent, ranging from 16th-century palaces that
still welcome royalty to sleek, ultramodern boutique hotels obsessed
with hip design. See Chapter 1 for my picks for the top splurges (several
of which are surprisingly affordable).
Introducing paradores: Spain’s historic, 
government-run hotels
Foremost among Spain’s hotel offerings is the state-owned chain of
national paradores, which you can find sprinkled throughout Spain.
Many are former castles, convents, or palaces restored and furnished
with period pieces and modern amenities (though a few are modern and
comparatively unattractive). Staying at a couple of the top paradores
really adds to the flavor of your vacation. The first parador opened in
1928, and several of these establishments are among the finest places
you can stay anywhere, at prices far below those of most deluxe hotels.
The best paradores rank as both great experiences and bargains. Among
the stars of the 86-member network is the top-end and always-full
Parador de San Francisco in Granada. Even if you can’t get into that
one, you can find others that are nearly as historic and beautiful.
Paradores aren’t uniform in cost, but with just a couple of more expen-
sive exceptions, most are right around 120€ ($144) per night for a

Enjoying the charm of Spain’s smaller hotels
Spain is loaded with small hotels that are big on character and charm.
These hotels usually have a dose of regional flavor: They’re often con-
verted mansions, old Arab cármenes (houses with enclosed orchards
and gardens), and rustic farmhouses. Many are excellent deals. Expect
to pay from 70€ to 125€ ($84–$144) for a double at these smaller accom-
modations, though some are cheaper still.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Room rates are closely tied to seasonal demand in Spain, with clear
high, shoulder, and low seasons. High season is essentially from April to
the end of September. In the largest cities and certain other parts of the
country, however, the height of summer isn’t high season, as many
Spaniards evacuate for their annual vacations in July and August. Special
events, such as local and regional fiestas, Semana Santa (Easter Week),
and major draws such as the San Fermín (Running of the Bulls) in
Pamplona and Feria de Abril (April Fair) in Seville occupy a special 
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 85
Getting paramount deals at paradores
Spain’s paradores are pretty good deals to begin with, but a handful of special offers
makes them even more attractive. The Two-Night Stay (Especial Dos Noches) pro-
motion (available during certain dates at almost any of the paradores) offers a 20 per-
cent discount on the official price of the room, the buffet breakfast, and menu of the
day for the second meal of your choice (you must stay two or more nights half-board;
breakfast and one other meal included). Another great deal is the Five-Night Discount
Book (Tarjeta Cinco Noches), which contains five vouchers that you can use to stay
at any parador included in the promotion for 425€ ($431) plus tax, what amounts to
85€ ($102) per night for a double room (certain dates apply). For those who want to
plan their entire trip around staying in paradores, the Dream Week (Pasaporte de
Ensueño) allows for six nights stay in paradores along preestablished routes (with two
nights in each parador). Rates are 468€ ($562) plus tax per double room for six nights;
a 15 percent discount on lunch at the parador is also offered.
Other deals available include a 50 percent discount for children under 12 and half off
the price of adult menú del día (menu of the day) in parador restaurants and a free cot
for children up to age 2. Likewise, seniors (60 and older) receive especially good deals
(including a 35 percent discount on official rates), called Golden Days (Días Dorados),
at paradores. The Youthful Escape (Escapada Joven) program allows travelers ages
20 to 30 to stay at participating paradores for 45€ ($54) per person per night, includ-
ing buffet breakfast. For more information, including current promotions and dates of
deals, visit the group’s Web site, www.parador.es, or contact Marketing Ahead
(% 800-223-1356; www.marketingahead.com).

category; at these times, accommodations are much more expensive
(sometimes double or more) and harder to come by than during the
apex of regular high season. Deals are frequently available in shoulder
seasons (for most of Spain, Sept–Oct and Mar–Apr) and in the off-season
(Nov–Feb).
Cheaper accommodations are often available through package tours and
tour operators. For package-tour information, see Chapter 5.
Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier pro-
grams, any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or
your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for
that matter — when you call to book. You never know when the affilia-
tion may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
Sometimes getting a better deal may mean scoring a few extra amenities
instead of a strict price break on the cost of the room. You may ask for
breakfast, parking, or other services — such as a room upgrade — to be
included at no extra charge.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
86

Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room, which is usually larger and quieter,
with more windows and light than standard rooms. Spanish street life is
often active until the wee hours, so if you’re sensitive to street noise, ask
for a room that doesn’t face the street. Also ask if the hotel is renovating;
if it is, request a room away from the work. Inquire, too, about the loca-
tion of the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of
annoying noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, talk to the front desk. If they have another room, they should be
happy to accommodate you.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia (www.expedia.com) offers a long list of
special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can
see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that
the best rooms are often held back from bargain booking Web sites).
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) posts unvarnished customer
reviews and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating system.
Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent free pro-
gram, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search multiple
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 87
Racking up the rates come festival time
Occasionally in Spain, you’re not only asked to pay the rack rate, but you’re also
required to pay it twice over or more. Expect this when you make reservations in
Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls in early July, and in Seville during Easter and the
city’s Feria de Abril (April Fair). Don’t think they’re taking you for a sucker, though —
the hotels charge what they legally can and what they know they can get. Even at
those rack-rates–plus, you may still have a hard time getting a room during such fes-
tivities. (Some hotels are often sold out months, and even years, in advance.)

hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of — and con-
veniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes and serv-
ice charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), is
partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to
fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which
get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at
the hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation. It’s wise to get 
a confirmation number and make a printout of any online booking
transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) is
even better for hotels than for airfares; you’re allowed to pick the 
neighborhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your
money. Priceline’s hotel product covers Europe, though it’s best at get-
ting five-star lodging for three-star. On the down side, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingforTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For Priceline, you pay up front,
and the fee is nonrefundable.

W
hether you’re retired or a student, traveling with the kids in tow,
looking for hotels with special facilities, wanting a gay-friendly
vacation, or consumed by an interest in golf or gastronomy, you may
have special requirements that need consideration on your trip. In this
chapter, I have you covered.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an insur-
mountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding,
giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
Spaniards are extremely family oriented, and they dote on children. The
biggest problem you may encounter is meeting parents and grandparents
of all ages who want to talk to, play with, and spoil your kids.
However, the Spanish love for children doesn’t mean that your kids will
immediately adapt to all things foreign about Spain. The food and meal-
times are different, the language is strange, and travel is often exhaust-
ing, even for adults with long legs.
The kid-friendly icon used throughout the book indicates family-friendly
hotels, restaurants, and attractions.

One of your main considerations is feeding your kids. Do they like tapas
(yes, kids are welcome in most tapas bars)? If not, finding food that your
kids will eat shouldn’t be a problem; you can find American-style fast-
food restaurants in every Spanish city. However, the extremely late
Spanish lunch and dinner hours may cause a problem, and unfortu-
nately, very few restaurants provide anything that remotely resembles a
kiddie menu (though most are happy to provide smaller portions).
Many Spanish hotels offer special deals for children — at the least allow-
ing you to put a cot in your room for a nominal fee. Spain’s 86 national
paradores (government-run hotels, usually housed in historic buildings)
offer children ages 12 and under staying in parents’ room a discount of
50 percent during most of the year (July–Oct, the discount is 25 percent;
not valid during Easter Week or Dec 30–31). Children also receive 50 per-
cent off the price of the buffet breakfast and the adult menú del día at
lunch and dinner.
When traveling with your family, the cost of public transportation is also
a major consideration. Most Spanish buses and metro systems are free
only for children under 5; many Spaniards encourage their kids to slip
beneath turnstiles to get around (or under) this problem — though you
may not be willing to teach your kids how to circumvent the law just yet.
When you need a break from watching the kids, arranging day care and
babysitting in the larger cities is pretty easy — ask at your hotel or the
tourist information offices for recommendations (and see the Appendix
for more information on babysitting). Barcelona, for example, has sev-
eral babysitting agencies, whose services generally cost about 5€ to 10€
($6–$12) an hour. Many agencies can provide an English-speaking care-
giver upon request.
Children of all ages need a valid passport to travel to Spain; for more
information on getting a passport, see Chapter 9. You can find good
family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from such sites as the
Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a comprehen-
sive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel Network
(www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that offers
travel features, deals, and tips; TravelWithYourKids.com, a comprehen-
sive site that offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files
(www.thefamilytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine
and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for 
families.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Spain has long been a favorite of retirees, who love the country’s good
weather and relaxed pace. And the Spanish respect for family extends 
to the older generation. Spaniards view grandparents as pillars of the
family, and they treat the elderly and not-quite-ready-to-be-called-elderly
with dignity and deference.

Being a senior citizen entitles you to some terrific travel bargains (virtu-
ally every Spanish museum and attraction offers senior discounts). If 
a hotel or attraction doesn’t explicitly publish a discount for seniors,
never hesitate to ask: ¿Existe un descuento para mayores de edad?
(Is there a discount for seniors?)
Iberia Airlines’ Senior Plus Program offers travelers 62 years of age or
older a 10 percent discount on most airfares, including some promo-
tional discounts. For more information, contact Iberia Airlines (see the
Appendix for a list of airline toll-free numbers and Web sites).
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone older than 50
can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study

the world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States
(two–four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in
university dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks

off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers
50 and older. INTRAV (% 800-456-8100; www.intrav.com) is a high-end
tour operator that caters to the mature, discerning traveler, not specifi-
cally seniors, with trips around the world that include guided safaris,
polar expeditions, private-jet adventures, and small-boat cruises down
jungle rivers.
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 91
Hotel discounts for seniors
Spain’s national network of paradores (government-run hotels) offers a great deal for
seniors. The Días Dorados (Golden Days) program gives a 35 percent discount on
accommodations and breakfast for the over-60 set at almost any parador in Spain. (If
you’re a senior, the same discount applies to your roommate, regardless of age.)
Certain dates apply (usually Oct–Mar), and the discount isn’t valid for the parador in
Granada, the most popular one in the country. Request the Días Dorados brochure
from Marketing Ahead (% 800-223-1356) or log on at www.parador.es for a list of
hotels and dates that offer the discounts. See Chapter 7 for more information on the
paradores.

Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include the following: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond
(www.travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon
Adventures for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); The 50+ Traveler’s
Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); and Unbelievably Good Deals and
Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over

Accessing Spain: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. More options and
resources are available than ever before.
In some respects, Spain lagged behind Europe’s most developed coun-
tries for many decades and is still catching up with regard to facilities
that accommodate travelers with disabilities. For example, in subways
and trains, you find a glaring lack of ramps and elevators. Many of
Spain’s ancient towns were constructed a millennium or more before leg-
islation was introduced to create a level public playing field for people
with disabilities, so you may find that mobility is a problem, especially in
small, hilly towns. Expect uneven streets, unending stairs, and narrow
entryways without the standard American facilities that ease access.
However, conditions and awareness are steadily improving. (One of
Spain’s best-known public organizations is ONCE, a society for the blind
that sponsors a top cycling team and is known throughout Spain.)
If you’re a traveler with a disability, look for the newest hotels and
restaurants, and perhaps stick to the larger cities, such as Barcelona,
Seville, and Madrid. Keep in mind, however, that Spanish hotels claiming
to offer facilities and services for disabled visitors may be less well
equipped than hotels in the United States or your native country.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) has extensive access
information and advice for traveling around the world with disabilities.
Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339) offers tours for
wheelchair travelers and their families and friends.
Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; special car features, such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Relative to several of its European neighbors, Spain, an overwhelmingly
Catholic country, has been a bit slow in accepting openly gay 
expression — even though it legalized homosexuality after the death of
the repressive dictator Francisco Franco in 1978. Progressive film direc-
tor Pedro Almodóvar (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, All
About My Mother, Talk to Her) came of cinematic age during La Movida —
the artistic renaissance that flourished in Madrid and elsewhere after
Franco’s death. Almodóvar’s outrageously campy (though lately deadly
serious) and wildly popular films have gone a long way toward bringing
gay relationships into Spain’s cultural mainstream.
Public affection by same-sex couples still raises eyebrows in most
places, and it may even provoke hostility in small towns. In Madrid and
Barcelona, you can find many gay clubs and bars, though if you’re look-
ing for a specifically gay-friendly vacation, you may want to head to
Sitges, the beach resort just south of Barcelona, or Ibiza, the Balearic
island in the Mediterranean Sea, where an everything-goes attitude and
summertime hedonism reign.
In Madrid, gay nightlife centers in the area around Plaza de Chueca; Cafe
Figueroa (Augusto Figueroa 17) is one of the longtime pillars of gay life 
in the capital. For more information, contact the Coordinadora Gay de
Madrid (Espíritu Santo 37; % 91-523-00-70). Look for the free magazines

options.
The Web site www.gayinspain.com boasts an amazingly complete run-
down of gay-friendly events, hotels, restaurants, bars and nightclubs,
shops, health clubs, bookstores, and information services, all in English.
Another good general resource for gay travelers is Out and About (www.
outandabout.com), which lists gay travel sites, gay tour operators, and
gay-friendly hotels and clubs throughout the world. In Spain, it concen-
trates on Barcelona, Madrid, Sitges, Ibiza, and the Canary Islands. Pride
Holidays offers gay and lesbian tours to Spain, including city and day
tours (% 31-36-523-9965).
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-
0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclusive
lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for both gay and
lesbian travelers. Dasi Tours (Calle Fuencarral 60, Suite 3B, Madrid; 
% 562-430-7997 in the United States), a travel agency in Madrid, is a
member of IGLTA and organizes a variety of gay-oriented travel in Spain.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores: Out and About (% 800-929-2268 or 415-
644-8044; www.outandabout.com); Spartacus International Gay
Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide)
and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused
on gay men; the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with separate,
annual books for gay men and lesbians; and Gay Travel A to Z: The
World of Gay & Lesbian Travel Options at Your Fingertips by
Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari International; Box 35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a
very good gay and lesbian guidebook series.
Going to Spain as a Student
The best resource for students is STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.
statravel.com), the biggest student travel agency in the world. It can
set you up with the student traveler’s best friend, the International
Student Identity Card (ISIC). It’s the only officially acceptable form of
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
94

student identification, good for discounts on rail passes, plane tickets,
and other items. For an additional cost, it also provides basic accident
and sickness insurance. The card costs $22 per year. If you’re no longer
a student but are still younger than 26, you can get a GO 25 card (from
the same company), which entitles you to insurance and some dis-
counts (but not on museum admissions). In Canada, Travel CUTS
(% 800-667-2887 or 416-614-2887; www.travelcuts.com) offers similar
services.
Spain is a major destination for students traveling across the continent
with a Eurail train pass, and it’s also one of the biggest study-abroad 
centers in the world. International students flood Madrid, Seville, and
Salamanca — Spain receives more North American students for study-
abroad semesters and language courses than any other European country.
Students receive discounts on public transportation and almost all
attractions, including museums. Carry your ISIC with you at all times,
and never hesitate to ask: ¿Existe un descuento para estudiantes?
(Is there a student discount?) The relative affordability of Spain is espe-
cially gratifying for students. You can easily sleep, eat, and, yes, drink
while pinching pennies. Low-cost hotels (in Spain, chiefly hostales and
pensiones) and affordable restaurants abound.
Paradores, the national roster of historic hotels and inns run by the
Spanish government, has introduced a program of discounts for young
people 20 to 30 years old: Called “Escapada Joven” (Youthful Getaway),
it offers lodging (including buffet breakfast) in a standard double room
at any parador for just 45€ ($54) plus tax, per person, per night. And
better yet, even if the person accompanying the qualifying youngster
isn’t similarly blessed with youth, he or she qualifies for the discounted
rate while occupying the same room.
Exploring Your Special Interests
Spain has so much to offer that it’s the perfect place to indulge yourself
in a special passion, whether your particular interest is architecture and
design, history, bullfighting, or flamenco dancing. I choose to detail just
two possible pursuits — golf and gastronomy — both of which have
attracted immense interest in the last few years. See also Chapter 5 for
more on special-interest package tours.
Golf
Spaniards are huge golfing enthusiasts. British mining engineers intro-
duced the sport to Spain in the 19th century, and today Spain boasts
numerous top golfers, including José María Olazabal and Sergio García.
Some of the finest courses in Europe grace the southern coast of
Andalusia along the Costa del Sol, while you can find other great courses
in Catalonia and across Spain. Golfing vacations in Spain are on the rise;

 Golf in Spain (% 34-952-47-48-48; www.golfinspain.com/eng)
has a nice Web site with course reviews, online booking, golf pack-
ages, and special offers.
Wine and gastronomy
Spain is in the midst of a gastronomic explosion, with creative chefs,
especially in the Basque Country and Catalonia, rivaling the best France
and Italy have to offer. Traveling to Spain for the express purpose of
indulging in its suddenly chic cuisine and increasingly popular wines 
is an excellent way to learn about the country’s culture and people.

questions, safety, making advance reservations, and especially, what 
to pack.
Getting into Spain
Traveling to Spain is simple. Citizens (adults and children) of the United
States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand need only a
valid passport to enter Spain (for a stay of up to 90 days). As members
of the European Union, British citizens have it especially easy: They
don’t need to get their passports stamped (though they still need to
carry one).
Citizens of South Africa, however, need a visa in order to visit Spain.
Contact the Spanish Embassy or consulate in the city closest to you. The
Spanish Embassy is located in Pretoria (169 Pine St., Arcadia-Pretoria
0083; % 27-12-344-38-75). The Spanish Consulate is in Cape Town (37
Shortmarket St., Cape Town 8001; % 27-21-22-24-15), and you can find
an Honorary Spanish Consulate in Johannesburg (7 Coronation Rd.,
Sandhurst, Sandton-Johannesburg 2196; % 27-11-783-20-46).

Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an up-to-date
country-by-country listing of passport requirements around the world,
go to the “Foreign Entry Requirement” Web page of the U.S. Department
of State at http://travel.state.gov/foreignentryreqs.html.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S.
Department of State’s Web site, http://travel.state.gov/
passport/passport_1738.html, or call the National Passport
Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2×2
inches in size.
You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee.
For people 16 and older, a passport is valid for ten years and costs
$85. For those 15 and younger, a passport is valid for five years and
costs $70.
Allow plenty of time — at least two months before your trip, preferably
longer — to apply for a passport; processing takes four weeks on aver-
age but can run longer in busy periods (especially spring). However, if
you’ve waited too long and you’re willing to shell out the money, you can
pay extra for an expedited issuance. To expedite your passport — and
get it in five business days — visit an agency directly (or go through the
court or post office and have them submit your application by overnight
mail) and pay an additional $35 fee. For more information, consult the
Department of State’s Web site or call the National Passport
Information Center toll-free number (% 877-487-2778).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were older than 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $55. Whether you’re applying in person
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
98

or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S.
Department of State’s Web site at http://travel.state.gov/
passport/passport_1738.html. For general information, call the
National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To find your regional
passport office, either check the U.S. Department of State’s Web site 
or call the National Passport Information Center.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office. Call the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (% 131-232 toll-free
from Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details 
on how and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at post offices, passport 
offices throughout Canada, or from the central Passport Office,
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa,
ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications
must be accompanied by two identical passport-sized photographs
and proof of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days
if you apply in person, or about three weeks by mail.
 Residents of Ireland can apply for a ten-year passport, costing 57€,
at the Passport Office, Setanta Centre, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2
(% 01-671-1633; irlgov.ie/iveagh). Folks younger than age 18
or older than 65 must apply for a three-year passport that costs
12€. You can also apply at 1A South Mall, Cork (% 021-272-525) 
or at the counter in most main post offices.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from the Web site (www.
passports.govt.nz). Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-
225-050 in New Zealand.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
10-year passport (5-year passport for children younger than 16) at
passport offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For informa-
tion, contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-
0410; www.ukpa.gov.uk).
Keep your passport, or at the very least a photocopy of its principle
pages, with you (securely in your money belt) at all times. The only
times you need to hand over your passport are at the bank (for them to
photocopy when they change your traveler’s checks), at borders for the
guards to peruse, or to the conductor on overnight train rides. Also,
you’ll need to show it to any police or military personnel who ask for it,
and briefly to the concierge when you check into your hotel.
Hotel front desks in Spain often want to keep your passport overnight.
Because the hotel must register you with the police, the front-desk clerk
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 99

piles up all the passports in a drawer until the evening so he or she can
fill out all the guest slips at once. Smile and ask politely whether the
clerk can do the paperwork on the spot or at least whether you can
come by in an hour or two to retrieve your passport.
If you lose your passport while abroad, go directly to the nearest embassy
or consulate. Bring all forms of ID that you have, and they’ll start generat-
ing you a new passport. However, try to avoid passport hassles at all
costs. Keep yours in a safe place — either on your person or in your hotel
room safe, if your room has one.
Dealing with Spanish Customs 
and Immigration
The paperwork starts before you even set foot on Spanish soil. On 
the plane, you need to fill out a form for Spanish Customs. (See the
Appendix for information on what you can bring into Spain.) When you
arrive at the airport, you first go through Immigration. Pay attention to
the signs; if you’re not a member of the E.U. and you get in that line by
mistake, count on being turned around at the front and redirected to the
end of the proper line. Exiting the baggage area, you pass Customs offi-
cials (who in truth don’t pay all that much attention to incoming flights
of tourists from such places as the United States and the United
Kingdom). They’re legally allowed to rifle through your bags if they
choose, but they seldom do.
Coming back to the United States from Spain, Customs officials often ask
a few questions about where you’ve been. Mostly, they want to know
whether you’ve visited places other than Spain — North Africa, for
example. Customs officials ask these questions because people have
been known to make hashish detours to Morocco from Spain. In addition
to being illegal, taking controlled substances across international bor-
ders is extremely foolish.
Technically, you can bring as much loot as you want back into the
United States from a trip abroad, but the Customs authority does limit
how much you can take back for free (the limits are mainly for taxation
purposes, to separate tourists with souvenirs from importers).
U.S. residents can bring home $400 worth of goods duty-free, providing
you’ve been out of the country for at least 48 hours and haven’t used the
exemption in the past 30 days. The $400 limit includes one liter of an
alcoholic beverage (you must, of course, be 21 years old), 200 cigarettes,
and 100 cigars. Anything you mail home from abroad is exempt from the
$400 limit. You may mail up to $200 worth of goods to yourself (marked
“for personal use”) and up to $100 to others (marked “unsolicited gift”)
once each day, as long as the package doesn’t include alcohol or
tobacco products. You must pay an import duty on anything over these
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
100

limits. Art purchases are exempt from U.S. Customs and tax considera-
tions, so if you’re thinking about snapping up that long dreamt-about
Dalí or perfect Picasso, go for it.
If you’re a U.S. citizen, note that buying items at a duty-free shop before
flying home does count toward your Customs limits (monetary or other-
wise). The duty that you avoid in those shops is the local tax on the item
(such as state sales tax in the United States), not any import duty that
the U.S. Customs office may assess.
For additional information, or for a list of specific items that you can’t
bring into your home country, contact your Customs office. In the United
States, look in the phone book (under U.S. Government, Department of
the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service) or check out the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection Web site at www.customs.ustreas.gov/xp/cgov/
travel.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice on 
all three.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of
flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies con-
sidered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelguard.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a
credit card. By law, consumers can get their money back on goods
and services not received if they report the loss within 60 days after
the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider —
a convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever, and that means doing your homework and having insurance
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 101

against trip cancellation or other problems. In general, I think pur-
chasing insurance from a “third party” insurer is better rather than
getting insurance from the very same tour or cruise company
you’re traveling with.
Most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) don’t provide
medical insurance coverage for travel overseas, and the ones that
do often require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse you
only after you return home. Even if your plan does cover overseas
treatment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your bills
upfront, and send you a refund only after you’ve returned home
and filed the necessary paperwork with your insurance company.
As a safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insurance. If
you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for
general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On inter-
national flights (including U.S. portions of international trips), bag-
gage coverage is limited at approximately $9.07 per pound, up to
approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables are
covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy
Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the air-
port, because it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables
or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

Staying Healthy when You Travel
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety.
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and 
be reimbursed later. For information on purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the previous section.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
Staying connected to home (or, heaven forbid, the office!) is easier than
ever with technologies that have made the world a smaller place. You
can now pick up cellphones to call home and, of course, log on to the
Internet to access e-mail either at your hotel or any number of cyber-
cafes across Spain.
Using a cellphone outside the United States
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes
for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of
other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers
customers are GSM, and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone, such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across more developed areas on
much of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless oper-
ator and ask for “international roaming” to be activated on your account.
Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50 in
Western Europe.
Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you from
using any other removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM
card) card other than the ones they supply. However, if you have an
“unlocked” world phone, you can install a cheap, prepaid SIM card
(found at a local retailer) in your destination country. (Show your phone
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 103

to the salesperson; not all phones work on all networks.) You’ll get a
local phone number — and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an
already locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can
be done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad
for several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. You’re much better off arrang-
ing to rent a cellphone and a prepaid SIM card before arriving in Spain.
That way you can give loved ones and business associates your new
number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you
go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries,
where local phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and may
not let you take the phone to another country. However, if you decide 
to rent a cellphone (teléfono móvil, or simply móvil) after you arrive in
Spain, I suggest you inquire at the local tourism office, as I don’t have
any experience with local cellphone rental agents and am hesitant to
recommend one. At this point, no such agents are stationed at either the
Madrid or Barcelona airport.
CellularAbroad (% 800-287-3020; www.cellularabroad.com/
spainRcell.html) rents Ericsson R520 or a Motorola Timeport tri-band
cellphone for use in Spain. Rates are 24€ to 41€ ($29–$49) for one week,
41€ to 58€ ($49–$69) for two weeks, and 58€ to 74€ ($69–$89) for a
month. You’ll also need a Spain SIM card, which costs 66€ ($79) and is
yours to keep. Domestic rates are as low as approximately .1 eurocents
(12¢) per minute, and calls back to the United States and Canada are
approximately 60¢ per minute. Included is initial airtime worth 18€
($22), or 48 minutes of outgoing calls back to the United States (off-
peak), or 40 to 200 minutes of local dialing within Spain (depending on
time of calls).
Accessing the Internet away from home
Most Spaniards still don’t have computers and modem connections in
their homes, so Internet cafes, usually called cibercafés (thee-behr-cah-
fehs), are common, even in rural Spain. Although no definitive directory
for cybercafes exists, two places to start looking are at www.cyber
captive.com and www.cybercafe.com. However, finding one is 
usually as simple as strolling the main street — or asking at the local
tourism information office. In general, Spanish cibercafés charge around
2€ to 3€ ($2.40–$3.60) an hour (though in a small town where someone
has a monopoly on the service, you may have to pay double that).
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) is available in selected cities in Spain, with the
national telecommunications company Telefónica rolling out service
and some hotels and cafes offering wireless service, though it’s not
nearly as common as it is in North America. For information about pre-
paid Wi-Fi cards, see www.telefonicaonline.com/on/es/wifi/
index_venta.htm (Spanish only). If you’re unable to connect via Wi-Fi,
most business-class hotels in Spain offer dataports for laptop modems,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
104

and many hotels now offer high-speed Internet access using an Ethernet
network cable.
Wherever you go with your laptop, bring a connection kit of the right
power (220v in Spain) and phone adapters, a spare phone cord, and a
spare Ethernet network cable — or find out whether your hotel supplies
them to guests. Spain uses the North American RJ11 phone jack. Try
www.walkabouttravelgear.com/c_spain.htm for any adapters you
may need.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
Generally, you’ll be fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a
domestic flight and two hours before an international flight; if you show
up late, tell an airline employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the
front of the line.
When traveling to Spain, you need to bring a passport. Bringing another
current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license is also a
good idea to help with security in any U.S. airport. Keep your ID ready to
show at check-in, the security checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate.
(Children younger than 18 don’t need an ID for check-in and the security
checkpoint as long as they’re with a parent or guardian. However, chil-
dren younger than 18 do need a passport for flights to Spain. See the
“Applying for a U.S. passport” section earlier in this chapter for more
information.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. Although E-tickets have largely made
paper tickets obsolete for domestic flights, when flying abroad you still
need to check in at the counter and show your valid passport.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain.
If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline
employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by 
not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you have metallic
body parts, a note from your doctor is helpful. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for those escort-
ing disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring food
in your carry-on rather than checking it, as explosive-detection machines
used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food (especially
chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. The TSA has issued a list of
restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp)
for details.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 105

Airlines limit you to a single carry-on for crowded flights and impose
size restrictions on the bags that you bring on board. The dimensions
vary, but the strictest airlines say that carry-ons must measure no more
than 22×14×9 inches, including wheels and handles, and weigh no more
than 40 pounds. On international flights from North America to Spain,
passengers can carry two pieces of checked luggage, not to exceed 
70 pounds each. The third bag must be a carry-on, but weight limits vary
according to the airline, from 20 pounds to 70 pounds (though no one
ever checks; size is more important).
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores. These locks, approved by the TSA, can be
opened by luggage inspectors with a special code or key. For more infor-
mation on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something
other than TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if
a TSA agent needs to hand-search your luggage.
Making Reservations and Getting 
Tickets in Advance
For most activities, events, and dining, you don’t need to make advance
reservations — at least not from home before you set out for Spain. You
can usually pick up last-minute tickets to music and theater performances.
To find out what’s showing during your visit, check out the two Web
sites of the leading cultural guide in Spain, Guía del Ocio. It offers both
Madrid (www.guiadelocio.com/madrid) and Barcelona (www.guiadel
ocio.com/barcolona) editions; the sites (in Spanish) cover music, art,
theater, cinema, and so on. In a similar vein is LaNetro Madrid (http://
madrid.lanetro.com), also in Spanish. English-language stops on the
Web include www.timeout.com/barcelona and www.timeout.com/
madrid. See the Appendix for a list of other informational Web sites.
If you’re traveling in high season, checking into advance tickets to visit
the Alhambra in Granada is a good idea. (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya handles
advance sales up to a year in advance at www.alhambratickets.com or
in Spain by calling % 902-22-44-60.) Big-ticket entertainment shows for
which I advise getting advance tickets include the opera houses in
Madrid (www.teatro-real.com) and Barcelona (www.liceubarcelona.
com), the Palau de la Música concert hall (www.palaumusica.org) 
in Barcelona, and the popular Summer Music Festival in Perelada (www.
festivalperalada.com). You also need to order in advance if you want
tickets for the most popular soccer games. For Barcelona’s popular
fútbol (soccer) squad, FC Barcelona, log on to www.fcbarcelona.com
for information and schedules (call % 93-496-36-00 for tickets).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Spain 
106

Madrid’s top team, Real Madrid, also has a Web page (www.real
madrid.es), or call Caja Madrid (% 902-488-488) for tickets.
If you’re a jazz fan, catch one of Northern Spain’s excellent summer jazz
festivals. You can get a schedule and reserve tickets in advance for the
festivals in Bilbao (% 944-91-40-80; www.getxo.net), San Sebastián
(% 943-48-11-79; www.jazzaldia.com), and Vitoria (% 945-14-19-19;
www.jazzvitoria.com).
Serviticket (www.lacaixa.es) handles online ticket sales in Barcelona
and Catalonia. In Madrid, Caja Madrid (www.cajamadrid.es) lists a
wide series of events, including bullfights, fútbol, music, theater, opera,
dance, and more. At press time, however, you can reserve and purchase
tickets only by telephone (% 902-488-488).
Usually only the top Spanish restaurants require a reservation in order
to get in. (However, if a restaurant particularly interests you, and espe-
cially if you hope to dine late on a Friday or Saturday night, call for a
reservation as soon as you hit town.) Be sure to make reservations at
the most highly sought-after restaurants in Madrid, Barcelona, and the
Basque Country. In Bilbao, dining at Martín Berasategui’s Restaurante
Guggenheim Bilbao (% 94-423-93-33), within the museum, usually
requires a reservation at least two weeks in advance. If you have your
heart set on a blowout dinner in San Sebastián at either Arzak (% 943-
27-84-65; www.arzak.es) or Akelaré (% 943-21-20-52) in high season
(July and Aug), make the reservation from home to make sure you get in
(see Chapter 12 for reviews of all three restaurants). The country’s most
famous restaurant, El Bulli (% 972-15-04-57) on the Costa Brava, is
impossible to get in without a (lucky) reservation made far in advance.
Packing for Spain
What are the bare essentials for traveling in Spain? Comfortable walking
shoes, a versatile sweater and/or jacket, rain gear, sunscreen and a cap,
toiletries and medications (pack these in your carry-on bag so you have
them if the airline loses your luggage), and a camera with extra film.
You’ll almost never need a suit or a fancy dress, though for most travel-
ers, some smart casual wear is essential.
Spaniards are generally very stylish and fashion-conscious, and visitors
usually need smart casual clothing to feel like they fit in. Men are expected
to wear a jacket in top restaurants. Jeans and sport shirts (and sandals
and Bermuda shorts in summer) are acceptable in informal bars and
restaurants.
If you head to the north of Spain, don’t forget some rain gear — a light-
weight, water-resistant jacket or poncho. For the rest of the country,
take sunscreen and a cap or hat gear also.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 107

Because lost-luggage rates are at an all-time high, many travelers bring
their possessions on board to try to divert disaster. However, planes are
also more crowded than ever, and overhead compartment space is at a
premium. New security measures have made carrying luggage on board
more complicated than ever (see “Keeping Up with Airline Security” ear-
lier in this chapter). Make sure that you consolidate your medications,
documents, and valuables into your one carry-on bag. And don’t pack
your jewelry in your suitcase. In fact, don’t pack your jewelry, period.
The standard for electricity in Spain is 220 volts, but some hotels have a
voltage of 110 to 120 in bathrooms as a safety precaution. Sockets (out-
lets) take round, two-pin plugs, so you may need to pack an international
adapter plug. North Americans also need a transformer unless they have
dual-voltage travel appliances.

Part III
Northern Spain:
Barcelona, the Costa
Brava, and the
Basque Country

In this part . . . 
T
he north might challenge your preconceptions of Spain.
For example, in Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capi-
tal, Spanish isn’t the main language (Catalan is). Catalonia, in
the extreme northeast corner, has long been considered more
continental and faster-paced than the rest of the country, and
though this part of Mediterranean Spain is deﬁnitely unique,
it has just about everything for which you come to Spain: his-
tory, culture, unique architecture, incredible landscapes, and
spectacular coastlines. From the 2,000-year-old but cutting-
edge city of Barcelona to the fertile lands of Girona province
and the beach coves of the Costa Brava, Catalonia is very
nearly what Catalans say it is: a country unto itself.
The Basque Country and Navarra, on the other hand, are
remote and primarily rural areas, isolated by harsh climates
and rugged terrain. The people living here today trace their
roots to some of the earliest inhabitants of Spain, and they
stick to their traditional ways. However, that doesn’t mean
there aren’t exciting things happening up north. The revolu-
tionary Guggenheim Museum has single-handedly revitalized
industrial Bilbao. San Sebastián is a gourmet paradise — the
ﬁnest restaurant scene in Spain. And Pamplona, of course, is
that near-mythical place where bulls charge through narrow
streets on the heels of thrill-seekers.
Whether you want a relaxing trip to traditional Spain or
you’re looking for more adventure, you can ﬁnd it in the cities
and the little-known countryside of northern Spain.

B
arcelona has been around since the Romans dubbed it Barcino and
built a sturdy stone wall around it 2,000 years ago, but it was the
1992 Summer Olympic Games that really thrust this self-assured and cos-
mopolitan city onto the world stage. In a flash, Barcelona became one of
Europe’s hottest destinations. And it hasn’t cooled off one bit.
The most dynamic city in Spain, Barcelona is as intoxicating as they
come; La Rambla boulevard is a pulsating parade of locals, tourists, 
and cheery hucksters, and the Gothic Quarter’s narrow, dark alleys res-
onate with romance and history. With its palm trees, sparkling urban
beaches, and outdoor cafes, Barcelona has the languid air of a sultry
Mediterranean capital, while its industriousness and commitment to
eye-popping style, design, and architecture give it the air of a progres-
sive northern European city.
Barcelona has a long tradition of embracing visionary artists like Pablo
Picasso, Joan Miró, and Salvador Dalí; its favorite eccentric son is Antoni
Gaudí, whose wildly imaginative architecture is an appropriate symbol
for this ancient yet cutting-edge city. Though parts of the Roman wall
still stand and the Gothic Quarter remains fundamentally unchanged
since the Middle Ages, Barcelona has reinvented itself several times in
the past century. The Olympic Games sparked a rejuvenation that cre-
ated lively new neighborhoods, reinvigorated the waterfront, and dra-
matically cleaned up the city’s moderniste masterpieces. Barcelona has
never looked better.
Barcelona is the capital of the province of the same name as well as the
capital of independent-minded Catalonia — an autonomous region in the
northeast of Spain. The people of Spain’s second-largest city are hard
working, pragmatic, and serious about their Catalan identity, with its

unique language and strong ties to the countryside. Voters overwhelm-
ingly approved a contentious 2006 referendum, backed by Spanish
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, that awarded the region greater
control over its political and economic affairs than ever before, going so
far as to refer to Catalonia as a “nation.”
On weekends, many Barcelona residents rush out to beach apartments
and renovated 16th-century country masías (farmhouses), or head to
the hills in search of wild mushrooms. When visiting Barcelona, imitating
the natives is a terrific plan: Spend a few days in this head-turning, cos-
mopolitan city, as well as a couple in the countryside or on the beaches
of the Costa Brava (for more on the Costa Brava, see Chapter 11).
Barcelona offers some of the finest dining in Spain. Some of Europe’s
most adventurous chefs have established themselves in Barcelona, and
the city has become a true gastronomic destination. Whether you sit at a
chic table or stand at a bar, you can enjoy fresh seafood and local ingre-
dients with a Mediterranean accent (plenty of olive oil, tomatoes, and
fresh vegetables). Wash it all down with local Penedès or Priorat red
wines, or cava, Spain’s excellent sparkling wine.

112
The guru of modernisme
Antoni Gaudí, the eccentric architect of several of Barcelona’s most mind-bending
masterpieces, was the best-known proponent of modernisme, or Catalan Art Nouveau.
A pious man with a devil of an imagination, Gaudí was destitute and unrecognizable
when run over by a tram in 1926. Yet he remains a celebrated figure, and his stature
has grown exponentially as more people are exposed to the unique works he left
behind only in northern Spain. Gaudí now has disciples across the globe. Pope John
Paul II set him on the road to beatification (an act that pre-figures sainthood in the
Catholic Church) in 2000, and 2002 was declared the “International Year of Gaudí,”
with special exhibits and conferences, as well as a special Ruta Gaudí tour, hosted by
his native city.
Barcelona brims with buildings molded like ocean waves, roofs tiled like dragon
scales, and chimneys straight out of Star Wars — and that’s just Gaudí. Around the
turn of the 20th century, a whole band of modernistes in Barcelona dreamed up the
most fanciful buildings their imaginations and rich patrons allowed. Gaudí’s creative
cohorts were Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, among many
others. You can see their unique take on Art Nouveau in its fantastic forms, decora-
tive flourishes (in wrought iron, metal, colorful tiles, and stained glass), and signature
elements such as Gaudí’s bizarre chimneys. This group also introduced such conven-
tion-defying structural innovations as parabolic arches and spirals. Even a century
later, the audacious buildings they left in Barcelona, such as the Sagrada Familia
church, La Pedrera apartment house, and the Palau de la Música concert hall, as well
as dozens of forward-looking residential buildings, still wow visitors as aesthetic and
engineering marvels.

The weather in Barcelona is welcoming — mild and sunny much of the
year. In the main summer months, this Mediterranean city is beset by
heat and humidity and a crush of international visitors. For my money,
Barcelona really thrives in spring, early summer, and fall.
Getting There
Several airlines offer direct international flights to Barcelona from North
America and Europe. There are frequent shuttle flights from Madrid as
well as flights from virtually every Spanish city that has a passenger air-
port. However, you can also roll into town on rented wheels or aboard a
RENFE train — Spain’s national train service.
By air
Airlines that fly into Barcelona from North America include Delta and
Iberia. Barcelona’s international airport, El Prat de Llobregat (% 93-
478-50-00; www.aena.es), lies 12km (7 miles) south of the center of the
city. The international terminal is Terminal A; Terminals B and C handle
domestic and European flights. The airport is currently being expanded
to handle Barcelona’s ever-increasing traffic. If you’ve flown in from
overseas, you must go through Customs first (you’ll see two lines, one
for European Union [E.U.] members and another for everyone else), and
then go downstairs for your luggage.
Carts are free; grab one, sling your bags onto it, and wheel past the usu-
ally uninterested guards (who theoretically are allowed to inspect your
bags if they choose, something they almost never do) out to the soaring,
glass-enclosed lobby, which even has palm trees growing under the roof.
You can find rental-car agencies, an ATM, and a tourism information
booth (open 9 p.m.–9 a.m. daily) just a few feet from where you emerge
from baggage claim. Drop in at the tourism counter to pick up a map and
get easy directions to the buses, trains, and taxis going into the city.
If you’re flying in from Madrid, shuttle flights run on the hour (and more
frequently during prime business-travel hours) on Iberia (% 902-40-05-
00; www.iberia.com), Air Europa (% 902-40-15-01; www.air-europa.
com), and Spanair (% 902-92-91-91; www.spanair.com).
You have three options for getting from the airport into Barcelona — and
for returning to the airport — train, bus, or taxi. All three methods from
the airport to downtown take between 30 and 45 minutes. Of course, taxis
deposit you at your hotel — an important consideration if you’re feeling
ragged after a long flight or aren’t traveling especially light. If you have
transportation questions, call Airport Information, at % 93-298-38-38.
 White taxis, lined up outside the terminals, take you to the center
of the city for about 20€ ($24; in addition to baggage supplements
of .90€/$1 per bag). Taxis don’t necessarily get you to the city much
quicker than the Aerobús, because traffic in Barcelona can be a real
Chapter 10: Barcelona 113

drag (unless you’re staying at a hotel near the waterfront, which is —
surprisingly — quickly accessed along the Ronda Litoral beltway
from the airport).
 The inexpensive Aerobús (% 010 or 93-412-00-00) is probably your
best option from the airport if you’re traveling light, especially
because most of the hotels I recommend are close to the many
stops that it makes. Buses depart every 12 minutes for Plaça
Catalunya, passing some principal addresses en route, including
Plaça de Espanya, Gran Vía, and Passeig de Gràcia. Buses run
Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to midnight; weekends from
6:30 a.m. to midnight. Aerobús buses return to the airport from
Plaça Catalunya, following the same schedule. The price is 3.60€
($4) one-way or 5.90€ ($7) round-trip.
 RENFE (% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es) runs trains just outside the
airport terminal. Trains leave every 25 minutes, stopping at Estació
de Sants and Plaça Catalunya (so you’ll probably need a taxi to com-
plete your journey), and hours of operation are Monday through
Friday, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.; cost is 2.60€ ($3). RENFE now features
a multiuse T-1 ticket (see the sidebar entitled “Multitrip ticket bar-
gains,” later in this chapter) that you can use on the airport train.
By train
Trains are one of the best ways to get around Spain, even if they don’t have
the same reputation for punctuality as Swiss or German trains. RENFE
(% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es) is the Spanish national train service.
Most national and international trains arrive at Estació Sants, Plaça dels
Països Catalans, s/n (% 93-495-62-15; Metro: Sants). Trains with interna-
tional destinations also leave from Estació de França, Avinguda Marquès
de l’Argentera, s/n (% 93-496-34-34; Metro: Barceloneta). Ferrocarrils
Generalitat de Catalunya, also known as FGC (% 93-205-15-15; www.
fgc.net), runs the local trains in Catalonia.
By car
The highways outside of Barcelona are generally excellent — even though
everyone drives at warp speed. The A-7 highway leads to Barcelona from
France and northern Catalonia — the Costa Brava and Girona. The A-2
leads to Barcelona from Madrid, Zaragoza, and Bilbao. From Valencia or
the Costa del Sol, take the E-15 north.
When you get close to the city, look for one of two signs into downtown
Barcelona: CENTRE CIUTAT takes you downtown into the Eixample district,
and the RONDA LITORAL is a beltway that takes you quickly to the port area.
Autopistas are toll roads, and in Catalonia they’re among the best but
also the costliest in Spain. If you have more time than euros, look for the
local highways (designated by N, as in N-1): not as direct but consider-
ably cheaper. The word you want to stay away from, the one that will
make you dig into your pockets, is peatje or peaje (toll).
Part III: Northern Spain 
114

By bus
Buses (autocares) are generally cheaper than trains, but they’re not the
most comfortable or relaxing way to travel. You often feel squeezed in
your seat.
Several coach operators, including Enatcar (% 93-245-25-28), Julià 
(% 93-490-40-00), and Sarfa (% 93-265-11-58), offer bus service to
Barcelona from cities and towns in Catalonia and farther afield. Most
Spanish buses arrive at and depart from Estació del Nord, Alí Bei 80 
(% 902-26-06-06; Metro: Arc de Triomf); international buses use Estació
Sants (% 93-490-40-00; Metro: Sants), next to the Sants train station.
By ferry
With its revitalized port, part of a concerted effort to renew the city’s
maritime past, Barcelona has become one of Europe’s top cruise ports,
and shiploads of tourists now stream into the city from across the
Mediterranean.
If you’re arriving by boat into Barcelona’s port (Estació Marítim), you’re
either steaming in on a huge Mediterranean cruise ship or aboard the
ferry that runs to Palma de Mallorca. Transmediterránea, Muelle de San
Beltrán (% 902-45-46-45; www.trasmediterranea.com), operates fer-
ries to the Balearic Islands. Most of the year these ferries take about
eight hours to arrive. In summer, Transmediterránea operates an
express ferry that takes about four hours to Palma de Mallorca.
Orienting Yourself in Barcelona
A city with a metropolitan population of 4 million, Barcelona doesn’t
seem nearly that large. It’s penned in by natural barriers — the Mediter-
ranean Sea and the low-slung Montjuïc and Tibidabo mountains. However,
Barcelona is also among Europe’s densest cities; cars and one of the con-
tinent’s highest concentrations of motor scooters choke the streets.
Barcelona’s major neighborhoods tend to overlap (which is why many
guidebooks claim the Picasso Museum is in the Gothic Quarter, when it’s
actually in La Ribera). A focal point of the city is Plaça de Catalunya,
which neatly divides the Old Quarter from the modern expansion. Ciutat
Vella loosely encompasses much of the Old City, including the once-
walled Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter), La Ribera, La Rambla, and El Raval.
The elegant shopping avenue Passeig de Gràcia bisects El Eixample (the
modern city, constructed on a grid). Parallel to Passeig de Gràcia is
Rambla de Catalunya, a tree-lined extension of the old town’s famous
boulevard La Rambla. The waterfront area comprises a number of smaller
areas: Barceloneta, Port Vell, Moll de la Fusta, Port Olímpic, and Vila
Olímpica (see “Exploring Barcelona by neighborhood,” later in this 
chapter).
Chapter 10: Barcelona 115

Much of Barcelona, especially the Gothic Quarter, is a hair-raising maze.
How on earth people got their mail back in the 12th century I don’t know.
Even in the modern city’s geometric grid, street numbers can be a con-
fusing mess. Odds and evens don’t progress logically or even chronolog-
ically on opposite sides of the street; No. 10 may be across from No. 323.
When giving addresses, locals often designate mar o montaña (sea or
mountain side). This designation makes directions easy, because in most
parts of the city, all you have to do is look up to see Tibidabo Mountain
to orient yourself. To begin, figure out whether an address is above or
below Plaça de Catalunya, and then figure out on which side of Passeig
de Gràcia or La Rambla it falls. Your next step may be supplementing the
maps in this book with a more detailed one from a kiosk.

Bar-theh-loh-nah: Calling all 
linguistics majors
In bilingual Barcelona, almost everyone speaks both Spanish and Catalan. The latter,
the primary language of Catalonia, isn’t a dialect of Spanish but a nasal Latin-derived
tongue that sounds — if Catalans will forgive the gross oversimplification — some-
thing akin to a cross between French and Castilian Spanish. In Spanish, Barcelona is
pronounced with a lisp: Bar-theh-loh-nah. In Catalan, the pronunciation has a soft c,
as it does in English. The region of which Barcelona is the capital is spelled Catalonia
in English, Cataluña in Spanish, and Catalunya in Catalan. The back-and-forth between
Catalan and Castillian Spanish is ever-present in the Catalan capital; you’ll hear both
in pretty much equal amounts, and street signs and other communications are in both
languages, though predominantly in Catalan.
If you’re hoping your high-school Spanish will rescue you, well, you probably didn’t
learn terms like carrer (calle, or street); avinguda (avenida, or avenue); or passeig
(paseo, or boulevard). Still, locals often refer to streets interchangeably by their
Catalan and Spanish names. The city’s most famous street variously appears as La
Rambla, Las Ramblas, or, in Catalan, Les Rambles. The modern gridlike area of down-
town is most often called El Eixample (the Extension), though some older Spanish-
speakers still call it the Ensanche. Passeig de Gràcia is frequently called Paseo de
Gracia in Spanish.
As if that weren’t enough, the Catalan language has a number of idiosyncratic fea-
tures. A period in the middle of a word (Paral.lel) isn’t a misprint but a construction
used to separate the double letter. The letter i (as in Antoni Gaudí i Cornet) often sep-
arates a person’s last name; meaning “and,” the letter i joins the surnames of both the
person’s mother and father.
If that sounds confusing, don’t worry; you’ll get the hang of it. (And if you don’t, it won’t
detract from your enjoyment of the city in the least.)

Introducing the neighborhoods
Check out the sites in the following neighborhoods as you tour Barcelona.
El Eixample
When Barcelona grew beyond its old Roman walls in 1860, the city came
up with a hyper-rationalist expansion plan: a major grid of equal-sized
blocks. Building took place when industrial and shipping wealth flowed
into the city, and the moderniste style of architecture took root. El
Eixample (eye-shahm-pluh, occasionally called El Ensanche, in Spanish)
is home to fine strolling boulevards, designer shops, and most offices
(pinstriped lawyers and bankers have some of the coolest Art Nouveau
digs). El Eixample is the best neighborhood for hotels and shopping, but
you may also decide to spend much of your sightseeing time here,
because most of the moderniste buildings are in this neighborhood. The
Eixample grid contains the Plaça de Catalunya, the geographic heart of
the city; the Passeig de Gràcia, Barcelona’s boulevard of ultrachic
shops, Gaudí’s masterpiece, the apartment building La Pedrera (also
called Casa Milà), and the Manzana de la Discórdia, the “block of 
discord,” a collection of some of the finest moderniste buildings in
Barcelona; and La Sagrada Familia, Gaudí’s visionary, still unfinished
church, begun in the early 20th century. Expect to find construction
crews here midway through this millennium.
Ciutat Vella (Old City)
The Ciutat Vella encompasses a couple of neighborhoods. The Barri
Gòtic (Gothic Quarter) is where Barcelona was born. Once enclosed by
Roman walls, the barrio gets its name for its collection of 13th- to 15th-
century buildings and medieval atmosphere — it’s the true heart of the
city. La Ribera and its vibrant adjunct El Born, site of innumerable bars,
restaurants, art galleries, and chic shops, are next to the Gothic Quarter.
The Barri Xinés (officially know as the Raval), a historically seedy
neighborhood of prostitutes, beggars, and thieves, is to the west of La
Rambla. Though much improved and an area of large regentrification
projects led by the MACBA Museum, it remains a ramshackle neighbor-
hood characterized by populations of newly arrived immigrants. The
Ciutat Vella vies with the Eixample for the highest concentration of
attractions, but the Old Quarter offers even more restaurants and
nightlife options. Here you’ll find the Catedral, a Gothic landmark and
heart of the neighborhood; the Palau de la Música, a surreal concert
hall designed by a Gaudí contemporary, Domènech i Montaner; Carrer
Montcada, a handsome street of Gothic palaces (one of which is the
Museu Picasso); and Santa María del Mar, an elegant church that’s the
supreme example of the Catalan Gothic style.
La Rambla
Technically part of the Ciutat Vella and one of the world’s most famous
streets, La Rambla (also referred to in the plural, Las Ramblas) overflows
Chapter 10: Barcelona 117

with people, newsstands, bird and flower sellers, and mimes dressed up
like Don Quixote or Greek statues. This boulevard is a great place to
stroll without a care in the world, occasionally ducking into a bar or
restaurant along the way — just like the locals.
La Rambla — especially around Cafe Zurich, where the boulevard 
begins — is the best place in the city for people watching. Most visitors
to Barcelona storm La Rambla as soon as they set down their bags.
Though hotels (and loads of knickknack stores) line the street, I don’t
think it’s the best place to stay — it’s noisy and a little rough-and-tumble
in the wee hours.
On or near the Rambla are the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona’s 
great opera house, recently rebuilt after a horrific fire; the Mercat de la
Boquería, one of Europe’s liveliest food markets; and the Monument à
Colom, the statue of Columbus pointing out to sea, at the end of La
Rambla.
Waterfront
In 1992, Barcelona remembered it was a port city and reoriented itself
back toward the Mediterranean Sea. The city rebuilt the unsightly and
dangerous port. It developed a scenic marina and cleaned up its urban
beaches. Today, the waterfront is one of the prime places to live and
party. You can find most of the city’s new restaurants here, but only one
major hotel. As a base, the area isn’t the most convenient, but it’s great
for shopping and entertaining kids. The beaches are so convenient that
you can spend the morning sightseeing in the Gothic Quarter and the
afternoon swimming in the Mediterranean Sea. Here you’ll find the Vila
Olímpica, a planned neighborhood inaugurated by Olympic athletes 
in 1992; Port Olímpic, a popular port area with even more bars and
restaurants than boats; Platja de Barcelona, the city’s most fashionable
beaches; and Port Vell, the old port transformed into a swank mall, with
restaurants, shops, an aquarium, and an IMAX theater.
Montjuïc
Montjuïc, a mountain whose name means “Hill of the Jews,” offers amaz-
ing views of the city. Olympic TV cameras couldn’t get enough shots of
divers doing half-gainers from high platforms on the hill, the city forming
the backdrop for their twisting, arching bodies. Montjuïc has two top art
museums, the Olympic installations, nice gardens, and an amusement
park for kids, but no hotels or restaurants to speak of. Montjuïc is home
to the Museu d’Art de Catalunya, one of the world’s top collections of
Romanesque art; Estadi Olìmpic, the Olympic stadium; and Fundació
Joan Miró, a museum housing native son Joan Miró’s surrealist works.
Tibidabo
Barcelona’s other mountain provides perhaps even more spectacular
views of the city than Montjuïc — that is, when the smog lifts. You can
take a tram up the mountain to bars and restaurants and look at the sea
Part III: Northern Spain 
118

and the block formation of the modern city. A visit here is best for the
panoramic views at sundown. On the hilltop are the Parc d’Atraccions,
a retro amusement park with great views of the city, and Carretera de les
Aigues, a dirt path that winds along the mountain for several miles — a
great place to stroll, jog, ride bikes, or walk the dog.
Barrios Altos
Barcelona’s upper neighborhoods — Sarrià, Pedralbes, and Gràcia —
were once isolated villages where people had summer homes. Today,
they’re residential areas. By far the biggest attraction is Parc Güell:
Gaudí’s fantastic park city, bathed in mosaics and perfectly integrated
with nature, and one of Barcelona’s must-sees.
Finding information after you arrive
The extremely helpful Turisme de Barcelona, Plaça de Catalunya 17,
underground (% 93-285-38-34), is open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Other
city information bureaus are located on Plaça Sant Jaume, at the airport,
and at the Sants train station. Informació Turística de Catalunya, which
provides information on both the city and the entire autonomous region,
is in Palau Robert, Passeig de Gràcia 107 (% 93-238-40-03). You can also
find tourism information offices at Estació Sants train station and the air-
port. Call % 010 for general visitor information (operators speak English
and other languages) or the tourist information hot line, % 906-30-12-82
(these are both toll numbers). For hotel information, call % 93-285-38-33.
Keep an eye out for roving red-jacketed tourist information officers in
the Gothic Quarter, Passeig de Gràcia, and La Rambla.
Getting Around Barcelona
Hemmed in by mountains and sea, Barcelona is compact and easy to
manage. You can do most everything by Metro (subway) and on foot,
with a few taxis thrown in for convenience, out-of-the-way sights, and
late nights (the Metro stops running right about the time that Barcelona’s
nightlife cranks up). El Eixample is constructed on an easy-to-negotiate
grid system, and the Ciutat Vella is exactly the opposite, a maze of tiny
streets and alleyways.
On foot
Compact Barcelona is ideal for walking. Strolling, especially along the
wide pedestrian sidewalk that runs down the middle of La Rambla, and
the elegant boulevard Passeig de Gràcia, is a pastime ingrained in the
local culture. Barri Gòtic is not only a great place to walk and make dis-
coveries — just don’t panic if you get turned around! — but it’s also so
labyrinthine it’s really only accessible on foot. If you have trouble finding
your way, ask someone to direct you to La Rambla or La Catedral (the
cathedral). From there, you can find your way. To get back and forth
Chapter 10: Barcelona 119

between the Ciutat Vella or the waterfront and the newer part of town,
the Eixample, you’ll want to take public transportation or a taxi.
Look out for people zipping through red lights on motor scooters.
Despite what the law says, pedestrians definitely don’t have the right of
way in Spain. Even on sidewalks you may find yourself dodging annoying
motos (scooters).
By Metro
The Metro (% 010 or 93-298-70-00; www.tmb.net) is Barcelona’s excel-
lent, modern, and clean subway. Its five lines are by far the fastest and
easiest way to navigate the city. (The Metro has begun implementing
trilingual directions and audio — in Spanish, Catalan, and English.) Red
diamond symbols mark stations. (You can find good pocket-size maps 
at all Metro stations.) Single-ticket fares are 1.20€ ($2), although you can
get a T1 pass (good for ten trips) for 6.65€ ($8) — close to half price (see
the “Multitrip transport bargains” sidebar in this chapter for more info).
A one-day Metro and bus pass costs 5€ ($6), and a three-day is 13€ ($16).
You can also get free rides on all public transport with purchase of the
Barcelona Card (see “Exploring Barcelona,” later in this chapter).
The Metro runs Monday to Thursday from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Friday and
Saturday from 5 a.m. to 2 a.m.; holidays from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.; and
Sunday from 6 a.m. to midnight. However, if you want to keep up with
the locals at night, you can’t rely on the Metro. It goes to bed long before
they do.
Besides the Metro, you can also ride something called FGC Trains (% 93-
205-15-15). Run by the provincial government, not the city, these subway
trains share some terminals (it costs the same as the Metro, and you can
pay for it using the same Metro multitrip tickets). Two different FGC lines
connect the city center to the upper neighborhoods and suburbs, includ-
ing Sarrià, Vallvidrera, Tibidado, and Gràcia. The only real problem you
encounter is when you want to switch between an FGC train and a regu-
lar Metro train. To do so, you have to exit the first and reenter the
second — paying separately for each line.
By bus
About 70 bus lines crisscross Barcelona. Though lines and hours are
clearly marked, using the bus isn’t the best option for first-timers. You
may have trouble figuring out where you are, and few bus drivers speak
English. With the subway, you can at least clearly identify your stop.
Buses run Sunday to Thursday from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and
Saturday from 5 a.m. to 2 a.m. (fare is 1.20€, or $1.44). If you don’t have
exact change, by far the best idea is to get a multiticket (T-10) card at
the Metro, which also works on city buses (see the “Multitrip transport
bargains” sidebar in this chapter for more info). Special night buses run
much less frequently (believe me!) from 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. For route
information, call % 010.
Part III: Northern Spain 
120

By taxi
Black-and-yellow taxis are affordable and everywhere. Few journeys cost
more than 6€ ($7). During the day, however, taxis aren’t usually your
best option because traffic is very heavy in the city — you can end up
paying for the pleasure of watching the meter tick. At night, though,
especially if you’ve dined in the Ciutat Vella, taxis are the best way to
return to your hotel or continue with the night (have the restaurant call
a taxi if you don’t feel comfortable waiting for one on the street). You
can either hail a cab in the street (the little green light on the roof means
you can hop in) or get one where they’re lined up (usually outside hotels).
Fares begin at 1.30€ ($1.55; 1.40€/$1.70 at night). Reliable taxi compa-
nies include Servi Taxi (% 93-330-03-00), Barna Taxi (% 93-357-77-55),
and Radio Taxi 033 (% 93-303-30-33).
By car
Trying to negotiate Barcelona’s unfamiliar, traffic-clogged streets can 
put a definite damper on your vacation. Even the calmest drivers lose
their nerve driving in Barcelona, and parking is an expensive nightmare.
However, a car is useful if you plan to head out on day trips to Sitges,
Montserrat, or the Penedès wine country (see “Branching Out from
Barcelona,” later in this chapter), or to travel to the Costa Brava and
Girona (see Chapter 11).
By funicular
Funiculars (cable cars) run up some of the hills around the city, such as
Montjuïc; other slopes are fitted with outdoor escalators to ease your
way. The Montjuïc cable car remained closed in 2006 for repairs.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 121
Multitrip transport bargains
Your best value options for traveling around Barcelona are bargain-basement multi-
tickets for the Metro and buses. You can purchase these tarjetas (tickets) in auto-
mated Metro ticket offices, estancos (tobacco shops on the street), newspaper kiosks,
and branches of the La Caixa and Caixa de Catalunya banks. The best deal is the T-10,
good for ten trips on all Metros and the bus (6.65€/$8); several passengers can share
the same ticket. Travel cards (for one–five days) are also available for unlimited travel
for one person on Metro, FGC, and buses: a one-day pass is 5€ ($6); a three-day is

Multiday passes only make sense if you’re spending several days zigzagging around
the city on public transport. Besides, much of what you want to see in Barcelona is
best done on foot. Call % 010 or 93-298-70-00 for further information or visit the Web

Staying in Style
Barcelona went nuts building and refurbishing hotels in time for the 1992
Olympics, and more than a decade later new hotels are still sprouting up
all over the city to meet the city’s ever-growing demand. You can find an
amazing assortment of hotels, ranging from ones in historic moderniste
buildings to others showing off the latest in the cutting-edge design for
which the city is known. Across the board, you have to shell out more
money for accommodations in Barcelona than you do in most parts of
Spain, though a few very good value hotels have recently been inaugu-
rated. I hesitate to recommend some of the cheaper places, because
they’re mostly located in areas that — even if pretty safe on the whole —
may seem a little scary to you if you’re unfamiliar with the city. For an
explanation on the price breakdowns that I use in this book, see the
Introduction.
Most of Barcelona’s top attractions, restaurants, and nightlife are con-
centrated in El Eixample, around La Rambla, and in the Ciutat Vella, so
that’s probably where you want to stay. Although many visitors choose
to stay on or near the Rambla, it can prove to be a very noisy choice.
Most mid- to upscale-level hotels are either along La Rambla or in El
Eixample.

The Catalan país
Catalans have long referred to their native Catalonia (Catalunya), one of the
autonomous regions of Spain, as un país — literally, a nation — sometimes leading to
confusion among visitors who know little about this fiercely independent and pros-
perous region and its occasionally testy relationship with the rest of Spain. Voters
approved a referendum in 2006 that granted Catalans much greater autonomy than
any other region over their political, judicial, and economic affairs; the adopted text
also crucially (to both proponents and detractors) refers to Catalonia as a “nation.”
Some opponents of the measure, supported by Spanish President José Luis Rodgíguez
Zapatero, fear that it may lead to a “Balkanization” of Spain. Catalans contend that
their homeland has always been more European — by that they mean more
Continental — than the rest of Spain. You’ll likely notice a different temperament, pace,
and attitude—as well as language—in Barcelona and the region. Although you can
find bullfights and the occasional tourist-oriented flamenco show, Barcelona really
isn’t the place for such quintessentially Spanish arts. The city stubbornly takes pride
in its unique cultural identity. You may see T-shirts being sold on La Rambla that pro-
claim “Catalonia is not Spain,” and hear shopkeepers responding to Spanish-speak-
ers only in Catalan. Although some residents might prefer that Barcelona were the
capital of an independent, Catalan-speaking nation, mostly these hard-working people
have long been frustrated that so much of the region’s wealth is rerouted to Madrid and
less prosperous parts of Spain.

Barcelona doesn’t really have a high and low travel season; hotel rates
remain relatively constant throughout the year, though some hotels offer
slightly lower prices when Barcelonans escape the city in droves (during
Easter, the month of August, and Christmas).
Turisme de Barcelona operates a hotel-booking service online and at its
office in Plaça de Catalunya (% 93-285-38-34; www.hotelsbcn.com).
The service concentrates on last-minute (same-day) bookings.

Cituat Vella (Barri Gòtic)
At the edge of the Gothic Quarter and just across the street from the water-
front, this handsome, sedate, small hotel (44 rooms) is, along with the
Prestige Paseo de Gracia (see review later in this section), my favorite new
place to stay in Barcelona. The location is perfect for walks along the Moll
de la Fusta promenade and is within walking distance from restaurants in
the port and Las Ramblas. Housed in a lovingly restored 19th-century
palace, it’s elegant and intimate, but also supremely relaxed. It boasts a
bonus feature that few hotels can lay claim to: a large rooftop solarium ter-
race with an attractive little pool and commanding views of the waterfront
and port. It also has a very nice full restaurant, another surprise for a small
hotel. Accommodations are luxurious and warm, chic but not coldly
“drunk on design” as many aspiring design hotels are in Barcelona. Rooms
with sea views are more expensive, but interior rooms are quieter. Check
online for packages and special deals (including doubles as low as
135€/$162).

Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Waterfront (Port Vell)
Looming out in the Barcelona port like a giant cruise ship, this large, styl-
ish luxury hotel occupies part of the massive World Trade Center, at the
end of a long walkway parallel to the new Ramblas bridge leading to the
Port Vell. The views from many rooms, looking back across the water at
the city as it climbs into the hills, are nothing short of incredible, and
something no other hotel can offer. Popular with business travelers and
vacationers on luxury cruises, it’s the perfect place to take advantage of
Barcelona’s waterfront, with the lower Ramblas and Gothic Quarter both
within easy walking distance. Rooms are elegant, with a chic modern
design and top-shelf bathrooms. Public areas show off an excellent col-
lection of works by Catalan painters and sculptors. On the rooftop terrace,
a small pool, gym, and Jacuzzi remain a well-kept secret, though the incred-
ible buffet breakfast seems to escape no one’s attention. An added bonus

Cituat Vella (Barri Gòtic)
One of the best developments on the Spanish hotel scene in recent years
is the appearance of this small, Barcelona-based hotel chain, which has
installed several handsome and stylish — and, most important, very rea-
sonably priced — small and midsize hotels in the Catalan capital and a
handful of spots across the country. By far, the best thing about this inti-
mate hotel (just 37 rooms) is its prized location. It occupies a historic
building on one of the most atmospheric streets in the Gothic Quarter,
near the emblematic Plaça del Pi and a short walk from the cathedral. The
rooms are reasonably sized and feature the cleanly stylish look that seems
de rigueur in Barcelona. Check online for offers (as low as 90€, or $108) for
certain dates.

Waterfront (Vila Olímpica)
Barcelona has only two legitimate skyscrapers, and this high-tech, high-
rise structure is one of them. Built for the 1992 Olympics but not opened
until 1994 (oops!), the Arts is on the beach in the heart of the Vila Olímpica
(Olympic Village). Don’t expect to find any old-world flavor here, but
rather the ultimate in sophistication and privacy. The pastel-colored
rooms are light and airy with incredible views of the Mediterranean Sea
and the city. The luxurious bathrooms, with sit-down showers and family-
size tubs, are larger than most compact cars. Of course, to live like a king
you need royal pockets. A Ritz-Carlton hotel, this is the hands-down
favorite of most Americans.

Parellada restaurant next door, this place is perfect for people with tons of
style but not a huge budget. Rooms are small but very cool with a chic
monochromatic design. Though it’s convenient for sightseeing and dining,
it’s not ideal for anyone who’s averse to crowds and a bit of noise; partic-
ularly on weekend nights, this area is overrun with revelers spilling out of
bars and restaurants.

Hotel Claris
$$$$–$$$$$
Eixample
Behind the 19th-century palace facade and the for-guests-only museum of
Egyptian art is a surprise: one of the most modern, design-oriented hotels
in Spain. High-tech elevators cruise to the rooms overlooking an interior
foyer. Rooms, many of which are split-level and even two-story, are a mix
of cool chic and warm sophistication: They have parquet floors, bold color
schemes (for example, royal purple), rich fabrics, and furnishings that
combine antiques and Catalan design. Each room has original artwork,
often a beautiful Nepalese, Indian, or Egyptian piece. The top-floor terrace,
which has a small pool, offers sweet views of the surrounding Eixample
neighborhood. Although some newcomers have challenged it in the hip-
design category, the Claris remains very popular with fashionistas, film
and TV people, and architects.

Hotel Constanza

Eixample
If you’re looking for a dose of Barcelona’s legendary style but at an afford-
able price, this boutique hotel may be the answer. It has just 20 rooms;
although they’re not huge, they’re fashionably sleek and very comfortable,
with leather trim, plush pillows, and sparkling bathrooms, and the hotel’s
very nicely located (short walking distance of Plaça de Catalunya) for the
bargain rates. In essence, it’s like the excellent Prestige Paseo de Gracia
(see below), but on a much tighter budget.

rooms are large and formal. Some rooms have marble fireplaces, and, befit-
ting an emperor, a select few offer Roman-style baths with rich mosaics.

Prestige Paseo de Gracia
$$$$
Eixample
An exquisite new small hotel (45 rooms) smack on Barcelona’s swankest
boulevard, Paseo de Gracia, this chic place exudes cool. The minimalist
rooms have a Zen-like tranquillity, and some have their own quiet and
beautiful bamboo garden terraces. The hotel plays the chic, minimalist
design card, which is by now de rigueur in Barcelona. It has soothing bath-
rooms and a well-thought-out, detail-oriented layout — including every-
thing from flowers to intelligent lighting. Extras include a hip “Zeroom”
lounge for listening to music and reading, and Bang & Olufsen TVs. For this
level of style and comfort, the hotel is a good value, especially given its
pricey location.

Barrios Altos (Tibidabo)
Barcelona’s most unique hotel is this stunning and tiny inn (just four
rooms) inhabiting a perfectly restored 1900 seigniorial palace — once a
summer residence of a wealthy city-dweller — perched on Tibidabo, the
hill high above Barcelona. In the mid-’90s I used to live up in this neigh-
borhood, called Vallvidrera, and I never tired of the unparalleled views that
extend all the way to the sea. If you’re looking for a bit of romance during
your stay in Barcelona, you won’t find a better place to stay. Every room
in the house looks as if it has been ripped from the pages of a chic design
magazine. More luxurious than any of the city’s top-dollar luxury hotels,
including the Arts and Claris, it certainly isn’t inexpensive, but it qualifies
as a relative bargain. The marvelous views and cool air come at a price,
however; although you can ride the charming public transportation in the
form of an old train that climbs the hill, the Relais d’Orsà is rather incon-
venient for dining and sightseeing, and no restaurant is on the premises
(though a breakfast fit for a king and queen is served overlooking the pool,
with the whole of Barcelona at your feet). However, if tranquillity and a
privileged location above the fray are what you seek, you can do no better.

This place has bargain design for travelers with a sense of style

two popular locations on the seedier side of the Rambla, Hostal Gat Xino
caters to ex-backpackers and young families. Rooms are spare, with a bright
green, white, and black aesthetic, and there are hip photographs and flat-

open-air deck is a good spot to soak up some sun and meet up with fellow
travelers from around the globe and trade info on hotspots. The other loca-

hotels in Barcelona. Although other hotels in the Eixample are better
located, it’s just a few blocks from the top of Rambla de Catalunya and

hotels with such a prestigious address — is in the middle of the Quadrat

Dining Out
Catalans love to eat and love to eat out, and they enjoy one of the best
and most imaginative cuisines in all of Spain. Barcelona’s stature as a
dining capital has really exploded in the past few years, as a number of
highly creative young chefs have made it perhaps second only to San
Sebastián for fine dining. What you’ll find across the city are market-
fresh ingredients and Mediterranean dishes with a flourish. In addition
to haute cuisine (cocina de autor), you’ll also find the traditional rustic
dishes that have nourished Catalans for centuries. Most restaurants are
in the Ciutat Vella and Eixample, though the most popular new dining
area is along the waterfront and in the new port.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 131
Eating and drinking like a Catalan
Basic Catalan cooking is equal parts Mediterranean and mountain — well prepared
but with little stuffiness. So expect fresh seafood, all i oli (garlic and virgin olive oil), pro-
duce from the countryside, and setas (wild mushrooms) — an object of obsession for
people all over Catalonia. The basis of rustic Catalan food is pa amb tomàquet, liter-
ally, bread and tomato. But I’m not talking bread, mayo, and beefsteak tomatoes. Pa
amb tomàquet are long slices of rustic bread rubbed with halves of beautiful fresh
tomatoes, doused with virgin olive oil, and sprinkled with salt. Another typical Catalan
dish is espinacs a la catalana, which is spinach prepared with pine nuts, raisins,
bacon, oil, and garlic. Others you may run across include escudella (Catalan stew);
suquet de peix (fish and shellfish soup); butifarra (white Catalan sausage, often with
white beans) and fuet (long, dry sausage); fideus (long, thin noodles with pork,
sausage, and red pepper); escalivada (grilled peppers, eggplant, tomato, and onion);
and amanida (salad with meat, fish, shellfish, and cheese). For dessert, try crema cata-
lana, an egg custard with a crisp layer of grilled sugar on top.
Catalunya is best known, perhaps, for its sparkling wines, called cava. You may have
heard of Freixenet and Codorníu, the two top-selling cavas (sparkling wines) in the
world. Both are from Penedès, just a half-hour from Barcelona. Cava is a perfect
accompaniment to the seafood and lighter fare that you can enjoy in Barcelona. Big,
expensive boutique red wines from Priorat have become very trendy; though pricey,
Clos Mogador, Vall Llach, and L’Ermita are among the best wines being produced in
Spain. But several other regions in the province, such as Penedès, Empordà, Costers
del Segre, and Montsant, also produce excellent red and white wines that are worthy
rivals to better-known Riojas and Riberas. Be on the lookout for such producers as
Torres, Jean León, Castell de Perelada, and Capçanes.
For more on Spanish dining customs, including mealtimes, costs, and tipping, see
Chapter 2.

Because Barcelona is only 145km (90 miles) from the French border,
plenty of restaurants specialize in French cuisine; regional Spanish
cuisines, such as Basque, are also popular. (Basque tapas bars pop up
like the wild mushrooms that Catalans love so much; for more on
Basque culinary arts, see Chapter 12.) About the only difficulty you may
have eating your way across Barcelona is ordering at the handful of
restaurants that feature menus printed only in Catalan.
Although Barcelona natives aren’t quite as addicted to tapas as their
brethren in the Basque Country and Madrid, you should spend at least
one evening doing a tapeo, or tapas-bar crawl, in the Old City, washing
down your finger foods with glasses of cava (sparkling wine) or local
Penedés or Priorat wines.

CATALAN HAUTE CUISINE
A centerpiece of the happening Born restaurant scene, Àbac has quickly
become one of the top dining experiences in Barcelona, and the chef,
Xavier Pellicer, one of the best-known in the city. Slick and self-assured,
with generous space between the few tables and more waiters than diners,
this place takes haute cuisine (cocina de autor) and high design seriously.
From baby squid in dried-fruit sauce to an unbelievable tuna Provençal,
everything is delightful and exceedingly well prepared. Details are impor-

sive. The restaurant boasts both cheese and cigar carts.

Botafumeiro

Eixample
SEAFOOD
One of the king of Spain’s favorite restaurants (his preferred table is on
the second floor), this longtime classic is still the place for perfectly pre-
pared seafood. In direct contrast to the influx of chic, minimalist, and cut-
ting-edge restaurants, it’s large, informal, and often a little rambunctious.
Much of the incredibly fresh seafood is flown in daily from Galicia, the
owner’s hometown. The shellfish are amazing, and the long seafood bar
has repeatedly been named the best in Spain (you can make a great meal
of seafood tapas here, and even keep costs down if you’re conscientious).
Because Botafumeiro doesn’t close after lunch, go at off hours — 1 p.m.
for lunch and 7:30 p.m. for dinner. It’s the only time you’ll be able to walk
in and get a table — or even a seat at the bar — if you haven’t reserved a
table well in advance.

Barri Gòtic/Waterfront
SEAFOOD
I try never to miss a visit to Barcelona without dining at least once at Cal
Pep, a tiny, bustling, and magical seafood restaurant that serves the fresh-
est specials of the day anywhere. The restaurant has no menu, and virtu-
ally no tables (just four in back); everyone sits at the long bar and waits
for Pep, the gravelly voiced owner with the funky eyeglasses, to recom-
mend whatever’s fresh off the boats and out of the markets. Wait patiently
for a table and let Pep guide you (something he’s eminently capable of,
even if shared language amounts to hand signals). Though you may be in
for a long wait—the place just gets more and more popular—you won’t be
sorry, and prices are pretty reasonable given the phenomenal quality. A
classic Barcelona experience.

Housed on the first floor of one of Antoni Gaudí’s earliest but still emblem-
atic apartment buildings (with the oldest elevator in Barcelona), this
restaurant’s sumptuous white-brick and stained-glass moderniste décor
alone is enough to recommend a visit. The welcome surprise is that it’s an
excellent and fairly priced restaurant serving creative contemporary
Catalan cuisine. Give the Galician oyster raviolis in champagne a whirl.
Dining at Casa Calvet is a great, nontouristy way to get up close and per-
sonal with a moderniste classic and dine exceedingly well at the same time.

CREATIVE CATALAN/TAPAS
The Born district has exploded with trendy restaurants and bars, but this
spot, which puts creativity and elegance into that Spanish staple, tapas,
continues to be one of the city’s coolest places to dine. The kitchen is the
work of Carles Abellán, who has quickly become one of Barcelona’s hottest
young chefs. Here he’s essentially created tapas de autor, and there’s a
great bit of theater in his preparations. The bold colors and chic stylings
of the restaurant, which feels like an industrial-flavored club (it’s in an old
salting house), lend the perfect backdrop. The theater begins with a series
of “snacks” served in sardine tins. Everything I’ve tasted here is worthy of
recommendation; some dishes are more playful, others more traditional.
On my last visit, a companion and I ordered seven plates between the two
of us, which was plenty, but I couldn’t resist finishing with the thin slices
of entrecote served with cippolino onions and tiny mushrooms. It was one
of the most straightforward dishes we tried, but probably the best.

Toasting your trip with cava
Tapas bars are everywhere in Spain, but a Catalan specialty is the champagne bar,
called a xampanyería. These bars serve cava (sparkling wine) as well as tapas.

sparkling wine. A few good bars serving local wines and plenty of Catalan cava are the

Barcelona features a host of clean, crisp cavas on the wine list.

are quite audacious, covering a surprising taste spectrum. Anyone unsure
of constructing a meal from desserts only can add a savory dish, such as
magret of duck or ginger couscous to one of the dessert menus. Combining
wines with desserts can be a little tricky; Catalan cava (sparkling wine) is
a brilliant choice.

CONTEMPORARY CATALAN
Barcelona’s new fascination with restaurants featuring cocina de autor (cre-

informal restaurant run by a young team. On a tiny side street just north
of the Diagonal shopping drag, it’s a slender, predominantly white dining
room colored with splashes of red, like the single roses on the wall. Hisop
has creative and even trendy impulses — seen in such items as palate-
cleansing sorbets of goat cheese and green pepper corn — but it’s never
haughty. Main courses such as a lovely hake and superb beef tenderloin
with mushrooms, and a terrific selection of cheeses for dessert, bring
things back to earth. The tasting menu is excellent and very fairly priced
(and the chef even allows substitutions!).

garde design and cutting-edge cooking. Fresh grilled fish of the day is
succulent, but what truly distinguishes this restaurant are the daring
dishes, full of surprises for the senses: a deconstructed potato tortilla,
green beans with squid “noodles” and mint, barnacles with a sea water
sorbet. The tasting menu is a terrific way to sample the chef’s repertoire.

268-99-18), is tucked inside the brand-new, wildly colorful and cool
Mercat Santa Caterina, a produce, flowers, and fresh fish-and-meat
market. It’s a large, open spot offering a wide variety of cuisines,
from Asian and vegetarian to Mediterranean, all at very fair prices.
It’s great for a full meal, early breakfast, or late snacks.
 Inopia, Tamarit 104 (Eixample Esquerra; % 93-424-52-31), is a new,
hip tapas joint, but it calls itself a “classic bar.” Indeed, that’s the
vibe of this brightly lit, frenetic place, the brainchild of the brother
of famed experimental chef Ferran Adrià (of El Bulli; see Chapter 11
for a complete review). But little bro does something much more
traditional with his classic, winning Spanish and Catalan tapas. 
The patatas bravas (spicy fried potatoes) and croquetas caseras de
jamón ibérico (croquettes stuffed with Spanish ham) are on most
tapas menus, but are rarely this tasty. It’s a bit off the main
Eixample grid (west of Av. Paral.lel), but worth the short taxi ride.
 Irati, Casanyes 17 (Barri Gòtic; % 93-302-30-84), a bustling Basque
tapas tavern just off La Rambla, is always at standing-room-only
capacity. The tapas (or pintxos, in the Basque language) are set out
on the bar, and they keep coming. Keep track of how many you eat
(by the number of toothpicks you collect) and pay when you’re
done.
 La Bodegueta, Rambla de Catalunya 100 (Eixample; % 93-215-48-
94), is a classic wine tavern from the 1940s; though easy to miss
(it’s a simple step-down bar next to the chic clothing store Groc),
it’s ideal for a small snack and a glass of wine or cava.
 Tapaç 24, Diputació 269 (Eixample; % 93-488-09-77), is the infor-
mal spin-off of the stylish Comerç 24, one of the hippest restaurants
in Barcelona (see review above). This below-street-level bar near La
Pedrera mimics a seafood shack, and the tapas are every bit as
fresh and delectable as they’d be at a beachside spot with Carles
Abellán behind the grill. The little plates here are zesty and fun,
with just the right touch of creativity. I’m still dreaming about the
bikini de espárragos al pesto (sandwich of fresh green asparagus in
pesto) that I had there recently.

Exploring Barcelona
Barcelona has a greater diversity of things to see and do than any other
city in Spain (something folks from Madrid may be loath to admit). When
visiting, concentrate your time on distinct neighborhoods, which is how
I lay out the attractions in this section. The works of Gaudí and his imag-
inative moderniste cohorts and the lively Rambla Boulevard are perhaps
the city’s most obvious highlights, but the rich medieval Gothic Quarter,
with its Picasso Museum and enticing little corners, and the newly
dynamic waterfront are also huge draws. Apart from those sites,
Barcelona ranks among Europe’s great strolling cities, with secluded
plazas, open-air cafes, tree-lined boulevards, and an inexhaustible
supply of nooks where you can stop and have coffee, a beer, or tapas
during your meanderings.
If you’re planning to wear out your shoes sightseeing in Barcelona, you
may want to get a discount card offered by the city tourism office.
Available in versions of one to five days, the Barcelona Card offers free
public transportation and discounts of up to 50 percent at 100 sites in
the city, including museums, bars, shops, and restaurants. The Museu
Picasso, La Pedrera, La Sagrada Familia, Museu Nacional d’Art de
Catalunya (MNAC), and Fundació Joan Miró are all included, as well as
the Aerobus to the airport. The 24-hour card includes a free ten-journey
travel card for the Metro and bus, and the 48- and 72-hour cards include
a pass offering unlimited travel on the Metro and bus. Cards cost 23€
($28) for two days and 28€ ($34) for three days. Rates for children
between ages 4 and 12 are 4€ ($4.80) less at each level. You can pur-
chase the Barcelona Card at Turisme de Barcelona information offices
in Plaça de Catalunya, Plaça de Sant Jaume, Estació de Sants (Sants
Railway Station), Corte Inglés stores, Casa Battló, and the Barcelona
Nord bus station, as well as online (which nets you a 10 percent dis-
count). For more information, call % 93-285-38-32.
The top attractions
Manzana de la Discórdia
Eixample
The so-called Block of Discord, a single block of the chic shopping boule-
vard Passeig de Gràcia 35–43 (between Aragó and Consell de Cent), is the
best place for a crash course on moderniste architecture. At No. 35 is Casa
Lleó Morera, a gorgeously ornate corner house built in 1906 by Lluís
Domènech i Montaner, a serious rival to Gaudí. The house, which features
an upscale leather-goods purveyor on the ground floor, has suffered more
ill-conceived alterations over the years than almost any other moderniste
work. Domènech i Montaner also built the acclaimed Palau de la Música
Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau, among many other notable buildings in
Barcelona, and many critics judge him to be the greatest of all moderniste
architects. Up the block, on the same side of the street (No. 41), is the bril-
liant Casa Amatller (1900), a creation of the architect Puig i Cadafalch. The
Part III: Northern Spain

medieval-looking facade, topped by a distinctive Flemish-style roof, dis-
plays beautiful carved stone and ironwork of themes related to the choco-
late business and other pursuits of the original owners. Children have a
ball identifying all the figures. Unfortunately, the interior of the house can’t
be visited.
Next door, at No. 43, is the extraordinary Casa Batlló (1906), a true crowd-
pleaser among Gaudí buildings (though Gaudí in fact only remodeled the
existing structure, reshaping its interior with fanciful and ingenious sig-
nature elements and adding a fantastic face-lift to the exterior). The facade
glimmers with fragments of colorful ceramics, the roof curves like the blue-
green scales of a dragon’s back, and the balconies evoke either carnaval-
esque masks or menacing monster jaws. Casa Batlló is now owned by the
company that produces Chupa Chups, Spain’s famous lollipops, and it
often rents the house out for corporate dinners and even weddings. The
house’s interior is now open to the public for tours with audioguides 
(% 93-216-03-06; daily 9 a.m.–8 p.m.; 16€/$19).
For a moderniste bonus, look around the corner (Aragó 225) at the Fundació
Antoni Tàpies (% 93-487-03-15; www.fundaciotapies.org; Tues–Sun 10
a.m.–8 p.m.; 4.20€, or $5; also part of ArTicket joint admission; see the
“Museum deals and freebies” sidebar in this chapter), a museum dedicated
to the works of the contemporary Catalan painter Antoni Tàpies. The build-
ing, a former publishing headquarters, is another splendid example of mod-
erniste architecture by Domènech i Montaner. The giant tangle of steel on
the roof is a once-controversial sculpture (it has now been accepted by most
Barcelonans) called Cloud and Chair by Tàpies. Allow about an hour (more
if you’re a fan of contemporary art and want to visit the Tàpies museum and
library in depth).
Palau de la Música
Eixample
Domènech i Montaner’s magnificent music hall (1908) is so over-the-top
ornate that it may take you some time to appreciate it. After my first visit,

(MNAC). For tickets and more information, call % 93-285-38-32; you can also pur-

I was shocked; after attending my second concert, I had begun to like it; by
my third, I was in love with the place and attended shows I wasn’t even
that interested in just to have another chance to bask in its splendor. It’s
surely the trippiest music hall you’ll ever see. Apartment buildings hem in
the Palau tightly (though a nondescript church next door was demolished
to give the hall greater breathing space), and the relatively sedate exterior
does little to prepare you for what’s inside. The interior is a wild fantasy
of ceramics, colored glass, and carved pumice and is crowned by an enor-
mous yellow, blue, and green stained-glass dome that looks like a swollen
raindrop. The Palau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is indisputably one of
Barcelona’s moderniste masterpieces. If you can’t manage to see a per-
formance, you can take a guided tour, which I highly recommend. The tour
lasts about an hour.

Parc Güell

This whimsical open-air park, another of Gaudí’s signature creations, is
removed from El Eixample but still relatively easy to reach (you can take
the bus, but visiting by taxi is easiest and quickest). Envisioned as a hous-
ing development for Gaudí’s faithful patron, Eusebi Güell, the garden city

A moderniste treasure hunt
Barcelona is so littered with Catalan Art Nouveau sights that keeping track of them
all can prove difficult. The city’s Ruta del Modernisme (Modernist Route) gives you a
hand and a wealth of information about more than 100 landmarks. For 12€ ($14) you
receive a guidebook with a map of sites and up to 50 percent admission discounts,
good at the moderniste buildings that allow visits (including La Sagrada Familia, Palau
de la Música Catalana, Fundació Tàpies, La Pedrera, Palau Güell, the Casa-Museu
Gaudí at Parc Güell, and Museu de la Música). You tour on your own, though guided
visits are mandatory if you visit Casa Lleó Morera, Palau de la Música, Palau Güell, or
Museu d’Art Modern. The complete tour would probably take a full week or more, but
even if you only hit the highlights, the pass pays for itself after just a few stops. The
route includes all of Barcelona’s celebrated landmarks as well as the landmarks you
may otherwise overlook. Since trying to see the entire collection would be pretty over-
whelming, check out my suggestions on a handful of other moderniste sights — a
second tier, if you will — in “Finding more cool things to see and do,” in this chapter.

was never fully realized. Gaudí originally planned to design every detail of
the 60 houses; however, only one was finished, in which Gaudí lived as he
struggled to complete the project (it now houses the small Casa-Museu
Gaudí). The parts that Gaudí did finish — in fact, his talented disciple,
Josep María Jujol, executed most of what you see — resemble an idiosyn-
cratic theme park, with a mosaic-covered lizard fountain, Hansel and
Gretel pagodas, and magically undulating park benches swathed in broken
pieces of ceramics, called trencadis. Gaudí was so intent on the commu-
nity’s total integration into nature that he inserted part of it into a hill, con-
structing a forest of columns that look remarkably like tree trunks. On
clear days, you can see much of Barcelona, making out the spires of
Gaudí’s La Sagrada Familia and the twin towers on the beach. Although
the park doesn’t include much required sightseeing to check off a list, you
can easily linger for hours on end, especially if you have children in tow.
Allow at least one hour to take in the full flavor of the park.

La Pedrera (Casa Milà)
Eixample
Gaudí’s unfinished church, La Sagrada Familia, leaves jaws agape, but the
architect’s most fascinating and inspired civic work — and perhaps the
crowning glory of modernisme — is Casa Milà, named after the patrons
who allowed him to carry through with such an avant-garde apartment
building back in 1910. The masterpiece is known to almost all as La
Pedrera, which means “stone quarry” — a reference to its immense lime-
stone facade.
The massive exterior undulates like ocean waves on Passeig de Gràcia and
around the corner onto Provença street; on the roof is a set of chimneys
that look like the inspiration for Darth Vader. On the first floor (near the
entrance on Provença) is a great exhibition space for temporary art shows.
The building received a head-to-toe face-lift in the mid-1990s. The apart-
ments inside had suffered unspeakable horrors, and Gaudí’s beautiful
arched attics had been sealed up, but the painstaking restoration has
revealed its author’s genius in new ways. The attic floor is now a high-tech
Gaudí museum (Espai Gaudí), with cool interactive exhibits, terrific slide
shows, and access to the roof, where you can hang out with the warrior
chimneys (which, according to some, represent Christians and Moors bat-
tling for Spanish turf). Both the kid-friendly, fast-paced museum and the
rooftop will be unqualified hits with children.
One of the original Gaudí apartments — all with odd shapes, handcrafted
doorknobs, and idiosyncratic details — has now been opened to the public.
The apartment, called El Pis in Catalan, is meticulously outfitted with
period furniture, including many pieces of Gaudí’s design. For the entire
visit, which includes museum, apartment, and rooftop, allow a minimum of
Chapter 10: Barcelona 143

two hours (though visitors have hung out, mesmerized, on the roof until
they’re kicked out!).
Be sure to check out the art exhibits held in another part of La Pedrera, the
Centro Cultural Caixa Catalunya. The handsome exhibit space hosts shows
by major international contemporary artists, such as Isamu Noguchi and
Anthony Caro.
An added bonus at La Pedrera is the scheduled flamenco, opera, and jazz
concerts (called La Pedrera de Nit) on the fantastic roof Friday and
Saturday nights from July to the end of September. A combined ticket
(12€/$15, with a drink included) allows access to the three building attrac-
tions and the concert, and includes a complimentary glass of Catalan cava.
It’s a splendid way to experience this moderniste landmark.

La Sagrada Familia
Eixample
Barcelona’s landmark is Antoni Gaudí’s unfinished legacy and testament
to his singular vision, the art of the impossible. Hordes of people come to
gawk at this mind-altering creation, and it’s not anywhere near comple-
tion. Begun in 1884 after Gaudí took over from another architect — who
was making an ordinary Gothic cathedral — the father of modernisme
transformed the project with his fertile imagination. Even though Gaudí
abandoned all other works to devote his life to this cathedral, which would
be the world’s largest if completed, he knew he could never finish it in his
lifetime. Although he surely intended for future generations to add their
signatures (he left only general plans), he probably didn’t plan on resign-
ing from the project when he did: Gaudí was run over by a tram in 1926.
The eight bejeweled spires (plans called for 12, one for each of Jesus’s dis-
ciples) drip like melting candlesticks. Virtually every square inch of the
surface explodes with intricate spiritual symbols. Love it or hate it, you
can’t deny that the church is the work of a unique visionary. A private foun-
dation works furiously to finish the church, and although construction
recently reached the halfway point, at present it remains only a facade
(though indisputably, it’s one wonderful, otherworldly facade).
Completion is projected for 2035, though protests continue from many
who believe it should be left unfinished, as a memorial to Gaudí. The
Barcelona sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs’s additions on the west side
depicting the life of Christ have been derided as disastrous kitsch, but
even the staunchest detractors have little choice now but to live with the
notion of a Sagrada Familia considerably changed.
Part III: Northern Spain 
144

The best stuff at La Sagrada Familia is what you see on the outside. If
you’re on a budget or pressed for time, your trip to Barcelona won’t be too
much the poorer if you skip going in and save your 8€; the inside is hol-
lowed out. What you miss if you don’t go in is an elevator to the top for the
(admittedly excellent) views and a fairly skimpy museum, which pales in
comparison to the one at Gaudí’s other masterpiece, La Pedrera apartment
building. Of course, your money does contribute to the continued con-
struction of the church, so you may want to stake out your position on its
proposed completion. If you only want to see the outside, you can do so
in 20 minutes; otherwise, allow about an hour.
La Sagrada Familia is prime turf for thieves relieving tourists of their
belongings, because most visitors are too busy looking bug-eyed at the
sky. Someone offering you a carnation may have an accomplice eyeing
your camera or wallet. See tips on safety in the appendix.

Strolling La Rambla
Victor Hugo extolled Barcelona’s La Rambla as “the most beautiful street
in the world,” and the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca said it was the
“only street he wished would never end.” La Rambla (also referred to as
“Las Ramblas”) is much more than an attractive street; it’s an inter-
minable street parade. With its variety of people, vendors, markets, and
historic buildings, La Rambla is the perfect introduction to the city, an
intriguing and occasionally uplifting expression of life in Barcelona.
Many locals practice the fine art of the paseo (stroll) every day of their
lives along this mile-long pedestrian avenue.
La Rambla is a feast of sounds, smells, and activity. Subdivided into five
separate ramblas, each of different character and attractions, are a suc-
cession of newspaper kiosks, fresh flower stands, bird sellers, and
mimes (or human statues) in elaborately conceived costumes and face
paint hoping for a few stray euros. La Rambla may turn out to be the

Baby Jesus, wise men, and . . . who’s that?
Barcelona’s flair for the unusual and whimsical is more than apparent in its avant-
garde moderniste architecture. But nothing seems odder than the caganer, a figure
who creeps into most nativity scenes at Christmas time. The little guy, outfitted with a
traditional red Catalan peasant’s cap, appears squatting down in the straw and . . .
defecating. He’s not meant to cause offense; locals explain that he’s a symbol of the
fertile earth. Despite the figure’s serious roots, today you can find the caganer 
marketed in all kinds of variations (priests, nuns, Bart Simpson — all assuming the
position).

highlight of your trip to Barcelona (to ensure that it is, keep a keen eye
on your bag and camera). You can walk the length of La Rambla in a 
half-hour, but allow a couple of hours if you want to make pit stops for
refreshments, shopping, and exploring along the way.
Begin your stroll at the very top of La Rambla, near Plaça de Catalunya,
where you can find a number of chairs that are usually filled with older
men talking about fútbol and Spanish politics. To sit in a chair, you have
to part with a few coins — they’re for rent. The water gurgling from the
Calanetes Fountain that’s on the upper Rambla is safe to drink and is
said to confer instant “native of Barcelona” status to its drinkers.
Farther down La Rambla is a noisy bird market. Continuing toward the
water, you come upon bustling flower stalls. Keep an eye out for a gor-
geous moderniste bakery, Escribà, at Antiga Casa Figeras, Rambla 83, on
the right side. Another notable moderniste building to look for is the
Farmacia Genové at Rambla 77. Nearby is one of the highlights of La
Rambla, La Boquería food market. If you aren’t already suffering from
sensory overload, take a detour in here to see and smell an amazingly
lively scene: the selling, slicing, and dicing of fresh fish, meats, produce,
and just about everything your tummy wants. If you begin to feel intense
hunger pains, hunt down tiny, legendary Bar Pinotxo inside the market
for excellent tapas.
If you have a taste for the unusual, drop into the Museu de l’Eròtica, at
La Rambla 96 bis 9, across from the Boquería (% 93-318-98-65; www.
erotica-museum.com; daily June–Sept 10 a.m.–midnight, Oct–May 
10 a.m.–9 p.m.; 7.50€, or $9), a museum dedicated to the expressions,
instruments, and whims of human sexuality.
Back on La Rambla is Gran Theatre del Liceu, La Rambla 51–59 (% 93-
485-99-14), Barcelona’s great opera house that went up in flames in 1994
and reopened five years later (it’s now a marvel of modern technology,
though the city went to great lengths to preserve the seductive look and
feel of the original). The international opera stars José Carreras and
Montserrat Caballé, both from Barcelona, paid their dues at the Liceu
(lee-seh-oo), which was founded in 1874. Full guided tours, including
visits to the private Cercle del Liceu, are available daily at 10 a.m.
(8.50€, or $10 for adults, free for children younger than 10); “quick
visits” (that don’t include entry to the Cercle del Liceu) are held daily at
11:30 a.m., noon, and 1 p.m. (3.50€, or $4.20, for adults, free for children
younger than 10).
Gracing the middle of La Rambla is a large mosaic by Joan Miró, and
across the street is a great 19th-century cafe-bar, Café de la Opera, La
Rambla 74, long a gathering spot for opera-goers and literary types and
now a hangout for students, gays, tourists, and old-timers. A little farther
down La Rambla, off the left side as you face the sea, is the Plaça Reial,
a grand plaza with palm trees, arcades, and lampposts designed by none
other than Antoni Gaudí. In the past, the Plaça Reial was a drug dealer’s
hangout and a place you definitely wanted to avoid. However, the square
Part III: Northern Spain 
146

has been drastically cleaned up, and it’s now full of cafes and bars deal-
ing in legal stimulants.
The character of the strip changes again in the last section of La Rambla,
near the water. At night, the area feels pretty seedy, but by day it’s per-
fectly safe. Look for an artisans’ fair on your way to the Monument à
Colom (Columbus Monument), which stands at the bottom of La Rambla
at the harbor, punctuating the end of this preeminent stroller’s avenue.
(Columbus, ostensibly pointing to the Americas, is in fact turned in the
wrong direction. He’s pointing out at the Mediterranean, which isn’t
exactly the way to get to Florida.) Visitors can take the elevator up to
Columbus’s head for good views of the waterfront.
Nearby are the Drassanes, fantastic, vaulted medieval shipyards that 
now house the Museu Marítim, Av. Drassanes 1 (% 93-342-99-20; 6€, or
$7.50), a seafaring museum that includes a handsome replica of a massive
16th-century ship, the Galería Reial. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The lower end of La Rambla and the side streets that lead from it to the
Gothic Quarter, hugely popular with tourists, are areas that thieves tend
to trawl. Keep a firm grip on your handbag and camera, and keep your
wallet in your front pocket. See tips on safety in the Appendix.
Exploring the Old City and the Gothic Quarter
Barcelona’s Barri Gòtic (or Barrio Gótico, Gothic Quarter) — below
Plaça de Catalunya and between La Rambla and Vía Laietana — is the
oldest part of the city. Segments of the original Roman walls that once
contained the whole of the city still survive. The district today is an
intricate maze of palaces and treasures from the 11th through 15th cen-
turies. Although some late weeknights and quiet Sunday mornings it 
may seem as though you’ve been transported back in time, the Gothic
Quarter is hardly a time-forgotten museum. People live and work — and
especially go to restaurants and bars — here. You can find a number of
monuments in the area, but don’t forget to take a sightseeing time-out
and enjoy one of Barcelona’s greatest pleasures: an idle wander among
the Quarter’s narrow streets, along alleys filled with hanging laundry
and shouting neighbors, past shops of antiques dealers, and onto stun-
ning little squares.
The cathedral and Picasso Museum (covered later in this section) are
the district’s major sights, but also worth a visit is the noble Plaça del
Rei, the courtyard of the 14th-century palace of the kings of Aragón (the
Catholic monarchs received Columbus here after his successful voyage
to the Americas). Inside the palace are the Saló del Tinell, the main hall,
and Capella de Santa Àgata (Chapel of St. Agatha), both part of the
Conjunt Monumental de la Plaça del Rei (for hours and admission, see
the next paragraph). Climb the lookout tower of King Martin for unri-
valed views of the neighborhood and waterfront.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 147

Just off the Plaça del Rei is the Museu d’Història de la Ciutat (City History
Museum; Plaça del Rei, s/n; % 93-315-11-11; www.museuhistoria.bcn.
es). The chief attraction lies in the surprising basement, where excava-
tions have uncovered the foundations — including sculptures, walls, a
bathing pool, and cemeteries — of the ancient city of the Romans and
Visigoths. You can also view a multimedia show that brings Barcelona’s
unique history to life. The museum is open October through May,
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 8 p.m., and
Sunday and holidays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; June through September,
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday and holi-
days from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; admission, which also grants access to the
Saló del Tinell, Capella de Santa Àgata, and Museu Monestir de Pedralbes,
is 4€ ($4.80) for adults, 2.50€ ($3) for students and seniors (free 4 p.m.–
8 p.m. the first Sat of every month).
On your strolls through the Gothic Quarter, don’t miss the Roman walls
at Plaça Nova; Plaça de Sant Jaume, the heart of the Roman city and
today the site of the municipal and regional governments; Plaça del Pi,
the district’s liveliest square, teeming with outdoor cafes and a weekend
art market; peaceful Plaça Sant Felip de Neri (though walls ravaged by
Spanish Civil War shrapnel indicate it wasn’t always so quiet); and the
lovely winding streets Carrer de la Palla and Carrer Banys Nous,
known for their antiques dealers.
Allow at least a full morning or afternoon — more if you have it — to
take in the Gothic Quarter and its myriad highlights.
Contrary to what someone who visited Barcelona a decade ago may tell
you, walking around the Gothic Quarter is for the most part safe (and
not a haven for hoodlums and drug dealers, though you may stumble
across small numbers of both). The area has been cleaned up consider-
ably, but of course you need to exercise caution, especially at night.
Purse-snatchers and pickpockets wait for unwary tourists, so make sure
you put your wallet in your front pocket, and don’t carry either a camera
or a bag. If you’re going to a restaurant or bar in the area late at night,
call a taxi to take you to your hotel.
Catedral de Barcelona
Barri Gòtic
This Catalonian Gothic cathedral, the focal point of the Old City, is actually
a mix of architectural styles. Though construction began in 1298, most of
the structure dates from the 14th and 15th centuries. The facade was
added in the 19th century. Even with that lengthy birth process, the cathe-
dral is a splendid example of Gothic architecture. Inside, check out the
handsome carved choir and surprisingly lush cloister. With its magnolias,
palm trees, pond, and white geese, the cathedral is a lovely oasis in the
midst of the Medieval Quarter. (In the Middle Ages, geese functioned as
guard dogs, their squawks alerting priests to intruders.) Try to visit at least

once at night, when the cathedral is illuminated and birds soar in the flood-
lights. A half-hour or an hour is sufficient to see the cathedral.

Museu Picasso
Ciutat Vella
Pablo Picasso, though born in Málaga in southern Spain, spent much of
his youth and early creative years in Barcelona before making the requisite
artistic pilgrimage to Paris, where he soon became the most famous artist
of the 20th century. Barcelona’s Picasso museum, the second most-visited
museum in Spain (after the Prado in Madrid), can’t compete with the supe-
rior collection in Paris, but it’s the largest collection of his works in his
native country. Picasso (1881–1973) donated 2,500 paintings and sculp-
tures to the museum, many of them early (and more traditional figurative)
pieces, including several from his blue period. If you’re already a fan,
you’re likely to love the museum, even though few works are considered
Chapter 10: Barcelona 149
Catalan culture classics
On Sundays at noon, people perform that quintessential (and, to foreign eyes, quaint)
expression of the Catalan spirit, the sardana, in front of the cathedral. The disarmingly
simple dance looks and feels medieval. People place their bags in the middle of an
ever-widening circle, join hands, and hop and skip to the music. Feel free to throw
your backpack in and give it a whirl.
The castellers offer another great Catalan spectacle. Groups of men in white pants,
sashes, and matching shirts climb each other’s backs and stand on each other’s shoul-
ders to form successive levels that create a cylindrical pyramid; each ascending level
is composed of fewer and smaller members. The crowning moment is when the eighth
or ninth level is formed by a small child who races to the top and raises his hand before
scrambling back down. Look for castellers performing their gravity-defying stunt in
main squares on any important Catalan or Barcelona holiday, such as Sant Jordi (Apr
23), Diada Nacional de Catalunya (Sept 11), or La Mercè (Sept 24).
Spaniards are rabid fútbol (soccer) fans, and Barcelona is a legendary club in 
Europe. The team is known as Barça (bar-sa), or Fútbol Club Barcelona (www.fc
barcelona.com). For tickets to a game at the 120,000-capacity stadium, Camp Nou
(Avenida del Papa Joan XXIII; Metro: María Cristina/Palau Reial), visit the ticket office
at Carrer Aristides Maillol 12–18 or call % 93-496-36-00. You can also visit the Museu
del Fútbol Club Barcelona (Camp Nou’s Barça Soccer Museum), at Carrer Aristides
Maillol 7–9 (% 93-496-36-08), which (believe it or not) ranks as one of the most-visited
museums in Spain. Admission for adults is 5.30€ ($6.35) and for children 2.80€ ($3.35).

among Picasso’s masterpieces — and individuals looking for a compre-
hensive career-spanning collection may be disappointed. The artist’s
loopy series based on Velázquez’s renowned painting Las Meninas is
unusual but evidence of Picasso’s playful genius. The Picasso museum cur-
rently occupies several exquisite 15th-century palaces on a pedestrian-
only street lined with medieval mansions. It’s one of the city’s loveliest
streets, and the museum’s administrators are continuing their expansion-
ist craze, with plans to take over yet more buildings along Carrer Montcada
in the next several years. Even if you’re convinced you despise Picasso,
visit to the museum just to see the distinguished palace’s interior and
patios — you may change your mind, at least about his early work. At min-
imum, plan on spending a couple of hours here.

Santa María del Mar
Barri Gòtic
I’m wowed every time I duck into this 14th-century Catalan Gothic church,
and I am powerless to pass by without at least peeking my head in. It’s not
opulent or jewel-encrusted, and it doesn’t boast amazing cloisters or a fab-
ulous art collection — it’s a simple and solemn, but wholly inspired, space.
Architects understandably wax poetic about Santa María del Mar. The
church is gorgeously conceived, with perfect proportions in its three soar-
ing naves, wide-spaced columns, and handsome stained-glass windows. The
cathedral, which took only five years to complete, once sat on the Barcelona
waterfront, and sailors and fishermen (and their wives) prayed for safe
returns. You can take a ten-minute spin through, though even the nonreli-
gious tend to linger in this supremely serene space. It’s an unforgettable
experience to attend one of the music concerts occasionally held here.
See map p. 124. Plaça de Santa María (Ribera). % 93-215-74-11. Metro: Jaume I.
Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 4:30–8 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
and 5–8:30 p.m.
Visiting Montjuïc: More than Olympics
Montjuïc, the hill overlooking Barcelona from the south, is best known to
most visitors as the place where the big-draw Olympic venues (including
the attention-getting stadiums and the dramatic platform diving) held
some of the highest-profile events of the 1992 Summer Games. But there’s
much more to this historic hill.
If a taxi or subway is too boring for you, you can take a teleférico (aerial
cable car) or funicular to the top of Montjuïc, the hill south of El Eixample.
That is, once it reopens. In 2006, the teleférico — which glides above the
port — remained closed for renovation and modifications. Climb aboard
in Barceloneta or Port Vell (4.80€/$5.75 round-trip, 3.40€/4.10 one-way).
The funicular, now integrated into the city Metro, or subway, system,
Part III: Northern Spain 
150

leaves Avenida Paral.lel. Call % 010 for more information. Otherwise, the
Plaça d’Espanya Metro is the easiest way to get to the bottom of Montjuïc.
While visiting Montjuïc, check out the following sights:
 Leading to the Palau Nacional is the terrace of the Font Màgica —
the Magic Fountain. On Friday and Saturday evenings, from 8 p.m.
to midnight May through October (7–9 p.m. Mar–Apr), the foun-
tains perform a tricky ballet of rising and falling jets bathed in a
mist of changing colors — all programmed to music.
 Barcelona is loaded with flamboyant Catalan modernisme, but fans
of modernist architecture need to check out the ultraminimalist
design of the Pavelló Mies van der Rohe, a pavilion created by the
German architect for the 1929 International Exhibition in Barcelona.
The small dark onyx-and-glass structure, rebuilt in the 1980s, is
something of a pilgrimage spot for architecture and design freaks
(van der Rohe’s famous Barcelona chair was designed expressly 
for the pavilion). It’s on Avenida Marqués de Comillas, near the
Montjuïc fountains (% 93-215-10-11; www.miesbcn.com; open daily
10 a.m.–8 p.m.; admission 3.50€, or $4.20).
Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC)
If you want to get a sense of Catalonia’s unique history, this splendid
medieval art museum — one of the world’s finest, and Barcelona’s pre-
eminent art collection — is a vital stop (though many rushed visitors
unjustly overlook it). At the top of the stairs and fountains leading up to
Montjuïc, housed in the domed Palau Nacional (National Palace), the
museum is anything but a stale repository of religious art. The collection
of Romanesque works, salvaged from churches all over Catalonia, is
unequaled. Here you can view superb altarpieces, polychromatic icons,
and treasured frescoes displayed in apses, just as they were in the coun-
try churches in which they were found. The museum also holds paintings
by some of Spain’s most celebrated artists, including Velázquez, Ribera,
and Zurbarán. Plan on spending a couple of hours at the MNAC.
See map p. 124. Mirador del Palau 6 (Palau Nacional, Parc de Montjuïc). % 93-622-
03-76. www.mnac.es. Metro: Espanya. Admission: 8.50€ ($10); free for children 7
and under and first Thurs of month (also part of ArTicket joint admission; see the
“Museum deals and freebies” sidebar in this chapter). Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–
7 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–2:30 p.m.
Fundació Joan Miró
The Catalan surrealist painter and sculptor Joan Miró was one of the 20th
century’s most celebrated artists. Though his work may look like colorful
doodles to the uninitiated, Miró was one of the rare artists successful in
creating his own artistic language. The museum displays more than 200 of
his canvases, as well as a wealth of drawings, graphics, and sculptures.
Likewise, it has a real knack for landing some of the city’s most interesting
temporary exhibitions. Be sure to check local listings in the Guía del Ocio
Chapter 10: Barcelona 151

(the local arts and entertainment guide) to see what’s on when you’re in
town. Seeing the full museum requires a couple of hours, but if you find
Miró’s work a series of incomprehensible squiggles, you may jog through
it in a quarter of that time.

Nacional); alternatively, take bus No. 50. Admission: 7.50€ ($9), free for children 14

bies” sidebar in this chapter). Open: Oct–June Tues–Wed and Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m.,

Sun 10 a.m.–2:30 p.m.
Estadi Olímpic
The Estadi Olímpic (Olympic Stadium) that served as the setting for much
of the 1992 Summer Olympics is on Montjuïc Hill. You can take a peek at
the track-and-field stadium, originally built in 1929 for the World’s Fair, and
see Arata Isozaki’s sleek Palau d’Esports Sant Jordi, the indoor stadium
that hosted the gymnastics and volleyball events. Both stadiums are sig-
nificant pieces of architecture, bookending international events that
brought Barcelona to the world’s attention. If you remember watching the
Olympics and want to see the installations, a quick visit here is worth the
time, which shouldn’t take longer than half an hour. But unless something’s
going on at the stadiums, a visit entails seeing their exteriors only.
See map p. 124. Av. del Estadi, s/n (Parc de Montjuïc). Metro: Espanya (then take the
escalator from Palau Nacional), alternatively, take bus No. 50.
More cool things to see and do
In case you still have a few days to spend in Barcelona and you’ve hit the
main areas that I’ve already covered in this chapter, you may want to try
out these fun activities.
Hanging out at the waterfront
In 1992, using the upcoming Olympics — and incoming government 
funds — as an excuse to remake the city, Barcelona completely revamped
its port, which was unsightly and dangerous. The formerly polluted urban
beaches are now quite clean — though the water may not be — and the
waterfront is now one of the hottest places to live and party. Check out
Vila Olímpica, an award-winning neighborhood and medley of conceptual
architecture, where swimmers, baseball players, weightlifters, and other
Olympic athletes were the first to inhabit the apartments, which were later
sold and rented to the public. The two towers on the beach, Barcelona’s
only skyscrapers (one is the chic Hotel Arts, the other an office complex),
were initially very controversial, but Barcelonans now accept them as
another component of their forward-looking city. Port Olímpic, the new
harbor, swims with bars and restaurants, and Port Vell (the old port) is a
hyper-developed entertainment and shopping area, with such attractions
as the IMAX Port Vell cinema, Maremágnum mall, and L’Aquarium. Near
Part III: Northern Spain 
152

the Estació de França train station, Barceloneta, a former shambles of a
neighborhood with great seafood-shack restaurants propped right on the
beach, has been given a makeover, but it’s still home to several good
restaurants serving fresh fish, paella, and shellfish. The pedestrian boule-
vard along the old harbor, called the Moll de la Fusta, makes for a very
enjoyable paseo, or stroll; it stretches from the Columbus statue at the
bottom of La Rambla to a giant Liechtenstein sculpture. (See map p. 124.
Metro: Drassanes, Barceloneta, or Ciutadella–Vila Olímpica.)
Trekking up Tibidabo
Climb Tibidado Mountain (well, you don’t have to actually climb; you can
take the tram, taxi, or funicular) for marvelous views of the city below.
Locals swear that they’ve seen the island of Mallorca on a clear day. The
view is so stunning that you may also believe you can see the Balearic
Islands. The tram takes you to an overlook with bars and restaurants with
enviable panoramic views of the city and the ocean. A bit farther up the
mountain is Carretera de les Aigües, a long and winding exercise path
popular on weekends. On top of Tibidabo, you find the odd juxtaposition
of a neo-Gothic church and a 1950s-style amusement park, Parc
d’Atraccions (the gentle swing ride is spectacular; it seems to suspend
you over the city).
Tibidabo is a storied and strangely poetic name. It comes from Latin, mean-
ing “I will give you” — as the saying goes, words the devil used to tempt
Jesus Christ when he took him up on a mountain and showed him the
glory below.
To get there: By Blue Tram and Funicular: Take the historic Tramvia Blau
(Blue Tram) — the only existing tram in Barcelona — to Mirablau on the
way to Tibidabo (3.30€/$3.95 round-trip, 2.20€/$2.65 one-way). From Plaza
Kennedy (Metro: Tibidabo), the tram connects with the Funicular
Tibidabo, a cable car that completes the trek to the top of the mountain
(mid-Sept to the end of Apr, weekends only); (3€/$3.60, round-trip,
2€/$2.40 one-way). Call % 010 for more information.
Tracking down even more modernisme
If your first peeks at Gaudí piqued your interest, look around Barcelona
for much more modernisme. The easiest way to organize additional
architecture visits is with the Ruta del Modernisme guidebook and dis-
count pass (see the “A moderniste treasure hunt” box, later in this chap-
ter). You’re unlikely to have time to see the full roster of sights, but
here’s the best of the second-tier group.
 Hospital Sant Pau, Cartagena at Sant Antoni Maria Claret,
Domènech’s incredible hospital city and a UNESCO World Heritage
Site is down Avinguda Gaudí from La Sagrada Familia church. See
map p. 124.
 Palau Güell, Nou de la Rambla 3–5, one of Gaudí’s earliest works;
its roof is a surprising forest of tiled chimneys. See map p. 124.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 153

 Museu de la Música, Avinguda Diagonal 373, a cool music museum
in a wonderful palace. See map p. 124.
 The fairy tale–like Casa de les Punxes is at Avinguda Diagonal 416.
See map p. 124.
 Colònia Güell, considered by some to be Gaudí’s secret master-
piece, is also known as La Cripta (the crypt). True Gaudí aficiona-
dos make the trek beyond Barcelona to his 1915 crypt (and now
tiny church), envisioned as part of a much larger but unfinished
church built for a worker’s cooperative of moderniste buildings,
Santa Coloma de Cervelló. The Colònia, 13km/7 miles outside of
Barcelona, is a wonder of ingeniously inclined columns, brick
arches, and stained glass. To get there, take the FGC train from
Plaça d’Espanya to the Santa Coloma de Cervelló/Colonia Güell sta-
tion; call % 93-630-58-07 for more information. The ticket office is
a short walk from the entrance to the cripta, on Carrer Claudi Güell
s/n, in Santa Coloma de Cervelló. 
Barcelona from a kid’s point of view
Kids and parents have plenty to do in Barcelona.
 Besides beaches, the Port Vell waterfront has the second-largest
aquarium in Europe: L’Aquàrium de Barcelona, Moll d’Espanya
(% 93-221-74-74; www.aquariumbcn.com). The aquarium is open
daily September through June from 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and July
through August from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Admission is 15€ ($18) for
adults, 12€ ($14) for seniors, 10€ ($12) for children 4 through 12,
and free for children younger than 4.
 You can also find an IMAX theater, Moll d’Espanya (% 93-225-11-
11), and lots of diversions in the Maremàgnum Mall; just crossing
the funky Rambla del Mar drawbridge to get there is fun.
 Near the Columbus statue at the end of La Rambla is the Museu
Marítim (Maritime Museum; % 93-301-18-71), an old shipyard with
replicas of huge royal ships.
 In the Parc de la Ciutadella, the Zoo de Barcelona (Parc Zoològic
de Barcelona), Passeig de Picasso (% 93-225-67-80), has the
world’s only albino gorilla in captivity, named Copito de Nieve
(Snowflake). The zoo is open November through February daily
from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; March and October daily from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; April and September daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and May
through August daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission is 15€
($17) for adults, 7.70€ ($9.25) for seniors, 8.75€ ($10) for children
under 12, and free for children younger than 3.
 Poble Espanyol (Avinguda del Marqués de Comillas; % 93-508-
63-00), in Montjuïc Park, is a re-creation of a Spanish village with
architectural styles from all over Spain. You may find it a little
cheesy, but it’s a nice place for families to visit. It’s open Monday
Part III: Northern Spain 
154

from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 
2 a.m., Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 a.m., and Sunday from 
9 a.m. to noon. Admission is 7.50€ ($9) for adults, 4€ ($4.80) for
children 7 through 14, and free for children younger than 7; a family
ticket for two adults and two children is 15€ ($18).
 If Poble Espanyol isn’t enough to wear out your kids, check out the
amusement parks on both Montjuïc and Tibidabo.
 Children also enjoy attending some of the kid-friendly and fireworks-
heavy festivals in Barcelona, such as La Mercé, Festa Major da
Gràcia, and Sant Joan (see Chapter 3).
 Don’t forget Parc Güell, which Gaudí built with the uninhibited
imagination of a child (reviewed in the section titled “The top
attractions,” earlier in this chapter).
Trolling the other side of La Rambla
If you’re eager to see Barcelona in transition, and the slightly seedy side
of life doesn’t make you nervous, check out the Raval neighborhood (to
the right of La Rambla if you’re facing the sea), also called the Barri
Xinés, or Barrio Chino. For decades a mostly underclass and immigrant
neighborhood, Raval was also home to clusters of starving artists, down-
and-out hookers, and junkies. Today the barrio is a curious mix of rough-
around-the-edges and avant-garde design. In the last couple years, the
city razed buildings, installed plazas and pedestrian streets (one new
boulevard a local resident referred to as “La Rambla de Pakistan,” a ref-
erence to the burgeoning population of Indians and Pakistanis), and
commissioned big projects in an effort to revitalize the district. See one
of Gaudí’s first private residences, the Palau Güell, Nou de la Rambla
3–5, and Richard Meier’s glistening white Museu d’Art Contemporani de
Barcelona (MACBA, or Museum of Contemporary Art), on Plaça dels
Angels 1 (% 93-412-08-10; www.macba.es; Mon and Wed–Fri 11 a.m.–
8 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–8 p.m., and Sun 10 a.m.–3 p.m; admission: 7.50€, or
$9). The Casa de la Caritat, an old hospital behind MACBA, has been
intriguingly revamped as a city museum.
Although the Raval area (Metro: Liceu or Plaça de Catalunya) is definitely
on its way up, you need to be careful and mindful of your belongings, and
the area is best avoided at night.
Guided tours
If you don’t have a lot of time, the best way to see as much as possible
may be on an organized tour. Here are some of my picks.
Bus tours
Hop aboard one of Barcelona Bus Turístic’s buses for a tour of 27 city
sights. You can take either or both of the Red and Blue routes, and get on
and off as you please. Both depart from Plaça de Catalunya at 9:30 a.m.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 155

daily; all stops have full timetables. Complete journey time is about 
three-and-a-half hours. The bus runs daily throughout the year, except
December 25 and January 1. Price is 18€ ($22) for an adult, one-day ticket,
11€ ($13) for children 4 through 12. A two-day adult ticket costs 22€ ($26)
and 14€ ($16) for children. Purchase tickets onboard or in advance at
Turisme de Barcelona, Plaça de Catalunya 17 (% 93-285-38-32).
Walking tours
You can join English-speaking, guided tours of the Gothic Quarter as well
as moderniste, Picasso, or gourmet routes year-round with Barcelona
Walking Tours. Walks (90 min.–2 hr.) begin at Turisme de Barcelona,
Plaça de Catalunya 17. For information call % 93-285-38-32. Prices are 9€
to 11€ ($11–$13) and 3€ to 5€ ($3.60–$6) for children ages 4 through 12.
Walking tours of El Eixample are perhaps best left to weekends to avoid
the overbearing traffic congestion and noise that overtake the area
during the workweek. Nighttime is also a good time for a walking tour,
because many of the star moderniste monuments, including La Pedrera
and Casa Battló, are stunningly illuminated. (The area around Passeig de
Gràcia is safe at night.)
Bike tours
Two associated groups, Biketours Barcelona and Un Cotxe Menys,
Esparteria 3 (the name means “one fewer car” in Catalan), offer daily
guided three-hour bike tours (22€, or $26, including bike rental, guide,
and drink) in English and meet at Plaça Sant Jaume. (Tours leave Mon,
Wed, and Fri at 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.; Tues, Thurs, and Sat at 11 a.m. and
7:30 p.m.; and Sun at 11 a.m.) Call % 93-268-21-05 or visit www.bike
toursbarcelona.com. They offer bike rentals by the hour, day, and
week, as does Bike Rental Barcelona (which will deliver and pick up
bikes); call % 666-057-655 or visit www.bikerentalbarcelona.com.
Suggested itineraries
This section offers some tips for building your own itineraries. Two full
days will give you a good taste of what the city has to offer.
If you have one day
Begin early in the morning at the only grand cathedral of Europe still in
the midst of being built, Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia. Take an hour or so to
clamber around its spires and admire the whimsical sculpture adorning
its odd hidden corners. Then take the Metro to Diagonal for more mod-
erniste masterpieces in Gaudí’s Casa Milà and the famed Manzana de la
Discòrdia along Passeig de Gràcia.
Hop back on the Metro at the Passeig de Gràcia stop and get off at the
Jaume I stop so that, after grabbing some lunch on the go, you can pop
into the Museu Picasso, a museum honoring Barcelona’s other artistic
Part III: Northern Spain 
156

giant of the 20th century. Backtrack along Carrer de la Princesa and
cross Vía Laietana to the square in front of Barcelona’s massive Gothic
Catedral.
As evening draws near, make your way over to the grand promenade of
La Rambla to watch the street performers, locals out for their paseo
(evening walk), and to simply stroll one of the greatest pedestrian boule-
vards in Europe. Cut out by 6 p.m. or so for the evening tapeo, or tapas-
bar crawl, then head back to your hotel to rest up from your full day
before a 10 p.m. dinner at Restaurant 7 Portes or Los Caracoles in the
Old Quarter.
If you have two days
Begin day one seeing perhaps Barcelona’s greatest sight: La Rambla, the
long, wide, pedestrian boulevard that glides right through the heart of
the Old Quarter, from Plaça de Catalunya to the port. Start at the port
end, at the Drassanes Metro stop. Stop into La Boquería market. Pause
at the twittering, tweeting cages of the tiny portable bird market; toss
coins to the performers who pose as statues and only move when a clink
of change hits their plates. Follow La Rambla all the way to Carrer de
Portaferrisa and turn right until you get to the Catedral.
After lunch, work your way south through the back streets of the medieval
Barri Gòtic and head over to the Museu Picasso and then stroll the atmos-
pheric neighborhoods of La Ribera and El Born, a great place to stop for
a glass of wine or cava.
Day two is the day for modernisme. Start it off by proceeding to Sagrada
Familia and the Art Nouveau wonderland of Passeig de Gràcia, where
you’ll find the Manzana de la Discòrdia. Don’t miss a chance to see
Antoni Gaudí’s masterpice, Casa Milà.
Now, because the last day-and-a-half have been pretty packed (and
you’ve done lots of walking), take the afternoon to relax while still sight-
seeing. Either head up (by taxi) to the Gaudí-designed Park Güell, a
wonderful place full of whimsical architectural accents, or take the
Metro down to the waterfront, new port, and revitalized beaches.
Shopping the Local Stores
Barcelona’s fascination with design makes it a great place to load up on
unique art objects and home furnishings. Likewise, Barcelona is noted
for its fashion and jewelry. Although the city has added a couple of
megamalls in recent years, small, often family-owned stores still domi-
nate the shopping scene. Window-shopping along the city’s picturesque
boulevards is an art and a beloved pastime here.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 157

Barcelona’s best shopping areas
Tour these shopping areas to find the best that Barcelona has to offer
(listed in order of interest):
 Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya. You can find some of
Barcelona’s finest boutiques on these two chic streets above Plaça
de Catalunya. For fashion, jewelry, and home design, these streets
are great for window-shopping — as are nearby Mallorca, Valencia,
and Provença.
 Avinguda Diagonal. This avenue, which cuts across Barcelona, has
some of the finest and most expensive stores in Barcelona. Check it
out if your tastes run to Armani and other designers.
 Plaça de Catalunya. The entrance to the Old Quarter is the jumping-
off point for some of its principal shopping streets: Avinguda Portal
de l’Angel and Carrer Portaferrisa always swarm with shoppers.
 Gothic Quarter. Deep in the oldest part of town is one of the best
spots for antiques and art galleries. Check out the streets Banys
Nous, Carrer de la Palla, and Petritxol.
 La Rambla. Many of the shops on this street focus on tourist trin-
kets, but you can still find amazing little pastry and jewelry shops.
 Old Port. Barcelona’s newest shopping mecca is Maremagnum, a
mall teeming with restaurants and all kinds of shops. It’s open
every day of the year until 11 p.m.
What to look for and where to find it
From antiques to chic fashion and design, Barcelona — Spain’s finest
shopping city — has it all.
Antiques
The atmospheric streets Carrer de la Palla and Banys Nous in the Gothic
Quarter are home to innumerable antiques dealers; many of the shops
are as interesting as their wares. Bulevar dels Antiquaris, Passeig de
Gràcia 57 (Metro: Passeig de Gràcia), is a storefront that hides a maze of
at least 70 antiques dealers, but keep in mind that dealers sometimes
randomly disappear for long breaks — and not just at siesta time.
L’Arca de L’Àvia, Banys Nous 20 (% 93-302-15-98; Metro: Jaume I), a
friendly and inviting little shop that specializes in antique clothing and
lace, is reportedly the shop where the costume designer for Titanic
found the clothes on which that movie’s costumes were based. On a
recent trip, my wife and I found gorgeous antique lace mantillas and an
embroidered 20-foot moderniste curtain from the 1920s.
Art
Two areas worth exploring are Consell de Cent, in El Eixample, and
Passeig del Born, which is a hot gallery area. In particular, keep an eye
Part III: Northern Spain

out for Sala Parés, Carrer Petritxol 5 (% 93-318-70-20; Metro: Liceu),
Barcelona’s oldest art gallery, specializing in traditional art, and Galería
Maeght, Carrer Montcada 25 (% 93-310-42-45; Metro: Jaume I), a huge
and prestigious contemporary gallery down the street from the Picasso
Museum.
Books
Barcelona is the headquarters of Spain’s publishing industry. You’ll find
the largest selection of English-language books at the suggestively
named Come In, Provença 203 (% 93-453-12-04; Metro: Diagonal). Look
for art books, books on Spanish culture, cookbooks, and lots of dis-
counted titles — many in English — at Happy Books, Passeig de Gràcia
77 and Carrer de Pelai 20 (% 93-487-95-71; Metro: Plaça de Catalunya).
Casa del Llibre, Passeig de Gràcia 62 (% 93-272-34-80; Metro: Passeig
de Gràcia) is a very complete bookstore, with many titles in English.
Llibrería Francesa, on Passeig de Gràcia 91 (% 93-215-14-17; Metro:
Passeig de Gràcia), has many books in English, particularly travel titles
and, as the name implies, French titles. The excellent Crisol chain, with
branches on Rambla Catalunya 81 (Metro: Passeig de Gràcia), and
Consell de Cent 341 (Metro: Passeig de Gràcia), is also very well stocked,
as is the huge French department store FNAC, on Plaça Catalunya 4, part
of the large shopping mall called Triangle (% 93-444-59-00; Metro: Plaça
de Catalunya).
Department stores
El Corte Inglés, Plaça de Catalunya 14 (% 93-306-38-00; Metro: Plaça 
de Catalunya), is the monolith of Spanish department stores. If crowds
make you nervous, stay away. Other large and equally crowded
branches are located at the corner of Avinguda Portal de l’Angel and
Carrer Santa Ana, just southeast of the main store, and at Av. Diagonal
471 and 617.
Design
Vinçon, Passeig de Gràcia 96 (% 93-215-60-50; Metro: Passeig de
Gràcia), is Barcelona’s premiere design store, with everything that is, in
the estimation of founder Fernando Amat, well designed — including
lamps, watches, furniture, kitchen utensils, toys, writing instruments,
and so on. The display windows are whimsically avant-garde and worth
checking out even if you don’t have time for shopping. The shop occu-
pies the former house of the great Catalan painter Ramón Casas (this
was the first building in Barcelona built with a car garage). BD Ediciones
de Diseño, Carrer Mallorca 291–293 (% 93-458-69-09; Metro: Diagonal),
housed in a marvelous moderniste house, sells the high end of Catalan
design, including reproductions of Gaudí and Dalí furniture. Check out
this store if you’ve got style and euros to burn.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 159

Fashion
One of the foremost Catalan designers, Antonio Miró makes fashions for
men and women that are exquisite, but they’re for people with a serious
interest in fashion. The actor John Malkovich has been known to wear
Miró’s stuff, but so do regular folks like me. Miró’s signature shop is at
Consell de Cent 349 (% 93-487-06-07; Metro: Passeig de Gràcia). Look
for his other store, Groc, on Rambla de Catalunya; it also features chic
fashions by such designers as Dolce & Gabbana, Helmut Lang, and Jil
Sander. Adolfo Domínguez, from Galicia (northwest Spain), has taken
his sophisticated, mainstream fashions across Spain. Besides the store
at Passeig de Gràcia 32 (% 93-487-41-70; Metro: Plaça de Catalunya),
you can also shop at Av. Diagonal 570, and at Passeig de Graci 89. A
Galician fashion phenomenon, Zara has affordable but stylish clothes for
men, women, and children. The stores have sprouted like the European
Gap; look for branches on Rambla de Catalunya at Aragó and on Avenida
Portal de l’Angel. Camper shoes have become hot worldwide, recog-
nized for their downtown edge and reasonable prices; get them in
Barcelona before they’ve made it to your local mall, at the shops on
Rambla Catalunya 122, and Valencia 249.
Flea market
If you’re a junk-hound, check out Els Encants, Barcelona’s biggest 
and best flea market. Vendors hawk their goods and your finds all day
every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday at Plaça de les Glóries
Catalanes (Metro: Glóries).
Foodstuffs
Colmado Quílez offers packaged goods, fine wines, cheeses, and
imported beer in an atmospheric shop. After you place an order, the
attendant gives you a ticket, you go pay, and then you return to the
counter to collect your items. Find it at Rambla de Catalunya 63 
(% 93-215-87-85; Metro: Passeig de Gràcia). Escribà, Rambla de les
Flors 83 (% 93-487-06-07; Metro: Liceu), is a mouth-watering pastry-and-
chocolates shop in a lovely moderniste little storefront on a corner along
La Rambla. Eyeball the window; I defy you to resist stepping inside.
Caelum means “heaven” in Latin; accordingly, what you find here are all
sorts of products, such as Trappist-monk beer, candles, cheeses, and
honey, made by monasteries and religious orders. Downstairs is a cave-
like tearoom in what were 14th-century baths. Find it on Carrer de la
Palla 8 (% 93-302-69-93; Metro: Jaume I). Foodies should pay a visit to
E&A Gispert, a 150-year-old, terrific little shop, known for its roasted
nuts, dried fruits, coffee, and spices, near Santa María del Mar, Sobrerers
23 (% 93-319-75-35). An excellent cheese shop in the Born district is Tot
Formatge, Passeig del Born 13 (% 93-319-53-75; Metro: Jaume I). Ol,
Palla 8 (% 93-302-29-80), is entirely dedicated to olive oils — or, as they
call them, “liquid gold” — from across Spain.

Gifts
You can find ceramics and handcrafts at Art Escudellers, Carrer
Escudellers 23–25 (% 93-412-68-01; Metro: Drassanes or Jaume I).
Likewise, BCN Original offers a very nice selection of gifts, such as 
T-shirts, paper products, and much more, with the Barcelona stamp —
all conveniently located next to the Tourism Information Office at Plaça
de Catalunya 17 (Metro: Plaça de Catalunya). If you’re looking for Lladró
china figurines, Mils (Passeig de Gràcia; % 93-412-17-94; Metro: Passeig
de Gràcia) is one of many places to find them. The gift shop at La
Pedrera, Provença 261–265, offers Gaudí souvenirs and knock-offs,
including coasters and chocolates designed to look like the octagonal
tiles that form the sidewalk on Passeig de Gràcia.
Keeping Up with Barcelona’s Nightlife
Barcelona really buzzes after dark, and though the city doesn’t have
quite the crazed reputation that Madrid does, Barcelonans are only too
happy to stay up all night. To get a grip on what’s hip, what’s hot, and
what’s happening, pick up a copy of the weekly Guía del Ocio, a guide 
to all entertainment in Barcelona (available at newsstands, written in
Spanish but pretty comprehensible even to non-Spanish speakers).
Tickets for many events are available through www.telentrada.com
(% 902-10-12-12), ticktackticket.com (% 902-15-00-25), and www.
servicaixa.com (% 902-33-22-11).
Opera and classical music
If you’re into music, be sure to check out the following venues while
touring Barcelona.
 Gran Teatre del Liceu, La Rambla 51–59 (% 93-485-99-00; www.
liceubarcelona.com; Metro: Liceu). Barcelona’s grand opera
house was completely gutted by fire in January, 1994, but the city
raced to rebuild it, and it reopened in October, 1999.
 L’Auditori (Barcelona Auditorium), Lepant 150 (% 93-247-93-00;
www.auditori.com; Metro: Marina or Glóries). This splendid new
addition to the music scene, the work of the famed Spanish archi-
tect Rafael Moneo, features two halls for classical music concerts.
It’s high tech all the way. Get tickets at the box office, which is open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., or by calling 
% 902-10-12-12, or 93-247-93-00 from abroad.
 Palau de la Música, Sant Francesc de Paula 2 (% 902-44-28-82;
http://home.palaumusica.org; Metro: Urquinaona). For a truly
singular experience, don’t pass up the opportunity to attend a con-
cert in this moderniste wonderland. It’s really loosened up in recent
years; besides classical music, I’ve seen concerts by Lou Reed,
Tindersticks, and David Byrne here.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 161

Flamenco shows
Barcelona can’t compare with Madrid or Andalusia for tablaos
(tah-blah-ose) — live flamenco performances — but the city does offer a
few decent shows (but, to my mind, rather touristy compared with the
most authentic performances in Madrid and Andalusia). One is Tablao
Flamenco Cordobés, Las Ramblas 35 (% 93-317-57-11; www.tablao
cordobes.com; Metro: Liceu), which has been around more than 30
years. The show costs between 28€ and 30€ ($36–$38). El Patio
Andaluz, Aribau 242 (% 93-209-33-78; Metro: Gràcia), puts on flamenco
shows as well as sevillanas (seh-vee-yah-nahs), which showcase more
traditional southern-style singing and dancing, and is open until sunrise.
At the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc, Tablao de Carmen (% 93-325-68-95;
Metro: Espanya) offers flamenco dinner shows Tuesday through Sunday
nights starting at 8 p.m. (29€, or $35). Game-B, Carrer Atlantida 57 
(% 93-225-50-87; Metro: Barceloneta), a club near the waterfront, also
puts on flamenco shows every Sunday at 8 p.m. for 6€ ($7.20).
Cafes and bars
Two swank places to drink in the local atmosphere are the gorgeous
Café de la Opera, La Rambla 74 (% 93-302-41-80; Metro: Liceu), and
somewhat more sedate Els Quatre Gats, Montsió 3 (% 93-302-41-40;
Metro: Urquinaona). Another, which looks unearthed from 1940s Havana,
is sleek Boadas, Taller 1 (% 93-318-88-26; Metro: Plaça de Catalunya),
on the Raval side of the Rambla. Schilling, Ferran 23 (% 93-317-67-87;
Metro: Jaume I), is a hipster hangout frequented by Barcelona’s — and
the world’s — beautiful people. In the heart of the Gothic Quarter, tiny
Mesón del Café, Llibreteria 16 (% 93-315-07-54; Metro: Jaume I), is just
a tiny nook, but it gets my vote for coolest cafe and the best coffee in the
world. For spectacular views along with your cocktails, check out the
sleek bar Mirablau, Plaza Dr. Andreu, s/n (% 93-418-58-79), high up on
Tibidabo. The views of Barcelona beneath your feet are enough to make
you dizzy.
El Born, the area near Santa María del Mar and the Mercat del Born, and
the Olympic Port, near the Hotel Arts, are the two hottest nightlife areas
(the latter is more touristy, the former more hipster). You can’t walk
three feet without stumbling into a bar, and most of them are hopping
until very late (or early, depending on your bedtime). Another enjoyable
spot, where the rowdy outdoor bars have angered neighbors, is Plaça
del Pi, near the Catedral in the Gothic Quarter.
Casino
Casino Barcelona, on the port at Marina 19–21 (% 93-225-78-78; www.
casino-barcelona.com; Metro: Citutadella/Vila Olímpica; 11 a.m.–5 a.m.
daily; admission 4.50€/$5.40), features a disco, restaurant, and plenty of
gaming opportunities. Be sure to take your passport, because the law
requires an official ID for folks who want to gamble.
Part III: Northern Spain 
162

Live music
El Molino, Vila i Vila 99 (% 93-329-88-54; Metro: Paral.lel), is another
legendary place — one of the city’s oldest cabarets. Los Tarantos, Plaça
Reial 17 (% 93-318-30-67; Metro: Liceu), frequently has flamenco or pop-
flamenco shows, as well as Latin-flavored dancing. One of the top jazz
clubs in Europe, going strong since the 1960s, is Jamboree, Plaça Reial
17 (% 93-319-17-89; Metro: Liceu). Some of the most legendary names 
in jazz have played here, including Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and
Chet Baker. Cover is generally 8€ ($10). Harlem Jazz Club, Comtessa 
de Sobradiel 8 (% 93-310-07-55; Metro: Jaume I), a tiny affair tucked
away in the Gothic Quarter, is another hugely popular jazz club. A dis-
cotheque with regular live music is the historic Sala Apolo, Nou de la
Rambla 113 (% 93-441-40-01; Metro: Paral.lel).
Dancing
Several of the old stalwarts are still going strong. Antilla BCN Latin
Club, Aragon 141 (% 93-451-21-51), bills itself as a salsateca (salsa
club). The venerable Latin-flavored nightclub Nick Havanna, Rosselló
208 (% 93-215-65-91; Metro: Diagonal), was one of Barcelona’s first sleek
design-oriented bars. Luz de Gas, Muntaner 246 (% 93-209-77-11;
Metro: Muntaner), and Otto Zutz, Lincoln 15, a stylish warehouse in the
Gràcia district (% 93-238-07-22; Metro: Gràcia), remain, as they have for
years, among the hottest late-night dance places; both also feature live
music. Torres de Avila, Marqués de Comillas 25 (% 93-424-93-09; Metro:
Espanya), a design fantasy in the Poble Espanyol, is worth a peek if only
for the over-the-top look of the place — but a few drinks will really set
you back.
Newer clubs, especially popular with a younger set, are mostly in and
around the Barri Gòtic and the waterfront. The largest dance club in the
Gothic Quarter is New York, Escudellers 5 (% 93-318-87-30; Metro:
Drassanes), just off La Rambla. It doesn’t get going until well after 3 a.m.
Baja Beach Club, Pg. Marítim 34 (% 93-225-91-00; Metro: Drassanes), is
the place to go to see people dressed in little more than they would be if
sunning themselves at the beach — and that includes the staff.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 163
Good Grec: Barcelona’s summer festival
If you find yourself in the Catalan capital in the heat of summer, check out the listings
for Grec, an annual festival of international dance, music, and theater. For six weeks,
from the last week of June to the end of the first week in August, Grec showcases
everything from American blues to Brazilian samba and avant-garde Belgian dance.
Call % 93-301-77-75 or check the Web site www.barcelonafestival.com for a
schedule of events and ticket information.

One of the most popular gay dance clubs continues to be Arena, Balmes
32 (% 93-487-49-48; Metro: Plaça de Catalunya). Its sister club, popular
with lesbians, is Aire, Valencia 236 (% 93-487-49-48; Metro: Passeig de
Gràcia). The Gay T Dance sessions at Sala Apolo, Nou de la Rambla 113
(% 93-441-40-01; Metro: Paral.lel), on Sunday nights are extremely ani-
mated house and disco romps to top off the weekend.
Going Beyond Barcelona: Three Day Trips
If you have some extra time in Barcelona, the following easy side-trips
are well worthwhile; all can be done as a half- or full-day trip. If you’re an
architecture and Antoni Gaudí buff, or a recent convert, don’t miss the
opportunity to see Gaudí’s small, unfinished church, Colònia Güell
(which many believe to be the most innovative work of his career), just
outside the city in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (see “More cool things to
see and do” earlier in this chapter). If you have time to explore
Catalunya, see the next chapter, “Girona and the Costa Brava.”
Montserrat: The holy jagged mountain
Montserrat, home to the Black Madonna — the patron saint of 
Catalonia — is Barcelona’s peculiarly formed and sacred mountain.
Montserrat, which means saw-tooth mountain, cuts a dramatic, jagged
line across the Catalan sky.
Getting there
Montserrat is 50km (30 miles) northwest of Barcelona. You can go by
car, bus, or rail, but the most dramatic approach to Montserrat is via
train and a cable car that ascends to the top (though the cycling club I
used to belong to regularly biked to the mountain, and that wasn’t bad,
either). The Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) train (see
“Arriving by train,” earlier in this chapter) connects to an aerial cable
car (Montserrat Aeri). FGC offers the Tot Montserrat ticket (35€, or $42,
including trains, entry into the Montserrat museum, funiculars, and
lunch at the Montserrat restaurant; and the TransMontserrat ticket,
which covers the train and funiculars, for 21€, or $25). The trip leaves
from Barcelona’s Plaça d’Espanya station (% 93-205-15-15; www.fgc.
net). Autocares Juliá (% 93-490-40-00) offers a complete bus tour leav-
ing direct from Barcelona, departing daily at 9:30 a.m. and returning at
2:30 p.m. (45€/$54 round-trip).
The only other way to visit the mountain is by car, especially if you 
want to combine the journey with a visit to the Penedès Wineries (see
“Penedès: Spain’s cava country,” later in this chapter). You can easily 
do both in a single day if you’re driving. By car, take the A-2 out of
Barcelona toward Tarragona and Martorell, or the Barcelona-Terrassa
highway via the Túneles de Vallvidrera. The signs to Montserrat are
clearly marked. The Tourist Information Office is on Plaça de la Creu,
s/n (% 93-877-77-77).
Part III: Northern Spain 
164

Seeing the sights
Montserrat is no ordinary 1,219m (4,000-ft.) mountain, either in appear-
ance or symbolism. The setting for Wagner’s opera Parsifal, Montserrat
is home to an 11th-century Benedictine monastery, which is spectacu-
larly tucked into its ridges. In the 16th-century basilica is a shrine to 
the famous icon and patron saint of Catalonia, the Black Madonna
(Montserrat). Pilgrims come from all over to worship her, and you’ll see
her reproduced image everywhere in Barcelona. Next door to the basil-
ica, the Museu de Montserrat, Plaça de Santa María (% 93-877-77-77;
admission 6.50€, or $8.10), contains minor paintings by such celebrated
artists as Caravaggio, Degas, Monet, and El Greco, as well as an early
Picasso and Dalí.
After you’ve seen the basilica and museum, take the short funicular (near
the cable-car station) to the Sant Joan peak, where there’s a small her-
mitage and excellent panoramic views of the coast and Pyrenees foothills.
You’ll have to hoof it another 45 minutes up to the Sant Jeroni hermitage
and summit. Another funicular takes you to Santa Cova, a 17th-century
chapel built in the shape of a cross, where it is alleged that the Black
Madonna was discovered. A combined funicular ticket costs 7.30€ ($8.75)
round-trip, though you won’t need it if you purchased either the Tot
Montserrat or TransMontserrat ticket. Or, if you’re up for it, you can walk
to these sites and other caves and chapels on the mountain.
Besides visiting the monastery and museum, and appreciating the
incredible views of the Catalan countryside, time your visit to see the
Esolanía, one of the oldest boys’ choirs in Europe (dating to the 13th
century). The choir performs daily at 1 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. On Sundays
and holidays, you can hear them at morning Mass (11 a.m.).
Avoid making your pilgrimage to Montserrat on April 27 or September 8.
Those holy days draw pilgrims from all over Spain, and the place is a zoo.
Sitges: A stylin’ beach resort
The pretty beach town of Sitges is the definite standout along the so-
called Costa Daurada (Golden Coast), south of Barcelona. Sitges is any-
thing but laid-back; it’s one of Spain’s most prominent gay resort areas.
During holiday periods it draws thousands of Europeans and Spaniards,
so it can get pretty rowdy.
Getting there
Sitges is 35km (21 miles) southwest of Barcelona. The trip (3.80€/$4.55) 
is 40 minutes by train, with frequent departures from Barcelona’s Sants
station. For more information, contact RENFE, the Spanish national train
service, at % 902-24-02-02 or www.renfe.es. By car, take C-246. However,
on weekends, opt for toll highway A-7 to avoid traffic. (Allow 45 minutes to
an hour.) The Tourist Information Office (% 93-894-50-04; www.sitges
tour.com) is at Sínia Morera 1.
Chapter 10: Barcelona 165

Seeing the sights
Tiny Sitges has long been a cultural center, drawing the painters
Santiago Rusiñol and Salvador Dalí, as well as the poet Federico García
Lorca to its enclave. A good deal is a combined ticket to all Sitges muse-
ums for 5.40€ ($6.48); otherwise admission to any single museum is 3€
($3.60), free for children under 16. Museu Cau Ferrat on Carrer del
Fonollar, s/n, was the home of Rusiñol (who converted two 16th-century
fishermen’s houses), and it is today as it was in his lifetime — chock-full
of moderniste-period paintings, other artworks by the likes of El Greco,
and personal knickknacks. You can also browse through nice collections
of ceramics and wrought iron (% 93-894-03-64). It’s open Tuesday to
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 9 p.m. The other museum of note
is Museu Maricel del Mar, Carrer del Fonollar s/n, a handsome palace
displaying Gothic and Romantic artworks (% 93-894-03-64). The
museum is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.
The lazy lifestyle of beaches and seaside restaurants are Sitges’s main
draw. The beach in town is lovely, and beaches farther west draw some
less inhibited behavior. Unless you want an eyeful (of skin and more),
stick to the beaches in or near town. When night falls, the best plan is to
check out the constant beachfront stream of humanity along the prome-
nade. Otherwise, the Sant Bonaventura section in the town center siz-
zles with gay party spots. One of Spain’s more flamboyant parties is
Carnaval in Sitges, celebrated the week before Lent.
Where to stay and dine
You can find a number of good restaurants on Paseo de la Ribera. For
example, try El Velero de Sitges, at No. 38 (% 93-894-20-51), or Mare
Nostrum, at No. 60 (% 93-894-33-93). If you want to hang out for a couple
of days in Sitges, I suggest checking into either Hotel Romàntic de Sitges,
Carrer de Sant Isidre 33 (% 93-894-83-75; www.hotelromantic.com),
which comprises three art-filled 19th-century townhouses, or El Xalet,
Isla de Cuba 33–35 (% 93-811-00-70), a good-value moderniste house with
many original furnishings in the center of town and walking distance from
the beach.
Penedès: Spain’s cava country
Catalonia’s sparkling wine, called cava, comes from Penedès, a pretty
region just outside of Barcelona.
Getting there
Villafranca del Penedès, the epicenter of the Penedès wine region, is 40km
(25 miles) from Barcelona. By car (40 minutes), take A-2 in the direction of
Tarragona/Lleida; exit 27 is Sant Sadurní del Noia, and Cordoniu is clearly
marked. If you want to get on a bus, Autocares La Hispano Llacunense
(% 93-891-25-61) makes the trip, leaving from the corner of Avenida de
Sarrià and Urgell. Eight buses per day go to Sant Sadurní Monday through
Friday, and just two per day on Saturday and Sunday.

Seeing the sights
Several wineries are in the main town, Sant Sadurní del Noia. Best for
visits is Codorníu, which, though still family-owned, is Spain’s largest
cava producer. It’s also one of the oldest wineries in Spain, dating to the
mid-16th century. The winery makes an excellent addition to the mod-
erniste architecture you may have already seen in Barcelona. The main
buildings on the Codorníu campus, the work of the esteemed Gaudí 
contemporary Puig i Cadafalch, are a National Artistic and Historic
Monument. The highlight of a visit is a theme park–like cart ride through
26km (16 miles) of underground cellars. Guided visits at the Codorníu cel-
lars and winemaking museum, Av. Jaume Codorníu s/n, are held Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Visits

Girona and the Costa Brava

S
andwiched between Barcelona and the Pyrenees Mountains that
divide Spain from France, and extending from interior farmland to
the Mediterranean Sea, the province of Girona (jee-roh-nah) is a historic
and delightful area, replete with charming old towns and gorgeous
scenery. Except for the heavily visited beaches of the Costa Brava — one
of the pioneering regions of sand-and-sun tourism in Spain — the region
sees relatively few international travelers. Adding a few days of explo-
ration onto a visit to Barcelona, which is only an hour or two from most
of the places that I describe in this chapter, makes for a terrific and
varied regional trip to Catalonia.
Seductive and surprising, Girona is one of Spain’s most ancient towns
(the Romans first stepped foot on the Iberian Peninsula here), and it’s
just beginning to get the attention it deserves. Its Casco Viejo (Old
Quarter), which includes the ancient Jewish district called El Call, is per-
haps the loveliest in Spain. Within easy reach of Girona is the Costa
Brava, the “untamed coast,” a stretch of rocky coves and small beaches,
with intensely blue Mediterranean waters and whitewashed fishing vil-
lages. Steer away from overdeveloped areas where mass-market tourism
mars the coastline’s natural beauty (for some pointers on that, see “The
Costa Brava: Resorts and Rugged Beauty,” later in this chapter). And
inland from the coast, in the region of plains and rolling green hills
called L’Empordà, are movie-set medieval villages with tiny parish
churches and ancient stone houses, many of which are weekend and
summer homes owned by affluent Barcelonans.
One of the highlights of the region is following the trail of Spain’s famous
madman, the surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. Dalí hailed from these
rural parts, and although his art and antics earned him fame in New York
and Paris, he lived much of his life in the Costa Brava. You can visit the
three points that form the so-called Dalí Triangle, tracing the artist’s life
from his birthplace and legendary Costa Brava homes to the agreeably

loony museum he designed as his legacy. These visits are a must-see for
anyone with an interest in Dalí and contemporary art — and a barrel of
fun for anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for the
absurd.
The climate in the region is blissfully temperate most of the year,
although winter can be quite chilly. You can visit year-round, but the
Costa Brava closes up shop in mid-winter, as do some of the hotels in
the Empordà region (seasonal closings are noted in hotel listing descrip-
tions). In summer — especially July and August — Northern Europeans

overrun the area. At these times, and during Easter, hotel prices are
highest — and the need for advance bookings is greatest.
Unless you’re Dutch or German on a blitz to the beach, you’re probably
coming to Girona and the Costa Brava from Barcelona. You can easily
access the entire region from Barcelona by car, train, and bus, but a car
is the best way to maximize your time.
Girona: A Little-Known Medieval Treasure
Girona, dwarfed by Barcelona and the Costa Brava, is one of the unsung
jewels of not only Catalonia but Spain. Its beauty surprises many visi-
tors, who wonder why they hadn’t heard of Girona before — especially
because it’s only 100km (60 miles) from Barcelona. Girona is one of
Spain’s most historic cities. The Old Quarter, steeped in the layered his-
tories of the Romans, Moors, and Jews, is a compact jumble of narrow
stone streets, dark alleyways, and the medieval arches of El Call — the
ancient Jewish neighborhood. Along with Salamanca’s Old Quarter (see
Chapter 14), it’s the most beautiful and complete casco viejo in Spain.
Girona is perched on a hill, beckoning athletic climbers with wonderful
views of the surrounding countryside. The modern section of town lies
across the Onyar River, where multicolored laundry flaps in the breeze
from the balconies of yellow and orange sun-drenched apartment
houses. In one long day, you can see most of the historic city, but Girona
really turns up her charm as night falls, when the town empties of shop-
pers and tourists, and its silent streets exude an enticing medieval
atmosphere. This dignified city became seasonal training home in the
last few years to a couple of dozen professional cyclists (the majority of
whom are American), including the seven-time Tour de France champion
Part III: Northern Spain 
172
The name and language game
Catalan — not a dialect of Spanish but a Latin-derived language that sounds to an
untrained ear a bit like a cross between French and Castilian Spanish — is the pri-
mary language of Catalonia. In Barcelona, though, Catalan and Spanish are used on
an almost equal basis. Especially as you move north from Barcelona, Catalan becomes
much more prevalent (although almost everyone in tourist areas also speaks Spanish).
As a rule, the smaller the town, the more likely it is that Catalan is the language of
choice. Although most name spellings and street signs are in Catalan, you may also
come across their Spanish counterparts. Girona (jee-roh-nah) — referring to both the
capital of the province and the province itself — is the Catalan name. In Spanish, it is
spelled Gerona (heh-roh-nah). The larger region is called Catalunya in Catalan,
Cataluña in Spanish, and Catalonia in English. The plains area inland from the Costa
Brava is L’Empordà in Catalan and El Ampurdán in Spanish.

Lance Armstrong and now disgraced champions Floyd Landis and Tyler
Hamilton.
Girona has a reputation as a provincial, emphatically Catalan city and
province. The Catalan language dominates here — and in the Girona
countryside, you may find that people choose to speak very little
Spanish. When people do speak Spanish, they often do so with the
rather nasal tone of a heavy Catalan accent. (See the “The name and lan-
guage game” sidebar in this chapter for more information.)
Getting there
Most people still choose to visit Girona as a day trip from Barcelona or
the Costa Brava, so the bus, train, and car directions that I give in this
section reflect that supposition.
By bus
Many buses, such as those run by Sarfa, leave daily for Girona (and the
Costa Brava) from Barcelona’s Estació Nord. From Girona, buses leave
for Figueres (the Dalí birthplace and home of Teatre Museu Dalí; see
“The Dalí Triangle: Connecting the Dots,” later in the chapter) and many
stops along the Costa Brava (see “The Costa Brava: Resorts and Rugged
Beauty” section later in the chapter). Call % 902-30-20-25 or visit www.
sarfa.com for more information. Tickets are available at Barcelona’s
Estació Nord and the Tourist Information Office on Plaça de Catalunya.
By car
From Barcelona, take the ronda (beltway) in the direction of France and
then the A-7 to Girona. The 97km (60-mile) journey takes about an hour,
unless you set out during morning or evening rush hour. Figueres is
about two hours north of Barcelona (on A-7) and a half-hour north of
Girona (on N-II). C-255 and C-252 go along the coast and to principal
towns in the Empordà.
By train
Frequent RENFE (Spain’s national trains) service connects Girona,
Figueres, Port Bou, and Barcelona. You can choose from two dozen daily
trains (including the Catalan Talgo, Catalunya Express, and Regional).
Trains leave from Barcelona’s Estació Sants between 6 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.,
and arrive at Girona’s Plaça Espanya. For train information, call % 902-
24-02-02 (www.renfe.es; 5.45€–6.25€, or $6.80–$7.80). Trains take
about 90 minutes or less, depending on the service.
From Girona, you can take trains (2.95€, or $3.70) to the Costa Brava
towns of Llança, Blanes, and Colera (the last, a town whose name pres-
ents a serious public-relations problem!). For more, see “The Costa
Brava: Resorts and Rugged Beauty,” later in this chapter.
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 173

By air
Girona has a small international airport 12km (7 miles) from the city,
which increasingly services flights arriving from the United Kingdom,
Germany, and several other European cities. If you’re coming in from a
European country, contact the airport at % 972-18-66-00. Taking a taxi
(18€/$23) to the city is your best bet, though a shuttle-bus service 
(% 902-36-15-50; www.sagales.com; 1.95€/$2.40) also exists. If you’re
flying in from North America, you will most likely travel through
Barcelona first.
Getting around
You need only your feet as transportation after you arrive in the historic
part of Girona, although you may require an occasional taxi to take you
to a restaurant or hotel that’s outside the center of the Old Quarter. If
you’ve rented a car and are staying at a hotel removed from the center,
drive to the Old Quarter and park.
By car
If you plan on visiting more than just the city of Girona or Figueres, a car
is very helpful, if not downright essential. Distances are short, but you
can’t rely on train and bus service because it’s too spotty. With a car,
you can easily see a bit of everything — medieval villages, beaches, and
Dalí’s haunts — in a few short days. You’re probably best off renting a
car in Barcelona (see Chapter 6 for car-renting tips), though you can 
also rent through Avis (% 972-47-43-33), Hertz (% 972-18-66-19), and
Europcar (% 972-18-66-19) at the Girona train station.
By bus
Sarfa (% 972-20-17-96; www.sarfa.com) buses, leaving from Plaça
d’Espanya, s/n, operate throughout the Costa Brava, traveling to Girona,
Figueres, and Cadaqués. Call % 902-30-20-25 for bus service throughout
the region. However, except for major destinations in the region, bus
travel is a little too spotty, and I recommend using a car.
By train
Trains connect Girona to Llança, Blanes, and Colera on the Costa Brava,
with increased service in summer. The RENFE station is on Plaça
d’Espanya, s/n (% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es). Again, trains only
service a handful of destinations in the region, so if you’re interested in
really getting around, you should rent a car.
By taxi
For taxi service — which you’ll need mostly to get to the train or bus
station, or perhaps to a restaurant on the outskirts of town — call Taxi
Girona (% 972-22-23-23) or Girotaxi (% 972-41-90-92).

Finding information after you arrive
The helpful Oficina de Turisme is right on the pedestrian-only main
drag, Rambla de la Llibertat 1 (% 972-22-65-75). Another, smaller office
is located at the Punt de Benvinguda (meeting point) on Berenguer
Carnicer 3 (% 972-21-16-78), near the river and the Sant Feliu bridge.
Spending the night
Although I wholly recommend spending a night or two in Girona — it’s a
good base for exploring the area, and staying overnight allows you to
wander the silent Old Quarter at night — the city draws mostly day-
trippers from Barcelona and the Costa Brava. Consequently, it’s not
overflowing with hotels and pensiones (boardinghouses). The Tourism
Information Office, Rambla de la Llibertat 1 (% 972-22-65-75), can help
with accommodations if you arrive without a reservation.
Bellmirall
$$
This tiny, charming guesthouse in the heart of the Old Quarter just around
the corner from the Cathedral is perfect for individuals wanting to absorb
some of old Girona’s ancient flavor. In a restored 14th-century stone man-
sion, it has a slightly bohemian feel and the warmth of a family-owned inn.
Its seven rooms, which are perennially booked, are simple but very com-
fortable, and the downstairs patio and living rooms are great spots to hang
out with fellow travelers. Breakfasts are surprisingly ample.

Hotel Carlemany
$$$
The second-best option in Girona (behind the Hotel Citutat de Girona), this
large (90-room), modern, and mirrored new hotel is a ten-minute walk
across the Onyar River from the Old Quarter, and provides easy access to
both the train and bus station in the new part of town. Rooms are hand-
somely appointed, spacious, and very comfortable, and the staff is friendly
and efficient. The restaurant, El Pati Verd, is one of the better places to
dine in Girona, another reason virtually all business travelers camp here.

Pont de Ferro (iron bridge) that leads over the Onyar River to the Old
Quarter, and around the corner from one of Girona’s best shopping streets,
Santa Clara. Rooms are stylishly functional, with excellent beds, nicely
equipped bathrooms, and such extras as a free minibar, CD player, and DSL
Internet connection — and free laptop for use (upon request). For this kind
of comfort, style, and service, Ciutat de Girona is an excellent value. In
addition, the hotel is connected to a very cool, popular, and excellent-
value restaurant, Blanc.

well appointed, with nice tiled bathrooms and exposed stone walls. Five
ample apartments (all with sitting rooms and full kitchens) have two
double rooms, while the other two each have a double room. There’s even
a restaurant on the premises.

Dining locally
Some of Girona’s most celebrated restaurants are clustered along the
Costa Brava or in the countryside. But the restaurant scene continues to
improve in the city, where you can find several good places to sample
authentic Catalan cooking. You can find all the restaurants listed in this
section in the Old Quarter. Another option is El Pati Verd, within the
Hotel Carlemany (see the description in the preceding section). For
more on Spanish dining customs, including mealtimes, costs, and tip-
ping, see Chapter 2.

CATALAN
This chic and understandably very popular restaurant, connected to the
stylish Hotel Ciutat de Girona (see the listing earlier in the chapter), is part
of a successful collection of attractive and very affordable restaurants in
Barcelona and several other spots in Catalonia. With white leather ban-
quettes, dashes of color, and label-less wine bottles posing as art, it is sur-
prisingly hip given its family-friendly prices. Blanc (meaning “white”)
serves Catalan and Mediterranean specialties such as lasagna baked with
Iberic ham, onions, and ceps (wild mushrooms).

MEDITERRANEAN/PIZZA
With a smattering of candlelit tables cascading up the steps of a pictur-

screams romance. At least it does at the very coveted outdoor tables.
Indoors, the restaurant is surprisingly noisy and cavernous, spreading
over several dining rooms. By all means, try to snag a table on the steps
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 177
Eating and drinking like a Gironès
The cuisine in the Girona region is ancient, Mediterranean, and based equally on the
sea and the region’s rolling farmlands. A Catalan staple is pa amb tomàquet — bread
raked with fresh tomatoes and doused with virgin olive oil. Likewise, native people talk
about hunting for wild mushrooms with the same passion usually reserved for soccer.
On menus, you find lots of ali-oli (olive oil and crushed garlic sauce), fuet (long, thin,
dried sausage), and butifarra (Catalan white sausage). Escalivada is a great country
dish made with baked eggplant, onions, and sweet peppers. For dessert, don’t miss
out on crema catalana (crème caramel with a burnt-sugar top).
Catalans are almost as wild about leeks as they are about wild mushrooms. During
the month of March, calçotada madness arrives. Calçots are specially grown leeks
that are grilled and served with romesco sauce and broiled meat. It’s a dish as messy
as it is tasty. That’s why when you pass a roadside restaurant advertising calçots or a
calçotada (essentially an onion barbecue), most of the diners are decked out in bibs
while slurping on long and tasty leeks.
Good wines come from Peralada and the Penedès region just to the south. If you didn’t
have any crisp cava (Catalan sparkling wine) in Barcelona, try some in Girona; it tastes
great with tapas.

(which are so popular you’ll need to arrive early and get on the list) and
enjoy some excellent pizza on rustic pagès bread with interesting toppings
(spinach, green asparagus), fresh, tasty salads, and pastas. For dessert,
try one of the yummy homemade crepes.
Pujada de Sant Domènec 4 (Old Quarter). % 972-21-88-03. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: 4.50€–8€ ($5.40–$10). MC, V. Open: Lunch and dinner
Tues–Sat.
El Celler de Can Roca
$$$$–$$$$$
CATALAN
One of the finest dining spots in Catalonia — in fact, in all of Spain — is
this elegant but relaxed modern restaurant run by three brothers (the
Rocas of the restaurant’s name), on the outskirts of Girona (about a 15-
minute drive). Joan is the master chef in the kitchen; he creates carefully
executed, imaginative dishes such as lubina (sea bass) with a sauce of
hazelnuts and lemon peel in cabernet sauvignon vinaigrette or red mullet
with orange and cauliflower. The wine list (overseen by Josep) is award
winning and voluminous: Its three thick volumes are wheeled to your table
on its own lectern.
The menu continues to be consistently innovative, featuring both great-
est hits from over the years (listed along with their date of introduction)
and new evolutions. By far the best strategy is to choose one of three fixed-
price menus: a “surprise” menu left up to the market and whims of Josep,
a tasting menu, and a seasonal menu. Desserts, the work of Jordi, the
youngest brother, are exquisite flights of fancy; many of them are inspired
by perfumes and designed to play off scented strips that accompany them.
Less pricey than other restaurants of similar renown, Can Roca is the one
restaurant north of Barcelona — besides El Bulli, which is nearly impos-
sible to get in (see the review in the “Where to stay and dine on the Costa
Brava” section later in the chapter) — that you don’t want to miss. I’d even
venture to say it alone is worth a trip to Girona.

Exploring Girona
Girona may be small, but it’s filled with sights to see — most of them in
the heart of the Casco Antiguo, or Old Quarter. The Tourist Information
Office offers guided visits (in English as well as Spanish and Catalan) to
the Old Quarter year-round. Daily two-hour walking tours begin at the
Punt de Venvinguda (meeting point) at 10:30 a.m. (10€/$12). For more
information, call % 972-21-16-78.
The top attractions
Girona’s splendid Old Quarter, a harmonious, orderly, and compact
center of cobble-stoned streets and stone mansions and churches, is the
focus of any visit to the city. As long as you’re not trailing a tour group,
it’s also delightfully peaceful. The city was built on an old Roman settle-
ment surrounded by four rivers, and the original Roman walls date to
the first century A.D. One can still walk along a 5km (3 mile) portion of
the wall, from where you can enjoy extraordinary views of the Old City
and the historic Roman tower. The entire zona monumental (historic dis-
trict) practically begs for a little desultory wandering.
Of particular interest is the Jewish Quarter, or El Call (see the review
later in this section). The main street in the Call, Carrer La Força, is the
old roman Vía Augusta. Girona, which had a Jewish presence for some
six centuries, is one of several cities in Spain with strong Jewish ties;
others, perhaps better known, are Toledo, Segovia, and Córdoba. For
additional information on Jewish heritage in Spain and a network of
Jewish sites, including tourist routes, across the country, visit www.
redjuderias.org (the Web site’s name translates as “Routes of
Sepharad”).
Els Banys Àrabs de Girona (Arab Baths)
The Moors made their presence known in Girona; however, the Arab Baths
are one of the only reminders of that important community. Constructed
in the 12th century, the Romanesque baths are among the best-preserved
in Spain, having been restored in the 1920s when the government took
over their administration. Light streams in from the central dome, and you
can easily imagine the central role the baths must have played in the
Middle Ages. If you’re lucky, you may catch a cool underground art exhibit
or film here. Allow a half-hour for your visit here.

Cases de l’Onyar
Cases are houses, and the ones along the Onyar River are a magical sight.
They shimmer in the water’s reflection, and laundry flutters in the breeze.
Despite the picturesque Mediterranean colors, many of the houses date
to the Middle Ages — they were then outside the original walls of the Old

City. Take a sunset stroll along the river and walk across the Pont de Ferro,
the iron bridge built by the Eiffel Company in 1877, 12 years before the
Eiffel Tower. A visit here requires little more than a quick drive-by.
Along the Onyar River, at edge of the Old Quarter.
Catedral
Girona’s dazzling cathedral, atop the fortresslike hill overlooking the city,
is a can’t-miss sight in the Old Quarter. Seeing the Baroque stairs — all 90
of them — may tempt you to look for a less challenging visit, but don’t shy
away. The cathedral, a work-in-progress for seven centuries, is worth the
effort. The cloister and tower are the only surviving elements of the origi-
nal, early-11th-century Romanesque building. The single nave — the cathe-
dral has no aisles — is the widest Gothic nave in the world (and the second
widest of any style, after St. Peter’s in the Vatican). Don’t miss the cathe-
dral’s treasury, which houses a magnificent collection of religious art. Of
special interest is the gorgeous copy of the Beatus, St. John’s eighth-cen-
tury treatise on the Apocalypse. The curiously shaped 12th-century claus-
tros (cloisters) contain fine columns with beautifully etched friezes (a
series of decorations forming an ornamental band around a room). You
can climb the 11th-century bell tower named for Charlemagne, but only if
you can find someone manning the tower and willing to take you up — not
always an easy task. Anticipate spending a half-hour or so here, more if
you climb the tower. Afterward, don’t miss the lovely, tranquil gardens
tucked behind the cathedral and just below the city wall: Jardines de la
Francesa (French Woman’s Gardens) and Jardines de los Alemanes
(German Gardens).

El Call and Museu d’Història dels Jueus
Girona was home to a prosperous Jewish community for more than six
centuries, until its members were expelled in 1492. Girona’s Jewish ghetto,
“El Call” in Catalan, is said to be the best-preserved ghetto in Western
Europe. It’s a tangle of narrow, dark, atmospheric streets tucked within the

Old Quarter. The first Jews arrived in A.D. 895 and constructed the first syn-
agogue just to the right of the cathedral. The principal street in the Jewish
Quarter is Carrer de la Força, where buildings date from the 13th to 15th
centuries. Don’t miss the ever-evolving, handsomely designed Museu
d’Historia dels Jueus, or Jewish History Museum, in the Centre Bonastruc
Ça Porta, a history center that documents the Jewish population of Girona.
The fascinating story it tells of how the Jewish community lived in Girona
is a little-known piece of Spanish history. The last known synagogue in the
city, built in the 15th century, is part of the center. Allow an hour to visit
the museum and another hour or two to walk around the old Jewish
Quarter.
Guided visits of El Call (“Les Portes de la Memòria,” or Portals of Memory)

It features excellent Catalan Romanesque and Gothic paintings, as well as
a significant collection of contemporary art. Among the highlights is a
15th-century altarpiece, Sant Miquel de Cruïlles, one of the finest works of
Catalan Gothic art anywhere. If you missed Barcelona’s Museum of
Romanesque and Gothic Art, the Museu d’ Art is the next best thing. Plan

More cool things to see and do
If you still have a few hours or even an extra day to spend in Girona,
check out these fun activities.
 Roaming La Rambla. Girona’s lively La Rambla de la Llibertat is
shorter and less grand than Barcelona’s, but it plays just as central
a function in the city. The tree-lined pedestrian street in the Old
Quarter is packed with chic shops and cafes, many tucked under
the ancient arches. (The Rambla was the central marketplace in
medieval Girona.) La Rambla begins near the Tourist Information
Office, Carrer Nou, at the Onyar River.
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 181

 Checking out Girona’s other churches (and the archaeology
museum). The Monestir de Sant Pere de Galligants, Plaça de
Santa Llúcia, s/n (% 972-20-26-32), is a handsome 12th-century
Benedictine monastery and superb example of Catalan Gothic
architecture. It was once a fortress, its bell tower serving as a
watchtower. The church houses the city archaeology museum
(Museu d’Arqueologia de Catalunya-Girona), with several items
culled from the Roman ruins at nearby Empúries and a stunning
Roman sculpture. Incredibly, the museum dates to the mid-19th
century, when it was installed in the church. Admission is 2€ ($2.50);
hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and
4 to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; October through June,
closing time is 6 p.m. The tiny Capella de Sant Nicolau, Plaça de
Santa Llúcia, s/n, across from Sant Pere de Galligants, is a tiny
Romanesque chapel that is only open when it holds contemporary
and avant-garde art exhibits. If it’s open in the afternoon (Tues–Sat),
it’s well worth a peek. Església de Sant Feliu, just outside the origi-
nal Roman walls on Pujada de Sant Feliu (% 972-20-14-07), includes
an imposing bell tower, important retablos (altarpieces), the tomb of
Saint Narciso, the patron saint of Girona, and eight splendid Paleo-
Christian sarcophagi, hand-crafted in Rome from the second to the
fourth centuries. It’s one of the most important collections of its 
kind in Iberia. Admission is free; hours are daily from 9 to 10:30 a.m.,
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., and 4 to 6:30 p.m., and holidays from 4 to 
6:30 p.m.
 Stepping into the celluloid past. Girona recently inaugurated
Spain’s only cinema museum, the Museu del Cinema, Sèquia 1 
(% 972-41-27-77; www.museudelcinema.org), which houses the
extensive private collection (more than 1,500 objects exhibited,
including nine films) of Tomàs Mallol. Film buffs dig seeing the origi-
nal camera of the Lumière brothers, and kids can enjoy plenty of
cool interactive exhibits. Admission is 4€ ($4.80) for adults, 2€
($2.40) for students and seniors; the museum is open May through
September, Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.;
October through April, Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. Allow about an hour for a visit.
Shopping for local treasures
One of the wealthiest towns in Spain, Girona has a surprising number of
chic design, clothing, and home-furnishings shops sandwiched near El
Call. The Rambla de la Llibertat, Carrer Argenteria, and Carrer Santa
Clara (the latter across the Pont de Ferro from the Old Quarter) are the
top shopping streets. One design store you shouldn’t miss, if only for
how coolly it’s installed in a mansion in the Old Quarter, is Pabordia,
Catedral 4 (% 972-20-17-04). An attractive antiques store is La Cononja
Vella, at the end of Plaçeta de L’Institut Vell, next to the Cathedral. A
cool, tiny jewelry shop with original designs is Majoral, Carrer de la
Forca 17. For some of the best chocolates this side of Belgium and funky
Part III: Northern Spain 
182

chocolate drinks infused with fruit, check out Cacao Sampaka (which
also does a respectable lunch menu), Santa Clara 45. The nearby town of
La Bispal is famous for its ceramics; in Girona, you can find a good selec-
tion of what you’d find in La Bispal (at slightly lower prices) at Vila
Clara, Vallesteries 40 (% 972-22-37-78).
Living it up after dark
Girona was once written off as a deadly quiet town that forced all the
local college-age kids to drive to Barcelona for some weekend action. No
more. The Old Quarter has a number of interesting bars along La Rambla
de la Llibertat (such as L’Arcada at no. 38; no phone) and back toward
the Jewish ghetto, along Carrer de la Força. Plaza de la Independencia
and Zona La Dehesa are both popular areas lined with cafes, bars, and
discos. Bar/pubs worth checking out are La Taverna de l’Abat, in the
old Bishop’s quarters of the Sant Pere de Galligants monastery on Plaça
de Santa Llùcia (% 972-21-97-04); Aleshores, Plaça Independencia 4 
(% 972-22-06-06), with a crowded dance floor and plenty of young
people; and Sidharta, Pedret 116 (% 972-22-04-20). A cool, dark little
jazz club with live music (including good touring combos) on weekends
is Sunset Jazz Club, just beyond the Old Quarter and near the river on
Jaume Pons i Marti 12 (% 972-08-01-45). Lola Café, Carrer de la Força 7
(% 972-22-88-24), is a hip spot on the most atmospheric street in the
Jewish Quarter; it features occasional live music and DJs in the evening.
Beyond Girona: A Day trip to Besalú
Although the logical thing to do after experiencing medieval Girona might
be to move on to follow the Dalí Triangle, hit the beaches along the Costa
Brava or visit the medieval towns of the Empordá (all of which I detail
later in this chapter), the province of Girona has a couple of other high-
lights northwest of the capital. If you can spare an extra day or two, a visit
to Besalú, a wonderful little medieval town with a spectacular assembly of
churches and an 11th-century bridge. By far your best bet is to travel by
car; Besalú is 32km (19 miles) north of Girona along N-II.
Besalú
Besalú is a charming small town that’s a study in stone. It served as a
fortress of an independent principality of a large territory in the 10th
and 11th centuries, and its several splendid churches and postcard-
perfect medieval bridge stand as testament to the town’s illustrious his-
tory. The Oficinal Municipal de Turisme, on arcaded Plaça Llibertat, at
Major (% 972-59-12-40), offers guided 75-minute tours of Besalú’s his-
torical monuments. The office distributes a nice map of town. In July and
August, guides in medieval costume give night tours of the monuments,
and during the first weekend in September the entire town seems to turn
out in robes and swords for the Besalú Medieval Festival.
The Monestir de Sant Pere, Plaça Prat de Sant Pere, begun in 977, was
originally part of a Benedictine convent. In both form and size, the
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 183

church is very atypical for a Romanesque church. Surprisingly large, it is
suffused with natural light, and the capitals behind the altar are beauti-
fully carved. You can visit it by guided tour only. Around back, behind
the apse, is a 12th-century Gothic portico that belonged to the Sant
Julia Hospital, which tended to religious pilgrims. The Església de Sant
Vicenç, also begun in 977, but, as its Gothic details suggest, finished
much later, holds the tomb of Pere de Rovira and an image of the patron
saint of Besalú, Dolores, meaning “the sufferings.” In the Middle Ages,
from the 12th to the 15th centuries, Besalú had a pretty sizeable Jewish
community living in the walled El Call district. Uncovered only in the
mid-1960s was a Miqvé, or Jewish purification baths, that dates to the
1100s. They’re the only such surviving baths on the Iberian Peninsula
(and one of ten in Europe). The baths are located down below Carrera
Pont Vell and are next to ruins of the old synagogue. Admission is 1.05€
($1.25), and guided visits, arranged at the tourist office, are daily at 
10:30 a.m., noon, 1:30, 4:30, and 6 p.m. Nearby are two of the most attrac-
tive streets in El Call, Comte Tallaferro and Rocafort. The fortified Pont
Fortificat, or fortified bridge, though, is the emblematic image of Besalú.
Curiously angled and beautifully illuminated at night, it’s one of the most
spectacular Romanesque bridges in Spain. Walk across it and back
through town.
If you want to spend the night in Besalú, the Hotel Comte Tallaferro,
Ganganell 2 (% 972-59-16-09), is an attractive, simple hotel in a historic
building. You can dine in several good restaurants in town, including the
high-end Els Fogons de Can Llaudes, in an old chapel, Plaça Prat de Sant
Pere 6 (% 972-59-08-58); Can Quei, Plaça Sant Vincenç 4 (% 972-59-00-85),
which serves simple Catalan home cooking; Cúria Real, Plaça Llibertat 15
(% 972-59-02-63), and Pont Vell, Ponte Vell 28 (% 972-59-10-27), with gor-
geous views over the medieval bridge. The last two are closed on
Tuesdays.
The Dalí Triangle: Connecting the Dots
North of Girona, forming a triangle across L’Empordà and the Costa
Brava, you can trace the artistic, kooky, and ultimately permanent stamp
Salvador Dalí left on his native Catalonia. The so-called Dalí Triangle
includes his self-designed legacy, the agreeably bizarre Museum-Theater
in Figueres; the funky home he shared with his controversial and
equally flamboyant wife, Gala, in Port Lligat, near the beautiful Costa
Brava fishing village of Cadaqués; and the eccentric 900-year-old castle
he bought Gala in Púbol and transformed into Dalí-land. Following Dalí’s
trail is an excellent way to get to know this beautiful and intensely indi-
vidualistic region of Spain. By car, you can easily see these sights in a
day or two, using as a base Girona, a beach town along the Costa Brava,
or an inland site in the Baix Empordà (see the sections on the Baix
Empordà and the Costa Brava later in this chapter).

Figueres: Dalí’s Museum-Theater
Figueres, just 50km (31 miles) north of Girona, is on the tourist map for
one reason: Dalí’s Museum-Theater in Figueres is the third-most visited
museum in Spain. Dalí’s eccentric genius and personality infiltrated pop
culture throughout North America and Europe, and his legacy draws
hordes of the curious and the faithful. His surrealist paintings of melting
watches and dreamscapes continue to exert a strong, strange hold on
artists and novices alike. Likewise, the museum Dalí himself designed
(and wanted to be buried in) is part theater, part amusement park.
Unassuming Figueres (Figueras in Spanish) was once a historically
important town, but now it’s mostly about Dalí. The artist was born
here, and he was determined to build his unique museum here. Crowds
flock to the museum and then quickly depart for more appealing destina-
tions in Catalonia.
Honestly, Figueres isn’t worth exploring a whole lot. It’s one of the few
places where I’d advise you to follow the crowds and do like the tour
buses: Lose yourself in the Dalí Museum for a couple of hours, perhaps
stop for lunch or an early dinner, and then get out of town.
Getting there
Figueres is about two hours north of Barcelona (on A-7) and a half-hour
north of Girona (on N-II). Frequent RENFE trains run from Barcelona’s
Sants Station to Figueres (Barcelona–Port Bou line); the Dalí museum 
is approximately a ten-minute walk from the train station (on Plaça de
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 185
Hello Dalí: Egghead or señor dollars?
Few art figures have been as controversial — adored, puzzled over, and reviled — as
Salvador Dalí. Was he a genius with a special insight into human psychology or a self-
promoting fake?
The artist claimed that recurrent motifs in his work, such as melting watches and rub-
bery eggs, sprang from the subconscious, which is why giant white huevos (eggs) top
both the museum in Figueres and his house in Port Lligat. Dalí maintained that he
remembered being an embryo inside his mother’s womb, and his interest in eggs (and
soft-boiled wrist watches) served as a metaphor for his fetal experience. Whatever
their artistic merit (many art scholars assert that Dalí was a trailblazing master), the
surreal images certainly grab your attention.
When Dalí split from the surrealist movement and became, in the eyes of many, a bla-
tant publicity hound with an unerring commercial streak, he was branded “Avida
Dollars” by the surrealist poet André Breton. The cruelly on-target nickname, an ana-
gram, stuck — at least among Dalí’s detractors.

l’Estació, s/n; % 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.com). Sarfa buses (% 902-
30-20-25; www.sarfa.com) serve Figueres, Girona, the Costa Brava, and
Barcelona. The bus station in Figueres is on Plaça de l’Estació 7 (% 972-
67-33-54).
Visit the Figueres Oficina de Turisme on Plaça del Sol, s/n (% 972-50-
31-55). You can also check out a small tourism kiosk at the bus station.
Dining in Figueres
Even though few visitors stick around long enough for a real meal,
Figueres has a reputation as a great restaurant town (though two of its
best restaurants are actually in hotels). If you stay for lunch or dinner,
you can certainly eat well. Empordà, Antigua Centra a Francia, s/n 
(% 972-50-05-62), is one of the best restaurants in Catalonia. As the
name suggests, the restaurant focuses on the creative cooking and ingre-
dients of the surrounding Empordà countryside. Dalí was a regular here.
The tasting menu (50€, or $60) is superb. Another standout restaurant is
Durán (Lasauca 5; % 972-50-12-50), in the hotel of the same name in the
center of Figueres. It offers a very good-value fixed-price menu for about
10€ ($12).
If you’re lucky enough to score a reservation and you have the deep
pockets to experience what’s considered to be the most-cutting edge
restaurant in Europe, famed El Bulli is only a half-hour drive from Figures,
in the town of Roses along the coast. (See the listing later in this chapter.)
Exploring Figueres
The primary attraction of Figueres is the legacy of the man who was
born here and went on to become an international art superstar, as
renowned for his surrealist paintings as for his idiosyncratic lifestyle:
Salvador Dalí. His Teatre Museu is the reason everyone comes to
Figueres, but his home along the northern Costa Brava, near Cadaqués,
is every bit as good an insight into the eccentric world of Dalí.
Teatre Museu Dalí
To some, Dalí was a genius; to others, he was a freak. I’d assert that he was
probably both. One of the world’s most famously eccentric artists cer-
tainly left a museum befitting the stature he earned as an international art
celebrity. The museum, now 25 years old, is uncompromisingly idiosyn-
cratic, maddening, and gently witty. If you think of museums as dry, dusty
places that make your lower back ache, this one may change your notion
altogether. Dalí’s own notion — he designed the museum himself — was
closer to theater.
As an artist, Dalí was famous for surreal and highly charged imagery; as a
personality, he was famous for his eccentricity and exhibitionism. The
museum, like Dalí himself, means to provoke and please. It presents a vari-
ety of Dalí’s works and installations, many of which feature his flamboyant,
Part III: Northern Spain 
186

outrageous Russian wife, Gala. The red building, topped by giant white eggs
and a recently rebuilt glass dome, and decorated with glazed ceramic loaves
of bread, is every bit as understated as the pieces displayed inside — which
is to say not at all. Within you find a salon that uses furniture to teasingly re-
create Mae West’s face (with a sofa fashioned like soft red lips), as well as a
circular central patio that displays an attention-getting work he presented
in New York called Rainy Taxi — a long black Cadillac with sprinklers inside.
(They go off if you drop a coin in the box — Dalí’s untethered commercial-
ism is alive even in death.) Dalí himself is buried in a crypt here, next to a
series of gold cobra statues. A new permanent exhibit, “Dalí-Joies,” in an
adjacent building renovated by the locally famous architect Oscar Tusquets,
displays a typically oddball collection of jewels of Dalí’s design.
Given the crowds and theatrical peculiarities of the museum, expect to
spend the better part of a morning or afternoon here.

nal site, the old Hotel Paris (a 1767 home of a baron). Here you can find
some 4,000 toys, mostly from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including
miniature theater sets, toys belonging to the Catalan artist Joan Miró, and
Dalí’s childhood teddy bear (also displayed are letters the poet Garcia
Lorca, a close acquaintance of Dalí, wrote to the toy bear, named Don Osito
Marquina).

Music and wine in Peralada
Northeast of Figueres, in the Alt Empordà (Upper Plains), the tiny hamlet of Peralada

series (Festival Internacional de Música Castell de Peralada). Some of the world’s
most prestigious opera singers, symphonies, and dance troupes come here every
summer to perform under the stars outside the castle. The setting, under a canopy of
stars in the castle’s gardens, makes for a magical evening. Call the festival organizers

Cadaqués and Port Lligat: Dalí’s stamping grounds
Even after he became an international superstar, Dalí continued mixing
with the wizened fishermen in Cadaqués. The town gained international
fame when Dalí groupies sought out the artist here and next door at 
Port Lligat. Cadaqués certainly looks the part of the perfect seaside
Mediterranean village. Even when bands of playboys and would-be artists
decided to set up camp (and swim in Dalí’s pool), the town didn’t change
all that much. In summer, the area attracts chichi Catalans in fancy cars,
but Cadaqués remains small and cozy, a function of its isolation.
Access to the town is via a very long and winding (by that I mean tortu-
ous) road, so development hasn’t spoiled Cadaqués, as it has some areas
farther down the coast. It’s still a scenic little town — a sun-dappled
cluster of whitewashed houses tucked into the hills with a pretty water-
front. (The beaches, though, are unspectacular by Costa Brava stan-
dards.) Cadaqués is ideal for a day trip combined with a visit to Port
Lligat — or an even longer stay. (I’ve met Europeans who came on vaca-
tion 20 years ago, determined to follow the path of Dalí, and have yet to
leave.) Cadaqués remains a working fishing village; you can watch the
fishermen take the day’s catch right to the restaurant kitchens.
Getting there
Take C-260 from Figueres, and then a twisting, maddening road down to
Cadaqués (38km/23 miles). The Cadaqués tourism office is located on
Cotxe 2-A (% 972-25-83-15). Port Lligat, the tiny harbor where Dalí’s
home is located, is a short drive (or 20-minute walk) north of Cadaqués.
Spending the night
Cadaqués doesn’t offer a whole lot in terms of hotels — just a few stan-
dard places that, although unexciting, are agreeable enough if you don’t
want to drive the twisting road out of town just yet. Two hotels you
might try are Playa Sol (Platja Pianc 3; % 972-25-81-00; www.playasol.
com), with nice views of the Cadaqués Bay and the town, and Port Lligat
(Playa de Port Lligat; % 972-25-81-62), a small, isolated hotel less than a
mile outside of Cadaqués proper.

CATALAN/FRENCH
A sister-run establishment and the best restaurant in town, La Galiota has
been here since Dalí was the star attraction — some 30 years now. Pictures
of the artist on the walls attest to his patronage. Located near the cathe-
dral, La Galiota operates a straightforward, quality-driven kitchen. Good
choices include the marinated salmon al sueco (Swedish style) and beef
tenderloin in Port wine sauce.

Exploring Cadaqués and Port Lligat
Dalí’s house in Port Lligat, a tiny fisher’s village on a secluded cove along
the Costa Brava (1.6km/1 mile north of Cadaqués), is the top attraction
in the area, but Cadaqués is its rival. Taking in the relaxed and extraordi-
narily pretty town and its lovely views is the prime activity — if you can
call that an activity. If you’re moved to do more, visit the cathedral, the
17th-century Església de Santa Maria, and the Museu Muncipal de Arte
Contemporáneo (Municipal Contemporary Art Museum, on Carrer Narcís
Monturiol) for works by Dalí and Picasso. The museum is open Monday
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 9 p.m.
Casa-Museu Salvador Dalí
Dalí built his first home with Gala, his equally eccentric Russian-born wife,
in Port Lligat. The bay views are still as gorgeous as those that seduced
Dalí early in his career, and the village remains isolated — except for the
nearby, wildly incongruous Club Med (where Dalí and his followers would
no doubt be regulars if he were still living).
Dalí’s house in Port Lligat, which climbs a small hill overlooking the bay,
opened to the public in 1997. Dalí and Gala, began to acquire property in
the early 1930s, cobbling together several modest fishers’ residences.
What became their seaside home is rustic, but the decor lives up to
Dalíesque standards — living spaces sport stuffed swans, a lip sofa, and
Dalí-designed chimneys. Gala’s bathroom, filled with photos of the couple
and famous people, is worth a look. She died here in 1982.
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 189

Having such an eccentric character as Dalí living among them must have
been peculiar for villagers in this remote part of northeastern Spain. But
apparently the artist forged good relationships with the people of Port
Lligat and Cadaqués. To this day, local fishers speak of “Señor Dalí,” using
the Spanish term of respect.
Reservations are required to visit; verify hours when making reservations.
Only small groups of eight at a time, with a maximum of 300 people per
day, are allowed entry. A visit lasts about an hour.

Finding Cadaqués nightlife
In summer you find a very agreeable atmosphere along Passeig Marítim
(the promenade) at the water’s edge. Cadaqués slips out of its quiet skin
and gets surprisingly wild at night. A little jazz club on the main drag,
L’Hostal, has an illustrious history; Dalí once strode in with Mick Jagger
on his arm. The club showcases reputable jazz musicians in prime
tourist season and often stays open until 5 a.m. For drinks, try Marítim
(also on the promenade), a bar that’s been around since the ’50s. Enjoy
its nice terrace that overlooks the beach.
Púbol: A castle for Gala
The single reason to visit this tiny, isolated village on the plains of
L’Empordà is to experience the medieval castle Dalí bought for his
beloved princess, Gala.
Casa-Museu Castell Gala Dalí
Dalí made a gift of this 11th-century castle to his wife, Gala, in the late 1960s.
Given the decidedly peculiar marital history of Gala and Dalí, and the fas-
cinating rooms tucked inside the castle’s stone walls, the residence is per-
haps even more interesting than Port Lligat. During the 1970s, Gala lived
here for long stretches of time, while Dalí stayed at the couple’s house in
Port Lligat. Gala allowed Dalí to visit only when she invited him — which
was practically never. The castle, which lords above the town of Púbol, is
considerably more austere than anything people associate with Dalí —
although a stuffed horse greets visitors in the entrance and other odd
Dalíesque touches pop up throughout. In the garden, giant cement ele-
phants (standing awkwardly on spindly giraffe’s legs) spray water through
their snouts, and a small pool is adorned with an assortment of colorful
busts of the composer Wagner. A bit of graffiti reads “Dalí was here.”
Dalí wasn’t of noble lineage, though he pretended otherwise. The king of
Spain did him a bigger favor than he may have known when he decreed
Dalí the “Marqués of Púbol.” Dalí designed a golden throne for his wife, but
he often sat in it to entertain journalists’ questions.
Part III: Northern Spain 
190

Substantiated rumors state that the Púbol castle served as Gala’s love
palace. Even into her late 60s, she entertained a bevy of considerably
younger men, including one young actor/hanger-on whom Gala and Dalí
picked up at a performance of the musical Hair in New York.
After Gala died, and Dalí no longer needed his wife’s permission to come,
he lived in the castle for two years. In 1984, a mysterious, dangerous fire
erupted in the bedroom where Dalí lay asleep. The enfeebled artist barely
escaped with his life, and he never returned to the castle, even though he
once hoped to be buried there alongside Gala.
Anticipate spending an hour at the castle, and make sure that you figure
in transportation time, depending upon where you’re coming from.

L’ Empordà: Visiting Medieval Villages
Several small villages of the Baix Empordà, or Lower Plains, are beauti-
fully maintained medieval gems. The plains are dotted with small towns,
but I suggest visiting Monells, Cruïlles, Begur, Pals, and Peratallada.
They’re all close together, and you don’t need much time to see them —
only long enough to walk around and have coffee or lunch. The nearby
town of La Bisbal d’Empordà is renowned for its ceramics, though much
of what the shops are churning out is pretty mass-produced these days.
The main street is lined with more shops than you can possibly count or
stop in. If you have room to lug something back, it’s definitely worth a
stop. The Baix Empordà is a terrific, relaxed place to spend a few days,
and the region has some of the most stylish country hotels in Spain,
many of them in ancient Catalan masias (farmhouses).
Getting there and getting around
The only reasonable way to see the small villages of the Baix Empordà 
is by car (public transportation is spotty, and it would take you days to
see what you can see in a morning in a rental car). From Barcelona, take
highway A-7 to C-253 and C-255; from Girona, hop on C-255. The towns
are clearly signposted, but if you blink, you’ll miss them, so make sure
you pay attention.

Where to stay and dine in the Baix Empordà
Many of the rustic hotels in the Baix Empordà have excellent restaurants
attached. Note: Several Costa Brava hotels and restaurants are close
enough to be worth considering while you explore this region (see
“Where to stay and dine on the Costa Brava,” later in this chapter.)
AiguaClara Hotel
$$–$$$
Begur
Right in the midst of pretty Begur, a quiet town that makes a great place to
stay, this exquisite, small hotel inhabits the 1866 Colonial-style small
palace. Designed and run by a friendly young couple, the eight spacious
and sun-filled rooms ooze charm and good taste, with just the right touch
of bohemia (seen in old chandeliers, eclectic furnishings, gauzy fabrics,
and warm paint tones). Prices are so reasonable that this is the perfect
place to splurge on the Aiguaclara junior suite, which is two rooms with a
marvelous rooftop terrace. Surprising for such a small hotel, it has a lovely,
distinguished, and good-value restaurant on a covered patio.

INNOVATIVE CATALAN
An adorable little place on the way into town, the elegantly rustic dining
room is like the kitchen of an old farmhouse. The young chef-owner, Sergi
Climent, who worked in some of the most renowned kitchens in Spain, cre-
ates Catalan specialties with innovative twists, using local produce and
meats. The midday menu, one of the most carefully and artistically pre-
sented inexpensive (13€/$16) menus I’ve had in Spain, is a steal.

Castell d’Empordà
A 700-year-old castle magnificently converted into a charming, reasonably
priced small hotel (just 27 rooms), this is one of the finest rural hotels in
Spain. It is stylish and hip, but respectful of its historic frame. In a quiet
corner of the Baix Empordà with a gorgeous large pool, pretty gardens, a
lovely terrace, and spectacular views across the plains, this hotel is a place
to relax and truly enjoy the setting. Rooms in the ancient castle are large
and sumptuously decorated; those in the original tower are smaller,
plainer, and cheaper; and the new garden wing is much more contempo-
rary, though no less comfortable, with in-room balconies offering splen-
did views. Large, brand-new Garden Suites are stunningly chic. I’m
hard-pressed to say which I like more, though given a choice, I might opt

for the Suite Pere Magrit, the ultimate in decadence. Serving fresh
Mediterranean dishes, the excellent restaurant is handsome, but dining
outdoors on the candlelit patio is even more appetizing, as is hanging out
at the bar in the castle’s old wine cellar.

Sa Riera
Tucked between the lovely Sa Riera beach and the handsome hilltop town
of Begur, this newly reconditioned convent is a very nice, quiet place to
stay, with beautiful gardens and a pool. Rooms are well outfitted, if just a
step below deluxe. Although the hotel is cleft into the hillside above the
beach, the only room with a view of the water is the very cool (and rea-
sonably priced) suite in the tower, which contains three narrow floors,
with a sitting room on the third floor from where you can gaze at the ocean.

Monells
The quiet village of Monells, with its atmospheric stone archways, is one
of the Empordà’s stunners, so it’s a pleasure to find a warm and welcom-
ing little inn right on the main plaza. This place, part antiques shop and
part homey, stylish inn, features a half-dozen rooms simply but nicely out-
fitted with furnishings that guests can purchase if they wish. There’s an
antiques shop on the ground floor, and given that and the “lived-in” library,
dining room, and living room, it’s a surprise to find such amenities as a
funky indoor pool with a Jacuzzi and cool skylight, as well as a relaxing
courtyard solarium with a fountain. Rooms have either a terrace or a chim-
ney, and dinner can be arranged for just 30€.

try house is tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the village,

La Plaça de Madremanya

Madremanya
CATALAN
In a tiny, unassuming Catalan village about halfway between Girona and
the coast, this absolutely stunning country hotel, converted from a 14th-
to-15th-century farmhouse, bursts with more chic style than most urban
hotels. The rooms are exquisite, with wonderful, surprising touches. The
room my wife and I stayed in, El Xiprer, had a poetic inscription engraved
in the wall above the bed in large, romantic letters, a splendid terrace over-
looking the gardens, and subtle pool and with distant views of the green
rolling Gavarres hills, and a sumptuous stone bathtub large enough for
indulgent honeymooners. For this level of style and comfort, the place is
unquestioningly a bargain.
Yet the hotel is best known for its handsome restaurant, La Plaça, one of
the finest in L’Empordà and a longtime favorite of vacationing Barcelonans.
Now under the helm of a young, innovative Catalan chef who spent his
childhood in Australia, La Plaça’s prix-fixe tasting menu at dinner, just 40€,
is about as good a haute-cuisine deal as you’ll find in Spain.

Mas de Torrent

Torrent
CATALAN
If you spring for a splurge, this Relais & Châteaux property is the kind of
hotel and restaurant that makes your trip to Spain memorable. A 1751
masía (Catalan farmhouse), the hotel is an exercise in rustic elegance. It’s
charming, peaceful, and geared toward the pleasure-seeker. The gardens
and pool are splendid, and the hotel is perfectly placed for car or bicycle
explorations of the surrounding Empordà (the medieval towns mentioned
in the chapter are just minutes away) and the Costa Brava. Try to get one
of the suites in the main house, because they’re infinitely more charming
than the bungalows in the newer wings; if you’re paying to stay here at all,
you may as well splurge.
The restaurant is easily one of the region’s best, serving fresh fish from
the coast (such as dorada al romero, or John Dory in romero sauce) and
meats from the countryside (try the solomillo de ternera al foie con salsa
de setas — beef sirloin with foie gras and wild mushroom sauce). The wine
cellar contains an outstanding selection of Spanish and French wines.

About a half-mile from the beach, and just outside the perfect medieval

if you’re touring the Costa Brava beaches or inland villages. If you’re stay-
ing overnight nearby (or here — it has 25 comfortable rooms, and a huge
pool, gym, and sauna), it’s also perfect for a romantic dinner. The setting,
amid pine trees and tranquil gardens, is lovely. The menu, like most good
restaurants in the area, focuses on traditional specialties of the Empordà,
such as Rossejat de arroz con gambas de Palamós (a baked rice dish with
shrimp tails). For dessert, don’t miss the helado de crema catalana
(Catalan custard ice cream).

Get out the clubs: Golfing in Girona,
L’Empordà, and the Costa Brava
With nearly a dozen well-kept courses, and offering the possibility to play year-round,
Girona is one of the top golfing regions in Spain. Two courses where you’re welcome
to play are Club de Golf Costa Brava (Santa Cristina de Aro, 5km/3 miles from San Feliú

and sturdy enclaves of medieval stonework, are completely unassuming.
Monells’s main feature is a handsome porticoed main square, while at the
center of Cruïlles, which was once enclosed by walls, is a Romanesque
11th-century monastery.
Begur: A hilltop gem
Gentle, sun-baked Begur occupies a privileged position, with its tile-roof
houses sprinkling the sides of a forested hill, at the top of which are
ruins of a 13th-century, crenulated castle. Many of the houses have a
unique colonial style; in the early 19th century, economic crisis in Begur
prompted many locals to set out for Cuba, and having found fortune
there, they returned to build their colonial-style dream houses (called
casas indianas).
After a look around Plaça de la Villa, the town square, and its small
Gothic church, Esglèsia Sant Pere — which has a fascinating series of
gray-blue, almost chiaroscuro panels behind and above the altar —
climb the antic Carrer del Castell and the paved path that winds up the
hillside to the castle. There you’ll find commanding 360-degree views of
the whole of L’Empordà and the Costa Brava, all the way up the coast to
Cadaqués (38km/24 miles away). A handy circular map at the top helps
you identify all the towns below. Located near excellent beaches (includ-
ing Aiguablava, Sa Riera, and Sa Tuna) and walking paths, and boasting a
couple of terrific small hotels and a superb restaurant (see “Where to
stay and dine in the Baix Empordà,” earlier in this chapter), Begur makes
one of the finest bases from which to explore the region.
Pals: Medieval perfection
A picture-perfect medieval town, Pals sits atop a rise, its silhouette visible
from miles around on the plains. Hugely popular with day-trippers, it’s a
pristine place, meticulously restored and almost too perfect to be real.
The tiny alleys and thick stone walls look as though they might be part of
a movie set. All kinds of Gothic details, such as windows and wells, adorn
Pal’s immaculate mansions. Look for the circular Romanesque tower
Torre de les Hores and the Church of Sant Pere. Climb to the lookout
point Mirador del Pedró for unequaled views of the countryside and
coast (on clear days, you can see the Medes Islands).
Peratallada: An unusual castle
Pals (see previous section) is pretty as can be, but I like Peratallada (peh-
rah-tah-ya-da) even better. More rugged and a bit less slick, it has a his-
tory that’s readily apparent. An old fortified nucleus, the town grew up
around an unusual castle, Castell de Peratallada, which today houses a
fine restaurant and a tiny, charming hotel (see “Where to stay and dine in
the Baix Empordà,” earlier in this chapter). Walking along Peratallada’s
twisting stone streets, you discover a 14th-century palace, a porticoed
main square, and houses rich with Gothic details. The town, a favorite of
in-the-know city dwellers from Barcelona, also has a handful of interest-
ing antiques dealers.

The Costa Brava: Resorts and Rugged Beauty
The fabled Costa Brava, the sandy playground of thousands upon thou-
sands of Europeans, stretches for 200km (125 miles), from Blanes, just
north of Barcelona, all the way to Cap de Creus and the French border.
The coast is an enticing mix of mountains, plains, long sandy stretches,
and tiny, gorgeous coves thick with pine trees.
Unless you want to be sorely disappointed, pick and choose carefully
when deciding where to stay, and which beaches and coves to visit, on
the Costa Brava. In several places — especially the lower half, nearest
Barcelona — some of the most overcrowded, overdeveloped, and repug-
nant tourist ghettoes in Spain have grown up around cheap, mass-market
tourism, and have unforgivably wrecked much of the coast’s natural
beauty. The undisputed megawatt star of the European package tour is
Lloret de Mar, about 56km (35 miles) north of Barcelona. An overdevel-
oped and rather crass commercial beach resort, it’s the equal of Cancún,
or worse. (Other horror spots include Benidorm, near Valencia, and the
Costa del Sol in the south.)
Luckily, other places tucked along the coast are well worth exploring for
their beauty and seclusion, including charming fishing villages, tiny pine-
forested coves, and Empúries, the site of Spain’s most impressive Greco-
Roman ruins. If you choose not to stay right on the coast, you can easily
access these spots from Girona and the medieval towns of the Baix
Empordà that I describe earlier in “L’Empordà: Visiting Medieval Villages.”
In fact, many travelers are discovering that staying at relatively higher-
quality inns in the Baix Empordà is preferable to staying at more conven-
tional beach hotels.
Northern Europeans — Germans, Dutch, French, and, increasingly, such
newly moneyed Eastern Europeans as Czechs and Russians — overrun
parts of the Costa Brava in summer. If you don’t want to feel like you’ve
landed unwittingly in a Euro Club Med, stay away from Lloret de Mar,
Platja d’Aro, and, to a slightly lesser degree, Tossa de Mar. The cliff-top
road that passes these towns, however, makes for a splendidly scenic
coastal drive.
Getting there and getting around
Outside of the major destinations, a car remains your best bet for seeing
the Costa Brava without waiting for public transportation. Unless you
stay at a hotel within walking distance of a beach, a car is particularly
important to get to some of the more isolated coves and beaches. For
more information after you arrive, contact the tourist information offices
in Palafrugell, Carrilet 2 (% 972-61-18-20); Sant Feliu de Guixols, Plaça
del Mercat 28 (% 972-82-00-51); Tamariu, Carrer de la Riera, s/n (% 972-
62-01-93); or Llafranc, Carrer Roger de Llúria, s/n (% 972-30-50-08).
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 197

By car
The main road, C-255, travels along the lower coast and darts inland; 
C-252 is the principal road for the northern half of the Costa Brava. From
these major thoroughfares, you need to get off onto local, signposted
roads, which lead to individual coastal villages and resorts.
By bus
Sarfa (% 902-30-20-25; www.sarfa.com) buses operate throughout the
Costa Brava from Girona and Figueres.
By train
Trains leave from Girona’s Plaça d’Espanya and make their way to sev-
eral points along the Costa Brava, including Llança, Blanes, and Colera,
with increased service in summer. For more information concerning
trains along the coast, call % 902-24-02-02 (www.renfe.es).
Where to stay and dine on the Costa Brava
In the high summer months (July and Aug) you may have a hard time
finding an available hotel room along the Costa Brava, but in the dead of
winter (when the area is actually quite beautiful, and not that cold), you’ll
have trouble finding hotels and restaurants that are open at all. Much of
the coast, including Cadaqués, pretty much boards up the windows. For
dining, try El Bulli, one of Spain’s most celebrated restaurants. It’s very
expensive and difficult to get to, but a singularly rewarding dining experi-
ence for those who make it there. Note that several Baix Empordà hotels
and restaurants — especially those near Begur — are close enough to be
worth considering while exploring the Costa Brava (see “Where to stay
and dine in the Baix Empordà,” earlier in this chapter.)

Roses
FRENCH/CATALAN
South of Cadaqués and east of Figueres, near Roses, is one of the gastro-
nomic highlights of Spain, if not all Europe: the legendary El Bulli, well
worth a road trip for any self-respecting foodie. Ferrán Adrià has become
known worldwide as one of the most innovative chefs working today.
Gourmet magazine called him the “Dalí of the kitchen,” and he is one of the
few chefs ever to grace the cover of the New York Times Magazine. His
restaurant, thought by many to be the best in Spain — it surely is the most
imaginative — is idiosyncratic and experimental. Adrià spends half the
year holed up in a laboratory in Barcelona creating intoxicating new dishes
using revolutionary techniques. The menu is ever-changing, and individual
courses are almost beyond description: items dominated by air, foam, and
liquid, which you have to see and eat to believe just how good they truly
are. The wine list and service are appropriately first-rate. True, getting a
reservation is next to impossible (I’ve read that El Bulli receives 30,000
requests a month), and eating here may require a special slush fund, but

El Far Hotel Restaurant
$$$$–$$$$$
Platja de Llafranc
The owners of Mas de Torrent (see “Where to stay and dine in the Baix
Empordà” section, earlier in this chapter) opened this small hotel with
great old bones — the cliff-top property includes a 17th-century hermitage
and a 15th-century lighthouse — on a historic site high above the Bay of
Llafranc. The hotel is perched on a coastal hill amid thick pine forest and
walking trails with just nine charming and colorfully decorated rooms built
around a beautiful interior 18th-century patio. From the balconies of sev-
eral rooms, and the terrace overlooking the ocean, the 180-degree unin-
terrupted views of the sea and coastline are absolutely unbeatable. El Far
is a hugely popular site for weddings, and any other time it makes for a
very refined and relaxed stay. Serving seasonal Catalan cuisine, the restau-
rant is excellent, and both half- and full-board programs are available.

Hostal de la Gavina
$$$$–$$$$$ S’Agaró
CATALAN
One of the most famous hotels on the Costa Brava, this classic retreat —
which has hosted everyone from Humphrey Bogart to Mick Jagger — is
tucked in popular and touristy S’Agaró (between Sant Feliu and Cap Roig).
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 199

Swimming in Old World luxury and Mediterranean style, graceful and ele-
gant Hostal de la Gavina has welcomed Spaniards and international guests
with perfect service and comfort since 1932. It’s clearly not your typical
Costa Brava hotel. Rooms are opulent with quality antiques and furnish-
ings, and the hotel features include an Olympic-size salt-water pool graced
by statuary and a full spa. Tennis, horseback riding, and massages are also
options. The elegant rooms overlooking the gentle curve of S’Agaró Beach
are consistently in high demand.
If you can’t squeeze in an overnight stay, or prefer to indulge your taste
buds, the hotel’s restaurant (same phone number) is also one of the finest
on the Costa Brava. The elegant dining room serves fine Catalan cuisine,
including great fresh seafood, and the more informal terrace offers lighter,
but still excellent dishes.

Hotel Aigua Blava
$$$–$$$$
Aiguablava
On Fornells cove, next to the water and surrounded by a remarkable
expanse of private gardens, this midsize hotel is one of the better con-
ventional beach hotels along the Costa Brava. In my opinion, it’s prefer-
able to the nearby parador (government-run hotel) even if it doesn’t have
the latter’s dramatic cliff-top location. Rooms are large and airy, the serv-
ice personal and gracious. Enjoy the tennis court, pool, and superb views
of the cove from the garden — all elements sure to appeal to the kids. The
restaurant (same phone number) serves local Ampurdanés cuisine and is
fairly priced.

Hotel Llevant
$$$–$$$$
Platja de Llafranc
This traditional family-run hotel, right on one of the prettiest coves along
the Costa Brava, has been around since 1935. Nicely updated, and with a
terrific restaurant that opens right to the beach, it’s one of the better small
coastal properties, but you pay for the privilege of walking out your door
and right onto the sand.

La Xicra
$$$–$$$$
Palafrugell
CATALAN
For fine local Catalan cooking in the heart of the Empordà region, La Xicra
(shee-kra) is well worth a stop. The kitchen continually comes up with cre-
ative dishes that bring in both regulars and tourists. From fish soup to
calçats (long green leeks, a Catalan specialty) and merluza al cava (hake —
a white fish — in Catalan sparkling wine), choosing an unsatisfying dish
here is nearly impossible.

Parador de Aiguablava
$$$
Aiguablava
CATALAN
With an enviable perch among the pine trees on a tiny peninsula above a
beautiful cove and the Mediterranean Sea, this modern white box of a hotel
is a favorite with many travelers, even if it diverges from the more stan-
dard offerings of the generally excellent parador chain (see Chapter 7 for
more information on paradores). The views are astonishing, and the pool
quite nice, but it’s a little hard not to find it a blight on the surrounding
cliffs and forest. If you can get past that, this well positioned hotel, with
contemporary, well-kept rooms, is the best place to discover that Spanish
paradores don’t always occupy castles and palaces.
The restaurant (same phone number) serves local Ampurdanés cuisine,
and is very fairly priced. Its young chef, Lluis Ferrés, is quickly gaining a
reputation for his creative local dishes (18€–32€/$23–$41), like suquet de
rape (monkfish stew). The wine cellar is one of the better ones on the
coast.

Exploring the Costa Brava
Sant Feliu de Guixols is the beginning of the “good” Costa Brava. A his-
toric, easygoing town with a tenth-century church and a lovely 18th-
century chapel high on a hill overlooking the rugged coastline, Sant Feliu
de Guixols is now mostly submerged under the primary industries of
tourism and second-home ownership. Kids of all ages may get a kick out
of the Museu D’Història de la Joguina (Toy Museum), Rambla Vidal 48.
Palamós, an attractive old fishing village, with boats bobbing in two
bays, is an interesting study of a Costa Brava town caught between tradi-
tion, centered on fishing, and modern development, focused on tourism.
Its Old Quarter is mostly dwarfed by new construction, though it hides a
few traditional restaurants.
Chapter 11: Girona and the Costa Brava 201

Some of the most attractive coves and beach spots along the entire coast
are near Palafrugell. Calella de Palafrugell, Llafranc, and Tamariu — the
latter, lined with the tamarind trees that give the town its name — are all
small, gentle protected spots with good swimming and excellent paths
for walking up into the pine-forested hills. Tiny, predominantly white-
washed villages, many of them old fishing villages, are tucked in among
the rocks, trees, and white sands, with clusters of family-run hotels and
restaurants, perfect for leisurely beach stays.
High up on Cap Roig, a peninsula near Calella de Palafrugell, is an incred-
ible estate that once belonged to a Russian army general (referred to
simply as “El Ruso”). It is now a botanical garden (% 972-61-45-82) with
extraordinary Mediterranean gardens and super views of the coast. In
July and August, the garden hosts the Festival Jardins de Cap Roig, fea-
turing jazz, flamenco, and world music, as well as theater productions.
Also worth a visit, for the stunning coastal views alone, is El Far de Sant
Sebastià, a 19th-century lighthouse high above Platja de Llafranc. It’s
now a luxury hotel and restaurant, El Far Hotel Restaurant (see “Where 
to stay and dine on the Costa Brava” earlier in this chapter).
Farther north along the coast, near the town of Begur (see “Exploring
the Baix Empordà” earlier in this chapter) are gorgeous coves, including
Aiguablava, Sa Tuna, Sa Riera, and El Racó.
Taking a side trip to the Greco-Roman 
ruins of Empúries
Near the summer resort town of L’Escala, along the coast, are the exten-
sive ruins of a Greco-Roman city, Museu d’Empúries, or the Museu
d’Arqueologia de Catalunya (% 972-77-02-08; www.mac.es), one of the
most fascinating archaeological finds in Spain. Three different civiliza-
tions settled on the coast here between the seventh and third centuries
B.C.: the Indigetes, the Greeks, and the Romans. (Empúries is the only
place in Spain with incarnations as a Greek village, an Iberian settlement,
and a Roman town.) The sea wall is an important engineering achieve-
ment, and the Roman mosaic floors are equally impressive.
To visit Museu d’Empúries, take N-II north and make the turn-off toward
the coast and L’Escala (signs indicate the Museu d’Empúries). Getting
there by bus is a little complicated. You have to take the Sarfa Girona–
L’Escala bus and ask the driver to let you off at Empúries, which is a ten-
minute walk from the main road. Admission is 2.50€ ($3) adults, 2€
($2.40) seniors and students 16 to 18, and free for children under 16.
Hours are June 1 to September 30, daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., October 1
to May 31, daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

S
pain’s great, green north — España Verde — begins in the Basque
Country and Navarra, just west of the French border. These historic
regions, wedged between the Pyrenees Mountains and the Cantabrian
Sea, are characterized by rugged terrain and a famously reserved, inde-
pendent-minded people. Yet the regions are also famous for star attrac-
tions with all the quiet and reserve of a Hollywood Oscar bash: Bilbao’s
gleaming Guggenheim Museum, San Sebastián’s sparkling bay, prized
beaches, and a world-class dining scene, and Pamplona’s daredevil
Running of the Bulls.
Bilbao, San Sebastián, and Pamplona are all within two hours of each
other by road or rail. The wine country of La Rioja is also only a couple of
hours south from any of these cities. Not called España Verde for nothing,
the north is characterized by frequent mist and rain, though brilliant sun-
shine is also delightfully common, and the region is spectacularly green
year-round. Spring, summer, and fall are terrific seasons to visit northern
Spain, though in July and August, San Sebastián is full of vacationing
Spaniards and French, and Bilbao’s Guggenheim is packed with tour
groups. The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona is the second week in July,
when coming up with a hotel room is pretty well impossible.
If you were to come to Spain for the sole pleasure of eating — not at all
an absurd notion — the Basque Country is where you’d want to head
first. So elevated and varied are the culinary arts in this part of the coun-
try that a gastronomic tour could begin and end in the Basque Country.

The Basque Country (País Vasco) and Navarra
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 205
Fine dining is an inalienable fixture of Basque culture. At private gastro-
nomic societies, members get together to cook for each other, eat, and
philosophize about food. Basques talk about food even more than they
talk about politics. From tantalizing tapas — works of art called pintxos
(peen-chohs) in these parts — to nine-course tasting menus at Michelin
three-star restaurants, exalted dining is an everyday affair.
Major Attractions in the Basque 
Country and Navarra
Thanks in large part to the Guggenheim Museum’s popularity, travelers
are discovering a region that has been a secret kept by a select few:
brawny green hills, a rocky coastline, and an imaginative cuisine that
many consider the finest in all Spain.

Bilbao
The gateway to the Basque Country, Bilbao is Spain’s biggest commer-
cial port and the political capital of the Basque Country, an inhospitable
region that repelled both the Romans and the Moors. The city stretches
more than 16km (10 miles) along the River Nervión. Once known only for
its shipping and steelworks prowess, it’s now experiencing an architec-
tural and cultural renaissance. Indeed, Bilbao seems to be challenging
Barcelona for cutting-edge design, and swank new hotels, shops, and
restaurants have mushroomed in the past five years. Here you find the
Guggenheim Bilbao, Frank Gehry’s modern masterpiece; the Casco
Viejo, or Old Quarter, the lively heart of the city; and superb Basque
dining and pintxos (tapas or Spanish appetizers).
San Sebastián
The other prominent Basque city, one that delights visitors, is San
Sebastián, one of Spain’s loveliest and most elegant cities. Capital of
Guipuzcoa province, it’s an easygoing, sparkling resort town on Spain’s
northern coast, just downwind from Biarritz in southwestern France.
San Sebastián’s aesthetic and culinary delights have held vacationing
Spaniards and French in thrall for more than a century. The small city
has an incomparable setting — the city curves deliciously around a half-
moon bay, and hills frame it at either end — perfect for panoramic pic-
tures. Here you find La Concha, Spain’s best urban beaches and
esplanade, the mouth-watering tapas bars of the Old Quarter, and gour-
met dining at Spain’s best restaurants.
Pamplona
Although Pamplona (and its province Navarra) isn’t technically part of
the Basque Country, it shares ancient roots with the Basque people. In
Part III: Northern Spain 
206
The name game
As in Catalonia, street signs can get a little confusing up north in the Basque Country.
Since the Basques were granted regional autonomy, the area has seen a resurgence
of Euskera, the impenetrable and mysterious Basque language (though Spanish is still
the primary language for most). Although not as widely spoken as Catalan, Euskera is
officially represented almost anywhere you go, and knowing at least the names of
cities can help. The Basque Country is called País Vasco in Spanish but Euskadi in
Euskera. In Euskera, Bilbao is written Bilbo, San Sebastián is Donostia, Pamplona is
Iruña, and Navarra is Nafarroa. Sanfermines (san-fehr-mee-nehs) is the summer fes-
tival with the Running of the Bulls; the actual sprint is called an encierro (en-thyeh-
roh). And, most important, tapas are called pintxos (peen-chohs) up north. See
“Basque-ing in obscurity: Language and politics,” later in this chapter, for more on
Euskera.

Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 207
Basque-ing in obscurity: 
Language and politics
The Basques are one of the most ancient peoples in Europe. Some theorists believe
that they’re indigenous Iberian peoples descended from the Cro-Magnon man. Others
propose, somewhat less convincingly, that the Basques are the living link to the lost
city of Atlantis. Modern Basques don’t feel the least rootless, however; they revel in
their unknown origins, a distinction that sets them apart from the rest of Spain.
The Basque language, called Euskera, completely baffles linguists and ethnologists.
Wholly unrelated to any living language, Euskera, scholars believe, pre-dates all Indo-
European tongues. Look at the preponderance of letters k, t, x, and y, and the language
is sure to mystify you as well. Although only a third of the population actively speaks
it (but it is growing in popularity), schools teach Euskera, and local TV and radio pro-
gramming broadcast in the language. Unlike with Catalan or Gallego, a knowledge of
Spanish will get you nowhere. Basque is insanely difficult to pronounce and master.
Knowing an obscure language such as Hungarian or Finnish would likely provide you
with a better warm-up!
Not only can no one identify the origins of Euskera, but the language contains no swear
words. Basques must dip into Spanish when they want to curse — a case for bilin-
gualism if ever there was one.
Although Basques take their language and unique culture very seriously, Basque pol-
itics is an even more complicated matter. Within Spain and the rest of Europe, the
Basque Country is at least partially, and unfortunately, known for a secretive terrorist
group, known by its Basque-language acronym ETA. For decades, ETA (which stands
for Basque Nation and Liberty) has demanded independence from Spain and the
establishment of a Basque nation. The sinister organization has pursued this goal with
extreme, though highly targeted, violence; hundreds of police, military personnel, and
politicians have been assassinated on behalf of the cause over the years. The group’s
terrorist actions have provoked wide-scale public repudiation across Spain.
As a tourist, you’re extremely unlikely to see any signs of the shadowy group. Few of
the terrorist acts are committed on home turf, and ETA almost always refrains from
indiscriminate mass killing and usually immediately claims responsibility. The previ-
ous Aznar administration — which got a lot of political mileage out of its hard-line
policy against ETA — sought to place the blame for the 2004 Madrid train bombings
on Basque terrorists, and the government’s deception led to its electoral defeat later
that year.
A true breakthrough in the decades-long conflict appeared to occur when ETA
announced a “permanent cease-fire” in March 2006, and Spain’s Socialist-led gov-
ernment said it would enter into talks with ETA to ensure a lasting peace after 40 years
of violence. However, just five months later the terrorist group warned of an impasse,
citing its disenchantment with the government’s continued pursuit and arrests of
Basque citizens and politicians, and ETA issued a statement that said the peace
process was in crisis.

certain parts, locals still speak Euskera. The ninth-century fortified capi-
tal of the Kingdom of Navarra, Pamplona is a modest, provincial city
with relatively few big attractions. However, it gets the attention of Spain
and much of the world during its annual July eruption of daring — prac-
ticed locals and crazed visitors running through the streets with harried
bulls at their heels. Here you find San Fermín and the Running of the
Bulls, Europe’s liveliest and most dangerous street party. You’ll also find
the Cathedral, a Gothic landmark, and the impressive Navarra Museum,
near the city’s medieval walls, and the new Oteiza Museum, dedicated
to the sculptor Jorge Oteiza.
Bilbao: A City Rejuvenated
Bilbao, just 16km (10 miles) from the Cantabrian Sea, is split down the
middle by the Nervión estuary — what locals call the ría. Founded in
1300, the city’s atmospheric Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) sits on the right
bank, connected by four bridges (including one by the other architect 
of the moment, Santiago Calatrava) to the much larger modern section
(Abando, or New City) on the left bank. Between the Casco Viejo and the
river is a wide promenade, the Arenal. The main commercial street, Gran
Vía, bisects the modern part of the city, a grid called the Ensanche (the
Enlargement). The new Guggenheim Museum hugs the riverbank on the
northern side of modern section, while across the river is the district
known as Uribarri.
The city’s industrial image has given way to a remarkable transformation
spurred on by the Guggenheim. New chic hotels, restaurants, and shops
now populate the city, and local government is in the process of com-
pleting a thorough redesign of the riverfront, adding dramatic landscap-
ing and public spaces. The finished project will represent one of the
most significant urban revitalization programs in Europe.
Getting there
For information on quick trips to Bilbao from either Madrid or
Barcelona, see the sidebar entitled “To Bilbao and back in a day.”
By plane
Bilbao’s spectacular airport, Aeropuerto Internacional de Bilbao-
Sondica (% 94-453-23-06), designed by the renowned Santiago
Calatrava, lies 10km (6 miles) north of the city. It’s the only international
airport in the Basque Country and the one with the most flights to
Madrid and Barcelona. Iberia, Spanair, and Air Europa all fly to Bilbao
from other Spanish cities, and major international carriers, such as
British Air, Alitalia, and Lufthansa, arrive from European cities. The air-
port is easy to get around. Check out the very helpful tourism office
(open 7:30 a.m.–1 p.m.) right after you pick up your bags and visit the
car-rental agencies, if you want to get wheels for exploring the Basque
Country (País Vasco).

Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 209

The airport bus (% 94-448-40-80), just out in front of the airport, takes
you along the river to the city in about 30 minutes for only 1.20€ ($1.44).
(Note, though, that even if a bus is waiting to depart, surly drivers may
not let you board until they’re good and ready to go.) The bus drops 
you off next to the river, at the open-air bus station across from the
Ayuntamiento (City Hall). The yellow urban bus returning to the airport
from Plaza Moyua in the new town is the Bizkaibus, No. A3247, marked
“Bilbao-Aeropuerto.” It leaves every 30 minutes starting at 6:15 a.m.
A taxi from the airport to downtown costs about 18€ ($22). Taxis line up
out front where you catch the bus (most taxis are pretty fancy rigs in
northern Spain — Mercedes and Audis).
By car
You can easily access Bilbao by national highway from Barcelona (A-2)
and Madrid (A-1), as well as from France (A-8) and Pamplona (the N-240).
From San Sebastián, Bilbao is due west along A-8.
By bus
The main bus terminal is Terminbús (% 94-439-50-77), next to the San
Mamés subway station. Transportes Pesa (% 902-10-12-10) buses travel
between San Sebastián and Bilbao (one-and-a-quarter hours); Autobuses
La Unión and La Burundesa arrive from Pamplona (two hours). The ANSA
bus line connects Bilbao to Madrid and Barcelona. See www.bilbao.net
(click on “Movilidad y Transportes,” then “Accesos a Bilbao,” and then
“Autobuses Interurbanos”) for a complete listing of bus companies, ori-
gins, and destinations.
By train
The RENFE train station is located at Estación de Abando, Plaza
Circular 2 (% 902-24-02-02). Long-distance trains come from and go to
Madrid (a six- to seven-hour trip) and Barcelona (a 12-hour trip), as well
as Málaga and other cities in northern Spain. Eusko Tren, Calle Atxuri 6
(% 94-433-95-00 or 902-54-32-10) is the line for travel to and from San
Sebastián and Guernika.
By boat
The Pride of Bilbao ferry (P&O European Ferries) travels to Bilbao
twice a week from Portsmouth, England (www.poportsmouth.com; 
% 08705-980-333 in the United Kingdom; % 902-02-04-61 in Spain). The
trip lasts between 30 and 33 hours — not something to be taken lightly,
especially with all the frequent, low-cost European flights available.
Getting around Bilbao
In Bilbao, you can cover almost all points of interest on foot or on the new,
efficient Metro (subway) or even newer EuskoTran, the tram. If you’re
traveling to other city destinations in the region, you don’t necessarily
Part III: Northern Spain 
210

need a car (buses are considerably cheaper and easier to ride to both San
Sebastián and Pamplona). For most rural destinations, though, a car is
nearly essential.
On foot
If you stick to the New City (Abando) district and waterfront near the
Guggenheim, walking is the best way to get around Bilbao. Though it’s a
very long walk from there to the Old Quarter (Casco Viejo), after you’re
in the old section, the atmospheric streets are perfect for walking (and
in fact the only way to get around).
By car
To explore the countryside around Bilbao (and perhaps visit the Basque
part of La Rioja; see the “Taking side trips from Bilbao” section later in
the chapter), a car is your best option. The roads are among the best in
Spain, though highway tolls are high. You can find major rental compa-
nies at the Bilbao airport, including
 Avis (% 94-427-57-69)
 Europcar (% 94-423-93-90)
 Hertz (% 94-415-36-77)
By Metro
The new Metro Bilbao (% 94-425-40-25; www.metrobilbao.net),
designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Sir Norman Foster, is
exceedingly clean and efficient. You can’t miss the unmistakable entry-
ways, which are fanciful Plexiglas domes. Trains run from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Monday through Thursday, from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday, from 6 a.m. to 
5 a.m. Saturday, and from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday. A single ticket costs
1.20€ ($1.50); a ten-journey “BonoPlus” ticket — a much better deal — is
2.50€ ($3), while a single-day pass costs 3€ ($3.60).
By tram
The convenient, bright-green EuskoTran (% 900-15-12-06; www.
EuskoTran.es) is a brand-new tram (tranvía) that runs along the river-
front through the Ensanche to the Casco Viejo, with stops at the
Guggenheim Museum and Arriaga Theater. Trains, which connect with
the Metro, RENFE, and bus stations, run every five to ten minutes from
6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 11:45 p.m. week-
ends. A single ticket costs 1€ ($1.20), while a day pass is 3€ ($3.60).
By taxi
Bilbao’s taxis are plusher than in other parts of Spain, but they’re also
more expensive — so don’t hail a cab for very short journeys if you can
walk. Recommended operators include Radio Taxi Bilbao (% 94-444-
88-88), Radio Taxi Nervion (% 94-426-90-26), or Tele Taxi (% 94-410-
21-21).

Spending the night
Until the Guggenheim Museum landed like a shiny spaceship on the
Nervión River, business travelers were Bilbao’s most frequent visitors.
Today, the construction of new hotels is catching up with tourists’
sudden interest in the city.
Because Bilbao is still a business capital with continual convention and
fair visitors during the week, you can get excellent weekend deals at
many hotels. A tourist service called Bilbao Reservas (% 902-877-298)
can help make reservations at any level of hotel.
Gran Hotel Domine Bilbao
$$$$–$$$$$
New City (Abando)
If you’re lucky enough to score a room facing the Guggenheim Museum
just across the street, you’ll wake up with a picture window full of glitter-
ing titanium courtesy of Frank Gehry. This new, ultramodern hotel is
designed to reflect — literally, because it’s covered in mirrors — some of
the glamor, grace, and attention associated with the Guggenheim. Like the
museum, it’s ultrahip and reeks of mod style, with bold furnishings, cool
lighting, a tall flooded atrium (which contains a massive totem stone sculp-
ture and funky dish-plate waterfall by the hotel’s designer, Javier Mariscal),
and a futuristic cocktail lounge. The rooms are chic, decked out in light
woods and sleek furnishings; executive rooms sport spectacular bath-
rooms with platform tubs that allow bathers to peek through smoked glass
at the Guggenheim. The rooftop terrace, where breakfast is served, over-
looks the museum from a privileged bird’s-eye perspective. If you’re a
design freak who has come to Bilbao primarily to experience one of the
world’s great new architectural landmarks, this large hotel occupies an
unparalleled location — and is, along with the Miróhotel down the street,
the place to stay.

Hotel Carlton
$$$–$$$$
New City (Abando)
Over the years, the Carlton has been occupied by the glamorous and pow-
erful: Orson Welles, Ava Gardner, and the Republican Basque government
during the Spanish Civil War (I imagine the latter group got a great dis-
count). A grand, gleaming building right on handsome Plaza Moyúa, the
Carlton is the city’s most prestigious hotel. Constructed in 1925 in the Belle
Epoque style (an elegant architectural style popular around World War I),
and recently refurbished from head-to-toe, the hotel has continental-style
rooms that are elegant and spacious with boldly patterned drapes and bed-
spreads. It’s the kind of refined, Old World décor that will please individu-
als who aren’t fans of the stripped-down modern luxury that now
Part III: Northern Spain 
212

dominates the upper end of Bilbao hotels. The Carlton’s preeminence
among top-tier hotels has been seriously challenged by the Domine and
Miróhotel, both of which are right across from the Guggenheim, but for this
kind and level of luxury, this traditional hotel remains an excellent choice
as well as a good value. And the Guggenheim is only a ten-minute stroll
away.

Hotel Conde Duque
$$$
Along the river (Uribarri)
Facing the space-age Calatrava Bridge, and walking distance downriver
from the Guggenheim, this comfortable, midsize hotel is very well located.
The top-floor rooms used to have great views of the “Guggy,” until a
sprawling modern building was erected next door. But some rooms still
have good views of the river. Accommodations, overhauled in 2002, are
often whimsically decorated in bright colors, comfortable but not what I’d
call luxurious, and vary greatly in size (some are huge, some are tiny; ask
to see a few upon arrival). The bathrooms, however, are uniformly large.
The Conde Duque’s standard rack rate is overpriced, but significant dis-
counts are frequently available.

Hotel López de Haro
$$$$
New City (Abando)
For discreet, traditional elegance, this refined midsize hotel is the place to
be in Bilbao. Tucked away on a quiet street in the modern section of town
near the river, the López de Haro opened in 1990 and has been robbing the
city’s other top hotels of clients ever since. It’s intimate and handsome,
with a clubby feel. The rooms and bathrooms are five-star elegance all the
way, and the restaurant, Club Nautico, is excellent.

Hotel Sirimiri
$$
Old Quarter
This small hotel in the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) is rather poetically
named: Sirimiri means “fine mist,” which is the kind of weather you’re
almost certain to find in Bilbao — though I can’t say that it accurately
describes this functional, clean, and very good-value small hotel. Rooms
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 213

are good-sized with yellow walls; bathrooms are sparkling, with pearly
gray tile. With a dry sauna, hydromassage, and a small gym, the hotel fea-
tures some surprising extras. And with its personal service, it’s a pretty
good deal — though a long hike from the Guggenheim.

Miróhotel
$$$–$$$$
New City (Abando)
This sedately stylish boutique hotel is the first such project for the cele-
brated Barcelona fashion designer Antonio Miró. The hotel is a perfect
reflection of his clothing: clean lines, tranquil colors, meticulous attention
to detail, and understated luxury. It’s modern and high-tech, but not in
your face about its hipness. Just a block down the street from the
Guggenheim, and around the corner from Bilbao’s other great museum,
the Museo de Bellas Artes, Miróhotel is perfectly located for artheads. And
for a bit of extra pampering, unusual for a hotel of this size, it has a cool
gym and spa downstairs, with excellent massages available, as well as a
funky cocktail bar and a superb breakfast buffet. Rooms facing the river
have superb views, although some construction is still ongoing along the
riverfront promenade.

Petit Palace Arenal
$$–$$$
Old Quarter (near the Arenal promenade)
At the gate to the Old Quarter, next to the Teatro Arriaga, this modern,
midsize hotel, which prides itself on having the latest in high-tech facili-
ties, is a good bet with a good location, especially if you’re interested in
exploring the Casco Viejo and its pintxos-haunts and bars. The hotel inhab-
its a mid-19th-century building that was once home to the old Hostal
Arana. Rooms aren’t overly large or luxurious, though they are nicely dec-
orated with a sleek, clean aesthetic. Free high-speed Internet access is
available in all rooms.

Dining in Bilbao
Gastronomes delight in Basque cooking, the most accomplished in Spain.
Basque cuisine means fresh seafood, delicate sauces, and pintxos, the
stacked tapas of the Basque Country. Top things off with txakoli, a young,
fresh, fruity white wine that’s slightly fizzy and a perfect accompaniment
for seafood and light dishes.
Part III: Northern Spain 
214

Bilbao ranks second only to San Sebastián for the number of great
Basque restaurants — which means that it’s one of top places to eat in
Spain. Although it’s not cheap to dine at the more celebrated Basque
restaurants — in fact, it’s downright pricey — you can eat very well
focusing solely on delectable pintxos, or tapas (see “The art and ritual 
of the pintxo” in this chapter).
The Basque Country is lodged between the Bay of Biscay and the rugged
Pyrenees, so it’s only appropriate that the cuisine is inspired in equal
parts by the mountains and the sea. Basques delight in succulent lamb
and game, but they adore the day’s catch: bacalao (salt cod), grilled
clams, squid, tuna, and baby eels. The Basque’s love of sauces is second
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 215
The art and ritual of the pintxo
Tapas are found across Spain, but nowhere are they the art form that they are in the
Basque Country. In fact, calling them mere tapas is to do them a serious disservice.
Tapas in Euskadi are so elaborate that they are named for the toothpicks — 
pintxos — that you use to spear the small stacks of smoked salmon, marinated squid,
tortilla, salt cod, and pastries stuffed with chicken and capers. They are quite often
minimeals, artistically presented to delight both the eye and the taste buds.
Throughout the Basque Country, but especially in Bilbao and San Sebastián, coun-
tertops are lined twice a day with a smorgasbord of delectable pintxos. The ritual is
easy: Muscle up to the bar of any place with plenty of noise and hungry mouths inside,
and grab the tastiest morsel within your reach. Ask for a vino tinto (glass of red wine),
cerveza (beer), or txakolí (fizzy Basque white wine, pronounced cha-koh-lee) and keep
track of how many drinks and pintxos you have. This informal style of snacking or
dining operates strictly on the honor system. Finger counting and pointing does fine
when you need to calculate the bill.
At one or two euros ($1.20–$2.40) a pop, pintxos may seem like a cheap way to eat.
And they can be, if you exercise restraint, but they’re so good that doing so is a tall
order. It’s nearly impossible to resist reaching for one more . . . then one more . . . and
still another “last one.” Pretty soon, your meal of snacks turns into a full meal, cost
included. (In fact, a lunch of pintxos may be more expensive than a fixed-price menú
del día, but it’s also more fun.) Be careful if you’re watching your wallet — or your
weight!
You can find the bulk of the top-notch pintxos bars in Bilbao’s Casco Viejo (and the
enchanting area called Siete Calles, or Seven Streets). Among those worth seeking out
are Victor Montes, Plaza Nueva 8 (see full review later in this section); Bar Irrintzi,
Santa María 8 (% 94-416-76-16), one of the hippest spots, with artistic pintxos (and
little flags describing what they are); Berton, Jardines 11 (% 94-416-70-35), which
specializes in Iberian hams and traditional pintxos; Café Bar Bilbao, Plaza Nueva 6
(% 94-415-16-71); and Gatz, Santa María 10 (% 94-415-48-61). Tiny Taberna Taurina,
Ledesma 5 (no phone), at the edge of the Abando district, is loaded with bullfighting
photos and paraphernalia.

perhaps only to the French; their passion for food, however, is second 
to none.
Bilbao has a few classic old cafes, good places to get a jolt of espresso or
a cerveza and talk about the Guggenheim (or take a breather from a
tapas crawl). Café Boulevard, Arenal 3 (% 94-415-31-28), on the perime-
ter of the Casco Viejo, and just down the street from the Teatro Arriaga,
is the oldest cafe in Bilbao. Since 1871, literary types have come to this
Art Deco place, which, in addition to a full lineup of caffeine and drinks,
has a pretty good assortment of pintxos and cheap platos combinados
(combination platters), ideal for a quick lunch. Café Iruña, Berasetegui 5
(% 94-423-70-21), full of Moorish-looking, colorful tiles, dates to 1903.
Finally, Café La Granja, Plaza Circular 3 (% 94-423-18-13), around since
the 1920s, is one of the old-time, simple coffee shops frequented for
merienda, the term for a late-afternoon snack.

tipping, see Chapter 2.

COUNTRY BASQUE
Ideally positioned between the Museo de Bellas Artes and the
Guggenheim, this relaxed, rustic restaurant is perfect if you’re looking for
a lunch spot between cultural visits. It serves Basque home cooking, as
opposed to the alta cocina, or haute cusine, found at high-end restaurants
in the city. The place looks a bit like a farmhouse’s interior, with wooden
tables, and the menu serves up very good, and inexpensive, items you’d
expect to find in the countryside: croquetas (ham croquettes), stuffed red
peppers, massive steaks, and simple fresh fish. It’s the perfect place to
wash your meal down with a bottle of txacolí (fizzy white wine) or sidra, the
cider that’s so popular in the countryside.

BASQUE
One of the best-known restaurants in Bilbao, this rustic chalet looks like a
gussied-up ski lodge. It’s a place to snuggle up and try tremendous tradi-
tional Basque dishes — especially if you’re unfamiliar with Basque cook-
ing. The chef, Fernando Canales, performs what amounts to a daily primer
of the food of his hometown. For starters, try homemade chorizo (a spicy
Spanish pork sausage) or wild perrichico mushrooms. Main courses
include entrecote (a boned rib steak) with foie gras (goose-liver pâté), lan-
goustines (prawns) with oyster ravioli, and sea bass with tomato vinai-
grette and artichoke. A specialty that makes Bilbao natives weep is
kokotxas al pil-pil (fresh cod filets from the “chins” of the fish, cooked in a

wonderful as main dishes.

Guggenheim Bilbao
$$$$
New City (Abando)
BASQUE
Dining at the Guggenheim Museum reveals, appropriately, the art of
Basque cooking. Carved out of the museum’s peculiarly shaped interior,
with furniture designed by none other than Frank Gehry, is an excellent
restaurant that long ago opened to glowing reviews and has been jam-
packed every night since. The menu, the work of star Basque chef Martín
Berasategui (and carried out by his protégé, Josean Alija), has as much
flair as the playful dining room. Choose from items del mar (from the sea)
or del campo (from the countryside). You can’t go wrong on the menu, but
you may start with the large and chunky lobster salad, perhaps followed
by duck cannelloni. The dessert sampler is heaven for those with a sweet
tooth. Although the restaurant isn’t cheap, it is certainly high-value, and
the lunch deal is a definite bargain.
The restaurant within the Guggenheim is so popular that you may need to
call ahead of your visit to Bilbao; in the past, the wait has been two weeks
or more. For the fixed-price lunch (for which no reservations are taken)
arrive as early as possible, because it’s usually totally booked by about
1:30 p.m. (You can also try the more accessible lunch cafeteria, which has
an affordable menú del día.)

A casual place, popular with young couples and families, this quality, good-
value restaurant specializes in Valencian-style rice dishes and paellas —
quite a change from the more intricate cooking and sauces of the north.
The menu offers nicely prepared fish and meat dishes, such as beef sirloin
in garlic oil, but nearly everyone orders one of the multitude of arroces, or
rice dishes, which are brought to the table on elevated paella pans. The
wine list is quite affordable, although none of the wait staff seems to know
much about the wines on offer.

Old Quarter
BASQUE/TAPAS
Planted on Plaza Nueva in the Casco Viejo, Victor Montes is a classic
Basque restaurant and pintxos bar. Basque tourism officials could set up
cameras during tapas hour and film a winning ad for Bilbao here. Lined
with wine bottles, the restaurant is like a cross between an Art Nouveau
pharmacy and a wine cellar. It has a cool bistrolike dining room downstairs
that opens onto the bar and a lovely, more intimate room upstairs (as well
as covered tables in the plaza). The real action is at the bar, however,
where amazing specialty pintxos (of cod, squid, and spinach tortilla — you
name it) are piled high. They fly off the bar into the hands of impatient but
good-natured regulars. The easygoing atmosphere, not to mention the deli-
cious tapas, appeals to kids.

Zortziko
$$$$
New City (Abando)
BASQUE
Around the corner from the Guggenheim, in a chic neighborhood, Zortziko
has been the pinnacle of alta cocina dining in Bilbao for several years. The
sophisticated kitchen combines innovative dishes and traditional Basque
items. Choose from sea bass roasted in Rioja red wine, prawns with mush-
room risotto, or rare pigeon breast in a sweet red wine sauce. Daniel
García’s tasting menu isn’t cheap, but it’s a memorable smorgasbord,
which is a good move if everyone at your table is willing (and able — it’s
a ton of food) to go that route. Zortziko is elegant and more formal than
most other restaurants in Bilbao, so you may want to dress up a bit. The
wine cellar is one of the most extensive in the Basque Country with more
than 600 wines. If you want a wine from 1889 or one that goes for 3,000€
($3,600), Zortziko is the place (but you can also get bottles for as little as
12€/$14). Less formal and less expensive, but very nearly as highly rec-
ommended, is the sister restaurant El Viejo Zortzi, Licienciado Poza 54
(% 94-441-92-49). Decorated in bold colors and with a funky, easygoing
style, it also serves excellent Basque cuisine and changes its highly selec-
tive wines every two weeks.

to the Guggenheim Museum. By all means, beeline to the wondrous
museum, which meets and beats expectations, but don’t miss out on
exploring Bilbao’s other attractions, including its atmospheric Casco

Viejo (Old Quarter) and its other very worthwhile museum, the fine
Museo de Bellas Artes.
The Bilbao Tourism Office offers guided, 90-minute “Panoramic and
Monumental Bilbao” walking tours, leaving every Saturday and Sunday
at 10 a.m. from the BIT office at the Teatro Arriaga (3€, or $3.75, adults).
The language of the tour depends upon the linguistic leanings of the
group assembled. Contact Bilbao Iniciativas Turísticas, Plaza Arriaga 1

Bus Visión Bilbao at Calle Marqués del Puerto 9, offers 90-minute bus
tours of the city (passengers can get on and off at any of nine stops
throughout the day). Daily departures are at 10 a.m., and 12, 4, and 6
p.m. at the Plaza del Sagrado Corazón; stops at the Guggenheim, techni-
cally the last stop of the tour, are 90 minutes later at each interval 
(% 94-410-40-04; www.bisertur.com). Commentary is in Spanish and
English, as well as in Euskera and French. Adult price is 6€ ($7.50), and
for children younger than 12, it’s 3€ ($3.75). It’s also possible to get a
combined ticket good for a Casco Viejo walking tour and the tour bus,
good for 48 hours; adult price is 12€ ($15), students and seniors 10€
($13) and for children ages 6 to12, 6€ ($7.50).
For a bird’s-eye view of Bilbao, or to entertain the kids, take the elevator
near the Ayuntamiento (City Hall) by the river — at Calle Esperanza 6 —
to the upper town. You can reach the massive Gothic church Basílica de

Casco Viejo
Old Quarter
Just east of the Nervión River is Bilbao’s Old Quarter. Though Bilbao dates
to the Middle Ages, it isn’t rich in medieval buildings and monuments.
However, the small Casco Viejo, or Old Town, designated a “national his-
torical and artistic monument,” dates from the city’s founding in 1300 and
remains a great and lively part of the city. One atmospheric section is
known as Siete Calles, named for the seven parallel streets that begin at the
river. They’re packed with restaurants and bars, and any day of the week
after work, large groups spill noisily into the streets as they pursue a
Basque ritual dear to their hearts and stomachs: the poteo, or tapas crawl.
Wander the Old Quarter as the mood strikes, stopping here and there for
small glasses of wine or beer and assorted pintxos. At the edge of the
barrio are the impressive Teatro Arriaga, a 19th-century theater, and the
neighborhood’s most important church, Iglesia de San Nicolás. Don’t miss

Plaza Nueva (on Plaza Arenal), the spiritual heart of old Bilbao, which has
64 arches and only slightly fewer tapas bars. Also nearby is the Catedral
de Santiago, originally constructed in the 14th century, and then restored
in the 16th century after a fire.
You can take a good walk around the district in under two hours.

Museo Guggenheim Bilbao
New City (along River Nervión)
Frank Gehry’s critically lauded, much-photographed museum was called
the “greatest building of our time” by Philip Johnson, himself a legendary
New York architect. Imagining a more exciting art and architecture expe-
rience than the one Gehry crafted on the banks of the River Nervión in
Bilbao is impossible. When the Guggenheim Foundation announced its
plans to build another European branch in this rough-and-tumble indus-
trial city in Spain, the art world was shocked. What’s more shocking is the
commanding success of the museum’s design and execution. It’s as if
Gehry took a look at the magnificent Frank Lloyd Wright–designed
Guggenheim in New York and said “I’ll raise you one.” The Bilbao museum
is just about perfect: daring, inspired, and conceptual. It is a sculpture on
a monumental scale.
As revolutionary as it is, its detractors are few — if any exist. Locals affec-
tionately call it “Guggy” (pronounced goo-ghee) or “El Guggen,” and it has
single-handedly brought new life to Bilbao. The building is sheathed in
30,000 thin titanium panels, which are like the scales of a gigantic fish.
Sadly, the panels are already beginning to show signs of deterioration, but
they still shimmer in the sun. The structure’s sensual curves give it the
sensation of motion, as does the soaring atrium; when you wind your way
through the structure, you keep returning to the building’s heart. Except
for Richard Serra’s stunning sculpture, Snake (perfectly in tune with the
long “fish gallery”), the museum is almost wholly given over to itinerant
exhibitions and works on loan from the other Guggenheims — but, frankly,
it could be empty and still be a spectacular art experience. The giant,
cuddly sculpture that sits guard at the street is Jeff Koons’s Puppy; cov-
ered in fresh flowers, it was to have been merely a temporary presence at
the museum. Locals and museum-goers were so fond of it, though, that the
Guggenheim was persuaded to make it a permanent watch dog.
Bilbao’s Guggenheim is wildly popular, drawing about two million people
a year, but it rarely feels too crowded to appreciate. Allow at least two
hours to see the museum, and more if the temporary exhibits interest you
(in that case, expect to spend the better part of a full morning or after-
noon). See the sidebar “Getting the most out of the Guggenheim” for
advice on tours and discounted admission.

Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao
New City
The Guggenheim’s not the only art show in town, though it does unfortu-
nately overshadow the excellent Fine Arts Museum, founded in 1908. The
latter’s rich and varied collections include paintings by the Old Masters
El Greco, Zurbarán, and Goya; contemporary artists such as Francis Bacon
and Antoni Tàpies; and a survey of 19th- and 20th-century Basque artists.
Eduardo Chillida’s large-scale Monument to Iron is a good introduction to
the work of this tremendous Basque sculptor. The museum, exempt from
the crowds across the way at the Guggenheim, is nicely quiet most of the
time. Art fans may need a couple of hours here; those with only moderate
interest can make do with an hour.

Getting the most out of the Guggenheim
To get the most our of your Guggenheim experience, keep these tips in mind.
Listen up: Try the excellent hand-held audio tours (included in the admission cost),
which offer an analysis of the building’s revolutionary architecture and commentary
from the architect, Frank Gehry. The go-at-your-own-pace tour also leads you through
the current exhibitions.
Guided tours: The Guggenheim offers excellent free guided visits in English, Tuesday
through Sunday at 11 a.m., and 12:30, 4:30, and 6:30 p.m. A special family tour — at this
writing, in Spanish only — is Sunday at noon. Guided tours focus on current tempo-
rary exhibitions and the museum’s architecture and permanent collection. To reserve
a guided tour, call % 94-435-90-90.
Art bargain: Combined entrance to the Guggenheim Museum and the next-door Bilbao
Museum of Fine Arts is just 12€ ($15) with the “Bono Artean” Joint Voucher, which you
can purchase at the box office of either museum (just 1.50€, or $1.90, more than
entrance to the Guggenheim only).
Go when everyone’s having lunch: To have the Guggenheim virtually to yourself, eat
an early lunch and go to the museum from 1 to 4 p.m. — when Spaniards and many
European visitors clear out. In summer and on weekends, though, you have a harder
time buying yourself this lunchtime peace and quiet.

Guggenheim. Admission: 5€ ($6.25) adults, 3.50€ ($4.40) students and seniors, chil-
dren under 12 free; free Wed. Combined entrance with Guggenheim (Bono Artean

Museo Vasco
Old Quarter
This interesting museum of Basque archaeology and ethnography occu-
pies a handsome Jesuit colegio (high school) and its beautiful cloisters in
the Old Quarter. Well-designed exhibits address the ancient history of the
Basque people, including carved stonework, prehistoric utensils, furni-
ture, and ceramics. Allow an hour, at least.
See map p. 209. Plaza Miguel de Unamuno 4. % 94-415-54-23. www.euskal-
museoa.org. Metro: Casco Viejo; EuskoTran: Ribera. Admission: 3€ ($3.75) adults,
1.50€ ($1.90) students, children under 10 and seniors free. Open: Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–2 p.m.
Shopping for local treasures
Bilbao’s best shopping areas are the Old Quarter and, in the modern sec-
tion of town, along Gran Vía — the long, elegant main drag — and Calle
Ercilla. Fine clothing shops abound, and cutting-edge fashion has flour-
ished in the wake of the Guggenheim’s arrival. For chic women’s fash-
ions, check out Corso XXI, Heros 21 (% 94-423-23-36) and Stock Options,
Elcano 11 (% 94-416-72-71).
One of the most emblematic things you can buy in Bilbao is an authentic
Basque boina (beret). The oldest hat shop in town, run by seven broth-
ers who are fourth-generation hat makers, is Sombreros Gorostiaga,
Victor 9, in the Old Quarter (% 94-416-12-76). If the talkative brother,
Emilio, is working, he can tell you more than you ever wanted to know
about berets, including how to prop one on your head like a Basque. A
good beret, durable enough for daily wear in Bilbao’s constant mist, runs
about 20€ ($24) or so.
The Basques make a fashion statement with their berets; few men of a
certain age dare leave the house without their favorite boinas artfully
perched atop their heads. Emilio Gorostiaga says that abuelos (old
timers) buy a new beret and stick it under the mattress for a year, until
they deem it wearable. The lesson? Never fold your beret; you must
store it perfectly flat. And never, ever buy a boina that’s not 100 percent
wool. Such a beginner’s mistake is considered sacrilege in these parts.
For a good selection of wines from La Rioja, Ribera del Duero, and other
regions in Spain, visit D’Vinno La Tienda, Ibañez de Bilbao 6, or the Club
de Gourmet at the Corte Inglés department store, Gran Vía 7–9 (% 90-
222-44-11). Basandere, Iparraguirre 4 (% 94-423-63-86), near the
Guggenheim, has cool T-shirts and other gift items from the Basque
Country.

222

Hitting the tapas bars and more: Bilbao’s nightlife
Bilbao’s best early-evening scene is the one spilling out of the pintxos
bars in the Casco Viejo. Basques are enthusiastic about food, and all that
excited noise you hear is probably people talking about what they’ve just
eaten. Crammed in the Siete Calles district of the Old Quarter are more
bars than you can ever visit; stick your head in any that seem appealing,
order a beer or a glass of wine, and snatch some snacks off the bar. Join
the flow as it rolls on to the next spot and repeat steps one through
three. On weekend nights, Siete Calles becomes a boisterous affair, with
crowds of jovial bar-goers spilling out into the streets. The most easygo-
ing scene in the Casco Viejo is the Plaza Nueva, where several bars oper-
ate terraces with outdoor tables, perfect for a relaxed drink.
Perhaps it’s because of the frequent mist and green hills of the Basque
Country that so many Irish pubs populate Bilbao. If you’re looking for 
a pint of Guinness, Bilbao will almost seem like Dublin or Galway. The
Dubliners, Plaza Moyúa 6 (% 94-423-03-20); Molly Malone, Particular
Estraunza 8 (% 94-427-11-47); and, perhaps the best of the lot, The
Wicklow Arms Irish House, Rodríguez Arias 30 (% 94-442-51-48), are
but three of a couple dozen Irish pubs in the city.
Hot dance clubs include Congreso, Uribitarte 8 (% 94-424-73-82), which
has been around a decade but is still stylish, with good house and elec-
tronic music, go-go dancers, and audiovisual effects; and The Image,
Sabino Arana 56 (% 94-668-28-66), a large and flashy club with house
and alternative music in one section and more classic R&B and funk in
another.
Several hopping gay bars populate Calle Barrencalle in the Old Quarter.
The High Club, Calle Naja, is one of the most popular, and active, gay

Gettin’ jazzed
Be-boppers dig the Basque Country in summer, when three major jazz festivals play
the north of Spain, all in the span of three weeks. The Bilbao Getxo Jazz Festival,
which started in 1976, hits the stage the first week of July with performers such as Bill
Bruford and Phil Wood. Jazzaldia, the San Sebastián Jazz Festival, has grown steadily
since the mid-’60s. Hosting a wide range of musicians, such as James Brown, Keith
Jarrett, and Van Morrison, it draws music fans the last week in July. A short drive from
either of those cities is Vitoria, which hosts a highly touted festival in mid-July. In past
summers, Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Paco de Lucía, and Wynton Marsalis have all
dropped in on the Vitoria-Gasteiz Festival de Jazz.
You can obtain schedules and ticket information for the Basque Country Jazz Festivals
at the following numbers and Internet addresses: in Bilbao (% 94-491-40-80; www.

dance clubs, with porn films and a secret “dark room.” Badulake, Hernani
10, is a cabaret-type bar with a good indie soundtrack and drag shows
Thursday through Saturday at 11 p.m.
If you’ve had your fill of pintxos, check out the Teatro Arriaga, Bilbao’s
handsome monument to high culture. Opera, dance, theater productions,
and a wide variety of concerts play at the theater, a 19th-century gem
renovated and reopened in 1986. Call % 94-479-20-36 for program infor-
mation. Opera performances and concerts by the Basque Symphony
Orchestra are also staged at the Palacio Euskalduna, Abandoibarra 4 
(% 94-431-03-10; EuskoTran: Abandoibarra). Gamblers and night owls
won’t want to miss Bilbao’s Gran Casino Nervión, Calle Navarra 1 (% 94-
424-00-07), open daily from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. (entrance 3€, or $3.75).
Bilborock, Muelle de la Merced (% 94-415-13-06) is housed in an old
church, but plays host to gods of rock most nights. Eclectic and often
adventurous live acts play at Kafé Antxokia, San Vicente 2 (% 94-424-

% 94-410-49-51), where Antonio Flores and other well-known national
and international performers have appeared, is a stalwart of the live
pop, blues, and rock scene.
Taking side trips to La Rioja Alavesa: 
Wine and gastronomy
Spain’s oldest and most traditional wine region is La Rioja, the fertile
province immediately south of the Basque Country and Navarra. The Ebro
River runs through a valley of lush vineyards and ancient towns in the
shadows of the stony Sierra Cantabria peaks. Many of Rioja’s finest winer-
ies are in fact clustered in the Basque province of Alava, on the north
bank of the Ebro; the wine region there is known as La Rioja Alavesa.
Haro, an hour-and-a-half south of Bilbao, is the winemaking capital of La
Rioja Alta (Upper Rioja). The spectacularly located and marvelously pre-
served walled medieval village of Laguardia (about 20 minutes east of
Haro), rising on an outcropping in the midst of vineyards all around, is
one of the highlights of a trip to the region, as are visits to wineries
(bodegas), both modern and starkly traditional. Haro and Laguardia
make excellent bases for exploring the region.
In recent years, other winemaking regions, such as Priorat, Toro, and
Rioja’s perennial rival Ribera del Duero, have succeeded in stealing
some of the thunder from Rioja, but in the last few years, many Rioja
winemakers have adapted and modernized and are again producing
some of the country’s finest wines — many of which are considerably
bigger and denser than the typical past Riojas. (See Chapter 2 and the
Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book for more information on
Part III: Northern Spain 
224

Spain’s wine regions and vintages.) Just as notable is the sudden impact
of wine and gastronomy tourism, which has resulted not only in more
wineries opening their doors to the public, but also in the importation of
such superstar architects as Frank Gehry, Santiago Calatrava, and Rafael
Moneo, who have built bodegas and luxury hotels in the midst of the
vineyards in the Upper Rioja.
Although the area is accessible by bus from Bilbao as well as from
Pamplona, a car is necessary if you want to explore the region beyond
the main towns. And although you could theoretically see a winery or
two and either Haro or Laguardia in a rushed day trip, whether or not
you’re a wine aficionado, I’d strongly advise spending a night or two in
the area to get to know this pretty and historic region. In addition to
great wines and great food, you can choose from several terrific country
hotels.
Haro
Approximately 110km (68 miles) south of Bilbao, Haro (ah-roh), at the
edge of the Río Ebro, is the capital of La Rioja Alta. Driving south from
Bilbao, take A-68, the national highway, past N-622 (the turnoff to
Vitoria) to Haro. If you don’t have a car, you can get to Haro but getting
to the wineries will be more difficult. From Bilbao, you can take Auto-
buses La Unión Alavesa (% 944-27-11-11). La Estellesa (% 948-22-22-
23; www.laestellesa.com) runs daily buses from Pamplona to Haro.
You’ll quickly see evidence of the local importance of the wine industry,
as a disproportionate number of vinotecas (wine shops) and taverns
populate the small town. Haro’s lovely, tranquil Casco Viejo, or Old
Quarter, is full of stone churches and aristocratic mansions with glass
balconies. Worth a look are the Renaissance church Parroquia de Santo
Tomás, a National Monument with a sculpted portal on Plaza de la
Iglesia, and the (naturally peaceful) Plaza de la Paz.
Rather less atmospheric is the dry and didactic Museo del Vino de la
Rioja, or Rioja Wine Museum (Av. Bretón de los Herreros 4 (% 941-31-
05-47; 2€/$2.50; Mon–Sat 10 a.m–2 p.m. and 4–8 p.m. and Sun 10 a.m.–2
p.m.) in the modern section of town. It offers three floors of background
on the winemaking process and history of grape cultivation in La Rioja,
information that is routinely passed on (in a much more engaging
manner) in most winery visits.
Haro is at its finest during the last week of June, when the fiestas of San
Juan, San Felices, and San Pedro converge and wine flows even more
freely than usual in town. On June 29, the feast day of San Pedro, the
annual Batalla del Vino (Wine Battle) rages in Haro; echoing a medieval
conflict between neighboring communities. The event features partici-
pants climbing the Riscos de Bilibio, a nearby hill, and dousing each
other with red wine. Haro’s fiesta day, September 7, is also a great deal
of fun.
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 225

Visiting the bodegas
Many of the wineries that you can visit in and around Haro have been
producing wine since the late 19th century. Many of the oldest bodegas
in Rioja — where you’ll see oak casks and deep cellars rather than stain-
less steel vats and modern technology — are just a short drive from
town, in the Barrio de las Bodegas across the Río Tirón. Haro’s tourist
information office, Plaza Monseñor Florentino Rodgríguez, s/n (% 948-
30-33-66), has maps of the bodegas as well as helpful information about
the Ruta del Vino (Wine Route) and winery tours. Some 17 wineries are
in the immediate area of Haro, with at least nine offering regularly sched-
uled tours (some require appointments in advance). A few charge for
visits, while others don’t (though almost all include tastings at the end
of tours). Among the best for visitors (in the order of my preference) are
 Bodegas Muga: Av. de Vizcaya, s/n (% 941-31-18-25; www.bodegas
muga.com; 75-minute tours Mon–Fri 10 a.m. in English, 11 a.m and
noon in Spanish; 5€, or $6.25). Founded in 1932, Muga is one of the
best-known Rioja wineries, producing excellent reds such as Torre
Muga and Aro. The tour is one of the best and most popular, taking
visitors down to see the massive, picturesque oak wine vats, which
are hand-crafted on-site. You don’t need to make an appointment
for winery visits.
 Bodegas C.V.N.E.: Av. de Vizcaya, s/n (% 941-30-48-09; www.cvne.
com; free tours Mon–Fri 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. in Spanish, 11 a.m. in
English; Mon–Thurs 4 p.m. in English). This family-owned winery,
the makers of Imperial and Viña Real wines, began in 1879 and
nicely combines traditional Rioja winemaking with innovative 
Part III: Northern Spain 
226
The wines of La Rioja
The La Rioja province is synonymous with winemaking in Spain, but in fact Rioja’s vine-
yards extend into the Basque Country and Navarra. Rioja was the first wine region in
Spain to receive the Denominación de Origen (Designation of Origin, or D.O.), in 1926,
although documentation of efforts to safeguard the quality of local wines dates back
as far as 1650. In 1102, though, the King of Navarra had already issued a legal recog-
nition of Rioja wines. Today Rioja is one of 56 designated wine regions in Spain, and
its largest, with more than 1,300 registered bodegas and winegrowers. However, it is
the only region so far to be designated Denominación de Origen Calificada, or D.O.C.,
which denotes wines of superior quality. The predominant varietal in red Rioja 
wines — for which the region is best known — is Tempranillo, although Garnacha,
Marzuelo, and Graciano are also used. Rioja’s whites are made from Viura, Malvasia,
and Garnacha Blanca grapes.
To find out more about the categories of aged wines (crianzas, reservas, and gran
reservas), see Chapter 2. For additional information on Rioja wine history, vintage rat-
ings, and more, see www.riojawine.com.

technology; the bodega still largely consists of the original 19th-
century buildings that are set around a courtyard. A prior appoint-
ment is necessary.
 Bodegas Bilbaínas: Av. de Vizcaya, s/n (% 941-48-69-99; free tours
Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. in either English or Spanish). This
historic winery, founded in 1901 and the makers of Viña Pomal, was
recently acquired by the Codorníu (makers of cava) family, but it
continues to adhere to traditional methods. A prior appointment is
necessary.
 Bodegas Ramón Bilbao: Av. Santo Domingo 34 (% 941-31-02-95;
www.bodegasramonbilbao.es). This 75-year-old winery and clas-
sic Rioja producer on the outskirts of Haro, offers tours (in Spanish
and English) of its traditional bodega (3€/$3.75) Wednesday to
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to
1 p.m. A prior appointment isn’t necessary, but the winery recom-
mends calling in advance to make sure tours will be held on the day
in question.
The Beronia Association, Plaza Monseñor Florentino Rodgríguez, s/n
(% 914-30-33-66; www.beronia.org) conducts organized, instructional
wine tastings in English, Spanish, and French.
If you’re shopping for wine to lug home, check out Vinícola Jarrera, Calle
Castilla 3, and Calle Santo Tomás 17 (% 941-31-14-25), or Rodríguez
Alonso, Conde de Haro 7 (% 941-30-32-72), both of which have excellent
rosters of Rioja wines.
Where to stay and eat in Haro
If you’re looking to stay the night in Haro, check out the elegant Los
Agustinos, a 14th-century convent handsomely converted into a hotel,
Calle San Augustín 2, Haro (% 941-31-13-08; www.aranzazu-hoteles.
com. Rack rates: 97€/$121 double). Rooms are very comfortable, if not
overly luxurious, and there’s a nice restaurant on-site. The hotel is at the
edge of the Old Quarter, across the street from the Tourism Office.
The finest restaurant in town — and one of the best in the entire region —
is the new and elegantly understated Las Duelas (Plaza Monseñor
Florentino Rodgríguez, s/n; % 941-30-44-63). Although quite upscale, it’s
the place for fine Rioja cuisine and fine wines from local producers — a
winemaker or two is likely to be at the next table — in Haro. The wine list
is definitely impressive with a number of bottles that are very hard to get
elsewhere. Casa Terete, Lucrecia Arana 17 (% 941-31-00-23), a 19th-
century inn near the Plaza de la Iglesia in the Old Quarter, is another good
choice. It specializes in lamb roasts.
Laguardia
Approximately 150km (93 miles) south of Bilbao and east of Haro, but
across the provincial border in the Basque Rioja Alavesa, is the charm-
ing 12th-century village of Laguardia. Enclosed by thick medieval walls
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 227

and rising proudly above the surrounding vineyards in the Ebro Valley,
against a backdrop of the Sierra Cantabria mountains, it is one of the
loveliest small towns in northern Spain. Its narrow, cobbled, and largely
pedestrian-only streets are lined with noble stone mansions from the
16th to 18th centuries, and tucked within the walls are tiny, quiet plazas
and churches. Beneath the town are its famous cuevas, or bodegas, sev-
eral hundred deep catacomblike cellars that once served as hideouts
and provisions-storage when the town was called La Guardia de Navarra,
a strategically important military fortress. Today its importance, how-
ever, is due almost entirely to the wine industry and wine tourism.
Worth visiting as well is the Gothic Iglesia de Santa María de los Reyes,
begun in the 12th century in the Romanesque style and completed 300
years later, with a spectacularly carved Gothic portal. Its bell tower,
Torre Abacial, functioned as a military tower in the 13th century. To visit
Santa María, you have to ask for the keys at the tourism office (% 945-
60-08-45) in the Casa Palacio de Samaniego, on Plazuela de San Juan.
The Renaissance Samaniego palace is itself one of the most beautiful
buildings in town. The oldest example of civil architecture in Laguardia
is the Casa de la Primicia, on Calle Páganos, constructed at the end of
the 14th century.
Visiting the bodegas
The bodegas for the past 150 years have served as private wine cellars.
Guests staying at the Posada Mayor de Migueloa (see the next section,
“Where to stay and eat in and around Laguardia”) can visit its deep cel-
lars and taste wines still produced by that family-owned winery (and
hotel and restaurant).
Your best chance to see what lies beneath Laguardia’s streets is at
Bodegas El Fabulista, next to the Casa de Samaniego and the tourism
office, which offers regular visits for the general public and is one of the
most charming wineries you’re likely to visit. It dates to the 15th century
and produces only a few thousand bottles of wine a year, including
about 32,000 liters by the traditional maceración, or grape-stomping,
method. On the ground floor are the two lagars, where the stomping is
done, along with a wine press from 1903. The maze of cellars that
descend 7m (23 ft.) below the street, where you can taste wines, contain
stone- and brick-vaulted ceilings and date to the eighth century. Call 
% 945-62-11-92 for an appointment, or stop by; tours (5€, or $6.25) are
generally scheduled Monday to Saturday at 11:30 a.m., and 1, 5, and 
7 p.m. (Sun 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. only). If you’re lucky, Fernando will be
your guide, and perhaps Eusebi, the winemaker, will be on hand to com-
ment on his wines. The winery has gotten so popular recently, with so
many international group bookings, that it may be necessary to reserve
your place in advance online at www.bodegaelfabulista.com. Among
the artisanal wines produced here in limited production are El Fabulista
and Fábula.
Part III: Northern Spain 
228

On the outskirts of Laguardia is Bodegas Palacio, a large-scale producer
that’s been making wines since 1894 and now operates an excellent inn
and restaurant in its old bodegas (see below). It offers tours (3€, or
$3.75) Tuesday through Friday at 1 p.m. and Saturday at 12:30 and 
1:30 p.m.; prior appointment by telephone is necessary. The winery, an
interesting mix of traditional and modern winemaking (and wine archi-
tecture) is located on the Carretera a Elciego (% 945-62-11-95). Its
notable wines include Cosme Palacio y Hermanos and Glorioso.
Bodegas Ysios, owned by a large winemaking group with properties in
several regions, has turned the quaint bodega tradition on its head. Its
stunning winery is the work of the famed architect Santiago Calatrava
(designer of the Athens Olympic Stadium, the Milwaukee Museum of Art,
and the forthcoming Port Authority train station in New York City). His
interpretation resulted in what appears to be a modern cathedral of
wine with an undulating roofline that resembles the Sierra Cantabia and
a grand altar window that frames the village of Laguardia in the distance.
Inside, the winery is sparkling and somewhat antiseptic, with stainless
vats, and the tour is pretty pro forma — but the Calatrava building is
worth the trip. The winery is located 2km (11⁄4 mile) from Laguardia on
the Camino de La Hoya; % 945-60-06-40). Guided tours (3€, or $3.75)
are at 11 a.m., and 1 and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and at 11 a.m.
and 1 p.m. on weekends. Call ahead, although you could probably just
show up and be accommodated.
In the tiny village of Elciego, 6km (2 miles) from Laguardia, is the winery
most everyone is talking about: Bodegas Marqués de Riscal, one of the
region’s oldest. It was founded in 1860 and has long produced some of
the most renowned wines in Spain, but it recently made news by con-
tracting none other than Frank Gehry, the architect of the Guggenheim
Bilbao and the Disney Center and countless other modern masterpieces,
to build a small luxury hotel, spa, and visitors center on its campus in
the middle of 220 hectares (543 acres) of vineyards. Hotel Marqués de
Riscal — part of a grand “Ciudad del Vino” (City of Wine) project that
includes a restaurant and facilities for wine therapy and wine study —
finally opened in 2006. It’s a swank 43-room hotel that’s as idiosyncratic
and attention-getting as you’d expect a Gehry-designed property to be,
and it is likely to change the face of wine tourism in this laid-back region.
Even without the new hotel, the large winery is a fascinating blend of
ancient tradition and modern technology, ranging from futuristic com-
puter controls to what the winery calls its “Cathedral of Wine” but what
looks more like a Cemetery of Wine. Deep beneath the symmetrical
arches of the 19th-century cellars are where 140,000 bottles, represent-
ing every vintage since 1862, are stored. They’re eerily covered in cob-
webs and thick mold. Because of the delicate storage conditions, groups
can only peek in the gate. You can arrange visits (Mon–Sat; 6€/$7.50) by
calling % 945-60-65-95 or contacting the winery through its Web site,
www.marquesderiscal.com. To get there from Laguardia, drive south
on A-3210.
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 229

Another bodega with a fancy, imported-architect makeover is Viña Real,
Ctra. Logroño a Laguardia, Km 4.8, Laguardia (% 945-62-52-10; www.
cvne.com/desarrollo/html/vina_real.html). Owned by the well-
known family-operated C.V.N.E., which recently celebrated 125 years of
winemaking, this bodega opted for an innovative and sleekly modern
(and award-winning) new building, part of which resembles a giant wine
vat, designed by the French architect Philippe Mazières and inaugurated
in late 2004. For information about visits, call or contact the winery via
its Web site.
Where to stay and eat in and around Laguardia
Even without counting the new super-luxury Gehry hotel and spa at
Marqués de Riscal (see the previous section), three of the best small
country hotels in northern Spain are in and around Laguardia, reason
enough to spend a couple of nights in the region and take a more
leisurely approach to visiting its small towns and wineries. Posada
Mayor de Migueloa, Mayor de Migueloa 20 (% 945-62-11-75; www.
mayordemigueloa.com; Rack rates: 93€/$116 double) is an absolute
charmer, an upscale family-run inn and restaurant (and winemaker)
within the old walled section of Laguardia. Rooms are warm and inviting,
with stone walls and wood-beamed ceilings; the swanky restaurant is
superb; and beneath the house, open to guests, are wine cellars built 
in 1619.
Another great location for wine aficionados is just down the hill from
Laguardia, the small hotel at Bodegas Palacios, the Hotel Antigua Bodega
de Don Cosme Palacio, Carretera de Elciego, s/n (% 945-62-11-95; www.
habarcelo.es; Rack rates: 68€–74€/$85–$93). True to its name, the inn
occupies parts of the old cellars at this winery, built in the late 19th cen-
tury. Rooms are named for grape varietals, but the handsome Tempranillo
Suite is the only one to look out over vineyards. The restaurant, which
serves very good Rioja specialties and house wines, is a big draw even for
people not staying at the hotel, so reservations are recommended. If you
stay but don’t take the wine tour, don’t miss the chance to walk around
the cellars and mural-covered walls beneath the hotel and restaurant.
In the nearby village of Samaniego is another wonderful small hotel and
restaurant, Hotel Palacio de Samaniego, Calle Constitución 12 (% 945-
60-91-51; www.palaciosamaniego.com; Rack rates: 52€–88€/$65–$110
double). Housed in an exquisitely restored 18th-century palace, a stone’s
throw from the bodegas of Remírez de Ganuza (one of my favorite Spanish
wines), this tasteful inn, run by a young couple, is very peaceful and beau-
tifully decorated. It is also an excellent value. Outside of high season, the
delightful restaurant, run by the Basque chef Jon Ugalde, who studied
under the renowned San Sebastián chef Martín Berasategui, is open 
only on weekends. It serves a good-value tasting menu for 40€, or $50.
Samaniego is west of Laguardia on A-124.

San Sebastián: Food Capital on the Bay
Elegant, seaside San Sebastián (called Donostia in the Basque language)
is the capital of the tiny Guipúzcoa province. Sandwiched between two
green hills (Monte Urgull and Monte Iguelda) and fronting a beautiful half-
moon bay (Bahía de la Concha), the city is one of Spain’s most spectacu-
lar. Two long beaches, La Concha and Ondarreta, follow the gentle curve
of the bay, while the residential neighborhood of Gros faces a third beach,
Zurriola, popular with locals. Those beaches, as well as a cool summer cli-
mate and the finest dining in all of Spain, are why San Sebastián, a city of
just 180,000 residents, swells with Spanish and international vacationers
and French weekenders from just across the border.
Once a quiet fishing village, San Sebastián became a fashionable resort
for aristocrats and royalty in the late 19th century, after Queen Isabel II
headed to this coast in search of a cure for a pesky skin ailment. The
royal court, including her son King Alfonxo XII and Queen María Cristina,

Fast Facts: Bilbao

followed, building the Miramar Palace and transforming the Bahía de la
Concha into one of Spain’s chicest spots.
The city retains much of its past grandeur, ranging from quiet medieval
alleyways to stately Belle Epoque apartment buildings, wrought-iron
lampposts, sculpted bridges, and wide boulevards. A handsome prome-
nade, where locals seem to be forever strolling, frames the gentle curve
of the main beaches. But perhaps the most interesting section of town is
the Parte Vieja, the Old Quarter, home to a warren of ancient streets and
plazas that hide dozens of pintxos bars. San Sebastián also hosts impor-
tant annual jazz and film festivals, which attract big-name international
stars.
Getting there
Despite its huge popularity as a resort for Spanish and French visitors,
very few airlines fly into San Sebastián; instead, they go to the main
regional airport in Bilbao, just 75 minutes away. You may want to con-
sider that factor when planning a trip to the Basque Country (such as
visiting Bilbao first before hopping a bus or driving to San Sebastián).
By air
Relatively few visitors arrive by air, because connections to nearby
Bilbao are much more frequent and extensive. The city’s airport,
Aeropuerto de San Sebastián, is 20km (12 miles) from the city in
Fuenterrabia (% 943-66-85-00). Frequent Bizcai Buses (6 a.m.–10:30 p.m.)
travel to San Sebastián from the airport.
By car
You can reach San Sebastián from Bilbao along the main coastal high-
way, A-8; the trip takes about an hour. From Pamplona, take A-15 fol-
lowed by N-1. From Barcelona, the fastest route is through Pamplona
(A-15), from Madrid, through Bilbao (A-68).
By bus
San Sebastián is well connected with major cities. The routes are espe-
cially painless in the Basque Country, where the bus is faster than the
train. The city is a one-and-a-quarter-hour bus rise from Bilbao and a little
more than one-and-a-half hours from Pamplona (buses leave every half
hour). The major bus companies are Pesa, for Bilbao and other points 
in the Basque Country (% 902-10-12-10); La Roncalesa, for Pamplona
(% 943-46-10-64); and Vibasa, for Barcelona (% 943-45-75-00; www.
vibasa.es). The bus station is at Plaza Pío XII (% 902-10-12-10).
By train
Trains to San Sebastián roll in from Madrid and Barcelona, as well as from
Bilbao (though the train from the latter meanders along the coast and
takes twice as long as the bus). The train station, Estación el Norte (for
RENFE trains), is at Av. de Francia, s/n (% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es).

Getting around San Sebastián
San Sebastián is compact enough that getting about — especially from
beach to beach — makes walking or renting a bicycle attractive options.
The cycle lane lining the Paseo de la Concha is very popular, and you can
now cycle the entire 8km (5-mile) coastline of the city. Pick up a bike (or
scooter) at Bici Rent Donosti, Paseo de la Zurriola 22 (% 943-29-08-54),

and stop by the CAT Turismo office for “Pedalea por la Ciudad,” a
brochure with biking itineraries.
A car is a good way to explore the surrounding Basque countryside.
Rental-car agencies, at the airport and in town, include
 Avis: Triunfo 2 (% 943-46-15-27)
 Europcar: Estación de RENFE (% 943-32-23-04)
 Hertz: Centro Comercial Garbera, Travesia de Garbera 1 (% 943-
66-86-26)
Frequent buses are available to other major cities in the region (see
“Getting there,” earlier in this chapter); bus service also runs to
Fuenterrabia (% 943-64-13-02), Guernica (% 94-454-05-44), and many
other small towns in the Basque Country, as do Eusko Tren trains
(% 902-54-32-10). Buses depart from Plaza Pío II.
If you need to hail a cab, try either Radio-Taxi Donosti (% 943-46-46-46)
or Tele-Taxi Vallina (% 943-40-40-40).
Spending the night
An extremely popular summer destination, San Sebastián has plenty of
hotels for its small size (but that doesn’t mean they don’t fill up in high
season). Most hotels are located near Playa de la Concha, in the Centro,
or New City, convenient to almost everything in San Sebastián (includ-
ing the Parte Vieja, or Old Quarter). New City is probably the most
desirable area in which to stay. Ondarreta is also near the Playa de la
Concha, but not close to the Parte Vieja and the main shopping and

San Sabastián’s pensiones
Especially in summer, San Sebastián can get very crowded with Spanish and French
tourists seeking cooler climes. If the hotels listed in this section are full, check out any
of the following good-value pensiones (guesthouses or inns): Pensión Aldamar,
Aldamar 2 (% 943-43-01-43; www.pensionaldamar.com), a clean and bright inn
that opened in 2000; Hotel Parma, Paseo Salamanca 10 (% 943-42-88-93; www.
hotelparma.com), a comfortable small inn near the Kursaal and Zurriola beach; or
Pensíon Kursaal (% 943-43-01-43; www.pensionesconencanto.com), a ten-
room inn with good installations and services, also very near the Kursaal Center and
Zurriola beach. Larger hotels that may have rooms available include Hotel Europa,
San Martín 52 (% 943-47-08-80; www.hotel-europa.com), a very nice, midsize
hotel with classic style in central San Sebastián, near La Concha beach; Costa Vasca,
Av. Pío Barroja 15 (% 943-31-79-50; www.aranzazu-hoteles.com), in the Antiquo
neighborhood near the Parque de Miramar; or NH Aranzazu, Av. Vitoria-Gasteiz 1

restaurant districts; you’d likely need to take cabs or buses to get back
and forth. Gros is just across the Río Urumea from the Centro and Parte
Vieja, near less-crowded Zurriola beach; this residential neighborhood
has a number of stately apartment buildings and many pintxos bars.
If you can, avoid San Sebastián in July and August, when hotels fill to
capacity and charge special supplements (if you do come during this
time, make reservations far in advance).

Ondarreta (beachfront)
With just eight rooms in a quiet residential neighborhood, a stay here is
like crashing at a friend’s house — if you had a friend lucky enough to live
in a chalet a short walk from San Sebastián’s perfect beach. Rooms are
simple but charming and very comfortable, and the restaurant of the same
name is an excellent value (it takes precedence, in fact; the rooms are
merely a bonus). Breakfast, however, is not served here. (So make do with
a croissant on the street, head to the beach, and then come back for a
shower and lunch.) It’s so comfortable that you may want to stick around
for dinner, too (see the listing in the “Dining in San Sebastián” section later
in the chapter).

Playa de La Concha
The name of this emblematic 19th-century hotel (translated as “Hotel of

simply as the Hotel Londres, it has one of San Sebastián’s best locations:
It faces the bay and La Concha beach, and is a short walk from the Old
Quarter. The hotel was recently remodeled, and guest rooms are tasteful,
formal, and spacious, with modern marble bathrooms. Rooms with gor-
geous views of the bay cost more but are worth it in a place as pretty as
San Sebastián.

New City
The city’s most famous hotel, this is your place of refuge if you want to
live like a queen or a pampered film star. The María Cristina now hosts all
the A-list stars during the San Sebastián Film Festival in September, but
the Belle Epoque hotel has been the choice of aristocrats and the merely
wealthy and famous — such as Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, and Johnny
Depp — since its opening in 1912. Named for the queen who ruled Spain
during the Spanish-American War, the hotel is grand and graceful, with
opulent halls and lavish rooms, but to some it may feel overly formal or
even snooty in a town as unfussy as San Sebastián. A Starwood property,
it’s perched on the banks of the River Urumea, but not right on the bay, as
some of the other hotels are.

Playa de La Concha
The Niza is the perfect small hotel for San Sebastián. It’s intimate, family-
run (owned by relatives of the great Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida),
and absolutely charming. A hotel since the 1920s, it’s right in the middle
of La Concha beach, with incomparable views of the entire bay and open-
ing up onto the promenade. The hotel is warmly decorated, with antiques,
bright modern colors, and a cool old elevator. Some rooms are a little
cramped, but the whole place is so comfortable and charming, not to men-
tion well located, that I prefer it to several of the fancier hotels in town.
Try to snag a room with a sea view (make reservations as far in advance
as possible). Breakfast is served in a cafe right on the promenade, part of
a cute pizzeria run by the hotel.

The most exciting thing to hit the San Sebastián hotel scene, and one of

and only a mile from Playa de la Zurriola and, in the opposite direction,
the famed Arzak restaurant. Swank and elegant but unpretentious, the inn

occupies a late-19th-century villa, declared a Historical Heritage building
in San Sebastián. Accommodations are warm, sedate, and sophisticated,
with plush fabrics and handsome furnishings. The majority of the 25 rooms
are located in the main house with several more in the carriage house.
Breakfast is served outdoors on the terrace in nice weather, and you can
relax at a bar or in two elegant sitting rooms downstairs. Villa Soro has
many of the services and attention to detail of a much larger hotel, but it’s
notably quieter and more discreet. And for the style and comfort it offers,
it’s a relative bargain. Check online for special package deals.

Dining in San Sebastián: An unrivaled 
restaurant scene
Basques, other Spaniards say, live to eat. And San Sebastián is the pinna-
cle of that culinary universe, the home of nueva cocina vasca (nouvelle
Basque cuisine). San Sebastián has as many top-rated restaurants as
Madrid and Barcelona, although both dwarf this coastal city in size; in
fact, San Sebastián is said to have more Michelin stars (representing the
most prestigious restaurant ratings in the world) per square meter than
any other city. With chef’s tasting menus and pintxos bars everywhere
you look, clearly, this is one city to indulge your appetite and inflate
your budget (but hopefully not your waistline!). For more on the art
eating of pintxos, see the “The art and ritual of the pintxo” and “On the
poteo: San Sebastián’s pintxos bars,” in this chapter.
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 237
Eating and drinking like a Basque
You don’t have to look hard for local specialties, including: bacalao al pil-pil (salt cod
in garlic and red pepper sauce), marmitako (tuna and potato stew), besugo (sea
bream), bacalao a la viscaína (stewed salt cod in fresh tomatoes), angulas (baby eels
in garlic), kokotxas (hake cheeks — Basques swear they’re a delicacy — in green
sauce), and txangurro (stuffed spider crab).
In other parts of Spain, a tapas crawl is called a tapeo. In the Basque Country, where
tapas are more commonly called pintxos, the crawl goes by another name: poteo (poh-
teh-oh). Whatever you call it, it’s a great (and relatively inexpensive) way to assemble
a delicious meal while you barhop at the same time. See “On the poteo: San
Sebastián’s pintxos bars,” later in this chapter, for some tasty recommendations.
The drink of choice up north is txakolí (cha-koh-lee), a young white wine produced
only in the Basque Country and typically poured with dazzling dexterity from high above
the barman’s head. Txakolí goes especially well with pintxos. If this fizzy wine doesn’t
do it for you, choose from among many excellent Rioja and Ribera del Duero red and
white wines. Sidra, or low-alcohol cider, is also popular with the locals.

Nothing demonstrates what food nuts the locals are more than the pri-
vate, all-male gastronomic societies that flourish in this small city. Born
in San Sebastián in the 19th century, these societies (called txokos)
number more than 100 today. They still revel in the culinary creativity 
of the coast, still eat to their hearts’ contents, and, alas, still exclude
women except for special occasions.
Eating in San Sebastián is considerably more expensive than anywhere
else in Spain, but what can I say? It’s absolutely worth it. Dining in the
Basque Country can rightly be considered a highlight of a trip to Spain;
I’ve had a couple of the finest meals of my life in San Sebastián.

Monte Igueldo (outskirts of San Sebastián)
BASQUE
In a chalet perched on Igueldo Hill overlooking the Bay of La Concha and
the Cantabrian Sea, this classic restaurant has sweeping views every bit as
spectacular as its menu. By most accounts, chef-owner Pedro Subijana is
considered one of the leading lights of Basque cooking, along with his rival
Arzak (see the following review). Whether you opt for such classic dishes
as sea bass with green peppers or more innovative preparations, such as
puff pastries stuffed with anchovies, you’re sure to find the experience
memorable. The in-house pastries are delectable. One of Subijana’s sea-
sonal tasting menus is definitely the way to go, though it’s certainly not
cheap and is quite a bit of food. The restaurant is about 8km (5 miles) west
of San Sebastián, in Barrio de Igueldo on Monte Igueldo.

Arzak
$$$$$
Outskirts of Gros
BASQUE
Juan Mari Arzak — one of the originators of nueva cocina vasca — is an
artist as well as San Sebastián’s diplomat in a chef’s coat. His restaurant,
one of the finest in Spain (and one of the best in Europe), is housed in a
simple-looking cottage (built by his grandparents in 1897) in the Gros
neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of town. It has earned the praises
of presidents and queens and the recognition of numerous “Restaurant of
the Year” awards in Spain. It is, simply, exquisite in every detail — and
though the dining room is quite elegant, decorated in warm yellow tones,
it’s far from an affair. Diners delight in the experience, and a jovial Arzak
comes out and circles the room like everyone’s best friend. With the clas-
sic dishes on the menu to the creative flourishes Arzak and his daughter,
Elena, continually come up with, this is the one place to go if you’re going
to have only one meal to sample the best of Basque cooking. From puding
de krabarroka (rockfish terrine) to roasted gamecock and wild boar, choos-
ing among the mouth-watering appetizers and entrees is so difficult that

the fixed-price tasting menu may be the only way to go. Make reservations

Parte Vieja (Old Quarter)
BASQUE
Run by one of the celebrated new generation of Basque chefs called the
“Berasategui boys” (also see Martín Berasategui’s eponymous restaurant
in this section, as well as his restaurant at the Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao), this charming restaurant features excellent fixed-price menus. It’s
easily one of the best bargains in San Sebastián. The menu changes daily
and always has a healthy number of mouth-watering choices. You can start
with artichokes with clams and follow it up with bacalao de la Isla de Feroe
con pimientos (salt cod, which the restaurant claims is the “Rolls Royce of
cod,” in red peppers). For dessert, how about tarteleta de chocolate con

On the poteo: San Sebastián’s pintxos bars
The Parte Vieja, or Old Quarter, near the waterfront positively swims with appetizing
little taverns, each offering bar counters full of the best little meals on a toothpick
you’ve ever seen. Calling these objets d’art mere snacks is hardly fair; they beat the
pants off cocktail weenies. You can easily construct a fun and varied meal picking off
pintxos and washing them down with wine or beer, moving from bar to bar like locals
on a poteo, or pintxos crawl. Among the top pintxos spots in the Parte Vieja are
Ganbara, San Jerónimo 21, a small space with an L-shaped bar loaded with a great
variety of artistic pintxos, including mini croissants stuffed with cod and terrific txan-
gurro (crab), which you’ll have to ask for rather than just grab off the bar; Bar Martínez,
31 de Agosto 13, which has specialized in cold pintxos for six decades; Bar Txepetxa,
Pescadería 5, a rustic spot where the specialty is anchovy (antxoa) combination pin-
txos; La Cuchara de San Telmo, 31 de Agosto 28 (around back, near San Telmo church),
which has tables outside and a chalkboard full of modern, avant-garde pintxos, such
as risotto de aueso Idiazabal and roast-pork canellones; and La Viña, 31 de Agosto 3,
known for its grilled squid.
The residential neighborhood of Gros, near Playa de Zurriola, is fast becoming a
mandatory stop on the San Sebastián pintxos route. Worth seeking out are Bergara,
General Artetxe 8, known for its cod and duck pintxos; Aloña Berri, Bermingham 24,
offering hot pintxos such as oyster gratin; Restaurante Kursaal, Zurriola 1, on the
ground floor of the Kursaal Center and the work of famed chef Martín Berasategui;
and Patio de Ramuntxu, Peã y Goñi 10, a recent pintxos contest champion and origi-
nator of creative dishes such as crispy chicken with caramelized apple.
Note that many pintxos bars are closed Sunday or Monday, or both.

Ondarreta
BASQUE
Quickly becoming a fashionable dining spot for hip Basques, this modern
and even funky restaurant, with a lively cafeteria and bar downstairs, has
one of the most privileged locations in San Sebastián. Its second-story
floor-to-ceiling windows frame panoramic views of the bay from the base
of Monte Igueldo, just steps from Eduardo Chillida’s famed Peine del Viento
sculpture. The bright and colorful décor is as much nightclub as restau-
rant, but the kitchen turns out excellent Basque dishes, including a host
of daily specials using very fresh local vegetables and seafood.

Chomin

Ondarreta
BASQUE
Some top Basque restaurants threaten to burst your vacation budget. Not
Chomin. Prices at this comfortable, friendly restaurant on the first floor of
a private chalet are extremely reasonable given the quality of the cooking
and service. Near Ondarreta Beach in a quiet neighborhood, Chomin is
worth seeking out, especially for the midday lunch deal, a real bargain.
The brocheta de rape y langostinos (kebab of monkfish and prawns) and
steak tartare are especially savory. A standard, the merluza Chomin (white
fish with clams) amounts to comfort food for spoiled locals.

Lasarte-Oria (outskirts of San Sebastián)

This restaurant bears the name of one of the new generation’s star chefs,
carrying on and updating the traditions of nueva cocina vasca. His epony-
mous eatery sits in a modern caserío (country house) just outside San
Sebastián on the way to Fuenterrabia. Berasategui, who ranks as one of
the Basque Country’s most innovative chefs, has amassed a number of

ence, order the nine-course tasting menu — a meal that will make the
highlight reel of your trip to Spain.

Rekondo
$$$
Above San Sebastián
BASQUE
Just up the hill from San Sebastián proper, beyond the Miramar Palace,
Rekondo is the kind of place that draws everyday diners and families and
couples celebrating special occasions. It’s a longtime, family-run favorite
in San Sebastián, around since 1964, and is an oenophile’s dream. The
menu is brief and focuses on the Basque basics: squid in their own ink,
lamb chops, and fish dishes of turbot and sea bream. The kitchen’s great,
but many savvy diners here are committed wine lovers who come for one
of Spain’s best wine cellars. It boasts more than 100,000 bottles, including
some very rare vintages. It’s the kind of place where you can blow a big
wad of cash on a special Gran Reserva wine from your birthday year.

Classically decorated, with dark wood and flowered wallpaper, this hand-
some, intimate restaurant serves some of the best food in San Sebastián.
It’s great for such classic dishes as grilled sea bass in tomato vinaigrette
or roasted venison, but Urepel’s team of chefs continues to introduce new,
innovative fare. Though a little formal looking, the restaurant draws a
diverse crowd — from seniors to hipsters. Its prices are reasonable, at
least for the five-star crowd.

Exploring San Sebastián
San Sebastián is a great walking city, but the city recently introduced a
tour bus, Donosti Tour (Bus Turístico). It offers 23 stops throughout the
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 241

city and allows passengers to get on and off an unlimited number of
times during a single day. The route begins twice daily, Tuesday through
Sunday, at noon and 2 p.m. The entire route takes just under two hours,
and tickets are 12€ ($15) for adults, 10€ ($12) for seniors and students,
and 6€ ($7.50) for children. The bus leaves from Teatro Victoria Eugenia,
Calle Reina Regente, across from CAT (Centro de Atracción y Turismo,
the main Tourism Information Office), though you can purchase tickets
on board at any of the stops. For more information, call % 696-28-80-27
or visit www.busturistikoa.com.
For gorgeous perspectives of San Sebastián, drive or take the funicular
(cable car) up to the top of Monte Igueldo (the hill on the left as you face
the bay). The funicular leaves from Plaza del Funicular 4 (% 943-21-05-
64). It runs from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer, and from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
in winter. You can visit a small theme park (with a turn-of-the-20th-
century roller coaster) and a rather bland hotel, but the main draw is
the spectacular view of the town and its perfect shell-shaped beach,
promenade, leafy avenues, and Belle Epoque buildings. Early evening,
when the city lights begin to sparkle, is the best time to take the trip. If
you’re driving, you may want to consider eating at top-rated Akelarre,
farther along the coast. (For a review, see “Dining in San Sebastián: An
unrivaled restaurant scene,” earlier in this chapter.)
The former summer palace of the royal family, Palacio Miramar, and its
grounds and gardens, sit on a small hill above the two main beaches. It’s
a lovely, relaxing spot with pretty views. A leisurely stroll, including a
funicular ride, may take two to three hours.

The cider house rules
After you have your fill of fancy Basque restaurants, you may need something a little
down-n-dirty to bring you back to earth. Soaring in popularity are rustic sidrerías (see-
dreh-ree-ahs), or cider houses, on the slopes of the hills overlooking San Sebastián.
From mid-January to the end of March, you can grab a simple meal and as many
glasses of fresh, low-alcohol cider as you can drink, served directly from the spigots
of giant oak vats. You sit at long wooden picnic tables; the simple fare — a codfish
omelet, beef, or bacalao (salt cod) with green pepper — is brought out on metal trays
and is accompanied by enormous baguettes. The cider is the real star, though its
slightly sour taste may not be for everyone. In truth, the meal is mainly an excuse to
have something to do between trips back to the vat room to fill up your glass. If it’s
really crowded, the owner may come around, authorizing tables one at a time to rise
and ritualistically collect their cider. Contact the Tourism Office, Calle Reina Regente
8 (% 943-48-11-66) for a list of open sidrerías. If you’re not in town during the height
of sidra season, don’t worry; you can always get a bottle of sidra at pintxos bars and
informal restaurants in the city.

Strolling the Promenade
As much as the Basques of San Sebastián love to eat, it’s not surprising
that people are always out walking. The Paseo de la Concha Promenade
(also known as Paseo Nuevo) is one of the most inviting places for a
stroll that you’re likely to set foot upon. It gracefully bends along the
length of La Concha beach, with great views at every step.
In the middle of the shell-shaped Playa de la Concha is the Royal Bathing
Hut and former “Pearl of the Ocean” spa (today the La Perla Spa). At
some point in your stroll, you’ll probably be tempted to take the steps
down to the beach and kick off your shoes. People are out at all hours,
but particularly before and after mealtimes. An intricate white-iron rail-
ing and turn-of-the-20th-century apartment buildings line the walkway.
As you near the Parte Vieja, you come upon the gorgeous Ayuntamiento
(City Hall) — the former casino during the city’s Belle Epoque heyday —
and a plaza with an old-time carousel and lovely gardens dominated by
tamarind trees.
Another tempting place to stroll is the Zona Romántica, or “Romantic 
San Sebastián,” along the left bank of the River Urumea, which stretches
from the Old Quarter to the neighborhood of Amara. Begin at the Kursaal
Bridge, across from the very distinctly modern Kursaal Congress Palace,
and pass the grand, Victorian-looking María Cristina Hotel and Victoria
Eugenia Theater. Farther down the river are Santa Catalina Bridge, the
oldest in the city, and the ornate María Cristina Bridge, dominated by four
sculpted obelisks.
At the western extreme of the Bahía de la Concha — the base of Monte
Igueldo and the end of Ondarreta Beach — is a small plaza and one of
native son Eduardo Chillida’s most famous and evocative sculptures,
Peine del Viento (The Wind Comb). Three rust-colored iron pieces jut
out of the rock, just above the crashing surf of the Cantabrian Sea, and
appear to sift the winds that come ripping in off the ocean. Chillida
claimed that the pieces represented past, present, and future. It’s a
daring and suggestive work — and a beautiful spot at the edge of the
sea. From Ondarreta beach, it’s just about a ten-minute walk out to the
Chillida sculpture, past the tennis club. Allow a couple of hours for
strolling.
Basking at the beaches
Beach-loving Spaniards from the sultry center and south of the country
flock to San Sebastián in summer. The city has three beaches right in the
middle of the city: La Concha, Ondarreta, and La Zurriola. La Concha,
one of the most splendid urban beaches in Europe, became famous in the
mid-19th century when Queen Isabel made pilgrimages there for skin
treatments. Ondarreta, at the foot of Monte Igueldo, features aristocratic
villas and gardens overlooking sunbathers. In the mid-’90s, San Sebastián
inaugurated a new beach, La Zurriola, on the right of the Urumea River
(near the striking Palacio de Congresos Kursaal); locals looking to escape
the crowds on the two better-known beaches favor La Zurriola.
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 243

During summer, if the beaches get too crowded (or the number of bare
breasts on display becomes overwhelming), you can hop a boat out to the
city’s fourth beach, on Santa Clara Island in the middle of the bay. It’s less
crowded and more family-oriented. Inquire along the beach or at the cen-
tral tourism office for information about ticket prices and times for boats
traveling to the island (it’s all very informal, with no set schedules).
Prowling the Parte Vieja
Around the curve of the bay, just before Monte Ugull, is the Parte Vieja
(Old Quarter), where San Sebastián was born. It’s a handsome tangle of
small streets and fishermen’s houses that really comes alive in the after-
noon and evening when people flood the pintxos bars. (Don’t miss per-
forming your own pintxo crawl, or poteo.) The heart of the Old Quarter is
Plaza de la Constitución, a handsome yellow-and-white arcaded square
affectionately called “La Consti.” The other important old town site is
the handsome Museo de San Telmo, Plaza Zuloaga 1 (% 943-42-49-70;
www.museosantelmo.com). Admission is free and it’s open Tuesday
through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 4 to 7:30 p.m.; and
Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. A museum of Basque culture, it’s
housed in a 16th-century Dominican convent with beautiful Renaissance
cloisters. It features European and Basque art from the 15th to 19th cen-
turies (including works by El Greco, Van Dyck, and Rubens), and occa-
sionally presents very challenging modern art exhibitions on the first
floor, where the dialog between convent and collection is often fascinat-
ing. Perhaps most notable, however, are the spectacular canvas panels
by the Catalan artist José María Sert that decorate the interior of the
church. The canvases depict episodes in Basque history.
San Sebastián dates back to the Middle Ages, but over time much of the
city has been destroyed by 12 major fires. You can peek around the Old
Quarter in less than an hour, unless you get hungry and duck in a few
pintxos bars.
Chillida Sculpture Museum
Hernani
Eduardo Chillida, born in San Sebastián in 1924, was one of the world’s
great modern sculptors and arguably Spain’s foremost contemporary
artist of the late 20th century. In 1998, he received the International
Sculpture Center’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Chillida and his family
saw the inauguration of a private sculpture museum dedicated to his work,
the Museo Chillida-Leku, come to fruition only a couple of years before
the artist’s death in August 2002. Zabalaga, a 16th-century caserío (farm-
house) that Chillida restored (and which he considered the largest sculp-
ture on the grounds), is a magnificent showcase — as are the bucolic acres
of wooded grounds — for his often monumental, abstract sculptures in
stone and iron. Inside the house are several smaller pieces, including early
works, and the artist’s famous works on paper, called Gravitations.
Although the museum only presents works from the last decade or so of
Part III: Northern Spain 
244

the Chillida’s career, it’s a superb introduction to a giant among modern
artists. Allow a couple of hours, including transportation (the farmhouse
is in the suburbs of San Sebastián, about a 20-minute drive from down-
town). Before or after visiting the museum, be sure to check out Chillida’s
El Peine del Viento, a large iron work cleaved into the rock of Monte Igueldo
at the edge of the Bahía de la Concha.
See map p. 233. Cacería Zabalaga, Barrio Jauregi 66, Hernani (% 943-33-60-06;

San Sebastián; the bus stop is just after the Campsa gas station after the turnoff from
the highway. Inquire at the Tourism Office, Reina Regente 8 (% 943-48-11-66 or
943-27-12-79), for additional transportation information. Admission: 8€ ($10) adults,
6€ ($7.50) students and seniors; 75-minute guided visits in Spanish and English 5€
($6.25); audioguides 3.50€ ($4.40). Open: Sept–June Mon–Sat 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m.;
July–Aug Mon–Sat 10:30 a.m.–8 p.m.; Sun year-round 10:30 a.m.–3 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
After hitting the beaches and seeing the Old Quarter, parents may want
to acknowledge San Sebastián’s long history as a resort and go to a
relaxing spa, while kids may want to visit the aquarium. Fans of modern
architecture will want to have a look at the striking Kursaal building by
one of Spain’s most famous architects.
Relaxing at a spa
If you’re the type who comes back from vacation needing a vacation,
then La Perla, one of Spain’s coolest spas, is a must-visit. La Perla’s
ample facilities, including the soothing water-therapy circuit, sit smack
in the middle of the Paseo de la Concha area. Try the amazingly restora-
tive treatments and the series of pool stations that isolate parts of your
tired body against water jets; relax on waterbeds or beneath waterfalls;
and massage your aching feet in thick-grained, sand-bottom pools. The
direct beach access means you can dart out for a swim in the bay and
come back for more therapy. Day visits are welcomed (and if you just
can’t tear yourself away, La Perla also has a gym and cafe-restaurant
overlooking the bay). Single visits range from 19€ ($23) for a one-and-
three-quarter-hour session to 24€ ($30) for a three-hour session — a
real deal. The spa is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; reservations for
spa treatments beyond the water-therapy pools are essential. The Perla
Café-Restaurant overlooking the bay is also a good stop for lunch 
(% 943-45-88-56; www.la-perla.net). See the “San Sebastián” map,
earlier in this chapter, for more information.
Getting a fish-eye view
San Sebastián’s recently revamped Aquarium, with an underwater walk-
way that provides a 360-degree view of marine life swimming around
you, is a good spot for kids. It’s not the biggest or best aquarium you’ll
ever see, but I’d give kids at least an hour here. It’s in the port, near 
the Parte Vieja, Paseo del Muelle 34/Plaza Carlos Blasco de Imaz, s/n 
(% 943-44-00-99; www.aquariumss.com). It’s open mid-September
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 245

through mid-June, Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; July and August daily from
10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission for adults is 10€ ($12), for seniors and stu-
dents 8€ ($10), for children ages 3 to 11 it’s 6€ ($7.50), and children
under 3 enter for free.
Giving kudos to Los Cubos
Those attention-getting angled white boxes on the Zurriola Beach and the
banks of the Urumea River constitute the Palacio de Congresos Kursaal,
San Sebastián’s convention center and auditorium. Affectionately, or per-
haps quizzically, known to locals as Los Cubos (The Cubes), the building
is the work of the renowned prizewinning Navarran architect Rafael
Moneo. When illuminated from within, the building looks like a glowing
spaceship. Home to concerts, conferences, and the San Sebastián Film
Festival, it has aroused such interest that it offers free guided tours on
weekdays at 1:30 p.m and at noon and 1:30 p.m. on weekends. Call % 943-
00-30-00 for more information. The Kursaal is a great place to drop in for
lunch: The restaurant and cafeteria in the building are the work of the
renowned Basque chef Martín Berasategui.
Shopping for local treasures
As a destination for summering Spaniards and across-the-border week-
enders, San Sebastián has plenty of chic shops all along the bay and
throughout the new city. The most stylish shops are located along the
Alameda del Boulevard, which divides the Parte Vieja from the Centro,
and the elegant streets that lead south from there, to Avenida de la
Libertad, another main shopping drag. A shopping mall with lots of
clothing and jewelry boutiques is located on Alameda del Boulevard,
just down the street from the CAT Tourism Information Office at Reina
Regente 3, and another concentration of clothing and foodstuffs shops is
gathered at the ground floor of the Kursaal Palacio de Congresos on
Avenida de la Zurriola. Yet your best bet may be to pick up something
authentically Basque, like the classic berets worn by older men. Pick up
a boina (beret) at Casa Ponsol, the oldest hat shop in San Sebastián,
founded in 1838. It’s at the corner of Narrica and Plaza de Sarriegui (no
phone). For a good selection of coffee-table books and tomes on Spanish
and Basque cooking, visit Hontza, at Okendo Kalea 4 (% 943-42-82-89).
San Sebastián’s nightlife
Hands down the best evening activity in San Sebastián is joining the
rowdy, famished natives on a poteo (tapas crawl) in the Parte Vieja. Locals
say that San Sebastián’s Parte Vieja holds the world record for most bars
per square meter. (It’s a wonder no U.S. party schools offer study-abroad
programs in San Sebastián.) Most are clustered in the small streets around
Plaza de la Constitución; see “On the Poteo: San Sebastián’s pintxos bars,”
earlier in this chapter, for names and addresses of some of the best pin-
txos bars. More traditional bars include Pub Wimbledon, Paseo Eduardo
Chilida 9 (% 943-31-41-18), near the Chillida sculpture Peine del Viento, at
Part III: Northern Spain 
246

the end of Ondarreta beach, an English pub next to (what else?) a tennis
club; Museo del Whisky, Boulevard 5 (% 943-42-64-78), a piano bar with a
large selection of whiskey. There’s live jazz on Thursday nights at the sub-
terranean Altxerri Jazz Bar, Reina Regente 2 (% 943-42-29-31), and at
Branka Jazz, Paseo Eduardo Chillida 13 (% 943-31-70-96), on the ground
floor of the restaurant Branka. Be Bop Bar, Paseo de Salamanca 3 (% 943-
42-98-69), has weekly DJ sessions on Sunday nights. Starting to feel like all
you do in Spain (and especially in San Sebastián) is eat, eat, eat? You can
lose a couple pounds sweating it out at a disco — check out Discoteca La
Kabutzia, on Paseo Muelle, s/n (% 943-42-97-85), a sleek disco housed in
an old ship in the Parte Vieja by the harbor— or just watch your wallet get
thinner at the Casino Kursaal, Mayor 1 (at the corner of Alameda del
Boulevard, at the edge of the Parte Vieja; % 943-42-92-14), or Casino de
San Sebastián, in the swank Hotel de Londres y Inglaterra, Zubieta 2 
(% 943-42-92-15), which has been around since the turn of the 20th 
century.
Taking side trips from San Sebastián
In addition to the trips in this section, see the section “La Rioja Alavesa:

Pasajes de San Juan
Visiting this fishing village (called Pasaia Donibane in Euskera) doesn’t
actually get you too far out of town — it’s only 10km (6 miles) from San
Sebastián. But it’s a very popular, charming spot to spend half a day and
eat lunch at one of the famous fish restaurants. From the neighboring

Lights, camera, actors!
Ever since the reign of Queen Isabel II, San Sebastián has courted royalty. Now it’s
royalty of a different sort that hits the Cantabrian coast. Although not as well known
as the film festivals held in Cannes, Berlin, or Venice, the annual San Sebastián
International Film Festival, held at the Kursaal Palacio de Congresos, is one of the
most important in Europe. Every September, the silver screen’s firmament descends on
this small Basque city — past guests have included Bette Davis, Johnny Depp, and
Martin Scorsese. If you’re here in mid-September, join the paparazzi party at the María
Cristina Hotel.

village of Pasajes de San Pedro you can walk or take a little blue boat
across the harbor to the town. Pasajes de San Juan is a pretty (if touristy
in summer) collection of balconied houses along one main street —
where Victor Hugo lived in the mid-1800s. Two family seafood restau-
rants worth checking out are Casa Cámara, San Juan 7 (% 943-52-36-
99), a historic place where the lobster and crab pots are hoisted up
through the floor of the dining room, and Txulotxo, San Juan 82 (% 943-
52-39-52), an attractive stone restaurant overlooking the harbor.
To get there, take a Herribus (% 943-49-18-01) bus marked “Pasaje de
San Pedro” or “Pasaia Donibane” from Plaza Pío II in San Sebastián;
although, given the short distance, a taxi would be preferable. Even if
you have a car, travel by bus or taxi because the area is a bottleneck
waiting to fill up.
Fuenterrabia
About 24km (15 miles) along the coast on the way to France — through
spectacular mountain countryside — is this historic and pretty seaside
resort and fishing port (called Hondarribia in Basque). The town,
extremely popular in summer, has thick medieval walls, stone houses
with coats of arms and colorful balconies, and a tenth-century castle
that today is a parador. It also has a nice, long beach and marina.
Interbus buses (% 943-64-13-02) frequently depart Plaza Pío II in San
Sebastián for Funeterrabia.
If you want to stay overnight, the elegant Parador de Hondarribia Carlos
V is one of the very best of the parador bunch, on the small, pretty Plaza
de Armas 14 (% 943-64-55-00; www.parador.es; Rack rates: 190€/$238
double). Occupying an imposing medieval castle with thick stone walls, it
has terrific rooms with period furnishings, a beautiful, plant-filled patio,
and a terrace with lovely sea views. Much smaller, but also in an attrac-
tive medieval structure, is Hotel Obispo, Plaza del Obispo (% 943-64-54-
00; www.hotelobispo.com; Rack rates: 96€–162€, or $120–$203, double).
A cool, atmospheric little restaurant is Sebastián, Mayor 9–11 (% 943-
64-01-67), and one of the fanciest places to dine is the excellent Ramón
Roteta, just outside the city at Irún, Villa Ainara (% 943-64-16-93).

Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 249
Pamplona: The Running of the Bulls
Pamplona is the principal city of the Spanish Pyrenees and the province
of Navarra — an ancient territory that shares borders with the Basque
Country, Aragón, and France. Pamplona once reigned as the fortified
capital of the independent kingdom of Navarra. But what seemingly
everybody knows about Pamplona today is that it’s the site of the leg-
endary Running of the Bulls, called the encierro (ehn-thyeh-roh), an
adrenaline rush of popular culture that dramatizes Spain’s up-close-and-
personal relationship with death. Ernest Hemingway wrote enthusiasti-
cally about the festival in The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926, and,
since then, people have flocked to the city every July.
The Festival of San Fermín (also called Sanfermines), during which the
daily encierros take place, is the kind of exhilarating experience that
stays with you (and you don’t have to actually hit the streets ahead of
the bulls to live it to the hilt). The oddest thing about one of Europe’s
great party scenes is that Pamplona, the rest of the year, is one of
Spain’s more conservative cities. Indeed, outside of the bedlam of
Sanfermines (held annually the second week in July), Pamplona hardly
ranks as one of Spain’s top attractions. When bulls aren’t in the streets,
it’s merely a pleasant northern city, with little to occupy most visitors
for more than a couple of days. And when the bulls are stampeding —
well, there’s no place to sleep. If you’re not here for the Running of the
Bulls, you probably only want to spend a day or two in Pamplona and
then head off to the countryside, or to the more interesting towns of the
neighboring Basque Country.

Getting there
Most people roll into Pamplona by road or rail from other parts in the
north, or perhaps from Madrid or Barcelona. You can also fly in, if you’re
only coming for the Sanfermines.
By air
Daily flights from Madrid and Barcelona (Iberia only) arrive at Aeropuerto
de Noáin, Centra Pamplona-Zaragoza, Km 6.5 (% 948-16-87-00), about
7km/3 miles from Pamplona. You have to take a taxi into town (about
10€/$12). A local bus does exist, but it goes to the town of Noáin, and 
it has no luggage compartments. You’re better off taking a cab.
By car
From San Sebastián, N-240 leads to Pamplona. Take the route through
San Sebastián or Vitoria (N-1) from Bilbao.
By bus
The Estación de Autobuses (the bus station) — a messy place guaranteed
to give you bus-fume headaches — is located at Av. Conde Oliveto 8, at
the corner of Yanguas and Miranda (% 948-22-38-54), just beyond the Old
Quarter. Buses arrive from most major cities, including Barcelona (Vibasa:
% 948-22-09-97), Madrid (Conda: % 948-22-10-26), San Sebastián, and
Bilbao, as well as from smaller towns in Navarra and the Basque Country.
By train
The RENFE train station is at Plaza de la Estación, s/n (at Avenida San
Jorge; % 948-13-02-02 or 902-240-202). Several trains a day steam in from
Madrid (four-and-a-half hours) and Barcelona (five-and-a-half hours), as
well as from San Sebastián and Bilbao.
Getting around Pamplona
The Old Quarter of Pamplona is so small that you don’t need more than
your feet to explore it. The heart of the Old City is Plaza Castillo, also
the hub of Sanfermines when bulls aren’t running through the streets or
dodging matadors in the bullring. Calle Estafeta is the main street, well
known to the hundreds who run in the encierros each year. It leads right
to the Plaza de Toros, or bullring (well known to the bulls). Parks bound
the Old Quarter: Parque de la Media Luna to one side and Parque de La
Ciudadela and Parque de La Taconera to the other.
You’ll probably only need to call a taxi to get to the bus station or air-
port. Two cab services are Teletaxi San Fermín (% 948-23-23-00) or
Radio Taxi (% 948-22-12-12). For information on traveling around
Navarra and to La Rioja, see “Taking side trips from Pamplona,” later 
in this chapter.

Spending the night
Pamplona has only a tiny fistful of decent hotels, a couple of which have
historically been associated with the encierros. The following list (with the
exception of the runner-up choices that may have beds during San
Fermín; see “No bull: No room at the inn,” in this chapter) describes
hotels all within or very near the old center of the city. The high rate listed
is always the special festival rate (often triple or more the regular rack
rate). Pamplona has a centralized number for hotel reservations; call
% 948-20-65-41 (Fax: 948-20-70-32; central.reservas@navarra.es).
Hotel Europa
$$$
Old Quarter
A small, charming, family-owned hotel — originally built as a private house
in the 1930s and now going on five decades as an inn — the Europa has a
great location and real intimacy. Twenty-five nicely decorated rooms (in
soft pinks and purples) are tucked away upstairs, past the excellent restau-
rant (even the owners consider their operation a restaurant with rooms
on the side). Several rooms overlook Calle Estafeta, which the bulls rumble
down during the encierros. If one could only get a reservation during the
festival. (The truth is you can’t. Don’t even bother trying.)

Weekend rates: 69€ ($86) double. During San Fermín: 270€ ($338). AE, MC, V.
Hotel Leyre
$$$
Old Quarter
A good-looking, midsize option not far from the Plaza de Toros (where the
bulls end up after their dash through town), the Leyre is extremely com-
fortable. Carefully renovated in the mid-1990s, the 55 warm and large rooms
have hardwood floors and colorful headboards and curtains. The hotel is
associated with two of the better restaurants in town, Europa and Alhambra,
and offers a deal at the former for guests. The hotel itself is also a deal.

Hotel Maisonnave
$$
Old Quarter
A large and stylish hotel on a nice street in the Old Quarter, near Plaza de
San Francisco, the Maisonnave is a fine place to crash during Sanfermines.
Completely renovated in the late ’90s, the 140 rooms are a bit small but
attractive, decorated in clean beige, white, and black tones. The hotel’s
calling card says it’s “very personal,” and for a large place, that’s not far
from the truth. It’s a good value all year, except for that brief and crazy
time in early July.

Iruña Palace Hotel Tres Reyes
$$$$
Parque de la Taconera (edge of Old Quarter)
Large and modern, the Tres Reyes (Three Kings) is a good choice for anyone
looking for convenience and comfort. It’s downtown Pamplona’s biggest and
finest hotel. The cement block exterior is a little less than charming; but
even if the place doesn’t drip with personality, it’s a fair value, especially on
weekends. Rooms are contemporary and tasteful, and the hotel has a nice
swimming pool (a plus for kids), a pretty garden, and an excellent gymna-
sium, as well as squash courts. It’s located just outside the Old Quarter, on
the edge of La Taconera Park, but within easy walking distance — an impor-
tant factor during the all-hours craziness of San Fermín.

($450–$594). AE, DC, MC, V.
La Perla
$$$
Old Quarter
For many decades, La Perla (The Pearl) has stood as an old-fashioned and
formerly grand hotel — a kind way to say that it’s a little dumpy — but it’s
still a classic. Finally getting a makeover, La Perla is scheduled to reopen
in July 2007. The oldest hotel in town, inaugurated in 1880 on Plaza del
Castillo, it overlooks Calle Estafeta. In its glory years it hosted Ernest
Hemingway (Room 217) and continues to draw legions of fans of the
annual encierros, dated and worn furnishings being part of the charm.

Nuevo Hotel Yoldi
$$$
Old Quarter
The Yoldi is a simple, quiet, and functional hotel that only comes to life
during the San Fermín Festival. Very near the Plaza de Toros, it hosts just
about all the best-known bullfighters in attendance for the corridas (bull-
fights). They stay here year after year (they’re a superstitious bunch) as
do their obsessed followers. The Yoldi ranks, along with La Perla, as the
San Fermín hotel. Don’t even dream of getting a booking during the party,
though; it’s booked four years in advance.

Dining in Pamplona
You can eat well in Pamplona; the haute cuisine of the nearby Basque
Country and more rustic dishes from the mountains of Navarra both
influence the fine dining.
During Sanfermines, always make dinner reservations so that you don’t
waste time in line or risk not getting into the restaurant of your choice.
Fortunately, lots of places are open around the clock. All the restaurants

No bull: No room at the inn
Pamplona’s Running of the Bulls is one of Spain’s greatest hits. But finding a hotel
during the festival is a real pain. You either have to make a reservation six months or
more in advance and dish up an absurd sum of money, or be carefree enough to try
your luck at scoring a pensión (guesthouse) when you arrive. A mediocre 70€ ($84)
hotel can easily set you back 300€ ($375) during Sanfermines. That’s if you’re lucky
enough to score a reservation. Some better-known hotels in Pamplona are sold out
three and four years in advance of the annual San Fermín festival, with rooms occu-
pied by perennial bull aficionados. Even for less popular spots, you need to make reser-
vations six months to a year in advance. Plenty of people just crash in the park, which
may be fine for inebriated college kids, but it’s akin to trying to sleep on the bathroom
floor at a frat house.
Visiting Pamplona during the Running of the Bulls is one of those situations that
demands you take a good, realistic look at your budget. If you’re dying to attend the
weeklong mayhem in July, and you don’t have a reservation or a pile of disposable
income, check with the Tourism Office for a list of some 50 pensiones, where prices
are probably double the 25€ to 50€ ($31–$63) they get the rest of the year. Locals look-
ing to make a buck also open up their homes, and you can score a spare bedroom for
a price that, compared to what hotels charge, is a bargain. Inquire at the tourist office
or look around town for signs posted.
If the hotels listed in “Staying in Pamplona,” above, are full, you can try these runners-
up (expect to pay top dollar during San Fermín; during the rest of the year rooms go for
only a fraction of the festival fare):
AC Ciudad de Pamplona, Iturrama 21 (% 948-26-60-11; www.ac-hoteles.com),
located in the modern section of town, is popular with business travelers to Pamplona.
Pensión Casa Otano, San Nicolás 5 (% 948-22-70-36; www.casaotano.com/
pension.htm), is a slightly chaotic family-run residencia (residence) on bar-lined
San Nicolás right in the Old Quarter of Pamplona. You have to pay for rooms in
advance. Don’t expect too much (or any) sleep during the festival. Three miles from
Pamplona is NH El Toro, Carretera de Guipúzcoa, Km 5 (% 948-30-22-11; www.nh-
hoteles.es), a reliable entry in the NH hotel chain. Tryp Burlada, Calle La Fuente,
Burlada (% 948-13-13-00; www.solmelia.com), has 53 functional rooms and is
located in Burlada, about 3km (2 miles) from Pamplona.

I recommend in this section are within walking distance of Plaza del
Castillo in the Old Quarter.
Alhambra
$$$–$$$$
Old Quarter
NAVARRESE/SPANISH
Pamplona is pretty far north for a restaurant named for the Moorish palace
in Granada, especially considering that the restaurant in question focuses
mainly on regional Navarrese and Basque dishes. No matter. Now owned
by the same local company that owns Hotel Leyre and Europa, Alhambra
has long been a Pamplona favorite. For an appetizer, try a warm salad of
foie gras and duck confit (duck cooked and preserved in its own fat). For
a main course, the risotto of mushrooms, truffles, and shrimp is a winner.
The various menús are good values.

Casa Otano
$$
Old Quarter
NAVARRESE/SPANISH
Going on its seventh decade, Casa Otano is the kind of good-value, unpre-
tentious restaurant that you may find yourself eating at several times
during a stay in Pamplona. On the second floor above an informal pensión,
along one of the city’s busiest bar streets, the dining room is surprisingly
large and attractive. It’s got just the right Spanish feel with exposed brick
walls and dark-wood beams. The local Navarrese dishes and grilled meats
aren’t surprising — just very well done for the reasonable prices. A stan-
dard is the merluza al cantábrico en salsa verde con almejas (Cantabrian

Eating and drinking like a Navarrese
Several of the dishes you find in the Basque Country are also stars of restaurants in
Pamplona. But in general the food in Navarra is simpler, with a greater emphasis on
game, lamb, and trout. Dishes to try include pimientos rellenos (spicy red pepper
stuffed with fish, meat, or shellfish); trucha a la Navarra (grilled or fried trout, stuffed
with cured ham); and cochifrito (lamb stew). When you’ve got the munchies, get your
hands on queso Roncal (cured sheep’s milk cheese) and chistorra (a local variety of
chorizo sausage).
Navarra’s wines may not be as well known as those from Ribera del Duero or La Rioja,
but the region makes some excellent reds as well as whites, and the local dry rosés
are among the best in Spain. Good Navarra wines to look for include Artazu, Chivite,
Ochoa, and Castillo de Monjardín. Navarra is very close to Rioja, however, and in fact
some Rioja wineries are actually in Navarra, so most good restaurants have a healthy
representation of Riojas on their wine lists.

Europa
$$$$
Old Quarter
SPANISH
This sophisticated restaurant is a stone’s throw from the bullring and Plaza
del Castillo. The place for perhaps Pamplona’s most elegant dining expe-
rience, Europa is classic with modern touches. It began as a private house
in the 1930s and has several small dining rooms. Also a small hotel, it has
21 rooms (see the Hotel Europa listing earlier in this chapter). The restau-
rant, though, is the undisputed star. It serves creative regional dishes, such
as grilled salmon in olive vinaigrette, roasted lamb with mint cuajada
(curd), and grilled monkfish with fresh peas and fried green asparagus.
Desserts are elaborate; note that several, such as the chocolate soufflé
with mint sauce, must be ordered at the beginning of your meal.

as a little fussy and stuffy, Josetxo is where families and dates come for
special celebrations. The formal dining room, which opened in 1955, is
everything you want in an Old World European restaurant with service to
match. As a Basque restaurant, the best dishes are from the sea — the
shellfish pastry and lobster salad are terrific, but don’t pass up the super
goose liver.

Exploring Pamplona
Whether you come to sprint with bulls snorting at your heels or to see
the historic city of Pamplona (with no one snorting anywhere in your
general vicinity), you want to stick to the Old Quarter. Modern Pamplona,
although flush with gardens, isn’t terribly attractive. For art aficionados,
the most exciting development in the city is the museum dedicated to the
sculptor Jorge Oteiza. You can easily see the small number of Pamplona’s
sights in a single day. Guided city tours are available by calling % 948-21-

The Encierro: Running of the bulls
Few international visitors to Pamplona’s Fiesta de San Fermín are likely
to know or care that Spain’s biggest street party is actually religious in
origin and dates to at least 1591. The experts who run ahead of the bulls
pray to Pamplona’s patron saint to keep them out of hooves’ way. For
most people, Sanfermines is eight days of mayhem highlighted by a daily
running of the bulls through the streets.
The party begins at noon on July 6 (and lasts through July 14), when 
a swarm of people dressed all in white, except for red sashes and ker-
chiefs, gathers at the Town Hall. With a cry of “Citizens of Pamplona:
Viva San Fermín!” a rocket explodes, and so does the city. Each day
begins (it’s tempting to say ends, because virtually no one goes to bed)
with the diana, a 6 a.m. marching of bands through the streets, and the 
8 a.m. encierro.
If you’re one of the smart ones, determined to watch the encierro from
the safety of the barricades along Calle Estafeta, you’ve got to get up
early (or do like everyone else and stay up all night). The crowd stakes
out their places at 6 a.m. for the 8 a.m. running.
People crowd balconies and climb the barricades that have been set up
along the route. Experts and foolish novices crowd the area near the
gates. The most daring actually run toward the gates just before the shot
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 257
The bull by the horns: To run or not to run?
Should you try to outrun annoyed, 1-ton animals rushing madly through the medieval
streets of Pamplona? Even if you’re the adventurous sort, this is a no-brainer — at
least to me. Every year a number of people get maimed while dashing through the
streets, and it’s usually the out-of-towners, often young and inebriated. Sure, fatal gor-
ings are rare (15 or 16 in the last 100 years), but one college student from Chicago was
killed in the mid-1990s. My advice for most people? Come, drink too much if you must,
but climb the barricade and get a good look at the madness from a safe distance.
The encierro is regarded as a male-only event (boys and bulls only). Women are still
thought of as the fairer, or perhaps slower, sex, and are prohibited from trying to outrun
the charging bulls. (Of course, most women are simply too smart to try to outrun bulls,
although a few disregard the rules and run anyway.)
You’ve probably heard people who’ve done it and say it’s a terrific rush. If you’re one
of those who will never be dissuaded, all I can say is suerte! (good luck!).
Here’s a tip for the brave souls who do run and survive: If a bull comes anywhere near
you, check the photography stores near the Plaza del Castillo. Photographers snap pics
to sell as souvenirs. You may just spot your harried self with a bull at your heels — proof
for those extreme tales of machismo you’ll no doubt spin back home.

rings out and the gates fly open, releasing the beasts. The mad rush
begins, runners inevitably stumble, and the six bulls hurtle over bodies
and cobblestones toward the unseen goal: the bullring. If a bull becomes
separated from the pack, he is apt to freak out and attempt to run down
anything that moves. Minutes later, a second pistol signals that all the
bulls have entered the Plaza de Toros. Everyone heads to the Plaza del
Castillo for breakfast and excited — and, no doubt, inflated! — tales of
near misses.
Late in the afternoon is the day’s bullfight, which draws some of Spain’s
top matadors. If you want to score some first-come, first-served tickets
to that afternoon’s bullfight, go directly to the ticket office at the Plaza
de Toros. Tickets go on sale at 6:30 a.m., but you need divine interven-
tion to get one. They sell out weeks and months in advance, mostly to
locals. Try asking your hotel concierge if she knows how to get a ticket,
but be prepared to pay the premium scalper’s rate.
The party cranks up again afterwards, with marching bands, sponta-
neous dancing, and parades of costumed figures — literal giants and big
heads. And the daily revelry begins anew. The pattern repeats each day
until the 14th, when the closing song is a lament: “Poor me, poor me,”
the Pamploneses sing, “San Fermín is finished.” See the “The bull by 
the horns: To run or not to run?”, as well as the official Web site, www.
sanfermin.net, for practical information on enjoying the festival.
The top attractions
If you’re in Pamplona not to see the Running of the Bulls, check out the
following activities and attractions to keep you busy.
Catedral and Museo Diocesano
Old Quarter
The Gothic cathedral, built in the 14th century on the foundations of a
former Romanesque church, is the single most important sight in Pamplona.
The squat interior houses a marble tomb of Charles III, the last great king of
Navarra, and his queen, Leonor. The delicate medieval cloisters, considered

258
Running of the nudes
Animal-rights activists and anyone against forcing bulls to run through the streets will
be pleased to find that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has organ-
ized an alternative to San Fermín. PETA folks do a human version of the run, in the
nude, with political messages painted across their bare chests. As a protest to both
San Fermín and bullfighting in Spain, it is at once expectedly confrontational and good-
natured (er, literally cheeky); as PETA says, their run is full of “babes, not bulls.” See
www.runningofthenudes.com for more information.

among the finest in Spain, feature an intricately carved door with scenes
from the Bible. A small museum (the Museo Catedrático y Diocesano) occu-
pies the former refectory and kitchen, and exhibits religious objects, includ-
ing a series of 13 virgins (er, that’s polychrome virgin sculptures). You can
conduct a decent visit in under an hour.

Museo de Navarra
Old Quarter
Pamplona’s other major sight in the Old Quarter, its excellent and well-
designed museum, occupies a 16th-century charity hospital. Of great inter-
est are the fourth- and fifth-century Roman mosaics, several in pristine
condition, and the Gothic and Romanesque pieces. Look for the unusual
French Gothic statue of the Virgin with child. The collection of paintings
includes Goya’s expressive portrait of the Marqués de San Adrián. Plan on
spending a couple of hours here.

Museo Oteiza
Alzuza (outskirts of Pamplona)
This new museum, dedicated to the career of the celebrated Basque
abstract sculptor Jorge Oteiza, was inaugurated in 2003 — just a month
after Oteiza’s death at the age of 95. The museum consists of some 1,600
sculptures, as well as drawings and collages, from the artist’s personal col-
lection. Oteiza was considered one of the most important Spanish sculp-
tors of the 20th century, and he was frequently at odds with the other great
Basque sculptor of even greater renown, Eduardo Chillida. The museum,
a starkly modern and large, earth-red concrete cube, incorporates what
was Oteiza’s country home since 1975, including his studio. From the roof,
which is crowned by several of Oteiza’s monumental pieces, you can take
in excellent views of the surrounding countryside. The museum is 9km (6
miles) east of Pamplona in the rural community of Alzuza. (Río Irati buses

More cool things to see and do
Pamplona is dominated by its annual Running of the Bulls festival. If
you’re here then, doing anything else other than partying is nearly
Chapter 12: The Basque Country and Navarra 259

impossible. If you’re here any other time, you’ll be able to explore the
Old Quarter in peace — or catch a game of jai alai, native to these parts.
 Exploring the Old Quarter on foot. A short walk around Pamplona’s
Old Quarter gives you a good feel for the town. Beyond the cathe-
dral, up cobblestoned Calle Bedin, is a nice view of the city and river
below, and the medieval walls that once enclosed Pamplona. Check
out the baroque City Hall, where the rocket signaling the beginning
of the San Fermín festival, in Plaza de los Burgos, fires. On Calle
Ansoleaga 10, is the 13th-century Cámara de Comptos (General
Accounting Office, the oldest in Spain), a beautiful example of 
Gothic civic architecture. Plaza Castillo, built in 1651, is the heart of
Pamplona and a zoo during festival time. Leading from it are several
streets famous for their tascas (tapas bars). You can take a brief walk
around the small casco histórico (historic district) in an hour.
 Taking the no-bull route. If you’re not in Pamplona during the 
San Fermín festival, you can trace the well-worn encierro route. 
The bulls leave the gates from their corrals just outside the Old
Quarter; they proceed along Cuesta de Santo Domingo, race past
the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall), and down the long stretch of Calle
Estafeta. Then the bulls and staggering runners cross Paseo
Hemingway and flood into the Plaza de Toros — the bullring.
Can you guess which macho American writer is represented by a
bust on Pamplona’s Paseo Hemingway? Yep, Ernest Hemingway, the
author of The Sun Also Rises, the novel that brought Sanfermines to a
worldwide audience. Papa is depicted in a thick Irish sweater, above
an inscription that reads, “A friend of the people of Pamplona and an
admirer of their festivals.” During San Fermín, he’ll almost certainly
be wearing a red kerchief around his neck, just like the locals.
 Catching a game of flying balls. Pamplona hosted the World
Championships of pelota, or jai alai, the wickedly fast-paced sport
played in only a few countries in the world. If you want to see a pro-
fessional game, you can catch one at the Frontón Euskal Jai Berri
in Huarte, about 6.5km (4 miles) from Pamplona. Games are gener-
ally Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Call % 948-33-11-59 for
more information and directions.

tional organizations and tours.

 Novotur’s mantra is Unusual Navarra, which means this tour com-
pany offers musical itineraries as well as trips to wine cellars and
amateur bullfights. If San Fermín whetted your appetite for more,
they can set up tests of bravery with young bulls. Novotur’s offices
are located at Av. de Bayona 9, second floor, left entrance (% 948-
23-00-80; www.bideak-navarraactiva.com/cas/novotur.htm).
Roaming the tascas: Pamplona nightlife
Notwithstanding San Fermín — when the town roars, bars are open 
24 hours, and revelers stumble half-crocked from one to the next —
Pamplona’s usually a conservative and fairly quiet town. At night,
wander the streets of the Old Quarter, visiting the tascas. The liveliest
streets are San Nicolás, San Lorenzo, and Jarauta. The bars in the main
square, Plaza del Castillo, are also good watering holes; Café Iruña 
(no. 44) is a legendary Art Deco hangout.

omy,” earlier in the chapter, for a discussion of visiting the towns and

Getting away from it all
To explore a bit of the province of Navarra and regions nearby a car is
the best way to go. Several trains per day run to Olite; contact RENFE
(% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es) for schedules and fares.
The major car-rental agencies in Pamplona are
 Avis: Monasterio de la Oliva 29 (% 948-17-00-36)

 Hertz: Av. de Navarra 2 (% 948-26-12-56 or 948-31-15-95)
Buses that offer frequent service to major cities include
 Conda (% 948-22-10-26; www.conda.es), which travels to Madrid
 Vibasa (% 948-22-09-97; www.vibasa.es), which travels to

The government of the province of Navarra pretty much invented 
the idea of rural home-stays (staying in farmhouses and small rustic
hostales, or hostels) in Spain. If you want to get away from it all, losing
yourself in the intensely green, hilly Navarrese countryside makes for a
terrifically restorative and cheap vacation. (I did it one summer near
Ochagavia, and wound up in an amazing, quiet old farmhouse — a week
there cost me about what two nights in a city hotel cost.) You go on
hikes, bike, and, most of all, eat at simple local restaurants, where the
food is good and the Rioja wines are even better. For information, con-
tact the Association of Rural Hotels of Navarra (% 948-17-60-05; www.
hotelesruralesnavarra.es, though online reservations are still not
possible) or contact the Centralized Reservations bureau of the Navarra
Tourism Office (% 948-42-47-03; turismo@navarra.es), which pub-
lishes a comprehensive book with photos of rural houses in the region.
Olite, in the nearby countryside, makes an excellent day trip from
Pamplona (see the following section). The Rioja wine country is also
within easy reach, although far enough away that at least a single
overnight stay would greatly enhance your enjoyment of the region; for
more information on visiting the towns and wineries of the upper Rioja
region (Rioja Alavesa), see “Taking side trips to La Rioja Alavesa: Wine
and gastronomy” earlier in this chapter.
Olite: A Gothic town
Just more than 40km (25 miles) south of Pamplona, Olite (oh-lee-teh),
one of the most ancient towns in the Navarrese kingdom, was a favorite
of King Charles III. The town’s most notable feature is the spectacular
medieval castle and French Gothic Palacio Real de Olite, the royal
palace with distinctive cone-shaped turrets. Much of the castle is a faith-
ful reconstruction — it was burned in 1813 for fear of its being taken by
Napoleon’s troops — but it continues to impress and delight visitors.
Because the Palacio Viejo (Old Palace) houses a parador, public visits
are confined to the Palacio Nuevo (New Palace). The palace is open
Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. (until 8 p.m.
July and Aug); admission is 2.80€ ($3.50) for adults, 1.40€ ($1.75) for
students and seniors.
Next door to the castle, the Santa María la Real, the former royal chapel,
is a lovely example of the Navarra Gothic style.
Though Olite is certainly dominated by its massive castle, its medieval
streets possesses several other interesting religious constructions
dating from its heyday, such as the Iglesia de San Pedro, Monasterio de
San Francisco, and Monasterio de Santa Engracia, as well as an intricate

f you’ve dreamed of legendary castles rising from the
plains and of seeing the Old Masters who revolutionized
Spanish art, make sure that you spend time dead center 
in the middle of Spain: Madrid and the star attractions of
Castile — Toledo, Segovia, and Salamanca.
Besides being Spain’s capital, Madrid is hands-down Spain’s
cultural epicenter. Few cities in the world can challenge
Madrid when it comes to civic art collections with its world-
famous Prado and other stellar museums. Though Madrid
ranks as a relatively new city — at least when compared to
other European capitals — the great art on view is testament
to Spain’s storied past. But nowhere are the glories and igno-
minies of Spanish history — from the Middle Ages through
the Spanish Inquisition and Golden Era — so present as they
are in several towns on the plains just outside Madrid. Toledo
is the greatest living example of the harmony that once existed
among Christians, Jews, and Moors. Likewise, Castile was 
the land of kings and conquerors, and it’s here that you ﬁnd
cathedrals and citadels, as well as Segovia’s mind-boggling,
2,000-year-old Roman Aqueduct and one of the world’s earli-
est and greatest universities, in Salamanca.

O
n a target of Spain, Madrid is the bull’s-eye, the country’s geo-
graphic and political center. With its unparalleled roster of art
museums and theaters, Madrid is also Spain’s cultural capital and one of
Europe’s foremost art centers. Though Madrid is the home of Velázquez
and the Prado Museum, as well as Picasso’s Guernica, it’s also a city full
of other, more down-to-earth images we’ve come to expect of Spain. Bulls
charging after matadors and red capes in the afternoon sun. A rollicking
nightlife overflowing with tapas joints, wine taverns, and discos — a
place where you may find yourself going to bed at the time when you’d
normally get up.
Madrid is mostly a modern creation. The site of a rather insignificant
Moorish fortress in the ninth century, Madrid was captured by Alfonso
VI, but it remained a small medieval town until the 16th and 17th cen-
turies, Spain’s Golden Age of exploration and wealth. In 1561, at the
height of the era, Felipe II moved the court from Toledo to Madrid. With
less than 500 years under its belt, Madrid is one of Europe’s youngest
capital cities.
Capital of the province of the same name, Madrid has grown unrelentingly
since the 1970s, and especially since Spain became a member of the
European Community in the mid-1980s. Some residents and long-time visi-
tors feel that Madrid has lost much of its classic Castilian flavor — but
you still don’t have to look hard to find it. While sipping a glass of Rioja or
sherry and munching a morsel of tortilla española (Spanish omelet) in a
tapas bar in the heart of the Old City, or stumbling back to your hotel at
dawn, you can still discover the Madrid that has inspired legions of artists
and writers. This is the hedonistic Madrid that invented la marcha — the
late-night revelry that roars louder and later here than anywhere else in
Spain.

You can hit the major museums by day, take a side trip to El Escorial or
Aranjuez, embark upon an impromptu tapas crawl, and soak up theater,
opera, and flamenco by night. The city’s atmospheric mesones and
tascas — cavelike restaurants and taverns — get the night started. When
the sun goes down, you find that Madrileños, the people of Madrid, are
among the most open and gregarious in Spain.
Though the city’s dining scene has been overshadowed in recent years
by that of Barcelona and smaller cities in the Basque Country, Madrid
still has some of Spain’s finest restaurants, and it’s a particularly great
place to feast on Castilian specialties such as suckling pig, lamb, and
pheasant. Madrileños claim that the seafood flown in daily is fresher
even than that found on the coasts.
The best times to visit Madrid are spring and fall. The weather reaches
extremes: cold in the winter, very hot and dry in the summer. If you must
go in summer, avoid August. Not only is it fry-an-egg-on-the-sidewalk hot,
but also the city is dead. Most Madrileños take the entire month off and
escape to cooler climes. Hotel occupancy and rates are pretty consistent

3/11: Terrorism strikes Madrid
Spain, an ally of the United States in its post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, was
itself struck by terrorism on March 11, 2004, just days prior to a national general elec-
tion that pitted the conservative incumbent Partido Popular (Popular Party) against
the challenger Socialist party. Terrorists simultaneously exploded deadly bombs on
four rush-hour commuter trains on their way into the capital’s Atocha station, only
blocks from the Prado Museum, and other train stations nearby. Nearly 200 people
were killed and 1,400 more injured.
The Spanish government initially claimed that ETA, the home-grown Basque terrorist
group, was responsible for the attack, even though the bombings didn’t fit the pattern
of ETA attacks, and ETA refused to claim responsibility. The president and interior min-
ister both insisted that ETA was responsible even after police uncovered direct links
to Islamic terrorists who were members of an Al Qaeda network cell and residents of
Madrid. When it was revealed that the administration had manipulated available infor-
mation to mislead the media and the nation, the Spanish population — which had over-
whelmingly refused to back conservative President José Maria Aznar’s support of the
U.S. war efforts — responded by electing José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of the Socialist
party in a tumultuous and emotionally charged election. After his induction into office,
Zapatero immediately upheld his campaign promise to withdraw Spain’s 1,300 troops
from Iraq. Although Al Qaeda terrorists had certainly sought to influence the election’s
outcome, and some critics felt that Spain had effectively surrendered to and rewarded
the terrorists by toppling the incumbent government, most Spaniards believed that
voters had used the election to punish the Aznar government not only for its unpopu-
lar support of the war but also for its deceptive, politically motivated response to the
terrorist attacks.

all year, except in August, when no one wants to be in Madrid, and
during the San Isidro (mid-May) and Autumn Festivals (late Oct–Nov),
when everyone does. If you want to be a part of Madrid at its most fes-
tive during these celebrations, book several months in advance.
If you only want a taste of Madrid, you still need at least a couple of days
to visit the Prado, see some of Viejo Madrid, and check out the capital’s
dizzying nightlife.
Getting There: All Roads Lead to Madrid
For many years, Madrid was about the only Spanish city you could fly
into from North America and many parts of Europe. And even now, with
Barcelona on the way up as an international destination, the majority of
overseas flights still touch down in Madrid. All roads and flight paths in
Spain lead to Madrid. You can jump on a quick shuttle flight from
Barcelona, or catch the high-speed train from Seville.
By air
Most international airlines, including Iberia, American, Delta, and
others, offer direct flights to Madrid. Madrid’s newly expanded interna-
tional airport, Barajas (bah-rah-hahs), Carretera de Barcelona, Km 16
(% 902-100-107 or 91-305-83-43; www.aena.es) is 15km (9 miles) from the
city center. Brand-new, high-tech Terminal 4 handles most international
flights and is a shuttle bus away from the other terminals. Passing through
Customs can involve waiting in a long line, but is otherwise hassle-free. Be
sure you don’t get in the line that says E.U. (which indicates members of
the European Union), unless, of course, you hold a passport from one of
the E.U. countries. Look instead for the sign that says OTROS PAISES (other
countries) or OTRAS NACIONALIDADES (other nationalities).
Barajas airport is large but simple enough to navigate if you’re not shut-
tling between terminals. You’ll find major auto-rental agencies, an ATM
machine, and a small Tourism Information Office (% 91-305-86-56;
daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.). Carts are available for hauling your luggage, for free.
T2 is the terminal that handles domestic flights, while T3 is reserved for
Barcelona-Madrid shuttle (puente aereo) flights.
Travel time from the airport to downtown is about 30 to 45 minutes. You
now have three options for transport to the city (and returning to the
airport). Taxis, the quickest but most expensive option — and the best 
if you have more than one piece of luggage and/or are tired from a long
flight — are lined up outside the terminals and charge about 20€ ($25)
for a trip to the center of Madrid (tipping isn’t expected). The yellow
Airport Bus service, called Bus 89 (% 91-431-61-92), leaves from the
curb right outside the terminal every 12 minutes for Plaza Colón, making
just a handful of stops on the way; it runs Monday through Friday from 6
a.m. to 11 p.m. and weekends from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Though conven-
ient and inexpensive, the bus requires that you either catch a taxi or
Chapter 13: Madrid 269

walk (and lug your bags) to get to your hotel, so unless you’re staying
near Plaza Colón, it may not be the best option — especially after a long
international flight. The same bus returns to Barajas from the under-
ground station at Plaza Colón. The price either direction is 2.50€ ($3);
pay on board (exact change isn’t necessary).
Line 8 (the pink line) of the Madrid Metro (subway) runs between
Barajas airport (out of T2) and the Nuevos Ministerios station, where it
arrives in just 12 minutes. It’s another 15 minutes from there to down-
town. Stop by the Tourism Information booth for a subway map and
determine the closest stop to your hotel (check out the Metro Web site,
www.metromadrid.es, beforehand and arrive with a plan in hand). The
subway (single-ticket fares are 1€/$1.20) is the cheapest way into the
city, and if your hotel is near a stop, it can also be quite convenient.
However, you have to change lines at least once (and possibly two or
three times). If you’re weighted down by several pieces of luggage, the
subway is far from the easiest option.
Rental cars from the major agencies are available at the airport, but
unless you’re planning on immediately heading outside of Madrid, I
wouldn’t recommend navigating the capital’s intense traffic right after
landing (you won’t need a car in Madrid, and parking is both expensive
and hard to find).
By car
Spain’s major highways (Roman numerals I–VI) radiate outward from
Madrid, which is measured as kilometer zero on the national highway
system. The N-II highway from Barcelona leads to Madrid, as do N-VI
from Santiago and N-IV from Andalusia.
Near the city, look for signs reading CENTRO (center) that take you into
downtown Madrid.
By train
RENFE is the Spanish national train service; its main office, open week-
days only, is located at Alcalá 44 (Metro: Banco de España); for all train
information, call % 902-24-02-02. Madrid splits its train service among
three stations.
 Atocha, Glorieta del Emperador Carlos V, s/n (Metro: Atocha
RENFE), is the station for destinations in south and southeast Spain
and Portugal. The high-speed AVE train (% 902-24-02-02) departs
for (and arrives from) Córdoba and Seville at Atocha.
 Charmartín, Calle Agustín de Foxá, s/n (Metro: Charmartín), the
most modern train station, covers most destinations in north and
northeastern Spain, in addition to most European capitals.
 Estación Príncipe Pío, also called Estación Norte, Paseo del Norte
30 (Metro: Norte), is the station for trains to and from northwestern
Spain, including Salamanca and Galicia.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
270

For several years now, travelers have been surprised to discover that
though a high-speed (AVE) train links Madrid and Seville, there isn’t one
connecting the capital and the second-largest city, Barcelona. Such a
train is finally in the works, though frustratingly delayed. The hope is
that an AVE high-speed railway eventually will make the trip from
Madrid to Barcelona in just two-and-a-half hours (currently, it takes 
six-and-a-half hours).
By bus
Buses that make the most common trips out of the capital to towns in
Castile are on the whole clean and efficient, as well as inexpensive
options for getting around the region.
 Madrid’s main bus terminal, for national and international depar-
tures, is Estación Sur de Autobuses, Calle Méndez Alvaro 83 
(% 91-468-42-00; www.estaciondeautobuses.com; Metro: Palos
de la Frontera or Méndez Alvaro).
 The La Sepulvedana line travels between Madrid and Segovia.
Estación de la Sepulvedana, Paseo de la Florida 11 (% 91-530-48-00
or 91-547-52-61; Metro: Príncipe Pío).
 Empresa Larrea goes between Madrid and Avila. Estación Sur 
(% 91-547-52-61; Metro: Méndez Alvaro).
 Empresa Auto Res buses make the journey between Madrid and
Salamanca. Estación de Auto Res, Calle Fernández Shaw 1 (% 91-
551-72-00).
 Galliano Continental travels back and forth between Madrid and
Toledo. Estación Sur (% 91-527-29-61; Metro: Méndez Alvaro).
Orienting Yourself in Madrid
Madrid doesn’t have any natural landmarks useful for getting your bear-
ings, though it does have several major plazas (squares) and splendid
boulevards linking them that will help you master the city’s layout.
Street numbers are frequently confusing; also, as throughout Spain, the
numbers of addresses don’t often follow logically, and some are labeled
s/n, or sin número (unnumbered). Your best bet is to orient yourself
using the Metro (subway) map, because most destinations are close to 
a Metro stop.
After it was named Spain’s capital, Madrid took off in successive waves
of growth from the 16th to 19th centuries, expanding east and north
from the River Manzanares. But getting a fix on the city and its neighbor-
hoods is easy. You want to spend most of your time in Old Madrid (near
the Plaza Mayor) and Bourbon Madrid (including the Prado Museum and
Retiro Park). Many hotels, restaurants, and shops are located in the
northern and eastern neighborhoods. The periphery, the urban sprawl
of Madrid, is beyond the interest of most short-term visitors.
Chapter 13: Madrid 271

The main arteries of Madrid are Calle Mayor, which runs the length of
the old center (and becomes Calle de San Jerónimo in the more modern
part of the city); Gran Vía and Alcalá, the main commercial streets that
border the newer northern neighborhoods; and Paseo del Prado/Paseo
de la Recoleta, which run perpendicular to Gran Vía and Alcalá along
Madrid’s museum mile (from the Atocha train station past Plaza de
Cibeles). Heading north, beyond Plaza de Colón, Paseo del Prado
becomes the chic, tree- and cafe-lined Paseo de la Castellana.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Three Madrids exist. The first is Old Madrid, the city of the Habsburgs,
between the Royal Palace and Plaza Mayor. Second is Bourbon Madrid,
the area Bourbon monarchs expanded in the 18th century. And the third
is modern Madrid — an urban sprawl that began with such northern
neighborhoods as Barrio Salamanca in the 19th century, and that now
radiates out from the center into rather bland and undistinguished 
suburbs.
Viejo Madrid (Old Madrid)
Viejo Madrid is the heart of the city. The Moors established a fortress
near the river, and Madrid grew up there in the 16th and 17th centuries.
The Old City, the Madrid of the Habsburg royal family, extends from the
Palacio Real (which is actually a much later addition) to Madrid’s ver-
sion of Times Square, Puerta del Sol. The old district is a warren of his-
toric buildings and crooked cobblestone streets. This neighborhood is
where to go for tascas (tapas bars), restaurants, and historical sightsee-
ing. Here you find the Royal Palace and the Old City’s historic buildings
and churches; bustling Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol; Monasterio de
las Decalzas Reales, Madrid’s most important convent; and a wealth of
atmospheric taverns and tapas bars.
Bourbon Madrid
No, a bunch of Kentucky distilleries didn’t suddenly take up residence in
Madrid. East of Viejo Madrid, the expansion overseen by Carlos III of the
Bourbon dynasty is an area of grand boulevards, plazas, and fountains,
but also thick layers of 18th-century apartment buildings. Bourbon
Madrid is home to Madrid’s major museums — Spain’s Big Three, the
Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Reina Sofía — and its most popular
park, Retiro, as well as many of the city’s finest hotels and restaurants.
Modern Madrid
Beginning in the 19th century, Madrid expanded yet again, north and
south and every which way. Modern Madrid is an ever-expanding suc-
cession of residential neighborhoods filled with elegant shops, cinemas,
restaurants, banks, and smaller museums. You can find a number of fine
hotels in these neighborhoods, and they make for a quieter stay if you
don’t mind taking the subway to get to Madrid’s star attractions. Modern
Madrid contains the Barrio de Salamanca, a 19th-century neighborhood
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
272

of elegant, expensive apartments and superchic boutiques; Chueca, a
bohemian barrio full of restaurants, bars, and funky clothing and design
shops; Paseo de la Castellana, a wide boulevard lined with trees and
cafes; and Plaza de Toros de las Ventas, one of Spain’s best-known bull-
fighting arenas.
Finding information after you arrive
Municipal Tourism Offices are located at Plaza Mayor 3 (% 91-588-16-36;
www.munimadrid.es), open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
8 p.m. and Sunday and holidays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Duque de
Medinaceli 2 (% 902-10-49-51), open Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Mercado Puerta de
Toledo 1 (% 902-10-00-07), open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Barajas Airport at the
International Arrivals Terminal (% 91-305-86-56), open daily from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m.; and the Chamartín and Atocha train stations. Call % 902-10-
21-12 for additional tourism information or to register a complaint; 
call % 010 for general information. In addition, in summer months
(July–Sept), yellow tourist information kiosks operate from 10 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. daily on Calle de Bailén in front of the Palacio Real, at the
Museo del Prado, on the Puerta del Sol, and at El Corte Inglés depart-
ment store on Plaza Callao.
Getting around Madrid
Madrid is large and sprawling, but the places that interest most visitors
are in a fairly compact area. In fact, you can walk much of Madrid, and
what you can’t is accessible using the Metro system, which is easy to
navigate and goes just about everywhere you need.
By subway
The Metro (% 012 or 91-486-07-52; www.metromadrid.es), marked by
red and blue diamond-shaped signs, is Madrid’s subway — by far the
fastest and easiest way to navigate the city. Stops are almost everywhere
you want to go. Single-ticket fares are 1€ ($1.20). Hours are Monday to
Sunday from 6 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. You can find handy maps (plano del
metro) at Metro stations.
A ten-trip ticket (Metrobus) is available for 6.15€ ($7.40), a nearly half-
price bargain. It pays for itself after six journeys on the Metro and can be
used by additional passengers. You’ll use it up in no time, and it also
works on the bus.
By bus
Taking the bus around town is complicated for first-time visitors.
Conductors generally don’t speak English, and with all the traffic on the
wide avenues and tiny streets, getting a read on the city from the window
Chapter 13: Madrid 273

of a bus is tough. I usually stick to the airport bus on the way in, and go
with the subway (Metro) and my own two feet until I catch the bus back
to the airport. If you prefer your travel above ground, though, about 150
bus lines (called EMT; www.emtmadrid.es) cover Madrid. Buses run
from 6 a.m. to midnight daily; the fare is 1€ ($1.20); special night buses
(called buhos, or night owls) run much less frequently, from midnight to 6
a.m. For information, call % 012.
By taxi
Authorized taxis are white with diagonal red bands. Few taxi rides in
town cost more than 8€ ($9.60). You can hail a cab in the street (the
little green light on the roof means you can hop in) or get one where
they line up (usually outside hotels). A slightly higher night rate is
charged from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Taxi companies include Tele-Taxi
(% 91-371-21-34), Radio Taxi (% 91-405-55-00), and Radio Taxi
Independiente (% 91-405-12-13), all of which you can call to make
transportation arrangements.
Taxi rates in Madrid are pretty reasonable, and most drivers are honest,
but a few try to rip off tourists. I have had several taxi drivers in Madrid
(but only in Madrid — not in any other Spanish city) try to jack up the
fare on me (one even slyly placed his street guide over the meter in an
attempt to claim it wasn’t working). Check the fare at the beginning of
the journey so that you don’t end up paying for the last guy’s ride, and
ask about any suspicious supplements to your fare.
By car
Don’t drive in Madrid unless you’re forced to. Trust me on this one —
traffic is horrendous, especially during rush hour, and you can’t park
anywhere. A car is really only useful for getting out of the city. Rental-car
companies include Europcar (% 91-721-12-12) at the Atocha and
Chamartín train stations; Avis, Gran Vía 60 (% 902-13-55-31); and Hertz,
Gran Vía 88 (% 91-393-72-28). You can also find these companies at the
airport.
On foot
Madrid isn’t the classic walking city that Barcelona is, although people
walk everywhere around Viejo Madrid and love to stroll the Paseo del
Prado and Paseo la Castellana on summer evenings. But, as sprawling as
the city is, you can still cover the areas of greatest interest on foot. Just
don’t overdo it. Hop on the efficient and inexpensive Metro (subway) to
pop around the city. When you do walk, be very careful crossing streets;
pedestrians have few rights in Spain as a whole and even fewer in
Madrid. Check out “Seeing Madrid by Guided Tour,” later in this chapter,
for information on walking tours organized by the Tourism Office.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
274

Staying in Style
In addition to its status as a top tourist destination, Madrid is also the
top draw in Spain for international business travelers, so the capital is
flush with hotel options of every stripe. You have plenty of choices, from
a surfeit of inexpensive pensiones and residencias to some of the finest
white-glove palaces in Europe, but hotels in Madrid are among the most
expensive in Spain. Don’t panic: I include some money-wise tips in this
section so you don’t have to worry about taking out a loan for your trip
to Madrid.
Madrid’s classic hotel Reina Victoria hotel, which had been around since
the 1920s and had been the accommodations of choice for generations
of bullfighters, is no longer. It will be transformed into a Hard Rock
Hotel, which to my mind indicates something unfortunate about
Madrid’s evolution.
Many hotels are scattered along the Gran Vía, which isn’t the greatest
place to be walking after dark, and near Atocha Station. Old Madrid also
has a good selection of accommodations ringing the central Plaza Mayor
and Puerta del Sol. These areas attract their share of pickpockets
because they’re popular travel destinations, but due to their proximity
to prime dining and sightseeing, they’re also among the most exciting
places to be in Madrid.
Most hotel rates don’t include breakfast or IVA, the 7 percent value-
added tax. To ensure the bill isn’t a shock at the end of your stay, make
sure you ask about these taxes when booking your room. For more infor-
mation on booking accommodations in Spain, see Chapter 7.
Many of Madrid’s hotels cater to business travelers, so weekend rates
and special deals are often available — asking is always a good idea.
Unless it’s high season and the hotel is near capacity, you can probably
get a break (sometimes as much as half off the rack rate, the maximum
rate a hotel charges for a room).
The top hotels
AC Palacio del Retiro
$$$$$
Bourbon Madrid (near Retiro Park)
One of the newest ventures in Madrid by the dependable, upscale AC
Hotels chain (which operates a half-dozen other properties in the capital),
this midsize luxury hotel (51 rooms), inaugurated in 2004, has a perfect
location and terrific bones. It inhabits a beautiful, early-20th-century
palace (a National Heritage–protected structure) overlooking Retiro Park
and just a few short blocks from the Prado Museum. The palace contains
a gorgeous central staircase, stained-glass windows, and marble columns.
Rooms are sleek, respecting the original style of the building but adding

Viejo Madrid/Gran Vía
A smart, midsize hotel that belongs to a small Barcelona-based chain, the
Villa de la Reina is a great midrange choice. It occupies a classic early-20th-
century building along the Gran Vía — a busy but central location. Rooms
aren’t huge, but they’re finely detailed with stylish furnishings and sleek
bathrooms, and personnel are very friendly and professional.

Hespería Madrid
$$$$$
Modern Madrid
Madrid’s hottest entry into the ultraluxury category, this handsome con-
temporary hotel on the Paseo de la Castellana has quickly outclassed
many of its more established competitors. It’s a couple of miles north of
the Prado. A member of Leading Hotels of the World, it exudes refined
style. A perfect choice for anyone who finds Madrid’s other top-of-the-line
hotels, such as the Ritz or the Westin Palace, to be entirely too fussy and
old-fashioned. Compared to those, the Hespería is also a bargain, with rack
rates cheaper by 100€ or so. As notable as the hotel is its expensive and
very fashionable restaurant, Santceloni (see restaurant listings later in this
chapter). Offers available online (as low as 139€/$178) make this stylish
hotel surprisingly affordable.

The smoothly professional NH chain, with a couple of dozen hotels in
Madrid, leaves nothing to chance. They’re designed for business travelers
who want things just so, but those demands also make them perfect for
tourists. And who cares if NH hotels are predictable, when that only means
excellent execution? Expect spacious, well-decorated rooms with light
woods, bold colors, and original art, nice bathrooms, and good service.

Madrid, is a bargain hunter’s dream. Occupying an old church, the family-
run hotel features bright and cheery, smartly outfitted rooms. Most have
windows overlooking the street. You can even step it up a notch in the new
Suite del Palomar, a large and handsome atticlike space on the top floor
with a rooftop terrace.

Hotel Villa Real
$$$$
Bourbon Madrid
The less-expensive kid sister of the fancy new Hotel Urban, the Villa Real
is a contemporary building designed to look historic (you have to make
up your own mind about that; to me it’s tasteful kitsch, if such a thing
exists). This hotel is much more traditional than the Derby chain’s daring,
design-oriented hotels (the Urban and Hotel Claris in Barcelona). Richly
decorated with dark woods and warm tones and suffused with a quiet ele-
gance, rooms are superior to the functional lobby. Many are split-level with
separate sitting areas. Bathrooms are plush with fine linens. Best of all,
you can’t get a better location, just a short walk from the Prado and Paseo
de la Castellana.

Petit Palace Arenal
$$$–$$$$
Viejo Madrid (just north of Plaza Mayor)
This member of an upstart Spanish chain — which in a short time has
assembled 18 hotels in the capital city — targets a distinctive niche: sleek,
modern hotels with the latest in high-tech facilities. A contemporary mid-
size hotel, it’s perfect for visitors who want stylish comfort along with con-
venience and a historic location. Near the Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol,
this well-run hotel offers free high-speed Internet access in all rooms.
Although most rooms aren’t especially large, they are a good value; terrific
for families are the “Family Rooms” that sleep up to four (however, the
hotel’s location across a busy street from one of Madrid’s most popular

Splurging at Madrid’s granddaddy hotels
Madrid has a pair of historic, superluxe hotel options, as well as a couple of boutique
hotels that cater to individuals who want pampering and are willing to pay for it. The
Ritz and the Palace hotels are storied, famous, and well-located, and they rank among
the best hotels in Europe. (The Santo Mauro is right up there, too, and is less fussy; see
the listing in the section “The top hotels.”)
The turn-of-the-20th-century, recently refurbished Ritz Madrid (now owned by Orient
Express) is glamor incarnate, but it’s also extremely formal (jacket and tie in this heat?).
If you want a hotel that exudes Belle Epoque sophistication fit for kings and movie
stars — and prices to match — this is it.

The massive Westin Palace Hotel, a Starwood property across the Paseo del Prado,
is nearly as stylish and elegant as the Ritz — especially its glitzy public rooms.
Madrileña society, well-heeled foreigners, and celebrities are fixtures here. A long-
awaited renovation was completed in the late 1990s.

If the Ritz and Palace Hotels are too ritzy and regal for your wallet (they certainly are
for mine), you can still get a taste of their all-out luxury. Check out the sumptuous lobby
of the Palace, with its spectacular glass cupola, or the refined bar of the Ritz — just
make sure you’re properly dressed. At the Ritz, that means jacket and tie for men, a
skirt, dress, or nice pants for women. Stop by on your way to a nice dinner elsewhere
in Madrid.
Another first-class option is the newest addition to Madrid’s ultraluxury hotels, Hotel
Orfila, a Relais & Châteaux property set in a gorgeous 1886 townhouse midway
between the Plaza de Colón and Plaza Alonso Martínez. With just 32 rooms, it’s not an
imposing megahotel like the Palace or Ritz, but it offers a similar kind of style and pam-
pering and is a comparative value. The rooms are warm and sumptuously decorated,
furnished with lovely period antiques.

Viejo Madrid
A design-oriented hotel that strikes an excellent balance between under-
stated chic and budget inn, this small, 30-room place, very near the Teatro
Real, is hip and urban with a gray, black, and cream color scheme
(accented by funky, neo-mod patterns). Rooms are good-sized, and bath-
rooms are cool, with bold black-and-white tiles; the hotel’s a definite bar-
gain for anyone looking for style without a hefty price tag. The Room Mate
Hoteles group now has other hotels, also given human first names, in cen-
tral Madrid, including Alicia (Calle Prado 2) and two others on the way,
Oscar and Laura—all excellent options for reasonably priced design.

If you think only the super-rich staying at the Ritz and the Palace get to
have huge rooms in Madrid, think again. Tucked away on a small street
not far from Plaza Santa Ana, this tiny hotel (just 18 rooms) with a pale
pink exterior has shockingly large suites, perfect for the whole family. That
means unheard-of kitchenettes and comfortable salons for the price of a
standard room. Rooms are decorated with contemporary furniture in
bright colors. Triples have sofa beds. It’s obviously no budget hotel, but
the Suite Prado Hotel is still one of the best deals in Madrid, if you can get
a room. Call a few weeks in advance.

Dining Out
For years, dining in Madrid has meant either big, fancy restaurants —
where elegant service is king — charming Viejo Madreleño taverns, or
tascas, in which eating is really an excuse for drinking. With a recently
invigorated dining scene, Madrid is trying to catch up to Bilbao, San
Sebastián, and Barcelona, where creativity has been more valued. As the
capital, of course, Madrid has all the regional specialties, a wide variety
of international cuisines, and fresh seafood flown in from the coasts. In
many popular places, you can easily imagine macho Hemingway chomp-
ing on suckling pig.
The city’s tascas (tapas restaurants) and mesones (cavelike taverns) are
ideal places to stop in for a vinito (bee-nee-toh; small glass of red wine),
jerez (heh-reth; sherry), and a smattering of tapas. Although you can
easily put together a good meal from a tapas crawl in Madrid, more than
anything else it qualifies as a cultural itinerary. Making the rounds of
these bars is one of the highlights of visiting Madrid — a perfect comple-
ment to afternoons viewing great paintings in the Prado. For a list of a
few worth popping into, see “Living It Up After Dark: Madrid’s Nonstop
Nightlife,” later in this chapter.

Bed-and-breakfasts in Madrid
B&Bs aren’t common in Spain like they are in England and Ireland, although a few are
worth checking out.
Casa de Madrid (Arrieta 2–2; % 91-559-57-91; fax 91-540-11-00. www.casade
madrid.com) offers a B&B experience of high style in a great location near the
Opera House and Royal Palace. On the second floor of a spectacular late-18th-
century building, the sprawling apartment has seven rooms that range from 230€ to
260€ ($276–$318) per night. The guest rooms are decorated with exquisite taste, fea-
turing beautiful antiques and themes related to the owner’s travels. Note that not all
rooms have air-conditioning, and some feature kitchenettes.
A California-based organization, European B&B, offers stays at private family resi-
dences (and at some unoccupied apartments) in Madrid (as well as in Rome, London,
and Paris) that are a nice alternative to the standard hotel scene. Prices are quite rea-
sonable. The Web site has detailed information on the service as well as on each
house or apartment, including several photos of all properties. You may find European
bedrooms smaller than what you’re accustomed to, and not all buildings have eleva-
tors. Prices range from 80€ to 145€ ($96–$174) per night based on double occupancy,
breakfast and taxes included. Contact European B&B at % 800-872-2632 in the United

Madrid’s top eats
Botín
$$$
Viejo Madrid
CASTILIAN
You want classic Madrid? Botín can serve up the stalwarts of Castilian
cooking, roast suckling pig and roast leg of lamb prepared in ancient wood
ovens. Prepare to meet your neighbors from back home in this crowded
spot, though. Everyone seems to know that Botín has the reputation of
being the oldest restaurant in the world (it hasn’t closed its doors since
1725). A favorite with families who don’t mind the bustle, Botín doubles
as a history lesson for kids. How’s this for pedigree? Francisco de Goya, the
legendary painter, was once a dishwasher at Botín. Not good enough?
Okay, how about the fact that Hemingway set a scene in The Sun Also Rises
in this famed restaurant?

Eating like a Madrileño
Because it’s the capital (and Madrileños love to eat), you can find any type of cuisine
you want in Madrid, from the freshest fish to the most sophisticated Basque prepara-
tions. Classic dishes are cocido (koh-thee-doh, a slow-cooked pork and chickpea
soup/stew), callos (kah-yohs, or tripe with chorizo sausage), and sopa de ajo (garlic
soup). Carnivores may also want to try rabo de buey (oxtail) and cordero asado (roast
baby lamb). Nothing beats hot chocolate and churros (fritters) after a late night — a
night that, in all probability, began with rounds of tapas.
Many Madrid restaurants serve callos at least once a week for the midday menu.
Before you blindly say, “I’ll try it” — as I once did and then immediately regretted my
decision — you need to know that this classic Madrid dish is tripe and various other
innards, which I think are only for the brave.
Texans have their barbecue, New Yorkers have their pizza, and New Englanders have
their clam chowder. And Spaniards? Well, Spaniards wax poetic about ham. Jamón
serrano, cured ham, the entry level of elite hams, is a national obsession. Aficionados
of thin Iberian ham — especially jamón de Jabugo and pata negra — claim it’s Spain’s
greatest delicacy. A ración (portion) of dry, razor-thin shavings of the stuff sets you
back 20€ ($24) or more, but that matters little to the Spaniards who talk about it the way
others rhapsodize about caviar. In Madrid, good places to try some deluxe Iberian ham
are Cinco Jotas, Serrano 118 (% 91-562 27 10), Casa Lucío, Cava Baja 35 (% 91-365
32 52), and Museo del Jamón, Gran Via 72 (% 91-541-20-23), which isn’t quite (as the
name implies) a Ham Museum, but a restaurant-deli dedicated to slicing and serving
cured hams from all over Spain. Other branches can be found at Alcalá 155 (% 91-
431-72-96), and Atocha 54 (% 91-369-22-04).

of place that has you considering a sabbatical in Spain before you finish
the first bottle of wine. The famous faces and sharp-dressed crowd only
add to the buzz. The food is top-quality comfort food — like the house mer-
luza (hake, a white fish similar to cod), shrimp in garlic sauce, roasted
lamb, and scrambled potatoes and eggs (now there’s a dish even a finicky
child will love).

brightly colored plexiglass dish chairs and stripes of neon lighting. It’s light
years from Madrid’s stock of mesones and tascas. The Basque menu is
nicely done and attractively priced. Try the terrific Ensalada Pórtico, a
salad wrapped in long slices of zucchini, baby squid with carmelized
onions, or braised duck in orange sauce. Even the extras, like tiny palate
cleansers, are highly choreographed to go with the stylized look of the
place; a small appetizer brought before my meal was a neon green pea
soup looking just so perfect in a small martini glass.

Exploring Madrid
When visiting Madrid, concentrate on two things: gorging on great art
and stuffing yourself silly with tapas and small glasses of wine, beer, and
sherry. If you’re a fan or just curious, attend a sun- and blood-drenched
bullfight. Most visitors also have day trips on their mind, but if you have
more time in Madrid, take a crack at some smaller museums and grace-
ful parks, and then get to the fantastic shopping and fine dining.
Madrid has the greatest concentration of important museums in Spain —
and more first-class works by Spanish masters including El Greco,
Velázquez, Goya, and Picasso (among others) than anywhere else. If you
can hit only the top two or three, begin with the Prado and the Royal
Palace (which is a museum of sorts). Allow a full morning or afternoon
for the Prado and a couple of hours for the Royal Palace. The Thyssen
and Reina Sofía also require a couple of hours each — more if their envi-
able collections hook you. Also, allow some extra time to explore the
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile

neighborhoods around the museums on foot. In Viejo Madrid, around the
Plaza Mayor, spend a couple of hours (preferably in the early evening,
when tapas crawlers are out and about) and discover the city’s soul in its
cinematic mesones and tascas. Then again, hanging out in tapas bars can
easily become an all-night affair.
If you’re a serious art lover and are banking on hitting Madrid’s Big
Three — the Prado, the Thyssen Bornemisza, and the Reina Sofía 
museums — all within hours of landing, make sure that your visit isn’t
on a Monday or Tuesday. The first two museums are closed on Monday,
and the Reina Sofía collection shuts its doors on Tuesday. None of them
closes for lunch, though, and occasionally that’s the best time to visit
(from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. or so).
In addition to both the Prado and Reina Sofía museums, many smaller
museums throughout the city offer free admission on Saturday after-
noons (2 p.m.–closing) and Sunday mornings. However, those times are
the most crowded. If you hate crowds, go during the week when the
museums are much less crowded. Or, take advantage of the free periods
by going Saturday during lunchtime (2–4 p.m.); the museums really clear
out then.
The Madrid Card Billete Turístico — available in one-, two-, and three-
day versions — allows for unlimited travel on the subway (in zone A) 
as well as free entry to more than 40 museums (including the Prado,
Thyssen, Reina Sofía, Palacio Real, Aranjuez and El Escorial) and a host
of additional discounts at restaurants and other places of interest.
Tickets are 38€ ($48) for the one-day ticket; 48€ ($60) for the two-day;
and 58€ ($73) for the three-day. You can purchase them at the Plaza
Mayor and Duque de Medinaceli Oficinas de Turismo, as well as at the
airport and train stations. For more information, call % 91-524-13-70
or 902-08-89-08, or see www.madridcard.com (discounts available for
online purchase).
Be extremely careful around the Prado and other museum tourist
haunts, where thieves artfully prey upon unsuspecting tourists. If some-
one offers to clean mustard or some other substance off your clothing,
recognize it as a trick and refuse assistance: The thief is the one who put
the mustard there, and he or she (or an accomplice) will proceed to rob
you after distracting you.
The top attractions
Museo del Prado
Bourbon Madrid
If you were to count the great museums of classical paintings on one hand,
the Prado might be, say, your index finger. Many experts consider it to be
the second-best art museum in Europe (after the Louvre in Paris). It holds
the world’s richest and most complete collection of Spanish Old Masters,
Chapter 13: Madrid 289

making the museum one of the top attractions in Spain. Don’t miss it —
unless the thought of classical painting makes your skin crawl. The
museum is finally completing a massive expansion project, overseen by
the esteemed Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, that will double its exhibi-
tion space and the number of paintings the museum can show from 1,200
to 2,600. The Prado began as the initiative of Spanish kings, great art col-
lectors all, who sought a suitable place to hang the paintings they had
amassed. The Prado’s 12th- through 19th-century collection of the Spanish
school includes masterpieces by Velázquez, Goya, El Greco, Murillo,
Ribera, and Zurbarán. The Velázquez and Goya collections are the star
draws; so go directly to the galleries featuring their works if your time or
interest is limited. Expect crowds there, though; as you approach the room
where Velázquez’s masterpiece Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting) hangs,
you can hear the growing rumble of guides and groups. The Prado also
contains extraordinary works by Venetian masters — including Titian, Fra
Angélico, Raphael, and Botticelli — and Flemish greats Hieronymous
Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and Brueghel the Elder.
To try and beat the crowds at the Prado, enter through the Velázquez door
(facing Paseo del Prado), and go early (9 a.m.) or during the Spanish lunch
hour (2–4 p.m.). If you’re an art aficionado, purchasing a room-by-room
guide is a good idea.
The Prado is so large, and it possesses so many extraordinary works, that
a single visit can only scratch the surface. But don’t let that deter you. Head
for the highlights first (see “Must-sees: A Prado primer,” later in this chap-
ter, for more information) and proceed from there, according to your time
and energy. The ground floor features Goya’s Black Paintings, the 15th- and
16th-century Flemish School, and El Greco. On the first floor are Velázquez,
Goya, 15th- and 16th-century Italian works, and the 17th-century Dutch and
Flemish Schools. New galleries dedicated to the work of Velázquez opened
in 1999, on the 400th anniversary of the great artist’s birth.
You could probably spend several days at the Prado, but because few
people have that kind of time or interest, budget at least a half-day to see
what will amount to but a small fraction of its immense collection; plan on
taking a couple of back-saving breathers at the cafeteria.

Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales
Viejo Madrid
A visit to this former royal palace — and splendid example of Renaissance
architecture — is a retreat from Madrid’s modern madness. Converted into
a convent for women in the mid-16th century, it’s anything but plain. A
grand, fresco-lined staircase takes visitors to an upper cloister gallery with
a series of extravagant chapels. The convent’s collection of religious art

Chapter 13: Madrid 291
Must-sees: A Prado primer
Diego Velázquez y Silva’s Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting) is the Prado’s most
popular, and probably its greatest, painting. A masterful achievement of perspective,
spatial depth, and lighting, the painting perennially appears near the top on critics’
lists of the greatest works in art history. In Las Meninas, the Infanta Margarita is
depicted in the artist’s studio (Velázquez himself, who appears in the lower left corner
of the work) along with her maids and two dwarfs. The Infanta’s parents, the king,
Felipe IV, and his queen are sitting for a portrait; however, they appear only as reflec-
tions in a mirror in the background. As you look at the painting, notice how it draws
your eyes from the Infanta toward the back of the room, climbing the terraces to the
mirrored reflection. In addition to this famed work that draws crowds, check out this
partial list of the museum’s greatest hits.
From the Spanish School (16th–18th century):
 Diego Velázquez: Las Meninas; The Spinners; Christ Crucified; Surrender of Breda;
The Triumph of Bacchus; The Fable of Arachne
 Bartolomé Murillo: Immaculate Conception
 José Ribera: The Martyrdom of St. Felipe; The Trinity
 Francisco de Goya: The Naked Maja and The Clothed Maja; the “Black Paintings,”
including Saturn Devouring His Son; The Second of May; Executions at Moncloa;
The Family of Carlos IV
 El Greco: Adoration of the Shepherds
 Zurbarán: Still Life
From the Italian School (15th–17th century):
 Titian: Venus with the Organist; Self-Portrait
 Fra Angélico: The Annunciation
 Sandro Boticelli: Tale of Nastagio degli Honesti
 Tintoretto: The Lavatory
From the Flemish School (15th–17th century):
 Hieronymous Bosch: Garden of Earthly Delights; The Hay Cart
 Pieter Breughel the Elder: The Triumph of Death
 Raphael: The Holy Family with Lamb; Portrait of a Cardinal
 Peter Paul Rubens: The Three Graces
From the German and Dutch Schools (16th–17th century):
 Albrecht Dürers: Adam and Eve; Self-Portrait
 Rembrandt: Artemis

by the Old Masters is exceptional. The highlights are Breughel’s Adoration
of the Magi, Zurbarán’s Saint Francis, Titian’s Caesar’s Coin, and a priceless
collection of 16th-century tapestries. Visitation hours at the convent,
where a small group of cloistered nuns still live, are peculiar and not
always adhered to.
This small museum has a past as fascinating as its name (Monastery of the
Royal Barefoot Franciscans). The daughter of Emperor Carlos V, Juana of
Austria, founded the convent of Poor Clares in a noble palace. The women
of noble families that entered the nunnery brought sizable dowries, mostly
great works of art. Nobles also squirreled away their young, illegitimate
daughters here to be reared by the nuns.
Admission to the convent is by 45-minute guided tour (in Spanish) only;
note that hours are rather limited.

Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía
Bourbon Madrid
The third address on Madrid’s celebrated Art Avenue — the Paseo del
Prado — is this contemporary art museum. It boasts major works from
Spain’s 20th-century greats, such as Picasso, Miró, Dalí, and Julio González,
but it’s Pablo Picasso’s dramatic Guernica, the most famous painting of the
20th century, that dwarfs them all. The massive canvas in gray, black, and
white is a moving antiwar protest. (Picasso painted it after the Nationalist
bombing of a small Basque town during the Civil War.) Picasso’s Guernica
was housed for many years in New York’s Museum of Modern Art, and
Picasso stipulated that his most visceral painting not return to his home-
land until the dictator Franco died and democracy was restored in Spain.
Franco died in 1975, but the work remained in New York until 1981.
Ironically, even though Picasso felt that the Prado, his country’s greatest
museum, was the only logical place for the painting to reside, the painting
never made it to the Prado proper. Guernica had its own gallery in the
Prado annex, Casón del Buen Retiro, before officials moved it to the Museo
Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía down the street.
The Reina Sofía is especially strong in early-20th-century works by Spanish
artists as well as in abstract art, pop art, and minimalist sculptures and
paintings. The museum recently underwent a massive renovation and
amplification, adding three new buildings by the French architect Jean
Nouvel. If you’re a contemporary art lover, you’ll want to spend almost as
much time here as at the Prado; allow a couple of hours, at a minimum,
for your visit

Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza
Bourbon Madrid
Across the street from the Prado, the museum with a decidedly un-
Spanish, tongue-twister of a name has quickly become a premier attrac-
tion in Madrid. In 1993, the Spanish government acquired the spectacular
private collection amassed by the Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza and his son,
two generations of German industrial magnates.
The Spanish government renovated the early-19th-century pink
Villahermosa palace to show its new bounty. Begun in the 1920s, the
Thyssen collection comprises 800 stylistically diverse works and aims to
be no less than a survey of Western art, from primitives and medieval art
to 20th-century avant-garde and pop art. Displayed chronologically (start-
ing from the top floor) and heavy on Impressionism and German
Expressionism, the collection reads like a roster of the greatest names in
classical and modern art: Caravaggio, Rafael, Titian, El Greco, Goya,
Rubens, Degas, Gauguin, Cézanne, Manet, Van Gogh, Picasso, Chagall,
Miró, and Pollock. Some observers tout it as the greatest private collec-
tion ever assembled, while others criticize it as a showy collection of
minor works by major artists.

Palacio Real de Madrid
Viejo Madrid
Occupying the site of a ninth-century Moorish alcázar (fortress), the Royal
Palace built by Spain’s Bourbon monarchs makes a grandiose statement
about Madrid’s place in the world, circa 1750. Each room is an exercise in
megawatt wealth, and taste flies out the window. The huge neoclassical
palace — it has 2,000 rooms — incorporated the lavish tastes of both
Carlos III and Carlos IV. The official residence of the Royal Family until
1931, it’s now used only for state functions, because King Juan Carlos and
Queen Sofía live in more modest digs, the Zarzuela Palace just beyond
Madrid. Allow two to three hours to visit the Palace; guided tours are
offered, but not really necessary or particularly worthwhile.
Of special note are the Throne Room, with its scarlet wall coverings,
Baroque gilded mirrors, and a Tiepolo fresco on the ceiling; the regal Gala
Dining Room, which shows off a spectacular dining table and jaw-dropping
tapestries; and the Porcelain Room, covered floor to ceiling in a garish
Chapter 13: Madrid 293

display of green, white, and purple porcelain. Check out the old Royal
Pharmacy (near the ticket office), which has Talavera pottery jars and old
recipe books of medications. In the Real Armería is a fine display of arms
and armor. Wander to the edge of the large Plaza de la Armería (Royal
Armory Square) that faces the palace, and you see how abruptly Madrid
ends and the plains begin. Look also for the new temporary exhibits hall,
part of what will eventually become the Museum of Royal Collections
(with a permanent display of carriages, tapestries, paintings, silver, and
crystal belonging to Spain’s long lines of monarchs).
After your visit to the Royal Palace, step across Calle Bailén to the statue-
lined Plaza de Oriente, where generations of monarchs and politicos have
addressed the masses. The square, a good spot to take a breather, faces
the recently remodeled Teatro Real, the Royal Opera House.
If you visit the Royal Palace on the first Wednesday of the month, you have
a chance to see the ceremonial changing of the guards (at noon for free).
And if you’re carrying a European Union passport, you can get into the
Royal Palace for free on Wednesdays, too.

Panteón de Goya (Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida)
Parque del Oeste
If you’re a fan of Goya, particularly of his dark works, you may want to pay
your respects by making a detour out to his pantheon (a bit out of the way
beyond the Estación Norte train station). King Carlos IV commissioned
Goya, his court painter, to create frescoes for the cupola and vaults of the
chapel, Ermita de San Antonio, in 1798. Some consider the romantic works
among Goya’s best. Fittingly, Goya is entombed in the chapel beneath his
frescoes of Madrid society, which he was a master of depicting. Goya’s
remains were exhumed and brought to Madrid in 1908 from the Bordeaux
region of France. It’s rumored, though, that the artist’s head was inexpli-
cably missing.

modern, yet charmingly traditional, Madrid.

Parque del Buen Retiro
Bourbon Madrid
If your feet and back ache from doing overtime at the museums, peaceful
Retiro Park beckons. A pretty expanse of green lawns, lush gardens, foun-
tains, and tree-lined promenades, the park is prime strolling and sunning
ground for Madrileños of all ages. Do as they do: Kick off your shoes,
smoke lots of cigarettes (just kidding), and take a siesta (but attach your
belongings to one of your limbs so you don’t wake up without your camera
or purse). If you’re traveling with children, rent a rowboat and paddle on
the small lake in the center of the park. In summer, the park comes alive
with ice-cream and handicrafts vendors, musicians, tarot-card readers, and
lovers rolling around in the grass. The Palacio de Cristal (Crystal Palace),
is a handsome 19th-century iron-and-glass solarium that houses a sculp-
ture garden.
Location: Bordered by streets Alfonso XII and Alcalá, with main entrances on both.
If you enter at the corner by Puerta de Alcalá, you can head right down Av. de México
to the park lake (Metro: Retiro).
Plaza Mayor
Viejo Madrid
Madrid’s Main Square is one of the most famous and attractive plazas in
Spain. The early-17th-century arcaded plaza today hosts restaurants, out-
door cafes, shops, and student hangouts, but its past is like a microcosm
of Spain itself. The Plaza Mayor was the scene of lively marketplaces and
theater festivals, bullfights and coronations of kings, religious processions
and public executions, and trials during the Spanish Inquisition. Colorful
frescoes above the arcades adorn the Casa de la Panadería (the bakery).
Check out an equestrian statue of Felipe III in the plaza’s center. Make sure
you spend a couple of hours wandering around the neighborhood that
spills out from the Plaza Mayor; it’s filled with small shops and — guess
what? — tapas bars. See “Living It Up After Dark: Madrid’s Nonstop
Nightlife,” later in this chapter, for my recommendations.
Location: Off Calle de Toledo, just south of Calle Mayor (Metro: Sol or Opera).
Plaza de Toros de las Ventas
Barrio Salamanca
Few observers are indifferent to bullfighting. One of Spain’s most repre-
sentative traditions, it has passionate, die-hard fans as well as staunch
opponents, who decry it as a barbaric anachronism. If you faint at the sight
of blood, don’t even consider attending a bullfight. I’m always surprised,
though, how many people find themselves transfixed by the spectacle of
man and beast squaring off in a ring. To aficionados, bullfighting is more
art and ritual than sport. The uninitiated may have a hard time grasping
that concept — after all, six bulls are put out to die each afternoon — but
if you’re up to it, Madrid is one of the top spots in Spain to witness the
Spanish fascination with matadors and charging beasts. The Plaza de
Chapter 13: Madrid 295

Toros de las Ventas isn’t the oldest bullring in Spain (that honor goes to
Ronda in Andalusia), but it represents, along with Ronda and Seville, the
pinnacle of Spanish bullfighting. Built in the 1920s, its tiles and Moorish-
style arches are meant to evoke the mudéjar architecture so prevalent in
southern Spain.
If you can’t stomach a corrida (bullfight), or if you land in Madrid out of
season, you can visit the Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum), a modest
place with portraits of famous matadors, jewel-encrusted capes and jack-
ets, stuffed bull heads, and Goya etchings. You can see the outfit belong-
ing to Spain’s first female bullfighter, Juanita Cruz. Don’t miss the bloody
traje de luces, or suit of lights, that the legendary Manolete was wearing
when he was gored to death. If that sounds like fun, you can visit the
museum, but you’re not allowed inside the actual Plaza de Toros.
To see the bullring, visit during bullfighting season (May–Oct) and choose
either a sol (sun) or sombra (shadows) seat. A word of advice: Spring for
the more expensive sombra seat. You can roast like a suckling pig in the
sol. For tickets to bullfights (which range from 4€–115€, or $4.80–$138), go
to the ticket booth at the Plaza de Toros de la Venta, call % 91-356-22-00

Puerta del Sol
Viejo Madrid
The focal point of Viejo Madrid, this noisy and chaotic square is the heart
that pumps shoppers, tourists, and traffic out to the smaller arteries of
the city. Although it’s not particularly distinguished in appearance, it is an
essential feature of Madrid. Originally part of a wall that encased the Old
Quarter, the Puerta del Sol (Gateway to the Sun) is Spain’s ground zero; a
marker indicates the square as the point from which all road distances in
Spain are measured. One of the best-known buildings in Madrid is the Casa
de Correos (the original Post Office), built in 1768 by a French architect.
A clock tower that was added in the 19th century tops it. The Puerta del
Sol was the scene of many historical events, including an 1808 uprising
against Napoleon in the War of Independence, an episode documented in
Francisco de Goya’s great and harrowing painting, Dos de Mayo (which
now hangs in the Prado).
To get to the Puerta del Sol, just take any Metro line to the Sol station (yellow, blue,
and brown lines all go there); you’ll exit the subway in the midst of the large, bustling
plaza.
More cool things to see and do
Madrid’s collection of smaller and lesser-known, but still excellent, muse-
ums and atmospheric strolling grounds are well worth your time if you’ve
got a few extra days in the city.

Sampling some smaller museums
If the crowds at the Prado and Thyssen get you down, sample some of
Madrid’s smaller museums, great in their own right but just off the prime
tourism circuit (literally and figuratively). Not only are these terrific art
collections, but they’re also your ticket to glorious Madrileño mansions
and palaces.
 Visiting the Museo Lázaro Galdiano. Serrano 122 (% 91-561-60-84;
www.flg.es/museo/museo.htm; Metro: Rubén Darío or Núñez de
Balboa). This recently renovated museum is a quietly spectacular
surprise. One of Madrid’s finest museums, though unknown to
many, it’s housed in an immaculate 19th-century mansion in one 
of the city’s newer northern neighborhoods. The superb private
collection includes European Old Masters and applied arts from
ancient times to the 19th century. You find lesser-known Goyas
(from his black period); works by El Greco, Velázquez, Zurbarán,
Ribera, and Murillo; Limoges enamels, and Renaissance jewelry. The
museum is open Wednesday to Monday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
and closed holidays and the month of August; admission is 4€
($4.80) for adults, 3€ ($3.60) for seniors and students, but it’s free
on Wednesdays for E.U. citizens. (See the “Madrid Accommodations,
Dining, and Attractions” map on p. 276 for more information.)
 Exploring Museo Sorolla. General Martínez Campos 37 (% 91-310-
15-84; http://museosorolla.mcu.es; Metro: Iglesia or Rubén
Darío). Check out the former studio and mansion of the celebrated
Impressionist Joaquín Sorolla, who lived there in the early 1900s —
it looks as if the painter and his family left last week. The home is
crammed with objects that the artist collected in his lifetime, as
well as a generous selection of his works, including the luminous
Mediterranean beach scenes for which he’s best known (Sorolla was
known as the painter of light). The museum is north of downtown,
not far from Paseo de la Castellana. Free guided tours (in Spanish
only) are available October through June. The museum, recently
renovated, is open Tuesday and Thursday through Saturday from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Wednesday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; admission is 2.40€ ($2.90) for adults, 1.20€
($1.45) for students, free admission for seniors, and free for every-
one on Sunday. (See the “Madrid Accommodations, Dining, and
Attractions” map on p. 276 for more information.)
Milling around Viejo Madrid
One of the best ways to absorb the flavor of Madrid is to stroll the
atmospheric streets of the Old City, where you uncover remnants of
medieval Madrid and the city later built by the Habsburgs. A good place
to start is in the Plaza Mayor (see “Madrid’s classic corners,” earlier in
this chapter). Cava de San Miguel, which you reach through the Arco de
Cuchilleros, is a lively strip of mesones (cavelike restaurants) and tav-
erns. Along Calle Mayor is Plaza de la Villa, Madrid’s old town square.
The cluster of handsome buildings dates to the 15th and 16th centuries.
Chapter 13: Madrid 297

The oldest structure is the Torre de los Lujanes, a mudéjar (Moorish
and Christian architectural mix) construction with a tall, minaretlike
structure. Casa de la Villa, on the opposite side of the plaza, was built in
1640 and once housed both the town hall and city jail. Casa de Cisneros
is a reconstructed 16th-century palace with a splendid Plateresque
facade.
South of the plaza, beyond Calle Segovia, is Plaza de la Paja, a pretty
and quiet space that was medieval Madrid’s commercial center. On this
plaza is Madrid’s only Gothic building, the Capilla del Obispo (Bishop’s
Chapel). Nearby is the Moorish-looking 14th-century San Pedro church.
Just east is a jumble of some of Madrid’s most animated streets: Cava
Baja, Cava Alta, Almendro, and Calle del Nuncio. Just about every
address in this district, called La Latina, houses an appealing old tavern
or tasca. The barrio is one of Madrid’s classic, working-class areas. The
popular El Rastro Fleamarket (see “Shopping in Madrid,” later in this
chapter) is held every Sunday along the warren of streets near Calle de
Toledo, a lively thoroughfare that leads back up to the Plaza Mayor.
Getting all turned around in Viejo Madrid is easy, so don’t get frustrated.
The many taverns along the way make great pit stops for map study. 
Or, just stop in for a beer, and while you’re there, ask the bartender or
patrons for some assistance.
Drinking in the best of Bourbon Madrid
Spain’s “Art Avenue,” Paseo del Prado, was the central axis of the
Bourbon monarchs’ royal expansion plan for the city. It was designed 
to be the center of arts and sciences (in fact, the Prado was originally
scheduled to be a national science museum). Besides connecting
Madrid’s principal art museums (the Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and
Reina Sofía), the leafy promenade, which a fountain of Neptune bisects,
hosts beautiful 19th-century palaces and apartment buildings. North of
the Prado, at Calle Alcalá, is Plaza de Cibeles, crowned by the ornate
fountain of the Roman goddess Cybele, one of the city’s most famous
monuments. When fútbol fans get crazy after major wins, they usually
wind up in Cybele’s lap — and she never seems to mind. Two great
buildings frame the Plaza: the Palacio de Comunicaciones (Main Post
Office) on the Prado side, and Banco de España across the way.
Carlos III, continuing his makeover of Madrid, constructed the Puerta de
Alcalá, gateway to the city. In the 18th century, it marked the eastern
border, but of course the city kept growing and growing. Today the mas-
sive granite monument’s five arches are more like doors in the middle of
a living room.
Making the most of Modern Madrid
Upper-crust 19th-century apartment buildings and tonier-than-tú shops
line Madrid’s chicest neighborhood, Barrio de Salamanca. It extends
from Puerta de Alcalá to Calle Ortega y Gasset and from Serrano to Plaza

de Roma. If those euros are burning holes in your pockets, join the ele-
gant señoras on their daily rounds of the barrio’s antiques shops, fashion
boutiques, and art galleries. Calle Serrano is the best street for a stroll.
Digging up some fun
Madrid’s massive Museo Arqueológico Nacional (National Archaeology
Museum), Serrano 13 (% 91-557-79-12; http://man.mcu.es), is most
notable for its cool replica of Spain’s Altamira caves, festooned with pre-
historic paintings of bison (a great place to duck in out of the summer
sun) and the fourth-century B.C. Iberian bust of La Dama de Elche. The
museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
and Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; admission is 3€ ($3.60), but it’s
free Saturday starting at 2:30 p.m. and all day Sunday. (See the “Madrid
Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions” map on p. 276 for more 
information.)
Strolling along Paseo de la Castellana
A continuation of Paseo del Prado, this tree-lined promenade stretches
from Plaza de Colón way out to Madrid’s new northern neighborhoods. A
prime strolling ground, Paseo de la Castellana explodes in summer with
stylish outdoor terrace cafes and bars. If you want to join the parade, or
paseo, of beautiful people and Spanish-style “yoopies” (yuppies), grab
your cigs and nonchalantly toss a sweater accessory around your neck,
but don’t dare show up before 11 p.m. Unless you’re a real night owl, the
copas (cocktails) crowd will stay here way past your bedtime.
Missing Madrid’s busiest artery, Gran Vía, is nearly impossible, if for no
other reason than your hotel is likely to be on or near it. Bursting with a
dazzling collage of cinemas, shops, hotels, strip shows, and neon and
bright lights, the section from Plaza de Callao to Plaza de España is
Madrid’s Broadway. Frenetic and slightly seedy, it offers few if any clas-
sic sights, though it’s a sight in itself. In the center of Plaza de España 
is a statue of Cervantes and his beloved characters, Don Quixote and
Sancho Panza.
Taking the kids to the parks
North of the Royal Palace, the nicely landscaped Parque del Oeste
(West Park) extends along the River Manzanares. Young fans of the
movie The Mummy will enjoy the park’s most attention-getting feature,
the Templo de Debod (% 91-765-10-08; www.munimadrid.es/templo
debod; see the “Madrid Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions” map
on p. 276 for more information) a fourth-century B.C. Egyptian temple
that once stood next to the Nile. Adults, however, may think it odd to
find such a thing marooned in the middle of Madrid. When the Aswan
Dam flooded, a group of Spanish engineers rescued the temple; the
Egyptian government thanked them by donating the structure to Spain.
Admission is free. An aerial cable car connects Parque del Oeste to 
Casa de Campo, a 4,000-acre expanse of green, formerly royal hunting
Chapter 13: Madrid 299

grounds. You can also reach the park by getting off at the Lago or Batán
Metro stops (see the “Madrid Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions”
map on p. 276 for more information). The park — now christened Parque
de Atracciones Madrid — contains a lake (with rowboats), a pretty
decent zoo, and theme park. It’s a great place to take the kids if they (or
you) tire of museums. The theme park (% 91-526-80-31; www.
parquedeatracciones.es) is open daily from noon to 10 p.m., and
admission is 24€ adults ($30), 14€ ($17) seniors and children. You can
also opt to pay 7€ ($8.40) just to enter. The Zoo-Aquárium de Madrid
(% 91-512-37-70; www.zoomadrid.com) is open daily from 10:30 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. in summer (though it closes at 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. in other
months), and admission is 15€ ($18) for adults, 12€ ($14) for seniors
and children under age 8. Kids will especially like taking the teleférico
(aerial cable car, % 91-541-74-50) there. The ride is 4.80€ ($5.80) round-
trip; catch it at the corner of Pintor Rosales and Marqués de Urquijo
(Metro: Argüelles). The cable car runs daily from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. March
through October, and from November through February it runs only on
weekends from noon to 9 p.m.
Yet another cultural invasion of Europe that surely has some locals wring-
ing their hands, Warner Bros. Movie World, a Hollywood theme park, has
landed in Madrid. With Cartoon World, a Tom and Jerry roller coaster,
Super Heroes World, and a slice of the Old West, the new park is dream-
land for some families, though it may not be what you envisioned for a
visit to Spain. Movie World is located outside of Madrid, on N-IV Km 22, 
in San Martín de la Vega (% 902-024-100; www.warnerbrospark.com).
Admission is 32€ ($38) for adults and 24€ ($29) for children younger than
12 and seniors; look for 15-percent-off coupons in tourist publications and
in tourist information offices. La Veloz bus no. 416 goes to the park, leav-
ing from Estación Sur de Autobuses.
Guided Tours
Sometimes the most hassle-free way to see a city in a short period of
time is on a guided tour. If you don’t have much time and want someone
else to worry about getting around, the following tours can give you a
good overview of the city.
Bus tours
Madrid Visión operates multilanguage city bus tours (with headsets) of
“Historic Madrid” and “Modern Madrid.” Lasting about 75 minutes, they
depart from Gran Vía 32, but you can get on or hop off anywhere along
their route. The cost for one day is 15€ ($18) for adults and 8€ ($10), for
seniors and children age 7 to 16; two-day tickets are 19€ ($24) for adults
and 10€ ($12) for seniors and children ages 7 to 16; admission is free
with purchase of the Madrid Card. For more information, call % 91-779-
18-88 or visit www.madridvision.es (discounts available for online
purchase).

Walking tours
The Patronato Municipal de Turismo (City Tourism Office) offers an
extensive series of Descubre Madrid (Discover Madrid) walks — guided
historical and cultural tours of the city — throughout the year, though
the schedule is heaviest in summer months. Tours depart from the main
tourism office at Plaza Mayor 3. Inquire at any tourism office about 
the program and scheduled visits or call % 91-588-16-36 or visit www.
descubremadrid.com. Advance booking (a good idea in summer
months) is possible by calling % 902-22-16-22. Most tours cost 4€
($4.80) for adults and 3€ ($3.60) for children ages 4 through 12.
Suggested itineraries
If you’d rather organize your own tours, this section offers some tips for
building your own Madrid itineraries.
If you have one day
Begin your day exploring the artistic treasures of the Prado Museum —
which should hold you for several hours, at least until lunchtime. Eat a
light lunch at the Museo del Jamón on Paseo del Prado before jogging
around the corner to pay homage to Picasso’s Guernica in the Centro de
Arte Reina Sofía. That and the other modern masters will keep your
attention for a couple of hours more, after which it will be time to head
back to your hotel for a well-earned siesta.
Make sure you take the time to walk through the Plaza Mayor at the
heart of town, perhaps just before setting off on your tapeo in the early
evening. This stroll through the heart of Old Madrid — from tapas bar 
to tapas bar, nibbling and imbibing along the way — should last from
around 6 to 8 p.m. Head back to your hotel to rest up until 9:30 p.m. or
so, when you can safely venture out for dinner at Botín.
If you have two days
Spend day one pretty much as outlined above. Start off day two touring
the Palacio Royal. Afterward, head to the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum
to see how serious money and a penchant for art can grow a private 
collection.
If these two days in Madrid represent the full extent of your time in
Spain — and if it’s the proper season — try to take in a bullfight at 5 p.m.
If it’s not bullfighting season, tapeo again this evening. Either way, catch
a flamenco show in the later evening (after dinner).
If you have three days
Spend day one and day two as outlined in the preceding sections, then
head off on day three for a day trip to Toledo, a commanding hilltop
town that was once the capital of Spain, home to Christians, Moors, and
Jews, and also the adopted city of the Renaissance master El Greco.
Chapter 13: Madrid 301

Shopping the Local Stores
Madrid is where plenty of Spaniards from around the country go to spend
their money (much the way Brits go to London to shop and Americans
stock up in New York). As Spain’s largest city, Madrid has more of every-
thing, from the chicest designer clothing stores to a healthy supply of all
the regional handicrafts you find (usually at cheaper prices) throughout
Spain. For my money, though, Barcelona’s a more interesting shopping
destination, with its design- and fashion-heavy orientation. (See Chap-
ter 10 for more on Barcelona.)
Madrid’s best shopping areas
The old center, near Puerta del Sol, especially the pedestrian-only
streets Preciados and del Carmen, is a dense concentration of shops 
of all kinds — from little mom-and-pop places to the mega-department
stores found in all major cities. Waves of souvenir shops and others sell-
ing affordable silver and jewelry surround Plaza Mayor. The glamour of
Gran Vía, once Madrid’s most exclusive shopping avenue, has given way
to more utilitarian stores, selling fashions, shoes, books, and specialty
foods and wines. Just north of Plaza de España, Calle Princesa is a main
shopping drag with a little bit of everything, but mostly clothing and
shoe stores. Mercado Puerta de Toledo, south of Plaza Mayor, used to
be the old fish market, but it has been recast as a slick shopping center,
with a full catch of restaurants, boutiques, and antiques stores. Barrio
Salamanca, just north of Retiro Park and east of Paseo de la Castellana,
ought to have a doorman at the entrance. This elite district is home to
Madrid’s most upscale boutiques. If you want the latest and chicest in
designer wear, jewelry, and home furnishings, and you don’t need to ask
the price, check out Calles Goya and Serrano and the small streets that
feed into them. Calle Claudio de Coello has some of the best art and
antiques dealers.
If you’re shopping with a mission, you need to plan your attack around
Spanish shopping hours, which for the most part continue to respect the
midday lunch closing (with a few exceptions, only malls stay open all
day). Shop hours are generally Monday through Friday from 9 or (more
likely) 10 a.m. to 1:30 or 2 p.m., and 4 or (more likely) 5 to 8 p.m. On
Saturdays, they’re open from 9:30 a.m. or so to 1:30 p.m. On Sundays,
even compulsive shoppers have to take the day off.
What to look for and where to find it
In Spain, the law coordinates sales, with twice-annual sell-offs of inven-
tory that all begin at the same time: the second week of January and the
last week of July. Signs announcing rebajas (sales or rebates) are plas-
tered over store windows. Prices continue to drop when stores move
from first to second and final sales.
From antiques to wine, you’ll find no shortage of ways to spend your
money in Madrid. The following stores are some of my favorites.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
302

Antiques
Check out El Rastro, the flea market for odds-and-ends, on Sunday morn-
ings (see the sidebar, “Run to El Rastro” for more information). Calle de
las Huertas is also a good area to conduct your hunt. At Centro de Arte
y Antiguedades, Serrano 5 (% 91-576-96-82; Metro: Serrano), you find a
number of dealers under one roof (of an attractive old building), some
with very fine and very unusual items.
Books
Between the Atocha Train Station and the Botanical Gardens, just east 
of Paseo del Prado, is a weekend open-air book fair, with new, used, and
rare books for sale. If you’re in Madrid at the end of May or beginning 
of June, check out the Feria del Libro de Madrid (Madrid Book Fair),
which virtually takes over Retiro Park.
Crisol is a bookstore chain with numerous outlets across the city; they
have a decent selection of books in English. Among their branches: Paseo
de la Castellana 90 (% 91-344-09-67; Metro: Colón), and Goya 18 (% 91-
575-06-40; Metro: Goya). VIPS is an all-purpose chain that often heavily
discounts art and architecture books (in both Spanish and English). VIPS
stores are seemingly everywhere; one is at Gran Vía 43 (% 91-599-66-21;
Metro: Gran Vía); other branches are at Serrano 41; Princesa 5; and
Velázquez 136. Petra’s International Bookshop, Campomanes 13 (% 91-
541-72-91; Metro: Santo Domingo), specializes in second-hand books in
English and other languages. It will also buy and trade. A great bookstore
focusing exclusively on cinematic arts is 81⁄2, named for Fellini’s classic
film, at Martín de los Heros 23 (% 91-559-06-28).
Crafts
Artespaña, Hermosilla 14 (% 91-435-02-21; Metro: Serrano) is a govern-
ment-run store with a large selection of crafts, especially items for the
home. El Arco de los Cuchilleros Artesanía de Hoy, in the Plaza Mayor,
no. 9 (% 91-365-26-80; Metro: Sol), may be a mouthful, but it’s also,
Chapter 13: Madrid 303
Run to (or from?) El Rastro
Even if you’re not a shopper, you probably won’t want to miss El Rastro, the best-known
flea market in Spain, located south of the Plaza Mayor in La Latina district. Every
Sunday, the unruly market spills over from the long and narrow Calle Ribera de
Curtidores into several adjacent streets. Once mostly an antiques market, today it has
fewer rarities and more run-of-the-mill items: clothing, jewelry, art, animals (!), and,
of course, monumental piles of junk. A lot of jostling goes on, and pickpockets know
it’s one of their best chances to target tourists. El Rastro is officially open Sundays
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., but many sellers take off by midafternoon (you’ll also find plenty
of activity on Fri and Sat). To get there, take the Metro to the La Latina stop.

hands down, the best place to go for crafts from all over Spain. From
Spanish fans to embroidered shawls, jewelry, hand-blown glass, and
ceramics, you’ll find it here — as well as a staff that speaks English. Check
out the enormous selection of hand-painted ceramics at Antigua Casa
Talavera, Isabel la Católica 2 (% 91-547-34-17; Metro: Santo Domingo),
including attractive pieces from Valencia and Talavera, and tiles.
Department stores
FNAC, Preciados 28 (% 91-595-61-00; Metro: Santo Domingo), is a
French store, specializing in books, music, and magazines, and it offers
occasional in-store performances. The granddaddy of Spanish depart-
ment stores, with an encyclopedic inventory, is El Corte Inglés,
Preciados 3 (% 91-379-80-00; Metro: Callao or Sol).
Fashion
The ubiquitous Adolfo Domínguez, Serrano 18 (% 91-577-82-80; Metro:
Serrano), from Galicia, is one of Spain’s top designers for both men and
women. His stores are elegant, but not ridiculously expensive. Loewe,
Gran Vía 8, and Serrano 26 (% 91-577-60-56; Metro: Gran Vía and
Serrano), a leather heaven since 1846, is the quintessential Spanish
luxury clothier with great luggage and handbags.
More adventurous Spanish designers include Agata Ruiz de la Prada,
Marqués de Riscal 8 (% 91-310-44-83; Metro: Rubén Darío); Antonio
Miró, Lagasca 65 (% 91-426-02-25; Metro: Velázquez); and Purificación
García, Serrano 28 (% 91-577-83-70; Metro: Serrano/Colón). Adorable
and hip T-shirts, for both adults and kids, are sold at El Tintero, 
Gravina 5 (% 91-308-14-18), near the Plaza in Chueca.
For the budget-minded, Zara has hip but surprisingly affordable fashions
for both sexes. Look carefully at materials and washing instructions,
though, because some pieces aren’t so durable. The store boasts two
branches, at Hermosilla 16 (% 91-575-64-45; Metro: Serrano) and Gran
Vía 32 (% 91-522-97-27; Metro: Gran Vía).
Gifts
If you or your family and friends are fans of Lladró, the famous Spanish
porcelain figures, you can pick them up at the source, Lladró Tienda
Madrid, Serrano 68 (% 91-247-71-47; Metro: Serrano). Sefarad, Gran Vía
54 (% 91-547-61-42; Metro: Sevilla), specializes in Lladró and Majorca
faux pearls. With an incredible selection of hats (many very imaginative)
and souvenir items (such as swords and shields), Casa Yusta, Plaza
Mayor 30 (% 91-366-50-84; Metro: Sol), has protected heads for more
than a century.
Fans, those elegant accessory items that no stylish Spanish woman is
without, make great gifts, but if you’re in Madrid in summer, buying one
for yourself is wise. Casa de Diego, Puerta del Sol 12 (% 91-522-66-43;
Metro: Sol), has more fans than you’ve probably ever seen, from cheap
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
304

to exotic, and a good selection of shawls, too. If you’re a really big fan 
of fans, you can find even more of them at Almoraima, Plaza Mayor 12
(% 91-365-42-89; Metro: Sol). Excellent Spanish shawls are available at
Casa Jiménez, Preciados 42 (% 91-548-05-26; Metro: Sol).
Malls
You find nearly 100 shops, featuring fashions, jewelry, and household
items, and a spate of restaurants at ABC Serrano, Serrano 61 (% 91-
577-50-31; Metro: Serrano), a magnificently restored 19th-century build-
ing where the daily newspaper ABC was produced.
Serious shoppers should check out the discounts at Las Rozas Village,
Juan Ramon Jimenez, s/n, in Las Rozas, about 20 minutes outside of
Madrid (% 91-640-49-00), on the way to El Escorial and Segovia. The 
40-plus stores include Antonio Miro, Camper, Gianfranco Ferre, Levi’s,
Lottusse, TAG Heuer, and Timberland. The mall is located at Exit 19 
off A-6.
Shoes
Try some shoes on for size at Yanko, Gran Vía 40 (% 91-532-08-20;
Metro: Gran Vía), a top Spanish shoemaker for both sexes. Calzados
Bravo has a nice selection of shoes for men and women, as well as lug-
gage. Look for branches at Gran Vía 31 and 68; Princesa 58; and Goya 43
(% 91-222-73-00; Metro: Gran Vía or Goya). You can find the latest
models of trendy but cool Camper shoes, which are made in Spain, at
their shop at Preciados 23 (% 91-531-78-97).
Wine and cheese
Palacio de los Quesos, Calle Mayor 53 (% 91-548-16-23; Metro: Sol), has
everything you want in Spanish cheeses and wines, as well as turrón (a
hard candy) and marzipan, which Spaniards are nuts about. Majorca,
Velázquez 59 (% 91-431-99-09; Metro: Velázquez), is another great gour-
met shop, where you can eat as well as pick up Spanish wines for friends
back home.
Living It Up After Dark: Madrid’s 
Nonstop Nightlife
Madrid swings like no other city in Spain (or in Europe, for that matter).
Madrileños pride themselves on how much they can party and how late
they can go — when they sleep is anyone’s guess. In the nightlife and
cultural capital of Spain, you can find dozens of theaters and concert
halls offering classical music, dance, and Spanish zarzuela (light comic
opera), as well as hundreds of wild discos and the entire spectrum of
jazz, rock, alternative, and pop clubs. On top of that, you can enjoy fla-
menco shows — some about as authentic as you come across in Spain
Chapter 13: Madrid 305

and others targeted strictly at tourists — and everyone’s favorite night-
time activity, tapas bar-hopping, which is raised to an art form in Madrid.
The night begins and ends late. In Madrid, the afternoon extends to 8 or
9 p.m., and the language reflects that; when Madrileños greet someone
at that hour, they say buenas tardes (good afternoon), not buenas noches
(good evening). Night doesn’t really begin until after dinner, and remem-
ber that dinner can begin at 11:30 p.m. or midnight on weekends.
For up-to-date listings on what’s happening in Madrid, get your hands 
on the weekly Guía del Ocio, available at newsstands (it has an English-
language section of current events and exhibitions at the back), or the
Friday editions of El Mundo or El País. For cultural questions of inter-
est to tourists, call % 91-540-40-10. For information on clubs, discos,
and concerts, as well as art exhibits, pick up a free copy of In Madrid, a
monthly digest of happenings in Madrid.
Tickets for some venues are available only at their box offices. For tickets
to most other cultural events, including bullfights and soccer matches,
contact Localidades García, Plaza del Carmen 1 (% 91-531-27-32), or
TEYCI, Calle Goya 7 (% 91-576-45-32). Corte Inglés (% 91-432-93-00)
stores around the city also sell tickets to concerts. You can also call Caja
Madrid (% 902-48-84-88) and Caixa de Cataluña (% 902-10-12-12) for
theater and movie tickets.
Tavern and tapas crawls
Since the first little wine shacks opened on “Little Taverns” street in
medieval Madrid, locals have incorporated tavern hopping into their
daily routines. Trolling the old town’s innumerable taverns is one of the
highpoints of visiting Madrid. Tavernas and mesones (both names to
describe very similar tapas bars) are places to knock back small glasses
of red wine, beer, or sherry, mix with boisterous company, and stave off
a real meal with an assortment of tapas. Tapas come from the Spanish
word tapar, meaning to cover.
In most places, you’re given small snacks, or tapitas — olives, mussels,
cheese, spicy potatoes, or chorizo (Spanish sausage) — as a bonus with
your drink order. You can always order a more substantial tapa or ración
(full serving). The idea is to pop in, stand at the bar, down a couple of
shooters, offer a couple of unsolicited opinions on politics or soccer,
and move on to the next place. Your visit can be a pit stop before head-
ing home or on to a restaurant for dinner, or you can make it an all-night,
increasingly loud, and loose endeavor.
The best areas are around the Plaza de Santa Ana, Plaza Mayor, and
the Latina/Lavapies neighborhoods, especially the Cava Baja and Cava
Alta streets. Madrid is swimming with tascas and tavernas, so what fol-
lows is an abbreviated list of places to check out. So many are available;
don’t be afraid to pop in wherever folks are drinking and eating.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
306

La Latina/Lavapies District (Metro: La Latina)
More than 200 years old, and a classic of bullfighting ambience, Taberna
de Antonio Sánchez, Mesón de Paredes 13 (% 91-539-78-26), is as
authentic as they come. It may be the oldest tavern in Madrid. Taberna
Tempranillo, Cava Baja 38 (% 91-364-15-32), is a friendly brick bar lined
with wine racks (it has an amazing wine list). Located on one of Madrid’s
most frenetic tapas streets, it looks much more lived in than it is.
Nearby, Almendro 13 (% 91-365-42-52), named for its address on the
bend in the road, is hugely popular and a good spot for a cold sherry
served from black bottles (but it closes early — at midnight), as is La
Carpanta, Almendro 22 (% 91-366-57-83). The name Taberna de Cien
Vinos, Calle del Nuncio 17 (% 91-365-47-04), means tavern of 100 wines,
but it offers much more than that, including some great tapas, such as
roast beef and salt cod. Casa Antonio, Latoneros 10 (% 91-429-93-56), is
a Madrid classic with a zinc bar, Moorish tiles, and bright red doors. On
nice days, the doors are flung open and people spill out into the pedes-
trian street.
Santa Ana/Huertas District (Metro: Sol/Antón Martín)
You find an excellent assortment of tapas, such as anchovies and home-
made canapés, at the very traditional, tile-lined Taberna de Dolores,
Plaza Jesús 4 (% 91-429-22-43; Metro: Banco de Sevilla). España Cañí,
Plaza del Angel 14 (no phone), a funky little tavern just a short distance
from Plaza de Santa Ana, is modern, with flamenco on the sound system.
Sit at the bar and have a caña (small draft beer) and a tapa of chorizo
infierno (literally, “hell’s hot sausage”) or salmorejo, a gazpacholike cold
Chapter 13: Madrid 307
Tavern and tapas talk
Tapas are small snacks served on saucer plates. The word tapa comes from tapar, lit-
erally “to cover”; similar saucers were once used to cover the opening of drinks (pre-
sumably, to protect them from bacteria and other unfriendly aerial elements); today
the term is generic for snack. The art of moving from one bar to another in search of
snacks — the art of Spanish grazing — is called a tapeo.
All you need to make your way around a tavern or tapas bar is the briefest of Spanish
vocabularies — and you may not even need that, because bartenders usually have
few problems with the English words for beer and wine. Accompanying your requests
with por favor (please) goes a long way to getting what you want.
A beer is una cerveza (oo-nah thehr-beh-thah) or una caña (oo-nah cah-nyah), a draft.
Un vino tinto is a glass of red wine. White wine is vino blanco. If you want to try a
famous Spanish sherry, ask for un jerez (oon heh-reth). A dry sherry is simply un fino.
And when you’re ready to move on and want the check, say ¿Me cobra, por favor?
(meh koh-brah, pohr fah-vohr). You may or may not get a cash-register receipt.

soup native to Córdoba. Casa Alberto, Calle de las Huertas 18 (% 91-
429-93-56; Metro: Antón Martín), an 1827 taberna with a front tapas bar
and charming little restaurant in back, is a classic: Don Quixote’s creator,
Cervantes, once lived at this address.
Plaza Mayor (Metro: Sol)
The row of cavelike bars built right into the wall along Cava San Miguel
outside the Plaza Mayor transport the 18th century to the present (or
you back to the 18th century). Though tapas bars are quiet early in the
evening, they get steadily more raucous as the night wears on. Most fea-
ture a guitar player or two and alcohol-fueled singalongs. The house spe-
cialty at Mesón del Champigñón, Cava de San Miguel 17 (% 91-559-67-
90), is as the name implies: garlicky mushrooms that are stuffed, grilled,
salted, you name it. Mesón de la Guitarra, Cava de San Miguel 13 
(% 91-559-95-31; Metro: Sol), is named for the ever-present Spanish
guitar. This tavern is what you expect to find in Madrid; it’s almost
always hopping with boisterous patrons, and wine and song flow freely.
Chueca District (Metro: Chueca)
This young and hip barrio has plenty of cool places to go out, but my
favorite continues to be Taberna Angel Sierra, Gravina 11, on the Plaza
de Chueca (no phone). With no tables, patrons either saddle up to the
fantastic old zinc bar for a glass of vermut (vermouth) or spill out onto
the street and square. Another good spot, with more than 100 tapas
served, is Santander, Augusto Figueroa 25 (% 91-522-49-10).
Flamenco music and dancing
Flamenco is as identifiably Spanish as bullfights and the glorious Iberian
sun, so it’s only natural that most visitors arrive in Madrid determined
to see an authentic flamenco show, called a tablao. Flamenco may have
been born in Andalusia, but some (or most) of its greatest practitioners
reside in Madrid. Many shows are firmly directed at tourists, but that
doesn’t mean they’re kitschy productions. The quality of dancing is gen-
erally excellent.
Several of Madrid’s flamenco shows offer dinner-theater options, but
you’re better off eating at a real restaurant first and suffering only the
cover and drink minimum (generally 23€–32€/$28–$38). Dinner is far
from their top priority, but the clubs tend to charge as if they were serv-
ing the choicest gourmet meals (around 50€/$60 and up). The shows
start late (generally around 11 p.m.), so you can easily get dinner else-
where first.
Café de Chinitas, Calle Torija 7 (% 91-559-51-35; Metro: Santo
Domingo), in an 18th-century palace, is perhaps the best known of the
Madrid clubs aimed at tourists, with excellent shows and costumes. It’s
been around for three decades and drawn such internationally known
figures as Lady Di and President Bill Clinton. Shows begin at 10:30 p.m.

every night but Sunday. Reservations are essential. One of the liveliest
places in town, and around since 1956, the Corral de la Morería, Calle
Morería 7 (% 91-365-84-46; Metro: La Latina), schedules good and slick,
but not touristy, flamenco troupes and has entertained plenty of big-
wigs. It’s open every night of the week.
Casa Patas, Cañizares 10 (% 91-369-04-96; Metro: Tirso de Molina), dou-
bles as a tavern and restaurant, with flamenco shows at the back. Shows
run Monday to Thursday at 10:30 p.m., and Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m.
with another show at midnight (closed Sun). Shows here are less glitzy,
more intimate, and more affordable than at most other clubs, but they
still have attracted celebs on the order of Johnny Depp and Naomi
Campbell.
Candela, Olmo 2 (% 91-527-35-94; Metro: Antón Martín), and Caracol,
Bernardino Obregón 18 (% 91-530-80-55; Metro: Embajadores), are both
popular bars with flamenco music and dance; some of Madrid’s finest
performers have been known to show up. Equally authentic, and a heck
of a lot of fun, is La Soleá, Cava Baja 34 (% 91-365-33-08; Metro: La
Latina), an informal bar best known for its genuinely participatory
nightly shows.
If you can’t stop stomping your heels after seeing a flamenco show, you
can sign up for a class in flamenco and sevillanas (popular folk dances
similar to but less formal than flamenco); several spots in Madrid offer
flamenco classes for locals and foreigners. Try Escuela El Tablao, Santa
Polonia 9 (% 91-429-22-17), or check the ads for private tutors in the
Guía del Ocio. Fans of flamenco who are in Madrid the last week of June
and during the month of July also need to check out the Summer
Flamenco Festival, with major scheduled performances at the Teatro
Real and elsewhere. See www.teatro-real.com or www.madrid.org for
more information and a current schedule of events.
Bars and pubs
Two areas thick with back-to-back bars and cafes, many appealing to 
the young and rowdy, are Calle de las Huertas (Metro: Antón Martín),
between the Plaza Mayor and Paseo del Prado, and the area around
Plaza Dos de Mayo, in the Malasaña district (Metro: Tribunal). Plaza de
Santa Ana (Metro: Sol or Antón Martín) is also extremely lively and flush
with barhoppers most nights of the week.
Bar Cock, Calle de la Reina 16 (% 91-532-28-26; Metro: Gran Vía or
Banco de España), is a stylishly understated, urbane, and smoky place
that features high ceilings and high-priced cocktails. It seems to attract a
disproportionate number of models, actors, and public-relations sorts.
Another chic hangout is Teatriz, Hermosilla 15 (% 91-577-53-79; Metro:
Velázquez), a former theater turned restaurant and bar. The attention-
demanding decor is the work of design guru Philippe Starck. With a cool
1930s look, Chicote, Gran Vía 12 (% 91-532-67-37; Metro: Gran Vía), is
one of Madrid’s enduring classics, and one of its most famous cocktail
Chapter 13: Madrid 309

bars. Hemingway dug it; he and many other writers and artists drank
here often in pre–Spanish Civil War days. The waiters are extraordinarily
genteel — and they should be, given the high price of the drinks.
Cervecería Alemana, Plaza de Santa Ana 6 (% 91-429-70-33; Metro: Sol
or Antón Martín), is a simple beer hall with a young, cheerful crowd.
Elaborately tiled Los Gabrieles, Echegaray 17 (% 91-429-62-61; Metro:
Tirso de Molina), brings the flavors and sounds of Andalusia to Madrid.
In a neighborhood thick with bars, its cellar once housed a bordello. An
intimate spot just off the Plaza Mayor, specializing in hard-to-find Belgian
beers, is Cafeeke, Cuchilleros 3 (% 91-366-98-42). Down the street from
two of Madrid’s most popular versión original (original language, or sub-
titled) cinemas are El Plaza, Martín de los Heros 3 (% 91-548-84-88),
and El Café des las Estrellas, Martín de los Heros 5 (% 91-542-16-30),
popular with cinefiles searching out the latest movies. The Metro stop
for both is Plaza de España.
Cafes and terrazas
Outdoor cafes and bars are a Spanish specialty and most Madrileños
love this opportunity to talk loudly, gesticulate with abandon, and check
out the flow of people strutting their stuff. Linger over a café or beer and
do the same (though you can keep gesticulations to a minimum if you
fear spilling your drink). Outdoor cafes are also a good option for non-
smokers, because, despite the recent laws designed to cut down on
public smoking, in many Madrid bars you may be the only one who’s not
lighting up.
Check out Plaza Mayor and Plaza Santa Ana for relaxed, traditional cafes
that get going in early evening. In the heat of summer, the terrazas
(open-air bars) along Paseo de Recoletos and Paseo de la Castellana
really sizzle. The famous Madrileño marcha, the all-night party, begins
at terrace cafes and then moves to the clubs and discos. If you want a
primer on the latest fashions favored by Madrid’s elite, just park your-
self at any of the bars under the trees and settle in as the parade begins.
For more relaxed, traditional cafes that get going in early evening, check
out Plaza Mayor and Plaza Santa Ana, or either of the following options.
Café Gijón, Paseo de Recoletos 21 (% 91-521-54-25; Metro: Banco de
España), is a revered institution (especially for the literary set) that
dates back to the late 19th century. And on historic Plaza de Oriente,
near the Royal Palace and Opera House, the Café de Oriente, Plaza de
Oriente 2 (% 91-541-39-74; Metro: Opera), stands, built on the remains
of a 17th-century convent. Sit in the palacelike interior or on the appetiz-
ing sidewalk terrace. If those cafes are too genteel for you, check out
Café Acuarela, Gravina 10 (% 91-522-21-43; Metro: Chueca), a dark and
smoky hipster cafe that serves teas from around the world and other
drinks amid religious art.

Live rhythms: Jazz, Latino, and rock
Live music in Madrid isn’t limited to flamenco. You’ll also find a bunch of
cool little clubs to hear live jazz and Latin music. Check out the follow-
ing clubs:
 Café Central, an attractive, sophisticated jazz cafe near Plaza de
Santa Ana, has nightly piano performances, jazz quartets, and the
occasional singer-songwriter. Plaza del Angel 10 (% 91-369-41-43;
Metro: Antón Martín).
 Populart is always packed and the bar schedules live performances
that range from jazz and blues to reggae and samba. Calle de las
Huertas 22 (% 91-429-84-07; Metro: Antón Martín).
 For alternative rock shows by Spanish bands, check out Siroco,
which rocks till 6 a.m. Thursday to Sunday. Calle San Dimas 3 
(% 91-593-30-70; Metro: Noviciado).
Disco fever
Discos are alive and well in Madrid, but they’re predominantly young
(very young), full-throttle affairs. The blinding lights and ear-splitting
sound systems don’t get cranking until midnight. And you’ve got to
show up (or still be there) at 3 a.m. if you want to see the action in full
swing. Most clubs have an admission charge of around $15 or $20, which
includes your first drink. Here are a few hot spots: The sleek Pacha, the
stylish Madrid incarnation of the famous chain that first struck a chord
in Ibiza, housed in a 1930s building; open Thursday through Saturday
from 2 to 5 a.m. (Barceló 11; % 91-446-01-28; Metro: Tribunal); the
sprawling, anything-goes, cross-cultural Kapital, Atocha 125 (% 91-
420-29-06); Palacio Gaviria, open daily, where you’ll find a wildly
Baroque 19th-century palace place and everything from over-the-top
disco to ballroom dancing and chic, secluded cocktail corners (Arenal 9;
% 91-526-60-69; Metro: Puerta del Sol); and Joy, open nightly, a loud
and in-your-face kind of place in the historic Teatro Eclava (Arenal 11; 
% 91-366-37-33; Metro: Sol).
Chapter 13: Madrid 311
Late-night munchies
In Madrid, the town that never wants to go to bed, an undying tradition is to top off 
the night (which is way into morning) with chocolate con churros. Churros are deep-
fried pieces of dough, served piping hot, accompanied by cups of thick, rich hot 
chocolate — for dunking, of course. Churrerías usually open around 4 a.m., perfect
for late-night partiers. A good place to add some much-needed grease and chocolate
to your predawn diet is at Churrería de San Ginés, on Pasadizo de San Ginés, between
Calle Mayor and Arenal.

Opera and classical music
Madrid’s performing arts companies — including the Ballet Nacional 
de España, Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid, and Orquesta Nacional de
España — are among the best not only in Spain but in all of Europe. Look
also for the world-famous flamenco troupe of Antonio Canales, Ballet
Flamenco Antonio Canales.
Madrid’s opera house, Teatro Real, Plaza Isabel II, s/n (Metro: Opera),
has had a tortured history of delays, interruptions, fires, and even a stint
as a gunpowder arsenal. Closed various times, but most recently from
1988 to 1997, it was finally rescued and given a state-of-the-art redesign.
You may quibble with the showy, nouveau-antique design — handsome
but cheesy faux-wood columns, for example — but you can’t argue with
the sophisticated stage technology.
Programs, which are extremely popular with Madrileños and visitors to
the city, have included biggies such as Carmen, La Bohème, Tosca, La
Traviata, and The Barber of Seville. Ballet (including the National Ballet of
Spain) and classical concerts are also held at the Teatro. For information,
visit the box office, call % 91-516-06-60, or visit www.teatro-real.com;
for tickets, call % 91-516-06-06. Advance tickets (highly suggested if 
you really want to see a program during your stay) are available online
or by calling % 902-24-48-48. The box office is open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 8 p.m. If there’s a perform-
ance on Sunday, the box office opens two hours before showtime (gener-
ally at 6 p.m.). Guided tours of the sleek opera house (in English if
there’s a large enough group) are held Tuesday through Friday at 1 p.m.
and Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Admission is 3€
($3.60) for adults or 1.80€ ($2.20) for children 7 to 14.
Opera takes the stage from January to July at the Auditorio Nacional de
Música, Príncipe de Vergara 146 (% 91-337-01-00; Metro: Cruz de Rayo);
they offer excellent classical music concerts from October to June. At
Teatro Calderón, Calle Atocha 18 (% 91-429-58-90; Metro: Tirso de
Molina), you can enjoy such well-known operas as Rossini’s The Barber
of Seville. A visit to Teatro Lírico Nacional de la Zarzuela, Jovellanos 4
(% 91-524-54-00; Metro: Banco de España), is a chance to see zarzuela,
the traditional form of light comic opera indigenous to Madrid. The
singing is in Spanish, but you needn’t know the language to enjoy the
show.
Theater and musicals
Madrid is the teatro (theater) capital of Spain, but, logically, nearly all
productions are in Spanish. If you don’t speak Spanish and wish to see
theater, you’re best off opting for a performance of zarzuela (light comic
opera), in which the language doesn’t much matter. For other theater
productions, you need to be relatively fluent in Spanish.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
312

Teatro Albéniz, Calle Paz 11 (% 91-531-83-11; Metro: Sevilla), has the-
ater as well as dance and an occasional zarzuela. The Teatro Nuevo
Apolo, Plaza de Tirso de Molina 1 (% 91-369-06-37; Metro: Tirso de
Molina), often presents popular international musicals, such as Chicago.
Teatro Español, Príncipe 25 (% 91-360-14-80; Metro: Sol), the municipal
Spanish theater program, offers a wide variety of Spanish plays.
Film
Madrid has the largest roster of V.O (versión original, meaning subtitled)
movie houses in the country. Finding an English-language movie isn’t
that difficult, as long as the Spanish subtitles don’t bother you. It’s also
the best place to get acquainted with what’s happening in Spanish
cinema — one of the most vital in Europe. The best theaters showing
both big-budget and art-house foreign and Spanish films include
Alphaville, Martín de los Heroes 14 (Metro: Plaza de España); Cines
Ideal Yelmo, Doctor Cortezo 6 (Metro: Sol); Princesa, Princesa 3 (Metro:
Plaza de España); and Renoir Plaza de España, Martín de los Heroes 12
(Metro: Plaza de España). Foreign films that haven’t been dubbed are
designated “V.O.” Pick up a copy of Guía del Ocío for full, current listings.
Going Beyond Madrid: Three Day Trips
One of the highlights of visiting Madrid is getting out of town. That may
sound counterintuitive, but just outside the capital are some of Spain’s
greatest hits, equal in their own way to the drawing power of Madrid. If
you’re really limited on time and not planning to rent wheels, you can
zip in and zip out of El Escorial, a beautifully austere 16th-century
monastery, or Aranjuez, the grand summer palace and gardens of the
Bourbon monarchs. Both are in the Madrid province and make easy half-
day trips from the capital. More than two dozen trains depart daily from
Madrid’s Atocha, Nuevos Ministerios, and Chamartin train stations.
During the summer, extra coaches are added. For schedules and infor-
mation, call % 902-24-02-02.
With just a bit more time, you can do one or more of the Central Spain
biggies: Segovia, Toledo, and Salamanca — three of Spain’s most enjoy-
able, historic spots within a few hours from Madrid. (See Chapter 14 for
more information.)
If you don’t feel like doing the minimal planning (or driving) yourself,
and you don’t mind sticking to a group’s timetable, you can join one of
three major players that operate no-hassle day trips to the major sights
outside of Madrid (El Escorial, Aranjuez, and the Valley of the Fallen), as
well as to Toledo, Avila, and Segovia (see Chapter 14). Prices for day
tours range from 30€ to about 70€ ($36–$84), which generally include
round-trip transportation, some museum admissions, and a guided tour.

El Escorial: An austere monument to a king
Felipe II was Spain’s austere monk-monarch. Known as “The Wise King,”
he created a Hispanic empire, but he was also a cold tyrant and an
unbending religious fanatic. The Monasterio de San Lorenzo de
Escorial, his legacy and sacred retreat in the foothills of the Sierra de
Guadarrama Mountains, is monumental, gray, and spectacularly severe.
It was intended as a “city of God,” where Mass was heard day and night.
Yet the somber exterior of this mega-monastery, built from 1563 to 1584
and termed the eighth wonder of the world in its day, hides a real treas-
ure trove of artistic wealth. Beyond the fortress exterior of Monasterio
de San Lorenzo de Escorial is an art museum displaying the royal
Habsburg collection, a marble mausoleum holding the remains of
Spanish monarchs, and a royal library containing Felipe’s extraordinary
collection of manuscripts and tens of thousands of priceless books,
arranged beneath a ceiling of brilliant frescoes.
To live like a king at El Escorial — at least during Felipe’s reign — didn’t
mean living large. Although public areas are suitably grand, Felipe’s
royal living quarters are utterly monastic — quite the opposite of the
lavish apartments the Bourbon kings later installed at El Escorial. To get
as close as he could to heaven, Felipe requested that his private room,
“his humble cell,” overlook the massive dome of the basilica.
In the royal pantheon beneath the church’s altar almost all of Spain’s
monarchs are buried, including Felipe II and his father, Carlos V.
The museum holds numerous Titians, as well as paintings by Ribera,
Zurbarán, and El Greco. El Greco’s The Martyrdom of St. Maurice is one of
the artist’s acknowledged masterpieces. Don’t miss two frescoes in the
basilica: one of heaven, over the choir, and another by Titian, which
depicts the live roasting of San Lorenzo, after whom the monastery is
named (the latter being a tidbit for the macabre crowd).
During the summer months, you have little choice but to deal with hordes
of tourists streaming out to El Escorial, one of the most popular visits in
the Madrid area. Try to go either very early or very late in the day; you
may get lucky and run into fewer people. El Escorial (% 91-890-59-02 or
91-890-78-19) is open October through March, Tuesday to Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and April through September, Tuesday to Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission to the Royal Monastery is 8.50€ ($10) adults
and 5€ ($6) for seniors and students. Visits for E.U. members are free on
Wednesdays. Additional buildings, such as the outlying lodges Casita de
Abajo (Casa del Príncipe) and Casita de Arriba (Casa del Infante), have
separate opening hours and admission fees (the latter is open only Easter
Week and July–Sept, while the former is open year-round). For additional

information, visit www.patrimonionacional.es/infprac/visitas/
escorial.htm.
Guided tours are approximately 90 minutes, but visitors who want a full
view of El Escorial may want to budget an entire morning or afternoon to
adequately explore the entire complex and its many gardens.
Take either a train or bus to El Escorial, 49km (30 miles) northwest of
Madrid. From Madrid’s Atocha station, trains leave throughout the day,
from 5:48 a.m. to 10:17 p.m. A one-way ticket is 2.50€ ($3), or 5€ ($6)
round-trip. The trip takes about an hour. By bus, Empresa Herranz 
(% 91-896-90-28) leaves about every 20 minutes, from 7:15 a.m. to 
11:30 p.m. Buses (2.75€/$3.30 one-way, one hour) leave from the
Intercambiador de Montcloa Station (Metro: Moncloa) and take about 
an hour.
Where to dine
Even though El Escorial is an easy half-day trip from Madrid, you may
want to eat lunch here before you return to the capital, so try the suit-
ably named Mesón la Cueva, San Antón 4 (% 91-890-1516; www.meson
lacueva.com), known for its roasted lamb and suckling pig.
Aranjuez: The royal summer palace
Summer visitors to Madrid beeline to Aranjuez, the Palacio Real (Royal
Palace), with the same single-minded purpose that Bourbon monarchs
did: They want to escape the heat. In the midst of Central Spain’s arid
plains, this royal summer palace, near the meeting of the Tagus and
Jarama rivers, is a lush oasis with 283-plus hectares (700 acres) of cool,
shaded gardens, fountains, sculptures, and leafy trees imported from
Spain’s former colonies in the Americas.
The immense palace you see, a (relatively) poor man’s Versailles, isn’t
the same as the one favored by Ferdinand and Isabella, the legendary
Catholic monarchs. Twice razed by fire, the palace had to be entirely
rebuilt in the 1870s. Still, it remains extravagant. The splendid Porcelain
Salon, bathed in colorful tiles depicting Chinese scenes, may remind you
of Madrid’s Royal Palace — the tiles are from the same royal pottery fac-
tory. However, the standout features at Aranjuez are the serene gardens,
particularly the Jardín de la Isla (Island Garden) and Jardín del Príncipe
(Prince’s Garden), and romantic parks that inspired one of Spain’s most
famous pieces of music, Joaquin Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez.
In the mile-long Jardín del Príncipe (Prince’s Garden) at Aranjuez, you
find the luxurious, curiously named Casita del Labrador — the Worker’s
Cottage (quite a misnomer: How many blue-collar workers do you know
who reside in mini-palaces bursting with Greek busts, marble floors, and
brocaded walls?). Queen María Luisa, reputed to be an unrepentant
nympho, invited her young lover, Prime Minister Godoy, here for roman-
tic trysts (her husband, King Carlos IV, was nuts, so the cheatin’ queen
didn’t even try to conceal her dalliances).

The Palacio Real (% 91-891-03-05 or 91-892-43-42) is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. from April to September, and
from 10 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. from October through March. Admission for a

and students). Guided visits to the Casa del Labrador, which is currently
being restored, are 3€ ($3.60; 2.25€/$2.70 seniors and students) until
restoration is completed, after which prices will rise to 5€ ($6; 4€/$5
seniors and students). Visits are free on Wednesday for E.U. residents.
The palace is located 47km (29 miles) south of Madrid. For additional
information about Aranjuez and reservations, call % 91-891-0 3-05. You
can easily hop either a bus or a train for Aranjuez.
A couple of dozen Aisa y Samar (% 902-19-87-88 or 91-468-41-90) buses
depart daily from Estación Sur de Autobuses (Metro: Méndez Alvaro).
The trip takes an hour and costs 3€ ($3.60) one-way. On Sundays, far
fewer buses run. Trains, which take 45 minutes, leave from Atocha sta-
tion (Metro: Atocha RENFE) every 20 minutes or so; the trip costs 2.50€
($3) one-way, 5€ ($6) round-trip.
A historic, tourist-oriented old steam train with wooden cars and atten-
dants in period dress, Tren de la Fresa, or the Strawberry Train, travels
from Madrid to Aranjeuz, as it first did in 1851 (it was the second rail line
in Spain). During the last weekend of April, the months of May, June, and
September, and a few selected dates in October, it departs from the
Atocha AVE station once daily at 10:05 a.m. (arriving an hour later) and
returns at 6 p.m. Adult tickets (which include guided visits to the Palacio
Real) cost 24€ ($29); for children ages 2 to 12 the cost is 16€ ($19). Call

Maps
A free street map covering all of Madrid is
available at Tourist Information Offices at
the airport, train stations, and in the city.
The map is sufficient for virtually all city
travel. You should also pick up the pocket-
size map of the Metro subway system,
available free at any Metro station.
Newspapers/Magazines
Most European newspapers are sold on the
day of publication, as are the Paris-based
International Herald Tribune and European
edition of The Wall Street Journal. USA
Today is also widely available, as well as
principal European and American maga-
zines. You can find them at the many kiosks
along Gran Vía or near Puerta del Sol.
Spanish-speakers should check out enter-
tainment listings in the weekly magazine
Guía del Ocio (Leisure Guide).
Pharmacies
Pharmacies (farmacias, indicated by neon
green crosses) operate during normal busi-
ness hours, but one in every neighborhood
remains open all night and on holidays. The
location and phone number of this farmacia
de guardia is posted on the door of all the
other pharmacies. You can call % 098 to
contact all-night pharmacies.
Police
Call % 112 or 092.
Post Office
The Central Post Office is located at Palacio
de Comunicaciones, Plaza de la Cibeles, s/n
(% 91-396-24-43). It’s open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m and Sundays
and holidays from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The
yellow sign CORREOS identifies branches of
the Post Office. Stamps are also sold at
estancos (tabacco sellers). An airmail letter
or postcard to the United States is .75€
(85¢).
Safety
Madrid has a reputation of having one of
the highest crime rates in Spain, though
street crime is normally limited to pickpock-
eting and breaking into cars with items left
in the seats. Exercise extra care along Gran
Vía, Puerta del Sol, Calle Montera (known
as a heavy red-light district), the Rastro flea
market, and areas with lots of bars (and
rowdy drunks), such as Huertas and Latina.
The presence of so many people out at all
hours of the night is generally cause for
reassurance rather than fear. Also, be
especially careful of tourist scams near the
art museums on Paseo del Prado.
Taxes
The government sales tax, known as IVA
(value-added tax), is levied nationwide on
all goods and services, and ranges from 
7 to 33 percent.
Taxis
If you need to call a cab, recommended taxi
companies include Tele-Taxi (% 91-371-21-
31), Radio Taxi (% 91-447-32-32), and Radio
Taxi Independiente (% 91-405-12-13).
Telephone
For general telephone information, call 
% 010. For national telephone information,
dial % 009. Madrid’s area code is 91,
and you must dial it before all numbers.
International call centers are located at the
main post office, Plaza de la Cibeles, s/n;
Gran Vía 30; and Paseo de Recoletos 41
(Plaza de Colón).

Castile: Around Madrid
In This Chapter
 Setting out on side trips from Madrid
 Visiting Segovia’s fairy-tale castle and 2,000-year-old Roman Aqueduct
 Marveling at Avila’s massive medieval walls
 Discovering Salamanca, Spain’s oldest university town
 Taking in the views at Toledo, El Greco’s city on a hill
C
astile, the Spain of Roman conquerors and medieval kingdoms, cer-
tainly looks the part of the storybook Spain that most first-time
travelers expect to find: a place of walled cities rising heroically on the
plains, of grand sand-colored castles and cathedrals, and of historic
palaces and universities. Segovia, Salamanca, Avila, and Toledo match
those expectations and then some, so it’s a little surprising that so many
people rush by these historic cities in frenzied day trips from Madrid.
Sure, they’re close together and accessible from the capital, but a very
enjoyable Spanish vacation could easily be taken in only these places —
all named UNESCO Heritage of Mankind cities. They also make for an
excellent leisurely driving tour.
Segovia has a fairy-tale castle and 2,000-year-old Roman Aqueduct, while
massive medieval walls that are among the most impressive and best
preserved in Europe ring Avila. Stately Salamanca, Spain’s oldest univer-
sity town, is a living museum of early Renaissance architecture with
regional flourishes, and Toledo, El Greco’s enlightened city on a hill, is
where Christian, Muslim, and Jewish cultures all thrived in the days
before the Inquisition.
The beauty of these cities is immediately apparent. But to discover the
depths of their appeal, you need more than a quick drive-by. These cen-
ters of learning, government, and religion — serious cities carved out of
stone and wood — are surprisingly pleasant places to spend some time.
Consider these great cities of Castile not just as add-on, one-day side
trips from Madrid but as unique components of a slower-paced regional
trip, similar to possibilities offered by the Basque Country (see Chapter
12), Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos (see Chapter 16), and Girona and the
Costa Brava (see Chapter 11). A relaxed pace reveals the towns of
Central Spain to be more than handsome museum pieces.

Major Attractions in Castile
Segovia and Salamanca are part of what was once the kingdom of Old
Castile (which is now more commonly called Castilla y León), northwest
of Madrid in central Spain. Toledo, for all its ancient roots, is part of the
region of New Castile, or Castilla y La Mancha, southwest of the capital.
Segovia, Salamanca, Avila, and Toledo are all between one and three
hours by car, train, or bus from Madrid.
The parched plains of central Spain are especially given to extremes:
blisteringly hot in summer, brutally cold in winter. The best times to visit
the region are spring and fall; summer brings not only heat waves but
oceans of tourists, overrunning some of the quiet beauty of such towns
as Segovia and Toledo. The region, though, is popular most of the year;
high season is mid-March through the end of October, generally, and low
season (with slightly lower hotel rates) is from November through mid-
March. (Though in Toledo, December is also high season.)
Regional dining is classic Castilian: This landlocked area goes big for
meat and game — suckling pig, oven-roasted lamb, partridge, and
sausage and beans. It’s the kind of hearty, straightforward cooking that
old inns serve in clay bowls.
My advice concerning attractions in Castile is simple: Do as much as you
have time for, without blowing through anything. Almost everyone hits
the towns of Castile after spending a few days in Madrid, which is the
ideal way to organize a trip to central Spain. Although people often try to
squeeze in side trips from Madrid on madcap bus tours of only a day or
so, Segovia and Toledo each require (at least) full days, and really reward
overnight stays. You can best see Salamanca, the farthest from Madrid, in
a couple of days. To visit them all by car, you need a minimum of four
days, but even that’s zooming through in pretty quick fashion.
Some of the big attractions in Castile are the many castles, the military
fortresses, and the remains of walled cities. The region was known for 
its warlike ways — it was fought over by the Visigoths, Moors, and
Christians, and spent nearly all of the Middle Ages being attacked and
sacked. In fact, even the name of the region relates to war: Castile is a
derivative of castillo, the Spanish name for castle.
Seeing Segovia
Less touristy than Toledo, but nearly as rich a representative of the
golden era of Old Castile, Segovia (seh-goh-vyah), 91km (54 miles) north-
west of Madrid, is among the most picturesque cities in Spain. The city
has one of the more impressive settings in the world: It rises like a
mirage upon a limestone elevation from the dry plains. In Segovia, look
for the Roman Aqueduct, a triumph of superior engineering and a
symbol of the city; El Alcázar, a castle crowning the city on the hill; and
the Catedral de Segovia, the last great Gothic cathedral in Spain.

Castile
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 321

Checking out Avila
Avila, 110km (68 miles) northwest of Madrid, is known for having the
greatest medieval walls in Europe. The massive stone fortifications,
nearly 40 feet high and 10 feet wide, ring the city. Avila was also the birth-
place of the legendary Catholic mystic Saint Teresa. Look for the convent
named for her, in addition to Europe’s greatest medieval ramparts and an
Old Quarter of cathedrals, churches, and convents. However, despite its
illustrious history, for most visitors who don’t consider themselves true
devotees of Saint Teresa, Avila merits only a brief visit.
Savoring Salamanca
Pristine Salamanca, 204km (127 miles) northwest of Madrid, is a great uni-
versity town, and was Spain’s center of learning in the Middle Ages. The
entire Old Quarter, made up of university buildings, palaces, monasteries,
and convents, is the finest collection of Renaissance and Plateresque
golden sandstone buildings in Spain. (For more on Plateresque architec-
ture, see the “Salamanca architecture 101” box, later in this chapter.) In
Salamanca, look for the University of Salamanca, the alma mater of
Cervantes and a draw for students all over the world; old and new cathe-
drals, glowing examples of Gothic and early-Renaissance architecture; 
and Plaza Mayor, a splendid gathering place, one of Spain’s most stately
public squares.
Touring Toledo
Toledo, 68km (42 miles) southwest of Madrid, is on nearly everyone’s
must-see list for a reason. Its setting, high on a hill on the plains of cen-
tral Spain, is incomparable, the subject of a thousand paintings, includ-
ing favorite son El Greco’s. The labyrinthine city looks like a complex
castle surrounded by a moat, the Río Tago (Tagus River). Each of its
crooked, atmospheric streets, packed with Moorish mosques, Jewish
synagogues, Christian cathedrals, and stately palaces, is a rich Spanish
history lesson. Before the Spanish Inquisition forced non-Catholics to
flee Spain, Toledo was the capital of a tolerant, multicultural Spain. In
Toledo, look for the cathedral, opulent and spectacular, one of Spain’s
greatest; El Greco’s magisterial painting The Burial of Count Orgaz, as
well as the artist’s house/museum; and the last remaining synagogues of
the city’s influential medieval Jewish community.
Segovia
Segovia is, as the Spanish say, encantador — charming. In addition to its
top draw, the nearly 2,000-year-old Roman Aqueduct, the city boasts
other big sights — the cathedral and El Alcázar — and lots of charming
little surprises in its Old Quarter. Spend most, if not all, of your time in
the historic center near the cathedral and castle.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
322

Getting there
Driving to Segovia is a breeze, and it’s a scenic drive from Madrid, taking
about 75 minutes. Take the A-6 northwest from Madrid toward León. The
Segovia turnoff (north on N-603) is signposted. If you’re only visiting
Segovia, though, a car’s not necessary to explore the city.
By bus
La Sepulvedana, Paseo de la Florida 11 (% 91-559-89-55; Metro:
Príncipe Pio), buses leave Madrid for Segovia (a 90-minute ride) every
half-hour Monday through Saturday, beginning at 6:30 a.m. with the last
returning at 9:30 p.m. (10:15 p.m. on Sat). On Sunday, service is hourly,
with returns every half-hour between 4 and 10:30 p.m. One-way fare is
6€ ($7.20). The Segovia Bus Station is at Plaza de la Estación de
Autobuses 1 (% 921-42-77-07).
By train
The train takes half an hour longer than the bus, and even though it
makes several stops, I find it more comfortable and relaxed. You also
have a better view of beautiful mountain terrain as you climb up to
Segovia. From Madrid, nine trains a day depart from Atocha station
(Metro: Atocha RENFE) between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. They arrive in Segovia
a little more than two hours later. The last train back to Madrid leaves at
8:55 p.m. A one-way trip costs 5.45€ ($6.50). The train station, at Plaza
del Obispo Quesada, s/n (% 921-42-07-74 or 902-24-02-02), leaves you a
good ways from the Old Quarter. You either need to take a taxi or bus
(no. 3 to Plaza Mayor), or walk about 20 minutes.
Getting around
Segovia’s Old Quarter is pretty small. Your own two feet are the best way
to get around, unless you stay at the Parador de Segovia, which is a
couple of miles out of town and requires a taxi or car. To get a perspec-
tive of the city from beyond the walls (writers have long said that it
forms a giant ship on the horizon), you either need to put on some long-
haul sneakers or hire a cab if you don’t have a car.
If you need a taxi, you can either catch one at the stop next to the Roman
Aqueduct (pretty hard to miss!) or call Radio Taxi (% 921-44-50-00).
Spending the night
Most people drop in on Segovia, rush around, and then bolt back to
Madrid or on to their next stop. It’s too bad because Segovia’s quiet Old
Quarter is a special place to stay overnight. With the Roman Aqueduct,
the cathedral, and El Alcázar (the storybook castle on the edge of the
hill) all brilliantly illuminated at night, the city transmits medieval allure
like few others. And for a small place, it’s got a fair share of charming
hotels. In fact, choosing among the following isn’t easy.

Hostería Ayala Berganza
$$$
On outskirts of Old Quarter
The name may not roll off the tongue of most English-speaking visitors,
but this small inn (18 rooms) is one of the most comfortable and atmos-
pheric places to stay in Segovia. Located outside the ramparts that encir-
cle the Old Quarter, it’s next door to the fine Romanesque church San
Millán, and just a short walk south from the Roman Aqueduct. However,
it’s not easy to locate, and some travelers may not like the neighborhood
compared to that of hotels located in the heart of the Old Quarter. Partially
inhabiting a 15th-century Castilian palace that was once home to the
painter Ignacio Zuloaga, the Ayala Berganza claims a lovely central court-
yard with stone columns and spills over to a modern construction. All
rooms are uniquely and attractively decorated; some have bathtubs and
canopied beds. Try to get one in the original, Gothic-mudéjar palace.

Hotel Infanta Isabel
$$–$$$
Old Quarter
You can’t ask for a better location. This midsize (39-room) 19th-century
charmer is right on the central Plaza Mayor. It has attractive Victorian
décor, great service, and some very large doubles — some with small ter-
races and breathtaking views of the plaza and cathedral. With pretty cur-
tains and other elegant touches such as white-painted furniture, the rooms
are very reasonably priced — one reason this place is packed in high
season. Rooms are priced according to size; you can choose from small,
medium, and large, so opt to see a couple before settling on one if several
are available. The hotel now features an attractive cafe/restaurant serving
lunch and dinner as well as breakfast.

Hotel Residencia Las Sirenas
$$
Old Quarter
Inexplicably named for mermaids in this land-locked region, this is the best
bargain hotel in town (even though its prices have crept up steadily in the
last few years). Right in the heart of the Old Quarter, it’s a short walk from
the Plaza Mayor and cathedral and is across from an animated square,
Plaza de San Martín. Enter through a simple door and find a long charcoal-
colored marble floor and marble staircase at back. The whole place is well
maintained; rooms have a lot of light and are decently furnished for the
price. Rooms in the back of the hotel look out over the countryside to the
Sierra de Guadarrama.

Hotel Residencia Los Linajes
$$–$$$
Old Quarter
This personal, midsize hotel (55 rooms) is probably the best place to ex-
perience the charms of old Segovia. On a side street in the San Esteban part
of the Old Quarter, the hotel occupies a 17th-century palace that belonged
to a noble Segovian family (although much of the hotel is new construc-
tion). It’s not fancy, but the hotel has a lovely lobby and central patio, and
some rooms have priceless panoramic views over the Eresma River and
the Parral monastery. (Asking for these rooms is worth it.) The hotel was
renovated a couple of years ago; rooms have nice wood furnishings and
well-equipped bathrooms. This place is peaceful, making the small disco
that the hotel operates down some stairs out back oddly incongruous.

Parador de Segovia
$$$
3.2km (2 miles) northeast of Segovia
It may not be all that convenient for exploring the Old Quarter of Segovia,
but this parador’s views are out of this world. This spacious and tranquil
government-run hotel, tucked into a hill 3.2km (2 miles) north of the city,
has a commanding perspective of Segovia — from the aqueduct to the
medieval walls and the cathedral and castle. At night, all are beautifully illu-
minated, and you have to tear yourself away from admiring the monumen-
tal city long enough to get some shut-eye. By day you can hit the pool, which
has the same magnificent views as the rooms and is sure to be a big hit with
the kids. The place is startlingly modern and very comfortable, if not his-
toric, romantic, and palatial like some paradores. Rooms are large, with tiled
floors and contemporary furnishings. Most have lovely views of the city
down the hill. If you have the time and want to take a leisurely approach to
the city, this is a great choice. However, if you’re here to see the Old Quarter
in a day or so, or you want to walk around the city at night, the inconven-
ience of having to drive or take a taxi down into town makes the parador a
less attractive option.

Dining locally
Segovia’s the place for cocina castellana (Castilian cuisine) — roasts,
hearty soups, sausages, and beans. The city’s Old Quarter has a handful
of restaurants that do it right, and that look the part of classic Castilian
mesones (inns). For more on Spanish dining customs, including meal-
times, costs, and tipping, see Chapter 2.
Mesón de Candido
$$$
Old Quarter
CASTILIAN
A meal at Candido’s, right beneath the towering Roman Aqueduct, is pretty
much an obligatory stop on the Segovia tourist circuit. Salvador Dalí, Ernest
Hemingway, and even Tricky Dick Nixon have all dined on suckling pig here.
The famous place has been an inn since the 1700s, and five generations of
the Candido family have run the place for almost the entire 20th century.
The restaurant was declared a national monument in 1941. But that doesn’t
mean you get a crummy tourist menu. Happily, this restaurant is still one
of the best in Segovia. Try to score a window seat on the second floor for
dreamlike views of the Aqueduct, illuminated at night — more than enough
to keep children entertained. Oh, and the food: Start with a sopa castellana
or pimientos de piquillo rellenos de setas (red peppers stuffed with mush-
rooms). If you don’t have the classic cochinillo asado (roasted baby pig),
you can always try jabalí (wild boar) or fresh grilled salmon.
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 327
Eating and drinking like a Castilian
Central Spain can be a little rough on vegetarians. Everywhere you turn, you see wood
ovens fired up with roasted cochinillo asado (suckling pig) and cordero asado (roast
baby lamb). These and other dishes haven’t changed much since the Middle Ages; try
also sopa castellana (a broth with ham, vegetables, eggs, and bread), cocido castel-
lano (a chickpea-based stew), and perdiz (braised partridge, especially popular in
Toledo). If you’re looking for a little something to tide you over, try morcilla (blood
sausage) and queso Manchego (sheep’s milk cheese that’s hard when mature) — both
are excellent accompaniments to a glass of red wine.
The region of Old Castile, particularly the Valladolid area around the River Duero, is
gaining a reputation for producing some of the finest wines in Spain. Though red wines
from Spain’s Rioja region are better known (see Chapter 12), in recent years the reds
from Ribera del Duero vineyards have been quite literally on everybody’s lips. The
region produces not only Spain’s most expensive wine, Vega Sicilia, but also more
affordable, yet also superb, vintages from such wineries as Pesquera and Mauro.
They’re deeply colored, smooth, and frequently oaky wines. Look for them in restau-
rants in Castile and throughout Spain. Valdepeñas reds, produced south of Toledo, are
also quite good.

Mesón Duque
$$$
Old Quarter
CASTILIAN
If you climb the main street from the Roman Aqueduct to the Old Quarter,
you pass this classic mesón (tavern restaurant) on the left. Loaded with
dark wood beams and knickknacks, this must be what grandma’s house
looks like in the heart of Old Castile. The cozy inn has been serving
Segovian specialties since 1895. Start with the judiones de la Granja con
bacalao (kidney beans with cod) and follow it up with one of the Castilian
roasts, which the house cooks about as well as anyone else in town. Wines
are a bit pricey.

Mesón José María
$$$
Old Quarter
CASTILIAN
One of the newer restaurants in town, José María has a hopping tapas bar
in front that’s usually packed with a mix of animated locals and tourists.
The restaurant is in back through an arch. One wall is a model of the
Roman Aqueduct, its arches filled with wine bottles — a cute if touristy
touch. If you’ve already had the Segovian roasted lamb or suckling pig at
another inn, try something else, because the chef clearly has more than
just roasts in mind. The stuffed fish dorada cantábrico (golden bream — a
type of fish), crammed with garlic and mushrooms, is very tasty. Other
appetizing fish dishes are offered, but the leg of lamb stuffed with mush-
rooms and truffles is tempting.

Exploring Segovia
No one has any trouble finding Segovia’s top tourist attraction, the mon-
umental Roman Aqueduct. The old walled quarter of Segovia rises above
it. The cathedral and El Alcázar are the other premier attractions. Old
Segovia is also rich in Romanesque churches and monasteries and cool
little plazas.
Until the mid-1990s, cars were allowed to pass through the arches of the
2,000-year-old Roman Aqueduct in Segovia. Pollution from auto emissions
was causing serious deterioration to the landmark, though, and Segovians
finally mustered the political will to prohibit vehicular traffic from passing
through — but not around — the Aqueduct. Restoration of the massive
structure went on for nearly a decade. Although most locals recognize the
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
328

value of protecting their city’s ancient symbol, that doesn’t stop them
from complaining about the congestion caused by the rerouting.
The top attractions
Catedral de Segovia
Old Quarter
Called “the grand dame of Spanish cathedrals,” this massive but delicately
drawn limestone church was Spain’s last great Gothic cathedral. Begun in
1525, it rises gracefully on the Plaza Mayor, right across from the spot
where Isabella was named Queen of Castile in 1474. It overflows with
riches; inside are 23 ornate chapels, including one by José Churriguera,
the architect of Salamanca’s famed new cathedral (see “Salamanca archi-
tecture 101,” later in this chapter), a magnificent carved choir, and gor-
geous stained-glass windows. The La Concepción chapel is spectacular.
The cathedral is actually the second church built on this spot; the clois-
ters, which you can visit, date from the first church. Allow an hour or so
to tour the grounds.
See map p. 324. Plaza Mayor. % 921-46-22-05. Admission: Free to cathedral; 2€
($2.40) to cloisters and museum. Open: Summer daily 9 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; winter daily 
9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
El Alcázar de Segovia
Old Quarter
Finishing off Segovia’s trio of great monuments is its fairy-tale, turreted
castle, located at the edge of the old town. The ancient fortress, like the
aqueduct, may be Roman in origin, but it more likely dates from the 12th
century. At any rate, it was wholly reconstructed in the 15th century. It
was a favorite residence of the Castilian monarchs during the Middle Ages.
In 1862, a great fire destroyed much of the castle, so what you see is largely
restoration work. The real highlight is climbing the Tower of John II, once
a state prison. The 400 steep, one-way steps leave teenagers huffing and
puffing and complaining, but if you’re in decent shape, don’t miss the
amazing 360-degree view from the top of Segovia and the meseta (plateau)
and mountains beyond. Plan on spending an hour or so at the Alcázar.
See map p. 324. Plaza de la Reina. From the cathedral, walk straight along Marqués
del Arco and continue along Daoiz; you run right into the Alcázar. % 921-46-07-59.
Admission: 3.50€ ($4.20) adults, 2.50€ ($3) ages 8–14, children under 6 free, free on
Tuesdays for E.U. citizens. Tower access is an additional 1.50€ ($1.80). Open: Summer
daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m., winter daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed: June 16.
Roman Aqueduct
One of Spain’s most sensational sights and the subject of a thousand travel
posters, Segovia’s aqueduct is one of the greatest surviving examples of
Roman engineering. The granite aqueduct, constructed in A.D. 90 (although
some contend that it dates to 1 B.C.), has nothing but the force of physics
holding its massive blocks together — no mortar, no clamps. Yet it has
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 329

remained standing for nearly 2,000 years. Designed to carry water from
the Ríofrío River in the mountains 16km (10 miles) away, the Aqueduct has
166 perfectly designed arches (35 were destroyed by the Moors in the 11th
century), 20,000 blocks, and 120 pillars. The structure reaches a height of
29m (95 ft.; in the Plaza de Azoguejo, where it’s easiest to view it) and
stretches about 1km (2⁄3 of a mile). As impressive as it is as a feat of engi-
neering, the Aqueduct is also uncommonly beautiful. The way it frames
the city is quite extraordinary. Make sure you check out the sight of it fully
illuminated at night against the black Segovian sky. Half an hour is suffi-
cient to walk around and have a good look.
More cool things to see and do
Segovia is a charming town, perfect for leisurely walks and soaking up its
Old World Castilian ambience. If you have time to do more than visit the
top three showstoppers that draw the busloads of quick-hit tourists,
nice walks around the Old Quarter and just outside the city walls will
take you past charming Romanesque churches, tiny alleyways, and
Renaissance palaces.
 Traipsing through old town. The pretty Plaza Mayor, a lively place
filled with cafes and tapas bars in summer, is the obvious place to
start. From there, proceed down Infanta Isabel and over to Canalejas.
You come to the 12th-century Iglesia de San Martín, one of Segovia’s
40 Romanesque churches, notable for its handsome porches and
carved portal. Plaza de San Martín is also a very pleasant little
square, lined by attractive mansions. Across the way is the elegant
house known simply by its Renaissance origins as Casa del Siglo XV
(15th-century house). The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Esteban
Vicente (% 921-46-20-10), back across Plaza de San Martín on
Plazuela de las Bellas Artes, is an art museum housing 148 works of
the Spanish artist Vicente, best known for his association with the
New York School of Abstract Expressionists. The museum is open
Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 4 to 7
p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Admission is 2.40€ ($2.90)
for adults, and 1.20€ ($1.45) for students and seniors; free on
Thursdays. If you walk down Calle Grabador Espinosa, you come to
the Casa de los Picos, a Renaissance mansion known for its armored-
looking exterior.
Finally, take Obisbo Gandasequi to San Agustín, turn left, and go
straight on La Trinidad. Beyond the Episcopal Palace on Calle
Valdeláguila is the handsome Romanesque Iglesia de San Esteban,
with an impressive tower and a neat side gallery. The little Roman-
esque Iglesia de San Miguel didn’t occupy its present spot just off
the Plaza Mayor some 500 years ago. Back then it sat right on the
Plaza Mayor. Though Segovia looks unchanged since the heyday of
the Spanish empire, in fact a number of churches and buildings
were taken down and reconstructed, stone-by-stone, in other loca-
tions in the city. Happily for workers, the massive Roman Aqueduct
was not one of the structures that had to be moved.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
330

The small Jewish Quarter, El Barrio de la Judería, or Sefarad
Segovia, is located behind the cathedral, along the old wall near the
castle. In the 13th century, Segovia had a sizeable Jewish commu-
nity, with at least five synagogues (Toledo originally had ten).
 Venturing beyond the town walls. Writers have long described the
view of Segovia from outside the Roman walls as that of a giant
ship, with the Alcázar at its bow, the cathedral forming the main
mast, and the aqueduct representing the helm. A good place to
view this city/ship is from the parador up on the hill, or the Parque
del Alcázar at the crux of the Eresma and Clamores Rivers.
Just beyond this point is the curious little Iglesia de la Vera Cruz
(% 923-43-14-75), one of the most interesting Romanesque churches
in Segovia. Though an odd polygon shape on the exterior, it’s per-
fectly round inside. Stand in the middle of the inner temple and test
the weird echo your voice produces. The church is said to have been
the place of secret rites of the Knights Templar in the 13th century,
although some modern historians doubt this claim. The church is
open Tuesday through Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 3:30
to 6 p.m. It’s closed June 24 and in November. Admission is 1.75€
($2.10).
Shopping for local treasures
Segovia’s on the day-trip tour circuit, and the streets around the Plaza
Mayor and cathedral are well stocked with shops clamoring for your
tourist bucks. Several have good-quality crafts items, including the iron-
work, pottery, and embroidery for which Segovia is known.
For a unique shopping experience, visit the Monjas Domínicas on Calle
Capuchinos Alta 2. It’s open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 6:30 p.m. daily
(% 921-46-00-80). The Dominican nuns make fine handmade polychrome
figures. Prices start at just under 20€ ($24) and go up to more than 3,000€
($3,600) for a hand-carved and painted altarpiece.
To see the nuns’ work, you enter a door and ring the bell; a disembodied
voice from behind the wooden turnstile says “¿Sí?” (Yes?). A simple
“Hola” (Hello) will grant you admission into the showroom. The voice
will say “Pase, por favor” (Come in, please). When inside, you stand
alone before a selection of objects on display behind bars. At length,
another sister comes out and turns on the lights. Indicate which item
you’re interested in, and she’ll fetch it for you, allowing you to inspect it
through the iron gate.
Living it up after dark
Segovia is a pretty quiet town at night. Much of what nightlife it does
have centers on the tapas bars and cafes of the Plaza Mayor and Plaza
de San Martín. Surprisingly, two good Irish pubs in town pull a decent
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 331

Avila
One of Spain’s most important settlements during the Middle Ages, Avila
(ah-vee-lah), the country’s highest provincial capital, can be seen from
miles around. Sitting atop a windswept plateau, its stunning fortresslike
exterior — massive medieval ramparts that ring the Old City — ranks 
as the town’s most notable feature. Within those spectacular walls was
born the legendary mystic and saint, Teresa, who 500 years later still
inspires faithful followers. If you count yourself among the legions of
Teresa of Avila devotees, a visit here, to all the places she touched in her
lifetime, is obligatory. But for others, Avila will come as a bit of a disap-
pointment. In off-season, it can seem especially bleak. Maybe I’m court-
ing sacrilege in saying this about Saint Teresa’s birthplace, but for most,
Avila only merits a brief visit.

Fast Facts: Segovia

Avila is en route to Salamanca if you’re driving from Madrid or Segovia
and you can do a drive-by — taking in the incredible 11th-century walls
from the side of the road, stopping for a well-framed photograph — 
and move on without worrying too much about what you’re missing.
Especially when viewed alongside the vibrant life and stunning monu-
ments and architecture of Toledo, Salamanca, and Segovia, Avila is com-
paratively dull within the walls, and even a walk atop the magnificent
murallas falls short of what you’d imagine it to be.
Getting there
To get to Avila by car, take A-6 northwest from Madrid toward Leon. 
The Avila turnoff southwest (N-110) is signposted; the drive takes about
90 minutes.
By bus
Empresa Larrea (in Madrid % 91-539-90-05; Metro: Méndez Alvaro)
travels from Madrid’s Estación Sur de Autobuses to Avila (90 minutes;
6.25€/$7.50 one-way) many times a day Monday to Friday. On weekends,
only three buses travel back and forth. The bus station in Toledo is
located at Av. de Madrid 2 (% 920-22-01-54).
By train
From Madrid, many trains depart Atocha station (Metro: Atocha RENFE)
daily for Avila; the trip takes between 80 minutes and 2 hours. One-way
costs 6.05€ to 16€ ($7.25–$19), depending on the type of train (the
fastest and most expensive is the Talgo, which makes the trip in 1 hour,
20 minutes). The train station in Avila, Av. de José Antonio, s/n (% 920-
24-02-02), is about 1.6km (1 mile) from the Old City; you can either take
a taxi or walk about 20 minutes through a somewhat grungy (but safe)
neighborhood.
Spending the night
Because you can see the town in a few short hours, most visitors really
don’t need to overnight in Avila — unless staying within its ancient walls
or near the birthplace of Saint Teresa poses a firm attraction for you. In
that case, Avila has an excellent trio of hotels.

Built around a dramatic interior courtyard, this large, elegant, and splen-

stay; situated next to the cathedral within the city walls, it also occupies
the best location. The 145 rooms are handsome, modern, and luxurious,
with rich wood-beamed ceilings and stone arches and floors. The hotel’s
pub in the old stables deserves special mention — it’s one of the coolest
spots in town to take a load off. The restaurant’s a winner, too, serving fine
lamb and steaks.

Exploring Avila
By far the biggest draw in Avila is the monumental medieval walls that
encircle the town, but the churches and convents that serve the cult of
Saint Teresa rank a very close second. If you have some extra time in
town, the cathedral and San Vicente Basilica are also worth checking out.
The top attraction
Las Murallas de Avila
Avila’s dramatic city walls, begun in 1090 and still amazingly intact, are the
oldest, most complete, and best preserved in Spain — probably even the
finest in Europe. They’re a feast of crenellated towers, turrets, and para-
pets. So solid that it hardly appears to have suffered the effects of nearly
a millennium, the great wall of Spain chalks up impressive numbers: It’s
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 335
Saint Teresa’s story
Avila exerts a strange pull on some visitors. Perhaps it’s the walls, but more likely it’s
the legend of St. Teresa, one of Catholicism’s most famous saints and Spain’s female
patron saint. Born to a father of Jewish descent in 1515, Teresa is best known for her
mystical visions (in one, an angel pierced her heart with a burning lance, an image
that inspired a number of Baroque artists; in others, the devil himself appeared to her).
As a young girl, she ventured beyond the walls of Avila intending to become martyred
by the infidels, the Moors. As an adult, Teresa was a crusader who took on the
excesses of the Catholic Church and reformed the Carmelite Order. She created Las
Descalzas, an order of barefoot nuns (actually, they were allowed to wear sandals)
given to lives of absolute poverty and piety. In her lifetime she founded 16 convents.
She was canonized, or declared a saint, in 1622, and named a “Doctor” of the Catholic
Church in the 1970s, placing her in the rarified company of another legendary saint, St.
Augustine. Teresa’s enduring legend is in part based on her rapturous mystical visions
and beliefs among her followers that her severed hand was capable of performing
miracles long after her death. The city of Avila plays special tribute to her every year,
with the week-long Fiestas de la Santa Teresa that begins October 8. Look for parades,
processions, and other religious events that draw plenty of pilgrims.

nearly 2.4km (11⁄2 miles) long, 11m (36 ft.) high, and 2.7m (9 ft.) thick, with
2,500 battlements, 88 cylindrical towers, 6 gates, and a single bell tower. Of
the nine gates, the Puerta de Alcázar is by far the most impressive. Don’t
miss the chance to climb the ramparts and, for a small fee, walk along a
section (from the Puerta de Alcázar to Puerta del Rastro); find the tiny
ticket booth located just behind the cathedral. Careful, though: The steps
are very steep.

More cool things to see and do
Do you have a few extra hours to spend in Avila? If so, I suggest the fol-
lowing activities.
 Visiting the Catedral de Avila. Avila’s cathedral is a pretty gloomy
affair on the outside, part fortress and part church. Begun in the
12th century in Romanesque style, it was completed as a Gothic
cathedral in the 16th century. Thankfully, the interior lightens up;
it’s dominated by a high Gothic nave and decorated with surprising
red and yellow stones. The item of greatest interest is the alabaster
tomb of El Tostado, literally “The Toasted One.” Don Alonso de
Madrigal, the 15th-century Bishop of Avila is buried here. He was a
learned man, and apparently also a swarthy one. The cathedral is
located at the Plaza de la Catedral 8 (% 920-21-16-41). It is open
June through October, Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
and Sunday from noon to 8 p.m.; November through March,
Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.; April through May, Monday
to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 7 p.m.
Admission is 2.50€ ($3).
 Viewing the walled city. The best place to view the city is from an
old shrine, called Cuatro Postes (Four Pillars), just beyond the
river. Nothing more than four columns and a cross, it’s the spot
where the young Teresa of Avila fled with visions of martyrdom
already in her head. To get there, exit the city walls and take
Avenida de Madrid west. Cross the bridge, Puente Adaja, on the
city’s western side. Take a right on N-501; the monument is a few
hundred yards on your right, above the river.
 Inspecting the carvings of the Basílica de San Vincente. This 12th-
century church (% 920-25-52-30) is just beyond the city walls on
the north side of town. The impeccably carved Romanesque west
portal recalls the brilliant carved stone of the cathedral in Santiago
de Compostela. The tomb of the martyr St. Vincent, who was tor-
tured and killed on this spot in the fourth century, is a masterful
example of limestone carving, and the acts of martyrdom are

to 6:30 p.m. Admission is 2.50€ ($3).
 Visiting the Convento de Santa Teresa, the birthplace of Saint
Teresa. In the 17th century, a Baroque church and convent were
built on the site where Saint Teresa of Avila, who reformed the
Carmelite Order, was born. (See “Saint Teresa’s story” in this chap-
ter.) Fittingly, her bedroom has become a chapel. An odd assort-
ment of relics on display includes her finger and the whip she used
to flagellate herself. The Convento (% 920-21-10-30) is at Plaza
Santa. It’s open November through March, Tuesday to Sunday from
9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.; April through October,
Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 4 to 6:30 p.m.
Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
 Making a pilgrimage to the Monasterio de la Encarnación. Built in
1479, this Carmelite monastery is where Saint Teresa entered as a
novice in 1535, at the age of 20, and where she lived for 27 years. 
Of greatest interest to those who come to Avila seeking the Teresa
trail is her (reconstructed) cell in the chapel, the Capilla de
Transververación. A small museum holds items related to Teresa’s
life, and the Carmelite sisters sell souvenirs. The monastery (Paseo
de la Encarnación; % 920-21-12-12) is just outside the walls on the
northern edge of town. It’s open daily June through September, 
9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.; October through May, 9:30 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 6 p.m. Admission is 1.20€ ($1.45).
Fast Facts: Avila

Salamanca
Refined Salamanca (sah-lah-mahn-kah) is Spain’s City of Enlightenment.
If that sounds like an intimidating place for a relaxed visit, don’t sweat —
this college town is also one of Spain’s loveliest and most enjoyable
cities. The great Universidad de Salamanca, founded in the early 13th
century and one of the world’s pillars of learning — still dominates the
town and lends it an academic flavor.
The Old Quarter of Salamanca is a stunning assembly of early-Renaissance
architecture, with a special emphasis on the ornate style known as
Plateresque. Graceful monasteries, convents, palaces, and university
buildings carved out of sandstone, known locally as Villamayor — as well
as one of Spain’s prettiest Plazas de Mayor — dominate a relatively small
and largely pedestrian-only zona monumental (historic core). It’s stacked
with architectural sights (see the “Salamanca architecture 101” box in this
chapter for more info).
Though Salamanca feels like a small town, it’s a provincial capital of
nearly 200,000 people — and many more visiting language students. 
The city’s language programs are particularly popular at least in part
because Salamanca is said to be the place in Spain where the purest
form of castellano, or Castilian Spanish, is spoken (surely Salamanca’s
regal beauty may also be something of a draw for foreigners). Don’t be
surprised if you hear plenty of English on the streets; Salamanca is a
favorite destination among young Americans studying abroad in Spain,
and the city has become a gathering place for students from all over the
world. As a result, Salamanca has an especially throbbing nightlife.
But Salamanca also features an eclectic range of art exhibits, concerts,
and symposia. Since Salamanca was the European City of Culture in
2002, a number of theaters and other cultural centers were inaugurated,
and the city now has a better selection of hotels than ever before.
Salamanca is so gracious and beautiful, with so many scheduled events,
that it merits — even requires, I’d say — at least an overnight stay. It’s too
far from Madrid for an easy day trip, and honestly, you need time to fully
appreciate its monumental delights and cosmopolitan charms. It’s easily
the kind of place to hang out in for the better part of a week or more.
Getting there
A car is the easiest way to get to Salamanca. It’s about three hours from
Madrid, two hours from Segovia, and an hour and a half from Avila. From
Avila, which you must pass through whether you’re coming from Madrid
or Segovia, take N-501 west.

Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 339
Salamanca daily beginning at 7 a.m., with the last returning at 10 p.m.
The trip takes three-and-a-quarter hours and costs 11€ ($13). Returns to
Madrid begin at 7:30 a.m., with the last at 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. on Fri and
Sun). Express service (16€/$19) takes two-and-a-half hours.
Buses also depart for Salamanca from Segovia. The Salamanca bus sta-
tion (Estación de Autobuses) is located at Av. Filiberto Villalobos 71–85
(% 923-23-67-17).

By train
From Madrid, trains leave Chamartín Station (Metro: Chamartín) every
couple of hours and take about two-and-a-half hours to arrive. The one-
way fare is 15€ ($18). The Salamanca train station, located on Paseo de
la Estación (% 923-12-02-02) is northeast of the Old Quarter. Take a taxi
from there. The RENFE office in Salamanca is located at Plaza de la
Libertad 1 (% 923-23-67-17).
Getting around
Salamanca is yet another thoughtfully designed Spanish city in which
visitors are likely to spend all their time in the Old Quarter — called the
Casco Antiguo or zona monumental (historic center). And, the city is
small enough that you only need to depend on your own two feet to get
around. All the hotels listed in the following hotel review section are
within walking distance of Salamanca’s top sights.
Radio Tele-taxi, Don Quijote 1–11 (% 923-25-00-00) and Radio Taxi,
Paseo Canalejas 49 (% 923-27-11-11) both operate 24 hours a day; pick
up a taxi at the train station.

Salamanca architecture 101
Salamanca is a university town, but one might just as easily call it a living architectural
museum. The Old Quarter’s lovely convents, churches, palaces, and university build-
ings form a remarkably harmonious palette of stone on stone, and it’s particularly
enchanting in the late afternoon, when the fading sun gives Salamanca’s sandstone
spires and domes a golden glow, and shadows drape across the city’s red roofs and
stately arcaded Plaza Mayor. Salamanca is the greatest expression of two singular
architectural styles, Plateresque and Churrigueresque; nowhere else in Spain was
stone molded into such a wealth of ornate detail. Plateresque refers to a form of
early–Spanish Renaissance architecture in which rather somber facades are embel-
lished by ornate stone carvings, their fine detail reminiscent of silver filigree. The term
Plateresque is itself a reference to the art of silverwork (platero means silversmith in
Spanish). Elements to look for include sculpted capitals and parapets, medallions, and
round arches. The old university facade is perhaps the greatest example of
Plateresque work in Spain.
Churrigueresque architecture is named for three architect brothers — Jose, Joaquin,
and Alberto Churriguera — natives of Salamanca who worked throughout Spain (as
well as Mexico and other parts of Latin America) in the late 17th and early 18th cen-
turies but were especially busy in their hometown. The Churriguera style is like ornate
Baroque architecture on speed — it knows no excess. It was applied principally in
altarpieces, but Salamanca’s handsome Plaza Mayor is also the work of the
Churriguera brothers. Everyone seems to get the three brothers confused, though;
some works are attributed to the wrong sibling, or, in the absence of identifying traits,
merely to the entire clan.

Spending the night
Salamanca has several top-shelf and reasonably priced luxury hotels
housed in historic buildings, as well as many excellent medium-range
and budget hotels, all within the zona monumental (historic center).
Because everything of interest is clustered either right in or at the edges
of the Old Quarter, try to avoid any hotel that isn’t within walking dis-
tance of the major monuments and Plaza Mayor (this rules out the
parador outside the Old Quarter, which is otherwise a fine place to stay;
therefore, it’s not listed here). In the last few years, hotel developers
have gone on a binge, and Salamanca has added several much-needed
rooms, but still the city frequently fills up, especially during the month
of September, which is jam-packed with local festivals.
Abba Fonseca Hotel
$$$
Old Quarter
Capitalizing on a trend — begun in Salamanca by the exquisite Hotel
Residencia Rector (see review later in this chapter) — of erecting stylish
hotels within historic buildings, the Abba hotel preserves part of a 16th-
century Jesuit construction and inhabits an 18th-century neoclassical
mansion next to the Colegio Fonseca. Inside, it has been gutted and refur-
bished with bold colors and modern furnishings, and outfitted with large
rooms. The architecture and design are very contemporary, although not
as starkly hip or luxurious as the Palacio de San Esteban. Many rooms have
enviable views of the Old City. The hotel is quite a good deal given its loca-
tion and degree of comfort.

AC Palacio de San Esteban
$$$
Old Quarter
Occupying the 16th-century Convento de San Esteban in the heart of the
monumental quarter, and catering more to business travelers than other
hotels in the city, the AC Palacio opened in 2002 as Salamanca’s first five-
star luxury hotel. It has spare style in spades; it features handsome modern
design juxtaposed against the historic shell of the convent, and is a model
of restraint, simplicity, and good taste. The 51 rooms are large and wel-
coming if you’re hip to minimalist luxury, though they retain exposed
beams and warm wall colors. Some have spectacular views of old
Salamanca, while others overlook a small interior courtyard and gardens.
The excellent restaurant El Monje (the Monk) looks the part and is, like the
rest of the hotel, sumptuously designed, with beautiful stone walls and
arched ceilings. Although I still prefer the smaller and more intimate Rector,
this is clearly the best full-service, top-of-the-line hotel in Salamanca.

Hostal Plaza Mayor
$$
Old Quarter
Right across from the neat little San Martín church, and a mere stumble
home from the tapas bars of the Plaza Mayor, this hostal couldn’t have a
better location, especially at what in Salamanca are bargain prices. Rooms
are smallish, but nicely decorated with wooden headboards and attrac-
tive curtains. Two of the nineteen rooms have parquet floors. Given the
location, noise will be a concern for some guests.

Hotel Don Juan
$$
Old Quarter
A stone’s throw from the Plaza Mayor and surrounded by the Old City’s
monuments, this small and simple family-run budget hotel is unexpectedly
attractive. In a 200-year-old building, the comfortable, carpeted, and clean
rooms have salmon-colored bedcovers, and hallways aren’t the creepy cor-
ridors of most budget hotels — here they’re done in marble and light wood.
The small staff is exceedingly friendly. Top-floor rooms with views are the
best. The small cafeteria on the first floor is a good place for a quick bite.

Hotel Residencia Rector
$$$
Edge of Old Quarter
The stunning stone Renaissance facade — you may think you’ve stumbled
upon a palace from the Salamanca sightseeing circuit — is only a prelude
to the elegance within. This quiet and charming small hotel, a private man-
sion until 1990, is one of the finest I’ve stayed at in Spain, and certainly my
favorite in Salamanca, despite new competition. Details clearly matter here.
Everything is perfect, from the elegant, warm-toned décor to the white-
gloved breakfast service and friendly attentions of the staff. Service is
impeccable. I no sooner checked in than the woman at the desk kindly gave
me a packet of information about Salamanca and informed me that the
Plaza Mayor was “seven minutes’ walking distance down Calle San Pablo.”
The Rector’s 14 enormous rooms are very tastefully decorated; the white
marble bathrooms are spacious, the linens and towels plush. Public rooms,
including a small bar for guests only, have pretty antiques and stained-glass
windows. For the level of comfort, service, and graciousness — five-star in
every way — it’s an excellent value. I can’t wait to go back.

NH Palacio de Castellanos
$$$
Old Quarter
This handsome hotel is one of the most luxurious in the Spanish NH 
chain — known for targeting business travelers. Although decorated with
obvious good taste, it isn’t quite as refined as the serenely elegant Rector
or as sleekly modern as the AC Palacio de San Esteban. A 15th-century
palace with a pretty central patio and colorful, modern furnishings in its
62 sleek rooms, it’s a good choice for those who find the Rector a little too
quiet. The Palacio Castellanos is in the heart of the Old Quarter on a pretty
main street that leads directly to the Plaza Mayor. The entrance faces the
San Esteban convent.

Petit Palace Las Torres
$$$
Old Quarter
High Tech Hoteles, an expanding chain of dependable and affordable
Spanish hotels, got this terrifically located property in the heart of the Old
Quarter and dramatically renovated the rather dumpy old Las Torres
hotel. It’s an exciting midsize option (reopened in March 2004) right off of
Salamanca’s gorgeous Plaza Mayor (some rooms, including the breakfast
room, look over the plaza). If you’re not one to shy away from the hustle
and bustle of all the cafes that spill out into the square, the location simply
can’t be beat. Housed in a Churrigueresque building, the rooms inside
stand in stark contrast to the Spanish Baroque exterior: They’re sleekly
contemporary, but eminently stylish. If you’re one of the high-tech sorts
the chain covets, you’ll welcome the rooms that come with free wireless
Internet connections (“high tech” rooms have computers and even sta-
tionary bikes), while families will appreciate the 14 rooms that sleep up to
four. Special deals are often available that drop room rates below 100€.

San Polo Hotel
$$
Edge of Old Quarter
This small, good-value hotel, tucked just inside the Old Quarter, has a curi-
ous conceit: It occupies the site of the ruins of an 11th-century Romanesque
church, which have been incorporated into the modern hotel construction.
It’s a great idea in this ancient city, and if the execution isn’t perfect, well,
who’s to quibble? The 31-room hotel looks as though plans to make it more
luxurious were suddenly aborted, but it’s still a good, comfortable. midlevel
choice. Rooms are a little cold-feeling, but the views of Salamanca’s cathe-
dral are inspiring. Ask for a room with a view of the Casco Antiguo.

Chez Victor
$$$
CONTINENTAL/FRENCH
Salamanca’s top restaurant is like the city itself: elegant and refined with-
out being at all stuffy. Chez Victor’s owner is from Salamanca, but he
trained in France, and his interest in delicate, subtle French preparations
shows. The market-fresh vegetables and salads are a nice change in the
land of lamb and suckling pig. Among main courses, the turbot (a floun-
derlike fish) in a hot vinaigrette and medley of peppers and zucchini is
wonderful, as is the grilled monkfish on a bed of julienned zucchini. You
find a number of terrific meat and game dishes on the hand-written English
menu, including magret de pato, roasted duck with berries. Save room for
the scary part: a separate dessert menu for chocolate lovers. Being one of
them, I dived into the delectable marquise de chocolate (flourless choco-
late cake).

Sun lunch only. Closed: Aug.
El Pecado
$$$
NOUVEAU CASTILIAN
This funky, mod place, with hot pink walls and zebra-striped banquettes
upstairs and a campy religious theme throughout, looks more Almodóvar
than stately Salamanca, which makes it even cooler. El Pecado (“the sin”)
has a creative, modern, and very well executed menu, which changes every
three months. The daily menu available at lunch or dinner for 20€ is a bar-
gain. Try the lasagna composed of the wonderful local cheese torta del
Casar and Bellota Iberian ham and wild mushrooms, or the cod (bacalao)
cooked three ways. You’ll even find unusual items, such as a Thai vegetable
wok. El Pecado’s sister restaurant, Grana & Oro, Plaza del Angel (% 923-
26-14-05) is an excellent second choice; it’s also contemporary in style but
less wild and less expensive — its menú del día is just 15€).

La Hoja
$$$
NOUVEAU CASTILIAN
Tucked into a dark and narrow passageway that leads to the Plaza Mayor,
this unexpectedly attractive restaurant, lined with modern art, opts to do
something more innovative than the standard Castilian menu. The owner
and chef, Alberto López, tempts diners with special creations including
mushroom risotto and some dishes probably best sampled by adventur-
ous eaters: pig trotters (pigs feet) with apples and prawns, and even par-
tridge cooked in chocolate sauce.

Río de la Plata
$$
CASTILIAN
A charmingly plain little place, with just nine tables and a low ceiling at
the back of a bar, Río de la Plata looks like a men’s club. Two blocks from
Plaza Mayor, it’s intimate and cozy, and the white-jacketed waiters seem to
know patrons by name. The menu is a long list of well-prepared favorites,
such as grilled hake, solomillo (beef sirloin), and roasted baby lamb. This
basement restaurant with a fireplace (a great place to drop in on a chilly
night) has been going strong since the 1950s.

Plaza del Peso 10 (% 923-21-89-93). Also try La Jamonería de Carmen, Calle Zamora

Exploring Salamanca
You’ll want to spend a full day or so to appreciate this city’s beauty and
wealth of historic sights. The Old Quarter, with its exquisite Renaissance
and Plateresque buildings, is a tangible reminder of Spain’s Golden Age
in the 15th and 16th centuries. Although the city is bursting with man-
sions, monasteries, museums, and university buildings to take in,
Salamanca’s Casco Antiguo, or Old Quarter, is itself the chief sight, and
simply wandering around the pedestrian-only area, enjoying tapas and
drinks at one of the cafes on the Plaza Mayor, and taking it all in is a
highlight. Salamanca is such a thoroughly enjoyable town that lingering
for an extra day or two would be an excellent idea.
Guided two-hour walking tours (in English and Spanish) of Salamanca’s
Casco Antiguo are offered Fridays and Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. and Satur-
days and Sundays at 11:30 a.m. They cost 6€ ($7.20) per person. For more
information, call % 609-48-65-44.
The top attractions
Casa Lis (Museo Art Nouveau y Art Déco)
Edge of Old Quarter
If you walk along Calle Rector Esperabé, which borders the historic center
to the south, you can’t miss this stunning building with its bursts of bold
stained glass. An immaculately restored 19th-century private mansion, it
now houses the Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum of Salamanca. The col-
lection, with pieces from the late 1800s to the 1930s, includes porcelain
and enamel, Lalique glass, Modernist paintings, jewels, furniture, and dolls.
Children may be pleasantly surprised and entertained by some of the
pieces. Don’t miss the museum shop, not so much for the shopping but
for the view of the river and Roman Bridge through that amazing stained
glass. Allow one to two hours here.

Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
346

Catedrales (Old and New)
Old Quarter
One cathedral just isn’t enough for this monumental city. Instead of replac-
ing the old cathedral, Salamanca built a new one next to it. In fact, you
enter the old cathedral through the new one. The much larger new cathe-
dral has a dazzling main doorway loaded with Plateresque stone work.
(Try to see it in the afternoon sun when it really sparkles.) Work started on
the new cathedral in the early 16th century but wasn’t finished until 1733.
Make sure you check out the ornate choir and Cristo de las Batallas chapel,
the work of the Churriguera brothers.
The old cathedral, constructed in the 12th century, is a mix of Romanesque
and primitive Gothic. Though the church is literally overshadowed by the
new cathedral next door, its rooster tower, the famous Torre del Gallo, gets
plenty of attention. Inside, the most spectacular feature is the retablo
(altarpiece) on the High Altar, a bold work attributed to the 15th-century
artist Nicolás Florentino. It consists of 53 different paintings of the life of
Christ. Note the elaborate Gothic tombs and chapels around the cloister
that feature frescoes and gargoyles.
Don’t leave before visiting the Patio Chico, a small courtyard that puts the
old cathedral in perspective and provides a gorgeous view of the spires
against the Salamanca sky. (You may have to circle around back if the door

cathedrals probably requires a couple of hours.

Plaza Mayor
Heart of Old Quarter
I’ve been lucky enough to see most of Spain’s great plazas, and
Salamanca’s grand main square is one of the finest. To get there, just follow
the students and locals, most of whom don’t go a day without ducking
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 347
Blood simple: Salamanca’s graffiti
Everywhere you look in Salamanca, but especially on the university buildings, names
are stenciled in scarlet letters, an identifiably Old World academic font. Though today
it’s a clever marketing ploy, the script dates back to the 15th century, when graduat-
ing students proved their mettle by entering the bullring. Students proclaimed their
victories (over the bull and, presumably, the university) by taking the bull’s blood 
and painting the word VITOR (victor) on a university building, and signing and dating
their work.

under its arches. Salamanca’s Plaza Mayor is one of the biggest and most
animated squares in the country, but what makes it special is the exquisite
harmony of its architecture. Mostly designed by the Churriguera brothers,
the architects so instrumental in giving Salamanca its renowned
Plateresque look, the square was completed in 1733 — though the Baroque
Ayuntamiento, or Town Hall, was added about 20 years later. The other
important building is the Royal Pavilion, where the royal family used to
gather to view events in the square. The arcades’ crowning medallions cel-
ebrate the lives of such famous Spaniards as Columbus, Cortés, and
Cervantes. The Plaza Mayor was once the scene of bullfights (as plazas
were throughout Spain), but today it’s a place to shop, watch the sun go
down, and linger for long hours at one of the outdoor cafes until your
espresso buzz finally commands you to move.
Universidad de Salamanca
Old Quarter
In its heyday in the 13th through 16th centuries, Salamanca rivaled Oxford,
Paris, and Bologna, the other great European centers of learning. Its uni-
versity, the oldest in Spain, was founded by King Alfonso IX of León in 1218.
It produced some of Spain’s great academic figures, including Cervantes,
St. John of the Cross, and the philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. The most
spectacular building is the Patio de las Escuelas, or Old University facade.
Erected in 1415, the building gained its glorious Plateresque frontispiece
sometime in the 16th century. The figures of Ferdinand and Isabella (called
the Catholic Kings) are surrounded by a riot of ornamentation — cherubs,
crests, and creatures — that fills virtually every inch of the stone fron-
tispiece. Squint and see if you can find the frog, which features prominently
in the minds of students. Legend holds that they must share a moment
with it prior to exams if they hope to pass (some claim that finding it on
your own means a wedding looms). Go inside and take a look at the famous
but plain lecture hall of professor Fray Luis de León, a 16th-century the-
ologian who was imprisoned by the Inquisition for five years because he
translated the Biblical Song of Songs into Castillian Spanish.
Back outside, cross the Patio de las Escuelas and enter the Escuelas
Menores patio, with its beautiful lawn and gorgeous arches. The museum
here is known for its planetarium-like Cielo de Salamanca (Salamanca
Heavens) fresco, painted in 1473. Allot a couple of hours to visit the uni-
versity.
See map p. 339. Patio de las Escuelas 1. At the intersection of rúa Antigua and
Compañía. % 923-29-44-00. Admission: 4€ ($4.80), 2€ ($2.40) children and seniors,
free on Monday mornings and May 18. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 4–7:30
p.m., Sun and holidays 10 a.m.–1:30 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
Do you want to try out a few more activities in Salamanca? Consider the
following:
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
348

 Oohing and aahing on a house-and-palace tour. Fine mansions
and palaces are wedged in among Salamanca’s myriad university
buildings, convents, and churches, though only a few are open to
the public (as indicated below).
• Casa de las Conchas (House of the Shells, % 923-26-93-17),
on Calle de la Compañía 2 (at Rúa Mayor), is famous, much-
photographed, and impossible to miss. The facade of this
16th-century Gothic mansion is decorated with steel grilles
and protruding scallop shells — the symbol of the knightly
Order of Santiago, a group to which the former owner
belonged. The scallop shell is the symbol of the St. James pil-
grim’s trail, the legendary Camino de Santiago. Don’t miss the
lovely central patio. A tourism information office and public
library are now housed here. Free admission.
• Massive Palacio de Monterrey, also on Calle de la Compañía,
is one of Salmanca’s most beautiful Renaissance palaces. Had
it been completed, it would’ve been one of the largest private
palaces in Spain (what you see is only a quarter of what was
planned). Still, the upper deck is a fabulous example of
Plateresque ornamentation.
• Casa de las Muertes (House of the Dead), on Calle Bordadores,
gets its gruesome name from the tiny skulls that decorate its
early-16th-century facade. The owner ordered the skulls to
commemorate his uncle, an archbishop.
• Nearby, at Calle Libreros 25, is Casa-Museo de Unamuno 
(% 923-29-44-00), where the renowned university professor
and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno lived and then died in
1936. It’s also a museum dedicated to the professor’s life.
Hours are Tuesday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
and 4 to 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Admission is 3€ ($3.60).
• Palacio de Fonseca, on Calle de San Pablo, was built in 1538
and has a beautiful interior patio; look for the figures on the
second floor with the weight of the world on their shoulders.
• Check out the Torre del Clavero, which isn’t a house or a
palace, but did once belong to one. It’s a turreted octagonal
tower that was part of a now-disappeared 15th-century
manse. The tower is on Plaza de Colón, just off San Pablo.
 Bridging the gap. Just beyond the Old City is Salamanca’s oldest
surviving monument, the stone Puente Romano, or Roman Bridge,
across the Tormes River. Constructed in the first century A.D., it still
has 15 of its original 26 arches. Take a walk across, not only for the
photo-op view of Salamanca, but also to check out the park below
the bridge and alongside the river.
 Joining the faithful. After the old and new cathedrals, the two best
religious buildings in Salamanca face each other on Plaza del
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 349

Concilio de Trento: Convento de San Esteban and Convento de las
Dueñas. But you can check out all the following if you love religious
architecture.
• Convento de San Esteban has a monumental Plateresque
doorway, a robust stone canvas of delicate carving. Inside the
church are impressive frescoes and a typically ornate José
Churriguera altarpiece. Convento de San Esteban (% 923-
21-50-00) is open daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. in
summer, and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. in winter.
Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
• Convento de las Dueñas is a Gothic construction with a
lovely Renaissance cloister — the finest in the city and one 
of the best examples of the Plateresque style in Spain. Train
your zoom lens on the freakish ghouls inhabiting the tops of
the upper-story capitals. Convento de las Dueñas (% 923-21-
54-42) is open in summer daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
4:30 to 7 p.m.; in winter Monday through Saturday from 
10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m., and Sunday from 
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Admission is 1.50€
($1.80).
• If you can’t get enough of the city’s splendid religious archi-
tecture, check out the Convento de Las Claras, Calle Santa
Clara 2 (% 923-26-96-23). It features a collection of excellent
mural paintings from the 13th through 16th centuries as well
as other religious art. It’s open Monday to Friday from 9:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from
9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
• Finally, there’s Convento de las Ursulas, Calle Ursulas 2 
(% 923-21-98-77). It is open daily from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
4 to 6 p.m. (except the last Sunday of each month, when it’s
closed). Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
Shopping for local treasures
Salamanca isn’t exactly what you’d call a shopper’s town, but it does have
a few unique shops in the Old Quarter. The Mercadillo de Salamanca
(Flea Market), along Calle Rector Esperable on Sunday mornings, Gremio
de Artesanos (Arts & Crafts Guild), on Plaza de Sexmeros, and the
Centro de Cultura Tradicional, on Plaza de Colón, are all worth a look for
traditional arts and crafts.
Antiqvaria is a cool little antiques store with interesting books, watches,
and silver. It’s on Rúa Mayor 43–47 (% 923-26-99). It has a branch called
Antiqvaria Rustic, on Calle Palominos. Another nice antiques shop, with
beautiful jewelry and watches, is Gal-Art Gaite, Plaza Poeta Iglesias 18
(% 923-21-98-89). Mercatus, on Calle Cardinal Plá y Deniel, is the univer-
sity shop in this university town. It offers all kinds of gear and paper prod-
ucts with the ubiquitous, quasi-official Salamanca Academic lettering (see
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
350

“Blood simple: Salamanca’s graffiti,” earlier in this chapter). Tienda de
Lis, the gift shop of the Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum (Casa Lis; see
above), has a good selection of nouveau and deco jewelry, books, and
other items.
Living it up after dark
With so many Spanish and international students who crowd discos and
pubs on the weekends, Salamanca really buzzes at night. For young
people, especially in summer when the foreign students swarm the Old
Quarter, Salamanca is a perfect place to hang out and barhop. On warm
evenings, the Plaza Mayor is in a constant state of motion and is a great
spot to begin your evening.
For those who would rather plunge into the night and stretch it out until
morning, some caution should be exercised, as nightclubs flow with ine-
briated students and raging hormones. Women should travel in groups
and avoid deserted streets.
A good spot for tapas and drinks, as well as for people watching, is the
classic upstairs bar Mesón Cervantes (Plaza Mayor 15; % 923-21-72-13),
which overlooks the main square. Although plenty of people start their
nights there, just as many seem to end them at Mesón Cervantes before
stumbling out into the dawn. Rambunctious students fill The Irish Rover
(Rua Antigua 11; % 923-28-10-74), an Irish pub dressed up like a chic thea-
ter, which has lively jam sessions on Wednesdays. Camelot (Bordadores
3; % 923-21-21-84) and El Café Moderno (Gran Vía 75; % 923-26-01-47)
are two other popular bars (the latter features especially good DJs spin-
ning tunes and occasional live acts).
Discos very popular with young people and students from around the
world looking to hook up include Pachá, Av. de los Reyes de España 25;
Potemkim, Consuelo 4; and Versvs, Correhuela 11. Young women should
keep their wits about them at discos, as overt alcohol-induced sexual
come-ons are common.
Latin flavor predominates at El Savor (Calle San Justo 28, near Gran Via;
% 923-26-85-76), where you find salsa and other Latin music and sweaty
dancing from 10:30 p.m. to very late every night. (You can take Latin
dance classes Monday through Friday from 8:15 to 9:30 p.m.)
If sweaty isn’t exactly your idea of an ideal evening, classical music 
concerts and zarzuelas (light comic opera) are held at the Palacio de
Congresos y Exposiciones, Cuesta de Oviedo, s/n. Call % 923-26-51-51,
or visit www.palaciocongresossalamanca.com, for more information
and a schedule of events. The recently renovated Teatro Liceo (% 923-
27-22-90), on Plaza de Liceo, s/n, near the Plaza Mayor, is the best venue
for theatrical, dance, and concert programs.
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 351

Toledo
From a distance, Toledo (toh-leh-doh) looks like the set design of a
Spanish spaghetti western — one in which Moors on horsebacks storm
the citadel on the hill. Rising suddenly from the parched plains of La
Mancha from a perch on a granite cluster high above the Río Tago
(Tagus River), Toledo’s cathedral spires and fortress turrets are visible
for miles around. As spectacular as the setting is, the city within the
walls is even more extraordinary. The fabled city of the painter El Greco,
Toledo was where Spain’s ancient cultures met and thrived.

Castile, and especially Salamanca, is famed for its tunas — the name
given to the roving bands of troubadours that stroll the streets, serenad-
ing young women with songs of university life and love. Like characters
who wandered out of a Velázquez court painting, the tuneros keep a
great academic and musical tradition alive. With their ruffled collars,
black velvet suits, and billowing capes, they look like something plucked
from the 17th century — which, in a way, they are. Though they don’t
hound you like Mexican mariachis do, tuneros work for tips. If you enjoy
their performance and spectacle (which you’re almost certain to), give
them a euro or two.
Fast Facts: Salamanca

Toledo lives and breathes history. Captured by the Romans and later
conquered by the Visigoths, Toledo became the capital of Spain in 1085,
as well as a melting pot of Moors, Jews, and Christians in the Middle
Ages. For several centuries it was exemplary in its religious and cultural
tolerance. Now more than five hundred years after the Moors and Jews
were expelled from Spain, Toledo remains a fascinating showcase of
their achievements. An intricate jumble of churches, synagogues,
mosques, noble houses, and humble residences are virtually unchanged
since the 16th century.
The city’s past is a rich tale of strategic conquests and interlocking cul-
tures. The Romans captured Toledo in 192 B.C., named it Toletum, and
built it into a strategic settlement. The Moors invaded Spain in 711 and
headed straight for Toledo, capturing the city in 712. Under Moorish
control it remained a rich and cultured city with a thriving Jewish com-
munity of 12,000. The legendary general El Cid conquered it in 1085 for
Alfonso VI. Toledo became the capital of Spain, but the city fell into a
steady decline after the Catholic crusades banished its Jewish and
Muslim populations at the end of the 15th century. In 1561, Felipe II
chose backwater Madrid as his administrative and political capital,
cementing Toledo’s second-tier status (but, ironically, probably preserv-
ing its medieval appearance).
Toledo ranks as one of Spain’s top tourist destinations, and although it
hasn’t been physically corrupted like the Costa del Sol, it suffers from
the impact of massive tourism. It’s tiny, hilly, and hemmed in by
medieval walls, and in summer, waves of tour groups and mammoth
buses overwhelm the city’s impossibly narrow streets and small
churches, synagogues, and museums. Although Toledo remains an
almost obligatory side trip from Madrid (and still one of the most impor-
tant visits in the entire country), a peak-of-summer visitor who breaks
out in hives at the thought of huge crowds and omnipresent tour buses
may do well to take a detour to Segovia or Salamanca instead (or, better
yet, schedule a fall or spring visit).
If you stay overnight in Toledo, you get to enjoy the city late in the day
and evening, when the day-trippers depart, and very early the next
morning, before they come barreling in again. I recommend spending a
night and a couple of days in Toledo, though surprisingly few visitors
actually do this.
Don’t plan to visit Toledo on a Monday, when half the sights are closed.
Getting there
Traveling by car to Toledo is simple, but driving within the city walls on
the tiny, one-way streets is hair-raising. I suggest going by car only if
you’re planning to do a tour of other sights in Central Spain, such as
Segovia or Salamanca. If you do drive, Toledo is only a quick hour from
Madrid on the N-401 south.

By bus
The bus is the quickest and cheapest — and thus probably the most
convenient — way to get to Toledo from Madrid. Galliano Continental,
Estación Sur de Autobuses (% 91-527-29-61; Metro: Méndez Alvaro),
buses (4.20€/$5 one-way) leave Madrid for Toledo Monday through
Saturday every 30 minutes, beginning at 6:30 a.m. with the last return 
at 10 p.m. (no bus at 2 p.m.). The trip takes about an hour. Returns to
Madrid are also every half-hour, though the first bus is at 5:30 a.m. On
Sundays and holidays, the schedule is every half-hour from 8:30 a.m. to
midnight.
The Toledo bus station, Estación de Autobuses, is next to the river, on
Avenida Castilla-La Mancha (% 925-21-58-50). It’s about 1km (2⁄3 of a
mile) from the historic center. You can either walk (be warned, it’s
steep!) or take bus no. 5 or 6.
By train
The train from Madrid, which departs Atocha Station (Metro: Atocha
RENFE), takes 75 minutes, slightly longer than the bus. It’s also a tad
more expensive than the bus, but many visitors to Toledo find it a more
relaxing way to travel. In Toledo, the train pulls into a cool, 1917 railway
station, with a clock tower and keyhole arches. Several trains per day
make the trip; the first leaves at 6:50 a.m. Monday through Friday 
(8:20 a.m. on weekends and holidays). The first train back to Madrid
leaves at 7 a.m. (8:30 a.m. on weekends), the last at 9 p.m. Fare is 8.30€
($10) one-way.
The RENFE Train Station (% 925-22-30-99), on Paseo de la Rosa, is about
a 20-minute walk from the Old Quarter. You can also take bus no. 5 or 6.
You won’t find a permanent taxi stop at the train station. Call % 925-25-
50-50 or % 925-22-70-70 if you need a taxi.
Getting oriented
The good news is that Toledo is compact. The bad news is that it’s as
labyrinthine a place as you’re likely to find. Its twisting, turning streets
don’t even make sense to locals (see “Fast Facts: Toledo,” later in this
chapter, for a map recommendation). But, it’s so loaded with important
sights that even if you get lost you’ll stumble onto something.
The city is on a hill, and the Tagus River bounds it on three sides. The
southwest part of the city is the old Barrio Sefardí (Jewish Quarter),
where you find the synagogues, El Greco house and museum, and the
San Juan de los Reyes Monastery. The cathedral is almost in the dead
center of old Toledo. Alcázar (the fortress) is high on the hill, just east
of the cathedral.
The vista El Greco painted of his city was from the south side of the
Tagus River, looking northwest. If you have a car, drive along the
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
356

Carretera de Circunvalación (beltway), which provides stunning views
of the city and its amazing setting.
Getting around
If you drive to Toledo, take advantage of the public parking at Puerta
Vieja de la Bisagra (the Old Bisagra Gateway), at the entrance to the Old
City, and ditch your car immediately. Only a couple of hotels, mostly out-
side the Old City, have parking.
Don’t even think about venturing by car into the maddening maze of old
Toledo’s streets. The only way to make your way around the small his-
toric center is on foot, and virtually everything you want to visit is within
the medieval walls. The streets are incredibly steep, though, so make
sure you don some comfortable, supportive walking shoes. A day spent
walking in Toledo is like a rough day on a stair machine at the gym.
If your legs have had it and you need a taxi to rescue you or whisk you
to the train or bus station, call % 925-25-50-50.
Spending the night
Staying overnight in Toledo is a great idea — there’s so much to see, 
and walking around the tiny, hilly stone streets wears out even the best-
conditioned travelers. If you can afford the extra time, pass on a head-
spinning one-day tour and see Toledo at your own pace.
Toledo has a smattering of good and affordable hotels, some with gor-
geous views and others that really capture the city’s special atmosphere.
The hotels tend to be small, though, and because Toledo is one of the
most popular spots in Spain, you need to make reservations. If you plan
to visit anytime between March and September, making phone reserva-
tions a month or two in advance is a good idea. The smaller the hotel,
the greater the need for early reservations. Be aware that higher room
rates are charged for Holy Week and the Corpus Christi festival in early
June.
AC Ciudad de Toledo
$$$–$$$$
Across the river south of the city
One of the best hotels in Spain, and the top upscale choice in Toledo, the
midsize Ciudad de Toledo took some of the “wow” out of the parador down
the road when it opened in 1998. It has an equally coveted location,
directly across the river from Toledo, and equally brilliant views of the city,
but it’s brighter, more cheerful, and more luxurious. A member of the AC
family, which also includes the ultra swanky Santo Mauro in Madrid, this
hotel is model of contemporary luxury and design. The 49 rooms have hip
orange and green color schemes with bathrooms done in brightly colored
tiles. The very nice restaurant has to-die-for views of Toledo. Room rates
are more than fair—and a flat-out bargain if you score one an online pro-
moción for as little as 84€ ($101)—for a hotel of this caliber.

Hostal Casa de Cisneros
$$
Old City (near the cathedral)
A delightful small hotel with plenty of style and a great location—if you’re
not carting around too much luggage—this attractive spot is also a bar-
gain. Inhabiting a structure from the 16th century, it has been restored
with taste, but it retains many signature architectural elements, such as
brick arches and stone walls. Rooms aren’t overly large, but they are hand-
some and clean, as are the en-suite bathrooms.

Hostal del Cardenal
$$–$$$
Edge of Old City
This relaxed and personal inn feels like an old Toledo home — it’s the per-
fect hotel for the city and is the best bet if you want to stay within walking
distance of the Old Quarter. The former residence of an 18th-century car-
dinal, it’s built right into the city’s medieval ramparts, just around the bend
from the Puerta de Bisagra. It has graceful Moorish gardens with trickling
fountains and serene patios. Its twenty-seven antiques-filled rooms are
very comfortable, if not lavish. The restaurant (see the review, later in this
chapter) has long maintained an excellent reputation for classic Castilian
cooking. For the price, this hotel is a steal, but the secret’s out. It’s so small
that it’s full most of the year.

Hotel Abad
$$$
Old City (near the Puerta Bisagra)
Just inside the medieval city walls and a short distance from the Puerta
Bisagra, this small, modern and affordable hotel, inserted into an early
19th-century home and former blacksmith’s workshop, is a fine and com-
fortable place to stay. Though you can’t park right at the hotel, it helps
that you can easily drive in and drop off luggage (something that’s not
always possible at Toledo hotels in the Old Quarter). The hotel retains
hand-dewn wood beams and brick walls. Rooms are cheery and well
equipped; my favorite are the atticlike spaces on the top floor, though
some may complain that they’re not well enough soundproofed.

Hotel Alfonso VI
$$–$$$
Old City (near the Alcázar)
I was ready to write off this old-style Spanish hotel, right across from the
Alcázar, until I saw the back rooms that face south. They have small bal-
conies and views that gaze out across Toledo, the river, and the rugged
countryside. Even though you’re not looking up at the city on the hill (as
you do from the parador or the Ciudad de Toledo hotels, across the river),
the view is still extraordinary. The 83 rooms are a little plain, perhaps
(except for the shocking bright green curtains and bedspreads), but the
place has an odd, yesteryear character. Wait until you get a load of the
kitschy basement bar, done up in full medieval regalia with suits of armor
and heavy stone arches. Bring on the grog and gruel! Check for online dis-
counts of up to 40 percent.

Hotel Pintor El Greco
$$$
Old City (Jewish Quarter)
Similar in ambience to the Hostal del Cardenal but without the gardens,
and named for Toledo’s most famous son, this small hotel has a great
Toledo feel. A 17th-century noble home and former bakery, it showcases
tiles, exposed brick, dark wood, and iron lamps. Rooms around the cen-
tral courtyard are light and airy. They’re immaculately maintained, and
have received a slight update since the inn became part of the Sercotel
chain. One of the best things about the place is its location in the heart of
the old Jewish Quarter. It’s close to the El Greco museum and synagogues,
and is remarkably peaceful.

Parador de Toledo
$$$
Across the river south of the city
This parador allows its guests to see Toledo as El Greco did. Overlooking
the city, on a hill above the river, the parador has regal views. The hand-
some and fairly spacious rooms look and feel appropriately Castilian, with
leather furniture, chests, and heavy, dark wood tables. Once the top place
to stay in Toledo, the AC Ciudad de Toledo (see the listing earlier in this
section) has displaced it. For relaxing outdoors, though, it can’t be beat,
and you’ll probably spend most of your time (when not traipsing about
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 359

the city) on the terraces and by the large pool, which is sure to be a hit
with children (very few other hotels in the city have one). Most guests just
can’t get enough of the views (a room with a view is well worth the extra
20€/$24). This is one of the most popular paradores in the country, so
make your reservations early.

Dining locally
Asador Adolfo
$$$$
Old City
CASTILIAN
Catering to well-to-do locals and discriminating tourists, Asador Adolfo
occupies a handsome 15th-century building in the Old Quarter on a little
side street not far from the cathedral. Finding it is a bit difficult, just off
Calle Hombre de Palo a block north of the cathedral. Dine in one of four
quiet dining rooms with elegant place settings and solid beams overhead.
The kitchen is creative, pumping out original interpretations of traditional
dishes such as merluza al azafrán (saffron-flavored hake). Game is a spe-
cialty. The wine cellar, though, is the real star. Set in an 11th-century Jewish
cueva, or basement, with 50,000 bottles and 1,200 wines, it’s the best in
Toledo. For dessert, everyone raves about the marzipan; if you like the
sweet almond paste, you’ll love Toledo’s (it’s lighter than most versions).
The service, though, doesn’t always match the quality of the food.

Casón de los López de Toledo
$$$–$$$$
Old City
CASTILIAN/CONTINENTAL
A uniquely handsome restaurant occupying a traditional stone señorial
mansion and stuffed with period antiques — many of which are for sale —
this is the most sumptuous spot to dine in Toledo. With a vaulted foyer,
statuary-laden patio, and Moorish-style ceilings and stucco work, it exudes
the flavor of old Toledo. The menu, though, adds fresh and sophisticated
contemporary touches to classic Castilian dishes, using excellent, fresh
local produce. Try the venison on a bed of spinach and mushrooms or the
cod and orange millefeuille. Desserts are equally outstanding.

El Catavinos
$$
Edge of Old City
CASTILIAN/SPANISH
I love this quirky place on the outskirts of Toledo’s medieval core, just five
minutes from the Bisagra gate. It’s not fancy, just a comfortable and relax-
ing place for a low-key meal away from the hubbub, with an ample choice
of wines. Proprietor Luis Martínez is a photographer and hunter of wines;
the restaurant’s name means wine taster. The bar downstairs is nestled
among the wine racks, and the simple dining room upstairs is decorated
with Martínez’s photographs of Latin America. The menu, a dizzying array
of midday and evening fixed-price meals that are excellent deals, is filled
with good comida casera (home cooking). I’ve ordered their grilled salmon,
which was quite tasty, as was the solomillo (sirloin steak) served in a huge
portion that came with fries worthy of a Belgian bistro.

Hostal del Cardenal
$$–$$$
Edge of Old City
CASTILIAN
For many years one of Toledo’s most respected eateries, specializing in
traditional Castilian cooking, the restaurant at the Hostal del Cardenal is
no longer quite so renowned. Some locals report that the kitchen here has
become a bit stagnant. Still, you can’t go wrong in a setting this fine with
such great views and terrific ambience. Attached to the splendid Moorish
gardens of the Hostal (see hotel review, earlier in this chapter), the restau-
rant remains one of the most atmospheric places to dine in the Old City.
Oven-baked sea bass, lamb chops, and the local specialties, roast suckling
pig and partridge, are well-executed standards. Be sure to take a stroll in
the gardens after dinner.

La Abadía

Old City
CASTILIAN
I stumbled upon this friendly and nicely designed, slightly upscale restau-
rant/bar while hunting down the tiny Cristo de la Luz synagogue. La Abadía
means The Abbey — appropriate in a city with such a roster of religious
monuments. The restaurant serves such solid Castilian fare as judías con
perdiz (white bean and partridge casserole, a classic Toledo dish), pâtés,
and venison. It’s also a great place to drop in for tapas; the bar area is often
packed with hungry, talkative nibblers. Fittingly, the Abbey serves a hand-
ful of Belgian abbey beers for those of you tired of red wine and sherry.

La Ermita
$$$
Old City
NOUVEAU CASTILIAN
With a spectacular view of Toledo from across the river, this contemporary
and upscale, but relaxed, restaurant is where I’d go if I had just one night
in Toledo. It has massive picture windows framing the majestic view of the
city, and while that is certainly the star of the show, chef Jando Domínguez
González’s menu doesn’t take much of a back seat. He adds a modern touch
to traditional Castilian dishes. Starters include a cream of potato soup with
clams, shrimp, and salmon roe, and marinated tuna layered with anchovies
and piquillo peppers. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed main courses of
monkfish in a clam sauce with green asparagus, and hake with caramelized
mushrooms. Carnivores will enjoy classic dishes like oxtail, pig’s knuckles,
and beef tenderloin. The wine list is fairly priced; check out the Dominio
de Valdepusa reds from the local winemaking savant Marqués de Griñon.
Though Spaniards eat very late, it’s worth arriving early, at sundown —
around 9 p.m. in summer — to see the lights begin to twinkle. Later, the
cathedral is brilliantly illuminated on the hill.

La Perdiz
$$
Old City
CASTILIAN
A good-looking but unfussy place owned by the same people who run the
city’s fanciest restaurant, Adolfo, La Perdiz (which means “partridge”) is
more down-to-earth and comfortable, as well as much less expensive than
its upscale relative. In the heart of the Jewish Quarter between the syna-
gogues Tránsito and Santa María la Blanca, its two dining rooms feature
exposed brick and crisp white table linens. An excellent starter is the cro-
quetas de perdiz (partridge croquettes), a house specialty. Follow that with
one of the rice dishes (with shellfish, for example), roast suckling pig, or
albóndigas de bacalao (cod balls), all solid entrees to fortify you for
Toledo’s challengingly hilly streets.

La Tarasca
$$

CASTILIAN
Just a couple of short blocks north of the cathedral, on a busy street lined
with jewelry and craft shops, La Tarasca is a good place to duck in for a
solid lunch. You can order from the regular menu, but all anyone seems to
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
362

order is the menú del día (fixed-price meal). The décor is merely func-
tional, but it’s a little nicer in back, away from the door. It quickly gets
crowded with sightseers and locals (there seems to be more of the latter),
so try to beat the 2 p.m. lunch rush, especially on weekends. You may start
off with a pretty decent paella (a rice, meat, and seafood casserole), and
follow it up with cordonices (braised game hen) or trout. A glass of wine
and dessert (flan or ice cream) is included in the menu.

Exploring Toledo
In Toledo, separating the must-sees from the can-do-withouts is tough
because the distinctions are a bit arbitrary — the city is a fascinating
whole with a long roster of complex parts. Really the only way to absorb
most of Toledo’s great charm is by wandering its narrow, history-suffused
streets. Getting too caught up on checking off major sights is probably
not the best way to enjoy the city. In any case, seeing everything in a
single day is impossible. However, if that’s all you have time for, consider
only the main stops listed in “The top attractions,” later in this chapter. If
you can spend the night and at least a second day in Toledo, consider
visiting a couple of the locations detailed in the following “More cool
things to see and do” section.
Before you set out to conquer Toledo, consult a good map in addition to
the one provided here (see “Fast Facts: Toledo,” at the end of this chap-
ter, for a recommendation). Toledo is a complicated maze of twisting
streets that makes providing good directions nearly impossible. If your
map reading fails you, ask a local. Most are more than happy to point
you in the right direction.
The best place to start your tour is from the Puerta de Bisagra (where
the Tourism Office is located). Pass through the massive gate and enter
the twisting maze of Toledo’s tiny streets. All the major sights I list are
within the Old City.
The top attractions
Catedral de Toledo
Old City
Allow sufficient time to see Toledo’s centerpiece, one of the most opulent,
jaw-dropping Gothic churches in Spain. The massive asymmetrical struc-
ture makes a solid case for Toledo’s religious importance in the Middle Ages.
Begun in 1226, it wasn’t finished until nearly three centuries later, in 1493
(the year after Columbus is credited with discovering America). On the out-
side, the cathedral is French Gothic; the interior mixes Spanish Gothic with
Mudejar, Renaissance, and Plateresque elements. Right in the middle of the
cathedral nave is the choir, a splendid example of wood carving on the lower
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 363

choir stalls and alabaster sculpture on the upper tier. The Alta Mayor (High
Altar) is a fabulous, brightly colored polychrome retablo (altarpiece) drip-
ping in gold. The kings of Castile are buried here. Walk around the altar and
look straight up. Hung from the ambulatory is an almost ridiculously ornate
marble sculpture, Transparente. A controversial sun roof (it’s so incongru-
ous, I don’t know what else to call it) was cut to allow sunlight in to illumi-
nate it. Before the opening was carved, the sculpture was almost impossible
to see.
The sacristy (to the left of the main altar) holds a treasure trove of art-
works, including El Greco’s Expolio (The Denuding of Christ), as well as
works by Titian and Goya. The Sala Capitular, to the right rear of the cathe-
dral, is a mini Alhambra, with intricate Mudéjar (Christian architecture
employing Arab motifs and elements) ceilings and stucco doorways. In the
Treasury is a wondrous 16th-century monstrance — the receptacle used
to display communion wafers or bread — that weighs nearly 181kg 
(400 lbs.) and is nearly 3m (10 ft.) high. Despite the monstrous proportions,
the faithful hoist and parade it through the streets of Toledo during the
Corpus Christi celebration in June. Plan on spending one to two hours here.

Admission: 6 € ($7.20). Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun and holidays 2 p.m.–

Iglesia de Santo Tomé: El Greco’s The Burial of Count Orgaz
Old City
The Church of Santo Tomé is a required stop because of a single painting.
However, that painting is one of the finest in Spain: El Greco’s masterpiece,
The Burial of Count Orgaz. The painting, created for the space where it still
hangs today, is masterful in its color, contrast, and composition. It depicts
the miraculous appearance of St. Augustine and St. Stephen at the burial
of the Count, a church patron who paid for the construction of Santo
Tomé. It’s also a self-portrait: El Greco is seventh from the left at the
bottom, staring straight ahead. Visitors often cram the small room, so try
going the minute it opens in the morning or just after lunch if you want to
ponder the work in relative peace. Allow as long as you can stand looking
at a stunning work in the company of lots of restless day-trippers — about
a half-hour, allowing for the crowd.
See map p. 354. Plaza del Conde 2. One block south of Calle del Angel/Calle de Santo
Tomé, in the southwestern part of the city. % 925-21-60-98. Admission: 1.90€ ($2.30),

Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes
Jewish Quarter
A Gothic monastery commissioned to commemorate the Spanish victory
over Portugal in 1476, this was to have been the burial place of the Catholic
Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela. (They were eventually buried in the
Granada cathedral.) As you may guess, it’s suitably grand, a gorgeous and

surprising mix of Gothic and Mudéjar architecture. The fine Gothic clois-
ters have a superb Moorish-style, wood-carved ceiling, and brilliant stone
carving. Peek out over the balcony for a view of some wild gargoyles. The
monastery is in the extreme western portion of the city near the Jewish
Quarter. An hour here suffices, though the cloisters are a place to linger.

Museo de Santa Cruz
Old City
Built before the era of superstar architects, this museum is as notable for
the building itself as for its collection. It was a hospital for orphans and
the indigent in the 16th century, so the building seems surprisingly sump-
tuous with carved wood ceilings and rich marble floors. Better lighting
and upkeep wouldn’t hurt, but its outstanding early-Renaissance features,
including a dramatic, ornamental stairway and Plateresque patio, are impos-
sible to miss. The museum has a number of El Grecos, the most important
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 365
El Greco: Domenico the Greek
If anyone ever needed a nickname, it was Domenico Theotocopoulous. Spaniards
simply called the Greek artist (who didn’t adopt Toledo as his hometown until 1577,
when he was already 36 years old) El Greco, or The Greek. Toledo made him famous
and vice versa. El Greco’s View of Toledo is a lovely picture of the city on the hill, but
the painter is considered one of Spain’s greatest for his deeply spiritual portraits of
saints and Madonnas, depicted in an otherworldly, elongated fashion.
Contrary to popular legend, El Greco almost surely didn’t suffer from astigmatism. The
ethereal figures, their forms reaching toward heaven, were a product of the artist’s
deeply spiritual vision. His portraits were meditative and almost hallucinatory. It’s no
surprise that his paintings found no favor at Madrid’s Royal Court, where realism
reigned supreme. However, his adopted city adored him, and El Greco found his place
of divine inspiration in its melting pot.
El Greco’s supreme artistic achievement, The Burial of Count Orgaz, depicted a burial
ceremony so important that two saints miraculously appeared at it. But the artist him-
self met a less ceremonious end: He lies in the Santo Domingo Monastery, underneath
a curious little museum run by the nuns there. You can view El Greco’s remains by
kneeling down and peering through a hole in the floor. The coffin is so small that it
looks more like a toolbox.
If you want to see the tomb and the retablos (altarpieces) El Greco painted in the
monastery, they’re at the Convento Santo Domino el Antiguo, Plaza Santo Domingo, s/n
(% 925-22-29-30). The hours are Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 4
to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 4 to 7 p.m. only. Admission is 1.20€ ($1.45).

being La Asunción de la Virgen (1613). Originally an altarpiece, this piece is
one of the master’s final works, painted just months before his death.
Extending from ceiling to floor is the battle flag from Lepanto, the landmark
1571 victory over the Moors. Throughout the building’s wings, designed in
the form of a Greek cross, are excellent 16th-century tapestries, furniture,
and decorative arts. You probably need a couple of hours at this fascinating
museum.
The Santa Cruz museum is one of the few sights in Toledo that remains
open at midday (except Mon). Go at 2 or 3 p.m.; not only is it less crowded,
but this way you can squeeze more activities into your day without too
much dead time at lunch.

Sinagoga del Tránsito (Museo Sefardi)
Jewish Quarter
This 14th-century synagogue, one of the most important examples of
Sephardic art and architecture, was one of ten that once existed in Toledo,
when one-fifth of the population was Jewish. The exterior is rather nonde-
script, but inside it’s a wealth of elaborate Mudéjar decoration. The two-
story interior has a dazzling carved cedarwood ceiling and splendid stucco
inscriptions in Hebrew. The upstairs balcony was reserved for women.
Within the synagogue is the Sephardic Museum, which displays an inter-
esting collection of tombstones, robes, and books, many dating prior to the
expulsion of Spain’s Jews in 1492. Allow from a half-hour to an hour.

Across the river: El Greco’s view of Toledo
It’s common to feel a little claustrophobic as you navigate Toledo’s labyrinthine streets
on foot, dodging cars and tour buses. If you have a car, don’t miss a drive along the
Carretera de Circunvalación, the beltway that runs alongside the Tagus River around
the city. Head east toward the Ermita de Nuestra Señora del Valle, a small chapel
above the river, the Parador del Toledo, and the Roman Bridge, Puente de Alcántara.
The views of the city are dazzling, especially at dusk — you can easily see why El
Greco was so enamored of this view of his adopted hometown. A couple of bars and
outdoor cafes have sprung up here, though few tourists seem to make the trip. If
tourists do venture across the river, most go on up to the terrace at the parador, from
which the views are equally good (in fact the hill on which the parador sits is pur-
portedly the hill from which El Greco painted View of Toledo).
If you don’t have a car, at least walk out through the San Martín neighborhood, west
of the old Jewish Quarter and over the San Martín Bridge (which dates to 1203), and
take a look back at Toledo rising on the hill before you. Allow at least an hour (more if
you catch the light just right as you gaze at the city).

See map p. 354. Just south of the Casa-Museo de El Greco, near the intersection of
Paseo del Tránsito and Calle de San Juan de Dios. % 925-22-36-65. Admission: 2.40€
($2.90), free Sat afternoons and Sun. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 4–6 p.m.,
Sun 10 a.m.–2 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
Toledo overflows with worthy churches and monuments to draw your
attention if you have more than an afternoon or single day in the city.
 Touring the Alcázar. Toledo’s Alcázar (% 925-22-16-73), or citadel,
on the hill is hard to miss, and not a bus tour goes by without stop-
ping at it, but inside it’s frankly a bit of a disappointment. Originally
built by Carlos V in the 16th century (a conversion of the 13th-
century fortress of El Cid, the famed Castilian warrior), it has been
destroyed by fire and battle and rebuilt many times — most recently,
after the Spanish Civil War. Restored and converted into an army
museum, it now looks much as it originally did. Its large Italianate
central patio is its most appealing feature, unless you’re wowed by
unending displays of weapons and uniforms. Note that the Alcázar
has been closed as it awaits the installation of the Museo del Ejército
(Army Museum), scheduled for 2007. The Alcázar is located at Calle
General Moscardó 4. To get there climb the ramp off Cuesta de
Carlos V, near Plaza de Zocodover. When it reopens, it is expected to
retain its original hours, Tuesday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. Admission is 2€ ($2.40), and it’s free for E.U. residents on
Wednesdays.
 Getting to know El Greco. Though the name of this museum, Casa-
Museo de El Greco (% 925-22-44-05), implies that El Greco actu-
ally lived here, he didn’t. His actual home was destroyed long ago;
this one merely resembles it. Although that sounds like a monu-
mental tourist rip-off, the museum houses a hefty collection of El
Greco’s paintings, including one of a view of Toledo — but not the
famous View of Toledo, which belongs to New York’s Metropolitan
Museum of Art. The museum is located at Calle Samuel Levi 3. It’s 1
block south of Calle de Santo Tomé; take Travessía de Santo Tomé.
Hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. and
4 to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. Admission is 2.40€
($3), but it’s free on Saturday afternoon and Sunday and also free
for seniors.
 Taking in another synagogue. The 12th-century Sinagoga de Santa
María la Blanca (% 925-22-72-57), the oldest of ten that once
existed in Toledo, is one of only two that remain. (See the Sinagoga
del Tránsito review in the attractions section.) A national monu-
ment, it has a Christian name because it was taken over by the
Catholic Church in 1405. The synagogue has classic horseshoe-
shaped arches, similar to those of the landmark Córdoba Mosque
(see Chapter 15). The surprising Moorish design is owed to the
Muslim craftsmen who were commissioned to build it. The crafty
Moors also built the synagogue so that it faces Mecca (luckily, in
Chapter 14: Castile: Around Madrid 367

the same direction as Jerusalem). The synagogue is at Calle de los
Reyes Católicos 4, just down the street from (and east of) the San
Juan de los Reyes monastery. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
In summer it stays open until 7 p.m. Admission is 1.90€ ($2.40).
 Walking through Puerta de Bisagra, the town gates. This city has
two Bisagra gates. The old gate, built in the 11th and 12th cen-
turies, is the only one that remains of the original Muslim wall
around Toledo. Its arch is clearly Moorish in style. The newer,
Greco-Roman-style gate, just west of the original one, was com-
pleted in 1550. It’s much grander and carries the Habsburg coat of
arms (at the time, Spain was part of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled
by the Habsburgs). The gate (either door no. 1 or door no. 2) is the
best place to begin a walking tour of Toledo. Enter at the intersec-
tion of Calle del Cardenal Tavera and Avenida de la Cava (the city’s
north entrance).
 Admiring a legendary mosque. The Mezquita de Cristo de la Luz,
built in the tenth century, is tricky to find but well worth the effort.
The Moors built the square brick mosque, one of the oldest surviv-
ing in Spain, on the site of a Visigothic church. In fact, some original
pillars remain, although molded into Moorish arches. The mosque’s
name, “Christ of the Light,” is attributed to a legend of the military
general El Cid, who, on his way into Toledo to seize it from the
Moors, knelt in front of the mosque. Later, according to the story, a
lamp illuminating a crucifix (said to be left by El Cid) was suppos-
edly uncovered inside a wall of the mosque, where it had been
burning for some 300 years. The mosque (% 925-25-41-91) is at
Calle del Cristo de la Luz, just inside the walled town from Puerta
del Sol, across from Convento de Carmelitas. It’s open daily from 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in winter); admission is 1.90€ ($2.40).
Shopping for local treasures
Toledo is a mecca for crafts shoppers. The city’s distinctive black-and-
gold damascene art, nearly as symbolic of Toledo as the Alcázar or the
cathedral, is found everywhere within the Old Quarter. The art is an old
Moorish practice of inlaying gold (and sometimes copper or silver)
against a background of matte black steel. It’s the rare tourist who doesn’t
go home with at least a ring, letter opener, or some other damascene
souvenir. (If you’re not impressed with the merchandise, the relentless
sales pitches you encounter will certainly wear you down.) Damascene
items can be handcrafted or machine-made. If it’s cheap, it’s machine-
made; if you’re looking for a heftier, better-crafted souvenir, visit one of
Toledo’s reputable shops that have artisans on the premises.
Toledo has also been known for its swords since the Middle Ages.
Although swashbuckling tourists cart them off by the dozens, be warned
that airport security considers them weapons. Embroidery from the
small provincial towns of Lagartera and Oropesa is featured in many
shops; embroidered blouses, napkins, and tablecloths make good gifts.
Part IV: Central Spain: Madrid and Castile 
368

You may also want to look for local pottery and traditional blue-and-
yellow ceramics from Talavera.
Damascene and swords
You can find great hand-forged swords and daggers at Mariano
Zamorano, Calle Ciudad 19 (% 925-22-26-34), a small factory where the
craftsmanship is outstanding. Zamorano ships items pretty much any-
where in the world. Braojos, Arco de Palacio 5, and Comercio 44 (no
phone), is one of the top places in Toledo for damascene objects and
engravings. You won’t find cheap machine-made stuff at Casa Bermejo,
Calle Airosas 5 (% 925-22-03-46). You will, however, find a disciplined
team of artisans who, in addition to creating excellent gift items, also
crank out ornamental swords and military dress items for West Point
and the armies of several European countries. High-quality, hand-crafted
damascene jewelry is available at J.J. Simón Martín de la Fuente, Calle
Samuel Levi 3 (% 925-21-69-55), a small and friendly shop where you
can watch an artisan create intricate gold inlaid designs. If your tastes
are grander than the key chains, letter openers, rings, and earrings you
see everywhere in Toledo, check out Felipe Suárez, Paseo de los
Canónigos 19 (% 925-22-56-15). It has the entry-level goods, but its
damascene artisans also create unique and very pricey art objects.
Marzipan
Pastelerías Santo Tomé is at Calle Santo Tomé 5 and Plaza Zocodover 7
(% 925-22-37-63). Founded in 1856, Santo Tomé exports all over the
world. Casa Telesforo, Plaza de Zocodover 13 (% 925-22-33-79), is the
oldest of the old-time marzipan factories, churning out highly decorative
designs in sweet almond paste since 1806. Pastelería Casado, Cuesta del
Alcázar 11 (% 925-22-37-34), next to Plaza Zocodover, is a traditional
Toledan bakery that has been in business since the 1950s. Look for a gift
shop at the same address.
Living it up after dark
Toledo, noisy by day, really calms down after the tour buses leave. Early
evening is a perfect time to explore the city’s crooked streets and plazas.
Two blocks west of the Alcázar, at Calle Trastamara 21, is a secluded
patio with a trio of restaurants in an open-air patio. The best bar of the
bunch is El Corral de Diego Mesón. If you’re up for more than a walk
around town, start near Plaza Zocodover and Calle Alfileritos and drop
in on any of these tascas for tapas and drinks.
 La Abadía, Calle Núñez del Arce 1 (% 925-25-07-46), a stylish bar-
restaurant that serves a nice selection of foreign beers.
 Ludeña, Corral de Don Diego 10 (% 925-22-33-84), a centrally
located and popular tapas spot.
 La Venta del Alma, Carretera de Piedrabuena 35 (% 925-25-42-45),
housed in an ancient country house on the highway that leads from
the parador, is popular with an over-30 crowd.

Part V
Southern Spain:
Andalusia

In this part . . . 
W
hen most people close their eyes and dream of Spain,
the evocative images of Andalusia probably spring to
mind. The south is like an Iberian highlight ﬁlm with accom-
panying soundtrack: bullﬁghts in the searing sun, the passion-
ate staccato rhythms of ﬂamenco, and dark-haired beauties
with ﬂowers in their hair and polka dots on their twirling
dresses. The classic landscape of parched mountains, rolling
chestnut hills, and olive groves as far as the eye can see also
produces some of Spain’s quintessential savory treats: olive
oil, gazpacho, sherry, and robust green olives.
Andalusia has so much to see and do that you could spend a
lifetime there, not just a vacation. Its scenery includes stun-
ning Moorish monuments, such as Granada’s Alhambra and
Córdoba’s Great Mosque, sun-kissed white villages perched
on gorges and mountain tops, the sultry charms of legendary
Seville, and Spain’s most developed stretch of beaches.
Dismissed by some northern Spaniards as lazy hedonists,
Andalusians — true, no strangers to crowded tapas joints and
noisy bars — are unrepentant in their commitment to enjoy-
ing the riches of life in the south.

T
he southern region of Andalusia, or Andalucía, is a land of intense
summer heat, fiery Gypsy passion, and a sophisticated, if inscrutable,
Muslim past. In other words: romantic Spain. In their heyday, the Moors
(Arab and Berber conquerors of Spain) dominated almost all of Spain,
but their empire took deepest root in the south, the heart of their empire,
al-Andalus.
In Córdoba, the Moors built the Great Mosque, or Mezquita — which,
along with the Alhambra in Granada (see Chapter 17), ranks as Muslim
Spain’s supreme achievement and legacy. By the tenth century, Córdoba
had become Europe’s most advanced and populous city, a capital of high
culture and learning. Seville later became Spain’s leading light in the 16th-
century Golden Age, when riches from outposts in the Americas flowed
back through the city via the Guadalquivir River, and great artists like
Velázquez, Murillo, and Zurbarán created the flourishing Seville School.
The Old Quarter of each city is a pretty jumble of narrow alleyways lined
with tiled portraits of saints and Madonnas, potted plants and bougainvil-
lea, and refreshing interior patios. Seville is unmatched in Spain for ambi-
ence: It’s the kind of place where the scent of orange trees and the joy of
living, not just working, move people to lyrical odes. Córdoba is no longer
the great city it once was, but it remains a fascinating, living, historical
document. It’s known as the city of patios for its flower-bedecked interior
spaces, which are celebrated every May. Both cities continue to represent
Spain at its most folkloric. Popular religious and secular celebrations are
impossibly infectious, and the people are as radiant and nearly as warm
as the blinding sun that beats down.
That sun in southern Spain is going to make you sweat: Seville and
Córdoba are two of the hottest cities in Europe. Winter, though, is mild,
and spring and fall are warm but comfortable. The best time to visit
Seville and Córdoba is April and May, when flowers are in bloom and the

famous festivals, including Easter Week, possess the locals and trans-
form their cities (although this time is also the hardest to get a hotel
room). If you can’t make it then, fall and winter aren’t bad, because the
sun shines year-round. Unless you’re a masochist, you’re better off
avoiding the sizzling summers.
Seville and Córdoba are within easy reach of Madrid, especially with the
high-speed AVE train, which gets you to Seville in two-and-a-half hours
(Córdoba’s a stop along the way, one-and-a-half hours from Madrid).
Major Attractions in Seville and Córdoba
Seville and Córdoba form two of the three bases in Spain’s southern tri-
angle of Moorish influence (the other is Granada; see Chapter 17).
Seville
Conquered by the Romans and then the Moors, who ruled the city for
more than 500 years, Seville lived a grand Golden Age in the arts during
the 16th and 17th centuries, as the gateway to the Americas (and the
benefactor of all that loot flowing down its river). Plenty of that history
is on view, though the city’s greatest attraction is perhaps its easygoing
vibe and abundantly gregarious people that make it one of the most
charming cities in Spain.
You can get a taste of Seville in just a couple of days, but it’s the kind of
place that you may want to return to over and over. Seville is well known
for the following attractions: the cathedral, the world’s largest Gothic
edifice; El Alcázar, the fantastic fortress/royal residence where kings
and queens entertained lovers and enemies; Barrio de Santa Cruz, the
colorful, quintessential Andalusian neighborhood; Parque de María
Luisa (Maria Luisa Park), a green oasis, lush enough to beat the heat;
and Seville’s unrivaled spring festival season — Easter and April Fair.
Córdoba
You may find it hard to believe that Córdoba was once Europe’s most
enlightened and populated city. When the rest of the continent sank into
the Dark Ages, Muslim Córdoba soared ahead, with libraries, universi-
ties, mathematics, and sophisticated architecture and trade. But the city
in which Jews and Christians lived alongside the Moors saw its best
days long ago. Once a city of one million, the provincial capital today
has scarcely 300,000 inhabitants — one of the few cities in the world to
suffer so dramatic a population drop without an accompanying natural
disaster.
Córdoba’s former greatness, though, is instantly revealed when you slip
behind the walls of the Great Mosque and are suddenly enveloped by
one of the most awe-inspiring scenes in Europe: an unending horizon of
overlapped, candy-cane-striped arches. In addition to the Mezquita
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
374

(Great Mosque) — one of Muslim Spain’s great monuments — look for
the La Judería, the old Jewish Quarter of whitewashed streets, lively
bars, and artisans’ shops, and Córdoba’s spectacular flowered patios
and May festivals.
Seville: City of Festivals
One of the most exuberant cities in Spain, Seville (known as Sevilla in
Spanish) stimulates the senses. Boulevards are lined with orange trees,
church bells overlap with the clop-clop of horses’ hooves, and the smell
of fresh flowers permeates small alleys. Seville has inspired artists and
musicians like few other cities; from the art of passionate, soul-baring
flamenco to operas like Don Juan, Carmen, and The Marriage of Figaro,
Seville has always been a place to sing about.
Spain’s fourth-largest city and one of its most sunbaked, Seville never
seems in a hurry. Sevillanos have earned a reputation, deserved or not,
for working less and socializing more than those in any other region in
Spain. Locals love few things as much as gathering at bars with loud
groups of friends and family for drinks and tapas. As an outsider, you
may be inclined to believe that locals spend a good part of the day, and
a good portion of their salary, just hanging out. But natives tell you that
they simply know how to live better than the workaholics up north.
Perhaps it’s that attitude, as well as the languid air of Andalusia, that
makes foreigners adore Seville like few places in Spain. Americans are
the number one group of tourists in Seville, ranking ahead of Germans,
French, and Italians for the past decade. Along with Salamanca (see
Chapter 14), Seville is also the most popular place for American college
students to spend a semester or full academic year.
Getting there
Seville is accessible by air, train, and bus from all major points in Spain,
but in all likelihood you’ll cruise into Seville from another part of
Andalusia or from Madrid. The easiest way is to glide in on the superfast
AVE train, though if you’re hopping around Spain by plane, flying into
Seville is simple.
By train
Seville’s AVE and regular train station is Santa Justa, Av. de Kansas City,
s/n (% 902-24-02-02), just north of downtown. Major car-rental agencies
are all located at Santa Justa, so picking up a car after arriving in Seville
by train is a snap. Ticket and information offices for RENFE, Spain’s
national railway, are located at Calle Zaragoza 29 (% 902-24-02-02;
www.renfe.es). Buses C1 and C2 go from the rail station to downtown
Seville. A taxi costs about 6€ ($7.20).

Seville
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
376

Unless you’re coming from small towns in Andalusia, where train service
is infrequent, I recommend the more comfortable trains over buses,
especially in the heat of the south. The fastest and easiest way to get to
Seville from either Madrid or Córdoba is the AVE high-speed train. It’s a
little more expensive than slower trains, but oh how it sails. It makes the
trip to Seville, with stops in Ciudad Real and Córdoba, in about two-and-a-
half hours. The one-way fare from Madrid is 70€ ($84). The trip to/from
Córdoba takes about 45 minutes and costs 22€ ($26).
The AVE train from Madrid and Córdoba to Seville flies like a bird (not
coincidentally, because that’s what ave means in Spanish), and although
it’s the most expensive regular train service in Spain, it’s also one of
Europe’s fastest and most comfortable. Making the trip even more
tempting, certain trips and age categories can save you money on the
AVE. A round-trip ticket saves you 20 percent; a round-trip ticket for
travel on the same day saves you 25 percent. Children ages 4 through 11
get a 40 percent discount, and seniors get 25 percent off.
If you can’t catch the AVE, or if you want to save a few euros, hop aboard
an Altaria train (fast but not lightning fast like the AVE) from Madrid. It
takes a little more than three hours and costs 55€ ($66).
By plane
Seville’s international airport, the work of the famed architect Rafael
Moneo, is Aeropuerto Internacional San Pablo, Autopista de San Pablo,
s/n (% 95-498-82-07). The national airlines of several European countries
fly into Seville, and daily flights arrive on Iberia from Madrid, Barcelona,
Bilbao, and Valencia (Air Europa flies to Seville from Barcelona). The air-
port is 12km (7 miles) north of Seville, on National Highway IV. The
Tourism Information Office (% 95-444-91-28) is open daily from 9 a.m.
to 8 p.m.
From the airport to downtown, you can take an airport bus (% 902-
21-03-17; 2.10€/$2.50), a relatively short ride that goes to Alfonso XIII
Hotel, on Puerta de Jerez. A taxi from the airport to the zona centro
(anywhere near the cathedral) costs about 15€ ($18).
By bus
Seville has two major bus terminals: Estación Plaza de Armas, Av. del
Cristo de la Expiración, s/n (% 95-490-80-40), for travels throughout
Spain (including the province of Huelva); and Estación Prado de San
Sebastián, Calle Manuel Vázquez Sagastizabal, s/n (% 95-441-71-11), for
all other destinations in Andalusia. Alsina buses (% 95-441-88-11; www.

By car
Spain’s big cities aren’t great places to deal with wheels, so if you’re just
traveling to Seville (and Córdoba and Granada), and not planning on
touring the surrounding country, you could skip renting a car. Driving 
to Seville from Madrid, take the N-IV (E-5), which veers right (west) at
Bailén and passes through Córdoba. The easy trip is all highway from
Madrid, but it takes more than five hours, depending on stops and your
willingness to do as the Spaniards do and flout speed limits. The A-92
highway connects Seville with Granada and the Costa del Sol. For road-
side assistance, call % 900-12-35-05.
Orienting yourself in Seville
Seville is divided in two by the Guadalquivir River. The city’s historic
center, which includes the cathedral, Barrio de Santa Cruz, and just
about all the sights you want to see, is on the east side of the river.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Though Seville is a large and complex city, the neighborhoods of interest
to visitors are easy to get a handle on. The Old City grew up around 
the city’s major monuments, which are among the most important in
Andalusia: the Cathedral and Giralda Tower; the Reales Alcázares
palace-fortress; and, immediately to its east, the Barrio de Santa Cruz,
which is the ancient Jewish Quarter. Parque María Luisa, the major
green space in the city, is south of here.
The major avenues running through the Old City are Avenida de la
Constitución and Calle Sierpes. The zona centro, or modern center of
Seville, proceeds outward from the Old City. The working-class, thor-
oughly authentic barrio Triana is across the Quadalquivir River, as is 
La Cartuja, site of the 1992 World Expo. On the river’s banks is the Torre
del Oro, a 13th-century cylindrical defense tower and one of Seville’s
enduring landmarks that was once completely sheathed in glimmering
golden tiles (hence the name, meaning Tower of Gold).
Finding information after you arrive
The main Andalusia Tourism Information Office is located just down
the street from the Cathedral, Av. de la Constitución 21B (% 95-422-
14-04). You can find others at the San Pablo Airport (% 95-444-91-28)
and Santa Justa Train Station (% 95-453-76-26). They’re open daily from 
9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Municipal tourism offices are at Plaza de la Concordia, s/n,
in front of the Puente de Triana (% 902-19-48-97), Plaza de San Francisco
19 (% 954-59-52-88), and Paseo de las Delicias 9 (% 95-423-44-65).

Getting around Seville
Though Seville is large, the principal areas of interest to most visitors
make up a compact, walkable area. The Barrio de Santa Cruz, one of
Seville’s most enchanting neighborhoods, is almost entirely pedestrian.
Almost all the hotels I recommend are within walking distance of the
major sights. You really only need public transportation or a taxi to 
the airport or train station, or in the evening if you want to go over to
Triana, across the river, to check out the bars, restaurants, and live
music clubs there.
By taxi
Taxis usually line up on Avenida de la Constitución outside the cathe-
dral. You can also hail one anywhere on the street. To call a cab, call
Radio Taxi (% 95-480-00-00) or Tele-Taxi Sevilla (% 95-462-22-22).
By car
If you have time to explore the region, Andalusia is one of the best
places in Spain to rent a car and roll through the countryside or along
the coast (see Chapter 16). The major agencies in Seville are
 Avis, Av. de la Constitución 15 (% 95-444-91-22)
 Europcar, Av. Luis de Morales, s/n (% 95-425-42-98)
 Hertz, Av. República Argentina 3 (% 95-427-88-87)
 Thrifty, Fernando IV 3 (% 95-427-81-84)
By bus
You have little need to take a bus after you’ve arrived in Seville, although
it comes in handy for getting to the train station, Santa Justa (see “By
train,” earlier in this chapter). Bus nos. 32, C-1, and C-2 go between down-
town and the train station. For bus information, call % 955-99-92-90. A
single fare on the city buses costs 1€ ($1.20); a “Bonobús” pass good for
ten trips costs 5.15€ ($6.20).
Staying in style
Seville is one of the best places to stay in Spain. Several hotels positively
drip with local character and offer comparatively reasonable rates
(though prices across Seville have steadily crept up in the last few
years). All the hotels I recommend here are conveniently located within
walking distance of most major sites in the old center of romantic
Seville. (Several faceless international hotels are available as well, but
for the most part they’re removed from what you’re going to Seville to
see, and so I don’t include them.)
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 379

If you arrive in town without a reservation, check out INFHOR, a private
organization that has a kiosk in the Santa Justa train station and that
maintains relationships with several dozen hotels in Seville. They’ll
show you brochures, make suggestions in your price range, and then
call and make a reservation for you (at no cost to you; hotels pay a 
commission).
Note that prices rise significantly (as much as double) during Seville’s
famous Semana Santa (Holy Week) and Feria de Abril (April Fair) 
celebrations — basically, two weeks a year (see the “Fiesta time! Seville’s
popular festivals” box in this chapter). The high end of the rates in the
following section reflects those increases (but, because those rates dis-
tort the overall picture, I don’t base the dollar-sign ratings on those spe-
cial rates). If you intend on coming to Seville for either celebration, make
your reservations very early — as much as a year (that’s right, one year)
in advance, especially for the choicest spots that I mention in the hotel
listings.

Zona Centro
A boutique hotel that embraces Andalusia’s Moorish past, sometimes right
up to the edge of kitsch, this is the place to rest your head if you’re fond
of the Moroccan teahouse aesthetic. Next door to the Macarena Basilica —
a bit removed from some of the major sights in Seville — and a red-and-
white colonial facade is an explosion of brilliant Moorish color, textures,
and details. The 15 rooms are placed around a lovely central patio and
spiral staircase. Bathrooms are stucco and marble, and queen-size beds
are of carved wood and have beautiful and bold silk bedding. My favorite
rooms are Princesa Wallada, with a delightful painted Moorish ceiling and
four balconies, and Beatriz de Suabia, which may have you playing caliph
for a night. As a bonus, or perhaps a burden, if you like the furnishings, or
even the rugs, everything is available for purchase.

Hotel Alfonso XIII

Old City
This Old World classic will break the bank, but if you have a bank to break,
it’s the place to do it. The finest and most famous hotel in Seville, the his-
toric Alfonso XIII (Alfonso “treh-theh”) ranks right up there with Madrid’s
Ritz and Palace — one of Spain’s most distinguished and storied hostel-
ries. When Princess Elena got married in Seville a few years back, she and
the entire Royal Family stayed here. A beautiful, imposing structure with

the city’s most prestigious address, it has opulent halls with marble floors,
carved wooden ceilings, and Moorish arches and tiles. The 146 rooms are
appropriately regal, as are the gardens and magnificent pool, but this
indulgent palace isn’t for everyone. As the kind of place where the rich
and famous drop in and expect to be treated with deference, it seems a bit
stilted and snooty to me, but it’s undeniably luxurious. The Alfonso XIII is
a Westin and Starwood property — perfect for those who’ve earned a ton
of hotel points and want to blow them.

Hotel Apartamentos Casa Imperial
$$$$–$$$$$
Edge of Old City
Calling this impeccable retreat an aparthotel — a Spanish term that
implies cheesy kitchenettes and bad carpeting — seems absurd because
nothing is further from the truth. Sure, all rooms have small kitchens and
some have small living areas, but this is a refined version, and a great hotel
solution for people wanting space and privacy. With four plant-filled, inte-
rior patios, brilliantly tiled staircases, small pools and fountains that kids
will love, and boldly painted rooms, Casa Imperial is one of a kind. Near the
Casa Pilatos, this 15th-century palace (which incredibly belonged to the
butler of the Marquis of Tarifa) is charming and intimate with great per-
sonal attention. As hard as it is to believe that Casa Imperial lies in the
middle of bustling Seville, the hotel is perfectly in tune with the city’s
romanticism. Because the hotel is owned by a joint Spanish and German
initiative, the 24 apartments are popular with Germans.

Hotel Las Casas de la Judería

Secluded at the end of a small alley off the edge of the Santa Cruz neigh-
borhood — the former Jewish enclave, la Judería — this is one of the best
value hotels in Spain. But the secret’s out. The place is packed year-round,
so book a room early. The hotel occupies a 17th-century palace of the Duke
of Béja, the patron of Cervantes (the Duke actually owned a series of man-
sions here). The brightly painted palace — brilliant sevillano yellows,
whites, and blues — has a series of tranquil interior patios with gurgling
fountains. The 57 rooms are impressively appointed, and are all different
from one another. They have handsome antique furnishings, and many
have four-poster beds and small living rooms. Service is top-notch,

with yellow- and blue-trimmed windows are set back from the street on a

Recently purchased by the Epoque Hotel group — it was formerly owned
by the same people with the other “Casa” hotels in Seville — this luxury
boutique hotel has gotten an additional injection of chic style. In a resi-
dential neighborhood near the Casa Pilatos (see the review later in this
chapter), it’s just a tad removed from the tourist hordes but still within
walking distance of the cathedral and Santa Cruz district. The 41 spacious
and warmly appointed rooms have large, modern, marble bathrooms, and
a number of them feature living rooms. Rooms are on three levels around
a lovely central courtyard of this 18th-century converted mansion. And if
those views aren’t enough for you on a warm Seville day, try the ones from

warm and handsome small hotel (with just 12 rooms) opened in 2001; it’s

names like “El Emigrante” and “Gaditanas,” are lovingly decorated with-

Maestro’s music career and fascination with bullfighting fill the common

Luxury on the outskirts of town
If you’re willing to stay outside Seville, and if you’re in the mood for true Andalusian
luxury, Hacienda Benazuza is the place. In Sanlúcar la Major, about 16km (10 miles)
from Seville, this sprawling estate was an Arab country house in the tenth century and
then a luxurious farmhouse perched on a hill of olive groves. Today it’s one of the finest
hotels in Spain (with prices to match), a rustic palace with splendidly manicured gar-
dens, Moorish pools and fountains, and palm-tree-lined patios. The elegant guest
rooms overflow with Old World style and color. The Michelin two-star gourmet restau-
rant, La Alquería, is one of the best in the country and a true destination for gas-
tronomes, with spectacularly innovative dishes straight from the unique mind and
laboratory of Ferran Adrià of the famous El Bulli restaurant in Cataluña. Even if you
don’t stay here, a meal, although very expensive (tasting menu: 100€/$120), ranks as
perhaps the top dining experience in southern Spain. To get there from Seville, follow
the signs for Huelva and go south on the A-49 highway; take exit No. 6.

mansion that belonged to the poet J. Antonio Cavestany. The hotel fea-

coffee are served. The rooms, on the third floor of the mansion, are named
for places in Spain. They’re all top-of-the-line elegant, with rich fabrics,
bold flower patterns, and hot tubs, though each is different from the next
in configuration and decoration. As you may expect in a place so small,
the service is very personal and friendly. If that isn’t enough, the restau-

Dining out
The natural division in Seville is between restaurants that offer a sit-
down dinner and those that are more informal tapas (appetizer) joints.
At many of the latter, there’s no rule against sitting down — if you’re
lucky enough to score a coveted seat — but it’s an entirely different way
of assembling a meal. I love snacking my way across Spain, but the joy 
of eating at bars and restaurant counters and front rooms in Seville is
something special. Even the sit-down places have tapas bars in front, so
if you arrive at one and it looks dead or too pricey, go with Plan B, tapas.
For more on Spanish dining customs, including mealtimes, costs, and
tipping, see Chapter 2.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 385
Eating and drinking like a Sevillano
Fried foods, cold soups, and slightly chilled aperitif wines rule the day in all of
Andalusia, but particularly in Seville. The best way to beat the heat is with a cold bowl
of gazpacho, a chilled tomato soup. Pescaíto frito, deep-fried fish, is served in nearly
every bar and restaurant. As in Madrid, the pursuit of tapas and copas (all-hours
snacking and drinking, respectively) is a local institution, but Andalusians insist that
they invented the art of eating tapas. The tapeo (tapas crawl) in Seville and Córdoba
is a joyous affair like nowhere else in Spain. Andalusian aperitif wines — jerez (sherry),
from just south of Seville, and montilla (mohn-tee-yah), a splendid dry wine from
Córdoba — are superb.

Triana
ANDALUSIAN/SPANISH
This distinguished, sedate restaurant is a welcome find. It’s on the other
side of the river in Triana, where you’re more likely to find mass-market
fish restaurants and tapas bars. It has a clubby atmosphere, with deep red,
earthy walls, black beamed ceilings, red tile floors, and black-framed oil
paintings. Service is excellent and the food is prepared in simple, elegant
fashion, with such dishes as oxtail cannelloni and arroz de setas (similar
to mushroom risotto).

Taberna del Alabardero

Zona Centro
SPANISH
If you’re lucky enough to secure a coveted room at this tiny hotel
(reviewed earlier in this chapter), you can saunter downstairs to dine at
one of the city’s hottest restaurants. Even if you’re not sleeping here,
though, you can eat alongside the king, president, and just about every-
body else. In a sumptuous 19th-century palace with dark wood, mirrors,
and oil paintings, the restaurant boasts five dining rooms (four private, for
all those famous folks). The kitchen is the work of the owner, Luis Lezama,
who is also a priest, and the head chef, Juan Marcos. The menu is eclec-
tic, offering such delicacies as red fruit soup with mascarpone cheese,
Sanlúcar prawn carpaccio, lamb sweetbreads, and tournedos of fresh cod.
Every year in February, the restaurant celebrates its utter Spanishness
with semana de arroz — rice week, which glorifies the art of paella (a
casserole of rice, seafood, and meat). Though the restaurant has won a
national gastronomy prize and is one of the most ballyhooed restaurants
in Seville, I have occasionally felt it a little uninspired and stodgy.

Experiencing the best tapas bars
If you’ve been to other Spanish cities by the time you stroll into Seville
(or read the other dining sections of this book), you know that tapas are
a fundamental feature of the Spanish dining scene. But in Seville, tapas
amount to a joyous popular religion. They aren’t as fancy and filling as
they are in the Basque Country, but they’re hands down the best way to
get a handle on Seville. Feasting on tapas is also a great way to get to
know the charming, universally friendly Sevillanos who delight in noth-
ing as much as popping into bars — sampling squid, prawns, blood
sausage, and cured ham along with a great aperitif wine like a fino (dry
sherry) — and chatting up bartenders and newly made friends.
I’ve spent days in Seville without ever so much as sitting down to a
proper meal — but I always ate exceedingly well. Sevillanos often set out
on tapeos just prior to regular mealtimes and continue until midnight 
or later — basically, until the bars run out. Even breakfast (tostadas —
toast, with pate or sobrassada sausage spread) is just another excuse for
hitting tapas bars. Meals at tapas bars generally fall into the inexpensive
or moderate range ($–$$).

Kids are sure to love this form of eating (all snacking, all the time),
though you may have to pick and choose carefully among the tapas
(octopus and small fried fish that one eats whole, head and all, may not
go over so well).
The best way to dive into a Seville-style tapeo (tapas crawl) is to choose
a barrio, loosen your belt, and start eating. To wash it all down, ask for a
caña (kah-nyah, draft beer), a manzanilla (deliciously dry sherry), or a
vino tinto or vino blanco (red or white wine, respectively). Though tapas
bars are all over the city, I suggest only those from three neighborhoods
that are particularly ripe for snacking: Triana, Santa Cruz, and Zona
Centro.
In Triana
Tourists seldom visit this rambling neighborhood across the Guadalquivir
River. Too bad, because they’re missing some of Seville’s best tapas spots,
as locals well know. Check out these great tapas locations.
 Kiosco de las Flores, Betis, s/n (% 95-433-38-98), lost its decades-
old location wedged into the Triana Bridge; it’s now next door to
Rio Grande. A rarity, it has outdoor tables with terrific views. Locals
fill up on full raciones of jamón de Jabugo (see the “Hamming it up”
box, earlier in this chapter). But the fish is the specialty; try coquinas
(tiny sautéed clams), baby eels, or shellfish salad.
 La Albariza, Betis 6 (% 95-433-89-60), is down the street, the main
drag that lines the west side of the river, from Rio Grande. It has a
stand-up bar with black wine barrels as tables. The bar area is pure
Andalusian casual dining and is much more auténtico (authentic)
than the restaurant in back. Lean on a barrel and order up tortillitas
de camarones (yummy, tiny fried shrimp omelets), great, huge pick-
led olives, and fried boquerones (white anchovies).
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 389
Hamming it up
Spaniards are wild about ham; jamón serrano (cured ham) pretty much qualifies as a
national obsession. But Spaniards go absolutely crazy over pata negra (sweet cured
ham named for its source, the black-hoofed Iberian pig) and especially jamón de
Jabugo. Jabugo, a tiny town in the mountains of Andalusia, in the province of Huelva,
is famed for producing the most delectable cured ham in all Spain. Aficionados of
Iberian ham — dry and sliced razor thin — claim that jamón serrano is Spain’s great-
est delicacy. As such, it doesn’t come cheap; a ración (portion) of thin shavings of the
stuff can cost as much as 20€, or $24. Check out Casa Ruiz, Francos 59, a tapas bar
specializing in its own pata negra and other ham products (% 95-422-86-24).

 Río Grande, Betis, s/n (% 95-427-83-71), is a fancy full-scale
restaurant with a happening terrace scene overlooking the river.
Skip dinner and go for tapas instead — stick to the fish dishes.
 Sol y Sombra, Castilla 149–151 (% 95-433-39-35), evokes a taurino
(bullfighting) culture and serves delightfully earthy tapas. It’s a
good place for razor-thin cured ham, puntillitas (garlicky beef ten-
derloin), and blood-red Rioja wine. Closed for lunch Mondays and
Tuesdays and all of August.
In Santa Cruz
Seville’s cool old Jewish Quarter is a favorite of most visitors, and it’s a
good spot to tapas-hop in the early evening.
 Bar Giralda, Mateos Gago 1 (% 95-422-74-35), with old vaults that
once formed part of a Moorish bathhouse, is a famous student
hangout. Boisterous and hip Sevillanos come for pastel de puerros y
espinacas (leek and spinach pie) and pimientos rellenos (stuffed
peppers).
 Bar Modesto, Cano y Cueto 3 (% 95-441-68-11), a seafood restau-
rant, is more ramshackle than modest. Its lively downstairs tapas
bar is popular with Sevillanos and tourists alike. The famous dish
here is Tío Diego, a stir-fry of cured ham, shrimp, and mushrooms.
 Casa Román, Plaza de los Venerables 1 (% 95-422-84-83), is a loca-
tion that you’ll probably pass repeatedly. It’s perfect for a meat 
fix; try the chorizo (spicy pork sausage), serrano ham, and other
basics, such as a wedge of tortilla española (potato and onion
omelet).
 Hostería del Laurel, Plaza de los Venerables 5 (% 95-422-02-95),
also a small, historic hotel (see the box “Did Don Juan win the
bet?”), sets tables out in its delightful square. If you’ve pictured
yourself a Don Juan or Carmen, sipping sangria and savoring cured
meats, this place is tailor-made.
In Zona Centro (Central Seville)
The central, commercial district of Seville has too many tapas haunts to
keep track of. Check out the following, but if you see one with people
hanging about the bar and out the door, that’s all the information you
need to pop in and enjoy.
 Bodega Extremeña, San Esteban (% 95-441-70-60), is a dark,
atmospheric little place with hanging garlic and hams, near Casa
Pilatos. It has a range of cheap tapas, including morcilla al vino
(blood sausage soaked in sherry) and, for the really adventurous,
orejas en adobo. (I shouldn’t tell you, but that’s pig’s ears in
oregano and vinegar.)
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
390

 Casa Morales, García de Vinuesa 11 (% 95-422-12-42), just a block
back from Avenida de Constitución, is a fantastic old wine bar and
tapas joint that dates to 1850, and it looks like it hasn’t changed a
bit since then. You can get chorizo and other snacks to go with your
beer or wine, but the best thing to do is to go across the street to
La Isla, García de Vinuesa 13 (% 95-422-83-55), a fry stand where
you can pick up a newspaper full of pescaíto frito (tiny fried fish),
shrimp, or fish ’n chips (priced by the kilo) to take back to the bar.
(Morales is one of the only places I know that doesn’t have a prob-
lem with BYOT — Bring Your Own Tapas.)
 Entrecárceles, Faisanes 1 (no phone), just off Plaza del Salvador, is
a tiny nook of a place, but it’s hugely atmospheric, with hanging
hams, a wooden bar, an old wooden refrigerator, and walls with
peeling ochre paint. A tavern since 1894, it looks like a movie set,
though it has received a recent renovation. Tapas are written on a
chalkboard and on tiles. Try salmorejo (the thick Cordovan version
of gazpacho) with ham, pimientos rellenos de carne o bacalao (pep-
pers stuffed with meat or cod), or lomo al camembert (pork loin
with Camembert cheese).
 El Rinconcillo, Gerona 2 (% 95-422-31-83), may be a little out of
your way, but it has been a tavern since 1670, making it the oldest
tapas bar in Seville. The name means Little Corner. It has a gor-
geous wraparound wooden bar (on which bartenders tally your tab
in chalk), walls lined with gorgeous azulejos (ceramic tiles), marble-
topped tables, and tons of tapas. Popular with the locals, it features
a regular cast of characters around the bar. I can still taste the
espinacas con garbanzos (spinach with chickpeas).
Exploring Seville
You can cover almost everything you want to see in a first or second
visit to Seville — everything, in other words, that I outline here — on
foot (if you have a car, leave it in the hotel parking area). Seville is
loaded with monuments, cathedrals, and other sights, but as important
as any of those is the city’s special character — its hole-in-the-wall tapas
bars overflowing with boisterous patrons, fragrant orange trees, and the
unmistakable sounds of flamenco song and dance spilling out into the
street. Don’t be so intent on seeing the sights that you miss picking up
on what makes the city unique. Slow down, like Sevillanos do, and soak
up the atmosphere.
Keep in mind as you wander the city that the sun in Andalusia can be
scorching, with an average temperature of 32°C (90°F) in summer. I rec-
ommend setting out early in the day, so that you aren’t rushing around
to hit the sights between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is overhead.
Bring along a hat or cap and, especially in the summertime, remember to
slather on the sunscreen. Also bring bottled water to prevent dehydra-
tion, and take frequent breathers — tapas stops are good ways to duck
out of the sun — but watch your alcohol intake, because it acts as a
dehydrator. Your last defense? Fool-proof deodorant.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 391

The top attractions
Barrio de Santa Cruz
The labyrinthine Santa Cruz district, a Jewish ghetto in the Middle Ages,
became the fashionable neighborhood of Seville’s aristocrats and nobility
during the 17th century. The city’s most colorful neighborhood, Barrio de
Santa Cruz is Seville at its romantic best. Its winding whitewashed alley-
ways, with names like Gloria (Glory), Vida (Life), and Angeles (Angels), are
full of wrought-iron grilles, leafy plazas, and plant- and flower-filled patios.
The area remains picturesque despite the hordes of tour-guide-led groups
traipsing through speaking all major Indo-European languages. Work your
way along the barrio’s streets until you find the Plaza de Santa Cruz, a
pretty square with a Baroque cross at its center. South of the square are
the Murillo Gardens, strolling gardens along Menéndez Pelayo. The main
attraction within the Santa Cruz district is the Hospital de los Venerables
Sacerdotes (see review later in this chapter). Allow the better part of a full
morning or afternoon in Seville’s most picturesque neighborhood.
See map p. 376. Barrio de Santa Cruz begins just east of the Reales Alcázares; walk
through the small passageway that appears to be a part of the fortress. You pass
through a courtyard, the Patio de Banderas, and a small tunnel, and enter the streets
of Santa Cruz — beginning with the Callejón del Agua (Water Alley).
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
392
Did Don Juan win the bet?
In pop culture, a Don Juan is an irresistible stud, but it wasn’t always that way. In the
original story, written in the 1600s by Tirso de Molina (a priest who later received the
honor of having a Madrid neighborhood and, er, Metro stop named after him), the leg-
endary rogue roams Seville in search of willing — and unwilling — maidens. Don Juan
challenges a friend to see who can seduce more women in a calendar year. The rivals
meet up one year later to check their scorecards; Don Juan, with six dozen notches
on his belt, is declared the winner, but he can’t stop there. On a roll, he ups the ante,
claiming that in just six days he’ll seduce not only his rival’s fiancée, but also a nun.
Recall that a priest wrote the story of Don Juan. (Like he’s gonna get away with steal-
ing a nun’s virtue.) The rapscallion’s designs on Sister Doña Inés are the last straw for
God, who strikes Don Juan down and condemns him to a sinner’s life in hell.
Evidently that struck the 19th-century playwright José Zorilla as much too harsh a
penalty, and too dark an ending. In Hollywood fashion, he rewrote the story. In his ver-
sion, the rivals meet up at Hostería de Laurel in the Barrio de Santa Cruz (where you
can go today and test your pick-up lines). Don Juan announces his assault on the holy
church, but in the rewrite, he gets the girl (the one in the black habit) and rides off with
her to life everlasting. So guess which version lived on? Of course, the one with the
scandalous but happy ending.

Catedral and La Giralda
Zona Centro/Old City
Seville’s massive stone cathedral, built on the site of an ancient mosque,
left no doubts about Christian intentions in Andalusia. Begun in 1401 (and,
amazingly, finished only a century later), it was intended to make the
largest possible statement about Spain’s future religious and political rule.
Before going in, circle the exterior to get a good look at its rose windows
and Gothic flying buttresses. Enter through the Patio de los Naranjos (the
orange-tree courtyard, a holdover from the old Mosque, where worship-
pers performed their ablutions before entering to pray). Inside, the cathe-
dral’s an impressive sight, with incredible proportions, great art works,
and fantastic details in individual chapels. Don’t miss the Capilla Mayor
(Chancel) and its spectacular Retablo Mayor, an overwhelming altarpiece
(the world’s largest) of delicately carved gold leaf depicting the life of
Christ. Behind it is the Capilla Real (Royal Chapel), with an ornate dome,
the tombs of Alfonso X of Castile and his mother, Beatrice (Ferdinand’s
wife), and a Romanesque Virgin de los Reyes. The patron saint of Seville,
this last figure, is removed for the Feast of the Assumption every year and
paraded through the streets for her cult of followers. Other highlights
include the Tesoro (treasury), with works by Goya and Murillo, and the
showy 19th-century Monument to Columbus — a larger-than-life-size
coffin held airborne by the kings of Spain’s medieval kingdoms.
About the time the wrecking ball was smashing into the mosque previously
on the site of the Catedral, the builders reportedly said, “Let us build a
cathedral so immense that everyone, on beholding it, will take us for
madmen.” Those madmen went on to build the largest Gothic building in
the world and the third-largest church in Europe (after St. Peter’s in Rome
and St. Paul’s in London). Because of its size, plan on spending a couple of
hours getting lost in it (and climbing La Giralda, the tower — see the fol-
lowing review).
La Giralda, the brick minaret that originally stood tall as part of the great
mosque on this site, was given gradual makeovers throughout the cen-
turies and incorporated into the cathedral. Your admission ticket to the
cathedral allows you to climb the never-ending but, surprisingly, not-all-
that-taxing inclined ramp of the belfry/minaret. Horsemen used to ride up
the ramp to announce prayers, but you can go up just for the splendid
panoramic views, which kids are sure to enjoy. Stay up long enough to hear
the bells bong, and take your camera and a map of Seville so you can pick
out the tiny neighborhoods and monuments below — the vistas are pretty
incredible. The belfry, by the way, is named for its weather vane on top, a
statue of faith.

Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 393

Real Alcázar de Sevilla
Zona Centro
If you’re not going to Granada to see the Alhambra (see Chapter 17), this
jaw-dropping royal residence (plain on the outside but spectacular within)
is the next best thing. An awesome display of Mudéjar architecture
(Christian architecture employing Arab motifs and elements), it’s the kind
of place you can lose yourself in for hours. A UNESCO World Heritage Site,
and one of the oldest royal residences in Europe, it was built by master
craftsmen from Granada, and is awash in delicately carved arches, bril-
liant tiles, and heavenly ceilings. In 1364, Pedro I (also called Pedro the
Cruel) ordered its construction on a site previously occupied by a Roman
acropolis, a Moorish castle, and the first Moorish fortress in Spain. The
palace itself has an amazing history: A long line of monarchs married, gave
birth, had affairs, and ruled here; traitors and enemies met untimely ends
here; and Columbus and Magellan both came here to beg royal approval
for their expeditions.
Perhaps the finest rooms are the Apartamentos de Carlos V (Apartments
of Carlos V), decked out in gorgeous tapestries and tiles; the Salón de
Embajadores (Ambassadors’ Hall), crowned by a world-class carved
cupola of gilded wood; the Patio de las Doncellas (Patio of the Maidens),
with rich, intricate plasterwork that rivals the Alhambra; and the Patio de
las Muñecas (Patio of the Dolls), which is small, charming, and spectacu-
larly intricate. Look for two small faces, the dolls of the patio name, sup-
posedly carved into a column (don’t worry if you can’t find them; I never
have). The Moorish gardens are the equal of the sumptuous interiors, and
a perfect place to relax amid lush terraces and fountains. You need a
couple of hours at least to appreciate the intricacies of the buildings and
gardens here.

Royally cruel
Pedro the Cruel, who established his court in Seville, receives much of the credit for
creating the Alcázar, the gorgeous royal residence (though the structure was con-
siderably expanded and enhanced by later monarchs). But Pedro left his mark in other
ways — primarily blood stains. In the Hall of Justice, he murdered his brother, Don
Fabrique, who conducted a brazen affair with Pedro’s wife, Doña Blanca. On a differ-
ent occasion, King Cruel dispensed with his dinner guest, the Emir of Granada, but not
without first pocketing the Moor’s fantastic uncut ruby and other priceless jewels. But
what goes around comes around: Pedro was eventually assassinated by his own half-
brother, Henry the Magnificent.

Hospital de los Venerables Sacerdotes
Barrio de Santa Cruz
While in the Barrio de Santa Cruz, visit the Hospital for Venerable Priests,
a handsome old structure. It was founded in 1675 as an asylum for priests
and is flush with 17th-century Baroque art. The only way to see it, though,
is to join a tour that’s given in Spanish. The language isn’t really the prob-
lem; the guide I had was the least inspired, monotone bore I’ve seen. If you
don’t understand Spanish, you won’t miss anything (the pamphlet in
English gives you much more information anyway). The hospital chapel
has impressive frescoes by the Seville painter Valdés Leal.

Museo de Bellas Artes
Zona Centro
This handsome fine-arts museum, a mini-Prado, is almost worth a visit
even if you were to skip the art. A painstaking restoration has left this 17th-
century former convent in beautiful shape, and its peaceful open-air
patios, orange trees, and aged azulejos (ceramic tiles) are a great place to
view art. The collection is impressive: Many of Spain’s greats are here,
including works by the 17th-century Seville School’s Murillo, Valdés Leal,
and Ribera; Velázquez; and Zurbarán. Don’t miss Sala V (Room 5), a room
with frescoed domes and Murillo’s terrific angels and saints.

More cool things to see and do
Looking for something else to keep you and the kids busy while in
Seville? Check out the following ideas.
Cooling off in the shade
When Seville’s unrelenting heat begins to barbecue your brain, bolt for
(or more likely, stagger to) the park. The lushly shaded gardens of
Parque María Luisa, designed in the late-19th century along the
Guadalquivir River, are the best thing this side of a cold bath. (In the
dead of summer, you may be tempted to rip off your clothes and go
screaming into the fountain, but don’t — the punishing sun beats down
on the tiles as if they were the sands of the Sahara.) In spring, the acacia
trees and rose bushes are particularly fragrant, and the Arab-style foun-
tains and ponds, punctuated with floating swans, are extremely roman-
tic. Within the park is the Plaza de España; a massive semicircular
palace with decorative tiles commemorating each province in Spain, it
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 395

was built for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition. Though kids are
always captivated by this huge structure, it’s in a sad state of neglect.
(Many of the tiles that I took photos of 15 years ago, on my first visit, are
now chipped and faded.) Kids still enjoy rowing boats around the moat,
and water still springs from the fountain, but the plaza already seems
like a relic.
One of the best ways to visit the park is to hire a horse-drawn carriage
(see “Seeing Seville by guided tour,” later in this chapter), but if you’re
walking back to the center of town, take Avenida de María Luisa to San
Fernando. On the southwest corner, across from the gardens of the
Alcázar, is Seville’s university, which inhabits the Real Fábrica de
Tabacos (Royal Tobacco Factory). This factory is where the Gypsy
seductress Carmen, best known as the heroine of Bizet’s famous opera
set in Seville, rolled cigars along with about 10,000 other Andalusian
women. Presumably, they sang and danced all the while. You’re welcome
to take a stroll through and see the grandeur that came with a 19th-
century state tobacco monopoly.
Visiting Casa de Pilatos (Pilate’s House)
North of the cathedral, Pilate’s House, Plaza de Pilatos 1 (southeast sec-
tion of the Old City; 4 blocks west of Menéndez Pelayo; % 95-422-52-98),
is a superb, two-story, 15th-century Renaissance palace built by the
Marquis of Tarifa. Without doubt one of the finest homes in Seville, it’s
bursting with grand architectural and artistic treasures: Greek and
Roman busts, frescos, handsome painted ceilings, courtyard sculptures,
walls plastered with colorful glazed ceramic tiles, and a carved dome
Mudéjar ceiling over the staircase. My father’s fond of saying “They
don’t make ’em like they used to,” so I brought him here to prove him
right. Admission to the ground floor (patio and gardens) is 5€ ($6), to
the museum as well 8€ ($9.60); on Tuesdays admission is free from 
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Picking a side at the bullfights
Plaza de Toros de Maestranza (mah-eh-strahn-thah) is one of Spain’s
oldest, grandest, and most important bullfighting rings — the oldest is a
little farther south, in Ronda (see Chapter 16). It’s located at Paseo de
Cristóbal Colón 12 (intersection of Paseo de Cristóbal Colón and
Adriano, across from the river; % 95-422-45-77). Work started in 1761
and was completed 120 years later. Not round, but oval, the stark white
ring seats 14,000 people. As in all Spanish bullrings, you can buy the
cheap seats in the sol (sun) or the more expensive ones in the sombra
(shade). You’ll understand the price difference after you sit through a
bullfight in the intense Seville sun — you’ll be virtually dead in the after-
noon. Bullfights used to last all day, with 12 toros (bulls) meeting their
maker and almost as many horses. The steeds that brought in the pica-
dores (horsemen who jab the bulls around the neck and shoulders to
wear them down) didn’t wear protective gear until the 1920s, and many
were fatally gored. Today only bulls — six during every bullfight — are
slain.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
396

The bullring tour includes a visit to the museum (Museo Taurino), which
displays various flashy trajes de luces (suits of lights) worn by matadors,
photos of such bull aficionados as Ernest Hemingway, and paintings of
bull lore. You finish the group tour in the chapel, where the bullfighters
come to pray to La Macarena, the patron saint of toreros (yes, she of the
world-famous song and dance number). Admission is 4€ ($4.80); it’s
open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. (on bullfight
days, it’s open 9:30 a.m.–3 p.m. only).
The bullfighting season at la Maestranza begins the first week in April
and lasts through October, with fights taking place on various days of
the week (check ahead to be sure you’re in town on the right day). You
can download an advance schedule if you’ve got a matador of choice
(www.realmaestranza.com) or pick one up from the tourism office
when you arrive in Seville. Tickets are available at the box office or at
kiosks set up in major tourist districts in the center.
Discovering La Macarena!
Perhaps you remember the cheesy Spanish pop song “Macarena,” which
topped the charts all over the world back in the mid-90s. Believe it or
not, La Macarena’s more than just a participatory dance number. She is
one of Seville’s most revered Madonnas, a tearful patron saint of bull-
fighters, a favorite of Gypsies, and a legend when it comes to Holy
Thursday’s procession. You can see the colonial-looking Basílica de 
la Macarena, Calle Bécquer 1 (Puerta de la Macarena, intersection of
Muñoz León and San Luis; % 95-437-01-95), on the extreme northern
ring of the Old City (the fastest way to get here is to take a cab along the
outer ring: Colón to Torneo to Resolana Andueza). It’s a bit of a hike, but
if you’re at all fascinated by the cult of Madonna worship that’s espe-
cially strong in the south of Spain, a visit here is obligatory. You can visit
the Macarena museum, with its over-the-top processional floats of Our
Lady of Hope (her official name) — one’s covered in a forest of candle-
sticks, another is a shiny golden chariot. If you just want to see the
famous crying Virgin Mary, enter the church through the front door with
the faithful. Admission to the basilica is free; it costs 3€ ($3.60) to enter
the museum. Both are open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m.
Traveling into the past, magically
La Cartuja, across the river from Seville’s major downtown area, was the
site of the 1992 World Expo and a place that Sevillanos hoped would
develop into a major tourist attraction. Although the installations lan-
guished for a few years after the Expo, they’ve finally been put to work
as a theme park, and one with a 16th-century motif at that. Isla Mágica
(Magic Island) takes the little ones back in time.
Rides and show themes include the Amazon, Gateway to the Americas,
and El Dorado. The park also has a motion theater with seats that
shimmy and shake like the vehicles on the screen you’re ostensibly
piloting (it’s pretty cool and realistic — the kids will love it!). It’s located
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 397

at Pabellón de España, Isla de la Cartuja — across Puente de la Barqueta
Bridge; take bus C2 from the city center (% 95-902-16-17-16; www.isla
magica.es). Admission for adults, according to season, is 21€ to 24€
($27–$31) for the whole day or 15€ to 17€ ($19–$22) for the evening
only. Admission for children 5 through 12 years old and seniors ranges
from 15€ to 17€ ($19–$22) for the whole day, and 11€ to 12€ ($14–$15)
for the evening. Children under age 5 enter for free. The park is open
March through November daily from 11 a.m. to midnight in summer,
with reduced hours in other months.
Going to the hospital — for art’s sake
Hospitals are rarely tourist attractions, but hidden within Seville’s 17th-
century Hospital de la Santa Caridad (Hospital of Charity) is a splendid
Baroque chapel that is a minimuseum of art. Established to care for 
the destitute, infirm, and criminal, the hospital — built by a man on
whom the legendary character Don Juan was reportedly based — today
houses works by the painter Juan de Valdés Leal, including his famous
Postrimerías, the sculptor Pedro Roldán, and a dozen paintings by native
son Bartolomé Murillo, one of the greats of the Seville School. You’ll also
find a handsome altarpiece by Simón de Pineda. It’s located at Temprado
3 (% 95-422-32-32), and is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 7:30 p.m.; Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Admission is 4€ ($4.80).
Fiesta time! Seville’s popular festivals
Seville is renowned for its rituals and celebrations during Semana Santa
(Holy Week), just before Easter, and Feria de Abril, the April Fair that
erupts two weeks after Easter. During these two weeks, Seville is the
most festive and spectacular place in Spain, overflowing with vibrant
color. But if you’re not in the mood for crowds, packed hotels, inflated
prices, and religious ceremonies, plan to be somewhere else.
Semana Santa
Holy Week (the week before Easter) is one big march of processions
throughout the city. Assemblies of men carry flower-bedecked,
Madonna-topped floats on their shoulders. Penitents in long robes and
pointy hoods accompany them — to an American, the uncomfortable
visual reference is the KKK (though fortunately, these folks have differ-
ent things on their minds). Mournful dirge music and candles complete
the somber, almost spooky mood. Processions go on all week, but the
best days are Holy Thursday and Good Friday. Thursday night is pretty
spectacular — parades pass hourly. Don’t miss La Macarena — not the
dance, but the patron saint of bullfighters (see “More cool things to see
and do,” earlier in this chapter) — or El Gran Poder. Macarena returns
to her Basilica on Friday around 1 p.m. Pick up schedules of proces-
sions, particularly the pamphlet “Sevilla en Semana Santa,” from the
tourism office.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
398

Feria de Abril
After the somber expressions of faith during Holy Week, Seville explodes
during its annual April Fair, a festival of flamenco and sevillana dancing,
drinking, horse parades, and wonderful costumes. Andalusian women,
from little girls to elegant older ladies, are decked out in gay, brightly
colored, and often polka-dotted flamenco dresses. Men, atop fine
Andalusian horses, look like gentlemen ranchers, with their broad-
brimmed hats. The roots of the party are in fact agricultural — it accom-
panied annual livestock auctions in the mid-19th century. The alegría
(joy) is contagious, and it lasts all week.
Rocking El Rocío
One of Spain’s most spectacular expressions of religious faith is the El
Rocío pilgrimage, which takes place at the end of May in the province of
Huelva (near Almonte and the Parque Nacional de Doñana), west of
Seville. It’s like a rowdy religious rave. Accompanied by flutes and tam-
bourines, thousands of the devout travel on foot, on horseback, and in
oxen-led carriages to the Almonte marshlands. The faithful, donning
their best flamenco duds, take flowers and wax figures to worship at the
Our Lady of El Rocío sanctuary. When the float of la Virgen del Rocío —
the Virgin of the Dew — passes, mayhem erupts as everyone tries to lay
a hand on her and be touched by her saintliness. For more information
on this festival, see www.andalucia.com/festival/rocio.htm.
To find out this year’s dates for Semana Santa (Easter), Feria de Abril
(April Fair), and the El Rocío pilgrimage, contact the tourism office or
visit the Web sites www.andalucia.com and www.sevilla.org.
Seeing Seville by guided tour
Sevilla Walking Tour offers complete walking tours of the city, leaving
daily at 2:45 p.m. from the Tourist Information Office on Avenida de la
Constitución. Tours cost from 9€ to 18€ ($11–$22).
You can choose from two sightseeing bus tours in Seville. Sevirama 
(% 95-421-60-52) has stops at the Torre del Oro, Plaza de España, and
Isla Mágica. It’s one of those open-top, get-on-and-get-off buses. Sevilla
Tour offers multilingual tours in buses designed to look like trolley cars
(% 902-10-10-81). A ticket is good for 24 hours, and you can pick up the
bus at Torre del Oro, Plaza de España, Isla Mágica, and Cartuja (the Expo
’92 site).
Among specialty tours are Cruceros Turísticos Torre del Oro (river
cruises down the Guadalquivir), Paseo Alcalde Marqués del Contadero,
s/n, at the Torre del Oro (% 95-456-16-92), and Toros Tours (% 95-566-
42-61), organized visits to see Spanish bulls and horses outside of the
ring.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 399

You can’t miss the horse-drawn carriages lined up outside Seville’s
cathedral. They’re a very popular way to clip-clop around Seville, and
this attractive, romantic city is one of the most enjoyable places in Spain
to get off your feet and behind a horse. If you’ve thought about it in
other places such as Córdoba and haven’t hopped aboard, Seville is the
place to do it, especially if you have your sweetie by your side. Fares are
posted and are nonnegotiable (unless you find a rogue driver); they run
about 25€ to 30€ ($30–$36) for an hour (and more during the high-
demand season, Holy Week, Easter, and the April festivals). Besides the
stop in the plaza fronting the cathedral, there are stops in María Luisa
Park, Plaza del Triunfo, Plaza Virgin de los Reyes, and Torre del Oro.
Shopping in Seville
Seville’s a joy for shopping hounds — as much for the pleasure of
strolling the streets as for the typically Andalusian goods that make
great gifts.
Best shopping areas
The principal shopping districts are Barrio de Santa Cruz, for artisan’s
shops, antiques, and trinkets, and Zona Centro (center, just north of 
the cathedral tower) — particularly the pedestrian streets Sierpes and
Tetuán, where you can find traditional guitar, ceramics, and flamenco
dress shops as well as a wide array or modern clothing stores. The area
west of the cathedral, El Arenal, is packed with cool little antiques shops,
as are Mateos Gago and Rodrigo Caro in Santa Cruz.
What to look for and where to find it
Look for hand-painted ceramics, old azulejos (glazed ceramic tiles),
antiques, and, for women who want to play the part of charming sevillana
seductress, fans, embroidered shawls, and colorful flamenco dresses.
You have to depend on your feet or taxis to get around Seville. Map out
where you want to go; if anything looks too far (more than 5 blocks,
say), hop in an inexpensive, air-conditioned taxi. And remember that
shops are closed for long lunch breaks, often from 1:30 to 5 p.m. If you
must shop at midday, head to El Corte Inglés department store (on
Plaza Duque de la Victoria), which doesn’t dare close or turn off the
mega-watt air-conditioning.
Antiques
Run by a gregarious sevillano family, Felix e Hijo (Felix and Son . . . and
daughter and in-laws), Av. de la Constitución 20 (% 95-422-33-34), deals
in classical archaeological finds: Greek vases, Egyptian masks, and
Roman mosaics. Not everything is impossibly expensive and impossible
to lug home — you may just find an affordable piece that crystallizes
Andalusia’s storied past. And if you do find one, Felix also arranges ship-
ping. Mari Carmen, Felix’s daughter, runs Felix, Av. de la Constitución 26
(% 95-421-80-26), specializing in antique Andalusian posters — of the
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
400

April Fair, bullfights, and hard-to-find Deco advertising posters. The old
posters of Semana Santa and Feria de Abril are particularly fetching with
affordable prices to match.
Baked goods from on high
For pastries from heaven, check out what the nuns are baking. At
Convento de San Leandro, Plaza de San Ildefonso 1 (% 95-422-41-95),
the sisters sell yemas de San Leandro (egg yolk candies). You can get all
kinds of airy pastries, some made especially for the Christmas holidays,
at Convento de Santa Inés, Doña María Coronel 5 (% 95-422-31-45), and
jams and marmalades at Convento de Santa Paula, Santa Paula 11 
(% 95-442-13-07). During the month of December, visit the Palacio
Arzobispal (Archbishop’s Palace), Plaza Virgen de los Reyes across from
the cathedral (% 95-422-48-08), for a stupendous selection of dulces
navideños (Christmas sweets).
Books
One of the largest sources of international books is Vértice, San
Fernando 33 (% 95-421-16-54). Three guesses as to what’s sold at
English Bookshop, Marques de Nervión 70 (% 95-465-57-54). If you
need a traveling fix, check out the selection of novels and travel books,
which are all in the English language.
Ceramics
El Postigo, Arfe, s/n (% 95-421-39-76), has one of the largest stocks of
hand-painted ceramics in Seville with a selection of pottery, planters,
and other patio-perfect pieces. You can find good, nontouristy ceramics
across the river in Triana; have a look at two shops on Calle Antilliano
Campos: Cerámica Terra (no. 3) and Cerámica Rocío (no. 8). For hand-
painted vases, tiles, and plates with historic Andalusian patterns, check
out Martian Ceramics, Sierpes 74 (% 95-421-34-13). The selection’s
good, although not out of this world.
Crafts
Artesanía Textil, Sierpes 70 (% 95-456-28-40), is a great place for hand-
woven Andalusian blankets, table linens, and shawls. El Bazar del
Barrio (The Neighborhood Bazaar), Mateos Gago 24 (% 95-456-00-89), a
cute shop in the Santa Cruz district, has everything from antique azule-
jos (glazed ceramic tiles) to watercolors of bullfighting scenes. The
items are more carefully selected than those you find in souvenir shops.
Department stores
El Corte Inglés, Plaza Duque de la Victoria 10 (% 95-422-09-31), is the
megastore that dominates Spain like a fortress on the plains; you can get
anything from flamenco dresses, dishes, and vacuum cleaners to shoe
polish and CDs of flamenco artists.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 401

Fashion
Zara, Plaza Duque de la Vitoria 1 (% 95-421-48-75), something akin to
the Galician incarnation of Banana Republic, has affordable and hip fash-
ions for men, women, and kids. (The menswear Zara is up the street at
Calle Tetuán.) One of the hottest names in Spanish fashion is Victorio &
Lucchino, Sierpes 87 (% 95-422-79-51). The pricey dresses, skirts, and
shawls by this Andalusian design couple are Spain’s version of Dolce &
Gabbana, but more elegant and sophisticated.
Flamenco dresses and fans
You can find cheaper trajes sevillanos (flamenco dresses) and shawls in
almost any souvenir shop, but you won’t find any more exquisite than
the hand-embroidered numbers at Angeles Berral, Pajaritos 7 (% 95-
456-31-30), a small, personalized shop just a few doors down from Casa
Pilatos. They’re extremely elegant and tasteful (and pricey). Pilar Vera,
Rivero 2 (% 95-422-81-53), has designed classic flamenco dresses and
accessories for women for more than two decades, while generations of
Sevillanas have gone to Perdales, Cuna 23 (% 95-421-37-09), for the per-
fect, body-hugging costume to wow ’em at the April festivals (see the side-
bar, “Fiesta time! Seville’s popular festivals,” earlier in this chapter). The
outfits aren’t cheap (and I have a hard time figuring out when would be
the right moment back home to wear one . . .), but if you need a showy
number to go with your castanets and fan, this is the place. Don’t forget
the color-coordinated shoes. Casa Rubio, Sierpes 56 (% 95-422-68-72),
has a terrific selection of fans, from fancy hand-painted numbers to
modern functional items that can keep you cool in the wicked Seville heat.
Flea markets
Los hippies is what locals call these flea-market locations for leather
goods, hippie fashions, costume jewelry, and heavenly junk. Wednesday
and Thursday it’s at Rioja and Plaza Magdalena; Friday and Saturday in
Plaza del Duque. On Thursdays, check out “El Jueves,” the most tradi-
tional market in Seville, on Plaza Feria and Alameda, for antiques, paint-
ings, and furniture.
For the ranch
For more than 20 years, Arcab, Paseo de Cristóbal Colón 18 (% 95-422-
34-64), has been a sturdy place to get a hand-tooled saddle, riding boots,
and other items related to the majestic Andalusian horse (or your regu-
lar old Texas steed). For riding saddles, boots, spurs, buckles, blankets,
leather pouches, and more, try San Pablo, Calle Murillo 9 (% 95-422-
56-34). This family-owned place has dealt in equestrian accessories for
half a century.
Music
Allegro, Dos de Mayo 37 (% 95-421-61-93), just beside the Teatro de la
Maestranza, specializes in classical music. It also has a top-notch selec-
tion of Spanish music, including flamenco and zarzuela. You can give a
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
402

listen before buying. Sevilla Rock, on Alfonso XII 1, is the place to come
for CDs for your rental car or musical souvenirs of Andalusia. You can
find the latest in Spanish pop-flamenco or the deep-throated cante hondo
stuff (like an anthology of the great singer Camarón de la Isla).
Feeling the rhythm: Seville’s nightlife
You don’t want to miss the fun on a sultry Seville night. Top choices
include the following.
 A rousing professional flamenco tablao (performance)
 Outdoor cafes and bars (either near the cathedral or along either
side of the river) for people watching, tapas munching, and libation
quaffing
 Live, combustible music, with rhythmic hand-claps, cries of ¡olé!
and a palpable sense of community, at clubs where you see locals
get down and dirty, performing sevillanas (an informal gathering of
singing, music, and dancing)
For listings of what’s on and what’s going down, check out El Giradillo, a
free publication that contains a detailed monthly list of Seville’s nightlife
options, exhibitions, and other goings-on (available at tourism offices
throughout the city).
Die-hard aficionados of flamenco can plan their visit to Seville to coin-
cide with the annual Bienal de Flamenco. During September and the
first week of October, the city hosts a daily surfeit of flamenco-related
dance, music, and theater. For additional advance information and a pro-
gram schedule, see www.bienal-flamenco.org. Make sure you pur-
chase your tickets in advance (at the Lope de la Vega box office or by
calling % 95-459-28-70), because most shows sell out (and hotels are
difficult to come by as well).
Catching a flamenco show
El Arenal, Rodo 7 (% 95-421-64-92; www.tablaoelarenal.com), pro-
duces one of the best flamenco song and dance shows in Seville. In the
back room of a 17th-century building with small tables, the place and
performances practically shout passionate Andalusia. Shows are 34€
($41; dinner and show, 66€/$79); there are two “passes” every night, at
8:30 and 10:30 p.m. El Arenal is located between Dos de Mayo and
Varflora, near the bullring and Paseo Colón.
Dressed up like a Seville patio, El Patio Sevillano, Paseo de Cristóbal
Colón 11 (% 95-422-20-68; www.elpatiosevillano.com), popular with
large tourist groups, forsakes the intimate, flamenco-focused program
for one with exotic costumes and a wide range of Spanish music and
dance. Two shows are performed nightly (7:30 and 10 p.m.; 32€/$38). It’s
near the Maestranza Bullring, on the east side of Guadalquivir River.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 403

Los Gallos, Plaza de Santa Cruz 11 (% 95-421-69-81; www.tablaolos
gallos.com), has been around since 1966 in the heart of the old Jewish
Quarter, Barrio de Santa Cruz. It’s unapologetically touristy, but the fla-
menco is pretty authentic, and the place is lively and intimate. Visitors
love it, and you may even find a local or two in attendance. There are
two shows daily (32€/$38), at 8 and 10:30 p.m. It’s 2 blocks south of
Ximénez de Enciso, along Santa Teresa.
Concert performances focusing on young flamenco artists and nuevo 
flamenco are held at Sol Café Cantante, Sol 5 (% 95-422-51-65), in the
old Sala Talía (near Plaza Los Terceros). Shows are Thursday through
Saturday at 10 p.m. (12€/$15).
Clapping along to sevillanas
Casa Anselma, Pagés del Corro 49 (no phone), on the west side of the
river, rocks with communal singing and camaraderie. Either get here
obscenely early to get a table or come around midnight, when it starts 
to get really steamy — and packed. The garrulous owner, Anselma, is a
local institution and quite a singer herself. To get there, take a taxi; Casa
Anselma is 4 blocks back from Betis in Triana on the west side of
Guadalquivir River.
Along the river, an area packed with bars and great little places for an
evening tapeo is Lo Nuestro, Betis 31-A (% 95-472-60-10), where locals
do their thing — sing and dance and drink. To get there, walk across San
Telmo Bridge toward the Triana neighborhood; take the first right past
the bridge, on the main street facing the river. The bar’s about halfway
down on the right side.
Making it a night at the opera
Seville’s fancy, newish opera house, Teatro de la Maestranza, Paseo de
Cristóbal Colón 22 (% 95-422-33-44; www.teatromaestranza.com), is

Catching flamenco fever
Flamenco fever flows through Seville. If you’ve been to see a flamenco troupe and
want to discover how to stomp your heels dramatically and twirl your arms seduc-
tively, maybe a dance class is in order. Estudio de Baile Mario offers classes in 
flamenco, danza española, and sevillanas Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. The studio is on Procurador 20 (% 95-433-89-14). Taller
Flamenco offers four-day music and dance classes in small groups. They’re on Siete
Revueltas 5 (% 95-456-42-34; www.tallerflamenco.com). The Cristina Herren
Flamenco Foundation, Fabiola 1 (% 95-421-70-58; www.flamencoheeren.com),
offers intensive, and expensive, dance courses for those who are serious about learn-
ing (all levels available).

the place to catch a Seville-inspired production of Carmen, The Marriage
of Figaro, or The Barber of Seville. Also look for jazz concerts and recitals
here. The box office is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. As you
face the Guadalquivir River, the opera house is halfway between the San
Telmo and Isabel II bridges.
Enjoying the theater
On the northern edge of María Luisa Park is this handsome theater,
Teatro Lope de Vega, Av. de María Luisa, s/n (% 95-459-08-53/5), which
brings some of the best productions to Seville — from García Lorca’s
The House of Bernarda Alba to rousing flamenco shows and theater.
Productions are in Spanish only (but that doesn’t appear to stop large
contingents of foreign visitors from attending). It’s near the intersection
of Menéndez Pelayo, Avenida de Isabel la Católica, and Avenida de
Portugal.
Surviving Seville’s bar scene
For a full roster of tapas bars, a superb way to spend an evening in
Seville, see “Dining in Seville,” earlier in this chapter. Plaza del Salvador is
always hopping with jaleo (commotion). The tiny bars there (La Antigua
Bodeguita and Los Soportales) spill out into the square, where there are
rickety little tables and lots of beer-drinking, good-natured, good-looking
young people; the scene looks remarkably like a college party.
Abades, Abades 13 (% 95-422-56-22), is a pub in the guise of a con-
verted 19th-century Barrio de Santa Cruz mansion. This is lounge cul-
ture at its finest; slip into the rich living room and decadent ambience
and enjoy a cocktail with other stylin’ folks. To get there, take Mateos
Gago east of the cathedral and turn left on Abades. Perched on the
banks of the Guadalquivir, Bar Capote, Paseo de Cristóbal Colón 11 
(% 95-421-41-20), is the place to down a few cocktails in the open air
and dance when a señorita or caballero (gentleman) catches your eye.
It’s next to the Maestranza Bullring, facing the river.
At Bar Quitaspesares (also called Taberna Peregil), Plaza Padre
Jerónimo de Córdoba 3 (% 95-421-89-66), proprietor Pepe Peregil is 
so gregarious it’s contagious. His bar is packed with young and old, and
a group usually gathers in back with guitars and voices in full swing.
Young women often get up and show off their sevillana dance moves.
Pepe’s place is a little removed from the city center near the Church of
Santa Catalina. To get there, take Martín Villa (which becomes Laraña)
east off of Sierpes, all the way to Plaza Ponce de León, just west of the
plaza that the bar is on. Take a taxi there and back; walking is way too
far. (Nearer to the center of town is Pepe’s son’s bar, La Goleta, on
Mateos Gago 20, in Barrio de Santa Cruz.) Casa Morales (García de
Vinuesa 11; % 95-422-12-42) makes a great watering hole as well. It’s 
an evocative mid-19th-century tapas bar, with huge casks of wine and
cement floors — the kind of place where the barkeep writes your tab in
chalk on the bar top.
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 405

Side trips from Seville
A great if rather pricey way to get out of town is to board the Al Andalus
Expreso, a vintage luxury train whose 12 cars are straight out of the
1920s, and set out for the highlights of Andalusia. Along the way, you pass
(in air-conditioned luxury) through the south’s spectacular scenery —
dry, rugged mountains and rolling olive groves. The Seville-to-Seville
round-trip pulls into Córdoba, Granada (see Chapter 17), and two of
Andalusia’s famed pueblos blancos, or white towns, Ronda and Jerez
(see Chapter 16). You dine aboard in the luxurious dining car or in fine
restaurants (frequently paradores). The price includes meals with wine,
tours, visits, transfers, and taxes, but traveling in such princely style
doesn’t come cheap. Prices for six-day, five-night trips range from 2,700€
to 3,800€ ($3,240–$4,560) per person (depending on cabin type) for the
Seville round-trip. The train hits the tracks from March to October, skip-
ping the extremely hot months of July and August. Visit the Web site,
www.alandalusexpreso.com, or contact your travel agent or Marketing
Ahead, a Spanish travel specialist in New York, at % 800-223-1356 or
212-686-9213; Fax 212-686-0271; www.marketingahead.com. If a fancy all-
inclusive train’s not your style, try one of the following recommended
side trips.
Itálica: The Roman ruins
Before the Moors and the Visigoths, the Romans ruled Andalusia. The
ruins of the Roman city of Itálica, which was founded in 206 B.C., are so
close to Seville (10km/6 miles to the northwest) that you can almost
walk there. Two of the most famous emperors of the Roman Empire,
Trajan and Hadrian, were born in Itálica, and the city was one of the
Empire’s most important. The main feature is the elliptical amphitheater,
which held 25,000 spectators and was the largest the Romans built. The
town had about 10,000 inhabitants at its height. Excavations are ongo-
ing, and Roman mosaics continue to be unearthed and transported to
the Seville Archaeological Museum. In summer, concerts and dance festi-
vals are held here — an evocative bit of staging.
To get there by car, take Highway N-360 in the direction of Mérida. By bus,
take the Santiponce bus that leaves from Calle Marqués de Parada near
the Santa Justa rail station. Call % 95-599-73-76 for more information. 
The site is open April through September, Tuesday through Saturday from
8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.; October through
March, Tuesday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is 1.50€ ($1.80), free for E.U. citizens.
Carmona: A crossroads of cultures
Carmona, a pretty, ancient walled city on a plateau an hour from Seville,
has narrow whitewashed streets, a number of handsome, noble
Renaissance homes, and a handful of churches and convents. It also has
three Moorish fortresses. Carmona’s fame rests on its reputation as one
of the oldest inhabited places in Spain (Phoenicians and Carthaginians
preceded the Romans). It has two landmark gates — the Puerta de

Area Code
Seville’s area code is 95, which you must
dial before every number.
ATMs/Currency Exchange
You can find banks and ATMs along the
main drag in the centro, Avenida de la
Constitución, just behind the cathedral, and
on Plaza Nueva.
Embassies/Consulates
Many Western countries have consulates
in Seville: Australia’s is at Federico Rubio 14
(% 95-422-09-71); Ireland’s is at Plaza
Santa Cruz 6, Bajos A (% 95-421-63-61);
and the United States’ is at Plaza Nueva
8–8, second floor (% 95-421-85-71).
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 407
Sevilla and Puerta de Córdoba. Have a peek at the Gothic Iglesia de
Santa María, too. But the town’s best sight may be the cool Roman
Necropolis (% 95-414-08-11; Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–2 p.m.;
admission free), where 1,000 former citizens are buried in underground
tombs carved out of rock. Look for the impressive Elephant and Seville
tombs. The necropolis is on the outskirts of town and clearly sign-
posted. You can hit it on the way into or out of town.
Carmona is 32km (20 miles) east of Seville. If you’re coming into Seville
from Córdoba (or, of course, going on to Córdoba from Seville), it’s an
easy stopover — just follow the signs from the N-V highway.
With its two superb hotels, Carmona is also a great place to overnight.
The Parador Alcázar del Rey Don Pedro, Alcázar, s/n (% 95-414-10-10;
www.parador.es), one of the best in the parador system, inhabits a
beautiful 14th-century Moorish alcázar, or royal residence, and is stun-
ningly evocative of Andalusia’s Arab past. It has an Alhambra-style patio,
public rooms adorned with tapestries and antiques, an inviting pool, and
breathtaking views of the countryside. Rooms are spacious and very
handsomely decorated in classic style; a double costs 140€–150€
($168–$180). A step up from the parador, in both luxury and cost, is the
superb Parador de Carmona, Plaza Lasso 1 (% 95-419-10-00; www.
casadecarmona.com), a Relaix and Châteaux property in a 1561 palace,
the oldest surviving mansion in Carmona. This sumptuously designed and
elegant hotel — which very much looks the part of a Renaissance palace
with Mudéjar (Arab-Christian) details and four interior courtyards — is
one of the finest in Spain. The rooms are warm, cozy, and luxurious, 
with beautiful antiques and fabrics, and each evokes a different era of
Andalusian history. The massive, over-the-top Suite Azul is fit for a king.
The slender pool is very much in character with the region’s Moorish
architecture, and the restaurant is exquisite — well worth making a reser-
vation at even if you’re not staying the night. For this kind of luxury and
exclusivity, prices are not at all outrageous: doubles are 90€ to 180€
($108–$216) and 200€ to 240€ ($240–$288) during Feria de Abril, Easter
and Christmas week.

Internet Access/Cybercafes
Seville, with its throngs of foreign students,
has several places where you can surf the
Web on good machines. Web surfing gen-
erally runs about 2€ to 3€ ($2.50–$3.85) per
hour. Check into Seville Internet Center,
Almirantazgo 2 (second floor, corner of
Avenida de la Constitución; % 95-450-
02-75), which is usually packed with study-
abroad students. Open from 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday, and Saturday
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., it’s
across from the cathedral. Another place 
to check out is Cyber Olé, an Internet cafe
with art exhibitions, San Jancinto 74 (no
phone). Work Center, San Fernando 1, at 
the corner of Avenida de la Constitución
(% 95-421-20-74), is a 24-hour copy center
with about a dozen Internet terminals.

Raza 4 (% 95-461-56-95).
Maps
The Tourism Office distributes city maps
that are sufficient for most visitors.
Additionally, you can check with the tourist-
oriented shops right around the cathedral.
Police
For a police emergency, call % 091
(national) or % 092 (local). The municipal
police station is at Av. de las Delicias 15
(% 95-461-54-50). The national police office
is located at Av. Blas Infante 2 (% 95-428-
93-00).
Safety
Locals aren’t reticent about issuing safety
warnings, which you need to take seriously.
Seville has earned an unenviable reputation
for having talented thieves who can spot a
rental car with helpless tourists at the
wheel at more than 100 paces. If you must
park your car anywhere other than a
guarded hotel parking garage, don’t leave
anything of value in it — no cameras, no
passports, nothing. Seville, still part of the
poorest region in Spain, is also one of
Spain’s biggest tourist draws. Be vigilant in
Seville, especially at night. Carry only the
amount of money you expect to spend (or
don’t mind losing) that day, and keep it in

around the Santa Cruz district late at night
(despite the blistering sun, it’s preferable to
do your sightseeing there during the day).

Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 409
Córdoba: A Glorious Past
Though the Romans founded Córdoba, which became the largest city of
their Iberian empire, even greater glories were in store. The Moors cap-
tured Córdoba in A.D. 711, and, while the rest of Europe foundered, the
city thrived under the North African Muslims. In Córdoba, the Moors
built the Mezquita, or Great Mosque, one of the greatest monuments in
Spain.
Córdoba was not only the independent caliphate (the office of the
caliph, who served as the spiritual head of Islam) of the Moors and the
spiritual and intellectual center of Western Islam, but also a place where
Muslims, Jews, and Christians lived side-by-side. Córdoba’s delightful
Barrio de la Judería, the old, whitewashed Jewish Quarter, is testament
to the city’s multicultural past.
By the tenth century, Córdoba was a city of nearly one million and pos-
sessed Europe’s greatest libraries (not surprising when you realize that
only the Moors knew how to make paper), a superlative university
excelling in mathematics and science, and the only paved and lighted
streets on the peninsula. The one-time capital also boasted 600 Arab
baths, 60,000 noble mansions, 50 hospitals, and 27 schools.
Although Córdoba was instrumental in pulling Europe out of the Dark
Ages, the city’s preeminence under the Moors didn’t last long. The
Christian Reconquest captured the city in 1236, and Córdoba never
recovered its former glory.
Arriving in Córdoba
You’ll most likely roll into Córdoba by road or rail from another point in
Andalusia, or from Madrid. Flying isn’t an option; Córdoba has an air-
port, but no commercial routes use it. You have to fly into Granada,
Seville, or Málaga, all at least two hours away.
By car
If you go by car, you drive along undulating olive groves, and a car is vir-
tually the only way to see some of the pueblos blancos (white towns) effi-
ciently. (See Chapter 16 for more about the pueblos blancos.) Driving to
Córdoba from Madrid, take the N-IV (E-5), which veers right (west) at
Bailén. The toll-free trip takes about three hours. (The same highway
continues directly to Seville.)

Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
410
The N-342 highway connects Córdoba with Granada, and the N-331
unites Córdoba with Málaga.
By train
The fastest and least complicated way to get to Córdoba from either
Madrid or Seville is definitely the AVE High-Speed Train. Though it’s the
most expensive method of public transportation, I highly recommend it
for its efficiency and incredibly smooth ride. From Madrid, the trip takes
about one-and-three-quarter hours; from Seville, just under 45 minutes.
Fifteen trains travel daily to both destinations. The one-way fare from
Madrid is 47€ to 52€ ($60–$67; from Seville, 20€–22€/$26–$28). If you
can’t catch the AVE, or want to save a few euros, hop on board a Talgo
200 train (fast but not superfast like the AVE). It takes about two hours
and costs 39€to 44€ ($50–$56) from Madrid. Three Talgo trains per day
travel between Madrid and Córdoba. Slower regional trains (which go by
the names Intercity, Estrecho, García Lorca, and Andalucía Exprés) are

cheap, but considerably less comfortable and a waste of valuable time
for most travelers.
Córdoba’s handsome new train station is northwest of the Old City at
Glorieta de las Tres Culturas, s/n, off the Avenida de América (% 902-
24-02-02). Bus no. 3 goes directly from outside the train station to the
Old Quarter. The RENFE advance ticket office is located at Ronda de los
Tejares 10 (% 957-47-58-84). For AVE train schedules and information,
call % 902-24-02-02 or visit www.renfe.es.
By bus
Getting to Córdoba by bus is a simple enough proposition, until you
factor in the confusion of local bus stations. Each line has a separate ter-
minal scattered about the city. There are eight terminals in Córdoba; sev-
eral of them service Madrid (trips take about five hours). The separate
terminals can make your trip a bit confusing, especially when the train is
so simple. I recommend taking the bus only if you’re going to or coming
from a small town in which train service isn’t available.
The main bus terminal (Estación Central de Autobuses de Córdoba) is
on Glorieta de las Tres Culturas, s/n (% 902-22-92-92). Buses travel to
Seville, Granada, Málaga, and other cities in Andalusia.
Orienting yourself in Córdoba
The provincial capital of Córdoba hugs the banks of the Guadalquivir
River, which also flows through Seville, just 129km (80 miles) to the
southeast. The Old City, where you find the great Mosque and old Jewish
Quarter, is north of the river, across the Roman bridge. Parts of the
medieval Arab ramparts still stand on the fringes of the old town. The
modern commercial and residential neighborhoods (and the RENFE train
station) are north of the Old City, as Córdoba trails off into the foothills
of the Sierra Morena Mountains.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Virtually everything you want to see in Córdoba is in or near the centro
(historic center), which is along the river and around the Mezquita
(Great Mosque). Immediately northwest of the Mezquita is the Barrio 
de la Judería, the old Jewish Quarter, Córdoba’s most enchanting 
neighborhood.
Finding information after you arrive
There’s a tourist information kiosk on the main concourse of the AVE
train station. The helpful Andalusia Provincial Tourism Office is
located at Torrijos 10 (% 957-35-51-79; Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., 
Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m. and Sun 10 a.m.–2 p.m.), right next to the Mezquita.
Municipal tourism offices are located at the Alcázar de los Reyes
Cristianos, Campo Santo de los Mártires (% 902-20-17-74; Mon–Sun 
9:30 a.m.–7:00 p.m.) and Plaza de las Tendillas 5 (% 902-20-17-74; daily
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 411

10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 4:30–7:30 p.m.), in the modern center of town. There’s
also a tourist information kiosk on the main concourse of the AVE train
station (% 902-20-17-74; daily 9:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 4:30–7:30 p.m.).
Getting around Córdoba
Córdoba’s Old City is small and perfect for walking. In fact, many of the
streets in this labyrinthine area around the Mezquita are pedestrian
only. If you stay at one of the hotels a bit removed from the old center,
you’ll either need to cover substantial distances by foot or call upon the
assistance of taxis and the occasional buses.
By taxi
You find taxi stops on Avenida del Gran Capitán, Calles Cañero, Ciudad
Jardín, Arcos de la Frontera, Agustín Moreno, and the Plazas Colón and
Tendillas. To order up a cab, call Radio Taxi (% 957-76-44-44). Taxis are
inexpensive; unless you take one out to the ruins of Medina Azahara, no
trip should cost you more than about 7€ ($8.40).
By car
Wheels are the way to get the most out of your travels in Andalusia,
especially if you plan on seeing more than just the three big cities of the
south (Córdoba, Seville, and Granada). If you only go to these, and don’t
plan to do any exploring, I advise against a car, because driving around
the cities is difficult and potentially dangerous, with streets originally
designed for the horse and buggy.
You can rent a car at one of the major agencies in Córdoba: Avis, Plaza de
Colón 32 (% 957-40-14-45); Europcar, Rep. Argentina, s/n, and Camino de
los Sastres, local 1 (% 957-40-34-80); and Hertz, Av. América, s/n, RENFE
Railway station (% 957-40-20-61).
By bus
You probably won’t have much need for buses, unless it’s from your
hotel or the train station to the Old Quarter. For bus information, call 
% 957-76-46-76. Your hotel can also indicate a nearby bus to the major
sights in the old town.
Horse for hire?
If you want to clip-clop around the Old Quarter, hire a horse-drawn car-
riage. You find carriage stops at Campo Santo de los Mártires (next to
the Alcázar) and Calle Torrijos (next to the Mezquita). The atmospheric
Old Quarter of Córdoba certainly makes the notion appealing, but, on
my last visit, most of the horses looked a little anemic. If you’re going on
to Seville, I think you’re better off getting a horse carriage there (if you
must choose). The cost in both cities is about 25€ ($30) an hour, though
some of the drivers in Córdoba may bargain with you out of high season.

Staying in Córdoba
Córdoba gets lots of day-trippers who file into the city to see the
Mezquita (Great Mosque) and dash right out of town — which is proba-
bly why the hotel scene is somewhat limited. It’s a great place for budget
travelers, though, with a disproportionate number of good, simple, and
inexpensive lodgings near the Mezquita and old Jewish Quarter. At the
upper end, choices are considerably slimmer. Prices go up, but not
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 413
Fiesta! Celebrating in Córdoba
Semana Santa (Holy Week) is intense in Andalusia and is one of the greatest profes-
sions of faith in all Spain. Córdoba doesn’t exactly take Easter lightly. And forget bun-
nies, chicks, and chocolate eggs; the worshippers crowding Córdoba’s streets are
waiting for the passing of 32 colorful ceremonial processions, including floats and pen-
itents. Certain processions, such as María Santísima de la Esperanza (Holy Mary of
Hope) and La Virgen de los Dolores (The Virgin of Sorrow) have enthusiastic, cultlike
followings. Check with the Tourism Office for a schedule of processions and routes or
visit www.guiasemanasanta.com/cordoba/es.
Córdoba is even more famous for its May festivals — if you can get a room (book at
least a couple of months in advance), it’s by far the best time for a visit to the city. Las
Cruces en Mayo (May Crosses) marks the beginning of the monthlong celebrations.
Crosses are erected in patios and courtyards and decorated with potted plants, flow-
ers, and even shawls. Neighborhood associations, or peñas, also set up flamenco
stages and small bars nearby — free-flowing wine is about as abundant as flowers in
May. Neighborhoods that traditionally sprout May Crosses are San Agustín, Alcázar
Viejo, San Lorenzo, and Santa María.
After the decorated crosses, Córdoba’s May party moves to courtyards, when the
Festival de los Patios Cordobeses — a contest for best patio in Córdoba — takes over
about 50 of them across the city. Such exuberant vegetation — red and green pots of
roses, carnations, geraniums, jasmine, honeysuckle, and ivy — against the backdrop
of stark, whitewashed buildings is a photo op at every turn. Some patios entered in
the competition are communal neighborhood efforts, and others belong to palaces or
convents. For more information, visit www.patiosdecordoba.net.
Finally, the celebrations reach a crescendo with the Feria de Mayo (Mayfair), also
called the Feria de Nuestra Señora de la Salud (Festival of Our Lady of Health). It’s
the grand finale, beginning around May 25 and bringing the month’s festivities to a
rousing close. Feria de Mayo is a smorgasbord of bullfights, flamenco, theater, and
casetas (stages) set up by neighborhood associations for skits and performances. On
generous display is the traditional Cordovan costume, with the sombrero cordobés
(wide-brimmed hat), Andalusian horses, and, of course, lots of fino (fine) wines.
For more information on the best-decorated crosses, the most lavishly verdant patios,
and other events, contact the main Tourism Office at % 957-47-12-35 (see “Finding
information after you arrive,” earlier in this chapter).

ridiculously so, during high season — April through May across the
board, and September through October at some hotels.
Make your reservations far in advance if you want to stay in Córdoba
during the popular May festivals.
Casa de los Azulejos
$$–$$$
Old Quarter
A handsome 17th-century colonial house built around a central patio over-
flowing with plants, this attractive small hotel is full of character and com-
fort. The eight colorful rooms, which open onto the patio, feature antique
doors and lovely Andalusian tile floors (special enough that they’re cited
in the inn’s name). Located a couple of blocks from Córdoba’s Roman
ruins, the inn contains a cozy library and a genial cantina, called La
Guadalupana, which serves a fusion menu of Latin American and
Andalusian specialties at lunch and dinner.

Hostal Maestre
$
East of Centro
A ten-minute walk from the mosque and Jewish Quarter, on two tiny, back-
to-back streets overrun with hostales and pensiones (both informal types of
guesthouses), this is the best of the lot. It’s a three-in-one establishment —
hotel, hostel, and apartments — that hasn’t stopped expanding since the
mid-1970s. The hotel is the newest of the bunch, dating to 1992. Its 26 rooms
are sparse and a bit dull, but they’ve got the basics: television, air-condi-
tioning, and small bathrooms. The lobby and interior courtyards, with
Andalusian tiles and lots of greenery, are more comfortably outfitted than
the rooms, so decide how much time you plan to spend in your room. If
your answer’s “not much,” and that’s about the amount you want to spend,
you’ll do fine here. If you’ve got a family in tow, check out the apartments,
which feature one and two bedrooms, small kitchens, and eating areas.

Hotel Albucasis
$$
Old Quarter
A quiet little hotel on an equally quiet little street in the Barrio de la Judería
(the Jewish Quarter), the Albucasis does everything in its power to keep
its cool in the Andalusian sun. The friendly, family-run hotel has a pretty,
plant-filled courtyard, cool marble floors, and green-tiled bathrooms. The
15 air-conditioned rooms (only nine are doubles) are decently sized, with
functional, sturdy furnishings. The common areas — a nice breakfast nook,
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia

a cozy sitting area, and the inviting patio — are excellent places to relax
and share travel tales. Within echo range of the great mosque’s bells, the
Albucasis is one of the city’s best bargains.

Hotel González
$–$$
Old Quarter
A small budget hotel in a restored 16th-century palace, this charmer feels
perfectly Andalusian. It’s just minutes from the mosque, in the heart of the
old Jewish Quarter, which is packed with historic monuments and bustling
tourist-oriented shops. Though rooms are simple, they’re also delightful,
with colorful floor-to-ceiling drapes, antique furnishings, and tile floors (and
air conditioning — which is a blessing in steaming Córdoba). The 16 rooms
either overlook a pretty square, Plaza Judá Leví, or the hotel’s equally
pretty interior patio. Original artwork lines the central hall and corridors.
The González is easily one of the top bargain places to stay in Córdoba. If
you can’t get in here, try the owners’ other hotel, Hotel Mezquita, with sim-
ilar facilities and prices (see the listing later in this section).

Hotel Maimónides
$$
Old Quarter
If what you care about is location, location, location, you can hardly do
better than the Maimónides. Stumble out the front door and you run smack
into the Mezquita. And if it’s the Mezquita you want to see, request a room
with unequaled views of its rooftop (floodlit at night). That’s probably
enough to justify the price tag for some, but this once-grand hotel isn’t up
to the standards of the nearby NH Hotel Amistad (see review later in this
section). Even though it was fully renovated in 2000, rooms are still unex-
ceptional, and bathrooms aren’t exactly spacious. But the unpretentious
Maimónides is a comfortable place to stay, and ideally positioned for short
walks not only to the mosque but also to the flamenco show down the street,
as well as to some of Córdoba’s best restaurants in the Jewish Quarter.

You can’t get closer to the mosque unless you were to sneak in and sleep

views of the mosque, although others overlook a cool, boldly colored cen-
tral patio — a good place to hide from the heat of midday (unless you bolt
straight for the air-conditioning). Like the Hotel González, which is owned
by the same folks, this place has real Andalusian character at bargain
prices.

NH Hotel Amistad Córdoba
$$$
Old Quarter
Occupying two former 18th-century mansions that face each other across
a quiet plaza in the heart of the Jewish Quarter, this five-year-old hotel
quickly leapt to the top of the heap, leaving old war horses Meliá Córdoba
and Gran Capitán to the package tours. It’s easily the choicest place to stay
in Córdoba, and pretty fairly priced for the level of comfort it offers. The
neoclassical facades give way to a gorgeous central patio with Moorish
arches and columns. Furnishings are cleanly modern, focusing on light
woods, soft earthy tones, and occasional bright contemporary touches,
such as the royal purple chairs in the bar area. An upscale member of the
Spanish NH hotel chain, it’s next to the bullfighting museum and just a
short shuffle from the old synagogue. The entrance, cut right into the old
Arab wall, is a nice touch.

Parador de Córdoba (la Arruzafa)
$$$
Outskirts of Córdoba
Córdoba’s large and thoroughly modern parador (a historic government-
run inn) is inconveniently located about 4.8km (3 miles) north of the his-
toric quarter. It’s not one of the parador system’s best efforts — the NH
Amistad in the Jewish Quarter (see the preceding review) beats it by a
mile. You’re best off staying here if Córdoba’s heat and tourist hordes get
to you; you can get away from it all with a dip in the refreshing pool or a
volley on the tennis courts. The gardens are attractive and the panoramic
vistas of the city are quite nice. The rooms aren’t bad, though they don’t
rise much above the conventional. Try to get one with a balcony.

Dining in Córdoba
Córdoba has a small stable of good Andalusian restaurants, most of them
clustered in and around the old Jewish Quarter. However, in contrast to
the hotel scene, the city doesn’t have too many dependable places for a
good, cheap meal. Your best bet is to assemble something informal by
tapas grazing; see the section “Setting out on a tapas and tavern crawl,”
later in this chapter. Casa El Pisto and Taberna Salinas are both perfect for
tapas sampling, as are the bars at several of the restaurants listed below.
Almudaina
$$$–$$$$
Old Quarter
SPANISH/CONTINENTAL
The top-rated restaurant in Córdoba is also one of its most attractive.
Almudaina is in a handsomely restored 16th-century mansion on a pleas-
ing plaza, close to the Mezquita and Alcázar. You can choose from six
dining rooms — including a brick-walled and vine-covered, glass-roofed
central patio — and elegant side rooms with lush drapes and chandeliers.
Edelmiro Jiménez’s market-based menu is continually changing, ranging
from regional Cordovan dishes to French-inspired entrees. It’s really hard to
go wrong here; you may start with the excellent eggplant and champiñones
(mushrooms), or the house foie gras, followed by lubina (sea bass) with
shrimp and mushrooms. For dessert, the pear and nut mousse sounded
great, but I was too stuffed to try it.

Bodegas Campo

Centro
SPANISH/CONTINENTAL
A tavern and bodega since 1908, this restaurant is one of the most inviting
in Córdoba. The handsome, warmly rustic environment, decorated with
vintage posters of the Córdoba May Festival, is filled with locals day and
night. If you arrive early enough, have a drink in the sacristy, a small atmos-
pheric temple in back, past the wall lined by wooden wine vats signed by
famous guests. Although wine is clearly an essential, the food is far from
an afterthought. The kitchen of Javier Campos concentrates on local and
regional dishes; for an appetizer, try the overflowing plate of pescaditos
fritos (tiny fried fish, eaten whole), or the scrumptious salmorejo (a
Cordovan version of gazpacho). Solomillo ibérico (sirloin steak) is a good
choice for the main course, if you’ve got a big appetite. Oh, and the cellar:
It has a fine list of Spanish wine. Some are rather pricy, but the house red
is excellent and a bargain.

El Caballo Rojo
$$$
Old Quarter
ANDALUSIAN/SPANISH
Córdoba’s most famous and popular restaurant, El Caballo Rojo (The Red
Horse) was a pioneer of Cordovan cooking, reviving ancient Moorish influ-
ences. Just yards from the Mezquita, this lively restaurant is one of the top
spots to sample some classic Andalusian dishes, such as salmorejo (cold,
thick Cordovan gazpacho) and rabo de toro (oxtail stew), as well as such
inventive dishes as almond-and-apple white gazpacho and rape mudéjar
(monkfish with raisins and pine nuts). The wine cellar is one of the most
extensive in the city. The bar downstairs is always noisy with long-time
regulars and tourists who’ve just stumbled in from the mosque. Though
that may make you fear for the worst, if you can handle the racket, you’ll
probably have a fun and even memorable meal here.

El Churrasco

Right in the heart of the historic Judería, this is the place to come — as the
name reminds you — for churrasco, or juicy grilled meats. If the Cordovan
sun has been beating on your head all day and meat sounds like a daunt-
ing proposition, start off with ajoblanco (white gazpacho) or artichokes in
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
418
Eating and drinking like a Cordobés
The local cuisine, heavy on garlic and the olive oil in which Andalusia practically
swims, concentrates on fried fish and stout meat dishes such as oxtail stew. Don’t
leave Córdoba without trying salmorejo (sahl-moh-reh-hoh), a thick, tomato-based
soup served cold. It’s similar to gazpacho, but more like a puree and more substantial.
On a hot day, it can feed you for lunch all by itself. You also find white gazpacho, or
ajoblanco (ah-hoh-blahn-koh), made with olive oil, garlic, and almonds, topped off with
grapes. Rabo de toro (rah-boh deh toh-roh, oxtail stew) is a staple in the Córdoba diet,
as are caldereta de cordero (kahl-deh-reh-tah deh cohr-deh-roh; lamb) and cochifrito
de la sierra (koh-chee-free-toh deh lah syeh-rah; goat or mutton stew). Desserts show
ancient Jewish and Moorish influences; try such pastries as pastel judío (pah-stehl
hoo-dee-oh; a pastry made with citron preserves), pestiños (peh-stee-nyohs; honey
pancakes), and buñuelos (boo-nyoo-eh-lohs; fritters). Although Andalusia’s the place
for jerez (heh-reth; sherry), try the local variety, montilla, an excellent dry and fragrant
wine from the wine-producing region Montilla–Moriles. Perfect for tapas, montilla
comes, like sherry, in several varieties: finos (fine and dry); finos viejos, also called
amontillados (aged, fine wines); olorosos (aromatic wines); and olorosos viejos (aged
aromatic wines).

virgin olive oil, and see how your taste buds warm to the idea. If you’re not
up to charcoal-grilled beef or pork loin, sample any of the tasty fish items,
such as rape a la oliva negra (monkfish with black olives). The downstairs
dining room, with the look of a Moorish courtyard, is more informal than
the upstairs rooms. The bar at the entrance is a great place for a sherry or
cold beer and tapas, either before or instead of a meal.

Exploring Córdoba
Córdoba, though easygoing and enjoyable, can’t compare with Seville or
Granada: Its history matches or surpasses the past of those other cities,
but Córdoba has fewer modern-day attractions. Though the Mezquita is
one of the definitive highlights of Spain, a day or day and a half is really
all you need to explore the city’s major sights. On the other hand, during
festival time, you may never want to leave.
Córdoba’s municipal museums, including the Alcázar de los Reyes
Cristianos (Royal Fortress and Gardens), Museo Taurino (Bullfighting
Museum), and Julio Romero de Torres Museum (a collection of the
Cordovan painter, on Plaza del Potro), are all free on Fridays.
The top attractions
Mezquita (Great Mosque)
Old Quarter
Córdoba’s astonishing Mosque is one of Moorish Spain’s greatest achieve-
ments, one of Spain’s most enduring and treasured monuments, and one
of the world’s most remarkable mosques. It’s brilliant, surprising, and it
packs a historical wallop. You’d hardly guess its glory from the mostly
plain exterior, though. The Moorish Emir Ab-ar Rahman I ordered it built
in A.D. 786 at the height of power of al-Andalus — Muslim Spain. (The
Moors controlled all but a small sliver of northern Spain, in the present-day
Basque Country). The Mosque was significantly enlarged over the next
two centuries (the original mosque makes up only about one-fifth of the
present structure), but in the 16th century, part of it was destroyed. In an
act of either hubris or revenge, Christians constructed a cathedral smack
in the middle of the mosque. This juxtaposition may strike you as an abom-
ination; at the very least, it stands as a fascinating document of Spanish
religious and political history.
Enter through the Patio de los Naranjos (a large patio of orange trees,
where the faithful prayed and cleansed themselves before entering the
mosque). Even if you’ve seen pictures of the interior, the magical forest of
candy-cane-striped arches — a seemingly limitless horizon of dazzling 
harmony — will astound you. More than 850 columns and purely decora-
tive arches of granite, jasper, and marble fill 19 aisles. Notice the capitals,
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 419

which were rescued in large part from ancient (that is to say, more ancient)
structures in Córdoba (the mosque was built on the site of a Visigothic
basilica). The mosaic tiles and marble that once covered the floors are
now sadly gone, as are most of the polychrome ceilings, but the Mosque’s
grandeur resonates throughout. Wander in a delirious daze, but don’t miss
the mihrab, the wonderfully ornate prayer niche in the southeast corner
of the mosque. A feast of carved marble, stucco, alabaster, and mosaics,
it pointed to Mecca and was the most sacred part of the Mosque. Look up
at its magnificent cupola.
The Capilla Real (Royal Chapel) and Capilla Villaviciosa (Villaviciosa
Chapel), the first Christian components of the complex, are Mudéjar (a
hybrid of Moorish and Christian architecture) in style and were ordered by
Ferdinand III in 1236, as part of the Reconquest. The ostentatious Italianate
dome of the Catedral, begun in 1253, is a startling contrast to the mesmer-
izing quiet beauty of the mosque. The cathedral’s saving graces are its mag-
nificently carved mahogany choir stalls, which date to 1758 and depict the
Old and New Testaments, and its pulpits, also beautiful works of carving.
Unfortunately, you won’t get to enjoy the spectacular views of Córdoba
and the Sierra from the top of the belfry; it remains closed for restoration,
as it has been for years.
In summer, the mosque’s interior is heaven on earth, a blessed retreat from
the sun (something the Moors surely considered when they designed it in
Córdoba). But if you visit Córdoba in winter, even though the sun may
shine brilliantly outside and you’re decked out comfortably in shorts and
sandals, it can get very chilly inside the mosque. As when you go to the
movie theater on a blistering day, you’re wise to bring a sweater.

Two for the price of one
You can draw your own conclusions about whether or not it was a heinous crime to
insert a cathedral into the middle of the Mezquita, thereby destroying the mosque’s
perfect symmetry (and about a quarter of its pillars). Before the building of the cathe-
dral, one could see across the forest of pillars, surely a mind-bending optical effect.
The cathedral also destroyed the mosque’s perfect acoustics. (Even King Carlos V,
who gave the okay to build the cathedral, was dismayed upon seeing it. He reportedly
exclaimed, “You have destroyed something unique to build something commonplace.”)
Ironically, the building of the cathedral may have saved the Mezquita. Of 300 mosques
that once existed in Córdoba, the Mezquita is the only one that remains, no doubt in
tribute to its Christian church and treasures within, which prevented it from being
sacked along with other remnants of Muslim Spain.

Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos
Constructed on top of an old Moorish palace, the 14th-century Fortress of
the Christian Monarchs, strategically located along the Guadalquivir River,
served military and mercantilist purposes. For about eight years during
the Reconquest, the Christian monarchs made the Gothic Alcázar their
palace, and Christopher Columbus came here to schmooze and lobby the
kings for funds to make his maiden voyage to the New World. The exten-
sive gardens, perfect for kids who need to stretch out a bit, are truly regal,
with a series of pools, water terraces, fountains, and palm and orange trees
that reflect Córdoba’s Moorish roots. Within the spare palace quarters
(which once served as Inquisition headquarters) are archaeological finds
from the area, including Roman mosaics and a sarcophagus from the third
century. Below the Mosaics room are steam baths that date to the time of
the Moorish caliphate.
The fortress’s imposing towers, the Torre de los Leones (Tower of the
Lions) and Torre de Homenaje (Homage Tower), have reopened after
restoration. Climb to the top for excellent panoramic views of the Old
Quarter of Córdoba.

Barrio de La Judería
Córdoba’s Jewish Quarter is a fascinating and wonderfully alive area of
impossibly narrow and crooked streets, ancient whitewashed houses with
cool, colorful interior patios, and historic religious monuments. A stroll
through the area is like a history lesson on Moorish Spain. When Córdoba
was the largest and most advanced city in Europe in the tenth century, 
the cobbled streets teemed with silversmiths and craftsmen, and the 
residents — Jews, Christians, and Moors — all lived as they did in Toledo,
in peace. Visit the Sinagoga (Synagogue), built in 1315 and the only Jewish
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 421
Flower power: Calleja de las Flores
Córdoba’s Calleja de las Flores (Little Street of Flowers) isn’t much more than an alley-
way just west of the mosque (off Calles Blanco Belmonte and Victor Bosco), but it’s a
charming spot: a picture-perfect montage of wrought-iron grilles, potted flowers, and
window boxes filled with colorful geraniums. Domestic courtyards, often shared and
gardened communal-style by a number of families, also come alive in spring; annual
contests crown the best patios in Córdoba. The Tourism Office organizes springtime
visits to a number of them; call % 957-49-16-77 for additional information and tour
times.

temple in Andalusia that survived the tumult of the Inquisition and expul-
sion of Jews and Moors. If you’re expecting cathedral-like grandeur, its
utter simplicity will shock you: Except for the stucco decorations, it’s just
a tiny, plain box. An important Jewish community once thrived in Spain
and built hundreds of synagogues, but the religious fervor of the
Inquisition and Expulsion led to most Jews publicly renouncing their faith
or, more commonly, fleeing Spain. Only three synagogues remain in Spain:
two in Toledo and the modest one in Córdoba.
Across the street from the synagogue, but a world away, is the Museo
Taurino — the Bullfighting Museum. Housed in a noble 16th-century
house, Casa de las Bulas, it displays a replica of the famous bullfighter
Manolete’s tomb and other toro (bull) relics and memorabilia, including
bulls’ heads and the hide of the bull that gored Manolete to death. Four of
Spain’s greatest bullfighters, revered throughout the country, came from
Córdoba and were known as the “four Caliphs of Córdoba.”
Next to the museum is the Zoco, the old souk, or market area. Today it’s
again a market vying for your tourist dollars with small shops dealing
Córdoba crafts and jewelry. Just up the street from the synagogue is the
Puerta del Almodóvar — Almodóvar’s Gate. Nothing to do with Spain’s
hippest filmmaker, it’s part of the original medieval entrance to the old
Jewish Quarter. On the west side of the Judería are the remains of the old
Arab city walls.

Pretty on the inside
Andalusian patios serve a very practical purpose — their construction at the center of
the house, with cooling ceramic tiles and potted plants and vines, is essential for keep-
ing the house cool. (The labyrinthine design of the Old Quarter, a Moorish innovation
featuring houses close together on narrow streets, achieves the same cooling purpose.)
But the patios’ aesthetic flourishes also reflect a less pragmatic concern. At the heart
of the Muslim religion is the notion that beauty is fundamentally internal and should be
kept private. Thus, most old Andalusian houses are simple on the outside; decoration is
limited to the interior. The same concepts are apparent even in the Moors’ greatest mon-
uments; in Córdoba’s Great Mosque, notice how severe and unadorned its exterior is,
compared to the unrestrained visual beauty concealed inside.

More cool things to see and do
Do you still have a few extra hours or days in town? If so, check out
these other fun activities to do in Córdoba.
 Peeking in on patios. Córdoba is known for its splendid patios, but
outside of the May patio festival, finding and getting in to see the
best ones is sometimes hard. For the best glimpse of aristocratic
Córdoba, you have to venture a bit north of the Old Quarter. Tucked
away in a busy commercial district, Palacio de los Marqueses de
Viana, Plaza de Don Gome 2 (5 blocks west of Calle Alfaros, south-
west of Plaza de Colón — take bus to Plaza Colón; % 957-49-67-41),
is a sumptuous 16th-century palace, which locals call El Museo de
los Patios — The Patio Museum. The mansion has 14 elegant inte-
rior patios, as well as halls decorated with rich furnishings, Goya
tapestries, carved cedar ceilings, and rare tiles. Admission is 6€
($7.20; if visiting only the patios, 3€/$3.60). It’s open Monday to
Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m., Sat 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.; in
summer, Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Closed: first two
weeks of June (but you can still visit the patios).
 Taking a magical history tour. South of the mosque, at the bend in
the Guadalquivir River, are two important works of architecture
dating to Córdoba’s Roman and Moorish eras, Calahorra Tower and
the Roman Bridge. The bridge isn’t a quaint Roman artifact but a
heavily trafficked thoroughfare with 16 arches. The sad river, all but
washed up now, mirrors the city’s decline. The Romans used the
river as a commercial waterway, and the Moors tapped into its
power with waterwheels and mills (still visible from the bridge
today). Cross the bridge (notice the shrine to St. Raphael, the
archangel of Córdoba, about mid-way, which is usually decorated
with flowers and lit candles) to approach the Torre de la Calahorra,
an imposing tower built in the mid–14th century to guard the
entrance to the city. Today it houses an audiovisual museum, Museo
Vivo de Al-Andalus, Puente Romano, s/n (% 957-29-39-29), with
exhibits and a multimedia presentation on the three distinct religions
and cultures upon which Córdoba is founded. Although a good
opportunity to find out more about Moorish Spain, the museum is
probably best if you approach it like an escapist action flick on a hot
summer day — a place of refuge. To get there, cross the Roman
bridge just south of the mosque. Admission is 4.50€ ($5.75), 3€
($3.85) seniors and students; the multimedia presentation is an addi-
tional 1.20€ ($1.50). The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m.; in summer months daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4:30 to 8:30
p.m. (Multivisión projection at 11 a.m., and noon, 1, 3, and 4 p.m.)
 Hanging out in a plaza. The attractively weathered Plaza del
Potro is best known for its historic inn, La Posada del Potro (Inn of
the Colt), where Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote,
once stayed (the plaza figures into his epic novel). Across the
plaza, the Museo de Bellas Artes de Córdoba (Fine Arts Museum),
Chapter 15: Seville and Córdoba 423

Plaza del Potro 1 (1 block west of Calle San Fernando; a ten-minute
walk from the mosque; % 957-47-33-45), occupies a 15th-century
charity hospital and has a small collection of Seville-school painters
and Cordovan artists. Admission is 1.50€ ($1.80); free for members
of the E.U. The museum is open Wednesday to Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 8:30 p.m., Sunday and holidays from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and
Tuesday from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m. A number of outdoor cafes occupy
the pedestrian street opposite the plaza and are good places to rest
your legs and slurp an iced lemonade.
 Digging up the past. Most everything of interest in Córdoba relates
to the city’s multilayered past, so a good way to explore those layers
is to see what’s been unearthed at Córdoba’s Museo Arqueológico
(Archaeology Museum), Plaza de Jerónimo Páez 7 (between the
Mosque and Plaza del Potro; % 957-47-55-17). It occupies a hand-
some Renaissance palace and is a survey of the city’s (which is to
say, Spain’s) history, with Roman, Visigothic, Muslim, Mudéjar, and
Renaissance pieces. The diverse collection includes fantastic ceram-
ics, mosaics, sarcophagi, and a terrific bronze stag that came from a
fountain at the Medina Azahara palace (see “Side trips from Córdoba:
A visit to the ruins of Medina Azahara,” later in this chapter). The
Moorish decorative arts are particularly well represented. Admission
is 1.50€ ($1.80), free for members of the E.U. The museum is open
Tuesday, 2:30 to 8:30 p.m., Wednesday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
8:30 p.m., and Sunday and holidays from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Shopping for Cordovan crafts
The Reconquest was 500 years ago, but Córdoba is still known for tradi-
tional Moorish crafts, such as handmade gold and silver filigree and
embossed leather goods, known worldwide as Cordovan leather. Shops
featuring these traditional Cordovan goods, and many more, line the
Judería — a bit too thickly for some tastes. A mark — a crowned lion and
the name of the city — distinguishes the embossed Cordovan leathers.
If you’re in the market for traditional leather goods from Córdoba, be care-
ful of items advertised as embossed or hand-tooled Cordovan leather.
Some of the sneakier shops may try to pass off inferior stamped leather
from Morocco as the real thing. Unfortunately, the work is generally of

Lots of bull
Toro, Toro, Toro: Córdoba’s new Plaza de Toros (bullfighting ring), Coso de los Califas,
is on the outskirts of town, on Avenida Gran Vía. Most big bullfighting events are in
May (usually the last week) to coincide with the city festivals, but look for other sched-
uled bullfights in this toros-crazy town. Call % 957-23-25-07 for information and tick-
ets. Prices range from 5€ ($6.40) to about 75€ ($90).

lesser quality. Touch and inspect the product, and look for the lion
symbol (though that too may be an imposter). After you’ve seen the 
real stuff, distinguishing between it and the inferior imposters shouldn’t
be too hard.
For authentic leather goods, drop by the shop of talented artisan 
Carlos López-Obrero. His shop, specializing in hand-tooled leather and
embossed leather products, is on Calleja de las Flores 2 (no phone). 
Taller Meryan, at the same address (% 957-47-59-02), is one of Córdoba’s
best shops and factories for quality embossed leather products.
For handcrafts of all sorts, particularly jewelry, check out the Zoco
Municipal de Artesanía, the old medina (Middle Eastern market) on
Calle Judíos, just behind the bullfighting museum. It’s open daily from 
10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Other shops line the streets Deanes, Romero, and
the Plaza Leví and those near the Mezquita.
If you want to buy some local montilla (dry sherry), other wines, or
Andalusian olive oil, check out the well-stocked Bodegas Mezquita, on
Corregidor Luis de la Cerda 73 (% 957-49-81-17), just behind the Great
Mosque. They let you taste wines and, sometimes, oils and cheese.
Discovering Córdoba’s nightlife

Arab baths and teahouses
To relive the elegance and sophistication of Al-Andalus, the Moors’ dynasty in south-
ern Spain, pop into a tetería (teahouse) or the new baños árabes, or Turkish-style bath-
house. Though Granada has probably done a better job connecting its Moorish past
to the present, Córdoba now has a couple of establishments directed at both locals and
visitors that give a taste of Arab traditions. For a phenomenally relaxing couple of
hours, don’t miss the new Hammam Arabic Baths on Corregidor Luis de la Cerda 51
(% 957-48-47-46), which summons a bit of the flavor found at the Mezquita and
Alhambra (the latter, in Granada). A series of hot and cold steam pools have been
installed under brick arches and tiled walls. The freezing cold pool, in the first room,
is only for the hearty. The baths (with or without massage) are every couple of hours,
from 10 a.m. to midnight (lasting 90 minutes). Prices for one session range from 20€
to 29€ ($24–$35). Hammam has a teahouse upstairs and occasional belly dance per-
formances, every day in summer beginning at 9 p.m. Reservations are essential.
Another teahouse worth stopping into for a hot or cold mint tea or thick batido (shake)
is Salon de Té, Buen Pastor 13 (% 957-48-79-84), a loungelike spot in the heart of the
old Jewish Quarter.

animated flamenco show. If you’re in Córdoba during the annual Guitar
Festival (July), you won’t want to miss seeing some great picking on the
Spanish guitar.
Setting out on a tapas and tavern crawl
A tapas and tavern crawl in Córdoba is virtually irresistible. Here are a
few local faves, great places to duck in out of the heat, have a montilla
(local version of a dry sherry, similar to manzanilla), and order a small
portion of Serrano ham, chorizo, aceitunas (green olives), or queso
(cheese). These places are very casual and not the type where you need
reservations — plus, virtually no one speaks English here. You don’t
need to call ahead, so I don’t list phone numbers here.
Casa El Pisto, or Taberna de San Miguel, Plaza de San Miguel 1, is a charm-
ing old tavern, not far from Seville’s Roman temple, that has Mudéjar-style
tiles, wood beams, and hanging hams and peppers along with hundreds of
small framed photos of old bullfighters. If you hit only one bar in town,
make it this one. The front bar is always crowded with people knocking
back tapas and small glasses of wine or beer; you can continue to stand 
or wait for a table in the restaurant in back. Near the restored Plaza de la
Corredera, Taberna Salinas, Tunidores 3, at Espartería is an appealing
spot, dating from 1879, for a few tapas and a montilla. Choose from the
tiny bar at the front or a traditional courtyard sitting area with tables out
back. A good option here is the classic Córdoba dish naranjas “picas” con
aceite y bacalao (strips of cod served with wedges of sweet Andalusian
oranges and slices of onion, bathed in virgin olive oil) — as weird as it is
wonderful.
Bodega Zoco, Judíos, s/n, is a fantastic underground stone catacomb of
a place in the old medina. Go down the stairs at the back of the market
into the relief of natural refrigeration. The chorizo al vino (sausage
soaked in montilla wine) is a house specialty. Just up the street is
Bodegas Guzman, Judíos, s/n, an atmospheric spot with wonderful
1920s and ’30s posters from the May Festivals at the entrance and a
crowd of regulars at the bar. Bodegas Campo, Calle de los Lineros 32, is
an excellent restaurant (see the listing in the restaurant section of this
chapter) with a tiny bar at the entrance, but the real star is the sexy sac-
ristía (a tapas temple) at back, past the wine vats. Mesón Juan Peña, Dr.
Fleming 1, has a terrific wine cellar. The cinematic bar Pepe el de la
Judería (Pepe of the Jewish Quarter) Romero 1, is a revered institution
that has served drinks to generations of Cordovans, and looks the part.
Pick up a copy of the owner’s book, Cordobeses Ilustres (Illustrious
Cordovans). But the oldest-tavern-in-Córdoba award goes to Casa
Miguel, Plaza Cirino 7, serving great tapas since the early 1800s.
Performing arts: Flamenco and more
You’re in the heart of Andalusia, and though the local flamenco scene is
small, it’s still one of the most traditional places in Spain to see flamenco
dancing and emotional cante hondo (deep song). The place to be is
Tablao Cardenal, Torrijos 10 (% 957-48-31-12), just across from the
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
426

Mezquita. In a pretty open-air square, the group puts on a very
respectable flamenco show that doesn’t pander to tourists or try to wow
them with cheap pyrotechnics. The sparks here are real. There are shows
Tuesday through Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The price is 18€ ($22), which
includes your first drink. Reserving a spot in advance is wise, because it’s
popular, and as soon as a large group shows up, you may be out of luck.
Try to score a seat as close to the stage as possible. The other locale in
town for flamenco music and dance is Mesón Flamenco La Bulería, on
Pedro López 3 (% 957-48-38-39), near the Plaza de la Corredera. Shows
every night at 10:30. Cost is 12€ ($15), including one drink.
On occasion, you can catch flamenco at the Gran Teatro de Córdoba,
but more often you find opera, classical music, and ballet. It’s on
Avenida del Gran Capitán (% 957-48-02-37).
Guitarra flamenca: The art of flamenco guitar
Most Spanish guitar greats — such as Paco de Lucía and Tomatito —
hail from Andalusia. Spanish classical and flamenco guitar derives — 
like most everything in southern Spain — from the region’s indelible
Moorish past. The playing evolved from the sounds of the classical Arab
lute. Every July, Córdoba hosts the Festival Internacional de la Guitarra
(International Guitar Festival), one of its most popular events. If you’re
here then, it’s a great opportunity to see Spanish guitar maestros work
their magic on the strings. From classical Spanish guitar to flamenco, you
can see some of the fastest hands in the west, performing in great spots
in the Old City — the gardens of the Alcázar, the Botanical Gardens, and
the Gran Teatro (Grand Theater of Córdoba). For additional information
and tickets, call % 957-48-02-37 or visit www.guitarracordoba.com.
The Spanish Tourism Offices abroad (see the Appendix) usually have
their hands on a schedule several weeks in advance, or, as soon as you’re
in Córdoba, ask for a schedule of performances at the Tourism Office.
Side trips from Córdoba: A visit 
to the ruins of Medina Azahara
If Córdoba’s Great Mosque has whetted your appetite for more remnants
of the glorious Moorish domination of Spain, consider a short side trip
to the ruins of Medina Azahara, or Medinat al-Zahara (% 957-32-91-30).
Built in the foothills of the Sierra Morena in A.D. 961 by the Caliph Adb ar
Rahman III as a gift to one of his wives (judging by the opulence, she was
a favorite), the palace was once a small, stunning city with 400 houses,
300 baths, a mosque, fortress, zoo, and luxurious gardens. Archaeologists
believe that the palace was perhaps unrivaled in its opulence with jewel-
encrusted pillars, gold fountains, and quicksilver pools. The caliph sup-
posedly had almond trees planted all the way to Córdoba — he liked the
visual effect of the trees in bloom, which rolled out a snowy white carpet
up to his dream palace. Just seven decades after its laborious construc-
tion (which required 10,000 men), the 121-hectare (300-acre) compound
was sacked and destroyed by the Almoravids, a group of Berbers with a

political beef against the Al Mansur dynasty. The ruins of the grand hall,
terraces, and living quarters, unearthed this century, merely suggest the
grandeur of the palace-city on the outskirts of Córdoba, but they’re worth
a visit, even though they’re surely not the posthumous record of his rule
that ar-Rahman meant to leave. Sections are being painstakingly recon-
structed, though, and the Royal Palace doesn’t require much imagination.

Post Office
Córdoba’s main post office is on Cruz Conde

Safety
Córdoba is a low-key town, but it’s also a
city that suffers perennially from unemploy-
ment and economic hardship. With the
large number of tourists that traipse in and
out, often along twisting, confusing streets,
the city has gained an unfortunate reputa-
tion as a place where thieves prey on
tourists — though it has always seemed
safe to me. Although there’s no need to be
alarmed, be careful if you venture beyond
the Jewish Quarter and the area around the
mosque — areas with a noticeable police
presence. Some parts west of Calle de San
Fernando are uncomfortably deserted and
perfect places for thieves-in-waiting. Leave
valuables and extra money at the hotel
safe, and try to carry things that you don’t
want to lose on the front of your body.

Andalusia’s Pueblos
Blancos
In This Chapter
 Exploring Arcos de la Frontera and nearby towns
 Driving through Andalusia’s pueblos blancos
 Discovering Ronda — renowned for its gorge and bullfighting
 Taking side trips to the Costa de la Luz and Costa del Sol
A
ndalusia’s pueblos blancos — small, whitewashed villages clustered
in the rural, mountainous region between Seville and the sea —
represent southern Spain at its most mythical. Sprinkled across a dra-
matic landscape of olive groves and rugged, 1,524m (5,000-ft.) limestone
slopes, these dazzling villages are tucked improbably into rocky bluffs.
Former defensive strongholds, these villages have a perfect whiteness
interrupted only by the ruddy contrast of castle ruins and church bell
towers.
The white towns of Andalusia look as though they were entire North
African villages uprooted and shipped by boat to the south of Spain.
Though the Romans and Visigoths originally settled the region, the
Moors built these memorable medieval villages with impenetrable, Arab-
style alleyways. Ronda and Arcos de la Frontera are the largest of the so-
called white towns, with the best infrastructure for visitors. And they’re
within easy reach of Andalusia’s famous sherry wineries in Jerez, the
beaches of the Costa de la Luz, and glitzy, mega-developed Costa del Sol.
Ronda and the other white towns, mostly scattered about the Sierra de
Grazalema Nature Reserve, are in the mountainous interior of Spain’s
southernmost provinces, Cádiz and Málaga. The only things farther south
are the Andalusian coastlines and Africa. Because they’re mountain
towns, the Pueblos Blancos aren’t as dreadfully hot as Andalusia’s Big
Three (Seville, Granada, and Córdoba). Winter is mild, while spring and
fall are warm but comfortable. The southern coast is all about sun, get-
ting more than 300 sunny days a year. The best time to visit Ronda and
the rest of the white towns is spring (Mar, Apr, and May), when flowers

are in bloom across the valleys. If you can’t make your trip then, fall is
also nice and winter isn’t bad, because the sun shines all year. Likewise,
the coasts are great year-round, but ridiculously crowded in summer.
The towns in this chapter are ideal for a driving itinerary. Arcos and
Ronda are both good bases from which to set out and explore the white
towns, so you may want to spend a night or more in either. Most of the
small white towns are places to spin through, perhaps have lunch, and
then move on.

Arcos: Quiet Inland Beauty
Arcos de la Frontera (usually just called Arcos), perched daringly on a red-
rock promontory high above the Guadalete River, the westernmost of the
pueblos blancos, is also one of the prettiest. The town is so narrow at the
top that it squeezes down to a single street. Arcos doesn’t offer a whole
lot to see — or to do — but it’s a good place to base yourself for the first
half of a pueblos blancos tour. (Jerez de la Frontera also makes a decent
base, but I prefer smaller and less congested Arcos.) Arcos serves as a
natural gateway to the villages; you can set out by car in the morning and
do a loop of the western and southern white towns. Alternatively, it’s a
short trip to Jerez and a good starting point for travels to Cádiz and the
Costa de la Luz.
Getting to and around Arcos
To get to Arcos, you have to drive or take a bus; the closest train desti-
nation is Jerez de la Frontera, which is 32km (20 miles) away.
Driving to Arcos is easy, and, as a bonus, scenic. From Seville, take N-IV
or A-4 south toward Jerez de la Frontera. Take the turn-off, N-342, east to
Arcos. Arcos is 91km (56 miles) from Seville; the drive takes just a bit
more than an hour.
Two buses a day (at 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.) go from Seville’s Santa Justa
Station to Arcos (the bus line is Amarillos: % 95-498-91-84) for about
5€ ($6). You can also take buses from Cádiz and Jerez de la Frontera.
Arcos is so small and hilly that you must rely on your feet to get you up
and down the steep passageways and stairs. To get around the region,
from one pueblo blanco to another, a rental car is the only practical way.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
432
The secret of the bullboards
You may think you’re hallucinating at first. As you drive across the rolling landscape
of the south, a peculiar image rises on the horizon: a Godzilla-sized black bull. Up close,
you quickly realize that the anatomically correct toro is a 9m-tall (30-ft.) wood cutout
of a bull — it looks like a billboard without a product name and slogan attached. And
in fact, that’s exactly what it is. Several decades ago, Osborne, the famous winemaker
in Jerez, erected “bullboards” across Spain to promote its sherries and brandies.
When Spain outlawed all rural billboard advertising, nostalgic Spaniards, who grew
up pointing out the bulls on car trips, protested and convinced Parliament to make an
exception to the law. The government allowed the Osborne billboards to stand, offi-
cially designated National Historic Monuments, as long as they were stripped of all
advertising. Today, of course, they’re the kind of subliminal product placement a mar-
keter can only dream of.

(Unless, of course, you hate to drive and have oodles of money, in which
case you can hire a taxi driver for the day.)
Finding information after you arrive
The tourist information office is on the west side of the Plaza del
Cabildo (% 956-70-22-64). It has maps and also offers guided tours of
town. The tourism office is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Sunday from
10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Staying in style
You can find all the hotels listed here, with the exception of Cortijo Fain,
in Arcos’s zona monumental (historic district).
Hacienda El Santiscal
$$
This welcoming hacienda is a lovely country inn. A 15th-century noble
house set in the countryside 2km (1.2 miles) outside of Arcos, it is thor-
oughly Andalusian in character. The 12 inexpensive rooms are handsomely
if simply decorated, with rich colors and fabrics. Each is different; some
have exposed wood beams, others Mudéjar-style brickwork. The two
suites, which are also attractively priced, have either a fireplace and
lounge or private terrace. There’s a small restaurant serving meals for 25€
($32) and a small round pool with distant views of olive groves and fields
of sunflower and wheat.

El Convento
$$
Tucked into the historic district, down a tiny alleyway behind the parador
(government-run hotel), this little find typifies the allure of the pueblos
blancos. Built right into the Las Mercedarias Convent (hence the name), it
only has 11 rooms, but they’re a good value for the price, and they were
recently renovated. The hotel, which has a fine restaurant (which shares
the hotel’s name and is reviewed later in this chapter) and rooftop terrace,
offers great views over the gorge and countryside. Its charm and comfort
have placed this hotel in high demand. Make a reservation as soon as you
decide to spend the night in Arcos. The restaurant entrance is Marques de
Torresoto 7.

$$
This two-story, 1912 Andalusian town house with a pretty interior patio
was converted into an attractive small hotel. Its 19 rooms are comfortable,
with wicker chairs and long, sheer curtains, but you may just want to
spend all your time relaxing in the whitewashed patio and airy sitting
rooms. Some rooms have splendid views of the olive groves beyond Arcos.

La Casa Grande
$$–$$$
The best small option within Arcos, this charmingly rustic, early-18th-cen-
tury casa señorial was converted into an inn a few years ago by a woman
from Barcelona. The house is built around a light-filled, glass-enclosed
Andalusian patio with marble columns. Its seven warm rooms have origi-
nal tile floors, stucco walls, and unique decorative touches. The expansive
rooftop terrace offers splendid views of Arcos’s old town and of the sur-
rounding countryside. Plus homemade breakfasts are a treat.

Parador de Arcos de la Frontera (Casa del Corregidor)
$$$
You couldn’t ask for a more dramatic location. This parador, one of the
more impressive in the chain, hugs the gorge, unveiling unbelievable views
of the valley below that wow adults and kids alike. The building is on the
site of the Casa del Corregidor, an 18th-century palace and seat of gov-
ernment. The hotel was given a makeover, and the rooms are modern with
a cozy, American Southwest feel. Some of them have small balconies where
you can linger and congratulate yourself for sitting on top of the world in
southern Spain. The staff is uniformly friendly, which isn’t always the case
at paradores.

Dining out
As with hotels, you can find the restaurants listed here in Arcos’s zona
monumental (historic district). In addition to what’s listed in this sec-
tion, the Parador de Arcos de la Frontera, described in the preceding
section, has a handsome dining room serving regional specialties, with 
a fixed-price menu (lunch or dinner) for 25€ ($32).

TAPAS
If you’re not really in the mood for a full sit-down meal, or you’ve already
eaten at the other two main options that I mention in this section, drop into
this amiable downstairs bar, which the cheerful owner says offers “the best
tapas in town.” He doesn’t have a lot of competition, but you can assemble
a fine meal from the chorizo (spicy pork sausage), champiñones (sautéed
mushrooms), and estofado de cordero (lamb stew). The bar occupies tun-
nels, which may date to the tenth century, that run underneath the town’s
old Moorish castle (see the following section, “Exploring Arcos”).

ANDALUSIAN
Part of the hotel of the same name (see the review in the hotel section), the
restaurant’s husband-and-wife team, which also owns the Olivos Hotel,
saved the best for their kitchen. The restaurant is absolutely charming,
and, though tiny, it has won several national culinary awards. They spe-
cialize in local cuisine that they say farmers in the area used to eat, which
means game and meat dishes. For starters, try the abajao (asparagus soup
for two). Main courses include lamb with aromatic herbs and perdiz en
salsa de almendras (partridge in almond sauce). The wine cellar also has
a few nice surprises.

Exploring Arcos
Arcos offers precious little to do, but the point of being here is to take in
the spectacular site of this whitewashed village carved into a crag, and
the views down the gorge and over the countryside. The tiny alleys are
fun to explore, but you can see the whole place in an hour. You can then
plan your tour of the other white towns.
For photo opportunities, head to the Balcón de Arcos, an overlook in the
Plaza del Cabildo — it literally hangs over the edge of the cliff. The old
Moorish castle on the same plaza dates from the tenth century and the
Ben Jazrum dynasty; it has been perfectly restored, but is off-limits to vis-
itors (the owners live in it — lucky devils). The 15th-century Iglesia de
Santa María on the square was built on the site of a mosque in a jumble
of styles: Gothic, Mudéjar, Renaissance, and Baroque, with a splendid
Plateresque facade. Santa María is open daily from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
4 to 6:30 p.m., with guided visits Tuesday through Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 435

Walk down the main street out of Plaza del Cabildo to the Gothic Iglesia
de San Pedro (on Calle San Pedro), which has a terrific Renaissance
altarpiece, as well as paintings by Zurbarán and Ribera. Another great
lookout point nearby for snapping pics is the Mirador de Abades, at the
end of Calle Abades.
Before leaving Arcos for good, take the south exit from the city (toward
Algar), which offers a gorgeous view of the gorge’s sheer drop and the
town above it.
A side trip to Jerez de la Frontera
Jerez de la Frontera (also called simply Jerez), lodged between the sea
and the Sierra de Grazalema Mountains, is the Andalusian capital of wine
and horses. It’s the home of jerez (sherry) and the famous Real Escuela
Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre — the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian
Arts. I suggest you visit one or two of Jerez’s bodegas (wineries) and the
horse school on a day’s excursion from Arcos. If you’re interested in hit-
ting the coast, use the city as a base from which to explore Cádiz and
the Costa de la Luz. (I prefer Arcos as a base, however.)
Getting to and around Jerez
Jerez is a straight 97km (60 mile) drive from Seville along N-IV or A-4.
The drive takes a bit more than an hour.
Two bus companies offer a total of 11 buses a day (5:30 a.m.–8 p.m.)
from Seville’s Santa Justa station to Jerez. The lines are Transportes
Comes (% 95-441-52-01) and Linesur (% 95-498-82-22). Both charge
about 5€ ($6.40) one-way. You can also catch buses from Cádiz and
Arcos de la Frontera.
Likewise, you can take train service from Madrid and Seville. Daily high-
speed AVE trains from Madrid make the trip in two-and-a-half hours
(70€, or $84, one-way). Twenty trains make the trip to Jerez from Seville;
the Altaria train, which takes just under an hour, costs 16€ ($18) one-
way; the regional Andalucía Exprés train, a better deal, takes an hour
and costs 6.25€ ($8) one-way. The Jerez Estación de Tren is at Plaza de
la Estación (% 956-43-23-19).
Finding information after you’ve arrived
The tourist information office is on Alameda Cristina 7, just off Porvera
Larga 39, and next to Santo Domingo (% 956-33-11-50). Pick up a tour
schedule of bodegas and a map plotting their locations. In summer, the
tourism office is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 
8 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.; in winter it’s open Monday 
to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and again Saturday from 5 to 7 p.m.
If you wish to spend the night in Jerez, an excellent new option is Hotel
Bellas Artes, Plaza del Arroyo 45 (% 956-34-84-30; www.hotelbellas
artes.com; 90€, or $108 double). The renovated palace, which has a
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
436

terrific rooftop terrace, is opposite the cathedral in the historic quarter
of town, and the attractively decorated rooms are impeccable.
Checking out some bodegas
Spanish sherry — fortified wine — comes from Jerez. It owes its world-
wide popularity to 18th-century British merchants who were searching
for alternatives to French wines (which were virtually wiped out by dis-
ease). The oh-so-English names of several of the best-known wineries —
Sandeman, Harveys, and Williams — reflect the British interest in sherry.
A visit to one of the approximately 100 bodegas in the area introduces
you to the varieties of sherry. At the tourist office, pick up a schedule of
bodegas that permit visits. The price of the tour includes tastings. Here
are some wineries that you may enjoy.
 Pedro Domecq, San Ildefonso 3 (% 956-15-15-16), Spain’s oldest
sherry winery (established in 1730 and called La Mezquita, or the
Mosque, for its Moorish-style arches), offers tours Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. for 5€ ($6.40), and Saturday and Sunday
for 7€ ($8.95). Reserve in advance.
 González Byass, Manuel María González (% 956-35-70-00; www.
gonzalezbyass.com), makes the ubiquitous Tío Pepe (that’s the
bottle with the sombrero on top). Tours at this, the biggest winery
and tourist attraction in town, cost 7€ ($8.95) and are available
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the hour, as
well as at 6 p.m. Reservations required.
 At Harveys of Bristol, Arcos 57 (% 956-15-10-02), you can take a
tour Monday through Friday at noon. No reservation is necessary.
 Williams & Humbert Limited, Nuño de Cañas 1 (% 956-34-65-39),
which makes Dry Sack sherry, schedules tours for 5€ ($6.40) from 
9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday. Reserve in advance.
Bring on the prancing horses
They prance, they dance, and they piaffe, courvet, and capriole. If you
know what those high-stepping terms mean — or even if you don’t —
you may enjoy a visit to the Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre
(Royal Equestrian School). The goal of training is for the horse and rider
to commune in perfect synchronicity. You can see the dancing horses of
Jerez every Tuesday and Thursday at noon (and mid-July through mid-
Oct on Fri at noon as well). Tickets range from 17€ to 23€ ($20–$28),
11€ to 14€ ($13–$17) children under 14 and seniors. On Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., you can see the
training sessions and take a tour of the stables, stocked with beautiful
Hispano-Arab horses, and visit the Horse Carriage Museum (tour and
admission to museum 6€/$7.70). The school is at Av. Duque de Abrantes
11 (reservations % 956-31-90-08; www.realescuela.org), just north of
the old center. Take Porvera north to Ponce, turn right, and go 2 long
blocks. The school is on the left side.
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 437

Watching time go by in a museum
If you’ve seen the horses prance and you’re too tipsy on sherry to drive
home, pay a visit to Jerez’s curious Museo de los Relojes (Clock Museum).
In the Palacio de Atalaya (Watchtower Palace), more than 300 beautiful
French and English timepieces are on display — one of Europe’s largest
collections — and in working order. Hit the museum at noon for a cool and
deafening demonstration of synchronized chiming. You can find the
museum, where kids can get a kick out of the peacocks strolling the
grounds, just across from the Royal Equestrian School, Cervantes 3 
(% 956-18-21-00). Hours are Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Admission is 2€ ($2.40).
A side trip to Cádiz and the Costa de la Luz
Southern Spain has drawn beach worshippers for decades. If you fear
that a trip to the south of Spain is incomplete without some playa
(beach) and sol (sun), check out the western half of the Andalusian
coast. You can choose between the relatively tranquil Costa de la Luz
(Coast of Light) and the self-indulgent, massively developed, and
touristy Costa del Sol (Coast of the Sun). Attractions at both locations
include rough, sandy beaches with strong winds, golf courses galore,
and all the nightlife and beautiful people you can handle. The Costa de 
la Luz (also called the Cádiz coast), is a short distance from Jerez. The
Costa del Sol is southeast of Ronda; for more information on it, see “Side
trips to Málaga and the Costa del Sol.”

¡Salud! Sherry
If you haven’t already discovered it, slightly chilled jerez, or sherry, is a great accom-
paniment to tapas, or appetizers. Sherry, fortified wine (with an alcohol volume around
16 to 18 percent), is produced within the sherry triangle of towns in Cádiz province:
Jerez de la Frontera, Puerto de Santa María, and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Sherry runs
the gamut from nutty, amber-colored oloroso to dark amontillado and the cream sherry
popular in other countries as a dessert wine (but not in Spain). In my opinion, the best
of the bunch in Andalusia are finos (very dry) and manzanilla (mahn-thah-nee-yah),
complex and delicate, very dry aperitif wines. Both are made from the palomino grape
and are best when served terrifically fresh — so you’re in luck if you’re in the area.
Manzanilla, the driest and palest of these fortified wines, has a very slight tangy and
salty taste and comes only from the seaside town, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, just up the
road from Jerez. Locals drink sherry and manzanilla around the clock, not just as aper-
itifs. They pound them back along with dinner.
A word of caution: If you’re driving around Jerez visiting sherry bodegas, exercise
some restraint when sampling; though they go down easy, remember that these wines
are fortified and pack a deceptive punch.

Area Code
The area code for Arcos is 956, which you
must dial before every number.
Currency Exchange
You can find both a bank and an ATM
around the main plaza on the way into
town.
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 439
Relatively tranquil and unspoiled, the Costa de la Luz extends from
Spain’s southernmost tip to the Portuguese border, fronting the Bay of
Cádiz. If you have limited time, the area of most interest is between Cádiz
and Tarifa, a windswept coastline with fine, unpretentious beaches, dunes,
the shelter of pine trees, and whitewashed fishing villages. If you want
sand and sea, not scene, this area is where to go in the south. A car is the
best way to explore the Costa de la Luz.
Despite its history, the large port city of Cádiz — purportedly the oldest
inhabited city in the West, founded in 1100 B.C. by the Phoenicians —
isn’t overly interesting to most visitors at first. Its seaside decay and
modern suburbs may be a turnoff for some, but if you come to town
looking for a party, you will undoubtedly find it (especially during
February’s annual Carnaval, the wildest in Spain).
For tourist information, visit the Oficina de Información Turística on
Av. Ramón de Carranza 11 (% 956-24-01-62). The best beach in the area
is lively La Victoria. Up the coast (northwest), other recommended
beaches are La Costilla (in Rota) and Regia (in Chipiona). If you want 
to spend the night in Cádiz, the best place is the Parador de Cádiz (for-
merly Hotel Atlántico), Av. Duque de Nájera 9 (% 956-22-69-05; www.
parador.es), where doubles run 110€ to 120€ ($132–$144). The large,
modern, white construction may not be the most attractive, but it sits
right on the coast and has a nice pool. A provincial tourism office offer-
ing regional information is on Calderón de la Barca 1 (% 956-21-13-13).
Between Cádiz and Tarifa are a couple of modest resorts, Conil de la
Frontera and Zahara de los Atunes. At the southern tip of Spain, Tarifa
has the dubious distinction of being the windiest city in Spain — little
wonder that it’s also the windsurfing capital. From here, Morocco is only
about 23km (14 miles) across the Strait of Gibraltar. Morocco was a
stronghold of the Moors, and a tenth-century Moorish castle is here. The
town still retains a very palpable Arab flavor. Tarifa has an excellent,
5km-long (3-mile) white beach, Playa de Lances.
From Jerez de la Frontera, N-443 leads to Cádiz. N-340 leads east along
the coast to Tarifa. Trains arrive from Seville (two hours), Jerez (40 min-
utes), and Córdoba (five hours). The train station (Plaza de Sevilla;
% 956-25-43-01) is on Avenida del Puerto, southeast of town. Buses go
to Cádiz from all over the south, arriving at two terminals: Comes, Plaza
de la Hispanidad 1 (% 956-22-42-71), and Los Amarillos, Av. Ramón de
Carranza 31 (% 956-28-58-52).

The Pueblos Blancos: A Driving Tour
More than two-dozen whitewashed villages dot the Sierra de Cádiz and
the Sierra de Grazalema. The towns — which owe their distinctive look
to the Moors, who inhabited this part of Spain for eight centuries — are
themselves major attractions. Most have castles and cathedrals perched
dramatically above the plains below.
You can easily see all the white villages in under a week, because they’re
that close together. However, spending a week on the route is probably
overkill. In just a day or two, you can visit the four or five most pictur-
esque villages (adding another day to your trip for Ronda). I recommend
that you spend a night in Arcos and at least one night in Ronda (covered
later in this chapter), hitting the towns in between on one or two day
trips. The only practical way to cover more than just Arcos and Ronda is
in a car, with rented wheels (you’re best off renting in one of the larger
cities, such as Seville, Córdoba, or Granada). The region is as scenic as
you’ll find in Spain. In my last run through, I made many more stops on
the side of the road to snap pictures than I did in the actual villages.
If you’re a nature lover, you’ll appreciate that the Sierra de Grazalema
Nature Reserve runs almost the breadth of the route of the pueblos blan-
cos, covering an area of more than 125,000 acres. It includes pine and
oak forests and an important reserve for griffon vultures.
In Arcos de la Frontera or Ronda, pick up a brochure called a Guía
Práctica (Practical Guide) to the pueblos blancos. It includes a map of the
area that’s plenty sufficient, and information on the towns that I don’t
have room to discuss here.
Several routes are available by which you can undertake a tour of the
white towns. In this book, I lay out one possibility for exploring the inte-
rior of the Cádiz and Malaga provinces: beginning in Arcos and winding
up in Ronda. If you want to keep your kilometers down, consider staying

in Ronda and doing a circular trip from there because the best of the
white towns are closer to Ronda than to Arcos. Feel free to mix and
match towns, rearrange the order, or explore some of the smaller places
that I can’t fully describe here. What you see and the route you take are
almost entirely questions of how much time you want to dedicate to
seeing the pueblos blancos.
The area of the pueblos blancos has been inhabited since prehistoric
times, by the Iberians, Celts, Romans (in 1 B.C., the Romans founded Arcos
de la Frontera and Ronda), Visigoths, and, more recently, the Moors. The
Muslims, who dominated Andalusia for 700 years, did the most to shape
these villages, as their winding, narrow alleyways, fortresses, and bril-
liantly whitewashed facades attest. Berber farmers inhabited the villages,
with their towns’ castles suffering constant attacks from armies during the
Christian and Muslim struggles for domination.
In the 20th century, until roads to these mountaintop villages were laid
down, the pueblos blancos continued as remote agricultural villages.
Rugged sorts less savory than farmers took advantage of their strategic
locations and inaccessibility. Smugglers, bandits, and even guerrillas
fighting for the Andalusian resistance against fascist dictator Francisco
Franco took up residence in the pueblos blancos.
From Arcos to Benamahoma
Take C-344 west from Arcos toward El Bosque. There you can either veer
right and check out the leather-producing, industrial (but still white)
town of Ubrique, or, better yet, head to Benamahoma. A sun-kissed, 
tiny village with stone streets and whitewashed houses (what did you
expect?); with wrought-iron balconies, its Arab origins are obvious.
Orange and palm trees line the main street. Benamahoma is the kind of
place where everybody stares at you, as if they expect you to bring the
circus to town. No matter; have a quick look around and check out the
white and tile-roofed church next to the tiniest of bullrings. (A little boy
told me that the bullring was destroyed “by the bulls” and was no longer
in use. I asked him how long ago it happened. “A long time ago,” he said.
“When I was four, and now I’m seven.”)
From Benamahoma to Grazalema
Continue along C-344 west 18km (12 miles) to Grazalema, which is per-
haps the fairest of the white towns. Surrounded by craggy, olive-colored
mountains on all sides, this immaculate town isn’t merely blanco (white);
it’s blanquísimo (extraordinarily white). If you approach it on the road
from Arcos, you’ll circle above it and see unequalled views of its white
houses, church steeples, and tile roofs. Spend a little time here, exploring
its charming central square, three churches, outdoor cafes (perfect for
lunchtime snacks), and wool and ceramic shops. Grazalema offers a
couple of full-fledged restaurants, pensions, and even a discoteca.
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 441

Besides the cafes, for a bite to eat, check out Casa de las Piedras, Las
Piedras 32 (% 956-13-20-14; www.casadelaspiedras.net), which has
excellent home-cooking and cozy rooms (including apartments) to rent
for 45€ to 80€ ($54–$96). Villa Turística de Grazalema, El Olivar, s/n
(% 956-13-21-36), is a relaxing little place with stunning views and
pretty nice rooms for 65€ to 75€ ($78–$90). A step up, if you want to
spend the night, is Puerta de la Villa, Plaza Pequeña 8 (% 956-13-23-76;
www.grazhotel.com), a very attractive and exceedingly comfortable
small hotel in the center of town with a nice long pool and a restaurant.
Doubles here run between 96€ and 120€ ($115–$144).
Hotel El Horcajo (% 95-218-40-80; www.elhorcajo.com) is a working
Andalusian farm and country estate and a splendid rural hotel for
guests. The place is a real treat and an excellent value; it’s well posi-
tioned for travels through the pueblos blancos. Located within the Sierra
de Grazalema Nature Reserve, it features a handsomely decorated 170-
year-old main house, rustic accommodations (family suites with lounges
are in a converted stable), home-cooking, a large pool, as well as olive
trees and gardens. The hotel is 20km (12 miles) northwest of Ronda.
(Take the A-376 toward Seville and at Km 106 turn left for Grazalema on
A-372; the hotel is signposted at the next intersection.) Doubles are 62€
to 78€ ($74–$94) including breakfast.
To buy the woolen blankets Grazalema is still famous for (though its once-
thriving textile industry is nothing like it was), head to Concha Pérez
Coronel’s small shop at Anexo Plaza España 18 (% 956-13-21-41), or
Artesanía Textil de Grazalema, Carretera de Ronda (% 956-13-20-08), 
on the road out of town to Ronda.
So much of Andalusia is dry and in perpetual need of rain, but rain 
frequently bathes the tiny, whitewashed town of Grazalema. In fact,
Grazalema has the distinction of having the highest annual rainfall in
Spain. If you’re here on a sunny day, or if you’ve been to the rainy north-
ern region of the Basque Country, that annual rainfall statistic seems
impossible, but it’s true.
From Grazalema to Zahara de la Sierra
The road to Zahara de la Sierra (usually shortened to “Zahara,” pro-
nounced “thah-ah-rah”) from Grazalema (14km/9 miles along CA-531) is a
bicyclist’s dream and a motorist’s nightmare. Passing along the Puerto
de las Palomas (Dove’s Pass: 1,356m/4,450 ft.), the road winds along the
mountain’s edge, up one side and down the other, until it reaches a view
of a blue-green reservoir stretching out among the olive groves. If the
thought of the hair-raising road from Grazalema to Zahara de la Sierra
makes, well, your hair raise on end, you can take a longer, less danger-
ous and ultimately less picturesque route: C-344 East to C-339 North,
which leads to Zahara. If you have a steady hand, though, take the spec-
tacular short cut, CA-531. And, as your driving teacher told you, go
slowly and try to keep your eyes on the road.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
442

The town of Zahara — stone streets and whitewashed houses (you
might notice a trend here) — is wedged into the side of the mountain,
with an old tower perched on top, overlooking the water. The Moors
founded Zahara de la Sierra, 511 meters (1,676 feet) above sea level, in
the eighth century, and today it’s a national monument. The main square
is a good place to take a break and snack on a couple of tapas and a
glass of manzanilla. Walk around toward the mirador (lookout), past the
18th-century Baroque church, and catch the stone path up the hill,
where a ten-minute climb leads you through cacti and almond trees 
up to a medieval Nasrine castle. The views are sensational. Enter the
spooky 13th-century tower (Torre del Homenaje) at your own risk — it
definitely seems like the kind of place where a hairy hermit will emerge
from hiding. You can climb to the second-floor sun terrace (which would
make a great place for nude sunbathing).
If you want to crash in Zahara, you can choose from a small hotel, Arco
de la Villa, Paseo Nazarí, s/n (% 956-12-32-30), which charges 60€
($72), or two pensiones (guesthouses): Marqués de Zahara, San Juan 3
(% 956-12 30-61), which charges 42€ ($50), and Los Tadeos, Paseo de
la Fuente (% 956-12-30-86), whose rates are about 30€ ($36).
From Zahara to Setenil de las Bodegas
Leaving Zahara, you have a choice. You can either continue north to
Algodonales or east to El Gastor. Both are nice, as are all these towns,
but if you’re in a hurry, continue past El Gastor to Setenil de las Bodegas
(about 55km/34 miles).
Setenil, as it’s known, is one of the most amazing villages in Andalusia —
literally crammed into clefts of rock. You need to park the car at one end
of the village and get out and walk. Look for Calle Herrería, one of the
oldest streets in town. Once lined with blacksmiths’ shops, it has houses
wedged into the massive rock that forms their roofs. Talk about adapting
to your environment. An elderly woman invited me into her small home,
which had sloping cave walls that were painted thick white. Barbara
García, who got around her casas cuevas (cave house — that’s literally
what they’re called in Spanish) on a wheelchair, told me that the house
had been in her family for generations. (She thought her grandparents
built it, but conceded that it could’ve been older still.) Setenil’s Moorish
fortress and twin-towered, 16th-century Gothic church (Iglesia de la
Encarnación) sit high above the rock and white houses.
The road that leads north out of Setenil leads to a mirador and small
church; take the turnoff for postcard views of the town and the cave
houses below.
The town sports a single pensión, in which you can spend the night
under the rock ridges: El Almendral, Carretera Setenil-Puerto del Monte
(% 956-13-40-29), charges just under 40€ ($48).
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 443

If you’re as delighted as I am by town names that reveal their roots, I
have a good one for you. Just outside of Setenil is a tiny settlement, no
doubt an agricultural one, called Venta de Leche, which means “milk 
for sale.”
From Setenil to Olvera
The road between Setenil and Olvera (13km/8 miles) is a dreamscape; 
it winds through olive groves and valleys that suddenly open up and
reveal two perfect pueblos blancos laid out in the distance. The first is
Torre Alhaquime; 4km (21⁄2 miles) beyond it is Olvera, its Moorish tower
and neoclassical church glued to the top of the mountain. Olvera,
declared a national monument, was a Moorish stronghold and a key part
of the Granada Nazari kingdom’s defensive lines. You can easily see why
raiders had little success storming a settlement perched as high as this
one. Head for a small plaza, where the town hall is located, and then
park your car and walk up. Next to the castle is Iglesia de San José, an
unexpectedly large, colonial-looking, pale yellow and brown church
(18th-century) with a clock tower. Access to the 12th-century castle is
through a door across from the church. Its sign says it’s open Tuesday
through Thursday and Saturday and Sunday for visits from 9 a.m. to 
2 p.m. Townsfolk assured me, though, that you can visit during the
morning and afternoon every day but Monday, when it’s closed.
Ronda: Perched on a Gorge
Historic Ronda, which clings to a cliff above a narrow 107m (350-ft.)
chasm, a dizzying ravine created by the Guadalevín River, is one of the
prettiest and most photogenic places in Spain. Whitewashed houses and
palatial mansions crowd the edges of the gorge, and an audacious 18th-
century bridge spans the drop and connects the Old Quarter with the
new expansion, El Mercadillo. Ronda’s precipice is spectacular, but as a
vista it’s got serious competition in the serene valleys and mountain
ranges that extend on either side: the Sierra de las Nieves to the east
and the Sierra de Grazalema to the west.
Beyond the beauty of its incomparable setting, Ronda is one of the oldest
towns in Spain. Its perch was inhabited nearly 3,000 years ago and it was
a Celtic, then Roman, and finally Moorish stronghold before Christian
forces conquered it in the 13th century. The birthplace of modern bull-
fighting, Ronda is home to Spain’s oldest and most beautiful bullring and
an old-fashioned annual festival to go with it.
Ronda exudes charm at every corner, from its ancient minarets and Arab
baths to the oldest bullring in Spain and gorgeous mansions decorated
with ornate iron grilles and potted plants. The largest and perhaps most
tourist-friendly pueblo (it simply has more infrastructure than any of the
other white towns), Ronda’s the one white town to visit if you don’t have
time for others. It’s a perfect complement to Andalusia’s Big Three
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
444

(Seville, Granada, and Córdoba); in fact, you’ll likely find Ronda one of
the highlights of your trip to southern Spain.
Getting there
Ronda is one of the few white towns accessible by means other than a
car. You can hop a train from Seville, Córdoba, or Granada, and a bus
from Seville, Arcos, and Jerez. If you’re really pressed for time, and aren’t
yet in Andalusia, you can even fly from Madrid or Barcelona — though
you have to fly into Málaga, about 100km (62 miles) away, and then
catch a bus or train from there.
If you’re going to Ronda by car, you can take any number of routes from
other spots in Andalusia. Major highways bypass it, though, so you need
to get off and take one of the smaller local highways. From Seville, take
N-334 Southeast and head south, just after El Arahal, on C-339, which
leads directly to Ronda. From Granada, take N-342 West to Olvera, and C-
342 South from there. From Málaga, take scenic C-344 directly to Ronda.
Regional trains along the Algeciras-Granada route stop in Ronda. Note: A
number of trains into and out of Ronda make stops and train changes in
Bobadilla or Antequera. Ronda’s train station, Estación de FF.CC., Av.
Alférez Provisional, s/n (% 95-287-16-73), is on the northwestern edge
of town next to Avenida de Andalucía. The ticket office for RENFE,
Spain’s national railway system, is at Infantes 20 (% 95-287-16-62).
Buses from Seville, Málaga, Arcos, and Jerez travel to Ronda. Los
Amarillos (% 95-231-59-78) travels to and from Seville and Málaga;
Portillo (% 95-236-01-91) also goes to Málaga. Transportes Comes
(% 95-287-19-92) goes to Arcos, Jerez, and Cadiz. The bus station
(Estación de Autobuses) is on Plaza Concepción García Redondo 2 
(% 900-12-35-05), just down Avenida de Andalucía from the train station.
For a taxi, call % 95-287-23-16.
Finding information after you arrive
The regional tourist information office is on Plaza de España 1 (% 95-
287-12-72), next to the parador. It’s open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The municipal tourism office is located on Plaza de Blas Infante (% 95-
218-71-19).
Getting around Ronda
Ronda is so small that using anything other than your own feet is absurd.
The areas of greatest interest to visitors are a handful of streets on either
side of the gorge. If you’re a competent rider, a great way to see the coun-
tryside that surrounds Ronda is via horseback (see “Exploring Ronda,”
later in this chapter).
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 445

If you arrive in Ronda without wheels but decide to rent a car in town 
to explore some of the other white towns, contact Velasco, Lorenzo
Borrego 11 (% 95-287-27-82). If you need a cab to get to the train or bus
station, call Parada de Taxis at % 95-287-23-16, or pick one up in front
of the Plaza de Toros (bullring).
Staying in style
Ronda’s hotels are conveniently located, with the possible exception 
of the Reina Victoria, which is farthest from the bridge. High season in
Ronda is March to October; low season is November to February. Some
hotels charge supplements for local Feria de Pedro Romero and the cor-
rida goyesca (first week of September), as well as Easter week in April.
(For more on these festivals, see Chapter 3.)
Hotel Don Miguel
$$
The parador (reviewed later in this section) isn’t the only hotel with a great
perch over the gorge. This hotel abuts the back side of the river gorge,
which some bedrooms overlook. Rooms are fairly simple, but they’re com-
fortable enough — a decent alternative if you want a dramatic view but
don’t want to pay the dramatically higher prices at the parador across the
street. The hotel, which has been around almost 30 years, has recently
expanded into one of the casas antiguas (old houses) on the same street
(with the same views). Definitely get a room overlooking the gorge. The
hotel restaurant, with a balcony clinging to the cliff, is quite good (see the
review for Don Miguel later in the restaurant section of this chapter).

Hotel La Española
$$$
This simple, good-value small hotel has an excellent location just two min-
utes from the gorge and Plaza de Toros — although you won’t get gorge
views. The comfortable rooms are agreeably decorated (for the most part)
with either deep-green or ochre walls, and feature piped-in music, minibar,
and cheesy antique phones; doubles offer a view of gardens and the dis-
tant mountains beyond Ronda. Rooms have full bathrooms (singles, show-
ers only) and air-conditioning. The downstairs restaurant has a nice
covered terrace.

Hotel Molino del Arco
$$$–$$$$
About 8km (5 miles) outside of Ronda, in the Serranía de Ronda, this
charming finca, or 18th-century farmhouse, is a luxury country inn and a
real retreat, with pretty gardens, four patios, and an old mill. The small
(16-room) inn is relaxing and very tastefully appointed; the rooms are out-
fitted with elegant antiques. This special little place is worthy of a small
splurge if you can afford to spend a few days here; the suites have private
terraces and separate living areas, while the Grand Suite is downright
Hollywood, with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two terraces, a patio
and its own private pool. There’s a very nice small restaurant, with David
Fernández at the helm, as well as two (additional) pools.

Hotel Reina Victoria
$$–$$$
This old British-style hotel, opened in 1906 just after the building of the
British rail line from Bobadilla to Algeciras, was once the swankest game
in town. Today, eclipsed in service and installations by the parador, it has
a slightly dilapidated feeling, more like a museum than a hotel. The gar-
dens, terraces, and pool, though, are still first-rate. Tour groups and
English visitors still appear to enjoy the musty, old-world décor and Nordic
look of the place — sloping roofs, high chimneys, and bold green and white
paint. But to me, it just seems out of place in this town with such distinct
Roman and Moorish roots.

Hotel San Gabriel
$$
A small, family-owned-and-operated hotel in a gorgeous 1736 mansion, San
Gabriel is my favorite place in Ronda and one of my favorite hotels in
Spain. Not only that, but it’s among the best deals I have come across in
my travels in Spain. The hotel is a labor of love created by a father, his
sons, and his daughter. The family worked for 15 years to meticulously
select the antiques for every nook and cranny of every welcoming room
and complete the painstaking restoration before finally opening it in
December 1998. They’re so bent on it seeming homelike that they’ve incor-
porated “Your House in Ronda” into the name, and individual travelers as
well as small families feel equally welcome. Every detail is perfect, cozy,
and utterly charming. Located in the artistic and historical center of
Ronda, just a five-minute walk east of the gorge, it has Moorish accents,
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 447

antique-leaded and stained-glass windows, an antique carved central stair-
case, and even a TV salon with seats salvaged from Ronda’s first theater.
Each of the 22 rooms is different from the next; my favorites are nos. 4, 9
(a very suite deal), and 15, a charming top-floor, bilevel room.

Parador de Ronda
$$$
You can get dizzy staying at Ronda’s national parador. The hotel is backed
right up to the edge of the gorge, next to the stunning bridge that spans its
gulf. Built in 1994, the parador is modern and extremely comfortable —
exactly the reasons some locals have criticized it, for not doing a good
enough job assimilating into Ronda’s collection of old mansions and white-
washed houses. It’s hardly a modern white elephant, though, and most vis-
itors find the parador a luxurious, even handsome, place to stay. It’s also
one of the friendliest paradores I’ve stayed in. Many of the 78 nicely
appointed rooms have small balconies. Many also have unrivalled views of
the 152m (500-ft.) fall of the gorge and the bridge, which is illuminated at
night, or the gorgeous mountainous countryside beyond. Make sure your
room is one with a view. Children will appreciate the outdoor pool, as well
as the hotel’s dramatic location overlooking the gorge.

Dining out
In addition to the in-town restaurants below, the luxury country inn Hotel
Molino del Arco (reviewed above), on the outskirts of Ronda, is a perfect
place for a romantic dinner. The Parador also has a very good restaurant.
Casa Santa Pola
$$$
SPANISH/ANDALUSIAN
A casa noble built over the foundations of a ninth-century mosque, this
handsome restaurant overlooks the gorge, near the Casa del Rey Moro.
Casa Santa Pola is surprisingly elegant, with terra-cotta-colored walls and
white tablecloths, but the outdoor tables on the terrace are the most cov-
eted. The menu is varied, though sticking with such basics as sopa de
mariscos (shellfish soup), cochinillo (roast suckling pig), paella (rice,
seafood, and meat casserole), and the good selection of salads is perhaps
the best idea. Behind the beautiful 18th-century front door of Casa Santa
Pola is an antiques museum with some extraordinary furnishings.

Don Miguel
$$–$$$
ANDALUSIAN/SPANISH
This restaurant, attached to a small hotel by the same name (reviewed ear-
lier in this chapter), has one distinct advantage: location, location, loca-
tion. Don Miguel’s terrace dining area swings out over the river gorge — a
spectacular site for a meal. You can also sit in the large indoor dining
rooms if the sun’s beating down or if it’s chilly outside. A great surprise —
in a place that may rest on its location — the kitchen is one of Ronda’s
best. Try the oxtail stew or the partridge casserole.

Restaurante Pedro Romero
$$
ANDALUSIAN
Ronda has long been considered the cradle of Spanish bullfighting; if you
missed seeing a corrida (bullfight), you can always come here, just across
the street from Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. Named for a legendary Ronda
bullfighter (who is said to have slain nearly 6,000 bulls during his career),
the restaurant is all taurine ambience — posters of bullfights, photos of
matadors, and, of course, stuffed bulls’ heads line the walls. The simple
surroundings have quite a bit of charm, touristy though they may seem.
Logically, it’s a place for meat — rabo de toro a la Rondeña (Ronda-style
oxtail), lamb, veal, and rabbit. Start off with a house garlic soup.

Tragabuches
$$$–$$$$
CREATIVE ANDALUSIAN
The best restaurant in Ronda is a stylish venture that’s pretty uptown for
this laid-back pueblo. The downstairs back dining room (much preferable
to the staid front room) has clean white walls and bubblegum-colored
tablecloths and seat covers. This is evidently not your typical Spanish
mesón (inn). The young chef, Daniel García, is as daring as the décor.
Dishes are creative, adventurous, and very successfully presented. I had
a thick potato soup with salt-cured ham followed by oxtail raviolis with a
puree of chestnuts. Also tempting was the sea bass with white beans and
blood sausage. The wine cellar has some very well-chosen bottles, espe-
cially those under the heading “the great wines of Spain.”

Exploring Ronda
Spain’s oldest bullfighting ring, Plaza de Toros de la Real Maestranza
de España, built in 1785, is one of its most storied and most beautiful.
Constructed of limestone with double arches and 136 Tuscan columns,
it’s linked forever in the minds of Spaniards to the legend of Ronda-
native Pedro Romero, who is considered the father of modern bullfight-
ing. A different kind of celebrity graced its sands a couple of years back
when Ronda’s ring was the stage for a matador romance music video by
Madonna.
Across the Plaza de Toros is the Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum),
one of the better ones in Spain and a big hit with the kids. Its exhibits
include bulls’ heads, suits of lights worn by Romero and other matadors,
and a second floor dedicated to foreigners involved in toros — including
photographs of Orson Welles, and the paintings and suit of John Fulton,
a Philadelphia-born bullfighter and artist who lived most of his life in
Seville. Pedro Romero, the 18th-century killer of nearly 6,000 bulls, was
the inspiration for Francisco de Goya’s remarkable series of etchings 
on Tauromaquia. The first week of September, Ronda hosts a corrida
goyesca, a festival that recreates the atmosphere of an 18th-century bull-
fight in honor of Romero. Men and women decked out in fancy dress ride
through the streets on horse carriages, and bullfighting aficionados
come from all over the world to see classical exhibitions.
Museo Taurino is located at Plaza Teniente Arza, right off of Virgen de 
la Paz (% 95-287-15-39; www.rmcr.org). Admission is 5€ ($6.40); pur-
chase your ticket from the small shop outside. From November through
February the museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; from March 
to mid-April, hours are from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and mid-April through
October, daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Ronda’s newest museum is the impressive and extremely well laid-out
Museo Lara, a private collection of arts and antiques housed in the18th-
century Palacio de los Condes de la Conquista. The mansion formerly
served as the residence of members of the Spanish Royal Family on visits
to Ronda. The museum contains some 5,000 artifacts contained in seven
separate collections, including galleries dedicated to clocks, weapons, sci-
ence, archaeology, knives, bullfighting, and musical instruments. The Lara
Museum is located on Calle Armiñán 29, next to the Tajo (% 95-287-12-63;
www.museolara.org). It’s open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission
is 2.50€ ($3), students and seniors 2€ ($2.40).
More cool things to see and do
Ronda is more than just a bullfighting town, though bullfighting is the
primary attraction. A number of other activities can entertain you while
you’re here.

Meandering through magnificent mansions
Ronda is the site of several exceptional aristocratic homes open to visi-
tors. Casa del Marqués de Salvatierra is a noble Renaissance palace
with intricate iron grilles and pre-Columbian figures (sticking their
tongues out) adorning its rich Baroque facade. The mansion has
remained in the hands of a single family and its descendents since 1475.
The original Marquis Salvatierra was a well-traveled conquistador who,
with orders from the Catholic monarchs, arrived in Ronda to engineer its
capture from the Moors. The palace was constructed from a group of
15th-century Arab houses — a gift to the Marquis after the conquest of
Ronda. The mansion has wonderful gardens and interior details. The
family that owns it still vacations here in the month of August when it’s
closed to the public. The palace, located at Marqués de Salvatierra, s/n
(% 95-287-12-06; admission: 3€, or $3.60), is open from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and 4 to 7 p.m.; closed Thursday and Sunday afternoons. You may have
to knock at the heavy wooden door and wait for an attendant to answer;
small-group tours are only in Spanish. However, check first with the
tourism office to be certain of the privately held palace’s status; even if
it’s not open for tours, take a look at its wonderful balcony and carved
facade.
Just across the street is Casa del Rey Moro (Moorish King’s House), an
improbably named 18th-century palace with an unusual feature that you
have to see to believe. Within the palace is a 14th-century water mine, a
secret military structure carved out of the gorge by the Moors. Descend
the poorly lit, zigzagging, and damp staircase into the depths until you
finally reach the ravine’s bottom. Along the way, you pass the former
Weapons Room, a secret escape exit, and the Room of Secrets, where the
acoustics of the tiny room reportedly protected confidential conversa-
tions. It’s said that the Moors employed Christian slaves to bring water
up from the river. Fortunately, you don’t have to do anything more than
make the long climb back to the top of the never-ending steps and then
emerge to enjoy the sumptuous gardens (designed in 1912) and the ter-
rific views of the gorge and countryside. The palace, located at Cuesta
de Santo Domingo 17 (% 95-218-72-00), is open daily from 10 a.m. to 
8 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.10) for adults, children 2€ ($2.40).
On the other side of the gorge are two more handsome homes with spec-
tacular views to the south of Ronda. They’re open daily from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. The 14th-century Palacio de Mondragón, Plaza de Mondragón,
s/n (% 95-287-84-50), was built by the Moorish king of Ronda, Abomelic,
in 1314 and was later inhabited by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand 
and Isabel. In Moorish style, the palace has several interior courtyards
adorned with mosaics and beautiful arcaded patios. It also has some of
the best views in the city, looking back at the river gorge. The mansion
today houses a small Natural History Museum, of less interest than the
house itself. The mansion is open Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to
7:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 451

2€ ($2.40); free for children under age 14. Nearby, the Casa de Don Juan
Bosco, Tenorio 20 (% 95-287-16-83), is most notable for its lovely ter-
race, with a beautiful fountain and views. Admission for adults is 2€
($2.40) and for children, 1€ ($1.20).
Soaking up the Moorish past
Ronda’s 13th-century Baños Arabes (Arab baths), east of Marqués de
Salvatierra (% 95-287-09-37), are remarkably well preserved — perhaps
the finest surviving example in Spain. From above they don’t look like
much, and the first chamber is just a series of open-air arches. But the
two main chambers, with star-shaped openings that allow light to
stream through, and perfect horseshoe arches, are undeniably beautiful.
A nearby aqueduct carried water from the point where the two rivers
converge. You can reach the baths from the staircase that leads down
through the Puerta de Felipe V, just beyond the Casa del Rey Moro and
Palacio Salvatierra. They are open Tuesday through Saturday from 
9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Closed Sunday and Monday. Admission for adults
is 2€ ($2.40) and for children, 1€ ($1.20); on Sundays admission is free.
Walking on Ronda’s wild side
Tajo means “sheer drop,” and Ronda’s vertiginous ravine certainly is
that. The views from the 18th-century Puente Nuevo, a spectacular feat
of engineering across the gorge, are exhilarating. Inside the so-called
New Bridge is a Centro de Interpretación, which offers additional infor-
mation about the construction of the bridge and a four-minute audiovi-
sual presentation. If you have the time and energy, don’t stop at just
staring down one side and then the other. A path from the Plaza de
Campillo, in the old town, leads down to the bottom of the ravine,
through almond trees and pink blossoms, for stunning vistas of the
bridge from the bottom up (at sunset, the bridge is bathed in honey-
colored light). A less strenuous walk through the Alameda del Tajo (Tajo
Promenade), north of the bullring, is nearly as exhilarating. A perch
hangs out over the cliff, providing great views.
A walk on the east side of the gorge leads to the 18th-century Felipe V
Gate; the Puente Viejo, the old Roman bridge; and the Puente Arabe,
the Arab bridge. A walk south from there, past the Arab baths, passes
through the old Jewish Quarter and Ronda’s ancient ramparts. Look for
the Renaissance Carlos V Gate and 13th-century Almocábar Gate, part
of the ancient walls and old entrance to the city.
The countryside beyond Ronda is perfect for more adventurous hikes
and even trail-riding on horseback. If you bring boots or very sturdy
sneakers, check with the tourism office for information about trails that
lead out into the surrounding serranía (mountains).
Shopping
Around Plaza del Socorro and Plaza de Abela and the streets Villanueva,
Nueva, and Los Remedios are where you can find most of Ronda’s shops.

Calle Espinel 16 (% 95-287-21-93).
Side trips to Málaga and the Costa del Sol
Spain’s much-celebrated and sun-drenched southern coast is the focus
of many a vacation to Spain — not to mention of retirement dreams,
especially among Brits, Germans, and Arabs. Many are surely attracted
by the legions of cheap airfares and package deals to Spain’s “Sunny
Coast.” Yet the area pales so dramatically in comparison with the rest of
Spain’s historic and natural bounty that I can’t legitimately recommend
it as a top destination. But, if you’re the type to camp out on the beach
during the day and party it up all night long in the clubs, perhaps even
for the duration of your Spanish holiday, you hardly need me either to
dissuade you or to validate your decision.
The Costa del Sol lives and breathes glitz, and unless you’re easily
swayed by glamour and ostentatious shows of wealth (and lots, truth be
told, of gente bella, or beautiful people), I don’t recommend spending
much time along Spain’s overrated “Sun Coast.” Though it enjoys more
than 300 days of sunshine a year, to me it’s the least interesting part of
Andalusia. And parts of it are downright grotesque in the crude concrete
overdevelopment that has marred the coast.
Bustling Málaga (mah-lah-gah), the birthplace of Pablo Picasso and
Antonio Banderas (now there’s a pair of Latin lovers), is a pleasant port
city that doesn’t get too caught up in the resort sheen of the rest of the
Costa del Sol. Locals stroll the attractive waterfront promenade, Paseo del
Parque, lined by palm trees and jacarandas and bustling with babies and
ice-cream vendors. Despite massive development designed to improve the
city’s standing with tourists, Andalusia’s second-biggest city still enjoys a
pleasant, tropical feel. The long-awaited Picasso Museum is finally draw-
ing plenty of visitors to the revolutionary artist’s hometown.
If, despite my cranky objections, you still like the sound of the Costa del
Sol (or maybe you just scored a spectacular package deal), the best
places to visit are Marbella and Nerja. Torremolinos, a Mediterranean
beach resort (16km/10 miles west of Málaga) known throughout Spain and
much of Europe, is a long line of concrete hotel boxes shuttling inexpen-
sive package tours in and out — the epitome of coastal overdevelopment.
Getting to and around Málaga and the Costa del Sol
Málaga is 93km (58 miles) southeast of Ronda. By car, take the interior
road C-344 from Ronda (if you want to go along the coast, you have to
drop down to San Pedro de Alcántara via C-339 and then head east on 
N-340). A direct train travels from Madrid in approximately five to 
six hours. (Estación de Renfe: Strachan, s/n; % 902-24-02-02 or
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 453

95-236-02-02). By bus, Los Amarillos (% 95-218-70-61) and Portillo
(% 95-287-22-62) both make the trip from Ronda. The Estación de
Autobuses (% 95-235-00-61) is on Paseo de los Tilos, s/n.
Málaga has an international airport, Av. García Morato, s/n (% 95-204-
88-84), 8km (5 miles) southeast of the city; flights from Spanish and
European cities arrive at Terminal A; flights from other countries arrive
at Terminal B. From the airport into town, take a bus, train, or taxi. From
the airport, bus no. 19 runs from 6:30 a.m. to midnight daily (30 minutes
to city center; % 95-221-02-95; 1€, or $1.20). Regular electric trains (1€,
or $1.20) from the airport serve the city of Málaga (15 minutes), as well
as other Costa del Sol destinations. To many towns in Costa del Sol or
the Málaga province, though, taxis are the only direct service. Call
Unitaxi (% 95-235-15-51) if you need a taxi. If you want to rent a car to
get around, contact Avis (% 95-221-66-27), Budget (% 901-201-12-12),
Europcar (% 95-235-68-12), or Hertz (% 902-402-405).
Driving to Marbella and other points along the Costa del Sol is easy
enough, though the main roads are notorious. Carretera Nacional N-340
is a stretch 100km (62 miles) long, which runs through coastal towns
and urban sprawl and has a reputation as one of Spain’s most dangerous
roads (especially bad is the section west of Marbella). A new Autopista
del Sol has been built, but its high tolls (8€, or about $10, from end-to-
end in high season) have prompted many locals to boycott it. If you take
N-340, watch out for pedestrians and drunk drivers. From Ronda, take 
C-339 south and head east on coastal road N-340. It’s a total of 60km 
(37 miles). From Málaga, head west along N-340 for 67km (42 miles). If
you don’t want to drive, you can take one of the more than 20 buses per
day that travel between Málaga and Marbella.
The regional tourism information office in Málaga is located at Pasaje de
Chinitas 4 (% 95-221-34-45). If you’ve flown into Málaga’s International
Airport, check out the tourism information office for help (% 95-204-
84-84).
Málaga: Picasso’s home and a place to promenade
By far the biggest attraction in town is the city’s very own Museo Picasso
Málaga, in a 16th-century Renaissance palace, the Palacio de los Condes
de Buenavista. It displays more than 200 of the artist’s works that were
purchased from Picasso’s grandson and daughter-in-law, Bernard and
Christine Ruiz-Picasso (the widow of Picasso’s eldest son, Paul). The
museum, which includes works ranging from early portraits, painted in
the late 19th century, to late-career works from the 1970s, put the artist’s
birthplace next in line of importance after Paris and Barcelona in terms of
Picasso collections. In the basement is a display of the archeological
finds dug up during the restoration of the palace, including remains of a
Phoenician wall and tower dating to the seventh century A.D.
The museum, on San Agustín 8 (% 95-212-76-00; www.museopicasso
malaga.org), is open Tuesday to Thursday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.;
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia

Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and Sunday and holidays
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission to the permanent collection is 6€
($7.20) for adults and 3€ ($3.60) for seniors and students; to the tempo-
rary collection, 4.50€ ($5.40) for adults and 2.25€ ($2.70) for seniors and
students; combination tickets good for both are 8€/4€ ($9.60/$4.80).
You can purchase advance tickets by calling % 901-24-62-46.
Also in town is Picasso’s childhood home, where the great artist was
born in 1881 but lived for only three years. The Casa Natal de Picasso,
Plaza de la Merced 15 (% 95-206-02-15), is home to the Pablo Ruiz
Picasso Foundation and has a smattering of Picasso’s belongings and
photographs, as well as exhibits of contemporary Spanish art. It’s open
daily from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Admission is 1€ ($1.20), free for seniors
and for children under 17.
Málaga shines in summer, when its population swells, and one of the high-
lights of a visit here is a stroll along the promenade, Paseo del Parque,
along which you can stop for ice cream or tapas and fresh seafood. You’ll
have plenty of company, because the daily (or several times-daily) paseo
seems to be the city’s great pastime. Among the city’s more traditional
sights is the splendid 11th-century Alcazaba (Moorish fortress), Plaza de
la Aduana (% 95-222-72-30). Admission to the Alcazaba museum is 1.90€
($2.30), or 3.15€ ($3.80) joint admission along with Castillo de Gibralfaro,
on Monte Gibralfaro (% 95-222-51-06), a well-restored16th-century
Moorish fortress with a museum inside. The Alcazaba is open Tuesday
through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. in winter, and from 9:30 a.m. to 
8 p.m. in summer. The ramparts provide excellent views of the city. Near
the entrance to the Alcazaba is a Teatro Romano (Roman Theater) dating
from the first century A.D. and only discovered in 1951. The Catedral de
Málaga, Calle Molina Lario/Plaza Obispo (% 95-221-59-17), is a peculiar
mix of 16th-century architectural styles with a small Museo Catedralicio of
religious art. Admission is 3.50€ ($4.20); it’s open Monday through Friday
from 10 a.m. to 6:45 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.
The Museo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Museum), which possesses works
by such Andalusian greats as Zurbarán, Ribera, Murillo, and Picasso, is
awaiting a new home; in the meantime, some of its collection is being
displayed at the Palacio de la Aduana, Plaza de la Aduana, s/n (% 95-
212-85-00). Admission is free; the palace is open Tuesday through Friday
from 3 to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Also worth a visit in Málaga is the Jardín Botánico-Histórico La
Concepción, Carretera de Las Pedrizas (C. N. 331), Km 166 (% 95-225-
21-48), gorgeous, 150-year-old tropical botanical gardens on the out-
skirts of town. They’re open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
in summer and from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in winter. Guided visits cost
3.15€ ($3.80). To get there, take a no. 2 bus from the Alameda or a taxi
(about 5€, or $6.40).
The two paradores are your best lodging options. In the historical quar-
ter of Málaga, facing the Alcazaba, is the handsome, midsize Parador de
Chapter 16: Andalusia’s Pueblos Blancos 455

Málaga Gibralfaro, Monte Gibralfaro (% 95-222-19-02; www.parador.
es). Doubles cost 140€ to 150€ ($168–$180). Located next to the
Gibralfaro Castle, it has a top-floor swimming pool and splendid
panoramic views of the harbor and coastline. Take the coastal road, Paseo
de Reding, which eventually becomes Paseo de Sancha. Turn left onto
Camino Nuevo. The other parador, 10km (6 miles) from Málaga, is a
golfer’s delight, wedged between a fine golf course and the Mediterranean.
Parador de Málaga-Golf, Carretera de Málaga (% 95-238-12-55; www.
parador.es). Doubles cost 125€ to 135€ ($150–$162).
For dining, the Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro occupies a beautiful spot
on Monte Gibralfaro and has a good-value menu (28€/$32) and great
views, and Antonio Martín, Paseo María Antonio Machado 16 (% 95-
222-72-98), along the Malagueta or Paseo Marítimo, is one of Málaga’s
most traditional (and upscale) seafood restaurants.
Marbella: A stylish resort
The Costa del Sol’s most stylish and monied resort, Marbella is where
the perennially tanned go to lounge on yachts and play golf. As upscale
as it is, Marbella still has one of the cheesiest public works I’ve ever
seen: an overpass/welcome gate with huge block letters spelling out MAR-
BELLA above the road into town. Despite that introduction, the red-paved
old town with whitewashed alleyways is spotless and pretty enjoyable
(even if it’s expensive as all get out). Its two invariably packed beaches
are La Fontanilla and El Fuerte.
After you’re suitably bronzed, night is the time to shine. Wear white and
lots of jewels and head to Marbella’s innumerable bars and discotecas. If
you own a yacht (or if you want to meet someone who does), the right
place to go is the port, Puerto Banús. The chic places to party late are
Discoteca Olivia Valere (Carretera Istán, next to the mosque) and Oh!,
in the Hotel Don Carlos (Carretera Cádiz, Km 198.5). If you didn’t bring
the right duds (and if you didn’t pack your very best jewelry, then you
didn’t, trust me), you can always drop in on one of the relaxed tapas
bars in Marbella’s Old Quarter.
Marbella’s Tourist Information Office is at Glorieta de la Fontanilla, s/n
(% 95-282-28-18). Hours are Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 
8 p.m. and Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Another tourist office with
the same hours is on Plaza de los Naranjos (% 95-282-35-50).
If you want to snob-knob with the fashionable and spend the night in
Marbella, pull your fancy rental up to Marbella Club Hotel, Boulevard
Príncipe Alfonso von Hohenlohe, s/n (% 800-448-8355 in the United
States, or % 95-282-22-11; www.uk.marbellaclub.com). Doubles go
from 250€ to 450€ ($300–$540). The elegant hotel, originally a prince’s
estate, is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, with classically
decorated, bungalow-style rooms. More affordable is Hotel El Fuerte,
Av. del Fuerte, s/n (% 800-448-8355 in the United States, or 902-34-34-10;
www.hotel-elfuerte.es). Doubles cost between 134€ and 217€

Currency Exchange
You can find banks and ATMs along the
town’s main drag, Virgen de la Paz. An

($161–$260) with discounts available for online reservations. Built in the
1950s, it’s on the beach and surrounded by gardens, with a shaded pool
across from a lagoon. Both hotels have deals with local golf courses.
Nerja: A huge prehistoric cave
About 50km (30 miles) east of Málaga, the village of Nerja (nehr-hah) has
good beaches, an attractive Old Quarter, and a charming seaside prome-
nade. The Balcón de Europa, a bell tower surrounded by palm trees, has
excellent views of the sea and rocky coastline. But Nerja’s biggest attrac-
tion is outside town (about a 35-minute drive from Málaga): La Cueva de
Nerja, a huge cave inhabited 25,000 years ago. Accidentally discovered
by a group of kids about 40 years ago, it’s full of well-illuminated stalac-
tites and chambers, as well as Paleolithic cave drawings, and is large
enough to host a summer festival (July and Aug) of concerts and ballet.
The cave, which has been outfitted (some might say cheesily) with lights
and music, is in the hills above Nerja, on Carretera de la Cueva, s/n 
(% 95-252-95-20; www.cuevadenerja.es). Hours are daily from 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and from 4 to 8 p.m. Admission is 6€ ($7.20) for adults, 4.25€
($5.10) for children ages 6 to 12. Children ages 5 and under are free.
Buses depart hourly from Muelle de Heredia in Málaga from 7 a.m. to 
8 p.m. Return buses are also hourly until 8:15 p.m. The trip takes about
one hour.
One of the best places to stay in Nerja is the Parador de Nerja, Almuñecar
8, Playa de Burriana-Tablazo (% 95-252-00-50; www.parador.es).
Doubles range from 130€ to 140€ ($156–$168). A modern parador, it is
perched on a cliff and has great views of the sea, coast, and mountains.
You can take a lift down to the beach.
Another excellent option, especially for families, is the studio apartments
of Toboso apar-turis, Paseo Balcón de Europa 4 (% 95-252-86-88; www.
tobosoaparthotel.com). In the historic center of Nerja, the 30 apart-
ments (many of which have sea views) are modern and nicely equipped.
On the premises are indoor and outdoor pools, a gym and a sauna,
restaurant, and Irish pub. Studio apartments range from 79€ to 141€
($96–$169), one-bedroom apartments from 127€ to 193€ ($152–$232).
Casa Luque, Plaza Cavana 2 (% 95-2512-10-04), is a friendly and fancy
family-run joint serving traditional Andalusian dishes.

Chapter 17
Granada
In This Chapter
 Getting around Granada
 Choosing a place to stay
 Seeing the Alhambra, the spectacular palace-fortress of the Moors
 Striking out on side trips to caves and the Sierra Nevada
S
pain’s magical mix of east and west — its shared history of Muslim
and Christian culture and conflict — comes into sharpest focus in
Granada. The seat of the Nasrid Dynasty and part of al-Andalus (the
name given to Muslim Spain), Granada was the last Moorish capital on
the Iberian Peninsula, where the Moors ruled for eight centuries. The
Moors built the legendary Alhambra, a monumental red palace-fortress
and the greatest symbol of Muslim Spain, in the foothills of the snow-
capped Sierra Nevada, overlooking a broad, fertile valley. The Alhambra
was the Islamic embodiment of an earthly paradise, and its murmuring
fountains and regal palaces were testament to the kingdom’s power and
sophistication.
Ever since the 19th century, when the American author and diplomat
Washington Irving happened upon the abandoned Alhambra and reintro-
duced it to the Western world, most travelers to Spain have put Granada
at the top of their must-see list. Indeed, the Alhambra is perhaps the
single greatest sight in Spain and one of the most glorious monuments 
in Europe.
The Moors may have been expelled by Spain’s Reconquest in the 15th
century, but a lasting Moorish influence remains palpable in Andalusia.
Granada’s favorite son, Spain’s great modern poet Federico García Lorca,
was deeply enamored of his native city, its magical setting, and the linger-
ing legends of the Moors. “Only sighs glide/on the waters of Granada,” he
wrote. As a visitor to the city, you can both wade into its Moorish past
and trace García Lorca’s life, which ended tragically in Granada during
the Spanish Civil War.
The weather in Granada is as dramatic as the Alhambra: It’s hotter than
blazes in summer and frequently downright cold in winter. Granada sits
at an altitude of 671m (2,200 ft.), so nights are much cooler than days.
Avoid going to Granada in July and August unless you have a serious

masochistic streak. Though it gets blisteringly hot, the Alhambra is still
overrun with summer tourists. The best time to visit Granada is spring,
followed closely by fall. In winter the snow-topped peaks of the Sierra
Nevada beckon skiers. But you won’t want to come to Granada between
Christmas and New Year’s — the Alhambra is closed.
Getting There
Granada is a convenient destination, no matter where you’re coming
from or how you choose to arrive.
By plane
Granada’s Aeropuerto Nacional, or Armilla airport (% 958-24-52-00) 
is 15km (9 miles) south of the city, on Carretera de Málaga, s/n. Daily
flights arrive from Madrid, Barcelona, Majorca, Valencia, and the Canary
Islands. Armilla isn’t a huge or complicated airport, and it does have an
easy-to-locate tourism information office as well as an ATM.
An airport bus that costs 3€ ($3.60; % 958-49-01-64) ferries passengers
between the airport and Plaza de Isabel la Católica. It departs only about
every two hours. Travel time from the airport to downtown is less than
45 minutes. Taxis, lined up outside the terminals, charge about 18€ ($22)
to the center of Granada or 23€ ($28) to the Albaycín district.
By car
National highway N-323 connects Granada to the north, including Madrid,
via N-IV/E-5, and the southern coast. From Córdoba, take N-432 and from
Seville, A-2.
By train
Express trains (called TALGO) from Madrid to Granada take about six
hours. Two trains per day, leaving at 8:10 a.m. and 4:47 p.m. make the
trip (31€–35€/$37–42). Trains also arrive from Seville (3 hours; 20€, 
or $24) as well as from Barcelona, Valencia, Málaga, and Córdoba.
The train station is Estación de RENFE de Granada (% 958-24-02-02 or
958-27-12-72; www.renfe.es); it’s at Av. Andaluces, s/n. The ticket office
is downtown at Calle de los Reyes Católicos 45 (% 958-22-31-19).
By bus
Granada’s main bus terminal for national departures is Estación de
Autobuses de Granada, located at Carretera de Jaén, s/n (% 958-18-
54-80). Six buses per day come in from Seville (the trip takes three-and-
a-half hours) and from Córdoba (three hours), and three buses per day
arrive from Ronda (three hours). You can also take a bus from Cádiz,
Málaga, and Guadix. Contact Alsina Graells, Carretera de Jaén, s/n 
(% 958-18-54-80), for routes and additional information.

Orienting Yourself in Granada
Granada seems frightfully congested and not especially appealing on your
way in from the web of highways outside the city to Gran Vía de Colón,
the city’s principal artery. Perpendicular to Gran Vía de Colón is the other
main downtown artery, running north-south, Calle de los Reyes Católicos.
Near their intersection is the cathedral and most hotels, restaurants, and
shops. The Alhambra sits atop a hill, northeast of Plaza Nueva, and the
other neighborhood of interest, the Albaycín district, occupies the hill
directly facing the Alhambra.
Introducing the neighborhoods
In relatively small Granada, three areas are of interest to visitors. The
Alhambra Hilltop and Albaycín districts face each other on opposite
hills, and the downtown area, which contains the cathedral and most
hotels, is wedged between them.
Alhambra Hilltop
The ancient Nasrid Palace complex sits regally on a hill overlooking
Granada. The neighborhood has only a small number of restaurants, 
but people come here for the Alhambra and Generalife (the majestic
Moorish palace complex and summer retreat), as well as the Parador
Nacional San Francisco, within the Alhambra grounds. The latter is
Spain’s most popular parador (see the listing in “The top hotels” section
later in the chapter).
Cathedral Quarter (Downtown Granada)
The centro, or downtown Granada, also called the Cathedral Quarter, is
congested but compact and easy to navigate. This neighborhood is the
business center of Granada, where you find most hotels, restaurants,
and shops. Look for the Cathedral, Granada’s great Christian monument;
the Royal Chapel, where the Catholic monarchs are buried; and impor-
tant sights just beyond downtown: the La Cartuja Monastery and poet
García Lorca’s childhood home, Huerta de San Vicente.
Albaycín
The old Arab Quarter, an evocative warren of whitewashed houses and
tiny alleyways climbing the hillside, begs you to explore it. This area 
has few conventional sights, other than the mesmerizing views of the
Alhambra and Sierra Nevada mountains, but the whole neighborhood is
itself an attraction, an integral part of Granada. Today you can find a
growing number of small boutique hotels with great character located
here in historic villas. In Albaycín are El Bañuelo, ancient Arab baths;
the remains of old Arab walls; and nearby Sacromonte, the old gypsy
neighborhood now awash in touristy flamenco caves.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
462

Finding information after you arrive
Granada has a denser web of tourism information offices than just about
any city in Spain. Tourism offices are located at the airport; Virgen Blanca
9 (% 902-40-50-45), open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Real de
la Alhambra s/n, near the ticket offices (% 958-22-95-75), open daily from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Santa Ana 2 (% 958-57-52-02), open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Plaza Mariana Pineda 10 (% 958-24-
71-28), open Monday through Friday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 
4:30 to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Getting around Granada
Granada is relatively compact but quite congested (don’t use your car to
get around). It’s a good walking city if you’re confined to the area around
Plaza Nueva and the Alhambra and Albaycín districts, but some of the
hills may prove challenging. Try the following alternative methods for
checking out Granada.
By bus
A hugely convenient way to get around town is the Alhambrabus tourist
microbus that goes back and forth from the Alhambra to the Albaycín
district. The red-and-white minibuses (route nos. 30, 31, and 32), popular
with both locals and tourists, run every 10 to 15 minutes between 7 a.m.
and 11 p.m. They make multiple stops as they run along the Cuesta 
de Gomérez between the Alhambra and Plaza Nueva and along the
Carretera del Darro and up into the Albaycín district. The one-way fare 
is .95€ ($1.15).
If you’re visiting Granada for a few days, or if you’ve got friends or family
in tow, buy a 9-fare bus ticket (called the “Bono 5.20”) for just 5.20€
($6.25) or a 20-fare ticket for 10€ ($13). You can purchase tickets at
estancos (tobacco stands — look for the TABACOS sign).
Chapter 17: Granada 463
The Moors in Spain, briefly
The Moors crossed into Iberia via the Strait of Gibraltar in A.D. 711 and settled at the
base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. After Córdoba — then the Muslim capital —
fell in 1031, Granada gained influence and importance among the fragmented Muslim
kingdoms. In 1238, Mohammed ben Sasar founded the Nasrid dynasty, and his inde-
pendent kingdom stretched from Gibraltar to the eastern coast of Spain. After nearly
eight centuries of Moorish presence in Spain, King Boabdil, the last ruler of the
dynasty, turned over the keys of Granada to the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and
Isabella. His surrender in 1492 signaled the end of Muslim rule in Iberia and confirmed
the Christian Reconquest in Spain.

By taxi
To order a taxi, call Tele Radio Taxi (% 958-28-06-54) or Radio-Taxi
Granada (% 958-13-23-23). Few journeys cost more than 8€ ($9.60).
You can hail a cab in the street (the little green light on the roof means
you can hop in) or pick one up where they line up (usually outside
hotels, the Alhambra, and near the minibus stop on Plaza Nueva).
By car
Granada is congested and complicated to drive in; a car isn’t necessary
in town. However, if you want to explore more of Andalusia, renting some
wheels is a good idea. Rental-car companies include Avis, Recogidas 31
(% 958-25-23-58); Budget, Recogidas 35 (% 958-25-05-54); Europcar, Av.
del Sur 2 (% 958-29-50-65); and Hertz, Luis Braille 7 (% 958-25-24-19).
Avis, Europcar, and Hertz also have offices at the airport.
On foot
Granada is surprisingly small, but you need to save your feet for the
Alhambra and getting around the hilly Albaycín neighborhood. Walking
between Albaycín and most of the downtown sights is easy enough,
though. Unless you’re staying in a hotel that’s tucked into the woods
near the Alhambra, you need to take a bus or taxi to get there.
Staying in Style
Granada’s hotel scene used to encompass the parador — the most
sought-after reservation in Spain — and everything else. But Granada
has added several outstanding and excellent-value small hotels with real
Andalusian character to supplement the flagship of the national parador
network. Many of the boutique hotels are located in the picturesque
Albaycín district. Granada is a very popular destination, so make your
reservations early — especially in the spring and early summer. Easter
week is perennially sold out.
If you want to make sure you get a room either at the Parador Nacional
San Francisco (% 958-22-14-40; www.parador.es) or América (%/Fax
958-22-224-25) — both within the actual grounds of the Alhambra —
book at least three to four months (or more) in advance.
Christmas in Granada with the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains 
in the background may sound romantic, but you’ll feel more like the
Grinch if you arrive without realizing that the Alhambra, probably
Spain’s single greatest sight (at the very least it competes neck-and-
neck with Madrid’s Prado Museum for that honor), closes between
December 25 and January 1.

Cathedral Quarter
Not far from the Cathedral, housed in the sumptuously converted
Jerónimos Convent, this new hotel is perhaps the city’s most luxurious.
Its location, on one of Granada’s busiest thoroughfares, isn’t as desirable
as either of the top choices on Alhambra hill, but it more than makes up
for that shortcoming with easy access to restaurants, shops, and bars, and
the beauty of the Mudéjar-style convent. The hotel, a merger of minimal-
ism and historic monument, is built around the stunning, arcaded clois-
ters, and the excellent El Claustro restaurant is suitably monastic looking.
Rooms — each of which is different from the next — are luxurious and well
decorated, as is typical of this elite Spanish hotel chain. I especially like
those rooms built around the courtyard, with wood-beam ceilings.

Alhambra Palace
$$$–$$$$
Alhambra Hill
With a location nearly as privileged as the Alhambra itself, this palatial
reddish-pink hotel on the hill envisions itself as the perfect Moorish-style
companion to the real Nasrid Palaces just minutes away, and for most vis-
itors to Granada, it is. Built by the Duke of San Pedro de Galatino in 1910,
it looks like an Epcot Center version of a Moorish citadel and includes all
kinds of neo-Mudéjar touches (splashy tiles, arches, carved plaster walls,
wood ceilings, and even a pseudo-minaret). But what it has above all else
is a superb location — it’s within walking distance of the Alhambra and
has priceless views of Granada below. The 122 rooms at the Palace, pop-
ular with travelers and business visitors alike, are spacious and impres-
sive without being stuffy. Try to get a room with a small balcony
overlooking the city, and ask to see a few rooms if you can, because their
size and appeal vary quite a bit.

Albaycín
An old Arab carmen (villa with a concealed garden), later expanded in the
16th and 17th centuries, was fully renovated and transformed into one of
Granada’s loveliest hotels in the late 1990s. Carmen de Santa Inés’s nine
rooms, all different from one another, are replete with handsome antique
furnishings, Arab carpets, and wonderful decorative touches; six of the
rooms even offer views of the Alhambra (the others overlook the interior
patio). Tucked into the tiny streets of the old Arab Quarter, Albaycín, the
hotel is as charming as the neighborhood it inhabits. The hosts serve
breakfast in the beautiful garden, amid fountains and fruit trees.

Casa de los Migueletes
$$$–$$$$
Albaycín
The newest and most luxurious of the crop of interesting boutique hotels
in the Muslim quarter of Granada, this 17th-century, three-story mansion,
owned and operated by a Norwegian couple, is one of the most sophisti-
cated options in town. On a quiet street near Plaza Santa Ana, it is slightly
larger than several inns in the district. Every effort was made to respect
the original structure of the house (which was once the headquarters to
rural police, known for their armaments called “Migueletes”) but the décor
does not go in for any kitschy Arab stylings. The 25 rooms have a touch of
Scandanavian spareness, though they feature beautiful bathrooms and
quality linens, bedding, and furnishings. Superior and deluxe rooms have
views either of the courtyard and its fountain or the Alhambra. The hotel
has more of a grand museum feel than the cozy inn quality of several of
the Albaycín inns that occupy medieval cármenes, which will satisfy more
demanding guests.

This 16th-century house, on a quiet, pedestrian-only street in the heart of

neighborhood. It has a very warm, Mudéjar feel, with ochre-colored walls,
Arab-style azulejos, or tiles, teahouse-style lanterns, and even a skylight
reminiscent of a hammam (Arab bath). A plant-filled rooftop deck has
splendid views of the Alhambra hilltop. The five rooms are charming and

Palacio de Santa Inés

Albaycín
Owned by the same folks who run the terrific Carmen de Santa Inés, this
lovingly renovated small palace, recently in complete ruins, is one of
Granada’s top choices. Dating to the beginning of the 16th century, it was
known as the Casa del Padre Eterno (House of the Eternal Father). Today
it is a luxurious, five-year-old inn with modern art on the walls, silver chan-
deliers, a two-story Renaissance courtyard, and thick wood-beamed ceil-
ings. The painstaking renovation restored important frescos on the walls
of the patio, painted by a disciple of Rafael. The hotel’s six double rooms
and seven suites are charmingly decorated, full of interesting antiques.
Rooms 3, 6, 7, and 12 offer views of the Alhambra, which is illuminated at
night. This hotel is only slightly less intimate than its sister hotel, Carmen
de Santa Inés, also located in the attractively labyrinthine Albaycín dis-
trict. Check online for special off-season offers.

Parador Nacional San Francisco
$$$$$
Alhambra
If you’re the sort who plans vacations far in advance, and you’re certain of
the date you’re visiting Granada, you may have a shot at getting a reser-
vation at Spain’s most popular and famous parador. This hotel is desirable
for a good reason: An ancient Moorish palace converted into a convent in
the 15th century, the parador is lodged within the grounds of the magnifi-
cent Alhambra. The serene hilltop gardens, with the snowcapped Sierra
Nevada peaks and Albaycín district in the distance, may just be Spain’s
finest location. The look of the rooms almost doesn’t matter, but the good
news is that, although they’re not over-the-top luxurious, they are deco-
rated in good taste and full of handsome antiques. Do your best to request
a room in the old part, as the more modern wing is a bit less appealing.
Though it’s the most expensive and difficult-to-get-into of all the paradores,
it is still fairly reasonable, given its unrivaled location. If you’re dying to
stay within the Alhambra, no doubt a magical experience at night, put
down this book and send them an e-mail or fax right away — as long as it’s
a good three to four months before you’ll be arriving in Granada. And if
it’s not, you can always hope.

Dining Out
Despite its enduring popularity on the tourist circuit, Granada doesn’t
rank as one of the better places in Spain, or even in Andalusia, to eat
out. The province as a whole remains pretty unimaginative in terms of
dining opportunities, so with a few exceptions, your memories are much
more likely to be of the Alhambra than of the local meals. Most places 
in Granada are simple, no-frills restaurants. Making a meal of tapas
(Spanish hors d’oeuvres) is always a reliable choice. Two hotel restau-
rants stand out: El Claustro at AC Palacio de Santa Paula, in a dramatic
dining room carved out of a 1540 convent, and the restaurant at the
Parador de Granada, reviewed below.
Tapas grazing is an excellent way to assemble a meal of typical and varied
Andalusian tastes; try one of the following joints for an inexpensive and
informal meal: Ajo Blanco, Palacios 17 (% 958-22-81-28); Casa del Vino,
Monjas del Carmen (% 958-22-25-95); Fogón de Galicia, Navas 27 (% 958-
22-68-36); and Antigua Bodega Castañeda, Elvira 5 (% 958-22-63-62).
Typical dishes in Granada, so close to the Sierra Nevada, Spain’s highest
mountain range, are hearty. Granada’s version of the cold soup gazpa-
cho, gazpacho granadino, is usually made with jamón serrano (cured
ham); habas con jamón are small broad beans in olive oil with thin slices
of salt cured ham; and tortilla sacromonte, perhaps the most famous dish
in Granada, is a Spanish tortilla (omelet) made not with the usual pota-
toes and onions, but with calf, pig, or lamb brains. Call me fussy, but
that’s one tortilla I won’t taste.

A simple, tiny establishment — it seats about 20 diners — on a quiet plaza
near a number of bars and nightlife, Alhabaca is a bit like a country inn in
the big, bad city. It has bare white walls, simple tables with white table-
cloths, and the kitchen in full view. Dishes are simple, but well prepared.
A good starter is salmorejo, the thick, gazpacholike tomato soup from
Córdoba. The main course I had, merluza en salsa de almendras (hake or
white fish in almond sauce), was equally good. For dessert, the flan de cal-
abaza (pumpkin flan) is a Spanish version of pumpkin pie.

Cathedral Quarter
ANDALUSIAN
A lively, cheerful spot just off Plaza Nueva — splitting the distance between
the Alhambra and the Albaycín barrio — this long train car of a place,
which has been around for about a century, is half inexpensive restaurant,
half rollicking tapas bar and bodega. There are only about ten tables, so
you’ll probably have to wait — or just muscle up to the bar like everyone
else. Besides all manner of cheap tapas, sandwiches, and large salads, it
specializes in potajes — a type of thick stew in clay pots that has probably
fortified Spaniards since the time of Columbus. You can choose from six
types of potajes, including codfish and lentils with chorizo (spicy sausage).
A great place to stop before making your way up the hill to the Alhambra,
Bodega Castañeda is also just a stone’s throw from a slew of Moroccan-style
tea rooms, where you can grab a fabulous fruit shake for dessert. Night owls
will be pleased to know that this joint is open until 1:30 a.m. daily.

A classic patronized by local diners and Spanish visitors to Granada (por-
traits of the most famous line the wall of the lively tapas bar at the
entrance), Chikito is cutely named, but serious about food. A little too seri-
ous, perhaps. I recommend standing at the bar and downing some excel-
lent tapas rather than sitting in the stuffier dining room. If you do sit down,
choose from among zarzuela de pescado (seafood stew), breaded and
stuffed veal, or oven-baked hake (a white fish similar to cod).

ents, such as rollitos de lubina rellenos de langostinos y jamón ibérico (sea
bass rolls stuffed with prawns and salt-cured ham). A few items on the

A gorgeous, private Renaissance-era home, decorated with what appear to

authentic Granada carmen — an Albaycín villa with stupendous gardens
concealed behind high walls. You have to ring at an imposing black door —
be patient, it may take awhile for someone to let you inside. Wind your way
through the gardens on the way to the restaurant at back; the views of the
Alhambra on the hill are nothing short of amazing. (Legend has it that
Morayma, the wife of the last Moorish king, Boabdil, was imprisoned here,
reduced to gazing at the Alhambra from the opposite hill.) The popular
restaurant has several separate dining rooms with idiosyncratic touches
(pre-Columbian pieces, a shrine near the bathroom). The traditional menu
is diverse and servings are ample; prices are reasonable. Try the espinacas
con almendras (spinach with almonds) to start, and perhaps the solomillo de
cerdo (pork sirloin) to follow it up. On Tuesday evenings, you can enjoy a live
flamenco performance at 11 p.m.

It’s hard as heck to get a room at the parador, housed in an illustrious 15th-

Chapter 17: Granada 471

you’ve landed somewhere else, is to pop in (well, not exactly pop in —
reservations are absolutely necessary) for lunch or dinner to soak up
some of the singular Alhambra ambience. The views of the serene rose gar-
dens and the Generalife in the distance are unbeatable. At lunchtime, the
attractive garden terrace is open — a great place to dine if you’re not here
in the middle of a scorching Granada summer. The national parador restau-
rants are generally dependable, if not always exciting, but this may be the
very best of the lot. Dine on Antonio Macía Blanco’s creative Andalusian
specialties such as rape mozárabe con piñones (Moorish-style monkfish
with pine nuts) or blood sausage lasagna in a sauce of leeks.

A classic in Granada, Restaurante Sevilla, named for that other city in
Andalusia (see Chapter 15), has been around seemingly forever and is still
going strong. The city’s best-known restaurant, this two-story place is where
the literary and musical elite — including favorite son García Lorca — used
to dine back in the early 1930s. Today it’s just as popular with Spaniards and
the visitors who tramp through town. In summer, the restaurant sets tables
in the square next to the Royal Chapel. Andalusian specialties reign. The
four dining rooms are charmingly decorated with colorful Moorish-style
azulejos (tiles). Open your meal with the inevitable gazpacho or sopa sevil-
lana (a fish soup), followed perhaps by cordero a la pastoril (spicy lamb stew
with herbs).

Exploring Granada: The Alhambra and More
No matter how much time you have, make your first stop the Alhambra —
unless weather reports call for rain and you’ve got additional days in
Granada. If at all possible, go on a sunny day, when the reflecting pools are
brilliant and the views of the Albaycín district and Sierra Nevada are clear.
You need at least a half-day — a full four to five hours — to fully explore
the Alhambra. In fact, I limit the “Top Attractions” in Granada to just three
must-sees; they are crucial to getting a feel for this historic city, and they
shouldn’t require more than a day and a half to see. Any time left over is a
bonus, and you can devote it to the second tier of attractions and things
to do.
The top attractions
La Alhambra and Generalife
Alhambra Hill
Gracing a ruddy, wooded hill is southern Spain’s spectacular showpiece:
the legendary Alhambra fortress and palace complex of the Moors. Though
its origins as a fortress date to the ninth century, the present citadel and
walled fortifications of the Nasrid dynasty were begun in 1238, and the com-
plex was enlarged throughout the 13th and 14th centuries — as the Moors
solidified their hold on southern Spain — with palaces, residences,
mosques, spectacular gardens, and a royal summer estate (the Generalife,
adjacent to the Alhambra). After Christians captured Granada from the
Moors, they added a convent and Renaissance palace to the Alhambra
grounds in the 16th century. The entire complex fell into disrepair and,
eventually, abandonment over the next hundred years or so, only to be
rediscovered in 1829 by the American writer and diplomat Washington
Irving. His Tales of the Alhambra succeeded in awakening the world’s atten-
tion and prompting Spanish authorities to restore the palaces and grounds.
The Moors’ intentions in constructing the Alhambra were unflinchingly
grand: Rulers sought nothing less than to create an earthly paradise. In its

A monumental bargain
A very good deal for anyone intent on making the most of Granada’s cultural attractions
is the Bono Turístico Granada, a combined ticket — in the form of a plastic card that
you swipe at the gate of any participating monument — that gets you into the Alhambra,
Generalife, Capilla Real, Catedral, and the Cartuja and San Jerónimo monasteries, as
well as up to nine free trips on city buses and the tourist microbus and a 24-hour ticket
for the Bus Turístico (city tour). The Bono, which is good for a week and costs 23€ ($27)
or 25€ ($29) in advance, can be purchased at the Alhambra, Capilla Real, or any Caja
Granada bank office. Call % 902-10-00-95 for additional information.

quiet elegance and harmony, its bewitching beauty, and its air of
inscrutability and wonder, this sprawling compound, Muslim Spain’s great-
est achievement, came very close to that ideal.
Your Alhambra ticket (valid for one day only and designated either morn-
ing, 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., or afternoon, 2 p.m. to close) allows you only a half-
hour window of access to the Nasrid Palaces (350 people per half-hour are
allowed entrance, and you must enter at the time your ticket specifies, or
lose your opportunity to see the finest part of the Alhambra — though you
can stay as long as you want after you enter). During peak visitation 
periods — primarily summer, but also at other vacation times such as
Easter — you might not gain admission if you go late in the day. Try to go
as early as possible, even though tour groups will be lined up, or try going
during the extended lunch hour (2–4 p.m.). Even early in the morning, you
may wait a couple of hours or more to enter. You may have some luck late
in the day, after large groups have evacuated, but if the day’s quota is filled,
you’ll be denied entrance after 4 p.m.
Enter the Alhambra complex at the end of the Cuesta de Gomérez and
stroll along the gardens, where a medina (marketplace) once flourished.
The first major building is the jarringly self-important 15th-century
Renaissance Palacio de Carlos V (Palace of Carlos V, a Christian addition
to the Alhambra grounds and a stark stylistic contrast). It contains the
Museo de la Alhambra (a newly redesigned museum devoted to the art
of al-Andalus) and a small Museo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Museum). You

can either see the Carlos V palace first or save it until after you’ve seen
the palaces of the Moorish kings, which deserve the bulk of your time. If
you have time before your appointed hour, visit the Alcazaba, the fortress
that is the oldest part of the Alhambra, begun in 1238. Torre de la
Campana (Bell Tower), the highest point of the Alhambra, is where the
Catholic monarchs hung their banners after the Reconquest and installed
a bell to regulate irrigation times in the fertile valleys below.
Enter the Palacios Nazaríes (Royal Nasrid Palaces) through the Sala del
Mexuar, the main public reception hall, completed in 1365, and pass into
the Cuarto Dorado (Gilded Room) and its patio, which boasts one of the
most splendid facades in the palaces. In the Palacio de Comares, built by
Yusuf I, you’ll come upon the Patio de Arrayanes (Courtyard of Myrtles),
a beautiful patio with a long, spectacular reflecting pool. Here are some of
the palace’s most remarkable azulejos (glazed ceramic tiles). Behind it is
the Salón de Embajadores (Ambassadors’ Hall), an ornately carved
throne room built in the mid-14th century. The dome represents the seven
heavens of the Islamic cosmos. Make your way to the magnificent Palacio
de los Leones, part of the royal family’s private quarters and one of the
most famous elements of the Alhambra. Built by Mohammed V, the palace
is a festival of delicate marble columns with a gurgling fountain at its
center where water trickles from the mouths of 12 lions. Here the delicacy
of the plasterwork carving reaches new heights. At the back of the patio
is the Sala de los Abencerrajes, a noble hall with a stunningly rich hon-
eycombed ceiling where the last Moorish king, Boabdil, reputedly
beheaded rivals (a legend that purports to explain the reddish, blood-
stained color of the pillars). From here, wander around the lions’ court-
yard and back into the Apartamentos de Carlos V — quarters where
Washington Irving stayed in the 1820s. His stay in the abandoned
Alhambra was the basis for his famous book, Tales from the Alhambra,
which publicized the great palaces to the world. Exit these parts and find
the ruins of the oldest palace in the Alhambra, El Partal, with another large
reflecting pool and gardens that lead to the Generalife.
Chapter 17: Granada 475
Onward to the Alhambra
The easiest way to get to the Alhambra is to take a taxi or the red-and-white
Alhambrabus minibuses that shuttle back and forth between the Albaycín district and
the hilltop palace complex (the nearest stop is below the hill, at Plaza Nueva). If you’re
the energetic sort, however, the steep uphill walk into the luxuriant shade of the woods
surrounding the Alhambra is a magnificent way to make your way up. The walk doesn’t
take more than 20 minutes or so, though I don’t recommend it for anyone but the most
athletic (you need to save your energy to walk around the large grounds of the
Alhambra and Generalife). To walk, follow the signs from Plaza Nueva to Cuesta de
Gomérez uphill to Puerta de las Granadas, the first of two gates to the Alhambra. Keep
going past the second; the ticket office is on your left (look for all the commotion).
Along the way, watch out for thieves masquerading as tour guides.

The Generalife (heh-neh-rah-lee-feh), also within the Alhambra’s walls,
was the country estate of the Nasrid kings. High above the city on 75 lush
acres, it sings with murmuring fountains. The 13th-century complex is a
series of magically serene courtyards and gently flowing waters, a place
to lose yourself, as the swinging sultans and their harems surely did. The
Patio de la Acequía, a closed Arab garden with a long, narrow pool lined
by water jets forming delicate arches, is particularly fetching and photo-
genic. Don’t miss a lovely walk on the footpath, Escalera del Agua (Water
Staircase), along the upper gardens.

Albaycín
Granada’s old Arab district, the site of the first Moorish settlement in
Granada, is richly evocative of another time, when the city had more
mosques than churches. The Albaycín runs along the Darro River and a
picturesque street, Carrera del Darro; the whitewashed neighborhood
creeps up a steep hillside, full of quick twists and turns and ever-escalat-
ing steps, all the while keeping the Alhambra in its viewfinder. The entire
district, today as in days past largely a residential neighborhood, has been
named a UNESCO Heritage of Mankind site. Lovely discoveries are every-
where — from cármenes (Moorish villas with orchards) and quiet plazas to
uneven cobblestone paths, tall cypress trees, and aljibes (cisterns).
The greatest discovery, though, may be the heart-stopping views from the
Mirador de San Nicolás. A small plaza in front of the church looks directly
across at the Alhambra, perfectly framed against the snow-capped ridges
of the Sierra Nevada. A visit is best at sunset, when the Alhambra glows
red, or late at night, when it is exquisitely floodlit. You may find yourself
returning to this platform, a meeting place for young people and foreign
tourists in Granada, time and time again. Take Calle Zafra or Elvira to get
there, but plan on getting lost amid the charming and serpentine streets.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
476

Bring good walking shoes and energy — there’s a reason many of the
Albaycín’s streets begin with the word cuesta (slope).
Appropriately enough, this old Moorish neighborhood is again dotted with
teterías — Moroccan-style tearooms with a ton of tea varieties and a
bohemian feel — and antiques shops that reflect a medina (marketplace)
past. The intense Moorish character of the Albaycín is palpable as you

Some Alhambra sightseeing tips
An ideal visit to the Alhambra is a thoroughly peaceful experience. With the massive
interest in visiting the palace complex, though, serenity can be tough to come by.
Visitors are limited to 6,600 per day in order to protect the monument. Here are a few
ways to save time and hassles.
 Purchase your ticket, up to one year (and at least one day) in advance, by calling
% 902-224-460 (within Spain) or 34-91-537-91-78 (outside Spain); you may also
purchase tickets online at www.alhambratickets.com. Or get tickets
Monday through Friday at the BBV Bank at Plaza Isabel la Católica, at the corner
of Reyes Católicos, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., or at any branch of BBV in Spain or
abroad (London, New York, and so on). I strongly recommend advance purchase
of tickets.
 Avoid the early morning if you dislike large groups. Tour groups on whirlwind tours
of Andalusia line up to bum-rush the doors at 8 a.m. — get out of their way,
because they’ve got to be in Córdoba by noon!
 Lunchtime is generally a good time to visit — most Europeans take long lunch
breaks. (Try to get your timed entrance to the Nasrid Palaces between 2 p.m. and
4 p.m.) Better yet, come during the last hour of the afternoon session (winter 
5–6 p.m.; summer 7–8 p.m.). This time is perfect to visit, when the tour groups have
moved on and most others still hanging around are tired. Note, however, that
during the busiest times of the year, if you wait to get your ticket until late in the
afternoon, you risk not getting admitted if the daily maximum is already filled.
 Rent a digital audiophone guide for a detailed explanation of the history of the
Alhambra and some of the legends and tales associated with it. The tour is in sev-
eral languages, including English, and it allows you to go at your own pace, repeat-
ing or skipping over passages if you like. It also gives you the great advantage of
not having to read when you’d much prefer to look.
 Visit the Alhambra at night — a singular experience. Night is a great time to feel
the silence of the floodlit palace and hear the trickling fountains unmarred by
groups shouting in French, English, Japanese, German, Italian, and Portuguese.
However, you can only visit the Nasrid palaces (not including the Generalife). A
nocturnal visit is best as a supplementary visit — when you’ve already seen it by
day and found its beauty intoxicating. As your only visit, you miss too much at
night, including the beauty of the reflective pools, the bright tile work, and the
views of Albaycín and the Sierra Nevada.

climb Calle Elvira. Two streets, Caldería Nueva and Caldería Vieja, teem
with teahouses. Atmospheric teterías to seek out include La Casa del Té,

Tetería del Hammam, Santa Ana 16 (% 958-22-99-78). The best time to
go is the late afternoon and early evening, long after siesta hour.
At the bottom of the hill, along the Carretera del Darro at Calle Bañuelo, is
El Bañuelo, or Arab Baths. One of the oldest Moorish remnants in Granada
(built in the 11th century — they predate the Alhambra), the baths are in
surprisingly good condition, though they’re not as elaborate or as large as
those in Ronda (see Chapter 16). The baths (% 958-02-78-00) are open (to
take a peek only) Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Admission is free.
Down the street is the Museo Arqueológico (Archaeology Museum), in
the Casa de Castril, a stately Renaissance mansion. Its exhibits are of inter-
est if you have a great curiosity about Granada’s Muslim and Visigothic
past, but they may be deadly dull for others.

Catedral and Capilla Real
Centro/Cathedral Quarter
Granada’s ornate, powerful cathedral was the city’s 16th-century Christian
answer to the Alhambra, an emphatic statement about the conclusive
Reconquest of Spain from the Moors. Leaving little doubt about the suc-
cession of power, the Catholic monarchs ordered it placed right in the
middle of the Arab medina (marketplace). Though it started out Gothic in
style, the cathedral wound up Baroque, with five massive naves, thick pil-
lars, and a dramatic altar. In contrast to the airy, delicate, elegant
Alhambra left by the Moors, the Christian cathedral is heavy, imposing,
and grandiose.
Next door (off Calle Oficios), in the Capilla Real, or Royal Chapel, the
Gothic marble tombs of the storied Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and
Isabella lie behind the flourishes of a black-and-gold grille. When the last
Moorish king, Boabdil, surrendered to Christian forces in Granada in 1492,
the Catholic monarchs registered their greatest victory and immediately
chose Granada for their future burial place. They are interred here along
with their daughter Juana la Loca (Joanna the Mad) and her husband,
Felipe el Hermoso (Philip the Fair). The chapel museum houses Queen
Isabella’s crown and Ferdinand’s sword, as well as important paintings by
Botticelli and others. Allot about an hour at the cathedral and Royal
Chapel. On your way out, peek into the Palacio de la Madraza, once the

More cool things to see and do
Obviously, the Alhambra is the overwhelming reason to visit Granada,
but if you have a bit more time, the city affords several other terrific
options to get in touch with its complicated Moor and Christian past.
Touring a Baroque monastery
Northwest of downtown is the 16th-century Monasterio de la Cartuja,
Paseo de la Cartuja, s/n (% 958-16-19-32), which may be even more of a
Catholic rejoinder to the city’s Arab past than the cathedral is. Bathed 
in intricate stucco, inlaid marble molding, cedarwood ceilings, wildly
painted cupolas, and glittery gold leaf, the Baroque cathedral is anything
but subtle. See it after you’ve already visited the Alhambra; the contrast
between the sweet harmony and simplicity of the Nasrid palaces and
this ostentatious exercise is startling. The sacristy, with black-and-beige
tile floors, mahogany chests, and a spectacle of carved stucco, looks like
an optical illusion. To get there, take bus no. 8 or a taxi up Gran Vía de
Colón. Hours are Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
4 to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon and 4 to 8 p.m. Admission
is 3€ ($3.60), but is included in the Bono Turístico Granada (see “A
monumental bargain” box, earlier in this chapter).
Getting a glimpse of the poet’s life
Federico García Lorca (1898–1936), Spain’s greatest modern poet and
playwright, was born in Granada, and his works bind him eternally to
the city and its people. The internationally famous author of such works
as Poet in New York, The House of Bernarda Alba, and Blood Wedding,
Lorca was a daring genius whose life was cut short by the Nationalist
forces of dictator Francisco Franco. They captured the poet in Granada,
took him to a field, and shot him.
Just southwest of downtown, García Lorca’s childhood summer home,
Huerta de San Vicente, Calle de la Virgen Blanca, s/n, is preserved as a
museum. It’s located within García Lorca Park southwest of downtown, at
the end of Recogidas (% 958-25-84-66; www.huertadesanvicente.com).
Although the view is now blocked by large apartment buildings, in his
Chapter 17: Granada 479

youth, Lorca enjoyed unencumbered views of the Alhambra on the hill
from here. Adorned with Lorca’s art and personal effects — his bedroom
and desk, where he wrote Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding), are almost
monastic — it’s a fascinating window into the life of one of Spain’s great-
est and most enigmatic literary figures. The tours are anything but staid
house visits — the gentleman who leads the 30-minute walk-through is a
Lorca scholar, and he encourages visitors to read from Lorca’s works as
they wander the house. (A grasp of Spanish helps.)
To get there, you can take a 15-minute walk from Puerta Real down
Recogidas; signs indicate a right turn (northwest) to park and Huerta de
San Vicente within. Hours are July and August Tuesday through Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; October to March 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 4 to
6:30 p.m.; and April, May, June, and September 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and
5 to 7:30 p.m. Admission is 3€ ($3.60) adults; 1€ ($1.20) students, chil-
dren under 9, and seniors.
Exploring Sacromonte (while watching your pockets)
The hill called Sacromonte (Sacred Hill), northwest of the Albaycín, is
famed for its gypsy caves carved out of the earth, touristy flamenco
shows, and pickpockets who thrive on visitors to the first two. You can
also check out a dilapidated abbey, Abadía del Sacromonte (% 958-
22-14-45). It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
4 to 6 p.m. Admission is free. Plenty of people love to wander the streets
on the hill, but its residents have earned a reputation for taking advan-
tage of tourists. Therefore, I recommend it with caution, except for fear-
less travelers; you may want to visit Sacromonte as part of an organized
flamenco outing in the evening (ask at your hotel or see “Living It Up
after Dark,” later in this chapter).
Living the spa life
Maybe your imagination ran wild visiting the ancient Moorish baths or
the Alhambra, thinking about the luxurious bathhouse life the sultans
must have led. Hammam Baños Arabes, Santa Ana 16 (% 958-22-99-78;
www.hammamspain.com/granada), a Granada spa, does its best to evoke
Moorish times with its Arab (Turkish-style) baths. In fact, it has the foun-
tains, colorful, glazed ceramic tiles, and Moorish arches down pat. Clearly,
this is not the sauna at your local YMCA. The spa also offers therapeutic
massages and a tearoom upstairs. Reservations are required; baths are
16€ ($19) and bathing suits are required.
Shopping the Local Stores
Unsurprisingly, in this town where a Moorish accent remains so perva-
sive, the best crafts are those inherited from the Arabs, who were superb
craftsmen. Look for fajalauza (glazed ceramics), wrought-iron objects,
leather goods, furniture with inlaid woods, and musical instruments —
especially guitars.
Part V: Southern Spain: Andalusia 
480

Check out two areas first. The Alcaicería, right next to the cathedral and
Royal Chapel (off Calle Oficios), is the old Arab silk market. Today, it
almost entirely showcases goods hawked at tourists, but you can still
pick up some interesting Andalusian souvenirs. The Corral del Carbón,
Mariana Pineda 12 (% 958-22-90-63), an old commercial exchange, is
one of the oldest Moorish structures in Granada. Currently it houses a
number of artisans’ shops. The hours are Monday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You can
find similar shops, including most of Granada’s antiques stores, in the
Albaycín district and particularly along Cuesta de Elvira. Another good
street where you can look for crafts, including guitars, is Cuesta de
Gomérez, leading to Alhambra hill.
For ceramics, check out Cerámica Fajalauza, Camino de San Antonio,
s/n; or Céramica Aliatar, Plaza de Aliatar 18 (% 958-27-80-89). Artesanía
Albaicín, Calle del Agua 19 (% 958-27-90-56), is one of Albaycín’s most
dependable places for tooled leather goods. It stocks the obligatory
purses and wallets, as well as just about everything else you also find in 
a Moroccan medina (marketplace). Casa Ferrer, Cuesta de Gomérez 26
(% 958-22-18-32), is the place for budding flamenco artists to go for
authentic, handcrafted Spanish guitars; this family-owned shop has been
around for more than a century. If you have the bucks, you can get a fine
handmade instrument here (you can also get something more along the
lines of a souvenir, for about 250€/$300).
Cava de Puros Eduardo Ruiz, Carretera de la Sierra, near Paseo de la
Bomba (% 958-22-13-85), is a smoker’s emporium with more than
20,000 Cuban cigars. Granada and its environs have plenty of good puff-
ing places, but remember that you can’t bring Cuban cigars back with
you into the United States.
Living It Up after Dark
In addition to what I list in this section, Granada usually has a respectable
schedule of concert, dance, and theater performances; ask at the tourism
office for the current brochure of cultural activities. You can also check
out other shows, including pop-flamenco artists and international dance
troupes, at the Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos, by the river. For
tickets and information, call % 902-40-02-22.
Flamenco
The Sacromonte barrio is famous, or, more accurately, notorious, for its
flamenco cuevas — atmospheric, if touristy, live music caves literally
carved right out of the hill. Their popularity doesn’t alter the fact that
they’re tourist traps and often nothing more than a well-oiled gypsy con
game. You won’t see a local anywhere near these places. Their sole pur-
pose is to relieve affluent tourists of their entertainment dollars — by
Chapter 17: Granada 481

means both straightforward and shadowy. Don’t take cameras or valu-
ables or too much cash, and don’t accept or buy any souvenirs or any-
thing beyond what is prepaid on your evening package. Even with those
caveats, you can have some fun at the zambra shows if you’ve got a
sense of humor and your wits about you.
The shows are pretty interchangeable; most offer package deals that
include transportation back and forth to your hotel, one drink, and
admission (around 22€–25€/$24–$30; about double that if you include
dinner). Granada hotels are well stuffed with Sacromonte fliers, but one
to look for is Zambra de María la Canastera, Camino del Sacromonte 81
(% 958-12-11-83). This one has a small on-site museum; the hours are
Monday through Friday from 4 to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from
noon to 3 p.m. Also look for Cueva la Rocío, Camino del Sacromonte 70
(% 958-22-71-29); Cueva la Zingara, Camino del Sacromonte 71 (% 958-
22-22-71); Venta El Gallo, Barranco de los Negros 5 (% 958-22-24-92);
and Cueva los Tarantos, Camino del Sacromonte 9 (% 958-22-45-25).
Casa Juanillo at Camino del Sacromonte 83 (% 958-22-30-94), offers
somewhat less touristy, fairly pure flamenco music and decent tapas.
Not in Sacromonte, but downtown, with a restaurant-show and late-night
sevillanas (informal gatherings of Andalusian dancing and singing), is 
El Corral del Príncipe, Campo del Príncipe 7 (% 958-22-80-88; closed
Mon). The nightly 10 p.m. shows at Jardines Neptuno, Arabial, s/n 
(% 958-52-25-33), are probably Granada’s best, though they still pale in
comparison to what you may see in Madrid, Seville, or Córdoba. Because
you’ll most likely arrive and leave late, and downtown offers little late-
night transportation, I recommend having a taxi take you directly to
either of these clubs. If taxis aren’t waiting when you emerge, have the
clubs call one for you.
Bars and pubs
The Albaycín neighborhood is a lively quarter at night. Check out the pic-
turesque street along the river, Carretera del Darro, where new watering

International song and dance
Granada’s big annual music and dance party takes place at unusual theaters, which
include some of the city’s most wondrous, historic places — the Alhambra, Generalife,
Cathedral, Royal Hospital, and San Jerónimo Monastery. The Festival Internacional de
Música y Danza de Granada (Granada International Festival of Music and Dance)

holes continually pop up, complementing interesting old ones. Bodegas
Castañeda, Cuesta de Elvira 5 (% 958-22-22-76), a hip bar inhabiting old
wine cellars, is a great and lively place for tapas and drinks. The bar-
restaurant El Tragaluz, Nevot 26 (% 919-04-70-84), is a good, relaxed
place for talking and occasional theater presentations. Folks with rowdier
impulses can pump it up at Granada-10, Cárcel Baja 10 (% 958-22-40-01),
a cool old restored theater and the city’s best discoteca, with films and a
wide-ranging crowd. It’s open until the early-morning hours.
A Side Trip from Granada
From exploring caves to skiing the slopes, if you’re hankering to get out
of the city, the side trips outlined in this section may be just the ticket.
The Tourism Board of Granada wants you to get out of town. This group
is so intent on visitors seeing more of the province than the Alhambra
and Albaycín that they’ll load you on a bus for free. A tourist bus with 
an accompanying professional guide carts small groups of visitors (an
average of 20) off to destinations outside of the city, such as Guadix,
Alpujarras (the southern face of the Sierra Nevada), and the Tropical
Coast. The trips take off in the morning and return to Granada the same
day. There’s no catch; the only requirement is that you have at least a
two-night hotel reservation in Granada (the town). Simply call Agencia
Granavisión at % 958-13-58-04 and reserve your place.
Guadix: Checking out the cave dwellers
One of Spain’s oldest settlements, Guadix (gwah-deeks) is a place where
people still live in caves. The town is perched on a 1,000-foot plateau,
and the troglodyte dwellings, called Barrio Santiago, are carved right
into the rock — about all you see from the street are a whitewashed
front door, a chimney protruding from the ground/ceiling, and a jarring
TV antenna. (Cave dwellers want their MTV, too; it looks like every cave
is tuned in.) There is an entire neighborhood of casa cuevas (cave
houses); these oddities (about 2,000 of them) have existed here for half
a millennium. On my last visit, I asked an elderly gentleman to show me
around his place. He explained that living in a cave was perfect; it was
cool in the scorching summer and warm in the mountain winter. If you’re
shy about asking someone for a peek, visit the Cueva Museo (Cave
Museum) on Plaza de la Ermita Nueva, opposite the San Miguel church;
it does its best to depict how underground people live. It’s open Monday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 7 p.m., and Sunday from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Admission is 1.50€ ($1.80).
In town you can also check out a 16th-century cathedral by the same
architect who worked on Granada’s cathedral. You can visit the Moorish
Alcazaba, the 11th-century fortress, which is open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. Admission is 1.20€ ($1.50).

Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. Admission is 1.50€ ($1.80). If you’re looking to spend the
night or to have a decent meal, check out the rather elegant, turn-of-the-
20th-century Hotel Comercio, Mira de Amezcua 3 (% 958-66-05-00),
which has doubles for 51€ ($61) and a surprisingly good restaurant. For
a more unique experience, stay in one of the actual cave dwellings that
put Guadix on the map. Some have been converted into aparthotels at
Cuevas Pedro Antonio de Alarcón, Barriada San Torcuato, s/n (% 958-
66-49-86; fax 958-66-17-21; www.andalucia.com/cavehotel/home.htm).
Despite the prehistoric look of the caves, which are near the train sta-
tion and about 1.6km (1 mile) from the cave core of Guadix, the apart-
ments are modernized (if simple) and inexpensive: 57€ to 69€ ($68–$83)
for two people. There’s even a large pool for the complex.
By car, Guadix is 58km (36 miles) northeast of Granada on N-342. At least
six Autedia (% 958-15-36-36) buses per day make the one-hour trip to
Guadix. The train from Granada takes about an hour (5.25€/$6.30).
Fast Facts: Granada

Reyes Católicos 55 (% 95-821-05-28), open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
midnight and Sundays and holidays from
noon to midnight. Most places in Granada
charge about 2€ ($2.40) an hour. Check
with the tourism office before you go,
because these places across Spain have a
habit of opening and closing at a moment’s
notice.
Police
For municipal police, dial % 092. For
national police, % 091. The local police
office is at Plaza Carmen 5 (% 958-20-94-61).
Post Office
The Central Post Office is located at Puerta
Real, s/n (% 958-22-48-35). It’s open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Safety
Exercise extreme caution, especially at
night, in the Sacromonte district, where the
majority of tourist-oriented flamenco clubs
are located.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
I
hedge my bets. When people ask me to declare my
absolute favorite sight, hotel, restaurant, or cultural expe-
rience in Spain — which friends, family, and strangers invari-
ably do — I tend to stammer and stumble. Spain just has so
much to offer. So although I started Spain For Dummies, 4th
Edition, with a personal selection of the best experiences you
could reasonably hope to have on a trip to Spain, along with
other “best” choices, there really wasn’t room to include
everything. So I’m taking advantage of these last few pages to
throw in a few more. The second list in this part is a collec-
tion of curious odds and ends about Spain that are meant to
whet your appetite a little more and prompt you to discover
for yourself what makes Spain such an intriguing place.

Chapter 18
Top Ten (Other) Can’t-Miss
Spanish Experiences
In This Chapter
 Dining and drinking in Spain
 Enjoying Spain’s festivals and flamenco
 Examining the artistry and history of Spain
I
n Chapter 1, I give my choices for the very best, or quintessential,
Spanish experiences. But in a country as diverse and with as much to
offer as Spain, ticking off a top-ten list is much too difficult, so I’m cheat-
ing and adding another. These experiences aren’t necessarily runners-
up; indeed, they’re worth seeking out in their own right.
Popping Corks
Oenophiles and casual imbibers alike find that Spanish wines are richly
rewarding, not to mention surprisingly affordable. You can enjoy a
bounty of red, white, and sparkling wines, as well as unique aperitifs at
restaurants across Spain. But for an even greater pleasure, experience
local wines in an authentic tavern or tapas joint, where knocking back
little glasses of vino is a boisterous, popular affair — far from the stuffy
atmosphere of wine snobs and rarified cellars. Look for fine vintages
from the Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Priorato, Penedès, and Toro wine
regions, and sparkling wines from Catalonia called cava. Don’t forget to
sample popular white Albariños from Galicia, and txakoli (cha-koh-li), a
fruity and fizzy white wine drunk in the Basque Country. Have a fino or
manzanilla (dry sherries) in Andalusia. Or blow off all those unfamiliar
names and ask for the basic vino (tinto or blanco) de la casa — the inex-
pensive house wine many Spaniards drink. For more details about spe-
cific wines and vintages, see the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this
book and Chapter 2.

Braving a Bullfight
El toro, or bull, is a creature of mythic proportions in Spain and a pillar
of Spanish popular culture. The bull is central to rituals Spaniards hold
dear, such as Pamplona’s annual encierro, or running of the bulls, and 
la corrida, the bullfight, which has followers every bit as faithful and 
passionate as soccer does. The life-and-death drama of a bullfight —
something aficionados elevate to art and theater rather than mere 
sport — is a quintessential Spanish experience. But it’s not for everyone,
or even for most people. It’s bloody and it’s cruel; death in the afternoon
is what you’ll go to see, and applaud, when the matador almost inevitably
slays the beast. Whether or not you’re swayed by such demonstrations
of machismo, you’re unlikely to forget your first experience of either one.
Madrid’s Plaza de Toros de las Ventas, Seville, and Ronda are the top
three spots to see a corrida, with Ronda — home to Spain’s oldest bull-
fighting ring — being especially evocative. See Chapters 13, 15, and 16.
Feasting on Flamenco
Flamenco dancing is a stunning display of grace and rhythmic fire, and
the wail of flamenco cante hondo (deep-throated vocals) is a soulful, vis-
ceral, people’s song unlike any other. You can see a slick and colorful
costumed production in any major city in Spain, but the best place 
to experience authentic flamenco is in a small, dark club in Madrid
(Chapter 13), Seville, or Córdoba (Chapter 15 for both), where you’ll 
be among locals as well as tourists and where you can get close enough
to see the sweat fly off dancers’ arms and feel the hand-clapping and
staccato dance steps like a bass drum in your chest.
Making a Gastronomic Pilgrimage to
Catalonia or the Basque Country
Spaniards of all stripes love to wine and dine, but nowhere is it such a
refined and adventurous art form as it is in northern Spain. The Basque
Country has traditionally been the leader of the country’s fine dining,
but Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia are also now part of Europe’s
culinary cutting edge. Nothing compares to the culinary artistry of a 
full-course menú de degustación (tasting menu) — a full-throttle dining
experience — or a packed bar heaving with pintxos (tapas) in the
Basque Country. The Basques have developed a level of creativity
unmatched in Spain, and their land of Michelin-starred restaurants has
represented one of Europe’s leading culinary frontiers for more than a
decade. Dine in reverence at a celebrated chef’s tasting menu in San
Sebastián, a city of pilgrimage for gourmands the world over; or behold
the magnificence of a Basque pintxos crawl in Bilbao. In Barcelona, chic,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
490

wildly creative restaurants have sprouted like Catalonia’s beloved mush-
rooms in the Gothic Quarter and in the new port, taking their cues from
the celebrated kitchen wizard Ferran Adrià at El Bulli, in Roses on the
northern Costa Brava, and from the amazing Roca brothers in Girona.
See Chapters 10, 11 and 12.
Succumbing to Moderniste Mayhem
As the 19th century gave way to the 20th century in Barcelona, a cre-
ative coterie of architects produced their own take on Art Nouveau, and
they produced an incredible number of visionary works of modernisme.
Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and
others changed the face of their native Catalan capital. Getting up close
and personal with buildings that still startle today (and make you
wonder how they ever got built . . . or almost built), including La Sagrada
Familia, La Pedrera, El Palau de la Música Catalana, and the fantastically
molded corners of the Manzana de la Discórdia, is a true architectural
event. And it appeals to kids and people on whom architecture has
never made a big impression before. See Chapter 10.
Disappearing into the Dalí Triangle
Spain’s surrealist madman, Salvador Dalí, was one of the art world’s
biggest superstars of the 20th century. Dalí hailed from rural Catalonia
and lived larger than life along the easygoing Costa Brava. A relaxed 
road trip takes you to the ingeniously oddball museum-cum-theater he
designed as his legacy in Figueres, to his idiosyncratic home in Cadaqués,
and the bizarro castle he built in true Dalí style for his equally wild
Russian wife — and allows you to piece together the home life of a truly
revolutionary artist. See Chapter 11.
Partying till You Drop with Madrileños
Spaniards are true creatures of the night, and for plenty of them, a night
isn’t a true success unless it bleeds into the next day. Perhaps nowhere
is the nightlife more exuberant than in Madrid. The capital — where
Almodóvar and La Movida got their start — swings like no other city in
Spain (or in Europe, for that matter). Its clubs are louder and open later.
Whether you’re into discos, flamenco clubs, or tapas crawls, you’ll find
no shortage of people willing to plunge recklessly into the night. As a
bonus, when you stumble out of a club with the sun coming up, you 
can head straight for some chocolate and churros, deep-fried munchies
that help soak up the alcohol and ward off the hangover. Madrid isn’t 
the only place to go for rollicking nightlife, though. Its perennial rival,
Barcelona, runs a very close second, with the waterfront area and
Chapter 18: Top Ten (Other) Can’t-Miss Spanish Experiences 491

atmospheric Gothic Quarter crammed with pulsating bars, pubs, and
dance clubs. The stately university town of Salamanca, overrun with
Spanish and international students, also really lets its hair down after
dark, and its throbbing nightlife is strictly for those who can keep pace.
See Chapters 10, 13, and 14.
Appreciating Alternative 
Views of the Alhambra
Granada’s stunning Moorish palace is perhaps the highlight of Spain,
and few people dare to miss it on a trip to Andalusia. Although a stan-
dard daytime tour with the crowds is memorable, perhaps even more
breathtaking is seeing it from another angle. Climb the narrow streets 
of the old Arab district, Albaycín, and find the Mirador de San Nicolás,
which offers a perfect perch from which to view the Alhambra, stun-
ningly framed against the snow-capped ridges of the Sierra Nevada
mountains. As the sun goes down, the Alhambra appears lighted from
within, glowing an earthy red. Another spectacular way to experience
the Alhambra is to visit it at night, when the absence of massive, noisy
crowds allows you the privilege of experiencing the palace’s softly trick-
ling fountains and silent majesty. See Chapter 17.
Sleeping with History in Spain’s Paradores
Ever dreamed of sleeping in a medieval monastery? In Spain, that fan-
tasy can become reality. Many of the country’s government-owned
parador chain of hotels are historic properties housed in ancient castles,
convents, and palaces. With thick stone walls and period antiques, you’ll
get a real taste of Spain’s storied history. And although many paradores
qualify as luxury digs, they’re comparatively reasonably priced; most
are around 130€ ($156) a night, and they offer great deals for seniors
and families. The best paradores covered in this book are the Parador
Príncipe de Viana in Olite, near Pamplona (see Chapter 12); Parador de
Toledo (see Chapter 14); Parador de Carmona in Carmona, near Seville
(see Chapter 15); Parador Casa del Corregidor in Arcos de la Frontera
(see Chapter 16); Parador de Ronda (see Chapter 16); and Parador
Nacional San Francisco, the most sought-after of all the paradores, given
its incredible location within the grounds of the legendary Alhambra
(see Chapter 17). You can even do a parador-to-parador tour of a region.
For more information, see www.parador.es.
Going Nuts at a Fútbol Game
Soccer — fútbol in Spain — is a near religion. Towns come to complete
standstills and nondescript bars are standing-room-only with eager fans
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
492

watching el partido when an important game is on. Seeing a game in
person is a classic Spanish experience, but it’s fun and pretty relaxed,
with plenty of women and children in attendance and, fortunately, very
few rowdy hooligan types. Spain’s most ballyhooed teams, with the most
devoted fans, are F.C. Barça and Real Madrid. Other top teams to check
out are Athletic Bilbao, Sevilla, Espanyol, Deportivo La Coruña, and
Atlético de Madrid. The season runs from September to June. See

aybe it’s just a personal quirk, but I often find the odd detail and
insider vignette more enlightening, or more telling, than the big
picture. If you’re looking for more than the standard slide show to
enlighten your friends after — or before — your trip to Spain, give these
little-known nuggets a whirl.
Olive Oil ¡Olé!
Spain is the world’s largest producer of olive oil — a fact that’s unlikely
to surprise you after you’ve spent time driving around Andalusia, a land
of unending olive groves (see Chapter 16). Andalusia and Catalonia pro-
duce so much aceite de oliva (olive oil) that the Andalusians sell it to
other countries, such as Italy, who in turn bottle it and slyly market it as
their own.
More than a Life’s Work
Antoni Gaudí, the famed and eccentric Catalan architect who popular-
ized the wildly imaginative, fanciful building style of modernisme, dedi-
cated 43 years of his life to building La Sagrada Familia — the legendary,
unfinished oddity of a cathedral in Barcelona. During the last ten years
of his life, he was consumed by the project’s construction and lived her-
mitlike in a tiny room on the premises until his death, in 1926. (He was
run over by a local tram, leaving no blueprints for future architects to

use to complete the temple.) At the time, La Sagrada Familia was only
about 15 percent completed. After more than 50 years of work, it remains
less than half finished. See Chapter 10 for more on Gaudí and the Sagrada
Familia.
Calling All Expats in Tight Shorts
The unassuming 2,000-year-old city of Girona is the site of one of Spain’s
oldest Jewish quarters (El Call), but viewers of the Tour de France, the
famously grueling three-week annual bicycle road race, discovered that
the Catalan city has another claim to fame: For most of the year, it’s
home to some pro cyclists, as it was to seven-time champ Lance
Armstrong before his retirement. Most of these Lycra-clad folks are
Americans who either cycle for Armstrong’s former team or for one of
the other pro teams that compete in the Tour de France and other
European races. Among them were two disgraced American cycling
stars: Floyd Landis, who won the 2006 Tour de France but then tested
positive for performance-enhancing drugs, and the Olympic gold medal-
ist, Tyler Hamilton, who also tested positive and was banned from the
sport. You can often see the riders in their team gear training on the
roads around Girona and the Empordá and the foothills of the Pyrenees
(followed by team cars and, presumably, their personal doctors). See
Chapter 11 for more on Girona and the Empordá countryside.
That’s $@#*^!%$ to You, Buster
Euskera, the language spoken by the Basque people of northern Spain,
has puzzled anthropologists and linguists for hundreds of years. No one
can positively identify its origins. Yet the language is remarkable for
another reason: It has no swear words. Even those completely fluent in
Euskera have to dip into Spanish when they want to curse their heads off.
The Basques themselves have an equally mysterious history. They’re one
of the oldest ethnic groups in Europe, with a language unrelated to any
existing Indo-European tongue, and some theorists believe them to be
indigenous Iberians descended from Cro-Magnon man. Others have pro-
posed — not entirely implausibly — that the Basques are the living link to
the lost city of Atlantis. See Chapter 12 for more on the Basque region.
Salvador Dalí . . . Bureaucrat?
The surrealist painter-cum-madman Salvador Dalí so loved La Pedrera,
Antoni Gaudí’s wild apartment house, that he envisioned himself holding
public office there. But not just any public office. In his inimitable style,
Dalí actually petitioned the Catalan government to create a new
“Department of Public Imagination” in the building and to appoint him to
oversee it. The government, not surprisingly, rebuffed his proposal. See
Chapter 10 for more on La Pedrera, and Chapter 11 for more on Dalí.
Chapter 19: Top Ten (or So) Things You Didn’t Know about Spain 495

Guernica, but Not Forgotten
Pablo Picasso painted his searing black-and-white portrait of war,
Guernica, in protest of the 1937 Nationalist bombing (carried out by Nazi
warplanes) of the small Basque town of that name, during the Spanish
Civil War. Picasso refused to allow the painting to be exhibited in Spain
until Nationalist dictator Francisco Franco died. Guernica remained at
New York’s Museum of Modern Art, finally making its permanent home
in Spain in 1980, after the deaths of both artist and dictator (1973 and
1975, respectively) and the return of democracy to Spain (in 1978).
Picasso’s masterwork first occupied an annex to the Prado Museum in
Madrid; it now has its own gallery in Madrid’s Centro de Arte Reina Sofía
(see Chapter 13).
Here Lies Columbus — or Does He?
Christopher Columbus’s massive coffin sits inside the Seville cathedral,
but no one knows whether the great explorer is actually buried there.
Disgraced and by no means a hero when he died, his itinerant remains
made journeys to Santo Domingo and Havana, before supposedly set-
tling here. See Chapter 15 for more on Seville.
How’s That for Heritage?
Spain has more cities designated as UNESCO (United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Sites than any other
country. The eight cities are Segovia, Salamanca, Toledo, Avila (see
Chapter 14 for these four), Córdoba (see Chapter 15), Santiago de
Compostela, Cáceres, and Cuenca (these last three were left out of this
edition for space considerations). In addition to this roster of cities
(whose entire old quarters were placed on the list), other World Heritage
Sites covered in this book include Granada’s Alhambra and Albayzín dis-
tricts (see Chapter 17); El Escorial in Aranjuez (see Chapter 13); Gaudí’s
Casa Milá, Parc Guëll, and Palau Guëll, as well as the Palau de la Música
and Hospital de Sant Pau, in Barcelona (see Chapter 10); and the cathedral
and Reales Alcázares in Seville (see Chapter 15).
That Sounds Fishy to Me
Spain is the world’s second largest per-capita consumer of seafood
(behind Japan). However, even though Spanish waters produce thou-
sands of tons of seafood each year, it’s not nearly enough to feed the
Spanish appetite for fish. So Spain, largely through importers in San
Sebastián, buys from Norway, France, South Africa, and even South
America.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
496

The Original River Walk
Barcelona’s famed boulevard, La Rambla, wasn’t always a pedestrian-
only street — in fact, it wasn’t even a street. About 2,000 years ago,
when Barcelona was a Roman settlement, the Rambla (the name means
riverbed in Arabic) was a mountain stream. In the late 18th century, the
stream was gradually filled in; elegant palaces and the city grew up
around it.
A Wine Force to Be Reckoned With
The Spanish wine industry has made a lot of noise in the last decade
with boutique wineries in Priorat, La Rioja, Ribera del Duero, and fast-
rising regions such as Bierzo gaining international recognition. Though
Spain still ranks behind France and Italy in terms of wine production and
consumption, it has more acreage under vine than any country on earth.
Miss Popularity
Spain isn’t hurting for visitors. According to the World Tourism
Organization, it ranks second (behind France) in the number of annual
visitors — not just in Europe, but worldwide. Spain ranks ahead of and
considerably outdraws other perennial frontrunners such as the United
States, Italy, and Great Britain on that list. Although Spain’s population
has hovered around 40 million for decades, it receives more than 50 mil-
lion visitors annually.

Customs
Officially, you’re permitted to bring in items
for personal use, including a video camera
or two still cameras with ten rolls of film
for each, as well as a portable radio, CD
player, and laptop computer. Sports equip-
ment for personal use (including skis, one
bicycle, tennis racquets, and golf clubs) is
also allowed. As for booze and tobacco,
the maximum allowance per person is 200
cigarettes or 50 cigars or 250 grams of
tobacco plus one bottle of wine and one
bottle of any other liquor. Don’t try to argue
that you’re bringing in firearms, narcotics,
meat, or produce for “personal use” —
your excuse won’t fly.
Tourists can bring up to 6,010€ ($7,212;
including the equivalent in any other form
of currency) without declaring the amount
in customs. You’re required to declare any
amount exceeding that total upon arrival or
upon leaving Spain.

Drugstores
To find an open farmacia (pharmacy) out-
side of normal business hours, check the
list of stores posted on the door of any
drugstore. The law requires drugstores to
operate on a rotating system of hours so
that there’s always a drugstore open
somewhere, even Sunday at midnight. 
Electricity
220 volts AC (50 volts) is common through-
out Spain, although some older places may
have 110 or 125 volts. Plugs with two round
prongs are used in electrical outlets. Carry
your adapter with you, and always ask
about the voltage at your hotel desk before
plugging in any electrical appliance.
Traveling with battery-operated equipment
is best.
Embassies/Consulates
If you lose your passport, fall seriously ill,
get into legal trouble, or have some other
serious problem, your embassy or con-

water or trust the meat, you should still be
prepared by traveling with any prescription
medications you need, and above all,
drinking plenty of bottled water. Be

Information
Tourism information offices (información
turística, or turismo) in every city are iden-
tified by a yellow box with a cursive, lower-
case “i.” See “Where to Find More
Information,” later in this appendix, for
tourist offices abroad; consult individual
destination chapters for local information
offices. The number to dial for directory
information is % 1003, a service that gives
callers information on all national and
international codes.
Internet Cafes
In most major Spanish cities you can now
find cafés internet (or cybercafes) — cof-
feehouses — or cabinas internet, simple
storefronts selling Internet access by the
hour. Internet cafes and cabinas in Spain
generally charge 2€ to 3€ ($2.40–$3.60)
per hour.
Because new Internet spots are continu-
ally popping up and disappearing, your
best bet for finding one — other than
checking the “Fast Facts” sections in each
destination chapter of this book — is to
ask at the tourism office in each city. Or, if
you want to check online before you go, do
so at www.cybercaptive.com and
www.netcafes.com.
Language
The official national language in Spain is
Spanish, the third most widely spoken lan-
guage in the world after Chinese and
English. Spanish is spoken in every
province of Spain, but local languages,
which reasserted themselves with the
restoration of democracy in 1975, are the
official regional languages in certain
autonomous regions. You’ll encounter
Catalá (Catalan) in Barcelona, Girona, and
the rest of Catalonia, and, to a lesser
extent, Euskera (Basque) in the Basque
Country.
Even if your Spanish is nonexistent, getting
by in Spain usually isn’t too difficult. People
are helpful, and mastering a few key
phrases is a snap. The staffs in most hotels
and many restaurants and shops speak
English. A pocket-sized phrase book is
Spanish Phrases for Dummies by Susana
Wald (Wiley); it has an extensive glossary
of both English and Spanish. Also, don’t
forget Spanish For Dummies by Susana
Wald (Wiley).
Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age is 18, though it’s not
uncommon to find obviously underage
drinkers at bars and restaurants. Bars, 
taverns, and cafeterias usually open at 
8 a.m., and many serve alcohol until
around 1:30 a.m. or considerably later.
Generally, you can purchase alcoholic
beverages in almost any supermarket.
Mail
Spanish post offices are called correos
(koh-ray-os). In every city you’ll find a cen-
tral post office as well as several branch
offices, all identified by yellow-and-white
signs with a crown and the words CORREOS
Y TELEGRAFOS. Main offices are generally
open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through
Friday; Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
satellite offices generally have shorter
hours (usually Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–2 p.m.; Sat 
9 a.m.–1 p.m.). You can purchase stamps at
the post office or at estancos (eh-stahn-
kohs, or tobacconist stands — look for the
brown-and-yellow sign that reads TABACOS).
Rates are divided into four areas of the
world, just like telephone calls: the E.U.,
the rest of Europe, the United States and
Canada, and the rest of the world. Airmail
letters to the United States and Canada
Spain For Dummies, 4th Edition 
500

cost .75€ ($.90) up to 20 grams, and letters
to Britain or other E.U. countries cost .50€
($.60) up to 20 grams. Postcards have the
same rates as letters. Rates change fre-
quently, so check at the local post office
before mailing anything.
Postal service in Spain has greatly
improved. Allow about one week for deliv-
ery to North America, generally less to the
United Kingdom; in some cases, though,
letters take two weeks to reach North
America. To speed things up, send a letter
urgente (oor-hen-teh, express) or certifi-
cado (registered).
Maps
For the most part, you’ll be fine with the
maps in this book and those distributed by
the local tourism information offices. If
you’re driving around Spain, make sure
you have a good road map; you can find
them at most bookstores and larger news-
paper kiosks. To best negotiate the high-
ways and byways of Spain (and for that
matter, Portugal), purchase Michelin map
no. 990 (for a folding version). Michelin
also sells more detailed maps of Spain
(nos. 441–446). Most large bookstore
chains in the United States (such as
Barnes & Noble) stock Michelin maps. 
Or call Michelin’s toll-free order number
(% 800-423-0485) to order.
Newspapers and Magazines
Most European newspapers are sold 
on the day of publication and principal
European and American magazines are
widely available. For Spanish-speakers or
those willing to give it a try, the weekly
entertainment information magazine Guía
del Ocio (Leisure Guide) lists bars, restau-
rants, cinema, theater, and concerts.
Restrooms
In Spain, the restroom is called either a
lavabo, aseo, or servicio (often labeled
WC, for water closet). The men’s room is
usually labeled caballeros (or just C), and
the women’s restroom is labeled señoras
or damas (or just D). The best places for
clean, safe public toilets are restaurants
and well-lit bars (as a courtesy, order a
coffee after using the facilities).
Safety
Violent-crime rates are much lower in
Spain than in the United States; although
robberies occur, very few of them are by
armed attackers. Though terrorism from
ETA and to a lesser degree from Islamist
groups has received a lot of press, inci-
dents are rare, and, with the exception of
the Madrid train bombings in 2004, almost
never directed at civilians. The biggest
concern for most travelers is pickpockets
and thieves breaking into rental cars. If
you’re careful and take reasonable pre-
cautions, you should be able to stay safe
and enjoy yourself. Secure valuables in a
hidden money bag or belt, and do not leave
possessions in open sight in vehicles.
Be especially careful of pickpockets any-
where that’s crowded (buses, subways,
train stations, street markets). Don’t tempt
thieves. Leave all your jewelry at home,
and don’t flash your wallet or valuables.
When you aren’t using it, keep your
camera stowed away in a backpack or
other nondescript bag.
In Spain, being physically threatened is
rare. If you’re accosted, to avoid getting
fleeced, just keep moving — and yell a
forceful “No!” or “Socorro” (soh-koh-roh,
Help!).
Smoking
Although Spain has earned a reputation as a
place where seemingly everyone smokes (in
fact, only about one-third of the population
does), a new law banning smoking in public
places, including on public transportation
Appendix: Quick Concierge 501

and in offices, hospitals, and some bars and
restaurants, was enacted in early 2006 (simi-
lar laws are in effect in Ireland, Italy, and
several other European nations). In practice,
many Spaniards choose to disregard the
law, but smoking is not as prevalent as it
was. For now, nonsmoking sections in
restaurants are still relatively rare, but
expect this to change as Spaniards adapt to
the new reality. If you feel strongly about
avoiding secondhand smoke, ask establish-
ments if they have a no fumadores (non-
smoking) section.
Taxes
A 7 percent value-added sales tax (known
in Spain as IVA) is levied on all hotel and
restaurant products and services. Visitors
are entitled to a reimbursement of the 
16 percent IVA tax they pay on most pur-
chases (on a minimum purchase of 90€, or
$108). For more information on getting your
refund, see Chapter 4.
Telephone
Spain is six hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time. The same dialing instruc-
tions apply to sending a fax overseas. From
the United States, dial the international
access code, 011; Spain’s country code,
34; the city code, 93 in Barcelona, 91 in
Madrid, and so on; and the local number.
The Spanish telecommunications com-
pany, Telefónica, is much better today than
it was as a state monopoly. Making local,
long-distance, and international calls is
easy, but tariffs for the last of these remain
high — about twice as much from Spain to
the United States as the reverse.
To phone home, use these country codes
(after dialing the international access code
from Spain, 00):
United States and Canada: 1; United
Kingdom: 44; Ireland: 353; Australia: 61;
New Zealand: 64; South Africa: 27.
The easiest and most convenient way to
place calls is to use phone cards (tarjetas
telefónicas, tar-hay-tahs tel-eh-phone-ee-
kahs), available in 10€ and 20€ ($12 and
$24) denominations. They function like
debit cards, and many require you to
scratch off a code number and then call a
toll-free number before dialing the desired
number. Some pay phones accept coins
only, but they are fast disappearing
(indeed, in large cities you’ll be hard
pressed to find one). Most accept both
phone cards and coins. Phone cards are
available at any estanco (eh-stahn-koh), or
tobacconist shop.
Whether you use coins or a phone card,
making calls from Spanish pay phones is
simple and convenient. You can use cabi-
nas (kah-bee-nahs; phone booths), identifi-
able by the big dotted T (for Telefónica) on
the side, on virtually every corner and
block in cities. I suggest that you pick up a
phone card so you don’t have to fumble
around with coins and keep pumping them
into the meter. To make a call, pick up the
receiver and wait for the dial tone. The dis-
play will say INSERTE MONEDAS O TARJETA, your
cue to insert your card or at least .25€
($.30) in coins.
If you’re making a local call, dial the two-
digit city code first (even if you’re calling
the bar across the street, you have to dial
the city code, 93 in Barcelona, 91 in
Madrid, and so on) and then the seven-
digit number — firmly and deliberately. Go
too fast, and the numbers may not register.
Verify the number you’re calling on the dis-
play. If you’re using coins, a message
comes on to warn you that you’re running
low on phone fuel — an urgent signal to
cram some more small coins into the slot.
When you’re finished with the call, hang
Spain For Dummies, 4th Edition 
502

up and collect either unused money or
your card.
To make a long-distance call within Spain,
the procedure is exactly the same because
you have to dial the city prefix no matter
where you’re calling.
To make an international call, dial 00 and
wait for the international dial tone. Dial the
desired country code, city code, and
number. If calling New York, for example,
you dial: 00 + 1 (U.S.) + 212 (NY) + 555-5555
(phone number). The number to dial for
directory information is % 1003; for inter-
national directory information in Europe,
dial % 1008; for information in the rest of
the world, including North America, call
% 1005. An English-speaking operator can
furnish callers with information on all
national and international codes.
Here are the basic toll-free access num-
bers you’ll need to use your home long-dis-
tance calling card for calls while in Spain
(make sure you check with your company
before going — sometimes the charges
are still very expensive). The following
numbers will get you to an English-speak-
ing operator: Sprint (% 900-99-13); MCI
(% 900-99-14); AT&T (% 900-99-11).
Public telephone offices called locutorios
are where you can place calls (long-
distance and international) with the assis-
tance of a clerk who places the call for
you. You have two major advantages when
using a locutorio: You pay for the call after-
wards (although not getting to see how
much the call is costing you may not be an
advantage), and it’s usually infinitely qui-
eter than making a cabina call on the
street.
Unless it’s an emergency, I don’t recom-
mend making even a local call from your
hotel room. The markup (called a “sur-
charge”) is outlandish — up to several
hundred percent. Make a few phone calls
over the course of your stay and watch
your room bill skyrocket. But whatever you
do, don’t make an overseas call from your
room without a home-country calling card.
Even using a calling card, don’t be sur-
prised if the hotel tacks on an additional
surcharge for making supposedly toll-free
connection calls. If they seem ridiculous to
you — as much as 1€ ($1.20) per call —
don’t think twice about arguing the point
when it comes time to pay your bill (though
you may get nowhere). One thing I’ve
heard about, but never had to deal with
myself in Spain, is hotels that block outgo-
ing calls made via other carriers. If you
can’t get through to one of the access
numbers listed previously, ask your hotel if
the number is blocked. If it is, tell them you
will gladly change hotels — and write
every guidebook on the planet to tell them
of the hotel’s discriminatory policy.
Sending faxes from your hotel can also be
ridiculously expensive. Finding an Internet
cafe and sending an e-mail if possible is
much cheaper.
Time Zone
Spain is one hour ahead of Greenwich
Mean Time, or six hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time in the United States.
Daylight saving time is in effect from the
second Sunday in March to the first
Sunday in November.
Tipping
Because a service charge is normally
included in hotel and restaurant bills, tip-
ping isn’t obligatory. However, it’s custom-
ary and expected to leave a few coins
(about 5 percent of the bill) after service at
a bar counter, and 10 percent on restau-
rant bills. Taxi drivers don’t need to be
tipped unless one gives you special serv-
ice. Additional guidelines: Hotel porter, 1€
($1.20); lavatory attendant, .25€ ($.30); tour
guide, 10 percent of the cost of the tour.

Weather Updates
The best source for weather forecasts in
Spain, assuming you don’t have access 
to the Internet, is the local newspaper. 
You need to familiarize yourself with 
centigrade temperatures, however. The
best Web site to consult is The Weather
Channel (www.weather.com), which
allows you to plug in any Spanish city des-
tination and get a five-day forecast.

Where to Find More Information
You can get tons of information about all things Spanish, large and small,
from the Internet, tourism offices, and travel agents. Remember, though,
that almost all of those outfits have a clear financial interest in luring you
to their deal or their part of the world, so it’s not impartial information.
Getting the official line
The Tourist Offices of Spain, with outposts in several countries, are good
places to start. They put out monthly newsletters and have stockrooms
full of brochures put out by every regional government and tour organiz-
ers, including information on the national paradores (a government-
operated chain of hotels usually in historic buildings — palaces, former
monasteries, and the like). They also have reams of information on
Spanish culture and customs, and they operate useful Web sites, www.
okspain.org and www.spain.info, with links to all sorts of travel infor-
mation. You can also get maps of most major Spanish cities and all
regions from them.

Surfing the Web
I’ve compiled some of the best online resources to Spain (see below). In
addition to these, I provide you with other, more specific sites (including
hotel Web sites) throughout the book.
The best Web sites to start with are those run by Spain’s Department of
Tourism and its National Tourist Offices abroad. Turespaña’s Web site,
www.tourspain.es, is the next best thing to the book you’re holding in
your hands. Go to the site and click on leisure travel, adventure travel,
or business travel. Its News feature has Spain news from around the
world, including from London (Londres, with news relevant to U.K. trav-
elers) and the U.S. The A–Z feature has good listings on things like
“Accommodations” and “Sun and Beaches,” and features a helpful
“Temperature Converter” (just plug a Celsius temp in and it comes out 
in Fahrenheit degrees).
The U.S. Tourist Offices of Spain operate a Web site, www.okspain.org. It
has detailed “Before You Go” information (including U.S. air departures).
Logging on to regional sites
For detailed information about Barcelona, try www.bcn.es, www.
barcelonaturisme.com, and www.barcelona-on-line.es. You can
find information about the Costa Brava and the city of Girona, as well

net, www.paisvasco.net, or www.euskadi.net. Information on the city
of Bilbao is at www.bilbao.net, and the other important Basque city,
San Sebastián, at www.donostia.org and www.sansebastianturismo.
com. For Pamplona and the rest of Navarra, the address is www.cf
navarra.es. You can find specific information about Pamplona at
www.pamplona.net.
Madrid’s site, www.munimadrid.es, has been improved and is now avail-
able in English. Other sites worth a look are www.descubremadrid.com
and www.madrid.org/turismo. The smaller cities in Castile also have
their own sites: www.avilaturismo.net, www.segovianet.com, www.
infosegovia.com, www.salamanca.es, and www.guiatoledo.com.
Andalusia, the region in the south of Spain, has a main site, www.
andalucia.org, as well as official sites for individual cities. Information
about Seville is at www.sevilla.org and www.turismosevilla.org,
Córdoba at www.turiscordoba.es, Ronda at www.ronda.net, Granada
at www.turismodegranada.org and www.granada.org.
Some of Spain’s greatest hits also have their own Web sites. Pamplona’s
Running of the Bulls festival tramples the Web at www.sanfermin.com.
Locating hotel and train information
To look into a selection of Spanish hotels, check out the Web sites
www.interhotel.com and www.hotelsearch.com. For the Spanish
