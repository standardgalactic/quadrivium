About the Author
C. C. Edwards has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and is currently teaching mathematics on the
undergraduate and graduate levels. She has been using technology
in the classroom since before Texas Instruments came out with their
first graphing calculator, and she frequently gives workshops at
national and international conferences on using technology in the
classroom. She has written forty activities for the Texas Instruments
Explorations Web site, and she was an editor of Eightysomething, a
newsletter that used to be published by Texas Instruments. (She still
hasn’t forgiven TI for canceling that newsletter.)
Just barely five feet tall, CC, as her friends call her, has three goals
in life: to be six inches taller, to have naturally curly hair, and to be
independently wealthy. As yet, she is nowhere close to meeting 
any of these goals. When she retires, she plans to become an old
lady carpenter.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to Mr. August, my sixth-grade teacher.


Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank Connie Hughes, business development manager at
Texas Instruments, for suggesting that I write this book and for
helping me get answers to my technical questions. And the folks at
John Wiley & Sons who deserve special thanks are Melody Layne,
acquisitions editor, and Kala Schrager and Christopher Morris, 
project editors. Melody and Kala very quickly taught me that a 
For Dummies book is a very special type of book. They were like
the math student who always asks, “What’s this used for?” Chris
explained the ropes to me, kept me on schedule, and gave me
extremely good criticism. In fact, I think it is safe to say that these
three people have made me a better teacher.
On the home front I’d like to thank Stephen Shauger for volunteer-
ing to take over my teaching duties so that I could take the summer
off to write this book. And I give many, many thanks to my math
soulmates Ioana Mihaila, Olcay Akman, and Fusun Akman for the
stimulating conversations and great friendship. I also thank their
children Iulia, Cornelia, and Devin for the many happy times we
have had together. A special thanks goes to Devin for lending me
his TI-83 calculator.

Introduction
D
o you know how to use the TI-83, TI-83 Plus, or TI-83 Plus
Silver Edition graphing calculator to do each of the following?
 Solve equations and systems of equations
 Analyze loan options
 Graph functions, parametric equations, polar equations, and
sequences
 Create stat plots and analyze statistical data
 Multiply matrices
 Write a program
 Transfer files between two or more calculators
 Save calculator files on your computer
 Add applications to your calculator so it can do even more
than it could when you bought it
If not, then this is the book for you. Contained within these pages
are straightforward, easy-to-follow directions that tell how to do
everything listed here — and much, much more.
About This Book
Although this book does not tell you how to do everything the cal-
culator is capable of doing, it gets pretty close. It covers more than
just the basics of using the calculator, paying special attention to
warning you of the problems you could encounter if you knew only
the basics of using the calculator. 
This is a reference book. It’s process-driven, not application-
driven. You won’t be given a problem to solve and then be told
how to use the calculator to solve that particular problem. Instead,
you’re given the steps needed to get the calculator to perform a
particular task, such as constructing a histogram. 

Conventions Used in This Book
When I refer to “the calculator,” I am referring to the TI-83 Plus and
the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, as well as the TI-83. Sometimes — 
not often — the TI-83 works differently from the other two Plus 
calculators. When that’s the case, I offer directions for the TI-83 
in parentheses. 
When I want you to press a key on the calculator, I use an icon for
that key. For example, if I want you to press the ENTER key, I say
press Õ. If I want you to press a series of keys, such as the Stat
key and then the Right Arrow key, I say (for example) press Ö~.
All keys on the calculator are pressed one at a time. On the calcula-
tor, there is no such thing as holding down one key while you press
another key.
It’s tricky enough to get handy with the location of the keys on the
calculator, and even more of a challenge to remember the location
of the secondary functions (the yellow functions above the key).
So when I want you to access one of those functions, I give you the
actual keystrokes. For example, if I want you to access the Draw
menu, I tell you to press yè. This is a simpler method than
that of the manual that came with your calculator — which would
say press y< and then make you hunt for the location of the
secondary function DRAW. The same principle holds for using key
combinations to enter specific characters; for example, I tell you to
press É) to enter a space.
When I want you to use the Arrow keys, but not in any specific
order, I say press ~|}Ü. If I want you to use only the Up- and
Down-Arrow keys, I say press }Ü.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, you don’t have to read anything you don’t want to. The
only items in this book that really don’t need to be read are the
items that follow a Technical Stuff icon. These items are designed
for the curious reader who wants to know, but doesn’t really need
to know, why something happens.
Other items that you may not need to read are the paragraphs that
follow the steps in a procedure. These paragraphs are designed to
give you extra help should you need it. The steps themselves are in
bold; the explanatory paragraphs are in a normal font.

Foolish Assumptions
My nonfoolish assumption is that you know (in effect) nothing
about using the calculator, or you wouldn’t be reading this book.
My foolish assumptions are as follows:
 You own, or have access to, one of the calculators listed on
the cover of this book.
 If you want to transfer files from your calculator to your com-
puter, I assume that you have a computer and know the basics
of how to operate it.
How This Book Is Organized
The parts of this book are organized by tasks that you would like
to have the calculator perform.
Part I: Making Friends 
with the Calculator
This part describes the basics of using the calculator. It addresses
such tasks as adjusting the contrast and getting the calculator to
perform basic arithmetic operations.
Part II: Advanced Functions,
Complex Numbers, and 
Solving Equations
Here things get more complicated. This part tells you how to use
the many great functions housed in the Math menu, such as the
function that converts a decimal to a fraction. This part also tells
you how to deal with complex numbers and use the calculator to
solve an equation.
Part III: Dealing with Finances
This part tells you how to use the really great Finance application
housed in your calculator to do things like calculate the best inter-
est rate and find internal rates of return.
Introduction

Part IV: Graphing and 
Analyzing Functions
In this part, think visual. Part IV tells you how to graph and analyze
functions, draw on your graph, and create a table for the graph. 
Part V: Sequences, Parametric
Equations, and Polar Equations
This part describes how you can graph and analyze parametric
equations, polar equations, and sequences. 
Part VI: Probability and Statistics
It’s highly probable that Part VI will tell you how to deal with prob-
ability and statistics.
Part VII: Dealing with Matrices
Red pill or blue pill? Part VII takes you deep inside the world of
matrices.
Part VIII: Communicating with PCs
and Other Calculators
Your calculator joins the information superhighway. Part VIII
describes how you can save calculator files on a computer and
how you can transfer files from one calculator to another.
Part IX: The Part of Tens
Part IX contains a plethora of wonderful information. This part
tells you about the many wonderful applications you can put on
your calculator and it describes the most common errors and
error messages that you may encounter.

Icons Used in This Book
This book uses three icons to help you along the way. Here’s what
they are and what they mean:
The text following this icon tells you about shortcut and other
ways of enhancing your use of the calculator.
The text following this icon tells you something you should remem-
ber because if you don’t it may cause you problems later. Usually
it’s a reminder to enter the appropriate type of number so you can
avoid an error message.
There is no such thing as crashing the calculator. But this icon
warns you of those few times when you can do something wrong
on the calculator and be totally baffled because the calculator is
giving you confusing feedback — either no error message or a
cryptic error message that doesn’t really tell you the true location
of the problem.
This is the stuff you don’t really need to read unless you’re really
curious.
Where to Go from Here
This book is designed so that you do not have to read it from cover
to cover. You don’t even have to start reading at the beginning of a
chapter. When you want to know how to get the calculator to do
something, just start reading at the beginning of the appropriate
section. The Index and Table Of Contents should help you find
whatever you’re looking for.

his part takes you once around the block with the basics
of using the calculator. In addition to showing you how
to use the calculator to evaluate arithmetic expressions, I
discuss the elementary calculator functions — including
multi-use keys, menus, modes, and the Catalog. I also cover
expressions and the order of operations, storing and recall-
ing variables, and combining expressions.

he TI-83 and TI-83 Plus graphics calculators are loaded with
many useful features. With them, you can graph and investi-
gate functions, parametric equations, polar equations, and
sequences. You can use them to analyze statistical data and to
manipulate matrices. You can even use them to calculate mortgage
payments. 
But if you’ve never used a graphics calculator before, you may at
first find it a bit intimidating. After all, it contains about two dozen
menus, many of which contain three or four submenus. But it’s
really not that hard to get used to using the calculator. After you
get familiar with what the calculator is capable of doing, finding
the menu that houses the command you need is quite easy. And
you have this book to help you along the way. 
When to Change the Batteries
The convenience of battery power has a traditional downside:
What if the batteries run out of juice at a crucial moment, say
during a final exam? Fortunately, the calculator gives you some
leeway. When your batteries are low, the calculator displays a
“Your batteries are low” warning message. After you see this mes-
sage for the first time, the calculator should, according to the man-
ufacturer, continue to function just fine for at least one week. There
is one exception: If you attempt to download an application when
the batteries are low, the calculator displays a “Batteries are low —

Change is required” warning message and refuses to download the
application until after you’ve changed the batteries. (Chapter 27
explains how to download applications.)
Because you’ve likely put batteries into countless toys, you should
have no trouble opening the cover on the back of the calculator
and popping in four AAA batteries. Above the AAA battery cham-
ber is a panel that opens to the compartment containing the
backup battery. The type of battery housed in this compartment is
indicated on the lid of the panel. The manufacturer recommends
that you replace this battery every three or four years. So mark
your calendar!
Turning the Calculator On and Off
Press … to turn the calculator on. To turn the calculator off, press
y, and then press …. These keys are in the left column of the
keyboard. The … key is at the bottom of the column, and the y
key is the second key from the top of this column.
To prolong the life of the batteries, the calculator automatically
turns itself off after five minutes of inactivity. But don’t worry —
when you press …, all your work will appear on the calculator
just as you left it before the calculator turned itself off.
In some types of light, the screen can be hard to see. To increase
the contrast, repeatedly press y}. Because the keys on the cal-
culator must be pressed one at a time, press y and then press }.
Continue pressing this combination of keystrokes until you have
the desired contrast. 
To decrease the contrast, repeatedly press yÜ.
Using the Keyboard
The row of keys under the calculator screen contains the keys you
use when graphing. The next three rows, for the most part, contain
editing keys, menu keys, and arrow keys. The arrow keys (~|}Ü)
control the movement of the cursor. The remaining rows contain,
among other things, the keys you typically find on a scientific 
calculator.
Keys on the calculator are always pressed one at a time; they are
never pressed simultaneously. In this book, an instruction such as
y… indicates that you should first press y and then press ….

Accessing the functions in yellow
Above and to the left of most keys is a secondary key function writ-
ten in yellow. To access that function, first press y and then
press the key. For example, π is in yellow above the õ key, so to
use π in an expression, press y and then press õ.
Because hunting for the function in yellow can be tedious, in this
book I use only the actual keystrokes. For example, I will make
statements like, “π is entered into the calculator by pressing
yõ.” Most other books would state, “π is entered into the calcu-
lator by pressing y [π].”
When the y key is active and the calculator is waiting for you to
press the next key, the blinking $ cursor symbol is replaced with
the n symbol.
Using the É key to write words
Above and to the right of most keys is a letter written in green. To
access these letters, first press É and then press the key. For
example, because the letter O is in green above the ¨ key, to enter
this letter, press É and then press ¨.
Because hunting for letters on the calculator can be tedious, I tell
you the exact keystrokes needed to create them. For example, if I
want you to enter the letter O, I say, “Press É¨ to enter the
letter O.” Most other books would say “Press É [O]” and leave
it up to you to figure out where that letter is on the calculator.
You must press É before entering each letter. However, if
you want to enter many letters, first press yÉ to lock the
calculator in Alpha mode. Then all you have to do is press the
keys for the various letters. When you’re finished, press É to
take the calculator out of Alpha mode. For example, to enter the
word TEST into the calculator, press yÉWòµW and then
press É to tell the calculator that you’re no longer entering 
letters.
When the calculator is in Alpha mode, the blinking $ cursor
symbol is replaced with the ÿ symbol. This symbol indicates that
the next key you press will insert the green letter above that key.
To take the calculator out of Alpha mode, press É.
Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics 11

Using the Õ key
The Õ key is used to evaluate expressions and to execute com-
mands. After you have, for example, entered an arithmetic expres-
sion (such as 5 + 4), press Õ to evaluate that expression. In this
context, the Õ key functions as the equal sign. Entering arith-
metic expressions is explained in Chapter 2.
Using the Ñ key
Ñ is the key you use to enter the variable in the definition of a
function, a parametric equation, a polar equation, or a sequence. In
Function mode, this key produces the variable X. In Parametric
mode it produces the variable T; and in Polar and Sequence modes
it produces the variables θ and n, respectively. Setting the mode is
explained later in this chapter.
Using the Arrow keys
The Arrow keys (~, |, }, and Ü) control the movement of the
cursor. These keys are in a circular pattern in the upper-right
corner of the keyboard. As expected, ~ moves the cursor to the
right, | moves it to the left, and so on. When I want you to use the
Arrow keys — but not in any specific order — I refer to them all
together, as in: “Use ~|}Ü to place the cursor on the entry.”
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator

Keys to remember
The following keystrokes are invaluable:
 yz: This is the equivalent of the Escape key on a computer. It gets you out
of whatever you’re doing (or have finished doing) and returns you to the Home
screen. The Home screen is where the action takes place. This is where you
execute commands and evaluate expressions.
 Õ: This key is used to execute commands and to evaluate expressions.
When evaluating expressions, it’s the equivalent of the equal sign.
 ë: This is the “erase” key. If you’re entering something into the calculator
and change your mind, press this key. If you want to erase the contents of the
Home screen, repeatedly press this key until the Home screen is blank.

What Is the Home Screen?
The Home screen is the screen that appears on the calculator when
you first turn it on. This is the screen where most of the action
takes place as you use the calculator — it’s where you evaluate
expressions and execute commands. This is also the screen you
usually return to after you’ve completed a task such as entering a
matrix in the Matrix editor or entering data in the Stat List editor. 
Press yz to return to the Home screen from any other screen.
This combination of keystrokes, yz, is the equivalent of the
“escape” key on a computer. It always takes you back to the Home
screen.
If you want to clear the contents of the Home screen, repeatedly
press ë until the Home screen is blank.
The Busy Indicator
If you see a moving vertical line in the upper-right corner of the
screen, this indicates that the calculator is busy graphing a func-
tion, evaluating an expression, or executing a command. 
If it’s taking too long for the calculator to graph a function, evalu-
ate an expression, or execute a command, and you want to abort
the process, press …. If you’re then confronted with a menu that
asks you to select either Quit or Goto, select Quit to abort the
process.
Editing Entries
The calculator offers four ways to edit an entry:
 Deleting the entire entry:
Use ~|}Ü to place the cursor anywhere in the entry and
then press ë and to delete the entry.
 Erasing part of an entry:
To erase a single character, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor
on the character you want to delete and then press { to
delete that character.
Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics 13

Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
14
 Inserting characters:
Because “typing over” is the default mode, to insert charac-
ters you must first press y{ to enter Insert mode. When
you insert characters, the inserted characters are placed to
the left of the cursor. For example, if you want to insert CD
between B and E in the word ABEF, you would place the
cursor on E to make the insertion.
To insert characters, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor at the
location of the desired insertion, press y{, and then key
in the characters you want to insert. When you’re finished
inserting characters, press one of the Arrow keys to take the
calculator out of Insert mode.
 Keying over existing characters:
“Type over” is the default mode of the calculator. So if you
want to overtype existing characters, just use ~|}Ü to put
the cursor where you want to start, and then use the key-
board to enter new characters.
On the Home screen, the calculator doesn’t allow you to directly
edit an already-evaluated expression or an already-executed com-
mand. But you can recall that expression or command if it was the
last entry you made in the calculator — and when it’s recalled, you
can edit it. To recall the last expression or command, press
yÕ. This makes the calculator paste a copy of the desired
expression or command on the Home screen so you can edit it.
Using Menus
Most functions and commands you use are found in the menus
housed in the calculator — and just about every chapter in this
book refers to them. This section is designed to give you an
overview of how to find and select menu items.
Accessing a menu
Each menu has its own key or key combination. For example, to
access the Math menu, press ç; to access the Test menu, press
yç. An example of a menu appears in the first picture in
Figure 1-1. This is a picture of the Math menu.

Some menus, such as the Math menu, contain submenus. This is
also illustrated in the first picture in Figure 1-1. This picture shows
that the submenus in the Math menu are MATH, NUM, CPX, and
PRB (Math, Number, Complex, and Probability). Repeatedly press
~ to view the items on the other submenus; repeatedly press | to
return to the Math MATH submenu. This is illustrated in the
second and third pictures in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1: Submenus of the Math menu.
Scrolling a menu
After the number 7 in the first two pictures in Figure 1-1, a down
arrow indicates that more items are available in the menu than
appear on-screen. There’s no down arrow after the 7 in the third
picture in Figure 1-1 because that menu has exactly seven items.
To see menu items that don’t appear on-screen, repeatedly press
Ü. To get quickly to the bottom of a menu from the top of the
menu, press }. Similarly, to quickly get from the bottom to the top,
press Ü. 
Selecting menu items
To select a menu item from a menu, key in the number (or letter) of
the item or use Ü to highlight the number (or letter) of the item
and then press Õ.
Some menus, such as the Mode menu that is pictured in Figure 1-2,
require that you select an item from a list of items by highlighting
that item. The list of items usually appear in a single row and the
calculator requires that one item in each row be highlighted. To
highlight an item, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor on the item and
then press Õ to highlight the item. The selections on the Mode
menu are described in the next section.
Math MATH menu
Math NUM menu
Math PRB menu
Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics 15

Setting the Mode 
The Mode menu, which is accessed by pressing z, is the most
important menu on the calculator; it tells the calculator how you
want numbers and graphs to be displayed. The Mode menu is pic-
tured in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-2: The Mode menu.
One item in each row of this menu must be selected. Here are your
choices:
 Normal, Sci, or Eng:
This setting controls how numbers are displayed on the calcu-
lator. In Normal mode, the calculator displays numbers in the
usual numeric fashion that you used in elementary school —
provided it can display it using no more than ten digits. If the
number requires more than ten digits, the calculator displays
it using scientific notation.
In Scientific (Sci) mode, numbers are displayed using scien-
tific notation; and in Engineering (Eng) mode, numbers are
displayed in engineering notation. These three modes are
illustrated in Figure 1-3. In this figure, the first answer is dis-
played in normal notation, the second in scientific notation,
and the third in engineering notation.
In scientific and engineering notation, the calculator uses En
to denote multiplication by 10n.

and engineering notations.

 Float 0123456789:
Select Float if you want the calculator to display as many
digits as possible. Select 0 if you want all numbers rounded to
an integer. If you’re dealing with money, select 2 so that all
numbers will be rounded to two decimal places. Selecting 5
rounds all numbers to five decimal places, and, well, you get
the idea.
 Radian or Degree:
If you select Radian, all angles entered in the calculator are
interpreted as being in radian measure; all angular answers
given by the calculator will also be in radian measure.
Similarly, if you select Degree, any angle you enter must be in
degree measure, and any angular answer given by the calcula-
tor is also in degree measure.
 Func, Par, Pol, or Seq:
This setting tells the calculator what type of functions you
plan to graph. Select Func to graph plain old vanilla functions,
y = f(x). Select Par to graph parametric equations; Pol to
graph polar equations; and Seq to graph sequences.
(Sequences are also called iterative equations.)
 Connected or Dot:
In Dot mode, the calculator produces a graph by plotting only
the points it calculates. In Connected mode, the calculator
joins consecutively plotted points with a line.
My recommendation is to select the Connected mode because
each of the graphing options (Func, Par, Pol, and Seq) allows
you to select a graphing style, one of which is the dot style.
 Sequential or Simul:
In Sequential mode, the calculator completes the graph of
one function before it graphs the next function. In
Simultaneous (Simul) mode, the calculator graphs all func-
tions at the same time. It does so by plotting the values of all
functions for one value of the independent variable, and then
plotting the values of all functions for the next value of the
independent variable.
Simul mode is useful if you want to see whether two functions
intersect at the same value of the independent variable. You
have to watch the functions as they are graphed in order to
see if this happens. 
Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics 17

 Real, a + bi, or re^θi:
If you’re dealing with only real numbers, select the Real mode.
If you’re dealing with complex numbers, select a + bi if you
want the complex numbers displayed in rectangular form. If
you want complex numbers displayed in polar form, select
the re^θi mode.
 Full, Horiz, or G-T:
The Full screen mode displays the screen as you see it when
you turn the calculator on. The other screen modes are split-
screen modes. The Horiz mode is for when you want to dis-
play a graph and the Y= editor or the Home screen at the
same time. Use the G-T mode when you want to display a
graph and a table at the same time. (The split-screen modes
are explained in detail in Chapters 9, 10, 14, 15, and 16.)
If you’re planning on graphing trigonometric functions, put the cal-
culator in Radian mode. Reason: Most trig functions are graphed
for -2π ≤x ≤2π. That is approximately -6.28 ≤x ≤6.28. That’s not a
bad value for the limits on the x-axis. But if you graph in Degree
mode, you would need – 360 ≤x ≤360 for the limits on the x-axis.
This is doable . . . but trust me, it’s easier to graph in Radian mode.
If your calculator is in Radian mode and you want to enter an angle
in degrees, Chapter 3 tells you how to do so without resetting the
mode.
Using the Catalog
The calculator’s Catalog houses every command and function used
by the calculator. However, it’s easier to use the keyboard and the
menus to access these commands and functions than it is to use
the Catalog. There are several exceptions; for example, the hyper-
bolic functions are found only in the Catalog. If you have to use the
Catalog, here’s how to do it:
1. If necessary, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor at the loca-
tion where you want to insert a command or function
found in the Catalog.
The command or function is usually inserted on the Home
screen, or in the Y= editor when you’re defining a function
you plan to graph.

18

2. Press y) to enter the Catalog.
This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 1-4.
3. Enter the first letter in the name of the command or
function.
Notice that the calculator is already in Alpha Mode, as is
indicated by the ÿ in the upper-right part of the screen. To
enter the letter, all you have to do is press the key corre-
sponding to that letter. For example, if you’re using the
Catalog to access the hyperbolic function tanh, press W
because the letter T is written in green above this key. This
is illustrated in the second picture in Figure 1-4.
4. Repeatedly press Ü to move the indicator to the desired
command or function.
5. Press Õ to select the command or function.
This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 1-4. After
pressing Õ, the command or function is inserted at the
cursor location.

hen you use the calculator to evaluate an arithmetic
expression such as 510 + 46, the format in which the calcula-
tor displays the answer depends on how you have set the Mode of
the calculator. Do you want answers displayed in scientific nota-
tion? Do you want all numbers rounded to two decimal places?
Setting the mode of the calculator affords you the opportunity to
tell the calculator how you want these, and other questions,
answered. (Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.) When
you’re doing basic, real-number arithmetic, the mode is usually set
as it appears in Figure 1-2 of Chapter 1.
Entering and Evaluating
Expressions
Arithmetic expressions are evaluated on the Home screen. The
Home screen is the screen you see when you turn the calculator
on. If the Home screen is not already displayed on the calculator,
press yz to display it. If you want to clear the contents of the
Home screen, repeatedly press ë until the screen is empty.
Arithmetic expressions are entered in the calculator the same way
you would write them on paper if you were restricted to using the
division sign (/) for fractional notation. This restriction sometimes
requires parentheses around the numerator or the denominator, as
illustrated in the first two calculations in Figure 2-1.

There is a major difference between the subtraction c key and the
Ã negation key. They are not the same, nor are they interchange-
able. Use the c key to indicate subtraction; use the Ã key before a
number to identify that number as negative. If you improperly use
Ã to indicate a subtraction problem, or if you improperly use c to
indicate that a number is negative, you get the ERR: SYNTAX error
message. The use of these two symbols is illustrated in the last cal-
culation in Figure 2-1.
When entering numbers, do not use commas. For example, the
number 1,000,000 is entered in the calculator as 1000000.
After entering the expression, press Õ to evaluate it. The calcu-
lator displays the answer on the right side of the next line, as
shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Evaluating arithmetic expressions.
Important Keys
Starting with the fifth row of the calculator, you find the functions
commonly used on a scientific calculator. Here’s what they are and
how you use them:
 π and e:
The transcendental numbers π and e are respectively located
in the fifth and sixth rows of the last column of the keyboard.
To enter π in the calculator, press yõ; to enter e, press
y•, as shown in the first line of Figure 2-2.
 The trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions:
The trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions are
located in the fifth row of the keyboard. These functions
require that the argument of the function be enclosed in
parentheses. To remind you of this, the calculator provides
the first parenthesis for you (as in the first line of Figure 2-2).
 The square-root and exponential functions:
The square-root function, 10x function, and ex function are
respectively located in the sixth, seventh, and eighth rows of
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
22

the first column on the keyboard. Each of these functions
requires that its argument be enclosed in parentheses. To
remind you of this, the calculator provides the first parenthe-
sis for you (as in the third line of Figure 2-2).
Figure 2-2: Examples of arithmetic expressions.
 The inverse and square functions:
The inverse and square functions are respectively located 
in the fifth and sixth rows of the left column on the calculator.
To enter the multiplicative inverse of a number, enter the
number and then press ó. Similarly, to square a number, enter
the number and then press °. The third line of Figure 2-2
shows this operation.
If you want to evaluate an arithmetic expression and you need a
function other than those just listed, you’ll most likely find that
function in the Math menu (described in detail in the next chap-
ter). The hyperbolic functions are an exception; those you find in
the calculator’s Catalog. (Chapter 1 discusses the Catalog and how
to access the hyperbolic functions).
Order of Operations
The order in which the calculator performs operations is the stan-
dard order that we are all used to. Spelled out in detail, here is the
order in which the calculator performs operations:
1. The calculator simplifies all expressions surrounded by
parentheses.
2. The calculator evaluates all functions that are followed
by the argument.
These functions supply the first parenthesis in the pair of
parentheses that must surround the argument. An example
is sin x. When you press ò to access this function, the
calculator inserts sin( on-screen. You then enter the argu-
ment and press §.
Chapter 2: Doing Basic Arithmetic 23

3. The calculator evaluates all functions entered after the
argument.
An example of such a function is the square function. You
enter the argument and then press ° to square it.
Evaluating –32 may not give you the expected answer. We
think of –3 as being a single, negative number. So when we
square it, we expect to get +9. But the calculator gets –9 (as
indicated in the fifth line of Figure 2-2). This happens
because the normal way to enter –3 into the calculator 
is by pressing Ã¬ — and pressing the Ã key is equivalent
to multiplying by –1. Thus, in this context, –32 = –1 * 32 = –1 *
9 = –9. To avoid this potentially hazardous problem, always
surround negative numbers with parentheses before raising
them to a power.
4. The calculator evaluates powers entered using the õ key
and roots entered using the x√function.
The x√function is found in the Math menu which is
explained in Chapter 3. You can also enter various roots by
using fractional exponents — for example, the cube root of
8 can be entered as 8^(1/3).
5. The calculator evaluates all multiplication and division
problems as it encounters them, proceeding from left to
right.
6. The calculator evaluates all addition and subtraction
problems as it encounters them, proceeding from left to
right.
Well, okay, what does the phrase “x plus 1 divided by x minus 2”
actually mean when you say it aloud? Well, that depends on how
you say it. Said without pausing, it means (x + 1)/(x – 2). Said with
a subtle pause after the “plus” and another before the “minus,” it
means x + (1/x) – 2. The calculator can’t hear speech inflection, so
make good use of those parentheses when you’re “talking” to the
calculator.
Using the Previous Answer
You can use the previous answer in the next arithmetic expression
you want to evaluate. If that answer is to appear at the beginning of
the arithmetic expression, first key in the operation that is to
appear after the answer. The calculator displays Ans followed by
the operation. Then key in the rest of the arithmetic expression and
press Õ to evaluate it, as illustrated in Figure 2-3. 
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
24

Figure 2-3: Steps for starting an expression with the last answer.
If you want to embed the last answer in the next arithmetic expres-
sion, key in the beginning of the expression to the point where you
want to insert the previous answer. Then press yÃ to key in the
last answer. Finally, key in the rest of the expression and press
Õ to evaluate it, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: Steps for embedding the last answer in an expression.
Recycling the Last Entry
If you want to reuse the last command, function, or expression
entered in the calculator — but with different instructions,
arguments, or variables — you can simply recall that command,
function, or expression and then edit it. To do so, follow these
steps:
1. Enter the command, function, or expression on the Home
screen and then press Õ to execute command or eval-
uate the function.
This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 2-5. 
2. Press yÕ to paste a copy of that command or func-
tion on the home screen.
This procedure is shown in the second picture in Figure 2-5.
3. Edit the command, function, or expression and then
press Õ to reevaluate it.
The third picture in Figure 2-5 shows this procedure.
Editing is explained in Chapter 1.

Storing Variables
If you plan to use the same number many times when evaluating
arithmetic expressions, consider storing that number in a variable.
To do so, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press yz to enter the Home screen.
2. Enter the number you want to store in a variable.
You can store the number as an arithmetic expression. 
This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 2-6. After you
complete the steps for storing the number, the calculator
evaluates that expression.
3. Press ø.
The result of this action is shown in the first picture in
Figure 2-6.
4. Press É and then press the key corresponding to the
letter of the variable in which you want to store the
number.
The second picture in Figure 2-6 shows this process. The
letters used for storing variables are the letters of the
alphabet and the Greek letter θ.
5. Press Õ to store the value.
This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 2-6.
The number you store in a variable remains stored in that variable
until you or the calculator stores a new number in that variable.
Because the calculator uses the letters X, T, and θ when graphing
functions, parametric equations, and polar equations, it is possible
that the calculator will change the value stored in these variables
Original expression
Press y Õ     
Edit expression
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
26

when the calculator is in graphing mode. For example, if you store
a number in the variable X and then ask the calculator to find the
zero of the graphed function X2, the calculator will replace the
number stored in X with 0, the zero of X2. So avoid storing values in
these three variables if you want that value to remain stored in
that variable after you have graphed functions, parametric equa-
tions, or polar equations.
Figure 2-6: Steps for storing a number in a variable.
After you have stored a number in a variable, you can insert that
number into an arithmetic expression. To do so, place the cursor
where you want the number to appear, press É, and then
press the key corresponding to the letter of the variable in which
the number is stored. Figure 2-7 shows how.
Figure 2-7: Inserting a stored variable into an expression.
Combining Expressions
You can combine (link) several expressions or commands into one
expression by using a colon to separate the expressions or com-
mands. The colon is entered into the calculator by pressing
ÉÀ.
Combining expressions is a really handy way to write mini-
programs, as detailed in the “Writing a mini-program” sidebar.

Writing a mini-program
This figure depicts a program that calculates n2 when n is a positive integer. The
first line of the program initiates the program by storing the value 1 in n and calcu-
lating its square. (Storing a number in a variable and combining expressions are
explained elsewhere in this chapter.)
The next line on the left shows the real guts of the program. It increments n by 1
and then calculates the square of the new value of n. Of course, the calculator
doesn’t do these calculations until after you press Õ. But the really neat thing
about this is that the calculator will continue to execute this same command each
time you Õ. Because n is incremented by 1 each time you press Õ, you
get the values of n2 when n is a positive integer.

re you hunting for the absolute value function? Look no far-
ther — it’s in the Math menu. Do you want to convert a deci-
mal to a fraction? You can find the function that does this in the
Math menu. In general, any math function that cannot be directly
accessed using the keyboard is housed in the Math menu. Similarly,
any function that deals with angles is housed in the Angle menu.
This chapter tells you how to access and use those functions.
The Math Menu and Submenus
Press ç to accesses the Math menu. This menu contains four
submenus: MATH, NUM, CPX, and PRB. Use the ~| keys to get
from one submenu to the next, and back again.
The Math MATH submenu contains the general mathematical func-
tions such as the cubed root function. It also contains the calcula-
tor’s Equation Solver that, as you would expect, is used to solve
equations. The Equation Solver is explained in Chapter 5. The Math
NUM submenu contains the functions usually associated with num-
bers, such as the least common multiple function. A detailed expla-
nation of the functions in these two menus is given later in this
chapter.

The Math CPX submenu contains functions normally used with
complex numbers. This submenu is explained in detail in the next
chapter. The Math PRB submenu contains the probability and
random-number functions. (Probability is explained in Chapter 17.)
Using Math menu functions
Most functions housed in the Math menu require that the argu-
ment be entered after entering the function. Such functions are
easily recognizable by the parenthesis following the name of the
function; the cube-root function, 3√(, is an example.
With one exception, functions in the Math menu that have no
parenthesis at the end of their names require that the argument 
be entered before the function is entered. The cube function is 
an example of such a function. (The exception is the xth root func-
tion, x√. This function requires that the root be entered first, then
the x√function, and then the argument.)
Inserting a Math menu function
Math menu functions are usually inserted into arithmetic expres-
sions entered on the Home screen, or into definitions of functions
in the Y= editor. Pressing yz puts you in the Home screen,
and pressing o puts you in the Y= editor. The Y= editor is used to
define functions you want to graph. This editor is explained in
detail in Chapters 9, 13, 15, and 16. To insert a Math menu function
into an expression, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor where you
want to insert the function.
Inserting a Math menu item in an arithmetic expression that
is entered on the Home screen is illustrated in Figure 3-1.
This figure shows how to insert the cube function in order
to evaluate √(23 + 17). 
2. Press ç. 
3. Use ~ to select the appropriate submenu of the Math
menu.
4. Enter the number of the function or use Ü to highlight
the number of the function and then press Õ. 
5. If necessary, complete the expression.

The Math MATH submenu
Press ç to access the Math MATH submenu. This submenu con-
tains general mathematical functions you can insert into an expres-
sion. The following sections explain the items housed in this
submenu, except for the Solver function at the bottom of the Math
MATH submenu. This latter function, used to solve equations, is
discussed in Chapter 5.
Converting between decimals and fractions
The Frac function always converts a finite decimal to a fraction.
Sometimes this function can convert an infinite repeating decimal
to a fraction. When it can’t, it lets you know by redisplaying the dec-
imal. Be sure to enter the decimal before inserting the Frac func-
tion, as shown in the first two lines of the first picture in Figure 3-2.
The Dec function converts a fraction to a decimal. Enter the frac-
tion before you insert the Dec function. An example is shown in the
first picture in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Using the functions in the Math MATH submenu. 
Cubing and taking cube roots
The cube function, 3, cubes the value that precedes the function
(as illustrated in Figure 3-1). The cube-root function, 3√, finds the
cube root of a value that follows the function. This value must be
enclosed in parentheses; the calculator supplies the opening paren-
thesis; you must supply the closing parenthesis. The first picture in
Figure 3-2 shows an example of using the cube-root function.

Chapter 3: The Math and Angle Menus 33

Taking the xth root
The xth root function, x√, finds the xth root of the value that 
follows the function. To use this function, first enter the root x, 
then insert the x√function, and then enter the argument. This is
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 3-2. In this example the 
calculator is evaluating the fourth root of 16.
Finding the location of maximum and minimum values
The fMin and fMax functions approximate where the minimum or
maximum value of a function occurs in a specified interval. They do
not compute the minimum or maximum value of the function; they
just give you the x-coordinate of the minimum or maximum point.
Chapter 11 tells you how to get the calculator to compute mini-
mum and maximum values of a function.
The fMin and fMax functions are standalone functions in the sense
that they cannot be used in an expression. To use these functions,
insert the appropriate function, fMin or fMax, at the beginning of a
new line on the Home screen. Then enter the definition of the func-
tion whose minimum or maximum you want to locate. Press ¢ and
enter the variable used in the definition of the function you just
entered. Press ¢ and enter the lower limit of the specified interval.
Then press ¢, enter the upper limit, and press §. Finally, press
Õ to approximate the location of the minimum or maximum in
the specified interval. This is illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 3-2. In this picture the calculator is approximating the location
of the maximum value of the function x2 in the interval 0 ≤x ≤2.
Doing numerical differentiation and integration
The calculator cannot perform symbolic differentiation and inte-
gration. For example, it cannot tell you that the derivative of x2 is
2x, nor can it evaluate an indefinite integral. But the nDeriv func-
tion will approximate the derivative (slope) of a function at a speci-
fied value of the variable, and the fnInt function will approximate a
definite integral.
Insert the nDeriv function, enter the function whose derivative you
want to find, and then press ¢. Enter the variable used in the defi-
nition of the function you just entered and press ¢. Then enter the
value at which the derivative is to be taken, and press §. Finally,
press Õ to approximate the derivative. This is illustrated in the
third picture in Figure 3-2.
To use the fnInt function, insert fnInt, and then enter the function
you are integrating. Press ¢ and enter the variable used in the
Part II: Advanced Functions, Complex Numbers . . . 
34

definition of the function you just entered. Press ¢ and enter the
lower limit of the definite integral. Press ¢, enter the upper limit,
and press §. Finally, press Õ to approximate the definite inte-
gral. This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 3-2.
The calculator may give you an error message or a false answer if
nDeriv is used to find the derivative at a nondifferentiable point or
if fnInt is used to evaluate an improper integral.
The Math NUM submenu
Press ç~ to access the Math NUM submenu. (Inserting a 
Math menu function into an expression is explained earlier in this
chapter.) The following sections explain the items housed in this
submenu:
Finding the absolute value
The abs function evaluates the absolute value of the number or
arithmetic expression that follows the function. This number or
expression must be enclosed in parentheses. The calculator sup-
plies the first parenthesis; you must supply the last parenthesis.
An example of using the abs function is illustrated in the first pic-
ture in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3: Using the functions in the Math NUM submenu.
Rounding numbers
The round function rounds a number or arithmetic expression to a
specified number of decimal places. The number or expression to
be rounded and the specified number of decimal places are placed
after the function separated by a comma and surrounded by paren-
theses. The calculator supplies the opening parenthesis; you must
supply the closing parenthesis. An example of using the round
function is the first picture in Figure 3-3.
Finding the integer and fractional parts of a value
The iPart and fPart functions (respectively) find the integer and
fractional parts of the number, or the arithmetic expression that
Chapter 3: The Math and Angle Menus 35

follows the function. This number or expression must be enclosed
in parentheses. The calculator supplies the opening parenthesis;
you must supply the closing parenthesis. An example of using the
iPart function is the first picture in Figure 3-3.
Using the greatest-integer function
The int function finds the largest integer that is less than or equal
to the number or arithmetic expression that follows the function.
This number or expression must be enclosed in parentheses. The
calculator supplies the opening parenthesis; you must supply the
closing parenthesis. An example of using the int function is the
second picture in Figure 3-3.
Finding minimum and maximum values in a list of numbers
The min and max functions find (respectively) the minimum and
maximum values in the list of numbers that follows the function.
Braces must surround the list, and commas must separate the ele-
ments in the list. You can access the braces on the calculator by
pressing y£ and y§. The list must be enclosed in parenthe-
ses. The calculator supplies the opening parenthesis; you must
supply the closing parenthesis. An example of using the max func-
tion is the second picture in Figure 3-3.
When using the min or max function to find the minimum or maxi-
mum of a two-element list, you can omit the braces that surround
the list. For example, min(2, 4) returns the value 2.
Finding least common multiple and greatest common divisor
The lcm and gcd functions find (respectively) the least common
multiple and the greatest common divisor of the two numbers that
follow the function. These two numbers must be separated by a
comma and surrounded by parentheses. The calculator supplies the
opening parenthesis; you must supply the closing parenthesis. An
example of using the lcm function is the second picture in Figure 3-3.
The Angle Menu
The functions housed in the Angle menu allow you to convert
between degrees and radians or convert between rectangular and
polar coordinates. They also allow you to convert between degrees
and DMS (degrees, minutes, and seconds). You can also override
the angle setting in the Mode menu of the calculator when you use
these functions. For example, if the calculator is in Radian mode
Part II: Advanced Functions, Complex Numbers . . . 
36

and you want to enter an angle measure in degrees, there is a func-
tion in the Angle menu that allows you to do so. (Setting the mode
is explained in Chapter 1.)
Converting between rectangular and polar coordinates is explained
in Chapter 16. The other topics are explained in the next sections.
Converting degrees to radians
To convert degrees to radians, follow these steps:
1. Put the calculator in Radian mode.
Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.
2. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
3. Enter the number of degrees.
4. Press yå¿ to paste in the ° function. (On the TI-83,
press yé¿.)
5. Press Õ to convert the degree measure to radians.
This is illustrated at the top of the first picture in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: Converting between degrees and radians.
If you’re a purist (like me) who likes to see radian measures
expressed as a fractional multiple of π whenever possible,
continuing with the following steps accomplishes this goal
if it’s mathematically possible.
6. Press •yõÕ to divide the radian measure by π.
This is illustrated in the third line in the first picture in
Figure 3-4.
7. Press ç¿Õ to convert the result to a fraction, if
possible.
This is illustrated at the bottom of the first picture in Figure
3-4, where 30° is equal to π/6 radians. If the calculator can’t
convert the decimal obtained in Step 6 to a fraction, it says
so by returning the decimal in Step 7.
Chapter 3: The Math and Angle Menus 37

Converting radians to degrees
To convert radians to degrees:
1. Put the calculator in Degree mode.
Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.
2. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
3. Enter the radian measure.
If the radian measure is entered as an arithmetic expres-
sion, surround that expression with parentheses. This is
illustrated at the top of the second picture in Figure 3-4.
4. Press yå¬ to paste in the r function. (On the 
TI-83, press yå¬.)
5. Press Õ to convert the radian measure to degrees.
This is illustrated in the second picture in Figure 3-4.
Converting between 
degrees and DMS
To convert degrees to DMS (degrees, minutes, seconds), follow
these steps:
1. Put the calculator in Degree mode.
Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.
2. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
3. Enter the degree measure.
4. Press yåWÕ to convert the degrees to DMS. (On
the TI-83, press yéWÕ.)
This is illustrated at the bottom of the second picture in
Figure 3-4, and also at the top of Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: Converting between degrees and DMS.

To convert DMS to degrees, follow these steps:
1. Follow the above Steps 1 and 2.
2. Enter the DMS measure.
The next section tells you how to insert the symbols for
degrees, minutes, and seconds.
3. Press Õ to convert the DMS entry to degrees. 
This is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3-5.
Entering angles in DMS measure
To enter an angle in DMS measure:
1. Enter the number of degrees and press yå¿ to
insert the degree symbol. (On the TI-83, press
yé¿.)
2. Enter the number of minutes and press yå¡ to
insert the symbol for minutes. (On the TI-83, press
yé¡.)
3. Enter the number of seconds and press Éj to insert
the symbol for seconds. 
This is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3-5.
Overriding the mode of the angle
If the calculator is in Radian mode but you want to enter an angle
in degrees, enter the number of degrees and then press yå¿
to insert in the ° degree symbol. (On the TI-83, press yé¿.)
If you want to enter an angle in DMS measure while the calculator
is in Radian mode, the previous section tells you how to do so.
(Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.)
If the calculator is in Degree mode and you want to enter an angle
in radian measure, enter the number of radians and then press
yå¬ to insert in the radian-measure symbol. (On the TI-83,
press yé¬.) If the radian measure is entered as an arith-
metical expression, such as π/4, be sure to surround it with paren-
theses before you insert the radian-measure symbol.

A
ll the arithmetic operations described in Chapter 2 apply to
complex numbers, provided the calculator is in Complex
mode. This mode is explained in this chapter, as well as how to
enter and do basic arithmetic with those complex numbers. The
Math menu, described in Chapter 3, has a submenu devoted to
complex numbers. How to use this submenu is also described in
this chapter.
Setting the Mode
The Mode menu is pictured in Figure 4-1. The second from the last
line of the Mode menu gives you three options: Real, a + bi, and
re^θi. The last two options are used when working with complex
numbers. The a + bi options tells the calculator to display complex
numbers in rectangular form, and the re^θi options tells it to dis-
play complex numbers in polar form.
Figure 4-1: Putting the calculator in Complex mode.

Select either a + bi or re^θi so the calculator knows you’re working
with complex numbers. The remaining menu items can be set as
they appear in Figure 4-1. (Setting the Mode, as well as an explana-
tion of the other options in this menu, can be found in Chapter 1.)
Using Complex Numbers
Independent of the mode setting, a + bi or re^θi, complex numbers
can be entered in the calculator in either a + bi rectangular form or
in re^θi polar form. You enter the imaginary number i in an expres-
sion by pressing yÀ; e is entered by pressing y•. Figures 4-2
and 4-5 show complex numbers entered (respectively) in rectangu-
lar form and in polar form.
If the calculator is in Radian mode, θ in the polar form of a complex
number is entered in radian measure; if the calculator is in Degree
mode, θ is entered in degrees. (The last section in Chapter 3 tells
you how to override the restriction on entering θ in degrees so you
can do so even when the calculator is in Radian mode.)
Chapter 2 tells you how to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
Although the figures in this chapter involve real-number arith-
metic, everything in that chapter can be used when doing complex-
number arithmetic — provided the calculator is in Complex mode,
as described in the previous section. An example of this appears in
Figure 4-2. (Remember, you can enter the imaginary number i into
an expression by pressing yÀ.)

Finding the conjugate 
of a complex number
The conj function evaluates the conjugate of the complex number
or arithmetic expression that follows the function. This number or
expression must be enclosed in parentheses. The calculator sup-
plies the opening parenthesis; you must supply the closing paren-
thesis. An example of using the conj function is illustrated in 
Figure 4-3.
Finding the real or imaginary part 
of a complex number
The real and imag functions find (respectively) the real and imagi-
nary parts of any complex number or arithmetic expression that
follows the function. This number or expression must be enclosed
in parentheses. The calculator supplies the opening parenthesis;
you must supply the closing parenthesis. An example of using the
imag function is illustrated in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3: Finding the conjugate and the imaginary part.
Finding the polar angle and modulus
(magnitude) of a complex number
The angle and abs functions respectively find the polar angle and
the magnitude (modulus) of the complex number or arithmetic
expression that follows the function. This number or expression
must be enclosed in parentheses. The calculator supplies the
opening parenthesis; you must supply the closing parenthesis. An
example of using these functions is illustrated in Figure 4-4.
Chapter 4: Dealing with Complex Numbers 43

The angle function gives the polar angle in radians if the calculator
is in Radian mode, or in degrees if the calculator is in Degree mode.
(Chapter 3 tells you how to convert between radians and degrees,
express a radian measure as a fractional multiple of π, and convert
degrees to degrees, minutes, and seconds.)
Figure 4-4: Finding the polar angle and modulus.
Converting between rectangular 
and polar form
The Rect function converts a complex number from polar form to
rectangular from. The polar form of the complex number must
come before the Rect function, as shown in the first picture in
Figure 4-5.
The Polar function converts a complex number from rectangular
form to polar from. The rectangular form of the complex number
must come before the Polar function. This is illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 4-5. This function won’t convert a real number to
polar form; instead, it returns the ERR: DATA TYPE error message.

T
he Equation Solver solves an equation for one variable given
the values of the other variables in the equation. The Solver is
capable of dealing only with real numbers and is capable of finding
only real-number solutions. 
Using the Equation Solver
The following lists the basic steps for using the Equation Solver. Each
of these steps is explained in detail below this list. If you have never
used the Equation Solver before, I suggest that you read the detailed
explanations for each step because the Equation Solver is a bit tricky.
After you have had experience using the Solver, you can refer back to
this list, if necessary, to refresh your memory on its use. 
1. If necessary, set the Mode for real-number arithmetic.
2. Enter a new equation (or edit the existing equation) in
the Equation Solver.
3. Assign values to all variables except the variable you’re
solving for.
4. Enter the bounds for the interval that contains 
the solution.
5. Enter a guess for the solution.
6. Press ÉÕ to solve the equation.

Step 1. Set the mode
Because the Equation Solver is equipped to deal only with real
numbers, press z and highlight all entries on the left. (To see
what I mean, refer to Figure 1-3 in Chapter 1).
Step 2. Enter or edit the 
equation to be solved
To enter a new equation in the Equation Solver, follow these steps:
1. Press ç) to access the Equation Solver from the 
Math menu.
When the Equation Solver appears, it looks like one of the
pictures in Figure 5-1. The first picture shows the Equation
Solver when no equation is stored in the Solver; the second
picture depicts the Solver and the equation currently
stored in it.

2. If your Equation Solver already contains an equation,
repeatedly press } until the screen titled EQUATION
SOLVER appears.
This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 5-2.

in the Solver.
Press }
Enter equation
Press Õ
Without an equation

Part II: Advanced Functions, Complex Numbers . . .

4. Enter the equation you want to solve.
The equation you enter must be set equal to zero and can
contain only real numbers. For example, if you want to
solve the area equation A = L*W, enter it as 0 = A – L*W or
as 0 = L*W – A (as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 5-2).
You can also use a function that you’ve entered in the 
Y= editor in the definition of your equation. For example, 
if Y1 = X – 1 in the Y= editor, you can enter 1/Y1 – 1 in the
Equation Solver to solve the equation 1/(x - 1) – 1 = 0. To
insert such a function into the equation, press ê~¿ to
access the Function menu, and then press the number of
the function you want to enter (as in the first picture in
Figure 5-2). The Y= editor is explained in Chapter 9.
5. Press Õ to enter the equation in the solver.
To edit an equation that is already entered in the Equation Solver,
follow these steps:
1. Follow the above Steps 1 and 2.
2. Edit the equation and press Õ when you’re finished.
Step 3. Assign values to variables
After you have entered an equation in the Equation Solver, the
values assigned to the variables in your equation are the values
that are currently stored in those variables in your calculator. This
is illustrated in the last picture in Figure 5-2. You must assign an
accurate value to all variables except the variable you’re solving
for. These values must be real numbers or arithmetic expressions
that simplify to real numbers. 
To assign a value to a variable, use ~|}Ü to place the cursor on
the number currently assigned to that variable and then key in the
new value. As you start to key in the new value, the old value is
erased. Press Õ when you’re finished entering the new value
(as illustrated in the first picture of Figure 5-3, where values are
assigned to variables A and W).
Step 4. Define the solution bounds
The bound variable at the bottom of the screen, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 5-3, is where you enter the bounds of the
Chapter 5: Solving Equations 47

interval containing the solution you’re seeking. The default setting
for this interval is [-1099, 1099], as is indicated by bound = {-1E99,
1E99}. 1E99 is 1099 in scientific notation. The ellipsis at the end of
the line containing this variable indicate that you have to repeat-
edly press ~ to see the rest of the line.
This default setting is more than sufficient for equations that have
a unique solution. So if your equation has a unique solution, you
don’t have to do anything with the value in the bound variable.
When the equation you’re solving has multiple solutions, it’s some-
times necessary to redefine the bound variable. Finding multiple
solutions is discussed in the last section of this chapter.
To redefine the bound variable:
1. Use ~|}Ü to place the cursor anywhere in the line
containing the bound variable.
2. Press ë to erase the current entry.
3. Press y£ to insert the left brace.
4. Enter the lower bound, press À, enter the upper bound,
and then press y§ to insert the right brace.
5. Press Õ to store the new setting in the bound variable.
Step 5. Guess a solution
Guess at a solution by assigning a value to the variable you’re solv-
ing for. Any value in the interval defined by the bound variable will
do. If your guess is close to the solution, the calculator quickly
solves the equation; if it’s not, it may take the calculator a while 
to solve the equation. (Assigning a value to a variable in the
Equation Solver is explained earlier in this chapter.)
If your equation has more than one solution, the calculator will
find the one closest to your guess. The section at the end of this
chapter tells you how to find the other solutions.
If the variable you’re solving for is assigned a value (guess) that
isn’t in the interval defined by the bound variable, then you get the
ERR: BAD GUESS error message.
Part II: Advanced Functions, Complex Numbers . . . 
48

Step 6. Solve the equation
To solve an equation, follow these steps:
1. Use ~|}Ü to place the cursor anywhere in the line that
contains the variable you’re solving for.
This procedure is shown in the second picture in 
Figure 5-3.
2. Press ÉÕ to solve the equation.
The third picture of Figure 5-3 shows this procedure; the
square indicator shown next to the L indicates that L is the
variable just solved for. The left – rt value that appears at
the bottom of this picture evaluates the two sides of the
equation (using the values assigned to the variables) and
displays the difference — that is, the accuracy of this solu-
tion. A left – rt value of zero indicates an exact solution.
Figure 5-4 shows a solution that is off by the very small
number –1 * 10-11.
If you get the ERR: NO SIGN CHNG error message when you attempt
to solve an equation using the Equation Solver, then the equation
has no real solutions in the interval defined by the bound variable.
Figure 5-3: Steps for solving an equation in the Equation Solver.
Finding Multiple Solutions
To find other solutions to an equation, first find one solution to the
equation by following Steps 1 through 6 in the first section of this
chapter. This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 5-4. 
Define variables

Chapter 5: Solving Equations 49

Then enter a new guess for the solution you’re seeking, or, in the
bound variable, enter the bounds of an interval that possibly con-
tains a different solution. In the second picture in Figure 5-4 a new
guess for the solution is entered. 
After making a new guess or after redefining the bound variable,
follow the steps in the previous section to find another solution to
the equation. The third picture in Figure 5-4 shows this procedure.

 5.120% annual rate, compounded monthly
 5.116% annual rate, compounded daily 
 5.115% annual rate, compounded continuously
When nominal rates (also called annual percentage rates) are com-
pounded at different frequencies (as are those just given), you can
compare them to each other only by converting them to effective
rates (the simple-interest equivalent of nominal rates).
Finding the effective rate
To find the effective rate given the nominal rate:
1. Set the second line of the Mode menu to Float.
When dealing with money, you usually set the second line
of the Mode menu to 2 so all numbers are rounded to two
decimal places. When you’re comparing interest rates,
however, you want to see as many decimal places as possi-
ble. You can do so by setting the second line to Float. (For
more about setting the Mode menu, see Chapter 1.)

2. Press å¿ to start the Finance application. (On the TI-
83, press yó.)
3. Repeatedly press Ü to move the indicator to the Eff com-
mand and press Õ.
4. Enter the nominal rate, press À, enter the number of
compounding periods per year, and press §Õ.
When interest is compounded continuously, it is com-
pounded an infinite number of times a year. But there is 
no way of entering infinity into the calculator. You can get
around this problem by entering a very large number, 
such as 1012, for the number of compounding periods. The
fastest way to enter this number is to press yÀ and then
enter the number 12.
Figure 6-1 illustrates this procedure; it also shows that the
answer to the question posed at the beginning of this sec-
tion is 5.116%, compounded daily (the choice that gives
you the largest effective rate).
You can easily use the same command over and over (as in Figure
6-1), if (after using the command the first time) you press yÕ
to recopy the command to the next line on the screen. Then edit
the entries in the command and press Õ to execute the com-
mand. (Editing is explained in Chapter 1.)
Figure 6-1: Finding the effective rate.
Finding the nominal rate
The steps that convert an effective rate to a nominal rate are simi-
lar to those listed in the previous section. To begin, you follow the
first two of those steps — and then (in Step 3), select the Nom
command instead of the Eff command. In Step 4, you enter the
effective rate (after the comma, enter the number of compounding
periods for the nominal rate).

Chapter 6: Finding the Best Deal 55
Leasing versus Borrowing
Suppose you’re planning to purchase a $2,000 laptop. Which of the
following approaches can give you the better deal?
 Lease the laptop for $600 a year for four years with the option
to buy the laptop after four years for an additional $300.
 Take out a four-year loan at 12% simple interest.
The internal rate of return is the yearly simple interest rate that you
earn on an investment plan. In the context of a lease, the internal
rate of return is the yearly simple interest rate you would pay if the
lease were converted to a loan. So to find the better deal, you must
compare the lease’s internal rate of return to 12% (the loan’s inter-
nal rate of return).
To find the lease’s internal rate of return:
1. Select the irr command from the Finance application
menu.
To do so, follow the first two steps in the previous section
(“Finding the Effective Rate”) — but in Step 3, select the irr
command instead of the Eff command.
2. Enter the initial cash flow and press À.
For the leasing program described at the beginning of this
section (for example), the initial cash flow is the $2,000
price of the laptop. The sidebar in at the end of this chap-
ter explains why this value is positive even though the cash
is flowing away from you.
3. Enter the cash-flow list and press À.
In the leasing-program scenario, the cash flow indicates
what you paid per year to lease the laptop: $600 a year for
the first three years, and $900 in the fourth year (that is,
$600 to lease it and then $300 to purchase it). So the cash-
flow list is {-600, -900}. (Don’t worry: The sidebar at the end
of this chapter explains why these values must be nega-
tive.) You enter the frequencies for this list in the next step.
Enter the cash-flow list as a list contained within braces,
using commas to separate the elements in the list (as in
Figure 6-2). You enter the braces into the calculator by
pressing y£ and y§. (Remember to use the Ã key to
indicate that a number is negative.)

Part III: Dealing with Finances 
56
4. Enter the cash-flow frequency list.
The cash-flow frequency list indicates how frequently each
element (in this case, each specific amount) occurs in the
cash-flow list. In the leasing-program scenario, the cash-
flow frequency list is {3, 1} because $600 was paid for the
first three years and $900 was paid in the fourth year.
Figure 6-2 shows this case.
5. Press §Õ to calculate the internal rate of return.
This procedure is illustrated in Figure 6-2. This figure also
shows the answer to the question posed at the beginning of
this section: You’re better off taking out the loan at 12%
simple interest because leasing the laptop is equivalent to
a 12.29% loan.
Figure 6-2: Finding the internal rate of return.
When is cash flow negative?
Cash flow is the money that changes hands. The calculator does not know who is
involved in this exchange, so it requires that you indicate which way the money is
going by using a positive or negative value for cash flow. Figuring out which sign you
should use isn’t always easy.
The best way to figure out which sign to use is to ask yourself whether the money
is going into your pocket or coming out of your pocket. If it is going into your pocket,
then you have more, so the cash flow is positive. If it is coming out of your pocket,
then you have less, so it’s negative.
For example, if you put $2,000 in a savings account, that’s a negative cash flow
because it came out of your pocket and went to the bank. It’s still your money, but
it’s no longer in your pocket.
On the other hand, if you take out a $2,000 loan, then that’s a positive cash flow
because the bank has given you the money. In your mind, it’s negative because you
have to pay it off. But to the calculator, it’s positive because now you have the money.

ou have a 30-year, $200,000 mortgage on your house. The
mortgage rate is 7%, compounded monthly.
 What are your monthly mortgage payments?
 What is the total cost of the loan?
 How much of your first payment is devoted to paying off the
balance of the loan?
 How much of the loan was paid off during the second year?
 How much interest do you pay during the life of the loan?
 How much do you still owe on the house after 20 years?
This chapter shows you how to get the calculator to answer these
and other, similar questions.
Using the TVM Solver
The TVM (time-value-of-money) Solver can be used to answer
questions like those posed at the beginning of this chapter. In fact,
if you tell the TVM Solver any four of the following five variables, it
will figure out the fifth variable for you:
 N: Total number of payments
 %: Annual interest rate

 PV: Present value
 PMT: Amount of each payment
 FV: Future value
To get the calculator to find these answers, follow these steps:
1. Set the second line in the Mode menu to 2.
This setting makes the calculator round all numbers to two
decimal places, the standard format for money. (Setting the
Mode menu is described in Chapter 1.)
2. Press å¿¿ to select the TVM Solver from the Finance
application menu. (On the TI-83, press yó¿.)
3. Enter values for four of the first five variables listed in
the TVM Solver. Press Õ after making each entry.
Some values that are entered in the TVM Solver must be
entered as negative numbers. For an explanation of when
you have to do this, see Chapter 6.
This step is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 7-1. In
this figure, the TVM Solver is set up to solve the first ques-
tion asked at the beginning of this chapter. 
Don’t worry about any value currently assigned by the cal-
culator to the variable that the TVM Solver is going to find
for you. In this example, that variable is PMT, the monthly
payment.
For a loan, the present value is always the amount of 
the loan; the future value, after the loan is paid off, is 
(naturally) 0.
You can enter arithmetic problems as values in the TVM
Solver. The calculator will do the arithmetic after you
press Õ. For example, in the first picture in Figure 7-1, N
was entered as 30*12.
4. Enter values for P/Y and C/Y. Press Õ after making
each entry.
• P/Y is the number of payments made each year.
• C/Y is the number of times interest is compounded 
each year.
Part III: Dealing with Finances 
58

The calculator assumes these two values are the same. So
after you enter the value for P/Y and press Õ, the same
value is assigned to the variable C/Y. (If the values are not
the same in the scenario for which you’re using the TVM
Solver, enter the correct value for C/Y. As an example, if
you’re making monthly payments but the interest rate is a
simple interest rate, then P/Y = 12 and C/Y = 1.)
If interest is compounded continuously, it is compounded an
infinite number of times a year. But there is no way of enter-
ing infinity into the calculator. You can get around this prob-
lem by setting C/Y equal to a large number, such as 1012.
5. In the last line, indicate whether payments are made at
the beginning or the end of the payment period.
To do so, use ~| to place the cursor on the appropriate
entry, either END or BEGIN, and press Õ.
6. Place the cursor on the variable for which you want to
solve.
This operation is shown in the second picture in Figure 7-1.
In this figure the calculator is told to solve for PMT, the
monthly payment.
7. Press ÉÕ to solve for the variable.
The calculator places a square next to the variable it just
found. This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 7-1. 
See the sidebar in Chapter 6 for an explanation of why PMT
is negative in the last picture in Figure 7-1.

Using a TVM Value
After you’ve assigned values to all variables in the TVM Solver (as
explained in the previous section), you can paste these values into
other expressions by pressing å¿~ and entering the number
of the variable you want to use. (On the TI-83, press yó~.)
An example of this use appears in Figure 7-2. Also, this figure
answers the question (What is the total cost of the loan?) posed at
the beginning of this chapter. Notice that this calculation was done
on the Home screen. To get from the TVM Solver to the Home
screen, press yz.
Figure 7-2: Using a TVM variable in a calculation.
Finding Principal and Interest
Use the ΣPrn and ΣInt commands to compute the principal and
interest paid on a loan during a specified time period. To use these
commands, follow these steps:
1. Assign values to all variables in the TVM Solver.
This chapter’s “Using the TVM Solver” section tells you
how.
2. Press yz to enter the Home screen.
3. Press å¿ to access the Finance application menu. (On
the TI-83, press yó.)
4. Repeatedly press Ü to select ΣPrn or ΣInt and press
Õ.
5. Enter the number of the first payment in the specified
time period, press À, enter the number of the last pay-
ment in the time period, press §, and then press Õ to
display the result.

This process is illustrated in Figure 7-3 (where you can also
see answers to the third, fourth, and fifth questions posed
at the beginning of this chapter).
Figure 7-3: Evaluating cumulative principal and interest payments. 
Finding the Balance
Use the bal command to compute the balance of a loan after a
specified time period. To use this command, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the previous section.
2. Repeatedly press Ü to select the bal command and press
Õ.
3. Enter the number of payments in the specified time
period.
You may find the “How Many Days Till Christmas?” sidebar
in the next chapter useful for calculating the number of
payments in a specified time period.
You can enter the number of payments in the bal command
as an arithmetic expression, as in Figure 7-4.
4. Press §Õ to display the result.
This procedure is shown in Figure 7-4. (This figure answers
the last question posed at the beginning of this chapter.)

Understanding round-off errors
Do you see a problem with the results the calculator gave in Figures 7-2 and 7-3?
According to Figure 7-2, the total cost of the house in the scenario posed at the
beginning of this chapter is $479,017.80. According to Figure 7-3, however, the total
cost is $479,021.94 (total interest plus the $200,000 mortgage). That’s a difference of
$4.14! The differences in these calculations are caused by 30 years worth of round-
off errors. 
In Figure 7-1, the calculator rounded the monthly payments to $1,330.60. But if you
had put the calculator in Float mode, the calculator would have told you that the
monthly payments are $1,330.60499. When the calculator uses this value to evalu-
ate other entities, it uses an even better approximation than this one. But it’s still
using an approximation, so expect round-off errors.
The mortgage lender would avoid this problem by charging $1,330.61 a month for
all but the last month.

ay you’re investing money in an account that earns 6% inter-
est, compounded continuously.
 If you invest $50,000 now and then add $1,000 to the account
each month, how many years will it take for the account to
reach $1,000,000?
 If you invest $50,000 now and then add $1,000 to the account
each month, how much money will you have after 30 years?
 How much should you invest now so that the account will be
worth at least $1,000,000 in 30 years?
The TVM (time-value-of-money) Solver can be used to answer
questions like those posed above. 
Reaching Financial Goals
You can use the TVM Solver to determine how long to leave money
in a savings or investment account to reach a specified financial
goal. Chapter 7 provides the steps for using the TVM Solver; here
are some pointers you may want to use as you follow those steps:
 N (number of payments):
This is the variable you’re solving for. So in Step 4, assign
values to all variables except N.

Part III: Dealing with Finances 
64
 PMT (amount of payment) and P/Y (payments per year):
If you put money into an account and just leave it there with-
out adding to it, then PMT is 0. And because you’re not
making any payments, you can set P/Y to 1. This will tell the
calculator to evaluate N in years.
On the other hand, if you add to the account on a regular
basis, then PMT is the value of these regular additions to the
account and P/Y is the number of times a year these additions
to the account are made. This is illustrated in the first picture
in Figure 8-1. In this picture, the TVM Solver is solving the first
question posed at the beginning of this chapter.
 After you have solved for N in Step 8:
If P/Y is 1, then the solution for N is in years. If P/Y isn’t 1,
then N is the total number of payments made. Because P/Y
payments are made each year, the number of years it takes to
reach your financial goal is N divided by P/Y. Chapter 7
explains how to use a TVM value, in particular, how to use
these variables in a calculation (as shown in the second pic-
ture in Figure 8-1).
Figure 8-1: Solving for the time needed to reach a financial goal.
Finding Future Value of Money
In the context of a savings or investment account, the future value
of your money is the amount of money in the account after a speci-
fied time period. The second question posed at the beginning of
this chapter is asking for the future value of the account.
To find the future value, follow the steps given in Chapter 7 for
using the TVM Solver. Here are some pointers you may want to use:
 FV (future value):
This is the variable you’re solving for. So in Step 4, you have
to assign values to all variables except FV.
Finding N
Converting N to years

 PMT (amount of payment) and P/Y (payments per year):
If necessary, read the comments made about PMT and P/Y in
the previous section.
 N (number of payments):
N is the number of years you have the account times P/Y.
Figure 8-2 illustrates using the TVM Solver to answer the second
question posed at the beginning of this chapter.
Figure 8-2: Finding the future value of money.
Finding Present Value of Money
In the context of a savings or investment account, the present value
of money is the amount needed to generate a specific amount of
money after a specified time period. The third question posed at
the beginning of this chapter asks for the present value of an
account.
To find the present value, follow the steps given in Chapter 7 for
using the TVM Solver. Here are some pointers you may want to use:
 PV (present value):
This is the variable you’re solving for. Accordingly, in Step 4,
assign values to all variables except PV.
 FV (future value):
This is the amount of money you want to have in the account
after the specified time period.
 PMT (amount of payment) and P/Y (payments per year):
If necessary, read the comments made about PMT and P/Y in
the section titled “Reaching Financial Goals.”
 N (number of payments):
N is the number of years you have the account times P/Y.

How many days till Christmas?
To calculate the number of days between two dates:
1. Press å¿Éó to select the dbd command from the Finance appli-
cation menu. (On the TI-83, press yóÉó.)
2. Enter the first date using either the mm.ddyy or the ddmm.yy format.
In both formats, mm is the two-digit number of the month, dd is the two-digit
number of the day of the month, and yy is the last two digits of the year. The
date must fall somewhere in the range of years from 1950 through 2049.
In the U.S.-format mm.ddyy, mm and ddyy are separated by a period; there is no
separation between dd and yy. For example, March 5, 2004, is entered as
03.0504. In the European-format ddmm.yy, this date is entered as 0503.04.
3. Press À, enter the second date, and then press §.
4. Press Õ to display the number of days between the two dates.
Using the U.S. date format, the figure given here shows that there are 295 days
between March 5, 2004, and Christmas of the same year.

T
he calculator has a variety of features that help you painlessly
graph a function. The first step is to enter the function into the
calculator. Then to graph the function, you set the viewing window
and press s. Or (better yet) you can use one of several Zoom
commands to get the calculator to set the viewing window for you.
Finally, after you have graphed the function, you can use Zoom
commands to change the look of the graph. For example, you can
zoom in or zoom out on a graph the same way that a zoom lens on
a camera lets you zoom in or out on the picture you’re taking.
Entering Functions
Before you can graph a function, you must enter it into the calcula-
tor. The calculator can handle up to ten functions at once, Y1
through Y9 and Y0. To enter functions in the calculator, perform the
following steps:
1. Press z and put the calculator in Function mode, as
shown in Figure 9-1.
To highlight an item in the Mode menu, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the item, and then press Õ.
Highlight Func in the fourth line to put the calculator in
Function mode. (For more about the other items on the
Mode menu, refer to Chapter 1.)

Figure 9-1: Setting Function mode.
2. Press o to access the Y= editor.
3. Enter the definitions of your functions:
To erase an entry that appears after Yn, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor to the right of the equal sign and
press ë. Then enter your definition for the new func-
tion and press Õ.
When you’re defining functions, the only symbol the calculator
allows for the independent variable is the letter X. Press Ñ to
enter this letter in the definition of your function. In Figure 9-2, this
key was used to enter the functions Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and Y6.
As a timesaver, when entering functions in the Y= editor, you can
reference another function in its definition. (Figure 9-2, for exam-
ple, shows function Y3 defined as –Y2.) To paste a function name in
the function you’re entering in the Y= editor, follow these steps:
1. Press ê~ to access the Y-Variables menu.
2. Press ¿ to access the Function menu.
3. Press the number key for the name of the function you
want to paste in the definition.
Figure 9-2: Examples of entering functions.
Graphing Functions
Here’s where your calculator draws pretty pictures. After you have
entered the functions into the calculator, as described in the previ-
ous section, you can use the following steps to graph the functions:
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
70

1. Turn off any Stat Plots that you don’t want to appear in
the graph of your functions.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status
of the Stat Plots. (Stat Plots are discussed in Chapter 19.) If
Plot1, Plot2, or Plot3 is highlighted, then that Stat Plot will
be graphed along with the graph of your functions. If it’s
not highlighted, it won’t be graphed. In Figure 9-2, Plot1 will
be graphed along with the functions.
To turn off a highlighted Stat Plot in the Y= editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the highlighted Stat
Plot and then press Õ. The same process is used to re-
highlight the Stat Plot in order to graph it at a later time.
When you’re graphing functions, Stat Plots can cause prob-
lems if they’re turned on when you don’t really want them
to be graphed. The most common symptom of this prob-
lem is the ERR: INVALID DIM error message — which by
itself gives you almost no insight into what’s causing the
problem. So if you aren’t planning to graph a Stat Plot along
with your functions, make sure all Stat Plots are turned off.
2. Press yq to access the Format menu.
3. Set the format for the graph by using the ~|}Ü keys to
place the cursor on the desired format and then press
Õ to highlight it.
In the Format menu, each line of the menu will have one item
highlighted. An explanation of each menu selection follows:
• RectGC and PolarGC: This gives you a choice between
having the coordinates of the location of the cursor 
displayed in (x, y) rectangular form or in (r, θ) polar
form. Select RectGC for rectangular form or PolarGC
for polar form.
• CoordOn and CoordOff: This tells the calculator
whether you want to see the coordinates of the cursor
location displayed at the bottom of the screen as you
move the cursor. Select CoordOn if you want to see
these coordinates; select CoordOff if you don’t.
• GridOff and GridOn: If you select GridOn, grid points
appear in the graph at the intersections of the tick
marks on the x- and y-axes (as illustrated in Figure 9-3). If
you select GridOff, no grid points appear in the graph.
• AxesOn and AxesOff: If you want to see the x- and 
y-axes on your graph, select AxesOn. If you don’t want
to see them, select AxesOff.
Chapter 9: Graphing Functions 71

• LabelOff and LabelOn: If you want the x- and y-axes to
be labeled, select LabelOn (as in Figure 9-3). Because
the location of the labels isn’t ideal, selecting LabelOff is
usually a wise choice.
Figure 9-3: A graph with grid points and labeled axes.
• ExprOn and ExprOff: If you select ExprOn, when you’re
tracing the graph of a function, the definition of that func-
tion appears in the upper left of the screen. If you select
ExprOff and CoordOn, then only the number of the func-
tion appears when you trace the function. If you select
ExprOff and CoordOff, then nothing at all appears on
the screen to indicate which function you’re tracing.
4. Press p to access the Window editor. 
5. After each of the window variables, enter a numerical
value that is appropriate for the functions you’re graph-
ing. Press Õ after entering each number.
Figure 9-4 pictures the Window editor when the calculator
is in Function mode. The items in this menu determine the
viewing window for your graph — in particular, how the x-
and y-axes look on the screen. The following gives an expla-
nation of the variables you must set in this editor:
• Xmin and Xmax: These are, respectively, the smallest
and largest values of x in view on the x-axis.
If you don’t know what values your graph will need for
Xmin and Xmax, press q] to invoke the ZStandard
command. This command automatically graphs your
functions in the Standard viewing window; the settings
for this window appear in Figure 9-4. You can then, if
necessary, use the other Zoom commands (described in
Chapter 10) to get a better picture of your graph.
• Xscl: This is the distance between tick marks on the 
x-axis. (Go easy on the tick marks; using too many makes
the axis look like a railroad track. Twenty or fewer tick
marks makes for a nice looking axis.)
• Ymin and Ymax: These are, respectively, the smallest
and largest values of y that will be placed on the y-axis.
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
72

If you have assigned values to Xmin and Xmax but don’t
know what values to assign to Ymin and Ymax, press
q) to invoke the ZoomFit command. This command
uses the Xmin and Xmax settings to determine the
appropriate settings for Ymin and Ymax and then auto-
matically draws the graph. It does not change the Yscl
setting. (You must return to the Window editor, if neces-
sary, to adjust this setting yourself.)
• Yscl: This is the distance between tick marks on the 
y-axis. (As with the x-axis, too many tick marks make the
axis look like a railroad track. Fifteen or fewer tick marks
is a nice number for the y-axis.)
• Xres: This setting determines the resolution of the
graph. It can be set to any of the integers 1 through 8.
When Xres is set equal to 1, the calculator evaluates the
function at each of the 94 pixels on the x-axis and graphs
the result. If Xres is set equal to 8, the function is evalu-
ated and graphed at every eighth pixel.
Xres is usually set equal to 1. If you’re graphing a lot of
functions, it may take the calculator a while to graph
them at this resolution, but if you change Xres to a
higher number, you may not get an accurate graph. 
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your
functions, and this causes you to regret setting Xres
equal to 1, press … to terminate the graphing process.
You can then go back to the Window editor and adjust
the Xres setting to a higher number.
6. Press s to graph the functions.
Figure 9-4: Window editor in Function mode.
Graphing Several Functions
If you’re graphing several functions at once, it’s not easy to deter-
mine which graph each function is responsible for. To help clear
this up, the calculator allows you to identify the graphs of functions
by setting a different graph style for each function. To do this:
Chapter 9: Graphing Functions 73

1. Press o to access the Y= editor.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the icon
appearing at the far left of the definition of the function.
3. Repeatedly press Õ until you get the desired 
graph style.
You have seven styles to choose from: Á (Line), Ë (Thick
Line), È (shading above the curve), Í (shading below the
curve), Î (Path), Ï (Animate), and Ì (Dotted Line). Each
time you press Õ, you get a different style. 
• Line, Thick Line, and Dotted Line styles: In Figure 9-2,
Y1is set to the default line style. Y2 and Y3are set to Thick
Line style; and Y6 is set to Dotted Line style. Figure 9-5
illustrates these styles.
Figure 9-5: Line style, Thick Line style, and Dotted Line style.
• Shading above and below the curve styles: In Figure 9-2,
Y4 is set to the shading above the curve style and Y5 is
set to the shading below the curve style. The calculator
has four shading patterns: vertical lines, horizontal lines,
negatively sloping diagonal lines, and positively sloping
diagonal lines. You don’t get to select the shading pat-
tern. If you’re graphing only one function in this style, the
calculator uses the vertical line pattern. If you’re graph-
ing two functions, the first is graphed in the vertical line
pattern and the second in the horizontal line pattern. If
you graph three functions in this style, the third appears
in the negatively sloping diagonal lines pattern, and so
on (as illustrated in Figure 9-6). For custom shading (as
pictured in Figure 9-7), see the explanation in Chapter 12.
Chapter 12 explains how to do custom shading. An
example appears in Figure 9-7.
• Path and Animated styles: The Path style, denoted by
the Î icon, uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s being
graphed (as illustrated in Figure 9-8). When the graph is
complete, the circle disappears and leaves the graph in
Line style.
Line
Thick Line
Dotted Line
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
74

Figure 9-6: Shading above the curve, shading below the curve, and two 
shaded functions.
The animate style, denoted by the Ï icon, also uses a
circle to indicate a point as it’s being graphed, but 
when the graph is complete, no graph appears on the
screen. For example, if this style is used, graphing 
y = -x2 + 9 looks like a movie of the path of a ball thrown
in the air.
Figure 9-7: Custom shading. 
If you don’t want the calculator to graph a function in the 
Y= editor, un-highlight the equal sign in that function. To graph 
it at a later time, re-highlight the equal sign. This is done in the 
Y= editor by using the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the
equal sign in the definition of the function and then pressing Õ
to toggle the equal sign between highlighted and un-highlighted. In
the example in Figure 9-2, the calculator won’t graph functions Y2
through Y6.

Is Your Graph Accurate?
The calculator can do only what you tell it to do — which doesn’t
always produce an accurate graph. The three main causes of inac-
curate graphs, and their solutions, are the following:
 The graph is distorted by the size of the screen.
Because the calculator screen isn’t square, circles don’t look
like circles unless the viewing window is properly set. How 
do you properly set the viewing window? No problem! Just
graph the function as described earlier in this chapter, and
then press qY to invoke the ZSquare command. ZSquare
readjusts the window settings for you and re-graphs the func-
tion in a viewing window in which circles look like circles.
Figure 9-9 illustrates this. (The circle being drawn in each of
these figures is the circle defined by Y2 and Y3, as shown in
Figure 9-2.)
Figure 9-9: A circle graphed using ZStandard and then using ZSquare.
 The viewing window is too small or too big.
If you don’t know what the graph should look like, then after
graphing it you should zoom out to see more of the graph or
zoom in to see a smaller portion of the graph. To do this,
press q¬ to zoom out, or press q¡ to zoom in. 
Then use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the point
from which you want to zoom out or in, and press Õ. It’s
just like using a camera. The point you want to move the
cursor to is the focal point.
After zooming in or out, you may have to adjust the window
settings, as described earlier in this chapter.
As an example, Figure 9-10 shows the progression of graphing
Y1 in Figure 9-2. It was first graphed in the Standard viewing
window. Then it was zoomed out from the point (0, 10). And
finally, the window settings were adjusted to get a better pic-
ture of the graph.
ZStandard
ZSquare
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
76

Figure 9-10: A graph using ZStandard, then Zoom Out, and then an adjusted
viewing window.
 Vertical asymptotes may not be recognizable.
In all graph styles except Animate and Dotted Line, the calcu-
lator graphs one point, and then the next point, and connects
those two points with a line segment. This sometimes causes
vertical asymptotes to appear on the graph. The last graph in
Figure 9-10 illustrates an example of when a vertical asymp-
tote is present. Don’t mistake this almost-vertical line for a
part of the graph. It’s not; it’s just a vertical asymptote.
In a different viewing window, the vertical asymptote may not
even appear. This happens when the calculator graphs one
point, but the next point is undefined because the x value of
that point is exactly at the location of the vertical asymptote.
Figure 9-11 gives an example of re-graphing the last graph
shown in Figure 9-10, using a viewing window in which the
vertical asymptote does not appear.
If you want to ensure that vertical asymptotes don’t appear
on your graph, graph the function in the Dotted Line style
described in the previous section. For an explanation of how
you can draw a vertical asymptote on a graph, see Chapter 12.
Figure 9-11: A viewing window in which no vertical asymptotes appear.
Piecewise-Defined Functions
When graphing a piecewise-defined function, some people cop out
and simply graph each of the separate functions that appear in it. But
ZStandard

this does not result in an accurate graph. To accurately graph the fol-

1. Enter the functions Y1, Y2, and Y3 in the Y= editor.
Entering functions in the Y= editor is explained earlier in
the chapter. Examples of three such functions appear in
Figure 9-12.
2. Turn off Y1, Y2, and Y3 by un-highlighting their equal signs.
This is done in the Y= editor by using the ~|}Ü keys to
place the cursor on the equal sign in the definition of the
function and then pressing Õ to toggle the equal sign
between highlighted and un-highlighted. The calculator
graphs a function only when its equal sign is highlighted.
An example of this appears in Figure 9-12.
3. Enter the piecewise-defined function in Y4 as
(Y1)(x < a) + (Y2)(a ≤x)(x ≤b) + (Y3)(x > b).
The function must be entered as it appears above, com-
plete with parentheses. (Y1)(x < a) tells the calculator to
graph the function Y1 for x < a and (Y2)(a ≤x)(x ≤b) tells it
to graph Y2 for a ≤x ≤b. 
• To enter Y1, Y2, and Y3: Press ê~¿ and then 
press the number of the function you want to use in 
the definition. 
• To enter the inequalities: Press yç to access the
Test menu, and then press the number of the inequality
you want to use in the definition. For example, to enter
the less-than (<) symbol, press yçY.
An example of entering this function appears in Figure 9-12. 
4. Press Õ.
5. Graph the piecewise-defined function.
An earlier section of this chapter explains how to graph
functions. An example graph of a piecewise-defined func-
tion appears in Figure 9-12. 
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
78

Figure 9-12: Defining and graphing a piecewise-defined function.
Graphing Trig Functions
The calculator has built-in features especially designed for graph-
ing trigonometric functions. They produce graphs that look like
graphs you see in text books; and when you trace these graphs,
the x-coordinate of the tracing point is always given as a fractional
multiple of π. To use these features when graphing trigonometric
functions, follow these steps:
1. Put the calculator in Function and Radian mode.
Press z. In the third line, highlight Radian, and in the
fourth highlight Func. (To highlight an item in the Mode
menu, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the
item, and then press Õ.)
2. Enter your trigonometric functions into the Y= editor.
Entering functions in the Y= editor is explained earlier in
the chapter.
3. Press q¨ to graph the function.
q¨ invokes the ZTrig command which graphs the
function in a viewing window in which –47π/24 ≤x ≤47π/24
and –4 ≤y ≤4. It also sets the tick marks on the x-axis to
multiples of π/2.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZTrig window, the
x-coordinate of the trace cursor will be a multiple of π/24.
(Tracing is explained in the next chapter.)
Viewing the Function and Graph
on the Same Screen
If you’re planning to play around with the definition of a function
you’re graphing, it’s quite handy to have both the Y= editor and
Graph
Definition
Chapter 9: Graphing Functions 79

the graph on the same screen. That way you can edit the definition
of your function and see the effect your editing has on your graph.
To do so, follow these steps:
1. Put the calculator in Horizontal mode.
Press z and highlight Horiz in the last line of the menu,
as illustrated in Figure 9-13. To highlight an item in the
Mode menu, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on
the item, and then press Õ.
2. Press o.
The Graph window appears at the top of the screen and the
Y= editor at the bottom of the screen.
3. Enter or edit a function in the Y= editor.
Entering functions in the Y= editor is explained earlier in
this chapter. Editing expressions is explained in Chapter 1.
4. Graph the function.
Graphing functions is explained earlier in this chapter.
To edit or enter a function, press o. To see the resulting graph,
press s.

Saving and Recalling a Graph
If you want to save just a picture of your graph, see Chapter 12.
However, remember that pictures of graphs are not interactive.
You cannot, for example, trace them or resize the viewing window.
All you can do is look at them.
On the other hand, if you want your recalled graph to be interac-
tive, save it as a Graph Database. This way the calculator saves the
Graph Mode, Window, Format, and Y= editor settings. It does not,
however, save the split-screen settings (Horiz and G-T) entered in
the last line of the Mode menu. Here’s how to save, delete, and
recall a graph in a Graph Database:
Split screen
Mode
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions

Chapter 9: Graphing Functions 81
To save a Graph Database, perform the following steps:
1. Press yè~~ to access the Draw Store menu.
2. Press ¬ to store your graph as a Graph Database.
3. Enter an integer 0 through 9.
The calculator can store up to 10 Graph Databases. If, for
example, you enter the number 5, your Graph Database is
stored in the calculator as GDB5.
If you save your Graph Database as GDB5 without realizing
that you had previously stored another Graph Database as
GDB5, the calculator — without warning or asking your
permission — erases the old GDB5 and replaces it with the
new GDB5. To see a list of the Graph Databases already
stored in your calculator, press yj¡Æ. 
If you already have ten Graph Databases stored in your cal-
culator and don’t want to sacrifice any of them, consider
saving some of them on your PC. Chapter 22 describes how
to do this.
4. Press Õ.
To delete a Graph Database from your calculator, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Press yj to access the Memory menu.
2. Press ¡ to access the Mem Mgt/Del menu.
3. Press Æ to access the GBD files stored in the calculator.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press Ü to move the indicator to
the GBD you want to delete.
5. Press {.
If there is more than one Graph Database stored in your
calculator, you are asked whether or not you really want to
delete this item. Press ¡ if you want it deleted, or press ¿
if you have changed your mind about deleting it.
6. Press yz to exit this menu and return to the 
home screen.
To recall a saved Graph Database, perform the following steps: 
1. Press yè~~ to access the Draw Store menu.
2. Press W to recall your Graph Database.

3. Enter the number of your stored Graph Database.
4. Press Õ.
When you recall a Graph Database, the Mode, Window,
Format, and Y= editor settings in your calculator change to
those saved in the Graph Database. If you don’t want to
lose the settings you have in the calculator, save them in
another Graph Database before recalling your saved Graph
Database. (Saving a Graph Database is described earlier in
this section.)

 Using Zoom commands

 Constructing tables of functional values
 Creating and clearing user-defined tables
 Viewing graphs and tables on the same screen
T
he calculator has three very useful features that help you
explore the graph of a function: zooming, tracing, and creating
tables of functional values. Zooming allows you to quickly adjust
the viewing window for the graph so that you can get a better idea
of the nature of the graph. Tracing shows you the coordinates of
the points that make up the graph. And creating a table — well, I’m
sure you already know what that shows you. The following sec-
tions explain how to use each of these features.
Using Zoom Commands
After you’ve graphed your functions (as described in Chapter 9),
you can use Zoom commands to adjust the view of your graph.
Press q to see the ten Zoom commands that you can use. The
following list explains the Zoom commands and how to use them:
 Zoom commands that help you to initially graph or regraph
your function in a preset viewing window:
• ZStandard: This command graphs your function in a
preset viewing window where –10 ≤x ≤10 and –10 ≤y ≤
10. You access it by pressing q].
This is a nice Zoom command to use when you haven’t
the slightest idea what size viewing window to use 
for your function. After graphing the function using
ZStandard, you can, if necessary, use the Zoom In and

Zoom Out commands to get a better idea of the nature
of the graph. Using Zoom In and Zoom Out are
described later in this section.
• ZDecimal: This command graphs your function in a
preset viewing window where –4.7 ≤x ≤4.7 and –3.1 ≤
y ≤3.1.It is accessed by pressing qW.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZDecimal
window, the x-coordinate of the trace cursor will be a
multiple of 0.1. Tracing is explained in the next section.
• ZTrig: This command, which is most useful when graph-
ing trigonometric functions, graphs your function in a
preset viewing window where –47π/24 ≤x ≤47π/24 and
–4 ≤y ≤4. It also sets the tick marks on the x-axis to mul-
tiples of π/2. You access ZTrig by pressing q¨.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZTrig window,
the x-coordinate of the trace cursor will be a multiple of
π/24. Tracing is explained in the next section.
To use the zoom commands described above, enter your func-
tion into the calculator (as described in Chapter 9), press
q, and then press the key for the number of the command.
The graph automatically appears.
 Zoom commands that help you find an appropriate viewing
window for the graph of your functions:
• ZoomFit: This is my favorite Zoom command. If you
know how you want to set the x-axis, ZoomFit automati-
cally figures out the appropriate settings for the y-axis.
To use ZoomFit, press p and enter the values you
want for Xmin, Xmax, and Xscl. Then press q) to
get ZoomFit to figure out the y-settings and graph your
function. ZoomFit does not figure out an appropriate
setting for Yscl, so you may want to go back to the
Window editor and adjust this value. The Window editor
is discussed in Chapter 9.
• ZoomStat: If you’re graphing functions, this command is
useless. But if you’re graphing Stat Plots (as explained in
Chapter 19), this command finds the appropriate view-
ing window for your plots. See Chapter 18 for informa-
tion on how this works.
 Zoom commands that readjust the viewing window of an
already-graphed function:
• ZSquare: Because the calculator screen isn’t perfectly
square, graphed circles won’t look like real circles
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
84

unless the viewing window is properly set. ZSquare
readjusts the existing Window settings for you and then
regraphs the function in a viewing window in which cir-
cles look like circles.
To use ZSquare, graph the function as described in
Chapter 9, and then press qY. The graph automati-
cally appears.
• ZInteger: This command is quite useful when you want
the trace cursor to trace your functions using integer
values of the x-coordinate, such as when graphing a
function that defines a sequence. (Tracing is explained
in the next section.) ZInteger readjusts the existing
Window settings and regraphs the function in a viewing
window in which the trace cursor displays integer
values for the x-coordinate.
To use ZInteger, graph the function as described in
Chapter 9, and then press qR. Use the ~|}Ü keys
to move the cursor to the spot on the screen that will
become the center of the new screen. Then press Õ.
The graph is redrawn centered at the cursor location.
 Zoom commands that zoom in or zoom out from an already
graphed function.
• Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn (as
described in the previous chapter), these commands
allow you to zoom in on a portion of the graph or to
zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a
zoom lens on a camera.
Press q¡ to zoom in or press q¬ to zoom out.
Then use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the
spot on the screen from which you want to zoom in or
zoom out. Then press Õ. The graph is redrawn cen-
tered at the cursor location.
You can press Õ again to zoom in closer or to zoom
out one more time. Press ë when you’re finished
zooming in or zooming out. You may have to adjust the
window settings, as described earlier in the Chapter 9. 
• ZBox: This command allows you to define a new viewing
window for a portion of your graph by enclosing it in a
box, as illustrated in Figure 10-1. The box becomes the
new viewing window.
To construct the box, press q¿ and use the
~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the spot where you
want one corner of the box to be located. Press Õ to
anchor that corner of the box. Then use the ~|}Ü
Chapter 10: Exploring Functions 85

keys to construct the rest of the box. When you press
these keys, the calculator draws the sides of the box.
Press Õ when you’re finished drawing the box. The
graph is then redrawn in the window defined by your
box (as shown in Figure 10-1).
When you use ZBox, if you don’t like the size of the box you
get, you can use any of the ~|}Ü keys to resize the box. If
you don’t like the location of the corner you anchored, press
ë and start over.
When you use ZBox, Õ is pressed only two times. The first
time you press it’s to anchor a corner of the zoom box. The
next time you press Õ is when you’re finished drawing the
box, and are ready to have the calculator redraw the graph.
Figure 10-1: Constructing the Zoom Box and redrawing the graph.
Tracing a Graph
After you have graphed your function, as described in the previous
chapter, you can press r and then use ~ and | to more
closely investigate the function. 
If you use only the ~|}Ü keys instead of r to locate a point
on a graph, all you will get is an approximation of the location of
that point. You rarely get an actual point on the graph. So always
use r to identify points on a graph.
The following list describes what you see, or don’t see, as you
trace a graph:
 The definition of the function: The function you’re tracing is
displayed at the top of the screen, provided the calculator is
in ExprOn format, as discussed in Chapter 9. If the Format
menu is set to ExprOff and CoordOn, then the Y= editor
number of the function appears at the top right of the screen.
If the Format menu is set to ExprOff and CoordOff, then trac-
ing the graph is useless because all you see is a cursor moving
The box
Redrawn graph
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
86

on the graph. The calculator won’t tell you which function
you’re tracing, nor will it tell you the coordinates of the cursor
location. (The Format menu and Y= editor are described in
Chapter 9.)
If you’ve graphed more than one function and you would like
to trace a different function, press }. Each time you press this
key, the cursor jumps to another function. Eventually it jumps
back to the original function.
 The values of x and y: At the bottom of the screen you see
the values of the x- and y- coordinates that define the cursor
location, provided the calculator is in CoordOn format (as
discussed in Chapter 9). In the PolarGC format, the coordi-
nates of this point display in polar form.
When you press r, the cursor is placed on the graph at
the point having an x-coordinate that is approximately
midway between Xmin and Xmax. If the y-coordinate of the
cursor location isn’t between Ymin and Ymax, then the
cursor does not appear on the screen. The sidebar “Panning
in Function mode” tells you how to correct this situation.
Each time you press ~, the cursor moves right to the next
plotted point on the graph, and the coordinates of that point
are displayed at the bottom of the screen. If you press |, the
cursor moves left to the previously plotted point. And if you
press } to trace a different function, the tracing of that func-
tion starts at the point on the graph that has the x-coordinate
displayed on-screen before you pressed this key.
Press ë to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes 
the name of the function and the coordinates of the cursor from
the screen.
Chapter 10: Exploring Functions 87
Un-zooming
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to undo what that
command did to the graph, then:
1. Press q~ to access the Zoom Memory menu.
2. Press ¿ to select ZPrevious.
The graph is redrawn as it appeared in the previous viewing window.

When you’re using TRACE, if you want to start tracing your func-
tion at a specific value of the independent variable x, just key in
that value and press Õ when you’re finished. (The value you
assign to x must be between Xmin and Xmax; if it’s not, you get an
error message.) After you press Õ, the trace cursor moves to
the point on the graph having the x-coordinate you just entered. If
that point isn’t on the portion of the graph appearing on the
screen, the sidebar “Panning in Function mode” tells you how to
get the cursor and the graph in the same viewing window.
If the name of the function and the values of x and y are interfering
with your view of the graph when you use TRACE, increase the
height of the screen by pressing p and then decrease the
value of Ymin and increase the value of Ymax. 
Displaying Functions in a Table
After you’ve entered the functions in the Y= editor (as described in
the previous chapter), you can have the calculator create a table of
functional values. To create a table, perform the following steps:
1. Highlight the equal sign of those functions in the Y=
editor that you want to appear in the table.
Only those functions in the Y= editor that are defined with
a highlighted equal sign appear in the table. To highlight or
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
88
Panning in Function mode 
When you’re tracing a function and the cursor hits the top or bottom of the screen,
you will still see the coordinates of the cursor location displayed at the bottom of the
screen but you won’t see the cursor itself on the screen because the viewing
window is too small. Press Õ to get the calculator to adjust the viewing window
to a viewing window that is centered about the cursor location. If the function you
were tracing isn’t displayed at the top of the screen, repeatedly press } until it is.
The trace cursor then appears in the middle of the screen and you can use ~ and
| to continue tracing the graph.
When you’re tracing a function and the cursor hits the left or right side of the screen,
the calculator automatically pans left or right. It also appropriately adjusts the values
assigned to Xmin and Xmax in the Window editor, but it does not change the values
of Ymin and Ymax. So you may not see the cursor on the screen. If this happens,
follow the directions in the previous paragraph to see both the function and the
cursor on the screen.

un-highlight an equal sign, press o, use the ~|}Ü keys
to place the cursor on the equal sign in the definition of the
function, and then press Õ to toggle the equal sign
between highlighted and un-highlighted.
2. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor (shown
in Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2: The Table Setup editor.
3. Enter a number in TblStart and then press Õ.
TblStart is the first value of the independent variable x to
appear in the table. In Figure 10-2, TblStart is assigned the
value 5.
To enter the number you have chosen for TblStart, place
the cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign,
press the number keys to enter your new number, and then
press Õ.
4. Enter a number in ∆Tbl and then press Õ.
∆Tbl gives the increment for the independent variable x. In
Figure 10-2, ∆Tbl is assigned the value –1.
To enter the number you have chosen for ∆Tbl, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your new number, and then press
Õ.
5. Set the mode for Indpnt and Depend.
To change the mode of either Indpnt or Depend, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the desired mode,
either Auto or Ask, and then press Õ.
To have the calculator automatically generate the table for
you, put both Indpnt and Depend in Auto mode. The table
in Figure 10-3 was constructed in this fashion.
If you want to create a user-defined table in which you
specify which values of the independent variable x appear
in the table — and then have the calculator figure out the
corresponding values of the functions — put Indpnt in Ask
Chapter 10: Exploring Functions 89

mode and Depend in Auto mode. (How you construct the
table is explained in Step 6.) The table in Figure 10-4 was
constructed in this fashion. 
Figure 10-3: A table automatically generated by the calculator.
For a user-defined table, you don’t have to assign values to
TblStart and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor.
The other combinations of mode settings for Indpnt and
Depend are not all that useful unless you want to play a
quick round of “Guess the y-coordinate.”
Figure 10-4: A user-generated table.
6. Press ys to display the table.
When you display the table, what you see on the screen
depends on the modes you set for Indpnt and Depend in
Step 5. And what you can do with the table also depends on
these modes. Here’s what you see and what you can do:
• An automatically generated table:
If Indpnt and Depend are both in Auto mode, then when
you press ys, the table is automatically gener-
ated. To display rows in the table beyond the last row on
the screen, repeatedly press Ü until they appear. You
can repeatedly press } to display rows above the first
row on the screen.
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a differ-
ent set of rows, it also automatically resets TblStart to
the value of x that appears in the first row of the newly
displayed table. To return the table to its original state,
press yp to access the Table Setup editor, and
then change the value that the calculator assigned to
TblStart.
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
90

If you’re constructing a table for more than two func-
tions, only the first two functions appear on the screen.
To see the other functions, repeatedly press ~ until they
appear. This causes one or more of the initial functions
to disappear. To see them again, repeatedly press |
until they appear.
• A user-generated table:
If you put Indpnt in Ask mode and Depend in Auto
mode so that you can generate your own table; then
when you display the table, it should be empty. If it’s
not, clear the table (as described in the next section).
In an empty table, key in the first value of the independ-
ent variable x that you want to appear in the table, and
then press Õ. The corresponding y-values of the
functions in the table automatically appear. Key in the
next value of x you want in the table and press Õ,
and so on. The values of x that you place in the first
column of the table don’t have to be in any specific
order, nor do they have to be between the Xmin and
Xmax settings in the Window editor.
The word ERROR appearing in a table doesn’t indicate that the cre-
ator of the table has done something wrong. It indicates that either
the function is undefined or the corresponding value of x is not a
real-valued number. This is illustrated in Figures 10-3 and 10-4.
While displaying the table of functional values, you can edit the
definition of a function without going back to the Y= editor. To do
this, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column head-
ing for that function and then press Õ. Edit the definition of the
function (editing expressions is explained in Chapter 1) and press
Õ when you’re finished. The calculator automatically updates
the table and the definition of the function in the Y= editor.
Clearing a Table
Not all tables are created alike. An automatically generated table, for
example, cannot be cleared. To change the contents of such a table,
you have to change the values assigned to TblStart and ∆Tbl in the
Table Setup editor. After you have created a user-defined table, how-
ever, you can perform the following steps to clear its contents:
1. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor and
then set Indpend to Auto.
Chapter 10: Exploring Functions 91

2. Press ys to display an automatically generated
table.
3. Press yp and set Indpend back to Ask.
4. Press ys to display an empty table.
Viewing the Table and the Graph
on the Same Screen
After you have graphed your functions, and created a table of func-
tional values, you can view the graph and the table on the same
screen. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in G-T screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on G-T
in the lower-right corner of the Mode menu, and then press
Õ to highlight it. This is illustrated in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5: Setting the mode for viewing a graph and a table.
3. Press s.
After you press s, the graph and the table appear on
the same screen (as shown in Figure 10-6).
Figure 10-6: A Graph-Table split screen.
If you press any key used in graphing functions, such as q or
r, the cursor becomes active on the graph side of the screen.
To return the cursor to the table, press ys.

92

If you press r and then use the ~|}Ü keys to trace the
graph, the value of the independent variable x corresponding to
the cursor location on the graph is highlighted in the table and the
column for the function you’re tracing appears next to it. If neces-
sary, the calculator updates the table so you can see that row in
the table (as in Figure 10-7).
Figure 10-7: Using TRACE in Graph-Table mode.
To view the graph or the table in full screen mode, you can use
these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in Full screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on Full
in the bottom left hand corner of the Mode menu and press
Õ to highlight it.

A
fter graphing a function (as described in Chapter 9), you can
use the options on the Calculate menu to find the value of the
function at a specified value of x, to find the zeros (x-intercepts) of
the function, and to find the maximum and minimum values of the
function. You can even find the derivative of the function at a speci-
fied value of x, or you can evaluate a definite integral of the func-
tion. This, in turn, enables you to find the slope of the tangent to
the graph of the function at a specified value of x or to find the area
between the graph and the x-axis. Moreover, if you have graphed
two functions, there is an option on the Calculate menu that finds
the coordinates of these two functions’ points of intersection. 
The rest of this chapter tells you how to use the Calculate menu to
find these values. But be warned: The calculator is not perfect. In
most cases, using the options on the Calculate menu yields only an
approximation of the true value (albeit a very good approximation).
Finding the Value of a Function
When you trace the graph of a function, the trace cursor doesn’t
hit every point on the graph. So tracing is not a reliable way of find-
ing the value of a function at a specified value of the independent
variable x. The CALC menu, however, contains a command that
will evaluate a function at any specified x-value. To access and use
this command, perform the following steps:

1. Graph the functions in a viewing window that contains
the specified value of x.
Graphing functions and setting the viewing window are
explained in Chapter 9. To get a viewing window containing
the specified value of x, that value must be between Xmin
and Xmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 9.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¿ to select the value option.
5. Enter the specified value of x.
When using the value command to evaluate a function at a
specified value of x, that value must be an x-value that
appears on the x-axis of the displayed graph — that is, it
must be between Xmin and Xmax. If it isn’t, you get an
error message.
Use the keypad to enter the value of x (as illustrated in the
first graph in Figure 11-1). If you make a mistake when enter-
ing your number, press ë and re-enter the number.
6. Press Õ.
After you press Õ, the first highlighted function in the
Y= editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor
appears on the graph of that function at the specified value
of x, and the coordinates of the cursor appear at the
bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the second
graph in Figure 11-1.
7. Repeatedly press } to see the value of the other graphed
functions at your specified value of x.
Each time you press }, the name of the function being
evaluated appears at the top of the screen and the coordi-
nates of the cursor location appears at the bottom of the
screen. This is illustrated in the third graph in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1: Steps in evaluating two functions at a specified value of x.
Enter x
Press  Õ
Press }
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
96

After using the value command to evaluate your functions at one
value of x, you can evaluate your functions at another value of x by
keying in the new value and then pressing Í. Pressing any function
key (such as Í or r) after evaluating a function deactivates the
value command.
If you plan to evaluate functions at several specified values of x,
consider constructing a user-defined table of functional values (as
explained in Chapter 10).
Finding the Zeros of a Function
The zeros of the function y = f(x) are the solutions to the equation
f(x) = 0. Because y = 0 at these solutions, these zeros (solutions) are
really just the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of y =
f(x). (An x-intercept is a point where the graph crosses or touches
the x-axis.) To find a zero of a function, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that contains the
zeros of the function.
Graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing
window are explained in Chapter 9. To get a viewing
window containing a zero of the function, that zero must be
between Xmin and Xmax and the x-intercept at that zero
must be visible on the graph. 
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 9.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¡ to select the zero option.
5. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
6. Set the Left Bound for the zero you desire to find.
To do so, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on the
graph a little to the left of the zero, and then press Õ. A
Left Bound indicator appears at the top of the screen (as
illustrated by the triangle in the first graph of Figure 11-2).
7. Set the Right Bound for the zero.
To do so, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on the
graph a little to the right of the zero, and then press Õ.
A Right Bound indicator appears at the top of the screen,
as shown by the right triangle in the second graph of 
Figure 11-2.
Chapter 11: Evaluating Functions 97

8. Tell the calculator where you guess the zero is located.
This guess is necessary because the calculator uses a numer-
ical routine for finding a zero. The routine is an iterative
process that requires a seed (guess) to get it started. The
closer the seed is to the zero, the faster the routine finds the
zero. To do this, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on
the graph as close to the zero as possible, and then press
Õ. The value of the zero appears at the bottom of the
screen, as shown in the third graph of Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2: Steps in finding the zero of a function.
Finding Min & Max
Finding the maximum or minimum point on a graph has many
useful applications. For example, the maximum point on the graph
of a profit function not only tells you the maximum profit (the y-
coordinate), it also tells you how many items (the x-coordinate) the
company must manufacture to achieve this profit. To find the mini-
mum or maximum value of a function, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that contains the
minimum and/or maximum values of the function.
Graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing
window are explained in Chapter 9.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 9.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¬ to find the minimum, or press W to find 
the maximum.
5. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
6. Set the Left Bound of the minimum or maximum point.
To do so, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on the
graph a little to the left of the location of the minimum or

maximum point, and then press Õ. A left bound indica-
tor (the triangle shown in the first graph of Figure 11-3)
appears at the top of the screen.
7. Set the Right Bound for the zero.
To do so, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on the
graph a little to the right of the location of the minimum or
maximum point, and then press Õ. A right bound indicator
(the rightmost triangle in the second graph of Figure 11-3)
appears at the top of the screen.
8. Tell the calculator where you guess the min or max is
located.
To do so, use the | and ~ keys to place the cursor on the
graph as close to the location of the minimum or maximum
point as possible, and then press Õ. The coordinates of
the minimum or maximum point appears at the bottom of
the screen (as in the third graph of Figure 11-3).
Figure 11-3: Steps in finding the maximum value of a function.
Finding Points of Intersection 
Using the ~|}Ü keys to locate the point of intersection of two
graphs gives you an approximation of that point, but this method
rarely gives you the actual point of intersection. To accurately find
the coordinates of the point where two functions intersect, per-
form the following steps:
1. Graph the functions in a viewing window that contains
the point of intersection of the functions.
Graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing
window are explained in Chapter 9.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 9.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press Y to select the intersect option.

5. Select the first function.
If the name of one of the intersecting functions does not
appear at the top of the screen, repeatedly press } until it
does. This is illustrated in the first graph of Figure 11-4.
When the cursor is on one of the intersecting functions,
press Õ to select it.
6. Select the second function.
If the calculator does not automatically display the name of
the second intersecting function at the top of the screen,
repeatedly press } until it does. This is illustrated in the
second graph of Figure 11-4. When the cursor is on the
second intersecting function, press Õ to select it.
7. Use the | and ~ to move the cursor as close to the point
of intersection as possible.
This is illustrated in the third graph in Figure 11-4.
8. Press Õ to display the coordinates of the point of
intersection.

Finding the Slope of a Curve
The calculator is not equipped to find the derivative of a function.
For example, it cannot tell you that the derivative of x2 is 2x. But it
is equipped with a numerical routine that evaluates the derivative
at a specified value of x. This numerical value of the derivative is
the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function at the speci-
fied x-value. It is also called the slope of the curve. To find the
slope (derivative) of a function at a specified value of x, perform
the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that contains the
specified value of x.

Graphing a function and setting the viewing window are
explained in Chapter 9. To get a viewing window containing
the specified value of x, that value must be between Xmin
and Xmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 9.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ] to select the dy/dx option.
5. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
This is illustrated in the first graph in Figure 11-5.
6. Enter the specified value of x.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of x. As you use
the keypad, X= appears, replacing the coordinates of the
cursor location appearing at the bottom of the screen in
the previous step. The number you key in appears after X=.
This is illustrated in the second graph in Figure 11-5. If you
make a mistake when entering your number, press ë
and re-enter the number.
If you are interested only in finding the slope of the func-
tion in a general area of the function instead of at a specific
value of x, and then instead of entering a value of x, just use
the | and ~ to move the cursor to the desired location on
the graph of the function.
7. Press Õ.
After pressing Õ, the slope (derivative) is displayed at
the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the third
graph in Figure 11-5.

A
fter you’ve graphed your functions, parametric equations,
polar equations, or sequences, you can have the calculator
draw lines, circles, tangents, and functions on the graph. You can
also have the calculator write text on the graph, shade the graph,
even save a picture of the graph and the drawings. As an example,
Figure 12-1 was constructed using the Draw options provided by
the calculator.
Figure 12-1: An example of drawing on a graph.
Before drawing on a graph, make sure all Y=, Window, Mode, and
Format settings are exactly the way you want them to be. If you
change any of these settings after you’ve drawn on the graph, your
drawings disappear when the calculator redraws to graph with the
new settings. 

Drawing Lines, Circles, Tangents,
and Functions on a Graph
Have you ever wanted to graph the vertical line x = a but couldn’t
because the calculator graphs only functions of the form y = f(x)?
Have you been disappointed by the results you get when you
graph the circle x2 + y2 = r2 by graphing the functions y = √(r2 – x2)
and y = –√(r2 – x2)? And wouldn’t it be nice if you could get the cal-
culator to draw a tangent on a graph without your having to tell
the calculator the equation of the tangent? If you answered “yes” 
to any of these questions, then you are in for a treat. The Draw fea-
ture on the calculator takes care of all these problems. It will even
graph the inverse of a function!
Drawing line segments 
You can draw line segments, horizontal lines, and vertical lines on
the graph of functions, parametric equations, polar equations, or
sequences. To draw a line segment on your graph, follow these steps:
1. Graph the functions, parametric equations, polar equa-
tions, or sequences.
For more about graphing these entities, see (respectively)
Chapters 9, 13, 15, or 16.
2. Press yè¡ to select the Line option from the Draw
menu.
The coordinates of the cursor appear at the bottom of the
screen, provided that CoordOn is highlighted in the Format
menu. (The Format menu is described in Chapter 9.)
3. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the location
of one endpoint of the segment and press Õ.
4. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the location
of the other endpoint of the segment and press Õ.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to draw another segment or press
ë when you’re finished drawing line segments.
If you want to erase your drawing or a portion of your drawing, the
section in this chapter titled “Erasing Drawings” tells you how to
do this.
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 
106

Drawing horizontal and vertical lines
The procedures for drawing horizontal and vertical lines are simi-
lar to the above procedure for drawing a line segment. To draw a
horizontal line, perform the following steps. (For a vertical line,
you would select the Vertical option from the Draw menu in Step 2,
below. Otherwise, the procedures are the same.)
1. Graph the function, parametric equations, polar equa-
tion, or sequence.
Graphing such entities is described in Chapters 9, 13, 15, or
16, respectively.
2. Press yè¬ to select the Horizontal option from the
Draw menu. 
3. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the location
of the horizontal line and press Õ.
If using the ~|}Ü keys doesn’t take you to the exact
location of your horizontal line, press yz to exit the
graph. Then press yè¬, enter the y-coordinate of the
horizontal line, and press Õ. Your horizontal line
appears on the graph.
4. Repeat Step 3 to draw another horizontal line or press
ë when you’re finished drawing horizontal lines.
If you used the Tip in Step 3 to draw the horizontal line,
then you won’t have to press ë when you’re finished.
But you must press yè¬ again if you want to draw
more horizontal lines.
Drawing circles on a graph
The steps for drawing a circle on a graph are similar to the steps in
the last section for drawing a line segment on the graph. Press
yèÆ to select the Circle option from the Draw menu, place
the cursor at the center of the circle and press Õ, then move
the cursor to a point that defines the radius of the circle and press
Õ. Repeat this process to draw another circle or press ë
when you’re finished drawing circles.
Alternatively, if you know the center and radius of the circle, press
yz to exit the graph. Then press yèÆ. Enter the center
and radius of the circle, separated by commas, and then press
§Õ, as shown in the second picture in Figure 12-2, where the
center of the circle is (–1, 0) and the radius is π/1.8.

Figure 12-2: Steps in drawing a circle on a graph.
Drawing tangents on a graph
You can draw a tangent line on the graph of a function, parametric
equation, or polar equation. If you’re drawing a tangent to a func-
tion, as a bonus, the calculator gives you the equation of that tan-
gent. If you’re drawing a tangent to a parametric or polar graph,
the calculator will give you the slope of that tangent. To draw a
tangent, follow these steps:
1. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn and graph
the functions, parametric equations, or polar equations.
Graphing such entities and setting the Format menu are
described in Chapters 9, 15, or 16, respectively.
2. Press yèY to select the Tangent option from the
Draw menu.
3. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the cursor is on the
appropriate graph.
4. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the location
of the tangent line and press Õ.
Instead of using the ~|}Ü keys, you can use the keypad
to enter the precise location of the tangent. To do so, enter
the value of the independent variable, and then press Õ.
Drawing functions on a graph
To draw a function on a graph, press yè] to select the
DrawF option from the Draw menu. Enter the function as a func-
tion of x and press Õ. If you’re in Parametric, Polar, or
Sequence mode, the letter x is entered into the calculator by press-
ing Éø, as shown in Figure 12-3.
If pressing yè] places the DrawF command after something
that was previously enter in the Home screen, press ë to erase
that line and then press yè].

You can draw inverses of functions in Function mode only. The
mode menu is discussed in Chapter 1. To draw the inverse, press
yèR to select the DrawInv option form the Draw menu. Press
ê~¿ to open the Variables Function menu. Press the number of
the function whose inverse you want to graph. Press Õ and the
inverse function is drawn on the graph, as illustrated in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4: Steps in drawing the inverse of a function.
Shading Between Functions
Regardless what mode the calculator is in, you can shade only
between functions written specifically as functions of the inde-
pendent variable x. These functions don’t have to be entered in the
calculator ahead of time. When you shade the area between two
functions, you can shade the whole area or just a portion of that
area. To shade functions, follow these steps:
1. Press yè¨ to select the Shade option from the
Draw menu.
2. Enter the definitions of the lower function, press ¢, and
then enter the definition of the upper function. 
The order in which you enter the functions determines
what portion of the graph will be shaded. In the second pic-
ture in Figure 12-5, the lower function is Y1 and the upper
function is Y2. In the third picture in this figure, Y2 is the
lower function.

Writing Text on a Graph
Writing text on a graph is quite useful. For example, you can indi-
cate the numerical value of tick marks on the axes and you can
label the graphs. On the other hand, writing text on a graph can be
very frustrating because the calculator has no undo feature and it
takes practice to figure out where to place the text so that it doesn’t
interfere with the graph. To write text on the graph, follow these
steps:
1. Graph the functions, parametric equations, polar equa-
tions, or sequences.
Graphing such entities is described in Chapters 9, 13, 15, or
16, respectively.
2. Press yè) to select the Text option from the Draw
menu.
3. Position the cursor on the screen at the spot where you
want to start writing text.
Finding this spot takes practice. The cursor looks like a
very small + sign and the text you write will be about three
times as tall as the cursor and two and a half times as wide.
The upper-left corner of the text will be positioned in the
fourth quadrant of this + sign.
4. Enter your text.
Use the É key to enter letters and the number keys to
enter numbers. The = sign is entered by pressing yç¿
Chapter 12: Drawing on a Graph 111

and the arithmetic functions are entered by pressing j, c,
Ø, or •. Other useful symbols can be found in the Catalog.
For example, the small letter r in Figure 12-1 was entered by
pressing y) to enter the Catalog, repeatedly pressing }
until the indicator was next to r, and then pressing Õ. 
If you don’t like the location of the text you’ve placed on
the screen, move the cursor to the upper-left corner of the
text and repeatedly press É) to replace the text with
a space. Doing so erases the text; it may also erase a small
part of the graph. The next section tells you how to patch
any holes created by using this technique to erase text.
5. Move the cursor to a new location to enter more text or
press ë when you’re finished writing text.
Freehand Drawing on a Graph
You can use the Pen option to place freehand drawings on a graph.
The angle symbol around θ in Figure 12-1 was constructed using
the Pen. And if using the previous tip left a hole in the graph or on
an axis, you can patch it by using the Pen. To use the Pen to create
a freehand drawing, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the functions, parametric equations, polar equa-
tions, or sequences.
Graphing such entities is described in Chapters 9, 13, 15, or
16, respectively.
2. Press yè}Õ to select the Pen option from the
Draw menu.
3. Move the cursor to the spot where you want to place your
free-hand drawing and press Õ.
4. Use the ~|}Ü keys to construct your drawing and
press Õ when you’re finished.
As you press the ~|}Ü keys, the pixels on the screen are
shaded along the path of the cursor.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to create another drawing or press
ë when you’re finished using the pen.
Erasing Drawings 
Because the Draw menu has no Undo feature, the capability to
erase is important — and three types of erasing are possible: erase
all drawings, erase a portion of a drawing or graph, or erase one or
Part IV: Graphing and Analyzing Functions

more points from a drawing or graph. (Erasing points from a graph
comes in handy when you really want to emphasize that a function
is undefined at a certain point.)
 To erase all drawings: Press yè¿ to select ClrDraw from
the Draw menu. If the graph is displayed at the time you pressed
these keys, the graph will be redrawn without the drawings. If
you press these keys from the Home Screen, you also have to
press Õ to put the ClrDraw command into action.
 To erase a portion of a drawing or graph: The space key
(É)), which is entered as text, can be used to erase a
portion of a drawing or graph. Each time you use this tech-
nique, it erases an area about three times as high as the
cursor and two times as wide. (The previous section, “Writing
Text on a Graph,” tells you how to enter a space as text.)
 To erase one or more points from a drawing or graph: Press
yè~¡ to select Pt-Off from the Draw Points menu. Move
the cursor to the point you want to erase and press Õ.
Move the cursor to the next point you want to erase and press
Õ. When you’re finished erasing points, press ë.
Saving Graphs and Drawings
A graph that contains drawings can be saved only as a Picture. When
you recall that Picture from memory, all you can do is look at it. You
cannot, for example, change the viewing window or trace the graph.
To Save a graphs and drawings as a Picture, follow these steps:
1. Press yè~~ to access the Draw Store menu.
2. Press ¿ to store your graph as a Picture.
3. Enter an integer from 0 through 9.
The calculator can store up to 10 Pictures. If, for example,
you enter the number 5, your Picture is stored in the calcu-
lator as Pic5.
If you save your Picture as Pic5 without realizing that you
had previously stored another Picture in Pic5, the calcula-
tor will, without warning or asking your permission, erase
the old Pic5 and replace it with the new Pic5. To see a list
of the Pictures already stored in your calculator, press
yj¡R. 
Chapter 12: Drawing on a Graph 113

If you already have ten Pictures stored in your calculator and
don’t want to sacrifice any of them, consider saving some of
them on your PC (Chapter 22 describes how to do so).
4. Press Õ.
If you want to delete a Picture from the calculator, just perform the
following steps:
1. Press yj to access the Memory menu.
2. Press ¡ to access the Mem Mgt/Del menu.
3. Press R to access the Pic files stored in the calculator.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press Ü to move the indicator to
the Pic you want to delete.
5. Press {.
6. Press yz to exit this menu and return to the 
home screen.
And to recall a Picture, all you have to do is:
1. Press yè~~ to access the Draw Store menu.
2. Press ¡ to recall your Picture.
3. Enter the number of your stored Picture.
4. Press Õ.

 Drawing on a sequence graph
A
sequence is simply an ordered list of terms or numbers. The
most famous sequence is perhaps the Fibonacci sequence, 
{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . .}, where the first two terms are given and the
remaining terms are found by adding the previous two terms. The
formula used to generate a sequence is referred to by various
names, such as a recurrence relation, a recursive function, or an
iterative function. Texas Instruments calls these formulas sequence
functions, so I use this term as well.
In spite of the power of the calculator, it’s rather limited when 
dealing with sequence functions. It can accommodate only three
sequence functions, and each function can address only the previ-
ous two terms of that function (or of another function). So the cal-
culator can handle the Fibonacci sequence, u(n) = u(n – 1) + u(n – 2),
but nothing fancier.
Entering a Sequence
The following lists the steps for entering a sequence into the calcu-
lator. For the sake of simplicity, I tell you how to enter the sequence
u(n). But what is stated in these steps for u(n) also applies to the
sequences v(n) and w(n).

1. Press z and put the calculator in Sequence mode, as
shown in Figure 13-1. 
To highlight an item in the Mode menu, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the item, and then press Õ.
Highlight Seq in the fourth line to put the calculator in
Sequence mode. Highlighting Float in the second line dis-
plays numbers with as many decimal places as the calcula-
tor can handle. If your sequence deals with money, highlight
the number 2 in the second line to make the calculator
round all numbers to two decimal places. (For more infor-
mation on the other items on the Mode menu, please refer
to Chapter 1.)
Figure 13-1: Setting Sequence mode.
2. Press o, enter a value for nMin, and press Õ.
nMin denotes the first value of the independent variable n
in the sequence u(n) and in all other sequences you enter
into the calculator. You usually want to set it equal to 1 so
your sequences look like {u(1), u(2), u(3), . . .}, {v(1), v(2),
v(3), . . .}, and {w(1), w(2), w(3), . . .}. But if your sequences
represent an experiment that starts at “time zero,” you
would want to set nMin equal to 0. This way your sequences
would look like {u(0), u(1), u(2), . . .} and so on.
To enter the number you’ve chosen for nMin, place the
cursor on the number appearing after nMin, press the
number keys to enter your new value, and then press
Õ.
nMin must be set equal to 0 or a positive integer. The cal-
culator isn’t equipped to handle negative values for nMin.
Setting nMin equal to something other than 0 or a positive
integer results in an error message.
3. Enter the definition of the sequence u(n) and press Õ.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
118

To erase an entry that appears after u(n), use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor to the right of the equal sign 
and press ë. Then enter your definition for the new
sequence.
The sequence function names u, v, and w appear on your
keypad in yellow, above ¨, R, and Æ, respectively. To enter
u, for example, press y¨. To enter the independent vari-
able n, press Ñ.
The only variables allowed in the definition of any sequence
are these: u(n – 1), u(n – 2), v(n – 1), v(n – 2), w(n – 1), 
w(n – 2), and n. For example, defining u(n) = v(n) + 1 results
in an error message.
4. Enter the value of u(nMin) and press Õ.
u(nMin) is left blank, set equal to the first term in the
sequence u(n), or set equal to the first two terms in u(n). It
all depends of how the sequences u, v, and w are defined.
The following tells you what value to assign to u(nMin) and
how it’s entered in the calculator:
• u(nMin) can be left blank if none of the sequences u, v,
or w use u(n – 1) or u(n – 2) in their definitions. If u(nMin)
has previously been assigned a value, you can get rid of
that value by using the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor
after the equal sign, pressing ë to erase it, and then
blanking it by pressing Õ.
• u(nMin) is set equal to the first term in the sequence u(n)
if any of the sequences u, v, or w use u(n – 1) in their def-
initions, but none of them use u(n – 2). To set u(nMin)
equal to the first term in the sequence u(n), use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor after the equal sign,
then use the number keys to enter the value you want 
to assign u(nMin), and press Õ. As you enter this
number, the calculator automatically erases any previ-
ous value assigned to u(nMin); after you press Õ,
the calculator automatically places curly braces around
the number you just entered.
• u(nMin) is set equal to the first two terms in the sequence
u(n) if any of the sequences u, v, or w use u(n – 2) in their
definitions. And to complicate matters, these terms must
be entered in reverse order, and you must supply the
curly braces. You enter these terms after the equal sign
Chapter 13: Graphing Sequences 119

for u(nMin) by keying in: {second term in u(n), first term
in u(n)}. The curly braces are entered into the calculator
by pressing y£ and y§. (An example appears at the
bottom of Figure 13-2.)
If you’re ever in doubt about how to set u(nMin), you can
never go wrong by setting it equal to the first two terms in
the sequence u(n). However, it’s not always mathematically
easy to find these two terms.
In the example in Figure 13-2, u(nMin) is left blank because
none of the sequences u, v, or w used u(n – 1) or u(n – 2) in
their definitions. v(nMin) is set equal to the first term in v(n)
because v(n) used v(n – 1) in its definition. In this example
v(nMin) was assigned the value of 5. Because u(n) used
w(n – 2) in its definition, w(nMin) is set equal to the first
two terms in w(n), listed in reverse order.
Figure 13-2: An example of entering sequences.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
120
A comment on setting u(nMin)
Figure 13-2 illustrates a situation of when you may want to, but don’t have to, deviate
from the requirements for setting u(nMin). In this example, the calculator does not
know the value of the first two terms of u(n), nor can it evaluate them. After all, u(1)
= w(-1) and u(2) = w(0), but the calculator can evaluate w(n) only for n ≥1.
Luckily, the calculator does not have to know these terms. It just calculates u(n) for
n ≥3. When you graph u(n), or produce a table of the values for u(n), the first two
terms of u(n) don’t appear, but the rest of the sequence does. If you can’t live with
the omission of these terms in the graph or in the table, then set u(nMin) equal to
the first two terms in u(n), listed in reverse order.
In this example, u(n) = w(n – 2) + n = [2(n – 2) + 1] + n = 3n – 3. So evaluating the first
two terms of u(n) isn’t that difficult. However, for more complicated sequences, it
may not be worth your time to figure out the values of these terms. After all, didn’t
you get the calculator so you wouldn’t have to do scads of math by hand? In situations
like this, I recommend just living with the omission of the first two terms in the graph
and the table.

Graphing Sequences
After you have entered the sequence functions into the calculator,
as described in the previous section, you can use the following
steps to graph the sequences:
1. Turn off any Stat Plots that you don’t want to appear in
the graph of your sequences.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status
of the Stat Plots. (Stat Plots are discussed in Chapter 19.)
If Plot1, Plot2, or Plot3 is highlighted, then that Stat Plot will
be graphed along with the graph of your sequences. If it’s
not highlighted, it won’t be graphed. In Figure 13-2, Plot1
will be graphed along with the sequences
To turn off a highlighted Stat Plot in the Y= editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the highlighted Stat
Plot and then press Õ. If you want to graph the Stat Plot
later on, use this same process to rehighlight it.
When you’re graphing sequences, Stat Plots that are turned
on when you don’t really want them graphed cause prob-
lems. The most common problem is the ERR: INVALID DIM
error message, which gives you precious little insight into
what’s causing the problem. So if you aren’t planning to
graph a Stat Plot along with your sequences, make sure all
Stat Plots are turned off. (The previous paragraph tells you
how to turn them off.)
2. Press yq to access the Format menu.
3. Set the format for the graph in the first line of the Format
menu by placing the cursor on the desired format and
then pressing Õ.
Figure 13-3 pictures the Format menu when the calculator
is in Sequence mode. The second line of this menu gives
you a choice: You can display the coordinates of a point in
rectangular form (RectGC) or polar form (PolarGC). The
first line offers various formats for graphing sequences.
Assuming you’ve selected RectGC, here is what the calcula-
tor graphs in each format on the first line of the menu:
• Time: This is the most common format for graphing
sequences because it graphs the sequences as a func-
tion of the independent variable n. That is, in the Time
format, the points (n, u(n)), (n, v(n)), and (n, w(n)) are
graphed.
Chapter 13: Graphing Sequences 121

• Web: This format produces a web plot (also known as a
cobweb plot because of its shape) for a sequence u(n).
Use it when you want to see whether u(n) converges 
to an equilibrium point or just veers off into space. It
graphs the points (u(n), u(n + 1)) and the line y = x.
Using the r and ~ keys then shows you whether
the sequence is converging or diverging. This tracing
process is explained in Chapter 14.
In Web format, the calculator places two restrictions on
how the sequence u(n) is defined. First, it requires that
u(n – 1) appear as a variable in the definition of u(n);
second, it requires that u(n – 1) be the only variable
used in this definition. Defining u(n) as u(n) = u(n – 1) +
u(n – 2) or as u(n) = v(n – 1) results in an error message.
And because u(n) = u(n – 1) + n uses the variable n in its
definition, it too results in an error message when it’s
used in the Web format.
• uv, vw, and uw: Use these formats to create phase plots
when you want to see how one sequence affects another
sequence. The uv format graphs the points (u(n), v(n));
the vw format graphs the points (v(n), w(n)); uw format
graphs the points (u(n), w(n)).
The remaining items on the Format menu are explained in
Chapter 9. When you’re graphing sequences, there’s no
harm in leaving these items highlighted as they appear in
Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-3: Format menu in Sequence mode.
4. Press p to access the Window editor.
5. After each of the first four window variables, enter a
numerical value that is appropriate for the sequences
you’re graphing. Press Õ after entering each number.
Figure 13-4 pictures the Window editor when the calculator
is in Sequence mode. The following list explains the vari-
ables you must set in this editor:
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
122

• nMin: This setting contains the first value of the inde-
pendent variable n. It must be set equal to 0 or a positive
integer.
nMin appears both in the Window editor and in the 
Y= editor. If you change the value of nMin in either the
Window editor or the Y= editor, the value of nMin will
automatically be updated in both editors. (A more
detailed explanation of nMin appears in Step 2 of the
previous section.)
Figure 13-4: Window editor in Sequence mode.
• nMax: This setting contains the largest value of the inde-
pendent variable n that you want the calculator to use to
evaluate your sequences. For example, if nMin = 0 and
nMax = 100, the calculator will evaluate the first 101
terms in each sequence.
nMax must be set equal to a positive integer that is
greater than nMin. Be reasonable when entering a value
for nMax. If you’re graphing three sequences and nMax
= 1,000, it’s going to take the calculator at least a minute
to get the job done.
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your
sequences, and you start to regret that rather large
value you placed in nMax, press … to terminate the
graphing process. You can then go back to the Window
editor and adjust the nMax setting.
• PlotStart: This setting tells the calculator where you
want to start graphing in each sequence. For example, if
PlotStart = 20, then the calculator starts the graph with
the 20th term in each sequence.
This isn’t always intuitive. If nMin = 1, then the 20th
term in the sequence u(n) is u(20). But if nMin = 0, then
the 20th term in this sequence is u(19).
Chapter 13: Graphing Sequences 123

PlotStart must be set equal to a positive integer. Usually
it’s set equal to 1 so that the graph starts at the beginning
of a sequence.
• PlotStep: This setting tells the calculator if you want to
skip graphing any terms in each sequence. A setting of 1
tells the calculator to graph every term in each sequence;
a setting of 2 tells it to graph every other term; and a set-
ting of 3 tells it to graph every third term, and so on.
PlotStep must be set equal to a positive integer. Usually
it’s set equal to 1 so that the graph shows all terms in
your sequences.
You use the remaining items in the Window editor to set a
viewing window for the graph (a procedure explained in
detail in Chapter 9). If you know the dimensions of the view-
ing window required for your graph, go ahead and assign
numerical values to the remaining variables in the Window
editor and advance to Step 8. If you don’t know the mini-
mum and maximum y values required for your graph, the
next step tells you how to get the calculator to find them
for you.
6. Press q) to access ZoomFit.
After you have assigned values to nMin, nMax, PlotStart,
and PlotStep, ZoomFit determines appropriate values for
Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax and graphs your sequences.
ZoomFit graphs the sequences in the smallest possible
viewing window, however, and it won’t assign appropriate
values to Xscl and Yscl.
If you like the way the graph looks, then you can skip the
remaining steps. If you’d like spruce up the graph, Step 7
gives you some pointers.
7. Press p and adjust the values assigned to the X and
Y settings. Press Õ after entering each new number.
Here’s how to readjust the viewing window after using
ZoomFit:
• Xmin: If you want to see the y-axis on your graph, 
set Xmin equal to 0.
• Xmax: If you’re interested in seeing a more detailed
graph of the beginning of the sequence, decrease the
value of Xmax.
• Xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the 
x-axis look like railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far
too many tick marks. Twenty or fewer tick marks makes
for a nice looking axis.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
124

• Ymin and Ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the
top and bottom of the screen, decrease the value
assigned to Ymin and increase the value assigned to
Ymax. If you want to see the x-axis on the graph, assign
values to Ymin and Ymax so that zero is strictly between
these two values.
• Yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis
look like railroad tracks (too many tick marks). Fifteen
or fewer tick marks    is a nice number for the y-axis.
8. Press s to regraph the sequences.
When you’re graphing sequences, if you get the ERR:
INVALID error message and then select the Goto option,
the calculator sends you to the definition of the “problem”
sequence that you placed in the calculator. More often than
not, however, the true location of the problem is in the way
you defined u(nMin), v(nMin), or w(nMin), and not in the
way you defined the sequence (as the calculator leads you
to believe). For example, if w(n) = u(n – 2) + v(n – 1) and the
calculator places the cursor after u(n – 2) when you select
the Goto option, then the problem is most likely caused by
not setting u(nMin) equal to the first two terms in u(n). The
previous section explains how to set u(nMin).
Graphing Several Sequences
Even if you’ve put the calculator in the Sequential mode for graphing
functions (as indicated in the sixth line of Figure 13-1), it’s going to
graph all sequences simultaneously. So you can’t tell the sequences
apart simply by looking at the order in which they’re graphed.
To identify the graphs of several sequences, set a different graph
style for each sequence:
1. Press o to access the Y= editor.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the icon
appearing at the very left of the definition of the sequence.
3. Repeatedly press Õ until you get the desired graph
style.
When the calculator graphs the discrete points in a scatter
plot, it gives you a choice of graphing them as dots, little
plus signs, or small squares. It’s a shame that you don’t get
the same choices when graphing the discrete points in a
sequence. Unfortunately, the graphing styles for sequences
are Dotted Line, Line, and Thick Line. (Go figure!) 
Chapter 13: Graphing Sequences 125

Each time you press Õ, you get a different style. In
Figure 13-2, u(n) is set to the default Dotted Line style,
whereas v(n) and w(n) are respectively set to the Line 
and Thick Line styles.
If you don’t want the calculator to graph one of your sequences,
un-highlight its equal sign. To graph it at a later time, rehighlight its
equal sign. You can do so in the Y= editor by using the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the equal sign in the definition of the
sequence and then pressing Õ to toggle the equal sign between
highlighted and unhighlighted. In the example in Figure 13-2, the cal-
culator won’t graph sequence w(n), but it will graph u(n) and v(n).
Saving a Sequence Graph
After you’ve graphed your sequences (as described in the last two
sections), you can save the graph and its entire Window, Y= editor,
Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database. When you recall
the Database at a later time, you get more than just a picture of the
graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y= editor, Mode,
and Format settings to those stored in the Database. Thus you can,
for example, trace the recalled graph. 
The procedures for saving and recalling a graph database are
described in Chapter 9.
Drawing on a Sequence Graph
After you’ve graphed your sequences (as described earlier in this
chapter), you can draw lines and functions on the graph, write text
on it, and save a picture of the graph and the drawings. This capa-
bility is handy if you want to illustrate the way a sequence con-
verges to a number, or show that a sequence can be approximated
by a function.
The procedures for drawing on a graph and for saving the result as
a picture are described in Chapter 12.

Exploring Sequence Graphs
When you explore the graph of a sequence, you’re usually interested
in seeing where the sequence goes. Does it level off and converge to
a number? Does it veer off into space? What does it look like from
the 50th term on? What’s the value of the 100th term? The calcula-
tor’s Zoom and Trace features help you answer such questions.
Using ZOOM in Sequence mode
Pressing q accesses the Zoom menu. On this menu you see all
the Zoom commands that are available for graphing functions. Not
all of them are useful when graphing sequences, however. Here are
the ones that I use when graphing sequences:
 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a specified
portion of the sequence. How to use ZoomFit is explained in
Chapter 13.
 Zbox: After the graph is drawn (as described in Chapter 13),
this command allows you to define a new viewing window for
a portion of your graph by enclosing it in a box as illustrated
in Figure 14-1. The box becomes the new viewing window. To
construct the box:
1. Press q¿.

Figure 14-1: Using ZBox.
2. Define a corner of the box.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to
the spot where you want one corner of the box to be
located, and then press Õ. The calculator marks
that corner of the box with a small square.
3. Construct the box. 
To do so, press the ~|}Ü keys. As you press these
keys, the calculator draws the sides of the box. 
When you use ZBox, if you don’t like the size of the
box, you can use any of the ~|}Ü keys to resize
the box. If you don’t like the location of the corner
you anchored in Step 2, press ë and start over
with Step 1. 
4. When you’re finished drawing the box, press Õ
and the graph will be redrawn in the viewing
window specified by the box.
When you use Zbox, Õ is pressed only two times.
The first time you press it is to anchor a corner of the
zoom box. The next time you press Õ is when
you’re finished drawing the box and are ready to have
the calculator redraw the graph.
 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn (as described
in Chapter 13), these commands allow you to zoom in on a
portion of the graph or to zoom out from the graph. They
work very much like a zoom lens on a camera. To use these
commands:
1. Press q¡ if you want to zoom in, or press
q¬ if you want to zoom out.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the 
spot on-screen from which you want to zoom in or
zoom out.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
128

This spot becomes the center of the new viewing
window.
3. Press Õ.
You can press Õ again to zoom in closer or to
zoom out one more time.
4. Press ë when you’re finished zooming in or
zooming out.
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to
undo what that command did to the graph, press q~¿ to select
ZPrevious from the Zoom Memory menu. The graph is then redrawn
as it appeared in the previous viewing window.
Tracing a sequence
After you have graphed your sequences (as described in 
Chapter 13), press r and then use ~ to investigate the
sequence or sequences. Here’s what you will see, and what you
can do to change things:
 The definition of the sequence: The definition of the sequence
you’re tracing is displayed in the upper-left corner of the
screen, provided the calculator is in ExprOn format (refer to
Figure 13-3 in Chapter 13). If you have graphed more than one
sequence and you would like to trace a different sequence,
press }. Each time you press this key, the cursor jumps to
another sequence. Eventually it jumps back to the original
sequence.
 The independent variable n: The value of n corresponding to
the cursor location is displayed in the lower-left corner of the
screen, provided the calculator is in CoordOn format (refer to
Figure 13-3 in Chapter 13). When you press r, the cursor
is placed at the beginning of the graph of the sequence and n
displays the value you assigned to nMin in the Window editor.
Each time you press ~, the cursor moves to the next plotted
point in the graph — and the value of n changes to the value of
the independent variable corresponding to that plotted point.
If you press |, the cursor will move left to the previously
plotted point in the sequence. And if you press } to trace a
different sequence, the tracing of that sequence will start at
the same value of n that was displayed on-screen before you
pressed this key.

When you’re using TRACE, if you want to start tracing your
sequence at a specific value of the independent variable n,
just key in that value and press Õ. (The value you assign
to n cannot be greater than nMax; if it is, you will get an error
message.) After you press Õ, the trace cursor moves to
the point on the graph corresponding to that value of n. But
the calculator does not change the viewing window. So if the
value you assigned to n is greater than Xmax, you won’t see
the cursor; it’s on the part of the graph outside the viewing
window. The sidebar “Panning in Sequence mode” tells you
how to get the cursor and the graph in the same viewing
window.
 The values of x and y: At the bottom of the screen you see the
values of the x- and y- coordinates of the cursor location, pro-
vided the calculator is in CoordOn format (see Figure 13-3 in
Chapter 13). In the PolarGC format, the coordinates of this
point display in polar form. The relationship between these
coordinates and the sequence depends on how you set the
format for the sequence. Setting the format is explained in
Chapter 13. Here’s what you will see in the various formats:
• Time format: In this format the x-coordinate is the inde-
pendent variable n and the y-coordinate is the correspon-
ding value of the sequence at n.
• In the Web format: In this format, the trace cursor starts
on the x-axis at the first term in the sequence u(n). When
you press ~, the cursor moves vertically to the graph of
the points (u(n), u(n + 1)). And when you press ~ again,
it moves horizontally to the line y = x. Each time you
press ~ after that, the cursor repeats this alternating ver-
tical and horizontal movement. In addition, a vertical or
horizontal line connects all points traced by the cursor.
This is illustrated in Figure 14-2.
In Web format, if nMin =1, the points traced by the trace cursor
are (u(1), 0), (u(1), u(2)), (u(2), u(2)), (u(2), u(3)), (u(3), u(3)),
(u(3), u(4)), and so on. You use this format when you want to
see if a sequence converges or diverges. Figure 14-2 shows an
example of using the Web format and TRACE to investigate the
convergence of a sequence.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
130

• uv, vw, and uw formats: In the uv format, the 
x-coordinate is the value of u(n) and the y-coordinate is
the value of v(n). In the vw format, the x-coordinate is the
value of v(n) and the y-coordinate is the value of w(n).
And in the uw format, the x-coordinate is the value of
u(n) and the y-coordinate is the value of w(n).
Figure 14-2: Tracing a convergent sequence in Web format.
Press ë to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the
name of the function and the coordinates of the cursor from the
screen. 
Chapter 14: Exploring Sequences 131
Panning in Sequence mode
When you’re tracing a sequence and the cursor hits an edge of the screen, if nMax
is greater than Xmax and you continue to press ~, the coordinates of the cursor are
displayed at the bottom of the screen. However, the calculator does not automati-
cally adjust the viewing window; you won’t see the cursor on the graph. To rectify
this situation, make a mental note of the value of n (or jot it down) and then press
Õ. The calculator then redraws the graph centered at the location of the cursor
at the time you pressed Õ.
Unfortunately, after the graph is redrawn, the trace cursor is placed at the begin-
ning of the first sequence appearing in the Y= editor. To get the trace cursor back
on the part of the graph displayed in the new viewing window, key in that value of
n that you made note of, and then press Õ. If you weren’t tracing the first
sequence appearing in the Y= editor, use } to place the cursor on the graph you
were tracing. The trace cursor then appears in the middle of the screen and you
can use ~ or | to continue tracing the sequence.

If the name of the sequence and the value of the independent vari-
able n are interfering with your view of the graph when you use
TRACE, increase the height of the window by pressing p and
decreasing the value of Ymin and increasing the value of Ymax. 
Displaying Sequences in a Table
After you’ve entered the sequence functions into the calculator (as
described in Chapter 13), you can have the calculator create a table
of the terms in the sequences. To create a table, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the equals sign of those sequences in the Y=
editor that you want to appear in the table.
Only those sequences in the Y= editor that are defined with
a highlighted equal sign will appear in the table. To highlight
or un-highlight an equal sign, press o, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the equal sign in the definition
of the sequence, and then press Õ to toggle the equal
sign between highlighted and un-highlighted.
2. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor. 
3. Enter a number in TblStart and then press Õ.
TblStart is the first value of the independent variable n to
appear in the table. In Figure 14-3, TblStart is assigned the
value 1.
When constructing a table of sequence values, be sure to
set TblStart equal to 0 or to a positive integer.
To enter the number you’ve chosen for TblStart, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your number, and then press
Õ.
Figure 14-3: The Table Setup editor.
4. Enter a number in ∆Tbl and then press Õ.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
132

∆Tbl gives the increment for the independent variable n.
For example, if TblStart = 1 and ∆Tbl = 5, then the table for
sequence u(n) will contain the values of u(1), u(6), u(11),
and so on. In Figure 14-3, ∆Tbl is assigned the value 1.
When constructing a table of sequence values, ∆Tbl must
be set equal to a positive integer.
To enter the number you have chosen for ∆Tbl, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your number, and then press
Õ.
5. Set the mode for Indpnt and Depend.
To change the mode of either Indpnt or Depend, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the desired mode,
either Auto or Ask, and then press Õ. 
To have the calculator automatically generate the table for
you, put both Indpnt and Depend in Auto mode. The first
table in Figure 14-4 was constructed this way.
If you want to create a user-defined table in which you spec-
ify which values of the independent variable n are to appear
in the table and then have the calculator figure out the 
corresponding sequence values for you, put Indpnt in Ask
mode and Depend in Auto mode. How you construct the
table is explained in Step 6. The second table in Figure 14-4
was constructed this way. 
For a user-defined table, you don’t have to assign values to
TblStart and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor.
The other combinations of mode settings for Indpnt and
Depend are rather useless when you’re dealing with
sequences.
Figure 14-4: Tables of sequences.
6. Press ys to display the table.
Automatically
generated
User-defined
Chapter 14: Exploring Sequences 133

When you display the table, what you see on-screen
depends on the modes you set for Indpnt and Depend in
Step 5. And what you can do with the table also depends 
on these modes. Here’s what you see and what you can do:
• An automatically generated table:
If Indpnt and Depend are both in Auto mode, then when
you press ys, the table is automatically gener-
ated. To display rows in the table beyond the last row
on-screen, repeatedly press Ü until they appear. And
repeatedly press } to display rows above the first row
on-screen.
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a differ-
ent set of rows, it also automatically resets TblStart to
the value of n appearing in the first row of the newly dis-
played table. To return the table to its original state,
press yp to access the Table Setup editor, and
then change the value the calculator assigned to
TblStart.
If you’re constructing a table for all three sequences,
only the first two sequences — u(n) and v(n) — appear
on-screen. To see the values in the column for sequence
w(n), repeatedly press ~ until that column appears.
Doing so, however, makes the u(n) column disappear. 
To see it again, repeatedly press | until it appears.
• A user-generated table:
If you put Indpnt in Ask mode and Depend in Auto mode
so that you can generate your own table, then when you
display the table, it should be empty. If it’s not, clear the
table (as described in the next section, “Clearing a User-
Defined Table”).
In an empty table, key in the first value of the independ-
ent variable n you want to appear in the table, and then
press Õ. The corresponding sequence values auto-
matically appear. Key in the next value of n you want in
the table and press Õ, and so on. The values for n
that you place in the first column don’t have to be in 
any specific order, but they do have to be non-negative
integers.
If it’s taking the calculator a long time to evaluate an entry in a
user-defined table and this inspires you to terminate the process
by pressing É, be warned — you will then have to clear the
table and start over from scratch. Here’s why: After pressing É,
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
134

you are confronted with an error message that asks you if you want
to Quit or Goto. It would be nice if Goto sent you back to the table
so you could edit your entry, but it doesn’t; instead, it sends you to
the definition of the sequence. So no matter which choice you
make (Quit or Goto), the only way back to the table is by pressing
ys. But the entry that caused the problem in the first place
is still in the table. So the calculator starts evaluating it all over
again before displaying the table. This is indeed a vicious cycle! The
only way out is to clear the table (as explained in the next section)
and start over. 
If the table displays the word ERROR instead of a sequence value,
then the calculator is unable to determine what that value should
be. The sequence may be undefined or not a real number. This can
also happen when the value of TblStart in the Table Setup editor is
less than the value of nMin in the Window editor. See Chapter 13
for another explanation of why this can happen.
While displaying the table for a sequence, you can edit the defini-
tion of the sequence without going back to the Y= editor. To do so,
use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column heading
for that sequence and then press Õ. Edit the definition of the
sequence and press Õ when you’re finished. The calculator
automatically updates the table and the definition of the sequence
in the Y= editor.
Clearing a User-Defined Table
After you have created a user-defined table (as described in the
previous section), follow these steps to clear its contents:
1. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor and
then set Indpend to Auto.
2. Press ys to display an automatically generated
table.
3. Press yp and set Indpend back to Ask.
4. Press ys to display an empty table.
An automatically generated table cannot be cleared. To change the
contents of such a table, change the values assigned to TblStart
and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor. Automatically generated tables
and the Table Setup editor are described in the previous section. 
Chapter 14: Exploring Sequences 135

Viewing the Table and the Graph
on the Same Screen
After you’ve graphed your sequences (as described in Chapter 13)
and created a table for the sequences (as described earlier in this
chapter), you can view the graph and the table on the same screen.
To do so, follow these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in G-T screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on G-T
in the lower-right corner of the Mode menu and press Õ
to highlight it. This is illustrated in Figure 14-5.
Figure 14-5: Setting the mode for viewing a graph and a table.
3. Press s.
After you press s, the graph and the table appear on
the same screen (as illustrated in Figure 14-6).
If you press any key used in graphing a sequence, such as q
or r, the cursor will become active on the graph side of the
screen. To return the cursor to the table, press ys.
If you press r and then use the ~|}Ü keys to trace the
graph, the value of the independent variable n corresponding to the
cursor location on the graph will be highlighted in the table and
the column for the sequence you’re tracing will appear next to it. If
necessary, the calculator updates the table so you can see that row
in the table (as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 14-6).
To view the graph or the table in Full Screen mode, follow these
steps:
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
136

Figure 14-6: Graph-Table split screens.
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in Full Screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on Full
in the bottom left corner of the Mode menu and press Õ
to highlight it. 
3. Press s to see the graph, or press ys to see
the table.
Evaluating Sequences
To evaluate a sequence at a specified value of n, follow these steps:
1. Graph the sequences in a viewing window that contains
the specified value of n.
Graphing sequences and setting the viewing window are
explained in Chapter 13. To get a viewing window containing
the specified value of n, that value must be between nMin
and nMax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained in Chapter 13.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¿ to select the value option.
5. Enter the specified value of n.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of n. This is
illustrated in the first graph in Figure 14-7. (The graph in
this figure is graphed in the Time format.) If you make a
mistake when entering your number, press ë and re-
enter the number.
Chapter 14: Exploring Sequences 137

Figure 14-7: Steps in evaluating sequences at a specified value of n.
6. Press Õ.
What you see on the screen depends on the format used to
produce the graph. The formats are as follows:
• Time format: After you press Õ, the first highlighted
sequence in the Y= editor appears at the top of the
screen, the cursor appears on the graph of that function
at the specified value of n, and the coordinates of the
cursor appears at the bottom of the screen (as in the
second graph in Figure 14-7).
Repeatedly press } to see the value of the other graphed
sequences at your specified value of T. Each time you
press } the name of the sequence being evaluated
appears at the top of the screen and the coordinates of
the cursor location appear at the bottom of the screen
(as in the third graph in Figure 14-7).
• Web format: In this format, the specified value of n and
the coordinates of the cursor appear at the bottom of the
screen. The y-coordinate is the value of the sequence at
the specified value of n.
• uv, vw, and uw format: In this format, the specified value
of n and values for x and y appear at the bottom of the
screen. If you are in uv format, x is the value of u(n) and
y is the value of v(n). In vw format, x = v(n) and y = w(n),
and so on.
After using the value command to evaluate your sequence
at one value of n, you can evaluate your sequence at another
value of n by simply keying in the new value of n and then
pressing Õ. Pressing any function key (such as Õ or
r) after evaluating a function will deactivate the value
command.
If you’re planning on evaluating sequences at several specified
values of n, consider constructing a user-defined table.

A
s a particle moves along a curve, you usually want to know
two things about that particle: Where is it? How long did it
take to get there?
An answer to the first question is pretty straightforward: the x- and
y-coordinates of the particle. To get an answer to the second ques-
tion, you can bring a third variable — time — into the picture. To
answer both questions simultaneously, you express the x and y
variables as functions of t, the time variable.
The motion of the particle is thus described by the pair of paramet-
ric equations x = f(t) and y = g(t). In these equations, t is called the
parameter, hence the equation type: parametric.
In addition to motion, such equations also describe graphs that are
not the graphs of functions. An example of such a graph appears in
Figure 15-5.
Entering Parametric Equations
The calculator can handle up to six pairs of parametric equations,
X1T and Y1T through X6T and Y6T. To enter parametric equations in
the calculator: 

1. Press z and put the calculator in Parametric mode, as
shown in Figure 15-1. 
To highlight an item in the Mode menu, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the item, and then press Õ.
Highlight Par in the fourth line to put the calculator in
Parametric mode. For more information on the other items
on the Mode menu please refer to Chapter 1.
Figure 15-1: Setting Parametric mode.
2. Press o to access the Y= editor.
3. Enter the definitions of the pair of parametric equations
XnT and YnT, with n being an integer between 1 and 6.
To erase an entry that appears after XnT or YnT, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor to the right of the equal
sign and press ë. Then enter your definition for the
new parametric equation. 
When defining parametric equations, the only symbol the
calculator allows for the independent variable (parameter)
is the letter T. Press Ñ to enter this letter in the defini-
tion of your parametric equation. In Figure 15-2, this key
was used to enter the X1T parametric equation.
As a time saving convenience, when entering a parametric
equation in the Y= editor, you can reference another para-
metric equation in its definition. In Figure 15-2, equations
Y1T, X3T, and Y3T are defined in this manner. To paste a para-
metric equation name in the equation you’re entering in the
Y= editor, press ê~¡ and then press the number key
for the name of the parametric equation you want pasted in
the definition.
Parametric equations must be entered in pairs. If you enter
just one equation in the pair, say XnT but not YnT, then when
you go to graph these parametric equations, you won’t see
a graph nor will you get an error message warning you that
there is a problem. 
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
140

Figure 15-2: Examples of entering parametric equations. 
Graphing Parametric Equations
After you have entered the parametric equations into the calcula-
tor, you can use the following steps to graph the equations:
1. Turn off any Stat Plots that you don’t want to appear in
the graph of your parametric equations.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status
of the Stat Plots. (Stat Plots are discussed in Chapter 19.)
If Plot1, Plot2, or Plot3 is highlighted, then that Stat Plot
will be graphed along with the graph of your parametric
equations. If it’s not highlighted, it won’t be graphed. In
Figure 15-2, Plot1 will be graphed along with the parametric
equations.
To turn off a highlighted Stat Plot in the Y= editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the highlighted Stat
Plot and then press Õ. The same process is used to
rehighlight the Stat Plot in order to graph it at a later time.
When graphing parametric equations, Stat Plots that are
turned on when you don’t really want them to be graphed
cause problems. The most common problem is the ERR:
INVALID DIM error message. This error message gives you
little insight into what is causing the problem. So if you
aren’t planning to graph a Stat Plot along with your paramet-
ric equations, please make sure all Stat Plots are turned off.
2. Press yq to access the Format menu.
3. Set the format for the graph by using the ~|}Ü keys 
to place the cursor on the desired format and then press
Õ.
Figure 15-3 pictures the Format menu when the calculator
is in Parametric mode. The first line of the menu gives you
a choice between having points on the graph displayed in
(x, y) rectangular form or in (r, θ) polar form. The remaining
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 141

items on the Format menu are explained in Chapter 9. When
graphing parametric equations, there is no harm in leaving
these items highlighted as they appear in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3: Format menu in Parametric mode.
4. Press p to access the Window editor. 
5. After each of the first three window variables, enter a
numerical value that is appropriate for the parametric
equations you’re graphing. Press Õ after entering
each number.
Figure 15-4 pictures the Window editor when the calculator
is in Parametric mode. The following gives an explanation
of the variables that you must set in this editor:
• Tmin: This setting contains the first value of the inde-
pendent variable (parameter) T that the calculator will
use to evaluate all parametric equations in the Y= editor.
It can be set equal to any real number.
• Tmax: This setting contains the largest value of the inde-
pendent variable (parameter) T that you want the calcu-
lator to use to evaluate all parametric equations in the
Y= editor. It can be set equal to any real number.
• Tstep: This setting tells the calculator how to increment
the independent variable T as it evaluates the paramet-
ric equations in the Y= editor and graphs the correspon-
ding points.
Tstep must be a positive real number. 
You want Tstep to be a small number like 0.1 or π/24, but
you don’t want it to be too small like 0.001. If Tstep is too
small, it will take a few minutes for the calculator to pro-
duce the graph. And if Tstep is a large number like 1, the
calculator may not graph enough points to show you the
true shape of the curve.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
142

If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your
parametric equations, and this causes you to regret that
very small number you placed in Tstep, press … to ter-
minate the graphing process. You can then go back to the
Window editor and adjust the Tstep setting.
When graphing parametric equations that use trigono-
metric functions in their definition, it’s best to set Tmin,
Tmax, and Tstep to multiples of π. In Figure 15-4, Tmax is
set equal to 2π and Tstep is set equal to π/24. π is entered
into the calculator by pressing yõ.
Figure 15-4: Window editor in Parametric mode.
The remaining items in the Window editor deal with setting
a viewing window for the graph. Setting the viewing window
is explained in detail in Chapter 9. If you know the dimen-
sions of the viewing window required for your graph, go
ahead and assign numerical values to the remaining vari-
ables in the Window editor and advance to Step 8. If you
don’t know the minimum and maximum x and y values
required for you graph, the next step tells you how to get
the calculator to find them for you.
6. Press q) to access ZoomFit.
After you’ve assigned values to Tmin, Tmax, and Tstep,
ZoomFit determines appropriate values for Xmin, Xmax,
Ymin, and Ymax, and then graphs your parametric equa-
tions. Note, however, that ZoomFit graphs parametric
equations in the smallest possible viewing window, and it
doesn’t assign new values to Xscl and Yscl.
If you like the way the graph looks, then you can skip the
remaining steps. If you’d like spruce up the graph, Step 7
gives you some pointers.
7. Press p and adjust the values assigned to the X and
Y settings. Press Õ after entering each new number.
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 143

Here are some pointers on how to readjust the viewing
window after using ZoomFit:
• Xmin and Xmax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the
left and right sides of the screen, decrease the value
assigned to Xmin and increase the value assigned to
Xmax. If you want to see the y-axis on the graph, assign
values to Xmin and Xmax so that zero is strictly between
these two values.
• Xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis
look like railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far too
many tick marks. Twenty or fewer tick marks makes for
a nice looking axis.
• Ymin and Ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the
top and bottom of the screen, decrease the value
assigned to Ymin and increase the value assigned to
Ymax. If you want to see the x-axis on the graph, assign
values to Ymin and Ymax so that zero is strictly
between these two values.
• Yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the y-axis
look like railroad tracks. Fifteen or fewer tick marks is a
nice number for the y-axis.
8. Press s to regraph the parametric equations.
After you’ve graphed your parametric equations (as described 
earlier in this chapter), you can draw lines and functions on the
graph or write text on the graph. And you can save a picture of 
the graph and the drawings.
Chapter 12 describes the procedures for drawing on a graph and
for saving the result as a picture.
Graphing several equations
To identify the graphs of several pairs of parametric equations, set
a different graph style for each pair of parametric equations. The
following steps show how:
1. Press o to access the Y= editor.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the icon
appearing at the very left of the definition of the first
parametric equation in the pair of parametric equations.
3. Repeatedly press Õ until you get the desired graph
style.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
144

You have five styles to choose from: Line, Thick Line, Path,
Animate, and Dotted Line. Each time you press Õ, you
get a different style. The Path style, denoted by the Î icon,
uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s being graphed, and
when the graph is complete, the circle disappears and
leaves the graph in Line style. The Animate style, denoted
by the Ï icon, also uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s
being graphed, but when the graph is complete, no graph
appears on-screen.
The most common styles used to graph parametric equations are
Line, Thick Line, and Dotted Line. In Figure 15-2, X1T and Y1T are set
to the default Line style; X2T and Y2T are set to the Thick Line style;
X3T and Y3T are set to the Dotted Line style. 
If you don’t want the calculator to graph a pair of parametric equa-
tions, unhighlight the equal signs in that pair. To graph it at a later
time, rehighlight the equal signs. You can do so in the Y= editor by
using the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the equal sign in 
the definition of either parametric equation in the pair, and then
pressing Õ to toggle the equal sign between highlighted and
un-highlighted. In Figure 15-2, for example, the calculator won’t
graph the parametric equations X1T and Y1T, but it will graph the
other two pairs of parametric equations.
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 145
Panning in Parametric mode
When you’re tracing parametric equations and the cursor hits an edge of the
screen, if T is less than Tmax and you continue to press ~, the coordinates of the
cursor will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, but the calculator does not
automatically adjust the viewing window. So you won’t see the cursor on the graph.
To rectify this situation, make a mental note of the value of T and then press Í. The
calculator then redraws the graph centered at the location of the cursor at the time
you pressed Õ. 
Unfortunately, after the graph is redrawn, the trace cursor is placed at the begin-
ning of the first pair of parametric equations appearing in the Y= editor — and it
may not even appear on-screen. To get the trace cursor back on the part of the
graph displayed in the new viewing window, key in that value of T that you made a
mental note of earlier, and then press Õ. If you weren’t tracing the first pair of
parametric equations that appear in the Y= editor, use } to place the cursor on the
graph you were tracing. The trace cursor then appears in the middle of the screen
and you can use ~ to continue tracing the graph.

Using ZOOM commands
After you’ve graphed your parametric equations (as explained ear-
lier in this chapter), you can use Zoom commands to change the
viewing window of your graph. Pressing q accesses the Zoom
menu. On this menu you will see all the Zoom commands that are
available for graphing functions. Chapter 10 offers a detailed expla-
nation of what these commands do and how you use them.
The Zoom commands that are most useful when graphing paramet-
ric equations are
 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a speci-
fied portion of the graph. How to use ZoomFit is explained in
the section, “Graphing Parametric Equations,” earlier in this
chapter.
 ZSquare: Because the calculator screen is rectangular instead
of square, circles will look like ellipses if the viewing window
isn’t properly set. ZSquare adjusts the settings in the Window
editor so that circles look like circles. To use ZSquare, first
graph your parametric equations and then press qY. The
graph is then redrawn in a viewing window that makes circles
look like circles. Figure 15-5 illustrates the effect that ZSquare
has on the spiral x = tcos(t), y = tsin(t).
Figure 15-5: A spiral graphed using ZoomFit and then using ZSquare.
 Zbox: Use this command to define a new viewing window for a
portion of your graph by enclosing it in a box (as shown in
Figure 15-6). The box then becomes the new viewing window.
To construct the box, follow these steps:
1. Press q¿.
2. Define a corner of the box.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to
the spot where you want one corner of the box to be
located, and then press Õ. The calculator marks
that corner of the box with a small square.

3. Construct the box. 
To do so, press the ~|}Ü keys. As you press these
keys, the calculator draws the sides of the box.
When you use ZBox, if you don’t like the size of the
box, you can use any of the ~|}Ü keys to resize
the box. If you don’t like the location of the corner
you anchored in Step 2, press ë and start over
with Step 1.
4. When you’re finished drawing the box, press Õ
and the graph is redrawn in the viewing window
specified by the box.
When you use ZBox, Õ is pressed only two times.
The first time you press it’s to anchor a corner of the
zoom box. The next time you press Õ is when
you’re finished drawing the box and are ready to have
the calculator redraw the graph.
Figure 15-6: Using ZBox.
 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn, these com-
mands allow you to zoom in on a portion of the graph or to
zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a zoom
lens on a camera. To use these commands, follow these steps:
1. Press q¡ if you want to zoom in, or press
q¬ if you want to zoom out.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the spot
on the screen from which you want to zoom in or
zoom out.
This spot becomes the center of the new viewing
window.
3. Press Õ.
You can press Õ again to zoom in closer or to
zoom out one more time.
4. Press ë when you’re finished zooming in or
zooming out.

If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to
undo what that command did to the graph, press q~¿ to select
ZPrevious from the Zoom Memory menu. ZPrevious redraws the
graph as it appeared in the previous viewing window.
Saving a parametric graph
After you have graphed your parametric equations, as described
earlier in this chapter, you can save the graph and its entire Window,
Y= editor, Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database. When
you recall the Database at a later time, you get more than just a
picture of the graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y=
editor, Mode, and Format settings to those stored in the database.
So you can, for example, trace the recalled graph.
The procedures for saving and recalling a Graph Database are
described in Chapter 9.
Tracing a parametric graph
After you’ve graphed your parametric equations (as described ear-
lier in this chapter), press r and then use ~ to investigate
these equations. Here’s what you see, and what you can do to
change things:
 The definition of the parametric equations: The parametric
equations you’re tracing are displayed at the top of the screen,
provided the calculator is in ExprOn format, as indicated in
Figure 15-3. If you’ve graphed more than one pair of paramet-
ric equations and you’d like to trace a different pair of equa-
tions, press }. Each time you press this key, the cursor jumps
to another pair of parametric equations. Eventually it jumps
back to the original pair of equations.
 The independent variable T: The value of T corresponding to
the cursor location is displayed in the lower left hand corner
of the screen, provided the calculator is in CoordOn format,
as indicated in Figure 15-3. When you press r, the cursor
is placed at the beginning of the graph of the parametric equa-
tions and T displays the value you assigned to Tmin in the
Window editor. Each time you press ~, the cursor moves to
the next plotted point in the graph and the value of T changes
to the value of the independent variable corresponding to that
plotted point.
If you press |, the cursor will move left to the previously
plotted point in the graph. And if you press } to trace a differ-
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
148

ent pair of parametric equations, the calculator starts tracing
that pair of equations at the value of T that was displayed on-
screen before you pressed this key.
 The values of x and y: At the bottom of the screen, you see the
values of the x- and y- coordinates of the cursor location (pro-
vided the calculator is in CoordOn format), as in Figure 15-3.
In the PolarGC format, the coordinates of this point display in
polar form.
Press ë to stop tracing the graph. Doing so also removes the
name of the function and the coordinates of the cursor from the
screen.
If your cursor disappears from the screen while you are tracing a
parametric graph, see the sidebar “Panning in Parametric mode” to
see how to rectify this situation.
When you’re using TRACE, if you want to start tracing your paramet-
ric equations at a specific value of the independent variable T, just
key in that value and press Õ. (The value you assign to T must
be between Tmin and Tmax; if it’s not, you will get an error mes-
sage.) After you press Õ, the trace cursor moves to the point on
the graph corresponding to that value of T. If that point isn’t on the
part of the graph that’s on-screen, you can get the cursor and the
graph to appear in the same viewing window. The sidebar, “Panning
in Parametric mode,” tells you how to do so. 
If the name of the parametric equations and the value of the inde-
pendent variable T are interfering with your view of the graph when
you use TRACE, press p and decrease the value of Ymin and
increase the value of Ymax.
Displaying Equations in a Table
After you have entered the parametric equations into the calcula-
tor, as described earlier in this chapter, you can have the calcula-
tor create a table of the terms in all pairs of parametric equations
in the Y= editor that are defined with a highlighted equal sign. (The
tip in the “Graphing several equations” section of this chapter tells
you how to highlight or unhighlight the equal sign.) To create a
table:
1. Highlight the equal sign of those parametric equations in
the Y= editor that you want to appear in the table.
Only those parametric equations in the Y= editor that are
defined with a highlighted equal sign will appear in the
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 149

table. To highlight or unhighlight an equal sign, press o,
use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the equal sign
in the definition of either equation in the pair of parametric
equations, and then press Õ to toggle the equal sign
between highlighted and unhighlighted.
2. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor (shown
in Figure 15-7).
Figure 15-7: The Table Setup editor.
3. Enter a number in TblStart and then press Õ.
TblStart is the first value of the independent variable T to
appear in the table. In Figure 15-7, TblStart is assigned the
value 0.
To enter the number you have chosen for TblStart, place
the cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign,
press the number keys to enter your number, and then
press Õ.
4. Enter a number in ∆Tbl and then press Õ.
∆Tbl gives the increment for the independent variable T.
You usually want to set ∆Tbl equal to a small number like
0.5, 0.1, or 0.01. In Figure 15-7, ∆Tbl is assigned the value 0.1.
To enter the number you have chosen for ∆Tbl, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your number, and then press
Õ.
5. Set the mode for Indpnt and Depend.
To change the mode of either Indpnt or Depend, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the desired mode,
either Auto or Ask, and then press Õ.
To have the calculator automatically generate the table for
you, put both Indpnt and Depend in Auto mode. The first
table in Figure 15-8 was constructed in this fashion.
If you want to create a user-defined table that contains 
only those values of the independent variable T that you
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
150

specify — and then have the calculator figure out the corre-
sponding values of the parametric equations — put Indpnt
in Ask mode and Depend in Auto mode. Step 6 explains how
you construct such a table; the second table in Figure 15-8,
constructed in this fashion, shows you how it looks.
For a user-defined table, you don’t have to assign values to
TblStart and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor.
The other combinations of mode settings for Indpnt and
Depend are not that useful when you’re dealing with para-
metric equations.
Figure 15-8: Tables for parametric equations.
6. Press ys to display the table.
When you display the table, what you see on the screen
depends on the modes you set for Indpnt and Depend in
Step 5. And what you can do with the table also depends on
these modes. Here’s what you see and what you can do:
• For an automatically generated table:
If Indpnt and Depend are both in Auto mode, then
pressing ys generates the table automatically. 
To display rows in the table beyond the last row on the
screen, repeatedly press Ü until those rows appear.
Likewise, repeatedly press } to display rows above 
the first row on the screen. 
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a differ-
ent set of rows, it also automatically resets TblStart to
the value of T appearing in the first row of the newly 
displayed table. To return the table to its original state,
press yp to access the Table Setup editor, and
then change the value the calculator assigned to TblStart.
If you’re constructing a table for more than one pair of
parametric equations, only the first pair will appear on
the screen. To see another pair of equations, repeatedly
press ~ until they appear. This causes the first pair of
equations to disappear. To see them again, repeatedly
press | until they appear.
Automatically
generated
User-defined
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 151

• For a user-generated table:
If you put Indpnt in Ask mode and Depend in Auto mode
so that you can generate your own table, then the table
should be empty when you display it. If it’s not, clear the
table (as described in the next section).
In an empty table, key in the first value of the independ-
ent variable T you want to appear in the table, and then
press Õ. The corresponding values of the first pair 
of parametric equations automatically appear. Key in the
next value of T you want in the table and press Õ, and
so on. The values for T that you place in the first column
don’t have to be in any specific order, nor do they have
to be between Tmin and Tmax.
While displaying the table for parametric equations, you can edit
the definition of the equations without going back to the Y= editor.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column
heading for that parametric equation and then press Õ. Edit
the definition of the equation (editing expressions is explained in
Chapter 1) and press Õ when you’re finished. The calculator
automatically updates the table and the definition of the paramet-
ric equation in the Y= editor.
The word ERROR appearing in a table indicates that either the para-
metric equations are undefined or the corresponding values of T
are not real numbers.
Clearing a user-defined table
After you have created a user-defined table, as described in the
previous section, to clear its contents, perform the following steps:
1. Press yp to access theTable Setup editor and then
set Indpend to Auto.
2. Press ys to display an automatically generated
table.
3. Press yp and set Indpend back to Ask.
4. Press ys to display an empty table.
An automatically generated table cannot be cleared. To change the
contents of such a table, change the values assigned to TblStart and
∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor. 
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations

Viewing the table and the graph 
on the same screen
After you have graphed your parametric equations and created a
table for the parametric equations, you can view the graph and the
table on the same screen. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in G-T screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on G-T
in the bottom-right corner of the Mode menu and press
Õ to highlight it. This is illustrated in Figure 15-9.
Figure 15-9: Setting the mode for viewing a graph and a table.
3. Press s.
After you press s, the graph and the table appear on
the same screen.
If you press any key used in graphing parametric equations, such
as q or r, the cursor will become active on the graph side
of the screen. To return the cursor to the table, press ys.
If you press r and then use the ~|}Ü keys to trace the
graph, the value of the independent variable T corresponding to
the cursor location on the graph will be highlighted in the table and
the columns for the parametric equations you’re tracing will appear
next to it. If necessary, the calculator will update the table so you
can see that row in the table. This is illustrated in Figure 15-10.
To view the graph or the table in full screen mode:
1. Press z.
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 153

2. Put the calculator in Full screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on Full
in the bottom left hand corner of the Mode menu and press
Õ to highlight it. 
3. Press s to see the graph, or press ys to see
the table.
Figure 15-10: Using TRACE in Graph-Table mode.
Evaluating Parametric Equations
To evaluate a pair of parametric equations at a specified value of T:
1. Graph the equations in a viewing window that contains
the specified value of T.
Graphing parametric equations and setting the viewing
window are explained earlier in this chapter. To get a view-
ing window containing the specified value of T, that value
must be between Tmin and Tmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained earlier in this chapter.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¿ to select the value option.
5. Enter the specified value of T.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of T. This is illus-
trated in the first graph in Figure 15-11. If you make a mistake
when entering your number, press ë and re-enter the
number.
6. Press Õ.
After you press Õ, the first highlighted pair of paramet-
ric equations in the Y= editor appear at the top of the
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
154

screen, the cursor appears on the graph of that function 
at the specified value of T, and the coordinates of the
cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illus-
trated in the second graph in Figure 15-11.
7. Repeatedly press } to see the value of the other graphed
parametric equations at your specified value of T.
Each time you press } the names of the parametric equa-
tions being evaluated appear at the top of the screen; the
coordinates of the cursor location appear at the bottom of
the screen. The third graph in Figure 15-11 shows what this
arrangement looks like.
Figure 15-11: Steps in evaluating equations at a specified value of T.
If you’re planning on evaluating parametric equations at several
specified values of T, consider constructing a user-defined table. 
Finding Derivatives
To find the derivative (dy/dx, dy/dt, or dx/dt) of a pair of parametric
equations at a specified value of T:
1. Graph the parametric equations in a viewing window
that contains the specified value of T.
Graphing parametric equations and setting the viewing
window are explained earlier in this chapter. If you want 
to get a viewing window that contains the specified value 
of T, make sure that value is between Tmin and Tmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained earlier in this chapter.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¡, ¬, or W to respectively select the dy/dx, dy/dt,
or dx/dt option.
Enter T
Press Õ
Press }   
Chapter 15: Parametric Equations 155

5. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the appropriate
parametric equations appear at the top of the screen.
This is illustrated in the first graph in Figure 15-12.
6. Enter the specified value of T.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of T. As you use
the keypad, T= replaces the coordinates of the cursor loca-
tion appearing at the bottom of the screen in the previous
step. The number you key in is placed after T= (as in the
second graph in Figure 15-12). If you make a mistake when
entering your number, press ë and re-enter the number.
If you’re interested only in finding the slope of the curve in
a general area of the graph (instead of at a specific value of
T), then instead of entering a value of T, just use the | and
~ to move the cursor to the desired location on the graph.
7. Press Õ.
After pressing Õ, the derivative is displayed at the
bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the third graph
in Figure 15-12.

n the polar coordinate system, a point in the plane is described
by its angular direction (θ) and its distance r from the origin.
The angular direction θ is always measured from the positive x-axis
and the polar coordinates of the point are denoted by (r, θ). This is
illustrated in Figure 16-1.
Figure 16-1: Representing a point in polar coordinates.
Converting Coordinates
We’re used to seeing points in the xy-plane displayed in the (x, y)
rectangular form. But when dealing with polar equations, we view
these points in their (r, θ) polar form. To convert (x, y) from rectan-
gular to polar form:
1. Press yå to access the Angle menu. (On the TI-83,
press yé.)

Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
158
2. Press Y to select the R Pr( option.
This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 16-2.
3. Enter the point (x, y) and press Õ to display r in the
(r, θ) polar form of the point.
To do so, enter the x-coordinate, press À, enter the y-coor-
dinate, press §, and then press Õ. The value of r
appears on the right of the screen. This is illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 16-2.
4. Press yå] to select the R PΘ( option from the
Angle menu. (On the TI-83, press yé].)
5. Enter the point (x, y) and press Õ to display θ in the
(r, θ) polar form of the point.
This is illustrated in the second picture in Figure 16-2. θ will
be in degrees if the calculator is in Degree mode, or it will
be measured in radians if the calculator is in Radian mode. 
Figure 16-2: Converting from rectangular to polar coordinates.
If you’re a purist like me, you like radian measures, such as the one
in Figure 16-2, to be expressed as a fractional multiple of π, if possi-
ble. It’s much easier to know what the angle looks like in this form.
I can quickly sketch the angle π/6, but it would take me awhile to
sketch the angle .5235987756 radians. It turns out that they are the
same angle. This is why I like to convert a radian measure to a frac-
tional multiple of π, using the following steps:
1. If the radian measure is not the last entry in the calcula-
tor, enter it.
In the second picture in Figure 16-2, the last line indicates
that the radian measure of θ is the last entry in the calculator.
2. Press •yõÕ to divide the radian measure by π.
3. Press ç¿Õ to display the fractional multiple of π.

If the calculator can’t convert the decimal to a fraction, it
just redisplays the decimal.
Figure 16-3 illustrates the above steps. The 1/6 in this figure
indicates that the decimal radian measure (.5235987756) is
equal to π/6, thus showing that (2, π/6) is the polar form of
the point (√3, 1).
Figure 16-3: Converting a decimal to a fraction.
To convert (r, θ) from polar to rectangular coordinates:
1. Press yå¨ to select R Px( from the Angle menu.
(On the TI-83, press yé¨.)
2. Enter (r, θ) and press Õ to display the x-coordinate of
the point (x, y).
To do so, enter r, press À, enter θ, press §, and then press
Õ. The value of x-coordinate appears on the right of the
screen. If your calculator is in Degree mode, θ should be
entered in degrees; if the calculator is in Radian mode, θ
should be entered in radian measure. 
If the calculator is in Degree mode, but you want to enter
an angle in radian measure, enter the radian measure of the
angle (surrounded by parentheses, if necessary) and then
press yå¬ to indicate that it’s in radian measure. (On
the TI-83, press yé¬.) If you want to indicate that an
angle is in degree measure when the calculator is in Radian
mode, press yå¿. (On the TI-83, press yé¿.)
These are illustrated in Figure 16-4.

Entering Polar Equations
The calculator can handle up to six polar equations, r1 through r6.
To enter polar equations in the calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press z and put the calculator in Polar mode, as
shown in Figure 16-5.
To highlight an item in the Mode menu, use the ~|}Ü
keys to place the cursor on the item, and then press Õ.
Highlight Pol in the fourth line to put the calculator in
Polar mode. 
Figure 16-5: Setting Polar mode.
2. Press o to access the Y= editor.
3. Enter the definition of the polar equation rn, n being an
integer between 1 and 6.
To erase an entry that appears after rn, use the ~|}Ü keys
to place the cursor to the right of the equal sign and press
ë. Then enter your definition for the new polar equation. 
When you’re defining polar equations, the only symbol the
calculator allows for the independent variable is the angle
θ. Press Ñ to enter θ in the definition of your polar
equation. In Figure 16-6, this key was used to enter equa-
tions r1, r2, and r3. 
When you enter a polar equation in the Y= editor, as a time-
saver you can reference another polar equation in the defi-
nition you’re entering. In Figure 16-6, for example, equation
r4 is defined in this manner. To paste a polar equation name
into the equation you’re entering in the Y= editor, press
ê~¬ and then press the number key for the name of
the polar equation you want to paste into the definition.

Graphing Polar Equations
After you’ve entered the polar equations into the calculator, as
described in the previous section, you can use the following steps
to graph the equations:
1. Turn off any Stat Plots that you don’t want to appear in
the graph of your polar equations.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status
of the Stat Plots. (Stat Plots are discussed in Chapter 19.)
If Plot1, Plot2, or Plot3 is highlighted, then that Stat Plot
will be graphed along with the graph of your polar equa-
tions. If it’s not highlighted, it won’t be graphed. In Figure
16-6, Plot1 will be graphed along with the polar equations.
To turn off a highlighted Stat Plot in the Y= editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the highlighted Stat
Plot and then press Õ. The same process is used to
rehighlight the Stat Plot in order to graph it at a later time.
When graphing polar equations, Stat Plots that are turned
on when you don’t really want them to be graphed cause
problems. The most common problem is the ERR: INVALID
DIM error message. This error message gives you almost no
insight into what’s causing the problem. So if you aren’t
planning to graph a Stat Plot along with your polar equa-
tions, please make sure all Stat Plots are turned off. The
previous paragraph tells you how to turn them off.
2. Press yq to access the Format menu.
3. Set the format for the graph by using the ~|}Ü keys to
place the cursor on the desired format and then press
Õ.
Figure 16-7 pictures the Format menu when the calculator is
in Polar mode. The first line of the menu gives you a choice
between having points on the graph displayed in (x, y) rec-
tangular form or in (r, θ) polar form. The remaining items on
the Format menu are explained in Chapter 9. When graphing

polar equations, there is no harm in leaving these remain-
ing items highlighted as they appear in Figure 16-7.
Figure 16-7: Format menu in Polar mode.
4. Press p to access the Window editor. 
5. After each of the first three window variables, enter a
numerical value that is appropriate for the polar equa-
tions you’re graphing. Press Õ after entering each
number.
Figure 16-8 shows the Window editor when the calculator is
in Polar mode. The following gives an explanation of the
variables that you must set in this editor:
• θmin: This setting contains the first value of the inde-
pendent variable θ that the calculator will use to evalu-
ate all polar equations in the Y= editor. It can be set
equal to any real number.
Figure 16-8: Window editor in Polar mode.
• θmax: This setting contains the largest value of the inde-
pendent variable θ that you want the calculator to use to
evaluate all polar equations in the Y= editor. It can be set
equal to any real number.
θmax is usually set equal to 2π. However, as illustrated
in Figure 16-9, there are occasions when you may want
to set it equal to a larger number. π is entered into the
calculator by pressing yõ.
• θstep: This setting tells the calculator how to increment
the independent variable θ as it evaluates the polar
equations in the Y= editor and graphs the corresponding
points.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
162

Figure 16-9: The graph of 
/
r
1
=
H with θmax = 2π and 4π.
θstep must be a positive real number. 
You want θstep to be a small number like π/24, but you
don’t want it to be too small like 0.001. If θstep is too
small, it will take a few minutes for the calculator to pro-
duce the graph. And if θstep is a large number like 1, the
calculator may not graph enough points to show you the
true shape of the curve.
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your
polar equations, and you start to regret that very small
number you placed in θstep, press … to terminate the
graphing process. You can then go back to the Window
editor and adjust the θstep setting.
The remaining items in the Window editor deal with setting
a viewing window for the graph. Setting the viewing
window is explained in detail in Chapter 9. If you know the
dimensions of the viewing window required for your graph,
go ahead and assign numerical values to the remaining
variables in the Window editor and advance to Step 8. If
you don’t know the minimum and maximum x and y values
required for your graph, the next step tells you how to get
the calculator to find them for you.
6. Press q) to access ZoomFit.
After you’ve assigned values to θmin, θmax, and θstep,
ZoomFit determines appropriate values for Xmin, Xmax,
Ymin, and Ymax and graphs your polar equations.
However, ZoomFit graphs the polar equations in the small-
est possible viewing window and does not assign appropri-
ate values to Xscl and Yscl.
If you like the way the graph looks, then you can skip the
remaining steps. If you’d like spruce up the graph, Step 7
offers some pointers.
7. Press p and adjust the values assigned to the X and
Y settings. Press Õ after entering each new number.
θmax = 2π
θmax = 4π
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 163

Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
164
Here are some pointers on how to readjust the viewing
window after using ZoomFit:
• Xmin and Xmax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the
left and right sides of the screen, decrease the value
assigned to Xmin and increase the value assigned to
Xmax. If you want to see the y-axis on the graph, assign
values to Xmin and Xmax so that zero is strictly
between these two values.
• Xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the 
x-axis look like railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far
too many tick marks. Twenty or fewer tick marks makes
for a nice looking axis.
• Ymin and Ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the
top and bottom of the screen, decrease the value
assigned to Ymin and increase the value assigned to
Ymax. If you want to see the x-axis on the graph, assign
values to Ymin and Ymax so that zero is strictly
between these two values.
• Yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the 
y-axis look like railroad tracks. Fifteen or fewer tick
marks is a nice number for the y-axis.
8. Press s to regraph the polar equations.
After you’ve graphed your polar equations (as described earlier in
this chapter), you can draw lines and functions on the graph. You
can also write text on the graph. And you can save a picture of the
graph and the drawings.
The procedures for drawing on a graph and for saving the result as
a picture are described in Chapter 12.
Graphing several equations
To identify the graphs of several polar equations, set a different
graph style for each polar equation:
1. Press o to access the Y= editor.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the icon
appearing at the very left of the definition of the 
polar equation.
3. Repeatedly press Õ until you get the desired 
graph style.

You have five styles to choose from: Line, Thick Line, Path,
Animate, and Dotted Line. Each time you press Õ, you
get a different style. The Path style, denoted by the Î icon,
uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s being graphed, and
when the graph is complete, the circle disappears and
leaves the graph in Line style. The Animate style, denoted
by the Ï icon, also uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s
being graphed, but when the graph is complete, no graph
appears on the screen.
The most common styles used to graph polar equations are
Line, Thick Line, and Dotted Line. In Figure 16-6, r1 is set to
the default Line style; r2 is set to the Thick Line style; r3 and
r4 are set to the Dotted Line style. 
If you don’t want the calculator to graph a polar equation, un-high-
light the equal sign in that equation. To graph it at a later time,
rehighlight the equal sign. To do so in the Y= editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the equal sign in the defini-
tion of the polar equation — and then press Õ to toggle the
equal sign between highlighted and unhighlighted. In the example
in Figure 16-6, the calculator won’t graph equations r1, r2, and r4,
but it will graph r3.
Using ZOOM commands
After you’ve graphed your polar equations (as explained earlier in
this chapter), you can use Zoom commands to change the viewing
window of your graph. Pressing Õ accesses the Zoom menu.
On this menu you see all the Zoom commands that are available
for graphing functions. What these commands do, and how you
use them, is explained in detail in Chapter 10. 
The Zoom commands that are most useful when graphing polar
equations are:
 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a speci-
fied portion of the graph. How to use ZoomFit is explained in
the “Graphing Polar Equations” section earlier in this chapter.
 ZSquare: Because there are more columns of pixels than rows
on the calculator screen, circles will look like ellipses if the
viewing window isn’t properly set. ZSquare adjusts the set-
tings in the Window editor so that circles look like circles. To
use ZSquare, first graph your polar equations and then press
qY. The graph is then redrawn in a viewing window that
makes circles look like circles. Figure 16-10 illustrates the
effect that ZSquare has on the spiral x = tcos(t), y = tsin(t).
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 165

Figure 16-10: A cardioid graphed using ZoomFit and then using ZSquare.
 Zbox: This command allows you to define a new viewing
window for a portion of your graph by enclosing it in a box as
illustrated in Figure 16-11. The box becomes the new viewing
window. To construct the box:
1. Press q¿.
2. Define a corner of the box.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to
the spot where you want one corner of the box to be
located, and then press Õ. The calculator marks
that corner of the box with a small square.
3. Construct the box. 
To do so, press the ~|}Ü keys. As you press these
keys, the calculator draws the sides of the box. 
When you use ZBox, if you don’t like the size of the
box, you can use any of the ~|}Ü keys to resize
the box. If you don’t like the location of the corner
you anchored in Step 2, press ë and start over
with Step 1. 
4. When you’re finished drawing the box, press Õ
and the graph will be redrawn in the viewing
window specified by the box.
When you use ZBox, Õ is pressed only two times.
The first time you press it’s to anchor a corner of the
zoom box. The next time you press Õ is when
you’re finished drawing the box and are ready to have
the calculator redraw the graph.

 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn, these com-
mands allow you to zoom in on a portion of the graph or to
zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a zoom
lens on a camera. To use these commands, follow these steps:
1. Press q¡ if you want to zoom in, or press
q¬ if you want to zoom out.
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to move the cursor to the spot
on the screen from which you want to zoom in or
zoom out.
This spot becomes the center of the new 
viewing window.
3. Press Õ.
You can press Õ again to zoom in closer or to
zoom out one more time.
4. Press ë when you’re finished zooming in or
zooming out.
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to
undo what that command did to the graph, press q~¿ to
select ZPrevious from the Zoom Memory menu. ZPrevious
redraws the graph as it appeared in the previous viewing window.
Saving a polar graph
After you’ve graphed your polar equations (as described earlier in
this chapter), you can save the graph and its Window, Y= editor,
Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database. When you recall
the Database at a later time, you get more than just a picture of the
graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y= editor, Mode,
and Format settings to those stored in the database. So you can,
for example, trace the recalled graph. 
The procedures for saving and recalling a Graph Database are
described in Chapter 9.
Tracing a polar graph
After you’ve graphed your polar equations (as described earlier in
this chapter), press r and then use ~ to investigate these
equations. Here’s what you will see, and what you can do to
change things:
 The definition of the polar equation: The polar equation
you’re tracing is displayed at the top of the screen, provided
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 167

the calculator is in ExprOn format, as indicated in Figure 16-7.
If you have graphed more than one polar equation and you
would like to trace a different equation, press }. Each time
you press this key, the cursor jumps to another polar equa-
tion. Eventually it jumps back to the original equation.
 The independent variable θ: The value of θ corresponding to
the cursor location is displayed in the lower- left corner of the
screen, provided the calculator is in CoordOn format, as indi-
cated in Figure 16-7. When you press r, the cursor is then
placed at the beginning of the graph of the polar equation and θ
displays the value you assigned to θmin in the Window editor.
Each time you press ~, the cursor moves to the next plotted
point in the graph and the value of θ changes to the value of the
independent variable corresponding to that plotted point.
If you press |, the cursor will move to the previously plotted
point in the graph. And if you press } to trace a different
polar equation, the tracing of that equation will start at the
same value of θ that was displayed on the screen before you
pressed this key.
 The values of x and y: At the bottom of the screen you see
the values of the x- and y- coordinates of the cursor location,
provided the calculator is in RectGC and CoordOn format (as
shown previously in Figure 16-7). In the PolarGC format, the
coordinates of this point display in polar form.
Press ë to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes 
the name of the function and the coordinates of the cursor from
the screen. 
If your cursor disappears from the screen while you are tracing a
polar graph, the sidebar “Panning in Polar mode” tells you how to
rectify this situation.
If you’re using TRACE and you want to start tracing your polar
equation at a specific value of the independent variable θ, just key
in that value and press Õ. (The value you assign to θ must be
between θmin and θmax; if it isn’t, you will get an error message.)
After you press Õ, the trace cursor moves to the point on the
graph corresponding to that value of θ. If that point is not on the
part of the graph appearing on the screen, you can get the cursor
and the graph in the same viewing window. The sidebar, “Panning
in Polar mode,” tells you how to do so.
If the name of the polar equation and the value of the independent
variable θ are interfering with your view of the graph when you use
TRACE, increase the height of the window by pressing p and
decreasing the value of Ymin and increasing the value of Ymax.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
168

Displaying Equations in a Table
After you’ve entered the polar equations into the calculator (as
described earlier in this chapter), you can have the calculator
create a table of the values of the polar equations. To create a
table, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the equal sign of those polar equations in the
Y= editor that you want to appear in the table.
Only polar equations defined in the Y= editor with a high-
lighted equal sign will appear in the table. To highlight or
unhighlight an equal sign, press o, use the ~|}Ü keys
to place the cursor on the equal sign in the definition of the
polar equation, and then press Õ to toggle the equal
sign between highlighted and unhighlighted.
2. Press yp to access the Table Setup editor (shown
in Figure 16-12).
Figure 16-12: The Table Setup editor.
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 169
Panning in Polar mode
When you’re tracing a polar equation and the cursor hits an edge of the screen, if
θ is less than θmax and you continue to press ~, the coordinates of the cursor will
be displayed at the bottom of the screen, but the calculator won’t automatically
adjust the viewing window. So you won’t see the cursor on the graph. To rectify this,
make a mental note of the value of θ and then press Õ. The calculator redraws
the graph centered at the location of the cursor at the time you pressed Õ.
Unfortunately, after the graph is redrawn, the trace cursor is placed at the begin-
ning of the first polar equation appearing in the Y= editor and may not appear on
the screen. To get the trace cursor back on the part of the graph displayed in the
new viewing window, key in the value of θ that you made a mental note of, and then
press Õ. Also, if you weren’t tracing the first polar equation appearing in the Y=
editor, use ~ to place the cursor on the graph you were tracing. The trace cursor
then appears in the middle of the screen and you can use ~ to continue tracing
the graph.

3. Enter a number in TblStart and then press Õ.
TblStart is the first value of the independent variable θ to
appear in the table. In Figure 16-12, TblStart is assigned the
value 0.
To enter the number you’ve chosen for TblStart, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your number, and then press Õ.
4. Enter a number in ∆Tbl and then press Õ.
∆Tbl provides the increment for the independent variable
θ. You usually want to set ∆Tbl equal to a small number. In
Figure 16-12, ∆Tbl is assigned the value π/24.
To enter the number you’ve chosen for ∆Tbl, place the
cursor on the number appearing after the equal sign, press
the number keys to enter your number, and then press Õ.
5. Set the mode for Indpnt and Depend.
To change the mode of either Indpnt or Depend, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the desired mode,
either Auto or Ask, and then press Õ.
To have the calculator automatically generate the table for
you, put both Indpnt and Depend in Auto mode. The first
table in Figure 16-13 was constructed in this fashion.
If you want to create a user-defined table in which you
specify which values of the independent variable θ are to
appear in the table and then have the calculator figure out
the corresponding values of the polar equations, put
Indpnt in Ask mode and Depend in Auto mode. How you
construct the table is explained in Step 6. The second table
in Figure 16-13 was constructed in this fashion. 
For a user-defined table, you don’t have to assign values to
TblStart and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor.
The other combinations of mode settings for Indpnt and
Depend are not especially useful when you’re dealing with
polar equations.
Figure 16-13: Tables for polar equations.

6. Press ys to display the table.
When you display the table, the modes you set for
Indpnt and Depend in Step 5 determine what you see
on-screen — and what you can do with the table. Here’s
what you see and what you can do:
• Here’s the scoop for an automatically generated table:
If Indpnt and Depend are both in Auto mode, then when
you press ys, the table is automatically gener-
ated. To display rows in the table beyond the last row on
the screen, repeatedly press Ü until they appear. And
repeatedly press } to display rows above the first row
on the screen. 
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a different
set of rows, it also automatically resets TblStart to the
value of θ appearing in the first row of the newly displayed
table. To return the table to its original state, press
yp to access the Table Setup editor, and then
change the value the calculator assigned to TblStart.
If you’re constructing a table for more than two polar
equations, only the first two will appear on the screen.
To see another the other equations, repeatedly press ~
until they appear. This causes one or more of the first
two equations to disappear. To see them again, repeat-
edly press | until they appear.
• Here’s what you get for a user-generated table:
If you put Indpnt in Ask mode and Depend in Auto
mode so that you can generate your own table, then
when you display the table, it should be empty. If it’s
not, clear the table as described in the next section.
In an empty table, key in the first value of the independ-
ent variable θ you want to appear in the table, and then
press Õ. The corresponding values of the polar
equations automatically appear. Key in the next value of
θ you want in the table and press Õ, and so on. The
values for θ that you place in the first column don’t have
to be in any specific order, nor do they have to be
between θmin and θmax. 
While displaying the table for polar equations, you can edit the def-
inition of the equations without going back to the Y= editor. To do
so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column head-
ing for that polar equation you want to edit and then press Õ.
Edit the definition of the equation (editing expressions is explained
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 171

in Chapter 1) and press Õ when you’re finished. The calculator
automatically updates the table and the definition of the polar
equation in the Y= editor.
The word ERROR appearing in a table indicates that the polar
equation is either undefined or not a real number at the correspon-
ding value of θ.
Clearing a user-defined table
After you’ve created a user-defined table, as described in the 
previous section, you can clear its contents by performing the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Press yp Table Setup editor and then set 
Indpend to Auto.
2. Press ys to display an automatically 
generated table.
3. Press yp and set Indpend back to Ask.
4. Press ys to display an empty table.
An automatically generated table cannot be cleared. To change the
contents of such a table, change the values assigned to TblStart
and ∆Tbl in the Table Setup editor. 
Viewing the table and the graph 
on the same screen
After you’ve graphed your polar equations and created a table for
the polar equations (as described earlier in this chapter), you can
view the graph and the table on the same screen. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in G-T screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on G-T
in the bottom right hand corner of the Mode menu and
press Õ to highlight it (as shown in Figure 16-14).
3. Press s.
After you press s, the graph and the table appear on
the same screen.
Part V: Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
172

Figure 16-14: Setting the mode for viewing a graph and a table.
If you press any key used in graphing polar equations, such as
q or r, the cursor becomes active on the graph side of the
screen. To return the cursor to the table, press ys.
If you press r and then use the ~|}Ü keys to trace the
graph, the value of the independent variable θ corresponding to
the cursor location on the graph will be highlighted in the table
and the column for the polar equation you’re tracing will appear
next to it. If necessary, the calculator updates the table (as shown
in Figure 16-15) so you can see that row in the table. 
Figure 16-15: Using TRACE in Graph-Table mode.
To view the graph or the table in Full-Screen mode, follow 
these steps:
1. Press z.
2. Put the calculator in Full screen mode.
To do so, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on Full
in the lower-left corner of the Mode menu and press Õ
to highlight it.
3. Press s to see the graph, or press ys to see
the table.
Chapter 16: Polar Equations 173

Evaluating Polar Equations
To evaluate a polar equation at a specified value of θ, follow 
these steps:
1. Graph the equation in a viewing window that contains
the specified value of θ.
Graphing polar equations and setting the viewing window
are explained earlier in this chapter. To get a viewing
window containing the specified value of θ, that value must
be between θmin and θmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained earlier in this chapter.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¿ to select the value option.
5. Enter the specified value of θ.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of θ (as in the
first graph in Figure 16-16). If you make a mistake when
entering your number, press ë and re-enter the number.
6. Press Õ.
After you press Õ, the first highlighted polar equation
in the Y= editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor
appears on the graph of that equation at the specified
value of θ, and the coordinates of the cursor appear at the
bottom of the screen. The second graph in Figure 16-16
illustrates this result.
7. Repeatedly press } to see the value of the other graphed
polar equations at your specified value of θ.
Each time you press } the name of the polar equation
being evaluated appears at the top of the screen and the
coordinates of the cursor location appear at the bottom of
the screen, as in the third graph in Figure 16-16.

Chapter 16: Polar Equations 175
If you’re planning to evaluate polar equations at several specified
values of θ, consider constructing a user-defined table.
Finding Derivatives
To find the derivative (dy/dx or dr/dθ) of a polar equation at a spec-
ified value of θ, follow these steps:
1. Graph the polar equation in a viewing window that con-
tains the specified value of θ.
Graphing polar equations and setting the viewing window
are explained earlier in this chapter. To get a viewing
window containing the specified value of θ, that value must
be between θmin and θmax.
2. Set the Format menu to ExprOn and CoordOn.
Setting the Format menu is explained earlier in 
this chapter.
3. Press yr to access the Calculate menu.
4. Press ¡ or ¬ to respectively select the dy/dx or 
dr/dθ option.
5. If necessary, repeatedly press } until the appropriate
polar equation appears at the top of the screen.
This is illustrated in the first graph in Figure 16-17.
6. Enter the specified value of θ.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of θ. As you use
the keypad, θ= replaces the coordinates of the cursor loca-
tion appearing at the bottom of the screen in the previous
step. The number you key in is placed after θ = (as shown
in the second graph in Figure 16-17). If you make a mistake
when entering your number, press ë and re-enter 
the number. 
If you’re interested only in finding the slope of the curve in
a general area of the graph — instead of at a specific value
of θ — then just use the | and ~ to move the cursor to the
desired location on the graph (instead of entering a value
of θ).
7. Press Õ.
After pressing Õ, the derivative is displayed at the
bottom of the screen, as in the third graph in Figure 16-17.

Permutations and Combinations
A permutation, denoted by nPr, answers the question: “From a set
of n different items, how many ways can you select and order
(arrange) r of these items?” A combination, denoted by nCr,
answers the question: “From a set of n different items, how many
ways can you select (independent or order) r of these items?” To
evaluate a permutation or combination, follow these steps:
1. On the Home screen, enter n, the total number of items
in the set. 
If you’re not already on the Home screen, press yz to
exit (quit) the current screen and enter the Home screen.
2. Press ç~~~ to access the Math Probability menu.
3. Press ¡ to evaluate a permutation or press ¬ to evaluate
a combination.
4. Enter r, the number of items selected from the set, and
press Õ to display the result.
Figure 17-1 illustrates this procedure. Notice that the last
two lines in the figure tell you that it’s impossible to select
7 items from a set of only 5 items.

Generating Random Numbers
When generating random numbers, you usually want to generate
numbers that are integers contained in a specified range, or deci-
mal numbers that are strictly between 0 and 1.
Generating random integers
To generate random integers that fall between the integers a and b:

Dealing with Statistical Data
In This Chapter
 Entering data into the calculator
 Deleting and editing data in a data list
 Saving and recalling a data list 
 Sorting data lists
T
he calculator has many features that provide information about
the data that has been entered in the calculator. It can graph it
as a scatter plot, histogram, or box plot. It can calculate the median
and quartiles. It can even find a regression model (curve fitting) for
your data. It can do this and much, much more. This chapter tells
you how to enter your data in the calculator; Chapter 19 shows you
how to use the calculator to analyze that data.
Entering Data
What you use to enter statistical data into the calculator is the Stat
List editor — a relatively large spreadsheet that can accommodate
up to 20 columns (data lists). And each data list (column) can handle
a maximum of 999 entries. Pictures of the Stat List editor appear in
Figure 18-1.
To use stat lists to enter your data into the calculator, follow 
these steps:
1. Press ÖYÕ to execute the SetUpEditor command.
The SetUpEditor command clears all data lists (columns)
from the Stat List editor and replaces them with the six
default lists L1 through L6. Any lists that are cleared from
the editor by this command are still in the memory of the
calculator; they just don’t appear in the Stat List editor.

Part VI: Probability and Statistics 
184
2. Press Ö¿ to enter the Stat List editor.
If no one has ever used the Stat List editor in your calcula-
tor, then the Stat List editor will look like the first picture in
Figure 18-1. If the Stat List editor has been used before,
then some of the default lists L1 through L6 may contain
data, as in the second picture in Figure 18-1. 
Figure 18-1: The Stat List editor.
3. If necessary, clear lists L1 through L6 or create a user-
named list.
The calculator requires that each data set (list) have a
name. You can use the default names L1 through L6, or you
can create your own name for a data list. If you want to
create your own name, the section titled “Creating User-
Named Data Lists” tells you how.
If you want to use one of the default names L1 through L6
for your data list but that list already contains data, then
you must first clear the contents of the list before you
enter new data into it. (The next section, “Deleting and
Editing Data,” tells you how to clear a data list.)
4. Enter your data. Press Õ after each entry.
Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor in the column
where you want to make an entry. Use the keypad to enter
your number and press Õ when you’re finished. A
column (list) can accommodate up to 999 entries.
To quickly enter data that follows a sequential pattern (such as 1,
2, 3, ..., 100 or 1, 4, 9, 25, ..., 1600, or 10, 20, ..., 200), see the section
titled “Using Formulas to Enter Data.”
Deleting and Editing Data
Sooner or later you’ll have to remove or modify the data that you’ve
placed in a data list. The following list shows you how to do so.
Empty lists
Lists with data

Chapter 18: Dealing with Statistical Data 185
 Deleting a data list from the memory of the calculator:
To permanently remove a data list from the memory of the cal-
culator, press yj¡ to enter the Memory Management menu.
Then press W to see the data lists that are stored in memory.
Use Ü to move the indicator to the list you want to delete, and
then press { to delete that list. When you’re finished deleting
lists from memory, press yz to exit (quit) the Memory
Management menu and return to the Home screen.
Although the calculator does allow you to delete a default list
(L1 through L6) from memory, in reality it deletes only the con-
tents of the list and not its name.
 Clearing the contents of a data list:
When you clear a data list, the list’s contents (and not its
name) will be erased leaving an empty data list in the calcula-
tor’s memory. To clear the contents of a data list in the Stat
List editor, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the
name of a list appearing in a column heading, and then press
ëÕ.
 Deleting a column (list) in the Stat list editor:
To delete a column (list) from the Stat List editor, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the name of the list
appearing in the column headings and then press {. The list
will be removed from the Stat List editor but not from the
memory of the calculator.
 Deleting an entry in a data list:
To delete an entry from a data list, use the ~|}Ü keys to
place the cursor on that entry, and then press { to delete
the entry from the list.
 Editing an entry in a data list:
To edit an entry in a data list, use the ~|}Ü keys to place
the cursor on that entry, press Õ, and then edit the entry
or key in a new entry. If you key in the new entry, the old
entry is automatically erased. Press Õ when you’re fin-
ished editing or replacing the old entry.
Creating User-Named Data Lists
To name a data list in the Stat List editor, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press Ö¿ to enter the Stat List editor. 

2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column
heading where you want your user-named list to appear.
Your user-named list is created in a new column that
appears to the left of the column highlighted by the cursor
(as shown in the first picture in Figure 18-2).
3. Press y{ to insert the new column.
The second picture in Figure 18-2 shows this procedure.
4. Enter the name of your data list and press Õ.
The name you give your data list can consist of one to five
characters that must be letters, numbers, or the Greek letter
θ. The first character in the name must be a letter or θ.
The ÿ after Name = indicates that the calculator is in Alpha
mode. In this mode, when you press a key you enter the
green letter above the key. To enter a number, exit the
mode by pressing É again and then enter the number.
To enter a letter after entering a number, you must press
É to put the calculator back in Alpha mode (as in the
third picture in Figure 18-2). Press Õ when you’re fin-
ished entering the name.
Figure 18-2: Steps for creating a user-named data list.
If the name you give your data list is the name of a data list stored
in memory, then after entering that name and pressing Õ, the
data in the list stored in memory will be automatically entered in
the Stat List editor.
After you have named your data list, you can press Ü and start
entering your data. Or, if appropriate, you can use a formula to gen-
erate the data. (See the next section, “Using Formulas to Enter
Data.”) And if the data you want to put in the newly named list is in
another column of the Stat List editor — or in a list stored in

memory under another name — you can paste that data into your
newly named list. (See the section called “Saving and Recalling
Data Lists,” later in this chapter.)
Using Formulas to Enter Data
Figure 18-3 illustrates how you would place the sequence 10, 20, ...,
200 in list L1. The formula used in this example is simply x. The ini-
tial and terminal values of x are naturally 10 and 200, respectively.
And, as you may guess, x is incremented by 10. 
To use a formula to define your data:
1. If necessary, press Ö¿ to enter the Stat List editor. 
2. Use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the column
heading where you want your data to appear and press
Õ.
3. Press yÖ~Y to access the seq command.
4. Enter your formula as a function of a single variable, press
À, and then enter the name of the variable and press À.
The first picture in Figure 18-3 shows this process; here the
formula is x and the variable is x.
5. Enter the initial value of your variable, press À, enter
the terminal value of your variable, press À, enter the
increment for the variable, and then press §. 
The second picture in Figure 18-3 shows this process.
6. Press Õ to enter your data in the calculator.
This procedure is shown in the third picture in Figure 18-3.

Chapter 18: Dealing with Statistical Data 187

Saving and Recalling Data Lists
Saving your data lists is the first step in the direction of calling
them up again when you want to use or change them. The follow-
ing list shows you how to do so:
 Saving data lists:
After you enter data into the Stat List editor, that data is auto-
matically stored in the memory of the calculator under the list
name that appears as the column heading for that list. You
don’t have to take any further steps to ensure that the calcula-
tor saves your data. However, if you clear the contents of a
data list (as described in the section titled “Deleting and
Editing Data”), the calculator retains the name of the data list
in memory but deletes the contents of that list.
If you’ve entered your data in one of the default lists L1
through L6 and would like to save it as a named list, first
create a user-named data list; you should get a result that
resembles the first picture in Figure 18-4. Then press Õy
and press the number key for your data list (as in the second
picture in Figure 18-4). Finally, press Õ to insert the data
in the default data list into the newly named data list. The
third picture in Figure 18-4 shows this process.
Figure 18-4: Steps for copying data from one list to another.
 Recalling data lists:
You can use the SetUpEditor command to set up the Stat List
editor with the data lists you specify. To do this press ÖY
to invoke the SetUpEditor command. Enter the names of the
data lists, separated by commas. Then press ÕÖ¿ to
see the data lists (as shown in Figure 18-5).
If you’re already in the Stat List editor, you can recall a saved
data list by creating a data list that has the same name as the
saved data list. (For pointers on how to do so, see the section
of this chapter called “Creating User-Named Data Lists.”)
Create named list
Enter default list
Press Õ
Part VI: Probability and Statistics 
188

Figure 18-5: Recalling saved data lists.
You can save a data list on your PC and then recall it at a later
date. (Chapter 22 tells you how.) You can also transfer a data list
from one calculator to another, as described in Chapter 23.
Sorting Data Lists
To sort data lists, follow these steps:
1. Press Ö.
2. Press ¡ to sort the list in ascending order, or press ¬ to
sort it in descending order.
3. Enter the list name.
To sort a default named list such as L1, press y¿ to enter
its name. If you’re sorting a user-named list, first press
yÖ~}Õ to insert the letter L and then enter the
name of the list. Inserting the letter L tells the calculator
that what follows this letter is a data list, as shown in the
first line in the first picture in Figure 18-6.
If you want to sort rows according to the contents of the
data list you entered in Step 3, then (after completing Step 3)
enter the names of the other lists, separated by commas. For
example, the third line in the first picture in Figure 18-6 is the
command needed to rearrange the rows in Figure 18-5 so the
data in the second column is in ascending order.
4. Press §Õ to sort the list, then press Ö¿ to view
the sorted list.
The second picture in Figure 18-6 shows the rows in 
Figure 18-5 rearranged so the second column is in ascend-
ing order.

n descriptive statistical analysis, you usually want to plot your
data and find the mean, median, standard deviation, and so on.
You may also want to find a regression model for your data (a
process also called curve fitting). This chapter tells you how to get
the calculator to do these things for you.
Plotting One-Variable Data
The most common plots used to graph one-variable data are his-
tograms and box plots. In a histogram, the data is grouped into
classes of equal size; a bar in the histogram represents one class.
The height of the bar represents the quantity of data contained in
that class, as in the first picture in Figure 19-1.
A box plot (as in the second picture in Figure 19-1) consists of a
box-with-whiskers. The box represents the data existing between
the first and third quartiles. The box is divided into two parts, with
the division line defined by the median of the data. The whiskers
represent the locations of the minimum and maximum data points.

Figure 19-1: One-variable statistical plots.
Constructing a histogram
To construct a histogram of your data, follow these steps:
1. Store your data in the calculator.
Entering data in the calculator is described in Chapter 18.
Your data does not have to appear in the Stat List editor to
plot it, but it does have to be in the memory of the calculator. 
2. Turn off any Stat Plots or functions in the Y= editor that
you don’t want to be graphed along with your histogram.
To do so, press o to access the Y= editor. The calculator
graphs any highlighted Plots in the first line of this editor.
To unhighlight a Plot so it won’t be graphed, use the
~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the on the Plot and
then press Õ to toggle the Plot between highlighted
and unhighlighted.
The calculator graphs only those functions in the Y= editor
defined by a highlighted equal sign. To unhighlight an equal
sign, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the equal
sign in the definition of the function, and then press Õ to
toggle the equal sign between highlighted and unhighlighted.
3. Press yo to access the Stat Plots menu and enter the
number (1, 2, or 3) of the plot you want to define.
The first picture in Figure 19-2 shows this process, where
Plot1 is used to plot the data.
4. Highlight On or Off.
If On is highlighted, the calculator plots your data. If you
want your data to be plotted at a later time, highlight Off.
To highlight an option, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the
cursor on the option, and then press Õ.

Part VI: Probability and Statistics 
192

Figure 19-2: Steps for creating a histogram.
5. Press Ü, use ~ to place the cursor on the type of plot you
want to create, and then press Õ to highlight it.
Select “ to construct a histogram.
6. Press Ü, enter the name of your data list (Xlist), and
press Õ.
If your data is stored in one of the default lists L1 through
L6, press y, key in the number of the list, and then press
Õ. For example, press y¿ if your data is stored in L1.
If your data is stored in a user-named list, key in the name
of the list and press Õ when you’re finished. Notice (as
in Figure 19-2) that the calculator is already in Alpha mode,
waiting for the first letter in the name of your list.
7. Enter the frequency of your data.
If you entered your data without paying attention to dupli-
cate data values, then the frequency is 1. On the other hand,
if you did pay attention to duplicate data values, you most
likely stored the frequency in another data list. If so, enter the
name of that list the same way you entered the Xlist in Step 6.
8. Press qÆ to plot your data using the ZoomStat 
command.
ZoomStat finds an appropriate viewing window for plotting
your data, as in the third picture in Figure 19-2. The next step
shows you how to redefine the class size in a histogram.
9. Press p, set Xscl equal to the class size you desire,
and then press s.
The class size (Xscl) must be ≥(Xmax – Xmin)/47. If it isn’t,
you get the ERR: STAT error message.
10. If necessary, adjust the settings in the Window editor.
The data plotted in Figure 19-2 consists of test scores. For
such data, you naturally want the class size (Xscl) to be 10.
But when the histogram is regraphed using this class size
(as in the first picture in Figure 19-3), the viewing window
Select plot number
Define plot
Press q Æ
Chapter 19: Analyzing Statistical Data 193

doesn’t accommodate the histogram. To correct this,
adjust the settings in the Window editor (as described in
Chapter 9). The second picture in Figure 19-3 shows the
result of adjusting these settings.
Figure 19-3: Steps for defining the class size in a histogram.
Constructing a box plot
To construct a box plot for your data, follow Steps 1 through 8 for
constructing a histogram. In Step 5, select the Box Plot symbol ÷.
If you adjust the viewing window as explained in Chapter 9, you
can display a histogram and a box plot in the same viewing
window (as shown in the first picture in Figure 19-4).
Figure 19-4: A box plot with a histogram and with a modified box plot.
If your data has outliers, consider constructing a modified box plot
instead of a box plot. Figure 19-4 illustrates both a standard box
plot and a modified box plot of the same data (in the second pic-
ture). In a modified box plot, the whiskers represent data in the
range defined by 1.5(Q3 – Q1), and the outliers are plotted as
points beyond the whiskers. The steps for constructing box plots
and modified box plots are the same, except in Step 5 you select
the modified box plot symbol ’.

Plotting Two-Variable Data
The most common plots used to graph two-variable data sets are the
scatter plot and the xy-line plot. The scatter plot plots the points (x, y)
where x is a value from one data list (Xlist) and y is the correspon-
ding value from the other data list (Ylist). The xy-line plot is simply a
scatter plot with consecutive points joined by a straight line.
To construct a scatter or xy-line plot, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 6 in the previous subsection
(“Constructing a histogram”) with the following difference:
In Step 5, highlight % to construct a scatter plot or high-
light ” to construct an xy-line plot.
2. Enter the name of your Ylist and press Õ.
3. Choose the type of mark used to plot points.
You have three choices: a small square, a small plus sign,
or a dot. To select one, use ~ to place the cursor on the
mark and then press Õ.
4. Press qÆ to plot your data using the ZoomStat 
command.
ZoomStat finds an appropriate viewing window for plotting
your data. This is illustrated in Figure 19-5.
Figure 19-5: Two-variable statistical plots.
Tracing Statistical Data Plots
Before tracing a statistical data plot, press yq and, if neces-
sary, highlight the CoordOn in the second line of the Format menu
Scatter plot
xy-line plot
Chapter 19: Analyzing Statistical Data 195

and highlight ExprOn in the last line. This allows you to see the
name of the data set being traced and the location of the cursor. To
highlight an entry, use the ~|}Ü keys to place the cursor on the
entry and then press Õ.
To trace a statistical data plot, press r. In the upper left hand
corner of the screen you see the Stat Plot number (P1, P2, or P3)
and the name(s) of the data list(s) being traced. If you have more
than one stat plot on the screen, repeatedly press } until the plot
you want to trace appears in the upper-left corner of the screen.
Use the ~| keys to trace the plot. What you see depends on the
type of plot.
 Tracing a histogram: As you trace a histogram, the cursor
moves from the top center of one bar to the top center of the
next bar. At the bottom of the screen you see the values of
min, max, and n. This tells you that there are n data points x
such that min ≤x < max. This is illustrated in the first picture
in Figure 19-6.
 Tracing a box plot: As you trace a box plot from left to right,
the values that appear at the bottom of the screen are minX
(the minimum data value), Q1 (the value of the first quartile),
Med (the value of the median), Q3 (the value of the third
quartile, and maxX (the maximum data value). This is illus-
trated in the second picture in Figure 19-6.
 Tracing a modified box plot: As you trace a modified box plot
from left to right, the values that appear at the bottom of the
screen are minX (the minimum data value), and then you see
the values of the other outliers, if any, to the left of the interval
defined by 1.5(Q3 – Q1). The next value you see at the bottom of
the screen is the value of the left bound of the interval defined
by 1.5(Q3 – Q1). Then, as with a box plot, you see the values of
the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile. After that
you see the value of the right bound of the interval defined by
1.5(Q3 – Q1), the outliers to the right of this, if any, and finally
you see maxX (the maximum data value).
 Tracing a scatter or xy-line plot: As you trace a scatter plot
or an xy-line plot, the coordinates of the cursor location
appear at the bottom of the screen. As shown in Figure 19-6,
the x-coordinate is a data value for the first data list named at
the top of the screen; the y-coordinate is the corresponding
data value from the second data list named at the top of the
screen.

Analyzing Statistical Data
The calculator can perform one- and two-variable statistical data
analysis. For one-variable data analysis, the statistical data vari-
able is denoted by x. For two-variable data analysis, the data vari-
able for the first data list is denoted by x and the data variable for
the second data list is denoted by y. Table 19-1 lists the variables
calculated using one-variable data analysis (1-Var), as well as those
calculated using two-variable analysis (2-Var).

One-variable data analysis
To analyze one-variable data, follow these steps:
1. Store your data in the calculator.
Entering data in the calculator is described in the previous
chapter. Your data does not have to appear in the Stat List
editor to analyze it, but it does have to be in the memory of
the calculator. 
2. Press Ö~¿ to select the 1-Var Stats command from
the Stat Calculate menu.
3. Enter the name of your data list (Xlist).
If your data is stored in one of the default lists L1 through
L6, press y, key in the number of the list, and then press
Õ. For example, press y¿ if your data is stored in L1.
If your data is stored in a user-named list, first press
yÖ~}Õ to insert the letter L and then enter the
name of the list. Inserting the letter L tells the calculator
that what follows this letter is a data list. To enter the name
of the list, use the É key to insert letters (as shown in
the first picture of Figure 19-7).
4. If necessary, enter the name of the frequency list.
If the frequency of your data is 1, you can skip this step and
go to the next step. If, however, you stored the frequency in
another data list, press ¢ and then enter the name of that
frequency list (just as you entered the Xlist in Step 3). The
second picture in Figure 19-7 shows this process.
5. Press Õ to view the analysis of your data.
This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 19-7. Use 
the Ü} keys to view the other values that don’t appear on
the screen.

Two-variable data analysis
To analyze two-variable data, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the previous subsection (“One-
variable data analysis”) with the following difference:
In Step 2, press Ö~¡ to select the 2-Var Stats command.
2. Press ¢ and enter the name of the Ylist.
3. Follow Steps 4 and 5 in the previous subsection (“One-
variable data analysis”).
Regression Models
Regression modeling is the process of finding a function that
approximates the relationship between the two variables in two
data lists. (An example appears in Figure 19-8, where a straight line
approximates the relationship between the lists.) Table 19-2 shows
the types of regression models the calculator can compute.

To compute a regression model for your two-variable data, follow
these steps:
1. If necessary, turn on Diagnostics.
When the Diagnostics command is turned on, the calcula-
tor displays the correlation coefficient (r) and the coeffi-
cient of determination (r2 or R2) for appropriate regression
models (as shown in the second picture in Figure 19-8). By
default, this command is turned off. After you turn this
command on, it stays on until you turn it off. Here’s how to
turn on Diagnostics:
a. Press y)ó to access the Catalog menu and to
advance the Catalog to the entries beginning with
the letter D. 
b. Repeatedly press Ü to advance the Catalog indica-
tor to the DiagnosticOn command. 
c. Press Õ to paste this command on the Home
screen, and press Õ again to execute this
command. 
The first picture in Figure 19-8 shows this procedure.
2. If necessary, put the calculator in Function (Func) mode.
If the regression model is a function that you want to
graph, you must first put the calculator in Function mode.
(Setting the mode is explained in Chapter 1.)
3. If you haven’t already done so, graph your two-variable
data in a scatter or xy-line plot.
An earlier section of this chapter (“Plotting Two-Variable
Data”) explains how to do so.
4. Select a regression model from the Stat Calculate menu.
To do so, press Ö~ to access the Stat Calculate menu.
Repeatedly press Ü until the number or letter of the
desired regression model is highlighted, and press Õ to
select that model. 
5. Enter the name for the Xlist data, press ¢, and then enter
the name of the Ylist data.
The appropriate format for entering list names is explained
in Step 3 in the earlier subsection called “One-variable 
data analysis.”
Part VI: Probability and Statistics 
200

6. If necessary, enter the name of the frequency list.
To determine whether to enter a frequency list, see Step 4
in the subsection earlier section called “One-variable data
analysis.”
7. Press ¢ and enter the name of the function (Y1, ... , Y9, or
Y0) in which the regression model is to be stored.
To enter a function name, press ê~¿ and then enter the
number of the function (as in the first picture in Figure 19-8).
8. Press Õ to calculate and view the equation of the
regression model.
This is illustrated in the second picture in Figure 19-8. The
equation of the regression model is automatically stored in
the Y= editor under the name you entered in Step 7.

Dealing with
Matrices

In this part...
I
n this part, I show you how to use matrices in arith-
metic expressions and how to ﬁnd the inverse, trans-
pose, and determinant of a matrix. I also show you how 
to use matrices to solve a system of linear equations.

Matrices
In This Chapter
 Defining a matrix
 Editing a matrix
 Displaying the contents of a matrix
 Augmenting two matrices
 Copying one matrix to another matrix
 Deleting a matrix from the memory of the calculator
A
matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and
columns. With matrices, a system of equations can be easily
manipulated or solved. The dimensions, r × c, of a matrix are defined
by the number of rows and columns in the matrix. The calculator
allows you to define up to ten matrices. Each matrix can have dimen-
sions of up to 99 × 99 and can contain only real-number entries.
Defining a Matrix
To define a matrix, follow these steps:
1. Press yó~~ to enter the Matrix editor menu. (On the
TI-83, press é~~.)
The first picture in Figure 20-1 shows the names of matrices
used by the calculator. The dimensions appearing to the
right of the first two matrices in this picture indicate that
these two matrices have already been defined and are
stored in the memory of the calculator.

2. Key in the number (1 through 9, or 0) of the matrix you
want to define or redefine. 
If you select an already-defined matrix, the following steps
redefine that matrix by overwriting any existing entries.
The redefined matrix replaces the original matrix in the
memory of the calculator.
If all ten matrices in the Matrix editor are defined and you
don’t want to sacrifice any of them in order to define a new
matrix, consider saving some of the already-defined matri-
ces on your PC. Chapter 22 tells you how to do so.
3. Enter the dimensions of the matrix. Press Õ after
each entry.
The dimensions, r × c, of a matrix indicate the number of
rows and columns in the matrix. The number of rows is
entered first. 
4. Enter the elements in the matrix. Press Õ after 
each entry.
The calculator enters elements one row at a time. When
you press Õ after entering the last element in the first
row, the calculator moves to the beginning of the second
row and waits for you to make another entry.
Before accepting an entry, the calculator displays the row
and column of the entry at the bottom of the screen. It also
displays the value assigned to that entry. To change that
value, just key in the new value and press Õ. The new
value can also be entered as an arithmetic expression such
as 92 + 7. To leave that value as it is, just press Õ, as in
the second picture in Figure 20-1. 
5. When you’re finished defining your matrix, press yz
to exit the Matrix editor and return to the Home screen. 
Figure 20-1: Steps for defining a matrix.
Select matrix

Part VII: Dealing with Matrices 
206

Editing a Matrix
To edit an already-defined matrix, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the previous section.
2. Use the ~|}Ü to place the cursor on the entry to 
be edited.
3. Key in the new number and press Õ.
4. When you’re finished editing your matrix, press yz to
exit (quit) the Matrix editor and return to the Home screen.
Displaying Matrices
To display a matrix on the Home screen, first press yz to
access the Home screen. Then press yó and enter the number
of the matrix to be displayed. (On the TI-83, press é.) Finally,
press Õ to display the matrix, as in the first two pictures in
Figure 20-2. If the Home screen isn’t large enough to contain the
whole matrix, use the ~|}Ü keys to view the missing elements. 
To view the contents of a matrix in the Matrix editor instead of on
the Home screen, follow the first two steps in the “Defining a
Matrix” section at the beginning of this chapter.
Augmenting Two Matrices
Augmenting two matrices allows you to append one matrix to
another matrix. Both matrices must be defined and have the same
number of rows. To augment two matrices, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
2. Press yó~¨ to select the augment command from the
Matrix Math menu. (On the TI-83, press é~¨.)
3. Enter the name of the first matrix and then press ¢.
The first matrix is the matrix that appears on the left in the
augmented matrix. To enter its name, press yó and key
in the number of the matrix name. (On the TI-83, press
é.) This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 20-2.
4. Enter the name of the second matrix and then press §.
Chapter 20: Creating and Editing Matrices 207

5. Store the augmented matrix under a specified 
matrix name.
To do so press ø, enter the name of the matrix in 
which you plan to store the augmented matrix, and then
press Õ.
Figure 20-2: Augmenting two matrices.
Copying One Matrix to Another
There are several situations in which you may want to copy the
contents of one matrix to another. One of these is when you want
to define a new matrix by adding rows and columns to an existing
matrix. To do so, copy the existing matrix to a new matrix and then
redefine the new matrix to have the number of rows and columns
you desire. Defining and redefining matrices is described in the
first section of this chapter.
To copy one matrix to another matrix, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
2. Press yó and key in the number of the matrix you
plan to copy. (On the TI-83, é.)
3. Press ø.
4. Press yó and key in the number of the matrix that will
house the copy. (On the TI-83, é.)
If you copy the contents of a matrix to another matrix, the
contents of that other matrix will be erased and replaced
with the contents of the matrix you’re copying. If all ten
matrices in the Matrix editor are defined and you don’t
want to sacrifice any of them in order to make a copy of a

Matrix Arithmetic
When evaluating arithmetic expressions that involve matrices, 
you usually want to perform the following basic operations: scalar
multiplication, negation (additive inverse), addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and inversion (multiplicative inverse). You may 
also want to raise a matrix to an integral power or find its trans-
pose. And you may want to use the identity matrix in an arithmetic
expression.
Here’s how you enter matrix operations in an arithmetic expression:
1. Define the matrices in the Matrix editor.
This operation is explained in the first section of Chapter 20.
2. Press yz to access the Home screen.
All matrix operations are performed on the Home screen.
3. If you want to clear the Home screen, repeatedly press
ë.
4. Enter the operations you want to perform and press
Õ when you’re finished.
As with algebraic expressions, the Home screen is where
you evaluate arithmetic expressions that involve matrices.
To paste the name of a matrix into an expression, press
yó and key in the number of the matrix name. (On the

TI-83, press é.) Here’s how you enter the various oper-
ations into the arithmetic expression:
• Entering the scalar multiple of a matrix:
To enter the scalar multiple of a matrix in an arithmetic
expression, enter the value of the scalar and then enter
the name of the matrix as shown in the first picture in
Figure 21-1. 
• Negating a matrix:
To negate a matrix, press Ã and then enter the name of
the matrix as shown in the second picture in Figure 21-1.
Figure 21-1: The scalar multiple and the negation of a matrix.
• Entering the identity matrix:
You don’t have to define an identity matrix in the Matrix
editor in order to use it in an algebraic expression. To
enter an identity matrix in an expression, press
yó~Y to select the identity command from the
Matrix Math menu. (On the TI-83, press é~Y.)
Then enter the size of the identity matrix. For example,
enter 2 for the 2 × 2 identity matrix, as in the first picture
in Figure 21-2.
• Adding or subtracting matrices:
When adding or subtracting matrices, the matrices must
have the same dimensions. If they don’t, you will get the
ERR: DIM MISMATCH error message.
Entering the addition and subtraction of matrices is
straightforward; just combine the matrices by pressing j
or c, as appropriate. The second picture in Figure 21-2
illustrates this process.

Negation
Part VII: Dealing with Matrices 
212

Figure 21-2: The identity matrix and addition/subtraction of matrices.
• Multiplying two matrices:
When finding the product A*B of two matrices, the
number of columns in the first matrix A must equal the
number or rows in the second matrix B. If this condition
isn’t satisfied, you will get the ERR: DIM MISMATCH error
message.
The multiplication of matrices is straightforward; just
indicate the product by using juxtaposition by pressing
Ø, as in the first picture in Figure 21-3.
• Finding the inverse of a matrix:
When finding the inverse of a matrix, the matrix must be
square (number of rows = number of columns) and non-
singular (nonzero determinant). If it is not square, you
will get the ERR: INVALID DIM error message. If it is sin-
gular (determinant = 0), you will get the ERR: SINGULAR
MAT error message. Evaluating the determinant of a
matrix is explained in the next section.
Entering the inverse of a matrix is straightforward; just
enter the name of the matrix and then press ó, as in
the second picture of Figure 21-3.
• Raising a matrix to a positive integral power:
When finding the power of a matrix, the matrix must be
square. If it isn’t, you will get the ERR: INVALID DIM error
message.
Only non-negative integers can be used for the power of
a matrix. If the exponent isn’t a nonnegative integer, you
will get the ERR: DATA TYPE error message. If you raise a
square matrix to the zero power, you will get the identity
matrix.
Identity matrix
Adding and subtracting
Chapter 21: Using Matrices 213

To raise a square matrix to a negative power, raise 
the inverse of the matrix to the corresponding 
positive power.
Entering the positive power of a matrix is straightfor-
ward; just enter the name of the matrix, press õ, and
enter the power, as in the third picture of Figure 21-3.
Figure 21-3: The product and powers of matrices.
• Transposing of a matrix:
To transpose a matrix in an arithmetic expression, enter
the name of the matrix and then press yó~¡ to
select the Transpose command from the Matrix Math
menu (on the TI-83, press é~¡.), as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 21-4.
Finding the Determinant
When finding the determinant of a matrix, the matrix must be
square (number of rows = number of columns). If it isn’t, you get
the ERR: INVALID DIM error message.
To evaluate the determinant of a matrix, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press yz to access the Home screen.
2. Press yó~¿ to select the det command from the
Matrix Math menu. (On the TI-83, press é~¿.)
3. Enter the name of the matrix and then press §.
To enter the name of the matrix, press yó and key in the
number of the matrix name. (On the TI-83, press é.)
4. Press Õ to evaluate the determinant.
This procedure is illustrated in the second picture in 
Figure 21-4.

Systems of linear equations can be solved by first putting the aug-
mented matrix for the system in reduced row-echelon form. The
mathematical definition of reduced row-echelon form isn’t impor-
tant here. It is simply an equivalent form of the original system of
equations, which, when converted back to a system of equations,
gives you the solutions (if any) to the original system of equations.
For example, when the reduced row-echelon matrix in the first pic-
ture in Figure 21-5 is converted to a system of equations, it gives
the solutions x = -3, y = 3, and z = 9. The matrix in the second pic-
ture in Figure 21-5 converts to the system x – z = 0 and y – z = -2.
This arrangement indicates that the system has an infinite number
of solutions — namely, all solutions in which x = z and y = z – 2,
where z is any real number. The third picture in Figure 21-5 illus-
trates a system that has no solution — the last line of the matrix
says that 0 = 1, which is clearly impossible!

To solve a system of equations, follow these steps:
1. Define the augmented matrix in the Matrix editor.
The augmented matrix for the system of equations is
explained at the beginning of this section. (Chapter 20
explains how to define a matrix in the Matrix editor.)
You can define the coefficient and solution matrices for the
system of equations and then augment these matrices to
form the augmented matrix. (For more about augmenting
matrices, see Chapter 20.)
2. Press yz to access the Home screen.
3. Press yó~Éå to select the rref command. (On
the TI-83, press é~Éé.)
You can also select the rref command by pressing yó~
(é~ on the TI-83), repeatedly pressing Ü until the
cursor is next to the rref command, and then pressing Õ.
4. Enter the name of the matrix and then press §.
To enter the name of the matrix, press yó and key in the
number of the matrix name. (On the TI-83, press é.)
5. Press Õ to put the augmented matrix in reduced row-
echelon form.
6. To find the solutions (if any) to the original system of
equations, convert the reduced row-echelon matrix to a
system of equations.
The beginning of this section describes converting a
reduced row-echelon matrix to a system of equations.

In This Chapter
 Downloading the TI Connect software
 Installing and running the TI Connect software
 Connecting your calculator to your computer
 Transferring files between your calculator and your computer
 Upgrading the calculator’s operating system
You need two things to enable your calculator to communicate
with your computer: TI Connect (software) and a TI-Graph
Link cable. TI Connect is free; the TI-Graph Link cable isn’t. If it
didn’t come with your calculator, it can be purchased at the Texas
Instruments online store at www.education.ti.com. 
Downloading TI Connect
The TI Connect software is on the TI Resource CD that most likely
came with your calculator. However, the version on this CD may
not be current. The following steps tell you how to download the
current version of TI Connect from the Texas Instruments Web site,
as it existed at the time this book was published:
1. Go to the Texas Instruments Web site at www.education.
ti.com.
2. Click support at the top of the screen.
3. Click latest apps, software & operating system.
4. Click TI Connect.
5. Click downloads in the column to the left of the page.
6. Click the type of computer you use, Windows or Macintosh.

7. Click the FTP version of TI Connect.
8. Follow the directions given during the downloading
process. Make a note of the directory in which you save
the download file.
After you accept the License Agreement, you may be asked
to log in. If you’re not a member of the site, sign up — 
it’s free.
Installing and Running TI Connect
After you’ve downloaded TI Connect, you install it by double-
clicking the downloaded TI Connect file you saved in your computer.
Then follow the directions given by the installation program you
just launched.
After you start the TI Connect program, you see the many subpro-
grams it contains. To see what these subprograms are used for,
click the HELP button in the lower-right corner of the screen. In
this chapter, I explain how to use TI Device Explorer to transfer
files between your calculator and your PC.
Each of the subprograms housed in TI Connect have excellent Help
menus that tell you exactly how to use the program.
Connecting Calculator and PC
You use the TI-Graph Link cable to connect your calculator to your
computer. If you don’t already have a TI-Graph Link cable, you 
can purchase one at the Texas Instruments online store at www.
education.ti.com.
The TI-Graph Link cable comes in two flavors: serial or USB. Connect
the serial or USB end of the cable to your computer and connect the
other end to your calculator. The port for connecting the TI-Graph
Link to the calculator is at the bottom of the calculator.
Transferring Files
After you’ve connected the calculator to your computer, the TI
Device Explorer program housed in TI Connect can transfer files
between the two devices. This allows you to archive calculator
files on your computer. 
Part VIII: Communicating with PCs and Other Calculators
220

To transfer files between your calculator and PC, start the TI
Connect software and click the TI Device Explorer program. A
directory appears, listing the files on your computer. Expanding
this directory works the same as on your computer. When transfer-
ring files, you’re usually interested in transferring the files housed
in the following directories: Graph Database, List, Matrix, Picture,
and Program. If any of these directories don’t appear on-screen,
that means no files are housed in that directory.
To copy or move files from your calculator to your PC, highlight the
files you want to transfer, click Action, and select either Copy to PC
or Move to PC. When the Browse for Folder window appears, select
the location to which your files will be transferred and click OK.
To copy files to the calculator from a PC running Windows, you
don’t need to be in the TI Device Explorer program. Just open
Windows Explorer, highlight the files you want to copy, right-click
the highlighted files, select Send To, and click Connected TI
Device. When asked if you want the files sent to RAM or Archive,
select RAM. Files stored in the Archive memory of the calculator
cannot be executed or edited. Directions for transferring files from
a Macintosh to the calculator can be found in the TI Device
Explorer Help menu. 
The Help menu in TI Device Explorer is packed with useful informa-
tion. In it you will find directions for editing and deleting calculator
files and directions for backing up all files on your calculator.
Upgrading the OS
The TI-83 Plus and the TI-84 use Flash technology; the TI-83 does
not. Flash technology allows you to upgrade the operating system of
the calculator and to add application programs to your calculator.
Texas Instruments periodically upgrades the operating systems of
the TI-83 Plus and the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition. To perform this
upgrade, start the TI Connect software and click the TI Device
Explorer program. Click the Help menu at the top of the screen and
select TI Device Explorer Help. Click Upgrading the device oper-
ating system and follow the on-screen directions.

In This Chapter
 Linking calculators so files can be transferred between them
 Determining what files can be transferred
 Selecting files to be transferred
 Transferring files between calculators
You can transfer data lists, programs, matrices, and other such
files from one calculator to another if you link the calculators
via the unit-to-unit link cable that came with your calculator. This
chapter describes how to make such transfers.
Linking Calculators
Calculators are linked using the unit-to-unit link cable that came
with the calculator. If you’re no longer in possession of the cable,
you can purchase one at the Texas Instruments online store at
www.education.ti.com.
The unit-to-unit link cable connects to the calculator at the port at
the bottom of the calculator. Push the cable into the port until you
hear it click in place.
If you get the Error in Xmit error message when transferring files
from one calculator to another, the most likely cause is a unit-to-
unit link cable that wasn’t fully inserted into the calculator port.

Transferring Files
If your calculators are the same, you can transfer anything
between them. And you can transfer anything between a TI-83 Plus
and a TI-83 Plus Silver Edition. You can also transfer anything from
a TI-83 to the TI-83 Plus and the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition. But
because the TI-83 is not endowed with Flash technology, you
cannot transfer applications from a TI-83 Plus or TI-83 Plus Silver
Edition to a TI-83. 
After connecting two calculators, you can transfer files from one
calculator (the sending calculator) to another (the receiving calcu-
lator). To select and send files, follow these steps:
1. Press yÑ on the sending calculator to access the
Link Send menu. 
The Link Send menu appears in the first picture in 
Figure 23-1.
2. Use Ü} to select the type of file you want to send, and
then press Õ.
The first picture in Figure 23-1 shows the types of files you
can send. The down arrow visible after number 7 in this list
of menu items indicates that there are more menu items
than can be displayed on-screen. Repeatedly press Ü to
view these other menu items.
If you want to send all files on the calculator to another 
calculator, select All+ and proceed to Step 4. (This option
cannot be used when transferring files from a TI-83 Plus to
a TI-83.)
3. Use Ü} to move the cursor to a file you want to send
and press Õ to select that file. Repeat this process
until you have selected all the files in this list that you
want to send to another calculator.
The calculator places a small square next to the files you
select, as in the second picture of Figure 23-1. In this pic-
ture, lists L1, L2, and L3 are selected in the List Select menu.
4. On the receiving calculator press yÑ~Õ.
You see a screen that says waiting, and in its upper-right
corner, a moving broken line indicates that the receiving
calculator is waiting to receive files.
Always put the receiving calculator in Receiving mode
before you transfer files from the sending calculator.
Part VIII: Communicating with PCs and Other Calculators 
224

Figure 23-1: Selecting files for transmission between calculators.
5. On the sending calculator press ~Õ to send the files
to the receiving calculator.
As files are transferred, you may receive the
DuplicateName menu, as illustrated in the first picture of
Figure 23-2. This indicates that the receiving calculator
already contains a file with the same name. Because the
default names for stat lists are stored in the calculator, you
always get this message when transferring a list, even if the
list on the receiving calculator is empty.
When you get the DuplicateName menu, select the appro-
priate course of action:
• If you select Overwrite, any data in the existing file is
overwritten by the data in the file being transferred.
• If you select Rename, a new file is created and stored
under the name you specify, as in the second picture in
Figure 23-2. 
The ÿ after Name = indicates that the calculator is in Alpha
mode: When you press a key, what you enter is the green
letter above the key. To enter a number, press É to
take the calculator out of Alpha mode and then enter the
number. To enter a letter after entering a number, you must
press É to put the calculator back in Alpha mode.
Press Õ when you’re finished entering the name.
When renaming a file that is being transferred to the receiv-
ing calculator, the calculator has a strange and confusing
way of warning you that a file having the same name already
exists on the receiving calculator. When you press Õ
after entering the name, the calculator erases the name and
makes you start over with entering a name. No warning
message tells you that a file having the same name already
exists on the calculator. If this happens to you, simply enter
a different name.

Figure 23-3 illustrates a completed transfer of files between two cal-
culators. The first picture in the figure shows the files that were
sent; the second picture shows the files that were received. During
the transfer of the files, L2 was renamed DATA.
Figure 23-3: Transferring files between two calculators.
If you want to terminate the transfer of files while it is in progress,
press … on either calculator. Then press Õ when you’re con-
fronted with the Error in Xmit error message. If you put one calcu-
lator in Receiving mode and then decide not to transfer any files to
that calculator, press … to take it out of Receiving mode.
Transferring Files to Several
Calculators
After transferring files between two calculators (as described in
the previous section), you can then use the sending and/or receiv-
ing calculator to transfer the same files to a third calculator, usu-
ally without having to reselect the files. (If the initial transfer
consisted of files selected from the A- submenu of the Link Send
menu, then you will have to reselect the files.)

To transfer files to a third calculator, follow these steps:
1. After making the initial transfer of files between the
sending and receiving calculators, wait until Step 4 below
before pressing any keys on the calculator that will be
used to transfer the files to a third calculator. 
After the initial transfer of files is complete, the screens on
the sending and receiving calculators look similar to those
in Figure 23-4, only with different files. If you press any key
on the calculator, other than those specified in Step 3, the
files you’re planning on sending to a third calculator will no
longer be selected and you will have to reselect them. 
2. Link the third calculator to either the sending or receiv-
ing calculator.
3. On the third calculator press yÑ~Õ.
4. On the other calculator press yÑ and select the
same menu item that was used in the initial transfer of
files. Press ~Õ to complete the transfer of the files to
the third calculator.
The files from the previous transfer are still selected, pro-
vided that in the interim you made no new selection from
the Link Send menu (as shown in Figure 23-4). The selected
files in this figure are the files that were sent to the receiving
calculator in the initial transfer of files (refer to Figure 23-3).

T
he TI-83 Plus and the TI-84 use Flash technology, the TI-83 does
not. Flash technology allows you to (among other things) install
application programs on your calculator. 
If your calculator uses Flash technology, you’re in for a treat
because the Texas Instruments Web site contains over 40 applica-
tions that you can download and install on your calculator. Most 
of these application programs are free; those that aren’t are very
inexpensive. 
Texas Instruments may have already installed some of these pro-
grams on you calculator, even those that aren’t free. To see what
application programs are already on your calculator, press å.
If your calculator doesn’t have an å key, then you cannot add
application programs to the calculator because it isn’t endowed
with Flash technology. If you want the apps, I recommend that you
upgrade to a TI-84.
In the following section, I briefly describe some application pro-
grams you can download from the Texas Instruments Web site. At
the end of this chapter I tell you how to find, download, and install
those programs.

Ten Great Applications
Here are ten great applications you can download from the Texas
Instruments Web site:
 Advanced Finance: This program turns your calculator into 
a financial calculator. 
 Cabri Jr.: This is an interactive, dynamic, geometry program
that allows you to export geometric figures between the calcu-
lator and the Cabri Geometry II Plus software for Windows.
 Catalog Help: This handy program gives you the syntax for
entering the argument required by a calculator function. 
 CellSheet: This program turns your calculator into a spread-
sheet. If you also download the free TI CellSheet Converter soft-
ware, then you can transfer your spreadsheet files between
your calculator and Microsoft Excel or AppleWorks.
 GeoMaster: This is a geometry program that will draw circles,
triangles, and polygons. It will also make measurements and
perform geometric transformations.
 Inequality Graphing: As the name implies, this program will
graph inequalities.
 NoteFolio: This program turns your calculator into a word
processor. Because using the calculator keys is more difficult
than typing on a keyboard, I suggest purchasing a TI Keyboard
so you can key in words the way you do on a computer. And
don’t forget to download the NoteFolio Creator software so you
can transfer files between the calculator and Microsoft Word.
 Organizer: This program is a personal organizer in which you
can schedule events, create to-do lists, and save phone num-
bers and e-mail addresses.
 Probability Simulation: This program simulates rolling dice,
tossing coins, spinning a spinner, or drawing a card from a deck
of cards.
 StudyCards: This program creates electronic flash cards. Be
sure also to download the free TI StudyCard Creator software
that allows you to create the flash cards on your PC.

Eight Common Errors 
In This Chapter
 Incorrectly negating numbers
 Improperly indicating the order of operations
 Forgetting you’re in Radian mode
 Graphing Stat Plots when functions are active and vice versa
E
ven the best calculating machine is only as good as its input.
This chapter identifies eight common errors made when using
the calculator.
Using c Instead of Ã to Indicate
That a Number Is Negative
If you press c instead of Ã at the beginning of an entry, the calcu-
lator assumes you want to subtract what comes after the minus
sign from the previous answer. If you use c instead of Ã in the
interior of an expression to denote a negative number, the calcula-
tor responds with the ERR: SYNTAX error message.
Indicating the Order of Operations
Incorrectly by Using Parentheses
When evaluating expressions, the order of operations is crucial. To
the calculator, for example, -32 equals –9. This may come as quite a
surprise to someone expecting the more standard evaluation, where
(-3)2 equals 9. The calculator first performs the operation in paren-
theses, then it squares the number, and after that, it performs the
unary operation of negating a number. Unless you’re careful, this

won’t provide the answer you’re looking for. To guard against this
error, you may want to review the detailed list of the order in which
the calculator performs operations (given in Chapter 2).
Also, when graphing rational functions, users who are new to the
calculator often make the basic mistake of omitting the parentheses
that must be used to set the numerator apart from the denominator.
Improperly Entering the Argument
for Menu Functions
If an argument is improperly entered, a menu function won’t work.
A prime example is the fMin function housed in the Math MATH
menu. Do you remember what to place after this function so you can
use it? If you don’t, you get the ERR: ARGUMENT error message. 
Texas Instruments offers a really invaluable (and free!) application
called Catalog Help that you can install on your calculator. It
reminds you of the appropriate argument that each function
requires. I highly recommend installing it on your calculator. 
Entering an Angle in Degrees
While in Radian Mode
Actually, you can do so legitimately, but you have to let the calcula-
tor know that you’re overriding the Angle mode by placing a degree
symbol after your entry. Chapter 3 tells you how to do so.
Graphing Trigonometric Functions
While in Degree Mode
This, too, is a mistake unless you do it just right: In the Window
editor you have to set the limits for the x-axis as –360 ≤x ≤360.
Pressing q¨ or q) to have the calculator graph the func-
tion using the ZTrig or ZoomFit command produces similar results.
But this works when you’re graphing pure trig functions such as
sin x. If you’re graphing something like sin x + x, life is a lot easier if
you graph it in Radian mode.
Part IX: The Part of Tens 
236

Graphing Functions When 
Stat Plots Are Active
If you get the ERR: INVALID DIM error message when you graph a
function, this is most likely caused by a Stat Plot that the calcula-
tor is trying to graph along with your function. Chapter 9 tells you
how to inactivate that Stat Plot.
Graphing Stat Plots When
Functions or Other Stat 
Plots Are Active
If you get the ERR: INVALID DIM error message when you graph a
Stat Plot, this is most likely caused by a function or another Stat
Plot that the calculator is trying to graph along with your function.
Chapter 19 tells you how to inactivate those functions or Stat Plots.
Setting the Window Inappropriately
for Graphing
If you get the ERR: WINDOW RANGE error message when graphing
functions, this is most likely caused by setting Xmin ≥Xmax or by
setting Ymin ≥Ymax in the Window editor. Setting the Window
editor is explained in Chapter 9.

Error Messages

 Avoiding the eleven most common errors (but you knew that)
H
ere’s a list of eleven (ten with an extra one thrown in for
good measure) common error messages the calculator may
give you:
ARGUMENT
You usually get this message when you are using a function housed
in one of the menus on the calculator. This message indicates that
you have not properly defined the argument needed to use the
function.
Texas Instruments has a really invaluable application called Catalog
Help that you can install on your calculator and use to remind you
of the appropriate argument required by these functions. It’s free,
so I highly recommend that you install it on your calculator (as
explained in Chapter 27).
BAD GUESS
This message indicates that the guess you’ve given to the calculator
isn’t within the range of numbers that you specified. This is one of
those times when the calculator asks you to guess the solution. One

example is when you’re finding the maximum value or the zero of a
function within a specified range (see Chapter 11). Another is when
you’re finding the solution to an equation where that solution in
contained in a specified range (see Chapter 5).
One other time that you can get this message is when the function
is undefined at (or near) the value of your guess.
DATA TYPE
This type of error occurs if, for example, you enter a negative
number when the calculator requires a positive number. 
DIM MISMATCH
You usually get this message when you attempt to add, subtract, 
or multiply matrices that don’t have compatible dimensions.
DOMAIN
You usually get this message when you’re using a function housed
on a menu of the calculator. If that function is, for example, expect-
ing you to enter a number in a specified range, you get this error
message if that number isn’t in the specified range.
INVALID
This is the catchall error message. Basically it means that you 
did something wrong when defining something (for example, you
used function Y3 in the definition of function Y2, but forgot to 
define function Y3).
INVALID DIM
You get this invalid-dimension message if (for example) you attempt
to raise a nonsquare matrix to a power or enter a decimal for an
argument of a function when it’s expecting an integer.
Part IX: The Part of Tens 
240

NO SIGN CHNG
When you’re using the Equation Solver (detailed in Chapter 5) you
get this message when the equation has no real solutions in your
specified range. When using the Finance application (discussed in
Part III) you get this message when you don’t use the correct sign
for cash flow (for a refresher, see Chapter 6).
SINGULAR MAT
You get this message when you try to find the inverse of a matrix
whose determinant is zero.
SYNTAX
This is another catchall error message. It usually means you have 
a typo somewhere.
WINDOW RANGE
This, of course, means that the Window in improperly set. This
problem is usually (but not always) caused by improperly setting
Xmin ≥Xmax or Ymin ≥Ymax in the Window editor. For a look at
the proper way to set the Window for functions, sequences, para-
metric equations, and polar equations, check out the explanations
in (respectively) Chapters 9, 13, 15, and 16.
