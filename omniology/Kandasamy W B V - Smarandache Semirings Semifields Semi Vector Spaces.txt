PREFACE 
 
 
Smarandache notions, which can be undoubtedly characterized as interesting 
mathematics, has the capacity of being utilized to analyse, study and introduce, 
naturally, the concepts of several structures by means of extension or identification as 
a substructure. Several researchers around the world working on Smarandache notions 
have systematically carried out this study. This is the first book on the Smarandache 
algebraic structures that have two binary operations. 
 
Semirings are algebraic structures with two binary operations enjoying several 
properties and it is the most generalized structure — for all rings and fields are 
semirings. The study of this concept is very meagre except for a very few research 
papers. Now, when we study the Smarandache semirings (S-semiring), we make the 
richer structure of semifield to be contained in an S-semiring; and this S-semiring is 
of the first level. To have the second level of S-semirings, we need a still richer 
structure, viz. field to be a subset in a S-semiring. This is achieved by defining a new 
notion called the Smarandache mixed direct product. Likewise we also define the 
Smarandache semifields of level II.  This study makes one relate, compare and 
contrasts weaker and stronger structures of the same set.  
 
The motivation for writing this book is two-fold. First, it has been our aim to 
give an insight into the Smarandache semirings, semifields and semivector spaces. 
Secondly, in order to make an organized study possible, we have also included all the 
concepts about semirings, semifields and semivector spaces; since, to the best of our 
knowledge we do not have books, which solely deals with these concepts. This book 
introduces several new concepts about Smarandache semirings, semifields and 
semivector spaces based on some paper by F. Smarandache about algebraic structures 
and anti-structures. We assume at the outset that the reader has a strong background in 
algebra that will enable one to follow and understand the book completely.  
 
This book consists of seven chapters. The first chapter introduces the basic 
concepts which are very essential to make the book self-contained. The second 
chapter is solely devoted to the introduction of semirings and its properties. The 
notions about semifields and semivector spaces are introduced in the third chapter. 
Chapter four, which is one of the major parts of this book contains a complete 
systematic introduction of all concepts together with a sequential analysis of these 
concepts. Examples are provided abundantly to make the abstract definitions and 
results easy and explicit to the reader.  
 
Further, we have also given several problems as exercises to the student/ 
researcher, since it is felt that tackling these research problems is one of the ways to 
get deeply involved in the study of Smarandache semirings, semifields and semivector 
spaces. The fifth chapter studies Smarandache semifields and elaborates some of its 
properties. The concept of Smarandache semivector spaces are treated and analysed in 

 
6 
chapter six. The final chapter includes 25 research problems and they will certainly be 
a boon to any researcher. It is also noteworthy to mention that at the end of every 
chapter we have provided a bibliographical list for supplementary reading, since 
referring to and knowing these concepts will equip and enrich the researcher's 
knowledge. The book also contains a comprehensive index. 
 
Finally, following the suggestions and motivations of Dr. Florentin 
Smarandache’s paper on Anti-Structures we have introduced the Smarandache anti 
semiring, anti semifield and anti semivector space. On his suggestion I have at each 
stage introduced II level of Smarandache semirings and semifields. Overall in this 
book we have totally defined 65 concepts related to the Smarandache notions in 
semirings and its generalizations.  
 
I deeply acknowledge my children Meena and Kama whose joyful persuasion 
and support encouraged me to write this book.

CHAPTER ONE 
PRELIMINARY NOTIONS 
 
This chapter gives some basic notions and concepts used in this book to make this 
book self-contained. The serious study of semirings is very recent and to the best of 
my knowledge we do not have many books on semirings or semifields or semivector 
spaces. The purpose of this book is two-fold, firstly to introduce the concepts of 
semirings, semifields and semivector spaces (which we will shortly say as semirings 
and its generalizations), which are not found in the form of text. Secondly, to define 
Smarandache semirings, semifields and semivector spaces and study these newly 
introduced concepts.  
 
In this chapter we recall some basic properties of semigroups, groups, lattices, 
Smarandache semigroups, fields, vector spaces, group rings and semigroup rings. We 
assume at the outset that the reader has a good background in algebra. 
 
 
1.1 Semigroups, Groups and Smarandache Semigroups  
 
In this section we just recall the definition of these concepts and give a brief 
discussion about these properties. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.1: Let S be a non-empty set, S is said to be a semigroup if on S is 
defined a binary operation ‘∗’ such that 
 
1. For all a, b ∈ S we have a ∗ b ∈ S (closure). 
2. For all a, b, c ∈ S we have (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ (b ∗ c) (associative law), We 
denote by (S, ∗) the semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.2: If in a semigroup (S, ∗), we have a ∗ b = b ∗ a for all a, b ∈ S we 
say S is a commutative semigroup. 
 
If the number of elements in the semigroup S is finite we say S is a finite semigroup or 
a semigroup of finite order, otherwise S is of infinite order. If the semigroup S 
contains an element e such that e ∗ a = a ∗ e = a for all a ∈ S we say S is a semigroup 
with identity e or a monoid. An element x ∈ S, S a monoid is said to be invertible or 
has an inverse in S if there exist a y ∈ S such that xy = yx = e. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.3: Let (S, ∗) be a semigroup. A non-empty subset H of S is said to be 
a subsemigroup of S if H itself is a semigroup under the operations of S. 
 

 
8 
DEFINITION 1.1.4: Let (S, ∗) be a semigroup, a non-empty subset I of S is said to be a 
right ideal of S if I is a subsemigroup of S and for all s ∈ S and i ∈ I we have is ∈ I.   
 
Similarly one can define left ideal in a semigroup. We say I is an ideal of a semigroup 
if I is simultaneously a left and a right ideal of S. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.5: Let (S, ∗) and (S1, ο) be two semigroups. We say a map φ from (S, 
∗) → (S1,ο) is a semigroup homomorphism if φ (s1 ∗ s2) = φ(s1) ο φ(s2) for all s1, s2 ∈ 
S. 
 
Example 1.1.1: Z9 = {0, 1, 2, … , 8} is a commutative semigroup of order nine under 
multiplication modulo 9 with unit. 
 
Example 1.1.2: S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} is a semigroup of finite order, under 
multiplication modulo 12. S has no unit but S is commutative. 
 
Example 1.1.3: Z be the set of integers. Z under usual multiplication is a semigroup 
with unit of infinite order. 
 
Example 1.1.4: 2Z = {0, ±2, ±4, … , ±2n …} is an infinite semigroup under 
multiplication which is commutative but has no unit.

Example 1.1.7: Let Z be the semigroup under multiplication pZ = {0, ± p, ± 2p, …} is 
an ideal of Z, p any positive integer.  
 
Example 1.1.8: Let Z14 = {0, 1, 2, … , 13} be the semigroup under multiplication. 
Clearly I = {0, 7} and J = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12} are ideals of Z14.  
 
Example 1.1.9: Let X = {1, 2, 3, … , n} where n is a finite integer. Let S (n) denote 
the set of all maps from the set X to itself. Clearly S (n) is a semigroup under the 
composition of mappings. S(n) is a non-commutative semigroup with nn elements in 
it; in fact S(n) is a monoid as the identity map is the identity element under 
composition of mappings.  
 
Example 1.1.10: Let S(3) be the semigroup of order 27, (which is for n = 3 described 
in example 1.1.9.) It is left for the reader to find two sided ideals of S(3). 

 
9 
 
Notation: Throughout this book S(n) will denote the semigroup of mappings of any 
set X with cardinality of X equal to n. Order of S(n) is denoted by ο (S(n)) or |S(n)| 
and S(n) has nn elements in it.  
 
Now we just recall the definition of group and its properties. 
DEFINITION 1.1.6: A non-empty set of elements G is said to from a group if in G there 
is defined a binary operation, called the product and denoted by ‘•’ such that 
 
1. a, b ∈ G implies a • b ∈ G (Closure property) 
2. a, b, c ∈ G implies a • (b • c) = (a • b) • c (associative law) 
3. There exists an element e ∈ G such that a • e = e • a = a for all a ∈ G (the 
existence of identity element in G). 
4. For every a ∈ G there exists an element a-1 ∈ G such that a • a-1 = a-1 • a = e  
(the existence of inverse in G). 
 
A group G is abelian or commutative if for every a, b ∈ G a • b = b • a. A group, 
which is not abelian, is called non-abelian. The number of distinct elements in G is 
called the order of G; denoted by ο (G) = |G|. If ο (G) is finite we say G is of finite 
order otherwise G is said to be of infinite order. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.7: Let (G, ο) and (G1, ∗) be two groups. A map φ: G to G1 is said to 
be a group homomorphism if φ (a• b) = φ(a) ∗ φ(b) for all a, b ∈ G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.8: Let (G, ∗) be a group. A non-empty subset H of G is said to be a 
subgroup of G if (H, ∗) is a group, that is H itself is a group.  
 
For more about groups refer. (I. N. Herstein and M. Hall).  
 
Throughout this book by Sn we denote the set of all one to one mappings of the set X 
= {x1, … , xn} to itself. The set Sn together with the composition of mappings as an 
operation forms a non-commutative group. This group will be addressed in this book 
as symmetric group of degree n or permutation group on n elements. The order of Sn 
is finite, only when n is finite. Further Sn has a subgroup of order n!/2 , which we 
denote by An called the alternating group of Sn and S = Zp \ {0} when p is a prime 
under the operations of usual multiplication modulo p is a commutative group of order 
p-1. 
 
Now we just recall the definition of Smarandache semigroup and give some examples. 
As this notion is very new we may recall some of the important properties about them. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.9: The Smarandache semigroup (S-semigroup) is defined to be a 
semigroup A such that a proper subset of A is a group. (with respect to the same 
induced operation). 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.10: Let S be a S semigroup. If every proper subset of A in S, which is 
a group is commutative then we say the S-semigroup S to be a Smarandache 
commutative semigroup and if S is a commutative semigroup and is a S-semigroup 
then obviously S is a Smarandache commutative semigroup. 

 
10 
 
Let S be a S-semigroup, ο(S) = number of elements in S that is the order of S, 
if ο(S) is finite we say S is a finite S-semigroup otherwise S is an infinite S-semigroup. 
 
Example 1.1.11: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, …, 11} be the modulo integers under 
multiplication mod 12. Z12 is a S-semigroup for the sets A1 = {1, 5}, A2 = {9, 3}, A3 = 
{4, 8} and A4 = {1, 5, 7, 11} are subgroups under multiplication modulo 12. 
 
Example 1.1.12: Let S(5) be the symmetric semigroup. S5 the symmetric group of 
degree 5 is a proper subset of S(5) which is a group. Hence S(5) is a Smarandache 
semigroup. 
 
Example 1.1.13: Let Mn×n = {(aij) / aij ∈ Z} be the set of all n × n matrices; under 
matrix multiplication Mn×n is a semigroup. But Mn×n is a S-semigroup if we take Pn×n 
the set of all is a non-singular matrixes of Mn×n , it is a group under matrix 
multiplication. 
 
Example 1.1.14: Zp = {0, 1, 2, … , p-1} is a semigroup under multiplication modulo 
p. The set A = {1, p-1} is a subgroup of Zp. Hence Zp for all primes p is a S-
semigroup.  
 
For more about S-semigroups one can refer [9,10,11,18].

1.2 Lattices 
 
In this section we just recall the basic results about lattices used in this book. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.1: Let A and B be non-empty sets. A relation R from A to B is a subset 
of A × B. Relations from A to B are called relations on A, for short, if (a, b) ∈ R then 
we write aRb and say that 'a is in relation R to b’. Also if a is not in relation R to b, 
we write 
b
R
a /
. 
 
A relation R on a non-empty set A may have some of the following properties:  
 
R is reflexive if for all a in A we have aRa.  

 
12 
R is symmetric if for a and b in A: aRb implies bRa.  
R is anti symmetric if for all a and b in A; aRb and bRa imply a = b. 
R is transitive if for a, b, c in A; aRb and bRc imply aRc. 
 
A relation R on A is an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. 
In the case [a] = {b ∈ A| aRb}, is called the equivalence class of a for any a ∈ A. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.2: A relation R on a set A is called a partial order (relation) if R is 
reflexive, anti symmetric and transitive. In this case (A, R) is a partially ordered set or 
poset. 
 
We denote the partial order relation by ≤ or ⊆. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.3: A partial order relation ≤ on A is called a total order if for each a, 
b ∈ A, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. {A, ≤} is called a chain or a totally ordered set. 
 
Example 1.2.1: Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}, (A, ≤) is a total order. Here ‘≤’ is the usual 
“less than or equal to” relation. 
 
Example 1.2.2: Let X = {1, 2, 3}, the power set of X is denoted by P(X) = {φ, X, {a}, 
{b}, {c}, {a, b}, {c, b}, {a, c}}. P(X) under the relation ‘ ⊆ ’ “inclusion” as subsets or 
containment relation is a partial order on P(X). 
 
It is important or interesting to note that finite partially ordered sets can be 
represented by Hasse Diagrams. Hasse diagram of the poset A given in example 1.2.1:

DEFINITION 1.2.4: Let (A, ≤) be a poset and B ⊆ A. 
 
i) 
a ∈ A is called an upper bound of B if and only if for all b ∈ B, b ≤ a. 
ii) 
a ∈ A is called a lower bound of B if and only if for all b ∈ B; a ≤ b. 
iii) 
The greatest amongst the lower bounds, whenever it exists is called the 
infimum of B, and is denoted by inf B. 
iv) 
The least upper bound of B whenever it exists is called the supremum of B 
and is denoted by sup B. 
 
Now with these notions and notations we define a semilattice. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.5: A poset (L,  ≤) is called a semilattice order if for every pair of 
elements x, y in L the sup (x, y) exists (or equivalently we can say inf (x, y) exist). 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.6: A poset (L, ≤) is called a lattice ordered if for every pair of 
elements x, y in L the sup (x, y) and inf (x, y) exists. 
 
It is left for the reader to verify the following result. 
 
Result: 
1. Every ordered set is lattice ordered. 
2. In a lattice ordered set (L, ≤) the following statements are equivalent 
for all x and y in L. 
a. x ≤ y 
b. Sup (x, y) = y 
c. Inf (x, y) = x. 
 
Now as this text uses also the algebraic operations on a lattice we define an algebraic 
lattice. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.7: An algebraic lattice (L, ∩, ∪) is a non-empty set L with two binary 
operations ∪ (join) and ∩ (meet) (also called union or sum and intersection or 
product respectively) which satisfy the following conditions for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
L1. x ∩ y = y ∩ x, 
 
  
x ∪ y = y ∪ x 
L2. x ∩ (y ∩ z) = (x ∩ y) ∩ z,  
x ∪ (y ∪ z) = (x ∪ y) ∪ z 
L3. x ∩ (x ∪ y) = x,   
 
x ∪ (x ∩ y) = x. 
 
Two applications of L3 namely x ∩ x = x ∩ (x ∪ (x ∩ x)) = x lead to the additional 
condition L4. x ∩ x = x, x ∪ x = x. L1 is the commutative law, L2 is the associative 
law, L3 is the absorption law and L4 is the idempotent law. 
 
The connection between lattice ordered sets and algebraic lattices is as follows: 
 
Result:  

 
14 
1. Let (L, ≤) be a lattice ordered set. If we define x ∩ y = inf (x, y) and x ∪ y 
= sup (x, y) then (L, ∪, ∩) is an algebraic lattice. 
 
2. Let (L, ∪, ∩) be an algebraic lattice. If we define x ≤ y if and only if x ∩ y  
= x (or x ≤ y if and only if x ∪ y = y) then (L, ≤) is a lattice ordered set. 
 
This result is left as an exercise for the reader to verify. 
 
Thus it can be verified that the above result yields a one to one relationship between 
algebraic lattices and lattice ordered sets. Therefore we shall use the term lattice for 
both concepts. |L| = o(L) denotes the order (that is cardinality) of the lattice L. 
 
Example 1.2.3:

L  be a lattice given by the following Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This lattice will be called as the pentagon lattice in this book.

L  be the lattice given by the following Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This lattice will be addressed as diamond lattice in this book. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.8: Let (L, ≤) be a lattice. If ‘≤’ is a total order on L and L is lattice 
order we call L a chain lattice. Thus we see in a chain lattice L we have for every pair 
a, b ∈ L we have either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. 
 
Chain lattices will play a major role in this book. 
 
Example 1.2.5: Let L be [a, b] any closed interval on the real line, [a, b] under the 
total order is a chain lattice.

Example 1.2.6: [0,∝) is also a chain lattice of infinite order. Left for the reader to 
verify. 
 
Example 1.2.7: [-∝, 1] is a chain lattice of infinite cardinality. 
 
Example 1.2.8: Take [0, 1] = L the two element set. L is the only 2 element lattice and 
it is a chain lattice having the following Hasse diagram and will be denoted by C2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.9: A non-empty subset S of a lattice L is called a sublattice of L if S is 
a lattice with respect to the restriction of ∩ and ∪ of L onto S. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.10: Let L and M be any two lattices. A mapping f: L → M is called a  
 
1. Join homomorphism if x ∪ y = z ⇒ f(x) ∪ f(y) = f(z) 
2. Meet homomorphism if x ∩ y = z ⇒ f(x) ∩ f(y) = f(z)  
3. Order homomorphism if x ≤ y imply f(x) ≤ f(y) for all x, y ∈ L. 
 
f is a lattice homomorphism if it is both a join and a meet homomorphism. 
Monomorphism, epimorphism, isomorphism of lattices are defined as in the case of 
other algebraic structures. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.11: A lattice L is called modular if for all x, y, z ∈ L, x ≤ z imply x ∪ 
(y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ z. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.12: A lattice L is called distributive if either of the following 
conditions hold good for all x, y, z in L. x ∪ (y ∩ z) = (x ∪  y) ∩ (x ∪ z) or x ∩ (y ∪ 
z) = (x ∩ y)∪ (x ∩ z) called the distributivity equations.  
 
It is left for reader to verify the following result: 
 
Result: A lattice L is distributive if and only if for all x, y, z ∈ L. (x ∩ y) ∪ (y ∩ z) ∪ 
(z ∩ x) = (x ∪ y) ∩ (y ∪ z) ∩ (z ∪ x).

DEFINITION 1.2.13: A lattice L with 0 and 1 is called complemented if for each x ∈ L 
there is atleast one element y such that x ∩ y = 0 and x ∪ y = 1, y is called a 
complement of x. 
Example 1.2.13: The lattice with the following Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is such that xi ∩ xj = 0, i ≠ j; xi ∪ xj = 1, i ≠ j, each xi has a complement xj, i ≠ j. 
 
Result: If L is a distributive lattice then each x ∈ L has atmost one complement which 
is denoted by x'. This is left for the reader to verify. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.14: A complemented distributive lattice is called a Boolean algebra 
(or a Boolean lattice). Distributivity in a Boolean algebra guarantees the uniqueness 
of complements. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.15: Let B1 and B2 be two Boolean algebras. The mapping φ: B1 → B2 
is called a Boolean algebra homomorphism if φ is a lattice homomorphism and for all 
x ∈ B1, we have φ (x') = (φ(x))'. 
 
Example 1.2.14: Let X = {x1, x2, x3, x4}. P(X) = power set of X, is a Boolean algebra 
with 16 elements in it. This is left for the reader to verify.

1.3 Rings and Fields 
 
In this section we mainly introduce the concept of ring and field. This is done for two 
reasons, one to enable one to compare a field and a semifield. Second, to study group 
rings and semigroup rings. We do not give all the properties about field but what is 
essential alone is given, as the book assumes that the reader must have a good 
background of algebra. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.1: A ring is a set R together with two binary operations + and • 
called addition and multiplication, such that 
 
1. (R, +) is an abelian group 
2. The product r • s of any two elements r, s ∈ R is in R and 
multiplication is associative. 
3. For all r, s, t ∈ R, r • (s + t) = r • s + r • t and (r + s) • t = r • t + s • t 
(distributive law). 
 
We denote the ring by (R, +, •) or simply by R. In general the neutral element in (R,+) 
will always be denoted by 0, the additive inverse of r ∈ R is –r. Instead of r • s we will 
denote it by rs. Clearly these rings are "associative rings". Let R be a ring, R is said 
to be commutative, if a • b = b • a for all a, b ∈ R. If there is an element 1 ∈ R such 
that 1 • r = r • 1 = r for all r ∈ R, then 1 is called the identity (or unit) element. 
 
If r • s = 0 implies r = 0 or s = 0 for all r, s ∈ R then R is called integral. A 
commutative integral ring with identity is called an integral domain. 
 
If R \ {0} is a group then R is called a skew field or a division ring. If more over, R is 
commutative we speak of a field. The characteristic of R is the smallest natural 
number k with kr = r + … + r (k times) equal to zero for all r ∈ R. We then write k = 
characteristic R. If no such k exists we put characteristic R = 0. 
 
Example 1.3.1: Q be the set of all rationals. (Q, +, •) is a field of characteristic 0. 
 
Example 1.3.2: Let Z be the set of integers. (Z, +, •) is a ring which is in fact an 
integral domain. 
 
Example 1.3.3: Let Mn×n be the collection of all n × n matrices with entries from Q. 
Mn×n with matrix addition and matrix multiplication is a ring which is non-
commutative and this ring has zero divisors that is, Mn×n is not a skew field or a 
division ring. 
Figure 1.2.13 

 
20 
 
Example 1.3.4: Let M'n×n denote the set of all non-singular matrices with entries from 
Q that is given in example 1.3.3. Clearly M'n×n is a division ring or a skew field.  
 
Example 1.3.5: Let R be the set of reals, R is a field of characteristic 0. 
 
Example 1.3.6: Let Z28 = {0, 1, 2, … , 27}. Z28 with usual addition and multiplication 
modulo 28 is a ring. Clearly Z28 is a commutative ring with 7.4 ≡ 0(mod 28) that is 
Z28 has zero divisors. 
 
Example 1.3.7: Let Z23 = {0, 1, 2, … , 22} be the ring of integers modulo 23. Z23 is a 
field of characteristic 23. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.2: Let F be a field. A proper subset S of F is said to be a subfield if S 
itself is a field under the operations of F. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.3: Let F be a field. If F has no proper subfields then F is said to be a 
prime field. 
 
Example 1.3.8: Zp = {0, 1, 2, … , p-1} where p is a prime, is a prime field of 
characteristic p. 
 
Example 1.3.9: Let Q be the field of rationals. Q has no proper subfield. Q is the 
prime field of characteristic 0; all prime fields of characteristic 0 are isomorphic to Q. 
 
Example 1.3.10: Let R be the field of reals. R has the subset Q ⊂ R and Q is a field; 
so R is not a prime field and characteristic R = 0. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.4: Let R be any ring. A proper subset S of R is said to be a subring of 
R if S is a ring under the operations of R. 
 
Example 1.3.11: Let Z20 = {0, 1, 2, … , 19} is the ring of integers modulo 20. Clearly 
A = {0, 10} is a subring of Z20. 
 
Example 1.3.12: Let Z be the ring of integers 5Z ⊂ Z is the subring of Z. 
 
Example 1.3.13: Let R be a commutative ring and R[x] be the polynomial ring. R ⊂ 
R[x] is a subring of R[x]. In fact R[x] is an integral domain if and only if R is an 
integral domain (left as an exercise for the reader to verify). 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.5: Let R and S be any two rings. A map φ: R → S is said to be a ring 
homomorphism 
 if φ (a + b) = φ (a) + φ(b) and φ (ab) = φ(a) • φ (b) for all a, b ∈ R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.6: Let R be a ring. I a non-empty subset of R is called right (left) ideal 
of R if 
 
1. I is a subring. 
2. For r ∈ R and i ∈ I,  ir ∈ I (or ri ∈ I). 

 
21 
 
If I is simultaneously both a right and a left ideal of R we say I is an ideal of R. Thus 
ideals are subrings but all subrings are not ideals. 
 
Example 1.3.14: Let Z be the ring of integers. pZ = {0, ±p, ±2p, …} for any p ∈ Z is 
an ideal of Z. 
 
Example 1.3.15: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, … , 11} be the ring of integers modulo 12. I = {0, 
6} is an ideal of Z12, P = {0, 3, 6, 9} is also an ideal of Z12 I2 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} is an 
ideal of Z12. 
 
Example 1.3.16: Let R[x] be a polynomial ring. p(x) = p0 + p1x + … + pnxn be a 
polynomial of degree n (pn ≠ 0). Clearly p(x) generates an ideal. We leave it for the 
reader to check this fact. We denote the ideal generated by p(x) by 〈p(x)〉. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.7: Let φ: R → R' be a ring homomorphism the kernel of φ denoted by 
ker φ = {x ∈ R / φ(x) = 0} is an ideal of R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.8: Let R be any ring, I an ideal of R. The set R / I = {a + I / a ∈ R} is 
defined as the quotient ring. For this quotient ring, I serves as the additive identity.  
 
The reader is requested to prove R / I is a ring.

1.4 Vector spaces 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of vector spaces mainly to compare and 
contrast with semivector spaces built over semifields. We just recall the most 
important definitions and properties about vector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.1: A vector space (or a linear space) consists of the following 
 
1. a field F of scalars. 
2. a set V of objects called vectors. 
3. a rule (or operation) called vector addition, which associates with each pair 
of vectors α, β  in V a vector α + β  in V in such a way that  
 
i. 
addition is commutative, α + β = β + α. 
ii. 
addition is associative; α + (β + γ) = (α + β) + γ. 
iii. 
there is a unique vector 0 in V, called the zero vector, such that  
α + 0 = α  for all α ∈ V. 
iv. 
for each vector α in V there is a unique vector -α in V such that 
α + (-α) = 0. 
v. 
a rule (or operation) called scalar multiplication which 
associates with each scalar c in F and a vector α in V a vector 
cα in V called the product of c and α in V such  that  
 
a. 1.α = α for every α ∈ V. 
b. (c1, c2) α = c1 (c2α). 

 
23 
c. c (α + β) = cα + cβ. 
d. (c1 + c2)α = c1α + c2α for c1, c2, c ∈ F and α, β ∈ V. 
 
It is important to state that vector space is a composite object consisting of a field F, a 
set of ' vectors' and two operations with certain special properties. The same set of 
vectors may be part of a number of distinct vector spaces. When there is no chance of 
confusion, we may simply refer to the vector space as V. We shall say 'V is a vector 
space over the field F'. 
 
Example 1.4.1: Let R[x] be the polynomial ring where R is the field of reals. R[x] is a 
vector space over R. 
 
Example 1.4.2: Let Q be the field of rationals and R the field of reals. R is a vector 
space over Q. 
 
It is important and interesting to note that Q is not a vector space over R in the 
example 1.4.2. 
 
Example 1.4.3: Let F be any field V = F × F = {(a, b) / a, b ∈ F}. It is left for the 
reader to verify V is a vector space over F. 
 
Example 1.4.4: Let V = {Mn×m} = {(aij) / aij ∈ Q}. V is the set of all n × m matrices 
with entries from Q. It is easily verified that V is a vector space over Q.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.2: Let V be a vector space over the field F. Let β be a vector in V, β is 
said to be a linear combination of vectors α1, … , αn in V provided there exists scalars 
c1, c2, … , cn in F such that β = c1α1 + … + cnαn = ∑
=
α
n

DEFINITION 1.4.3: Let V be a vector space over the field F. A subspace of V is a 
subset W of V which is itself a vector space over F with the operations of vector 
addition and scalar multiplication on V. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.4: Let S be a set of vectors in a vector space V. The subspace spanned 
by S is defined to be the intersection W of all subspaces of V which contain S. When S 
is a finite set of vectors say S = {α1, … , αn} we shall simply call W the subspace 
spanned by the vectors α1, α2, … , αn.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.5: Let V be a vector space over F. A subset S of V is said to be 
linearly dependent (or simply dependent) if there exist distinct vectors α1, α2, … , αn 
in S and scalars c1, … , cn in F not all of which are 0 such that α1c1 + … + αncn = 0. 
 
A set that is not linearly dependent is called linearly independent. If the set S contains 
only finitely many vectors α1, α2, … , αn we sometimes say that α1, … , αn are 
dependent (or independent) instead of saying S is dependent (or independent). 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.6: Let V be a vector space over the field F. A basis for V is a linearly 
independent set of vectors in V, which spans the space V. The space V is finite 

 
24 
dimensional if it has a finite basis which spans V, otherwise we say V is infinite 
dimensional. 
 
Example 1.4.5: Let V = F × F × F = {(x1, x2, x3) / x1, x2, x3 ∈ F} where F is a field. V 
is a vector space over F. The set β = {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} is a basis for V. 
 
It is left for the reader to verify that β spans V = F × F × F = F3; we can say F3 is a 
vector space over F of dimension three. 
 
Example 1.4.6: Let F be a field and Fn = F × … × F (n times), Fn is a vector space 
over F. A set of basis for Fn over F is β = {(1, 0, 0, …, 0), (0, 1, 0, … , 0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 
… , 0), … , (0, 0, … , 0, 1)}. It can be shown, Fn is spanned by β the dimension of Fn 
is n. We call this particular basis as the standard basis of Fn. 
 
Example 1.4.7: Let Fn[x] be a vector space over the field F; where Fn[x] contains all 
polynomials of degree less or equal to n. Now β = {1, x, x2, … , xn} is a basis of 
Fn[x]. The dimension of Fn[x] is n + 1. 
 
Example 1.4.8: Let F[x] be the polynomial ring which is a vector space over F. Now 
the set {1, x, x2, … , xn, …} is a basis of F[x]. The dimension of the vector space F[x] 
over F is infinite. 
 
Remark: A vector space V over F can have many basis but for that vector space the 
number of elements in each of the basis is the same; which is the dimension of V. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.7: Let V and W be two vector spaces defined over the same field F. A 
linear transformation T: V → W is a function from V to W such that T (cα + β) = cT 
(α) + T(β) for all α, β ∈ V and for all scalars c ∈ F. 
 
Remark: The linear transformation leaves the scalars of the field invariant. Linear 
transformation cannot be defined if we take vector spaces over different fields. If W = 
V then the linear transformation from V to V is called the linear operator. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.8: Let L (V, W) denote the collection of all linear transformation of 
the vector space V to W, V and W vector spaces defined over the field F. L(V, W) is a 
vector space over F.  
 
Example 1.4.9: Let R3 be a vector space defined over the reals R. T(x1, x2, x3) = (3x1, 
x1, –x2, 2x1 + x2 + x3) is a linear operator on R3. 
 
Example 1.4.10: Let R3 and R2 be vector spaces defined over R. T is a linear 
transformation from R3 into R2 given by T(x1, x2, x3) = (x1 + x2, 2x3-x1). It is left for 
the reader to verify T is a linear transformation. 
 
Example 1.4.11: Let V = F × F × F be a vector space over F. Check whether the 3 sets 
are 3 distinct sets of basis for V. 
 
1. {(1, 5, 0), (0, 7, 1), (3, 8, 8)}. 
2. {(4, 2, 0), (2, 0, 4), (0, 4, 2)}.

1.5 Group rings and semigroup rings 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of group rings and semigroup rings; the 
main motivation for introducing these concepts is that in this book we will define 
analogously group semirings and semigroup semirings where the rings are replaced by 
semirings. Several new properties not existing is the case of group rings is found in 
the case of group semirings. Throughout this section by the ring R we mean either R 
is a field or R is a commutative ring with 1. G can be any group but we assume the 
operation on the group G is only multiplication. S is a semigroup under multiplication.

over the ring R consists of all finite formal sums of the form ∑α

RG is an associative ring with 0 ∈ R as its additive identity. Since I ∈ R we have G 
=1• G ⊆ RG and R •  e = R ⊆ RG, where e is the identity of the group G. If we 
replace the group G by the semigroup S with identity we get the semigroup ring RS in 
the place of the group ring RG. 
 
Example 1.5.1: Q be the field of rationals and G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 be the cyclic group. The 
group ring QG = {a + bg | a, b ∈ Q and g ∈ G} is a commutative ring of characteristic 
0.  
 
Example 1.5.2: Let Z8 = {0, 1, 2, … , 7} be the ring of integers modulo 8. S3 be the 
symmetric group of degree 3. Z8S3 is the group ring of S3 over Z8. Z8S3 is a non-
commutative ring of characteristic 8. 
 
Example 1.5.3: Let R be the real field, Sn the symmetric group of degree n. The group 
ring RSn is a non-commutative ring of characteristic 0. This is not a skew field for RSn 
has zero divisors. 
 
Example 1.5.4: Let Z5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} be the prime field of characteristic 5. G = 〈g | 
g12 =1〉 be the cyclic group of order 12. The group ring Z5G is a commutative ring 
with characteristic 5 and has zero divisors. 
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. Let Q be the field of rationals. G = S8 be the symmetric group of degree 8. 
Find in the group ring QG = QS, a right ideal and an ideal. 
 
2. S(6) be the symmetric semigroup. Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, … , 5} be the ring of 
integers modulo 6. Find in the semigroup ring Z6S(6).

3. Let Z5S3 be the group ring of the group S3 over the prime field Z5. Z4S7 the 
group ring of the symmetric group S7 over Z4. 
 
i. 
Construct a ring homomorphism φ from Z5S3 to Z4S7. 
ii. 
Find ker φ.  
iii. 
Find the quotient ring Z5S3 / ker φ. 
 
4. Let Z2S3 and Z2S(3) be the group ring and the semigroup ring. Can we 
construct a homomorphism from Z2S3 to Z2S(3)? 
 
5. Find all zero divisors in Z3S(3), the semigroup ring of the semigroup S(3) over 
the prime field Z3. 
 
6. Find all zero divisors in Z3S3, the group ring of the group S3 over the ring Z3.

CHAPTER TWO 
SEMIRINGS AND ITS PROPERTIES 
 
The study of the concept of semiring is very meagre. In my opinion I have not come 
across a textbook that covers completely all the properties of semirings. Hence this 
complete chapter is devoted to introduction of semirings, polynomial semirings and 
many new properties about it, analogous to rings. This chapter also gives for the sake 
of completeness the definition of several types of special semirings like ∗-semirings, 
congruence simple semirings and so on. We do not intend to give all definition or all 
properties instead we expect the reader to refer those papers which are enlisted in the 
supplementary reading at the end of this chapter. This chapter has six sections. In 
sections one and two we define semirings and give examples and prove some basic 
properties. Section three shows how lattices are used to construct semirings. 
Polynomial semirings are introduced in section four. Section five defines and recalls 
the definitions of group semirings and semigroup semirings. The final section mainly 
recalls some of the special types of semirings like c-semirings, ∗-semirings, inductive 
∗-semirings etc.  
 
 
2. 1 Definition and examples of semirings 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of semirings and give some examples. This is 
mainly carried out because we do not have many textbook for semirings except in the 
book 'Handbook of Algebra' Vol. I, by Udo, which carries a section on semirings and 
semifields.  
 
DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): Let S be a non-empty set on which is defined two binary 
operations addition '+' and multiplication '•' satisfying the following conditions:  
 
1. (S, +) is a commutative monoid.  
2. (S, •) is a semigroup.  
3. (a + b) • c = a • c + b • c and a • (b + c) = a • b + a • c for all a, b, c in S.  
 
That is multiplication '•' distributes over the operation addition '+'. (S, +, •) is a 
semiring.  
 
DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): The semiring (S, +, •) is said to be a commutative 
semiring if the semigroup (S, •) is a commutative semigroup. If (S, •) is not a 
commutative semigroup we say S is a non-commutative semiring.  
 
DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): If in the semiring (S, +, •), (S, •) is a monoid that is there 
exists 1 ∈ S such that a • 1 = 1 • a = a for all a ∈ S. We say the semiring is a 
semiring with unit.  
 
Throughout this book Z+ will denote the set of all positive integers and Zo = Z+ ∪ {0} 
will denote the set of all positive integers with zero. Similarly Qo = Q+ ∪ {0} will 

 
30 
denote the set of all positive rationals with zero and Ro = R+ ∪ {0} denotes the set of 
all positive reals with zero.  
DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): Let (S, +, •) be a semiring. We say the semiring is of 
characteristic m if ms = s + … + s (m times) equal to zero for all s ∈ S. If no such m 
exists we say the characteristic of the semiring S is 0 and denote it as characteristic S 
= 0. In case S has characteristic m then we say characteristic S = m.  
 
Here it is interesting to note that certain semirings have no characteristic associated 
with it. This is the main deviation from the nature of rings. We say the semiring S is 
finite if the number of elements in S is finite and is denoted by |S| or o(S). If the 
number of elements in S is not finite we say S is of infinite cardinality. Now we give 
some examples of semirings.  
 
Example 2.1.1: Let Zo = Z+ ∪ {0}. (Zo, +, •) is a semiring of infinite cardinality and 
the characteristic Zo is 0. Further Zo is a commutative semiring with unit.  
 
Example 2.1.2: Let Qo = Q+ ∪ {0}. (Qo, +, o) is also a commutative semiring with 
unit of infinite cardinality and characteristic Qo is 0.  
 
Example 2.1.3: Let  
M2×2 =

of characteristic zero with unit element

 and is of infinite cardinality.  
 
Example 2.1.4: Let S be the chain lattice given by the following Hasse diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S is a semiring with inf and sup as binary operations on it. This is a commutative 
semiring of finite cardinality or order. This semiring has no characteristic associated 
with it.

Example 2.1.5: Consider the following lattice given by the Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It can be verified that this lattice is also a semiring which is commutative with finite 
cardinality and has no characteristic associated with it. 
 
DEFINITION 2.1.1: Let S1 and S2 be two semirings. The direct product of S1 × S2 = {(s1, 
s2)/ s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2} is also a semiring with component-wise operation. Similarly 
if S1, S2¸…, Sn be n semirings. The direct product of these semirings denoted by S1 × S2 
× S3 × … × Sn = {(s1, s2, …, sn)/ si ∈ S1; i = 1, 2, …, n} is a semiring also known as the 
direct product of semirings.  
 
Example 2.1.6: Let Zo be the semiring Zo × Zo × Zo = {(a, b, c)/ a, b, c ∈ Zo} is a 
semiring. This enjoys vividly different properties from Zo.  
 
Example 2.1.7: Let S1 be the two-element chain lattice and S2 be the lattice given by 
the following Hasse diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S1 × S2 = {(0, 0), (0, a), (0, b), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, a), (1, b), (1, 1)} is a semiring under 
the operations of the lattices, S1 × S2 has the following Hasse diagram:

Thus we have seen semirings of characteristic 0 which is both commutative and non-
commutative having infinite cardinality. We are yet to find semiring of characteristic 
n, n ≠ 0 and we have seen finite cardinality semirings with no characteristic associated 
with it both commutative and non-commutative.

2.2 Semirings and its properties 
 
In this section we introduce properties like subsemirings, ideals in semirings, zero 
divisors, idempotents and units in semirings.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.1: Let S be a semiring. P a subset of S. P is said to be a subsemiring 
of S if P itself is a semiring.  
 
Example 2.2.1: Let Zo be the semiring. 2Zo = {0, 2, 4, …} is a subsemiring of Zo.  
 
Example 2.2.2: Let Zo[x] be the polynomial semiring. Zo ⊆ Zo[x] is a subsemiring of 
Zo[x].

following Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
L = {1, a, c, d, e, g, h, 0} is a subsemiring of S.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.2: Let S be a semiring. I be a non-empty subset of S. I is a right (left) 
ideal of S if  
 
1. I is a subsemiring.  
2. For all i ∈ I and s ∈ S we have is ∈ I (si ∈ I). 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.3: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset I of S is said to be an 
ideal of S if I is simultaneously a right and left ideal of S.  
 
Example 2.2.4: Let Zo be the semiring. nZo for any integer. n is an ideal of Zo.  
 
Example 2.2.5: Let S be a semiring given by the following lattice whose Hasse

Clearly I = {0, d, c, a, b} is an ideal of S.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.4: Let S be a semiring. x ∈ S \ {0} is said to be a zero divisor of S if 
there exists y ≠ 0 in S such that x • y = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.5: Let S be a non-commutative semiring with unit. x ∈ S is said to be 
have right (left) unit if their exists a y ∈ S such that xy = 1 (or yx = 1) .  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.6: Let S be a semiring. x ∈ S is an idempotent, if x • x = x2 = x.  
 
Example 2.2.6: Let S be a semiring given by the following Hasse diagram 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a, b ∈ S is such that a • b = 0 i.e. a is a zero divisor and a2 = a and b2 = b so the 
semiring has idempotents.  
 
Example 2.2.7: Let S be a semiring given by S = Zo × Zo × Zo. S has zero divisors 
given by a = (8 0, 2) and b = (0, 6, 0) and a • b = (0, 0, 0). 
 
Example 2.2.8: Let S = Qo × Qo × Qo × Qo  be the semiring under component wise 
addition and multiplication. For S is a semiring with unit (1, 1, 1, 1). Let a = (3, ¼, 
5/3, 7/2) ∈ S. The inverse of a is b = (1/3, 4, 3/5, 2/7) ∈ S is such that ab = (1, 1, 1, 1). 
Thus S has units.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.7: Let S and S' be two semirings. A mapping φ : S → S' is called the 
semiring homomorphism if φ(a + b) = φ(a) + φ(b) and φ(a • b) = φ(a) • φ(b) for all a, 
b ∈ S. 
 
If φ is a one to one and onto map we say φ to be a semiring isomorphism.  
 
DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): Let S be a semiring. We say S is a strict semiring if a + b 
= 0 implies a = 0 and b = 0.  
 
Chris Monico calls this concept as zero sum free.  
 
Example 2.2.9: Zo the semiring is a strict semiring.

DEFINITION 2.2.8: Let S be a semiring with unit 1. We say an element x is invertible 
or has an inverse if there exists a y ∈ S such that xy = yx = 1.  
 
Example 2.2.12: Let Qo be the semiring of rationals. Every element in Qo \{0} is a 
unit in Qo. All elements are invertible.

2.3 Semirings using distributive lattices 
 
In this section we prove all distributive lattices are semirings and obtain some special 
and unique properties enjoyed by these class of semirings. Further this is the only 
class of semirings known to us which is of finite order and has no characteristic.  
 
Throughout this book by Cn we will denote a chain lattice with n elements given by 
the following Hasse diagram:

. . . 
. . . 

 
39 
 
 
 
That is we assume Cn is a chain lattive which has 0 as the least element and 1 as the 
greatest element.  
 
Example 2.3.1: Let C5 be the chain lattice given by the following Hasse diagram  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is a semigroup under union '∪' or max and intersection '∩' or min as binary 
operations. Since C5 is a distributive lattice C5 is a semiring.  
 
THEOREM 2.3.1: Let (L, ∪, ∩) be a distributive lattice. L is a semiring.  
 
Proof: L is a semiring as under '∪', L is a commutative semigroup with '0' as identity 
and L under '∩' is a commutative semigroup; and ∪ and ∩ distribute over each other. 
Hence (L, ∪, ∩) is a semiring.   
 
COROLLARY: All chain lattices are semirings.  
 
Remark: All lattices are not semirings. For the lattice L given by the following Hasse 
diagram is not a semiring.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since distributive law is not true, we see L is not a semiring.  
 
THEOREM 2.3.2: Let B be a Boolean algebra. B is a semiring.  
 
Proof: B is a distributive lattice so by theorem 2.3.1, B is a semiring.

THEOREM 2.3.3: A semiring which is a distributive lattice has no characteristic 
associated with it.  
 
Proof: Since if L is a distributive lattice which is a semiring, we see na = a + … + a (n 
times) will not be zero but equal to a as a + a = a for all a ∈ L. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 2.3.4: The direct product of distributive lattices is a semiring.  
 
Proof: Since direct product of distributive lattices is distributive, we see direct product 
of distributive lattices is a semiring.  
 
Example 2.3.2: Let S = L1 × L2 × L3 be the direct product of the lattices given by the 
following Hasse diagram. S is a semiring.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using these distributive lattices L we can construct finite non-commutative semirings 
by constructing square matrices with entries from L. Let L be a finite distributive 
lattice with 0 and 1. Denote the elements in L by L = {0, x1, x2, …., xn, 1}. Mn×n = 
{(aij)/ aij ∈ L} = {set of all n × n matrices with entries from L}. The two operations 
sum and product denoted by + and • is defined as follows:  
 
Let a = (aij), b = (bij), a + b = (aij ∪ bij) where ∪ is the '∪' of the lattice L.

where c11 = [(a11 ∩ b11) ∪ (a12 ∩ b21) ∪ … ∪ (a1n ∩ bn1)]. Similarly c12 etc. are 
calculated.  
 
Since '∪' and '∩' distribute over each other as L is a distributive lattice, we see {Mn×n, 
+, •} is a finite non-commutative semiring. This semiring has the zero matrix to be the 
additive identity and In×n the matrix with the diagonal elements 1 and all other entries 
as zero as the identity element. Thus only by this method we are in a position to get

finite non-commutative semirings which are also strict semirings but has zero 
divisors.  
 
Example 2.3.3: Let L be a lattice given by the following Hasse diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
M3×3 = {(aij)/ aij ∈ L} be the collection of all 3 × 3 matrices with entries from L. 
Clearly M3×3 is a finite non-commutative strict semiring with unit and with zero 
divisors and idempotents under the matrix operations described in example 2.3.2.  
 
Now we see all Boolean algebras are semirings, for a Boolean algebra is a 
distrubutive complemented lattice. Here we will be using the following definitions 
and results about Boolean algebras.  
 
DEFINITION (GRATZER G.): Let L be a lattice with zero. a ∈ L is called an atom if for 
all b ∈ L, 0 < b ≤ a ⇒ b = a.  
 
Result: Let B be a finite Boolean algebra and let A denote the set of all atoms in B. 
Then B is isomorphic to P(A) the power set of A. i.e. (B, ∪, ∩) ≅ (P(A), ∪, ∩). The 
proof of this result is left to the reader. But we illustrate this by two examples.  
 
Example 2.3.4: Let B be the Boolean algebra given by the following Hasse diagram  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The atoms of B are a and b. So the set of atoms A = {a, b}. Now P(A) = {φ, {a}, {b}, 
{a,b}}. Now P(A) is a distributive complemented lattice under the operation union '∪' 
and intersection '∩' of subsets and complementation. (P(A), ∪, ∩) is a lattice having 
the following Hasse diagram: 
 
1 
a 
b

b 
a 
0 
Figure 2.3.5 
Figure 2.3.6 

 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clearly B ≅ {P(A), ∪, ∩} as lattices by the map ψ: B → {P(A), ∪, ∩} where ψ(0) = 
φ, ψ(a) = {a}, ψ(b) = {b} and ψ(1) = A = {a, b}. 
 
Hence the result mentioned is true for this example. Now consider the example:  
 
Example 2.3.5: Let (B, ∪, ∩) be the Boolean algebra given by the following Hasse 
diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The set of atoms of B is A = {a, b, c}. P(A) = {φ, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, 
{a, b, c} = A}. (P(A), ∪, ∩) is a lattice having the following Hasse diagram:

It is left for the reader to realize the lattices {P(A), ∪, ∩} and {B, ∪, ∩} are 
isomorphic. 
 
Thus the semirings which are got by taking finite Boolean algebras or direct product 
of finite Boolean algebras are finite commutative semirings with unit and zero 
divisors in them.

2.4 Polynomial Semirings 
 
In this section we introduce polynomial semirings. Polynomial semirings have been 
studied by [3]. We see like polynomial rings we can discuss about the nature of the 
polynomial semirings over Qo, Zo or Ro. When semirings are distributive lattices we 
have several nice properties about them.

DEFINITION (LOUIS DALE): Let S be a commutative semiring with unit and x an 
indeterminate. The polynomial semiring S[x] consists of all symbols of the form so + 
s1x + …+ snxn where n can be any non-negative integer and where the coefficients so, 
s1, …, sn are all in S. In order to make a semiring out of S[x] we must be able to 
recognize when two elements in it are equal, we must be able to add and multiply 
elements in S[x] so that the axioms of a semiring hold true for S[x]. If p(x) = ao + a1x 
+ …+ amxm and q(x) = bo + b1x + … + bnxn are in S[x] then p(x) = q(x) if and only if 
for every integer i ≥ 0; ai = bi. 
 
Two polynomials are declared equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are 
equal. Now we say p(x) + q(x) = c0 + cix …+ ctxt, where for each i, ci = ai + bi. 0 = 0 
+ 0x + … + 0xn acts as the additive identity. So S[x] is a commutative monoid under 
+. It is left for the reader to verify S[x] under multiplication of two polynomials is a 
commutative semigroup. So (S[x], +, •) is a commutative semiring with unit 1.  
 
Example 2.4.1: Let Zo be the semiring. Zo[x] is the polynomial semiring. Zo[x] is a 
strict polynomial semiring. Zo[x] has no zero divisors.  
 
Examples 2.4.2: Let S be the distributive lattice given by the following Hasse 
diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S[x] is a polynomial semiring which is commutative and has no zero divisors.

S[x] is a commutative polynomial ring having zero divisors. We are mainly interested 
in introducing the polynomial semiring for the construction of semivector spaces. 
Apart from this we are not going to give in this book any special properties enjoyed 
by the polynomial semirings or about the polynomials in them. For more about 
polynomial semirings one can refer Louis Dale. We can as in the case of rings study 
related properties about polynomial semirings.  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. Let Zo[x] be the polynomial semiring. Find two ideals in Zo[x]. 
 
2. Can Qo[x] have ideals? If so find any two ideals in Qo[x].

following Hasse diagram).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a. Find ideals of S[x]. 
b. Find subsemirings of S[x] which are not ideals of S[x]. 
c. Find some zero divisors in S[x]\S. 
d. Can S[x]\S have idempotents? 
 
4. Can Zo[x] have subsemirings which are not ideals?  
 
5. Can Ro[x] have ideals? Find subsemirings of Ro[x] which are not ideals. Is 
Qo[x] a subsemiring which is not an ideal of Ro[x]? 
 
6. Can Zo[x] have a polynomial p(x) such that p(a) = 0 for some a ∈ Z0 \{0}? 
 
7. Define concepts like reducibility of polynomials in Qo[x] or in general in a 
polynomial semiring.  
 
 
2.5 Group Semirings and Semigroup Semirings 
 
This section is completely devoted to the introduction and study of group semirings 
and semigroup semirings which are not found in literature except one or two papers

finite non-commutative semrings other than the ones discussed in section 2.3. Further 
this method will also give infinite non-commutative semirings of characteristic zero.

6. As 1 ∈ G and 1 ∈ S we have 1 • G = G ⊆ SG and S• 1 = S ⊆ SG. 
 
The group semiring SG will be a commutative semiring if G is a commutative group. 
If G is non-commutative, the group semiring SG will be a non-commutative semiring.  
 
 
Let S be a semiring of infinite order and characteristic 0. Then SG will be a infinite 
semiring of characteristic 0, whatever be the group G. If S is a finite semiring say a 
finite distributive lattice then the group semiring SG will be a finite semiring provided 
G is a finite group, otherwise SG will be an infinite semiring but in both the cases for 
the semiring SG the characteristic remains undefined as we know for distributive 
lattices the characteristic does not exist.  
 
Further we will show only in cases when we use the semiring as distributive lattices 
the group semiring enjoys a special property namely that the group elements of the 
group G can be represented in terms of the group semiring elements i.e. we can 
express g ∈ G as g = α • β where α, β ∈ SG and α, β ∉ G. This is a very unique and 

 
48 
a different property enjoyed by the group semirings SG when S is a distributive non-
chain lattice.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.2: Let S be a strict commutative semiring with unit and L be a 
semigroup under multiplication with unit. The semigroup semiring SL is defined 
analogous to group semiring defined in this section; i.e. if we replace the group G by 
the semigroup L we get the semigroup semiring.  
 
Example 2.5.1: Let Zo be the semiring. S3 be the symmetric group of degree 3. ZoS3 is 
the group semiring which is an infinite non-commutative semiring of characteristic 
zero. It can be checked that ZoS3 is also a strict semiring. 
 
Example 2.5.2: Let Qo be the semiring. G = 〈g/ gn = 1〉 be the cyclic group of order n. 
Clearly QoG is the group semiring of infinite order which is commutative and has 
characteristic 0.  
 
Example 2.5.3: Let the semiring S be the chain lattice, C2. S4 be the symmetric group 
of degree 4. The group semiring SS4 is a non-commutative finite semiring with no 
characteristic associated with it. 
 
Example 2.5.4: Let S be the semiring C3. G = 〈g〉 be the infinite cyclic group. SG is an 
infinite commutative semiring and has no characteristic associated with it.  
 
It is important to note that semirings are the only known structures with two binary 
operations for which the three distinct possibilities can occur.  
 
1. The semirings can have zero characteristic; for example Qo, Zo, Ro
. 
2. Semirings have no finite or infinite characteristic defined. Example all 
distributive lattices.  
3. Semirings with finite characteristic n where n is a positive integer.  
 
It is left as an open research problem to construct semirings with finite characteristic 
n, n a positive integer.  
 
Example 2.5.5: Let Zo be the semiring. S(5) be the semigroup of all mappings of a 
five element set to itself under composition of mappings. ZoS(5) is the semigroup 
semiring which is non-commutative and has characteristic zero.  
 
Example 2.5.6: Let C5 be the chain lattice which is a semiring denoted by S. S(3) the 
semigroup of mappings. The semigroup semiring SS(3) is a finite non-commutative 
semiring with no characteristic associated with it.  
 
Example 2.5.7: Let X be a finite set. P(X) the power set of X. L = P(X) is a 
semigroup under the operation '∪'. Let Qo be the semiring. QoL is a semigroup 
semiring which is commutative and its characteristic is zero.  
 
We do not deal and develop the properties of group semirings or semigroup semirings 
in this section. As our main motivation is only the study of Smarandache semirings 
and for this study these concepts will help us in giving concrete examples. We give 

 
49 
only an example of how group elements are representable in terms of elements from 
group semiring and give a result regarding this.  
 
Example 2.5.8: Let S be the semiring given by the following Hasse diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let G = 〈g/g5 = 1〉 be a cyclic group of degree 5. SG the group semiring of G over S. 
Let α = ag + bg3 and β = ag3 + bg. Now α, β ∈ SG\G; but α • β  = (ag + bg3)(ag3 + 
bg) = ag4 + bg4 = (a + b)g4 (as a + b = 1) = g4∈ G.  
 
Thus we see α, β ∉ G but α • β ∈ G. This is solely a new property enjoyed by group 
semirings when the semirings used are Boolean algebras or order greater than 2. 
 
THEOREM 2.5.1: Let G = 〈g/gn = 1〉 be a finite cyclic group of order n. S be any 
Boolean algebra of order strictly greater than two. Then we have every element gi∈ G 
can be represented as α • β where α, β ∈ SG\G.  
 
Proof: Let gi ∈ G with k + r = i. Take α = (aigk + ai'gr) and β = (ai'gk + aigr) where ai 
and ai' are atoms of S such that aiai' = 0 and ai + ai' = 1. Now α • β = (aigk + 
ai'gr)(ai'gk + aigr) = (ai + ai')g
k+r = 1.gi = gi ∈ G.  
 
This concept of group semirings and semigroup semirings will be used when we study 
Smarandache semirings.

2.6 Some Special semirings 
 
In this section we introduce the new concepts of semirings given by Chris Monico, 
Zoltan Esik, Werner Kuich and others. We recall in this section the definition of ∗-
semirings, Inductive ∗-semirings and c-simple semirings.

DEFINITION (ZOLTAN ESIK AND WERNER KUICH): A ∗-semiring is a semiring S 
equipped with a star operation ∗: S → S. Morphisms of ∗-semirings preserve the star 
operation. 
 
DEFINITION (ZOLTAN ESIK AND WERNER KUICH): An inductive ∗-semiring is a ∗ -
semiring, which is also an ordered semiring (An ordered semiring is a semiring S 
equipped with a partial order ≤ such that the operation are monotonic) and satisfies 
the fixed point inequation, aao + 1 ≤ a∗ and the fixed point induction rule ax + b ≤ x  
⇒ a ∗ b < x. A morphism of inductive ∗-semirings is an order preserving ∗-semiring 
morphism.  
 
For more about these concepts please refer Inductive ∗-semirings by Zoltan Esik, 
Werner Kuich. 
 
DEFINITION (ZOLTAN ESIK AND WERNER KUICH): A continuous semiring is an 
ordered semiring S which is a complete partially ordered set with least element 0 and 
such that the sum and product operations are continuous. A semiring, which is both a 
∗-semiring and a continuous semiring is called continuous ∗-semiring if the star 
operations on S is given by

for all a ∈ S. It is proved a continuous ∗-

CHAPTER THREE 
SEMIFIELDS AND SEMIVECTOR SPACES 
 
This chapter is completely devoted to the introduction of the concepts of semifields 
and semivector spaces. Here we give some examples and recall some interesting 
properties enjoyed by them. Neither this book nor this chapter does claim any 
complete recollection of all notions existing about semivector spaces and semifields, 
as the main motivation is only to study and introduce most of the basic properties 
about semivector spaces and semifields in the context of Smarandache notions.  
 
This chapter has 3 sections, in the first section we introduce and study semifields, in 
the second section define and give examples of semivector spaces. In the final section 
recall some of the most important properties of semivector spaces. 
 
 
3.1 Semifields 
 
This section introduces the concept of semifields and give some examples and derive 
a few of the important properties about them. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.1: Let S be a non-empty set. S is said to be a semifield if  
 
1. S is a commutative semiring with 1. 
2. S is a strict semiring. That is for a, b ∈ S if a + b = 0 then a = 0 and b = 0. 
3. If in S, a • b = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0. 
 
Example 3.1.1: Let Zo be the semiring. Zo is a semifield. 
 
Example 3.1.2: Qo is a semifield. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.2: The semifield S is said to be of characteristic zero if 0 • x = 0 and 
for no integer n; n • x = 0 or equivalently if x ∈ S \ {0}, nx = x + … + x, n times equal 
to zero is impossible for any positive integer n. 
 
Example 3.1.3: Ro is a semifield of characteristic 0. The semifields given in examples 
3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are semifields of characteristic 0. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.3: Let S be a semifield; a subset N of S is a subsemifield if N itself is a 
semifield. If N is a subsemifield of S, we can call S as an extension semifield of N. 
 
Example 3.1.4: Let Zo and Qo be semifields. Zo is the subsemifield of Qo and Qo is an 
extension semifield Zo. 
 

 
54 
Example 3.1.5: Let Zo and Ro be semifields. Zo is the subsemifield of Ro and Ro is an 
extension semifield of Zo. 
 
 
Example 3.1.6: Let Zo[x] be the polynomial semiring which is a semifield. Clearly 
Zo[x] is an extension semifield of Zo and Zo is the subsemifield of Zo[x]. 
 
It is pertinent to note the following facts, which are put as remarks. 
 
Remark 1: As in the case of fields of characteristic 0, semifield of characteristic zero 
also has infinite number of elements in them. 
 
Remark 2: Unlike in fields where, R[x], polynomial ring is only an integral domain in 
case of semifields, the polynomial semiring is also a semifield. If S is a semifield, 
S[x] the polynomial semiring is an extension semifield of S that is S ⊆ S[x]. This is a 
special and a distinct property enjoyed solely by semifields and not by fields. 
 
Example 3.1.7: Let C3 be a chain lattice. C3 is a semifield. C3[x] is a polynomial 
semiring, is an extension semifield of C3 and C3 is the subsemifield of C3[x].  
 
Clearly C3[x] has no characteristic associated with it. In fact C3[x] is an infinite 
extension of the finite semifield C3. 
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.1: Every chain lattice is a semifield with no characteristic associated 
with it. 
 
We find the following two observations as appropriate corollaries. 
 
COROLLARY 3.1.2: Every distributive lattice, which is not a chain lattice, in general 
is not a semifield.  
 
Proof: By an example, consider the lattice S, whose Hasse diagram is given by the 
following figure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S is a semiring but S is not a semifield as a • b = 0 for a, b ∈ S.

Example 3.1.8: Let S be the semiring given by the following Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clearly S is a semifield but S is not a chain lattice as S cannot be totally ordered, for c, 
d in S are not comparable. Thus we have semifields of this from also. 
 
COROLLARY 3.1.3: Let B be a Boolean algebra of order greater than two, B is never 
a semifield. 
 
Proof: Since B is a Boolean algebra which is not C2 we see B has at least 2 atoms a1, 
a2 in B and if a1' is the complement of a1 we have a1.a1' = 0 and a1' + a1 = 1. Thus B is 
not a semifield if o(B) > 2. 
 
As in the case of fields we have the smallest prime field of characteristic 0 is Q, like 
wise in case of semifield we have the semifield Zo to be a prime semifield as it has no 
subsemifields. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.4: Let S be a semifield, we say S is a prime semifield if S has no 
proper subsemifield. 
 
Example 3.1.9: Let Zo be the semifield. Zo has no proper subsemifields so Zo is the 
prime semifield of characteristic 0. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.4: Every semifield of characteristic zero contains Zo as a subsemifield. 
 
Proof: Let S be a semifield of characteristic 0. Since 1 ∈ S we see 1 generates Zo so 
Zo is a subsemifield of S. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.5: Zo is the smallest semifield of characteristic 0.

56 
Proof: Zo has no proper subsemifield. Since any subsemifield N of Zo must also 
contain 0 and 1 so Zo ⊂ N but N ⊂ Zo so N = Zo. 
 
From here onwards we will call the semifield Zo as the prime semifield of 
characteristic 0. C2 the chain lattice is a prime semifield as C2 has no subsemifields. 
This leads us to formulate the following important theorem. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.6: Let Cn be a chain lattice with n > 2. Cn is not a prime semifield. 
 
Proof: Now Cn when n > 2 we have the subset S = {0, 1} to be a subsemifield of Cn. 
So Cn is not a prime semifield.  
 
This gives the following: 
 
COROLLARY 3.1.7: C2 is the prime semifield having no characteristic. 
 
Proof: Obvious as C2 contains only 0 and 1. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.8: Let S be a distributive lattice, which is a semifield having more than 
2 elements. S is not a prime semifield. 
 
Proof: If S is a semifield, S contains 0 and 1. So S has a subsemifield given by {0, 1}; 
thus S is not a prime semifield.  
 
Just as in the case of fields direct product of semifields is not a semifield. 
 
Example 3.1.10: Let S = Zo × Zo × Zo be the direct product of semifields. S is not a 
semifield as α = (0, 9, 0) and β = (1, 0, 2) ∈ S is such that α.β = (0, 0, 0). 
 
The major property which distinguishes the semifield and field is given by the 
following theorem. We know a field has no ideals. But semifields have ideals. 
  
THEOREM 3.1.9: Let Zo be a semifield. Zo has ideals. 
 
Proof: nZo for any positive integer n is an ideal of Zo. 
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Find a subsemifield of Qo[x]. 
 
2. Find in Zo[x] a subsemifield. 
 
3. Find ideals in C7[x]. 
 
4. Find subsemirings of C11[x] which are not ideals. 
 
5. Can C13[x] have subsemirings which are not ideals? 
 
6. In Zo can we say all subsemirings are ideals? 
 

 
57 
7. Find examples of semifields in which every subsemiring is an ideal. 
 
3.2 Semivector Spaces and Examples 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of semivector spaces and give examples of 
them. Since the notion of semivector spaces are not found in text and we have only 
one paper on semivector spaces published in 1993. So we have given a complete 
recaptivation of these concepts with examples. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.1: A semivector space V over the semifield S of characteristic zero is 
the set of elements, called vectors with two laws of combination, called vector 
addition (or addition) and scalar multiplication, satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. 
To every pair of vectors α, β in V there is associated a vector in V called their 
sum, which we denote by α + β. 
2. 
Addition is associative (α + β) + γ =  α + (β + γ) for all α, β, γ ∈ V. 
3. 
There exists a vector, which we denote by zero such that 0 + α = α + 0 = α 
for all α ∈ V. 
4. 
Addition is commutative α + β = β + α   for all α, β ∈ V. 
5. 
If 0 ∈ S and α ∈ V we have 0. α = 0. 
6. 
To every scalar s ∈ S and every vector v ∈ V there is associated a unique 
vector called the product s.v which is denoted by sv. 
7. 
Scalar multiplication is associative, (ab) α = a (bα) for all α ∈ V and a, b ∈ 
S. 
8. 
Scalar multiplication is distributive with respect to vector addition, a (α + β) 
= aα + aβ for all a ∈ S and for all α, β ∈ V. 
9. 
Scalar multiplication is distributive with respect to scalar addition: (a + b) α 
= aα + bα for all a, b ∈ S and for all α ∈ V. 
10. 
1. α = α (where I ∈ S) and α ∈ V. 
 
Example 3.2.1: Let Zo be the semifield. Zo[x] is a semivector over Zo. 
 
Example 3.2.2: Let Qo be the semifield. Ro is a semivector space over Qo. 
 
Example 3.2.3: Qo is a semivector space over the semifield Zo. 
It is important to note that Zo is not a semivector space over Qo. Similarly Zo is not a 
semivector space over Ro. 
 
Example 3.2.4: Let Mn×n = {(aij) | aij ∈ Zo}; the set of all n × n matrices with entries 
from Zo. Clearly Mn×n is a semivector space over Zo. 
 
Example 3.2.5: Let V = Zo × Zo × … × Zo (n times), V is a semivector space over Zo. 
It is left for the reader to verify. 
 
Example 3.2.6: Let Cn be a chain lattice. Cn[x] is a semivector space over Cn. 
 
Example 3.2.7: Let V = Cn × Cn × Cn, V is a semivector space over Cn. It is left for the 
reader to verify.

3.3 Properties about semivector spaces. 
 
In this section we introduce some basic concepts like linear combination, linearly 
dependent, linearly independent, spanning set and subsemivector spaces and illustrate 
them with examples. Further we state several interesting results about semivector 
spaces and leave the proof of them as problems to the reader, as this text assumes the 
reader of a strong background in algebra. As the concept of semivector spaces was 
introduced in 1993 so we proceed to define related properties of semivector spaces. 
 
Let S be a semifield and V be a semivector space over S. If 
∑α
=
β
i
iv (vi ∈ V, αi ∈ 
S) which is in V, we use the terminology β is a linear combination of vi's. We also say 
β is linearly dependent on vi's if β can be expressed as a linear combination of vi's We 
see the relation is a non trivial relation if at least one of the coefficients αi's is non 
zero. This set {v1, v2, … , vk} satisfies a non trivial relation if vj is a linear 
combination of {v1, v2, … , vj-i, vj+i, … , vk}. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.1: A set of vectors in V is said to be linearly dependent if there exists 
a non-trivial relation among them; otherwise the set is said to be linearly 
independent. 
 
Example 3.3.1: Let Zo[x] be the semivector space over Zo. Now the set {1, x, x2, x3, 
… , xn} is a linearly independent set. But if we consider the set {1, x, x2, x3, …, xn, x3 
+ x2 + 1} it is a linearly dependent set. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.1: Let V be a semivector space over the semifield S. If α ∈ V is linearly 
dependent on {βi} and each βi is linearly dependent on {γi} then α is linearly 
dependent on {γi}. 
 
Proof: Let

Hence the claim. 
 
The main difference between vector spaces and semivector spaces is that we do not 
have negative terms in semifields over which semivector spaces are built. So as in the 
case of vector spaces we will not be in a position to say if α1v1 + … + αnvn = 0

. To overcome this difficulty we have to seek 
other types of arguments. But this simple property has lead to several distortion in the 
nature of semivector spaces as we cannot define dimension, secondly many 
semivector spaces have only one basis and so on. Here also we do not go very deep 
into the study of semivector spaces as the chief aim of this book is only on the 
analogues study of Smarandache notions. So for the reader we have suggested at the 
end of this section the books or paper to be read as supplementary reading. This book 

 
59 
at the end of each chapter has a set of books and papers enlisted for supplementary 
reading, which is a main feature of this book. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.2: Let V be a semivector space over the semifield S. For any subset A 
of V the set of all linear combination of vectors in A, is called the set spanned by A 
and we shall denote it by 〈A〉. It is a part of this definition, A ⊂ 〈A〉.  
 
Thus we have if A ⊂ B then 〈A〉 ⊂ 〈B〉. 
  
Consequent of this we can say the theorem 3.3.1 is equivalent to; if A ⊂ 〈B〉 and B ⊂ 
〈C〉 then A ⊂ 〈C〉. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.2: Let V and S be as in the earlier theorem. If B and C be any two 
subsets of V such that B ⊂ 〈C〉 then 〈B〉 ⊂ 〈C〉. 
 
Proof: Set A = 〈B〉 in theorem 3.3.1, then B ⊂ 〈C〉 implies 〈B〉 = A ⊂ 〈C〉.  
 
Now we still have many interesting observations to make if the set A is a linearly 
dependent set. We have the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 3.3.3: Let V be a semivector space over S. A = {α1, … ,αk} be a subset of V. 
If αi ∈ A is dependent on the other vectors in A then 〈A〉 = 〈A \ {αi}〉. 
 
Proof: The assumption is that αi ∈ A is dependent on A \ {αi,}, means that A ⊂ 〈A \ 
{αi}〉. It then follows from theorem 3.3.2 that 〈A〉 ⊆ 〈A \ {αi}〉. Equality follows from 
the fact that the inclusion in other direction is evident. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.3: A linearly independent set of a semivector space V over the 
semifield S is called a basis of V if that set can span the semivector space V. 
 
Example 3.3.2: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo be a semivector space over Zo. The only basis 
for V is {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} no other set can span V. 
 
This example is an evidence to show unlike vector spaces which can have any number 
of basis certain semivector spaces have only one basis. 
 
Example 3.3.3: Let Zo be a semifield. 
o
n
Z  [x] denote the set of all polynomials of 
degree less than or equal to n. 
o
n
Z [x] is a semivector space over Zo. The only basis for 
o
n
Z [x] is {1, x, x2, … , xn}.  
 
We have very distinguishing result about semivector spaces, which is never true in 
case of vector spaces. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.4: In a semivector space V, over the semifield S, the number of 
elements in a set which spans V need not be an upper bound for the number of vectors 
that can be linearly independent in V. 
 

 
60 
Proof: The proof is given by an example. Consider the semivector space V = Zo × Zo 
over Zo. We have {(0, 1), (1, 0)} to be the only basis of V. In particular this set spans 
V. But we can find in V = Zo × Zo three vectors which are linearly independent. For 
example the set U = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0)} is a linearly independent set in V for none 
of them is expressible in terms of the others. But note that this set is not a basis for V 
as this set does not span V. This can be found from the fact (1, 3) ∈ V but it is not 
expressible as a linear combination of elements from U. Note that U ∪ {(1, 3)} is a 
linearly independent set. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.5: Let V be a semivector space over the semifield S. For any set C ⊂ V 
we have 〈〈C〉〉 = 〈C〉. 
 
Proof: Clearly 〈C〉 ⊆ 〈〈C〉〉. Now replacing B = 〈C〉 in theorem 3.3.2 we have 〈〈C〉〉 ⊆ 
〈C〉. Hence we have the equality 〈C〉 = 〈〈C〉〉. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.4: Let V be a semivector space over the semifield S with the property 
that V has a unique basis. Then we define the number of elements in the basis of V to 
be the dimension of V. 
 
A semivector space is finite dimensional if the space has a unique basis and the 
number of elements in it is finite.  
 
Example 3.3.4: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo (5 times) be a semivector space over 
Zo. Clearly dimension of V is 5. 
 
Example 3.3.5: Let V = 
0
7
Z [x] = {set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal 
to 7 with coefficient from Zo} be a semivector space over Zo. The dimension of V is 8. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.6: In a n- dimensional semivector space we need not have in general, 
every set of n + 1 vectors to be linearly independent. 
 
Proof: We have seen in case of the semivector space V = Z0 × Z0 over Z0, which is of 
dimension 2, has the 3 vectors {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0)} to be linearly independent.  
 
This is a unique property enjoyed only by semivector spaces which can never be true 
in case of vector space for in case of vector spaces we know if dimension of a vector 
space is n then the vector space cannot contain more than n linearly independent 
vectors.  
 
Now we proceed on to build semivector spaces using lattices.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.7: All finite lattices are semivector spaces over the two element 
Boolean algebra C2.  
 
Proof: Let (L, ∪, ∩) be any finite lattice. We see L is a semivector space over C2. All 
axioms of the semivector space are true. To show scalar multiplication is distributive 
we have to prove s ∩ (a ∪ b) = (s ∩ a) ∪ (s ∩ b) for all a, b ∈ L and s ∈ C2 = (0, 1). 
The two values s can take are either s = 0 or s = 1.  
 

 
61 
In case s = 0 we have 0 ∩ (a ∪ b) = 0 (zero is the least element), (0 ∩ a) ∪ (0 ∩ b) = 
0. 
 
When s = 1 we have1 ∩ (a ∪ b) = a ∪ b (1 is the greatest element) 
(1 ∩ a) ∪ (1 ∩ b) = a ∪ b. Hence the claim. 
 
Thus we can easily verify all lattices L whether L is a distributive lattice or otherwise 
L is a semivector space over the semifield C2. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.5: A subsemivector space W of a semivector space V over a semifield 
S is a non-empty subset of V, which is itself, a semivector space with respect to the 
operations of addition and scalar multiplication. 
 
Remark: The whole space V and the {0} element are trivially the subsemivector 
spaces of every semivector space V. 
 
Example 3.3.6: Ro is a semivector space over Zo. Qo the subset of Ro is a non-trivial 
subsemivector space of Ro. 
 
Example 3.3.7: Zo[x] is a semivector space over Zo. All polynomials of even degree in 
Zo[x] denoted by S is a subsemivector space over Zo. 
 
Example 3.3.8: Let C2 be the semifield, the lattice L with the following Hasse 
diagram is a vector space over C2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let S ⊂ L where S = {1, a, e, d, 0} is subsemivector space over C2.

THEOREM 3.3.8: Let V be a semivector space over the semifield S. The intersection of 
any collection of subsemivector spaces is a subsemivector space of V. 
 
Proof: The proof is as in the case of vector spaces.  
 
Several other results from vector spaces can be adopted whenever possible, and at 
times it may not be possible to adopt them, So as the case may be, extension or 
introduction of the properties of vector spaces is done in case of semivector spaces. A 
property, which is different basically, is given below. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.9: In a semivector space an element need not in general have a unique 
representation in terms of its basis elements. 
 
Proof: This is proved by an example. Let C4 be the chain lattice with elements say (0, 
b, a, 1) 0 < b < a <1. C4 is a semivector space over C2. Note the set {1, a, b} is a 
linearly independent set as none of the elements in the given set is expressible as a 
linear combination of others. Further {1, a, b} spans C4. So {1, a, b} is a basis, in fact 
a unique basis. It is interesting to note that the elements a and 1 do not have a unique 
representation in terms of the basis elements for we have  
 
a = 1 • a + 0 • b + 0 • 1 
= 1 • a + 1 • b + 0 • 1 
1 = 0 • a + 0 • b + 1 • 1 
= 1 • a + 1 • b + 1 • 1 
= 1 • a + 0 • b + 1 • 1 
= 0 • a + 1 • b + 1 • 1. 
 
This is a unique feature enjoyed by semivector spaces built using lattices.  
Lastly we proceed to define linear transformation and linear operators on semivector 
spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.6: Let V1 and V2 be any two semivector spaces over the semifield S. 
We say a map / function T: V1 → V2 is a linear transformation of semivector spaces if 
T (av + u) = aT(v) + T(u) for all u, v ∈ V1 and a ∈ S. 
 
Example 3.3.10: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo and 
o
6
Z [x] be semivector spaces defined over 
Zo. Define T: V → 
o
6
Z [x] by 
 
T (1, 0, 0) = x6 + x5 
T (0, 1, 0) = x3 + x4 
T (0, 0, 1) = x2 + x + 1 
T (9 (3, 2, 1) + 6 (1, 3, 0)) = 9 [3 (x6 + x5) + 2 (x3 + x4) + x2 + x + 1] + 6 [x6 + x5 + 3 
(x3 + x4) + 0 (x2 + x + 1)]  = 33x6 + 33x5 + 36x4 + 36x3 + 9x2 + 9x +9. 
T (9 (3, 2, 1) + 6 (1, 3, 0)) = T ((33, 36, 9)) = 33x6 +33x5 + 36x4 + 36x3 +9x2 +9x +9. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.7: Let V be a semivector space over S. A map/ function T from V to V 
is called a linear operator of the semivector space V if T (αv + u) = αT(v) + T(u) for 
all α ∈ S and v, u ∈ V. 

 
63 
 
Example 3.3.11: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo be a semivector space over Zo. Define T: 
V → V by 
 
T(1, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 1, 0, 0) 
T(0, 1, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 1, 0) 
T(0, 0, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 0, 1) 
T(0, 0, 0, 1) = (1, 0, 0, 0) 
 
It can be verified T is a linear operator on V.

CHAPTER FOUR 
SMARANDACHE SEMIRINGS 
 
In this chapter we introduce and analyse the concept of Smarandache semiring. This 
chapter has six sections. The first section is devoted just to the introduction of the 
concept of Smarandache semiring and explaining them by illustrative examples. In the 
second section we introduce the substructures like Smarandache subsemiring, 
Smarandache ideals, Smarandache commutative semirings, Smarandache pseudo 
subsemirings, Smarandache dual ideals and so on and obtain some interesting results 
about them. 
 
The next section is devoted to the study of special elements in Smarandache semirings 
(S-semirings). Using the recent literature of semirings corresponding S-semirings are 
defined and analysed in the chapter on special S-semirings. As in Smarandache 
notions there can be layers or levels of S-semigroups, this section defines S-semirings 
of level II so that it goes without saying that S-semirings which are studied till this 
point are S-semirings of level I. It is pertinent to mention here that except the concept 
of idempotent semiring all substructures constructed using S-semiring of level II are 
distinctly different from S-semiring of level I. The S-semiring of level II is achieved 
only by Smarandache mixed direct product. As all Smarandache notions are in a way 
non-classical mathematics, the final section is devoted to the study of Smarandache 
anti-semirings. Each section is filled with examples and problems for the student to 
take things in a serious way. As these solving process of problems will create in 
researchers and students a gripping interest in these concepts.  
 
 
4. 1 Definition of S-semirings and examples 
 
In this section we define Smarandache semirings and illustrate them by several 
examples. As this notion is very recent (2001) we explain it elaborately and 
substantiate it with examples. Further even the notion of the semirings is not found in 
literature in the form of specialized text books so we felt it essential to explain S-
semirings.  
 
DEFINITION (SMARANDACHE, FLORENTIN): The Smarandache semiring S which will 
be denoted from here onwards as S-semiring is defined to be a semiring S such that a 
proper subset B of S is a semifield (with respect to the same induced operation). This 
is φ ≠ B ⊂ S.  
 
Example 4.1.1: Let Qo be the semiring. Qo is a S-semiring, as Zo ⊂ Qo is a proper 
subset which is a semifield.  
 
Example 4.1.2: Let Zo be a semiring. Zo is not a S-semiring. Zo does not have any 
proper subset which is a semifield. In view of this we have the following. 
 

 
66 
THEOREM 4.1.1: Every semiring in general need not be a S-semiring.  
 
Proof: By an example. Zo is a semiring which is a not a S-semiring. Also take the 
chain lattice C2; C2 is not a S-semiring for C2 cannot have a proper subset which is a 
semifield.  
 
Example 4.1.3: Let Zo[x] be the polynomial semiring. Zo[x] is a S-semiring as Zo ⊂ 
Zo[x] is a semifield.  
 
Example 4.1.4: Let C2[x] be the polynomial semiring. C2[x] is a S-semiring, as C2 ⊂ 
C2[x] is a semifield.  
 
THEOREM 4.1.2: All distributive lattices L with 0 and 1 and having more than 2 
elements are S-semirings.  
 
Proof: Given L is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1. So L is a semiring. Since L 
contains 0 and 1, the set A = (0, 1) ⊂ L; A is a semifield so L is a S-semiring.  
 
We have seen examples of commutative S-semirings. Now we will see the structure 
of both finite and infinite non-commutative S-semirings.  
 
Example 4.1.5: Let Mn×n = {(aij)/aij ∈ Zo} be the set of all n × n matrices with entries 
from Zo. Mn×n is a semiring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. Clearly 
Mn×n is a non-commutative semiring. Mn×n is a S-semiring for if we take A = {(aij)/aij 
= 0 if i ≠ j and aii ∈ Zo\ {0}} ∪ {The zero matrix}. Then A ⊂ Mn×n is a semifield so 
Mn×n  is a S-semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.1: If the S-semiring has only finite number of elements we say the S-
semiring is finite otherwise infinite. 
 
Example 4.1.6: Let M3×3 be the set of all 3 × 3 matrices with entries from the 
distributive lattice L having the following Hasse diagram

 ⊂ M3×3, A is

Example 4.1.7: Let Zo be the semiring. S = Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo is a semiring under 
component wise addition and multiplication. S is a S-semiring but Zo is not a S-
semiring.  
 
Thus the concept of direct product helps us to convert a non S-semiring into a S-
semiring. Of course we will still see many more interesting properties about these 
direct products.

In this section we introduce many substructures in S-semirings like S-subsemirings, 
S-commutative semirings, S-non-commutative semirings, S-right(left) ideals, S-ideals 
in semirings and S-quotient semirings; study them and illustrate them with examples. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.1: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to be 
a Smarandache subsemiring (S-subsemiring) if A is S-semiring i.e. A has a proper 
subset P such that P is a semifield under the operations of S.  
 
An immediate consequence of this is the following result.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.1: Let S be a semiring having a S-subsemiring then S is a S-semiring. 
 
Proof: Given S is a semiring and A ⊂ S is a S-subsemiring of S; so A has a proper 
subset P ⊂ A such that P is a semifield. Now P ⊂ A ⊂ S, so P ⊂ S is a semifield. 
Hence S is a S-semiring.  
 
In view of this theorem it is not essential in the definition of S-subsemiring to mention 
that S is a S-semiring for the very definition of S-subsemiring forces S to be a S-
semiring.  
 
Example 4.2.1: Let Zo[x] be the semiring. Zo[x] has a proper S-subsemiring, for take 
A = {set of all polynomials of even degree with coefficients from Zo}. Clearly A is a 
S-subsemiring as Zo ⊂ A is a semifield.  
 
All S-semirings need not have S-subsemirings. Further all subsemirings of S need not 
be S-subsemirings of S.  We illustrate these by the following examples. 
 
Example 4.2.2: Let Zo be the semiring. Zo has subsemirings viz. pz = {0, p, 2p, …} 
for every integer p. But none of these subsemirings are S-subsemirings, also Zo is not 
a S-semiring.  
 
Thus this example asserts if S is not a S-semiring. S has subsemirings but none of 
them are S-subsemirings.   
 
Example 4.2.3: Let S be a semiring given by the following lattice whose Hasse 
diagram is:

Now S is a S-semiring for [0,1] = A ⊂ S is a semifield of S. Now S has several 
subsemiring but all of them are not S-subsemirings. For take the set A = {d, b, c, a, 0} 
in S. A is a subsemiring of S but A is not a S-subsemiring of S as A has no subfields 
contained in them.  
 
In view of this we have the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.2: Every subsemiring of a S-semiring need not in general be a S-
subsemiring.  
 
Proof: To prove this consider the example 4.2.3 Clearly S is a S-semiring. Take A = 
{0, a}, A is a subsemiring of S but A is not a S-subsemiring of S. Hence the claim.  
 
Example 4.2.4: Now consider the semiring M3×3 = {(aij)/aij ∈ Zo}. M3×3 is a S-
semiring. Let A =

DEFINITION 4.2.2: Let S be a S-semiring. We say S is a Smarandache commutative 
semiring (S-commutative semiring) if S has a S-subsemiring which is commutative. If 
the S-semiring has no commutative S-subsemiring then we say S is a Smarandache 
non-commutative semiring (S-non commutative semiring).  
 
The following facts are interesting about such S-semirings. If S is a semiring, which is 
commutative then trivially, S is a S-commutative semiring provided S is a S-semiring. 
 
The important factor to be observed is even if S is not a commutative semiring still S 
can be a S-commutative semiring, which is evident from the following example.  
 
Example 4.2.5: The semiring M3×3 described in example 4.2.4 is a non-commutative 
semiring which is a S-semiring. But M3×3 is a S-commutative semiring as the S-

Hence the claim.  
 
Example 4.2.6: A S-commutative semiring need not be a commutative semiring.  
 
Proof: By an example. In the example 4.2.5 M3×3 is a non-commutative semiring but 
is a S-commutative semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.3: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache right (left) ideal (S-right (left) ideal) of S if the following conditions are 
satisfied. 
   
1. P is a S-subsemiring.  
2. For every p ∈ P and A ⊂ P where A is the semifield of P we 
have for all a ∈ A and p ∈ P, ap (pa) is in A.   
 
If P is simultaneously both a S-right ideal and a S-left ideal then we say P is a 
Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) of S.

From this example we derive the following result.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.3: Let S be a S-semiring. Every S-ideal of S is a S-subsemiring of S but 
every S-subsemiring of S in general need not be a S-ideal of S.  
 
Proof: Clearly by the very definition of the S-ideal we see every S-ideal is a S-
subsemiring. Conversely to show every S-subsemiring in general need not be an S-
ideal of S. We give the following example. Clearly the subset A =

 in M2×2 given in example 4.2.8 is a S-subsemiring which is 
not an S-ideal of M2×2. Hence the claim.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.4: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to be 
Smarandache pseudo-subsemiring (S-pseudo subsemiring) if the following condition 
is true. 
 
If there exists a subset P of S such that A ⊂ P; where P is a S-subsemiring i.e. P has a 
subset B such that B is a semifield under the operations of S or P itself is a semifield 
under the operations of S.  
 
Example 4.2.9: Let S be the semiring which is a lattice having the following Hasse 
diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S is S-semiring. Let A = {0, a, b, d}. Now A is a S-pseudo subsemiring for A ⊂ B = 
{1, a, b, d, 0}. Hence the claim. We see all subsets need not be S-pseudo 
subsemirings. Let A = {0, a, d, b, c}. Clearly A cannot be contained in a proper 
semifield. So the set A = {0, a, b, c, d} is not a S-pseudo subsemiring.

THEOREM 4.2.4: Let S be a semiring every proper subset of S need not in general be a 
S-pseudo subsemiring. 
 
Proof: By an example. Consider the semiring given in example 4.2.9. The set {0, a, b, 
c, d} is not a S-pseudo subsemiring. 
 
THEOREM 4.2.5: Let S be a semiring if S contains a S-pseudo subsemiring then S is a 
S-semiring.  
 
Proof: S is a semiring. S contains a S-pseudo subsemiring A; i.e. A is contained in a 
semifield P, P contained in S. So S is a S-semiring.  
 
The concept of S-pseudo subsemiring leads to the definition of S-pseudo ideals in the 
semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.5: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo right(left) ideal (S-pseudo right (left) ideal) of the semiring S if 
the following conditions are true. 
 
1. P is a S-pseudo subsemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A a semifield in S.  
2. For every p ∈ P and every a ∈ A, ap ∈ P (pa ∈ P). 
 
If P is simultaneously both a S-pseudo right ideal and S-pseudo left ideal we say P is 
a Smarandache pseudo ideal (S-pseudo ideal).  
 
Now we define two new notions about S-semiring viz. Smarandache dual ideal and 
Smarandache pseudo dual ideal of a semiring S.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.6: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache dual ideal of S (S-dual ideal) if the following conditions hold good.  
 
1. P is a S-subsemiring 
2. For every p ∈ P and a ∈ A\{0} a + p is in A, where A ⊂ P.

S is a S-semiring. Let P = {0, a, b, d, 1}. P is a S-dual ideal of S. For A = {0, 1} is a 
semifield.

is a semifield.  
 
Example 4.2.12: Let Zo[x] be the S-semiring. P = {Z2
o[x] = all polynomials of even 
degree}. 
 
P is a S-subsemiring for Zo ⊂ Z2
o[x] so Zo is a semifield. Thus P is not a S-dual ideal. 
If we take P = Z2
o[x]. Clearly P is not a S-ideal but P is a S-subsemiring, for Zo ⊂ 
Z2
o[x]. If p(x) ∈ Z2
o[x], p(x)Zo ⊄ Zo. Hence the claim. This leads to the following. 
 
THEOREM 4.2.6: Let S be a S-semiring. If P is a S-dual ideal then P need not be a S-
ideal.  
 
Proof: By example 4.2.11 the result in the theorem is true.  
 
Now we define S-pseudo dual ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.7: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo dual ideal (S-pseudo dual ideal) of S if the following conditions 
are true.  
 
1. P is a S-pseudo subsemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A is  a semifield in S or A contains a 
semifield. 
 
2. For every  p ∈ P and a ∈ A, p + a ∈ P. Clearly P is simultaneously left and 
right S-pseudo dual ideal of S as S is additively commutative.  
 
The reader is assigned the work of finding examples. Of course, several examples 
exist. Here we introduce yet another nice substructure in a semiring called a 
Smarandache semidivision ring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.8: Let S be a S-semiring. S is said to be a Smarandache semidivision 
ring (S-semidivision ring) if the proper subset A ⊂ S is such that  
 
1. A is a Smarandache subsemiring which is non-commutative.  
2. A contains a subset P such that P is a semidivision ring that is P has no zero 
divisors and P is a non-commutative semiring.  
 

 
74 
Remark: The concept of S-semidivision ring can be defined only when the semiring 
under consideration is non-commutative.

 then P is a semidivision ring. Hence M2×2 is 
a S-semidivision ring.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.8: Let S be a S-semidivision ring. Then we have two properties to be 
true.  
 
1. S is a S-semiring  
2. S has a S-subsemiring 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-semidivision ring, the results are true.  
 
The natural question would be if a semiring S has S-subsemiring A, then can we say 
A is a S-semidivision ring. The answer is, all S-subsemiring are not semidivision rings 
so A need not in general be a S-semidivision ring. This is illustrated by the following:

4.3 Smarandache Special Elements in S-Semirings 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache idempotents, Smarandache 
zero divisors, Smarandache units and Smarandache inverses in a semiring and 
illustrate them by examples and study them.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.1: Let S be any semiring. We say a and b ∈ S is a Smarandache zero 
divisor (S-zero divisor) if a • b  = 0 and there exists x, y ∈ S\{a, b, 0}, x ≠ y with  
 
1. ax = 0 or xa = 0 
2. by = 0 or yb = 0 and  
3. xy ≠ 0 or yx ≠ 0  
 
Clearly if S is a semifield we will not have S-zero divisors.  

 
76 
 
Example 4.3.1: Let S = Zo× Zo × Zo × Zo  be a semiring. Clearly S is a S-semiring as P 
= {(x, 0, 0, 0) / x ∈ Zo} is a semifield, P ⊂ Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo. Now a = (0, 0, 4, 2) and 
b = (5, 0, 0, 0) in S is such that a • b = (0, 0, 0, 0) i.e. they are zero divisors. Take x = 
(2, 8, 0, 0) and y = (0, 1, 0, 0) ∈ S\ {a, b, (0, 0, 0, 0)}. Clearly xa = 0 and ax = 0, yb = 
0 and by = 0, but xy = (0, 8, 0, 0) ≠ (0, 0, 0, 0). So a = (0, 0, 4, 2) is a S-zero divisor in 
S.

THEOREM 4.3.1: Let S be a semiring if x ∈ S is a S-zero divisor then x is a zero 
divisor.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of the S-zero divisor we see every S-zero divisor is a 
zero divisor.  
 
The converse of this theorem remains as an open problem. We define a concept called 
Smarandache anti zero divisor in a semiring S.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.2: Let S be a semiring. An element x ∈ S is said to be a Smarandache 
anti-zero divisor (S-anti zero divisor) if we can find a y such that xy ≠ 0 and a, b ∈ 
S\{0, x, y} such that  
 
1. ax ≠ 0 or xa ≠ 0 
2. by ≠ 0 or yb ≠ 0 
3. ab = 0 or ba = 0.

This leads us to the following theorem which is very unique in its own way.

THEOREM 4.3.3: Let S be a semiring. If S has a S-anti zero divisor then S has a non-
trivial zero divisor.  
 
Proof: From the very definition of the S-anti zero divisor in a semiring we are 
guaranteed of a non-trivial zero divisor in S.  
 
Example 4.3.4: Let S = Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo (7 times). Clearly S is a 
semiring with (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) as a unit and S has non-trivial zero divisors. To show 
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  is an S-anti zero divisor. Consider any x in S\{0}. x(1,1,1,1,1,1,1) 
= x. Let x = (0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0). Now let a = (2, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0) and b = (0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 
4). Clearly a(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ≠ 0, bx ≠ 0 but ab = 0. So (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) is an S-
anti zero divisor of S.  
 
We have the following result in view of these examples:  
 
THEOREM 4.3.4: If S is a semiring with unit and if S has zero divisors then the unit is 
an S-anti zero divisor.  
 
Proof: Given S has zero divisors say α, β ∈ S\{0} with αβ = 0. Let 1 be the identity 
of S. Choose any x, we have 1 • x ≠ 0 such that α • 1 ≠ 0, βx ≠ 0 but αβ = 0. Hence 
the claim.  
 
One may come to think only the unit of a semiring is a S-anti zero divisor. It is not so 
we have other elements to be also S-anti zero divisors, which is evident from the 
following example:  
 
Example 4.3.5: Let S = Zo× Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo  be the semiring. Clearly x = (1, 1, 1, 1, 
0) ∈ S. x • y1 = 0 for y1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 4) . But for y = (0, 0, 6, 7, 0) we have xy = (0, 0, 
6, 7, 0). Choose a = (3, 2, 0, 0, 0) and b = (0, 0, 0, 9, 2), ax = (3, 2, 0, 0, 0), by = (0, 0, 
0, 6, 3, 0). But a • b = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). Thus (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) is a S-anti zero divisor in this 
case the two things are to be observed:  
 
a. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) is a zero divisor.  
b. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) is not a unit.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache idempotents in a semiring S.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.3: Let S be a semiring. An element 0 ≠  a ∈ S is a Smarandache 
idempotent (S-idempotent) of S if  
 
i) 
a2 = a 
ii) 
There exists b ∈ S \{x} such that i) b2 = a and ii) ab = b (ba = b) 
or ba = a (ab = a) 
 
'or' in condition 2(ii) is mutually exclusive.  
 
Example 4.3.6: Let C2 be the chain lattice. S3 be the symmetric group of degree 3. 
C2S3 be the group semiring of the group S3 over the semiring C2. Now 1 + p4 + p5 ∈ 
S3 where

(1 + p4 + p5)2 = 1 + p4 + p5. Take p1 + p2 + p3 ∈ S3 is such that (p1 + p2 + p3)2 = 1 + p4 
+ p5. (1 + p4 + p5) (p1 + p2 + p3) =  p1 + p2 + p3. Thus 1 + p4 + p5 is a S-idempotent of 
C2S3.  
 
Example 4.3.7: Let S =  Zo× Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo (5 times). S is a semiring. S has non-
trivial idempotents which are other than (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  viz. (1, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0, 
0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0) …. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1,1) and (0, 1, 1, 1, 1). But none of them 
are S-idempotents.  
 
Thus we have the following theorem in view of this example.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.5: Let S be a semiring. Every idempotent in general need not be a S-
idempotent.  
 
Proof: In the semiring S in example 4.3.7 we see the idempotents in S = Zo × Zo × Zo 
× Zo × Zo are not S-idempotents.  
 
Next we proceed on to define S-units in a semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.4: Let S be a semiring with identity 1. We say x ∈ S\{1} to be a 
Smarandache unit (S-unit) if there exists a y ∈ S such that  
 
1. xy = 1 
2. There exists a, b ∈ S \{x, y, 1} such that (i) xa = y or ax = y, or (ii) yb = x or 
by = x and ab = 1.  
 
We leave it as an exercise for a reader to construct an example of a S-unit. We see as 
in the case of rings, group rings or semigroup rings which imply the existence of zero 
divisors if the ring has idempotents and alike results, can never be proved in case of 
semirings. For in a ring if e is a non-trivial idempotent (e ≠ 0 and e ≠ 1) such that e2 = 
e implies e2 – e = 0 so e (e – 1) = 0 is a zero divisor. But we cannot arrive at a zero 
divisor using the existence of an idempotent in case of semirings. 
 
Thus semirings have very unique and special properties enjoyed by them.

4.4 Special S-semirings 
 
In this section we introduce some special types of Smarandache semirings like 
Smarandache compact semiring, Smarandache e-semiring, Smarandache congruence 
simple semirings, Smarandache ∗- semirings, Smarandache inductive ∗ semirings and 
Smarandache chain semirings. We define and give examples of them wherever 
possible. Apart from this the reader is left to develop these concepts. Further we make 
a special assumption that when we say semirings we mean only semirings, which are 
not rings, as rings or fields are trivially semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.1: Let S be a semiring, we say S has a Smarandache congruence 
relation (S-congruence relation) ~ if we have a S-subsemiring A of S such that '~' is 
an equivalence relation that also satisfies

for all x1, x2, c∈ P ⊂ A where P is a semifield under the operations of S. A semiring S 
that admits no Smarandache congruence relation other than the trivial ones, identity 
and P × P, is that semiring which has no proper S- subsemiring on which the S-

 
81 
congruence relation can be defined, is called the Smarandache congruence simple 
semiring ( S-c-simple semiring).  
DEFINITION 4.4.2: Let S be Smarandache semigroup that is S is a semigroup which 
has a proper subset A ⊆ S and A is a group under the operations of S. We define for 
any S-semigroup V(S) = S∪ {∞}. Extend the multiplication in S to V(S) by the rule x∞ 
= ∞x = ∞ for all x ∈ V(S). Define an addition on V(S) by x + x = x and x + y = ∞ for 
all x, y ∈ V(S) with x ≠ y. 
 
We define this analogous to V(G) for any abelian group G defined by Chris Monico to 
define S-c-simple semiring. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.1: Let S be a finite semigroup. If S is S-commutative semigroup then 
V(S) is a S-c-simple semiring. 
 
Proof:  V(S) is S-c-simple whenever S is a Smarandache commutative semiring, that 
is S is a S-semiring and has at least a proper subset G ⊂ S where G is a commutative 
group under the operations of S. Hence the claim, as V(G) when G is a finite 
commutative group is a S-c-simple semiring.  
 
Example 4.4.1: Let S(4) be the semigroup of mappings of the set (x1, x2, x3, x4) to 
itself. V(S(4)) is a S-c-semiring. For the group G generated by

 is 
cyclic of degree 4. Hence the claim. 
 
Example 4.4.2: Let S(n) be a multiplicative semigroup of maps from a set of n 
elements to itself. V(S(n)) will be a S-c-simple semiring. For V(S(n)) contains a group 
G generated by

 which is a cyclic group of degree n 
which is abelian. Now V(G) ⊂ V(S(n)) so V(S(n)) is a S-c-simple semiring. In view 
of this we have the following theorem, which gives a class of S-commutative c-simple 
finite semirings. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.2: V(S(n)) is a S-commutative congruence simple semiring for all finite 
positive integer n. 
 
Proof: Since every S(n) is a S-semigroup and every S(n) has proper subsets which are 
abelian groups we have the result to be true. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.3: V(S(n)) has at least (n-1) proper subsets which are abelian groups. 
So V(S(n)) is a S-commutative congruence simple finite semiring.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact for every m, 1 < m < n we have cyclic group of order m, 
which we denote by Gm, so that V(Gm) is a commutative, congruence simple finite 
semiring, hence V(S(n)) is a S-commutative congruence simple finite semiring. 
 
Using the classical theorem of Cayley which states, "Every group is isomorphic to a 
subgroup of A(S) for some appropriate S". We can modify it and restate it as " Every 
finite abelian group is isomorphic to a subgroup of Sn for some appropriate n". Now 

 
82 
we use the analogue of this classical theorem for S-semigroups which is given by us 
as "Every S-semigroup is isomorphic to a S-subsemigroup in S(n)". 
 
Using this we have the following very interesting result. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.4: Let G be a finite abelian group V(G) be isomorphic to S for some 
commutative congruence simple finite semiring. Then there exists a suitable n so that 
every V(G) has a isomorphic image in the S-c-simple semiring V(S(n)) for a suitable 
n. 
 
Proof: We know by classical Cayley's theorem. G is isomorphic a subgroup in Sn for a 
suitable n. Now each Sn ⊂ S(n) and we have S(n) is a S-semigroup.  
 
Now V(G) ⊂ V(Sn) s⊂ V(S(n)) so we have the theorem to be true. 
 
Example 4.4.3: Let Cn be a chain lattice with n-elements,  Mt×t be the collection of all 
t × t matrices with entries from Cn. Mt×t is a S-finite congruence simple semiring. 
Thus we have a class of Smarandache finite congruence simple semiring for varying t. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.3: Let S be a semiring we say S is a Smarandache right chain 
semiring (S-right chain semiring) if the S-right ideals of S are totally ordered by 
inclusion. Similarly we define Smarandache left chain semiring (S-left chain 
semiring). If all the S-ideals are totally ordered by inclusion we say S is a 
Smarandache chain semiring (S-chain semiring).  
 
Example 4.4.4: Let C9 be a chain lattice, which is a semiring of order 9. Clearly C9 is 
a S-chain semiring. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.5: All chain lattices are S-chain semirings. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to verify. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.4: Let S be a semiring. If S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂… is a monotonic ascending chain 
of S-ideals Si, and there exists a positive integer r such that Sr = Ss for all s ≥ r. then 
we say the semiring S satisfies the Smarandache ascending chain conditions (S-acc) 
for S-ideals in the semiring S. 
 
Example 4.4.5: If we take the semiring S to be any chain lattice S, then it satisfies S-
acc. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.5: Let S be any semiring. We say S satisfies Smarandache descending 
chain condition (S-dcc) on S-ideals Si if every strictly decreasing sequence of S-ideals 
N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ N3 ⊃… in S is of finite length. The Smarandache min condition (S – mc) for 
S-ideals holds in S if given any set P of S-ideals in S, there is an ideal of P that does 
not properly contain any other ideal in the set P. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.6: Let S be a chain ring such that S-acc for ideals holds in S. The 
Smarandache maximum condition (S-MC) for S-ideals holds in S if for every non- 
empty set P of S-ideals in S contains a S-ideal not properly contained in any other S-
ideal of the set P. 

 
83 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.7: Let S be a semiring we say S is a Smarandache compact semiring 
(S-compact semiring) if A ⊂ S where A is a S subsemiring of S is a compact semiring 
under the operations of S. It is important to note if S is to be a S-compact semiring it 
is not necessary that S is a compact semiring. If S has a S-subsemiring which is a 
compact subsemiring then it is sufficient.  
 
So we have the following. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.6: If S is a compact semiring and S is a S-semiring then S is a S-
compact semiring provided S has a S-subsemiring. 
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of S-compact semiring. 
 
Example 4.4.6: All chain semirings Cn[x] are S-compact semirings. For Cn ⊂ Cn[x] is 
a S-subsemiring of Cn[x] which is a compact semiring as a . b = b and a + b = a. 
 
Example 4.4.7: Let X be a set with n elements, P(X) the power set of X which is the 
Boolean  algebra. Hence P(X) is a semiring. P(X) is a S-compact semiring for every 
chain in P(X) connecting X and φ is a S-subsemiring which is a compact semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.8: Let S be a semiring, S is said to be Smarandache ∗-semiring (S-∗-
semiring) if S contains a proper subset A satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. A is a subsemiring 
2. A is a S-subsemiring  
3. A is a∗-semiring 
 
So if S is a ∗- semiring and if S has a S-subsemiring then obviously S is a S-∗-
semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.9: Let S be any semiring. We say S is a Smarandache inductive ∗-
semiring (S-inductive ∗-semiring) if S contains a proper subset A such that the 
following conditions are true 
 
1. A is a subsemiring of S. 
2. A is a S-subsemiring of S 
3. A is inductive ∗-semiring. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.7: If S is a inductive ∗-semiring and S has a S-subsemiring then S is a 
Smarandache inductive ∗-semiring. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-inductive ∗-semirings 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.10: A semiring S is said to be a Smarandache continuous semiring 
(S-continuous) if a proper subsemiring A of S satisfies the following 2 conditions 
 
1. A is a S- subsemiring. 
2. A is a continuous semiring. 

 
84 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.11: Let S be a semiring. S is said to be a Smarandache idempotent 
semiring (S-idempotent semiring) if A proper subset P of S, which is a subsemiring of 
S satisfies the following conditions: 
 
1. P is a S-subsemiring.  
2. P is an idempotent semiring. 
 
Example 4.4.8: Let C7[x] be the polynomial semiring. C7[x] is a S-idempotent 
semiring for  C7 ⊂ C7[ x] is  
 
1. Subsemiring of C7[x]. 
2. C7 is a S-subsemiring. 
3. In C7 we have a + a = a for all a ∈ C7. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.12: Let S be a semiring. S is said to be a Smarandache e-semiring (S-
e-semiring) if S contains a proper subset A satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. A is a subsemiring 
2. A is a S-subsemiring  
3. A is a e-semiring 
 
Example 4.4.9: Let Cn[x] be a polynomial semiring over the semiring Cn (the chain 
lattice with n elements). Cn[x] is a S-e-semiring for Cn ⊂ Cn[x] satisfies all conditions. 
Cn is clearly a S-e-semiring.   
 
DEFINITION 4.4.13: Let S be any semiring. G be a Smarandache semigroup. Consider 
the semigroup semiring SG. We call SG the Smarandache group semiring.(S-group 
semiring) 
 
Example 4.4.10: Let ZoS(n) be the semigroup semiring. ZoS(n) is a Smarandache 
group semiring.  
 
Then the natural question would be what is the definition of Smarandache semigroup 
semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.14: Let G be a group, G is a Smarandache anti group, that is G 
contains a proper subset which is a semigroup. The group semiring FG where F is 
any semiring is called the Smarandache semigroup semiring.(S-semigroup semiring) 
 
Example 4.4.11: Let Q+ be the group under multiplication. Clearly Z+ is a semigroup 
in Q+. Consider C3 a chain lattice, that is a semiring, C3Q+ is a Smarandache 
semigroup semiring. 
 
We are not able to construct any finite Smarandache semigroup semiring, as we do 
not have examples of finite group, which contain proper subsets which are 
semigroups. This is left as an open problem.

4.5 S-semiring of second level 
 
 
As inspired and suggested by Minh Perez in this section, I venture to define 
what are called Smarandache semirings (S-semirings) of second level. All semirings 
studied in the sections 4.1 to 4.4 are S-semirings of first level. Even to define the very 
concept of second level S-semiring we define a new Smarandache mixed direct 
product. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.1: Let S1 and S2 be two different algebraic structures. We define 
Smarandache mixed direct product (S-mixed direct product) as S1 × S2 where S1 × S2 
= {(s1, s2) / s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2} so the S-mixed direct product will enjoy 
simultaneously or separately the properties of the algebraic structures S1 and S2. 
 
Example 4.5.1: Let Zo be the semiring. Z7 be the field, S = Zo × Z7 is a semiring, is the 
Smarandache mixed direct product. The semiring S contains {0} × Z7 ⊆ Zo × Z7 as a 
field paving way for us to define the second level Smarandache semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.2: A semiring S is said to be a Smarandache semiring of II level or 
Smarandache semiring of level II (S-semiring of level II) if S contains a proper subset 
P, which is a field. 
 
Example 4.5.2: Let S = C10 × Q be the S-mixed direct product of the semiring C10 and 
the field Q. Clearly S is a semiring and S is in fact a S-semiring of II level. 
 
Examp4le 4.5.3: Let S = Zo × Q. This is also a semiring, which is a S-semiring of 
level II. 
 
We see that if S is just a semiring not got as a S-mixed direct product we see S cannot 
contain a proper subset which is a field. Clearly S-semiring of level II are richer 
structures than the S-semiring of level I. 
 
Example 4.5.4: Let S = Z5 × C10 is a S-semiring of level II, S has S-ideals and S-
subsemiring and S is also an S-idempotent semiring. 
 
Example 4.5.5: S = C2 × R is a S-semiring of level II, S1 = C2 × Ro is a S-subsemiring. 
S2 = C2 × Qo is also a S-subsemiring but S3 = {0} × Zo is not a S-subsemiring. So we 
see as in the case of S-semirings of level I we can have subsemirings which may not 
in general be a S-subsemiring of level II.  
 
THEOREM 4.5.1: All S-semirings of level II are non-strict semiring. 
 
Proof: Given S is a S-semiring of level II we know this means S contains a proper 
subset P which is a field. So in P we have x + y = 0 with x ≠ 0 and y ≠0 as P is a field. 
So all S-semirings of level II are non strict semirings.  
 
In view of this we see that only S-semirings of level II alone can give way to non 
strict semirings, as we do not know any S-semiring of level I which is not a strict 
semiring. Thus we see that there exist a clear distinction between S-semirings of level 
I and level II. 

 
87 
 
Example 4.5.6: S = Z7 × C3 is a S-semiring of level II. Clearly (5, 0) + (2, 0) = (0, 0), 
(3, 0) + (4, 0) = (0, 0). In fact S has S-ideals of the from S = Z7 × {0, a}.  
 
These examples forces us to define Smarandache substructures in a different way. We 
find no change between two levels in case of S-zero divisors, S-units and S-
idempotents. But we see we have to redefine S-subsemirings and S-ideals. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.3: Let S be a S-semiring of level II. we say a proper subset A of S will 
be called a Smarandache subsemiring of level II (S-subsemiring II) if A contains a 
proper subset P which is a field. 
 
Example 4.5.7: Let S = L × Z11, where L is the lattice with Hasse diagram  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Z11 the prime field of characteristic 11. S is a S-semiring of level II. A = {1, 0} × 
Z11 is a S-subsemiring of level II. A S-semiring of level II can contain S-subsemiring 
of level I also. 
 
Example 4.5.8: Let S = C8 × Z, S is not a S-semiring of level II. The set A = {0, 1} × 
2Z is a S- subsemiring for {0, 1} × {0} is a semifield. 
 
In view of this we have the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 4.5.2: If S is a semiring of level II, in general S can have both S- 
subsemirings of level I and II. 
 
Proof: Obvious by examples. 
 
THEOREM 4.5.3: If  S is a S-semiring of level I which is not of level II. S cannot have a 
S-subsemiring of level II. 
 
Proof: If the S-semiring has a S-subsemiring of Level II then S contains a proper 
subset A such that A has a proper subset which is a field so this in turn will make S a 
S-semiring of level II a contrary to our assumption S is a S-semiring of level I only 
and not of level II. Hence the claim.

DEFINITION 4.5.4: Let S be a semiring, which is a S-semiring of level II. A proper 
subset A of S is said to be a Smarandache right ideal of level II (S-right (Left) ideal II) 
if A is a S-subsemiring of level II and for all a ∈ A and for all s ∈ P ⊂ A (where P is a 
field) we have sa ∈ P (or as ∈ P). 
 
If S is a S-semiring and A is simultaneously a S-right ideal II and a S-left ideal II we 
say A is a Smarandache ideal of level II (S-ideal II). 
 
Example 4.5.9: Let S = Z10 × Zo, S is a S-semiring of level II for A = {0, 5} × {0} is a 
field and (5, 0) is its identity. Also A1 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} × {0} is a field with {6, 0} as 
the identity. We can get S-ideal II from these semirings as {0, 5} × 2Zo is an S-ideal II 
of S, Now P = {0, 6} × 3Zo is another S-ideal II of S. 
 
Example 4.5.10: S = C6 × Z12 is S-semiring of level II for {0} ×{0, 4, 8} is a subfield 
of S. 
 
THEOREM 4.5.4: Let S be S-semiring of level II given by S = Cn × Zp where Zp is a 
prime field of characteristic p. Then S is a Smarandache commutative congruence 
simple finite semiring. 
 
Proof: S = Cn × Zp has a S-subsemiring which is a Smarandache-commutative 
congruence simple finite semiring. (For more details refer Chris Monico). 
 
Remark: Only S-semiring of II level can be S commutative c-simple finite semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.5: Let S be a S-semiring of level II. S is said to satisfy Smarandache 
assending chain condition II (S-accII) if S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ … is a monic ascending chain of S-
ideals Si (of level II) and there exists a positive integer r such that Sr = Ss for all s ≥ r. 
 
Thus we see S-acc II is different from S-acc. The reader to requested to construct 
examples in S-semirings of level II which have both sets of S-acc's that is S-acc and 
S-acc II are satisfied. Clearly a S-semiring of level I can never satisfy S-acc II. 
 
Similarly we define S-dcc II for S-semirings of level II. Here also a S-semiring of 
level I can never satisfy the S-dcc II condition. Now we proceed on to define compact 
semiring of level II. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.6: Let S be a S-semiring of Level II. S is said to be a Smarandache 
compact semiring of level II (S-compact II semiring), if A ⊂ S where A is a S-
subsemiring II of S is a compact subsemiring under the operations of S. Here also if S 
is a S-semiring of level I then S cannot be a S-compact II semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.7: Let S be a semiring, which is a S-semiring of II level. S is said to 
be Smarandache ∗ semiring of level II (S-∗ semiring II) if S contains a proper subset 
A satisfying the following conditions 
 
1. A is a subsemiring of S 
2. A is a S-subsemiring of Level II. 
3. A is a ∗-semiring. 

 
89 
 
So if S is a S-∗semiring II then S need not be a S ∗-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.8: Let S be a S-semiring of level II. S is said to be Smarandache 
inductive ∗ semiring II (S inductive ∗ -semiring II) if S contains a proper subset A 
satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. A is a subsemiring of S. 
2. A is a S-subsemiring II 
3. A is a inductive ∗- semiring  
 
It is easily verified a S-semiring of level I can never be a S-∗ semiring of level II or S-
inductive ∗ -semiring of level II. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.9: Let S be a S-semiring of level II. S is said to be Smarandache 
continuous semiring of level II (S-continuous semiring II) if a proper subset A of S 
satisfies the following condition: 
 
1. A is a S-subsemiring of level II 
2. A is a continuous semiring 
 
In case of S semiring of level II also, the definition remains the same as that of the 
definition of S-idempotent semiring given in S-semiring of level I. While defining for 
S-semiring of level II the concept of Smarandache e-semiring we replace the 
subsemiring A which is a S-subsemiring by S-subsemiring of level II and A is a e-
semiring. Thus with these definitions about substructures in S-semiring of level II we 
propose the following problems for the reader to solve. 
 
Notation: A semiring of all types in level two will shortly be denoted by S-semiring II 
for example S-continuous semiring II etc.

4.6 Smarandache Anti Semiring 
 
Here we introduce yet an interesting property of semiring viz. Smarandache anti 
semiring. Florentin Smarandache has introduced a new concept called Smarandache 
anti structures. A set that is a strong structure contain a proper subset that has a 
weaker structure, for example if G is a group, we consider a subset S of G that is a 
semigroup, for the stronger structure groups contain subsets which are semigroups 
which are known as Smarandache anti semigroups. Suppose Z denotes the group 
under + we see Z+ the set of integers without zero is a semigroup. Like wise we 
introduce here the concept of Smarandache anti semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.6.1: Let R be a ring. R is said to be Smarandache anti semiring (S-anti 
semiring) if R contains a subset S such that S is just a semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.1: Let Z be the ring. Z is an S-anti semiring for Z+ the set of positive 
integers is a semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.2: Let Q be the field of rationals, Q+ is the semiring. So Q is S-anti 
semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.3: Let R be the field of reals, R+ is a semiring so R is a S-anti semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.4: C be the field of complex numbers. This has subsets Z+, Q+ and R+ to 
be semirings. Hence C is a S-anti semiring. 
 
All these are examples of commutative rings of infinite order, that is of characteristic 
0. Now we proceed on to study non-commutative rings with characteristic 0. 
 
Example 4.6.5: Let M3×3 = {(aij) / aij ∈ Z; the ring of integers} be the set of all 3 × 3 
matrices under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. M3×3 is a non-commutative 
ring of characteristic 0. Clearly, M3×3 is a S-anti-semiring as M3×3 = {(aij) / aij ∈ Zo} is 
a semiring. 
 

 
91 
Example 4.6.6: Let Q[x] be the polynomial ring. The subset P = {Q+[x] / Q+ is the 
positive rationals is a semiring}, So Q[x] is a S-anti semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.7: Let M be any modular lattice having the following Hasse diagram 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S = {1, a, b, f, 0} is a semiring, so can we say M is a S-anti semiring of finite order?  
Note: A modular lattice can never be a ring. 
 
Example 4.6.8: Let P3×3  = {(aij) / aij ∈ M} where M is a lattice having the following 
Hasse diagram: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let H = {0, e, a, 1} is a distributive lattice. Let M3×3  = {(aij) / aij ∈ H}. Can we say 
M3×3 is a S-anti semiring? From these examples we see a distributive lattice is a 
semiring and the class of distributive lattices is contained in the class modular lattices 
are never rings. So the concept of S-anti semirings using distributive lattices cannot be 
defined. Here M3×3 is a non-commutative algebraic structure. Now we have the

following open problem. Can we say all rings are S-anti semirings? The answer to this 
question is no, for when we take the rings Zn = {0, 1, 2, … , n-1}, n any positive 
integer we see Zn has no subset which is a semiring. So Zn for no n is a S anti 
semiring.

, Q+G is a semiring. So QG is 
a S-anti semiring. 
 
THEOREM 4.6.1: Let F be a field of characteristic zero and G any group, the group 
ring FG is a S-anti semiring. 
 
Proof: Since F is a field of characteristic zero so Q ⊂ F or Q = F. In both cases we 
have Q+ is a semiring. Thus Q+G is also semiring. Hence FG is a S-anti semiring. 
 
Example 4.6.10: ZnG be the group ring of the group G over the ring Zn. Is the group 
ring ZnG a S-anti semiring? Left for the reader to prove.

CHAPTER FIVE 
SMARANDACHE SEMIFIELDS 
 
In this chapter we introduce the concept of Smarandache semifields (S-semifield) and 
obtain some interesting results about them. Semifields can be of characteristic 0 or 
have no characteristic associated with them. We define S-substructure in S-semifields. 
We also define in this chapter S-semifields of Level II and finally introduce the 
concept of S-anti semifields.  
 
5. 1 Definition and examples of Smarandache semifields  
 
This section is devoted to the definition of Smarandache semifields and 
contains illustrative examples.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.1: Let S be a semifield. S is said to be a Smarandache semifield (S-
semifield) if a proper subset of S is a k-semi algebra, with respect to the same induced 
operations and an external operator.  
 
Example 5.1.1: Let Zo be a semifield. Zo is a S-semifield for A = {0, p, 2p, ..} is a 
proper subset of Zo which is a k-semi algebra.  
 
Example 5.1.2: Let Zo[x] be a semifield. Zo[x] is a S-semifield as pZo[x] is a proper 
subset which is a k-semi algebra.  
 
It is important to note that all semifields need not be S-semifields.  
 
Example 5.1.3: Let Qo be the semifield, Qo is not a S-semifield.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.1. Let S be the semifield. Every semifield need not be a S-semifield.  
 
Proof: It is true by the above example, as Qo is a semifield which is not a S-semifield.  
 
All the while we have introduced only S-semifield of characteristic zero. Now we will 
proceed onto define S-semifields which has no characteristic associated with it.  
 
Example 5.1.4: Let Cn be a chain lattice. Cn is a semifield. Any set of the form {0, a1, 
…, ar} such that a1 < a2 < … < ar and ar ≠ 1 is a k-semi algebra so Cn is a semifield.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.2: All chain lattices  Cn are S-semifields. 
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact Cn forms a semiring and has no zero divisors and has k-
semi algebras in them. 
 
The next natural question would be: Are all distributive lattices S-semifields? 
 
In view of this we have an example.  
 
Example 5.1.5: Let L be the lattice given by the following Hasse diagram. 
 

 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This lattice is distributive but not a semifield.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.3: All distributive lattices in general are not S-semifields.  
 
Proof: In view of the example 5.1.4. we see in general all distributive lattices are not 
S-semifields.  
 
All distributive lattices are not S-semifields is untrue for we can have distributive 
lattices that are not chain lattices can be S-semifields.  
 
Example 5.1.6: The following lattice with the Hasse diagram is a S-semifield.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hence the claim.

5.2 S-weak semifields 
 
In this section we define a generalized concept of S-semifields viz. S-weak semifield 
and illustrate them with examples.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.1: Let S be a semiring. S is said to be a Smarandache weak semifield 
(S-weak semifield) if S contains a proper subset P which is a semifield and P is a 
Smarandache semifield.  
 
Thus we see the following example is a S-weak semifield.  
 
Example 5.2.1: Let S be a semiring given by the following Hasse diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clearly S is not a semifield as a • b = 0 (a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0). S is only a semiring. Take P = 
{1, e, d, c, a, 0}. P is a semifield and P is in fact a S-semifield as T = {0, a, c, d, e} is a 
k-algebra over S. S is a S-weak semifield.  
Thus we can say the following:  
 
THEOREM 5.2.1: Let S be a S-semifield. Then S is a S-weak semifield. But in general a 
S-weak semifield cannot be a S-semifield.

98 
Proof: Clearly by the very definitions of S-semifield and S-weak semifield we see 
every S-semifield is a S-weak semifield. But a S-weak semifield is not a S-semifield 
for if we take S to be just a semiring with zero divisor or a semiring which is non-
commutative we see S cannot be a S-semifield. Example 5.2.1 is a S-weak semifield 
which is not a S-semifield. Thus we see we can also define S-weak semifield using 
non-commutative semirings.  
 
Example 5.2.2: Let S = Zo × Zo × Zo be a semiring. S is a S-weak semifield. It is left 
for the reader to verify.  
 
Example 5.2.3: Let M2×2 = {(aij)/ aij ∈ Zo}, M2×2 is a semiring which is not a 
semifield. Take P =

5.4 Smarandache semifields of Level II 
 
We have defined S-semifields in the earlier chapters and they will be called as S-
semifield of level I and we proceed on to define the concept of Smarandache 
semifields of level II. We will make use of the Smarandache mixed direct product 
defined in Chapter 4 to define S-semifields of level II.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.1: Let S = Cn × Zp be the S-mixed direct product of the field Zp and 
the semifield Cn. Clearly S = Cn × Zp contains subfields and subsemifields.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.2: Let S be a semifield. S is said to be a Smarandache semifield of 
level II (S-semifield II) if S contains a proper subset which is a field.  
 
Just as in the case of Smarandache semirings of level I and level II we have in the 
case of S-semifields of level I is different and disjoint from that of the S-semifield of 
level II. For this has motivated us to define in the next chapter the concept of 
Smarandache semivector spaces.  
 
Example 5.4.1: Let S = C7 × Z5. S is a S-semifield of level II.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.1: If S is a finite S-semifield of level II then S is a S-finite c-simple 
semiring.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of S to be a S-semifield of level II, S has a proper subset 
which is a field, since S is finite so is the field contained in it. Hence is view of Chris 
Monico, S is a S-c-simple semiring.  
 
Example 5.4.2: Let S = Zo[x] × Q, S is a S-semifield of level II.  
 
In case of fields we cannot define idempotents but in case of S-semifields we can have 
non-trivial idempotents also. 
 

 
100 
Example 5.4.3: Let S = C5 × Q. S is S-semifield of level II. C5 has the following 
Hasse diagram. All elements of the form (a1, 1), (a2, 1), (a3, 1), (a1, 0), (a2, 0) and (a3, 
0) are some of the idempotents in S. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One more interesting property about S-semifields of order II is that S-semifields can 
have ideals.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.3: Let S be a semifield. A proper subset P of S is said to be 
Smarandache- subsemifield  of level I (S-subsemifield I) of S if P is a S-semifield of 
level I.  
 
In view of this we have the following theorem:  
 
THEOREM 5.4.2: Let S be a semifield. If S has a S-subsemifield of level I then S is a S-
semifield of level I.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of S-subsemifields of level I, so S is a S-
semifield of level I.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.4: Let S be a semifield. A proper subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache subsemifield of level II if P is a S-semifield of level II. 
 
In view of this we have the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.3: Let S be a semifield if S has subset P which is a S-subsemifield of 
level II then S is a S-semifield of level II.  
 
Proof: If S has a S-subsemifield of level II then S is a S-semifield of level II.  
 
Example 5.4.4: Let S = Zo × R is a S-semifield of level II of characteristic 0.  
 
Example 5.4.5: Let S = L × R where L is a finite distributive lattice and R a field of 
characteristic 0 is a S-semifield of level II and this semiring has no characteristic 
associated with it.  
 
5.5 Smarandache Anti-semifield

DEFINITION 5.5.1: Let S be a field or a ring. S is said to be a Smarandache anti 
semifield (S-anti semifield) is S has a proper subset A which is a semifield.  
 
Example 5.5.1: Q is field. A = Qo ⊂ Q is a semifield so Q is a S-anti semifield.  
 
Example 5.5.2: Let Z be the ring of integers. Z is a S-anti semifield for Zo ⊂ Z is a 
semifield.  
 
Example 5.5.3: M3×3 = {(aij)/ aij ∈ Q} be the ring of n × n matrices. M3×3 is a S-anti 
semifield. For S =

 is a semifield. So M3×3 is a S-anti 
semifield.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.2: Let S be a ring or a field. A proper subset P in S is said to be a 
Smarandache anti-subsemifield (S-anti subsemifields) of S if P is itself a S-anti 
semifield.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.1: If a ring or a field S has a S-anti subsemifield then S is a S-anti 
semifield.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of S-anti semifields and S-anti subsemifields.  
 
Example 5.5.4: Let Z7 be a field. Z7 is not a S-anti semifield. 
 
In view of this we get the following.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.2: All fields/rings are not in general S-anti semifields.  
 
Proof: By an example. Consider the collections of prime fields of characteristic p. p a 
prime. None of them are S-anti semifields.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.3: All fields of characteristic zero are S-anti semifields.  
 
Proof: Since F is a field of characteristic 0, we see Q the prime field of characteristic 
zero is either contained in F or F = Q. In both the cases we see F is a S-anti semifield 
as Zo ⊂ F or Qo ⊂ F are semifields; so F is a S-anti semifield.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.4: All rings S, commutative or non-commutative with unit 1 and 
characteristic 0 is a S-anti semifield.  
 
Proof: Since 1 ∈ S we see Z ⊂ S, as S is a ring of characteristic 0. Now Z ⊂ S so Zo ⊂ 
Z, is a semifield hence S is a S-anti semifield.  
 
Example 5.5.5: Let F[x] be the polynomial ring. F is a ring or field of characteristic 0. 
Clearly F[x] is a S-anti semifield as Zo ⊂ F[x], is a semifield of P[x]. 
 

 
102 
We now proceed on to define S-anti ideals in S-anti semifields.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.3: Let S be a field/ ring which is a S-anti semifield. If we can find a 
subset P in the subsemifield T in S such that  
 
1. P is a semiring. 
2. for all p ∈ P and t ∈ T, pt ∈ P. 
 
Then P is called the Smarandache anti ideal (S-anti ideal) of the S-anti semifield. 
Note we cannot have the concept of right or left ideal as the subsemifield is 
commutative. 
 
Example 5.5.6: Let Q be the field. Q is a S-anti semifield. Clearly pZo = {0, p, 2p, …} 
is a S-anti ideal of Q.  
 
Example 5.5.7: Let Q[x] be the polynomial ring. Q[x] is a S-anti semifield and 
(pZo)[x] is a S-anti ideal of Q[x].  
 
Thus we see even fields can have S-anti ideals in them  
 
PROBLEMS:

2. Is Qo[x] a S-anti semifield? Justify your answer?

CHAPTER SIX 
SMARANDACHE SEMIVECTOR SPACES  
AND ITS PROPERTIES 
 
In this chapter we introduce the concept of Smarandache semivector spaces and study 
some of its properties. We know every Smarandache semigroup (S-semigroup) is a 
semigroup but every semigroup in general is not a S-semigroup. Now we make use of 
Smarandache semigroup to construct Smarandache semivector spaces. Throughout 
this paper we assume all semigroups, which we construct, are going to be only 
semigroups under addition. 
 
6.1 Definition of Smarandache semivector spaces with 
examples 
 
Here we introduce the concept of Smarandache semivector spaces and show all 
Smarandache semivector spaces are semivector spaces but not conversely. 
 
Example 6.1.1: Let S = Z × Zo = {(a, b) / a ∈ Z and b ∈ Zo}. Clearly S = Z × Zo is a 
semigroup under component wise addition. In fact this semigroup is a Smarandache 
semigroup. 
 
Example 6.1.2: S = Zo × Zo is not a S-semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.1: Let G be a semigroup under the operation +, S any semifield. Let 
G be a semivector space over S. G is said to be a Smarandache semivector space (S-
semivector space) over S if G is a Smarandache semigroup (S-semigroup).  
 
Example 6.1.3: Let S = Q × Zo be a semigroup under component wise addition. S is a 
semivector space over Zo the semifield. Now we see S is a S-semivector space over 
Zo. It is important to note S = Q × Zo is not a semivector space over the semifield Qo. 
 
Example 6.1.4: Let Qo × Qo × Qo = S be a semigroup under component wise addition. 
Clearly S is a semivector space over Qo but S is not a S-semivector space as S = Qo × 
Qo × Qo is not a S-semigroup.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.1: All S-semivector spaces over a semifield S are semivector spaces but 
all semivector spaces need not be S-semivector spaces. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-semivector spaces we see all S-semivector spaces 
are semivector spaces. We note that all semivector spaces need not in general be S-
semivector spaces as seen from example 6.1.4. 
 
Example 6.1.5: Let S = Ro × Qo × Z be a S-semigroup. Clearly S is a S-semivector 
space over Zo. 
 
Note: S = Ro × Qo × Z is not even a semivector space over Qo or Ro. 
 

 
104 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. Give some semivector over Zo. 
2. Is S = Zo × Zo × Qo × Qo a S-semivector space over Zo? 
3. Can S = Zo × Qo × R be a S- semivector space over Ro? Justify your answer. 
4. Prove S = Zo × Qo × R is a S-semivector over Zo. 
5. Why is S = Zo × Qo × R a S-semivector over Zo? 
 
 
6.2 S- subsemivector spaces  
 
Here we define the concept of Smarandache subsemivector spaces and give some 
examples. Further we define the notion of linear combination and Smarandache 
linearly independent vectors in the case of S-semivector spaces.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.1: Let V be a Smarandache semigroup which is a S-semivector space 
over a semifield S. A proper subset W of V is said to be Smarandache subsemivector 
space (S-subsemivector space) of V if W is a Smarandache subsemigroup or W itself 
is a S-semigroup. 
 
Example 6.2.1: Let V = Qo × Zo × Z, V is a S-semivector space over Zo. W = Qo × Zo 
× 2Z is a S-subsemivector space of V. In fact W1 = Qo × {0} × Z ⊆ V is also a S-
subsemivector space of V. But W2 = Qo × Zo × Zo ⊂ V is not a S- subsemivector space 
of V over Zo. But W2 is a subsemivector space of V over Zo. 
 
THEOREM 6.2.1: Let V be a S semivector space over the semifield F. Every S-
subsemivector space over S is a subsemivector space over S. But all subsemivector 
spaces of a S- semivector space need not be S-subsemivector space over S. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-subsemivector spaces W ⊂ V we see W is a 
subsemivector space of V. But every subsemivector space W of V in general is not a 
S-subsemivector space as is evidenced from example 6.2.1 the subsemivector space 
W2 = Qo × Zo × Zo ⊂ V is not a S-subsemivector space of V. Hence the claim. 
 
Example 6.2.2: Consider V = Z × Zo, V is a S-semigroup. V is a S-semivector space 
over Zo. We see the set {(-1, 1), (1, 1)} will not span V completely {(-1, 0) (1, 0), (0, 
1)} will span V. It is left for the reader to find out sets, which can span V completely. 
Can we find a smaller set, which can span V than the set, {(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)}?  
 
Let V be any S-semivector space over the semifield S. Suppose v1, … , vn be n set of 
elements in V then we say 
∑
=
α
=
α
n
1
i
i
iv  in V to be a linear combination of the vi's. We 
see when V is just a semivector space given in chapter III we could find semivector 
spaces using finite lattices but when we have made the definition of S-semivector 
spaces we see the class of those semivector spaces built using lattices can never be S-
semivector spaces as we cannot make even semilattices into S-semigroups as x . x = x 
for all x in a semilattice. So we are left only with those semivector spaces built using 
Qo, Zo and Ro as semifields. 
 

 
105 
Example 6.2.3: Let V = Q × Zo be a semivector space over Zo. Clearly V is a S 
semivector space. In fact V has to be spanned only by a set which has infinitely many 
elements. 
 
Example 6.2.4: Let V = Q × Zo × R be a S-semigroup. We know V cannot be a S-
semivector space over Qo or Ro. V can only be a S-semivector space over Zo. We see 
the set, which can span V, is bigger than the one given in example 6.2.3. 
 
Example 6.2.5: Let V = Z × Zo be a S-semigroup. V is a S-semivector space over Zo. 
Clearly {(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} = β spans V. Our main concern is that will β be the 
only set that spans V or can V have any other set which span it. Most of these 
questions remain open. 
 
Example 6.2.6: Let V = Zo[x] × Z be a S-semigroup. V is a S-semivector space over 
Zo. The set, which can span V, has infinite cardinality.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.2: Let V be a S-semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. Let P = {v1 , …, vn} be a finite set which spans V and the vi in the set P 
are such that no vi 's in P can be expressed as the linear combination of the other 
elements in P \ {vi}. In this case we say P is a linearly independent set, which span V. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.3: Let V be a S-semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. If only one finite set P spans V and no other set can span V and if the 
elements of that set is linearly independent, that is no one of them can be expressed in 
terms of others then we say V is a finite dimensional S-semivector space and the 
cardinality of P is the dimension of V.  
 
We see in the case of S-semivector spaces V the number of elements which spans V 
are always larger than the number of elements which spans the semivector spaces, 
which are not S-semivector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.4: Let V be a semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. A Smarandache basis for V (S-basis for V) is a set of linearly independent 
elements, which span a S-subsemivector space P of V, that is P, is a S-subsemivector 
space of V, so P is also a S-semigroup. Thus for any semivector space V we can have 
several S-basis for V.  
 
Example 6.2.7: Let V = Zo × Z be a S-semivector space over Z. Let P = {0} × {pZ} 
be a S-subsemivector space of V. Now the S-basis for P is {(0, p), (0, -p)}. We see for 
each prime p we can have S-subsemivector space which have different S-basis.

coincide? 
 
6.3 Smarandache linear transformations 
 
In this section we define Smarandache linear transformation of S-semivector spaces 
and study them. Here we consider only S-semivector spaces over semifields.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.1: Let V and W be any two S-semigroups. We assume P ⊂ V and C ⊂ 
W are two proper subsets which are groups in V and W respectively. V and W be S-
semivector spaces over the same semifield F. A map T: V → W is said to be a 
Smarandache linear transformation (S-linear transformation) if T(cp1 + p2) = cTp1 + 
Tp2 for all p1, p2 ∈ P and Tp1, Tp2 ∈ C i.e. T restricted to the subsets which are 
subgroups acts as linear transformation.  
 
Example 6.3.1: Let V = Zo × Q and W = Zo × R be S –semivector spaces over the 
semifield Zo. We have P = {0} × Q and C = {0} × R are subsets of V and W 
respectively which are groups under +. Define T: V → W, a map such that T(0, p) → 
(0, 2p) for every p ∈ P. Clearly T is a S-linear transformation. We see the maps T 
need not even be well defined on the remaining parts of V and W. What we need is T: 
P → C is a linear transformation of vector spaces.  
 
Example 6.3.2: Let V = Qo × R and W = Zo × Z be S-semigroups which are S-
semivector spaces over Zo. T: V → W such that T:{0} × R → {0} × Z defined by T(0, 
r) = (0, 0) if r ∉ Z and T(0, r) = (0, r) if r ∈ Z. It is easily verified T is a S-linear 
transformation.  
 
Example 6.3.3: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo be a semigroup under addition. Clearly V is a 
semivector space over Zo but V is never a S-semivector space.  
 
In view of this we have got a distinct behaviour of S-semivector space. We know if F 
is a field V = F × F × … × F (n times) is a vector space over F. If S is a semifield then 
W = S × S × … S = (n times) is a semivector over S. But for a S- semivector space we 
cannot have this for we see none of the standard semifields defined using Zo, Qo and 

 
107 
Ro are S-semigroups. They are only semigroups under addition and they do not 
contain a proper subset which is a group under addition.  
 
Example 6.3.4: Let V = Zo × Q × Zo be a S-semivector space over Zo. Clearly Zo × Zo 
× Zo = W ⊂ V, W is a semivector space which is not a S-semivector space. We are 
forced to state this theorem.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.1: Let V be a S-semivector space over Qo or Zo or Ro, then we can 
always find a subspace in V which is not a S-semivector space.  
 
Proof: If V is to be a S-semivector space the only possibility is that we should take 
care to see that V is only a semigroup having a subset which is a group i.e. our basic 
assumption is V is not a group but V is a S-semigroup. Keeping this in view, if V is to 
be a S-semivector space over Zo (or Qo or Ro) we can have V = Zo × Zo × Zo × Q × R 
× … × Zo i.e. V has at least once Zo occurring or Qo occurring or Ro occurring and 
equally it is a must that in the product V, either Z or Q or R must occur for V to be a 
S-semigroup. Thus we see if V is a S-semivector space over Zo. Certainly W = Zo × 
… × Zo ⊂ V is a semivector space over Zo and is not a S-semivector space over Zo. 
Hence the claim.  
 
Example 6.3.5: Let V = Zo × Qo × R be a S-semigroup. V is a S-semivector space 
over Zo. Clearly W = Zo × Zo × Zo is a subsemivector space of V which is not a S-
semivector space.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.2: Let V = S1 × … × Sn is a S-semivector spaces over Zo or Ro or Qo 
where Si ∈ {Zo, Z, Qo, Q, Ro, R}.  
 
1. If one of the Si is Z or Zo then V can be a S-semivector space only over Zo. 
 
2. If none of the Si is Z or Zo and one of the Si is Q or Qo, V can be a S-semivector 
space only over Zo or Qo. 
 
3. If none of the Si is Z or Zo or Q or Qo only R or Ro then V can be a S-
semivector space over Zo or Qo or Ro.  
 
Proof: It is left for the reader to verify all the three possibilities.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.3: Let V = S1 × …× Sn where Si ∈ {Zo, Z, Qo, Q, R or Ro} be a S-
semigroup.  
 
1. If V is a S-semivector space over Zo then W = Zo × … × Zo (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V which is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 
2. If V is a S-semivector space over Qo then W = Qo × …×Qo (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V which is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 
3. If V is a S-semivector space over Ro then W = Ro × … × Ro (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V and is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 

 
108 
Proof: Left for the reader to do the proofs as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.4: Let V = S1 × … × Sn where Si ∈ {Zo, Z, Ro, R, Qo, Q} if V is a S-
semivector space over Qo. Then W = Zo × … × Zo ( n times) ⊂ V is only a subset of V 
but never a subspace of V.  
 
Proof: Use the fact V is defined over Qo and not over Zo.  
 
We define a new concept called Smarandache pseudo subsemivector space.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.2: Let V be a vector space over S. Let W be a proper subset of V. If W 
is not a subsemivector space over S but W is a subsemivector space over a proper 
subset P ⊂  S, then we say W is a Smarandache pseudo semivector space (S- pseudo 
semivector space) over P ⊂ S.  
 
Example 6.3.6: Let V = Q × Ro be a S-semivector space over Qo. Clearly W = Zo × Ro 
is not a subsemivector space over Qo but W = Zo × Ro is a S- pseudo semivector space 
over Zo.  
 
Example 6.3.7: Let V = Qo × Ro × Q be a S-semivector space over Qo. Now W = Zo × 
Zo × Zo and W1 = Qo × Qo × Qo and S-pseudo semivector spaces over Zo ⊂ Qo.   
 
Thus only these revolutionary Smarandache notions can pave way for definitions like 
Smarandache pseudo subsemivector spaces certainly which have good relevance.

6.4  S-anti semivector spaces 
 
In this section we define Smarandache anti semivector spaces and obtain some 
interesting results about them.  
 
DEFINITION 6.4.1: Let V be a vector space over the field F. We say V is a 
Smarandache anti semivector space (S-anti semivector space) over F if there exists a 
subspace W ⊂ V such that W is a semivector space over the semifield S ⊂ F. Here W 
is just a semigroup under '+' and S is a semifield in F. 
 
Example 6.4.1: Let R be the field of reals. R is a vector space over Q. Clearly R is a 
S-anti semivector space as Qo ⊂ R is a S-semivector space over Zo.  
 
Example 6.4.2: Let V = Q × R × Q be a vector space over Q. We see W = Qo × Ro × 
Q is a S-semivector space over Qo. W1 = Z × Zo × Zo is not a S-semivector space over 
Qo. But V is a S-anti semivector space over Q as P = Zo × Zo × Zo is a semivector 
space over Zo. 
 
Example 6.4.3: Let V = Q × Q × … × Q (n-times), V is a vector space over Q. Clearly 
V is a S- anti semivector space for Zo × Zo × … × Zo × Z is a S-semivector space over 
Zo.  
 
Many important questions are under study. The first is if V is a vector space over F 
and has a finite basis then it does not in general imply the S-anti semivector space has 
a finite basis. We have several facts in this regard, which are illustrated by the 
following examples. 
 
Example 6.4.4: Let V = Q × Q × Q × Q × Q, (5 times) is a vector space over Q. Now 
W = Z × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo is a S-semivector space over Zo. So V is a S-anti 
semivector space. The basis for V = Q × Q × Q × Q × Q is {(1, 0, 0, 0, 0) (0, 1, 0, 0, 
0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)} as a vector space over Q.  
 
Now what is the basis or the set which spans W = Z × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo over Zo. 
Clearly the set of 5 elements cannot span W. So we see in case of S-anti semivector 
spaces the basis of V cannot generate W. If we take W1 = Qo × Qo × Qo × Qo × Z as a 
S-semivector space over Zo. Clearly W1 cannot be finitely generated by a set. Thus a 
vector space, which has dimension 5, becomes infinite dimensional when it is a S-anti 
semivector space. 
 

 
110 
DEFINITION 6.4.2: Let V and W be any two vector spaces over the field F. Suppose U 
⊂ V and X ⊂ W be two subsets of V and W respectively which are S-semigroups and 
so are S-semivector spaces over S ⊂ F that is V and W are S-anti semivector spaces. 
A map T: V → W is said to be a Smarandache T linear transformation of the S-anti 
semivector spaces if T: U → X is a S-linear transformation. 
 
Example 6.4.5: Let V = Q × Q × Q and W = R × R × R × R be two vector spaces over 
Q. Clearly U = Z × Zo × Zo ⊂ V and X = Q × Z × Zo × Zo ⊂ W are S-semigroups and 
U and X are S-semivector spaces so V and W are S-anti semivector spaces. T: V → 
W be defined by T(x, y, z) = (x, x, z, z) for (x, y, z) ∈ Z × Zo × Zo and (x, x, z, z) ∈ X 
is a Smarandache T linear operator.  
 
Such nice results can be obtained using Smarandache anti semivector spaces.

CHAPTER SEVEN 
RESEARCH PROBLEMS 
 
The main attraction of any textbook for any researcher in the list of open research 
problems proposed by it. In this book we have enlisted 25 open research problems for 
a student/ a researcher. Certainly these problems will throw open many more 
interesting results and this will certainly lead to a lot of researchers studying 
Smarandache notions. Smarandache notions are the only tools to study mathematics in 
unconventional ways and at the same time they can be used to analyse all types of 
relations between any two algebraic structures, this study will emerge as an attractive 
one among researchers. Except for Smarandache notions such rich type of 
mathematical analysis would be completely absent in the realm of mathematics.  
 
1. 
Does there exist a semiring S of characteristic n, where n is a finite positive 
integer? (To show this one has to prove in a semiring S that for every s ∈ S; ns 
=  s + s + …+ s (n times) is zero) 
 
2. 
Find a non-strict semiring S. (Hint: To prove this we have to show in a 
semiring S. a , b ∈ S\{0}, a + b = 0 is possible.) 
 
3. 
Let V be a semivector space over S = Zo where V = Zo × Zo × … × Zo (n 
times). Is it possible to find an upper bound for the number of linearly 
independent vectors in the semivector space V?  
 
4. 
A simplified problem of problem 3 is if V = Zo × Zo is a semivector space over 
Zo. Find an upper bound for the number of linearly independent elements in 
the semivector space V = Zo × Zo over Zo. 
 
5. 
Does there exist a semivector space V of dimension n over a semifield F such 
that every set of (n + 1) vectors is linearly dependent? 
 
6. 
Let V be a semivector space over a semifield S. Let us assume V is not 
endowed with a unique basis. Let the number of elements in a basis be n (n > 
1). Suppose V has another basis, then is it true in general that the number of 
elements in these two basis will be the same?  
 
7. 
Characterize those semivector spaces which do not have a unique basis.  
 
8.

Characterize those semirings in which all S-pseudo ideals are S-pseudo dual 
ideals.  
 
10. 
Does there exist semirings in which all the four concepts i) S-ideals, ii) S-dual 
ideals, iii) S-pseudo ideals, iv) S-pseudo dual ideals coincide on every S-
subsemiring?  
 
11. 
Prove if S = Zo × Zo × … × Zn (n times) is a semiring. Then every zero divisor 
is a S-zero divisor.  

 
112 
 
12. 
Can we prove in any semiring every zero divisor is a S-zero divisor? 
 
13. 
Let S = Zo × Zo × …  × Zo (n times) be a semiring. S has idempotents but S has 
no S-idempotents. Is this true in case of all semifields of characteristic 0 (Zo, 
Ro and Qo)?  
 
14. 
Characterize those non-commutative semirings in which every S-subsemiring 
is a S-semidivision ring. (At least give an example of a non-commutative 
semiring in which every S-subsemiring is a S-semidivision ring).  
 
15. 
Can one prove in any semiring the condition S-dcc and S-mc are equivalent? 
(Study this in case of i) Group semirings, ii) semigroup semirings, iii) S-group 
semirings, iv) S-semigroup semirings.) 
 
16. 
Develop using the concept of Smarandache e-semiring 
 
a. Smarandache classical CSP (S-classical CSP) 
b. Smarandache fuzzy CSP (S-fuzzy CSP) 
c. Smarandache probabilistic CSP (S-probabilistic CSP) 
d. Smarandache weighted CSP (S-weighted CSP) 
 
17. 
Can group semirings FG where F is a semiring of characteristic 0 (i.e. Zo or Qo 
or Ro) and G is a finite group be a S-chain semiring? 
 
18. 
Find an example of a finite Smarandache semigroup semiring. (Hint: This is 
equivalent to finding a finite Smarandache anti-group. That is does there exist 
a finite group which is a Smarandache anti-group)

space as well as a S-anti semivector space have same dimension. 
 
24. 
Can we have S-semivector space V having the same number of basis as the 
semivector space V? 
 
25.

Definition: 
Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak 
structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded 
with a stronger structure S. 
By proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty 
set, from the unit element if any, and from A. 
 
These types of structures occur in our every day’s life, that’s why we study them 
in this book. 
 
Thus, as three particular cases: 
 
1) A Smarandache Semiring (or S-semiring) is a semiring A such that a proper 
subset B of A is a semifield (with respect to the same induced operation).  
 
2) A Smarandache Semifield (or S-semifield) is a semifield A such that a proper 
subset B of A is a k-semi algebra, with respect to the same induced operations 
and an external operator. 
 
3) A Smarandache Semivector Space (or S-semivector space) is a semivector space 
A (over a semifield B) which is a Smarandache semigroup (or S-semigroup).
