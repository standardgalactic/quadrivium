Preface to ﬁrst edition
In this preface, I want to communicate three things. First, I would like to share with
the reader my motivation for taking on this project. Second, I want to try to identify
my intended audience and, third, I want to record some special acknowledgements to
colleagues who have helped me.
When I decided to pursue a career as an aeronautical engineer, my motivation
stemmed from an aesthetic delight in ﬂight and things that ﬂew, combined with an
uncanny interest in tackling, and sometimes solving, difﬁcult technical problems. Both
held a mystery for me and together, unbeknown to me at the time, helped me to
‘escape’ the Welsh mining community in which I had been sculptured, on to the roads
of learning and earning. Long before that, in the late 1940s, when I was taking my
ﬁrst gasps of Welsh air, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) had been conducting
the ﬁrst research ﬂight trials to understand helicopter stability and control. It should
be remembered that at that time, practical helicopters had been around for less than
a decade. From reading the technical reports and talking with engineers who worked
in those days, I have an image of an exciting and productive era, with test and theory
continuously wrestling to provide ﬁrst-time answers to the many puzzles of helicopter
ﬂight dynamics.
Although there have been quiet periods since then, the RAE sustained its heli-
copter research programme through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and by the time I
took charge of the activities at Bedford in the mid-1980s, it had established itself at
the leading edge of research into rotor aerodynamics and helicopter ﬂight dynamics.
My own helicopter journey began in the Research Department at Westland Helicopters
in the early 1970s. At that time, Westland were engaged with the ﬂight testing of the
prototype Lynx, a helicopter full of innovation for a 1960s design. This was also an
exciting era, when the foundations of my understanding of helicopter ﬂight dynamics
were laid down. Working with a small and enthusiastic group of research engineers,
the mysteries began to unfold, but at times it felt as if the more I learned, the less I
understood. I do not want to use the word enthusiastic lightly in this context; a great
number of helicopter engineers that I have known have a degree of enthusiasm that
goes way beyond the call of duty, so to speak, and I do believe that this is a spe-
cial characteristic of people in this relatively small community. While it is inevitable
that our endeavours are fuelled by the needs of others – the ubiquitous customer, for
example – enthusiasm for the helicopter and all of the attendant technologies is a
powerful and dynamic force. In writing this book I have tried to share some of my
enthusiasm and knowledge of helicopter ﬂight dynamics with as large an audience
as possible, and that was probably sufﬁcient personal motivation to undertake the
task. This motivation is augmented by a feeling that my own experience in theory
and test has given me insight into, and a somewhat unique way of looking at, the

 
xiv
Preface to ﬁrst edition
subject of ﬂight dynamics that I hope will appeal to the reader in search of under-
standing.
There are, however, more pragmatic reasons for writing this book. While ﬁxed-
wing ﬂight dynamics, stability and control have been covered from a number of per-
spectives in more than a dozen treatise over the years, there has never been a helicopter
textbook dedicated to the subject; so there is, at least, a perceived gap in the available
literature, and, perhaps more importantly, the time is ripe to ﬁll that gap. The last 10–20
years has seen a signiﬁcant amount of research in ﬂight simulation and ﬂying qualities
for helicopters, much of which has appeared in the open literature but is scattered in
scores of individual references. This book attempts to capture the essence of this work
from the author’s perspective, as a practitioner involved in the DRA (RAE) research
in national and international programmes. It has been a busy and productive period,
indeed it is still continuing, and I hope that this book conveys the impression of a living
and mature subject, to which many contributions are yet to be made.
The book is written mainly for practising ﬂight dynamics engineers. In some
organizations, such a person may be described as a ﬂying qualities engineer, a ﬂight
simulation engineer or even a ﬂight controls engineer, but my personal view is that these
titlesreﬂectsubdisciplineswithinthelargerﬁeldofﬂightdynamics.Keyactivitiesofthe
ﬂight dynamics engineer are simulation modelling, ﬂying qualities and ﬂight control.
Simulation brings the engineer into a special and intimate relationship with the system
he or she is modelling and the helicopter is a classic example. The present era appears to
be characterized by fast-disappearing computational constraints on our ability to model
and simulate the complex aeroelastic interactions involved in helicopter ﬂight. Keeping
step with these advances, the ﬂight dynamics engineer must, at the same time, preserve
an understanding of the link between cause and effect. After all, the very objectives of
modelling and simulation are to gain an understanding of the effects of various design
features and insight into the sensitivity of ﬂight behaviour to changes in conﬁguration
and ﬂight condition. In the modelling task, the ﬂight dynamics engineer will need to
address all the underlying assumptions, and test them against experimental data, in a
way that provides as complete a calibration as possible. The ﬂight dynamics engineer
will also have a good understanding of ﬂying qualities and the piloting task, and he
or she will appreciate the importance of the external and internal inﬂuences on these
qualities and the need for mission-oriented criteria. Good ﬂying qualities underpin
safe ﬂight, and this book attempts to make the essence of the theoretical developments
and test database, assembled over the period from the early 1980s through to the
present time, accessible to practising engineers. Flight testing is an important part of
ﬂight dynamics, supporting both simulation validation and the development of ﬂying
qualities criteria. In this book I have attempted to provide the tools for building and
analysing simulation models of helicopter ﬂight, and to present an up-to-date treatment
of ﬂying qualities criteria and ﬂight test techniques.
While this is primarily a specialist’s book, it is also written for those with empathy
for the broader vision, within which ﬂight dynamics plays its part. It is hoped that the
book, or parts of the book, will appeal to test pilots and ﬂight test engineers and
offer something useful to engineers without aeronautical backgrounds, or those who
have specialized in the aerodynamic or controls disciplines and wish to gain a broader
perspective of the functionality of the total aircraft. In writing Chapters 2, 6 and 7, I
have tried to avoid a dependence on ‘difﬁcult’ mathematics. Chapters 3, 4 and 5, on
the other hand, require a reasonable grasp of analytical and vectorial mechanics as

would, for example, be taught in the more extensive engineering courses at ﬁrst and
higher degree levels. With regard to education programmes, I have had in mind that
different parts of the book could well form the subject of one or two term courses at
graduate or even advanced undergraduate level. I would strongly recommend Chapter 2
to all who have embarked on a learning programme with this book. Taught well, I have
always believed that ﬂight dynamics is inspirational and, hence, a motivating subject
at university level, dealing with whole aircraft and the way they ﬂy, and, at the same
time, the integration of the parts that make the whole. I have personally gained much
from the subject and perhaps this book also serves as an attempt to return my own
personal understandings into the well of knowledge.
In the sense that this book is an offering, it also reﬂects the great deal of gratitude
I feel towards many colleagues over the years, who have helped to make the business
enjoyable, challenging and stimulating for me. I have been fortunate to be part of several
endeavours, both nationally and internationally, that have achieved signiﬁcant progress,
compared with the sometimes more limited progress possible by individuals working
on their own. International collaboration has always held a special interest for me and I
am grateful to AGARD, Garteur, TTCP and other, less formal, ties with European and
North American agencies, for providing the auspices for collaboration. Once again,
this book is full of the fruits of these activities. I genuinely believe that helicopters of
the future will perform better, be safer and be easier to ﬂy because of the efforts of the
various research groups working together in the ﬁeld of ﬂight dynamics, feeding the
results into the acquisition processes in the form of the requirements speciﬁcations,
and into the manufacturing process, through improved tools and technologies.
In the preparation of this book several colleagues have given me speciﬁc support
which I would like to acknowledge. For assistance in the generation and presentation of
key results I would like to acknowledge the Rotorcraft Group at DRA Bedford. But my
gratitude to the Bedford team goes far beyond the speciﬁc support activities, and I resist
identifying individual contributions for that reason. As a team we have pushed forward
in many directions over the last 10 years, sometimes at the exciting but lonely leading
edge, at other times ﬁlling in the gaps left by others pushing forward with greater pace
and urgency. I want to record that this book very much reﬂects these team efforts, as
indicated by the many cited references. I was anxious to have the book reviewed in a
critical light before signing it off for publication, and my thanks go to colleagues and
friends Ronald Milne, Ronald DuVal, Alan Simpson, Ian Simons and David Key for
being kind enough to read individual chapters and for providing me with important
critical reviews. A special thanks to Roy Bradley for reviewing the book in its entirety
and for offering many valuable ideas which have been implemented to make the book
better.
I ﬁrst had the serious idea of writing this book about 4 years ago. I was familiar
with the Blackwell Science series and I liked their productions, so I approached them
ﬁrst. From the beginning, my publisher at Blackwell’s, Julia Burden, was helpful and
encouraging. Later, during the preparation, the support from Julia and her team was
sustained and all negotiations have been both positive and constructive; I would like to
express my gratitude for this important contribution. I would like also to acknowledge
the vital support of my employer, the Defence Research Agency, for allowing me to
use material from my research activities at RAE and DRA over the past 18 years. My
particular thanks to my boss, Peter England, Manager, Flight Dynamics and Simulation
Department at DRA Bedford, who has been continually supportive with a positive

attitude that has freed me from any feelings of conﬂict of interest. Acknowledgements
for DRA material used and ﬁgures or quotes from other sources are included elsewhere
in this book. The ﬁgures in this book were produced by two artists, those in Chapter 2
by Peter Wells and the rest by Mark Straker. Both worked from often very rough drafts
and have, I believe, done an excellent job – thank you both.
All these people have helped me along the road in a variety of different ways,
as I have tried to indicate, but I am fully accountable for what is written in this book.
I am responsible for the variations in style and ‘colour’, inevitable and perhaps even
desirable in a book of this scope and size. There have been moments when I have been
guided by some kind of inspiration and others where I have had to be more concerned
with making sure the mathematics was correct. I have done my best in this second
area and apologise in advance for the inevitable errors that will have crept in. My ﬁnal
thanks go to you, the reader, for at least starting the journey through this work. I hope
that you enjoy the learning and I wish you good fortune with the application of your
own ideas, some of which may germinate as a result of reading this book. It might help
to know that this book will continue to be my guide to ﬂight dynamics and I will be
looking for ways in which the presentation can be improved.

Preface to second edition
In the preface to the ﬁrst edition of my book I talked about ﬂight dynamics as a ‘living
and mature subject, to which many contributions are yet to be made’; I believe this
statement is still true and every new generation of engineers has something new to add
to the store of knowledge. During the 10 years since its publication, the disciplines of
ﬂight dynamics and handling/ﬂying qualities engineering have matured into a systems
approach to the design and development of those functions and technologies required
to support the piloting task. At the same time, as pilot-centred operational attributes,
ﬂying qualities are recognised as the product of a continual tension between perfor-
mance and safety. These two descriptions and the interplay between them highlight
the importance of the subject to continuing helicopter development. The most obvious
contributors to ﬂying qualities are the air vehicle dynamics – the stability and control
characteristics – and these aspects were treated in some depth in the ﬁrst edition. Fly-
ing qualities are much more, however, and this has also been emphasized. They are a
product of the four elements: the aircraft, the pilot, the task and the environment, and it
is this broader, holistic view of the subject which is both a technical discipline and an
operational attribute, which emphasizes the importance to ﬂight safety and operational
effectiveness. I have tried to draw out this emphasis in the new material presented in
Chapter 8, Degraded Flying Qualities, which constitutes the bulk of the new content
in this second edition.
During the preparation of the ﬁrst edition, ADS-33C was being used extensively
in a range of military aircraft programmes. The handling qualities (HQs) criteria repre-
sented key performance drivers for the RAH-66 Comanche, and although this aircraft
programme would eventually be cancelled, Industry and the surrounding helicopter
‘community’ would learn about the technology required to deliver Level 1 HQs across
a range of operational requirements. The last decade has seen ADS-33 applied to
aircraft such as NH-90 and the UK’s attack helicopter, and also to new operations
including maritime rotorcraft and helicopters carrying external loads, and used as a
design guide for civil tilt rotor aircraft. It is now common at annual European and
American Helicopter Fora to hear presentations on new applications of ADS-33 or ex-
tensions to its theoretical basis. The Standard has also been reﬁned over this period and
currently exists in the ADS-33E-PRF (performance) version, emphasizing its status as
a performance requirement. A brief resume of developments is added to Chapter 6.
Signiﬁcant advances have also been made on the modelling and simulation front,
and it is very satisfying to see the considerable pace at which the modelling of complex
helicopter aerodynamics is moving. It surely will not be very long before the results of
accurate physical ﬂow modelling will be fully embodied into efﬁcient, whole aircraft
design codes and real-time simulation. A combination of high-quality computer tools
for comprehensive synthesis and analysis and robust design criteria pave the way for

Preface to second edition
massive reductions in timescales and costs for design, development and certiﬁcation.
The modelling and simulation material in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 is largely unchanged in
this second edition. This is simply a result of the author needing to put limits on what
is achievable within the timescale available.
In August 1999, I left government ‘service’ to join The University of Liverpool
with a mandate to lead the aerospace activity, both on the research and the learning
and teaching (L&T) axes. I was conﬁdent that my 30 years of experience would enable
me to transition fairly naturally into academia on the research axis. I had very little
experience on the L&T side however, but have developed undergraduate modules in
rotorcraft ﬂight, aircraft performance and ﬂight handling qualities. I conﬁrm the old
adage – to learn something properly, you need to teach it – and it has been very satisfying
to ‘plough’ some of my experience back into the formative ‘soil’ of future careers.
As with the ﬁrst edition, while this work is a consolidation of my knowledge and
understanding, much has been drawn from the efforts and results of others, and not
only is acknowledging this fact appropriate but it also feels satisfying to record these
thanks, particularly to the very special and highly motivated group of individuals in
the Flight Science and Technology Research Group at the University of Liverpool.
This group has formed and grown organically, as any university research group might,
over the period since 2000 and, hopefully, will continue to develop capabilities and
contribute to the universal pool of knowledge and understanding. Those, in academe,
who have had the pleasure and privilege to ‘lead’ a group of young post-graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers will perhaps understand the sense in which I
derive satisfaction from witnessing the development of independent researchers, and
adding my mite to the process. Thanks to Ben Lawrence and Binoy Manimala who have
become experts in FLIGHTLAB and other computational ﬂight dynamics analyses
and helped me in numerous ways, but particularly related to investigating the effects
of trailing wake vortices on helicopters. Neil Cameron derived the results presented
in Chapter 8 on the effects of control system failures on the handing qualities of tilt
rotor aircraft. Gary Clark worked closely with me to produce the results in Chapter
8, relating to terrain following ﬂight in degraded visibility. Immeasurable gratitude to
Mark White, the simulation laboratory manager in FS&T, who has worked with me on
most of the research projects initiated over the last 5 years. The support of Advanced
Rotorcraft Technology, particularly Ronald Du Val and Chengian Ho, with various
FLIGHTLAB issues and the development of the HELIFLIGHT simulator has been
huge and is gratefully acknowledged.
Those involved in ﬂight dynamics and handling qualities research will understand
the signiﬁcant contribution that test pilots make to the subject, and at Liverpool we have
been very fortunate indeed to have the sustained and consistently excellent support
from a number of ex-military test pilots, and this is the place to acknowledge their
contribution to my developing knowledge captured in this book. Sincere thanks to
Andy Berryman, Nigel Talbot, Martin Mayer and Steve Cheyne; they should hopefully
know how important I consider their contributions to be.
Thanks to Roger Hoh and colleagues at Hoh Aeronautics, whose continuous
commitment to handling qualities excellence has been inspirational to me. Roger has
also made contributions to the research activities in FS&T particularly related to the
development of handling criteria in degraded conditions and the attendant design of
displays for ﬂight in degraded visual environments. The whole subject of visual per-
ception in ﬂight control has been illuminated to me through close collaboration with
David Lee, Professor of Perception in Action at The University of Edinburgh. David’s

contributions to my understanding of the role of optical ﬂow and optical tau in the
control of motion has been signiﬁcant and is gratefully acknowledged.
Over the last 10 years I have received paper and electronic communications from
colleaguesandreadersoftheﬁrsteditionworldwidewhohavebeencomplementaryand
have politely identiﬁed various errors or misprints, which have been corrected. These
communications have been rather too numerous to identify and mention individually
here but it is hoped that a collective thanks will be appreciated.
Mark Straker produced the ﬁgures in the form they appear in this book to his
usual very high standard; thanks again Mark for your creative support.
Finally, grateful thanks to Julia Burden at Blackwell Publishing who has been
unrelenting in her encouragement, dare I say persistence, with me to produce material
for this second edition. Any Head of a fairly large academic department (at Liverpool
I am currently Head of Engineering with 900 students and 250 staff) will know what
a challenging and rather absorbing business it can be, especially when one takes it on
to direct and increase the pace of change. So, I was reluctant to commit to this second
edition until I felt that I had sufﬁcient new research completed to ‘justify’ a new edition;
the reader will now ﬁnd a consolidation of much of that new work in the new Chap-
ter 8. Only the authors who have worked under the pressures of a tight schedule, whilst
at the same time having a busy day job, will know how and where I found the time.
So this book is offered to both a new and old readership, who might also ﬁnd
some light-hearted relief in a ‘refreshed’ version of my poem, or sky-song as I call it,
Helicopter Blues, which can also be sung in a 12-bar blues arrangement (normally in
Emaj but in Am if you’re feeling cool)
I got the helicopter blues
They’re going round in my head
I got the helicopter blues
They’re still going round in my head
brother please tell me what to do about these helicopter blues
My engine she’s failing
Gotta reduce my torque
My engine she keeps failing
Gotta pull back on my power
seems like I’m autorotating from all these helicopter blues
My tail rotor ain’t working
Ain’t got no place to go
My tail rotor she ain’t working
Ain’t got no place to turn
These helicopter blues brother
They’re driving me insane
My humms are a humming
Feel all fatigued, used and abused
My humms are humming
I’m worn out from all this aerofoil toil
If I don’t get some maintenance
sister I’ve had it with all these helicopter blues
My gearbox is whining
Must need more lubrication

 
xx
Preface to second edition
I said I can’t stand this whining
please ease my pain with boiling oil
If I don’t get that stuff right now
I’m gonna lock up with those helicopter blues
Dark blue or light
The blues got a strong hold on me
It really don’t matter which it is
The blues got no respect for me
Well, if only I could change to green
Maybe I could shake off these helicopter blues
I’ve designed a new helicopter
It’ll be free of the blues
I’ve used special techniques and powerful computers
I’m sure I know what I’m doing
now I gotta ﬁnd someone to help me chase away these helicopter blues
I went to see Boeing
Said I got this new blues-free design
I went up to see Boeing, told them my story and it sounded ﬁne
But they said why blue’s our favourite colour
Besides which, you’re European
So I took my design to Eurocopter
I should have thought of them ﬁrst
If I’d only gone to Eurocopter
I wouldn’t be standing here dying of thirst
They said ‘ces la vie mon frere’ you can’t make a sans bleu helicoptre
I went to see Sikorsky
I thought – They’ll ﬁx the blues
They sent for Nick Lappos
To ﬁx the helicopter blues
Nick said don’t be such a baby Gareth
(besides, I don’t work here anymore)
Just enjoy those helicopter blues
I’ll go see Ray Prouty
People say, Ray – he ain’t got no blues
Please help me Ray – how much more aerodynamics do I need – I’ll clean your shoes
Ray said, wake up and smell the coffee fella
Learn how to hide those helicopter blues
I’ve learned to live with them now
I’m talking about the helicopter blues
Even got to enjoy them
Those sweet, soothing helicopter blues
I’m as weary as hell but please don’t take away my helicopter blues

Introduction
The underlying premise of this book is that ﬂight dynamics and control is a central
discipline, at the heart of aeronautics, linking the aerodynamic and structural sciences
with the applied technologies of systems and avionics and, above all, with the pilot.
Flight dynamics engineers need to have breadth and depth in their domain of interest,
and often hold a special responsibility in design and research departments. It is asserted
that more than any other aerospace discipline, ﬂight dynamics offers a viewpoint on,
and is connected to, the key rotorcraft attributes and technologies – from the detailed
ﬂuid dynamics associated with the interaction of the main rotor wake with the empen-
nage, to the servo-aeroelastic couplings between the rotor and control system, through
to the evaluation of enhanced safety, operational advantage and mission effectiveness
of good ﬂying qualities. It is further asserted that the multidisciplinary nature of ro-
torcraft ﬂight dynamics places it in a unique position to hold the key to concurrency
in requirements capture and design, i.e., the ability to optimize under the inﬂuence of
multiple constraints. In the author’s view, the role of the practising ﬂight dynamics
engineer is therefore an important one and there is a need for guidebooks and practi-
tioner’s manuals to the subject to assist in the development of the required skills and
knowledge. This book is an attempt at such a manual, and it discusses ﬂight dynamics
under two main headings – simulation modelling and ﬂying qualities. The importance
of good simulation ﬁdelity and robust ﬂying qualities criteria in the requirements cap-
ture and design phases of a new project cannot be overstated, and this theme will be
expanded upon later in this chapter and throughout the book. Together, these attributes
underpin conﬁdence in decision making during the high-risk early design phase and
are directed towards the twin goals of achieving super-safe ﬂying qualities and getting
designs right, ﬁrst time. These goals have motivated much of the research conducted
in government research laboratories, industry and universities for several decades.
In this short general Introduction, the aim is to give the reader a qualitative
appreciation of the two main subjects – simulation modelling and ﬂying qualities. The
topics that come within the scope of ﬂight dynamics are also addressed brieﬂy, but are
not covered in the book for various reasons. Finally, a brief ‘roadmap’ to the seven
technical chapters is presented.
1.1
Simulation Modelling
It is beyond dispute that the observed behaviour of aircraft is so complex and puzzling
that, without a well developed theory, the subject could not be treated intelligently.
We use this quotation from Duncan (Ref. 1.1) in expanded form as a guiding light
at the beginning of Chapter 3, the discourse on building simulation models. Duncan

Helicopter Flight Dynamics
wrote these words in relation to ﬁxed-wing aircraft over 50 years ago and they still
hold a profound truth today. However, while it may be ‘beyond dispute’ that well-
developed theories of ﬂight are vital, a measure of the development level at any
one time can be gauged by the ability of Industry to predict behaviour correctly
before ﬁrst ﬂight, and rotorcraft experience to date is not good. In the 1989 AHS
Nikolsky Lecture (Ref. 1.2), Crawford promotes a ‘back to basics’ approach to im-
proving rotorcraft modelling in order to avoid major redesign effort resulting from
poor predictive capability. Crawford cites examples of the redesign required to im-
prove, or simply ‘put right’, ﬂight performance, vibration levels and ﬂying quali-
ties for a number of contemporary US military helicopters. A similar story could be
told for European helicopters. In Ref. 1.3, the author presents data on the percent-
age of development test ﬂying devoted to handling and control, with values between
25 and 50% being quite typical. The message is that helicopters take a considerable
length of time to qualify to operational standard, usually much longer than originally
planned, and a principal reason lies with the deﬁciencies in analytical design meth-
ods.
Underlying the failure to model ﬂight behaviour adequately are three aspects.
First, there is no escaping that the rotorcraft is an extremely complex dynamic system
and the modelling task requires extensive skill and effort. Second, such complexity
needs signiﬁcant investment in analytical methods and specialist modelling skills and
the recognition by programme managers that these are most effectively applied in the
formative stages of design. The channelling of these investments towards the critically
deﬁcient areas is also clearly very important. Third, there is still a serious shortage
of high-quality, validation test data, both at model scale and from ﬂight test. There
is an old adage in the world of ﬂight dynamics relating to the merits of test versus
theory, which goes something like – ‘everyone believes the test results, except the
person who made the measurements, and nobody believes the theoretical results, ex-
cept the person who calculated them’. This saying stems from the knowledge that
it is much easier, for example, to tell the computer to output rotor blade incidence
at 3/4 radius on the retreating side of the disc than it is to measure it. What are
required, in the author’s opinion, are research and development programmes that in-
tegrate the test and modelling activities so that the requirements of the one drive the
other.
There are some signs that the importance of modelling and modelling skills is
recognized at the right levels, but the problem will require constant attention to guard
against the attitude that the ‘big’ resources should be reserved for production, when
the user and manufacturer, in theory, receive their greatest rewards. Chapters 3, 4 and
5 of this book are concerned with modelling, but we shall not dwell on the deﬁ-
ciencies of the acquisition process, but rather on where the modelling deﬁciencies
lie. The author has taken the opportunity in this Introduction to reinforce the phi-
losophy promoted in Crawford’s Nikolsky Lecture with the thought that the reader
may well be concerned as much with the engineering ‘values’ as with the technical
detail.
No matter how good the modelling capability, without criteria as a guide, heli-
copter designers cannot even start on the optimization process; with respect to ﬂying
qualities, a completely new approach has been developed and this forms a signiﬁcant
content of this book.

1.2
Flying Qualities
Experience has shown that a large percentage, perhaps as much as 65%, of the life-
cycle cost of an aircraft is committed during the early design and deﬁnition phases
of a new development program. It is clear, furthermore, that the handling qualities
of military helicopters are also largely committed in these early deﬁnition phases
and, with them, much of the mission capability of the vehicle. For these reasons,
sound design standards are of paramount importance both in achieving desired
performance and avoiding unnecessary program cost.
This quotation, extracted from Ref. 1.4, states the underlying motivation for the de-
velopment of ﬂying qualities criteria – they give the best chance of having mission
performance designed in, whether through safety and economics with civil helicopters
or through military effectiveness. But ﬂying quality is an elusive topic and it has two
equally important facets that can easily get mixed up – the objective and the subjective.
Only recently has enough effort been directed towards establishing a valid set of ﬂying
qualities criteria and test techniques for rotorcraft that has enabled both the subjective
and objective aspects to be addressed in a complementary way. That effort has been
orchestrated under the auspices of several different collaborative programmes to har-
ness the use of ﬂight and ground-based simulation facilities and key skills in North
America and Europe. The result was Aeronautical Design Standard (ADS)-33, which
has changed the way the helicopter community thinks, talks and acts about ﬂying
quality. Although the primary target for ADS-33 was the LHX and later the RAH-66
Comanche programme, other nations have used or developed the standard to meet their
own needs for requirements capture and design. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this book will
refer extensively to ADS-33, with the aim of giving the reader some insight into its
development. The reader should note, however, that these chapters, like ADS-33 itself,
address how a helicopter with good ﬂying qualities should behave, rather than how to
construct a helicopter with good ﬂying qualities.
In search of the meaning of Flying Quality, the author has come across many
different interpretations, from Pirsig’s somewhat abstract but appealing ‘at the moment
of pure quality, subject and object are identical’ (Ref. 1.5), to a point of view put forward
by one ﬂight dynamics engineer: ‘ﬂying qualities are what you get when you’ve done
all the other things’. Unfortunately, the second interpretation has a certain ring of truth
because until ADS-33, there was very little coherent guidance on what constituted
good ﬂying qualities. The ﬁrst breakthrough for the ﬂying qualities discipline came
with the recognition that criteria needed to be related to task. The subjective rating
scale, developed by Cooper and Harper (Ref. 1.6) in the late 1960s, was already task
and mission oriented. In the conduct of a handling qualities experiment, the Cooper–
Harper approach forces the engineer to deﬁne a task with performance standards and
to agree with the pilot on what constitutes minimal or extensive levels of workload.
But the objective criteria at that time were more oriented to the stability and control
characteristics of aircraft than to their ability to perform tasks well. The relationship
clearly is important but the lack of task-oriented test data meant that early attempts
to deﬁne criteria boundaries involved a large degree of guesswork and hypothesis.
Once the two ingredients essential for success in the development of new criteria, task-
orientation and test data, were recognized and resources were channelled effectively,
the combined expertise of several agencies focused their efforts, and during the 1980s

Helicopter Flight Dynamics
and 1990s, a completely new approach was developed. With the advent of digital
ﬂight control systems, which provide the capability to confer different mission ﬂying
qualities in the same aircraft, this new approach can now be exploited to the full.
One of the aspects of the new approach is the relationship between the internal
attributes of the air-vehicle and the external inﬂuences. The same aircraft might have
perfectly good handling qualities for nap-of-the-earth operations in the day environ-
ment, but degrade severely at night; obviously, the visual cues available to the pilot play
a fundamental role in the perception of ﬂying qualities. This is a fact of operational life,
but the emphasis on the relationship between the internal attributes and the external
inﬂuences encourages design teams to think more synergistically, e.g., the quality of
the vision aids, and what the symbology should do, becomes part of the same ﬂying
qualities problem as what goes into the control system, and, more importantly, the
issues need to be integrated in the same solution. We try to emphasize the importance
of this synergy ﬁrst in Chapter 2, then later in Chapters 6 and 7.
The point is made on several occasions in this book, for emphasis, that good ﬂying
qualities make for safe and effective operations; all else being equal, less accidents
will occur with an aircraft with good handling qualities compared with an aircraft with
merely acceptable handling, and operations will be more productive. This statement
may be intuitive, but there is very little supporting data to quantify this. Later, in
Chapter 7, the potential beneﬁts of handling to ﬂight safety and effectiveness through a
probabilistic analysis are examined, considering the pilot as a component with failure
characteristics similar to any other critical aircraft component. The results may appear
controversial and they are certainly tentative, but they point to one way in which
the question, ‘How valuable are ﬂying qualities?’, may be answered. This theme is
continued in Chapter 8 where the author presents an analysis of the effects of degraded
handling qualities on safety and operations, looking in detail at the impact of degraded
visual conditions, ﬂight system failures and strong atmospheric disturbances.
1.3
Missing Topics
It seems to be a common feature of book writing that the end product turns out quite
different than originally intended and Helicopter Flight Dynamics is no exception. It
was planned to be much shorter and to cover a wider range of subjects! In hindsight,
the initial plan was perhaps too ambitious, although the extent of the ﬁnal product,
cut back considerably in scope, has surprised even the author. There are three ‘major’
topic areas, originally intended as separate chapters, that have virtually disappeared
– ‘Stability and control augmentation (including active control)’, ‘Design for ﬂying
qualities’ and ‘Simulation validation (including system identiﬁcation tools)’. All three
are referred to as required, usually brieﬂy, throughout the book, but there have been
such advances in recent years that to give these topics appropriate coverage would have
extended the book considerably. They remain topics for future treatment, particularly
the progress with digital ﬂight control and the use of simulators in design, development
and certiﬁcation. In the context of both these topics, we appear to be in an era of rapid
development, suggesting that a better time to document the state of the art may well be
in a few years from now. The absence of a chapter or section on simulation model vali-
dation techniques may appear to be particularly surprising, but is compensated for by
the availability of the AGARD (Advisory Report on Rotorcraft System Identiﬁcation),

 
Introduction

which gives a fairly detailed coverage of the state of the art in this subject up to the
early 1990s (Ref. 1.7). Since the publication of the ﬁrst edition, signiﬁcant strides have
been made in the development of simulation models for use in design and also training
simulators. Reference 1.8 reviews some of these developments but we are somewhat
in mid-stream with this new push to increase ﬁdelity and the author has resisted the
temptation to bring this topic into the second edition.
The book says very little about the internal hardware of ﬂight dynamics – the pilot’s
controls and the mechanical components of the control system including the hydraulic
actuators. The pilot’s displays and instruments and their importance for ﬂight in poor
visibility are brieﬂy treated in Chapter 7 and the associated perceptual issues are treated
in some depth in Chapter 8, but the author is conscious of the many missing elements
here. In Chapter 3, the emphasis has been on modelling the main rotor, and many other
elements, such as the engine and transmission systems, are given limited coverage.
It is hoped that the book will be judged more on what it contains than on what it
doesn’t.
1.4
Simple Guide to the Book
Thisbookcontainsseventechnicalchapters.Foranoverviewofthesubjectofhelicopter
ﬂight dynamics, the reader is referred to the Introductory Tour in Chapter 2. Engineers
familiar with ﬂight dynamics, but new to rotorcraft, may ﬁnd this a useful starting point
for developing an understanding of how and why helicopters work. Chapters 3, 4 and
5 are a self-contained group concerned with modelling helicopter ﬂight dynamics. To
derive beneﬁt from these chapters requires a working knowledge of the mathematical
analysis tools of dynamic systems. Chapter 3 aims to provide sufﬁcient knowledge and
understanding to enable a basic ﬂight simulation of a helicopter to be created.
Chapter 4 discusses the problems of trim and stability, providing a range of an-
alytical tools necessary to work at these two facets of helicopter ﬂight mechanics.
Chapter 5 extends the analysis of stability to considerations of constrained motion and
completes the ‘working with models’ theme of Chapters 4 and 5 with a discussion
on helicopter response characteristics. In Chapters 4 and 5, ﬂight test data from the
DRA’s research Puma and Lynx and the DLR’s Bo105 are used extensively to provide
a measure of validation to the modelling. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with helicopter ﬂying
qualities from objective and subjective standpoints respectively, although Chapter 7
also covers a number of what we have described as ‘other topics’, including agility
and ﬂight in degraded visual conditions. Chapters 6 and 7 are also self-contained and
do not require the same background mathematical knowledge as that required for the
modelling chapters. A uniﬁed framework for discussing the response characteristics
of ﬂying qualities is laid out in Chapter 6, where each of the four ‘control’ axes are
discussed in turn. Quality criteria are described, drawing heavily on ADS-33 and the
associated publications in the open literature. Chapter 8 is new in the second edition and
contains a detailed treatment of the sources of degraded ﬂying qualities, particularly
ﬂight in degraded visual conditions, the effects of failures in ﬂight system functions
and the impact of severe atmospheric disturbances. These subjects are also discussed
within the framework of quantitative handling qualities engineering, linking with
ADS-33, where appropriate. The idea here is that degraded ﬂying qualities should
be taken into consideration in design with appropriate mitigation technologies.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Chapters 3 and 4 are complemented and supported by appendices. Herein lie the
tables of conﬁguration data and stability and control derivative charts and Tables for
the three case study aircraft.
The author has found it convenient to use both metric and British systems of units
as appropriate throughout the book, although with a preference for metric where an
option was available. Although the metric system is strictly the primary world system
of units of measurements, many helicopters are designed to the older British system.
Publications, particularly those from the United States, often contain data and charts
using the British system, and it has seemed inappropriate to change units for the sake of
uniﬁcation. This does not apply, of course, to cases where data from different sources
are compared. Helicopter engineers are used to working in mixed units; for example,
it is not uncommon to ﬁnd, in the same European paper, references to height in feet,
distance in metres and speed in knots – such is the rich variety of the world of the
helicopter engineer.

Helicopter ﬂight dynamics – an
introductory tour
In aviation history the nineteenth century is characterized by man’s re-
lentless search for a practical ﬂying machine. The 1860s saw a peculiar
burst of enthusiasm for helicopters in Europe and the above picture, show-
ing an 1863 ‘design’ by Gabrielle de la Landelle, reﬂects the fascination
with aerial tour-boats at that time. The present chapter takes the form of
a ‘tour of ﬂight dynamics’ on which the innovative, and more practical,
European designs from the 1960s – the Lynx, Puma and Bo105 – will be
introduced as the principal reference aircraft of this book. These splendid
designs are signiﬁcant in the evolution of the modern helicopter and an
understanding of their behaviour provides important learning material
on this tour and throughout the book.
2.1
Introduction
This chapter is intended to guide the reader on a Tour of the subject of this book with
the aim of instilling increased motivation by sampling and linking the wide range of
subtopics that make the whole. The chapter is likely to raise more questions than it will
answer and it will point to later chapters of the book where these are picked up and
addressed in more detail. The Tour topics will range from relatively simple concepts
such as how the helicopter’s controls work, through to more complex effects such as
the inﬂuence of rotor design on dynamic stability, the conﬂict between stability and
controllability and the specialized handling qualities required for military and civil
mission task elements. All these topics lie within the domain of the ﬂight dynamics
engineer and within the scope of this book. This chapter is required reading for the
reader who wishes to beneﬁt most from the book as a whole. Many concepts are

introduced and developed in fundamental form here in this chapter, and the material
in later chapters will draw on the resulting understanding gained by the reader.
One feature is re-emphasized here. This book is concerned with modelling ﬂight
dynamics and developing criteria for ﬂying qualities, rather than how to design and
build helicopters to achieve deﬁned levels of quality. We cannot, nor do we wish to,
ignore design issues; requirements can be credible only if they are achievable with
the available hardware. However, largely because of the author’s own background
and experience, design will not be a central topic in this book and there will be no
chapter dedicated to it. Design issues will be discussed in context throughout the later
chapters and some of the principal considerations will be summarized on this Tour, in
Section 2.5.
2.2
Four Reference Points
We begin by introducing four useful reference points for developing an appreciation
of ﬂying qualities and ﬂight dynamics; these are summarized in Fig. 2.1 and comprise
the following:
(1) the mission and the associated piloting tasks;
(2) the operational environment;
(3) the vehicle conﬁguration, dynamics and the ﬂight envelope;
(4) the pilot and pilot–vehicle interface.
With this perspective, the vehicle dynamics can be regarded as internal attributes, the
mission and environment as the external inﬂuences and the pilot and pilot–vehicle
interface (pvi) as the connecting human factors. While these initially need to be dis-
cussed separately, it is their interaction and interdependence that widen the scope of
the subject of ﬂight dynamics to reveal its considerable scale. The inﬂuences of the

mission task on the pilot’s workload, in terms of precision and urgency, and the external
environment, in terms of visibility and gustiness, and hence the scope for exploiting
the aircraft’s internal attributes, are profound, and in many ways are key concerns and
primary drivers in helicopter technology development. Flying qualities are determined
at the conﬂuence of these references.
2.2.1
The mission and piloting tasks
Flying qualities change with the weather or, more generally, with the severity of the
environment in which the helicopter operates; they also change with ﬂight condition,
mission type and phase and individual mission tasks. This variability will be empha-
sized repeatedly and in many guises throughout this book to emphasize that we are not
just talking about an aircraft’s stability and control characteristics, but more about the
synergy between the internals and the externals referred to above. In later sections, the
need for a systematic ﬂying qualities structure that provides a framework for describ-
ing criteria will be addressed, but we need to do the same with the mission and the
associated ﬂying tasks. For our purposes it is convenient to describe the ﬂying tasks
within a hierarchy as shown in Fig. 2.2. An operation is made up of many missions
which, in turn, are composed of a series of contiguous mission task elements (MTE).
An MTE is a collection of individual manoeuvres and will have a deﬁnite start and
ﬁnish and prescribed temporal and spatial performance requirements. The manoeuvre
sample is the smallest ﬂying element, often relating to a single ﬂying axis, e.g., change
in pitch or roll attitude. Objective ﬂying qualities criteria are normally deﬁned for, and
tested with, manoeuvre samples; subjective pilot assessments are normally conducted
by ﬂying MTEs. The ﬂying qualities requirements in the current US Army’s handling
qualities requirements, ADS-33C (Ref. 2.1), are related directly to the required MTEs.
Hence, while missions, and correspondingly aircraft type, may be quite different, MTEs
are often common and are a key discriminator of ﬂying qualities. For example, both

Helicopter Flight Dynamics
utility transports in the 30-ton weight category and anti-armour helicopters in the 10-ton
weight category may need to ﬂy slaloms and precision hovers in their nap-of-the-earth
(NoE) missions. This is one of the many areas where ADS-33C departs signiﬁcantly
from its predecessor, Mil Spec 8501A (Ref. 2.2), where aircraft weight and size served
as the key deﬁning parameters. The MTE basis of ADS-33C also contrasts with the
ﬁxed-wing requirements, MIL-F-8785C (Ref. 2.3), where ﬂight phases are deﬁned as
the discriminating mission elements. Thus, the non-terminal ﬂight phases in Category
A (distinguished by rapid manoeuvring and precision tracking) include air-to-air com-
bat, in-ﬂight refuelling (receiver) and terrain following, while Category B (gradual
manoeuvres) includes climb, in-ﬂight refuelling (tanker) and emergency deceleration.
Terminal ﬂight phases (accurate ﬂight path control, gradual manoeuvres) are classiﬁed
under Category C, including take-off, approach and landing. Through the MTE and
Flight Phase, current rotary and ﬁxed-wing ﬂying qualities requirements are described
as mission oriented.
To understand better how this relates to helicopter ﬂight dynamics, we shall now
brieﬂy discuss two typical reference missions. Figure 2.3 illustrates a civil mission,
described as the offshore supply mission; Fig. 2.4 illustrates the military mission,
described as the armed reconnaissance mission. On each ﬁgure a selected phase has
been expanded and shown to comprise a sequence of MTEs (Figs 2.3(b), 2.4(b)). A
typical MTE is extracted and deﬁned in more detail (Figs 2.3(c), 2.4(c)). In the case
of the civil mission, we have selected the landing onto the helideck; for the military
mission, the ‘mask–unmask–mask’ sidestep is the selected MTE. It is difﬁcult to break
the MTEs down further; they are normally multi-axis tasks and, as such, contain a

number of concurrent manoeuvre samples. The accompanying MTE text deﬁnes the
constraints and performance requirements, which are likely to be dependent on a range
of factors. For the civil mission, for example, the spatial constraints will be dictated by
the size of the helideck and the touchdown velocity by the strength of the undercarriage.
The military MTE will be inﬂuenced by weapon performance characteristics and any
spatial constraints imposed by the need to remain concealed from the radar systems of
threats. Further discussion on the design of ﬂight test manoeuvres as stylized MTEs
for the evaluation of ﬂying qualities is contained in Chapter 7.
Ultimately, the MTE performance will determine the ﬂying qualities requirements
of the helicopter. This is a fundamental point. If all that helicopters had to do was to
ﬂy from one airport to another in daylight and good weather, it is unlikely that ﬂying
qualities would ever be a design challenge; taking what comes from meeting other
performance requirements would probably be quite sufﬁcient. But if a helicopter is
required to land on the back of a ship in sea state 6 or to be used to ﬁght at night,
then conferring satisfactory ﬂying qualities that minimize the probability of mission
or even ﬂight failure is a major design challenge. Criteria that adequately address the
developing missions are the cornerstones of design, and the associated MTEs are the
data source for the criteria.
The reference to weather and ﬂying at night suggests that the purely ‘kinematic’
deﬁnition of the MTE concept is insufﬁcient for deﬁning the full operating context;
the environment, in terms of weather, temperature and visibility, are equally important
and bring us to the second reference point.

2.2.2
The operational environment
A typical operational requirement will include a deﬁnition of the environmental con-
ditions in which the helicopter needs to work in terms of temperature, density altitude,
wind strength and visibility. These will then be reﬂected in an aircraft’s ﬂight manual.
The requirements wording may take the form: ‘this helicopter must be able to operate
(i.e., conduct its intended mission, including start-up and shut-down) in the following
conditions – 5000 ft altitude, 15◦C, wind speeds of 40 knots gusting to 50 knots, from
any direction, in day or night’. This description deﬁnes the limits to the operational
capability in the form of a multidimensional envelope.
Throughoutthehistoryofaviation,theneedtoextendoperationsintopoorweather
and at night has been a dominant driver for both economic and military effectiveness.
Fifty years ago, helicopters were fair weather machines with marginal performance;
now they regularly operate in conditions from hot and dry to cold, wet and windy,
and in low visibility. One of the unique operational capabilities of the helicopter is its
ability to operate in the NoE or, more generally, in near-earth conditions deﬁned in
Ref. 2.1 as ‘operations sufﬁciently close to the ground or ﬁxed objects on the ground,
or near water and in the vicinity of ships, oil derricks, etc., that ﬂying is primarily
accomplished with reference to outside objects’. In near-earth operations, avoiding
the ground and obstacles clearly dominates the pilot’s attention and, in poor visibil-
ity, the pilot is forced to ﬂy more slowly to maintain the same workload. During the
formative years of ADS-33, it was recognized that the classiﬁcation of the quality of
the visual cues in terms of instrument or visual ﬂight conditions was inadequate to
describe the conditions in the NoE. To quote from Hoh (Ref. 2.4), ‘The most crit-
ical contributor to the total pilot workload appears to be the quality of the out-of-
the-window cues for detecting aircraft attitudes, and, to a lesser extent, position and
velocity. Currently, these cues are categorized in a very gross way by designating the
environment as either VMC (visual meteorological conditions) or IMC (instrument
meteorological conditions). A more discriminating approach is to classify visibility
in terms of the detailed attitude and position cues available during the experiment or
proposed mission and to associate handling qualities requirements with these ﬁner
grained classiﬁcations.’ The concept of the outside visual cues (OVC) was introduced,
along with an OVC pilot rating that provided a subjective measure of the visual cue
quality. The stimulus for the development of this concept was the recognition that
handling qualities are particularly affected by the visual cues in the NoE, yet there
was no process or methodology to quantify this contribution. One problem is that the
cue is a dynamic variable and can be judged only when used in its intended role.
Eventually, out of the confusion surrounding this subject emerged the usable cue en-
vironment (UCE), which was to become established as one of the key innovations
of ADS-33. In its developed form, the UCE embraces not only the OVC, but also
any artiﬁcial vision aids provided to the pilot, and is determined from an aggregate
of pilot visual cue ratings (VCR) relating to the pilot’s ability to perceive changes
in, and make adjustments to, aircraft attitude and velocity. Handling qualities in de-
graded visual conditions, the OVC and the UCE will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 7.
The MTE and the UCE are two important building blocks in the new parlance of
ﬂying qualities; a third relates to the aircraft’s response characteristics and provides a
vital link between the MTE and UCE.

2.2.3
The vehicle conﬁguration, dynamics and ﬂight envelope
The helicopter is required to perform as a dynamic system within the user-deﬁned
operational ﬂight envelope (OFE), or that combination of airspeed, altitude, rate
of climb/descent, sideslip, turn rate, load factor and other limiting parameters that
bound the vehicle dynamics, required to fulﬁl the user’s function. Beyond this lies the
manufacturer-deﬁned safe ﬂight envelope (SFE), which sets the limits to safe ﬂight,
normally in terms of the same parameters as the OFE, but represents the physical limits
of structural, aerodynamic, powerplant, transmission or ﬂight control capabilities. The
margin between the OFE and the SFE needs to be large enough so that inadvertent
transient excursions beyond the OFE are tolerable. Within the OFE, the ﬂight mechan-
ics of a helicopter can be discussed in terms of three characteristics – trim, stability
and response, a classiﬁcation covered in more detail in Chapters 4 and 5.
Trim is concerned with the ability to maintain ﬂight equilibrium with controls
ﬁxed; the most general trim condition is a turning (about the vertical axis), descending
or climbing (assuming constant air density and temperature), sideslipping manoeuvre at
constant speed. More conventional ﬂight conditions such as hover, cruise, autorotation
or sustained turns are also trims, of course, but the general case is distinguished by
the four ‘outer’ ﬂight-path states, and this is simply a consequence of having four
independent helicopter controls – three for the main rotor and one for the tail rotor.
The rotorspeed is not normally controllable by the pilot, but is set to lie within the
automatically governed range. For a helicopter, the so-called inner states – the fuselage
attitudes and rates – are uniquely deﬁned by the ﬂight path states in a trim condition.
For tilt rotors and other compound rotorcraft, the additional controls provide more
ﬂexibility in trim, but such vehicles will not be covered in this book.
Stability is concerned with the behaviour of the aircraft when disturbed from its
trim condition; will it return or will it depart from its equilibrium point? The initial
tendency has been called the static stability, while the longer term characteristics, the
dynamic stability. These are useful physical concepts, though rather crude, but the keys
to developing a deeper understanding and quantiﬁcation of helicopter stability comes
from theoretical modelling of the interacting forces and moments. From there come
the concepts of small perturbation theory and linearization, of stability and control
derivatives and the natural modes of motion and their stability characteristics. The
insight value gained from theoretical modelling is particularly high when consider-
ing the response to pilot controls and external disturbances. Typically, a helicopter
responds to a single-axis control input with multi-axis behaviour; cross-coupling is
almost synonymous with helicopters. In this book we shall be dealing with direct and
coupled responses, sometimes described as on-axis and off-axis responses. On-axis
responses will be discussed within a framework of response types – rate, attitude and
translational-rate responses will feature as types that characterize the initial response
following a step control input. Further discussion is deferred until the modelling sec-
tion within this Tour and later in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Some qualitative appreciation of
vehicle dynamics can be gained, however, without recourse to detailed modelling.
Rotor controls
Figure 2.5 illustrates the conventional main rotor collective and cyclic controls applied
through a swash plate. Collective applies the same pitch angle to all blades and is
the primary mechanism for direct lift or thrust control on the rotor. Cyclic is more

 
16
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.5 Rotor control through a swash plate
complicated and can be fully appreciated only when the rotor is rotating. The cyclic
operates through a swash plate or similar device (see Fig. 2.5), which has non-rotating
and rotating halves, the latter attached to the blades with pitch link rods, and the former
to the control actuators. Tilting the swash plate gives rise to a one-per-rev sinusoidal
variation in blade pitch with the maximum/minimum axis normal to the tilt direction.
The rotor responds to collective and cyclic inputs by ﬂapping as a disc, in coning
and tilting modes. In hover the responses are uncoupled with collective pitch resulting
in coning and cyclic pitch resulting in rotor disc tilting. The concept of the rotor as
a coning and tilting disc (deﬁned by the rotor blade tip path plane) will be further
developed in the modelling chapters. The sequence of sketches in Fig. 2.6 illustrates
how the pilot would need to apply cockpit main rotor controls to transition into forward
ﬂight from an out-of-ground-effect (oge) hover. Points of interest in this sequence are:
(1) forward cyclic (η1s) tilts the rotor disc forward through the application of cyclic pitch
with a maximum/minimum axis laterally – pitching the blade down on the advancing
side and pitching up on the retreating side of the disc; this 90◦phase shift between
pitch and ﬂap is the most fundamental facet of rotor behaviour and will be revisited
later on this Tour and in the modelling chapters;
(2) forward tilt of the rotor directs the thrust vector forward and applies a pitching
moment to the helicopter fuselage, hence tilting the thrust vector further forward and
accelerating the aircraft into forward ﬂight;
(3) as the helicopter accelerates, the pilot ﬁrst raises his collective (ηc) to maintain height,
then lowers it as the rotor thrust increases through so-called ‘translational lift’ – the
dynamic pressure increasing more rapidly on the advancing side of the disc than it
decreases on the retreating side; cyclic needs to be moved increasingly forward and to
the left (η1c) (for anticlockwise rotors) as forward speed is increased. The cyclic
requirements are determined by the asymmetric fore–aft and lateral aerodynamic
loadings induced in the rotor by forward ﬂight.
The main rotor combines the primary mechanisms for propulsive force and control,
aspects that are clearly demonstrated in the simple manoeuvre described above. Typical

acceleration; (c) translational lift
control ranges for main rotor controls are 15◦for collective, more than 20◦for longi-
tudinal cyclic and 15◦for lateral cyclic, which requires that each individual blade has
a pitch range of more than 30◦. At the same time, the tail rotor provides the antitorque
reaction (due to the powerplant) in hover and forward ﬂight, while serving as a yaw
control device in manoeuvres. Tail rotors, or other such controllers on single main rotor
helicopters, e.g., fenestron/fantail or Notar (Refs 2.5, 2.6), are normally ﬁtted only with
collective control applied through the pilot’s pedals on the cockpit ﬂoor, often with a
range of more than 40◦; such a large range is required to counteract the negative pitch
applied by the built-in pitch/ﬂap coupling normally found on tail rotors to alleviate
transient ﬂapping.
Two distinct ﬂight regimes
It is convenient for descriptive purposes to consider the ﬂight of the helicopter in
two distinct regimes – hover/low speed (up to about 45 knots), including vertical
manoeuvring, and mid/high speed ﬂight (up to Vne – never-exceed velocity). The low-
speed regime is very much unique to the helicopter as an operationally useful regime;
no other ﬂight vehicles are so ﬂexible and efﬁcient at manoeuvring slowly, close to
the ground and obstacles, with the pilot able to manoeuvre the aircraft almost with
disregard for ﬂight direction. The pilot has direct control of thrust with collective and
the response is fairly immediate (time constant to maximum acceleration O(0.1 s));
the vertical rate time constant is much greater, O(3 s), giving the pilot the impression
of an acceleration command response type (see Section 2.3). Typical hover thrust
margins at operational weights are between 5 and 10% providing an initial horizontal
acceleration capability of about 0.3–0.5 g. This margin increases through the low-speed
regime as the (induced rotor) power required reduces (see Chapter 3). Pitch and roll
manoeuvring are accomplished through tilting the rotor disc and hence rotating the

 
18
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
fuselage and rotor thrust (time constant for rate response types O(0.5 s)), yaw through
tail rotor collective (yaw rate time constant O(2 s)) and vertical through collective, as
described above. Flight in the low-speed regime can be gentle and docile or aggressive
and agile, depending on aircraft performance and the urgency with which the pilot
‘attacks’ a particular manoeuvre. The pilot cannot adopt a carefree handling approach,
however. Apart from the need to monitor and respect ﬂight envelope limits, a pilot
has to be wary of a number of behavioural quirks of the conventional helicopter in
its privileged low-speed regime. Many of these are not fully understood and similar
physical mechanisms appear to lead to quite different handling behaviour depending
on the aircraft conﬁguration. A descriptive parlance has built up over the years, some
of which has developed in an almost mythical fashion as pilots relate anecdotes of their
experiences ‘close to the edge’. These include ground horseshoe effect, pitch-up, vortex
ring and power settling, ﬁshtailing and inﬂow roll. Later, in Chapter 3, some of these
effects will be explained through modelling, but it is worth noting that such phenomena
are difﬁcult to model accurately, often being the result of strongly interacting, nonlinear
and time-dependent forces. A brief glimpse of just two will sufﬁce for the moment.
Figure 2.7 illustrates the tail rotor control requirements for early Marks (Mks 1–5)
of Lynx at high all-up-weight, in the low-speed regime corresponding to winds from

different ‘forward’ azimuths (for pedal positions <40%). The asymmetry is striking,
and the ‘hole’ in the envelope with winds from ‘green 060–075’ (green winds from
starboard in directions between 60◦and 75◦from aircraft nose) is clearly shown. This
has been attributed to main rotor wake/tail rotor interactions, which lead to a loss of
tail rotor effectiveness when the main rotor wake becomes entrained in the tail rotor.
The loss of control and high power requirements threatening at this particular edge of
the envelope provide for very little margin between the OFE and SFE.
A second example is the so-called vortex-ring condition, which occurs in near-
vertical descent conditions at moderate rates of descent (O(500–800 ft/min)) on the
main rotor and corresponding conditions in sideways motion on the tail rotor. Figure
2.8, derived from Drees (Ref. 2.7), illustrates the ﬂow patterns through a rotor operating
in vertical ﬂight. At the two extremes of helicopter (propeller) and windmill states, the
ﬂow is relatively uniform. Before the ideal autorotation condition is reached, where
the induced downwash is equal and opposite to the upﬂow, a state of irregular and
strong vorticity develops, where the upﬂow/downwash becomes entrained together in
a doughnut-shaped vortex. The downwash increases as the vortex grows in strength,

 
20
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
leading to large reductions in rotor blade incidences spanwise. Entering the vortex-ring
state, the helicopter will increase its rate of descent very rapidly as the lift is lost; any
further application of collective by the pilot will tend to reduce the rotor efﬁciency
even further – rates of descent of more than 3000 ft/min can build up very rapidly.
The consequences of entering a vortex ring when close to the ground are extremely
hazardous.
Rotor stall boundaries
While aeroplanes stall boundaries in level ﬂight occur at low speed, helicopter stall
boundaries occur typically at the high-speed end of the OFE. Figure 2.9 shows the
aerodynamicmechanismsatworkattheboundary.Asthehelicopterﬂiesfaster,forward
cyclic is increased to counteract the lateral lift asymmetry due to cyclical dynamic
pressure variations. This increases retreating blade incidences and reduces advancing
blade incidences (α); at the same time forward ﬂight brings cyclical Mach number
(M) variations and the α versus M locus takes the shape sketched in Fig. 2.10. The
stall boundary is also drawn, showing how both advancing and retreating blades are
close to the limit at high speed. The low-speed, trailing edge-type, high incidence
(O(15◦)) stall on the retreating blade is usually triggered ﬁrst, often by the sharp local
incidence perturbations induced by the trailing tip vortex from previous blades. Shock-
induced boundary layer separation will stall the advancing blade at very low incidence
(O(1–2◦)). Both retreating and advancing blade stall are initially local, transient effects
and self-limiting on account of the decreasing incidence and increasing velocities in
the fourth quadrant of the disc and the decreasing Mach number in the second quadrant.
The overall effect on rotor lift will not be nearly as dramatic as when an aeroplane
stalls at low speed. However, the rotor blade lift stall is usually accompanied by a large
change in blade chordwise pitching moment, which in turn induces a strong, potentially
more sustained, torsional oscillation and ﬂuctuating stall, increasing vibration levels
and inducing strong aircraft pitch and roll motions.

Rotor stall and the attendant increase in loads therefore determine the limits to
forward speed for helicopters. This and other effects can be illustrated on a plot of rotor
lift (or thrust T) limits against forward speed V. It is more general to normalize these
quantities as thrust coefﬁcient CT and advance ratio µ, where
CT =
T
ρ(R)2πR2 ,
µ = V
R
where  is the rotorspeed, R the rotor radius and ρ the air density. Figure 2.11 shows
how the thrust limits vary with advance ratio and includes the sustained or power limit
boundary, the retreating and advancing blade lines, the maximum thrust line and the
structural boundary. The parameter s is the solidity deﬁned as the ratio of blade area
to disc area. The retreating and advancing blade thrust lines in the ﬁgure correspond
to both level and manoeuvring ﬂight. At a given speed, the thrust coefﬁcient can be
increased in level ﬂight, by increasing weight or height ﬂown or by increasing the load
factor in a manoeuvre. The manoeuvre can be sustained or transient and the limits
will be different for the two cases, the loading peak moving inboard and ahead of the
retreating side of the disc in the transient case. The retreating/advancing blade limits
deﬁne the onset of increased vibration caused by local stall, and ﬂight beyond these
limits is accompanied by a marked increase in the fatigue life usage. These are soft
limits, in that they are contained within the OFE and the pilot can ﬂy through them.
However, the usage spectrum for the aircraft will, in turn, deﬁne the amount of time
the aircraft is likely (designed) to spend at different CT or load factors, which, in turn,
will deﬁne the service life of stressed components. The maximum thrust line deﬁnes
the potential limit of the rotor, before local stall spreads so wide that the total lift
reduces. The other imposed limits are deﬁned by the capability of the powerplant and
structural strength of critical components in the rotor and fuselage. The latter is an

 
22
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.11 Rotor thrust limits as a function of advance ratio
SFE design limit, set well outside the OFE. However, rotors at high speed, just like the
wings on ﬁxed-wing aeroplanes, are sometimes aerodynamically capable of exceeding
this.
Having dwelt on aspects of rotor physics and the importance of rotor thrust limits,
it needs to be emphasized that the pilot does not normally know what the rotor thrust
is; he or she can infer it from a load factor or ‘g’ meter, and from a knowledge of
take-off weight and fuel burn, but the rotor limits of more immediate and critical
interest to the pilot will be torque (more correctly a coupled rotor/transmission limit)
and rotorspeed. Rotorspeed is automatically governed on turbine-powered helicopters,
and controlled to remain within a fairly narrow range, dropping only about 5% between
autorotation and full power climb, for example. Overtorquing and overspeeding are
potential hazards for the rotor at the two extremes and are particularly dangerous when
the pilot tries to demand full performance in emergency situations, e.g., evasive hard
turn or pop-up to avoid an obstacle.
Rotor limits, whether thrust, torque or rotorspeed in nature, play a major role in
the ﬂight dynamics of helicopters, in the changing aeroelastic behaviour through to the
handling qualities experienced by the pilot. Understanding the mechanisms at work
near the ﬂight envelope boundary is important in the provision of carefree handling, a
subject we shall return to in Chapter 7.
2.2.4
The pilot and pilot–vehicle interface
This aspect of the subject draws its conceptual and application boundaries from the
engineering and psychological facets of the human factors discipline. We are con-
cerned in this book with the piloting task and hence with only that function in the
crew station; the crew have other, perhaps more important, mission-related duties, but
the degree of spare capacity which the pilot has to share these will depend critically
on his ﬂying workload. The ﬂying task can be visualized as a closed-loop feedback

 
An Introductory Tour
23
Fig. 2.12 The pilot as sensor and motivator in the feedback loop
system with the pilot as the key sensor and motivator (Fig. 2.12). The elements of
Fig. 2.12 form this fourth reference point. The pilot will be well trained and highly
adaptive (this is particularly true of helicopter pilots), and ultimately his or her skills
and experience will determine how well a mission is performed. Pilots gather infor-
mation visually from the outside world and instrument displays, from motion cues
and tactile sensory organs. They continuously make judgements of the quality of their
ﬂight path management and apply any required corrections through their controllers.
The pilot’s acceptance of any new function or new method of achieving an existing
function that assists the piloting task is so important that it is vital that prototypes are
evaluated with test pilots prior to delivery into service. This fairly obvious statement
is emphasized at this point because of its profound impact on the ﬂying qualities ‘pro-
cess’, e.g., the development of new handling criteria, new helmet-mounted display
formats or multi-axis sidesticks. Pilot-subjective opinion of quality, its measurement,
interpretation and correlation with objective measures, underpins all substantiated data
and hence needs to be central to all new developments. Here lies a small catch; most
pilots learn to live with and love their aircraft and to compensate for deﬁciencies. They
will almost certainly have invested some of their ego in their high level of skill and
ability to perform well in difﬁcult situations. Any developments that call for changes
in the way they ﬂy can be met by resistance. To a large extent, this reﬂects a natural
caution and needs to be heeded; test pilots are trained to be critical and to challenge
the engineer’s assumptions because ultimately they will have to work with the new
developments.
Later in this book, in Chapter 6 and, more particularly, Chapter 7, the key role
that test pilots have played in the development of ﬂying qualities and ﬂight control
technology over the last 10 years will be addressed. In Chapter 8 the treatment of the
topicofdegradedhandlingqualitieswillexposesomeofthedangerousconditionspilots
can experience. Lessons learnt through the author’s personal experience of working
with test pilots will be covered.

2.2.5
Résumé of the four reference points
Figure 2.13 illustrates in composite form the interactional nature of the ﬂight dynam-
ics process as reﬂected by the four reference points. The ﬁgure, drawing from the
parlance of ADS-33, tells us that to achieve Level 1 handling qualities in a UCE of
1, a rate response type is adequate; to achieve the same in UCEs of 2 and 3 require
AC (attitude command) or TRC (translational rate command) response types respec-
tively. This classiﬁcation represents a fundamental development in helicopter handling
qualities that lifts the veil off a very complex and confused matter. The ﬁgure also
shows that if the UCE can be upgraded from a 3 to a 2, then reduced augmentation
will be required. A major trade-off between the quality of the visual cues and the
quality of the control augmentation emerges. This will be a focus of attention in later
chapters. Figure 2.13 also reﬂects the requirement that the optimum vehicle dynamic
characteristics may need to change for different MTEs and at the edges of the OFE;
terminology borrowed from ﬁxed-wing parlance serves to describe these features –
task-tailored or mission-oriented ﬂying qualities and carefree handling. Above all else,
the quality requirements for ﬂying are driven by the performance and piloting workload

demands in the MTEs, which are themselves regularly changing user-deﬁned require-
ments. The whole subject is thus evolving from the four reference points – the mission,
the environment, the vehicle and the pilot; they support the ﬂight dynamics discipline
and provide an application framework for understanding and interpreting the mod-
elling and criteria of task-oriented ﬂying qualities. Continuing on the Tour, we address
the ﬁrst of three key technical areas with stronger analytical content – theoretical
modelling.
2.3
Modelling Helicopter Flight Dynamics
A mathematical description or simulation of a helicopter’s ﬂight dynamics needs to
embody the important aerodynamic, structural and other internal dynamic effects (e.g.,
engine, actuation) that combine to inﬂuence the response of the aircraft to pilot’s
controls (handling qualities) and external atmospheric disturbances (ride qualities).
The problem is highly complex and the dynamic behaviour of the helicopter is often
limited by local effects that rapidly grow in their inﬂuence to inhibit larger or faster
motion, e.g., blade stall. The helicopter behaviour is naturally dominated by the main
and tail rotors, and these will receive primary attention in this stage of the Tour; we
need a framework to place the modelling in context.
The problem domain
A convenient and intuitive framework for introducing this important topic is illustrated
in Fig. 2.14, where the natural modelling dimensions of frequency and amplitude are
used to characterize the range of problems within the OFE. The three fundamentals of
ﬂight dynamics – trim, stability and response – can be seen delineated, with the latter
expressed in terms of the manoeuvre envelope from normal to maximum at the OFE
boundary. The ﬁgure also serves as a guide to the scope of ﬂight dynamics as covered
in this book. At small amplitudes and high frequency, the problem domain merges with
that of the loads and vibration engineer. The separating frequency is not distinct. The
ﬂight dynamicist is principally interested in the loads that can displace the aircraft’s

ﬂight path, and over which the human or automatic pilot has some direct control. On
the rotor, these reduce to the zeroth and ﬁrst harmonic motions and loads – all higher
harmonics transmit zero mean vibrations to the fuselage; so the distinction would
appear deceptively simple. The ﬁrst harmonic loads will be transmitted through the
various load paths to the fuselage at a frequency depending on the number of blades.
Perhaps the only general statement that can be made regarding the extent of the ﬂight
dynamicists’ domain is that they must be cognisant of all loads and motions that are of
primary (generally speaking, controlled) and secondary (generally speaking, uncon-
trolled) interest in the achievement of good ﬂying qualities. So, for example, the forced
response of the ﬁrst elastic torsion mode of the rotor blades (natural frequency O(20
Hz)) at one-per-rev could be critical to modelling the rotor cyclic pitch requirements
correctly (Ref. 2.8); including a model of the lead/lag blade dynamics could be critical
to establishing the limits on rate stabilization gain in an automatic ﬂight control sys-
tem (Ref. 2.9); modelling the fuselage bending frequencies and mode shapes could be
critical to the ﬂight control system sensor design and layout (Ref. 2.10).
At the other extreme, the discipline merges with that of the performance and
structural engineers, although both will be generally concerned with behaviour across
the OFE boundary. Power requirements and trim efﬁciency (range and payload issues)
are part of the ﬂight dynamicist’s remit. The aircraft’s static and dynamic (fatigue)
structural strength presents constraints on what can be achieved from the point of view
of ﬂight path control. These need to be well understood by the ﬂight dynamicist.
In summary, vibration, structural loads and steady-state performance traditionally
deﬁne the edges of the OFE within the framework of Fig. 2.14. Good ﬂying qualities
then ensure that the OFE can be used safely, in particular that there will always be
sufﬁcientcontrolmargintoenablerecoveryinemergencysituations.Butcontrolmargin
can be interpreted in a dynamic context, including concepts such as pilot-induced
oscillations and agility. Just as with high-performance ﬁxed-wing aircraft, the dynamic
OFE can be limited, and hence deﬁned, by ﬂying qualities for rotorcraft. In practice, a
balanced design will embrace these in harmony with the central ﬂight dynamics issues,
drawing on concurrent engineering techniques (Ref. 2.11) to quantify the trade-offs
and to identify any critical conﬂicts.
Multiple interacting subsystems
The behaviour of a helicopter in ﬂight can be modelled as the combination of a large
number of interacting subsystems. Figure 2.15 highlights the main rotor element, the
fuselage, powerplant, ﬂight control system, empennage and tail rotor elements and the
resulting forces and moments. Shown in simpliﬁed form in Fig. 2.16 is the orthogonal
body axes system, ﬁxed at the centre of gravity/mass (cg/cm) of the whole aircraft,
about which the aircraft dynamics are referred. Strictly speaking, the cg will move as the
rotor blades ﬂap, but we shall assume that the cg is located at the mean position, relative
to a particular trim state. The equations governing the behaviour of these interactions
are developed from the application of physical laws, e.g., conservation of energy and
Newton’s laws of motion, to the individual components, and commonly take the form
of nonlinear differential equations written in the ﬁrst-order vector form
dx
dt = f (x, u, t)
(2.1)
with initial conditions x(0) = x0.

x (t) is the column vector of state variables; u (t) is the vector of control variables
and f is a nonlinear function of the aircraft motion, control inputs and external distur-
bances. The reader is directed to Appendix 4A for a brief exposition on the matrix–
vector theory used in this and later chapters. For the special case where only the six
rigid-body degrees of freedom (DoFs) are considered, the state vector x comprises
the three translational velocity components u, v and w, the three rotational velocity
components p, q and r and the Euler angles φ, θ and ψ. The three Euler attitude an-
gles augment the equations of motion through the kinematic relationship between the

fuselage rates p, q and r and the rates of change of the Euler angles. The velocities are
referred to an axes system ﬁxed at the cg as shown in Fig. 2.16 and the Euler angles
deﬁne the orientation of the fuselage with respect to an earth ﬁxed axes system.
The DoFs are usually arranged in the state vector as longitudinal and lateral
motion subsets, as
x = {u, w, q, θ, v, p, φ,r, ψ}
The function f then contains the applied forces and moments, again referred to the
aircraft cg, from aerodynamic, structural, gravitational and inertial sources. Strictly
speaking, the inertial and gravitational forces are not ‘applied’, but it is convenient
to label them so and place them on the right-hand side of the describing equation.
The derivation of these equations from Newton’s laws of motion will be carried out
later in Chapter 3 and its appendix. It is important to note that this six DoF model,
while itself complex and widely used, is still an approximation to the aircraft be-
haviour; all higher DoFs, associated with the rotors (including aeroelastic effects),
powerplant/transmission, control system and the disturbed airﬂow, are embodied in
a quasi-steady manner in the equations, having lost their own individual dynamics
and independence as DoFs in the model reduction. This process of approximation is
a common feature of ﬂight dynamics, in the search for simplicity to enhance phys-
ical understanding and ease the computational burden, and will feature extensively
throughout Chapters 4 and 5.
Trim, stability and response
Continuing the discussion of the 6 DoF model, the solutions to the three fundamental
problems of ﬂight dynamics can be written as
Trim:
f (xe, ue) = 0
(2.2)
Stability:

(2.4)
The trim solution is represented by the zero of a nonlinear algebraic function, where
the controls ue required to hold a deﬁned state xe (subscript e refers to equilibrium) are
computed. With four controls, only four states can be prescribed in trim, the remaining
set forming into the additional unknowns in eqn 2.1. A trimmed ﬂight condition is
deﬁned as one in which the rate of change (of magnitude) of the aircraft’s state vector
is zero and the resultant of the applied forces and moments is zero. In a trimmed
manoeuvre, the aircraft will be accelerating under the action of non-zero resultant
aerodynamic and gravitational forces and moments, but these will then be balanced
by effects such as centrifugal and gyroscopic inertial forces and moments. The trim
equations and associated problems, e.g., predicting performance and control margins,
will be further developed in Chapter 4.
The solution of the stability problem is found by linearizing the equations about a
particular trim condition and computing the eigenvalues of the aircraft system matrix,

 
An Introductory Tour
29
written in eqn 2.3 as the partial derivative of the forcing vector with respect to the
system states. After linearization of eqn 2.1, the resulting ﬁrst-order, constant coef-
ﬁcient differential equations have solutions of the form eλt, the stability of which is
determined by the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues λ. The stability thus found
refers to small motions about the trim point; will the aircraft return to – or depart from –
the trim point if disturbed by, say, a gust? For larger motions, nonlinearities can alter
the behaviour and recourse to the full equations is usually necessary.
The response solution given by eqn 2.4 is found from the time integral of the forc-
ing function and allows the evolution of the aircraft states, forces and moments to be
computed following disturbed initial conditions x(0), and/or prescribed control inputs
and atmospheric disturbances. The nonlinear equations are usually solved numerically;
analytical solutions generally do not exist. Sometimes, narrow-range approximate so-
lutions can be found to describe special large-amplitude nonlinear motion, e.g., limit
cycles, but these are exceptional and usually developed to support the diagnosis of
behaviour unaccounted for in the original design.
The sketches in Fig. 2.17 illustrate typical ways in which trim, stability and re-
sponse results are presented; the key variable in the trim and stability sketches is the
helicopter’s forward speed. The trim control positions are shown with their character-
istic shapes; the stability characteristics are shown as loci of eigenvalues plotted on
the complex plane; the short-term responses to step inputs, or the step responses, are
shown as a function of time. This form of presentation will be revisited later on this
Tour and in later chapters.
The reader of this Tour may feel too quickly plunged into abstraction with the
above equations and their descriptions; the intention is to give some exposure to math-
ematical concepts which are part of the toolkit of the ﬂight dynamicist. Fluency in the

parlance of this mathematics is essential for the serious practitioner. Perhaps even more
essential is a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of rotor ﬂapping behaviour,
which is the next stop on this Tour; here we shall need to rely extensively on theoretical
analysis. A full derivation of the results will be given later in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.
The ﬂapping rotor in vacuo
The equations of motion of a ﬂapping rotor will be developed in a series of steps
(Figs 2.18(a)–(e)), designed to highlight a number of key features of rotor behaviour.
Figure 2.18(a) shows a rotating blade (, rad/s) free to ﬂap (β, rad) about a hinge at
the centre of rotation; to add some generality we shall add a ﬂapping spring at the
hinge (Kβ, N m/rad). The ﬂapping angle β is referred to the rotor shaft; other reference
systems, e.g., relative to the control axis, are discussed in Appendix 3A. It will be shown
later in Chapter 3 that this simple centre-spring representation is quite adequate for
describing the ﬂapping behaviour of teetering, articulated and hingeless or bearingless
rotors, under a wide range of conditions. Initially, we consider the case of ﬂapping
in a vacuum, i.e., no aerodynamics, and we neglect the effects of gravity. The ﬁrst
qualitative point to grasp concerns what happens to the rotor when the rotor shaft is
suddenly tilted to a new angle. For the case of the zero spring stiffness, the rotor disc

will remain aligned in its original position, there being no mechanism to generate a
turning moment on the blade. With a spring added, the blade will develop a persistent
oscillation about the new shaft orientation, with the inertial moment due to out-of-plane
ﬂapping and the centrifugal moment continually in balance.
The dynamic equation of ﬂapping can be derived by taking moments about the
ﬂap hinge during accelerated motion, so that the hinge moment Kββ is balanced by
the inertial moments, thus
Kββ = −
R

0
rm(r) {r ¨β + r2β} dr
(2.5)
where m(r) is the blade mass distribution (kg/m) and (·) indicates differentiation with
respect to time t. Setting (′) as differentiation with respect to ψ = t, the blade azimuth
angle, eqn 2.5 can be rearranged and written as
β′′ + λ2
ββ = 0
(2.6)
where the ﬂapping frequency ratio λβ is given by the expression
λ2
β = 1 +
Kβ
Iβ2
(2.7)
and where the ﬂap moment of inertia is
Iβ =
R

0
m(r)r2 dr
(2.8)
The two inertial terms in eqn 2.5 represent the contributions from accelerated ﬂapping
out of the plane of rotation, r ¨β, and the in-plane centrifugal acceleration arising from
the blade displacement acting towards the centre of the axis of rotation, r2β. Here,
as will be the case throughout this book, we make the assumption that β is small, so
that sin β ∼β and cos β ∼1.
For the special case where Kβ = 0, the solution to eqn 2.6 is simple harmonic
motion with a natural frequency of one-per-rev, i.e., λ2
β = 1. If the blade is disturbed in
ﬂap, the motion will take the form of a persistent, undamped, oscillation with frequency
; the disc cut by the blade in space will take up a new tilt angle equal to the angle of the
initial disturbance. Again, with Kβ set to zero, there will be no tendency for the shaft
to tilt in response to the ﬂapping, since no moments can be transmitted through the
ﬂapping hinge. For the case with non-zero Kβ, the frequency ratio is greater than unity
and the natural frequency of disturbed motion is faster than one-per-rev, disturbed
ﬂapping taking the form of a disc precessing against the rotor rotation, if the shaft
is ﬁxed. With the shaft free to rotate, the hub moment generated by the spring will
cause the shaft to rotate into the direction normal to the disc. Typically, the stiffness
of a hingeless rotor blade can be represented by a spring giving an equivalent λ2
β of
between 1.1 and 1.3. The higher values are typical of the ﬁrst generation of hingeless
rotor helicopters, e.g., Lynx and Bo105, the lower more typical of modern bearingless
designs. The overall stiffness is therefore dominated by the centrifugal force ﬁeld.

 
32
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Before including the effects of blade aerodynamics, we consider the case where
the shaft is rotated in pitch and roll, p and q (see Fig. 2.18(b)). The blade now expe-
riences additional gyroscopic accelerations caused by mutually perpendicular angular
velocities, p, q and . If we neglect the small effects of shaft angular accelerations,
the equation of motion can be written as
β′′ + λ2
ββ = 2
(p cos ψ −q sin ψ)
(2.9)
The conventional zero reference for blade azimuth is at the rear of the disc and ψ is
positive in the direction of rotor rotation; in eqn 2.9 the rotor is rotating anticlockwise
when viewed from above. For clockwise rotors, the roll rate term would be negative.
The steady-state solution to the ‘forced’ motion takes the form
β = β1c cos ψ + β1s sin ψ
(2.10)
where

(2.11)
Thesesolutionsrepresenttheclassicgyroscopicmotionsexperiencedwhenanyrotating
mass is rotated out of plane; the resulting motion is orthogonal to the applied rotation.
β1c is a longitudinal disc tilt in response to a roll rate; β1s a lateral tilt in response to
a pitch rate. The moment transmitted by the single blade to the shaft, in the rotating
axes system, is simply Kββ; in the non-rotating shaft axes, the moment can be written
as pitch (positive nose up) and roll (positive to starboard) components
M = −Kββ (cos ψ) = −Kβ
2 (β1c(1 + cos 2ψ) + β1s sin 2ψ)
(2.12)
L = −Kββ (sin ψ) = −Kβ
2 (β1s(1 −cos 2ψ) + β1c sin 2ψ)
(2.13)
Each component therefore has a steady value plus an equally large wobble at two-
per-rev. For a rotor with Nb evenly spaced blades, it can be shown that the oscillatory
moments cancel, leaving the steady values
M = −Nb

(2.15)
This is a general result that will carry through to the situation when the rotor is working
in air, i.e., the zeroth harmonic hub moments that displace the ﬂight path of the aircraft
are proportional to the tilt of the rotor disc. It is appropriate to highlight that we
have neglected the moment of the in-plane rotor loads in forming these hub moment
expressions. They are therefore strictly approximations to a more complex effect,
which we shall discuss in more detail in Chapter 3. We shall see, however, that the
aerodynamic loads are not only one-per-rev, but also two and higher, giving rise to
vibratory moments. Before considering the effects of aerodynamics, there are two

 
An Introductory Tour
33
points that need to be made about the solution given by eqn 2.11. First, what happens
when λ2
β = 1? This is the classic case of resonance, when according to theory, the
response becomes inﬁnite; clearly, the assumption of small ﬂap angles would break
down well before this and the nonlinearity in the centrifugal stiffening with amplitude
would limit the motion. The second point is that the solution given by eqn 2.11 is only
part of the complete solution. Unless the initial conditions of the blade motion were
very carefully set up, the response would actually be the sum of two undamped motions,
one with the one-per-rev forcing frequency, and the other with the natural frequency λβ.
A complex response would develop, with the combination of two close frequencies
leading to a beating response or, in special cases, non-periodic ‘chaotic’ behaviour.
Such situations are somewhat academic for the helicopter, as the aerodynamic forces
distort the response described above in a dramatic way.
The ﬂapping rotor in air – aerodynamic damping
Figure 2.18(c) shows the blade in air, with the distributed aerodynamic lift ℓ(r, ψ)
acting normal to the resultant velocity; we are neglecting the drag forces in this case.
If the shaft is now tilted to a new reference position, the blades will realign with the
shaft, even with zero spring stiffness. Figures 2.18(d) and (e) illustrate what happens.
When the shaft is tilted, say, in pitch by angle θs, the blades experience an effective
cyclic pitch change with maximum and minimum at the lateral positions (ψ = 90◦
and 180◦). The blades will then ﬂap to restore the zero hub moment condition.
For small ﬂap angles, the equation of ﬂap motion can now be written in the
approximate form

The lift is assumed to be proportional to the incidence of the airﬂow to the chord line,
α, up to stalling incidence, with lift curve slope a0. In Fig. 2.19 the incidence is shown
to comprise two components, one from the applied blade pitch angle θ and one from
the induced inﬂow φ, given by

(2.20)
The Lock number is an important non-dimensional scaling coefﬁcient, giving the ratio
of aerodynamic to inertia forces acting on a rotor blade.
To develop the present analysis further, we consider the hovering rotor and a
constant inﬂow velocity vi over the rotor disc, so that the velocities at station r along
the blade are given by
U T = ¯r,
UP = −λi + ¯r

We defer the discussion on rotor downwash until later in this Chapter and Chapter 3;
for the present purposes, we merely state that a uniform distribution over the disc is a

The ﬂapping eqn 2.22 can tell us a great deal about the behaviour of a rotor in response
to aerodynamic loads; in particular the presence of the ﬂap damping β′ alters the
response characteristics signiﬁcantly. We can write the applied blade pitch in the form
(cf. Fig. 2.5 and the early discussion on rotor controls)
θ = θ0 + θ1c cos ψ + θ1s sin ψ
(2.23)

 
An Introductory Tour
35
where θ0 is the collective pitch and θ1s and θ1c the longitudinal and lateral cyclic
pitch respectively. The forcing function on the right-hand side of eqn 2.22 is therefore
made up of constant and ﬁrst harmonic terms. In the general ﬂight case, with the
pilot active on his controls, the rotor controls θ0, θ1c and θ1s and the fuselage rates
p and q will vary continuously with time. As a ﬁrst approximation we shall assume
that these variations are slow compared with the rotor blade transient ﬂapping. We
can quantify this approximation by noting that the aerodynamic damping in eqn 2.22,
γ /8, varies between about 0.7 and 1.3. In terms of the response to a step input, this
correspondstorisetimes(to63%ofsteady-stateﬂapping)between60and112◦azimuth
(ψ63% = 16 ln(2)/γ ). Rotorspeeds vary from about 27 rad/s on the AS330 Puma to
about 44 rad/s on the MBB Bo105, giving ﬂap time constants between 0.02 and 0.07
s at the extremes. Provided that the time constants associated with the control activity
and fuselage angular motion are an order of magnitude greater than this, the assumption
of rotor quasi-steadiness during aircraft motions will be valid. We shall return to this
assumption a little later on this Tour, but, for now, we assume that the rotor ﬂapping
has time to achieve a new steady-state, one-per-rev motion following each incremental
change in control and fuselage angular velocity. We write the rotor ﬂapping motion in
the quasi-steady-state form
β = β0 + β1c cos ψ + β1s sin ψ
(2.24)
β0 is the rotor coning and β1c and β1s the longitudinal and lateral ﬂapping respec-
tively. The cyclic ﬂapping can be interpreted as a tilt of the rotor disc in the longitu-
dinal (forward) β1c and lateral (port) β1s planes. The coning has an obvious physical
interpretation (see Fig. 2.20).
The quasi-steady coning and ﬁrst harmonic ﬂapping solution to eqn 2.22 can be
obtained by substituting eqns 2.23 and 2.24 into eqn 2.22 and equating constant and
ﬁrst harmonic coefﬁcients. Collecting terms, we can write

The partial derivatives in eqns 2.29–2.32 represent the changes in ﬂapping with changes
in cyclic pitch and shaft rotation and are shown plotted against Stiffness number for
different values of γ in Figs 2.21(a)–(c). Although Sβ is shown plotted up to unity, a
maximum realistic value for current hingeless rotors with heavy blades (small value of
γ ) is about 0.5, with more typical values between 0.05 and 0.3. The control derivatives
illustrated in Fig. 2.21(a) show that the direct ﬂapping response, ∂β1c/∂θ1s, is approx-
imately unity up to typical maximum values of stiffness, i.e., a hingeless rotor blade
ﬂaps by about the same amount as a teetering or articulated rotor. However, the varia-
tion of the coupled ﬂap response, ∂β1c/∂θ1s, is much more signiﬁcant, being as much
as 30% of the primary response at an Sβ of 0.3. When this level of ﬂap cross-coupling
is transmitted through the hub to the fuselage, an even larger ratio of pitch/roll response
coupling can result due the relative magnitudes of the aircraft inertias.
The fundamental 90◦phase shift
A fundamental result of rotor dynamics emerges from the above analysis, that the
ﬂapping response is approximately 90◦out of phase with the applied cyclic pitch, i.e.,
θ1s gives β1c, and θ1c gives β1s. For blades freely articulated at the centre of rotation,
or teetering rotors, the response is lagged by exactly 90◦in hover; for hingeless rotors,

such as the Lynx and Bo105, the phase angle is about 75–80◦. The phase delay is a result
of the rotor being aerodynamically forced, through cyclic pitch, close to resonance,
i.e., one-per-rev. The second-order character of eqn 2.22 results in a low-frequency
response in-phase with inputs and a high-frequency response with a 180◦phase lag.
The innovation of cyclic pitch, forcing the rotor close to its natural ﬂapping frequency,
is amazingly simple and effective – practically no energy is required and a degree of
pitch results in a degree of ﬂapping. A degree of ﬂapping can generate between 0 (for
teetering rotors), 500 (for articulated rotors) and greater than 2000 N m (for hingeless
rotors) of hub moment, depending on the rotor stiffness.
The ﬂap damping derivatives, given by eqns 2.31 and 2.32, are illustrated in
Figs 2.21(b) and (c). The direct ﬂap damping, ∂β1c/∂¯q, is practically independent
of stiffness up to Sβ = 0.5; the cross-damping, ∂β1c/∂¯p, varies linearly with Sβ and
actually changes sign at high values of Sβ. In contrast with the in vacuo case, the direct
ﬂapping response now opposes the shaft motion. The disc follows the rotating shaft,
lagged by an angle given by the ratio of the ﬂap derivatives in the ﬁgures. For very heavy
blades (e.g., γ = 4), the direct ﬂap response is about four times the coupled motion; for
very light blades, the disc tilt angles are more equal. This rather complex response stems
from the two components on the right-hand side of the ﬂapping equation, eqn 2.22,
one aerodynamic due to the distribution of airloads from the angular motion, the other

from the gyroscopic ﬂapping motion. The resultant effect of these competing forces on
the helicopter motion is also complex and needs to be revisited for further discussion
in Chapters 3 and 4. Nevertheless, it should be clear to the reader that the calculation of
the correct Lock number for a rotor is critical to the accurate prediction of both primary
and coupled responses. Complicating factors are that most blades have strongly non-
uniform mass distributions and aerodynamic loadings and any blade deformation will
further effect the ratio of aerodynamic to inertia forces. The concept of the equivalent
Lock number is often used in helicopter ﬂight dynamics to encapsulate a number of
these effects. The degree to which this approach is valid will be discussed later in
Chapter 3.
Hub moments and rotor/fuselage coupling
From the above discussion, we can see the importance of the two key parameters, λβ
and γ , in determining the ﬂapping behaviour and hence hub moment. The hub moments
due to the out-of-plane rotor loads are proportional to the rotor stiffness, as given by
eqns 2.14 and 2.15; these can be written in the form

To this point in the analysis we have described rotor motions with ﬁxed or prescribed
shaft rotations to bring out the partial effects of control effectiveness and ﬂap damping.
We can now extend the analysis to shaft-free motion. To simplify the analysis we
consider only the roll motion and assume that the centre of mass of the rotor and shaft
lies at the hub centre. The motion of the shaft is described by the simple equation
relating the rate of change of angular momentum to the applied moment:
Ixx ˙p = L
(2.35)
where Ixx is the roll moment of inertia of the helicopter. By combining eqn 2.27
with eqn 2.34, the equation describing the 1 DoF roll motion of the helicopter, with
quasi-steady rotor, can be written in the ﬁrst-order differential form of a rate response
type:
˙p −L p p = Lθ1c θ1c
(2.36)
where the rolling moment ‘derivatives’ are given by
L p ≈−NbSβ Iβ

Lθ1c ≈−NbSβγ Iβ2
16 Ixx
(2.37)
where the approximation that S2
β << 1 has been made. Non-dimensionalizing by the
roll moment of inertia Ixx transforms these into angular acceleration derivatives.
These are the most primitive forms of the roll damping and cyclic control deriva-
tives for a helicopter, but they contain most of the ﬁrst-order effects, as will be observed
later in Chapters 4 and 5. The solution to eqn 2.36 is a simple exponential transient

takes the form

The time constant (time to reach 63% of steady state) of the motion, τρ, is given by
−(1/L p), the control sensitivity (initial acceleration) by Lθ1c and the rate sensitivity
(steady-state rate response per degree of cyclic) by
pss(deg/(s deg)) = −Lθ1c
L p

(2.39)
These are the three handling qualities parameters associated with the time response of
eqn 2.36, and Fig. 2.22 illustrates the effects of the primary rotor parameters. The ﬁxed
parameters for this test case are  = 35 rad/s, Nb = 4, Iβ/Ixx = 0.25.
Four points are worth highlighting:
(1) contrary to ‘popular’ understanding, the steady-state roll rate response to a step lateral
cyclic is independent of rotor ﬂapping stiffness; teetering and hingeless rotors have
effectively the same rate sensitivity;
(2) the rate sensitivity varies linearly with Lock number;
(3) both control sensitivity and damping increase linearly with rotor stiffness;
(4) the response time constant is inversely proportional to rotor stiffness.
These points are further brought out in the generalized sketches in Figs 2.23(a) and
(b), illustrating the ﬁrst-order time response in roll rate from a step lateral cyclic input.
These time response characteristics were used to describe short-term handling qualities
until the early 1980s when the revision to Mil Spec 8501A (Ref. 2.2) introduced the
frequency domain as a more meaningful format, at least for non-classical short-term
response. One of the reasons for this is that the approximation of quasi-steady ﬂapping
motion begins to break down when the separation between the frequency of rotor ﬂap
modes and fuselage attitude modes decreases. The full derivation of the equations of
ﬂap motion will be covered in Chapter 3, but to complete this analysis of rotor/fuselage

coupling in hover, we shall brieﬂy examine the next, improved, level of approximation.
Equations 2.40 and 2.41 describe the coupled motion when only ﬁrst-order lateral
ﬂapping (the so-called ﬂap regressive mode) and fuselage roll are considered. The
other rotor modes – the coning and advancing ﬂap mode – and coupling into pitch, are
neglected at this stage.

The roots of eqn 2.44 can be approximated by the ‘uncoupled’ values only for small

variation of the exact and uncoupled approximate roots with (λ2

γ = 8. The approximation of quasi-steady rotor behaviour will be valid for small offset
articulated rotors and soft bearingless designs, but for hingeless rotors with λ2
β much
above 1.1, the fuselage response is fast enough to be inﬂuenced by the rotor transient
response, and the resultant motion is a coupled roll/ﬂap oscillation. Note again that the
rotor disc time constant is independent of stiffness and is a function only of rotorspeed
and Lock number (eqn 2.43).

Linearization in general
The assumptions made to establish the above approximate results have not been dis-
cussed; we have neglected detailed blade aerodynamic and deformation effects and we
have assumed the rotorspeed to be constant; these are important effects that will need
to be considered later in Chapter 3, but would have detracted from the main points
we have tried to establish in the foregoing analysis. One of these is the concept of the
motion derivative, or partial change in the rotor forces and moments with rotor motion.
If the rotor were an entirely linear system, then the total force and moment could be
formulated as the sum of individual effects each written as a derivative times a motion.
This approach, which will normally be valid for small enough motion, has been
established in both ﬁxed- and rotary-wing ﬂight dynamics since the early days of ﬂying
(Ref. 2.13) and enables the stability characteristics of an aircraft to be determined.
The assumption is made that the aerodynamic forces and moments can be expressed
as a multi-dimensional analytic function of the motion of the aircraft about the trim
condition; hence the rolling moment, for example, can be written as
L = Ltrim + ∂L
∂u u + ∂2L
∂u2 u2 + · · · + ∂L
∂v v + · · · + ∂L
∂w w + · · · + ∂L
∂p p + · · · + ∂L
∂q q
+ terms due to higher motion derivatives (e.g., ˙p) and controls
(2.45)
For small motions, the linear terms will normally dominate and the approximation can
be written in the form
L = Ltrim + Luu + Lvv + Lww + L p p + Lqq + Lrr
+ acceleration and control terms
(2.46)
In this 6 DoF approximation, each component of the helicopter will contribute to
each derivative; hence, for example, there will be an Xu and an Np for the rotor,
fuselage, empennage and even the tail rotor, although many of these components, while
dominating some derivatives, will have a negligible contribution to others. Dynamic

effects beyond the motion in the six rigid-body DoFs will be folded into the latter in
quasi-steadyform,e.g.,rotor,airmassdynamicsandengine/transmission.Forexample,
if the rotor DoFs were represented by the vector xr and the fuselage by xr, then the
linearized, coupled equations can be written in the form

We have included, for completeness, fuselage and rotor controls. Folding the rotor DoFs
into the fuselage as quasi-steady motions will be valid if the characteristic frequencies
of the two elements are widely separate and the resultant approximation for the fuselage
motion can then be written as

In the above, we have employed the weakly coupled approximation theory of Milne
(Ref. 2.14), an approach used extensively in Chapters 4 and 5. The technique will serve
us well in reducing and hence isolating the dynamics to single DoFs in some cases,
hence maximizing the potential physical insight gained from such analysis. The real
strength in linearization comes from the ability to derive stability properties of the
dynamic motions.
Stability and control résumé
This Tour would be incomplete without a short discussion on ‘stability and control
derivatives’ and a description of typical helicopter stability characteristics. To do this
we need to introduce the helicopter model conﬁgurations we shall be working with
in this book and some basic principles of building the aircraft equations of motion.
The three baseline simulation conﬁgurations are described in Appendix 4B and rep-
resent the Aerospatiale (ECF) SA330 Puma, Westland Lynx and MBB (ECD) Bo105
helicopters. The Puma is a transport helicopter in the 6-ton class, the Lynx is a utility
transport/anti-armour helicopter in the 4-ton class and the Bo105 is a light utility/anti-
armour helicopter in the 2.5-ton class. Both the Puma and Bo105 operate in civil and
military variants throughout the world; the military Lynx operates with both land and
sea forces throughout the world. All three helicopters were designed in the 1960s and
have been continuously improved in a series of new Marks since that time. The Bo105
and Lynx were the ﬁrst hingeless rotor helicopters to enter production and service.
On these aircraft, both ﬂap and lead–lag blade motion are achieved through elastic
bending, with blade pitch varied through rotations at a bearing near the blade root. On
the Puma, the blade ﬂap and lead–lag motions largely occur through articulation with
the hinges close to the hub centre. The distance of the hinges from the hub centre is a
critical parameter in determining the magnitude of the hub moment induced by blade
ﬂapping and lagging; the moments are approximately proportional to the hinge offset,
up to values of about 10% of the blade radius. Typical values of the ﬂap hinge offset are
found between 3 and 5% of the blade radius. Hingeless rotors are often quoted as hav-
ing an effective hinge offset, to describe their moment-producing capability, compared
with articulated rotor helicopters. The Puma has a ﬂap hinge offset of 3.8%, while the
Lynx and Bo105 have effective offsets of about 12.5 and 14% respectively. We can
expect the moment capability of the two hingeless rotor aircraft to be about three times

43
that of the Puma. This translates into higher values of λβ and Sβ, and hence higher
rotor moment derivatives with respect to all variables, not only rates and controls as
described in the above analysis.
The simulation model of the three aircraft will be described in Chapter 3 and is
based on the DRA Helisim model (Ref. 2.15). The model is generic in form, with two
input ﬁles, one describing the aircraft conﬁguration data (e.g., geometry, mass proper-
ties, aerodynamic and structural characteristics, control system parameters), the other
the ﬂight condition parameters (e.g., airspeed, climb/descent rate, sideslip and turn rate)
and atmospheric conditions. The datasets for the three Helisim aircraft are located in
Chapter 4, Section 4B.1, while Section 4B.2 contains charts of the stability and control
derivatives. The derivatives are computed using a numerical perturbation technique
applied to the full nonlinear equations of motion and are not generally derived in
explicit analytic form. Chapters 3 and 4 will include some analytic formulations to
illustrate the physics at work; it should be possible to gain insight into the primary
aerodynamic effects for all the important derivatives in this way. The static stability
derivative Mw is a good example and allows us to highlight some of the differences
between ﬁxed- and rotary-wing aircraft.
The static stability derivative Mw
In simple physical terms the derivative Mw represents the change in pitching moment
about the aircraft’s centre of mass when the aircraft is subjected to a perturbation in
normal velocity w or, effectively, incidence. If the perturbation leads to a positive,
pitch-up, moment, then Mw is positive and the aircraft is said to be statically unstable
in pitch; if Mw is negative then the aircraft is statically stable. Static stability refers
to the initial tendency only and the Mw effect is analogous to the spring in a sim-
ple spring/mass/damper dynamic system. In ﬁxed-wing aircraft ﬂight dynamics, the
derivative is proportional to the distance between the aircraft’s centre of mass and the
overall aerodynamic centre, i.e., the point about which the resultant lift force acts when
the incidence is changed. This distance metric, in normalized form referred to as the
static margin, does not carry directly across to helicopters, because as the incidence
changes, not only does the aerodynamic lift on the rotor change, but it also rotates (as
the rotor disc tilts). So, while we can consider an effective staﬁc margin for helicopters,
this is not commonly used because the parameter is very conﬁguration dependent and
is also a function of perturbation amplitude. There is another reason why the static mar-
gin concept has not been adopted in helicopter ﬂight dynamics. Prior to the deliberate
design of ﬁxed-wing aircraft with negative static margins to improve performance,
fundamental conﬁguration and layout parameters were deﬁned to achieve a positive
static margin. Most helicopters are inherently unstable in pitch and very little can be
achieved with layout and conﬁguration parameters to change this, other than through
the stabilizing effect of a large tailplane at high-speed (e.g., UH-60). When the rotor is
subjected to a positive incidence change in forward ﬂight, the advancing blade expe-
riences a greater lift increment than does the retreating blade (see Fig. 2.25). The 90◦
phase shift in response means that the rotor disc ﬂaps back and cones up and hence
applies a positive pitching moment to the aircraft. The rotor contribution to Mw will
tend to increase with forward speed; the contributions from the fuselage and horizontal
stabilizer will also increase with airspeed but tend to cancel each other, leaving the
rotor contribution as the primary contribution. Figure 2.26 illustrates the variation in
Mw for the three baseline aircraft in forward ﬂight. The effect of the hingeless rotors
on Mw is quite striking, leading to large destabilizing moments at high speed. It is

vertical gust

and Puma
interesting to consider the effect of this static instability on the dynamic, or longer
term, stability of the aircraft.
A standard approximation to the short-term dynamic response of a ﬁxed-wing
aircraft can be derived by considering the coupled pitch/heave motions, assuming
that the airspeed is constant. This is a gross approximation for helicopters but can be
used to approximate high-speed ﬂight in certain circumstances (Ref. 2.16). Figure 2.27
illustratesgeneralizedlongitudinalmotion,distinguishingbetweenpitchandincidence.
For the present, we postulate that the assumption of constant speed applies, and that the
perturbations in heave velocity w, and pitch rate q, can be described by the linearized
equations:
Iyy ˙q = δM
Ma ˙w = MaUeq + δZ
(2.49)

Fig. 2.27 Constant pitch and heave motions
where Iyy is the pitch moment of inertia of the helicopter about the reference axes and
Ma is the mass. Ue is the trim or equilibrium forward velocity and δZ and δM are the
perturbation Z force and pitching moment. Expanding the perturbed force and moment
into derivative form, we can write the perturbation equations of motion in matrix form:

(2.50)
The derivatives Zw, Mq, etc., correspond to the linear terms in the expansion of the
normal force and pitch moment, as described in eqn 2.45. It is more convenient to
discuss these derivatives in semi-normalized form, and we therefore write these in eqn
2.50, and throughout the book, without any distinguishing dressings, as
Mw ≡Mw
Iyy
,
Zw ≡Zw
Ma
,
etc.
(2.51)
The solution to eqn 2.50 is given by a combination of transient and steady-state com-
ponents, the former having an exponential character, with the exponents, the stability
discriminants, as the solutions to the characteristic equation
λ2 −(Zw + Mq)λ + Zw Mq −Mw(Zq + Ue) = 0
(2.52)
According to eqn 2.52, when the static stability derivative Mw is zero, then the pitch
and heave motions are uncoupled giving two ﬁrst-order transients (decay rates given
by Zw and Mq). As Mw becomes increasingly positive, the aircraft will not experience
dynamic instability until the manoeuvre margin, the stiffness term in eqn 2.52, becomes
zero. Long before this however, the above approximation breaks down.
One of the chief reasons why this short period approximation has a limited appli-
cation range with helicopters is the strong coupling with speed variations, reﬂected in
the speed derivatives, particularly Mu. This speed stability derivative is normally zero
for ﬁxed-wing aircraft at subsonic speeds, on account of the moments from all aerody-
namic surfaces being proportional to dynamic pressure and hence perturbations tend
to cancel one another. For the helicopter, the derivative Mu is signiﬁcant even in the
hover, again caused by differential effects on advancing and retreating blades leading
to ﬂapback; so while this positive derivative can be described as statically stable, it

 
46
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
actually contributes to the dynamic instability of the pitch phugoid. This effect will be
further explored in Chapter 4, along with the second reason why low-order approxima-
tions are less widely applicable for helicopters, namely cross-coupling. Practically all
helicopter motions are coupled, but some couplings are more signiﬁcant than others,
in terms of their effect on the direct response on the one hand, and the degree of pilot
off-axis compensation required, on the other.
Alongside the fundamentals of ﬂapping, the rotor thrust and torque response to
normal velocity changes are key rotor aeromechanics effects that need some attention
on this Tour.

(2.54)
Again, we have assumed that the induced downwash λi is constant over the rotor disc;
µz is the normal velocity of the rotor, positive down and approximates to the aircraft
velocity component w. Before we can calculate the vertical damping derivative Zw, we
need an expression for the uniform downwash. The induced rotor downwash is one of
the most important individual components of helicopter ﬂight dynamics; it can also be
the most complex. The downwash, representing the discharged energy from the lifting
rotor, actually takes the form of a spiralling vortex wake with velocities that vary in
space and time. We shall give a more comprehensive treatment in Chapter 3, but in
this introduction to the topic we make some major simpliﬁcations. Assuming that the
rotor takes the form of an actuator disc (Ref. 2.17) supporting a pressure change and
accelerating the air mass, the induced velocity can be derived by equating the work
done by the integrated pressures with the change in air-mass momentum. The hover
downwash over the rotor disc can then be written as

(2.56)
The rotor thrust coefﬁcient CT will typically vary between 0.005 and 0.01 for heli-
copters in 1 g ﬂight, depending on the tip speed, density altitude and aircraft weight.
Hover downwash λi then varies between 0.05 and 0.07. The physical downwash is

 
An Introductory Tour
47
proportional to the square root of the rotor disc loading, Ld, and at sea level is given
by
vihover = 14.5√Ld
(2.57)
For low disc loading rotors (Ld = 6 1b/ft2, 280 N/m2), the downwash is about 35 ft/s
(10 m/s); for high disc loading rotors (Ld = 12 lb/ft2, 560 N/m2), the downwash rises
to over 50 ft/s (15 m/s).
The simple momentum considerations that led to eqn 2.55 can be extended to the
energy and hence power required in the hover
Pi = T vi =
T 3/2
√(2ρ Ad)
(2.58)
The subscript i refers to the induced power which accounts for about 70% of the power
required in hover; for a 10000-lb (4540 kg) helicopter developing a downwash of 40
ft/s (typical of a Lynx), the induced power comes to nearly 730 HP (545 kW).
Equations 2.54 and 2.56 can be used to derive the heave damping derivative

and hence
Zw = −2a0 Abρ(R)λi
(16λi + a0s)Ma
(2.61)
where Ab is the blade area and s the solidity, or ratio of blade area to disc area. For
our reference Helisim Lynx conﬁguration, the value of Zw is about −0.33/s in hover,
giving a heave motion time constant of about 3 s (rise time to 63% of steady state). This
is typical of heave time constants for most helicopters in hover. With such a long time
constant, the vertical response would seem more like an acceleration than a velocity
type to the pilot. The response to vertical gusts, wg, can be derived from the ﬁrst-order
approximation to the heave dynamics
dw
dt −Zww = Zwwg
(2.62)
The initial acceleration response to a sharp-edge vertical gust provides a useful measure
of the ride qualities of the helicopter, in terms of vertical bumpiness
dw
dt t=0 = Zwwg
(2.63)
A gust of magnitude 30 ft/s (10 m/s) would therefore produce an acceleration bump in
Helisim Lynx of about 0.3 g. Additional effects such as the blade ﬂapping, downwash
lag and rotor penetration will modify the response. Vertical gusts of this magnitude

 
48
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
are rare in the hovering regime close to the ground, and, generally speaking, the low
values of Zw and the typical gust strengths make the vertical gust response in hovering
ﬂight fairly insigniﬁcant. There are some important exceptions to this general result,
e.g., helicopters operating close to structures or obstacles with large downdrafts (e.g.,
approaching oil rigs), that make the vertical performance and handling qualities, such
as power margin and heave sensitivity, particularly critical. We shall return to gust
response as a special topic in Chapter 5.
Gust response in forward ﬂight
A similar analysis can be conducted for the rotor in forward ﬂight, leading to the
following set of approximate equations for the induced downwash and heave damping;

(2.68)
The key parameter is again blade/wing loading. The factor in parenthesis in eqn 2.67
indicates that the helicopter heave damping or gust response parameter ﬂattens off
at high-speed while the ﬁxed-wing gust sensitivity continues to increase linearly. At
lower speeds, the rotary-wing factor in eqn 2.67 increases to greater than one. Typical
values of lift curve slope for a helicopter blade can be as much as 50% higher than
a moderate aspect-ratio aeroplane wing. It would seem therefore that all else being
equal, the helicopter will be more sensitive to gusts at low-speed. In reality, typical
blade loadings are considerably higher than wing loadings for the same aircraft weight;
values of 100 lb/ft2 (4800 N/m2) are typical for helicopters, while ﬁxed-wing executive
transports have wing loadings around 40 lb/ft2 (1900 N/m2). Military jets have higher
wing loadings, up to 70 lb/ft2 (3350 N/m2) for an aircraft like the Harrier, but this is
still quite a bit lower than typical blade loadings. Figure 2.28 shows a comparison of
heave damping for our Helisim Puma helicopter (a0 = 6, blade area = 144 ft2 (13.4
m2)) with a similar class of ﬁxed-wing transport (a0 = 4, wing area = 350 ft2 (32.6

aircraft has been extended to zero speed, the Puma point corresponding to the value

Fig. 2.28 Variation of heave damping, Zw, with airspeed for rotary- and ﬁxed-wing aircraft
of Zw given by eqn 2.61. The helicopter is seen to be more sensitive to gusts below
about 50 m/s (150 ft/s); above this speed, the helicopter value remains constant, while
the aeroplane response continues to increase. Three points are worth developing about
this result for the helicopter:
(1) The alleviation due to blade ﬂapping is often cited as a major cause of the lower gust
sensitivity of helicopters. In fact, this effect is fairly insigniﬁcant as far as the vertical
gust response is concerned. The rotor coning response, which determines the way that
the vertical load is transmitted to the fuselage, reaches its steady state very quickly,
typically in about 100 ms. While this delay will take the edge off a truly sharp gust, in
reality, the gust front is usually of ramp form, extending over several of the blade
response time constants.
(2) The Zw derivative reﬂects the initial response only; a full assessment of ride qualities
will need to take into account the short-term transient response of the helicopter and,
of course, the shape of the gust. We shall see later in Chapter 5 that there is a key
relationship between gust shape and aircraft short-term response that leads to the
concept of the worst case gust, when there is ‘tuning’ or ‘resonance’ between the
aircraft response and the gust scale/amplitude.
(3) The third point concerns the insensitivity of the response with speed for the helicopter
at higher speeds. It is not obvious why this should be the case, but the result is clearly
connected with the rotation of the rotor. To explore this point further, it will help to
revisit the thrust equation, thus exploiting the modelling approach to the full:

where
U T ≈r + µ sin ψ,
UP = µz −λi −µβ cos ψ −rβ′
(2.70)
The vertical gust response stems from the product of velocities UP U T in eqn 2.69.
It can be seen from eqn 2.70 that the forward velocity term in U T varies one-per-rev,
therefore contributing nothing to the quasi-steady hub loading. The most signiﬁcant
contribution to the gust response in the fuselage comes through as an Nb-per-rev
vibration superimposed on the steady component represented by the derivative Zw.
The ride bumpiness of a helicopter therefore has quite a different character from that
of a ﬁxed-wing aircraft where the lift component proportional to velocity dominates
the response.
Vector-differential form of equations of motion
Returning now to the general linear problem, we shall ﬁnd it convenient to use the
vector–matrix shorthand form of the equations of motion, written in the form
dx
dt −Ax = Bu + f(t)
(2.71)
where
x = {u, w, q, θ, v, p, φ,r, ψ}
A and B are the matrices of stability and control derivatives, and we have included a
forcing function f(t) to represent external disturbances, e.g., gusts. Equation 2.71 is a
linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients that has an exact solution with
analytic form
x(t) = Y(t) x(0) +
t

Y(t −τ) (Bu + f(τ)) dτ
Y(t) = 0,
t < 0
Y(t) = U diag[exp(λit)]U−1,
t ≥0
(2.72)
The response behaviour is uniquely determined by the principal matrix solution Y(t)
(Ref. 2.18), which is itself derived from the eigenvalues λi and eigenvectors ui (ar-
ranged as columns in the matrix U) of the matrix A. The stability of small motions about
the trim condition is determined by the real parts of the eigenvalues and the complete
response to controls u or disturbances f is a linear combination of the eigenvectors.
Figures 2.29(a) and (b) show how the eigenvalues for the Helisim Lynx and Helisim
Puma conﬁgurations vary with speed from hover to 160 knots; at the higher speeds, the
conventional ﬁxed-wing parlance for naming the modes associated with the eigenval-
ues is appropriate. The pitch instability at high speed for the hingeless rotor Helisim
Lynx has already been discussed in terms of the loss of manoeuvre stability. At lower
speeds the modes change character, until at the hover they take on shapes peculiar to
the helicopter, e.g., heave/yaw oscillation, pitch/roll pendulum mode. The heave/yaw
mode tends to be coupled, due to the fuselage yaw reaction to changes in rotor torque,
induced by perturbations in the rotor heave/inﬂow velocity. The eigenvectors represent
the mode shapes, or the ratio of the response contributions in the various DoFs. The

51
Fig. 2.29 (a) Variation of Lynx eigenvalues with forward speed; (b) variation of Puma
eigenvalues with forward speed
modes are linearly independent, meaning that no one can be made up as a collection of
the others. If the initial conditions, control inputs or gust disturbance have their energy
distributed throughout the DoFs with the same ratio as a particular eigenvector, then
the response will be restricted to that mode only. More discussion on the physics of
the modes can be found in Chapter 4.
The key value of the linearized equations of motion is in the analysis of stability;
they also form the basic model for control system design. Both uses draw on the
considerable range of mathematical techniques developed for linear systems analysis.
We shall return to these later in Chapters 4 and 5, but we need to say a little more
about the two inherently nonlinear problems of ﬂight mechanics – trim and response.

 
52
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.30 Variation of trim control angles with forward speed for Puma
The former is obtained as the solution to the algebraic eqn 2.2 and generally takes the
form of the controls required to hold a steady ﬂight condition. The general form of
control variations with forward speed is illustrated in Fig. 2.30. The longitudinal cyclic
moves forward as speed increases to counteract the ﬂapback caused by forward speed
effects (Mu effect). The lateral cyclic has to compensate for the rolling moment due
to the tail rotor thrust and also the lateral ﬂapping induced in response to coning and
longitudinal variations in rotor inﬂow. The collective follows the shape of the power
required, decreasing to the minimum power speed at around 70 knots then increasing
again sharply at higher speeds. The tail rotor collective follows the general shape of
the main rotor collective; at high-speed the pedal required decreases as some of the
anti-torque yawing moment is typically produced by the vertical stabilizer.
While it is true that the response problem is inherently nonlinear, it is also true
that for small perturbations, the linearized equations developed for stability analysis
can be used to predict the dynamic behaviour. Figure 2.31 illustrates and compares the
pitch response of the Helisim Lynx ﬁtted with a standard and soft rotor as a function
of control input size; the response is normalized by the input size to indicate the
degree of nonlinearity present. Also shown in the ﬁgure is the normal acceleration
response; clearly, for the larger inputs the assumptions of constant speed implicit in
any linearization would break down for the standard stiffer rotor. Also the rotor thrust
would have changed signiﬁcantly in the manoeuvre and, together with the larger speed
excursions for the stiffer rotor, produce the nonlinear response shown.
Validation
Howwellatheoreticalsimulationneedstomodelthehelicopterbehaviourdependsvery
much on the application; in the simulation world the measure of quality is described
as the ﬁdelity or validation level. Fidelity is normally judged by comparison with test
data, both model and full scale. The validation process can be described in terms of
two kinds of ﬁdelity–functional and physical (Ref. 2.19), deﬁned as follows:

 
An Introductory Tour
53
Fig. 2.31 Nonlinear pitch response for Lynx at 100 knots
Functional ﬁdelity is the level of ﬁdelity of the overall model to achieve compliance
with some functional requirement, e.g., for our application, can the model be used
to predict ﬂying qualities parameters?
Physical ﬁdelity is the level of ﬁdelity of the individual modelling assumptions in the
model components, in terms of their ability to represent the underlying physics,
e.g., does the rotor aerodynamic inﬂow formulation capture the ﬂuid mechanics of
the wake correctly?
It is convenient and also useful to distinguish between these two approaches because
they focus attention on the two ends of the problem – have we modelled the physics
correctly and does the pilot perceive that the simulation ‘feels’ right? It might be
imagined that the one would follow from the other and while this is true to an extent,
it is also true that simulation models will continue to be characterized by a collection
of aerodynamic and structural approximations, patched together and each correct over
a limited range, for the foreseeable future. It is also something of a paradox that
the conceptual product of complexity and physical understanding can effectively be
constant in simulation. The more complex the model becomes, then while the model
ﬁdelity may be increasing, the ability to interpret cause and effect and hence gain
physical understanding of the model behaviour diminishes. Against this stands the
argument that, in general, only through adding complexity can ﬁdelity be improved.
A general rule of thumb is that the model needs to be only as complex as the ﬁdelity
requirements dictate; improvements beyond this are generally not cost-effective. The
problem is that we typically do not know how far to go at the initial stages of a model

Helicopter Flight Dynamics
development, and we need to be guided by the results of validation studies reported
in the literature. The last few years have seen a surge of activity in this research area,
with the techniques of system identiﬁcation underpinning practically all the progress
(Refs 2.20–2.22). System identiﬁcation is essentially a process of reconstructing a
simulation model structure and associated parameters from experimental data. The
techniques range from simple curve ﬁtting to complex statistical error analysis, but
have been used in aeronautics in various guises from the early days of data analysis
(see the work of Shinbrot in Ref. 2.23). The helicopter presents special problems to
system identiﬁcation, but these are nowadays fairly well understood, if not always
accounted for, and recent experience has made these techniques much more accessible
to the helicopter ﬂight dynamicist.
An example illustrating the essence of system identiﬁcation can be drawn from
the roll response dynamics described earlier in this chapter; if we assume the ﬁrst-order
model structure, then the equation of motion and measurement equation take the form
˙p −L p p = Lθ1c θ1c + εp
p = f (pm) + εm
(2.73)
The second equation is included to show that in most cases, we shall be considering
problems where the variable or state of interest is not the same as that measured;
there will generally be some measurement error function εm and some calibration
function f involved. Also, the equation of motion will not fully model the situation
and we introduce the process error function εp. Ironically, it is the estimation of the
characteristics of these error or noise functions that has motivated the development of
a signiﬁcant amount of the system identiﬁcation methodology.
The solution for roll rate can be written in either a form suitable for forward
(numerical) integration
p = p0 +
t
0
(L p p(τ) + Lθ1cθ1c(τ)) dτ
(2.74)
or an analytic form
p = p0eL pt +
t
0
eL p(t−τ)Lθ1cθ1c(τ) dτ
(2.75)
The identiﬁcation problem associated with eqns 2.73 becomes, ‘from ﬂight test mea-
surements of roll rate response to a measured lateral cyclic input, estimate values of
the damping and control sensitivity derivatives L p and Lθ1c’. In starting at this point,
we are actually skipping over two of the three subprocesses of system identiﬁcation
– state estimation and model structure estimation, processes that aim to quantify bet-
ter the measurement and process noise. There are two general approaches to solving
the identiﬁcation problem – equation error and output error. With the equation error
method, we work with the ﬁrst equation of 2.73, but we need measurements of both
roll rate and roll acceleration, and rewrite the equation in the form
˙pe = L p pm + Lθ1c θ1cm
(2.76)

 
An Introductory Tour
55
Fig. 2.32 Equation error identiﬁcation process
Subscripts m and e denote measurements and estimated states respectively. The identi-
ﬁcation process now involves achieving the best ﬁt between the estimated roll acceler-
ation ˙pe from eqn 2.76 and the measured roll acceleration ˙pm, varying the parameters
L p and Lθ1c to achieve the ﬁt (Fig. 2.32). Equation 2.76 will yield one-ﬁt equation for
each measurement point, and hence with n measurement times we have two unknowns
and n equations – the classic overdetermined problem. In matrix form, the n equations
can be combined in the form
x = By + ε
(2.77)
where x is the vector of acceleration measurements, B is the (n × 2) matrix of roll rate
and lateral cyclic measurements and y is the vector of unknown derivatives L p and
Lθ1c; ε is the error vector function. Equation 2.77 cannot be inverted in the conventional
manner because the matrix B is not square. However, a pseudo-inverse can be deﬁned
that will provide the so-called least-squares solution to the ﬁtting process, i.e., the error
function is minimized so that the sum of the squares of the error between, measured
and estimated acceleration is minimized over a deﬁned time interval. The least-squares
solution is given by
y = (BTB)−1BTx
(2.78)
Provided that the errors are randomly distributed with a normal distribution and zero
mean, the derivatives so estimated from eqn 2.78 will be unbiased and have high
conﬁdence factors.
The second approach to system identiﬁcation is the output error method, where
the starting equation is the solution or ‘output’ of the equation of motion. In the present
example, either the analytic (eqn 2.74) or numerical (eqn 2.73) solution can be used;
it is usually more convenient to work with the latter, giving the estimated roll rate in
this case as
pe = p0m +
t
0
(L p pm(τ) + Lθ1cθ1cm(τ)) dτ
(2.79)

 
56
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.33 Output error identiﬁcation process
The error function is then formed from the difference between the measured and
estimated roll rate, which can once again be minimized in a least-squares sense across
the time history to yield the best estimates of the damping and control derivatives
(Fig. 2.33).
Provided that the model structures are correct, the processes we have described
will always yield ‘good’ derivative estimates in the absence of ‘noise’, assuming that
enough measurements are available to cover the frequencies of interest; in fact, the two
methods are equivalent in this simple case. Most identiﬁcation work with simulated
data falls into this category, and new variants of the two basic methods are often tested
with simulation data prior to being applied to test data. Without contamination with a
realistic level of noise, simulation data can give a very misleading impression of the
robustness level of system identiﬁcation methods applied to helicopters. Expanding on
the above, we can classify noise into two sources for the purposes of the discussion:
(1) measurement noise, appearing on the measured signals;
(2) process noise, appearing on the response outputs, reﬂecting unmodelled effects.
It can be shown (Ref. 2.24, Klein) that results from equation error methods are suscep-
tible to measurement noise, while those from output error analysis suffer from process
noise. Both can go terribly wrong if the error sources are deterministic and cannot
therefore be modelled as random noise. An approach that purports to account for both
error sources is the so-called maximum likelihood technique, whereby the output error
method is used in conjunction with a ﬁltering process, that calculates the error functions
iteratively with the model parameters.
Identifying stability and control derivatives from ﬂight test data can be used to
provide accurate linear models for control law design or in the estimation of handling
qualities parameters. Our principal interest in this Tour is the application to simulation
model validation. How can we use the estimated parameters to quantify the levels
of modelling ﬁdelity? The difﬁculty is that the estimated parameters are made up
of contributions from many different elements, e.g., main rotor and empennage, and
the process of isolating the source of a deﬁcient force or moment prediction is not
obvious. Two approaches to tackling this problem are described in Ref. 2.25; one
where the model parameters are physically based and where the modelling element
of interest is isolated from the other components through prescribed dynamics – the

 
An Introductory Tour
57
so-called open-loop or constrained method. The second method involves establishing
the relationship between the derivatives and the physical rotorcraft parameters, hence
enabling the degree of distortion of the physical parameters required to match the test
data. Both these methods are useful and have been used in several different applications
over the last few years.
Large parameter distortions most commonly result from one of two sources in
helicopter ﬂight dynamics, both related to model structure deﬁciencies – missing DoFs
or missing nonlinearities, or a combination of both. A certain degree of model structure
mismatch will always be present and will be reﬂected in the conﬁdence values in
the estimated parameters. Large errors can, however, lead to unrealistic values of
some parameters that are effectively being used to compensate for the missing parts.
Knowing when this is happening in a particular application is part of the ‘art’ of system
identiﬁcation. One of the keys to success involves designing an appropriate test input
that ensures that the model structure of interest remains valid in terms of frequency
and amplitude, bringing us back to the two characteristic dimensions of modelling. A
relatively new technique that has considerable potential in this area is the method of
inverse simulation.
Inverse simulation
The process of validation and ﬁdelity assessment is concerned ultimately with under-
standing the accuracy and range of application of the various assumptions distributed
throughout the modelling. At the heart of this lies the prediction of the external forces
and moments, particularly the aerodynamic loads. One of the problems with direct or
forward simulation, where the simulation model is driven by prescribed control inputs
and the motion time histories derived from the integration of the forces and moments,
is that the comparisons of simulation and ﬂight can very quickly depart with even the
smallest modelling errors. The value of the comparison in providing validation insight
then becomes very dubious, as the simulation and ﬂight are soon engaged in very dif-
ferent manoeuvres. The concept behind inverse simulation is to prescribe, using ﬂight
test data, the motion of the helicopter in the simulation and hence derive the required
forces and moments for comparison with those predicted by theory. One form of the
process can be conceived in closed-loop form with the error between the model and
ﬂight forming the function to be minimized by a feedback controller (Fig. 2.34). If we
assume that the model structure is linear with n DoFs x, for which we also have ﬂight

measurements xm, then the process can be written as
dx
dt −Ax = B(u + u∗)
(2.80)
u∗= k(x −xm)
(2.81)
The modelling errors have been embodied into a dummy control variable u∗in eqns
2.80 and 2.81. The gain matrix k can be determined using a variety of minimization
algorithms to achieve the optimum match between ﬂight and theory; the example given
in Ref. 2.26 uses the conventional quadratic least-squares performance index
PI =

(x −xm)TR(x −xm) dt
(2.82)
The elements of the weighting matrix R can be selected to achieve distributed ﬁts
over the different motion variables. The method is actually a special form of system
identiﬁcation, with the unmodelled effects being estimated as effective controls. The
latter can then be converted into residual forces and moments that can be analysed
to describe the unmodelled loads or DoFs. A special form of the inverse simulation
method that has received greatest attention (Refs 2.27, 2.28) corresponds to the case
where the feedback control in Fig. 2.34 and eqn 2.81 has inﬁnite gain. Effectively, four
of the helicopter’s DoFs can now be prescribed exactly, and the remaining DoFs and the
four controls are then estimated. The technique was originally developed to provide an
assessment tool for ﬂying qualities; the kinematics of MTEs could be prescribed and
the ability of different aircraft conﬁgurations to ﬂy through the manoeuvres compared
(Ref. 2.29). Later, the technique was used to support validation work and has now
become fairly well established (Ref. 2.26).
Modelling review
Assuming that the reader has made it this far, he or she may feel somewhat daunted at
the scale of the modelling task described on this Tour; if so, then Chapters 3, 4 and 5
will offer little respite, as the subject becomes even deeper and broader. If, on the other
hand, the reader is motivated by this facet of ﬂight dynamics, then the later chapters
should bring further delights, as well as the tools and knowledge that are essential for
practising the ﬂight dynamics discipline. The modelling activity has been conveniently
characterized in terms of frequency and amplitude; we refer back to Fig. 2.14 for setting
the framework and highlight again the merging with the loads and vibration disciplines.
Later chapters will discuss this overlap in greater detail, emphasizing that while there
is a conceptual boundary deﬁned by the pilot-controllable frequencies, in practice the
problems actually begin to overlap at the edges of the ﬂight envelope and where high
gain active control is employed.
Much of the ground covered in this part of the Tour has utilized analytic approx-
imations to aircraft and rotor dynamics; this approach is always required to provide
physical insight and will be employed to a great extent in the later modelling chapters.
The general approach will be to search among the coupled-interacting components for
combinations of motion that are, in some sense, weakly coupled; if they can be found,
there lies the key to analytic approximations. However, we cannot escape the complex-
ity of both the aerodynamic and structural modelling, and Chapter 3 will formulate

 
An Introductory Tour
59
expressions for the loads from ﬁrst principles; analytic approximations can then be val-
idated against the more comprehensive theories to establish their range of application.
With today’s computing performance and new functionality, the approach to modelling
is developing rapidly. For example, there are now far more papers published that com-
pare numerical rather than analytic results from comprehensive models with test data.
Analytic approximations tend, nowadays, to be a rarity. The comprehensive models
are expected to be more accurate and have higher ﬁdelity, but the cost is sometimes the
loss of physical understanding, and the author is particularly sensitive to this, having
lived through the transition from a previous era, characterized by analytic modelling,
to the present, more numerical one. Chapters 3 and 4 will reﬂect this and will be packed
full with the author’s well-established prejudices.
We have touched on the vast topic of validation and the question of how good a
model has to be. This topic will be revisited in Chapter 5; the answer is actually quite
simple – it depends! The author likens the question, ‘How good is your model?’ to
‘what’s the weather like on Earth?’ It depends on where you are and the time of year,
etc. So while the initial, somewhat defensive answer may be simple, to address the
question seriously is a major task. This book will take a snapshot of the scene in 1995,
but things are moving fast in this ﬁeld, and new validation criteria along with test data
from individual components, all matched to more comprehensive models, are likely to
change the ‘weather’ considerably within the next 5 years.
In the modelling of helicopter ﬂight dynamics, of principal concern are the ﬂying
qualities. The last 10 years has seen extensive development of quality criteria, and the
accurate prediction of the associated handling and ride qualities parameters is now at
the forefront of all functional validation which conveniently leads us to the next stage
of the Tour.
2.4
Flying Qualities
In this book we loosely divide ﬂying qualities into two categories – handling qual-
ities, reﬂecting the aircraft’s behaviour in response to pilot controls, and ride qual-
ities, reﬂecting the response to external disturbances. Agreement on deﬁnitions is
not widespread and we shall return to some of the debating points later in Chapter
6. A most useful deﬁnition of handling qualities has been provided by Cooper and
Harper (Ref 2.30) as ‘those qualities or characteristics of an aircraft that govern the
ease and precision with which a pilot is able to perform the tasks required in sup-
port of an aircraft role’. We shall expand on this deﬁnition later, but as a starting
point it has stood the test of time and is in widespread use today. It is worth elab-
orating on the key words in this deﬁnition. Quantifying an aircraft’s characteristics
or its internal attributes, while complex and selective, can be achieved on a rational
and systematic basis; after all, an aircraft’s response is largely predictable and repeat-
able. Deﬁning a useful task or mission is also relatively straightforward, although we
have to be very careful to recognize the importance of the task performance levels
required. Quantifying the pilot’s abilities is considerably more difﬁcult and elusive.
To this end, the Cooper–Harper pilot subjective rating scale (Ref. 2.30) was intro-
duced and has now achieved almost universal acceptance as a measure of handling
qualities.

 
60
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.35 The Cooper – Harper handling qualities rating scale – summarized form
Pilot opinion
The scale, shown in summarized form in Fig. 2.35, is divided into three ‘levels’; the
crucial discriminators are task performance and pilot workload. Pilot handling quality
ratings (HQR) are given for a particular aircraft conﬁguration, ﬂying a particular task
under particular environmental conditions; these points cannot be overemphasized.
Some projection from the ‘simulated’ experimental test situation to the operational
situation will be required of the test pilot, but extrapolation of handling qualities from
known to new conditions is generally unacceptable, which explains why compliance
testing needs to be comprehensive and can be so time consuming.
The rating scale is structured as a decision tree; requiring the pilot to arrive at his
or her ratings following a sequence of questions/answers, thoughtful considerations
and, possibly, dialogue with the test engineer. A Level 1 aircraft is satisfactory without
improvement, and if this could be achieved throughout the OFE and for all mission
tasks, then there should never be complaints concerning the piloting task. In practice,
there has probably never been an aircraft this good, and Level 2 or even, on occasions,
Level 3 characteristics have been features of operational aircraft. With a Level 2 aircraft,
the pilot can still achieve adequate performance, but has to use moderate to extensive
compensation and, therefore, workload. At the extreme of Level 2 (HQR 6) the mission
is still ﬂyable, but the pilot has little spare capacity for other duties and will not be able to
sustain the ﬂying for extended periods without the dangers that come from fatigue, i.e.,
the attendant safety hazards that follow from the increased risk of pilot error. These
are the penalties of poor ﬂying qualities. Beyond Level 2, the unacceptable should
never be allowed in normal operational states, but this category is needed to describe
the behaviour in emergency conditions associated with ﬂight in severely degraded
atmospheric conditions or following the loss of critical ﬂight systems.

61
Fig. 2.36 Presentation of pilot handling qualities ratings showing variation with task,
environmental or conﬁguration parameter
The dilemma is that while performance targets can be deﬁned on a mission re-
quirement basis, the workload, and hence rating, can vary from pilot to pilot. The need
for several opinions, to overcome the problem of pilot variability, increases the duration
of a test programme and brings with it the need to resolve any strong differences of
opinion. Pilot ratings will then typically be displayed as a mean and range as in Fig.
2.36. The range display is vital, for it shows not only the variability, but also whether the
opinions cross the levels. Half ratings are allowed, except the 3.5 and 6.5 points; these
points are not available when the pilot follows the HQR decision sequence properly
(Fig. 2.35).
Quantifying quality objectively
While pilot-subjective opinion will always be the deciding factor, quantitative crite-
ria are needed as design targets and to enable compliance demonstration throughout
the design and certiﬁcation phases. The most comprehensive set of requirements in
existence is provided by the US Army’s Aeronautical Design Standard for handling
qualities – ADS-33 (Ref. 2.1), which will be referred to regularly throughout this text,
particularly in Chapters 6, 7 and 8. During the initiation of these requirements, it was
recognized that new criteria were urgently needed but could only ever be as valid as
the underlying database from which they were developed. Hoh (Ref. 2.4), the principal
author of ADS-33, commented that key questions needed to be asked of any existing
test data.
(1) Were the data generated with similar manoeuvre precision and aggressiveness
required in current and future operational missions?
(2) Were the data generated with outside visual cues and atmospheric disturbances
relevant to and consistent with current operations?
Most of the existing data at that time (early 1980s) were eliminated when exposed
to the scrutiny of these questions, and the facilities of several NATO countries were
harnessed to support the development of a new and more appropriate database, notably

 
62
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Canada (NAE, Ottawa), Germany (DLR, Braunschweig), UK (DRA Bedford, then
RAE) and, of course, the United States itself, with the activity orchestrated by the US
Army Aeroﬂightdynamics Directorate at the Ames Research Center.
The criteria in ADS-33 have been validated in development and any gaps represent
areas where data are sparse or non-existent. To quote from ADS-33:
The requirements of this speciﬁcation shall be applied in order to assure that no
limitations on ﬂight safety or on the capability to perform intended missions will
result from deﬁciencies in ﬂying qualities.
For ﬂight within the OFE, Level 1 handling qualities are required. Three innovations
in ADS-33 requiring speciﬁcation to ensure Level 1 handling are the mission task
element (MTE), the usable cue environment (UCE) and the response type (e.g., rate
command, attitude hold – RCAH). These can be seen to relate directly to three of the
reference points discussed earlier in this chapter. Referring to Fig. 2.13 we see how,
for slalom and sidestep MTEs, rate command response types are deemed adequate to
provide Level 1 pitch or roll handling qualities for ﬂight in conditions of a UCE 1.
For low-speed operations however, the response type will need upgrading to attitude
command, attitude hold (ACAH) for ﬂight in the degraded visual environment of a
UCE 2, while a translational rate command with position hold (TRCPH) is needed for
ﬂight in the IMC – like UCE 3. The task, the environment and the aircraft dynamics
therefore interact to determine the ﬂying qualities.
Frequency and amplitude – exposing the natural dimensions
At a deeper level the response types themselves can be classiﬁed further in terms
of their frequency and amplitude characteristics, a perspective that we found useful
in the modelling discipline described in the previous stop on this Tour. Figure 2.37
illustrates the structure, with the response classiﬁed into three levels of amplitude
(small, moderate and large) and three frequency ranges, corresponding to long-, mid-
and short-term behaviour. The zero frequency motion is identiﬁed as the trim line. In
recognition of the multitude of cross-couplings inherent to helicopters, we have added
the third dimension on the ﬁgure; to date, the criteria for cross-coupling requirements
are considerably more immature than for the direct response. The boundary curve in the
ﬁgure indicates the limits to practical ﬂying, with higher frequency attitude and ﬂight
path motions restricted to small amplitude, and large amplitude motions restricted to
Fig. 2.37 Frequency and amplitude characterization of aircraft response

63
the lower frequency range. This representation will provide a convenient structure for
developing quantitative response criteria later in Chapter 6.
Typical helicopter characteristics can now be discussed within the framework
of this response-type classiﬁcation. An unstable, low-frequency oscillation involving
changes in speed and height characterizes the mid–long term, small amplitude response
andstabilityofhelicopterpitchmotion.Thismodecantaketheformofamildlyunstable
pendulum-type motion in the hover, to a rapidly divergent ‘phugoid’ oscillation at high
speed. Aircraft design and conﬁguration parameters, e.g., cg location, rotor type and
tailplane design, can have a marked effect on the stability of this mode in forward ﬂight.
At forward cg extremes, the oscillation can stabilize at moderate speeds, whereas with
aft cg loadings for some conﬁgurations, particularly hingeless rotors or helicopters with
small horizontal tailplanes, the oscillation can ‘split’ into two aperiodic divergences at
high speed, with time to double amplitude less than 1 s in severe cases. The mode differs
from the ﬁxed-wing ‘phugoid’ in that speed changes during the climbs and dives induce
pitching moments, which cause signiﬁcant variations in fuselage and rotor incidence
and thrust.
Stability – early surprises compared with aeroplanes
In the early days of helicopter testing, these differences were often a surprise to the
ﬁxed-wing test pilots. Research into helicopter ﬂying qualities at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment goes back to the 1940s when engineers and pilots were getting to grips
with the theory and practice respectively. In these early days of helicopter research,
one of the key concerns was stability, or rather the lack of it. Stewart and Zbrozek
(Ref. 2.31) describe a loss-of-control incident on an S-51 helicopter at RAE in 1948.
Quoting from the pilot’s report in the reference:
When the observer said he was ready with his auto-observer, I pushed the stick
forward about six inches and returned it quickly to its original position. The aircraft
continued in straight and level ﬂight for approximately three to ﬁve seconds before
it slowly started a phugoid motion, with the nose dropping away slightly in the ﬁrst
instance. Each oscillation became greater, i.e. the dive and climb becoming steeper
with every oscillation; it was accompanied by roll, at the bottom of the dive during
the ‘pull-out’, it had maximum bank to the right.
The observer intimated recovery action to be taken at the end of the third
oscillation; as the aircraft came over the top from the climb to go into the dive, I
eased the stick forward to help it over the top. The stick felt light and there appeared
to be no additional response from the aircraft; as the aircraft commenced diving
again, I eased the stick back to where I considered I had pushed it from, thinking
that I would let the speed build up somewhat before easing the stick further back to
pull out of the dive. Quite a steep dive developed and just as I was about to ease
the stick back, probably three seconds after the previous stick movement, there was
suddenly severe vibration throughout what seemed to be the whole machine. From
then on until recovery was effected (I estimate ﬁve to ten seconds later), I have no
clear recollection of what took place. I think that immediately after the vibration,
the aircraft ﬂicked sharply to the left and nearly on to its back; it then fell more or
less the right way up but the fuselage was spinning, I think, to the right. It fell into a
steep dive and repeated the performance again; I selected autorotation quite early
during the proceedings. Once I saw the rotor rpm at 140, and later at 250. There

were moments when the stick was very light and others when it was extremely heavy.
The machine, I think, did three of these manoeuvres; it seemed to want to recover
during the second dive but it actually responded to the controls during the third dive.
Height when straight and level was 400 feet above sea level (height loss 800 feet).
The aircraft responded normally to the controls when under control again; I ﬂew
back to the airﬁeld and landed.
The pilot had excited the phugoid mode with a longitudinal cyclic pulse; recovery
action was initiated at the end of the third oscillation, the aircraft increased speed
in a dive and during the pull-out the blades hit the droop stop, and eventually the
fuselage, causing a rapid uncontrollable rolling motion. The resulting erratic motions,
during which the pilot became disoriented, eventually settled down and the aircraft
was ﬂown back to RAE and landed safely. The ‘auto-observer’ recorded a peak normal
acceleration of more than 4 g during the manoeuvre, causing severe buckling to occur
in the rear fuselage (Fig. 2.38). Two of the conclusions of the analysis of this incident
were
(1) ‘. . . large rapid movements of the controls are to be avoided, particularly at high
speed’.
(2) ‘some form of ﬂight testing technique should be devised whereby the susceptibility of
a helicopter to this trouble should be ascertained in the prototype stage’.
These conclusions are as relevant today as they were in the early days of helicopter
ﬂight testing; the ‘trouble’ noted above is still a feature of unaugmented helicopters.
Today, however, there exist ﬂying qualities criteria that deﬁne the boundaries of

acceptable mid-term pitch characteristics. Figure 2.39 illustrates the frequency/
damping requirements set down in ADS-33; the Level 1/2 and 2/3 boundaries are shown
for both helicopters and ﬁxed-wing aircraft (Ref. 2.3) for ‘fully attended’* ﬂight. Also
included are the loci of characteristics for the two baseline simulation conﬁgurations,
Helisim Lynx and Helisim Puma, in bare airframe or unstabilized conﬁgurations. Sev-
eral points can be drawn out of this ﬁgure. First, there is a range where characteristics
that are acceptable as Level 1 for helicopters are classiﬁed as Level 3 for ﬁxed-wing
aircraft. Secondly, for most of their ﬂight envelopes, our two Helisim aircraft will
not even meet the Level 3 requirements of the ﬁxed-wing criteria. The fact is that
it is impossible to build helicopters that, without augmentation, meet the ﬁxed-wing
standards; earlier in this chapter we discussed one of the reasons for this concerning
the positive stability derivative Mw. But this is not a good reason for degrading the
boundaries for safe ﬂight. On the contrary, the boundaries in Fig. 2.39 are deﬁned by
ﬂight results, which implies that rotary-wing pilots are willing to accept much less
* Pilot can devote full attention to attitude and ﬂight path control.

than their ﬁxed-wing counterparts. Hoh, in Ref. 2.4, has suggested two reasons for
this:
(1) ‘helicopter pilots are trained to cope with, and expect as normal, severe instabilities
and cross-axis coupling;’ and
(2) ‘the tasks used in the evaluations were not particularly demanding’.
The two reasons go together and helicopters could not be used safely for anything but
gentle tasks in benign conditions until feedback autostabilization could be designed
and built to suppress the naturally divergent tendencies.
Included in Fig. 2.39 is the helicopter boundary for ‘divided attention’* oper-
ations; this eliminates all unstable machines by requiring a damping ratio of 0.35.
Thus, helicopters that need to operate in poor weather or where the pilot has to release
the controls, or divert his attention to carry out a secondary task, need some form of
artiﬁcial stabilization. This conclusion applies to both military and civil operations,
the increased emphasis on safety for the latter providing an interesting counterpoint;
criteria for civil helicopter ﬂying qualities will be discussed further in Chapter 6.
The S-51 incident described above illustrates two important consequences of
ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies – that pilot disorientation and aircraft strength are the
limiting factors, i.e., the things that eventually ‘give’, and can therefore terminate the
situation following loss of control. This is the key to understanding that good ﬂying
qualities are ‘mission critical’.
Pilot-in-the-loop control; attacking a manoeuvre
A pilot’s most immediate impressions of a helicopter’s ﬂying qualities are likely to
be formed as he or she attempts to maintain attitude and position in the hover, and
later as the pilot manoeuvres and accelerates into forward ﬂight. Here, the quali-
ties of most interest are not the mid–long-term stability characteristics, but more the
small–moderate–large amplitude, short-term response to control inputs (see Fig. 2.37).
Consider the kinematics of a manoeuvre to change aircraft attitude. This may corre-
spond, for example, to the initial phase of an acceleration from the hover (pitch) or a
bank manoeuvre to turn in forward ﬂight (roll). The so-called task portrait sketches in
Fig. 2.40 illustrate the variations in pilot’s control inputs (a), the attitudes (b) and rates
(c) and include the manoeuvre (phase plane) portrait (d) and task signature diagrams
((e) and (f)), corresponding to three different pilot control strategies. The example as-
sumes a simple rate response type. Case 1 corresponds to the pilot applying maximum
control input as rapidly as possible and stabilizing out with an attitude change. Case 2
corresponds to the pilot manoeuvring more gently to achieve the same attitude. Case
3 corresponds to the pilot applying a much sharper maximum-pulse input, achieving
much the same rate as in case 2 but settling to a smaller ﬁnal attitude. For the third
case, the input is so sharp that the aircraft does not have time to reach its steady-state
rate response. The three cases are distinguished by the degree of aggressiveness and
the size of the pilot input, i.e., by different frequency and amplitude content. The task
signature diagrams (e) and (f) are constructed by computing the peak rate, ppk, and
associated attitude change 
φ for the different manoeuvres; each represents a point
on the diagram. The ratio of peak rate to attitude change, shown in Fig 2.40(f), is a
key parameter. Designated the ‘quickness’ parameter in ADS-33, this ratio has a max-
imum achievable value for a given attitude change. For large manoeuvres, the limit is

naturally set by the maximum achievable rate or the attitude control power, p(q)max;
case 1 represents an example of such a situation. The quickness is a frequency measure
and, for small amplitudes, represents the maximum ‘closed-loop’ frequency achievable
from the aircraft. It is therefore, on the one hand, a measure of the inherent manoeuvre
performance or agility of the aircraft and, on the other, a handling qualities parameter.
If the maximum achievable quickness is too small, then the pilot may complain that
the aircraft is too sluggish for tracking-type tasks; if the quickness is too high, then the
pilot may complain of jerkiness or oversensitivity.
Bandwidth – a parameter for all seasons?
For the small amplitude, higher frequency end of the response spectrum, two classic
measures of quality – the step response character and low-order-equivalent system
(LOES) response – have proved deﬁcient for capturing the important features that
relate to tracking and pursuit-type tasks in helicopters. The equivalent systems ap-
proach adopted in the ﬁxed-wing community has many attractions, but the rotorcraft’s

 
68
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
non-classical response types really make the LOES a non-starter in most cases. Also,
the detailed shape of the step response function appears to be sensitive to small imper-
fections in the control input shape and measurement inaccuracies. Strictly, of course,
the small amplitude tracking behaviour should have little to do with the step response
and much more to do with amplitude and phase at high frequency. Nevertheless, the
direction taken by ADS-33, in this area, was clariﬁed only after considerable debate
and effort, and it is probably fair to say that there is still some controversy associated
with the adoption of the so-called bandwidth criteria.
For simple response types, maximum quickness is actually a close approximation
to this more fundamental handling qualities parameter – bandwidth (Ref. 2.32). This
parameter will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, but some elaboration at this
point is worthwhile. The bandwidth is that frequency beyond which closed-loop stabil-
ity is threatened. That may seem a long step from the preceding discussion, and some
additional exposure is necessary. For any closed-loop tracking task, the natural delays
in the pilot’s perceptual pathways, neuro-muscular and psycho-motor systems (Ref.
2.33), give rise to increasing control problems as the disturbance frequency increases.
Without the application of pilot control lead, the closed-loop pilot/aircraft system will
gradually lose stability as the pilot gain or disturbing frequency increases. The point
of instability is commonly referred to as the crossover frequency and the bandwidth
frequency corresponds to some lower value that provides an adequate stability margin.
In practice, this is deﬁned as the highest frequency at which the pilot can double his
gain or allow a 135◦phase lag between control input and aircraft attitude response
without causing instability. The higher the bandwidth, the larger will be the aircraft’s
safety margin in high gain tracking tasks, but just as we have implied a possible upper
limit on the quickness, so bandwidth may be limited by similar overresponsiveness.
We have introduced some new ﬂying qualities parlance above, e.g., crossover,
perceptual pathways, gain and lead/lag, and the reader will need to carry these concepts
forward to later chapters for elaboration. The whole question of short-term attitude
control has been discussed at some length because of its critical importance to any ﬂying
task; changing attitude tilts the rotor thrust vector and reorients the aircraft and hence
the ﬂight path vector. It is not surprising that handling criteria are most substantially
developed on this topic. For the case of small amplitude, high-frequency pitch motions
(see Fig. 2.37), bandwidth criteria have been developed for both ﬁxed- and rotary-wing
aircraft. For both types of aircraft the criteria are displayed in two-parameter form with
the phase delay parameter, τp. Phase delay relates to the rate of change of phase with
frequency above the crossover frequency and is also a measure of the equivalent time
delay between attitude response and pilot control input. Fig. 2.41 tells a similar story
to the comparison of ﬁxed- and rotary-wing criteria for mid-term stability (cf. Fig.
2.39); there is a range in the τp, ωbw plane where Level 1 helicopter characteristics
correspond to Level 3 aeroplane characteristics. The boundaries in Fig. 2.41 are typical
ofthemission-orientedcriteriafoundinmodernspeciﬁcations;theyapplytoair-combat
tasks for helicopters and, more generally, to Category A ﬂight phases for aeroplanes
(see Ref. 2.3). They have been developed from the best available test data relating to
current operational requirements. To a large extent, the striking differences between
the ﬁxed- and rotary wing relate directly to different task requirements; as yet, rotary-
wing aircraft have not been required to deliver the performance of their ﬁxed-wing
counterparts. On the other hand, it would be very difﬁcult to confer such bandwidth
performance on a conventional helicopter from an engineering point of view, so a large

degree of capability tailoring is inevitable. In later chapters, some of the conﬁguration
constraints and design limitations will be discussed in more detail.
Earlier, we dismissed equivalent low-order systems as being inadequate at char-
acterizing helicopter attitude characteristics. While this is true for conventional heli-
copters without, or having limited authority, stability and control augmentation, future
aircraft with task-tailored control laws can more usefully be described in this way.
Later, in Chapters 6 and 7, we shall introduce the conceptual simulation model (CSM,
Ref. 2.34), which is, in effect, a greatly simpliﬁed helicopter model in LOES form.
The assumption underlying this model structure is that with active control, the ﬂying
qualities can be tailored in a wide range of different forms described now by simple
equivalent systems. Flying qualities research at DRA using the CSM has been ongoing
since the early 1980s and has enabled many of the desirable characteristics of future
helicopters with active control technology (ACT) to be identiﬁed. This theme will be
pursued in the later ﬂying qualities chapters.
There is one helicopter ﬂying characteristic that can, at least for the limited
frequency range associated with pilot control, be described in terms of a simple ﬁrst-
order response – the vertical or heave axis in the hover. While it is recognized that
the vertical axis dynamics are dominated by air mass and ﬂapping motion at higher
frequency, below about 5 rad/s the vertical velocity response (˙h) to collective (δc) can
be described by the LOES:
˙h
δc
= Ke−τ˙heq s
T˙heq s + 1
(2.83)
This formulation characterizes the ﬁrst-order velocity response as a transfer function,
with gain or control power K and time delay T˙heq . The pure time delay T˙heq is an artifact
included to capture any initial delay in achieving maximum vertical acceleration, e.g.,
due to rotor or air-mass dynamics. The acceptable ﬂying qualities can then be deﬁned
in terms of the LOES parameters. Vertical axis ﬂying qualities and ﬂight path control in
forward ﬂight are also profoundly affected by the dynamic characteristics of the engine
and rotorspeed governor system. Agile behaviour can be sustained only with rapid and

 
70
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
sustained thrust and torque response, both of which are dependent on fast powerplant
dynamics. As usual there is a trade-off, and too much agility can be unusable and
wasteful. This will be a recurring theme of Chapter 7.
Flying a mission task element
Flying qualities parameters need to be physically meaningful and measurable. Assem-
bled together as a requirement speciﬁcation, they need to embrace the CACTUS rules
(Ref. 2.35) outlined later in Chapter 6. Also in Chapter 6, the range of different criteria
and the measurement of associated parameters in ﬂight and simulation will be critically
reviewed in the light of these underlying requirements. It needs to be re-emphasized
that in most functional roles today, both military and civil helicopters need some form
of artiﬁcial stability and control augmentation to achieve Level 1 ﬂying qualities, which
therefore become important drivers for both bare-airframe and automatic ﬂight control
system (AFCS) design. Before exploring the scope for artiﬁcial augmentation on this
Tour, it is worth illustrating just how, in a demanding and fully attentive ﬂying task, an
MTE, ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies can lead to reduced task performance and increased
pilot workload.
Test techniques for the demonstration of ﬂying qualities compliance need to exer-
cise the aircraft to the limits of its performance. Figure 2.42 illustrates two NoE, hover
to hover, repositioning manoeuvres: the quickhop and the sidestep. Tests conducted at
the DRA Bedford in the mid-1980s demonstrated the importance of the task urgency
or aggression factor (Ref. 2.36) on pilot workload and task performance. The ma-
noeuvres were ﬂown at increasing levels of aggression until the shortest possible task
time was achieved. Start and ﬁnish position constraints, together with a height/track
corridor, deﬁned the acceptable ﬂight path. Performance was increased by increasing
the initial pitch or roll angle, to develop the maximum translational acceleration; both
test aircraft, Lynx and Puma, were operated at relatively low weights allowing for
accelerations over the ground of greater than 0.8 g (∼40◦roll/pitch) corresponding
to a hover thrust margin of about 30%. Figure 2.43 shows the recorded pilot HQRs
as a function of task time for a Puma ﬂying a 200-ft (60 m) sidestep. Above 11 s the
pilot returned marginal Level 1 ratings; any reduction in task time below this resulted

An Introductory Tour
71
Fig. 2.43 Variations of pilot HQRs with task time for Puma 200-ft sidestep
in increasing workload. In fact, the pilot was unable to reduce the task time below 9 s
and still achieve the ﬂight path performance requirements. On one occasion the wheels
hit the ground during the ﬁnal recover to the hover; the pilot was applying full lateral
cyclic, collective and pedal control, but, as a result of the roll and engine/rotorspeed
governor response characteristics, the manoeuvre was not arrested in time. The low
kinetic energy of the aircraft meant that no structural damage was incurred, but the
pilot judged that he was ‘out of control’ and returned an HQR of 10 (Fig. 2.43).
The cliff edge and carefree handling
A combination of deﬁciencies in vehicle dynamics, the need for the pilot to monitor
carefully critical parameters for proximity to ﬂight limits, the poor outside visual
references at high aircraft attitude angles and the overall pilot stress induced by the
need to ﬂy a tightly constrained ﬂight path very close to the ground result in a Level 2/3
‘situation’. Of course, the Puma, as a medium support helicopter, was not designed to ﬂy
200-ft sidesteps in 8 s – the approximate limit for the test conﬁguration. Nevertheless,
pilots were inhibited from using the full performance (bank angles of 30◦were the
maximum measured) and many of the pilots’ concerns are common to other types. A
similar pattern emerged for the Lynx in the DRA tests and on aircraft used in trials
conducted by the US Army (Ref. 2.37) during the same period. Also, the same trend
appears for other MTEs, and is considered to represent a fundamental challenge to
designers. Close to, say, within 20% of vehicle limits, it appears that the ‘edge’ is
reached in several ways at the same time; ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies are emerging
strongly, just when the pilot has the greatest need for safe and predictable, or carefree,
handling. The concept of carefree handling has been a familiar reality in aeroplane
designs for some years, protecting against spin departure (e.g., Tornado) or deep stall
(e.g., F-16) for example, but is yet to be implemented, at least in an active form,
in helicopters. At the time of writing, another form of carefree handling, providing

 
72
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
structural load alleviation, is being built into the computers of the ﬂy-by-wire control
system in the V22 Osprey. This topic is returned to in Chapter 7.
Agility factor
The DRA tests described above were part of a larger research programme aimed at
providing a better understanding of the ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies of current military
types and quantifying future requirements. Of special interest was the impact of ﬂying
qualities on agility; the concept of agility will be developed further in Chapter 7 but,
for this introductory Tour, a suitable deﬁnition is (Ref. 2.38)
the ability to adapt and respond rapidly and precisely with safety and with poise, to
maximize mission effectiveness.
A key question that the results of the above research raised concerned how the
agility might be related to the ﬂying qualities. One interpretation the author favours is
that agility is indeed a ﬂying quality. This is supported by the concept of the agility
factor: if the performance used in a particular MTE could be normalized by the perfor-
mance inherently available in the aircraft, then in the limit, this ratio would reveal the
extent of usable performance. A more convenient way of computing this factor is to
take the ratio of the theoretically ideal task time with the achieved task time. The ideal
time is computed based on the assumption that the time to maximum acceleration is
zero. So in the sidestep, or any similar lateral translational manoeuvre for example, the
bank angle changes are achieved instantaneously. In a pure bank and stop manoeuvre,
the roll rate would be assumed to develop instantaneously. The agility factor is useful
for comparing the inherent agility of conﬁgurations with the same performance or
competing to meet the same performance requirements. The calculation procedure and
some of the factor’s nuances will be elaborated on in Chapter 7. The Puma sidestep
and quickhop MTE data converted to agility factors are shown with the HQRs in
Fig 2.44. The trends shown previously in the time plots now appear even more dra-
matic; maximum agility factors for the Puma of 0.5–0.6 are achievable with borderline
Level 2/3 HQRs only. The pilot can barely attain the adequate performance level, even
with considerable workload. These tests were conducted in a clinical environment,
with well-deﬁned ground features and ﬂown by skilled test pilots with opportunity to

73
practice. In a real-world situation, the increased workload from other duties and the
uncertainties of rapidly changing circumstances would inevitably lead to a further loss
of agility or the increased risks of operation in the Level 3 regime; the pilot must choose
in favour of safety or performance.
In agility factor experiments, the deﬁnition of the level of manoeuvre attack needs
to be related to the key manoeuvre parameter, e.g., aircraft speed, attitude, turn rate
or target motion. By increasing attack in an experiment, we are trying to reduce the
time constant of the task, or reduce the task bandwidth. It is sufﬁcient to deﬁne three
levels – low, moderate and high, the lower corresponding to normal manoeuvring, and
the upper to emergency manoeuvres.
Pilot’s workload
The chief attributes of agility are speed, precision and safety and all can be eroded by
the increased difﬁculties of the operational situation. Not only the time pressures, but
also the atmospheric conditions (e.g., gustiness) and UCE (see Section 2.2) will affect
the agility factor and achieved HQRs signiﬁcantly. In many of these cases there is a
close correlation between pilot control activity, task difﬁculty and pilot rating, and in
such cases the level of control activity can be related to pilot workload. Figure 2.45
shows the pilot’s lateral cyclic control for two different levels of aggression when ﬂying
a slalom MTE on the DRA’s advanced ﬂight simulator (AFS); the details of this and
other experiments will be provided in Chapter 7, but for now the varying frequency
and amplitude levels are highlighted. The HQR levels are also noted on the legend,
Fig. 2.45 Time histories of lateral cyclic in a lateral slalom MTE

 
74
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
Fig. 2.46 Power spectrum of lateral cyclic in a lateral slalom MTE
indicating the degradation from Level 1 to 2 as the aggression is increased. In the case
shown, the degradation corresponds to a task bandwidth increase.
Another way of representing the pilot control activity is in the frequency domain,
and Fig. 2.46 illustrates the power spectral density function for the lateral cyclic,
showing the amount of control ‘energy’ applied by the pilot at the different frequencies.
The marked increase in effort for the higher aggression case is evident, particularly
above 1.5 Hz. There is evidence that one of the critical parameters as far as the pilot
workload is concerned is the ratio of aircraft bandwidth to task bandwidth. The latter
is easy to comprehend for an aircraft ﬂying, for example, a sinusoidal slalom, when the
task bandwidth is related to the ground track geometry and the aircraft ground speed.
Bandwidths for more angular MTE tracks are less obvious, but usually some ratio of
speed, or mean speed, to distance will sufﬁce. Figure 2.47 illustrates conceptually the
expected trend. A workload metric, e.g., rms of control activity or frequency at which
some proportion of the activity is accounted for, is plotted against the bandwidth
ratio. As the ratio increases one expects the pilot’s task to become easier, as shown.
Conversely, as the ratio reduces, through either reduced aircraft bandwidth or increased
task bandwidth, workload increases. There is a point at which the workload increases
signiﬁcantly, corresponding perhaps to pilot-induced oscillation onset, when the metric
may no longer correlate with workload and where the control strategy is dominated by
the so-called remnant, often reﬂecting confusion and a breakdown of the pilot acting
as a quasi-linear element responding to task cue errors. Being able to detect incipient
breakdown is important for establishing ﬂying qualities boundaries and also for giving
a pilot some advance warning of a potential high workload situation. Research in

Fig. 2.47 Conceptual relationship between pilot workload and the bandwidth ratio
this ﬁeld is still relatively immature, and most experiments rely heavily on subjective
pilot opinion. To the author’s knowledge, there are no reliable workload meters, the
human equivalent of a mechanical health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), used
in operational service.
Inceptors and displays
This tour of ﬂying qualities would not be complete without some discussion on the
other key characteristics associated with the air vehicle that have a primary effect on
ﬂight path control – the pilot’s inceptors and displays. To dispel any myths that these
are secondary issues it must be said that poor characteristics in either of these two areas
can ruin otherwise excellent ﬂying qualities. Of course, pilots can and will compensate
for poor mechanical characteristics in cockpit controls, but the tactile and visual cues
provided through these elements are essential for many ﬂight phases. Sidestick controls
and helmet-mounted displays are components of ACT and are likely to feature large in
the cockpits of future helicopters (Figs 2.48, 2.49). Examples of recent research with
these devices will be outlined in Chapter 7.
Operational beneﬁts of ﬂying qualities
So, what are the operational beneﬁts of good ﬂying qualities? Are they really signiﬁcant
or merely ‘nice to have’? We have seen that one of the potential consequences of ﬂying
qualities deﬁciencies is loss of control, leading to structural damage, pilot disorientation
and a crash. We have also seen that an aircraft that exhibits Level 1 characteristics in
one situation can be Level 2 or even 3 in degraded or more demanding conditions.
A question then arises as to the likelihood of a aircraft running into these situations
in practice. This topic has recently received attention in the ﬁxed-wing civil transport
community in an attempt to quantify the probability of human error leading to a crash
(Ref. 2.38). The same approach was taken to quantify the beneﬁts of having baseline
Level 1, as opposed to Level 2, ﬂying qualities for military rotorcraft (Ref. 2.39). This
research, which will be described in more detail in Chapter 7, derived a result that
is summarized in Fig. 2.50. This shows the probability of achieving MTE success,

failure or loss of control (leading to a crash) as a function of mean HQR (derived, for
example, from an ADS-33 objective assessment). The results are somewhat intuitive
and fall out from fairly simple statistical analysis. There are a number of assumptions
that need careful examination before the kind of results depicted in Fig. 2.50 can be
substantiated, however, and these will be pursued further in Chapter 7. The approach,
while somewhat controversial, has considerable appeal and opens up opportunities for
providing a direct effectiveness measure for ﬂying qualities.
Flying qualities review
A key emphasis on this stage of the Tour has been to highlight the importance of the
relationship between ﬂying qualities and the task or mission. Outside the context of a
role and related tasks, the meaning of quality becomes vague and academic. Flying or
handling qualities are not just stability and response properties of the air vehicle, but the
synergy between what we have called the internal attributes of the aircraft and external
inﬂuences. Flying qualities can be assessed objectively through analysis and clinical
measurements, and subjectively through pilot opinion of the ability to ﬂy MTEs within
deﬁned performance and workload constraints. The 1980s and 1990s saw considerable
development in helicopter ﬂying qualities, relevant to both design criteria and compli-
ance demonstration, and Chapters 6 and 7 will present and discuss many of the new
concepts in depth. There still exist gaps in the knowledge base however, largely due
to an inadequate ﬂight test database, and these areas will be highlighted. One of the
important underdeveloped areas relates to the requirement for upper ﬂying qualities
limits. These are important for military roles requiring agility, where the assumption
that more performance is always better is strongly countered by experience with over-
sensitive control response and unusable control powers. Agility will be covered in the

 
78
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
section on special ﬂying qualities in Chapter 7. The quantiﬁcation of handling qualities
degradation due to a variety of internal and external effects also represents a signiﬁcant
gap, and in Chapter 8 we discuss a number of the more signiﬁcant issues.
It is recognized that without some form of stability and control augmentation
system (SCAS), helicopters stand little chance of achieving Level 1 ﬂying qualities for
anything but the simplest of tasks. However, we need to be interested in the so-called
bare-airframe ﬂight dynamics for several reasons. First, the unaugmented characteris-
tics form the baseline for SCAS design; the better they are known, the more likely that
the SCAS design will work properly ﬁrst time. Second, the case of failed augmenta-
tion systems has to be considered; the level of bare-airframe characteristics determine
whether the SCAS is ﬂight-safety or mission critical, i.e., whether the mission or even
safe ﬂight can be continued. Third, the better the ﬂying qualities conferred by bare-
airframe design, the less authority the SCAS requires, or the lower the gains in the
feedback loops, and hence the more robust will the aircraft be to SCAS failures. And
fourth, with a limited authority SCAS, any saturation in manoeuvring ﬂight will ex-
pose the pilot to the bare-airframe characteristics; any problems associated with these
conditions need to be well understood.
Clearly, SCAS performance is closely linked with the ﬂight dynamics of the bare
airframe and they both together form one of the drivers in the overall helicopter design,
a subject that we now brieﬂy visit on the last stop of this Tour.

In the helicopter design trade-off, ﬂying qualities have often had to take a low prior-
ity. In the early days of rotorcraft, just as with ﬁxed-wing aircraft, solving the basic
control problem was the breakthrough required for the development to progress with
pace, driven largely by performance considerations. The basic layout of the single
rotor helicopter has remained the same since the early Sikorsky machines. What char-
acterizes a modern helicopter is its higher performance (speed, payload), much im-
proved reliability – hence greater safety, smoother ride and a suite of mission avionic
systems that enable civil operations in poorer weather and military operations as an
autonomous weapon system. Performance, reliability, comfort and functionality have
been the drivers in helicopter development, and for many years ﬂying quality was a
by-product of the design, with deﬁciencies compensated for by highly trained pilots
with a can-do attitude. As we have seen from our discussions earlier on this tour, heli-
copter ﬂying characteristics are typically much poorer than ﬁxed-wing aircraft in the
same ‘class’. In some cases, helicopters fall in the Level 3 quality area when built. The
principal ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies in the helicopter can be summarized as follows:
(1) impurity of the primary response in all axes, i.e., typically a mix of attitude or rate and
varying signiﬁcantly from hover to high speed;
(2) strong cross-couplings in all axes;
(3) the degradation of response quality at ﬂight envelope limits and the lack of any natural
carefree handling functions, e.g., the aerodynamic capability of the rotor typically
exceeds the structural capability;

(4) the stability of a helicopter is characterized by a number of modes with low damping
and frequency at low speed; as forward speed is increased, both longitudinal and
lateral modes increase in frequency, as the tail surfaces contribute aerodynamic
stiffness, but the modal damping can reduce and stability can often worsen,
particularly with highly responsive hingeless rotors;
(5) the rotor presents a signiﬁcant ﬁlter to high bandwidth control.
The combination of the above has always demanded great skill from helicopter pilots
and coupled with today’s requirements for extended operations in poor weather and
visibility, and the need to relieve the piloting task in threat-intensive operations, led
to the essential requirement for stability and control augmentation. Before discussing
artiﬁcial stability, one ﬁrst needs to look more closely at the key natural design fea-
tures that contribute to ﬂying qualities. The discussion will map directly onto the ﬁve
headings in the above list and an attempt is made to illustrate how, even within the
ﬂying qualities discipline, compromises need to be made usually to satisfy both high-
and low-speed requirements simultaneously.
Impurity of primary response
The helicopter rotor is sensitive to velocity perturbations in all directions and there is
very little the rotor designer can do about this that doesn’t compromise control response.
Early attempts to build in natural dynamic couplings that neutralized the rotor from
external disturbances (Refs 2.40, 2.41) resulted in complex rotor mechanisms that only
partially succeeded in performing well, but, for better or worse, were never pursued
to fruition and production. In reality, such endeavours were soon overtaken by the
advances in ‘electronic’ stabilization. All motion axes of a helicopter have natural
damping that resists the motion, providing a basic rate command control response
in the very short term. However, soon after a control input is applied, the changes
in incidence and sideslip give rise to velocity variations that alter the natural rate
response characteristics in all axes. This can occur within a very short time (O(1 s)) as
for the pitch axis response in high-speed ﬂight, or longer (O(several seconds)) as for
the yaw response in hover. The impurities require the pilot to stay in the loop to apply
compensatory control inputs, as any manoeuvre develops. Apart from the main rotor
sensitivity, the tail rotor and empennage sensitivities to main rotor wake effects can also
introduce strong impurities into the control response. The size, location and incidence
of the horizontal stabilizer can have a profound effect on the pilot’s ability to establish
trims in low-speed ﬂight. Likewise, the tail rotor position, direction of rotation and
proximity to the vertical stabilizer can signiﬁcantly affect the pilot’s ability to maintain
heading in low-speed ﬂight (Ref. 2.42). Both horizontal and vertical tail surfaces are
practically redundant in hover and low-speed ﬂight but provide natural stiffness and
damping in high-speed ﬂight to compensate for the unstable rotor and fuselage. The
modelling of the interactional ﬂowﬁelds is clearly important for predicting response
impurities and will be discussed further in Chapter 3.
Strong cross-couplings
Perhaps the greatest distinguishing feature of helicopters, and a bane in the designer’s
life, cross-couplings come in all shapes and sizes. On hingeless rotor helicopters in
hover, the off-axis roll response from a pitch input can be as large as the on-axis
response. At high-speed, the pitch response from collective can be as strong as from

 
80
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
longitudinal cyclic. The yaw response from collective, due to the torque reaction, can
require an equivalent tail rotor collective input to compensate. At high speed the pitch
response from yaw can lead to dissimilar control strategies being required in right and
left turns. These high levels of impurity again stem principally from the main rotor and
its powerful wake and are inherent features of helicopters. During the 1970s and 1980s,
several new designs underwent extensive ﬂight test development to minimize the ﬂying
qualities deﬁciencies caused by cross-couplings and response impurities. The residual
forces and moments and associated aircraft accelerations induced by these couplings
can lead to serious shortcomings if high performance is being sought. For example,
the saga of the empennage development for the AH64 (Ref. 2.43) and the AS 360
series helicopters (Ref. 2.44) indicate, on the one hand, how extensive the redesign to
ﬁx handling qualities can be, and, on the other, how much improvement can be obtained
by careful attention to detail, e.g., in the aerodynamic characteristics of the horizontal
and vertical stabilizers.
Response degradation at ﬂight envelope limits
The boundary of the operational ﬂight envelope should not be characterized by loss
of control or performance; there should always be a safe control and performance
margin for operation at the OFE limit. Most of these limit boundaries are not sign-
posted however, and inadvertent excursions into the region between the OFE and the
SFE boundary can and do happen, particularly when the crew’s attention is diverted
to other matters. Helicopters with low power margins can get caught in large-scale
downdrafts behind buildings and other obstacles or terrain culture, making it very
difﬁcult for a pilot to arrest a rate of descent. Turning downwind can cause a helicopter
to ﬂy close to the vortex-ring region if the pilot judges his speed relative to the ground
rather than the air. Both these examples can lead to a sharp reduction in lift and height
and represent conditions most like wing stall for a ﬁxed-wing aircraft. Hovering or
manoeuvring at low speed close to obstacles in strong winds can also lead to loss of
tail rotor control authority, or even, in exceptional cases, to a loss of cyclic control
margins. Being ‘out-of- (moment) control’ close to obstacles can be as dangerous as
losing lift. At high speed, or while manoeuvring in the mid-speed range, the rotor can
experience local blade stall. While this is unlikely to have much effect on the overall
lift, if the retreating blade stalls ﬁrst, the aircraft will experience a nose-up pitching
moment, further exacerbating the stall. Forward motion on the cyclic to correct the
motion applies a further pitch increase on the retreating side of the disc, worsening
the stall. There are very little data available on the handling qualities effects when the
rotor is partially stalled in high-speed ﬂight, but clearly ﬂying qualities will degrade.
Once again, the designer is forced to make a compromise. A low disc loading, highly
twisted rotor serves hover and low-speed performance and handling, while a high disc
loading, untwisted rotor gives better manoeuvrability and ride at high speed. From the
designer’s perspective, the alternate yaw control devices like the fenestron and Notar
(Refs 2.5, 2.6) are attractive options to the open tail rotor if vulnerability is a major
concern, even though handling and performance may be compromised.
Poor stability
The instabilities of the helicopter fall into two categories – those at low speed due to
the rotor and those at high speed due to the rotor; the designer can do very little about
the ﬁrst with airframe design, but he can make ﬂight at high speed almost as stable as a

 
An Introductory Tour
81
ﬁxed-wing aircraft. Unfortunately, if he chooses the latter option, he will almost cer-
tainly compromise control and agility. Building large enough ﬁxed empennage stabiliz-
ers will always work but will, in turn, increase the demands on the rotor for manoeuvres.
Selecting a rotor with zero or low equivalent hinge offset (e.g., most articulated rotors)
will probably result in the pitch axis being marginally stable in high speed, but will
again reduce the agility of the aircraft. On the other hand, a hingeless rotor, providing
a roll time constant equivalent to a ﬁxed-wing aircraft (O(0.1 s)) will also result in an
unstable pitch mode with time to double of less than 1 s at high speed.
At low speed, without mechanical feedback, the single rotor helicopter is natu-
rally unstable. The coupled pitch/roll, so-called pendulum instability is a product of the
ﬂapping rotor’s response to velocity perturbations. The mode is actually a fairly docile
one, and is easily controlled once the required strategy is learnt, but requires consider-
able attention by the pilot. However, if the outside world visual cues degrade, so that
the pilot has difﬁculty perceiving attitude and velocity relative to the ground, then the
hover task becomes increasingly difﬁcult and Level 3 qualities are soon experienced.
The rotor as a control ﬁlter
The main rotor is the motivator for all but yaw control on the conventional helicopter,
and before the fuselage can respond, the rotor must respond. The faster the rotorspeed,
the faster the rotor ﬂap response to control application and hence the faster the fuselage
response. In many respects, the rotor acts like an actuator in the control circuit but there
is one important difference. The rotor DoFs, the ﬂap, lag and torsional motions, are
considerably more complex than a simple servo system and can have low enough
damping to threaten stability for high gain control tasks. Such potential problems are
usually cured in the design of the SCAS, but often at the expense of introducing even
further lags into the control loops. With typical actuator and rotor time constants, the
overall effective time delay between pilot control input and rotor control demand can
be greater than 100 ms. Such a delay can halve the response bandwidth capability of
an ‘instantaneous’ rotor.
Theﬁveissuesdiscussedabovearecompoundedbythespecialproblemassociated
with manoeuvring close to the ground and surrounding relief – providing an adequate
ﬁeld of view (FoV); the issue was expressed succinctly by Prouty (Ref. 2.45):
The most important ﬂying cue a pilot can have is a good view of the ground and
everything around.
Field of view is a signiﬁcant design compromise, most helicopters suffering from
an inadequate FoV from a ﬂying qualities perspective. Overhead panels in side-by-side
cockpits obscure the view into turns and tandem seaters can be deﬁcient in forward
and downward views.
Fixing ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies during ﬂight test development can be very
expensive and emphasizes the importance of accurate simulation, model testing and
analytical tools in the design process. It also emphasizes the critical importance of
validated design criteria – what constitutes good ﬂying qualities for helicopters – and
this book addresses this question directly in Chapter 6.
Artiﬁcial stability
It should be clear to the reader from the various discussions on this Tour that it is
difﬁcult to design and build helicopters that naturally exhibit Level 1 ﬂying qualities.
Pilots need help to ﬂy and perform missions effectively in helicopters, and modern

SCAS and integrated displays go some way to providing this. Autostabilizers were
ﬁrst developed to increase the helicopter’s operational envelope to include ﬂight under
instrument conditions. The ﬁrst priority was to provide artiﬁcial stability to ensure that
the aircraft would not wander off when the pilot’s attention was divided with other
tasks. If we consider the addition of rate damping in the pitch axis, we can write the
feedback law in proportional form:
θ1sa = kqq
(2.84)
Figure 2.51 shows a block diagram of this feedback loop. With this proportional feed-
back working, as the helicopter ﬂies through turbulence, every 1◦/s of pitch rate change
is counteracted by k◦
q of longitudinal cyclic pitch θ1s. The higher the value of gain kq,
the greater the ‘artiﬁcial’ stability conferred on the helicopter. The root loci in Fig. 2.52
illustrates how the high-speed unstable pitch mode can be stabilized through pitch rate
feedback for Helisim Lynx. We can see that even with quite high values of gain magni-
tudes (∼0.25), the aircraft is still marginally unstable. Gain magnitudes much higher
than about 0.2 would not be acceptable because the limited authority of today’s SCAS
designs (typically about ±10% of actuator range) would result in the augmentation
quickly saturating in manoeuvres or moderate turbulence. We can conclude from this
discussion that rate feedback is insufﬁcient to provide the levels of stability required for
meeting Level 1 ﬂying qualities in divided-attention operations. If we include attitude
stabilization in the feedback loop, the control law can be written in proportional plus
integral form
θ1sa = kqq + kθ

(2.85)
Attitude feedback provides an effective stiffness in the pitch axis, and increasing kθ
serves to increase the frequency of the unstable pitch mode as shown in Fig 2.52. An
appropriate combination of rate and attitude feedback can now be found to ensure
Level 1 ﬂying qualities and most modern SCAS designs incorporate both components.
Rate and attitude feedbacks provide stability augmentation; but do nothing positive
for control augmentation; in fact, the control response is reduced as the stability aug-
mentation ﬁghts the pilot’s actions as well as disturbances. Control augmentation is

83

accomplished by feeding forward the pilot’s control signals into the SCAS, applying
shaping functions or effectively disabling elements of the stability augmentation dur-
ing manoeuvres. Different SCAS designs accomplish this in different ways; the Lynx
system augments the initial response with a feedforward signal from the pilot’s control,
while the Puma system disables the attitude stabilization whenever the pilot moves the
controls. More modern systems accomplish the same task with greater sophistication,
but modern SCAS designs that interface with mechanical control systems will always
be limited in their potential by the authority constraints designed to protect against fail-
ures. In the limit, increasing the authority of the augmentation system takes us towards
ACT where the pilot’s control (inceptor) inputs are combined with multiple sensor
data in a digital computer to provide tailored response characteristics. ACT is still a
developing technology for rotorcraft at the time of writing, but the potential beneﬁts to
both military performance and civil safety are considerable and can be classed under
three general headings:
(1) task-tailored Level 1 ﬂying qualities throughout the OFE, e.g., tailored for shipboard
recoveries, underslung load positioning or air combat;
(2) carefree handling, ensuring safe operations at the edges of the OFE;
(3) integration with mission functions, e.g., navigation, HUMS.

 
84
Helicopter Flight Dynamics
The introduction of ACT into helicopters also offers the designer the opportunity to
explore control-conﬁgured designs, in much the same way that ﬁxed-wing military air-
craft have developed over the last two decades. Even with the conventional single-rotor
helicopter, ACT can free the designer to remove the empennage stabilizers altogether
or alternatively to make them moving and under computer control. The main rotor
could be made smaller or lighter if a carefree handling system were able to ensure
a particular loading pattern in manoeuvres and at the OFE boundary. Of course it is
with the more advanced rotorcraft concepts, with multiple control motivators, e.g., tilt
rotors and thrust/lift compounding, that ACT will offer the greatest design freedoms
and ﬂying qualities enhancement. While this book has little to say about the ﬂight
dynamics of advanced rotorcraft, the author is conscious that the greatest strides in the
future will be made with such conﬁgurations, if the ‘market’ can afford them or if the
military requirements are strong enough.

Chapter Review
The subject of ﬂight dynamics is characterized by an interplay between theory and
experiment. This Tour has attempted to highlight this interplay in a number of ways.
Marking the four reference points early on the Tour – the environment, the vehicle,
the task and the pilot – an attempt has been made to reveal the considerable scope of
the subject and the skills required of the ﬂight dynamics engineer. The importance of
strong analytical tools, fundamental to the understanding of the behaviour of the heli-
copter’s interacting subsystems, was emphasized in the modelling section. The power-
ful effect of aerodynamics on the ﬂapping rotor was examined in some detail, with the
resonant response highlighted as perhaps the single most important characteristic of
rotor dynamics, enabling easy control of the rotor disc tilt. The modelling of ﬂight dy-
namics was discussed within the framework of the frequency and amplitude of motion
with three fundamental problems – trim, stability and response. The second major topic
on the landscape of this Tour was ﬂying quality, characterized by three key properties.
Flying qualities are pilot-centred attributes; they are mission- and even task oriented,
and they are ultimately the synergy between the internal attributes of the aircraft and
the external environment in which it operates. Flying qualities are safety attributes but
good ﬂying qualities also allow the performance of the helicopter to be fully exploited.
The remaining chapters of this book cover modelling and ﬂying qualities in detail.

Modelling helicopter ﬂight dynamics:
building a simulation model
It is beyond dispute that the observed behaviour of aircraft is so complex
and puzzling that, without a well developed theory, the subject could not
be treated intelligently. Theory has at least three useful functions;
a) it provides a background for the analysis of actual occurrences,
b) it provides a rational basis for the planning of experiments and tests,
thus securing economy of effort,
c) it helps the designer to design intelligently.
Theory, however, is never complete, ﬁnal or exact. Like design and con-
struction it is continually developing and adapting itself to circumstances.
(Duncan 1952)
3.1
Introduction and Scope
The attributes of theory described by Duncan in this chapter’s guiding quote have a
ring of eternal validity to them. With today’s perspective we could add a little more.
Theory helps the ﬂying qualities engineer to gain a deep understanding of the behaviour
of ﬂight and the limiting conditions imposed by the demands of ﬂying tasks, hence
providing insight and stimulating inspiration. The classic text by Duncan (Ref. 3.1)
was directed at ﬁxed-wing aircraft, of course. Describing the ﬂight behaviour of the
helicopter presents an even more difﬁcult challenge to mathematical modelling. The
vehicle can be viewed as a complex arrangement of interacting subsystems, shown
in component form in Fig. 3.1. The problem is dominated by the rotor and this will
be reﬂected by the attention given to this component in the present chapter. The rotor
blades bend and twist under the inﬂuence of unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamic
loads, which are themselves a function of the blade motion. Figure 3.2 illustrates this
aeroelastic problem as a feedback system. The two feedback loops provide incidence
perturbations due to blade (and fuselage) motion and downwash, which are added to
those due to atmospheric disturbances and blade pitch control inputs. The calculation of
these two incidence perturbations dominates rotor modelling and hence features large
in this chapter. For the calculation of aerodynamic loads, we shall be concerned with
the blade motion relative to the air and hence the motion of the hub and fuselage as well
as the motion of the blades relative to the hub. Relative motion will be a recurring theme
in this chapter, which brings into focus the need for common reference frames. This
subject is given separate treatment in the appendix to this chapter, where the various
axes transformations required to derive the relative motion are set down. Expressions
for the accelerations of the fuselage centre of gravity and a rotor blade element are

derived in the Appendix, Sections 3A.1 and 3A.4, respectively. Rotor blades operate in
their own wake and that of their neighbour blades. Modelling these effects has probably
consumed more research effort in the rotary-wing ﬁeld than any other topic, ranging
from simple momentum theory (Ref. 3.2) to three-dimensional ﬂowﬁeld solutions of
the viscous ﬂuid equations (Ref. 3.3).
The modelling requirements of blade motion and rotor downwash or inﬂow need
to be related to the application. The terms downwash and inﬂow are used synony-
mously in this book; in some references the inﬂow includes components of free stream
ﬂow relative to the rotor, and not just the self-induced downwash. The rule of thumb,
highlighted in Chapter 2, that models should be as simple as possible needs to be
borne in mind. We refer back to Fig. 2.14 in the Introductory Tour, reproduced here in
modiﬁed form (Fig. 3.3), to highlight the key dimensions – frequency and amplitude.
In ﬂight dynamics, a heuristic rule of thumb, which we shall work with, states that the

modelled frequency range in terms of forces and moments needs to extend to two or
three times the range at which normal pilot and control system activity occurs. If we
are solely concerned with the response to pilot control inputs for normal (correspond-
ing to gentle to moderate actions) frequencies up to about 4 rad/s, then achievement
of accuracy out to about 10 rad/s is probably good enough. With high gain feedback
control systems that will be operating up to this latter frequency, modelling out to
25–30 rad/s may be required. The principal reason for this extended range stems from
the fact that not only the controlled modes are of interest, but also the uncontrolled
modes, associated with the rotors, actuators and transmission system, that could poten-
tially lose stability in the striving to achieve high performance in the primary control
loops. The required range will depend on a number of detailed factors, and some of
these will emerge as we examine model ﬁdelity in this and the later chapters. With
respect to amplitude, the need to model gross manoeuvres deﬁnes the problem; in
other words, the horizontal axis in Fig. 3.3 extends outwards to the boundary of the
operational ﬂight envelope (OFE).
It is convenient to describe the different degrees of rotor complexity in three
levels, differentiated by the different application areas, as shown in Table 3.1.
Appended to the fuselage and drive system, basic Level 1 modelling deﬁnes the
conventional six degree of freedom (DoF) ﬂight mechanics formulation for the fuse-
lage, with the quasi-steady rotor taking up its new position relative to the fuselage
instantaneously. We have also included in this level the rotor DoFs in so-called multi-
blade coordinate form (see Section 3.2.1), whereby the rotor dynamics are consolidated
as a disc with coning and tilting freedoms. Perhaps the strongest distinguishing feature
of Level 1 models is the analytically integrated aerodynamic loads giving closed form

expressions for the hub forces and moments. The aerodynamic downwash representa-
tion in our Level 1 models extends from simple momentum to dynamic inﬂow.
The analysis of ﬂight dynamics problems through modelling is deferred until
Chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 3 deals with model building. For the most part, the model
elements are derived from approximations that allow analytic formulations. In this
sense, the modelling is far from state of the art, compared with current standards of
simulation modelling. This is particularly true regarding the rotor aerodynamics, but
the so-called Level 1 modelling described in this chapter is aimed at describing the key
features of helicopter ﬂight and the important trends in behaviour with varying design
parameters. In many cases, the simpliﬁed analytic modelling approximates reality to
within 20%, and while this would be clearly inadequate for design purposes, it is ideal
for establishing fundamental principles and trends.
There are three sections following. In Section 3.2, expressions for the forces and
moments acting on the various components of the helicopter are derived; the main rotor,
tail rotor, fuselage and empennage, powerplant and ﬂight control system are initially
considered in isolation, as far as this is possible. In Section 3.3, the combined forces
and moments on these elements are assembled with the inertial and gravitational forces
to form the overall helicopter equations of motion.
Section 3.4 of this chapter takes the reader brieﬂy beyond the realms of Level 1
modelling to the more detailed and higher ﬁdelity blade element and aeroelastic rotor
formulations and the complexities of interactional aerodynamic modelling. The ﬂight
regimes where this, Level 2, modelling is required are discussed, and results of the kind
of inﬂuence that aeroelasticity and detailed wake modelling have on ﬂight dynamics
are presented.
This chapter has an appendix concerned with deﬁning the motion of the aircraft
and rotor in terms of different axes systems as frames of reference. Section 3A.1 de-
scribestheinertialmotionofanaircraftasarigidbodyfreetomoveinthreetranslational
and three rotational DoFs. Sections 3A.2 and 3A.3 develop supporting results for the
orientation of the aircraft and the components of the gravitational force. Sections 3A.4
and 3A.5 focus on the rotor dynamics, deriving expressions for the acceleration and
velocity of a blade element and discussing different axes systems used in the literature
for describing the blade motion.
3.2
The Formulation of Helicopter Forces
and Moments in Level 1 Modelling
In the following four subsections, analytic expressions for the forces and moments on
the various helicopter components are derived. The forces and moments are referred
to a system of body-ﬁxed axes centred at the aircraft’s centre of gravity/mass, as
illustrated in Fig. 3.1. In general, the axes will be oriented at an angle relative to the
principal axes of inertia, with the x direction pointing forward along some convenient
fuselagereferenceline.TheequationsofmotionforthesixfuselageDoFsareassembled
by applying Newton’s laws of motion relating the applied forces and moments to
the resulting translational and rotational accelerations. Expressions for the inertial
velocities and accelerations in the fuselage-ﬁxed axes system are derived in Appendix
Section 3A.1, with the resulting equations of motion taking the classic form as given
below.

where the subscripts stand for: rotor, R; tail rotor, TR; fuselage, f; horizontal tailplane,

In Chapters 4 and 5, we shall be concerned with the trim, stability and response
solutions to eqns 3.1–3.6. Before we can address these issues we need to derive the
expressions for the component forces and moments. The following four sections con-
tain some fairly intense mathematical analyses for the reader who requires a deeper
understanding of the aeromechanics of helicopters. The modelling is based essentially
on the DRA’s ﬁrst generation, Level 1 simulation model Helisim (Ref. 3.4).
A few words on notation may be useful before we begin. First, the main rotor
analysis is conducted in shaft axes, compared with the rotor-aligned, no-ﬂapping or no-
feathering systems. Appendix Section 3A.5 gives a comparison of some expressions
in the three systems. Second, the reader will ﬁnd the same variable name used for
different states or parameters throughout the chapter. While the author accepts that
there is some risk of confusion here, this is balanced against the need to maintain
a degree of conformity with traditional practice. It is also expected that the serious
reader of Chapters 3, 4 and 5 will easily cope with any potential ambiguities. Hence,
for example, the variable r will be used for rotor radial position and aircraft yaw rate;
the variable β will be used for ﬂap angle and fuselage sideslip angle; the variable w
will be used for blade displacement and aircraft inertial velocity along the z direction.
A third point, and this applies more to the analysis of Chapters 4 and 5, relates to
the use of capitals or lowercase for trim and perturbation quantities. For the work in
the later modelling chapters we reserve capitals, with subscripts e (equilibrium), for
trim states and lowercase letters for perturbation variables in the linear analysis. In

Chapter 3, where, in general, we will be dealing with variables from a zero reference,
the conventional lowercase nomenclature is adopted. Possible ambiguities arise when
comparing analysis from Chapters 3, 4 and 5, although the author believes that the
scope for confusion is fairly minimal.
3.2.1
Main rotor
The mechanism of cyclic blade ﬂapping provides indirect control of the direction of the
rotor thrust and the rotor hub moments (i.e., the pilot has direct control only of blade
pitch), hence it is the primary source of manoeuvre capability. Blade ﬂap retention ar-
rangements are generally of three kinds – teetering, articulated and hingeless, or more
generally, bearingless (Fig. 3.4). The three different arrangements can appear very con-
trasting, but the amplitude of the ﬂapping motion itself, in response to gusts and control
inputs, is very similar. The primary difference lies in the hub moment capability. One of
the key features of the Helisim model family is the use of a common analogue model for

Blade ﬂapping dynamics – introduction
We begin with a closer examination of the hingeless rotor. Figure 3.5 illustrates the
out-of-plane bending, or ﬂapping, of a typical rotating blade cantilevered to the rotor

of motion for the out-of-plane deﬂexion w(r, t) takes the form of a partial differential
equation in space radius r and time t, and can be written (Ref. 3.5) as

where P1 is given by eqn 3.10 with n = 1. Equations 3.10 and 3.16 provide the so-
lution for the ﬁrst mode of ﬂapping response of a rotor blade. How well this will
approximate the complete solution for the blade response depends on the form of the
aerodynamic load F(r, t). From eqns 3.10 and 3.12, if the loading can be approximated
by a distribution with the same shape as S1, then the ﬁrst mode response would sufﬁce.
Clearly this is not generally the case, but the higher mode responses can be expected
to be less and less signiﬁcant. It will be shown that the ﬁrst mode frequency is always
close to one-per-rev, and combined with the predominant forcing at one-per-rev the
ﬁrst ﬂap mode generally does approximate the zero and one-per-rev blade dynamics
and hub moments reasonably well, for the frequency range of interest in ﬂight dynam-
ics. The approximate model used in the Helisim formulation simpliﬁes the ﬁrst mode
formulation even further to accommodate teetering and articulated rotors as well. The
articulation and elasticity is assumed to be concentrated in a hinged spring at the centre
of rotation (Fig. 3.6), otherwise the blade is straight and rigid; thus
S1 = r

Fig. 3.6 The centre-spring equivalent rotor analogue
Such a shape, although not orthogonal to the elastic modes, does satisfy eqn 3.11 in a
distributional sense. The centre-spring model is used below to represent all classes of
retention system and contrasts with the offset-hinge and spring model used in a number
of other studies. In the offset-hinge model, the hinge offset is largely determined from
the natural frequency whereas in the centre-spring model, the stiffness is provided by
the hinge spring. In many ways the models are equivalent, but they differ in some
important features. It will be helpful to derive some of the characteristics of blade
ﬂapping before we compare the effectiveness of the different formulations. Further
discussion is therefore deferred until later in this section.
The centre-spring equivalent rotor
Reference to Fig. 3.6 shows that the equation of motion for the blade ﬂap angle βi(t)

The blade radial distance has now been written with a subscript b to distinguish it
from similar variables. We have neglected the blade weight force in eqn 3.18; the
mean lift and acceleration forces are typically one or two orders of magnitude higher.
We follow the normal convention of setting the blade azimuth angle, ψ, to zero at
the rear of the disc, with a positive direction following the rotor. The analysis in this
book applies to a rotor rotating anticlockwise when viewed from above. From Fig.
3.7, the aerodynamic load fz(rb, t) can be written in terms of the lift and drag forces
as
fz = −ℓcos φ −d sin φ ≈−ℓ−dφ
(3.19)
where φ is the incidence angle between the rotor inﬂow and the plane normal to the rotor
shaft. We are now working in the blade axes system, of course, as deﬁned in Section
3A.4, where the z direction lies normal to the plane of no-pitch. The acceleration normal
to the blade element, azb, includes the component of the gyroscopic effect due to the

The angular velocities and accelerations have been referred to hub–wind axes in this
formulation, and hence the subscript hw. Before expanding and reducing the hub
moment in eqn 3.18 further, we need to review the range of approximations to be made
fortheaerodynamicliftforce.Theaerodynamicloadsareingeneralunsteady,nonlinear
and three-dimensional in character; our ﬁrst approximation neglects these effects, and,
in a wide range of ﬂight cases, the approximations lead to a reasonable prediction of the
overall behaviour of the rotor. So, our starting aerodynamic assumptions are as follows:
(1) The rotor lift force is a linear function of local blade incidence and the drag force is a
simple quadratic function of lift – both with constant coefﬁcients. Neglecting blade
stall and compressibility can have a signiﬁcant effect on the prediction of performance
and dynamic behaviour at high forward speeds. Figure 2.10 illustrated the proximity
of the local blade incidence to stall particularly at rotor azimuth angles 90◦and 180◦.
Without these effects modelled, the rotor will be able to continue developing lift at
low drag beyond the stall and drag divergence boundary, which is clearly unrealistic.
The assumption of constant lift curve slope neglects the linear spanwise and
one-per-rev timewise variations due to compressibility effects. The former can be
accounted for to some extent by an effective rotor lift curve slope, particularly at low
speed, but the azimuthal variations give rise to changes in cyclic and collective trim
control angles in forward ﬂight, which the constant linear model cannot simulate.
(2) Unsteady (i.e., frequency dependent) aerodynamic effects are ignored. Rotor unsteady
aerodynamic effects can be conveniently divided into two problems – one involves the
calculation of the response of the rotor blade lift and pitching moment to changes in
local incidence, while the other involves the calculation of the unsteady local
incidence due to the time variations of the rotor wake velocities. Both require
additional DoFs to be taken into account. While the unsteady wake effects are

 
98
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
accounted for in a relatively crude but effective manner through the local/dynamic
inﬂow theory described in this section, the time-dependent developments of blade lift
and pitching moment are ignored, resulting in a small phase shift of rotor response to
disturbances.
(3) Tip losses and root cut-out effects are ignored. The lift on a rotor blade reduces to zero
at the blade tip and at the root end of the lifting portion of the blade. These effects can be
accounted for when the fall-off is properly modelled at the root and tip, but an alternative
is to carry out the load integrations between an effective root and tip. A tip loss factor
of about 3% R is commonly used, while integrating from the start of the lifting blade
accounts for most of the root loss. Both effects are small and accounts for only a few per
cent of performance and response. Including them in the analysis increases the length
of the equations signiﬁcantly however, and can obscure some of the more signiﬁcant
effects. In the analysis that follows, we therefore omit these loss terms, recognizing
that to achieve accurate predictions of power, for example, they need to be included.
(4) Non-uniform spanwise inﬂow distribution is neglected. The assumption
of uniform inﬂow is a gross simpliﬁcation, even in the hover, of the complex effects of
the rotor wake, but provides a very effective approximation for predicting power and
thrust. The use of uniform inﬂow stems from the assumption that the rotor is designed
to develop minimum induced drag, and hence has ideal blade twist. In such an ideal
case, the circulation would be constant along the blade span, with the only induced
losses emanating from the tip and root vortices. Ideal twist, for a constant chord blade,
is actually inversely proportional to radius, and the linear twist angles of O(10◦),
found on most helicopters, give a reasonable, if not good, approximation to the effects
of ideal twist over the outer lifting portion of the blades. The actual non-uniformity of
the inﬂow has a similar shape to the bound circulation, increasing outboard and giving
rise to an increase in drag compared with the uniform inﬂow theory. The blade pitch
at the outer stations of a real blade will need to be increased relative to the uniform
inﬂow blade to produce the same lift. This increase produces more lift inboard as well,
and the resulting comparison of trim control angles may not be signiﬁcantly different.
(5) Reversed ﬂow effects are ignored. The reversed ﬂow region occupies
the small disc inboard on the retreating side of the disc, where the air ﬂows over
the blades from trailing to leading edge. Up to moderate forward speeds, the extent of
this region is small and the associated dynamic pressures low, justifying its omission
from the analysis of rotor forces. At higher speeds, the importance of the reversed
ﬂow region increases, resulting in an increment to the collective pitch required
to provide the rotor thrust, but decreasing the proﬁle drag and hence rotor torque.
These approximations make it possible to derive manageable analytic expressions for
the ﬂapping and rotor loads. Referring to Fig. 3.7, the aerodynamic loads can be written
in the form

We have made the assumption that the blade proﬁle drag coefﬁcient δ can be written
in terms of a mean value plus a thrust-dependent term to account for blade incidence
changes (Refs 3.6, 3.7). The non-dimensional in-plane and normal velocity components
can be written as
U T = rb(1 + ωxβ) + µ sin ψ
(3.24)
UP = (µz −λ0 −βµ cos ψ) + rb(ωy −β′ −λ1)

The velocities uhw, vhw and whw are the hub velocities in the hub–wind system,
oriented relative to the aircraft x-axis by the relative airspeed or wind direction in the
x–y plane. β is the blade ﬂap angle and θ is the blade pitch angle. The fuselage angular
velocity components in the blade system, normalized by R, are given by
ωx = phw cos ψi −qhw sin ψi
ωy = phw sin ψi + qhw cos ψi
(3.29)
The downwash, λ, normal to the plane of the rotor disc, is written in the form of a
uniform and linearly varying distribution
λ = vi
R = λ0 + λ1(ψ)rb

This simple formulation will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
We can now develop and expand eqn 3.18 to give the second-order differential

These aerodynamic coefﬁcients have been expanded up to O(µ2); neglecting higher
order terms incurs errors of less than 10% in the ﬂap response below µ of about 0.35. In
Chapter 2, the Introductory Tour of this subject, we examined the solution of eqn 3.34
at the hover condition. The behaviour was discussed in some depth there, and to avoid
duplication of the associated analysis we shall restrict ourselves to a short r´esum´e of
the key points from the material in Chapter 2.
(1) The blade ﬂap response is dominated by the centrifugal stiffness, so that the natural
frequency is always close to one-per-rev; even on hingeless rotors like the Lynx and
Bo105, the ﬂap frequency ratio, λβ, is only about 10% higher than for a teetering
rotor.
(2) The ﬂap response to cyclic pitch is close to phase resonance, and hence is about 90◦
out of phase with the pitch control input; the stiffer the rotor, the smaller the phase

101
lag, but even the Lynx, with its moderately stiff rotor, has about 80◦of lag between
cyclic pitch and ﬂap. The phase lag is proportional to the stiffness number (effectively
the ratio of stiffness to blade aerodynamic moment), given by
Sβ = 8

λ2
β −1
γ

(3.40)
(3) There is a fundamental rotor resistance to fuselage rotations, due to the aerodynamic
damping and gyroscopic forces. Rotating the fuselage with a pitch (q) or roll (p) rate
leads to a disc rotation lagged behind the fuselage motion by a time given
approximately by (see eqn 2.43)
τβ = 16
γ 
(3.41)
Hence the faster the rotorspeed, or the lighter the blades, for example, the higher is the
rotor damping and the faster is the disc response to control inputs or fuselage
motion.
(4) The rotor hub stiffness moment is proportional to the product of the spring strength
and the ﬂap angle; teetering rotors cannot therefore produce a hub moment, and
hingeless rotors, as on the Bo105 and the Lynx, can develop hub moments about four
times those for typical articulated rotors.
(5) The increased hub moment capability of hingeless rotors transforms into increased
control sensitivity and damping and hence greater responsiveness at the expense of
greater sensitivity to extraneous inputs such as gusts. The control power, or ﬁnal
steady-state rate per degree of cyclic, is independent of rotor stiffness to ﬁrst order,
since it is derived from the ratio of control sensitivity to damping, both of which
increase in the same proportion with rotor stiffness.
(6) The ﬂapping of rotors with Stiffness numbers up to about 0.3 is very similar – e.g.,
approximately 1◦ﬂap for 1◦cyclic pitch.
The behaviour of a rotor with Nb blades will be described by the solution of a set of
uncoupled differential equations of the form eqn 3.34, phased relative to each other.
However, the wake and swash plate dynamics will couple implicitly the blade dynam-
ics. We return to this aspect later, but for the moment, assume a decoupled system.
Each equation has periodic coefﬁcients in the forward ﬂight case, but is linear in the
ﬂap DoFs (once again ignoring the effects of wake inﬂow). In Chapter 2, we examined
the hover case and assumed that the blade dynamics were fast relative to the fuselage
motion, hence enabling the approximation that the blade motion was essentially pe-
riodic with slowly varying coefﬁcients. The rotor blades were effectively operating
in two timescales, one associated with the rotor rotational speed and the other asso-
ciated with the slower fuselage motion. Through this approximation, we were able
to deduce many fundamental facets of rotor behaviour as noted above. It was also
highlighted that the approximation breaks down when the frequencies of the rotor and
fuselage modes approached one another, as can happen, for example, with hingeless
rotors. This quasi-steady approximation can be approached from a more general per-
spective in the forward ﬂight case by employing the so-called multi-blade coordinates
(Refs 3.4, 3.8).

Once again, the reference zero angle for blade 1 is at the rear of the disc. The MBCs
can be viewed as disc mode shapes (Fig. 3.8). The ﬁrst, β0, is referred to as coning –
all the blades ﬂap together in a cone. The ﬁrst two cyclic modes β1c and β1s represent
ﬁrst harmonic longitudinal and lateral disc tilts, while the higher harmonics appear
as a disc warping. For Nb = 4, the oddest mode of all is the differential coning, β0d,
which can be visualized as a mode with opposite pairs of blades moving in unison, but

Fig. 3.8 The rotor disc in multi-blade coordinates
in opposition to neighbour pairs, as shown in Fig. 3.8. The transformation to MBCs
has not involved any approximation; there are the same number of MBCs as there are
IBCs, and the individual blade motions can be completely reconstituted from the MBC
motions. There is one other important aspect that is worth highlighting. MBCs are not
strictly equivalent to the harmonic coefﬁcients in a Fourier expansion of the blade angle.
In general, each blade will be forced and will respond with higher than a one-per-rev
component (e.g., two-, three- and four-per-rev), yet with Nb = 3, only ﬁrst harmonic
MBCs will exist; the higher harmonics are then folded into the ﬁrst harmonics. The
real beneﬁt of MBCs emerges when we conduct the coordinate transformation Lβ on
the uncoupled individual blade eqns 3.34, written in matrix form as
β′′

I + DI (ψ)βI = HI (ψ)

The MBC system described by eqn 3.51 can be distinguished from the IBC system
in two important ways. First, the equations are now coupled, and second, the periodic
terms in the coefﬁcient matrices no longer contain ﬁrst harmonic terms but have the
lowest frequency content at Nb/2 per-rev (i.e., two for a four-bladed rotor). A common
approximation is to neglect these terms, hence reducing eqn 3.51 to a set of ordinary
differential equations with constant coefﬁcients that can then be appended to the fuse-
lage equations of motion allowing the wide range of linear stationary stability analysis
tools to be brought to bear. In the absence of periodic terms, MBC equations take the
form
β′′M + CM0β′M + DM0βM = HM0(ψ)

The two modes have been described as the ﬂap precession (or regressing ﬂap mode)
and nutation (or advancing ﬂap mode) to highlight the analogy with a gyroscope;
both have the same damping factor as the coning mode but their frequencies are widely
separated, the precession lying approximately at (λβ −1) and the nutation well beyond
this at (λβ + 1). While the nutation ﬂap mode is unlikely to couple with the fuselage
motions, the regressing ﬂap mode frequency can be of the same order as the highest
frequency fuselage modes. An often used approximation to this mode assumes that
the inertia terms are zero and that the simpler, ﬁrst-order formulation is adequate for
describing the rotor ﬂap as described in Chapter 2 (eqn 2.40). The motion tends to be
more strongly coupled with the roll axis because of the lower time constant associated
with roll than with pitch motion. The roll to pitch time constants are scaled by the ratio
of the roll to pitch moment of inertia, a parameter with a typical value of about 0.25.
We shall return to this approximation later in this chapter and in Chapter 5.

Fig. 3.9 Eigenvalues of a multi-blade coordinate rotor system
The differential coning is of little interest to us, except in the reconstruction of the
individual blade motions; each pair of blade exerts the same effective load on the rotor
hub, making this motion reactionless. Ignoring this mode, we see that the quasi-steady
motion of the coning and cyclic ﬂapping modes can be derived from eqn 3.55 and
written in vector–matrix form as

showing the strong dependence of rotor ﬂap damping on Lock number, compared with
the weak dependence of ﬂap response due to both control and shaft angular motion on
rotor stiffness. To emphasize the point, we can conclude that conventional rotor types
from teetering to hingeless, all ﬂap in much the same way. Of course, a hingeless rotor
will not need to ﬂap nearly as much and the pilot might be expected to make smaller
control inputs than with an articulated rotor, to produce the same hub moment and
hence to ﬂy the same manoeuvre.
The coupled rotor–body motions, whether quasi-steady or with ﬁrst- or second-
order ﬂapping dynamics, are formed from coupling the hub motions with the rotor and
driving the hub, and hence the fuselage, with the rotor forces. The expressions for the
hub forces and moments in MBC form will now be derived.
Rotor forces and moments

with Fig. 3.10, we note that the hub forces in the hub–wind frame can be written as

with overall inﬂow angle assumed small, so that

This pair of normal and in-plane forces will produce vibratory (i.e., harmonics of

The effective blade incidence angles are given by

(3.99)
The foregoing expressions for the rotor forces highlight that in the non-rotating hub–
wind–shaft axes system, a multitude of physical effects combine to produce the resul-
tants. While the normal force, the rotor thrust, is given by a relatively simple equation,
the in-plane forces are very complex indeed. However, some physical interpretation can
be made. The F(1)
0 β1cw and F(1)
1c β0 components are the ﬁrst harmonics of the product
of the lift and ﬂapping in the direction of motion and represent the contribution to X
and Y from blades in the fore and aft positions. The terms F(2)
1s and F(2)
1c represent the
contributions to X and Y from the induced and proﬁle drag acting on the advancing and
retreating blades. In hover, the combination of these effects reduces to the simple result
that the in-plane contributions from the blade lift forces cancel, and the hub forces are
given entirely by the tilt of the rotor thrust vector, i.e.,
Cxw = CT β1cw
(3.100)
Cyw = −CT β1sw
(3.101)
The assumption that the rotor thrust is normal to the disc throughout the ﬂight envelope
provides a common approximation in helicopter ﬂight dynamics, effectively ignoring
the many small contributions of the blade lift to the rotor in-plane forces given in the
above equations. The approximation fails to model many effects however, particularly
in lateral trims and dynamics. As an illustration, Fig. 3.11(a) shows a comparison
of the rotor Y force in trim as a function of ﬂight speed for the Helisim Bo105; the
disc tilt approximation is grossly in error. The corresponding lateral cyclic comparison
is shown in Fig. 3.11(b), indicating that the effect of the approximation on lateral
trim is actually less signiﬁcant. The disc tilt approximation is weakest in manoeuvres,
particularly for teetering rotors or articulated rotors with small ﬂapping hinge offsets,
when the damping moment is dominated by the rotor lateral force rather than the hub
moments. The most signiﬁcant of the 3.90 series of equations is the ﬁrst, the zeroth
harmonic rotor thrust that appears in normalized form in eqn 3.90 itself. This simple
equation is one of the most important in helicopter ﬂight dynamics and we will return
to it for more discussion when we explore the rotor downwash in the next section. To
complete this rather lengthy derivation of the rotor forces and moments, we need to
orient the hub–wind force components into shaft axes and derive the hub moments.
Using the transformation matrix derived in the Appendix, Section 3A.4, namely

of the ﬂapping for the different rotor types, that produces the greater hub moments with
hingeless rotors.
Rotor torque
The remaining moment produced by the rotor is the rotor torque and this produces a
dominant component about the shaft axis, plus smaller components in pitch and roll
due to the inclination of the disc to the plane normal to the shaft. Referring to Fig. 3.10,
the torque moment, approximated by the yawing moment in the hub–wind axes, can
be obtained by integrating the moments of the in-plane loads about the shaft axis

The rotor disc tilt relative to the shaft results in components of the torque in the roll and
pitch directions. Once again, only one-per-rev roll and pitch moments in the rotating
frame of reference will transform through as steady moments in the hub–wind axes.
Neglecting the harmonics of rotor torque, we see that the hub moments can therefore
be approximated by the orientation of the steady torque through the one-per-rev disc

We shall return to the discussion of hub forces and moments later in Section 3.4 and
Chapter 4. We still have considerable modelling ground to cover however, not only for
the different helicopter components, but also with the main rotor to cover the details
of the ‘inner’ dynamic elements. First, we take a closer look at rotor inﬂow.
Rotor inﬂow
The rotor inﬂow is the name given to the ﬂowﬁeld induced by the rotor at the rotor
disc, thus contributing to the local blade incidence and dynamic pressure. In general,
the induced ﬂow at the rotor consists of components due to the shed vorticity from all
the blades, extending into the far wake of the aircraft. To take account of these effects
fully, a complex vortex wake, distorted by itself and the aircraft motion would need
to be modelled. We shall assume that for ﬂight dynamics analysis it is sufﬁcient to
consider the normal component of inﬂow, i.e., the rotor-induced downwash. We shall

 
116
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 3.12 Rotor ﬂow states in axial motion: (a) hover; (b) climb; (c) descent
also make a number of fairly gross assumptions about the rotor and the character of the
ﬂuid motion in the wake in order to derive relatively simple formula for the downwash.
The use of approximations to the rotor wake for ﬂight dynamics applications has been
the subject of two fairly comprehensive reviews of rotor inﬂow (Refs 3.9, 3.10), which
deal with both quasi-static and dynamic effects; the reader is directed towards these
works to gain a deeper understanding of the historical development of inﬂow modelling
within the broader context of wake analysis. The simplest representation of the rotor
wake is based on actuator disc theory, a mathematical artifact effectively representing
a rotor with inﬁnite number of blades, able to accelerate the air through the disc and
to support a pressure jump across it. We begin by considering the rotor in axial ﬂight.
Momentum theory for axial ﬂight
Figures 3.12 (a)–(c) illustrate the ﬂow states for the rotor in axial motion, i.e., when the
resultant ﬂow is always normal to the rotor disc, corresponding to hover, climbing or
descending ﬂight. The ﬂow is assumed to be steady, inviscid and incompressible with
a well-deﬁned slipstream between the ﬂowﬁeld generated by the actuator disc (i.e.,
streamtube extending to inﬁnity) and the external ﬂow. Physically, this last condition
is violated in descending ﬂight when the ﬂow is required to turn back on itself; we
shall return to this point later. A further assumption we will make is that the pressure
in the far wake returns to atmospheric. These assumptions are discussed in detail by
Bramwell (Ref. 3.6) and Johnson (Ref. 3.7), and will not be laboured here. The simplest
theory that allows us to derive the relationship between rotor thrust and torque and the
rotor inﬂow is commonly known as momentum theory, utilizing the conservation laws
of mass, momentum and energy. Our initial theoretical development will be based on
the so-called global momentum theory, which assumes that the inﬂow is uniformly
distributed over the rotor disc. Referring to Fig. 3.12, we note that T is the rotor thrust,
v the velocity at various stations in the streamtube, vi the inﬂow at the disc, Vc the
climb velocity and Vd the rotor descent velocity.
First, we shall consider the hover and climb states (Figs 3.12(a), (b)). If ˙m is the
mass ﬂow rate (constant at each station) and Ad the rotor disc area, then we can write
the mass ﬂow through the rotor as
˙m = ρ Ad(Vc + vi)
(3.119)

The rate of change of momentum between the undisturbed upstream conditions and
the far wake can be equated to the rotor loading to give
T = ˙m(Vc + vi∞) −˙mVc = ˙mvi∞
(3.120)
where Vi∞is the induced ﬂow in the fully developed wake.
The change in kinetic energy of the ﬂow can be related to the work done by the
rotor (actuator disc); thus

From these relationships we can deduce that the induced velocity in the far wake is
accelerated to twice the rotor inﬂow, i.e.,
vi∞= 2vi
(3.122)
The expression for the rotor thrust can now be written directly in terms of the conditions
at the rotor disc; hence
T = 2pAd(Vc + vi)vi
(3.123)
Writing the inﬂow in normalized form

The case of vertical descent is more complicated. Strictly, the ﬂow state satisﬁes the
requirements for the application of momentum theory only in conditions where the
wake is fully established above the rotor and the ﬂow is upwards throughout the
streamtube. This rotor condition is called the windmill brake state, in recognition of
the similarity to a windmill, which extracts energy from the air (Fig. 3.12(c)). The
work done by the rotor on the air is now negative and, following a similar analysis to
that for the climb, the rotor thrust can be written as
T = 2ρ Ad(Vd −vi)vi
(3.130)
The inﬂow at the disc in the windmill brake state can therefore be written as

The ‘physical’ solutions of eqns 3.128 and 3.131 are shown plotted as the full lines in
Fig. 3.13. The dashed lines correspond to the ‘unrealistic’ solutions. These solutions
include descent rates from hover through to the windmill brake condition, thus encom-
passing the so-called ideal autorotation condition when the inﬂow equals the descent
rate. This region includes the vortex-ring condition where the wake beneath the rotor
becomes entrained in the air moving upwards relative to the rotor outside the wake
and, in turn, becoming part of the inﬂow above the rotor again. This circulating ﬂow
forms a toroidal-shaped vortex which has a very non-uniform and unsteady charac-
ter, leading to large areas of high inﬂow in the centre of the disc and stall outboard.
The vortex-ring condition is not amenable to modelling via momentum considerations
alone. However, there is evidence that the mean inﬂow at the rotor can be approximated
by a semi-empirical shaping function linking the helicopter and windmill rotor states
shown in Fig. 3.13. The linear approximations suggested by Young (Ref. 3.11) are

One of the important features of approximations like Young’s is that they enable an
estimate of the induced velocity in ideal autorotation to be derived. It should be noted
that the dashed curve obtained from the momentum solution in Fig. 3.13 never actually
crosses the autorotation line. Young’s approximation estimates that the autorotation
line is crossed at

As pointed out by Bramwell (Ref. 3.6), the rotor thrust in this condition equates to the
drag of a circular plate of the same diameter as the rotor, i.e., the rotor is descending
with a rate of descent similar to that of a parachute.
Momentum theory in forward ﬂight
In high-speed ﬂight the downwash ﬁeld of a rotor is similar to that of a ﬁxed-wing
aircraft with circular planform and the momentum approximations for deriving the
induced ﬂow at the wing apply (Ref. 3.13). Figure 3.14 illustrates the ﬂow streamtube,
with freestream velocity V at angle of incidence α to the disc, and the actuator disc
inducing a velocity vi at the rotor. The induced ﬂow in the far wake is again twice the
ﬂow at the rotor (wing) and the conservation laws give the mass ﬂux as
˙m = ρAdVres
(3.136)

and hence the rotor thrust (or wing lift) as

(3.137)
where the resultant velocity at the rotor is given by
V 2

and where αd is the disc incidence, shown in Fig. 3.14. Strictly, eqn 3.139 applies to
high-speed ﬂight, where the downwash velocities are much smaller than in hover, but
it can be seen that the solution also reduces to the cases of hover and axial motion in
the limit when µ = 0. In fact, this general equation is a reasonable approximation to
the mean value of rotor inﬂow across a wide range of ﬂight conditions, including steep
descent, and also provides an estimate of the induced power required.

showing the dependence on the square root of disc loading in hover, and proportional
to disc loading in forward ﬂight.
Between hover and µ values of about 0.1 (about 40 knots for Lynx), the mean
normal component of the rotor wake velocities is still high, but now gives rise to
fairly strong non-uniformities along the longitudinal, or, more generally, the ﬂight
axis of the disc. Several approximations to this non-uniformity were derived in the
early developments of rotor aerodynamic theory using the vortex form of actuator disc
theory (Refs 3.14–3.16). It was shown that a good approximation to the inﬂow could
be achieved with a ﬁrst harmonic with a linear variation along the disc determined by
the wake angle relative to the disc, given by

of the free stream relative to the rotor. The solution curves for the (non-physical)
vertical descent cases are included. It can be seen that the non-uniform component is
approximately equal to the uniform component in high-speed straight and level ﬂight,
i.e., the inﬂow is zero at the front of the disc. In low-speed steep descent, the non-
uniform component varies strongly with speed and is also of similar magnitude to the
uniform component. Longitudinal variations in blade incidence lead to ﬁrst harmonic

simple uniform/non-uniform inﬂow model given above begins to account for some
of these effects (e.g., power settling, Ref. 3.18) but cannot be regarded as a proper
representation of either the causal physics or ﬂight dynamics effects; in particular, the
dramatic loss of control power caused by the build up of the toroidal vortex ring is not
captured by the simple model, and recourse to empiricism is required to model this
effect. An effective analysis to predict the boundaries of the vortex-ring state, using
momentum theory, was conducted in the early 1970s (Ref. 3.19) and extended in the
1990s using classical vortex theory (Ref. 3.20). Wolkovitch’s results are summarized in
Fig.3.16,showingthepredictedupperandlowerboundariesasafunctionofnormalized
horizontal velocity; the so-called region of roughness measured previously by Drees
(Ref. 3.21) is also shown. The parameter k shown on Fig. 3.16 is an empirical constant
scaling the downward velocity of the wake vorticity. The lower boundary is set at
a value of k < 2, i.e., before the wake is fully contracted, indicating breakdown of
the protective tube of vorticity a ﬁnite distance below the rotor. Knowledge of the
boundary locations is valuable for including appropriate ﬂags in simulation models
(e.g., Helisim). Once again though, the simple momentum and vortex theories are
inadequate at modelling the ﬂow and predicting ﬂight dynamics within the vortex-ring
region. We shall return to this topic in Chapters 4 and 5 when discussing trim and control
response.
The momentum theory used to formulate the expressions for the rotor inﬂow
is strictly applicable only in steady ﬂight when the rotor is trimmed and in slowly
varying conditions. We can, however, gain an appreciation of the effects of inﬂow on
rotor thrust during manoeuvres through the concept of the lift deﬁciency function (Ref.
3.7). When the rotor thrust changes, the inﬂow changes in sympathy, increasing for
increasing thrust and decreasing for decreasing thrust. Considering the thrust changes

as perturbations on the mean component, we can write
δCT = δCT QS +

and where the quasi-steady thrust coefﬁcient changes without change in the inﬂow.

δλi = ∂λi

Combining these relationships, we can write the thrust changes as the product of a
deﬁciency function and the quasi-steady thrust change, i.e.,
δCT = C′δCTQS
(3.151)
where
C′ =

(3.152)
and
C′ =

(3.153)
Rotor thrust changes are therefore reduced to about 60–70% in hover and 80% in the
mid-speed range due to the effects of inﬂow. This would apply, for example, to the thrust
changes due to control inputs. It is important to note that these deﬁciency functions do
not apply to the thrust changes from changes in rotor velocities. In particular, when the
vertical velocity component changes, there are additional inﬂow perturbations that lead
to even further lift reductions. In hover, the deﬁciency function for vertical velocity
changes is half that due to collective pitch changes, i.e.,
C′
µz = C′
2 ,
µ = 0
(3.154)
In forward ﬂight the lift loss is recovered and eqn 3.151 also applies to the
vertical velocity perturbations. This simple analysis demonstrates how the gust

 
124

sensitivity of rotors increases strongly from hover to mid speed, but levels out to the
constant quasi-steady value at high speed (see discussion on vertical gust response in
Chapter 2).
Because the inﬂow depends on the thrust and the thrust depends on the inﬂow, an
iterative solution is required. Deﬁning the zero function g0 as

For most ﬂight conditions the above scheme should provide rapid estimates of the
inﬂow at time t j+1 from a knowledge of conditions at time t j. The stability of the
algorithm is determined by the variation of the function g0 and the initial value of λ0.
However, in certain ﬂight conditions near the hover, the iteration can diverge, and the
damping constant f is included to stabilize the calculation; a value of 0.6 for f appears
to be a reasonable compromise between achieving stability and rapid convergence
(Ref. 3.4).
A further approximation involved in the above inﬂow formulation is the assump-
tion that the freestream velocity component normal to the disc (i.e., V sin αd) is the
same as µz. This is a reasonable approximation for small ﬂapping angles, and even
for the larger angles typical of low-speed manoeuvres the errors are small because
of the insensitivity of the inﬂow to disc incidence (see Fig. 3.15). The approximation
is convenient because there is no requirement to know the disc tilt or rotor ﬂapping
relative to the shaft to compute the inﬂow, hence leading to a further simpliﬁcation in
the iteration procedure.

The simple momentum inﬂow derived above is effective in predicting the gross
and slowly varying uniform and rectangular, wake-induced, inﬂow components. In
practice, the inﬂow distribution varies with ﬂight condition and unsteady rotor loading
(e.g., in manoeuvres) in a much more complex manner. Intuitively, we can imagine the
inﬂow varying around the disc and along the blades, continuously satisfying local ﬂow
balance conditions and conservation principles. Locally, the ﬂow must respond to local
changes in blade loading, so if, for example, there are one-per-rev rotor forces and mo-
ments, we might expect the inﬂow to be related to these. We can also expect the inﬂow
to take a ﬁnite time to develop as the air mass is accelerated to its new velocity. Also,
the rotor wake is far more complex and discrete than the uniform ﬂow in a streamtube
assumption of momentum theory. It is known that local blade–vortex interactions can
cause very large local perturbations in blade inﬂow and hence incidence. These can be
sufﬁcient to stall the blade in certain conditions and are important for predicting rotor
stall boundaries and the resulting ﬂight dynamics at the ﬂight envelope limits. We shall
return to this last topic later in the discussion on advanced, high-ﬁdelity modelling.
Before leaving inﬂow however, we shall examine the theoretical developments needed
to improve the prediction of the non-uniform and unsteady components.
Local-differential momentum theory and dynamic inﬂow
We begin by considering the simple momentum theory applied to the rotor disc element
shown in Fig. 3.17. We make the gross assumption that the relationship between the
change in momentum and the work done by the load across the element applies locally
as well as globally, giving the equations for the mass ﬂow through the element and the
thrust differential as shown in eqns 3.161 and 3.162.

Fig. 3.17 Local momentum theory applied to a rotor disc

 
126
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Integrating around the disc and along the blades leads to the solution for the mean
uniform component of inﬂow derived earlier. If, instead of averaging the load around
the disc, we apply the momentum balance to the one-per-rev components of the load
and inﬂow, then expressions for the non-uniform inﬂow can be derived. Writing the
ﬁrst harmonic inﬂow in the form
λi = λ0 + rb(λ1c cos ψ + λ1s sin ψ)
(3.164)
eqn 3.163 can be expanded to give a ﬁrst harmonic balance which, in hover, results in
the expressions
λ1c = 3a0s

where the F loadings are given by eqns 3.92 and 3.93. These one-per-rev lift forces
are closely related to the aerodynamic moments at the hub in the non-rotating fuselage
frame – the pitching moment CMa and the rolling moment CLa, i.e.,

These hub moments are already functions of the non-uniform inﬂow distributions;
hence, just as with the rotor thrust and the uniform inﬂow, we ﬁnd that the moments
are reduced by a similar moment deﬁciency factor

As the rotor blade develops an aerodynamic moment, the ﬂowﬁeld responds with the
linear, harmonic distributions derived above. The associated deﬁciency factors have
often been cited as the cause of mismatches between theory and test (Refs 3.9,3.22–
3.29), and there is no doubt that the resulting overall effects on ﬂight dynamics can
be signiﬁcant. The assumptions are fragile however, and the theory can, at best, be
regarded as providing a very approximate solution to a complex problem. More recent
developments, with more detailed spatial and temporal inﬂow distributions, are likely
to offer even higher ﬁdelity in rotor modelling (see Pitt and Peters, Ref 3.26, and the
series of Peters’ papers from 1983, Refs 3.27–3.29).
The inﬂow analysis outlined above has ignored any time dependency other than
the quasi-steady effects and harmonic variations. In reality, there will always be a
transient lag in the build-up or decay of the inﬂow ﬁeld; in effect, the ﬂow is a dynamic
element in its own right. An extension of momentum theory has also been made to
include the dynamics of an ‘apparent’ mass of ﬂuid, ﬁrst by Carpenter and Fridovitch
in 1953 (Ref. 3.30). To introduce this theory, we return to axial ﬂight; Carpenter and
Fridovitch suggested that the transient inﬂow could be taken into account by including
an accelerated mass of air occupying 63.7% of the air mass of the circumscribed
sphere of the rotor. Thus, we write the thrust balancing the mass ﬂow through the rotor
to include an apparent mass term
T = 0.637ρ 4
3π R3vi + 2Adρvi(Vc + vi)
(3.175)
To understand how this additional effect contributes to the motion, we can linearize
eqn 3.175 about a steady hover trim; writing
λi = λitrim + δλi
(3.176)
and
CT = CTtrim + δCT
(3.177)
the perturbation equation takes the form
τλ˙λi + δλi = λCT δCT
(3.178)
where the time constant and the steady-state inﬂow gain are given by
τλ =

For typical rotors, moderately loaded in the hover, the time constant for the uniform
inﬂow works out at about 0.1 s. The time taken for small adjustments in uniform

 
128

inﬂow is therefore very rapid, according to simple momentum considerations, but this
estimate is clearly a linear function of the ‘apparent mass’. Since this early work, the
concept of dynamic inﬂow has been developed by a number of researchers, but it is the
work of Peters, stemming from the early Ref. 3.23 and continuing through to Ref. 3.29,
that has provided the most coherent perspective on the subject from a ﬂuid mechanics
standpoint. The general formulation of a 3-DoF dynamic inﬂow model can be written

The matrices M and L are the apparent mass and gain functions respectively; CT ,
CL and CM are the thrust, rolling and pitching aerodynamic moment perturbations
inducing the uniform and ﬁrst harmonic inﬂow changes. The mass and gain matrices
can be derived from a number of different theories (e.g., actuator disc, vortex theory).
In the most recent work, Peters has extended the modelling to an unsteady three-
dimensional ﬁnite-state wake (Ref. 3.29) which embraces the traditional theories of
Theordorsen and Lowey (Ref. 3.31). Dynamic inﬂow will be discussed again in the
context of stability and control derivatives in Chapter 4, and the reader is referred to
Refs 3.28 and 3.29 for full details of the aerodynamic theory.
Before discussing additional rotor dynamic DoFs and progressing on to other
helicopter components, we return to the centre-spring model for a further examination
of its merits as a general approximation.
Rotor ﬂapping–further considerations of the centre-spring approximation
The centre-spring equivalent rotor, a rigid blade analogue for modelling all types of
blade ﬂap retention systems, was originally proposed by Sissingh (Ref. 3.32) and has
considerable appeal because of the relatively simple expressions, particularly for hub
moments, that result. However, even for moderately stiff hingeless rotors like those
on the Lynx and Bo105, the blade shape is rather a gross approximation to the elastic
deformation, and a more common approximation used to model such blades is the
offset-hinge and spring analogue originally introduced by Young (Ref. 3.33). Figure
3.18 illustrates the comparison between the centre-spring, offset-hinge and spring and a
typical ﬁrst elastic mode shape. Young proposed a method for determining the values of
offset-hinge and spring strength, the latter from the non-rotating natural ﬂap frequency,
which is then made up with the offset to match the rotating frequency. The ratio of
offset to spring strength is not unique and other methods for establishing the mix have
been proposed; for example, Bramwell (Ref. 3.34) derives an expression for the offset
e in terms of the ﬁrst elastic mode frequency ratio λ1 in the form
e = λ2
1 −1
λ1
(3.181)
with the spring strength in this case being zero. In Reichert’s method (Ref. 3.35), the
offset hinge is located by extending the ﬁrst mode tip tangent to meet the undeformed
reference line. The ﬁrst elastic mode frequency is then made up with the addition of a
spring, which can have a negative stiffness. Approximate modelling options therefore
range from the centre spring out to Bramwell’s limit with no spring. The questions

that naturally arise are, ﬁrst, whether these different options are equivalent or what are
the important differences in the modelling of ﬂapping motion and hub moments, and
second, which is the most appropriate model for ﬂight dynamics applications? We will
try to address these questions in the following discussion.
We refer to the analysis of elastic blade ﬂapping at the beginning of Chapter 3

The hub moment given by eqn 3.184 is clearly in phase with the blade tip deﬂection.
However, a more detailed analysis of the dynamics of the offset-hinge model developed
by Bramwell (Ref. 3.34) reveals that this simple phase relationship is not strictly true
for the offset-hinge model. Referring to Fig. 3.19, the hub ﬂap moment can be written
as the sum of three components, i.e.,

The third component due to the lift on the ﬂap arm is O(e3) in the hover and will be
neglected. The result given by eqn 3.195 indicates that the hub moment will be out of
phase with blade ﬂapping to the extent that any ﬁrst harmonic aerodynamic load is out
of phase with ﬂap. Before examining this phase relationship in a little more detail, we
need to explain the inconsistency between Young’s result above in eqn 3.184 and the
correct expression given by eqn 3.195. To uncover the anomaly it is necessary to return
to the primitive expression for the hub ﬂap moment derived from bending theory (cf.

If an inﬁnite set of modes is included in the hub moment expression, then the ﬁrst two
terms in eqn 3.197 cancel, leaving each modal moment in phase with its corresponding
blade tip deﬂection. With only a ﬁnite number of modes included, this is no longer the
case (Bramwell, Ref. 3.34). In particular, if only the ﬁrst elastic mode is retained, then
the hub ﬂap moment has a residual

When the aerodynamic loading has the same shape as the ﬁrst mode, i.e.,
F(r, t) ∝mS1
(3.199)
then the ﬁrst term in eqn 3.198 vanishes and the hub moment expression reduces to that
given by Young (Ref. 3.33). These conditions will not, in general, be satisﬁed since,
even in hover, there are r2 terms in the aerodynamic loading. Substituting the mode
shape for the offset hinge, given by eqn 3.183, into eqn 3.198, leads to the correct
hub moment with the out-of-phase aerodynamic component as given by eqn 3.195.
Neglecting the effect of the in-plane loads, we see that the roll and pitch hub ﬂap
moments applied to the fuselage from a single blade in non-rotating coordinates, are
given by the transformation
Lh = −M(r) sin ψ
(3.200)
Mh = −M(r) cos ψ
(3.201)
Substituting for the aerodynamic loads in eqns 3.200 and 3.201 and expanding to give
the quasi-steady (zeroth harmonic) components, leads to the hover result

The inertial and aerodynamic components proportional to the offset e in the above are
clearly absent in the centre-spring model when the hub moment is always in phase
with the ﬂapping. The extent to which the additional terms are out of phase with the
ﬂapping can be estimated by examining the hub moment derivatives. By far the most
signiﬁcant variations with offset appear in the control coupling derivatives. Expressions

To compare numerical values for the roll control derivatives with various combinations
of offset and spring stiffness, it is assumed that the ﬂap frequency ratio λβ and the
blade Lock number remain constant throughout. These would normally be set using
the corresponding values for the ﬁrst elastic ﬂap mode frequency and the modal inertia
given by eqn 3.11. The values selected are otherwise arbitrary and uses of the offset-
spring model in the literature are not consistent in this regard. We chose to draw our
comparison for a moderately stiff rotor, with γ 2
β = 1.2 and Sβ = 0.2. Figure 3.20
shows a cross-plot of the ﬂap control derivatives for values of offset e extending out to

 
134

0.15. With e = 0, the ﬂap frequency ratio is augmented entirely with the centre spring;
at e = 0.15, the offset alone determines the augmented frequency ratio. The result
shows that the rotor ﬂapping changes in character as hinge offset is increased, with the
ﬂap/control phase angle decreasing from about 80◦for the centre-spring conﬁguration
to about 70◦with 15% offset. The corresponding roll and pitch hub moment derivatives
are illustrated in Fig. 3.21 for the same case. Figure 3.21 shows that over the range
of offset-hinge values considered, the primary control derivative increases by 50%
while the cross-coupling derivative increases by over 100%. The second curve in Fig.
3.21 shows the variation of the hub moment in phase with the ﬂapping. It can be seen
that more than 50% of the change in the primary roll moment derivative is due to the
aerodynamic moment from disc ﬂapping in the longitudinal direction. These moments

could not be developed from just the ﬁrst mode of an elastic blade and are a special
feature of large offset-hinge rotors.
The results indicate that there is no simple equivalence between the centre-spring
model and the offset-hinge model. Even with Young’s approximation, where the aero-
dynamic shear force at the hinge is neglected, the ﬂapping is ampliﬁed as shown above.
A degree of equivalence, at least for control moments, can be achieved by varying the
blade inertia as the offset hinge is increased, hence increasing the effective Lock num-
ber, but the relationship is not obvious. Even so, the noticeable decrease in control
phasing, coupled with the out-of-phase moments, gives rise to a dynamic behaviour
which is not representative of the ﬁrst elastic ﬂap mode. On the other hand, the appeal
of the centre-spring model is its simplicity, coupled with the preservation of the correct
phasing between control and ﬂapping and between ﬂapping and hub moment. The ma-
jor weakness of the centre-spring model is the crude approximation to the blade shape
and corresponding tip deﬂection and velocity, aspects where the offset-hinge model is
more representative.
The selection of parameters for the centre-spring model is relatively straightfor-
ward. In the case of hingeless or bearingless rotors, the spring strength and blade inertia
are chosen to match the ﬁrst elastic mode frequency ratio and modal inertia respec-
tively. For articulated rotors, the spring strength is again selected to give the correct ﬂap
frequency ratio, but now the inertia is changed to match the rotor blade Lock number
about the real offset ﬂap hinge.
It needs to be remembered that the rigid blade models discussed above are only
approximations to the motion of an elastic blade and speciﬁcally to the ﬁrst cantilever
ﬂap mode. In reality, the blade responds by deforming in all of its modes, although
the contribution of higher bending modes to the quasi-steady hub moments is usually
assumed to be small enough to be neglected. As part of a study of hingeless rotors,
Shupe (Refs 3.36 and 3.37) examined the effects of the second ﬂap bending mode on
ﬂight dynamics. Because this mode often has a frequency close to three-per-rev, it can
have a signiﬁcant forced response, even at one-per-rev, and Shupe has argued that the
inclusion of this effect is important at high speed. This brings us to the domain of
aeroelasticity and we defer further discussion until Section 3.4, where we shall explore
higher ﬁdelity modelling issues in more detail.
Rotor blades need to lag and twist in addition to ﬂap, and here we discuss brieﬂy
the potential contributions of these DoFs to helicopter ﬂight dynamics.
Rotor in-plane motion – lead–lag
Rigid or elastic lead–lag blade motion attenuates the in-plane forces on the rotor.
On articulated rotors, the rigid-blade lead–lag motion revolves about an offset hinge,
necessary to enable the applied torque to rotate the rotor. On hingeless rotors, lead–
lag takes the form of in-plane bending. Because the in-plane aerodynamic damping
forces are low, it is usual to ﬁnd mechanical dampers attached to the lead–lag hinge.
Additional mechanical in-plane damping is even found on some hingeless rotors. A
comprehensive discussion on the signiﬁcance of lead–lag on blade stability and loads
is provided by Johnson in Ref. 3.7. For most ﬂight mechanics analysis, the presence of
lead–lag motion contributes little to the overall response and stability of the helicopter.
There is one aspect that is relevant and needs to be referred to, however. To aid the
discussion, the coupled equations of ﬂap/lead–lag motion are required; for the present
purposes, we assume that the ﬂap and lag blade inertias are equal and describe the

 
136

ββ −2β ˙ζ = MF
(3.210)
ζ ′′ + Cζ ˙ζ + λ2
ζ ζ + 2β ˙β = ML
(3.211)
We assume that both the ﬂap (β) and lead–lag (ζ) motion can be approximated by the
centre-spring equivalent model as illustrated in Figs 3.6 and 3.22. The direct inertial
forces are balanced by restoring moments; in the case of the lag motion, the centrifugal
stiffening works only with an offset lag hinge (or centre-spring emulation of centrifugal
stiffness). If the lag hinge offset is eζ , then the frequency is given by
λ2
ζ = 3


eζ


(3.212)
The natural lag frequency λζ is typically about 0.25 for articulated rotors; hingeless
rotors can have subcritical (< , e.g., Lynx, Bo105) or supercritical (> , e.g., pro-
pellers) lag frequencies, but λζ should be far removed from  to reduce the amount
of in-plane lag response to excitation. The ﬂap and lag equations above have a similar
form. We have included a mechanical viscous lag damper Cζ for completeness. MF
and ML are the aerodynamic ﬂap and lag moments. Flap and lag motions are coupled,
dynamically through the Coriolis forces in eqns 3.210 and 3.211, and aerodynami-
cally from the variations in rotor blade lift and drag forces. The Coriolis effects are
caused by blade elements moving radially as the rotor ﬂaps and lags. Because of the
lower inherent damping in lag, the Coriolis moment tends to be more signiﬁcant in the
lag equation due to ﬂap motion. In addition, the lag aerodynamic moment ML will be
strongly inﬂuenced by in-plane lift forces caused by application of blade pitch and vari-
ations in induced inﬂow. The impact of these effects will be felt in the frequency range
associated with the coupled rotor/fuselage motions. In terms of MBCs, the regressing
and advancing lag modes will be located at ( −λζ ) and ( + λζ ) respectively. A
typical layout of the uncoupled ﬂap and lag modes is shown on the complex eigen-
value plane in Fig. 3.23. The ﬂap modes are well damped and located far into the
left plane. In contrast, the lag modes are often weakly damped, even with mechanical

dampers, and are more susceptible to being driven unstable. The most common form
of stability problem associated with the lag DoF is ground resonance, whereby the
coupled rotor/fuselage/undercarriage system develops a form of ‘ﬂutter’; the in-plane
rotation of the rotor centre of mass resonates with the fuselage/undercarriage system.
Another potential problem, seemingly less well understood, arises through the
coupling of rotor and fuselage motions in ﬂight. Several references examined this
topic in the early days of hingeless rotor development (Refs 3.38, 3.39), when the em-
phasis was on avoiding any hinges or bearings at the rotor hub to simplify the design
and maintenance procedures. Control of rotor in-plane motion and loads through feed-
back of roll motion to cyclic pitch was postulated. This design feature has never been
exploited, but the sensitivity of lag motion to attitude feedback control has emerged
as a major consideration in the design of autostabilization systems. The problem is
discussed in Ref. 3.6 and can be attributed to the combination of aerodynamic effects
due to cyclic pitch and the powerful Coriolis moment in eqn 3.211. Both the regressing
and advancing lag modes are at risk here. In Ref. 3.40, Curtiss discusses the physical
origin of the couplings and shows an example where the advancing lag mode actually
goes unstable at a relatively low value of gain in a roll rate to lateral cyclic feedback
control system (−0.2◦/◦/s). In contrast, the roll regressing mode can be driven unstable
at higher values of roll attitude feedback gain. The results of Ref. 3.40 and the later
Bo105 study by Tischler (Ref. 3.41) give clear messages to the designers of autostabi-
lizers and, particularly, high gain active control systems for helicopters. Designs will
need to be evaluated with models that include the lead–lag dynamics before implemen-
tation on an aircraft. However, the modelling requirements for speciﬁc applications are
likely to be considerably more complex than is implied by the simple analysis outlined
above. Pitch–ﬂap–lag couplings, nonlinear mechanical lag damping and pre-cone are
examples of features of relatively small importance in themselves, but which can have
a powerful effect on the form of the coupled rotor/fuselage modes.
Of course, one of the key driving mechanisms in the coupling process is the
development of in-plane aerodynamic loads caused by blade pitch; any additional

 
138
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling

dynamic blade twist and pitch effects will also contribute to the overall coupled motion,
but blade pitch effects have such a profound ﬁrst-order effect on ﬂapping itself that it
is in this context that they are now discussed.
Rotor blade pitch
In previous analysis in this chapter the blade pitch angle was assumed to be prescribed
at the pitch bearing in terms of the cyclic and collective applied through the swash
plate. Later, in Section 3.4, the effects of blade elastic torsion are referred to, but there
are aspects of rigid blade pitch motion that can be addressed prior to this. Consider a
centrally hinged blade with a torsional spring to simulate control system stiffness, Kθ,
as shown in Fig. 3.24. For simplicity, we assume coincident hinges and centre of mass
and elastic axis so that pitch–ﬂap coupling is absent. The equation of motion for rigid
blade pitch takes the form
θ′′ + λ2
θθ = Mp + ω2
θθi
(3.213)
where the pitch natural frequency is given by
λ2
θ = 1 + ω2
θ
(3.214)
where MP is the normalized applied moment and θi is the applied blade pitch. The
natural frequency for free pitch motion (i.e., with zero control system stiffness) is one-
per-rev; on account of the so-called propeller moment contribution to the restoring
moment. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 3.25 where mass elements along the chord line
experience in-plane inertial moments due to small components of the large centrifugal
force ﬁeld. For rigid control systems, θ = θi. The control system stiffness is usually
relatively high, giving values of ωθ between 2 and 6 . In this range we usually ﬁnd
the ﬁrst elastic torsion mode frequency, the response of which can dominate that of

139
the rigid blade component. A similar form to eqn 3.213 will apply to the ﬁrst elastic
mode, which will have a nearly linear variation along the blade radius. This aspect will
be considered later in Section 3.4, but there are two aspects that are relevant to both
rigid and elastic blade torsion which will be addressed here.
First, we consider the gyroscopic contribution to the applied moment MP. Just
as we found with ﬂap motion earlier in this chapter, as the rotor shaft rotates under the
action of pitch and roll moments, so the rotor blade will experience nose-up gyroscopic
pitching moments of magnitude given by the expression
MP(gyro) = −2(p sin ψ + q cos ψ)
(3.215)
The induced cyclic pitch response can then be written as
δθ1s =
−2p
λ2
θ −1
,
δθ1c =
−2q
λ2
θ −1
(3.216)
where p and q are the helicopter roll and pitch rates, with the bar signifying normal-
ization by . For low blade torsional or swash plate stiffness, the magnitude of the
gyroscopic pitch effects can therefore be signiﬁcant. More than a degree of induced
cyclic can occur with a soft torsional rotor rolling rapidly (Ref. 3.42).
The second aspect concerns the location of the pitch bearing relative to the ﬂap
and lag hinges. If the pitch application takes place outboard of the ﬂap and lag hinges,
then there is no kinematic coupling from pitch into the other rotor DoFs. However, with
an inboard pitch bearing, the application of pitch causes in-plane motion with a ﬂapped
blade and out-of-plane motion for a lagged blade. The additional motion also results
in an increased effective pitch inertia and hence reduced torsional frequency. These
effects are most signiﬁcant with hingeless rotors that have large effective hinge offsets.
On the Lynx, the sequence of rotations is essentially ﬂap/lag followed by pitch, while
the reverse is the case for the Bo105 helicopter (Figs 3.26(a) and (b)). The arrangement
of the ﬂap and lag real or virtual hinges is also important for coupling of these motions
into pitch. Reference 3.7 describes the various structural mechanisms that contribute
to these couplings, noting that the case of matched ﬂap and lag stiffness close to the
blade root minimizes the induced torsional moments (e.g., Westland Lynx).
As already noted, any discussion of blade torsion would be deﬁcient without con-
sideration of blade elastic effects and we shall return to these brieﬂy later. However, the
number of parameters governing the dynamics is large and includes the location of the
elastic axis relative to the mass axis and aerodynamic centre, the stiffness distribution
and any pre-cone and twist. Introducing this degree of complexity into the structural
dynamics also calls for a consistent approach to the blade section aerodynamics, in-
cluding chordwise pitching moments and unsteady aerodynamics. These are all topics
for further discussion in Section 3.4.
Before we proceed with detailing the modelling of the other rotorcraft compo-
nents, there is one ﬁnal rotor-related aerodynamic effect to be considered – ground
effect.
Ground effect on inﬂow and induced power
Operating helicopters close to the ground introduces a range of special characteristics in
the ﬂight dynamic behaviour. The most signiﬁcant is the effect on the induced velocity

Fig. 3.27 Ground effect on a helicopter in hovering ﬂight
at the rotor and hence the rotor thrust and power required. A succinct analysis of the
principal effects from momentum considerations was reported in Ref. 3.43, where, in
addition, comparison with test data provided useful validation for a relatively simple
theory. Close to the ground, the rotor downwash ﬁeld is strongly inﬂuenced by the
surface as shown in Fig. 3.27. In Ref. 3.43, Cheeseman and Bennett modelled the
ground plane inﬂuence with a rotor of equal and opposite strength, in momentum terms,
at an equidistance below the ground (Fig. 3.27). This mirror image was achieved with a
simple ﬂuid source that, according to potential ﬂow theory, served to reduce the inﬂow
vi at the rotor disc in hover by an amount given by
δvi = Advi
16πz2g
(3.217)
where zg is the distance of the ground below the rotor disc and Ad is the rotor disc area.
The rotor thrust, at constant power, can be written as the ratio of the induced velocity
out-of-ground effect (oge) to the induced velocity in-ground effect (ige). Reference
3.43 goes on to derive an approximation for the equivalent thrust change in forward
ﬂight with velocity V, the approximation reducing to the correct expression in hover,
given by eqn 3.218.

Figure 3.28 illustrates the variation in normalized thrust as a function of rotor height
above ground and forward velocity. Ground effect is most signiﬁcant in hover, and,
below heights of the order of a rotor radius, thrust increments of between 5 and 15%
are predicted. In forward ﬂight, ground effect becomes insigniﬁcant above normalized

speeds of 2. Simple momentum considerations are unable to predict any inﬂuence of
blade loading on ground effect. By combining momentum theory with blade element
theory, it can be shown that (Ref. 3.43) increasing blade loading typically reduces
ground effect such that a 10% increase in blade loading reduces the ige thrust increment
by about 10%. Another interesting result from these predictions is that the increase
in power required as a helicopter transitions oge is greater than the decrease in power
due to the reduction in induced velocity. Figure 3.29, from Ref. 3.43, illustrates the
point, showing the variation in power required as a function of forward speed, and
reﬂects practical observations that a power increase is required as a helicopter ﬂies off
the ground cushion (Ref. 3.44). Further discussion of ground effect, particularly the
effects on non-uniform inﬂow and hub moments, can be found in Ref. 3.45.
3.2.2
The tail rotor
The tail rotor operates in a complex ﬂowﬁeld, particularly in low-speed ﬂight, inground
effect, sideways ﬂight and in the transition to forward ﬂight. The wake of the main
rotor, together with the disturbed air shed from the main rotor hub, rear fuselage
and vertical stabilizer, interacts with the tail rotor to create a strongly non-uniform
ﬂowﬁeld that can dominate the tail rotor loading and control requirements. The basic

 
Building a Simulation Model
143
Fig. 3.30 Sketch of tail rotor subsystem
equations for tail rotor forces and moments are similar to those for the main rotor,
but a high-ﬁdelity tail rotor model will require a sophisticated formulation for the
normal and in-plane components of local induced inﬂow. Initially, we shall ignore
the non-uniform effects described above and derive the tail rotor forces and moments
from simple considerations. The interactional effects will be discussed in more detail in
Section 3.4.2. The relatively small thrust developed by the tail rotor, compared with the
main rotor (between 500 and 1000 lb (2220 and 4440 N) for a Lynx-class helicopter),
means that the X and Z components of force are also relatively small and, as a ﬁrst
approximation, we shall ignore these.
Referring to the tail rotor subsystem in Fig. 3.30, we note that the tail rotor

0T and θ∗
1sT are the effective tail rotor collective and cyclic pitch respectively.
Tail rotors are usually designed with a built-in coupling between ﬂap and pitch, the δ3
angle, deﬁned by the parameter k3 = tan δ3, hence producing additional pitch inputs
when the rotor disc cones and tilts (in MBC parlance). This coupling is designed to
reduce transient ﬂapping angles and blade stresses. However, it also results in reduced
control sensitivity; the relationship can be written in the form
θ∗
0T = θ0T + k3β0T
θ∗
1sT = θ1sT + k3β1sT
(3.223)
where θ0T and θ1sT are the control-system- and pilot-applied control inputs; the cyclic
inputs are usually zero as tail rotors are not normally ﬁtted with a tilting swash plate.
Note that the cyclic change is applied at the same azimuth as the ﬂapping, rather
than with the 90◦phase shift as with swash-plate-applied cyclic on the main rotor; the
δ3-applied cyclic is therefore fairly ineffective at reducing disc tilt and is actually likely
to give rise to more ﬁrst harmonic cyclic ﬂapping than would otherwise occur. Again,
using the main rotor derivations, particularly the coning relationship in eqn 3.64, we
note that the effective collective pitch may be written as

pitch reductions occur.

The above expressions undoubtedly reﬂect a crude approximation to the complex
aerodynamic environment in which the tail rotor normally operates, both in low- and
high-speed ﬂight. We revisit the complexities of interactional aerodynamics brieﬂy in
Section 3.4.2.
3.2.3
Fuselage and empennage
The fuselage aerodynamic forces and moments
The ﬂow around the fuselage and empennage is characterized by strong nonlinear-
ities and distorted by the inﬂuence of the main rotor wake. The associated forces
and moments due to the surface pressures and skin friction are therefore complex
functions of ﬂight speed and direction. While computer modelling of the integrated
ﬂowﬁeld is no longer an impossible task, most of the ﬂight mechanics modelling
to date has been based on empirical ﬁtting of wind tunnel test data, gathered at a
limited range of dynamic pressure and fuselage angles of incidence, at model (Ref.
3.47) or full scale (Ref. 3.48). Assuming ‘similar’ ﬂuid dynamics at the test and
full-scale ﬂight conditions, we note that the forces at a general ﬂight speed, or dy-
namic pressure, can be estimated from the data at the measured conditions through the
relationship

of the published test data have been measured on isolated fuselage shapes, although
the ﬁndings of Ref. 3.47 have shed light on the principal effects of rotor wake/fuselage
interaction and the approximate formulation outlined below is based on this
work.
The three most signiﬁcant components in forward ﬂight are the fuselage drag,
which dominates the power requirement at high speed, and the pitching and yawing
moment changes with incidence and sideslip respectively. The fuselage rolling mo-
ment is usually small except for conﬁgurations with deep hulls where the fuselage
aerodynamic centre can be signiﬁcantly below the aircraft centre of gravity. At lower
speeds, the fuselage aerodynamic loads are correspondingly smaller, although signif-
icant effects will be the sideforce in sideways ﬂight and the vertical load and yawing
moment due to the main rotor wake. The fuselage moments are generally destabilizing,
resulting from the greater planform and side area ahead of the aircraft centre of gravity.
These two points will not, in general, be coincident. In addition, wind tunnel test data
are relative to a third point, generally referred to as the ‘fuselage aerodynamic refer-
ence point’, to be distinguished from our ‘fuselage reference point’ below the main
rotor hub on the aircraft x-axis. Fuselage aerodynamic data measured in a wind tunnel
are usually presented in wind tunnel axes as lift, drag, sideforce and corresponding
moments about the tunnel-ﬁxed reference system. We assume that the transformation
from wind tunnel to fuselage axes has been applied so that we work with forces in
the moving fuselage axes system. The effect of rotor downwash can be approximately
taken into account by assuming the fuselage is immersed in the uniform component,
through the assumption of superposition; hence, the fuselage incidence and velocity

where Sp and Ss are the plan and side areas of the helicopter fuselage, respectively. Typ-
ically, the force and moment coefﬁcients will be derived from table look-up functions
of incidence and sideslip. Piecewise linear variations illustrating the main character-
istics over the incidence and sideslip range, −180◦to +180◦, are shown in Fig. 3.31.
The yaw moment is sometimes deﬁned as two functions corresponding to forward and
rearward ﬂight, i.e.,
Cnf = Cnfa,
u > 0
Cnf = Cnfb,
u < 0
(3.251)
The fuselage X force has a minimum value at small angles of incidence, and is prac-
tically zero in vertical ﬂight (α = 90◦). The pitching moment increases linearly with
incidence up to some moderate value when ﬂow separation at the leeward fuselage
hull causes a loss in circulatory lift and moment and a corresponding loading reversal.
The Y and Z forces have similar shapes, rising to maximum values at 90◦of incidence

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 3.31 Typical variation of fuselage aerodynamic force coefﬁcients with incidence angles
and sideslip respectively. The breakpoints shown in Fig. 3.31 are very much dependent
on the particular fuselage conﬁguration. To account for local, more strongly nonlinear
effects, smaller incidence and sideslip intervals would certainly be required. Numeri-
cal values for Lynx, Bo105 and Puma fuselage aerodynamic coefﬁcients are given in
Appendix 4B. Here the data are taken from wind tunnel tests conducted so that X, Z
and M varied only with angle of incidence and Y and N varied only with angle of
sideslip. Using these data in conjuction with the equations 3.241–3.250, one should be
careful to acknowledge the absence of the cross effects, e.g., the variation of X force
with sideslip. The simplest expedient is to delete the v2 term in the expression for Vf ,
eqns 3.241 and 3.242. A more general approach could be to assume a simple cos β
shape so that the X force becomes zero at β = 90◦.
The above discussion has been restricted to essentially steady effects whereas, in
practice, the relatively bulbous shapes of typical helicopter fuselages, with irregular
contours (e.g., engine and rotor shaft cowlings), give rise to important unsteady sepa-
ration effects that are difﬁcult to simulate accurately at model scale; unsteady effects
in manoeuvring ﬂight are also difﬁcult to account for. The problem is exacerbated
by the immersion in the rotor downwash at low speed. Sophisticated wind-tunnel and
computer modelling techniques are available nowadays but are often very expensive,
and conﬁdence in such techniques is still reduced by lack of full-scale validation data.

The empennage aerodynamic forces and moments
The horizontal tailplane and vertical ﬁn, together forming the empennage of a heli-
copter,performtwoprincipalfunctions.Insteadyforwardﬂight,thehorizontaltailplane
generates a trim load that reduces the main rotor fore–aft ﬂapping; similarly, the verti-
cal ﬁn generates a sideforce and yawing moment serving to reduce the tail rotor thrust
requirement. In manoeuvres, the tail surfaces provide pitch and yaw damping and stiff-
ness and enhance the pitch and directional stability. As with the fuselage, the force and
moments can be expressed in terms of coefﬁcients that are functions of incidence and
sideslip angles. Referring to the physical layout in Fig. 3.32, we note that the principal
components are the tailplane normal force, denoted Ztp, and given by

where

The parameter kλtp deﬁnes the ampliﬁcation of the main rotor wake uniform velocity
from the rotor disc to the tail. The tailplane incidence setting is denoted by αtp0. The
main rotor wake will impinge on the horizontal tail surface only when the wake angle
falls between χ1 and χ2, given by (see Fig. 3.33)

In Ref. 3.49, Loftin gives wind tunnel measurements for a NACA 0012 aerofoil
section for the complete range of incidence, −180◦< α < 180◦. From these data, an
approximation to the normal force coefﬁcient can be derived in the form
--Cztp

(3.261)
--Cztp

Cztp(αtp) = −Cztpl

(3.262)
where a0tp is, effectively, the slope of the tailplane lift coefﬁcient curve for small angles
of incidence. The value of this parameter is assumed to be a mean value for the whole
surface. Typically, helicopter tailplanes are fairly low aspect ratio surfaces, sometimes
having endplates to increase the effective angle of attack. Values of a0tp between 3.5

and 4.5 are typical. The constant limit value Cztpl is approximately 2 for the NACA
0012 aerofoil, corresponding to the drag coefﬁcient in two-dimensional vertical ﬂow.
The above formulation, leading to constant rotor downwash over the tailplane,
can be improved in two relatively simple respects. First, the spanwise variation of
downwash at the tail can be derived from the lateral distribution of downwash from
the main rotor, λ1s. Second, the downwash at time t at the tail can be estimated from
the loading conditions at time t −δt on the main rotor, where δt is the time taken for
the ﬂow to reach the tail. This effect manifests itself in an acceleration derivative, or
force and moment due to rate of change of incidence, and is discussed in more detail
in Chapter 4. The lateral variation in downwash over the horizontal tail generates a roll
moment and can also lead to a strong variation of pitching moment with sideslip, as
discussed by Cooper (Ref. 3.50) and Curtiss and McKillip (Ref. 3.51).
The local angle of sideslip and velocity (in x–y plane) at the vertical ﬁn may be
written in the form

The loading on the vertical surface can be derived in much the same way as the tailplane,
either as a simple analytic function or via a table look-up. One additional complexity,
characteristic of helicopter ﬁns, is that they are sometimes quite thick aerofoil sections,
carrying within them the tail rotor torque tube. The lift generated at small values of
incidence on aerofoils with thickness ratios greater than about 20% can be negated by
the lower surface suction near the trailing edge, as discussed by Hoerner and Borst
(Ref. 3.52). Figure 3.34, approximated from wind tunnel measurements on the SA 330
Puma (Ref. 3.53), shows how the ﬁn sideforce varies with sideslip angle; over the ﬁrst
5◦of incidence, no lift (sideforce) is produced. This effect partly explains the loss of
directional stability and attendant weak Dutch roll damping on the Puma, an aspect
that will be the subject of further discussion in Chapters 4 and 5.
The forces generated by the empennage at small values of incidence and sideslip
can be represented either by look-up tables or by high-order polynomials, e.g., the Puma

ﬁn sideforce requires at least a ﬁfth-order function to match the strongly nonlinear
feature illustrated in Fig. 3.34 (see the Appendix, Section 4B.1).
3.2.4
Powerplant and rotor governor
In this section we derive a simpliﬁed model for a helicopter’s rotorspeed and associated
engine and rotor governor dynamics based on the Helisim powerplant model (Ref.
3.4). The rotorspeed of a turbine-powered helicopter is normally automatically
governed to operate over a fairly narrow range with the steady-state relationship given
by the equation
Qe = −K3( −i)
(3.266)
where Qe is the turbine engine torque output at the rotor gearbox,  is the rotorspeed
and i is the so-called idling rotorspeed, corresponding to approximately zero engine
torque. Equation 3.266 is sometimes described as the droop law of the rotor, the droop
constant K3 indicating the reduction in steady-state rotorspeed between autorotation
and full power (e.g., in climb or high-speed ﬂight). The rotor control system enforces
this droop to prevent any ‘hunting’ that might be experienced should the control law
attempt to maintain constant rotorspeed. Rotorspeed control systems typically have
two components, one relating the change (or error) in rotorspeed with the fuel ﬂow,
ω f , to the engine, i.e., in transfer function form

−−→[Ge(s)] −→
ω f
(3.267)
the second relating the fuel input to the required engine torque output
ω f
−−→[He(s)] −→
Qe
(3.268)
The most simple representative form for the fuel control system transfer functions is
a ﬁrst-order lag
ω f (s)
(s)
= Ge(s) =
Ke1
1 + τe1s
(3.269)
where a bar above a quantity signiﬁes the Laplace transform.
The gain Ke1 can be selected to give a prescribed rotorspeed droop (e.g., between
5 and 10%) from ﬂight idle fuel ﬂow to maximum contingency fuel ﬂow; we write the
ratio of these two values in the form
ω fmax
ω fidle
≡ω fmi
(3.270)
The time constant τe1 will determine how quickly the fuel is pumped to the turbine
and, for a fast engine response, needs to be O(0.1 s).
The engine torque response to the fuel injection can be written as a lead–lag
element


(3.271)

Fig. 3.35 Variation of engine time constants with torque
The gain Ke2 can be set to give, say, 100% Qe at some value of fuel ﬂow ω f (e.g., 75%
ωfmax), thus allowing a margin for maximum contingency torque. In the engine model
used in Ref 3.4, the time constants in this dynamic element are a function of engine
torque. Figure 3.35 illustrates the piecewise relationship showing tighter control at the
engine power limit. Linear approximations for the lag and lead constants can be written
in the form
τe2 = τe2(Qe) ≈τ20 + τ21 Qe
τe3 = τe3(Qe) ≈τ30 + τ31 Qe

This second-order, nonlinear differential equation is activated by a change in rotor
speed and acceleration. These changes initially come through the dynamics of the
rotor/transmission system, assumed here to be represented by a simple equation relating
the rotor acceleration (relative to the fuselage, ˙ −˙r) to the applied torque, i.e., the
difference between the applied engine torque and the combination of main rotor Q R
and tail rotor torque QT , referred to the main rotor through the gearing gT , i.e.,
˙ = ˙r + 1

3.2.5
Flight control system
The ﬂight control system model includes the pilot’s controls, mechanical linkages,
actuation system and control rods; it also includes any augmentation through feedback
control and hence will, in general, encompass the sensors, computing element and any
additional actuation in parallel and/or in series with those driven by the mechanical
inputs from the pilot. This description corresponds to the classical layout found in most
contemporary helicopters. Discussion on the modelling requirements for full authority,
digital, active control systems are not covered in this book. We refer to Fig. 3.36 as we
develop the model of the ﬂight control system, from the rotors through to the cockpit
controls – the cyclic, collective and pedals. In the following analysis, the cockpit
controls are represented by the variable η, with appropriate subscripts; in all cases,
0 ≤η ≤1
(3.278)
with the positive sense deﬁned by a positive increase in the corresponding rotor blade
angle (see Fig. 3.36). The automatic ﬂight control system (AFCS) is usually made up
of stability and control augmentation system (SCAS) functions, applied through series
actuators, and autopilot functions applied through parallel actuators. In this section
we consider only the modelling of the SCAS.
Pitch and roll control
The swash plate concept was introduced in Chapter 2 (Fig. 2.5) as one of the key
innovations in helicopter development, allowing one-per-rev variations in rotor blade
pitch to be input in a quasi-steady manner from the actuators. The approximately 90◦
phase shift between cyclic pitch and the cyclic ﬂapping response comes as a result
of forcing the rotor with lift changes at resonance. In practice, cyclic pitch can be
applied through a variety of mechanisms; the conventional swash plate is by far the
most common, but Kaman helicopters incorporate aerodynamic surfaces in the form
of trailing edge ﬂaps and cyclic control in the Westland Lynx is effected through the
so-called ‘dangleberry’, with the blade control rods running inside the rotor shaft.
Whatever the physical mechanism, cyclic pitch requires very little energy to apply
at one-per-rev, and, for our purposes, a generalized swash plate is considered, with a
minimum of three actuators to provide the capability of tilting the swash plate at an
arbitrary angle relative to the rotor shaft.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Progressing downwards along the control rods (assumed rigid) from the blades,
and through the rotating swash plate, we come to the so-called mixing unit. This com-
bines the actuation outputs from the two cyclic controls with a phase angle. For articu-
lated and hingeless rotor conﬁgurations, even in the hover, the phase lag between cyclic
pitch and ﬂap is less than 90◦and, to achieve a pure pitch or roll control, the pilot needs
to apply a coupled input. As the forward speed increases, the response coupling changes
due to the increased aerodynamic damping effects. A single mixing is usually selected
as a compromise between these different conditions and can be written in the form

(3.279)
where ψf is the mixing angle, usually between 8◦and 12◦, and a prime simply denotes
the cyclic angle before mixing.
The next stage in the reverse sequence is the actuation itself. Most modern
helicopters incorporate powered ﬂying controls through hydraulic actuation. The
actuation system is quite a complicated mechanism with its own feedback control
designed to ensure that the response and stability to control inputs has good perfor-
mance and stability characteristics. The actuation system has inherent nonlinearities
at both small and large amplitudes, including rate limiting when the pilot demands
more than the hydraulic system can supply. Typical rate limits are of the order 100%
of full actuator range per second. Helicopters ﬁtted with an AFCS usually incorporate
a limited authority series actuation system driven by the voltage outputs of the SCAS
element. As shown in Fig. 3.36, these augmentation inputs to the actuators are limited
to amplitudes of the order ±10% of the full actuator throw. For our purposes we
assume that each actuation element can be represented by a ﬁrst-order lag, although
it has to be recognized that this is a crude approximation to the complex behaviour of
a complcated servo-elastic system; hence, we write the cyclic actuator outputs as the
sum of pilot (subscript p) and AFCS (subscript a) inputs in the transfer function form

The time constants τc1 and τc2 are typically between 25 and 100 ms, giving actuation
bandwidths between 40 and 10 rad/s. For systems operating at the lower end of this
bandwidth range, we can expect the actuation to inhibit rapid control action by the pilot.
The mechanical control runs connect the actuators to the pilot’s cyclic stick
through a series of levers and pulleys. At the stick itself, an artiﬁcial feel system
is usually incorporated to provide the pilot with stick centring tactile cues. A simple
spring with a breakout force is the most common form of feel system found in heli-
copters, with a constant spring gradient, independent of ﬂight condition or manoeuvre
state. If we neglect the dynamics of these elements, then the relationship for roll and
pitch cyclic can be written in the simple algebraic form as

where the g coefﬁcients are the gains and offsets, and η1c and η1s are the pilot’s cyclic
stickinputs.Includedintheaboveequationsaresimpleinterlinksbetweenthecollective
and cyclic, so that a collective input from the pilot also drives the cyclic control runs.
In this way, collective to roll and pitch couplings can be minimized. The coefﬁcients
in eqns 3.282–3.283 can conveniently be expressed in terms of four parameters:
θ1s0 – the pitch at zero cyclic stick and zero collective lever
θ1s1 – the pitch at maximum cyclic stick and zero collective lever
θ1s2 – he pitch at zero cyclic stick and maximum collective lever
θ1s3 – the pitch at maximum cyclic stick and maximum collective lever
The coefﬁcients can therefore be written as
g1s0 = θ1s0
g1s1 = θ1s1 −θ1s0

This analysis assumes a linear relationship between control movement and actuator
input. In practice, the mechanical system will exhibit some nonlinearities particularly
at the extremities of control throw due to the geometry of the linkage, and look-up
tables will be a more appropriate representation. For example, Fig. 3.37 illustrates the
cyclic/collective interlink functionality for the Lynx helicopter (Ref. 3.54).
With regard to the autostabilizer inputs, these will, in general, be complex func-
tions of sensor and control inputs with various ﬁlters arranged to stabilize the feedback

dynamics and protect against sensor noise. For the present purposes we shall assume
that the autostabilizer adds feedback control signals proportional to attitude and an-
gular rate, together with a feedforward signal proportional to the pilot’s control input,
referred to some adjustable datum (Fig. 3.36). This allows the zero or mid-range of the
autostabilizer to be reset by the pilot during ﬂight. This would be necessary, for exam-
ple, if the attitude gains were high enough to cause saturation as the speed increases
from hover to high speed. Other systems automatically disengage the attitude stabiliza-
tion when the pilot moves his control, thus obviating the need for a pilot-adjustable zero
(e.g., Puma). The simple proportional autostabilizer can be described by the equations

(3.286)
In Chapter 4, we shall demonstrate how rate stabilization alone is typically inadequate
for stabilizing a helicopter’s unstable pitch motion. However, with a combination of
fairly modest values of rate and attitude gains, k (O(0.1)), a helicopter can be stabilized
throughout its OFE, and a pilot can ﬂy ‘hands off’ or at least with some divided
attention, hence allowing certiﬁcation in IFR conditions. However, a low-authority
AFCS will quickly saturate in aggressive manoeuvres, or during ﬂight in moderate to
severe turbulence, and can be regarded only as an aid to steady ﬂight.
Yaw control
In a similar way, the pilot and autostabilizer commands are input to the yaw actuator
servo in the simpliﬁed ﬁrst-order transfer function form
θ0T =
θ0Tp + θ0Ta
1 + τc3s
(3.287)
The gearing between the actuator input and the yaw control run variable, ηcT , can be
written as
θ0Tp = gT0 + gT1ηcT
(3.288)
where the control run is generally proportional to both pedal, ηp, and collective lever,
ηc, inputs, in the form
ηcT = gcT0(1 −ηp) +

(3.289)
In eqn 3.289, the collective lever accounts for the normal mechanical interlink between
collective and yaw to reduce yaw excursions following power inputs. Equation 3.289
is a linear approximation to a relationship that can become strongly nonlinear at the
extremes of the control range, when the interlink geometry reduces the sensitivity.
Figure 3.38 illustrates the nonlinear variation for the Lynx helicopter (Ref. 3.54).
Heave control
Finally, the main rotor collective pitch output from the main rotor servos, achieved
through raising and lowering the swash plate, can be written in terms of the mechanical

and electrical inputs from the pilot and autostabilizer respectively, namely

(3.290)
The gearing with the collective lever is written as
θ0p = gc0 + gc1ηc
(3.291)
For most modern helicopters, there is no autostabilizer component in the collective
channel, but for completeness we include here a simple model of the so-called collective
acceleration control (Ref. 3.55) found in the Lynx. An error signal proportional to the
normal acceleration is fed back to the collective, i.e.,
θ0a = kgaz
(3.292)
For the Lynx, this system was implemented to provide dissimilar redundancy in the
SCAS. At high speeds, the collective is a very effective pitch control on hingeless rotor
helicopters, and this additional loop supplements the cyclic stabilization of aircraft
pitch attitude and rate.

Integrated Equations of Motion of the Helicopter
In the preceding sections the equations for the individual helicopter subsystems have
been derived. A working simulation model requires the integration of the subsystems in
sequential or concurrent form, depending on the processing architecture. Figure 3.39
illustrates a typical arrangement showing how the component forces and moments
depend on the aircraft motion, controls and atmospheric disturbances. The general

where the state vector x has components from the fuselage x f , rotors xr, en-

SCAS inputs apart, the control vector is made up of main and tail rotor cockpit
controls,
u = (η0, η1s, η1c, η0T )
(3.299)
Written in the explicit form of eqn 3.293, the helicopter dynamic system is described as
instantaneous and non-stationary. The instantaneous property of the system refers to the
fact that there are no hysteretic or more general hereditary effects in the formulation
as derived in this chapter. In practice, of course, the rotor wake can contain strong
hereditary effects, resulting in loads on the various components that are functions of
past motion. These effects are usually ignored in Level 1 model formulations, but
we shall return to this discussion later in Section 3.4. The non-stationary dynamic
property refers to the condition that the solution depends on the instant at which the
motion is intitiated through the explicit dependence on time t. One effect, included in
this category, would be the dependence on the variation of the atmospheric velocities–
wind gusts and turbulence. Another arises from the appearance of aerodynamic terms
in eqn 3.293 which vary with rotor azimuth.
The solution of eqn 3.293 depends upon the initial conditions – usually the heli-
copter trim state – and the time histories of controls and atmospheric disturbances. The
trim conditions can be calculated by setting the rates of change of the state vector to zero
and solving the resultant algebraic equations. However, with only four controls, only
four of the ﬂight states can be deﬁned; the values of the remaining 17 variables from
eqn 3.293 are typically computed numerically. Generally, the trim states are unique,
i.e., for a given set of control positions there is only one steady-state solution of the
equations of motion.
The conventional method of solving for the time variations of the simulation
equations is through forward numerical integration. At each time step, the forces and
moments on the various components are computed and consolidated to produce the
total force and moment at the aircraft centre of mass (see Fig. 3.39). The simplest
integration scheme will then derive the motion of the aircraft at the end of the next time
step by assuming some particular form for the accelerations. Some integration methods
smooth the response over several time steps, while others step backwards and forwards
through the equations to achieve the smoothest response. These various elaborations are

required to ensure efﬁcient convergence and sufﬁcient accuracy and will be required
when particular dynamic properties are present in the system (Ref. 3.56). In recent
years, the use of inverse simulation has been gaining favour, particularly for model
validation research and for comparing different aircraft ﬂying the same manoeuvre.
With inverse simulation, instead of the control positions being prescribed as functions
of time, some subset of the aircraft dynamic response is deﬁned and the controls
required to ﬂy the manoeuvre computed. The whole area of trim and response will be
discussed in more detail in Chapters 4 and 5, along with the third ‘problem’ of ﬂight
dynamics – stability. In these chapters, the analysis will largely be conﬁned to what
we have described as Level 1 modelling, as set down in detail in Chapter 3. However,
we have made the point on several occasions that a higher level of modelling ﬁdelity
is required for predicting ﬂight dynamics in some areas of the ﬂight envelope. Before
we proceed to discuss modelling applications, we need to review and discuss some of
the missing aeromechanics effects, beyond Level 1 modelling.
3.4
Beyond Level 1 Modelling
‘Theory is never complete, ﬁnal or exact. Like design and construction it is continu-
ally developing and adapting itself to circumstances’. We consider again Duncan’s
introductory words and reﬂect that the topic of this ﬁnal section in this model-building
chapter could well form the subject of a book in its own right. In fact, higher levels
of modelling are strictly outside the intended scope of the present book, but we shall
attempt to discuss brieﬂy some of the important factors and issues that need to be con-
sidered as the modelling domain expands to encompass ‘higher’ DoFs, nonlinearities
and unsteady effects. The motivation for improving a simulation model comes from a
requirement for greater accuracy or a wider range of application, or perhaps both. We
have already stated that the so-called Level 1 modelling of this chapter, augmented with
‘correction’ factors for particular types, should be quite adequate for deﬁning trends
and preliminary design work and should certainly be adequate for gaining a ﬁrst-order
understanding of helicopter ﬂight dynamics. In Chapters 4 and 5 comparison with
test data will conﬁrm this, but the features that make the Level 1 rotor modelling so
amenable to analysis – rigid blades, linear aerodynamics and trapezoidal wake struc-
ture – are also the source of its limitations. Figure 3.40, for example, taken from Ref.
3.57, compares the rotor incidence distribution for the Puma helicopter (viewed from
below) derived from ﬂight measurements of rotor blade leading edge pressure, with
the Level 1 Helisim prediction. The ﬂight condition is a straight and level trim at
100 knots. While there are similarities in the two contour plots, theory fails to capture
many of the details in the ﬂight measurements. The region of high incidence on the
retreating side is more extensive and further outboard in the ﬂight results, and there is a
clearly deﬁned ridge in the ﬂight measurement caused by the blade vortex interaction,
which is, of course, completely missed by Helisim. At this 100-knot trim condition,
Helisim may well predict the controls to trim reasonably accurately, simply because
the integrated forces and moments tend to smooth out the effects of the detailed dif-
ferences apparent in Fig. 3.40. However, there are a wide range of problems where the
details become signiﬁcant in the predictive capability of modelling. Examples include
the pitch-up effect of blade stall in ‘high g’ manoeuvres, the transient rotor torque ex-
cursions in rapid rolls, the effects of blade icing or battle damage on power and control

margins. If we consider the effects of the rotor wake on the tail rotor and empennage,
then the simple trapezoidal downwash model fails to predict important effects, for
example tail rotor control margins in quartering ﬂight or the strong couplings induced
by the wake effects on the rear fuselage and empennage, particularly in manoeuvres.
High-ﬁdelity simulation requires that these effects can be predicted, and to achieve this
we need to consider the modelling elements at Levels 2 and 3, as described in Table
3.1. The following qualitative discussions will draw heavily from the published works
of selected contributors to the ﬁeld of enhanced rotorcraft modelling. The author is
all too aware of the enormous amount of published work and achievements by a great
number of researchers in Europe and the United States in recent years, particularly to
rotor aeroelastic modelling, and a complete review is surely the topic for another text.
The aim here is to draw the readers’ attention to selected advances that lay emphasis
on physical understanding.
3.4.1
Rotor aerodynamics and dynamics
Rotor aerodynamics
The linear aerodynamic theory used in Level 1 rotor modelling is a crude approximation
to reality and, while quite effective at predicting trends and gross effects, has an air of
sterility when compared with the rich and varied content of the ﬂuid dynamics of the
real ﬂow through rotors. Compressibility, unsteadiness, three-dimensional and viscous
effects have captured the attention of several generations of helicopter engineers; they
are vital ingredients for rotor design, but the extent of the more ‘academic’ interest
in real aerodynamic effects is a measure of the scientiﬁc challenge intrinsic to rotor
modelling. It is convenient to frame the following discussion into two parts – the
prediction of the local rotor blade angle of incidence and the prediction of the local
rotor blade lift, drag and pitching moment. While the two problems are part of the
same feedback system, e.g., the incidence depends on the lift and the lift depends

 
164
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
on the incidence, separating the discussion provides the opportunity to distinguish
between some of the critical issues in both topics.
Modelling section lift, drag and pitching moment
The rotor blade section loading actions of interest are the lift, drag and pitching moment.
All three are important and all three can signal limiting effects in terms of blade ﬂap,
lag and torsion response. A common approximation to real ﬂow effects assumes two-
dimensional, quasi-steady variations with local incidence and Mach number uniquely
determining the blade loading. In Ref. 3.58, Prouty gives an account of empirical
ﬁndings based on analysis of a wide range of two-dimensional aerofoil test data.
Key parameters deﬁning the performance and behaviour of an aerofoil section are the
maximum achievable lift coefﬁcient CLmax and the drag divergence Mach number Md.
Both depend critically on the geometry of the aerofoil, as expected, and hence on the
type of rotor stall. Prouty identiﬁes three types of stall to which rotor blades are prone –
thin aerofoil, leading edge and trailing edge stall.
Prouty’s ﬁndings suggest that aerofoil sections with thickness-to-chord ratios
greater than about 8% will normally experience trailing edge stall and, at their best,
achieve values of CLmax up to about 1.6. For thinner aerofoils, leading edge stall
is more likely, with a CLmax that increases with thickness/chord up to about 1.8.
The general effects of trailing and leading edge stall on lift, drag and moment coef-
ﬁcients are sketched in Fig. 3.41, where these are shown as functions of incidence.
Fig. 3.41 Types of aerofoil stall: (a) trailing edge stall; (b) leading edge stall

 
Building a Simulation Model
165
Trailing edge stall is characterized by a gradual increase in the region of separated
ﬂow moving forward from the trailing edge. Leading edge stall is triggered by the
bursting of a laminar separation bubble over the nose of the aerofoil giving rise to
sharp changes in lift, drag and pitching moment. Generally, thin aerofoils are favoured
for their performance (high Md) at high Mach number on the advancing side of the
disc, and thicker aerofoils are favoured for their performance (high CLmax) at low
Mach number and high incidence on the retreating side. Most helicopter blades are
therefore designed as a compromise between these two conﬂicting requirements and
may experience both types of stall within the operating envelope. Reference 3.59 de-
scribes the evolution of the cambered aerofoil sections adopted for the Lynx helicopter,
showing a favourable all-round comparison with the thicker, symmetrical NACA 0012
section. The latter was typical of aerofoil sections used on helicopter rotors before the
1970s.
In blade element rotor simulation models, the lift, drag and pitching moment co-
efﬁcients are usually stored in table look-up form as nonlinear functions of incidence
and Mach number, with the data tables derived from either wind tunnel tests or the-
oretical predictions. In Ref. 3.6, Bramwell reports on the effects of swirl and other
three-dimensional, in-plane effects on section characteristics with signiﬁcant changes
in CLmax particularly at the higher Mach numbers. Also, in Ref. 3.60, Leishman draws
attention to the powerful effects of sweep angle on CLmax. Generally, however, for a
large extent of the rotor radius, the two-dimensional approximation is relatively ac-
curate. An exception is close to the tip, where three-dimensional effects due to the
interaction of the upper and lower surface ﬂows result in marked changes in the chord-
wise pressure distribution for a given incidence and Mach number. Accurate modelling
of the tip aerodynamics is still the subject of intense research and renewed impetus
with the advent of novel tip sections and planforms.
In forward ﬂight and manoeuvres, the section incidence and Mach number are
changing continuously and we need to consider the effects of aerodynamic unsteadiness
on the section characteristics. In a series of papers (e.g., Refs 3.61 – 3.64) Beddoes and
Leishman have reported the development of an indicial theory for unsteady compress-
ible aerodynamics applicable to both attached and separated ﬂow, for the computation
of section lift, drag and pitching moment. In attached ﬂow, the shed wake in the vicin-
ity of the aerofoil induces a time-dependent circulatory force on the section, with a
transient growth corresponding to about ﬁve chord lengths. A non-circulatory lift also
develops (due to the airfoil virtual mass) and decays to zero in approximately the same
spatial scale. Both effects are approximated in the Beddoes model by combinations
of exponential functions (Ref. 3.63) responding to arbitrary motions of an aerofoil in
pitch and heave. To account for the response of the aerofoil to its passage through
the wake and individual vortices of other blades, the method also models the loading
actions due to arbitrary variations in the incidence of the airﬂow (Ref. 3.64). A special
feature of these developments has been the extension to the modelling of separated
ﬂow and the prediction of dynamic stall (see earlier paper by Johnson and Ham for
discussion of the physics of dynamic stall, Ref. 3.65). In unsteady motion, the passage
of shed vorticity over the aerofoil upper surface following leading edge stall gives rise
to a delay in both lift and moment ‘break’, resulting in an overshoot of lift to well
beyond the normal quasi-steady value of CLmax. Beddoes has encapsulated this effect
in a semi-empirical model, summarized in Fig. 3.42, taken from Ref. 3.62. To quote
from Ref. 3.62

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 3.42 Time delay model for dynamic stall (Ref. 3.62) (T.E., trailing edge; L.E., leading
edge; C.P., centre of pressure)
For each Mach number the angle of attack (α1) which delimits attached ﬂow is deter-
mined by the break in pitching moment and a further angle (α2) is used to represent
the condition where ﬂow separation and hence centre of pressure is stabilised. In
application, when the local value of angle of attack exceeds α1 the onset of separation
is assumed to be delayed for a ﬁnite period of time (τ1) during which the lift and
moment behave as appropriate for attached ﬂow. When this time delay is exceeded,
ﬂow separation is assumed to be initiated by the shedding of a vortex from the surface
of the aerofoil and after a period of time (τ2), during which the vortex traverses the
chord, it passes free of the surface. In this interval, lift is generated by the vortex and
the overall level maintained equivalent to that for fully attached ﬂow but the centre
of pressure moves aft as a function of both angle of attack and time. When the vortex
passes free of the surface, the lift decays rapidly to a value appropriate to fully sepa-
rated ﬂow assuming that the angle of attack is still sufﬁciently high. If and when the
angle of attack reduces below the value α1 re-attachment of the ﬂow is represented
by the attached ﬂow model, re-initialised to account for the current lift deﬁciency.
Beddoes goes on to suggest ways that the method can be extended to account for trail-
ing edge stall and also in compressible conditions, when stall is more often triggered by
shock wave–boundary layer interaction (Ref. 3.62). Unsteady aerodynamic effects are
essential ingredients to understanding many rotor characteristics at high speed and in
manoeuvres, and have found practical application in current-generation loads, vibration
and aeroelastic stability prediction models. The impact on ﬂight dynamics is less well

explored, but two important considerations provide evidence that for some problems,
unsteady aerodynamic effects may need to be simulated in real-time applications. First,
we consider the azimuthal extent of the development of unsteady lift and moment. The
linear potential theory discussed above predicts a time to reach steady-state lift follow-
ing a step change in incidence of about 5–10 chord lengths, equating to between 10◦
and 20◦azimuth. Even the lower frequency one-per-rev incidence changes associated
with cyclic pitch will lead to a not-insigniﬁcant phase lag, depending on the rotorspeed.
Phase lags as low as 5◦between control inputs and lift change can have a signiﬁcant
effect on pitch to roll cross-coupling. Second, modelling the trigger to blade stall cor-
rectly is important for simulating ﬂight in gross manoeuvres, when the azimuthal/radial
location of initial stall can determine the evolution of the separated ﬂow and hence the
effect on pitch and roll hub moments particularly. Dynamic, rather than quasi-steady
stall, is, of course, the norm in forward ﬂight and manoeuvring conditions.
With two-dimensional test data tables, three-dimensional and low-frequency un-
steady corrections and an empirical stall model, deriving the section forces and pitching
moment is a relatively straightforward computational task. A much more signiﬁcant
task is involved in estimating the local incidence.
Modelling local incidence
The local incidence at azimuth station ψ and radial station r can be expanded as a linear
combination of contributions from a number of sources, as indicated by eqn 3.300:
α(ψ,r; t) = αpitch + αtwist + αﬂap + αwh + αinﬂow
(3.300)
The component αpitch is the contribution from the physical pitch of the blade applied
through the swash plate and pitch control system. The αtwist component includes con-
tributions from both static and dynamic twist; the latter will be discussed below in the
Rotor dynamics subsection. The αﬂap component due to rigid blade motion has been
fully modelled within the Level 1 framework; again we shall return to the elastic ﬂap
contribution below. The αwh component corresponds to the inclination of incident ﬂow
at the hub. Within the body of this chapter, the modelling of αinﬂow has been limited to
momentum theory, which although very effective, is a gross simpliﬁcation of the real
helical vortex wake of a rotor. Downwash, in the form of vorticity, is shed from a rotor
blade in two ways, one associated with the shedding of a (spanwise) vortex wake due
to the time-varying lift on the blade, the other associated with the trailing vorticity due
to the spanwise variation in blade lift. We have already discussed the inﬂow component
associated with the near (shed) vortex wake due to unsteady motion; it was implicit in
the indicial theory of Beddoes and Leishman. Modelling the trailing vortex system and
its effect on the inﬂow at the rotor disc has been the subject of research since the early
days of rotor development. Bramwell (Ref. 3.6) presents a comprehensive review of
activities up to the early 1970s, when the emphasis was on what can be described as
‘prescribed’ wakes, i.e., the position of the vortex lines or sheets are prescribed in space
and the induced velocity at the disc derived using the Biot–Savart law. The strength of
the vorticity is a function of the lift when the vorticity was shed from the rotor, which
is itself a function of the inﬂow.
Solving the prescribed wake problem thus requires an iterative procedure. Free
wake analysis allows the wake vorticity to interact with itself and hence the posi-
tion of the wake becomes a third unknown in the problem; a free wake will tend to

 
168
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
roll-up with time and hence gives a more realistic picture of the ﬂowﬁeld downstream
of the rotor. Whether prescribed or free, vortex wakes are computationally intensive
to model and have not, to date, found application in ﬂight simulation. As distributed
ﬂowﬁeld singularities, they also represent only approximate solutions to the underlying
equations of ﬂuid dynamics. In recent years, comprehensive rotor analysis models are
beginning to adopt more extensive solutions to the three-dimensional ﬂowﬁeld, using
so-called computational ﬂuid dynamics techniques (Ref. 3.3). The complexity of such
tools and the potential of the achievable accuracy may be somewhat bewildering to the
ﬂight dynamicist, and a real need remains for simpler approximations that have more
tractable forms with the facility for deriving linearized perturbations for stability analy-
sis. Earlier, in Section 3.2.1, we referred to the recent development of wake models that
exhibit these features (Refs 3.28, 3.29), the so-called ﬁnite-state wake structures. Here,
the inﬂow at the rotor is modelled as a series of modal functions in space-time, each
satisfying the rotor boundary conditions and the underlying continuity and momentum
equations, through the relationship with the blade lift distribution. The theory results
in a series of ordinary differential equations for the coupled inﬂow/lift which can be
appended to the rotor dynamic model. Comparison with test results for rotor inﬂow in
trimmed ﬂight (Ref. 3.29) shows good agreement and encourage further development
and application with this class of rotor aerodynamic model.
Rotor dynamics
Several of the important components of local blade incidence stem from the motion
and shape of the blade relative to the hub. A characteristic of Level 1 (ﬂight dynamics)
modelling is the approximation of rigid blade motion for ﬂap, lag and torsion. We
have seen how the CSER can be used to represent the different types of ﬂap retention
system – teetering, articulated or bearingless. In MBC form, the dynamics of one-
per-rev disc tilting are apparently well represented. Since the hub moments of interest
are produced by the one-per-rev ﬂapping, this level of approximation would appear to
be adequate for problems in the frequency range of interest to the ﬂight dynamicist.
However, a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in the centre-spring approximation involves the
relationship between the disc tilt and the hub moment. We have suggested earlier that
the linear relationship is a powerful attribute of the centre-spring model; if we look
more closely at the potential effects of elastic blade motion, we see that what appears
to be a strength of the approximation in many cases is actually a weakness in others.
With the centre-spring model, it can easily be shown that the moment computed from
the disc tilt and the hub moment computed from the integrated aerodynamic loads are
always in balance, and hence always in phase. More generally, for both articulated
and hingeless rotor approximate models, this is not the case. Consider the blade ﬂap
moment (in rotating axes) at the hub, given by eqn 3.15, but expanded to show how
the time-dependent generalized (modal) coordinates can be written as a summation of
harmonics with coefﬁcients am and bm, as in eqn 3.301:

Lynx at 150 knots
Each mode will contribute to the rotating hub moment through the different harmonics,
but only the ﬁrst harmonic contribution to each will be transmitted through to result
in quasi-steady fuselage motions. The extent of the contribution of higher modes to
the hub moment depends entirely on the character of the aerodynamic forcing; the
stronger the radial nonlinearity in the one-per-rev aerodynamic forces, the greater
will be the excitation of the higher modes. Of course, the higher the frequency of
the mode, the more attentuated will be its one-per-rev tip response, but equally, the
hub moment for a given tip deﬂection will be greater for the higher modes. An il-
lustration of the potential magnitude of contributions to the hub moment from higher
elastic modes is provided by Fig. 3.43. The blade bending at azimuth stations 90◦
and 270◦are shown for the Lynx rotor in trim at 150 knots, derived from the DRA
aeroelastic rotor model. The rotor model used to compute the results shown includes
ﬁrst and second ﬂap modes, ﬁrst torsion and ﬁrst lead–lag. The shape of the blade
highlights the strong contribution from the second ﬂap mode in the trim condition,
with the ‘node’ (zero displacement) at about 50% radius. In fact, the hub moment,
deﬁned by the curvature of the blade at the hub, has an opposite sign to the tilt of the
disc. The total hub rolling moment (in fuselage axes), computed from either the modal
curvature or integrated aerodynamics, is about −1000 N m (to port), clearly in oppo-
sition to the disc tilt to starboard. For the case with only the fundamental ﬂap mode
retained, the hub moment derived from the ﬁrst mode curvature is about +2000 N m
(to starboard), while the aerodynamic moment integrates to about −600 N m (cf. Fig.
3.43). This result argues strongly for a harmony in the model between aerodynamic
and dynamic formulations, particularly for high-speed ﬂight (µ > 0.3) when nonlin-
ear aerodynamics and hence the effects of higher modes are likely to become more
pronounced.
Shupe, in Ref. 3.36, presents results on the effect of the second ﬂap mode over
a wide range of conditions, supporting the above conclusion that the inﬂuence of the
loading on the shape of the hingeless blade at high speed is signiﬁcant, and higher

 
170

order modes need to be included in simulation modelling for ﬂight dynamics. Shupe
also noted the powerful effects of blade twist on the distribution of out-of-plane bend-
ing between the ﬁrst and second ﬂap modes; twist tends to pull the blade loading
inboard, hence leading to a radial aerodynamic distribution with a shape more like
the second ﬂap mode. A subtle effect that should be noted here is that the response
of the second ﬂap mode to one-per-rev aerodynamic loads will not feature the 90◦
phase shift associated with the ﬁrst ﬂap mode. The natural frequency of mode ‘ﬂap
2’ is an order of magnitude higher than that for mode ‘ﬂap 1’ and the phase lag
at one-per-rev will be very small. Hence, lateral cyclic (θ1c) will lead primarily to
longitudinal disc tilt (β1c) in mode ‘ﬂap 2’, thus having a stronger effect on cross-
coupling than the direct response. The inﬂuence of the second ﬂap mode in ﬂight
dynamics is yet to be fully explored and remains a research topic worthy of further
investigation.
Blade dynamic twist will clearly have a major effect on local blade incidence,
ﬂapping and hub moments and can arise from a number of sources. Any offset of
the blade chordwise centre of mass or elastic axis from the quarter chord will result
in a coupling of the ﬂap and torsion DoFs in the elastic modes. The shift of the
chordwise aerodynamic centre due to compressibility, stall or by design through swept
tip planforms will also be a source of torsional moments from the section aerodynamic
pitching moment. References 3.66–3.68 report results of ﬂight dynamics simulation
models that incorporate elastic modes, paying particular attention to the effect of elastic
torsion. For the cases studied in both Ref. 3.67, using the FLIGHTLAB simulation
model, and Ref. 3.68, using the UM-GENHEL simulation model, elastic torsion was
shown to have a negligible effect on aircraft trim, stability and dynamic response;
comparisons were made with test data for the articulated rotor UH-60 helicopter in
hover and forward ﬂight. Articulated rotor helicopters are normally designed so that the
blade pitch control is positioned outboard of the ﬂap and lag hinges, thereby reducing
kinematic couplings. On hingeless rotors, combined ﬂap and lag bending outboard of
the pitch control will produce torsional moments leading to elastic twist of the whole
blade or ﬂexing of the control system. This feature was described in the context of the
design of the Westland Lynx helicopter in Ref. 3.69. The combination of an inboard
ﬂapping element with high lag stiffness and a circular section element with matched
ﬂap and lag stiffnesses outboard of the feathering hinge resulted in a minimization of
torsion–ﬂap–lag coupling on Lynx. For both articulated and hingeless rotors, it should
be clear that the potential for elastic couplings and/or forced torsional response is
quite high, and even with designs that have emphasized the reduction of the sources
of coupled torsional moments, we can expect the combination of many small elastic
and particularly unsteady aerodynamic effects to lead to both transient and steady-state
elastic twist.
Aeroelastic effects clearly complicate rotor dynamics but are likely to be an im-
portant ingredient and a common feature of future high-ﬁdelity rotorcraft simulations.
It will be clear to the serious student of the subject that most of the approximations lie
in the formulation of the aerodynamic theory, particularly the dynamic inﬂow, but the
degree of ‘aeroelastic’ modelling required to complete the feedback loop correctly is
not well researched. As new rotor designs with tailored elastic properties and ‘ﬂexible’
surfaces become mature enough for application, we should expect an associated in-
crease in the motivation for understanding and developing more general and deﬁnitive
rules for the effects of aeroelastics on ﬂight stability and control.

Interactional aerodynamics
The helicopter is characterized by an abundance of interactional aerodynamic effects,
oftenunseenindesignbutpowerfulintheir,usuallyadverse,effectsinﬂight.Aprincipal
sourceofinteractionsisthemainrotorwakeasitdescendsoverthefuselage,empennage
and through the tail rotor disc. The main rotor wake also interacts with the ground and
with itself, in vortex-ring conditions. The modelling problem is therefore largely an
extension of the problem of predicting the wake effects at the rotor disc; for interactional
aerodynamics we are interested in the development of the wake within approximately
one rotor diameter of the rotor. In this space-time frame, the wake is in unsteady
transition between its early form as identiﬁable vorticity and fully developed rolled-up
form, and presents a formidable modelling problem.
In recent times a number of factors have combined to increase the signiﬁcance
of interactional aerodynamics – higher disc loadings resulting in stronger downwash,
more compact conﬁgurations often with relatively large fuselage and empennage areas
and the increased use of helicopters in low level, nap-of-the-earth operations. From a
design perspective, the most useful information relating to interactional aerodynamics
is located in the reports of full and model scale testing. In Ref. 3.44, Prouty discusses
a number of datasets showing the effects of rotor downwash on the empennage. A
review of test results from a period of activity at Boeing helicopters is reported by
Sheridan in Ref. 3.70. In this reference, interactions are classiﬁed into downstream
(e.g., rotor/empennage upset loads, tail rotor/loss of effectiveness), localized (e.g.,
rotor/fuselage download, tail rotor/ﬁn blockage), ground proximity (e.g., trim power,
unsteady loads from ground vortex) and external interaction (e.g., helicopter/helicopter
upset loads, ground winds) categories. One problem that has received considerable at-
tention through testing is the interaction of the rotor downwash with the rear fuselage
(tailboom) at low speed. In Ref. 3.71, Brocklehurst describes the successful implemen-
tation of fuselage strakes to control the separation of the circulatory ﬂow caused by
the downwash ﬂowing over the tailboom in sideways ﬂight. Reference 3.72 discusses
a number of similar test programmes on US helicopters. In all these cases the use of
the strakes reduced the tail rotor control and power requirements, hence recovering the
ﬂight envelope from the restrictions caused by the high tailboom sideforces.
The interaction of the main rotor wake with the tail rotor has been the subject of
an extensive test programme at the DRA Bedford (Refs 3.73, 3.74), aimed at providing
data for interactional modelling developments. In Ref. 3.73, from an analysis of Lynx
ﬂight test data with an instrumented tail rotor, Ellin identiﬁed a number of regions
of the ﬂight envelope where the interactional aerodynamics could be categorized.
Particular attention was paid to the so-called quartering-ﬂight problem, where the
tail rotor control requirements for trim can be considerably different from calculations
basedonanessentiallyisolatedtailrotor.Figure3.44showsaplanviewofthehelicopter
in quartering ﬂight – hovering with a wind from about 45◦to starboard. There exists
a fairly narrow range of wind directions when the tail rotor is exposed to the powerful
effect of the advancing blade tip vortices as they are swept downstream. A similar
situation will arise in quartering ﬂight from the left, although the tail rotor control
margins are considerably greater for this lower (tail rotor) power condition. From a
detailed study of tail rotor pressure data, Ellin was able to identify the passage of
individual main rotor tip vortices through the tail rotor disc. Based on this evidence,
Ellin constructed a Beddoes main rotor wake (Ref. 3.75) and was able to model, in a
semi-empirical manner, the effect of the main rotor vortices on the tail rotor control

margin. Effectively the advancing blade tip vortices introduce a powerful in-plane
velocity component at the tail rotor disc. For the case of the Lynx Mk 5, with its ‘top-
forward’ tail rotor rotation direction, this leads to a reduction in dynamic pressure and
an increase in control angle and power to achieve the same rotor thrust. Tail rotors with
‘top-aft’ rotations (e.g., Lynx Mk 7) do not suffer from this problem, and the control
requirements, at least in right quartering ﬂight, can actually be improved in some
circumstances, although interactions with the aerodynamics of the vertical ﬁn are also
an important ingredient of this complex problem. Figure 3.45 shows the pedal control
margin for Lynx Mk 5 hovering in a wind from all directions ‘around the clock’ out to
30 knots. Figure 3.45(a) presents Ellin’s ﬂight measurements. The limiting condition
corresponding to right quartering ﬂight is shown as the 10% margin contour. The

173
situation in left quartering ﬂight manifests itself in a drawing out of the 60% contour
as shown, although the situation is further complicated in left ﬂight by the tail rotor
experiencing vortex-ring ﬂow states. Figure 3.45(b) shows the same result predicted
by Helisim with an isolated tail rotor; clearly none of the non-uniformities caused
by the interactions with the main rotor wake and ﬁn is present. In comparison, Fig.
3.45(c) shows the Helisim pedal margin results after correction of the dynamic pressure
experienced by the tail rotor, using the Beddoes main rotor wake. The non-uniformities
in quartering ﬂight are now well predicted, although in ﬂight to the left, the predicted
margin is still 10–15% greater than in ﬂight. The results of Ellin’s research point
towards the direction of improved modelling for main rotor wake/tail rotor interactions,
although achieving real-time operation with the kind of prescribed wake used remains
a signiﬁcant task.
A similar investigation into the effects of main rotor wake/tail rotor interaction
on yaw control effectiveness is reported in Ref. 3.76, using the University of Maryland
Advanced Rotor Code (UMARC). For predicting the distribution of main rotor wake
velocity perturbations behind the rotor, a free wake model was used and correlated
against wind-tunnel test data. In general, a good comparison was found, except for the
critical positions close to the main rotor tip vortices where peak velocities some 100%
greater than predicted were measured. Correlation of predicted tail rotor control margin
at the critical quartering ﬂight azimuths was reasonable, although theory typically
underestimated the control margins by about 10–15%. The UMARC analysis was
conducted on an SH-2 helicopter with top-forward tail rotor rotation and the positive
effects of main rotor wake/tail rotor interaction were predicted to be much stronger in
theory than measured in ﬂight. The Maryland research in this area represents one of
the ﬁrst applications of comprehensive rotor modelling to wake/tail interactions and
their effects on ﬂying qualities.
The series of papers by Curtiss and his co-workers at Princeton University report
another important set of ﬁndings in the area of interactional aerodynamics; in this case,
special attention was paid to the effect of the main rotor wake on the empennage (Refs
3.55, 3.77, 3.78). Reference 3.78 compares results using a ‘ﬂat’ prescribed wake (Ref.
3.79) with a free wake (Ref. 3.80) for predicting the induced velocity distribution at
the location of the horizontal stabilizer for a UH-60 helicopter. Comparison of the non-
dimensional downwash (normalized by momentum value of uniform downwash at the
disc) predicted by the two methods, as a function of lateral displacement at the tail
surface, is shown in Fig. 3.46. The UH-60 tailplane has a full span of about 0.5R. The
simpler ﬂat wake captures most of the features in the considerably more complex free
wake model, although the peak velocities from the rolled-up wake on the advancing and
retreating sides are overestimated by about 30% with the ﬂat wake. The much stronger
induced ﬂow on the advancing side of the disc is clearly predicted by both models.
The upwash outside the rotor disc (y/R > 1.0) is also predicted by both models. One
of the applications studied in Ref. 3.78 involved the prediction of cross-coupling from
sideslip into pitch, a characteristic known to feature quite large on the UH-60. From
Figure 3.46, we can deduce that sideslip will give rise to signiﬁcant variations in the
levels of downwash at the horizontal stabilizer – a sideslip of 15◦, for example, will
cause a shift in the downwash pattern by about 0.25R, to left or right. Figure 3.47
compares the pitch rate response to a pedal doublet input at 100 knots; the ﬂight test
results are also plotted for comparison (Ref. 3.78). It can be seen that the powerful
pitching moment, developing during the ﬁrst second of the manoeuvre, is reasonably

Fig. 3.47 Comparison of pitch rate response to pedal input; UH-60, 100 knots (Ref. 3.78)
well predicted by both interactional aerodynamic models. As an aside, we would not
expect to see any pitch response from the Helisim model until the yawing and rolling
motions had developed. The free wake model appears to match ﬂight test fairly well
until the motion has decayed after about 10 s, while the ﬂat wake underpredicts the
oscillatory damping.
Ultimately, the value of interactional aerodynamic modelling will be measured
by its effectiveness at predicting the degrading or enhancing effects on operational

performance. To reiterate, the motivation for developing an increased modelling capa-
bility for use in design and requirements capture, in terms of the potential pay-off, is
very high. Much of the redesign effort on helicopters over the last 30 years has been
driven by the unexpected negative impact of interactional problems (Ref. 3.81), and
there is a real need for renewed efforts to improve the predictive capability of modelling.
This must, of course, be matched by the gathering of appropriate validation test data.
At the time of writing, ‘operational’ simulation models with a comprehensive
treatment of nonlinear, unsteady rotor and interactional aerodynamics are becoming
commonplace in industry, government research laboratories and in academia. Some of
these have been referred to above. The computational power to run blade-element rotor
models, with elastic modes and quite sophisticated aerodynamic effects, in real time, is
nowavailableandaffordable.Thedomainofﬂightdynamicsisrapidlyoverlappingwith
the prediction of loads, vibration, rotor aeroelastic stability and aeroacoustics. Yet the
overall effects on our understanding of helicopter ﬂight dynamics, stemming from the
vigorous developments in recent years, does not appear to have been cumulative. This is
partly because of the human factor – the reservoirs of knowledge are people rather than
reports and journal papers – but there is another important issue. In the author’s view,
the pace associated with our ability to computer-model detailed ﬂuid and structural
dynamics has far outpaced our ability to understand the underlying causal physics.
Even if the ‘perfect’ simulation model existed, its effective use in requirements capture,
design and development would need to be underpinned by our ability to interpret the
outputs meaningfully. While the perfect model does not yet exist, it is the vision of many
rotorcraft engineers, but the achievement of this goal will need to be accompanied by
two companion activities in the author’s view, or not realized at all. First, recalling how
important the interplay between theory and experiment has been in the development
of rotorcraft, conﬁdence in simulation modelling will increase only through validation
against test data. High-quality measurements of surface and ﬂowﬁeld aerodynamics
and component loads are difﬁcult and expensive to make and are often available only
for commercially sensitive programmes. The focus needs to be on ‘generic’ test data,
with an emphasis on manoeuvring ﬂight and into areas at ﬂight envelope boundaries
where nonlinearities govern dynamic behaviour. Second, there needs to be renewed
emphasis on the development of narrow range approximations that truly expose cause
and effect and, just like the critical missing jigsaw piece, provide signiﬁcant insight
and understanding. However, the skills required to build a simulation model and those
required to derive analytic approximations, while complementary, are quite different,
and it is a mistake to assume that the former begets the latter. The importance of these
integrated modelling skills needs to be recognized in university courses and industrial
training programmes or there is a real danger that the analytical skills will be lost in
favour of computational skills. Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned with working with
simulation models, where validation and analytic approximation feature strongly.

3A.1
The inertial motion of the aircraft
In this section we shall derive the equations of translational and rotational motion of a
helicopter assumed to be a rigid body, referred to an axes system ﬁxed at the centre of

 
176
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 3A.1 The fuselage-ﬁxed reference axes system
mass of the aircraft (assumed to be ﬁxed in the aircraft). The axes, illustrated in Fig.
3A.1, move with time-varying velocity components u, v, w and p, q, r, under the action
of applied forces X, Y, Z and L, M, N.
The evolutionary equations of motion can be derived by equating the rates of
change of the linear and angular momentum to the applied forces and moments. Assum-
ing constant mass, the equations are conveniently constructed by selecting an arbitrary
material point, P, inside the fuselage and by deriving the expression for the absolute
acceleration of this point. The acceleration can then be integrated over the fuselage
volume to derive the effective change in angular momentum and hence the total inertia
force. A similar process leads to the angular acceleration and corresponding inertial
moment. The centre of the moving axes is located at the helicopter’s centre of mass,
G. As the helicopter translates and rotates, the axes therefore remain ﬁxed to material
points in the fuselage. This is an approximation since the ﬂapping and lagging motion of
the rotor cause its centre of mass to shift and wobble about some mean position, but we
shall neglect this effect, the mass of the blades being typically <5% of the total mass of
the helicopter. In Fig 3A.1, i, j, k are unit vectors along the x, y and z axes respectively.
We can derive the expression for the absolute acceleration of the material point
P by summing together the acceleration of P relative to G and the acceleration of G
relative to ﬁxed earth. The process is initiated by considering the position vector of the
point P relative to G, namely
rp/g = xi + yj + zk
(3A.1)
The velocity can then be written as
vp/g = ˙rp/g = (˙xi + ˙yj + ˙zk) + (x˙i + y˙j + z ˙k)
(3A.2)
Since the reference axes system is moving, the unit vectors change direction and
therefore have time derivatives; these can be derived by considering small changes in
the angles δθ, about each axis. Hence
δi = jδθz −kδθy

(3A.4)
Deﬁning the angular velocity vector as
ωg = pi + qj + rk
(3A.5)
we note from eqn 3A.4 that the unit vector derivatives can be written as the vector
product
˙i = ωg ∧i
(3A.6)
with similar forms about the j and k axes.
Since the fuselage is assumed to be rigid, the distance of the material point P
from the centre of mass is ﬁxed and the velocity of P relative to G can be written as
vp/g = ωg ∧rp
(3A.7)
or in expanded form as
vp/g = (qz −ry)i + (rx −pz)j + (py −qx)k = u p/gi + v p/gj + w p/gk
(3A.8)
Similarly, the acceleration of P relative to G can be written as
ap/g = ˙vp/g = (˙u p/gi + ˙v p/gj + ˙w p/gk) + (u p/g˙i + v p/g˙j + w p/gk ˙k)
= ap/grel + ωg ∧vp
(3A.9)
or, in expanded form, as
ap/g = (˙u p/g −rv p/g + qw p/g)i + (˙v p/g −pw p/g + ru p/g)j
+ ( ˙w p/g −qu p/g + pv p/g)k
(3A.10)
Writing the inertial velocity (relative to ﬁxed earth) of the aircraft centre of mass, G,
in component form as
vg = ui + vj + wk
(3A.11)
we can write the velocity of P relative to the earth reference as
vp = (u −ry + qz)i + (v −pz + rx)j + (w −qx + py)k
(3A.12)
Similarly, the acceleration of P takes the form
ap = aprel + ωg ∧vp
(3A.13)
or
ap = axi + ayj + azk
(3A.14)

(3A.15)
ay = ˙v −pw + ru −y(p2 + r2) + z(qr −˙p) + x(pq + ˙r)
(3A.16)
az = ˙w −qu + pv −z(p2 + r2) + x(pr −˙q) + y(qr + ˙p)
(3A.17)
These are the components of acceleration of a point distance x, y, z from the centre of
mass when the velocity components of the axes are given by u(t), v(t), w(t) and p(t),
q(t), r(t).
We now assume that the sum of the external forces acting on the aircraft can be
written in component form acting at the centre of mass, i.e.,
Fg = Xi + Yj + Zk
(3A.18)
If the material point, P, consists of an element of mass dm, then the total inertia
force acting on the fuselage is the sum of all elemental forces; the equations of motion
thus take the component forms
X =

(3A.19)
Y =

Since G is the centre of mass, then by deﬁnition

z dm = 0
(3A.22)
and the mass of the aircraft is given by

The translational equations of motion of the aircraft are therefore given by the relatively
simple equations
X = Ma(˙u −rv + qw)
Y = Ma(˙v −pw + ru)
Z = Ma( ˙w −qu + pv)

Thus, in addition to the linear acceleration of the centre of mass, the inertial loading

(3A.33)
which are the rotational equations of motion of the aircraft.

The product of inertia, Ixz, is retained because of the characteristic asymmetry of
the fuselage shape in the xz plane, giving typical values of Ixz comparable to Ixx.
3A.2
The orientation problem – angular coordinates of the aircraft
The helicopter fuselage can take up a new position by rotations about three independent
directions. The new position is not unique, since the ﬁnite orientations are not vector
quantities, and the rotation sequence is not permutable. The standard sequence used
in ﬂight dynamics is yaw, ψ, pitch, θ, and roll, φ, as illustrated in Fig. 3A.2. We can
consider the initial position as a quite general one and the fuselage is ﬁrst rotated about
the z-axis (unit vector k0) through the angle ψ (yaw). The unit vectors in the rotated
frame can be related to those in the original frame by the transformation , i.e.,

(3A.34)
Next, the fuselage is rotated about the new y-axis (unit vector j1) through the (pitch)
angle θ, i.e.,

Since all the transformation matrices are themselves orthogonal, i.e.,

the product is also orthogonal, hence

Of particular interest is the relationship between the time rate of change of the orien-
tation angles and the fuselage angular velocities in the body axes system, i.e.,
ωg = pi2 + qj2 + rk2
= ˙ψk0 + ˙θj1 + ˙φi2
(3A.41)
Using eqns 3A.34–3A.36, we can derive
p = ˙φ −˙ψ sin θ
q = ˙θ cos φ + ˙ψ sin φ cos θ
r = −˙θ sin φ + ˙ψ cos φ cos θ
(3A.42)
3A.3
Components of gravitational acceleration along the aircraft axes
The relationships derived in Appendix Section 3A.2 are particularly important in ﬂight
dynamics as the gravitational components appear in the equations of motion in terms
of the so-called Euler angles, θ, φ, ψ, while the aerodynamic forces are referenced
directly to the fuselage angular motion. We assume for helicopter ﬂight dynamics
that the gravitational force always acts in the vertical sense and the components in
the fuselage-ﬁxed axes are therefore easily obtained with reference to the transforma-
tion matrix given in eqn 3A.40. The gravitational acceleration components along the
fuselage x, y and z axes can therefore be written in terms of the Euler roll and pitch
angles as
axg = −g sin θ
ayg = g cos θ sin φ
azg = g cos θ cos φ

The rotor system – kinematics of a blade element
The components of velocity and acceleration of a blade element relative to the air
through which it is travelling, and the inertial axes system, are important for calculating
the blade dynamics and loads. When the hub is ﬁxed, the only accelerations experienced
by a ﬂapping blade are due to the centrifugal force and out-of-plane motion. When
the hub is free to translate and rotate, then the velocities and accelerations of the hub
contribute to the accelerations at a blade element. We begin with an analysis of the
transformation between vectors in the non-rotating hub reference system and vectors
in the blade axes system.
Figure 3A.3 illustrates the hub reference axes, with the x and y directions oriented
parallel to the fuselage axes centred at the centre of mass. The z direction is directed
downwards along the rotor shaft, which, in turn, is tilted forward relative to the fuselage
z-axis by an angle γs. The blade referenced axes system has the positive x direction
along the blade quarter chord line. The zero azimuth position is conventionally at the
rear of the disc as shown in the ﬁgure, with the positive rotation anticlockwise when
viewed from above, i.e., in the negative sense about the z-axis. Positive ﬂapping is
upwards. The positive y and z directions are such that the blade and hub systems align
when the ﬂapping is zero and the azimuth angle is 180◦.
We shall derive the relationship between components in the rotating and non-
rotating systems by considering the unit vectors. The orientation sequence is ﬁrst
azimuth, then ﬂap. Translational and angular velocities and accelerations in the hub
system can be related to the blade system by the transformation

where γs is the forward tilt of the rotor shaft, and hR and xcg are the distances of
the rotor hub relative to the aircraft centre of mass, along the negative z direction and
forward x direction (fuselage reference axes) respectively.
It is more convenient, in the derivation of rotor kinematics and loads, to refer
to a non-rotating hub axes system which is aligned with the resultant velocity in the
plane of the rotor disc; we refer to this system as the hub–wind system, with subscript
hw. The translational velocity vector of the hub can therefore be written with just two
components, i.e.,
vhw = uhwihw + whwkhw
(3A.47)
The angular velocity of the hub takes the form
ωhw = phwihw + qhwjhw + rhwkhw

Similarly, the blade accelerations can be derived, but in this case the number of terms
increases considerably. The dominant effects are due to the acceleration of the blade
element relative to the hub, with the centrifugal and Coriolis inertia forces giving values
typically greater than 500 g at the blade tip. Blade normal accelerations are an order of
magnitude smaller than this, but are still an order of magnitude greater than the mean
accelerations of the aircraft centre of mass and rotor hub. We shall therefore neglect
the translational accelerations of the hub and many of the smaller nonlinear terms due
to products of hub and blade velocities. The approximate acceleration components at
the blade station are then given by the expressions

The underscored components are the primary effects due to centrifugal and Coriolis
forces and the angular accelerations of the hub, although the latter are also quite small
in most cases. For practical purposes, we can usually make the additional assumption
that the rotorspeed is much higher than the fuselage yaw rate, so that
( −rhw) ≈

Rotor reference planes – hub, tip path and no-feathering
In rotor dynamics analysis, three natural reference axes systems have found application
in various texts and reports – the hub (or shaft) system, the tip-path plane (or no-
ﬂapping) system and the no-feathering system. These are illustrated in Fig. 3A.4, where
the hub plane has been drawn horizontal for convenience. In this book we consistently
use the hub system but it is useful to compare expressions for key rotor quantities in
the three systems. The motivation for adopting the rotor-oriented no-ﬂapping or no-
feathering systems is that they greatly simplify the expressions for the rotor X and Y
forces, as shown in Ref. 3A.1 The no-feathering axes are equivalent to the, so-called,
control axes when the rotor pitch/ﬂap coupling is zero. The control axis is aligned
along the swash plate.
Assuming small angles, the normalized velocities in the rotor systems are related
to those in the hub system by the approximate relationships
µtp = µh + µzh β1c
µztp = µzh −µh β1c
(3A.57)

and
µnf = µh −µzh θ1s
µznf = µzh + µh θ1s
(3A.58)
Similarly, the disc incidences are given by the expressions
αtp = αh −β1c
αnf = αh + θ1s
(3A.59)
and the non-rotating rotor forces are given as
Xnf = Xh −T θ1s
Xtp = Xh + Tβ1c
(3A.60)
Ytp = Yh −Tβ1s
Ynf = Yh −T θ1c
(3A.61)
where it is assumed that the rotor thrust T and Z forces in the three systems have the
same magnitude and opposite directions.
In hover, the alignment of the tip-path plane and the no-feathering plane highlights
the equivalence of ﬂapping and feathering. These expressions are valid only for rotors
with ﬂap articulation at the centre of rotation. Elastic motion of hingeless rotors and
ﬂapping of articulated rotors with offset ﬂap hinges cannot be described with these
rotor axes systems. It should also be noted that the induced inﬂow discussed earlier in
this chapter, λ, is strictly referred to the tip-path plane, giving the inﬂow normal to the
hub plane as
λh = λtp −µβ1c
(3A.62)
This effect is taken into account in the derivation of the rotor torque given in this
chapter (eqn 3.116), but not in the iterative calculation of λ. The small ﬂap angle
approximation will give negligible errors for trim ﬂight, but could be more signiﬁcant
during manoeuvres when the ﬂapping angles are large.

Modelling helicopter ﬂight dynamics:
trim and stability analysis
The challenge and responsibility of modern engineering practice demand
ahighlevelofcreativeactivitywhich,inturn,requiresthesupportofstrong
analytical capability. The primary focus should be on the engineering
signiﬁcance of physical quantities with the mathematical structure acting
in a supporting role.
(Meriam 1966)
4.1
Introduction and Scope
Meriam’s words of advice at the head of this chapter should act as a guiding light for
engineers wishing to strengthen their skills in ﬂight dynamics (Ref. 4.1). In Chapter 3
we sought to describe the physics and mathematics required for building a simulation
model of helicopter ﬂight behaviour. This chapter takes the products of this work and
develops various forms of analysis to gain insight into how helicopters behave the
way they do, hence establishing the engineering signiﬁcance of the physics. Within
the framework illustrated in our reference Fig. 4.1, the mechanics of helicopter ﬂight
can be described in terms of three aspects – trim, stability and response – as shown by
the regions highlighted in the ﬁgure. The trim problem concerns the control positions
required to hold the helicopter in equilibrium. The aircraft may be climbing, turning
and may be at large angles of incidence and sideslip, but if the three translational
velocity components are constant with the controls ﬁxed, then the aircraft is in trim.
Strictly, climbing and diving ﬂight cannot be described as trim conditions, because the
changing air density will require continual corrections to the controls. Provided the
rates of climb or descent are relatively small, however, the helicopter will be, practically
speaking, in trim. Stability is concerned with the behaviour of the aircraft following a
disturbance from trim. Classically, static stability is determined by the initial tendency
(i.e., will the aircraft tend to return to, or depart from, the initial trim?), while dynamic
stability concerns longer term effects. These are useful physical concepts and will
be embraced within the more general theory of the stability of the natural modes of
motion, developed from the linear theory of ﬂight mechanics. Response to pilot control
inputs and to atmospheric disturbances are essentially nonlinear problems, but some
insight can be gained from extending the linear approximations to ﬁnite amplitude
motion. We shall return to response in Chapter 5. Trim, stability and response make up
the ﬂying characteristics. Later in Chapters 6 and 7, the reader will ﬁnd that these
ﬂying characteristics are part of the domain of ﬂying qualities. These later chapters
will be concerned with how to quantify and measure ﬂying quality, while here in
Chapters 4 and 5 we are more interested in the physical mechanisms that generate the
response.

Fig. 4.1 The territory of helicopter ﬂight mechanics
Typical problems tackled by the ﬂight dynamicist through mathematical mod-
elling include
(1) determination of the control margins at the operational ﬂight envelope (OFE) and
safe ﬂight envelope (SFE);
(2) design of ﬂight control laws that confer Level 1 handling qualities throughout the
OFE;
(3) simulation of the effects of tail rotor drive failure in forward ﬂight – establish the
pitch, roll and yaw excursions after 3 s;
(4) derivation of the sensitivity of roll attitude bandwidth to rotor ﬂapping stiffness;
(5) establishing the tailplane size required to ensure natural pitch stability at high
speed;
(6) determination of the effects of main rotor blade twist on power required for various
missions;
(7) establishing the maximum take-off weight, hence payload, of a twin-engine heli-
copter while conforming to the civil certiﬁcation requirements for ﬂy-away capa-
bility following a single engine failure;
(8) assessment and comparison of various candidate aircraft’s ability to meet the ﬂying
qualities standard – ADS-33.
Of course, we could continue adding more tasks, but the range of problems has, hope-
fully, been adequately demonstrated with the above list. Setting down this ‘short list’
of activities, some of which the author has been intimately involved with over the past
20 years, serves as a reminder of the importance of modelling in aircraft design and
development – relying on experiment to tackle these problems would be prohibitively
expensive. This is, of course, not to devalue or diminish the importance of ﬂight
testing.

 
Trim and Stability Analysis
189
Before we engage the supporting mathematics for describing the trim and stability
problems, it may be useful for the reader to explore how all three are encapsulated in
the relatively simple problem of heave motion in vertical ﬂight. The key equations
taken from Chapter 3 relate to the thrust coefﬁcient CT and uniform component of
inﬂow λ0 through the rotor (eqns 3.91, 3.139):
2CT
a0s = θ0
3 + µz −λ0
2
+ θtw
4
(4.1)
λ0 =
CT
2(λ0 −µZ)
(4.2)
This approximation of uniform rotor inﬂow is strictly applicable only when the blade
twist has the ideal variation, inversely proportional to radius, giving constant circulation
across the rotor and minimum induced drag. Linear blade washout of 10◦or more
generally gives a reasonably good approximation to the ideal loading.
In its simplest form, the trim problem amounts to determining the collective pitch
θ0 required to hold a hover, which is often written in terms of the equivalent pitch at
the three-quarter radius, rather than at the rotor hub; i.e., from eqns 4.1 and 4.2, we
can write
θ 3
4 R = θ0 + 3
4θtw = 3

(4.3)
For moderate values of thrust coefﬁcient (CT −0.007) and typical values of solidity
(s = Nbc/π R ∼0.09), the collective required to hover is approximately doubled by
the presence of the induced velocity. The rotor torque required is then the sum of the
induced and proﬁle contributions (eqn 3.116)
CQ = CQi + CQp = C1.5

+ CQp
(4.4)
showing the nonlinear relationship between torque and thrust in hover.
The trim problem is generally formulated as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.
In the case examined, the unique solution was obtained by simple rearrangement. In
a more general trim, when the relevant equations are coupled, this will not be as
straightforward and recourse to numerical solutions will be necessary.
Analysis of the dynamic stability and response problems requires the formulation
of the equation of motion relating the normal acceleration to the applied thrust
˙w =
Z
Ma
= −T
Ma
(4.5)
Stability and response characteristics may be assessed (in the ﬁrst approximation) by
analysis of the linearized form of the nonlinear eqn 4.5. We write the normal velocity
(w = Rµz in hover) as the sum of a trim or equilibrium value (subscript e) and a
perturbation value
w = We + δw
(4.6)

 
190
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
If we assume that the Z force acting on the helicopter in the hover is an analytic function
of the control θ0 and normal velocity w, together with their time rates of change, then
the force can be expanded as a Taylor series about the trim value (Ref. 4.2), in the form
Z = Ze + ∂Z
∂w δw + ∂Z
∂θ0
δθ0 + 1
2
∂2Z
∂w2 w2 + · · · + ∂Z
∂˙w δ ˙w + · · ·
(4.7)
In the simple form of thrust equation given by eqn 4.5, there are no unsteady aerody-
namic effects and hence there are no explicit acceleration derivatives. For small and
slow changes in w (i.e., δw) and θ0 (i.e., δθ0), the ﬁrst two (linear) perturbation terms
in eqn 4.7 will approximate the changes in the applied force, i.e.,
Z ≈Ze + ∂Z
∂w δw + ∂Z
∂θ0
δθ0
(4.8)
The stability problem concerns the nature of the solution of the homogeneous equation
˙w −Zww = 0
(4.9)
where we have subsumed the aircraft mass Ma within the heave damping derivative
Zw without any dressing, which is normal practice in helicopter ﬂight dynamics, i.e.,
Zw ≡Zw
Ma
(4.10)
In eqn 4.9, we have used lowercase w for the perturbation in heave velocity away
from the trim condition (cf. eqn 4.8 δw →w, assumed small). This will be the general
practice throughout this book, lowercase u, v and w, p, q and r denoting either total
or perturbation velocities, depending upon the context. It is clear that the solution of
eqn 4.9 will be stable if and only if Zw is strictly negative, as then the solution will be
a simple exponential subsidence.
The heave damping derivative can be estimated from the derivative of thrust

giving the result
Zw = −2a0 Abρ(R)λ0
(16λ0 + a0s)Ma
(4.12)
which ensures stability. The damping derivative, or the heave eigenvalue (see Appendix
4B), typically has a value of between −0.25 and −0.4 (1/s) and, from eqn 4.12, is a
linear function of lift curve slope, a0, and is inversely proportional to blade loading
(Ma/Ab). The natural time constant of helicopter vertical motion in hover is therefore
relatively large, falling between 4 and 2.5 s.
The response to small collective control inputs is governed by the inhomogeneous
linear differential equation
˙w −Zww = Zθ0 θ0(t)
(4.13)

(4.15)
The ratio of the control derivative to the heave damping gives the steady-state response
in heave velocity to a step change in collective pitch as
wss = −4
3R θ0
(4.16)
The rate sensitivity, or the steady-state rate per degree of collective, is seen to be
a function of tip speed only. The rate of climb following a step input in collective is
therefore independent of disc loading, lift curve slope, air density and solidity according
to the simplifying assumptions of momentum theory. These assumptions, of which
uniform inﬂow and constant lift curve slope are probably the most signiﬁcant, were
discussed at the beginning of Chapter 3.
The nature of the response to a vertical gust was described in some detail in
Chapter 2, the equation of motion taking the form
˙w −Zww = Zwwg(t)
(4.17)
The initial vertical acceleration is given by the product of the heave damping and the
gust strength. A vertical gust of 5 m/s gives rise to a bump of about 0.2 g for the higher
levels of vertical damping. Reducing the blade loading has a powerful effect on the
sensitivity to vertical gusts according to eqn 4.12, although overall, the helicopter is
relatively insensitive to vertical gusts in the hover.
Helicopter vertical motion in hover is probably the simplest to analyse, but even
here our simplifying approximations break down at higher frequencies and amplitudes,
as unsteady aerodynamics, blade stall and rotor dynamic effects alter the details of the
motion considerably. We shall return to this example later in Chapter 5. More general
helicopter motions, in both hover and forward ﬂight, tend to be coupled, and adequate
single degree of freedom (DoF) descriptions are a rarity. As we progress through
Chapters 4 and 5 however, the approach outlined above will form the pattern – that is,
taking the basic nonlinear equations from Chapter 3 for trim and then linearizing for
stability, control and small perturbation response analysis.
Chapter 4 is structured as follows. The techniques for describing and analysing
trim and stability are set down in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively. The expressions
for the general trim problem will be derived, i.e., a turning, climbing/descending,
sideslipping manoeuvre. Stability analysis requires linearization about a trim point
and an examination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. The key, 6 DoF,
stability and control derivatives will be highlighted and their physical signiﬁcance
described. The natural modes of motion predicted from 6 DoF theory are also described.
One of the major aids to physical interpretation of helicopter dynamic behaviour comes
from the various approximations to the full equations of motion. Section 4.3 deals with

 
192
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
this topic, principally with linear, narrow range approximations that highlight how the
various aerodynamic effects interact to shape the natural modes of helicopter motion.
Working with modelling approximations is at the heart of a ﬂight dynamics engineer’s
practice, and we aim to give this area ample attention in both Chapters 4 and 5 to help
the serious reader develop the required skills. The underlying mathematical methods
used draw heavily on the theory of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces, and Appendix 4A
presentsasummaryofthekeyresultsrequiredtogainmaximumvaluefromthischapter.
The theory of the stability of helicopter motion will be continued in Chapter 5,
with special emphasis on constrained motion. The response problem is inherently
nonlinear and typical behaviour will also be described in Chapter 5, with solutions
from forward and inverse simulation. Discussion on some of the important differences
between results using quasi-steady and higher order rotor models is also deferred until
Chapter 5.
In order that some of the fundamental physical concepts of helicopter ﬂight me-
chanics can be discussed in terms of analytical expressions, it is necessary to make
gross approximations regarding the rotor dynamic and aerodynamic behaviour. We
include all the assumptions associated with Level 1 modelling as discussed at the be-
ginning of Chapter 3, and then go further to assume a simple trapezoidal downwash
ﬁeld and ignore the in-plane lift loads in the calculation of rotor forces and moments.
These latter effects can be important, but assuming that the lift forces are normal to the
disc plane leads to a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in the trim and stability analyses. In most
cases, this assumption leads to results that are 80% or more of the answer derived from
considerably more complex rotor modelling and the resulting approximate theory can
be used to gain the ﬁrst-order insight into ﬂight dynamics, which is particularly useful
for the prediction of trends and in preliminary design.
We have already referred to Appendix 4A, containing the background theory of
vector–matrix mechanics; two additional appendices complete the Chapter 4 series.
Appendix Section 4B.1 presents the conﬁguration datasets, including aerodynamic,
structural, mass and geometric properties, for the three aircraft used in this book –
the Lynx, Puma and Bo105. Appendix Section 4B.2 presents, in graphical form, the
completesetofstabilityandcontrolderivativesforthethreeaircraftpredictedfromtwo-
sided numerical perturbations applied to the full Helisim nonlinear equations of motion.
In the second edition of the book, a new Appendix Section 4B.3, presenting these
derivatives and associated eigenvalues, is included. An analysis of the trim orientation
problem is given in Appendix 4C.
4.2
Trim Analysis
The simplest trim concept is portrayed in Figs 4.2(a)–(c). The helicopter, ﬂying forward
in straight trimmed ﬂight, is assumed to consist of a main and tail rotor with a fuselage
experiencing only a drag force. The rotor is assumed to be teetering in ﬂap, with no
moments transmitted through the hub to the fuselage, and the centre of mass lies on
the shaft, below the rotor. Assuming the fuselage pitch and roll attitudes are small, the
following elementary model of trim can be constructed.
The balance of forces in the vertical direction gives the thrust approximately equal
to the weight
T ≈W
(4.18)

 
Trim and Stability Analysis
193
Fig. 4.2 Simple consideration of trim in hover: (a) longitudinal (view from port);
(b) yaw (view from above); (c) roll (view from front)
This condition actually holds true up to moderate forward speeds for most helicopters.
Balancing the forces along forward fuselage axis gives the approximate pitch angle as
the ratio of drag to thrust
θ ≈−D
T
(4.19)
Since the thrust remains essentially constant in trimmed straight ﬂight, the pitch angle
follows the drag and varies as the square of forward speed. In our simple model, the
absence of any aerodynamic pitching moment from the fuselage or tail requires that
the hub moment is zero, or that the disc has zero longitudinal ﬂapping.

 
194
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
From Fig. 4.2(b), the tail rotor thrust can be written as the main rotor torque
divided by the tail arm
TT ≈QR
lT
(4.20)
The tail rotor thrust therefore has the same form as the main rotor torque, with the
bucket at minimum main rotor power. In practice, the vertical ﬁn is usually designed
to produce a sideforce in forward ﬂight, hence reducing the thrust required from the
tail rotor. Figure 4.2(c) then shows the balance of rolling moment from the main and
tail rotors, to give the lateral disc ﬂapping
β1s ≈hT TT
hRT
(4.21)
Thus, the disc tilts to port, for anticlockwise rotors, and the disc tilt varies as the tail
rotor thrust.
The balance of sideforce gives the bank angle
φ ≈


(4.22)
If the tail rotor is located at the same height above the fuselage reference line as the
main rotor, then the required bank angle is zero, for this simple helicopter design. In
practice, the two terms in the numerator of eqn 4.22 are of the same order and the
neglected in-plane lift forces have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the resulting bank angle.
From the force and moment balance can be derived the required control angles –
main/tail rotor collectives producing the required thrusts and the lateral cyclic from the
lateral disc tilt.
4.2.1
The general trim problem
The elementary analysis outlined above illustrates the primary mechanisms of trim
and provides some insight into the required pilot trim strategy, but is too crude to
be of any real practical use. The most general trim condition resembles a spin mode
illustrated in Fig. 4.3. The spin axis is always directed vertically in the trim, thus
ensuring that the rates of change of the Euler angles θ and φ are both zero, and hence the
gravitational force components are constant. The aircraft can be climbing or descending
and ﬂying out of lateral balance with sideslip. The general condition requires that the
rate of change of magnitude of the velocity vector is identically zero. Considering
eqns 3.1–3.6 from Chapter 3, we see that the trim forms reduce to

where the reader is reminded that the subscript e refers to the equilibrium condition.
For the case where the turn rate is zero, the applied aerodynamic loads, Xe, Ye and
Ze, balance the gravitational force components and the applied moments Le, Me
and Ne are zero. For a non-zero turn rate, the non-zero inertial forces and moments
(centrifugal, Coriolis, gyroscopic) are included in the trim balance. For our ﬁrst-order
approximation, we assume that the applied forces and moments are functions of the
translational velocities (u, v, w), the angular velocities (p, q,r) and the rotor controls
(θ0, θ1s, θ1c, θ0T ). The Euler angles are given by the relationship between the body axis
angular rates and the rate of change of Euler angle , the turn rate about the vertical
axis, given in eqn 3A.42, i.e.,
Pe = −˙e sin e

The combination of 13 unknowns and 9 equations means that to deﬁne a unique
solution, four of the variables may be viewed as arbitrary and must be prescribed. The
prescription is itself somewhat arbitrary, although particular groupings have become
more popular and convenient than others. We shall concern ourselves with the classic
case where the four prescribed trim states are deﬁned as in Fig. 4.3, i.e.,

In Appendix 4C, the relationships between the prescribed trim conditions and the body

vector, both onto the horizontal plane, is given by the numerical solution of a nonlinear
equation. Since the trim eqns 4.23–4.28 are nonlinear, and are usually solved iteratively,
initial values of some of the unknown ﬂight states need to be estimated before they
are calculated. In the following sequence of calculations, initial values are estimated
for the Euler pitch and roll angles e and e, the rotorspeed R, the main and tail
rotor uniform downwash components λ0 and λ0T and the main rotor lateral ﬂapping
angle β1s.
The solution of the trim problem can be found by using a number of different
techniques, many of which are available as closed software packages, that ﬁnd the
minimum of a set of nonlinear equations within deﬁned constraints. The sequential
process outlined below and summarized in Fig. 4.4 is recognized as rather inefﬁcient
in view of the multiple iteration loops – one for pitch, one for roll, one for rotorspeed
and one for each of the downwash components – but it does enable us to describe a
sequence of partial trims, provides some physical insight into the trim process and can
assist in identifying ‘trim locks’, or regions of the ﬂight envelope where it becomes
difﬁcult or even impossible to ﬁnd a trim solution. The process is expanded as a
sequence in Fig. 4.5. The ﬁrst stage is the computation of the aerodynamic velocities,
enabling the fuselage forces and moments to be calculated, using the initial estimates
of aerodynamic incidence angles. The three iteration loops can then be cycled.
4.2.2
Longitudinal partial trim
The main rotor thrust coefﬁcient, longitudinal ﬂapping and fuselage pitch attitude are
calculated from the three longitudinal equations (A, B and C in Fig. 4.5). At this point,
a comparison with the previous estimated value of pitch attitude is made; if the new
estimate is close to the previous one, deﬁned by the tolerance vθ, then the partial
longitudinal trim is held and the process moves on to the lateral/directional trim. If the
iteration has not converged to within the tolerance, the process returns to the start and
repeats until convergence is satisﬁed. Note that the new estimate of pitch attitude in
Fig. 4.5 is given by
ei = ei−1 + kθi

where
e = gθ

(4.33)
In some cases the iteration can diverge away from, rather than converge towards,
the true solution, and the value of the ‘damping factor’ kθ can be selected to ensure
convergence; the smaller (<1) the k factor, the slower, but more stable, is the iterative
process. The key calculations in this longitudinal phase of the trim algorithm are the
thrust coefﬁcient, the longitudinal disc ﬂapping and the pitch angle itself. For straight
ﬂight, the thrust remains relatively constant; in turning manoeuvres, the inertial term in
the normal acceleration az, predominantly the UeQe term, will result in an increased
thrust. The longitudinal ﬂapping is derived from a more complicated expression, but
essentially the rotor needs to ﬂap to balance the resultant of the aerodynamic moments
from the fuselage and empennage in straight ﬂight. If the tail rotor is canted then
an additional ﬂap component will be required. Many helicopters are designed with a

forward main rotor shaft tilt so that, at the cruise condition, the fuselage is level and
the one-per-rev longitudinal ﬂapping is zero or very small. We have already noted that
the pitch angle is essentially derived from the ratio of drag to thrust, hence exhibiting
a quadratic form with forward speed.
Figure 4.6(a) illustrates the variation of pitch angle with speed for Helisim Bo105
together with a comparison against the DLR ﬂight measurements. Note the hover pitch
attitude of about 3◦, due to the forward shaft tilt. The transition region is typically
characterized by an increase in pitch angle as the main rotor downwash impinges on

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 4.6 Pitch angle in trim: (a) Trim pitch angle as a function of forward
speed – comparison of ﬂight and theory; (b) Trim pitch angle as a function of turn rate
the horizontal stabilizer; this effect is evident in the ﬂight, but not well predicted by
simulation. Some helicopters feature a movable horizontal stabilizer to reduce this
pitch-up tendency at low speed and to maintain a level fuselage in high-speed ﬂight. In
forward ﬂight, the comparison between ﬂight and theory suggests a higher full-scale
value of fuselage drag than that used in the simulation; this is typical of the comparison
with this level of modelling, with the simulation underpredicting the fuselage nose-
down pitch at high speed by as much as 2◦. In non-straight ﬂight, the trim pitch
angle will vary with turn rate and ﬂight path angle. The strongest variations occur in
climbing and descending ﬂight, and Fig. 4.6(b) illustrates the kind of effect found on
Lynx in climbs. The turn rate extends out to 0.4 rad/s, corresponding to a bank angle
of nearly 60◦at the 80-knot condition shown. As the climb rate increases, indicated
by the increasingly negative ﬂight path angle, the pitch angle to trim rises markedly; a
negative ﬂight path angle of −0.15 rad corresponds to a climb rate of about 1200 ft/min
at the 80 knots trim speed. The increased pitch attitude at this steep bank angle is
required to maintain zero sideslip. If the nose were set on the horizon in this condition

Fig. 4.7 Longitudinal ﬂapping for Lynx and Puma as a function of forward speed
then the sideslip angle would correspond to the pitch angle shown in Fig. 4.6(b); the
correct pitch attitude is achieved by balancing the turn with pedals, rather than pulling
back on the cyclic stick.
One further point on longitudinal trim relates to the differences between heli-
copters with different rotor types. Since the pitch angle is determined primarily by the
ratio of drag to lift on the whole vehicle, we should not expect to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
differences in pitch attitude to trim between hingeless and articulated rotor helicopters,
but we might expect to see differences in longitudinal ﬂapping angle. Note the previous
observation that the longitudinal ﬂapping will compensate for any residual moment on
the other helicopter components. Figure 4.7 compares the longitudinal disc tilt for the
Lynx and Puma across the speed range. The large difference in trim ﬂap at hover is
partly due to the different baseline centre of gravity (cg) locations for the two aircraft.
The Puma cg lies practically under the hub at the fuselage reference point; the hover
ﬂap-back then almost equates to the forward shaft tilt. For the Lynx, with its aft cg
lying practically on the shaft axis, the hover ﬂap is close to zero. For both aircraft, as
forward speed increases, the disc tilts further forward, implying that the residual pitch
moment from both aircraft is nose up (i.e., from the horizontal stabilizer). The change
in disc tilt for both aircraft is only about 1.5◦across the speed range.
4.2.3
Lateral/directional partial trim
Satisfaction of the longitudinal trim at this stage in Fig. 4.5 does not guarantee a valid
trim; estimates of the lateral trim have been used and the process now has to continue
with the aim of correcting both of these. Having derived a new estimate for the lateral
trim, the longitudinal cycle will then need to be repeated until all six force and moment
equations balance properly. But the next stage in Fig. 4.5 involves the calculation of
a new value for the main rotor downwash (D in Fig. 4.5), which is itself an iterative
process (see Chapter 3), and the estimation of the main rotor torque and power required
(E). With these calculations performed, the tail rotor thrust can be estimated from the
yawing moment equation (F), the lateral ﬂapping corrected from the rolling moment

equation (G) and the new value of roll attitude derived from the sideforce equation
(H). A check is now made on the convergence of the roll attitude in the same way
as described for the pitch attitude, with deﬁned convergence tolerance and damping
factor. For both pitch and roll attitude, the number of iterations required, and hence
the speed of convergence, depends critically on the initial guesses; clearly, the further
away from the correct solution that the initial guess is, the longer will convergence take.
For straight ﬂight, setting the initial values to zero is usually adequate for fairly rapid
convergence.Figure4.8(a)showsthevariationinrollattitudewithforwardspeedforthe
Lynx, illustrating the powerful effect of adding the in-plane lift loads in the calculation
of rotor sideforce (see Chapter 3). In turning ﬂight, the bank angle will become large,
and an initial guess based on the rules of simple circular motion is usually sufﬁcient
to ensure rapid convergence, i.e.,

Fig. 4.9 Lynx trimmed in sideslipping ﬂight at 100 knots
Figure 4.8(b) shows how the Lynx roll attitude varies with turn rate at the 80-knot trim
point. The approximate result given by eqn 4.34 is plotted for comparison and shows
how accurate by this simple kinematic relationship predicts the Lynx result.
At large turn rates, in forward ﬂight, the roll attitude iteration can become sensitive
to the sign of the error between the initial guess and the correct solution. If the initial
 results in a lateral acceleration greater than the weight component, then this simple
trim procedure will diverge, no matter how much damping is added. The trim iteration
will converge only when a  estimate greater than the solution is introduced. These
details will need to be considered when a simple trim algorithm is used, but they are
usually catered for in the more sophisticated nonlinear numerical search algorithms.
In sideslip ﬂight, the bank angle also varies signiﬁcantly as shown in Fig. 4.9, where
Lynx trim results for bank angle, ﬂapping angles and tail rotor thrust coefﬁcient are
plotted. The bank angle is approximately linear with sideslip up to about 30◦, with
both aerodynamic and gravitational sideforces on the aircraft varying approximately
as sin β. Longitudinal ﬂapping increases at a greater rate than lateral ﬂapping, as the
rotor thrust is tilted further forward to compensate for the increased drag in sideslip
ﬂight.
4.2.4
Rotorspeed/torque partial trim
When the lateral and directional trim have converged, the tail rotor downwash is cal-
culated (I), followed by the tail rotor collective (J), including the effect of the δ3
pitch/ﬂap coupling (K), and tail rotor torque (L). The total engine torque required can
now be calculated, from which the rotorspeed can be updated using the droop law
(M in Fig. 4.5). The rotorspeed calculation is the ﬁnal stage in the iterative cycle and
the whole sequential process described above must be repeated until convergence is
achieved.
The remaining calculations in Fig. 4.5 determine the main rotor control angles,
ﬁrst in the hub/wind axes system (N, O) (see the Appendix Section 3A.4), followed by
a transformation into hub axes, to give the swash plate control outputs (P). We shall
return to discuss the controls to trim below in Section 4.2.6.

Balance of forces and moments
Trim is concerned with balancing the forces and moments acting on the aircraft. A
typical trim is given by Table 4.1, where the various contributions to the forces and
moments are given for a Lynx in a climbing turn (case γ f e = −0.15 rad, ae = 0.4
rad/s in Fig. 4.6(b)).
For our approximate model, many of the second-order effects have been neglected
as can be seen in Table 4.1. (e.g., the X force from the empennage and X and Z force
from the tail rotor, the fuselage rolling moment and tail rotor pitching moment). The
inertial force components along the body axes are seen to be large, arising from the
centrifugal force due to the angular motion of the aircraft. For the case shown, the trim
tolerances were set at values that left the residual forces and moments as shown in the
‘Totals’ row. With zero initial value for pitch attitude and roll attitude set by eqn 4.34,
convergence can usually be achieved to these levels of force within a few iterations.
4.2.6
Control angles to support the forces and moments
At this point in the trim algorithm, the various forces and moments on the compo-
nents are, practically speaking, balanced, and now we have to look at the internal rotor
equations to compute the controls required to hold these forces. The main rotor control
angles are derived from the inverse of the ﬂapping angle calculations given in the 3.60
series of equations (see Chapter 3), coupled with the thrust coefﬁcient equation for
the collective pitch. Figures 4.10(a)–(d) show a comparison between ﬂight and theory
of the main and tail rotor controls for the Bo105 as a function of forward speed. The
errors give an indication of the level of ﬁdelity achievable with the Level 1 modelling
of Chapter 3. The nonlinear aerodynamic and blade twist effects increase the collective
pitch required in ﬂight relative to Helisim. As noted above in the discussion on lon-
gitudinal trim, the downwash over the tail causes a pitch up in the low-speed regime,
giving rise to an increase in the required forward cyclic; the comparison for the Bo105
is actually very good in the mid-speed region (Fig. 4.10(a)). Also at low speed and
into the transition region, the inﬂow roll increases the left cyclic required, revealing a
failing in the simple trapezoidal model of longitudinal inﬂow predicted by the Glauert
representation (Fig. 4.10(b)). The comparison of main rotor collective pitch is illus-
trated in Fig. 4.10(c). The underprediction by about 10% in hover, increasing to over
30% at high speed, is typical of linear aerodynamic theory. The tail rotor pitch is also
usually underpredicted (Fig. 4.10(d)) as a combined result of missing tail rotor losses

cyclic; (c) main rotor collective; (d) tail rotor collective
and underpredicted main rotor torque, most noticeably at high speed. At moderate-
to high-speed ﬂight, the absence of tail rotor ﬂapping and the powerful interactions
with the aerodynamics of the rear fuselage and vertical ﬁn increase the modelling
discrepancies.
The power required, shown in Fig. 4.11 for the Bo105, has the characteristic
bucket proﬁle as a function of forward speed, reﬂecting the reduction in induced (rotor
drag) power and increase in parasite (fuselage drag) power as speed increases. At high

speed, nonlinear rotor aerodynamic terms have a signiﬁcant effect on collective pitch
and power required, leading to the gross errors with the simpliﬁed Level 1 modelling
as shown by the comparison with Bo105 ﬂight test data in Figs 4.10(c) and 4.11. For
moderate rates of climb and descent, the Level 1 theory predicts the basic trends in
power required and control angles fairly well. The rotor is particularly efﬁcient in
climbing ﬂight. While the power required to climb a ﬁxed-wing aircraft is approxi-
mately equal to the rate of change of potential energy, the increased mass ﬂow through
the rotor of a helicopter reduces the power required to half this value. For similar
reasons, the rotor is inefﬁcient in descent, the power reduction corresponding to only
half the rate of loss of potential energy. These simple results are explicable through the
momentum theory of Level 1 modelling. In steep descent, however, strongly nonlinear
aerodynamic effects dominate the trim (and stability and response) requirements. We
have already discussed the vortex-ring region in both Chapters 2 and 3 and highlighted
the inadequacy of simple momentum theory for predicting the power required and
response characteristics. On the other hand, for higher rates of descent, between vortex
ring and autorotation, the empirical modiﬁcations to momentum theory discussed in
Chapter 3 provide a reasonable interpolation between the helicopter and windmill so-
lutions to the momentum equations for rotor inﬂow. An analysis of trim requirements
in helicopter descending ﬂight is reported by Heyson in Ref. 4.3. At steep angles of
descent, and ﬂight speeds of about 1.5 times the hover induced velocity, the power
required to increase the rate of descent actually increases. Figure 4.12, taken from Ref.
4.3, illustrates the power required as a function of glide slope angle for several different
values of ﬂight speed along the glide slope. The reference velocity wh and power Ph
correspond to the hover values, otherwise the results are quite general. At steep angles
of descent (>60◦), the power required to increase the rate of descent at a constant speed
increases. Also shown, in Fig. 4.12(b), is a power contour for the rotor pitched up by
Fig. 4.12 Power required in descending ﬂight (from Ref. 4.3): (a) θ = 0◦; (b) θ = 15◦

15◦, showing the expanded region of increased power required as a function of ﬂight
path angle. Heyson refers to this, and the associated response characteristics, as power
settling, and comments on the operational signiﬁcance of this strong nonlinearity. To
quote from Heyson’s report,
A pilot ﬂying a steep approach generally ﬂies with reference to the ground either
visually or through the use of some avionic system. Although he can sense sidewinds
as a drift, his perception of a headwind or tailwind is poor. Even a light tail wind can
produce a major difference between the glideslope with respect to the surrounding air
mass and the geometric glideslope. If the ﬂight is stabilised near one of the minimum
power points, Fig. 12 shows many combinations of γ , θ, and VG/wh for which a
tailwind induced change of only 10◦or 15◦in γ increases the required shaft power
by 50 to 100% of the installed power. In the presence of such a major increase in
required power, the helicopter settles, thus increasing the glide slope and still further
increasing the required power.
With the above discussion on steep descent, we have strayed into the response domain,
showing the importance of predictable trim characteristics to the pilot’s ﬂying task. We
shall return to this aspect in Chapters 5 and 7.
Predictingthetrimcontrolanglesrequired,thepowerrequiredandthesteadyloads
on the various components forms a basis for calculating such static characteristics as the
controlmarginsattheﬂightenvelopeboundary,payloadandrangecapabilitiesandlimit
loads on the tail boom in sideslipping ﬂight. Achievement of accurate estimates (e.g., to
within a few per cent of the true values) of such parameters will almost certainly require
more detailed modelling than that described in the above analysis. The main rotor forces
are a more complex function of rotor motion and the aerodynamics can be strongly
nonlinear in high speed or at high thrust coefﬁcient. The fuselage and empennage
forces can be strongly inﬂuenced by the rotor wake and the tail rotor ﬂapping can tilt
the disc and thrust vector and change the power required. In some cases these will be
ﬁrst-order effects and cannot be ignored. Certainly, the component interactions will
tend to spoil the simple sequential nature of the algorithm described above, giving rise
to many more potential convergence problems and demanding more sophistication
in the iterative solution. For trend predictions, however, the simple theory can be
remarkably accurate; the characteristic shapes of the trim control curves is evidence
of this. Examination of the effects of small changes from some baseline conﬁguration
can also provide useful insight into the sensitivities to design conﬁguration or ﬂight
state parameters.
Trim solutions are generally unique, with a ﬁxed set of control positions deﬁning
each equilibrium condition. A natural question that arises out of the study of trim is what
happens if the aircraft is disturbed by a small amount from the trim? This could happen
with a small gust or nudge of the controls. Will the aircraft immediately settle into a
new trim, return to the original trim or depart away from the trim state in an unstable
fashion? These questions cannot be answered from analysis of the trim equations; they
require the full dynamic equations of motion from which the time evolution of the
ﬂight trajectory and fuselage attitudes can be determined. While a wide ﬂight envelope
simulator will usually require the full nonlinear equations, the answers to our questions
regarding the effects of small perturbations can generally be found through analysis of
the linearized equations using the concepts of the stability and control derivatives.

Stability Analysis
The concept of stability of motion in a dynamic system is a very intuitive one that
grasped the imagination of early pioneers of aviation. The supporting archetypal theory
for ﬂight stability was developed in the very early days of manned ﬂight (Refs 4.2 and
4.4). The concept that stability and control were unlikely partners, the latter gaining
fromshortcomingsintheformer,wasalsorecognizedinthesesameearlydays,suchthat
marginal stability, or even instability, was actually a useful property when considering
the required piloting effort. Since that time much has been written on stability and
control and much of the theoretical foundation for the stability of low-speed ﬁxed-
wing aircraft was already well developed by the time that early helicopters were in
serious development. The ﬁrst helicopters were unstable but the presence of mild
instabilities at low speed was probably something of a blessing because control power
was fairly marginal on these early craft. While ﬁxed-wing aircraft have developed
and can easily be conferred with high levels of natural stability and compatible levels
of control, basically helicopters are still naturally unstable and require some level of
artiﬁcial stabilization to ensure safe control in poor weather and when ﬂying under
instrument ﬂight rules (IFR). The degree of stability required in helicopters to ensure
safe operations is an important ﬂying quality consideration, and will be discussed in
some detail later in Chapter 6.
Understanding the ﬂight behaviour of helicopters, why they are so difﬁcult to
build with natural stability, and developing rational explanations for the many curious
dynamic characteristics, cannot be achieved simply through deriving the equations of
Chapter 3, or even by building a simulation model. These are necessary but insufﬁcient
activities. The development of a deep understanding of ﬂight behaviour comes from
the intellectual interplay between theory and practice, with an emphasis on handson
practice and analytical theory. Most of the understanding of stability and control has
come from relatively simple theoretical approximations that permit expression of cause
and effect in parametric form. Coincidentally, the publication of the earliest texts that
provided a deﬁnitive treatment of both ﬁxed- and rotary-wing stability and control
occurred in 1952 (Refs 4.2, 4.5). Both of these texts deal with fundamental concepts
in analytical terms that are still valid today. While our ability to model more and more
complex representations of the aerodynamics and dynamics of aircraft seems to extend
every year, our understanding of why things happen the way they do essentially comes
from simple theory melded with a good physical understanding.
With these words of introduction we embark on this section on stability (and con-
trol) with the guiding light in search of simple approximations to complex behaviour.
We shall draw heavily on the theory of linear dynamic systems but the underlying
vector–matrix theoretical methods, including a discussion on eigenanalysis, are con-
tained in Appendix 4A, to which the unfamiliar reader is referred. Features of the
classical description of aircraft stability are the concepts of static and dynamic stabil-
ity, the former relating to the immediate behaviour following a disturbance, the latter
to the longer term behaviour. These are useful but elementary concepts, particularly for
ﬁxed-wing aircraft, drawing parallels with stiffness and damping in a simple mechani-
cal analogue, but the distinction is blurred in the study of helicopter motion because of
the stronger couplings between longitudinal and lateral motions. The perspective we
shall take here is to draw the distinction between local and global stability – the former
relating to the stability of motion following small disturbances from a trim condition,

209
the latter relating to larger, potentially unbounded motion. Of course, unbounded mo-
tion is only a theoretical concept, and ultimately the issue is likely to be one of strength
rather than stability in this case. Analysis tools for large nonlinear motions of aircraft
are limited and tend either to be based on the assumption that the motion is nearly
linear (i.e., nonlinearities are weak), so that approximating describing functions can
be used, or to be applicable to very special forms of strong nonlinearity that can be
described analytically.
Nonlinear analysis of ﬁxed-wing aircraft has been stimulated by such phenomena
as stall (including deep stall), spinning, inertial coupling and wing rocking. The need
to understand the ﬂight dynamics in these situations has led to extensive research into
analytical methods that are able to predict the various kinds of departure, particularly
during the 1970s and 1980s (Ref. 4.6). Helicopter ﬂight dynamics also has its share of
essentially nonlinear phenomena including vortex-ring state, main rotor wake–tail rotor
interactions, rotor stall and rotor wake–empennage interactions. Much less constructive
analytic work has been done on these nonlinear problems, and many potentially fruitful
areas of research need attention. The methods developed for ﬁxed-wing analysis will
be equally applicable to helicopters and, just as the transfer of basic linear analysis
techniques gave the helicopter engineers considerable leverage in early days, so too will
the describing function and bifurcation techniques that have enabled so much insight
into the dynamics of ﬁxed-wing combat aircraft. Nonlinear problems are considerably
more difﬁcult than linear ones, one consolation being that they are usually considerably
more interesting too, but little has been published to date on nonlinear helicopter ﬂight
dynamics.
In this chapter we restrict the discussion to linear analysis. We shall consider
classical 6 DoF motion in detail. This level of approximation is generally good for
low-moderate frequency, handling qualities analysis. The assumption underlying the
6 DoF theory is that the higher order rotor and inﬂow dynamics are much faster than
the fuselage motions and have time to reach their steady state well within the typical
time constants of the whole aircraft response modes. This topic has been discussed in
the Tour of Chapter 2 and the conditions for validity are outlined in Appendix 4A.
4.3.1
Linearization
Consider the helicopter equations of motion described in nonlinear form, given by
˙x = F(x, u, t)
(4.35)
In 6 DoF form, the motion states and controls are
x = {u, w, q, θ, v, p, φ,r, ψ}
where u, v and w are the translational velocities along the three orthogonal directions
of the fuselage ﬁxed axes system described in Appendix 3A; p, q and r are the angular
velocities about the x-, y- and z-axes and θ, φ and ψ are the Euler angles, deﬁning the
orientation of the body axes relative to the earth.
The control vector has four components: main rotor collective, longitudinal cyclic,
lateral cyclic and tail rotor collective
u = {θ0, θ1s, θ1c, θ0T }

The expanded form of eqn 4.35 can be written as eqn 4.36 combined with the Euler
angles, eqn 4.37 (inverse of eqn 3A.42), as derived in Chapter 3 and Appendix 3A.

Izz ˙r = (Ixx −Iyy)pq + Ixz( ˙p −qr) + N
(4.36)
˙φ = p + q sin φ tan θ + r cos φ tan θ
˙θ = q cos φ −r sin φ
˙ψ = q sin φ sec θ + r cos φ sec θ
(4.37)
Using small perturbation theory, we assume that during disturbed motion, the helicopter
behaviour can be described as a perturbation from the trim, written in the form
x = xe + δx
(4.38)
A fundamental assumption of linearization is that the external forces X, Y and Z and
moments L, M and N can be represented as analytic functions of the disturbed motion
variables and their derivatives. Taylor’s theorem for analytic functions then implies that
if the force and moment functions (i.e., the aerodynamic loadings) and all its derivatives
are known at any one point (the trim condition), then the behaviour of that function
anywhere in its analytic range can be estimated from an expansion of the function in a
series about the known point. The requirement that the aerodynamic and dynamic loads
be analytic functions of the motion and control variables is generally valid, but features
such as hysteresis and sharp discontinuities are examples of non-analytic behaviour
where the process will break down. Linearization amounts to neglecting all except the
linear terms in the expansion. The validity of linearization depends on the behaviour
of the forces at small amplitude, i.e., as the motion and control disturbances become
very small, the dominant effect should be a linear one. The forces can then be written
in the approximate form
X = Xe + ∂X
∂u δu + ∂X
∂w δw + · · · + ∂X
∂θ0
δθ0 + · · · , etc.
(4.39)
All six forces and moments can be expanded in this manner. The linear approximation
also contains terms in the rates of change of motion and control variables with time, but
we shall neglect these initially. The partial nature of the derivatives indicates that they
are obtained with all the other DoFs held ﬁxed – this is simply another manifestation of
the linearity assumption. For further analysis we shall drop the perturbation notation,

 
Trim and Stability Analysis
211
hence referring to the perturbed variables by their regular characters u, v, w, etc., and
write the derivatives in the form, e.g.,
∂X
∂u = Xu,
∂L
∂θ1c
= Lθ1c,
etc.
(4.40)
The linearized equations of motion for the full 6 DoFs, describing perturbed motion
about a general trim condition, can then be written as
˙x −Ax = Bu(t) + f(t)
(4.41)
where the additional function f(t) has been included to represent atmospheric and other
disturbances. Following from eqn 4.40, the so-called system and control matrices are
derived from the partial derivatives of the nonlinear function F, i.e.,
A =
∂F
∂x

x=xe
(4.42)
and
B =
∂F
∂u

x=xe
(4.43)
In fully expanded form, the system and control matrices can be written as shown in
eqns 4.44 and 4.45 on page 212. In eqn 4.44 the heading angle ψ has been omitted,
the direction of ﬂight in the horizontal plane having no effect on the aerodynamic or
dynamic forces and moments. The derivatives are written in semi-normalized form,
i.e.,
Xu ≡Xu

Trim and Stability Analysis

In addition to the linearized aerodynamic forces and moment, eqn 4.44 also contains
perturbational inertial, gravitational and kinematic effects linearized about the trim
condition deﬁned by
e, e, Ue, Ve, We, Pe, Qe, Re
The trim angular velocities are given in terms of the aircraft turn rate in eqns 4.29–4.31.
Equation 4.41 is the fundamental linearized form for describing the stability and
response of small motion about a trim condition. The coefﬁcients in the A and B
matrices represent the slope of the forces and moments at the trim point reﬂecting the
strict deﬁnition of the stability and control derivatives. Analytic differentiation of the
force and moment expressions is required to deliver the exact values of the derivatives.
In practice, two other methods for derivative calculation are more commonly used,
leading to equivalent linearizations for ﬁnite amplitude motion. The ﬁrst method is
simply the numerical differencing equivalent to analytic differentiation. The forces
and moments are perturbed by each of the states in turn, either one-sided or two-sided,
as illustrated conceptually in Fig. 4.13; the effect of increasing the perturbation size is
illustrated in the hypothetical case shown in Fig. 4.13(b), where the strong nonlinearity
gives rise to a signiﬁcant difference with the small perturbation case in Fig. 4.13(a). The
numerical derivatives will converge to the analytic, true, values as the perturbation size
reduces to zero. If there is any signiﬁcant nonlinearity at small amplitude, then the slope
at the trim may not give the best ‘ﬁt’ to the force over the amplitude range of interest.
Often, larger perturbation values are used to ensure the best overall linearization over
the range of motion amplitude of interest in a particular application, e.g., order 1 m/s
for velocities and 0.1 rad for controls, attitudes and rates. In each case it is important
to estimate the degree of nonlinearity over the range of interest, as the derivative value
used can have a signiﬁcant effect on stability and response characteristics.
Before we examine the derivatives themselves in more detail we should refer to
the second ‘numerical’ method for deriving derivative estimates. This involves a ﬁtting
or model-matching process whereby a linear model structure is used to ﬁt the response
of the nonlinear simulation model. This method can also be applied to ﬂight data and is
described under the general heading – system identiﬁcation. We discussed the approach
brieﬂy in Chapter 2 and we shall give more attention to applications in Chapter 5.
The system identiﬁcation approach seeks to ﬁnd the best overall model ﬁt and, as
such, will embody the effects of any nonlinearities and couplings into the equivalent
Fig. 4.13 Derivative calculation by backward–forward differencing: (a) small perturbation;
(b) large perturbation

 
214
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
derivative estimates. The states are no longer perturbed independently; instead, the
nonlinear model, or test aircraft, is excited by the controls so that the aircraft responds
in some ‘optimal’ manner that leads to the maximum identiﬁability of the derivatives.
The derivatives are varied as a group until the best ﬁt is obtained. How these estimates
relate to the pure analytic and numerical equivalents will depend on a number of factors,
including the degree of nonlinearity, the correlation between states in the response and
the extent of the measurement noise on the test data. In this chapter we shall discuss
only the analytic and numeric methods of derivative estimation, returning brieﬂy to the
global system identiﬁcation approach in the applications in Chapter 5.
4.3.2
The derivatives
There are 36 stability derivatives and 24 control derivatives in the standard 6 DoF set.
In this section we shall discuss a limited number of the more important derivatives
and their variation with conﬁguration and ﬂight condition parameters. The complete
set of numerical derivatives for all three reference aircraft are contained as charts in
the Appendix, Section 4B.2, and the reader may ﬁnd it useful to refer to these as the
discussion unfolds. It should be noted that the derivatives plotted in Appendix 4B
include the inertial and gravitational effects from eqn 4.44. For example, the elements
Zq and Yr tend to be dominated by the forward velocity term Ue. Each derivative is
made up of a contribution from the different aircraft components – the main rotor,
fuselage, etc. In view of the dominant nature of the rotor in helicopter ﬂight dynamics,
we shall give particular, but certainly not exclusive, attention to main rotor derivatives
in the following discussion. The three most signiﬁcant rotor disc variables are the rotor
thrust T and the two multi-blade coordinate disc tilts β1c and β1s. During disturbed
motion these rotor states will vary according to the algebraic relationships derived
in Chapter 3 (eqns 3.90, 3.65). Considering the simple approximation that the rotor
thrust is normal to the disc, for small ﬂapping angles, the rotor X and Y forces take
the form
XR = Tβ1c,
YR = −Tβ1s
(4.52)
The derivatives with respect to any motion or control variable can then be written as,
for example,
∂XR
∂u
= ∂T
∂u β1c + T ∂β1c
∂u
(4.53)
Rotor force and moment derivatives are therefore closely related to individual thrust
and ﬂapping derivatives. Many of the derivatives are strongly nonlinear functions
of velocity, particularly the velocity derivatives themselves. The derivatives are also
nonlinear functions of the changes in downwash during perturbed motion, and can be
written as a linear combination of the individual effects, as in the thrust coefﬁcient

The rotor force, moment and ﬂapping equations as derived in Chapter 3 are expressed
in terms of the advance ratio in hub/wind axes. The relationships between the velocity
components at the aircraft centre of mass and the rotor in-plane and out-of-plane
velocities are given in Chapter 3, Section 3A.4. It is not the intention here to derive
general analytic expressions for the derivatives; hence, we shall not be concerned with
the full details of the transformation from rotor to fuselage axes except where this is
important for enhancing our understanding.
The translational velocity derivatives
Velocity perturbations give rise to rotor ﬂapping, changes in rotor lift and drag and the
incidence and sideslip angles of the ﬂow around the fuselage and empennage. Although
we can see from the equations in the 3.70 series of Chapter 3 that the ﬂapping appears
to be a strongly nonlinear function of forward velocity, the longitudinal cyclic required
to trim, as shown in Fig. 4.10(a), is actually fairly linear up to moderate forward speeds.
This gives evidence that the moment required to trim the ﬂapping at various speeds
is fairly constant and hence the primary longitudinal ﬂapping derivative with forward
speed is also relatively constant. The orientation between the fuselage axes and rotor
hub/wind axes depends on the shaft tilt, rotor ﬂapping and sideslip angle; hence a u
velocity perturbation in the fuselage system, say, will transform to give µx, µy and µz
disturbances in the rotor axes. This complicates interpretation. For example, the rotor
force response to µz perturbations is much stronger than the response to the in-plane
velocities, and the resolution of this force through only small angles can be the same
order of magnitude as the in-plane loads. This is demonstrated in the derivatives Xu
and Zu at low speed where the initial tendency is to vary in the opposite direction to
the general trend in forward ﬂight.
The derivatives Xu, Yv, Xv and Yu (Mv and Lu)
The four derivatives Xu, Yv, Xv and Yu are closely associated with each other at low
speed. They are shown as a function of speed for the Lynx in straight and level ﬂight
in Fig. 4.14. In high-speed ﬂight the coupling derivatives are fairly insigniﬁcant and
the direct force dampings Xu and Yv are practically linear with speed and reﬂect the
drag and sideforce on the rotor–fuselage combination respectively. At hover and at
low speed, all four derivatives are the same order of magnitude. The direct derivatives
are principally due to the disc tilts to aft and port following perturbations in u and v

 
216
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 4.14 Variation of force/velocity derivatives with forward speed
(see eqn 4.53). The coupling derivatives are less obvious, and we have to look into
the theory of non-uniform inﬂow, described in Chapter 3, for an explanation to the
surprisingly large values of Xv and Yu extending to about 40 knots forward ﬂight. At
the hover condition, a perturbation in forward velocity u leads to a strong variation in
wake angle χ (eqn 3.145) and hence non-uniform inﬂow λ1c. An approximation to the
increase in inﬂow at the rear of the disc can be derived from eqn 3.144:
∂λ1c
∂µ ≈1
2
(4.58)
For every 1 m/s increase in forward velocity, the downwash increases by 0.5 m/s
at the rear of the disc. The linear variation of inﬂow along the blade radius results
in a uniform incidence change; hence the effect is identical to cyclic pitch in the
hover. The direct rotor response to a longitudinal incidence distribution is therefore a
lateral disc tilt β1s. The derivative of lateral ﬂapping with inﬂow can be derived from
eqn 3.71, as

(4.59)
where the Stiffness number is given in terms of the ﬂap frequency ratio and Lock
number.
The Stiffness number ranges up to values of about 0.3 for current helicopters;
hence the lateral ﬂapping derivative in eqn 4.58 is close to unity and a perturbation of
1 m/s in forward velocity leads to about 0.2◦–0.3◦lateral disc tilt to starboard, de-
pending on the rotorspeed. Similar arguments can be made to explain the low speed
variation of Xv and the same effect will be reﬂected in the moment derivatives Mv and
Lu. These variations in non-uniform inﬂow can be expected to impact the coupling of
lateral and longitudinal motions at low speed. We shall return to this topic later when
discussing the natural modes of motion.

217
Fig. 4.15 Variation of longitudinal static stability derivatives with forward speed
The derivatives Mu and Mw
The derivatives Mu and Mw, the so-called speed and incidence static stability
derivatives, have a major effect on longitudinal stability and hence handling qualities.
For ﬁxed-wing aircraft ﬂying at low subsonic speeds, the speed stability derivative is
practically zero – all the aerodynamic moments are proportional to dynamic pressure
and the derivative works out to be proportional to the trim value of aerodynamic
pitching moment, i.e., zero. With a helicopter, the main rotor moments due to speed
changes are roughly constant across the speed range, but the aerodynamic loads on
the fuselage and empennage are strong functions of forward velocity. In particular, the
normal load on the horizontal stabilizer gives a strong pitching moment at the centre of
mass and this component provides a contribution to Mu proportional to the trim load
on the tail. Figure 4.15 compares the variation of the two static stability derivatives
with speed for Lynx and Puma. The fourfold increase in magnitude of Mu for the Lynx
relative to the Puma is a result of the much higher rotor moments generated by the
hingeless rotor for the same velocity perturbation. Both aircraft exhibit static speed
stability; an increase in forward speed causes the disc to ﬂap back, together with an
increase in the download on the tailplane, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment and a
tendency to reduce speed. This positive (apparent) speed stability is important for good
handling qualities in forward ﬂight (see Chapter 6), but can degrade dynamic stability
in both hover and forward ﬂight (see the later section on stability of the natural modes).
Comparing the incidence stability derivative Mw for the two aircraft, we can see
similar orders of magnitude, but the Lynx exhibits instability while the Puma is stable.
This derivative was discussed at some length in Chapter 2 (see Figs 2.25 and 2.26). In
forward ﬂight, a positive perturbation in normal velocity, w, causes a greater increase
in lift on the advancing than on the retreating side of the disc. The disc ﬂaps back giving
rise to a positive, nose-up, destabilizing, pitching moment. This effect does not change
in character between an articulated rotor (Puma) and a hingeless rotor (Lynx), but the
magnitude is scaled by the hub stiffness. The pitching moments arise from three major
sources – the main rotor, the tailplane and the fuselage (Fig. 4.16), written as shown in
eqn 4.60.
M = MR + Mtp + M f
(4.60)

 
218
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 4.16 Sketch showing pitching moments at the aircraft centre of mass

moment proportional to the disc tilt and one proportional to the rotor thrust, i.e.,
M ≈−
 Nb
2 Kβ + hRT

β1c −(xcg + hRγs)T + (ltp + xcg)Ztp + Mf
(4.61)
The pitching moments from the rotor, tailplane and fuselage are shown in Fig. 4.16.
The contribution of the tail to Mw is always stabilizing – with a positive incidence
change, the tail lift increases (Ztp reduces) resulting in a nose-down pitch moment.
The importance of the horizontal tail to the derivative Mw and helicopter pitch
stability is outlined in Ref. 4.7, where the sizing of the tail for the YUH-61A is
discussed. The contribution from the fuselage is nearly always destabilizing; typically
the aerodynamic centre of the fuselage is forward of the centre of mass. The overall
contribution from the main rotor depends on the balance between the ﬁrst two terms
in eqn 4.61. We have already stated that the disc always ﬂaps back with a positive
(upward) perturbation in w, but the thrust also increases; hence the second term, due to
the offset of the thrust from the centre of mass, is actually stabilizing for conﬁgurations
with forward centre of mass and shaft tilt. This is the major effect for ﬁxed-wing
aircraft, where the distance between the centre of mass and the aerodynamic centre
of the whole aircraft is referred to as the static margin. For small offset articulated
rotors, with a centre of mass well forward of the shaft, the thrust offset effect can
be as large as the hub moment term in eqn 4.61, resulting in a fairly small overall
rotor moment. This is the case for the Puma, with our baseline conﬁguration having
a forward centre of mass location; also, the ﬂap hinge offset is only 3.8% of the
rotor radius. For hingeless rotors with aft centre of mass, both thrust offset and hub
moment effects are destabilizing, with the hub moment due to ﬂapping dominating.
All three contributions to the incidence stability vary approximately linearly with
speed above about 40 knots. Figure 4.17 illustrates the contributions from the different
components to Mw at the 120-knot high-speed condition. The overall magnitude of all
three components is greater for the Lynx, reﬂecting the much smaller pitch moment
of inertia (which normalizes the derivative) for that aircraft compared with the Puma.

Fig. 4.17 Contributions to the static stability derivative Mw at 120 knots for Lynx and Puma
The derivatives M ˙w, Mv and M˙v
Before leaving the pitching moment derivatives with speed, it should be noted that the
incidence at the empennage is a combination of the fuselage incidence and the effect
of the rotor downwash at the tail. This effect will normally be taken into account when
perturbing the forces and moments with the w perturbation; the rotor thrust and the
downwash will change, resulting in an incidence perturbation at the tail. The magnitude
of the downwash at the tail depends on the distance between the tail and rotor. Let α f
be the fuselage incidence, µ the advance ratio and λtp the downwash at the tail. We
can write the incidence at the tail in the form
αtp = αf −λtp
µ
(4.62)
The downwash at the tail at time t was generated at the rotor disc at time t −ℓtp/Ue
earlier. If we assume that this time increment is small compared with the response time,
we can write

Thus, we ﬁnd the appearance of acceleration derivatives like M ˙w in the longitudinal

thrust coefﬁcient and uniform inﬂow equations. The presence of non-uniform inﬂow
and wake contraction complicates the overall effect, reducing the validity of the above
simple approximation. Nevertheless, the physical mechanism is very similar to that
found on ﬁxed-wing aircraft where the downwash lag at the tail, attributed entirely
to incidence changes on the main wing, leads to an effective acceleration derivative.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Any lateral variation in rotor downwash at the tail will also lead to changes in pitching
moments during yaw manoeuvres. This effect is discussed in Refs 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10
where relatively simple ﬂat wake models are shown to be effective in modelling the
pitching moment due to sideslip (see Chapter 3), leading to the derivatives Mv and M˙v,
in a similar fashion to the effect from w perturbations.
The derivative Zw
The heave damping derivative Zw has already been discussed in some depth in the
Introductory Tour to this book (Chapter 2) and earlier on in the present chapter. While
the fuselage and empennage will undoubtedly contribute in high-speed ﬂight, the main
rotor tends to dominate Zw throughout the ﬂight envelope and can be approximated
by the thrust coefﬁcient derivative in eqn 4.65

Good approximations for heave damping in hover and forward ﬂight (µ > 0.15) can
be obtained and are summarized in Table 4.2.
It can be seen that rotor blade loading, deﬁned as the aircraft mass divided by the
blade area (Ma/Ab), is a very important parameter deﬁning the heave damping at hover

Fig. 4.18 Comparison of Zw approximate and ‘exact’ results for Lynx
and in forward ﬂight. The derivative Zw represents the initial acceleration following an
abrupt vertical gust and is inversely proportional to blade loading (see Chapter 2, eqn
2.63). The much higher typical blade loadings on rotorcraft, compared with ﬁxed-wing
aircraft of similar weight, partly account for the smaller values of Zw, and hence lower
gust sensitivity, for helicopters in forward ﬂight. A second major factor is disguised
in the variation of the heave damping with speed. The forward ﬂight approximation in
Table 4.2 is shown plotted against the Lynx value from the Helisim simulation model
in Fig. 4.18; the 10% difference at the higher values of advance ratio is attributed
to the fuselage and tail. The variation is seen to level off at higher speeds, while the
gust sensitivity of ﬁxed-wing aircraft continues to increase linearly with speed (see
Fig. 2.28). As discussed in Chapter 2, the reason for the asymptotic behaviour of the
helicopter damping stems from the increased harmonic distribution of the airloads as
the speed increases. The thrust coefﬁcient can be written as

and the in-plane and normal velocity components can be approximated by the
expressions
U T ≈r + µ sin ψ,
Up = µz −λi −µβ cos ψ −rβ′
(4.70)
The harmonic components of thrust in the expanded form of eqn 4.69 therefore deﬁne
the level of quasi-steady and vibratory loads that reach the fuselage. Perturbations in w
show up in the second term in parenthesis in eqn 4.69. The component that increases
linearly with forward speed is also a one-per-rev loading. Hence, while the zero-per-
rev or quasi-steady term levels off at higher speeds, the vibratory response to a gust at
Nb-per-rev, where Nb is the number of blades, continues to increase. While these loads
do not result in signiﬁcant ﬂight path or attitude changes, and therefore are unlikely to
cause handling problems, they do affect the overall ride quality. Further discussion on
the general topic of ride quality is contained in Chapter 5.

The derivatives Lv, Nv
The remaining velocity derivatives belong to the lateral/directional DoFs and the most
signiﬁcant are the sideslip derivatives – the dihedral effect Lv and the weathercock
stability Nv. The magnitude of these two moments as sideslip increases determines the
lateral/directional static stability characteristics. A positive value of Nv is stabilizing,
while a negative value of Lv is stabilizing. Both have the same kind of effects on rotary-
wingasonﬁxed-wingaircraftbutwithrotary-wingaircraftthenewcomponentisthetail
rotor which can contribute strongly to both. The magnitude of the tail rotor contribution
to the dihedral effect depends on the height of the tail rotor above the aircraft centre
of mass. The fuselage can also contribute to Lv if the aerodynamic centre is offset
vertically from the centre of mass, as in the case of deep fuselage hulls, which typically
leadstoanegative Lv component.Butonceagain,themainrotorisusuallythedominant
effect,especiallyforhelicopterswithhingelessrotors,whereallthemainrotormoments
are magniﬁed roughly proportionally with the rotor stiffness. In hover, the derivative
Lv is generated by similar aerodynamics to those of the pitch derivative Mu, and as
forward ﬂight increases some of the basic similarities remain. As the blades are exposed
to the velocity perturbation, the advancing blade experiences an increase in lift, the
retreating blade a decrease, and the one-per-rev ﬂapping response occurs approximately
90◦around the azimuth, giving a rolling moment to port (starboard for clockwise rotors)
for a lateral velocity perturbation and a pitch-up moment in response to a longitudinal
velocity perturbation. The extent of the ﬂap response depends on the rotor stiffness, the
Lock number and also the trim lift on the rotor blades. To examine the ﬂap derivatives
we can refer back to eqns 3.70, 3.71 and 3.72 from Chapter 3. At hover, we can write

(4.72)
The dihedral effect can therefore potentially change sign for teetering rotors at low and
negative rotor thrust conditions that are outside the operational ﬂight envelope for such
aircraft, because of such reversals of ﬂap response and the associated hub moments.
The directional stability derivative Nv is critically important for both static and
dynamic stability of helicopters. The main contributors are the tail rotor, the vertical
ﬁn and the fuselage. The latter is usually destabilizing with the fuselage centre of
pressure behind the centre of mass; both the tail rotor and vertical ﬁn are stabilizing
(i.e., positive). All are approximately linear with speed up to moderate forward speeds.
However, the contribution from the tail rotor is similar to the heave damping on the
main rotor, arising from a change in tail rotor thrust due to a change in velocity normal
to the disc, and levels off at high speed; the contributions from the ﬁn and fuselage
continue to increase in the positive and negative senses respectively. The weathercock

stability is strongly inﬂuenced by the tail rotor δ3 angle (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2)
which reduces blade pitch as a function of blade ﬂapping. On the four-bladed Lynx tail
rotor, changes in tail rotor thrust lead to changes in rotor coning and hence changes
in tail rotor collective. Figure 4.19 illustrates the comparison of Nv for the Lynx, with
and without δ3, showing that δ3 produces a reduction of about 40% at high speed.
For the Lynx, the low-speed values of Nv tend to be dominated by the inertia
coupling with roll (and hence the much stronger dihedral effect Lv) through the product
of inertia Ixz (see eqn 4.48). The reduced effectiveness of the tail rotor to directional
stability makes the contribution of the vertical ﬁn all the more important. For helicopters
withhighsettailrotors,theseverticalsurfacesalsocarrythetailrotordriveshaftandcan
have high ratios of thickness to chord. Aerofoil sections having this property can exhibit
a ﬂattening or even reversal of the lift curve slope at small incidence values (Ref. 4.11).
In such cases it can be expected that the yawing moment due to sideslip will exhibit a
strong nonlinearity with sideslip velocity. The Puma features this characteristic and the
associated effects on stability have been discussed in Ref. 4.12; the ﬁn aerodynamics
are summarized in the Appendix, Section 4B.1. Figure 4.20 shows how the value of
Fig. 4.20 Variation of derivative Nv with ‘v’ velocity perturbation for Puma

 
224
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Nv for the Puma varies with the magnitude of the velocity perturbation at a trim speed
of 120 knots. At small amplitude, up to about 5 m/s perturbation (corresponding to
about 5◦of sideslip), the ﬁn contributes nothing to the weathercock stability. As the
perturbation is increased up to 30 m/s (corresponding to nearly 30◦of sideslip) there
is a tenfold increase in Nv. The effects of this nonlinearity on stability and response
will be discussed later, but are obviously signiﬁcant and need to be taken into account
in the linearization process.
The derivatives Nu, Nw, Lu, Lw
These four derivatives play an important role in coupling the low-frequency longitudi-
nal and lateral motions of the helicopter. The yawing moment derivatives stem largely
from the changes in main rotor torque with velocity perturbations, although there is
also an effect from the ﬁn (Nu), similar to the contribution of the horizontal stabilizer
to Mu. The Nw effect can be quite signiﬁcant since torque changes to vertical velocity
are similar to the direct control coupling–torque changes from collective inputs. The
Lu effect reﬂects the changes in lateral cyclic to trim with forward speed, being domi-
nated by the main rotor effect at low speed. Forward velocity perturbations increase the
incidence on the forward part of the (coned) disc and reduce the incidence at the rear.
The disc will therefore tilt to starboard for anticlockwise rotors (port for clockwise
rotors). As forward speed increases, the four derivatives show similar trends and the
dominating main rotor components are closely related through the shaft tilt and product
of inertia.
The angular velocity derivatives
Our discussion on derivatives with respect to roll, pitch and yaw rate covers three
distinct groups – the force derivatives, the roll/pitch moment derivatives due to roll and
pitch and the roll/yaw derivatives due to yaw and pitch. Derivatives in the ﬁrst group
largely share their positions in the system matrix (eqn 4.44) with the trim inertial
velocity components. In some cases the inertial velocities are so dominant that the
aerodynamic effects are negligible (e.g., Zq, Yr). In other cases the aerodynamic effects
are important to primary response characteristics. Two such examples are Xq and Yp.
The derivatives Xq, Yp
These derivatives are dominated by the main rotor contributions. For teetering rotors
and low ﬂap hinge-offset rotors, the changes in rotor hub X and Y forces are the primary
contribution to the pitch and roll moments about the aircraft centre of mass. Hence the
derivatives Xq and Yp can contribute signiﬁcantly to aircraft pitch and roll damping.
The basic physical effects for the two derivatives are the same and can be understood
from an analysis of a teetering rotor in hovering ﬂight. If we assume that the thrust acts
normal to the disc in manoeuvres, and ignoring the small drag forces, then the rotor X
force can be written as the tilt of the thrust vector:
X = Tβ1c
(4.73)
The pitch rate derivative is then simply related to the derivative of ﬂapping with respect
to pitch rate. As the aircraft pitches, the rotor disc lags behind the shaft by an amount
proportional to the pitch rate. This effect was modelled in Chapter 3 and the relation-
ships were set down in eqns 3.71 and 3.72. For a centrally hinged rotor with zero spring

stiffness, the disc lags behind the shaft by an amount given by the expression
∂β1c
∂q
= 16
γ 
(4.74)
The Lock number γ is the ratio of aerodynamic to inertia forces acting on the rotor
blade; hence the disc will ﬂap more with heavy blades of low aspect ratio. Equation
4.74 implies that the force during pitching produces a pitch damping moment about
the centre of mass that opposes the pitch rate. However, the assumption that the thrust
remains normal to the disc has ignored the effect of the in-plane lift forces due to the
inclination of the lift vectors on individual blade sections. To examine this effect in
more detail we need to recall the expressions for the rotor hub forces from Chapter
3, eqns 3.88–3.99. Considering longitudinal motion only, thus dropping the hub/wind
dressings, the normalized X rotor force can be written as

This effect accounts for only half of the approximation given by eqn 4.73. Additional

and has been described as the ‘Amer effect’ (Ref. 4.13). Further discussion can be found
in Bramwell (Ref. 4.14) and in the early paper by Sissingh (Ref. 4.15). Although our
analysis has been conﬁned to hover, the approximation in eqn 4.79 is reasonably good
up to moderate forward speeds. The effect is most pronounced in conditions of high
collective pitch setting and low thrust, e.g., high-power climb, where the rotor damping
can reduce by as much as 50%. In autorotation, the Amer effect almost disappears.
The derivatives Mq, L p, Mp, Lq
The direct and coupled damping derivatives are collectively one of the most important
groupings in the system matrix. Primary damping derivatives reﬂect short-term, small
and moderate amplitude, handling characteristics, while the cross-dampings play a
dominant role in the level of pitch–roll and roll–pitch couplings. They are the most
potent derivatives in handling qualities terms, yet because of their close association
with short-term rotor stability and response, they can also be unreliable as handling
parameters. We shall discuss this issue later in Chapter 5 and in more detail in Chapter
7, but ﬁrst we need to explore the many physical mechanisms that make up these
derivatives. There has already been some discussion on the roll damping derivative in
Chapter 2, when some of the fundamental concepts of rotor dynamics were introduced.
The reader is referred back to the Tour (Section 2.3) for a refresher.
Taking the pitch moment as our example for the following elucidation, we write
the rotor moment about the centre of mass in the approximate form
MR = −

Nb
Kβ
2 + ThR

β1c
(4.81)
where Kβ is the ﬂapping stiffness, T the rotor thrust and hR the rotor vertical displace-
ment from the centre of mass. In this simple analysis we have ignored the moment due
to the in-plane rotor loads, but we shall discuss the effects of these later in this section.
The rotor moment therefore has two components – one due to the moment of the thrust
vector tilt from the centre of mass, the other from the hub moment arising from real or
effective rotor stiffness. Effective stiffness arises from any ﬂap hinge offset, where the
hub moment is generated by the offset of the blade lift shear force at the ﬂap hinge.
According to eqn 4.81, the rotor moment is proportional to, and hence in phase with,
the rotor disc tilt (for the centre-spring rotor). The relative contributions of the two
components depend on the rotor stiffness. The hub pitch moment can be expanded in
the form (see eqns 3.104, 3.105)

The hub moment derivatives can therefore be derived directly from the ﬂapping deriva-
tives. Since the quasi-steady assumption indicates that the disc tilt reaches its steady-
state value before the fuselage begins to move, the ﬂap derivatives can be obtained
from the matrix in eqn 3.72; thus, in hover, where the ﬂap effects are symmetrical,

The Stiffness number Sβ is given by eqn 4.59.
The variation of the ﬂap damping derivatives in eqns 4.84 and 4.85 with the
fundamental stiffness and Lock parameters has been discussed in Chapter 2 (see Figs
2.21 (b) and (c)). For values of Stiffness number up to about 0.4, corresponding to
the practical limits employed in most current helicopters, the direct ﬂap derivative is
fairly constant, so that helicopters with hingeless rotors ﬂap in very much the same
way as helicopters with teetering rotors. The Lock number has a much more dramatic
effect on the direct ﬂap motion. Looking at the coupling derivatives, we can see a linear
variation over the same range of Stiffness number, with rotors having low Lock number
experiencing a reversal of sign. This effect is manifested in the Bo105 helicopter, as
illustrated in the derivative charts of the Appendix, Section 4B.2, where the Lock
number of 5 and Stiffness number of about 0.4 result in a practical cancelling of the
rolling moment due to pitch rate Lq. The rotor Lock number is critically important to
the degree of pitch–roll coupling.
From the theory of ﬂap dynamics derived in Chapter 3, we can explain the pres-
ence of the two terms in the ﬂap derivatives. The primary mechanism for ﬂap and
rotor damping derives from the second term in parenthesis in eqn 4.84 and is caused
by the aerodynamic moment generated by the ﬂapping rate (at azimuth positions 90◦
and 270◦) that occurs when the rotor is pitching. The disc precesses as a result of the
aerodynamic action at these azimuth stations, and lags behind the rotor shaft by the
angle (16/γ ) × pitch rate. The primary mechanism for coupling is the change in
one-per-rev aerodynamic lift generated when the rotor pitches or rolls (second term
in eqn 4.85), adding an effective cyclic pitch. Both effects are relatively insensitive to
changes in rotor stiffness. The additional terms in Sβ in eqns 4.84 and 4.85 arise from
the fact that the ﬂap response is less than 90◦out of phase with the applied aerody-
namic load. The direct aerodynamic effects, giving rise to the longitudinal and lateral
ﬂapping, therefore couple into the lateral and longitudinal ﬂapping respectively. The
effect on the coupling is especially strong since the direct ﬂap derivative provides a
component in the coupling sense through the sign of the phase angle between aerody-
namic load and ﬂap response.
Combining the ﬂap derivatives with the hub moments in eqns 4.82 and 4.83, we
can derive approximate expressions for the rotor hub moment derivatives, in seminor-
malized form, for small values of Sβ:

The hub moment derivatives are therefore scaled by the Stiffness number, but otherwise
follow the same behaviour as the ﬂap derivatives. They also increase with blade number
and rotorspeed. It is interesting to compare the magnitude of the hub moment with the
thrust tilt contribution to the rotor derivatives. For the Lynx, the hub moment represents
about 80% of the total pitch and roll damping. For the Puma, the fraction is nearer 30%
and the overall magnitude is about 25% of that for the Lynx. Such is the powerful
effect of rotor ﬂap stiffness on all the hub moment derivatives reﬂected in the values
of Sβ for the Lynx and Puma of 0.22 and 0.044 respectively. As can be seen from the
derivative charts in the Appendix, Section 4B.2, except for the pitch damping, most
oftheratederivativesdiscussedabovearefairlyconstantoverthespeedrange,reﬂecting
the insensitivity with forward speed of rotor response to equivalent cyclic pitch change.
The pitch damping derivative Mq also has a signiﬁcant stabilizing contribution from
the horizontal tailplane, amounting to about 40% of the total at high speed.
Before leaving the roll and pitch moment derivatives, it is important that we
consider the inﬂuence of the in-plane rotor loads on the moments transmitted to the
fuselage. In our previous discussion of the force derivatives Xq and Yp, we have
seen how the ‘Amer effect’ reduces the effective rotor damping, most signiﬁcantly on
teetering rotors in low-thrust ﬂight conditions. An additional effect stems from the
orientation of the in-plane loads relative to the shaft when the rotor disc is tilted with
one-per-rev ﬂapping. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 4.21, showing the component of
rotor torque oriented as a pitching moment with lateral ﬂapping (the same effect gives
a rolling moment with longitudinal ﬂapping). The incremental hub moments can be
written in terms of the product of the steady torque component and the disc tilt; hence,
for four-bladed rotors

These moments will then combine with the thrust vector tilt and hub moment to give the
total rotor moment. To examine the contribution of all three effects to the derivatives,
we compare the breakdown for the Puma and Lynx. The Helisim predicted hover torque
for the Puma and Lynx work out at about 31 000 N m and 18 000 N m respectively.
The corresponding rotor thrusts are 57 000 N and 42 000 N and the effective spring
stiffnesses 48 000 N m/rad and 166 000 N m/rad. The resultant derivative breakdown
can then be written in the form

The effect of the torque moment on the direct damping derivative is therefore negligible.
In the case of the coupling derivative, the effect appears to be of concern only for
articulated rotors, and then only for rotors with very light blades (see the low Lock
number cases in Figs 2.21(b) and (c)).
The derivatives Nr, Lr, Np
The ﬁnal set of rate derivatives have little in common in terms of their physical makeup
but share, along with their ‘big brother’ L p, the property of having a primary inﬂu-
ence on the character of the lateral/directional stability and control characteristics of
the helicopter. We begin with a discussion of the yaw damping derivative Nr. In our
previous discussion of the force derivatives, we rather dismissed the sideforce due
to yaw rate Yr, since the inertial effect due to forward speed (Uer) was so domi-
nating. The aerodynamic contribution to Yr, however, is directly linked to the yaw
damping and is dominated by the loads on the tail rotor and vertical ﬁn. Assuming
that these components are at approximately the same location, we can write the yaw
damping as
Nr ≈−ℓt
Ma
Izz
Yr
(4.94)
In the hover, our theory predicts that Nr is almost entirely due to the tail rotor, with
a numerical value of between −0.25 and −0.4, depending on the tail rotor design
parameters, akin to the effect of main rotor design parameters on Zw (see Table 4.2).
The low value of yaw damping is reduced even further (by about 30%) by the effect
of the mechanical δ3 coupling built into tail rotors to reduce transient ﬂapping. The ﬁn
‘blockage’ effects on the tail rotor can reduce Nr by another 10–30% depending on
the separation and relative cover of the tail rotor from the ﬁn. Yaw motion in the hover
is therefore very lightly damped with a time constant of several seconds.
In low-speed manoeuvres the effect of the main rotor downwash over the tail
boom can have a strong effect on the yaw damping. The ﬂow inclination over the tail
boom can give rise to strong circulatory loads for deep, slender tail booms. This effect
has been explored in terms of tail rotor control margins in sideways ﬂight (Refs 4.9,
4.16 and 4.17), and the associated tail boom loads in steady conditions, from which we

 
230
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
can deduce the kind of effects that might be expected in manoeuvres. The magnitude
of the moment from the sideloads on the tail boom in a yaw manoeuvre depends on a
number of factors, including the strength and distribution of main rotor downwash, the
tail boom ‘thickness ratio’ and the location of any strakes to control the ﬂow separation
points (Ref. 4.16). A ﬁxed strake, located to one side of the tail boom (for example,
to reduce the tail rotor power requirement in right sideways ﬂight), is likely to cause
signiﬁcant asymmetry in yaw manoeuvres. Main rotors with low values of static twist
will have downwash distributions that increase signiﬁcantly towards the rotor tips,
leading to a tail boom centre of pressure in manoeuvres that is well aft of the aircraft
centre of mass. The overall effect is quite complex and will depend on the direction of
ﬂight, but increments to the yaw damping derivative could be quite high, perhaps even
as much as 100%.
As forward speed increases, so does the yaw damping in an approximately pro-
portional way up to moderate speeds, before levelling off at high speed, again akin to
the heave damping on the main rotor. The reduced value of Nr for the Puma, compared
with Lynx and Bo105, shown in Appendix 4B, stems from the low ﬁn effectiveness
at small sideslip angles discussed earlier in the context of the weathercock stability
derivative Nv. For larger sideslip excursions the derivative increases to the same level
as the other aircraft.
One small additional modifying effect to the yaw damping is related to the rotor-
speed governor sensing a yaw rate as an effective change in rotorspeed. At low forward
speeds, the yaw rate can be as high as 1 rad/s, or between 2 and 4% of the rotorspeed.
This will translate into a power change, hence a torque change and a yaw reaction on
the fuselage serving to increase the yaw damping, with a magnitude depending on the
gain and droop in the rotorspeed governor control loop.
Np and Lr couple the yaw and roll DoFs together. The rolling moment due to
yaw rate has its physical origin in the vertical offset of the tail rotor thrust and vertical
ﬁn sideforce from the aircraft centre of mass. Lr should therefore be positive, with
the tail rotor thrust increasing to starboard as the aircraft nose yaws to starboard.
However, if the offsets are small and the product of inertia Ixz relatively high, so that
the contribution of Nr to Lr increases, Lr can change sign, a situation occurring in the
Lynx, as shown in the derivative charts of the Appendix, Section 4B.2. The derivative
Np is more signiﬁcant and although the aerodynamic effects from the main and tail
rotor are relatively small, any product of inertia Ixz will couple the roll into yaw with
powerful consequences. This effect can be seen most clearly for the Lynx and Bo105
helicopters. The large negative values of Np cause an adverse yaw effect, turning
the aircraft away from the direction of the roll (hence turn). In the next section we
shall see how this effect inﬂuences the stability characteristics of the lateral/directional
motion. Before leaving Np and the stability derivatives however, it is worth discussing
the observed effect of large torque changes during rapid roll manoeuvres (Refs 4.18,
4.19). On some helicopters this effect can be so severe that overtorquing can occur and
the issue is given attention in the cautionary notes in aircrew manuals. The effect can
be represented as an effective Np. During low- to moderate-amplitude manoeuvres,
the changes in rotor torque caused by the drag increments on the blades are relatively
benign. However, as the roll rate is increased, the rotor blades can stall, particularly
when rolling to the retreating side of the disc (e.g., a roll rate of 90◦/s will generate
a local incidence change of about 3◦at the blade tip). The resulting transient rotor
torque change can now be signiﬁcant and lead to large demands on the engine. The

situation is exacerbated by the changes in longitudinal ﬂapping and hence pitching
moment with roll rate as the blades stall. Within the structure of the Level 1 Helisim
model, this effect cannot be modelled explicitly; a blade element rotor model with
nonlinear aerodynamics is required. The nonlinear nature of the phenomenon, to an
extent, also makes it inappropriate to use an equivalent linearization, particularly to
model the onset of the effect as roll rate increases.
The control derivatives
Of the 24 control derivatives, we have selected the 11 most signiﬁcant to discuss in
detail and have arranged these into four groups: collective force, collective moment,
cyclic moment and tail rotor collective force and moment.
The derivatives Zθ0, Zθ1s
The derivative of thrust with main rotor collective and longitudinal cyclic can be
obtained from the thrust and uniform inﬂow equations already introduced earlier in
this chapter as eqns 4.66, 4.67. Approximations for hover and forward ﬂight can be
written in the form

From the derivative charts in the Appendix, Section 4B.2, it can be seen that this
Z-force control derivative doubles in magnitude from hover to high-speed ﬂight. This
is the heave control sensitivity, and as with the heave damping derivative Zw, it is
primarily inﬂuenced by the blade loading and tip speed. The reader is reminded that
the force derivatives are in semi-normalized form, i.e., divided by the aircraft mass.
The thrust sensitivity for all three case aircraft is about 0.15 g/◦collective. Unlike
the heave damping, the control sensitivity continues to increase with forward speed,
reﬂecting the fact that the blade lift due to collective pitch changes divides into constant
and two-per-rev components, while the lift due to vertical gusts is dominated by the
one-per-rev incidence changes.
The thrust change with longitudinal cyclic is zero in the hover, and the approxi-
mation for forward ﬂight can be written as

(4.97)
As forward speed increases, the change in lift from aft cyclic on the advancing blade
is greater than the corresponding decrease on the retreating side, due to the differential
dynamic pressure. As with the collective derivative at higher speeds, Zθ1s increases
almost linearly with speed, reaching levels at high speed very similar to the collective
sensitivity in hover.

The derivatives Mθ0, Lθ0
Pitch and roll generated by the application of collective pitch arise from two physical
sources. First, the change in rotor thrust (already discussed above) will give rise to a
moment when the thrust line is offset from the aircraft centre of mass. Second, any
change in ﬂapping caused by collective will generate a hub moment proportional to
the ﬂap angle. It is the second of these effects that we shall focus on here. Referring to
the ﬂap response matrices from Chapter 3 (eqn 3.70), we can derive the main effect of
collective pitch on ﬂap by considering the behaviour of a teetering rotor at moderate
forward speed. Hence we assume that

The aft ﬂapping from increased collective develops from the greater increase in lift
on the advancing blade, than on the retreating blade in forward ﬂight. The effect
grows in strength as forward speed increases, hence the approximate proportionality
with speed. From the charts in the Appendix, Section 4B.2, we can observe that the
effect is considerably stronger for the hingeless rotor conﬁgurations, as expected. In
high-speed ﬂight, the pitching moment from collective is of the same magnitude as
the cyclic moment, illustrating the powerful effect of the differential loading from
collective. Increasing collective also causes the disc to tilt to starboard (to port on the
Puma). The physical mechanism is less obvious than for the pitching moment and
according to the approximation in eqn 4.100, the degree of lateral ﬂap for a change
in collective pitch is actually a function of the rotor Lock number. The disc tilt arises
from the rotor coning, which results in an increase in lift on the front of the disc and a
decrease at the rear when the blades cone up (e.g., following an increase in collective
pitch). The amount of lateral ﬂapping depends on the coning, which itself is a function
of the rotor Lock number. Once again, the resultant rolling moment will depend on the
balance between thrust changes and disc tilt effects, which will vary from aircraft to
aircraft (see control derivative charts in the Appendix, Section 4B.2).
The derivatives Mθ1s, Mθ1c, Lθ1s, Lθ1c
The dominant rotor moments are proportional to the disc tilt for the centre-spring

The cyclic control derivatives can therefore be approximated by the moment coefﬁcient
in parenthesis multiplied by the ﬂap derivatives. We gave some attention to these
functions in Chapter 2 of this book. The direct and coupled ﬂap responses to cyclic

where the Stiffness number is given by eqn 4.59. The variations of direct and cross-
coupled ﬂap derivatives with stiffness were illustrated in Fig. 2.21 (a), and are repeated
here as Fig. 4.22 for the reader’s convenience. Up to Stiffness numbers of about 0.3
the direct ﬂap derivative remains within a few percent of unity. The implication is that
current so-called hingeless or ’semi-rigid’ rotors (e.g., Lynx and Bo105) ﬂap in much
the same way as a teetering rotor following a cyclic control input –1◦direct ﬂap for
1◦cyclic. The cross-ﬂap derivative arises with non-zero stiffness, because the natural
frequency of ﬂap motion is then less than one-per-rev, resulting in a ﬂap response phase
of less than 90◦. The phase angle is given by tan−1 Sβ, hence varying up to about 17◦
for Sβ = 0.3. Although the cross-control derivative can be, at most, about 30% of the
direct derivative, when considering pitch to roll coupling, this can result in a much
greater coupled aircraft response to control inputs, because of the high ratio of pitch to
roll inertias. This is evidenced by the coupling derivative Lθ1s for the Lynx and Bo105
in the charts of the Appendix, Section 4B.2, which is actually of higher magnitude
than the direct control moment Mθ1s. The aircraft will therefore experience a greater
initial roll than pitch acceleration following a step longitudinal cyclic input. The cyclic
controls are usually ‘mixed’ at the swash plate partly to cancel out this initial coupling.
We have already discussed the cross-coupling effects from pitch and roll rates and,
according to the simple rotor theory discussed here, the total short-term coupling will
be a combination of the two effects.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
The derivatives YθOT , LθOT , NθOT
According to the simple actuator disc model of the tail rotor, the control derivatives
all derive from the change in tail rotor thrust due to collective pitch. As with the
derivatives Nv and Nr, the control derivative also decreases by as much as 30% as a
result of the action of a mechanical δ3 hinge set to take off 1◦pitch for every 1◦ﬂap.
The exact value depends upon the tail rotor Lock number. In the derivative charts in
the Appendix, Section 4B.2, we can see that the force derivative YθOT for the Bo105 is
about 20% higher than the corresponding values for the Lynx and Puma. The Bo105
sports a teetering tail rotor so that the δ3 effect works only to counteract cyclic ﬂapping.
The control derivatives increase with speed in much the same way as the main rotor
collective Z-force derivative, roughly doubling the hover value at high speed as the V 2
aerodynamics take effect.
The effects of non-uniform rotor inﬂow on damping and control derivatives
In Chapter 3 we introduced the concept of non-uniform inﬂow derived from local
momentum theory applied to the rotor disc (see eqns 3.161, 3.181). Just as the uniform
inﬂow balances the rotor thrust, so the ﬂow needs to react to any hub moments generated
by the rotor and a ﬁrst approximation is given by a one-per-rev variation. The non-
uniform inﬂow components can be written in the form given by
λ1c =

where the lift deﬁciency factor in the hover takes the form
C′
1 =
1
1 + a0s/16λ0
(4.106)
The non-uniform inﬂow has a direct effect on the ﬂapping motion and hence on the
moment derivatives. The effect was investigated in Refs 4.20 and 4.21 where a simple
scaling of the rotor Lock number was shown to reﬂect the main features of the hub
moment modiﬁcation. We can write the ﬂap derivatives as a linear combination of
partial effects, as shown for the ﬂap damping below:

(4.111)
Equation 4.108 shows the ﬁrst important effect of non-uniform inﬂow that manifests
itself even on rotors with zero hub stiffness. When the helicopter is pitching, the rotor
lags behind the shaft by the amount given in eqn 4.108. This ﬂapping motion causes
an imbalance of moments which has a maximum and minimum on the advancing and
retreating blades. This aerodynamic moment, caused by the ﬂapping rate, gives rise to a
wakereactionandthedevelopmentofanon-uniform,laterallydistributedcomponentof
downwash, λ1s, serving to reduce the incidence and lift on the advancing and retreating
blades. In turn, the blades ﬂap further in the front and aft of the disc, giving an increased
pitch damping Mq. The same arguments follow for rolling motion. The effect is quite
signiﬁcant in the hover, where the lift deﬁciency factor can be as low as 0.6.
By rearranging eqns 4.108 and 4.109, we may write the ﬂap derivatives in the
form

and can be approximated by unity.
The new terms in parentheses in eqns 4.112 and 4.113 represent the coupling
components of ﬂapping due to the non-uniform inﬂow and can make a signiﬁcant
contribution to the lateral (longitudinal) ﬂapping due to pitch (roll) rate, and hence to
the coupled rate derivatives Lq and Mp.

In the hover, for a rotor with zero ﬂap stiffness, the aerodynamic moment due to ﬂapping
is exactly equal to that from the applied cyclic pitch; hence there is no non-uniform
inﬂow in this case. The coupled ﬂap/control response, given by eqn 4.116, is the only
signiﬁcant effect for the control moments indicating an increase of the coupled ﬂapping
of about 60% when the lift deﬁciency factor is 0.6.
Some reﬂections on derivatives
Stability and control derivatives aid the understanding of helicopter ﬂight dynamics
and the preceding qualitative discussion, supported by elementary analysis, has been

 
236
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
aimed at helping the reader to grasp some of the basic physical concepts and mecha-
nisms at work in rotorcraft dynamics. Earlier in this chapter, the point was made that
there are three quite distinct approaches to estimating stability and control derivatives:
analytic, numerical, backward–forward differencing scheme and system identication
techniques. We have discussed some analytic properties of derivatives in the preceding
sections, and the derivative charts in the Appendix, Section 4B.3, illustrate numerical
estimates from the Helisim nonlinear simulation model. A discussion on ﬂight esti-
mated values of the Bo105 and Puma stability and control derivatives is contained in
the reported work of AGARD WG18 – Rotorcraft System Identiﬁcation (Refs 4.22,
4.23). Responses to multistep control inputs were matched by 6 DoF model struc-
tures by a number of different system identiﬁcation approaches. Broadly speaking,
estimates of primary damping and control derivatives compared favourably with the
Level 1 modelling described in this book. For cross-coupling derivatives and, to some
extent, the lower frequency velocity derivatives, the comparisons are much poorer,
however. In some cases this can clearly be attributed to missing features in the mod-
elling, but in other cases, the combination of a lack of information in the test data
and an inappropriate model structure (e.g., overparameterized model) suggests that the
ﬂight estimates are more in error. The work of AGARD WG18 represents a landmark
in the application of system identiﬁcation techniques to helicopters, and the reported
results and continuing analysis of the unique, high-quality ﬂight test data have the
potential for contributing to signiﬁcant increased understanding of helicopter ﬂight
dynamics. Selected results from this work will be discussed in Chapter 5, and the com-
parisons of estimated and predicted stability characteristics are included in the next
section.
Derivatives are, by deﬁnition, one-dimensional views of helicopter behaviour,
which appeal to the principle of superposition, and we need to combine the var-
ious constituent motions in order to understand how the unconstrained ﬂight tra-
jectory develops and to analyse the stability of helicopter motion. We should note,
however, that superposition no longer applies in the presence of nonlinear effects,
however small, and in this respect, we are necessarily in the realms of approximate
science.
4.3.3
The natural modes of motion
For small-amplitude stability analysis, helicopter motion can be considered to com-
prise a linear combination of natural modes, each having its own unique frequency,
damping and distribution of the response variables. The linear approximation that al-
lows this interpretation is extremely powerful in enhancing physical understanding of
the complex motions in disturbed ﬂight. The mathematical analysis of linear dynamic
systems is summarized in Appendix 4A, but we need to review some of the key results
to set the scene for the following discussion. Free motion of the helicopter is described
by the homogeneous form of eqn 4.41
˙x −Ax = 0
(4.117)
subject to initial conditions
x(0) = x0
(4.118)

 
Trim and Stability Analysis

The solution of the initial value problem can be written as
x(t) = W diag

exp(λit)

W−1x0 = Y(t)x0
(4.119)
The eigenvalues, λ, of the matrix A satisfy the equation
det [λI −A] = 0
(4.120)
and the eigenvectors w, arranged in columns to form the square matrix W, are the
special vectors of the matrix A that satisfy the relation
Awi = λiwi
(4.121)
The solution can be written in the alternative form
x(t) =
n

i=0
(vT
i x0) exp(λit)wi
(4.122)
where the v vectors are the eigenvectors of the transpose of A (columns of W−1), i.e.,
ATv j = λ jv j
(4.123)
The free motion is therefore shown in eqn 4.122 to be a linear combination of natural
modes, each with an exponential character in time deﬁned by the eigenvalue, and a
distribution among the states, deﬁned by the eigenvector.
The full 6 DoF helicopter equations are ninth order, usually arranged as
[u, w, q, θ, v, p, φ,r, ψ], but since the heading angle ψ appears only in the kine-
matic equation relating the rate of change of Euler angle ψ to the fuselage rates p, q, r,
this equation is usually omitted for the purpose of stability analysis. Note that, for the
ninth-order system including the yaw angle, the additional eigenvalue is zero (there is
no aerodynamic or gravitational reaction to a change in heading) and the associated
eigenvector is {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}.
The eight natural modes are described as linearly independent so that no single
mode can be made up of a linear combination of the others and, if a single mode
is excited precisely the motion will remain in that mode only. The eigenvalues and
eigenvectors can be complex numbers, so that a mode has an oscillatory character, and
such a mode will then be described by two of the eigenvalues appearing as conjugate
complex pairs. If all the modes were oscillatory, then there would only be four in total.
The stability of the helicopter can now be discussed in terms of the stability of the
individual modes, which is determined entirely by the signs of the real parts of the
eigenvalues. A positive real part indicates instability, a negative real part stability. As
one might expect, helicopter handling qualities, or the pilot’s perception of how well a
helicopter can be ﬂown in a task, are strongly inﬂuenced by the stability of the natural
modes. In some cases (for some tasks), a small amount of instability may be acceptable;
in others it may be necessary to require a deﬁned level of stability. Eigenvalues can
be illustrated as points in the complex plane, and the variation of an eigenvalue with
some ﬂight condition or aircraft conﬁguration parameter portrayed as a root locus. The
eigenvalues are given as the solutions of the determinantal eqn 4.120, which can also

be written in the alternate polynomial form as the characteristic equation

or as the product of individual factors

(· · · · · · ·)(λ −λ1) = 0
(4.125)
The coefﬁcients of the characteristic equation are nonlinear functions of the stability
derivatives discussed in the previous section. Before we discuss helicopter eigenvalues
and vectors, we need one further analysis tool that will prove indispensable for relating
the stability characteristics to the derivatives.
Although eigenanalysis is a simple computational task, the eighth-order system is
far too complex to deal with analytically, and we need to work analytically to glean any
meaningful understanding. We have seen from the discussion in the previous section
that many of the coupled longitudinal/lateral derivatives are quite strong and are likely
to have a major inﬂuence on the response characteristics. As far as stability is concerned
however, we shall make a ﬁrst approximation that the eigenvalues fall into two sets –
longitudinal and lateral, and append the analysis with a discussion of the effects of
coupling. Even grouping into two fourth-order sets presents a formidable analysis
problem, and to gain maximum physical understanding we shall strive to reduce the
approximations for the modes even further to the lowest order possible. The conditions
of validity of these reduced order modelling approximations are described in Appendix
4A where the method of weakly coupled systems is discussed (Ref. 4.24). In the
present context the method is used to isolate, where possible, the different natural
modes according to the dominant constituent motions. The partitioning works only
when there exists a natural separation of the modes in the complex plane. Effectively,
approximations to the eigenvalues of slow modes can be estimated by assuming that
the faster modes behave in a quasi-steady manner. Likewise, approximations to the fast
modes can be derived by assuming that the slower modes do not react in the fast time
scale. A second condition requires that the coupling effects between the contributing
motions are small. The theory is covered in Appendix 4A and the reader is encouraged
to assimilate this before tackling the examples described later in this section.
Figures 4.23, 4.24 and 4.25 illustrate the eigenvalues for the Lynx, Bo105 and
Puma, respectively, as predicted by the Helisim theory. The pair of ﬁgures for each
aircraft shows both the coupled longitudinal/lateral eigenvalues and the corresponding
uncoupled values. The predicted stability characteristics of Lynx and Bo105 are very
similar. Looking ﬁrst at the coupled results for these two aircraft, we see that an
unstable phugoid-type oscillation persists throughout the speed range, with time to
double amplitude varying from about 2.5 s in the hover to just under 2 s at high speed.
At the hover condition, this phugoid mode is actually a coupled longitudinal/lateral
oscillation and is partnered by a similar lateral/longitudinal oscillation which develops
into the classical Dutch roll oscillation in forward ﬂight, with the frequency increasing
strongly with speed. Apart from a weakly oscillatory heave/yaw oscillation in hover,
the other modes are all subsidences having distinct characters at hover and low speed –
roll, pitch, heave and yaw, but developing into more-coupled modes in forward ﬂight,
e.g., the roll/yaw spiral mode. The principal distinction between the coupled (Figs
4.23(a) and 4.24(a)) and the uncoupled (Figs 4.23(b) and 4.24(b)) cases lies in the

 
Trim and Stability Analysis
239
Fig. 4.23 Loci of Lynx eigenvalues as a function of forward speed: (a) coupled;
(b) uncoupled
stability of the oscillatory modes at low speed where the coupled case shows a much
higher level of instability. This effect can be shown to be almost exclusively due to the
coupling effects of the non-uniform inﬂow caused by the change in wake angle induced
by speed perturbations; the important derivatives are Mv and Lu, caused by the coupled
rotor ﬂapping response to lateral and longitudinal distributions of ﬁrst harmonic inﬂow
respectively. The unstable mode is a coupled pitch/roll oscillation with similar ratios
of p to q and v to u, in the eigenvector.
The Puma comparison is shown in Figs 4.25(a) and (b). The greater instability
for the coupled case at low speed is again present, and now we also see the short-
term roll and pitch subsidences combined into a weak oscillation at low speed and
hover. As speed increases the coupling effects again reduce, at least as far as stability
is concerned. Here we are not discussing response and we should expect the coupled
response characteristics to be strong at high speed, we shall return to this topic in
the next chapter. At higher speeds the modes of the Puma, with its articulated rotor,

resemble the classical ﬁxed-wing set: pitch short period, phugoid, Dutch roll, spiral
and roll subsidence. An interesting feature of the Puma stability characteristics is the
dramatic change in stability of the Dutch roll from mid- to high speed. We shall discuss
this later in the section.
Apart from relatively local, although important, effects, the signiﬁcance of cou-
pling for stability is sufﬁciently low to allow a meaningful investigation based on the
uncoupled results, and hence we shall concentrate on approximating the characteristics

The longitudinal modes
Hovering dynamics have long presented a challenge to reduced order modelling.
The eigenvectors for the unstable hover ‘phugoid’ for the three aircraft are given in
Table 4.3 and highlight that the contribution of the normal velocity w to this oscillation
is less than 10% of the forward velocity u.

Fig. 4.26 Simple representation of unstable pitch phugoid in hover
The ratio of the pitching moments due to speed (speed stability) and pitch rate (damp-
ing) play an important role in both the frequency and damping of the oscillation. This
mode can be visualized in the form of a helicopter rotating like a pendulum about a
virtual hinge (Fig. 4.26). The frequency of the pendulum is given by
ω2 = g
ℓ
(4.133)
where ℓis the length of the pendulum (i.e., distance of helicopter centre of mass below
the virtual hinge). This length determines the ratio of u to q in the eigenvector for this
mode (cf. eqn 4.131). Comparison of the approximations given above with the ‘exact’
uncoupled phugoid roots is given in Table 4.4.
There is good agreement, particularly for the Lynx and Bo105. The smaller pitch
damping for the Puma results in a more unstable motion, characteristic of articulated
rotor helicopters at low speed. The speed stability derivative Mu is approximately
proportional to the ﬂapping derivative
∂β1c
∂µ = 8
3θ0 −2λ0
(4.134)
and scaled by the hub moment. The amount of ﬂapback for a speed increment therefore
depends only on the rotor loading, deﬁned by the collective and inﬂow components.
This derivative is the source of the instability and dominates the damping in eqn 4.132.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
As the helicopter passes through the ‘trough’ of the oscillation, the velocity u and pitch
rate q are both at a maximum, the former leading to an increased pitch-up, the latter
leading to a pitch-down, which, in turn, leads to a further increase in the u velocity
component. The strong coupling of these effects results in the conventional helicopter
conﬁguration always being naturally unstable in hover.
The concept of the helicopter oscillating like a pendulum is discussed by Prouty
in Ref. 4.9, where the approximate expression for frequency of the motion is given by
ωp ≈

From eqn 4.133 we can approximate the location of the virtual point of rotation above
the helicopter
ℓ≈

(CT /a0s)γ ≈10R
(4.136)
The expression for the approximate damping given in eqn 4.132 provides a clue as to
the likely effects of feedback control designed to stabilize this mode. The addition of
pitch rate feedback (i.e., increase of Mq) would seem to be fairly ineffective and would
never be able to add more damping to this mode than the natural source from the small
Xu. Feeding back velocity, hence augmenting Mu, would appear to have a much more
powerful effect; a similar result could be obtained through attitude feedback, hence
adding effective derivatives Xθ and Mθ.
The longitudinal pitch and heave subsidences hold no secrets at low speed and
the eigenvalues are directly related to the damping derivatives in those two axes. The
comparisons are shown in Table 4.5.
The hover approximations hold good for predicting stability at low speed, but in
the moderate- to high-speed range, pitch and heave become coupled through the ‘other’
static stability derivative Mw, rendering the hover approximations invalid. From Figs
4.23(b), 4.24(b) and 4.25(b) we can see that the stability characteristics for the Lynx
and Bo105 are quite different from that of the Puma. As might be expected, this is due
to the different rotor types with the hingeless rotors exhibiting a much more unstable
phugoid mode at high speed, while the articulated rotor Puma features a classical short-
period pitch/heave oscillation and neutrally stable phugoid. At high speed, the normal
velocity w features in both the long and short period modes and this makes it difﬁcult
to partition the longitudinal system matrix into subsystems based on the conventional
aircraft states {u, w, q, θ}. In Ref.4.25 it is shown that a more suitable partitioning can
be found by recognizing that the motion in the long period mode is associated more

The strong coupling of the translational velocities with the angular velocities in both short
and long period modes actually results in the conditions for weak coupling being invalid for
our hingeless rotor helicopters. The powerful Mu and Mw effects result in strong coupling
between all the DoFs and the phugoid instability cannot be predicted using eqn 4.140.
For the Puma helicopter, on the other hand, the natural modes are more classical, and very
similar to a ﬁxed-wing aircraft with two oscillatory modes becoming more widely separated
as speed increases. Table 4.6 shows a comparison of the approximations for the phugoid

and short period stability characteristics at high speed with the exact longitudinal subset
results. The agreement is very good, particularly for the short period mode.
The short period mode involves a rapid incidence adjustment with little change in
forward speed, and has a frequency of about 2 rad/s at high speed for the Puma. Increasing
the pitch stiffness Mw increases this frequency. Key conﬁguration parameters that affect
the magnitude of this derivative are the tailplane effectiveness (moment arm × tail area ×
tail lift slope) and the aircraft centre of mass location. As noted in the earlier section on
derivatives, the hub moment contribution to Mw is always positive (destabilizing), which
accounts for the strong positive values for both Lynx and Bo105 and the associated major
change in character of the longitudinal modes.
The signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the aircraft centre of mass (centre of gravity (cg)) location
on longitudinal stability is illustrated in Fig. 4.27, which shows the eigenvalue of the Lynx
phugoid mode for forward (0.035R), mid (0.0) and aft (−0.035R) centre of mass locations
as a function of forward speed. With the aft centre of mass, the mode has become severely
unstable with a time to double amplitude of less than 1 s. At this condition the short
period approximation, eqn 4.142, becomes useful for predicting this change in the stability

characteristics. The stiffness part of the short period approximation, given by eqn 4.144,
is sometimes referred to as the manoeuvre margin of the aircraft (or the position of the
aerodynamic centre relative to the centre of mass during a manoeuvre), and we can see
from Table 4.7 that this parameter has become negative at high speed for the aft centre of
mass case, due entirely to the strongly positive Mw. The divergence is actually well predicted
by the short period approximation, along with the strong pitch subsidence dominated by
the derivative Mq.
The lateral/directional modes
The lateral/directional motion of a helicopter in forward ﬂight is classically composed of a
roll/yaw/sideslip (Dutch roll) oscillation and two aperiodic subsidences commonly referred
to as the roll and spiral modes. In hover, the modes have a broadly similar character, but
different modal content. The roll subsidence mode is well characterized by the roll damping
L p at hover and, with some exceptions, throughout the speed envelope. The spiral mode
in hover is largely made up of yaw motion (stability determined by yaw damping Nr) and
the oscillatory mode could better be described as the lateral phugoid, in recognition of the
similarity with the longitudinal phugoid mode already discussed. While the frequencies of
the two hover oscillations are very similar, one big difference with the lateral phugoid is
that the mode is predicted to be stable (for Bo105 and Lynx) or almost stable (Puma), on
account of the strong contribution of yaw motion to the mode. The ratio of yaw to roll in this
mode is typically about 2 for all three aircraft, rendering approximations based on a similar
analysis to that conducted for the pitch phugoid unsuitable. We have to move into forward
ﬂight to ﬁnd the Dutch roll mode more amenable to reduced order stability analysis, but
even then there are complications that arise due to the roll/yaw ratio. For our case aircraft,
the Lynx and Bo105 again exhibit similar characteristics to one another, while the Puma
exhibits more individual behaviour, although not principally because of its articulated rotor.
We shall return to the Puma later in this section, but ﬁrst we examine the more conventional
behaviour as typiﬁed by the Lynx.
Findingasuitablepartitioningforapproximatingthelateral/directionalmodesrequires
the introduction of a new state variable into the lateral DoFs. With longitudinal motion we
found that a partitioning into phugoid/short period subsets required the introduction of the
vertical velocity, in place of the Euler pitch angle θ. The basic problem is the same; where
both the short period and phugoid involved excursions in w, both the spiral and Dutch roll
mode typically involve excursions in the lateral velocity v as well as roll and yaw motion.
However, it can be shown that the spiral mode is characterized by excursions in the sway

The partitioning shown leads to three levels of approximation with regions in the

In the derivation of this approximation we have extended the analysis to second-order terms
(see Appendix 4A) to model the destabilizing effects of the dihedral effect shown in eqn
4.152.
Finally, the roll mode at the third level is given by
λr ≈L p
(4.155)
The accuracy of this set of approximations can be illustrated for the case of the Lynx at a
forward ﬂight speed of 120 knots, as shown below:
λsapprox = −0.039/s
λsexact = −0.042/s
2ζdωd approx = 1.32/s
2ζdωd exact = 1.23/s
ωdapprox = 2.66 rad/s
ωdexact = 2.57 rad/s
λrapprox = −10.3/s
λrexact = −10.63/s
The approximate eigenvalues are mostly well within 10% of the full subset predictions,
which provides conﬁdence in their worth, which actually holds good from moderate to high
speeds for both Lynx and Bo105. The validity of this approximation for the Dutch roll
oscillation depends upon the coupling between roll and yaw. The key coupling derivatives
are Np and Lv, both of which are large and negative for our two hingeless rotor helicopters.
The yaw due to roll derivative is augmented by the inertia coupling effects in eqn 4.48 (for
the Lynx. Ixz = 2767 kg/m2; for the Bo105, Ixz = 660 kg/m2). The simplest approximation
to the Dutch roll mode results when the coupling is zero so that the motion is essentially a
yaw/sideslip oscillation. The yaw rate then exhibits a 90◦phase lag relative to the sideslip
and the damping is given by the ﬁrst two terms in the numerator of eqn 4.152 (i.e., Nr + Yv).
A negative value of Np tends to destabilize the oscillation by superimposing a roll motion
into the mode such that the term Np p effectively adds negative damping. The eigenvector
for the Dutch roll mode of the Lynx at 120 knots, shown below, illustrates that, while the
yaw rate is still close to 90◦out of phase with sideslip, the roll/yaw ratio is 0.5 with the
yawing moment due to roll rate being almost in anti-phase with the sideslip.
v
1.0 m/s;
p
0.02 rad/s (160◦);
r

The approximations described above break down when the roll/yaw ratio in the Dutch roll
oscillation is high. Such a situation occurs for the Puma, and we close Chapter 4 with a
discussion of this case.
We refer back to Fig. 4.25(b) where the loci of the Puma eigenvalues are plotted with
speed. Above 100 knots, the Dutch roll mode becomes less and less stable until at high
speed the damping changes sign. At 120 knots, the Puma Dutch roll eigenvector is

a roll/yaw ratio of about 4, eight times that for the Lynx. The reason for the ‘unusual’

Fig. 4.28 Variation of weathercock stability derivative Nv with speed for different sideslip
perturbations for Puma
behaviour of the Dutch roll mode for the Puma can be attributed to the derivative Nv. In
the previous discussion on this weathercock stability derivative, we observed that the Puma
value was inﬂuenced by the strong nonlinearity in the force characteristics of the vertical
ﬁn with sideslip. At small angles of sideslip the ﬁn sideforce is practically zero, due to the
strong suction on the ‘undersurface’ of the thick aerofoil section (Refs 4.11, 4.12). For larger
angles of sideslip, the circulatory lift force builds up in the normal way. The value of the ﬁn
contribution to Nv therefore depends upon the amplitude of the perturbation used to generate
the derivative (as with the yaw damping Nr, to a lesser extent). In Fig. 4.28, the variation of
Nv with speed is shown for three different perturbation levels corresponding to <5◦, 15◦and
30◦of sideslip. For the small amplitude case, the directional stability changes sign at about
140 knots and is the reason for the loss of Dutch roll stability illustrated in Fig. 4.25(b).
For the large amplitude perturbations, the derivative increases with speed, indicating that
the vertical ﬁn is fully effective for this level of sideslip. Figure 4.29 presents the loci of
Dutch roll eigenvalues for the three perturbation sizes as a function of speed, revealing
the dramatic effect of the weathercock stability parameter. The mode remains stable for
the case of the high sideslip perturbation level. It appears that the Puma is predicted to
be unstable for small amplitudes and stable for large amplitude motion. These are classic
conditions for so-called limit cycle oscillations, where we would expect the oscillation to
limit in amplitude at some ﬁnite value with the mode initially dominated by roll and later,
as the amplitude grows, to settle into a more conventional yaw/roll motion. We shall return
to the nature of this motion when discussing response, in Chapter 5.
Comparison with ﬂight
Table 4.8 presents a comparison of the stability characteristics of Puma and Bo105 Helisim
with ﬂight estimates derived from the work of AGARD WG18 (Refs 4.22, 4.23). Generally
speaking, the comparison of modal frequencies is very good, while dampings are less
well predicted, particularly for the weakly damped or unstable phugoid and spiral modes.
The pitch/heave subsidences for the Bo105 show remarkable agreement while the roll
subsidence appears to be overpredicted by theory, although this is largely attributed to the
compensating effect of an added time delay in the adopted model structure used to derive
the ﬂight estimates (Ref. 4.22). This aspect is returned to in Chapter 5 when results are

The above discussions have concentrated on 6 DoF motion analysis. There are several
areas in helicopter ﬂight dynamics where important effects are missed by folding the rotor
dynamics and other higher order effects into the fuselage motions in quasi-steady form.
These will be addressed in the context of constrained stability and aircraft response analysis
in Chapter 5.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Appendix 4A
The Analysis of Linear Dynamic Systems (with
Special Reference to 6 DoF Helicopter Flight)
The application of Newton’s laws of motion to a helicopter in ﬂight leads to the assembly of
a set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of the aircraft response trajectory
and attitude with time. The motion is referred to an orthogonal axes system ﬁxed at the
aircraft’s cg. In Chapter 3 we have discussed how these equations can be combined together
in ﬁrst-order vector form, with state vector x(t) of dimension n, and written as
˙x = F(x, u, t)
(4A.1)
The dimension of the dynamic system depends upon the number of DoFs included. For
the moment we will consider the general case of dimension n. The solution of eqn 4A.1
depends upon the initial conditions of the motion state vector and the time variation of the
vector function F(x, u, t), which includes the aerodynamic loads, gravitational forces and
inertial forces and moments. The trajectory can be computed using any of a number of
different numerical integration schemes which time march through a simulation, achieving
an approximate balance of the component accelerations with the applied forces and mo-
ments at every time step. While this is an efﬁcient process for solving eqn 4A.1, numerical
integration offers little insight into the physics of the aircraft ﬂight behaviour. We need
to turn to analytic solutions to deliver a deeper understanding between cause and effect.
Unfortunately, the scope for deriving analytic solutions of general nonlinear differential
equations as in eqn 4A.1 is extremely limited; only in special cases can functional forms
be found and, even then, the range of validity is likely to be very small. Fortunately, the
same is not true for linearized versions of eqn 4A.1, and much of the understanding of
complex dynamic aircraft motions gleaned over the past 80 years has been obtained from
studying linear approximations to the general nonlinear motion. Texts that provide suitable
background reading and deeper understanding of the underlying theory of dynamic sys-
tems are Refs 4A.1–4A.3. The essence of linearization is the assumption that the motion
can be considered as a perturbation about a trim or equilibrium condition; provided that the
perturbations are small, the function F can usually be expanded in terms of the motion and
control variables (as discussed earlier in this chapter) and the response written in the form
x = Xe + δx
(4A.2)
where Xe is the equilibrium value of the state vector and δx is the perturbation. For conve-
nience, we will drop the δ and write the perturbation equations in the linearized form

The ﬂight state vector x is a vector in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of

Longitudinal motion is here described by the four-vector with elements u (forward velocity
perturbation from trim Ue), w (normal velocity perturbation from trim We), q (pitch rate)
and θ (pitch attitude perturbation from trim e). As an illustration of the forcing function,
we have included both collective and cyclic rotor controls and a normal gust ﬁeld wg. In this
tutorial-style appendix, we will use the example given by eqn 4A.7 to illustrate the physical
signiﬁcance of theoretical results as they are derived.
Equation 4A.3 is valid for calculating the perturbed responses from a trim point, but
in the homogeneous form, with no forcing function, it can be used to quantify the stability
characteristics for small motions of the nonlinear dynamic system described by eqn 4A.1.
This is a most important application and underpins most of the understanding of ﬂight
dynamics. The free motion solutions of eqn 4A.3 take the form of exponential functions;
the signs of the real parts determine the stability with positive values indicating instability.
The theory of the stability of motion for linear dynamic systems can be most succinctly
expressed using linear algebra and the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Consider the free motion given by
˙x −Ax = 0
(4A.8)
With the intention of simplifying the equations, we introduce the transformation
x = Wy
(4A.9)
so that eqn 4A.8 can be written as
˙y −y = 0
(4A.10)
with
 = W−1AW
(4A.11)
For a given matrix A, there is a unique transformation matrix W that reduces A to a
canonical form, A, most often diagonal, so that eqn 4A.10 can usually be written as a series

We need to stop here and take stock. The transformation matrix W and the set of numbers
λ have a special meaning in linear algebra; if wi is a column of W then the pairs [wi, λi]
are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix A. The eigenvectors are special in that
when they are transformed by the matrix A, all that happens is that they change in length,
as given by the equation
Awi = λiwi
(4A.17)
No other vectors in the space on which A operates are quite like the eigenvectors. Their
special property makes them suitable as basis vectors for describing more general motion.
The associated eigenvalues are the real or complex scalars given by the n solutions of the
polynomial
det[λI −A] = 0
(4A.18)
The free motion of a helicopter is therefore described by a linear combination of simple
exponential motions, each with a mode shape given by the eigenvector and a trajectory
envelope deﬁned by the eigenvalue. Each mode is linearly independent of the others, i.e.,
the motion in a mode is unique and cannot be made up from a combination of other modes.
Earlier in this chapter, a full discussion on the character of the modes of motion and how they
vary with ﬂight state and aircraft conﬁguration was given. Below, in Figs 4A.1 and 4A.2, we
illustrate the eigenvalue and eigenvector associated with the longitudinal short period mode
of the Puma ﬂying straight and level at 100 knots; we have included the modal content of
all eight state vector components u, w, q, θ, v, p, φ,r. The eigenvalue, illustrated in Fig.
4A.1, is given by
λsp = −1.0 ± 1.3i
(4A.19)
The negative unit real part gives a time to half amplitude of

Re(λsp) = 0.69 s

(4A.21)
and, ﬁnally, the damping ratio is given by
ζsp = −Re(λsp)
ωsp
= 0.769
(4A.22)
We choose to present the angular and translational rates in the eigenvectors shown in Fig.
4A.2 in deg/s and in m/s respectively. Because the mode is oscillatory, each component
has a magnitude and phase and Fig. 4A.2 is shown in polar form. During the short period
oscillation, the ratio of the magnitudes of the exponential envelope of the state variables
remains constant. Although the mode is described as a pitch short period, it can be seen in
Fig. 4A.2 that the roll and sideslip coupling content is signiﬁcant, with roll about twice the
magnitude of pitch. Pitch rate is roughly in quadrature with heave velocity.

Equations 4A.24 and 4A.26 give us useful information about the system response. For
example, if the initial conditions or forcing functions are distributed throughout the states
with the same ratios as an eigenvector, the response will remain in that eigenvector. The
mode participation factors, in the particular integral component of the solution, given by
vT
i (Bu(τ) + f(τ))
(4A.27)
determine the contribution of the response in each mode wi.
A special case is the solution for the case of a periodic forcing function of the form

a function of frequency can be represented as the value of the so-called transfer function,

Fig. 4A.3 Frequency response as the transfer function evaluated on imaginary axis
when s = iω. In Fig. 4A.3 a single oscillatory mode is shown, designated the pitch short
period. In practice, for the 6 DoF helicopter model, all eight poles would be present, but
the superposition principle also applies to the transfer function. The peaks in the frequency
response correspond to the modes of the system (i.e., the roots of the denominator D(s) = 0
in eqn 4A.30) that are set back in either the right-hand side or the left-hand side of the
complex plane, depending on whether the eigenvalue real parts are positive (unstable) or
negative (stable). The troughs in the frequency response function correspond to the zeros
of the transfer function, or the eigenvalues for the case of inﬁnite gain when a feedback
loop between input and output is closed (i.e., the roots of the numerator N(s) = 0 in eqn
4A.30). Ultimately, at a high enough frequency, the gain will typically roll-off to zero as
the order of D(s) is higher than N(s). The phase between input and output varies across
the frequency range, with a series of ramp-like 180◦changes as each mode is traversed; for
modes in close proximity the picture is more complicated.
For the case when the system modes are widely separated, a useful approximation
can sometimes be applied that effectively partitions the system into a series of weakly cou-
pled subsystems (Ref. 4A.4). We illustrate the technique by considering the n-dimensional
homogeneous system, partitioned into two levels of subsystem, with states x1 and x2, with
dimensions ℓand m, such that n = ℓ+ m

Equation 4A.31 can be expanded into two ﬁrst-order equations and the eigenvalues can be
determined from either of the alternative forms of characteristic equation
f1(λ) =
--λI −A11 −A12(λI −A22)−1A21
-- = 0
(4A.32)
f2(λ) =
--λI −A22 −A21(λI −A11)−1A12

We assume that the eigenvalues of the subsystems A11{λ(1)
1 , λ(2)
1 , . . . , λ(ℓ)
1 } and
A22{λ(1)
2 , λ(2)
2 , . . . , λ(m)
2 } are widely separated in modulus. Speciﬁcally, the eigenvalues of
A11 lie within the circle of radius r (r = max|λ(i)
1 |), and the eigenvalues of A22 lie without
the circle of radius R (R = min|λ( j)
2 |). We have assumed that the eigenvalues of smaller
modulus belong to the matrix A11. The method of weakly coupled systems is based on
the hypothesis that the solutions to the characteristic eqn 4A.32 can be approximated by
the roots of the ﬁrst m + 1 terms and the solution to the characteristic eqn 4A.33 can be
approximated by the roots of the last ℓ+ 1 terms, solved separately. It is shown in Ref.
4A.4 that this hypothesis is valid when two conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) the eigenvalues form two disjoint sets separated as described above, i.e.,
 r
R

<< 1
(4A.35)
(2) the coupling terms are small, such that if γ and δ are the maximum elements of the
coupling matrices A12 and A21, then

ℓγ δ
R2

<< 1
(4A.36)
When these weak coupling conditions are satisﬁed, the eigenvalues of the complete system
can be approximated by the two polynomials
f1(λ) =
--λI −A11 + A12A−1
22 A21
-- = 0
(4A.37)
f2(λ) = |λI −A22| = 0
(4A.38)
According to eqns 4A.37 and 4A.38, the larger eigenvalue set is approximated by the roots of
A22 and is unaffected by the slower dynamic subsystem A11. Conversely, the smaller roots,
characterizing the slower dynamic subsystem A11, are strongly affected by the behaviour
of the faster subsystem A22. In the short term, motion in the slow modes does not develop
enough to affect the overall motion, while in the longer term, the faster modes have reached
their steady-state values and can be represented by quasisteady effects.
The method has been used extensively earlier in this chapter, but here we provide an
illustration by looking more closely at the longitudinal motion of the Puma helicopter in
forward ﬂight, given by the homogeneous form of eqn 4A.7, i.e.,

The eigenvalues of the longitudinal subsystem are the classical short period and phugoid
modes with numerical values for the 100-knot ﬂight condition given by
Phugoid:
λ1,2 = −0.0103 ± 0.176i
(4A.40)
Short period:
λ3,4 = −1.0 ± 1.30i
(4A.41)
While these modes are clearly well separated in magnitude (r/R = O(0.2)), the form of the
dynamic system given by eqn 4A.39 does not lend itself to partitioning as it stands. The
phugoid mode is essentially an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with excursions
in forward velocity and vertical velocity, while the short period mode is a rapid incidence

adjustment with only small changes in speed. This classical form of the two longitudinal
modes does not always characterize helicopter motion however; earlier in this chapter, it was
shown that the approximation breaks down for helicopters with stiff rotors. For articulated
rotors, the equations can be recast into more appropriate coordinates to enable an effective
partitioning to be achieved. The phugoid mode can be better represented in terms of the
forward velocity u and vertical velocity
w0 = w −Ueθ
(4A.42)
Equation 4A.39 can then be recast in the partitioned form

A comparison of the exact and approximate eigenvalues is shown in Table 4A.1, using the
derivatives shown in the charts of Appendix 4B. The two different ‘exact’ results are given
for the fully coupled longitudinal and lateral equations and the uncoupled longitudinal set.
Comparisons are shown for two ﬂight speeds – 100 knots and 140 knots. A ﬁrst point
to note is that the coupling with lateral motion signiﬁcantly reduces the phugoid damping,

particularly at 140 knots where the oscillation is almost neutrally stable. The converse is true
for the short period mode. The weakly coupled approximation fares much better at the higher
speed and appears to converge towards the exact, uncoupled results. The approximations do
not predict the growing loss of phugoid stability as a result of coupling with lateral dynamics,
however. The higher the forward speed, the more the helicopter phugoid resembles the ﬁxed-
wing phugoid where the approximation works very well for aircraft with strongly positive
manoeuvre margins (the constant term in eqn 4A.45 with negative Mw).
The approximations given by eqns 4A.44 and 4A.45 are examples of many that are
discussed in Chapter 4 and that serve to provide additional physical insight into complex
behaviour at a variety of ﬂight conditions. The importance of the speed stability derivative
Mu in the damping and frequency of the phugoid is highlighted by the expressions. For a
low-speed ﬁxed-wing aircraft, Mu is typically zero, while the effect of pitching moments
due to speed effects dominates the helicopter phugoid. The last term in eqn 4A.45 represents
the manoeuvre margin and the approximation breaks down long before instability occurs
at positive values of the static stability derivative Mw (Ref. 4A.5).
To complete this appendix we present two additional results from the theory of weakly
coupled systems. For cases where the system partitions naturally into three levels

Similar conditions for weak coupling apply to the three levels of subsystem A11, A22 and

The second result concerns cases where a second-order approximation is required to
determine an accurate estimate of the low-order eigenvalue. Writing the expanded inverse,

ufactured by Eurocopter France (ECF) (formerly Aerospatiale, formerly Sud Aviation), and
in service with a number of civil operators and armed forces, including the Royal Air Force,
to support battleﬁeld operations. The DRA (RAE) research Puma XW241 (Fig. 4B.5) was
one of the early development aircraft acquired by RAE in 1974 and extensively instrumented
for ﬂight dynamics and rotor aerodynamics research. With its original analogue data acqui-
sition system, the Puma provided direct support during the 1970s to the development of new
rotor aerofoils through the measurement of surface pressures on modiﬁed blade proﬁles. In

the early 1980s a digital PCM system was installed in the aircraft and a research programme
to support simulation model validation and handling qualities was initiated. Over the period
between 1981 and 1988, more than 150 h of ﬂight testing was carried out to gather basic
ﬂight mechanics data throughout the ﬂight envelope of the aircraft (Ref. 4B.1). The aircraft
was retired from RAE service in 1989.
A three-view drawing of the aircraft in its experimental conﬁguration is shown in Fig.
4B.6. The aircraft has a four-bladed articulated man rotor (modiﬁed NACA 0012 section,
3.8% ﬂapping hinge offset). The physical characteristics of the aircraft used to construct
the Helisim simulation model are provided in Table 4B.3.
Fuselage aerodynamic characteristics
Chapter 3 developed a generalized form for the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on
the fuselage; Table 4B.4 presents a set of values of force and moment coefﬁcients, giving
one-dimensional, piecewise linear variations with incidence and sideslip. These values have
been found to reﬂect the characteristics of a wide range of fuselage shapes; they are used
in Helisim to represent the large angle approximations.
Small angle approximations (−20◦< (α f , β f ) < 20◦) for the fuselage aerodynamics
of the Lynx, Bo105 and Puma helicopters, based on wind tunnel measurements, are given in
eqns 4B.1 – 4B.15. The forces and moments (in N, N/rad, N m, etc.) are given as functions
of incidence and sideslip at a speed of 30.48 m/s (100 ft/s). The increased order of the
polynomial approximations for the Bo105 and Puma is based on more extensive curve
ﬁtting applied to the wind tunnel test data. The small angle approximations should be fared
into the large angle piecewise forms.

Empennage aerodynamic characteristics
Following the convention and notation used in Chapter 3, small angle approximations
(−20◦< (αtp, β f n) < 20◦) for the vertical tailplane and horizontal ﬁn (normal) aerodynamic
force coefﬁcients are given by the following equations. As for the fuselage forces, the Puma
approximations have been curve ﬁtted to greater ﬁdelity over the range of small incidence
and sideslip angles.

Stability and control derivatives
ThestabilityandcontrolderivativespredictedbyHelisimforthethreesubjecthelicoptersare
shown in Figs 4B.7–4B.13 as functions of forward speed. The ﬂight conditions correspond
to sea level (ρ = 1.227 kg/m3) with zero sideslip and turn rate, from hover to 140 knots.
Figures 4B.7 and 4B.8 show the direct longitudinal and lateral derivatives respectively.
Figures 4B.9 and 4B.10 show the lateral to longitudinal, and longitudinal to lateral, coupling
derivatives respectively. Figures 4B.11 and 4B.12 illustrate the longitudinal and lateral main
rotor control derivatives, and Fig. 4B.13 shows the tail rotor control derivatives. As an aid
to interpreting the derivative charts, the following points should be noted:
(1) The force derivatives are normalized by aircraft mass, and the moment derivatives are
normalized by the moments of inertia.
(2) For the moment derivatives, pre-multiplication by the inertia matrix has been carried
out so that the derivatives shown include the effects of the product of inertia Ixz (see
eqns 4.47–4.51).
(3) The derivative units are as follows:
force/translational velocity
e.g. Xu
1/s
force/angular velocity
e.g. Xq
m/s. rad
moment/translational velocity
e.g. Mu
rad/s. m
moment/angular velocity
e.g. Mq
1/s
force/control
e.g. Xθ0

moment/control
e.g. Mθ0

(4) the force/angular velocity derivatives, as shown in the ﬁgures, include the trim
velocities, e.g.,

In the following tables, the A and B matrices and the associated eigenvalues of A are listed for the Lynx, Puma and Bo105 at ﬂight speeds from
hover to 140 knots in straight and level ﬂight, i.e.,
a = Pe = Qe = Re = 0. Eigenvalues are given for both with and without longitudinal-lateral/
directional couplings.
Note – the Lynx derivatives in the ﬁrst edition were computed with the tail rotor δ3inadvertently set to zero; the new results have δ3 = 45°, affecting 
primarily the lateral/directional stability and control derivatives.

Appendix 4C
the Trim Orientation Problem
In this section we derive the relationship between the ﬂight trim parameters and the velocities
in the fuselage axes system, for use earlier in the chapter. Figure 4C. 1 shows the trim velocity
vector V f e of the aircraft with positive components along the fuselage axes directions x, y
and z given by Ue, Ve and We respectively, where subscript e denotes equilibrium.
The trim condition is deﬁned in terms of the trim velocity V f e, the ﬂight path angle
γ f e, the sideslip angle βe and the angular velocity about the vertical axis ae. The latter
plays no part in the translational velocity derivations. The incidence and sideslip angles are
deﬁned as
αe = tan−1

The sequence of discrete orientations required to derive the fuselage velocities in terms of
the trim variables is shown below in Fig. 4C.2.
The axes are ﬁrst rotated about the horizontal y-axis through the ﬂight path angle.
Next, the axes are rotated through the track angle, positive to port (corresponding to a
positive sideslip angle) giving the orientation of the horizontal velocity component relative
to the projected aircraft axes. The ﬁnal two rotations about the Euler pitch and roll angles
bring the axes into alignment with the aircraft axes as deﬁned in Chapter 3, Section 3A.1.

then given by the solution of a quadratic, i.e.,

kχ2 = cos e cos γfe
(4C.10)
kχ3 = sin βe −sin e cos e sin γfe
(4C.11)
Only one of the solutions of eqn 4C.6 will be physically valid in a particular case.
Finally, the relationship between the fuselage angular velocities and the trim vertical
rotation rate can be easily derived using the same transformation as for the gravitational
forces. Hence,
Pe = −ae sin e

Qe = ae cos e sin e
(4C.13)
Re = ae cos e cos e

Note that for conventional level turns, the roll rate p is small and the pitch and yaw rates
are the dominant components, with the ratio between the two dependent upon the trim bank
angle. In trim at high climb or descent rates the pitch angle can be signiﬁcantly different
from zero, increasing the roll rate in the turn manoeuvre.

Modelling helicopter ﬂight dynamics:
stability under constraint and
response analysis
Everybody’s simulation model is guilty until proved innocent. (Thomas H.
Lawrence at the 50th Annual Forum of the AHS, Washington, 1994)
5.1
Introduction and Scope
Continuing the theme of ‘working with models’, this chapter deals with two related
topics – stability under constraint and response. The response to controls and atmos-
pheric disturbances is the third in the trilogy of helicopter ﬂight mechanics topics;
where Chapter 4 focused on trim and natural stability, response analysis is given
prime attention in Section 5.3. Understandably, a helicopter’s response characteristics
can dominate a pilot’s impression of ﬂying qualities in applied ﬂying tasks or mission
task elements. A pilot may, for example, be able to compensate for reduced stability
provided the response to controls is immediate and sufﬁciently large. He may also be
quite oblivious to the ‘trim-ability’ of the aircraft when active on the controls. What he
will be concerned with is the helicopter’s ability to be ﬂown smoothly, and with agility
if required, from place to place, and also the associated ﬂying workload to compensate
for cross-couplings, atmospheric disturbances and poor stability. Quantifying the qual-
ity of these response characteristics has been the subject of an extensive international
research programme, initiated in the early 1980s. Chapter 6 deals with these in
detail, but in the present chapter we shall examine the principal aerodynamic and
dynamic effects, mostly unique to the helicopter, which lead to the various response
characteristics. Response by its very nature is a nonlinear problem, but insight can be
gained from investigating small amplitude response through the linearized equations
of perturbed motion. This is particularly true for situations where the pilot, human or
automatic, is attempting to constrain the motion – to apply strong control – to achieve a
task. We discuss this class of problems in Section 5.2, with an emphasis on the kind of
changes in the pilot/vehicle stability that can come about, therefore maintaining some
continuity with the material in Chapter 4. Section 5.3 follows with an examination
of the characteristics of the helicopter’s response to clinical control inputs, and the
chapter is concluded with a brief discussion on helicopter response to atmospheric
disturbances.

(DoF) motion, from which considerable insight into helicopter ﬂight dynamics can
be gained. However, when the domain of interest on the frequency/amplitude plane
includes ‘higher order’ DoFs associated with the rotors, engines, transmission and
ﬂight control system, the theory can become severely limited, and recourse to more

complexity is essential. Selected topics that require this greater complexity will be
featured in this chapter.
5.2
Stability Under Constraint
Both civil and military helicopters are required to operate in conﬁned spaces, often in
conditions of poor visibility and in the presence of disturbed atmospheric conditions.
To assist the pilot with ﬂight path (guidance) and attitude (stabilization) control, some
helicoptersareﬁttedwithautomaticstabilityandcontrolaugmentationsystems(SCAS)
that,throughacontrollaw,feedbackacombinationoferrorsinaircraftstatestotherotor
controls. The same effect can be achieved by the pilot, and depending on the level of
SCAS sophistication and the task the share of the workload falling on the pilot can vary
from low to very high. The combination of aircraft, SCAS and pilot, coupled together
into a single dynamic system, can exhibit stability characteristics profoundly different
than the natural behaviour discussed in detail in Chapter 4. An obvious aim of the SCAS
and the pilot is to improve stability and task performance, and in most situations the
control strategy to achieve this is conceptually straightforward – proportional control
to cancel primary errors, rate control to quicken the response and integral action to
cancel steady-state errors. In some situations, however, the natural control option does
not always lead to improved stability and response, e.g., tight control of one constituent
motion can drive another unstable. It is of interest to be able to predict such behaviour
and to understand the physical mechanisms at work. A potential barrier to physical
insight in such situations, however, is the increased dimension of the problem. The
sketch of the Lynx SCAS in Chapter 3 (see Fig. 3.36) highlights the complexity of a
relatively simple automatic system. Integrating the SCAS with the aircraft will lead
to a dynamic system of much higher order than that of the aircraft itself; the pilot
behaviour will be even more complex and the scope for deriving further understanding
of the dynamic behaviour diminishes, as the complexity and order of the integrated
system model increases.
One solution to this dilemma was ﬁrst discussed by Neumark in Ref. 5.1, who
identiﬁed that it was possible to imagine control so strong that one or more of the mo-
tion variables could actually be held at equilibrium or some other prescribed values.
The behaviour of the remaining, unconstrained, variables would then be described by a
reduced order dynamical system with dimension even less than the order of the natural
aircraft. This concept of constrained ﬂight has considerable appeal for the analysis of
motion under strong pilot or SCAS control because of the potential for deriving physical
understanding from tractable, low-order analytic solutions. Neumark’s attention was
drawn to solving the problem of speed stability for ﬁxed-wing aircraft operating below
minimum drag speed; by applying strong control of ﬂight path with elevator, the pilot
effectively drives the aircraft into speed instability. In a later report, Pinsker (Ref. 5.2)
demonstrated how, through strong control of roll attitude on ﬁxed-wing aircraft with
relatively high values of aileron-yaw, a pilot could drive the effective directional stiff-
ness negative, leading to nose-slice departure characteristics. Clearly, a helicopter pilot
has only four controls to cope with 6 DoFs. If the operational situation demands that the
pilot constrains some motions more tightly than others, then there is always a question
over the stability of the unconstrained motion. If strong control is required to maintain
a level attitude for example, then ﬂight path accuracy may suffer and vice versa. Should

strong control of some variables lead to a destabilizing of others, then the pilot should
soon recognize this and subsequently share his workload between constraining the
primary DoFs and compensating for residual motions of the weakly constrained DoFs.
This apparent loss of stability can be described as a pilot-induced oscillation (PIO).
However, this form of PIO can be insidious in two respects: ﬁrst, where the uncon-
strained motion departs slowly, making it difﬁcult for the pilot to identify the departure
until well developed, and second, where a rapid loss of stability occurs with only a
small increase in pilot gain. With helicopters, the relatively loose coupling of the ro-
tor and fuselage (compared with the wing and fuselage of a ﬁxed-wing aircraft) can
exacerbate the problem of constrained ﬂight to the extent that coupled rotor/fuselage
motions can occur which have a limited effect on the aircraft ﬂight path, yet cause
signiﬁcant attitude excursions.
In the following analyses, we shall deal with strong attitude control and strong
ﬂight path control separately. We shall make extensive use of the theory of weakly
coupled systems (Ref. 5.3), which was used to investigate motion under constraint
in Ref. 5.4. The theory is described in Appendix 4A and has already been utilized
in Chapter 4 in the derivation of approximations for a helicopter’s natural stability
characteristics. The reader is referred to these sections of the book and the references for
further elucidation. The method is ideally suited to the analysis of strongly controlled
aircraft, when the dynamic motions tend to split into two types – those under control and
those not – with the latter tending to form into new modes with stability characteristics
quite different from those of the uncontrolled aircraft. In control theory terms, these
modes become the zeros of the closed-loop system in the limit of inﬁnite gain.
5.2.1
Attitude constraint
To illustrate the principal effects of strong attitude control, we ﬁrst examine pitch
control and simplify the analysis by considering the longitudinal subset only. The
essential features are preserved under this decoupled approximation. Strong control
is assumed to be applied by the pilot or SCAS through simple proportional and rate
feedback of pitch attitude to the longitudinal cyclic pitch
θ1s = kθθ + kqq,
kθ, kq < 0
(5.1)
where the gains k are measured in deg/deg (deg/deg s) or rad/rad (rad/rad s). Typi-
cal values used in limited authority SCAS systems are O(0.1), whereas pilots can
adopt gains an order of magnitude greater than this in tight tracking tasks. We
make the assumption that, for high values of gain, the pitch attitude θ and rate q,
motions separate off from the ﬂight path translational velocities u and w, leaving
these latter variables to dominate the unconstrained modes. This line of argument
leads to a partitioning of the longitudinal system matrix (subset of eqn 4.45) in the
form

The derivatives have now been augmented by the control terms as shown. Before
deriving the approximating polynomials for the low modulus (u, w) and high mod-
ulus (θ, q) subsystems, we note that the transfer function of the attitude response to
longitudinal cyclic can be written in the form
θ(s)
θ1s(s) = (λkq + kθ)R(s)
D(s)
(5.3)
where the polynomial D(s) is the characteristic equation for the longitudinal open-loop
eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are given by the expression
D(λ) −(λkq + kθ)R(λ) = 0
(5.4)
where the polynomial R(λ) gives the closed-loop zeros, or the eigenvalues for inﬁnite
control gains, and can be written in the expanded form

Equation 5.5 signiﬁes that there are two ﬁnite zeros for strong attitude control and,
referring to eqn 5.4, we can see a further zero at the origin for strong control of pitch
rate. Figure 5.1 shows a sketch of the loci of longitudinal eigenvalues for variations in
kθ and kq. The forms of the loci are applicable to hingeless rotor conﬁgurations, which
exhibit two damped aperiodic modes throughout the speed range. Articulated rotor
helicopters, whose short-term dynamics are characterized by a short period oscillation,
would exhibit a similar pattern of zeros. The two ﬁnite zeros shared by both the attitude
and rate control loops are given by the roots of eqn 5.5 and both remain stable over
the forward ﬂight envelope. For strong control, we can derive approximations for the
closed-loop poles of the augmented system matrix in eqn 5.2 from the weakly coupled

The approximations work well for moderate to high levels of feedback gain (k O(1)).
For weak control (k O(0.1)) however, the approximations given above will not produce
accurate results. To progress here we should have to derive an analytic extension
to the approximations for the open-loop poles derived in Chapter 4. The terms in
eqns 5.7 and 5.8 that are independent of the control derivatives reﬂect the crude,
but effective, approximation found by perfectly constraining the pitch attitude. The
two subsidences of the low-order approximation, which emerge from strong attitude
control, are essentially a speed mode (dominated by u), with almost neutral stability,
and a heave mode (dominated by w), with time to half amplitude given approximately
by the heave damping Zw. The strongly controlled mode, with stability given by
eqn 5.9, exhibits an increase in frequency proportional to the square root of attitude
feedback gain, and in damping proportional to the rate feedback gain. The shift of the
(open-loop) pitch and heave modes to (closed-loop) heave and speed modes at high
gain is accompanied by a reduction in the stability of these ﬂight trajectory motions,
but the overall coupled aircraft/controller system remains stable.
A concern with strong attitude control is actually not so much with the uncon-
strained motion, but rather with the behaviour of the constrained motion when the
presence of higher order modes with eigenvalues further out into the complex plane is
taken into account. The problem is best illustrated with reference to strong control of
roll attitude and we restrict the discussion to the hover, although the principles again
extend to forward ﬂight. Figure 5.2 illustrates the varying stability characteristics of
Helisim Lynx in hover with the simple proportional feedback loop deﬁned by
θ1c = kφφ,
kφ > 0
(5.10)
where, once again, the control may be effected by an automatic SCAS and/or by the
pilot. The scale on Fig. 5.2 has been deliberately chosen for comparison with later
results. The cluster of pole-zeros around the origin is of little interest in the present
discussion; all these eigenvalues lie within a circle of radius <1 rad/s and represent

the unconstrained, coupled lateral and longitudinal modes, none of which is threatened
with instability by the effects of high gain. However, any system modes that lie in the
path of the strongly controlled mode (shown as the locus increasing with frequency and
offset by approximately L p/2 from the imaginary axis) can have a signiﬁcant effect
on overall stability. Table 5.1 shows a comparison of the coupled system eigenvalues
for the 6 DoF ‘rigid body dynamics’ and 9 DoF coupled dynamics cases, the latter in-
cluding the ﬂapping Dofs as multi-blade coordinates (see Chapter 3, eqns 3.55–3.63).

Both ﬁrst-order and second-order ﬂapping dynamics have been included for compari-
son, illustrating that the regressing ﬂap mode is reasonably well predicted by neglecting
the acceleration effects in the multi-blade coordinates β1c and β1s.
The similar modulus of the roll subsidence and regressing ﬂap modes (both lie
roughly on the complex plane circle with radius 10 rad/s), together with the presence of
appreciable roll motion in the latter, signals that the use of the 6 DoF weakly coupled
approximation for analysing the effects of strong roll control on the stability of lateral
motion is unlikely to be valid. Observing the location of the regressing ﬂap mode
eigenvalue from Table 5.1, and referring to Fig. 5.2, we can also see that the regressing
ﬂap mode lies in the path of the root locus of the strongly controlled roll mode –
another clear indication that the situation is bound to change with the addition of
higher order ﬂapping dynamics. The root loci of roll attitude feedback to lateral cyclic
for the second-order 9 DoF model is shown in Fig. 5.3, revealing that the stability
is, as anticipated, changed markedly by the addition of the regressing ﬂap mode. The
fuselage eigenvalues no longer coalesce and stiffen the roll axis response into a high-
frequency oscillation, but instead the high-gain response energy becomes entrained
in a coupled roll/ﬂap mode which becomes unstable at relatively low values of gain,
depending on the aircraft conﬁguration. For the Lynx in hover illustrated in Fig. 5.3,
the critical value of gain is just below unity. In practice, the response amplitude will
be limited by nonlinearities in the actuation system for SCAS operation, or by the
pilot reducing his gain and backing out of the control loop. Even for lower values of
attitude gain, typical of those found in a SCAS (O(0.2)), the stability of the coupled
mode will reduce to levels that could cause concern for ﬂight through turbulence. To
alleviate this problem, it is a fairly common practice to introduce notch ﬁlters into
the SCAS that reduce the feedback signals and response around the frequency of the
coupled fuselage/rotor modes. A similar problem arises through the coupling of the
roll mode with the regressing lag mode when the roll rate feedback gain is increased,
developing into a mode that typically has lower damping than the regressing ﬂap mode;

this problem has already been discussed in Chapter 3 (see Section 3.2.1 on lead–lag
dynamics) where the work of Curtiss was highlighted (Ref. 5.5). Figure 5.4, taken
from Ref. 5.5, shows Curtiss’s estimate of the stability boundary for rate and attitude
feedback control. The example helicopter in Ref. 5.5 has an articulated rotor, but the
level of attitude gain that drives the fuselage–ﬂap mode unstable is very similar to
Lynx, i.e., about 1◦/◦for zero rate gain. The level of stabilization through rate damping
before the fuselage–lag mode is driven unstable is even lower, according to Curtiss, at
0.2◦/◦s.
High-gain attitude control is therefore seen to present a problem for pilots and
SCAS designers. We can obtain some insight into the loss of damping in the roll/ﬂap
regressing mode through an approximate stability analysis of the coupled system at
the point of instability. We make the assumption that the ﬁrst-order representation of
multi-bladeﬂappingdynamicsisadequateforpredictingthebehaviouroftheregressing

Equations 5.11–5.13 represent a fourth-order coupled system and when the atti-
tude feedback law, given by eqn 5.10, is included, the order of the system increases
to 5. For high values of feedback gain we make the assumption that the coupled roll
regressing ﬂap mode and the roll subsidence mode in Fig. 5.3 deﬁne the high-modulus
system so that no further reduction is possible due to the similar modulus of the eigen-
values of these modes. This third-order system has a characteristic equation of the
form

(5.20)
For the Lynx, the value of attitude gain at the stability boundary is estimated to be
approximately 0.8◦/◦from eqn 5.20. The relatively high value of hub stiffness reduces
the allowable level of feedback gain, but conversely, the relatively high rotorspeed on
the Lynx serves to increase the usable range of feedback gain. On the Puma, with its
slower turning, articulated rotor with higher Lock number, the allowable gain range
increases to about 2◦/◦. Slow, stiff rotors would clearly be the most susceptible to the
destabilizing effect of roll attitude to lateral cyclic feedback gain.
Later, in Chapter 6, we shall discuss some of the handling qualities considerations
for attitude control. The potential for stability problems in high-gain tracking tasks
will be seen to be closely related to the shape of the attitude frequency response
at frequencies around the upper end of the range which pilots normally operate in
closed-loop tasks. The presence of the rotor and other higher order dynamic elements
introduces a lag between the pilot and the aircraft’s response to controls. The pilot
introduces an even further delay through neuro-muscular effects and the combination
of the two effects reduces the amplitude, and increases the slope of the phase, of the
attitude response at high frequency, both of which can lead to a deterioration in the

pilot’s perception of aircraft handling. Further discussion on the inﬂuence of SCAS
gains on rotor–fuselage stability can be found in Refs 5.7 and 5.8; Ref. 5.9 discusses
the same problem through the inﬂuence of the pilot modelled as a simple dynamic
system.
Now we turn to the second area of application of strong control and stability
under constraint, where the pilot or automatic controller is attempting to constrain the
ﬂight path, to ﬂy along virtual rails in the sky. We shall see that this is possible only
at considerable expense to the stability of the unconstrained modes, dominated in this
case by the aircraft attitudes.
5.2.2
Flight path constraint
Longitudinal motion
Consider helicopter ﬂight where the pilot is using the cyclic or collective to maintain
constant vertical velocity w0 = w −Ueθ. In the case of zero perturbation from trim,
so that the pilot holds a constant ﬂight path, we can write the constraint in the form
w = Ueθ
(5.21)
When the aircraft pitches, the ﬂight path therefore remains straight. We can imagine
control so strong that the dynamics in the heave axis is described by the simple algebraic
relation
Zuu + Zww ≈0
(5.22)
and the dynamics of surge motion is described by the differential equation
du
dt −Xuu + g
Ue
w = 0
(5.23)
In this constrained ﬂight, heave and surge velocity perturbations are related through
the ratio of heave derivatives; thus
w ≈−Zu

and the single unconstrained degree of surge freedom is described by the ﬁrst-order
system

(5.25)
The condition for speed stability can therefore be written in the form

(5.26)
For the Lynx, and most other helicopters, this condition is violated below about
60 knots as the changes in rotor thrust with forward speed perturbations become more
and more inﬂuenced by the strong changes in rotor inﬂow. Hence, whether the pilot

applies cyclic or collective to maintain a constant ﬂight path below approximately min-
imum power speed, there is a risk of the speed diverging unless controlled. In practice,
the pilot would normally use both cyclic and collective to maintain speed and ﬂight
path angle at low speed. At higher forward speeds, while the speed mode is never
well damped, it becomes stable and is dominated by the drag of the aircraft (derivative
Xu). At steep descent angles the control problems become more acute, as the vertical
response to both collective and cyclic reverses, i.e., the resulting change in ﬂight path
angle following an aft cyclic or up collective step is downward (Refs 5.10, 5.11).

pitch attitude modes of the aircraft, which also change character under vertical motion
constraint. Consider the feedback control between vertical velocity and longitudinal
cyclic pitch, given by the simple proportional control law
θ1s = kw0w0
(5.27)
Rearranging the longitudinal system matrix in eqn 4.138 to shift the heave (w0) variable
to the lowest level (i.e., highest modulus) leads to the modiﬁed system matrix, with
partitioning as shown, namely

For the Lynx at 40 knots, a gain of 0.35◦/(m/s) would be sufﬁcient to destabilize the

where we have used the additional approximations
Mθ1s ≫UeMw
(5.33)
Zθ1s ≈UeZw
(5.34)
In the form of eqn 5.32, the approximation is therefore able to estimate only the location
of the pitch mode at inﬁnite gain. The mode is predicted to be stable, with a damping
given by the pitch damping derivative and frequency by the pitch control sensitivity
derivative. The mode has the appearance of a pendulum mode, with the fuselage rocking
beneath the rotor, the latter remaining ﬁxed relative to the ﬂight path. An obvious
question that arises from the above analysis relates to how inﬂuential this mode is
likely to be on handling qualities and, hence, what the character of the mode is likely
to be at lower values of gain. Figure 5.5 shows the root loci for the 3 DoF longitudinal
modes of the Lynx at a 60 knots level ﬂight condition. The locus near the origin is
the eigenvalue of the speed mode already discussed, with the closed-loop zero at the
origin (neutral stability). The root moving out to the left on the real axis corresponds to
the strongly controlled vertical mode. The ﬁnite zero, characterizing the pitch mode,

Stability Under Constraint and Response Analysis
309
is shown located where approximate theory predicts, with a damping ratio of about
0.2. Of particular interest is the locus of this root as the feedback gain is increased,
showing how, for a substantial range of the locus (up to a gain of approximately unity),
the mode is driven increasingly unstable. This characteristic is likely to inhibit strong
control of the ﬂight path in the vertical plane far more than the loss of stability in the
speed mode.
The moderately high frequency of the pitch mode at high values of gain suggests
that there is the potential for coupling with the regressing ﬂap mode. Figure 5.6 illus-
trates the same root loci for the 9 DoF Lynx model; the lower level oscillatory root on
Fig. 5.6 represents the Dutch roll oscillation. The roll regressing mode is not shown
on the axes range, but is actually hardly affected by the control. What does happen is
that the pitch mode now becomes neutrally stable in the limit, with correspondingly
more signiﬁcant excursions into the unstable range at lower values of gain. Even when
the open-loop pole has been stabilized through pitch attitude and rate feedback, we
can expect the same general trend, with instability occurring at relatively low values
of gain. The physical source of the instability is the reduction in incidence stability
(Mw) resulting from the control of vertical velocity with cyclic pitch; a positive change

in incidence will indicate an increased rate of descent and will be counteracted by a
positive (aft) cyclic, hence reducing static stability. A more natural piloting strategy
is to use collective for ﬂight path control and cyclic for speed and attitude control. At
low to moderate speeds this strategy will always be preferred, and sufﬁcient collective
margin should be available to negate any pilot concerns not to over-torque the ro-
tor/engine/transmission. At higher speeds however, when the power margins are much
smaller, and the ﬂight path response to cyclic is stronger, direct control of ﬂight path
with cyclic is more instinctive. The results shown in Figs 5.5 and 5.6 suggest a poten-
tial conﬂict between attitude control and ﬂight path control in these conditions. If the
pilot tightens up the ﬂight path control (e.g., air-to-air refuelling or target tracking),
then a PIO might develop. We have already seen evidence of PIOs from the analysis
of strong attitude control in the last section. Both effects are ultimately caused by the
loose coupling between rotor and fuselage and are inherently more signiﬁcant with
helicopters than with ﬁxed-wing aircraft. PIOs represent a limit to safe ﬂight for both
types of aircraft and criteria are needed to ensure that designs are not PIO prone. This
issue will be addressed further in Chapter 6.
Theexamplesdiscussedabovehavehighlightedaconﬂictbetweenattitudecontrol
(or stability) and ﬂight path control (or guidance) for the helicopter pilot. This conﬂict
is most vividly demonstrated by an analysis of constrained ﬂight in the horizontal plane
(Ref. 5.12).
Lateral motion
We consider a simple model of a helicopter being ﬂown along a prescribed ﬂight path
in two-dimensional, horizontal ﬂight (Fig. 5.7). The key points can be made with the
most elementary simulation of the helicopter ﬂight dynamics (i.e., quasi-steady rotor
dynamics). It is assumed that the pilot is maintaining height and balance with collective
and pedals, respectively. The equation for the rolling motion is given in terms of the
lateral ﬂapping β1s:
Ixx ¨φ = −Mβ β1s

where Mβ is the rolling moment per unit ﬂapping given by

(5.36)
The rotor thrust T varies during the manoeuvre to maintain horizontal ﬂight. As de-
scribed in Chapter 3, the hub stiffness Kβ can be written in terms of the ﬂap frequency

(5.39)
where y(t) is the lateral ﬂight path displacement. Combining eqns 5.35, 5.38 and 5.39,
and assuming small roll and lateral ﬂapping angles (including constant rotor thrust),
we obtain the second-order equation for the roll angle φ

The reader should note that the assumption of constant frequency ωφ implies that
the thrust changes are small compared with the hub component of the rotor moment.
The frequency ωφ is equal to the natural frequency of the roll-regressive ﬂap mode
discussed in Chapters 2 and 4.
Equation 5.40 holds for general small amplitude lateral manoeuvres and can be
used to estimate the rotor forces and moments, hence control activity, required to ﬂy a
manoeuvre characterized by the lateral ﬂight path y(t). This represents a simple case
of so-called inverse simulation (Ref. 5.13), whereby the ﬂight path is prescribed and
the equations of motion solved for the loads and controls. A signiﬁcant difference
between rotary and ﬁxed-wing aircraft modelled in this way is that the inertia term

 
312
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
in eqn 5.40 vanishes for ﬁxed-wing aircraft, with the sideforce then being simply
proportional to the roll angle. For helicopters, the loose coupling between rotor and
fuselage leads to the presence of a mode, with dynamics described by eqn 5.40, with
frequency ωφ, representing an oscillation of the aircraft relative to the rotor, while the
rotor maintains the prescribed orientation in space. We have already seen evidence of
a similar mode in the previous analysis of constrained vertical motion. Oscillations of
the fuselage in this mode, therefore, have no effect on the ﬂight path of the aircraft. It
should be noted that this ‘mode’ is not a feature of unconstrained ﬂight, where the two
natural modes are a roll subsidence (magnitude L p) and a neutral mode (magnitude
0), representing the indifference of the aircraft dynamics to heading or lateral position.
The degree of excitation of the ‘new’ free mode depends upon the frequency content of
the ﬂight path excursions and hence the sideforce v. For example, when the prescribed
ﬂight paths are genuinely orthogonal to the free oscillation (i.e., combinations of sine
waves), then the response will be uncontaminated by the free oscillation. In practice,
slalom-typemanoeuvres,whilesimilarincharactertosinewaves,canhavesigniﬁcantly
different load requirements at the turning points, and the scope for excitation of the free
oscillation is potentially high. A further important point to note about the character of
the solution to eqn 5.40 is that as the frequency of the ﬂight path approaches the natural
frequency ωφ, the roll angle approaches a ‘resonance’ condition. To understand what
happens in practice, we must look at the equation for ‘forward’ rather than ‘inverse’
simulation. This can be written in terms of the lateral cyclic control input θ1c forcing
the ﬂight path sideforce v, in the approximate form

(5.44)
The derivation of this equation depends on the assumption that the rotor responds to
control action and fuselage angular rate in a quasi-steady manner, taking up a new
disc tilt instantaneously. In reality the rotor responds with a time constant equal to
(16/γ ), but for the purposes of the present argument this delay will be neglected. The
presence of the control acceleration term on the right-hand side of eqn 5.44 is crucial
to what happens close to the natural frequency. In the limit, when the input frequency
is at the natural frequency, the ﬂight path response is zero due to the cancelling of the
control terms, hence the implication of the theoretical artefact, in eqn 5.40, that the roll
angle would grow unbounded at that frequency. As the pilot moves his stick at the
critical frequency, the rotor disc remains horizontal and the fuselage wobbles beneath.
We found a similar effect for longitudinal motion. For cyclic control inputs at slightly
lower frequencies, the sideforces are still very small and large control displacements
are required to generate the turning moments. Stick movements at frequencies slightly
higher than ωφ produce small forces of the opposite sign, acting in the wrong direction.
Hence, despite intense stick activity the pilot may not be able to ﬂy the desired track.
The difference between what the pilot can do and what he is trying to do increases
sharply with the severity of the desired manoeuvre, and the upper limit of what can
usefully or safely be accomplished, in terms of task ‘bandwidth’, is determined by the
frequency ωφ. For current helicopters, the natural frequency ωφ varies from 6 rad/s
for low hinge offset, slowly rotating rotors, to 12 rad/s for hingeless rotors with higher
rotor speeds.

 
Stability Under Constraint and Response Analysis

Two questions arise out of the above simple analysis. First, as the severity of
the task increases, what inﬂuences the cut-off frequency beyond which control activity
becomes unreasonably high and hence can this cut-off frequency be predicted? Second,
how does the pilot cope with the unconstrained oscillations, if indeed they manifest
themselves in practice. A useful parameter in the context of the ﬁrst question is the ratio
of aircraft to task natural frequencies. The task natural frequency ωt can, in general,
be derived from a frequency analysis of the ﬂight path variation, but for simple slalom
manoeuvres the value is approximately related to the inverse of the task time. It is
suggested in Ref. 5.12 that a meaningful upper limit to task frequency can be written
in the form
ωϕ
ωt
> 2nν
(5.45)
where nv is the number of ﬂight path changes required in a given task. A two-sided
slalom, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 5.8, contains ﬁve such distinct changes; hence
at a minimum, for slalom manoeuvres
ωϕ
ωt
> 10
(5.46)
This suggests that a pilot ﬂying a reasonably agile aircraft, with ωφ = 10 rad/s, could
be expected to experience control problems when trying to ﬂy a two-sided slalom in
less than about 6 s. A pilot ﬂying a less agile aircraft (ωφ = 7 rad/s) might experience
similar control problems in a 9-s slalom. This 50% increase in usable performance for
an agile helicopter clearly has very important implications for military and some civil
operations.
Figures 5.9(a)–(c) show results from an inverse simulation of Helisim Lynx ﬁtted
with different rotor types ﬂying a slalom mission task element (Ref. 5.12). Three rotor
conﬁgurations are shown on the ﬁgures corresponding to ωφ = 11.8 (standard Lynx),
ωφ = 7.5 (articulated) and ωφ = 4.5 (teetering). The aspect ratio of the slalom, deﬁned
as the overall width to length, is 0.077, the maximum value achievable by the teetering
rotor conﬁguration before the lateral cyclic reaches the control limits; the ﬂight speed is
60 knots. Figures 5.9(a) and (b) show comparisons of the roll attitude and rate responses
respectively. The attitude changes, not surprisingly, are very similar for the three cases,

attitude; (b) roll rate; (c) lateral cyclic
as are the rates, although we can now perceive the presence of higher frequency motion
in the signal for the teetering and articulated rotors. For the teetering rotor, roll rate
peaks some 10 – 20% higher than required with the hingeless rotor can be observed
– entirely a result of the component of the free mode in the aircraft response. Figure
5.9(c) illustrates the lateral cyclic required to ﬂy the 0.077 slalom, the limiting aspect
ratio for the teetering conﬁguration. The extent of the excitation of the roll oscillation
for the different cases, and hence the higher frequency ‘stabilization’ control inputs, is
shown clearly in the time histories of lateral cyclic. The difference between the three
rotor conﬁgurations is now very striking. The Lynx, with its standard hingeless rotor,
requires 30% of maximum control throw, while the articulated rotor requires slightly
more at about 35%.
In Ref. 5.12, the above analysis is extended to examine pilot workload metrics
based on control activity. The premise is that the conﬂict between guidance and stabi-
lization is a primary source of workload for pilots as they attempt to ﬂy manoeuvres
beyond the critical aircraft/task bandwidth ratio. Both time and frequency domain
workload metrics are discussed in Ref. 5.12, and correlation between inverse simu-
lation and Lynx ﬂight test results is shown to be good; the limiting slalom for both
cases was about 0.11. This line of research to determine reliable workload metrics for

predicting critical ﬂying qualities boundaries is, in many ways, still quite formative,
and detailed coverage, in this book, of the current status of the various approaches is
therefore considered to be inappropriate.
The topic of stability under constraint is an important one in ﬂight dynamics,
and the examples described in this section have illustrated how relatively simple anal-
ysis, made possible by certain sensible approximations, can sometimes expose the
physical nature of a stability boundary. This appears fortuitous but there is actually a
deeper underlying reason why these simple models work so well in predicting prob-
lems. Generally, the pilot will ﬂy a helicopter using a broad range of control inputs, in
terms of both frequency and amplitude, to accomplish a task, often adopting a control
strategy that appears unnecessarily complex. There is some evidence that this strat-
egy is important for the pilot to maintain a required level of attention to the ﬂying
task, and hence, paradoxically, plentiful spare capacity for coping with emergencies.
Continuous exercise of a wide repertoire of control strategies is therefore a sign of a
healthy situation with the pilot adopting low to moderate levels of workload to stay
in command. A pilot experiencing stability problems, particularly those that are self-
induced, will typically concentrate more and more of his or her effort in a narrow
frequency range as he or she becomes locked into what is effectively a man–machine
limit cycle. Again paradoxically, these very structured patterns of activity in pilot con-
trol activity are usually a sign that handling qualities are deteriorating and workload is
increasing.

Analysis of Response to Controls
5.3.1
General
Previous sections have focused on trim and stability analysis. The analysis of ﬂight
behaviour following control or disturbance inputs is characterized under the general
heading ‘Response’, and is the last topic of this series of modelling sections. Along
with the trim and stability analysis, response forms a bridge between the model build-
ing activities in Chapter 3 and the ﬂying qualities analysis of Chapters 6 and 7. In
the following sections, results will be presented from so-called system identiﬁcation
techniques, and readers unfamiliar with these methods are strongly encouraged to de-
vote some time to familiarizing themselves with the different tools (Ref. 5.14). Making
sense of helicopter dynamic ﬂight test data in the validation context requires a com-
bination of experience (e.g., knowing what to expect) and analysis tools that help
to isolate cause and effect, and hence provide understanding. System identiﬁcation
methods provide a rational and systematic approach to this process of gaining better
understanding.
Before proceeding with a study of four different response topics, we need to recall
the basic equations for helicopter response, given in earlier chapters and Appendix
4A. The nonlinear equations for the motion of the fuselage, rotor and other dynamic
elements, combined into the state vector x(t), in terms of the applied controls u(t) and
disturbances f(t), can be written as
dx

with solution as a function of time given by
x(t) = x(0) +
t
0
F(x(τ), u(τ), f(τ); τ) dτ
(5.48)
In a forward simulation, eqn 5.48 is solved numerically by prescribing the form of
the evolution of F(t) over each time interval and integrating. For small enough time
intervals, a linear or low-order polynomial form for F(t) generally gives rapid conver-
gence. Alternatively, a process of prediction and correction can be devised by iterating
on the solution at each time step. The selection of which technique to use will usually
not be critical. Exceptions occur for systems with particular characteristics (Ref. 5.15),
leading to premature numerical instabilities, largely determined by the distribution of
eigenvalues; inclusion of rotor and other higher order dynamic modes in eqn 5.47 can
sometimes lead to such problems and care needs to be taken to establish a sufﬁciently
robust integration method, particularly for real-time simulation, when a constraint will
be to achieve the maximum integration cycle time. We will not dwell on these clearly
important issues here, but refer the reader to any one of the numerous texts on numerical
analysis.
The solution of the linearized form of eqn 5.47 can be written in either of two
forms (see Appendix 4A)

where the principal matrix solution Y(t) is given by

(5.51)
W is the matrix of right-hand eigenvectors of the system matrix A, VT = W−1 is
the matrix of eigenvectors of AT, and λi are the corresponding eigenvalues; B is
the control matrix. The utility of the linearized response solutions depends on the
degree of nonlinearity and the input and response amplitude. In general terms, the
linear formulation is considerably more amenable to analysis, and we shall regularly
use linear approximations in the following sections to gain improved understanding.
In particular, the ability to estimate trends through closed-form analytic solutions,
exploited fully in the analysis of stability, highlights the power of linear analysis and,
unless a nonlinearity is obviously playing a signiﬁcant role, equivalent linear systems
analysis is always preferred in the ﬁrst instance.
It is inevitable that the following treatment has to be selective; we shall examine
response characteristics in different axes individually, concerning ourselves chieﬂy
with direct response to controls. In several cases, comparisons between ﬂight and He-
lisim simulation are shown and reference is made to the AGARD Working Group 18

5.3.2
Heave response to collective control inputs
Response to collective in hover
In this ﬁrst example, we examine in some detail the apparently straightforward case
of a helicopter’s vertical response to collective in hover. In both Chapters 2 and 4 we
have already discussed the quasi-steady approximation for helicopter vertical motion
given by the ﬁrst-order equation in vertical velocity
˙w −Zww = Zθ0 θ0
(5.52)
where the heave damping and control sensitivity derivatives are given from momentum
theory in terms of the blade loading Ma/Ab, tip speed  and hover-induced velocity
λ0 (or thrust coefﬁcient CT ), by the expressions (see Chapter 4)
Zw = −2a0 Abρ(R)λ0

(5.53)
Zθ0 = −8

(5.54)
A comparison of the vertical acceleration response to a collective step input derived
from eqn 5.52 with ﬂight measurements on the DRA research Puma is shown in Fig.
5.10. It can be seen that the quasi-steady model fails to capture some of the detail
in the response shape in the short term, although the longer term decay is reason-
ably well predicted. For low-frequency collective inputs, the quasi-steady model is
expected to give fairly high ﬁdelity for handling qualities evaluations, but at moderate
to high frequencies, the ﬁdelity will be degraded. In particular, the transient thrust
peaks observed in response to sharp collective inputs will be smoothed over. The sig-
niﬁcance of this effect was ﬁrst examined in detail by Carpenter and Fridovitch in the

acceleration response to a step collective pitch input for Puma in hover (Ref. 5.16)

early 1950s, in the context of the performance characteristics of rotorcraft during jump
take-offs (Ref. 5.17). Measurements were made of rotor thrust following the application
of sharp and large collective inputs and compared with results predicted by a dynamic
rotor coning/inﬂow nonlinear simulation model. The thrust changes T were modelled
by momentum theory, extended to include the unsteady effects on an apparent mass of
air mam, deﬁned by the circumscribed sphere of the rotor.

In eqn 5.55 we have added the effect of aircraft vertical motion w, not included in
the test stand constraints in Ref. 5.17; vi is the induced velocity and β the blade
ﬂapping. Thrust overshoots of nearly 100% were measured and fairly well predicted
by this relatively simple theory, with the inﬂow build-up, as simulated by eqn 5.55,
accounting for a signiﬁcant proportion of this effect. A rational basis for this form of
inﬂow modelling and the associated azimuthal non-uniformities ﬁrst appeared in the
literature in the early 1970s, largely in the context of the prediction of hub moments
(Ref. 5.18), and later with the seminal work of Pitt and Peters in Ref. 5.19. The research
work on dynamic inﬂow by Pitt and Peters, and the further developments by Peters
and his co-workers, has already received attention in Chapters 3 and 4 of this book.
Here we observe that Ref. 5.19 simulated the rotor loading with a linear combination
of polynomial functions that satisﬁed the rotor blade tip boundary conditions and also
satisﬁed the underlying unsteady potential ﬂow equation. The Carpenter–Fridovitch
apparent mass approximation was validated by Ref. 5.19, but a ‘corrected’ and reduced
value was proposed as an alternative that better matched the loading conditions inboard
on the rotor.
Based on the work of Refs 5.17 and 5.19, an extensive analysis of the ﬂight
dynamics of helicopter vertical motion in hover, including the effects of aircraft motion,
rotor ﬂapping and inﬂow, was conducted by Chen and Hindson and reported in Ref.
5.20. Using a linearized form of eqn 5.55 in the form

Chen and Hindson predicted the behaviour of the integrated 3 DoF system and pre-
sented comparisons with ﬂight test data measured on a CH-47 helicopter. The large
transient thrust overshoots were conﬁrmed and shown to be strong functions of rotor
trim conditions and Lock number. The theory in Ref. 5.20 was developed in the con-
text of evaluating the effects of rotor dynamics on the performance of high-gain digital
ﬂight control, where dynamic behaviour over a relatively wide frequency range would
potentially affect the performance of the control system. One of the observations in
Ref. 5.20 was related to the very short-term effect of blade ﬂapping on the fuselage
response. Physically, as the lift develops on a rotor blade, the inertial reaction at the hub
depends critically on the mass distribution relative to the aerodynamic centre. For the
case where the inertial reaction at the hub is downward for an increased lift, the aircraft

normal acceleration to collective pitch transfer function will exhibit a so-called non-
minimum phase characteristic; although the eventual response is in the same direction
as the input, the initial response is in the opposite direction. One of the consequences
of very-high-gain feedback control with such systems is instability. In practice, the
gain level necessary to cause concern from this effect is likely to be well outside the
range required for control of helicopter vertical motion.
An extensive comparison of the behaviour of the Chen–Hindson model with
ﬂight test data was conducted by Houston on the RAE research Puma in the late
1980s and reported in Refs 5.16, 5.21–5.23, and we continue this case study with
an exposition of Houston’s research ﬁndings. They demonstrate the utility of applied

The expressions for the Z derivatives indicate that the resultant values are determined
by the difference between two inertial effects of similar magnitude. Accurate estimates
of the mass moments are therefore required to obtain ﬁdelity in the heave DoF. In
Houston’s analysis the rotorspeed was assumed to be constant, a valid approximation
for short-term response modelling. In Ref. 5.24, results are reported that include the
effects of rotorspeed indicating that this variable can be prescribed in the above 3 DoF
model with little loss of accuracy.
Flight tests were conducted on the Puma to measure the vertical motion and rotor
coning in response to a collective frequency sweep. Figure 5.11 shows a sample of the
test data with collective lever, rotor coning angle (derived from multi-blade coordinate
analysis)andnormalaccelerationattheaircraftcentreofmass(Ref.5.21).Thetestinput
was applied over a wide frequency range from less than 0.1 Hz out to 3.5 Hz. The test
data were converted to the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform techniques
for transfer function modelling. Figure 5.12 shows an example of the magnitude,
phase and coherence of the acceleration and coning response along with the ﬁtted 3
DoF model, derived from a least-squares ﬁt of magnitude and phase. The coherence
function indicates strong linearity up to about 2 Hz with some degradation up to about
3 Hz, above which the coherence collapses. The increasing response magnitude in
both heave and coning DoFs is a characteristic of the effects of inﬂow dynamics. The
identiﬁed model parameters and modal stability characteristics are shown in Table 5.2,
compared with the theoretical predictions for the Puma using the derivative expressions
in eqns 5.59–5.62. The percentage spread gives the range of values estimated from six
different sets of test data.
Key observations from the comparisons in Table 5.2 are that theory predicts the
inﬂow derivatives reasonably accurately but overestimates the coning derivatives by
over 30%; the heave derivatives are typically of opposite sign and the predicted stability

Fig. 5.12 Comparison of equivalent system ﬁt and ﬂight measurements of Puma frequency
response to collective in hover (Ref. 5.16): (a) vertical acceleration; (b) multiblade coning
is considerably greater than that estimated from ﬂight. In an attempt to reconcile these
differences, Houston examined the effects of a range of gross model ‘corrections’
based on physical reasoning of both aerodynamic and structural effects, but effectively
distorting the derivatives in eqns 5.59–5.62. Close examination of Houston’s analysis
shows that two of the correction factors effectively compensated for each other, hence
resulting in somewhat arbitrary ﬁnal values. We can proceed along similar lines by
noting that each of the derivative groups – inﬂow, coning and heave – have similar errors
in the theoretical predictions, suggesting that improved theoretical predictions may be
obtained for each group separately. Considering the inﬂow derivatives, we can see that
the inﬂow/collective derivative is predicted to within 2% of the ﬂight estimate. This
gives conﬁdence in the Carpenter–Fridovitch value of the apparent mass coefﬁcient
C0. The other key parameter in eqn 5.59 is the hover value of rotor inﬂow. An empirical
correction factor of 0.7 applied to this value, together with a 2% reduction in C0, leads
to the modiﬁed theoretical estimates given in Table 5.2, now all within 10% of the
ﬂight values. The coning derivatives are a strong function of blade Lock number as
shown in eqn 5.60; a 30% reduction in blade Lock number from 9.37 to 6.56, brings

the coning derivatives all within 5% of the ﬂight values, again shown in Table 5.2.
The heave derivatives are strongly dependent on the inertia distribution of the rotor
blade as already discussed. We can see from eqn 5.61 that the heave due to coning
is proportional to the ﬁrst mass moment Mβ. Using this simple relation to estimate a
corrected value for Mβ, a 30% reduction from 300 to 200 kg m2 is obtained. The revised
values for the heave derivatives are now much closer to the ﬂight estimates as shown
in Table 5.2, with the heave damping within 15% and control sensitivity within 4%.
The application of model parameter distortion techniques in validation studies gives an
indication of the extent of the model deﬁciencies. The modiﬁed rotor parameters can
be understood qualitatively in terms of several missing effects – non-uniform inﬂow,
tip and root losses, blade elasticity and unsteady aerodynamics, and also inaccuracies
in the estimates of blade structural parameters. For the present example, the correction
consistency across the full set of parameters is a good indication that the modiﬁcations
are physically meaningful.
The example does highlight potential problems with parameter identiﬁcation
when measurements are deﬁcient; in the present case, no inﬂow measurements were
available and the coherence of the frequency response functions was seen to decrease
sharply above about 3 Hz, which is where the coning mode natural frequency occurs
(see Table 5.2). The test data are barely adequate to cover the frequency range of interest
in the deﬁned model structure and it is remarkable how well the coning mode charac-
teristics are estimated. In the time domain, the estimated 3 DoF model is now able to
reﬂect much of the detail missed by the quasi-steady model. Figure 5.13 illustrates a
comparison of time responses of coning and normal acceleration following a 1◦step
in collective pitch. The longer term mismatch, appearing after about 5 s, is possibly
due to the effects of unmodelled rotorspeed changes. In the short term, the transient
ﬂapping and acceleration overshoots are perfectly captured. The signiﬁcance of these

higher order modelling effects has been conﬁrmed more recently in a validation study
of the Ames Genhel simulation model with ﬂight test data from a UH-60 helicopter in
hovering ﬂight (Ref. 5.25).
The RAE research reported by Houston was motivated by the need for robust
criteria for vertical axis handling qualities. At that time, the international effort to
develop new handling qualities standards included several contending options. In the
event, a simple model structure was adopted for the low-frequency control strategies
required in gross bob-up type manoeuvres. This topic is discussed in more detail in
Section 6.5. For high-gain feedback control studies however, a 3 DoF model should
be used to address the design constraints associated, for example, with very precise
height keeping.
Response to collective in forward ﬂight
The response to collective in forward ﬂight is considerably more complicated than in
hover. While collective pitch remains the principal control for vertical velocity and
ﬂight path angle up to moderate forward speed, pilots normally use a combination of
collective and cyclic to achieve transient ﬂight path changes in high-speed ﬂight. Also,
collective pitch induces powerful pitch and roll moments in forward ﬂight. Figure 5.14

compares the longitudinal response of the Helisim Bo105 to collective steps in hover,
at 60 and 120 knots. Comparisons are made between perturbations in forward velocity
u, heave velocity w, pitch rate q and height h. We draw particular attention to the
comparison of the w-velocity component and the relationship with climb rate. In hover,
the aircraft reaches its steady rate of climb of about 4 m/s (750 ft/min) in about 5 s. At
120 knots the heave velocity component is initially negative, but almost immediately
reverses and increases to about 7 m/s in only 3 s. The height response shows that the
aircraft has achieved a climb rate of 20 m/s (approx. 3800 ft/min) after about 4 s. The
powerful pitching moment generated by the collective input (Mθ0), together with the
pitch instability (Mw), has caused the aircraft to zoom climb, achieving a pitch rate of
about 10◦/s after only 2 s. Thus, the aircraft climbs while the heave velocity (climb rate,
V θ)increasespositively.Thepitchingresponseduetocollectiveiswellpredictedbyour

purpose test input with a wide frequency range and good return to trim properties.
Figure 5.15 compares the pitch and roll response to the collective disturbance. Roll
response is less well predicted than pitch, with the simulated amplitude only 50%
of the ﬂight measurement, although the trends are correct. The roll response will be
largely affected by the change in main rotor incidence in the longitudinal plane, caused
by elastic coning, pitch rate and non-uniform inﬂow effects; the Helisim rigid blade
approximation will not, of course, simulate the curvature of the blade.
5.3.3
Pitch and roll response to cyclic pitch control inputs
In Chapter 2 we discussed the mechanism of cyclic pitch, cyclic ﬂapping and the re-
sulting hub moments generated by the tilt of the rotor disc. In Chapters 3 and 4, the
aeromechanics associated with cyclic ﬂapping was modelled in detail. In this section,
we build on this extensive groundwork and examine features of the attitude response to
cyclic pitch, chieﬂy with the Helisim Bo105 as a reference conﬁguration. Simulated re-
sponses have been computed using the full nonlinear version of Helisim with the control
inputs at the rotor (θ1s and θ1c), and are presented in this form, unless otherwise stated.
Response to step inputs in hover – general features

Fig. 5.16 Pitch and roll response to 1◦cyclic pitch steps in hover
for both pitch and roll – in the present case about 12◦/s per deg of cyclic. However, while
the hub moments and rate sensitivities (i.e., the steady-state rate response per degree of
cyclic) are similar, the control sensitivities and dampings are scaled by the respective
inertias (pitch moment of inertia is more than three times the roll moment of inertia).
Thus the maximum roll rate response is achieved in about one-third the time it takes for
the maximum pitch rate to be reached. The short-term cross-coupled responses (q and
p) exhibit similar features, with about 40% of the corresponding direct rates (p and
q) reached less than 1 s into the manoeuvre. The accompanying sketches in Fig. 5.17
illustrate the various inﬂuences on the helicopter in the ﬁrst few seconds of response
from the hover condition. The initial snatch acceleration is followed by a rapid growth
to maximum rate when the control moment and damping moment effectively balance.
The cross-coupled control moments are reinforced by the coupled damping moments in
the same time frame. As the aircraft accelerates translationally, the restoring moments
due to surge and sway velocities come into play. However, these effects are counteracted
by cross-coupled moments due to the development of non-uniform induced velocities
normal to the rotor disc (λ1s and λ1c). After only 3–4 s, the aircraft has rolled to nearly
30◦following either pitch or roll control inputs, albeit in opposite directions. Transient
motion from the hover is dominated by the main rotor dynamics and aerodynamics.
In the very short time scale (<1 s), the attitude response is strongly inﬂuenced by the
rotor ﬂapping dynamics and we need to examine this effect in more detail.

Effects of rotor dynamics
The rotor theory of Chapter 3 described three forms of the multi-blade coordinate
representation of blade ﬂap motion – quasi-steady, ﬁrst-and second order. Figure 5.18
compares the short-term response with the three different rotor models to a step lateral
cyclic input in hover. The responses of all three models become indistinguishable
after about 1 s, but the presence of the rotor regressing ﬂap mode (Bo105 frequency
approximately 13 rad/s – see Chapter 4) is most noticeable in the roll rate response
in the ﬁrst quarter of a second, giving rise to a 20% overshoot compared with the
deadbeat response of the quasi-steady model. The large-scale inset ﬁgure shows the
comparison over the ﬁrst 0.1 s, highlighting the higher order dynamic effects, including
the very fast dynamics of the advancing ﬂap mode in the second-order representation.
With rotor dynamics included, the maximum angular acceleration (hence hub moment)
occurs after about 50 ms, or after about 120◦rotor revolution for the Bo105. The quasi-
steady approximation, which predicts the maximum hub moment at t = 0, is therefore
valid only for low-frequency dynamics (below about 10 rad/s). We have already seen
earlier in this chapter how rotor dynamics have a profound effect on the stability of
the rotor/fuselage modes under the inﬂuence of strong attitude control. This is a direct
result of the effective time delay caused by the rotor transient shown in Fig. 5.18.
Unless otherwise stated, the examples shown in this section have been derived using
the ﬁrst-order rotor ﬂap approximation.
Step responses in hover – effect of key rotor parameters
Two of the fundamental rotor parameters affecting helicopter angular motion are the
effective ﬂap stiffness, reﬂected in the ﬂap frequency ratio λβ, and the rotor Lock

The effects of these parameters on helicopter stability have already been discussed
in Chapter 4, and in Chapter 2 we brieﬂy examined the effects on dynamic response.
Figures 5.19 and 5.20 compare responses to step lateral cyclic inputs for the Bo105
in hover with varying λβ and γ respectively, across ranges of values found in current
operational helicopters. The effect of rotor ﬂapping stiffness is felt primarily in the
short term. The initial angular acceleration decreases and the time to reach maximum
roll rate increases as the hub stiffness is reduced. On the other hand, the rate sensitivity

 
Stability Under Constraint and Response Analysis
329
Fig. 5.19 Response characteristics with varying rotor ﬂap stiffness (γ = 5.09)
is practically the same for all three rotors. It is also apparent that the inﬂuence of
the regressing ﬂap mode on the short-term response is reduced as the rotor stiffness
decreases. To achieve an equivalent attitude response for the standard Bo105 in the
ﬁrst second with the two softer rotors would require larger inputs with more complex
shapes. The stiffer rotor can be described as giving a more agile response requiring
a simpler control strategy, a point already highlighted in Section 5.2.2. One of the
negative aspects of rotor stiffness is the much stronger cross-coupling, also observed
in Fig. 5.19. The strong effects of control and rate coupling (see derivatives Mθ1c
and Mp in Chapter 4) can be seen in the pitch response of the standard Bo105 rotor
conﬁguration. The ratio of pitch attitude excursions for the three rotors after only 2 s is
7:4:1. Cross-coupling must be compensated for by the pilot, a task that clearly adds to
the workload. We shall examine another negative aspect of stiff rotors later, degraded
pitch stability. As always, the optimum rotor stiffness will depend on the application,
but with active ﬂight control augmentation most of the negative effects of stiffer rotors
can be virtually eliminated.
The selection of rotor Lock number is also application dependent, and the results
in Fig. 5.20 illustrate the principal effects in the hover; in the cases shown, the Lock
number was varied by changing the rotor blade inertia with compensating changes to
rotor stiffness (Kβ in eqn 5.65) to maintain constant λβ. Roll control sensitivity (i.e.,
initial acceleration) is unaffected by Lock number, i.e., all three rotors ﬂap by the same
amount following the application of cyclic (actually the same happens for the three

 
330
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling

rotors of different stiffness, but in those cases the hub moments are also scaled by the
stiffness). The major effect of Lock number is to change the rate sensitivity, the lighter
blades associated with the higher values of γ resulting in lower values of gyroscopic
damping retarding the hub control moment. The lower damping also increases the
attitude response time constant as shown. Lock number also has a signiﬁcant effect on
cross-coupling as illustrated by the pitch response in Fig. 5.20.
Response variations with forward speed
One of the characteristics of helicopters is the widely varying response characteristics
as a function of forward speed. Since aircraft attitude essentially deﬁnes the direction
of the rotor thrust, ﬂight path control effectiveness also varies with speed. This adds to
pilotworkloadespeciallyduringmanoeuvresinvolvinglargespeedchanges.Wechoose
the attitude response to longitudinal cyclic to illustrate the various effects. Figure 5.21
compares the pitch and roll rate response to a step cyclic input from three different
trimmed ﬂight conditions – hover, 60 and 120 knots. We have already discussed the
features of the step response from hover. At 60 knots, the pitch response is almost pure
rate, sustained for more than 3 s. At 120 knots, the pitch rate continues to increase
after the initial transient due to the control input. This continued pitch-up is essentially
caused by the strongly positive pitching moment with incidence (Mw) on the Bo105.
The pitch motion eventually subsides as the speed decreases under the inﬂuence of
the very high nose-up pitch attitude in this zoom climb manoeuvre. The coupled roll

response has developed a new character at the high-speed condition, where the yaw
response of the aircraft begins to have a stronger inﬂuence. The rotor torque decreases
as the aircraft pitches up giving rise to a nose left sideslip, exposing the rotor to a
powerful dihedral effect rolling the aircraft to port, and initiating the transient motion
in the Dutch roll mode. Clearly, the pilot cannot ﬂy by cyclic alone.
Stability versus agility – contribution of the horizontal tailplane
We have already seen in Figs 5.18 and 5.19 how effective the hingeless rotor can be in
rollingtheaircraftrapidly.Thishighlevelofcontrollabilityalsoappliestothepitchaxis,
although the accelerations are scaled down by the higher moment of inertia. Hingeless
rotor helicopters are often described as agile because of their crisp attitude response
characteristics. In Chapter 4 this point was emphasized by the relative magnitude
of the control and damping derivatives of helicopters with different ﬂap retention
systems. We also examined stability in Chapter 4 and noted the signiﬁcant decrease
in longitudinal stability for hingeless rotor helicopters because of the positive pitch
moment with incidence. For hingeless rotor helicopters, stability and agility clearly
conﬂict. One of the natural ways of augmenting longitudinal stability is by increasing
the tailplane effectiveness, normally achieved through an increase in tail area. The
effects of tailplane size on agility and stability are illustrated by the results in Fig. 5.22
and Table 5.3. Three cases are compared, ﬁrst with the tailplane removed altogether,
second with the nominal Bo105 tail size of about 1% of the rotor disc area and third
with the tail area increased threefold. The time responses shown in Fig. 5.22 are the
fuselage pitch rate and vertical displacement following a step input of about 1◦in
longitudinal cyclic from straight and level trimmed ﬂight at 120 knots. In Table 5.3
the principal aerodynamic pitching moment derivatives and eigenvalues of short-term
pitch modes for the three conﬁgurations are compared. The pitch damping varies by
about 10–20% from the standard Bo105 while the static stability changes by several
hundred per cent.
If we measure agility in terms of the height of obstacle that can be cleared in a
given time, the no-tailplane case is considerably more agile. This conﬁguration is also
very unstable, however, with a time-to-double amplitude of less than 1 s. Although not

 
332
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Fig. 5.22 Contribution of the horizontal stabilizer to stability and agility (V = 120 knots)
shown in Fig. 5.22, in clearing a 50-m obstacle, the tailless aircraft has decelerated
almost to the hover and rolled over by about 60◦only 4 s into the manoeuvre. Pilot
control activity to compensate for these transients would be extensive. At the other
extreme, the large tail aircraft is stable with a crisp pitch rate response, but only
manages to pop up by about 10 m in the same time. To achieve the same ﬂight path
(height) change as that of the tailless aircraft would require a control input about four
times as large; put simply, the price of increased stability is less agility, the tailplane
introducing a powerful stabilizing stiffness (Mw) and damping (Mq). One way to
circumvent this dichotomy is to use a moving tailplane, providing stability against
atmospheric disturbances and agility in response to pilot control inputs.
Comparison with ﬂight
In the preceding subsections, we have seen some of the characteristics of the pre-
dicted Helisim behaviour in response to cyclic control. We complete the section with
a discussion on correlation with ﬂight test data. Figures 5.23 and 5.24 show a com-
parison of simulation and ﬂight test for the Bo105 aircraft disturbed from a 80-knot
trim condition. The pilot inputs are 3211 multi-steps at the lateral stick (Fig. 5.23)
and longitudinal stick (Fig. 5.24); in the ﬁgures these control inputs have been trans-
formed to the swash plate cyclics derived from sensors on the blade pitch bearings.
The cyclic control signals contain harmonic components characteristic of combining

together individual blade angles into multi-blade form, when each blade has a slightly
different mean position. The magnitude of the control inputs at the rotor is about 1◦in
the direct axis and about 0.3◦in the coupling axis, giving an indication of the swash
plate phasing on the Bo105. The comparison of the direct, or on-axis, response is
good, with amplitudes somewhat overestimated by simulation. The coupled, or off-
axis, response comparisons are much poorer. The swash plate phasing appears to work
almost perfectly in cancelling the coupled response in simulation, while the ﬂight data
show an appreciable coupling, particularly roll in the longitudinal manoeuvre, a con-
sequence of the low ratio of roll to pitch aircraft moments of inertia. This deﬁciency
of the Level 1 model to capture pitch–roll and roll–pitch cross-coupling appears to be
a common feature of current modelling standards and has been attributed to the ab-
sence of various rotor modelling sources including a proper representation of dynamic
inﬂow, unsteady aero-dynamics (changing the effective control phasing) and torsional
dynamics. Whatever the explanation, and it may well be different in different cases, it
does seem that cross-couplings are sensitive to a large number of small effects, e.g.,
5◦of swash plate phasing can lead to a roll acceleration as much as 40% of the pitch
acceleration following a step longitudinal cyclic input.

Another topic that has received attention in recent years concerns the adequacy of
low-order models in ﬂight dynamics. In Ref. 5.7, Tischler is concerned chieﬂy with the
modelling requirements for designing and analysing the behaviour of automatic ﬂight
control systems with high-bandwidth performance. Tischler used the DLR’s AGARD
Bo105 test database to explore the ﬁdelity level of different model structures for the roll
attitude response (φ) to lateral cyclic stick (η1c). Parametric transfer function models
were identiﬁed from ﬂight data using the frequency sweep test data, covering the range
0.7–30 rad/s. Good ﬁdelity over a modelling frequency range of 2–18 rad/s was judged
to be required for performing control law design. The least-squares ﬁts of the baseline
seventh-order model and band-limited quasi-steady model are shown in Figs 5.25 and
5.26, respectively. The identiﬁed transfer function for the baseline model is given by
eqn 5.66, capturing the coupled roll/regressive ﬂap dynamics, the regressive lead–lag
dynamics, the Dutch roll mode, roll angle integration (0) and actuator dynamics, the
latter modelled as a simple time delay:

where the parentheses signify

The frequencies of the Dutch roll (2.75 rad/s) and roll/ﬂap regressing mode (13.7 rad/s)
compare well with the corresponding Helisim predictions of 2.64 rad/s and 13.1 rad/s,
respectively. A 23-ms actuator lag has also been identiﬁed from the ﬂight test data.
From Fig. 5.25 we can see that both the amplitude and phase of the frequency response
are captured well by the seventh-order baseline model.
The band-limited quasi-steady model shown in Fig. 5.26 is modelled by the much
simpler transfer function given in eqn 5.68:

magnitude; (b) phase
The response is now modelled by a simple exponential lag, characterized by the damp-
ing derivative L p, supplemented by a pure time delay to account for the unmodelled
lags. The frequency range for which this band-limited model is valid was established
by Tischler in Ref. 5.7 by identifying the frequency at which the least-squares ﬁt error
began to diverge. This occurred at a frequency of about 14 rad/s, above which the
estimated parameters became very sensitive to the selected frequency. This sensitivity
is usually an indication that the model structure is inappropriate. The estimated roll
damping in eqn 5.68 is 14.6/s, compared with the Helisim value of 13.7/s; a total delay
of over 80 ms now accounts for both actuation and rotor response. Tischler concludes
that the useful frequency range for such quasi-steady (roll and pitch response) mod-
els extends almost up to the regressing ﬂap mode. In his work with the AGARD test
database, Tischler has demonstrated the power and utility of frequency domain identi-
ﬁcation and transfer function modelling. Additional work supporting the conclusions
of Ref. 5.7 can be found in Refs 5.26 and 5.27.
One of the recurring issues regarding the modelling of roll and pitch response to
cyclic pitch concerns the need for inclusion of rotor DoFs. We have addressed this on

 
Stability Under Constraint and Response Analysis
337
many occasions throughout this book, and Tischler’s work shows clearly that the need
for rotor modelling depends critically on the application. This topic was the subject of
a theoretical review by Hanson in Ref. 5.28, who also discussed the merits of various
approximations to the higher order rotor effects and the importance of rotor dynamics
in system identiﬁcation. References 5.29 and 5.30 also report results of frequency
domain ﬁtting of ﬂight test data, in this case the pitch response of the DRA Puma to
longitudinal cyclic inputs. Once again, the inclusion of an effective time delay was
required to obtain sensible estimates of the 6 DoF model parameters – the stability and
control derivatives. Without any time delay in the model structure, Ref. 5.29 reports an
estimated value of Puma pitch damping (Mq) of −0.353, compared with the Helisim
prediction of −0.835. Including an effective time delay in the estimation process results
in an identiﬁed Mq of −0.823. This result is typical of many reported studies where
ﬂight estimates of key physical parameters appear to be unrealistic, simply because the
model structure is inappropriate.
An important modelling element omitted from the forward ﬂight Bo105 and Puma
results discussed above is the effect of non-uniform dynamic inﬂow. We have seen from
Chapters 3 and 4 that ‘unsteady’ momentum theory predicts the presence of powerful
non-uniform effects in response to the development of aerodynamic hub moments.
References 5.25, 5.31 and 5.32 report comparisons of predictions from blade element
rotor models with the NASA UH-60 hover test database (Ref. 5.25), where the inﬂow
effects are predicted to be strongest. The results from all three references are in close
agreement. Figure 5.27, from Ref. 5.32, illustrates a comparison between ﬂight and the

FLIGHTLAB simulation model of the response to a 1-inch step input in lateral cyclic
from hover. Dynamic inﬂow is seen to reduce the peak roll rate response in the ﬁrst
half second by about 25%. The inﬂow effects do not appear, however, to improve the
cross-coupling predictions.
5.3.4
Yaw/roll response to pedal control inputs
In this section we examine the characteristics of the coupled yaw/roll response to pedal
control inputs in forward ﬂight; attention will be focused on comparison with test
data from the DRA Puma helicopter. Yaw/roll motions are coupled through a variety
of different physical mechanisms. Even at the hover, any vertical offset of the tail
rotor from the aircraft centre of gravity will give rise to a rolling moment from tail
rotor collective. As forward speed increases, the forces and moments reﬂected in the
various coupled stability derivatives, e.g., dihedral Lv, adverse yaw Np, combine to
form the character of the Dutch roll mode discussed in Chapter 4. Figure 5.28, taken
from Ref. 5.33, illustrates the comparison of yaw, roll and sideslip responses from
ﬂight and Helisim following a 3211 multi-step pedal control input. It can be seen
that the simulation overpredicts the initial response in all 3 DoFs and also appears
to overpredict the damping and period of the free oscillation in the longer term. In
Chapter 4 we examined approximations to this mode, concluding that for both the
Puma and Bo105, a 3 DoF yaw/roll/sideslip model was necessary but that, provided
the sideways motion was small compared with sideslip, a second-order approximation
was adequate; with this approximation, the stability is then characterized by the roots
of the equation

If the ‘true’ values of the stability and control derivatives were known, then this kind
of approximation may be able to help to explain where the modelling deﬁciencies lie.
Estimates of the Puma derivatives derived by the DLR using the test data in Fig. 5.28
are shown in Table 5.4, along with Dutch roll eigenvalues for three different cases – the
fully coupled 6 DoF motion, lateral subset and the approximation given by eqn 5.69. It
can be seen that the latter accounts for about 80% of the damping and more than 90%
of the frequency for the ﬂight results (compare λ(1) with λ(3)) and therefore serves as a
representative model of Dutch roll motion; note that theory overpredicts the damping
by more than 60% and underpredicts the frequency by 20%.

Figure 5.29 shows a comparison between ﬂight measurements and the 3 DoF
second-order approximation using the ﬂight-estimated derivatives in Table 5.4. The
comparison is noticeably better in the short term, but the damping appears now to be
slightly underpredicted, consistent with the comparison already noted between λ(1)
with λ(3). Looking more closely at the derivatives in Table 5.4, we see that the most
striking mismatch between ﬂight and theory is the overprediction of the yaw damping
and control sensitivity by about 70% and the underprediction of the roll damping and
dihedral effects by 30 and 20%, respectively. The Helisim prediction of adverse yaw

Np is less than half the value estimated from the ﬂight data. A simple adjustment to
the yaw and roll moments of inertia, albeit by a signiﬁcant amount, would bring the
theoretical predictions of damping and control sensitivity much closer to the ﬂight
estimates. Similarly, the product of inertia Ixz has a direct effect on the adverse yaw.
Moments of inertia are notoriously difﬁcult to estimate and even more difﬁcult to
measure (particularly roll and yaw), and errors in the values used in the simulation
model of as much as 30% are possible. However, the larger discrepancies in the yaw
axis are unlikely to be due solely to incorrect conﬁguration data. The absence of
any interactional aerodynamics between the main rotor wake/fuselage/empennage and
tail rotor is likely to be the cause of some of the model deﬁciency. Typical effects
unmodelled in the Level 1 standard described in Chapter 3 include reductions in the
dynamic pressure in the rotor/fuselage wake at the empennage/tail rotor and sidewash
effects giving rise to effective ˙v acceleration derivatives (akin to M ˙w from the horizontal
tailplane).
The approximation for the Dutch roll damping given by eqn 5.70 can be further
reduced to expose effective damping derivatives in yaw and sideslip:

In both cases the additional effect due to rolling motion is destabilizing, with the
adverse yaw effect reducing the effective yaw damping by half. The adverse yaw is
almost entirely a result of the high value of the product of inertia Ixz, coupling the

roll damping into the yaw motion. The damping decrements due to rolling manifest
themselves as a moment (eqn 5.73) and a force (eqn 5.74) reinforcing the motion at
the effective centre of the oscillation. This interpretation is possible because of the
closely coupled nature of the motion. The yaw, roll and sideslip motions are locked in
a tight phase relationship in the Puma Dutch roll – sideslip leading yaw rate by 90◦
and roll rate lagging behind yaw rate by 180◦. Hence, as the aircraft nose swings to
starboard with a positive yaw rate, the aircraft is also rolling to port (induced by the
dihedral effect from the positive sideslip) thus generating an adverse yaw Np in the
same direction as the yaw rate.

The powerful effect of the damping decrement from adverse yaw can be even
more vividly illustrated with an example taken from Refs 5.34 and 5.35. Figure 5.30
presents a selection of Puma ﬂight results comparing the roll and yaw response in the
Dutch roll mode at 100 knots in descending, level and climbing ﬂight; the control input
is a pedal doublet in all three cases. It can be seen that the stability of the oscillation
is affected dramatically by the ﬂight path angle. In descent, the motion has virtually
decayed after about 10 s. In the same time frame in climbing ﬂight, the pilot is about to
intervene to inhibit an apparently violent departure. A noticeable feature of the response
in the three conditions is the changing ratio of roll to yaw. Reference 5.35 discusses
this issue and points out that when the roll and yaw motions are approximately 180◦
out of phase, the effective damping can be written in the form

Fig. 5.31 Variation of Dutch roll oscillation roll/yaw ratio with ﬂight path angle (Ref. 5.35)
Figure 5.31 compares the variation of the ratio p/r in the three conditions with the
approximation in eqn 5.73 (V Lv/L2
p), providing additional validation of this relatively
simple approximation for a complex mode. The ratio of roll to yaw motion in the
Dutch roll mode was discussed at the end of Chapter 4 in the context of the SA330
Puma. There it was shown how small perturbation linear analysis predicted Dutch roll
instability at about 120 knots. When larger sideslip perturbations were used to calculate
the derivatives however, the nonlinearity in the yawing moment with sideslip led to a
much larger value for the weathercock stability and a stable Dutch roll (see Fig. 4.28).
This strong nonlinearity leads to the development of a limit cycle in the Puma at high
speed. Figure 5.32 compares the Puma Dutch roll response for the small perturbation
linear Helisim with the full nonlinear Helisim, following a 5 m/s initial disturbance
in sideslip from a trim condition of 140 knots. The linear model predicts a rapidly
growing unstable motion with roll rates of more than 70◦/s developing after only three
oscillation cycles. The nonlinear response, which is representative of ﬂight behaviour,
indicates a limit cycle with the oscillation sustained at roll and yaw rate levels of about
5◦/s and 10◦/s, respectively; the sideslip excursions are about 10◦, a result consistent
with the stability change in Fig. 4.28 lying between sideslip perturbations of 5◦and
15◦.
The Dutch roll is often described as a ‘nuisance’ mode, in that its presence confers
nothing useful to the response to pedal or lateral cyclic controls. The Dutch roll mode
also tends to become rather easily excited by main rotor collective and longitudinal
cyclic control inputs, on account of the rotor/engine torque reactions on the fuselage.
In Chapter 6, criteria for the requirements on Dutch roll damping and frequency are
presented and it is apparent that most helicopters naturally lie in the unsatisfactory
area, largely due to the relatively high value for the ratio of dihedral to weathercock
stability. Some form of yaw axis artiﬁcial stability is therefore quite a common feature
of helicopters required to ﬂy in poor weather or where the pilot is required to ﬂy with
divided attention.

Response to Atmospheric Disturbances
Helicopter ﬂying qualities criteria try to take account of the inﬂuence of atmospheric
disturbances on the response of the aircraft in terms of required control margins close
to the edge of the operational ﬂight envelope and the consequent pilot fatigue caused
by the increased workload. We can obtain a coarse understanding of the effects of gusts
on helicopter response through linear analysis in terms of the aerodynamic derivatives.
In Chapter 2 we gave a brief discourse on response to vertical gusts, which we can
recall here to introduce the subject. Assuming a ﬁrst-order initial heave response to
vertical gusts, we can write the equation of motion in the form of eqn 5.76:
dw
dt −Zww = Zwwg
(5.76)
The heave damping derivative Zw now deﬁnes both the transient response and the gust
input gain. The initial normal acceleration in response to a sharp edge gust is given by
the expression
dw
dt

t=0
= Zwwg
(5.77)
In Chapter 2, and later in Chapter 4, we derived approximate expressions for the
magnitude of the derivative Zw, and hence the initial heave bump, for hover and
forward ﬂight in the forms

(5.79)
A key parameter in the above expressions is the blade loading (Ma/Ab), to which the
gust response is inversely proportional. The much higher blade loadings on rotorcraft,
compared with wing loadings on ﬁxed-wing aircraft, are by far the single most sig-
niﬁcant reason why helicopters are less sensitive to gusts than are the corresponding
ﬁxed-wing aircraft of the same weight and size. An important feature of helicopter
gust response in hover, according to eqn 5.78, is the alleviation due to the build-up
of rotor inﬂow. However, as we have already seen in Section 5.3.2, rotor inﬂow has a
time constant of about 0.1 s, hence the alleviation will not be as signiﬁcant in prac-
tice. In forward ﬂight the gust sensitivity is relatively constant above speeds of about
120 knots. This saturation effect is due to the cyclic blade loadings; the loadings pro-
portional to forward speed are dominated by the one-per-rev lift. A similar analysis
can be conducted for the response of the helicopter in surge and sway with velocity
perturbations in three directions. This approach assumes that the whole helicopter is
immersed in the gust ﬁeld instantaneously, thus ignoring any penetration effects or the
cyclic nature of the disturbance caused by the rotating blades. An approximation to
the effects of spatial variations in the gust strength can also be included in the form
of linear variations across the scale of the fuselage and rotor through effective rate
derivatives (e.g., Mq, L p, Nr). In adopting this approach care must be taken to include
only the aerodynamic components of these derivatives to derive the gust gains.
While the 6 DoF derivatives provide a useful starting point for understanding
helicopter gust response, the modelling problem is considerably more complex. Early
work on the analysis of helicopter gust response in the 1960s and 1970s (Refs 5.36–
5.41) examined the various alleviation factors due to rotor dynamics and penetration
effects, drawing essentially on analysis tools developed for ﬁxed-wing applications.
More recently (late 1980s and 1990s) attention has been paid to understanding response
with turbulence models more representative of helicopter operating environments, e.g.,
nap of the earth and recovery to ships (Refs 5.42, 5.43). These two periods of activity
are not obviously linked and the underlying subject of ride qualities has received
much less attention than handling qualities in recent years; as such there has not been
a coherent development of the subject of helicopter (whole-body) response to gusts
and turbulence. What can be said is that the subject is considerably more complex
than the response to pilot’s controls and requires a different analytical framework for
describingandsolvingtheproblems.Theapproachwetakeinthissectionistodividethe

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
Modelling atmospheric disturbances
In the UK Airworthiness Defence Standard (Ref. 5.45), turbulence intensity is char-
acterized by four bands: light (0–3 ft/s), moderate (3–6 ft/s), severe (6–12 ft/s) and
extreme (12–24 ft/s). A statistical approach to turbulence refers to the probability of
equalling or exceeding given intensities at deﬁned heights above different kinds of
terrain. A second important property of turbulence is the relationship between the in-
tensity and the spatial or temporal scale or duration, which also varies with height
above terrain. Such a classiﬁcation has obvious attractions for design and certiﬁca-
tion purposes, and the extensions of ﬁxed-wing methods to helicopters are generally
applicable at operating heights above about 200 ft. Below this height, the dearth of
measurements of three-dimensional atmospheric disturbances means that the charac-
terization of turbulence is less well understood, with the distinct exception of airﬂow
around man-made constructions (Ref. 5.46). For the purposes of this discussion, we
circumvent this dearth of knowledge and concern ourselves only with the general mod-
elling issues rather than speciﬁc cases, but it is important to note that extensions of
results from ﬁxed-wing studies may well not apply to helicopters. Another area where
this read-across has to be reinterpreted is the treatment of turbulence scale length. In
ﬁxed-wing work a common approximation assumes a ‘frozen-ﬁeld’ of disturbances,
such that the scale length and duration are related directly through the forward speed of
the aircraft. For helicopters in hover or ﬂying through winds at low speed, this approach
is clearly not valid and it is more appropriate to consider the aircraft ﬂying through (or
hovering in) a steady wind with the turbulence superimposed.
The most common form of turbulence model involves the decomposition of the
velocity into frequency components, where the rms of the aircraft response can be
related to the rms intensity of the turbulence. In Ref. 5.45, this power spectral density
(PSD) method is recommended for investigations of general handling qualities in
continuous turbulence. The PSD contains information about the excitation energy
within the atmosphere as a function of frequency (or spatial wavelength), and several
models exist based on measurements of real turbulence. For example, the von Karman
PSD of the vertical component of turbulence takes the form (Refs 5.47, 5.48)
wg (ν) = σ 2
wg

(5.80)
where the wavenumber v = frequency/airspeed, L is the turbulence scale and σ is the
rms of the intensity. The von Karman method assumes that the disturbance has Gaussian
properties and the extensive theory of stationary random processes can be brought to
bear when considering the response of an aircraft as a linear system. This is clearly a
strength of the approach but it also reveals a weakness. A signiﬁcant shortcoming of the
basic PSD approach is its inability to model any detailed structure in the disturbance.
Large peaks and intermittent features are smoothed over as the amplitude and phase
characteristics are assumed to be uniformly distributed across the spectrum. Any phase
correlations in the turbulence record are lost in the PSD process, hence removing the
capabilityofsinusoidalcomponentsreinforcingoneanother.Atmosphericdisturbances
with highly structured character, corresponding for example to shear layers exhibiting
sharp velocity gradients, are clearly important for helicopter applications in the wake
of hills and structures, and a different form of modelling is required in these cases.

Fig. 5.33 Elemental ramp gust used in the statistical discrete gust approach
The statistical discrete gust (SDG) approach to turbulence modelling was devel-
oped by Jones at DRA (RAE) for ﬁxed-wing applications (Refs 5.49–5.51), essentially
to cater for more structured disturbances, and appears to be ideally suited for low-
level helicopter applications. In Ref. 5.45, the SDG method is recommended for the
assessment of helicopter response to, and recovery from, large disturbances. The basis
of the SDG approach is an elemental ramp gust (Fig. 5.33) with gradient distance
(scale) H and gust amplitude (intensity) wg. A non-Gaussian turbulence record can be
reconstituted as an aggregate of discrete gusts of different shapes and sizes; different
elemental shapes, with self-similar characteristics (Ref. 5.49), can be used for different
forms of turbulence. One of the properties of turbulence, correctly modelled by the
PSD approach, and that the SDG method must preserve, is the shape of the PSD itself
which appears to ﬁt measured data well. This so-called energy constraint (Ref. 5.50) is
satisﬁed by the self-similar relationship between the gust amplitude and length in the
aggregate used to build the equivalent SDG model. For example, with the VK spec-
trum, the relationship takes the form wg ∝H1/3 for gusts with length small compared
with the reference spectral scale L.
Where the PSD approach adopts frequency-domain, linear analysis, the SDG ap-
proach is essentially a time-domain, nonlinear technique. Since the early development
of the SDG method, a theory of general transient signal analysis has been developed,
providing a rational framework for its use. The basis of this analysis is the so-called
‘Wavelet’ transform, akin to the Fourier transform, but returning a new time-domain
function of scale and intensity (Ref. 5.51). The SDG elements can now be interpreted
as a particular class of wavelet, and a turbulence time history can be decomposed
into a combination of wavelets adopting the so-called adaptive wavelet analysis (Ref.
5.48). These new techniques provide considerably more ﬂexibility in the modelling of
structured turbulence and should ﬁnd regular use in helicopter response analysis.
To close this brief review of turbulence modelling, Fig. 5.34 illustrates the com-
parison between two forms of turbulence record reconstruction (Ref. 5.48). The mea-
surements exhibit features common to real atmospheric disturbances – sharp velocity
gradients associated with shear layers and periods of relative quiescence (Fig. 5.34(a)).
Figure 5.34(b) shows the turbulence reconstructed using measured amplitude compo-
nents with random phase components from the PSD model. From a PSD perspective,
the information in Fig. 5.34(b) is identical to the measurements, but it can be seen
that all structured features in the measurements have apparently disappeared in the

reconstruction process. Figure 5.34(c), on the other hand, has been reconstructed using
the measured phase components with random amplitude components from the PSD
model. The structure has been preserved in this process, clear evidence of the non-
Gaussian characteristics of these turbulence measurements, where the real phase cor-
relation has preserved the reinforcement of energy present in the concentrated events.
These structured features of turbulence are important for helicopter work. They oc-
cur in the nap-of-the-earth and close to oil rigs and ships. Their scales can also be
quite small and, at low helicopter speeds, scale lengths as small as the rotor radius can
inﬂuence ride and handling.
Modelling helicopter response
Consideration of the response of helicopters to atmospheric disturbances needs to take
account of a number of factors. We have seen from the simple Level 1 modelling
described in Chapter 3 that the rotor response to in-plane and out-of-plane veloc-
ity perturbations is distributed over the frequencies associated with the harmonics of
rotorspeed. In high-speed ﬂight the force response at the rotor hub tends to be dom-
inated by the n-per-rev and 2n-per-rev components, and many studies have focused
on important fatigue and hub vibratory loading problems (e.g., Refs 5.52, 5.53). Only

 
Stability Under Constraint and Response Analysis

the zero harmonic forces and the ﬁrst harmonic moments lead to zero-frequency hub
and fuselage response and thus affect the piloting task directly. Several studies (e.g.,
Refs 5.38–5.40) have concentrated on investigating factors that alleviate the fuselage
response relative to the sharp bump predicted by ‘instantaneous’ models, typiﬁed,
for example, by eqn 5.77. Rotor–fuselage penetration effects coupled with any gust
ramp characteristics tend to dominate the alleviation with secondary effects due to
rotor dynamics and blade elasticity. Rotor unsteady aerodynamics can also have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on helicopter response, particularly the inﬂow/wake dynamics
(see Chapter 3). An important aspect covered in several published works concerns
the cyclo-stationary nature of the rotor blade response (Refs 5.42, 5.43, 5.54, 5.55).
Essentially, the radial distribution of turbulence effects varies periodically and the gust
velocity environments at the rotor hub and rotor blade tip are therefore substantially
different. If a helicopter is ﬂying through a sinusoidal vertical gust ﬁeld with scale
L and intensity wgm, then the turbulence velocities experienced at the rotor hub and
blade tip are given by the expressions

where V is the combined forward velocity of the aircraft and gust ﬁeld. Response studies
that include only hub-ﬁxed turbulence models (eqn 5.81) and assume total immersion
of the rotor at any instant clearly ignore much of the local detail in the way the individ-
ual blades experience the gust ﬁeld. At low speed with scales O(R), this approximation
becomes invalid, and recourse to more detailed modelling is required. Assuming the
gust ﬁeld varies linearly across the rotor allows the disturbance to be incorporated as
an effective pitch (roll) rate or non-uniform inﬂow component. This level of approxi-
mation can be regarded as providing an interim level of accuracy for gust scales that
are larger than the rotor but that still vary signiﬁcantly across the disc at any given time.
In Ref. 5.56, a study is reported on the validity of various approximations to the way
in which rotor blades respond to turbulence, suitable for incorporation into a real-time
simulation model. The study concluded that the modelling of two-dimensional turbu-
lence effects is likely to be required, and that approximating the turbulence intensity
over a whole blade by the value at the 3/4 radius would provide adequate levels of
accuracy.
In addition to characterizing the atmospheric disturbance, the SDG approach,
augmented with the transient wavelet analysis, provides a useful insight into helicopter
response. The concept of the tuned response is illustrated in Fig. 5.35. Associated with
each ramp gust input (Fig. 5.35(a)) we assume the response variable of interest has a
single dominant peak, of amplitude γ , as shown in Fig. 5.35(b). If the helicopter model
is excited with each member of the family of equi-probable gusts, according to the von
Karman PSD, then we ﬁnd, in general, that the response peak function takes the form
given in Fig. 5.35(c). There exists a tuned gust length H that produces a ‘resonant’
response from the helicopter. This transient response resonance is the equivalent of
the resonance frequency in the frequency domain representation, and can be used to
quantify a helicopter’s ride qualities.

response; (c) tuned response function
Ride qualities
The third aspect in this section is concerned with the sensitivity of aircraft, crew,
weapon system, passengers or equipment to atmospheric disturbances, taken together
under the general heading – ride qualities. Reference 5.57 discusses the parameters
used to quantify ride bumpiness for military ﬁxed-wing aircraft, in terms of the normal
acceleration response. For helicopter applications, the meaning of ride qualities, in
terms of which ﬂight parameters are important, is a powerful function of the aircraft
role and ﬂight condition. For example, the design of a civil transport helicopter required
to cruise at 160 knots may well consider the critical case as the number of, say, 1/2 g
verticalbumpsperminuteinthepassengercabinwhenﬂyingthroughsevereturbulence.
For an attack helicopter the critical case may be the attitude perturbations in the hover,
while cargo helicopters operating at low speed with underslung loads may have ﬂight
path displacement as the design case. For the ﬁrst example quoted, a direct parallel
can be drawn from ﬁxed-wing experience. In Ref. 5.57 Jones promotes the application
of the SDG method to aircraft ride qualities in the following way. We have already
introduced the concept of the tuned gust, producing the maximum or tuned transient
response. Based on tuned gust analysis, the predicted rate of occurrence of vertical
bumps can be written in the form
ny = n0 exp

−y
βγ

,
n0 =
α
λH
(5.83)
where
ny is the average number of aircraft normal acceleration peaks with magnitude greater
than y, per unit distance ﬂown;
α and β reﬂect statistical properties of the patch of turbulence through which the
aircraft is ﬂying;
H is the tuned gust scale (length);
γ is the tuned response (Fig. 5.35(c));
λ is the gust length sensitivity.
In addition to its relative simplicity, this kind of formulation has the advantage that it
caters for structured turbulence and hence structured aircraft response. The approach
can be extended to cases where the gust ﬁeld is better represented by gust pairs and
other more complicated patterns, with associated complex tuning functions. The basis
of the SDG method is the assumption that structured atmospheric disturbance is more
correctly and more efﬁciently modelled by localized transient features. The wavelet

analysishasprovidedasoundtheoreticalframeworkforextendingtheformsoftransient
disturbance and response shape to more deterministic analyses. At the same time,
new handling qualities criteria are being developed that characterize the response in
moderate amplitude manoeuvres, also in terms of transient response. The so-called
attitude ‘quickness’ (Ref. 5.58), to be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, represents
a transient property of an aircraft’s response to pilot control inputs. The same concept
can be extended to the analysis of the aircraft response to discrete gusts, as summarized
in Fig. 5.36. The response quickness, shown in Fig. 5.36(a) applied to the normal
velocity response, is extracted from a signal by identifying signiﬁcant changes (
w –
strictly the integral of acceleration) and estimating the associated maximum or peak
rate of change, in this case peak normal acceleration (az pk); the quickness associated
with the event is then given by the discrete parameter
Qw =
az pk

w
(5.84)
Clearly, each discrete gust has an associated quickness, which actually approximates to
1/L in the limit of a linear ramp gust. Quickness values can then be plotted as points on
charts as shown in Fig. 5.36(b). In this case we have plotted the values as a function of
the gust input intensity, assuming a unique relationship between the input–output pair.
Bradley et al. (Ref. 5.44) have shown that the quickness points group along the tuning
lines, related to ¯γ , as shown in hypothetical form in Fig. 5.36(b). Also shown in the
ﬁgure are contours of equi-responsiveness or equi-comfort which suggest a possible
format for specifying ride quality.
The ongoing research on the topic of ride qualities is likely to produce alterna-
tive approaches to modelling and analysing disturbance and response, derived as ever
from different perspectives and experiences. The key to more general acceptance will
certainly be validation with real-world experience and test data, and it is in this area
that the major gaps lie and much more work needs to be done. There are very few
sets of test data available, and perhaps none that is fully documented, that characterize

 
352
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Modelling
the disturbance and the helicopter response to turbulence in low-level nap-of-the-earth
ﬂight; it is a prime area for future research. Data are important to validate simulation
modelling and also to establish new ride criteria that can be used with conﬁdence in the
design of new aircraft and the associated automatic ﬂight control systems. The current
speciﬁcation standards for rotorcraft handling do not make any signiﬁcant distinction
between the performance associated with the response to controls and disturbances.
Clearly, an aircraft which is naturally agile is also likely to be naturally bumpy, and an
active control system will need to have design features that cope with both handling
and ride quality requirements. Fortunately, the handling qualities standards, perhaps
the more important of the two, are now, in general, better understood, having been the
subject of intense investigations over the last 15 years. Handling qualities forms the
subject of the remaining two chapters of this book.

Flying qualities: objective assessment
and criteria development
Experience has shown that a large percentage, perhaps as much as 65%,
of the life-cycle cost of an aircraft is committed during the early design
and deﬁnition phases of a new development program. It is clear, further-
more, that the handling qualities of military helicopters are also largely
committed in these early deﬁnition phases and, with them, much of the mis-
sion capability of the vehicle. For these reasons, sound design standards
are of paramount importance both in achieving desired performance and
avoiding unnecessary program cost. ADS-33 provides this sound guid-
ance in areas of ﬂying qualities, and the authority of the new standards
is anchored in a unique base of advanced simulation studies and in-ﬂight
validation studies, developed under the TTCP collaboration.

General Introduction to Flying Qualities
In Chapter 2, the Introductory Tour of this book, we described an incident that occurred
in the early days of helicopter ﬂying qualities testing at the Royal Aircraft Establish-
ment (Ref. 6.1). An S-51 helicopter was being ﬂown to determine the longitudinal
stability and control characteristics, when the pilot lost control of the aircraft. The
aircraft continued to ﬂy in a series of gross manoeuvres before it self-righted and the
pilot was able to regain control and land safely. The incident highlighted the potential
consequences of poor handling qualities – pilot disorientation and structural damage.
In the case described the crew were fortunate; in many other circumstances these con-
sequences can lead to a crash and loss of life. Good ﬂying qualities play a major role
in contributing to ﬂight safety. But ﬂying qualities also need to enhance performance,
and this tension between improving safety and performance in concert is ever present
in the work of the ﬂying qualities engineer. An arguable generalization is that military
requirements lean towards an emphasis on performance while civil requirements are
more safety oriented. We shall address this tension with some fresh insight later in this
chapter, but ﬁrst we need to bring out the scope of the topic.

still holds good today, but needs to be elaborated to reveal the scope of present
day and future usage. Figure 6.1 attempts to do this by illustrating the range of
inﬂuences – those external to and those internal to the aircraft and pilot. This allows us to
highlightﬂyingqualitiesasthesynergybetweenthesetwogroupsofinﬂuencingfactors.
To emphasize this point, it could be argued that without a complete description of the
inﬂuencing factors, it is ambiguous to talk about ﬂying qualities. It could also be argued
that there is no such thing as a Level 1 or a Level 2 aircraft, in the Cooper–Harper par-
lance. The quality can be referenced only to a particular mission (or even mission task
element(MTE))inparticularvisualcues,etc.Inapedanticsensethisargumentishardto
counter, but we take a more liberal approach in this book by examining each facet, each
inﬂuencing factor, separately, and by discussing relevant quality criteria as a sequence
of one-dimensional perspectives. We shall return to the discussion again in Chapter 7.
In the preceding paragraph, the terms handling qualities and ﬂying qualities have
deliberately been used interchangeably and this ﬂexibility is generally adopted through-
out the book. At the risk of distracting the reader, it is fair to say, however, that there
is far from universal agreement on this issue. In an attempt to clarify and emphasize
the task dependencies, Key, as discussed in Ref. 6.4, proposes a distinction whereby
ﬂying qualities are deﬁned as the aircraft’s stability and control characteristics (i.e., the
internal attributes), while handling qualities are deﬁned with the task and environment
included (external inﬂuences). While it is tempting to align with this perspective, the
author resists on the basis that provided the important inﬂuence of task and environ-
ment are recognized, there seems no good reason to relegate ﬂying to be a subset of
handling.
In the structure of current Civil and Military Requirements, good ﬂying quali-
ties are conferred to ensure that safe ﬂight is guaranteed throughout the operational
ﬂight envelope (OFE). The concept of ﬂying quality requires a measurement scale
to judge an aircraft’s suitability for role, and most of the efforts of ﬂying qualities
engineers over the years have been directed at the development of appropriate scales
and metrics, underpinned and substantiated by ﬂight test data. The most developed
and widely recognized quality scale is that due to Cooper and Harper (Ref. 6.2).
Goodness, or quality, according to Cooper–Harper, can be measured on a scale span-
ning three levels (Fig. 6.2). Aircraft are normally required to be Level 1 throughout
the OFE (Refs 6.5, 6.6); Level 2 is acceptable in failed and emergency situations
but Level 3 is considered unacceptable. The achievement of Level 1 quality signiﬁes
that a minimum required standard has been met or exceeded in design, and can be

expected to be achieved regularly in operational use, measured in terms of task perfor-
mance and pilot workload. Compliance ﬂight testing is required to demonstrate that
a helicopter meets the required standard and involves clinical measurements of ﬂying
qualities parameters for which good values are known from experience. It also involves
the performance of pilot-in-the-loop MTEs, along with the acquisition of subjective
comments and pilot ratings. The emphasis on minimum requirements is important
and is made to ensure that manufacturers are not unduly constrained when conducting
their design trade studies. Establishing the quality of ﬂying, therefore, requires ob-
jective and subjective assessments which are the principal topics of Chapters 6 and 7
respectively.
We refer to the subjective pilot ratings given on the Cooper–Harper scale as han-
dling qualities ratings (HQRs). HQRs are awarded by pilots for an aircraft ﬂying an
MTE, and are determined by the pilot following through the decision tree shown in
Fig. 6.2, to arrive at his or her rating based on their judgement of task performance
achieved and pilot workload expended. The task performance requirements will have
been set at desired and adequate levels and the pilot should have sufﬁcient task cues to
support the judgement of how well he or she has done. In a well-deﬁned experiment
this will usually be the case, but poorly deﬁned ﬂight tests can lead to increased scatter
between pilots on account of the variations in perceived performance (see Chapter 7
for more discussion on this topic). Task performance can be measured, be it ﬂight
path accuracy, tracking performance or landing scatter and the results plotted to give
a picture of the relative values of ﬂying quality. The other side of the coin, pilot
workload, is much more difﬁcult to quantify, but we ask test pilots to describe their
workload in terms of the compensation they are required to apply, with qualiﬁers –
minimal, moderate, considerable, extensive and maximum. The scale implies an at-
tempt to determine how much spare capacity the pilot has to accomplish other mis-
sion duties or to think ahead and react quickly in emergencies. The dual concepts of
‘attentional demand’ and ‘excess control capacity’ have been introduced by McRuer
(Ref. 6.7) to distinguish and measure the contributing factors to the pilot workload.
However subjective, and hence ﬂawed by the variability of pilot training and skill, the
use of HQRs may seem, along with supporting pilot comment and task performance
results, it has dominated ﬂying qualities research since the 1960s. It is recognized
that at least three pilots should participate in a ﬂying qualities experiment (prefer-
ably more, ideally ﬁve or six) and that HQRs can be plotted with mean, max and
min shown; a range of more than two or three pilot ratings should alert the ﬂying
qualities engineer to a fault in experimental design. These are detailed issues and
will be addressed later in Chapter 7, but the reader should register the implied cau-
tion; misuse of HQRs and the Cooper–Harper scale is all too easy and too commonly
found.
Task performance requirements drive HQRs and give modern military ﬂying qual-
ities standards, like the US Army’s ADS-33C (Ref. 6.5), a mission orientation. The
ﬂying qualities are intended to support the task. In a hierarchical manner, ADS-33C
deﬁnes the response types (i.e., the short-term character of response to control input)
required to achieve Level 1 or 2 handling qualities for a wide variety of different
MTEs, in different usable cue environments (UCE) for normal and failed states, with
full and divided pilot attention. Criteria are deﬁned for both hover/low speed and for-
ward ﬂight, in recognition of the different MTEs and related pilot control strategies in
the two operating regimes. Within these ﬂight phases, the criteria can be further related

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
359
to the level of aggressiveness used by the pilot in attacking a manoeuvre or MTE.
At a deeper level, the response characteristics are broken down in terms of amplitude
and frequency range, from the small amplitude, higher frequency requirements set by
criteria like equivalent low-order system response or bandwidth, to the large amplitude
manoeuvre requirements set by control power. By comparison, the equivalent ﬁxed-
wing requirements, MIL-F-8785C (Ref. 6.6), take a somewhat different perspective,
with ﬂight phases and aircraft categories, but the basic message is the same – how to
establish ﬂying quality in mission-related tasks. The innovations of ADS-33 are many
and varied and will be covered in this chapter; one of the many signiﬁcant departures
from its predecessor, MIL-H-8501A, is that there is no categorization according to
aircraft size or, explicitly, according to role, but only by the required MTEs. This em-
phasizes the multi-role nature of helicopters and gives the new speciﬁcation document
generic value. Without doubt, ADS-33 has resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in atten-
tion to ﬂying qualities in the procurement process and manufacturing since its ﬁrst
publication in the mid-1980s, and will possibly be perceived in later years as marking
a watershed in helicopter development. The new ﬂying qualities methodology is best
illustrated by Key’s diagram (Ref. 6.8) shown in Fig. 6.3.
In this ﬁgure the role of the manufacturer is highlighted, and several of the ADS-
33 innovations that will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter are brought
out, e.g., response types and the UCE.

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
In a similar timeframe to the development of ADS-33C, the revision to the UK’s
Def Stan 00970 was undertaken (Ref. 6.9). This document maintained the UK tradition
of stating mandatory requirements in qualitative terms only, backed up with advisory
leaﬂets to provide guidance on how the characteristics may be achieved. An example
of the 970 requirements, relating to response to control inputs, reads
10.1.2 The ﬂying controls should not be over-sensitive, to an extent that leads di-
rectly to difﬁculty in establishing or maintaining any desired ﬂight condition, or that
promotes pilot induced oscillations (leaﬂet 600/7, para 3).
With this intentionally catch-all parlance, Def Stan 970 leaves it to the manufacturer to
decide how this is to be achieved. In contrast, the criteria in ADS-33 quantify respon-
siveness and sensitivity and lay down mandatory quality boundaries on measurable
parameters. A comparison of the philosophy in the two distinct approaches could oc-
cupy much of this chapter but the author is reluctant to embark on such a venture. In
the author’s view, however, one thing that does need to be stressed is that the resources
applied to the development of ADS-33, and the harnessing of the best international
facilities, have resulted in a breakthrough in the development of helicopter ﬂying
qualities – all based on the creation of a new ﬂying qualities test database, the absence
of which has hindered several previous initiatives over the last 25 years. Def Stan
970 complements the more substantiated US requirements, and those areas where 970
provides additional insight will be highlighted in this chapter.
If we turn to ﬂying qualities requirements for civil helicopters, we ﬁnd safety
a much more signiﬁcant driver and the requirements are once again more qualitative
in nature (Refs 6.10–6.13). Of major concern are the safety of operations in the ever-
decreasing weather minima and the ability of the pilot to recover to safe ﬂight following
major system failures. Handling qualities research efforts have therefore been focused
on the development of requirements for artiﬁcial stability to support IFR ﬂight and
ﬂight test procedures for recovering from failures. The increased emphasis on military
ﬂying qualities requirements in recent years has also prompted a closer examination
of the potential of the new criteria formats for civil applications. One such review is
reported in Ref. 6.12, and some of the ideas arising from this study will be sampled
throughout Chapters 6 and 7.
This chapter is primarily about how Level 1 helicopters should behave and how to
test for compliance, not how they are made. Design issues are touched on occasionally
in the context of criteria development but will not be central to the discussion. The
reader is referred to Chapters 4 and 5 for implicit design considerations through the
analysis of trim, stability and response. However, the subject of design for helicopter
ﬂying qualities, including bare airframe and stability and control augmentation, is left
for a future book and perhaps to an author closer to the manufacturing disciplines.
6.2
Introduction and Scope: The Objective
Measurement of Quality
This chapter is concerned with those ﬂying qualities characteristics that can be quan-
tiﬁed in parametric, and hence, numerical, terms. A range of new concepts in quality
discrimination were established during the 1980s and are now taking a ﬁrm hold in the
development of new projects in both Europe and the United States. Some background

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
361
interpretation and discussion of the development rationale are provided from the
author’s own perspective, particularly relating to the quantitative criteria in the US
Army’s ADS-33. Before ADS-33, the existing mandatory and even advisory design
criteria were so ill-matched to the high performance helicopter that achieving compli-
ance with these in simulation provided little insight into problems that might occur in
ﬂight. Furthermore, aircraft that demonstrated compliance during ﬂight test could still
be unﬁt for their intended role. These two paradoxical situations have prevailed since
design criteria were ﬁrst written down and their continued existence can be tolerated
only on two counts. First, there is the argument that criteria should not constrain the
design creativity unduly and, second, that handling qualities of new designs in new
roles should not be prejudiced by a limited database derived from older types. These
two points should serve to alert us to the need for living requirements criteria that
are robust; the term robust is applicable in this context to requirements that meet the
so-called CACTUS rules (Ref. 6.14), namely
(1) Complete – covering all missions, ﬂight phases and response characteristics, i.e., all
the internal and external inﬂuencing factors;
(2) Appropriate – the criteria formats should be robust enough to discern quality in the
intended range of application (e.g., frequency domain rather than time domain criteria
for pilot-induced oscillation (PIO) boundaries);
(3) Correct – all Level 1/2 and 2/3 quality boundaries should be positioned correctly;
(4) Testable – from design through to certiﬁcation;
(5) Unambiguous – clear and simple, easy to interpret; perhaps the most challenging of
the rules, and vital for widespread acceptance;
(6) Substantiated – drawn and conﬁgured from a database derived from similar types
performing similar roles; perhaps the single most important rule that underpins the
credibility of new criteria.
Striving to meet the CACTUS rules is recognized as a continuing challenge for the
ﬂying qualities engineer as roles develop and new data become available. The criteria
discussed in this chapter conform to the rules to varying degrees, some strongly, some
hardly at all; we shall attempt to reﬂect on these different levels of conformity as the
chapter progresses.
Turning to the framework of ADS-33, Table. 6.1 provides an overview snapshot
for selected MTEs. The ﬁgure links together the key innovations of the speciﬁcation –
the response types (RT), the mission task elements (MTE) and the usable cue environ-
ment (UCE). The UCE, derived from pilot subjective ratings of the quality of visual task
cues, will be discussed in more detail later in Chapter 7. Its introduction into ADS-33
draws attention to the need for different ﬂying qualities in different visual conditions,
in particular in so-called degraded visual environments (DVE), when ﬂying close to
the ground. A UCE of 1 corresponds to conditions where the pilot has very good visual
cues to support the control of attitude and velocity, while a UCE 3 corresponds to con-
ditions where the pilot can make small and gentle corrections only because of deﬁcient
visual cues. Table 6.1 tells us that to achieve Level 1 ﬂying qualities in the selected
MTEs, rate command is adequate in a UCE 1 while the requirements become more
demanding in poorer UCEs. Attitude command is required for pitch and roll in a UCE
of 2 and translational rate command with position and height hold for a UCE 3.
The RT relates to the character of the response in the ﬁrst few seconds following
a pilot-applied step control input. Figure 6.4 shows how the attitude varies for the

different types in pure form, including for completeness, the acceleration RT. Rate
Command (RC) response is generally regarded as the simplest practical type found
with conventional helicopters. The deﬁnition of rate command in ADS-33 actually
allows for variations in the response away from the pure rate to include the variety
of current helicopters that do not fall neatly into the pure categories but still exhibit
satisfactory handling qualities. A basic requirement is that the initial and ﬁnal cockpit
controller force, following an attitude change, shall be the same sign. As the RTs
become more directly related to translational response, two associated factors impact
the pilotage. First, attitude command (AC) is easier to ﬂy than RC, and translational rate
command (TRC) is easier to ﬂy than attitude command, attitude hold (ACAH). With
TRC, not only is the attitude loop automatically closed, thus relieving the pilot of the
higher gain-attitude stabilization, but also the velocity feedback loop is automatically
closed, reducing piloting essentially to a steering task. Second, the additional stability
is achieved at the expense of manoeuvrability and agility. The highest performance

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
363
can, in principle, be achieved with an acceleration command RT through a direct
force/moment inceptor, but the pilot would have to work so hard (performing three
mental integrations) to achieve ﬂight path accuracy that the additional performance
‘available’ would almost certainly be wasted. As the RT becomes progressively more
stable, the available manoeuvre performance envelope reduces. This is completely in
accord with the need for the higher levels of augmentation, of course. Pilots will not
normally require high performance in DVE. The different requirements highlighted by
Table 6.1 reinforce the importance of task in the quality of ﬂying. But it is not sufﬁcient
to deﬁne the RT; the detailed character of the response in the short–long term and at
small–large amplitude needs quantifying. We need a framework for this deeper study
of response quality.
Figure 6.5 illustrates a convenient division of aircraft response characteristics on
one of our reference diagrams, showing response frequency against amplitude. The
discriminators – large, medium and small for amplitude and long, mid and short term
for frequency – are intended to encompass, in a meaningful and systematic way, all of
the task demands the pilot is likely to encounter. The framework includes the zero and
very low frequency trim, and the zero and very low amplitude stability areas. A third
dimension, cross-coupling, is added to highlight that direct response characteristics
are insufﬁcient to describe response quality fully. The hyperbolic-like boundary shows
how the manoeuvre envelope of an aircraft is constrained – as the amplitude increases,
then various physical mechanisms come into play that limit the speed at which the
manoeuvre can be accomplished, e.g., control range, actuator rate, rotor thrust/moment
capability, etc. The boundary represents the dynamic OFE and ﬂying qualities criteria
are required across the full range of frequency and amplitude.
This chapter is primarily concerned with the characteristics required to confer a
helicopter with Level 1 ﬂying qualities, although we shall give some attention to Level 2
characteristics since most operational helicopters spend a considerable time in Level 2.

Within the sections, each of the four primary response axes will be discussed – roll,
pitch, yaw and heave, along with the variety of different cross-coupling mechanisms.
Theotherimportantinternalfactors,inceptorsanddisplays,willbediscussedinChapter
7; they both have strong inﬂuences in ﬂying qualities, particularly for ﬂight in degraded
visual conditions and at ﬂight envelope limits where tactile cueing through the pilot’s
controls is particularly important. Where appropriate, some comparison with ﬁxed-
wing aircraft criteria and quality boundaries will be made. A as the reader embarks
on this chapter, it is worth noting that while considerable progress has been made
with helicopter ﬂying qualities criteria between the mid-1980s and early-1990s, the
evolutionary process is continuing. At the time of writing the second edition of this
book the same is true, and some of the developments, particularly the requirements
criteria in ADS-33, are summarized in Section 6.9. Chapter 8 addresses degraded
handling qualities. The author has had to be selective with the material covered in view
of the considerable amount of relevant published work in the literature. This comment
is particularly germane to the coverage given to ADS-33 criteria; readers are earnestly
referred to these design guidelines and associated references in the open literature for
a more precise and complete deﬁnition of handling boundaries. We begin with the roll
axis and this will allow us to introduce and develop a range of concepts also applicable
to the other axes of control.
6.3
Roll Axis Response Criteria
The ability to generate rolling moments about the aircraft’s centre of gravity serves
three purposes. First, to enable the pilot to trim out residual moments from the fuselage,
empennage and tail rotor, e.g., in a pure hover, sideslipping ﬂight, slope landings,
hovering in side-winds. Second, so that the rotor thrust vector can be reoriented to
manoeuvre in the lateral plane, e.g., repositioning sidestep, attitude regulation in tight
ﬂight path control. Third, so that the pilot can counteract the effects of atmospheric
disturbances. All three can make different demands on the aircraft, and ﬂying qualities
criteria must try to embrace them in a complementary way.
6.3.1
Task margin and manoeuvre quickness
The roll axis has probably received more attention than any other over the years, possi-
bly as a carry-over from the extensive research database in ﬁxed-wing ﬂying qualities,
but also because roll control arguably exhibits the purest characteristics and is most
amenable to analysis. A comprehensive review of roll ﬂying qualities is contained
in Ref. 6.15. In this work, Hefﬂey and his co-authors introduced the concept of the
‘task signature’ or ‘task portrait’, discussed in Chapter 2 of this book (see Fig. 2.40),
and also the ‘task margin’, or the control margin beyond that required for the task in
hand. The basic ideas are summarized conceptually in Fig. 6.6, which shows how the
roll rate requirements vary with manoeuvre amplitude (i.e., change in roll angle). The
manoeuvre demand limit line is deﬁned by the tasks required of the helicopter in the
particular mission. The task margin is the additional vehicle capability required for
emergency operations. The manoeuvre amplitude range can conveniently be divided
into the three ranges discussed earlier – small, moderate and large – corresponding
to precise tracking, discrete manoeuvring and maximum manoeuvre tasks, as shown.

Fig. 6.6 Roll rate requirements as a function of manoeuvre amplitude (Ref. 6.15)
Highlighted in Fig. 6.6 are the principal design features that deﬁne the outer limit
of vehicle capability – rotor stiffness in the small amplitude range and Lock number
in the high amplitude range; the actuation rate and authority limits also deﬁne the
shape of the capability boundary in the moderate to high amplitude range. To convert
Fig. 6.6 into a form compatible with the frequency/amplitude diagram in Fig. 6.5 re-
quires us to look back at the very simple task signature concept. Figure 6.7 shows the
time histories of lateral cyclic, roll attitude and rate for a Lynx ﬂying a slalom MTE
(Ref. 6.16). The manoeuvre kinematics can be loosely interpreted as a sequence of
attitude changes each associated with a particular roll rate peak, emphasized in the
phase plane portraits in Fig. 6.8. For the case of the Lynx, roll control is essentially
rate command, so that the attitude rate follows the control activity reasonably closely
(see Fig. 6.9). The task signature portrait in Fig. 6.10 (a) shows selected rate peaks plot-
ted against the corresponding attitude change during the slalom. Each point represents
a discrete manoeuvre change accomplished with a certain level of aggression or attack.
Points that lie on the same ‘spoke’ lines correspond to similar levels of attack by the
pilot. We reserve the descriptors ‘attack’ and ‘aggression’ for the pilot behaviour, and
use the expression ‘quickness’ to describe this temporal property of the manoeuvre.
Manoeuvre quickness, or in the present case roll attitude quickness, is the ratio of peak
rate to attitude change during a discrete manoeuvre and was ﬁrst proposed in Ref. 6.15
as an alternate ﬂying qualities or control effectiveness parameter:
roll attitude quickness = ppk

Fig. 6.11 Generalized response quickness diagram (Ref. 6.15)
of the boundary lines against the attitude changes, we arrive at Fig. 6.11, showing the
characteristic hyperbolic shape with amplitude of Fig. 6.5. For a given roll attitude
change, there will be a maximum value of achievable quickness deﬁned by the limit
of the vehicle capability. When the manoeuvre amplitude is high enough, the limiting
function in Fig. 6.11 will genuinely be hyperbolic, as the maximum rate is achieved
and the limit is inversely proportional to the attitude change. This trend is conﬁrmed
in Fig. 6.10 (b), which shows the envelope of maximum quickness derived in the Lynx
slalom ﬂight trials described in Ref. 6.16. The highest roll attitude changes of more than
100◦were experienced during the roll reversal phases of the MTE. Values of quickness
up to 1 rad/s were measured during these reversals, indicating that pilots were using at
least 100◦/s of roll rate at the highest levels of aggression. In the low amplitude range
the quickness rises to more than 5 rad/s, although with the small values of roll attitude
change here, the extraction of accurate values of quickness is difﬁcult. The quickness
parameter has gained acceptance as one of the innovations of ADS-33, applicable to
the moderate amplitude range of manoeuvres. We shall return to this discrimination
later in this section but ﬁrst we examine some of the theoretical aspects of quickness,
applied to a simple model of roll control.
The ﬁrst-order approximation to roll response has been discussed in Chapters 2, 4
and 5, and the reader needs to be aware of the limited range of validity when applied to
helicopters. Nevertheless, this simple model can be used to gain useful insight into the
theoretical properties of quickness. We consider the ﬁrst-order, differential equation of
motion of a rate command response-type helicopter, written in the form
˙p −L p p = Lθ1cθ1c = −L p psθ1c
(6.2)
where p is the roll rate and θ1c the lateral cyclic control; we have neglected any
rotor or actuation dynamics in this model. The damping and control derivatives have
been discussed in detail in Chapter 4. The response to a step input in lateral cyclic
is an exponential growth to a steady-state roll rate ps. To derive a value for attitude

Fig. 6.12 Simple rate response to pulse lateral cyclic input
quickness we need to consider the response to a pulse input of duration t1, which leads
to a discrete attitude change 
φ (Fig. 6.12). Analytic expressions for the roll rate and
attitude response expressions then have two forms, one during the application of the
pulse and the second after the pulse:

From these expressions the attitude quickness can be formed and, after some reduction,
we obtain the simple expression

(6.5)
where
ˆt1 = −Lpt1
(6.6)
The normalized time ˆt1 given by eqn 6.6 can be thought of as the ratio of the manoeuvre
duration to the time constant of the aircraft. The quickness, normalized by the roll
damping, is shown plotted against ˆt1 in Fig. 6.13. One important result of this analysis
is that the quickness is independent of control input size. For a 2-s pulse, the quickness
will be the same from a small and large input; this is essentially a property of the
linear system described by eqn 6.2 and may no longer be true when nonlinearities are

Fig. 6.13 Variation of normalized quickness with manoeuvre time ratio

As ˆt1 becomes large, the quickness decreases inversely with ˆt1, i.e.,

(6.8)
Equation 6.8 tells us that when the manoeuvre is slow relative to the aircraft time
constant, then the latter plays a small part in the quickness and the attitude change is
practically equal to the roll rate times the pulse time. Equation 6.7 describes the limit
for small-duration control inputs, when the roll transient response is still evolving.
This case requires closer examination because of its deeper signiﬁcance which should
become apparent. The inverse of the roll damping is equal to the time to reach 63% of
ps following a step input, but the parameter has another related interpretation in the
frequency domain. Heuristically, frequency would appear to be more signiﬁcant than
amplitude in view of the insensitivity of quickness to control input size. The phase
angle between the roll rate as output and the lateral cyclic as input as a function of
frequency is given by the relationship

When the phase between p and θ1c is 45◦, then the frequency is numerically equal to
the damping L p. This corresponds to the case when the attitude response is 135◦out of
phase with the control input. We shall see later in this section that the frequency when
the attitude response lags the control by 135◦is deﬁned by a fundamental handling
parameter – the (open-loop) attitude bandwidth. For non-classical response types we
shall show that the attitude bandwidth is a more signiﬁcant parameter than the roll
damping and conforms more closely with many of the CACTUS rules. Bandwidth is
one of the central parameters in ADS-33.
Returning to our framework diagram, we are now in a better position to examine
quality criteria and the associated ﬂight test measurement techniques; we divide the
diagram into three ‘dynamic’ regions as shown (Fig. 6.14). We broadly follow the
ADS-33 deﬁnition of the amplitude ranges:
(1) small, φ < 10◦, continuous closed loop, compensatory tracking;
(2) moderate, 10◦< φ < 60◦, pursuit tracking, terrain avoidance, repositioning;
(3) large, φ > 60◦, maximum manoeuvres;
and review selected military and civil criteria. On Fig. 6.14 we have included the narrow
range of zero to very low frequency to classify trim and quasi-static behaviour. The
ﬁrst of the ‘manoeuvre’ regions combines moderate and large amplitude roll attitude
criteria.
6.3.2
Moderate to large amplitude/low to moderate frequency:
quickness and control power
The most appropriate parameter for deﬁning the quality of ﬂying large amplitude
manoeuvres is the control power available, i.e., the maximum response achievable by
applying full control from the trim condition. For rate command systems this will be
measured in deg/s, while for attitude command response, the control power is measured
in degrees. This ‘new’ deﬁnition found in ADS-33 contrasts with the earlier MIL-H-
8501 and ﬁxed-wing criteria where the control power related to the maximum control

 
372
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.15 Minimum roll control power requirements – rate response type (Ref. 6.5)
moment available. To avoid confusion we conform with the ADS-33 deﬁnition. Perhaps
more than any other handling qualities parameter, the control power is strongly task
dependent. Figure 6.15 illustrates this with the minimum control power requirements
for Level 1 handling qualities (according to ADS-33) corresponding to MTEs that
require limited, moderate and aggressive manoeuvring. The ﬁgure shows requirements
for rate response types in low speed and forward ﬂight MTEs. The minimum rate
control power requirements vary from 15◦/s in forward ﬂight IMC through to 90◦/s in
air combat.
Ground-based simulations conducted at the RAE in the late 1970s (Ref. 6.17)
were aimed at deﬁning the agility requirements for battleﬁeld helicopters and roll
control power was given particular attention. Figure 6.16 shows the maximum
roll rates used in the roll reversal phase of a triple bend manoeuvre as a function
of roll angle change for various ﬂight speeds. The dashed manoeuvre line corresponds
to the theoretical case when the reversal is accomplished in just 2 s. For the cases
shown, the control power was set at a high level (> 120◦/s) to give the test pilots
freedom to exploit as much as they needed. For speeds up to about 70 knots, the pilot
control strategy followed the theoretical line, but as the speed increased to 90 and 100
knots there was a marked increase in the maximum roll rates used. This rapid change
in control strategy at some critical point as task demands increase is signiﬁcant and
will be discussed later in Chapter 7. The spread of data points corresponds to different
rotor conﬁgurations, resulting in different roll time constants as shown in the ﬁgure.
With the larger time constants, corresponding to articulated or teetering rotor heads, the
pilots typically used 30–40% more roll rate than with the shorter time constants typical
of hingeless rotors. It appears that with ‘soft’ rotors, the pilot will use more control
to quicken the manoeuvre. This more complex control strategy leads to an increase in

Fig. 6.16 Peak roll rates from triple bend manoeuvre
workload and a degradation in the pilot opinion of handling qualities, a topic we shall
return to in Chapter 7. The study of Ref. 6.17 concluded that for rapid nap-of-the-earth
(NoE) manoeuvring in the mid-speed range, a minimum control power requirement
of 100◦/s was necessary for helicopters with moderately stiff rotors, typical of today’s
hingeless rotor conﬁgurations.
The measurement of control power is, in theory, quite straightforward; establish
trimmed ﬂight and apply maximum control until the response reaches its steady state.
In practice, unless great care is taken, this is likely to result in large excursions in
roll, taking the aircraft to potentially unsafe conditions, especially for rate command
response types. A safer technique is to establish a trimmed bank angle (< 60◦) and
apply a moderate step input in lateral cyclic, recovering before the aircraft has rolled to
the same bank in the opposite direction. The manoeuvre can now be repeated with in-
creasing control input sizes and several data points collected to establish the functional
relationship between the roll response and control step size. Applying this incremental
technique it will usually be unnecessary to test at the extremes of control input size.
Either the minimum requirements will have been met at lower input sizes or the re-
sponse will be clearly linear and extrapolation to full control is permissible. For the
cases requiring the highest control powers, e.g., air combat MTEs, it may be necessary
(safer) to capture the data in a closed-loop ﬂight test, e.g., with the aircraft ﬂown in an
air combat MTE. In both open- and closed-loop testing, two additional considerations
need to be taken into account. First, care should be taken to avoid the use of pedals
to augment the roll rate. In operational situations, the pilot may choose to do this to
increase performance, but it can obscure the measurement of roll control power. Sec-
ond, at high rotor thrust, the rotor blades can stall during aggressive manoeuvring, with
two effects. The loss of lift can reduce the roll control effectiveness and the increase
in drag can cause torque increases that lead to increased power demands. These are

 
374

real effects and if they inhibit the attainment of the minimum requirements then the
design is lacking. Because of the potentially damaging nature of the test manoeuvres
for control power estimation, online monitoring of critical rotor and airframe stresses
is desirable, if not essential.
Neither the civil handling requirements (Ref. 6.10), nor Def Stan 00970 (Ref.
6.9), refer to criteria for control power per se, but instead set minimum limits on
control margin in terms of aircraft response. This normally relates to the ability to
manoeuvre from trimmed ﬂight at the edge of the OFE. Def Stan 00970 deﬁnes control
margin in terms of the control available to generate a response of 15◦/s in 1.5 s.
The old MIL-H-8501A required that at the ﬂight envelope boundary, cyclic control
margins were enough to produce at least 10% of the maximum attainable hover roll
(or pitch) moment. The FAAs adopt a more ﬂexible approach on the basis that some
conﬁgurations have been tested where a 5% margin was sufﬁcient and others where
a 20% margin was inadequate (Ref. 6.13). Speciﬁcally, for FAA certiﬁcation, what is
required from ﬂight tests is a demonstration that at the never-exceed airspeed, ‘a lateral
control margin sufﬁcient to allow at least 30◦banked turns at reasonable roll rates’
must be demonstrated. ADS-33 is clearly more performance oriented when it comes
to setting minimum control power requirements, and this philosophy extends to the
moderate amplitude criteria, where the introduction of a new parameter, the manoeuvre
quickness, has taken ﬂying qualities well and truly into the nonlinear domain.
Moderate amplitude roll requirements broadly apply to manoeuvres within the
range −60◦< φ < 60◦that include military NoE MTEs, such as quick-stop, slalom, and
civil helicopter operations in harsh conditions, e.g., recovery to conﬁned areas in gusty
conditions and recovery following failed engine or SCAS. The development of attitude
quickness has already been discussed in some detail. The deﬁnition of quickness used
in ADS-33 has been developed to relate to non-pure response types and includes a
subtlety to account for oscillatory responses. Figure 6.17 shows the roll axis quickness
criteria boundaries from ADS-33, including the deﬁnition of the attitude parameters
required to derive quickness. Once again the task-oriented nature of ﬂying qualities
is highlighted by the fact that there are different boundary lines for different MTE
classes, even within the low-speed regime (see Ref. 6.5 for full details). Figure 6.18
shows the quickness envelope for the Lynx ﬂying a lateral sidestep compared with the
two Level 1 ADS-33 boundaries. The companion Fig. 6.19 illustrates the phase plane
portraits for the sidestep ﬂown at three levels of aggressiveness. Even in this relatively
small-scale MTE, roll rates of nearly 70◦/s are being used during the reversals (cf. Fig.
6.8). The sidestep task, ﬂown in low wind conditions, strictly relates to the ‘general
MTE’ class, indicating that the Lynx has at least a 60% task margin when ﬂying this
particular MTE. For the track boundary, the margin appears less, but it should be noted
that the sidestep task in low wind is not the most demanding of MTEs and the Lynx
will have a higher task margin than shown. To highlight this, Fig. 6.20 shows the roll
quickness envelope for Lynx ﬂying the lateral slalom MTE at 60 knots, with the ADS-
33 Level 1/2 boundaries for forward ﬂight MTEs. The rise in quickness to limiting
values occurred for this aircraft at the highest aspect ratio when the pilot reached the
lateral cyclic stops in the roll reversals. Lynx is particularly agile in roll and we see in
Fig. 6.20, possibly some of the highest values of quickness achievable with a modern
helicopter. The additional points on Fig. 6.18 will be discussed below.
The compliance testing for quickness depends on roll response type; with rate
command, a pulse-type input in lateral cyclic from the trim condition will produce a

discrete attitude change. As noted above, for a helicopter with linear response char-
acteristics, the quickness will be independent of input size and what is required is a
decrease in the cyclic pulse duration until the required level of response is attained.
In practice, the shorter the pulse, the larger the pulse amplitude has to be in order
to achieve a measurable response. Figure 6.21 illustrates ﬂight test results from the
DLR’s Bo105, showing different values of roll quickness achieved between 10◦and
20◦attitude change (Ref. 6.19). A maximum quickness of 4 rad/s was measured for
this aircraft at the lower limit of the moderate amplitude range. For longer duration
inputs, quickness values only just above the ADS-33 boundary were measured, as
shown, highlighting the importance of applying sharp enough inputs to establish the
Fig. 6.21 Roll attitude quickness measured on Bo105 at 80 knots (Ref. 6.19)

 
378

quickness margins. It should be remembered that for compliance demonstration with
ADS-33, all that is required is to achieve values in the Level 1 region.
For attitude response types, it may be necessary to overdrive initially the control
input, followed by a return to steady state consistent with the commanded attitude.
The control reversal is recommended to overcome the natural stability associated
with the attitude command response type, and a moderate amount is allowable to
achieve the maximum quickness.
The use of attitude quickness has some appeal in establishing control effectiveness
requirements for civil helicopter handling qualities. As with the military requirements,
however, establishing a test database from civil MTEs is essential before boundaries
can be set. One area that could be well served by quickness is the response characteris-
tics required to recover from SCAS failures; another could be the recovery from upsets
due to vortex wakes of ﬁxed-wing aircraft or other helicopters. Establishing quanti-
tative criteria in these areas could have direct impact on the integrity requirements
of the stability augmentation systems on the one hand and the operating procedures
of helicopters at airports on the other. One of the obvious beneﬁts of robust handling
criteria is that they can help to quantify such aspects at the design stage.
In Fig. 6.18, the additional data points shown are computed from the time histories
of sidestep data taken from tests conducted on the DRA advanced ﬂight simulator (Ref.
6.3). These and other MTE tests will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, but a
point worth highlighting here is the spread of quickness values in relation to the level
of aggression adopted by the pilot. The level of aggression was deﬁned by the initial
roll angle, and hence translational acceleration, ﬂown. High aggression corresponded
to roll angles of about 30◦, with hover thrust margins around 15%. At the lower
end of the moderate amplitude range (between 10◦and 20◦), the maximum quickness
achieved at low aggression was about 0.7, rad/s, which would correspond to the level of
performance necessary to ﬂy in UCE 2 or 3; ADS-33 states that meeting the quickness
requirements is not mandatory for these cases (Ref. 6.5). The moderate aggression
case would be typical of normal manoeuvring, and the maximum quickness achieved,
around 1.5 rad/s, conforms well with the ADS-33 minimum requirement boundary. At
the higher levels of aggression, quickness values correlate closely with those achieved
with the Lynx in ﬂight test at around 2.5 rad/s, a not-too-surprising result, as the
simulation trials were designed to explore the maximum achievable task performance
at similar thrust margins to the ﬂight trials.
The large and moderate amplitude criteria extend down to 10◦roll attitude. Be-
low this, in the small amplitude range, we can see from Fig. 6.18 that the quickness
measurements increase to values well beyond the moderate amplitude boundary. But
quickness is no longer an appropriate parameter in this region and we have to look at
a different formulation to measure ﬂying quality here.

Early efforts in the time domain
It would not be an exaggeration to say that handling qualities research, for both ﬁxed-
and rotary-wing aircraft, has concentrated on the short-term response to control inputs,
and the roll and pitch axes have absorbed most of the efforts within this research.
The primary piloting task under consideration in this region is attitude regulation,

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
379
Fig. 6.22 Handling qualities parameters from step response
appropriate to tracking tasks when ﬁne attitude corrections are required to maintain a
precise ﬂight trajectory or position. Most of the early work aimed at deﬁning quality
in this region focused on the response to step control inputs. Figure 6.22 illustrates the
key characteristics associated with the step response:
(1) control sensitivity – the initial angular acceleration per unit of control input (e.g., inch
of stick travel);
(2) rate sensitivity – the ﬁnal steady-state rate per unit of control input; more generally
this would be called response sensitivity to account for other response types;
(3) response time constant(s) – the time(s) to some proportion of the steady-state
response; for simple ﬁrst-order systems, the time constant t63% is sufﬁcient to
characterize the simple exponential growth;
(4) time delay – delay before there is a measurable aircraft response; this can be grouped
into category (3) but we separate it because of its special meaning;
(5) overshoot – ratio of successive peaks in oscillatory time response.
This list suggests that there needs to be at least ﬁve, and perhaps even more, handling
qualities parameters that characterize the rise times, sensitivities and damping of the
step control response in the time domain. Before we discuss the appropriateness of
this further, it is worth reviewing one particular criterion that had gained widespread
acceptance, prior to the publication of ADS-33 – the so-called damping/sensitivity
diagram (Fig. 6.23). The damping derivative L p(1/s) is plotted against the control
sensitivity derivative Lδy (rad/(s2 in)), where δy is the lateral cyclic stick displacement.
The use of derivatives in this criteria format stems from the assumption of a linear

 
380
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.23 Short-term roll handling qualities – damping/sensitivity boundaries (Ref. 6.20)
ﬁrst-order type response where these two parameters completely describe the time
response characteristics (L p is the inverse of t63%, and Lδy is the initial acceleration
of the step response function; the ratio of control sensitivity to damping gives the rate
sensitivity). On Fig. 6.23, taken from Ref. 6.20, we have drawn the various boundaries
set by data from previous experiments. While we have to recognize that boundary lines
on this two-parameter handling qualities chart will be task dependent, there is good
reason to believe that the wide spread of quality boundaries in Fig. 6.23 is actually a
signal that the criteria are not appropriate to short-term response criteria in general.
For simple ﬁrst-order systems, or classical roll rate response types easily modelled
in simulation, the contour shapes in the ﬁgure will be entirely appropriate. However,
there are two principal reasons why Fig. 6.23 is not generally applicable and hence the
situation does not meet the CACTUS rules:
(1) Short-term helicopter roll response is typically non-classical, with higher order
dynamics distorting the ﬁrst-order contributions.
(2) For tasks requiring the pilot to perform attitude regulation, there is strong evidence
that the pilot’s impression of handling qualities is not particularly sensitive to the
shape of the response to a step input.
With regard to the ﬁrst point, in the early unpublished versions of the revision to
MIL-H-8501, time domain step response criteria were proposed, based on ﬁxed-wing
experience, which included three rise time parameters and one overshoot parameter as
shown in Table 6.2.
This criteria set was based entirely on ﬂight data, largely gathered on the variable
stability Bell 205 operated by the Flight Research Laboratory in Ottawa; ground-based
simulator results were discounted because there were too many unresolved questions
about data from rate response types obtained from simulation. Reference 6.21, in sum-
marizing the contribution of the Canadian Flight Research Laboratory to the ADS-
33 effort, presents results showing the discrepancy between ground-based simulation
and in-ﬂight simulation results; the ground-based tests showed no signiﬁcant Level 1

achievement. The proposed time domain parameters in Table 6.2 were derived from
the limited ﬂight test results available at the time. The criteria proposed for attitude
command systems required the rise times to be a function of the effective damp-
ing ratio of the response, and were therefore even more complicated. The emphasis
on ﬁnding suitable time domain criteria for both roll and pitch attitude short-term
response was partly driven by the helicopter community’s familiarity with this for-
mat, stemming partly from the history of usage of MIL-H-8501A and the traditional
damping/sensitivity two-parameter handling qualities diagram. Had there not been a
potentially very effective alternative being developed in parallel with the time domain
parameters, the ADS-33 development may well have persisted with this kind of format.
Measurement problems aside (and these are potentially signiﬁcant), the reality
is that, although the step response function may be a simple clinical concept, pilots
rarely use step response control strategies in attitude regulation and tracking tasks, and
it was only a matter of time before the community became convincingly won over
to the frequency domain and the alternate proposal – the bandwidth criterion. Before
discussing bandwidth in some detail it is worth saying a few words about the archetypal
frequency domain approach – low-order equivalent systems (LOES), used extensively
in ﬁxed-wing handling criteria (Ref. 6.6). The argument goes that the higher frequency
ranges of vehicle dynamics characterizing the short-term responses are dominated
by the roll subsidence and short-period pitch modes. Obtaining frequency response
data, by exciting the aircraft around the natural frequencies, provides amplitude and
phase characteristics to which low-order equivalent systems can be ﬁtted numerically to
estimatenaturalfrequencyanddamping,forwhichqualityboundariescanbedeﬁnedon
two-parameterdiagrams.Theﬁxed-winghandlingrequirementsstatethatthisapproach
is not applicable to non-classical response types and offer the bandwidth criterion as
an alternate approach in these cases. It was recognized early on in the development
effort that the naturally non-classical behaviour of helicopters would exclude LOES
as a general candidate for roll and pitch response (Ref. 6.22), particularly for Level 2
and 3 conﬁgurations, and little research has been conducted in this area, at least for
roll response.
Bandwidth
In Ref. 6.23, Hoh describes results from a simulator assessment of attitude command
response types for a recovery to a ship MTE. The tests were conducted on the NASA
vertical motion simulator (VMS) speciﬁcally to evaluate the effectiveness of rise time
criteria. The step response characteristics of the different conﬁgurations tested are
shown in Fig. 6.24. An important result of the tests was that the three evaluation pi-
lots rated all the conﬁgurations within a fairly tight HQR spread. The pilots were

 
382

almost unaware of the different time domain characteristics for this precision landing
manoeuvre. What the conﬁgurations in Fig. 6.24 do have in common is the attitude
bandwidth, even though the damping ratio varies from 0.5 to 1.3. This is a very com-
pelling result and calls for a deﬁnition and description of this unique new handling
qualities parameter.
The bandwidth parameter is deﬁned in Fig. 6.25 as the lesser of two frequencies,
the phase-limited or gain-limited bandwidth, derived from the phase and gain of the

frequency response of attitude to pilot’s cyclic control. The phase bandwidth is given
by the frequency at which the phase is 135◦, i.e., the attitude lags behind the control
by 135◦. The gain bandwidth is given by the frequency at which the gain function
has increased by 6 dB relative to the gain when the phase is 180◦. The 180◦phase
reference is signiﬁcant because it represents a potential stability boundary for closed-
loop tracking control by the pilot. If a pilot is required to track a manoeuvring target or to
maintain tight ﬂight path control during turbulent conditions, then there are three related
problemsthathindercontroleffectiveness.First,athighenoughfrequencies,theaircraft
response will lag behind the pilot’s control input by 180◦, requiring the pilot to apply
signiﬁcant control lead to anticipate the tracked or disturbed motion (as the aircraft rolls
to port, the pilot must also apply lateral cyclic to port to cancel the motion). Second, at
higher frequencies the response becomes attenuated and, to achieve the same tracking
performance, the pilot has to increase his control gain. Third, and most signiﬁcant, any
natural lags in the feedback loop between an attitude error developing and the pilot
applying corrective cyclic control can result in the pilot–aircraft combination becoming
weakly damped or even unstable. The combination of these three effects will make all
air vehicles prone to PIOs above some disturbance frequency, and one of the aims of
the bandwidth criteria is to ensure that this frequency is well outside the range required
to ﬂy the speciﬁed MTEs with the required precision. Thus, a high phase–bandwidth
will ensure that the phase margin of 45◦, relative to the 180◦phase lag, is sufﬁcient
to allow the pilot to operate as a pure gain controller, accepting his own natural phase
lags, without threatening stability. The gain bandwidth limit protects against instability
should the pilot elect to increase his gain or his level of aggression at high frequency. Of
course, a skilful pilot can operate effectively well beyond the limits deﬁned by simple
theory, by applying more complex control strategies. This always leads to an increase
in workload and hence less spare capacity for the pilot to give attention to secondary
tasks, any of which could become primary at any time in consideration of overall safety
or survivability. For a wide range of systems, the phase bandwidth is equal to or less
than the gain bandwidth.
The bandwidth criteria apply in ADS-33 to both rate and attitude response-types,
except that for attitude response types, only the phase bandwidth applies. This nuance
leads us to examine the gain-limited bandwidth in a little more detail, following the
discussion in Ref. 6.24, where Hoh reports that the ‘. . . gain bandwidth is included
because a low value of gain margin tends to result in a conﬁguration that is PIO
prone. Low gain margin is a good predictor of PIO prone conﬁgurations because small
changes in the pilot gain result in a rapid reduction in phase margin’. An example of a
gain-limited bandwidth system is given in Ref. 6.24 and reproduced here as Fig. 6.26.
Here, there is a modest value of phase bandwidth, but the gain margin available to
the pilot when operating around this frequency, for example, to ‘tighten-up’ in an
effort to improve performance, is limited and considerably less than the 6 dB avail-
able at the gain bandwidth. Hoh describes the problem succinctly when he states that,
‘The phenomenon is insidious because it depends on pilot technique. A smooth, non-
aggressive pilot may never encounter the problem, whereas a more aggressive pilot
could encounter a severe PIO’. Hoh goes on to discuss the rationale for not including
the gain margin limit for attitude command systems. Basically, because the attitude
stabilization task is accomplished by the augmentation system, the pilot should not
be required to work at high gains with inner-loop attitude control. If he does, and ex-
periences a PIO tendency, then simply backing off from the tight control strategy

 
384
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.26 Example of a gain-margin limited system (Ref. 6.24)
will solve the problem. To conclude this discussion we quote further from Hoh
(Ref. 6.24):
We are faced with a dilemma: on the one hand gain-margin-limited ACAH response
types lead to PIO for super precision tasks, and on the other, disallowing such conﬁg-
urations robs the pilot of workload relief for many other, less aggressive, MTEs. The
approach taken herein (in the ADS-33C spec) has been to eliminate gain margin from
the deﬁnition of bandwidth for ACAH response types, but to recommend avoidance of
ACAH systems where the gain bandwidth is less than the phase bandwidth, especially
if super precision tasks are required. Additional motivation for not including gain
bandwidth as a formal requirement for ACAH was that the PIO due to gain margin
limiting has not been found to be as violent for ACAH response types. It should
be emphasised that this is not expected to be the case for rate or RCAH response
types, where the pilot attitude closure is necessary to maintain the stable hover, and
consequently, it is not possible to completely ‘back out’ of the loop. Therefore gain
bandwidth is retained for these response types.
Gain-margin-limited systems result from a large phase delay, combined with
ﬂat amplitude characteristics such as shown in Fig. 6.27. Large phase delays usually
result from inherent rotor system time delay (65 to 130 ms), combined with computer
throughput delays, actuator lags, ﬁlters, etc. The ﬂat amplitude characteristic is, of

385
Fig. 6.27 Pilot as sensor and motivator in a task feedback loop
course, inherent to ACAH, and can occur in RCAH response types due to the nature
of feedforward equalization.
Another interpretation of bandwidth can be gleaned from its origins out of the devel-
opment of the so-called crossover model of human pilot behaviour (Ref. 6.25), which
treats the pilot action in performing tracking control tasks as an element in a feedback
loop (Fig. 6.27). In single-axis tasks, for a wide variety of aircraft dynamic character-
istics, the pilot adapts his control strategy so that the product of the pilot and aircraft
dynamics take the simple transfer function form
Yp(s)Ya(s) ≈ωce−τs
s
(6.10)
Therefore, for example, if the rate response is a simple ﬁrst-order lag, then the pilot will
compensate by applying a simple lead with approximately the same time constant as
the response lag. This form of overall open-loop characteristic will be applicable over
a range of frequencies depending on the application. A key property of this form of
model is highlighted by the root locus diagram of its stability characteristics when in a
closed-loop system (Fig. 6.28). The pilot can increase the overall gain ωc to regulate the
Fig. 6.28 Root locus of crossover model eigenvalues as pilot gain is increased

 
386

performance of the tracking task, but doing so will degrade the stability of the closed-
loop system. The pure time delay, caused by mental processing and neuromuscular
lags, is represented by the exponential function in the complex plane (i.e., Laplace
transform) that has an inﬁnite number of poles in the left-hand transfer function plane.
The smallest of these moves to the right as the pilot gain is increased in the crossover
model links up with the left moving rate-like pole, and the pair eventually become
neutrally stable, with 180◦phase shift, at the so-called crossover frequency as shown
in Fig. 6.28. This simple but very effective model of human pilot behaviour has been
shown to work well for small amplitude single-axis tracking tasks and leads to the
concept of a natural stability margin deﬁned by the gain or phase margin from the
point of neutral stability. This is the origin of the bandwidth criteria.
Phase delay
The quality of ﬂying in the small amplitude–high frequency range of our framework
diagram was initially encapsulated in a single-parameter bandwidth. Unfortunately,
the situation turned out more complicated and it was not long before cases of equi-
bandwidth conﬁgurations with widely varying handling qualities were found. Again,
Hoh sheds light on this in Refs 6.23 and 6.24. For a wide variety of systems there
is a unique relationship between the bandwidth frequency and the shape of the phase
curve in the frequency domain beyond the bandwidth frequency. The steeper the phase
‘roll-off’, then the lower the bandwidth and, with relatively simple high-order effects
like transport delays and actuator lags, the increasing phase slope correlates directly
with bandwidth. However, for more general high-order dynamics, the phase delay
has to be computed as an independent measure of handling, since conﬁgurations with
markedly different phase slope can have the same bandwidth. A case is cited in Ref. 6.24
where two conﬁgurations with the same bandwidth were rated as Level 2 and 3, simply
because the phase slopes were very different (Fig. 6.29). Pilots are particularly sensitive
to the slope of the phase at high frequency, well beyond the bandwidth frequency but
still within the range of piloting, e.g., >10 rad/s. In a closed-loop tracking task, when
high precision is required, pilots will ﬁnd that high values of phase slope make it very
difﬁcult for them to adapt their control strategy to even small changes in frequency,
Fig. 6.29 Sensitivity of HQRs to phase characteristics at frequencies beyond ωbw (Ref. 6.24)

387
hence task disturbance. This and related effects reinforce the point that for tracking
tasks the pilot is very sensitive to effects easily described in the frequency domain
but hardly noticeable as delays following step inputs. The actual parameter selected to
represent the shape of the phase is the phase delay, τp, deﬁned as
τp =

2ω180
57.3 × 2ω180
(6.11)
where 
2ω180 is the phase change between ω180 and 2ω180. The phase delay is
therefore related to the slope of the phase between the crossover frequency and 2ω180.
Reference 6.5 notes that if the phase is nonlinear in this region, then the phase delay can
be determined from a linear least-squares curve ﬁt, in a similar way to the computation
of equivalent time delay in LOES analysis.
Bandwidth/phase delay boundaries
The ADS-33C quality boundaries for bandwidth and phase delay are presented on two-
parameter handling qualities diagrams as shown in Figs 6.30(a)–(c), corresponding to
the different MTE classes shown; the roll axis boundaries are applicable both to low
speed and to forward ﬂight regimes. The references provided in the legend to each ﬁgure
record the supporting data from which the boundaries were developed. It is probably
true that more effort has been applied, and continues to be applied, to deﬁning these
boundaries than any other. The criteria are novel and considerable effort was required to
convince the manufacturing community in particular that the frequency domain criteria
were more appropriate than the time domain parameters. The lower, vertical portions
of each boundary indicate the minimum acceptable bandwidths, with tracking and air-
combat MTEs demanding the highest at 3.5 rad/s for Level 1. The curved and upper
portions of the boundaries indicate the general principle that the higher the bandwidth,
the higher is the acceptable phase delay, the one compensating for the other.
It may seem surprising that Level 1 handling qualities are possible with phase
delays of more than 300 ms. Two points need to be made about this feature. First, a
study of the references will indicate that, although the data in these areas is very sparse,
they genuinely indicate the trends shown. Second, it would be practically impossible
to build a helicopter with a bandwidth of, say, 3 rad/s and with a phase delay of 300 ms
(Fig. 6.30(b)); the latter would almost certainly drive the bandwidth down to less than
1 rad/s. This dependence of bandwidth on the same parameters that have a ﬁrst-order
effect on phase delay is perhaps the only weakness of this two-parameter handling
qualities diagram. The point is illustrated in Fig. 6.31, which shows the contours of
equi-damping and time delay overlaid on the UCE 1 roll bandwidth boundaries. The
contours are derived from a simple, rate response ‘conceptual handling qualities model’
(Refs 6.3, 6.35), which can be written in transfer function form

where K is the overall gain or, in this case, the rate sensitivity, τ is a pure time delay;
ωm can be considered to be equivalent to the roll damping, −L p. The results in Fig.
6.31 show that the addition of a pure time delay can have a dramatic effect on both
bandwidth and phase delay. With τ set to zero, the bandwidth would be equal to ωm.

ations (pitch and roll) (Refs 6.33, 6.34)
Therefore, a 70-ms pure time delay can reduce the bandwidth of a 12 rad/s aircraft
(e.g., with hingeless rotor) down to 4 rad/s. The bandwidth reduction is much less
signiﬁcant on helicopters with low roll damping (e.g., with teetering rotors); the same
lags reduce the bandwidth of a 3 rad/s aircraft to about 1.9 rad/s. Note that, according to
Fig. 6.30(a), deﬁning the roll bandwidth requirements for tracking tasks, a bandwidth
of 4 rad/s corresponds to Level 1 while a bandwidth of 1.9 rad/s corresponds to Level 3.
The model similar to that described by eqn 6.12 was used to investigate the ef-
fects of different levels of pilot aggression, or task bandwidth, on the position of the
handling qualities boundaries in Fig. 6.31, using the DRA advanced ﬂight simulator
(AFS) (Ref. 6.3). The results will be presented later in the discussion on subjec-
tive measurement of quality in Chapter 7, but the test results conﬁrmed the ADS-
33C boundaries to within 0.5 HQR, up to moderate levels of aggression. The re-
search reported in Ref. 6.3 was part of a larger European ACT programme aimed at

establishing guidelines for the handling characteristics of future ACT helicopters (Ref.
6.36). This international programme made complementary use of ground-based and
in-ﬂight simulation facilities. Of particular concern was the effect of transport delays
introduced by the digital computing associated with ACT, and tests were conducted
to try to establish whether the curved boundaries on the ADS-33C criteria would still
be appropriate. In a similar time frame a new series of ﬂight and simulator tests was
conducted under the US Army/German MoU to check the location of the upper phase
delay boundaries (Ref. 6.37). A new lateral slalom task was derived that contained tight
tracking elements that could potentially discern PIO tendencies. Both the EuroACT
and US/GE research derived results that suggested a levelling of the phase delay bound-
ary between 100 and 150 ms would be required. Figure 6.32 summarizes the results,
showing the recommended phase delay caps from the two evaluations. At the time of
writing, these recommendations are regarded as tentative, although they have led to a
revision of the ‘ofﬁcial’ requirements, appearing in the latest version of ADS-33 (ADS-
33D, Ref. 6.38), as shown in Fig. 6.33. The reduction in phase delay is accompanied
by a relaxation in the bandwidth requirement for roll tracking tasks. The evolution of
these criteria illustrates once again the powerful effect of task on handling qualities
and the strong design driver that handling qualities will be for future ACT helicopters.
Civil applications
The bandwidth criterion aims to discern handling qualities that avoid or exacerbate the
problems that some pilots experience when ‘tightening-up’ in a closed-loop compen-
satory tracking task. For obvious reasons this high precision/performance criterion has

broad application across military helicopter uses. Considering civil helicopter design,
certiﬁcation and operations, there are several application areas that could potentially
beneﬁt from bandwidth (Ref. 6.39). Precise positioning of an underslung load is a
good example, although even the military requirements are, at the time of writing,
fairly immature in this area. All-weather operations requiring recoveries to moving
decks is another example. The whole area of search and rescue is one where civil (and
military) helicopters can be ﬂown close to the pilot’s limits, with the requirements for
precise positioning in conﬁned spaces. With safety as an emphasis in civil helicopter
operations, the case for introducing civil MTEs that include high-precision elements
into the certiﬁcation process is considered to be strong. The future application of ACT
to civil helicopters, with the potential for increased phase delay, will strengthen this
case; it is far better to highlight potential problems in certiﬁcation than to experience
them for the ﬁrst time in operation. Of course, one of the great strengths of substanti-
ated criteria, like bandwidth, is that they can be used in the design process to ensure

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
391
satisfactory ﬂying qualities are built in, with the aim of making the certiﬁcation process
a formality.
The measurement of bandwidth
One of the failings of time domain criteria arises when trying to make accurate
measurements of the rise times in the step response. While it is relatively easy and
economical to apply a step input, the shapes of the rate and attitude response are very
sensitive to the detailed form of the control input, and aircraft initial conditions. Errors
in rise time computation, particularly for the smaller values (O(0.1 s)), can be large.
Since the signiﬁcant handling qualities parameter is actually the slope of the phase,
any errors in rise time calculation will reﬂect in a poor estimation of the high frequency
phase. On the other hand, the frequency response function is fairly robust to analysis,
although considerably more calculation effort is required, and frequency response
data are more difﬁcult and far more time consuming to capture in ﬂight test. Since
the ﬁrst publication of ADS-33 in the mid-1980s, considerable experience has been
gained in the measurement of bandwidth and phase delay in ﬂight (Refs 6.40–6.49).
The recommended test input is a sine wave form with gradually increasing frequency
applied at the pilot’s controls. Figure 6.34 illustrates a roll axis frequency ‘sweep’

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
showing the pilot’s control position and aircraft roll rate response for the Bo105
from a test speed of 80 knots. The test manoeuvre is complete in about 1 min, the
pilot uses about 10–15% of the control range and the roll rate is contained within the
range ±20◦/s.
From the accumulated knowledge of frequency sweeping, a number of rules of
thumb can be applied when designing and conducting a ﬂight test. These concern both
safety and performance aspects and are now addressed in turn.
(1) Frequency range
The range of frequencies covered in the sweep need only be high
enough to capture the phase characteristics up to twice the 180◦phase lag frequency.
Unfortunately, this latter frequency may not be known precisely prior to the test, and
experience has shown that it can vary widely across different types, e.g., 22 rad/s on
the Bo105 (Ref. 6.43) and 12 rad/s on the OH-58D (Refs 6.41, 6.42). Also, there may
be only limited data available on the airframe/rotor structural modes within this
frequency range. It is therefore very important to establish the upper frequency limit
and the inﬂuence on structural modes very carefully with exploratory test inputs
before applying a full frequency sweep. Reference 6.42 recommends a frequency
range of 0.1–2 Hz, but clearly this is inadequate for higher bandwidth helicopters like
the Bo105.
(2) Maintaining trim – instability
One of the principal problems with the frequency
sweeping of helicopters without stability augmentation is their natural tendency to
diverge from the trim condition, particularly during the low-frequency portion of the
sweep input. If this is allowed to happen, then clearly the validity of the data is
questionable; the engineer can no longer relate the computed bandwidth to a
particular ﬂight condition, and nonlinear effects are likely to spoil the overall quality
of the data. The pilot needs to apply ‘uncorrelated’ corrective inputs, superimposed
on the sweep, to keep the aircraft manoeuvring about the trim condition. This can
sometimes be very difﬁcult if not impossible to accomplish satisfactorily, particularly
close to hover or for pitch axis sweeps at high speed. In cases where the natural
stability of the aircraft is so poor that frequency sweeping is not practicable, then it
may well be necessary to deduce the open-loop, bare-airframe, characteristics from
sweep results with the SCAS engaged.
(3) Cross-coupling
While cross-coupling, in itself, is not a problem during frequency
sweeping, it has become a practice for pilots to negate the cross-coupled motion with
control inputs, primarily to preserve the mean trim condition. For example, the pitch
and yaw moments generated during a roll sweep can soon give rise to large ﬂight-
path excursions. Even assuming the pilot is able to apply perfect cancelling inputs
there are two data contamination effects that will need to be taken into account. First,
the roll response will no longer be due to the lateral cyclic only, but there will be
components at various frequencies due to the cross-control inputs. These can, in
principle, be extracted using conditional frequency analysis (see below), effectively
deriving the secondary frequency characteristics as well as the primary. Second, any
correlation between the primary and secondary control inputs will make it very
difﬁcult to separate out the primary frequency response, even using the conditional
techniques. As noted above, one solution is to apply corrective cross-coupled control
inputs that are uncorrelated with the primary axis, e.g., occasional pulse-type inputs
to recover airspeed, pitch attitude or sideslip.

393
(4) Control amplitude
The magnitude of the control input is a compromise between
achieving the highest signal-to-noise ratio to maximize the information content, and
minimizing the excursions from trim and the potential for exciting dangerous loads.
It has been found that there is a natural tendency for the inexperienced pilot to
increase the control amplitudes as the frequency increases, in order to maintain the
same overall amplitude of aircraft response. This should reduce with training (see
point (7)). A general rule of thumb is that the control inputs should be kept to within
±10% of full control throw.
(5) Repeats
Repeat runs are always required in ﬂying qualities tests to ensure that at
least one good data point is captured; for frequency sweeping, the recommended
minimum number of repeats is two, to provide at least two quality runs for averaging
in the frequency analysis.
(6) Duration
The time duration of a frequency sweep depends on the frequency range
to be covered, primarily the lower limit, and the rate of change of frequency.
Assuming the latter to be about 0.1 Hz, experience has shown that sweep durations
between 50 and 100 s are typical. Constraining factors will be the natural stability of
the aircraft, inﬂuencing the time spent at low frequencies, and the rotor speed, largely
inﬂuencing the upper limit.
(7) Training and practice
One of the most important safety factors that can be included
in a frequency sweep test programme is an adequate level of training for pilots. First,
there is the simple matter of training pilots to apply a slowly varying sine wave with
an amplitude of perhaps ±1 cm. Experience has shown that pilots new to sweeping
tend to increase the amplitude of the controls as the frequency increases and they are
not always aware that this is happening. Also, it is very difﬁcult for a pilot to judge
what is a 2-, 3- or 4-Hz input without experience. Ideally, the pilot would initiate his
or her training by following through on the controls while the instructor applied the
sweep with the aircraft on the ground. Sweeps on all controls could be taught this
way to give the pilot a feel for the kind of hand and feet motion required. The pilot
could then practice with a display providing feedback on the frequency and
amplitude. After the trainee pilot is conﬁdent in his or her ability to apply the input
shape, the training can continue in the simulator and eventually in ﬂight, where the
pilot needs to practice before the deﬁnitive inputs are made. Practising gives the pilot
knowledge about what corrective inputs are required in other axes to maintain the
aircraft close to the reference ﬂight condition. Practising also allows the engineers
conducting the structural loads monitoring to guide the trial better. But pilot-applied
frequency sweeps are best done with two crew, one applying the input, the other
calling the tune.
(8) Manual or automated inputs – it takes two to sweep
In theory, it should be possible
to design a frequency sweep for application through an automatic control input
device that has superior properties to a manual input, e.g., repeatability, and better
deﬁned frequency content. However, the sweeping experience to date, especially
with unstabilized helicopters, indicates that manual inputs are to be preferred,
because of the increased ﬂexibility in uncertain situations; and the more irregular
shapes to the manual inputs actually have a richer information content. This
situation has to improve in favour of the auto-inputs with time, but it should be
remembered that the bandwidth frequency relates to the attitude response to the
pilot’s stick input and not to the control servo input. With auto-inputs applied at the

 
394
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
servo actuator, the additional transfer function between stick and servo would
still need to be determined. Experience at the DRA with manual frequency sweeping
has emphasized the value of the second crew member providing timing assistance
to the pilot by counting out with rhythm, particularly at the lower frequencies.
Counting out periods of 20, 16, 12, 8, 4 and 2 s helps the pilot to concentrate on
applying a series of sine waves at increasing frequencies. At higher frequencies the
pilot needs to rely on a learned technique, the counting then being a signiﬁcant
distraction.
(9) Load monitoring for structural resonances
Frequency sweeping can damage a
helicopter’s health and it is important to take this warning seriously. However, with
the right preparations and precautions, the damage can be controlled and quantiﬁed.
Some of the precautions have already been discussed under the headings of
frequency range and amplitude, but it is important to know as much as possible about
potential structural resonances before embarking on this kind of test input. In the
case of a new aircraft, it is prudent to establish the rotor/fuselage coupled modes
using the structural test development aircraft prior to making the bandwidth
measurements. However, most of the testing carried out in the late 1980s was
conducted on experimental aircraft, sometimes without a thorough analysis of
potential resonances. Tests conducted by the US Army on the AH-64A and OH-58D
(Ref. 6.42) revealed several potential problems. A divergent vertical bounce was
experienced during longitudinal cyclic hover sweeps in the AH-64 at about 5 Hz.
Damaged tail rotor support components were found following yaw axis sweeps,
again on the AH-64. On the OH-58D, sweep tests excited an oscillation in the mast
mounted sight, which was not felt by the crew, but only detected visually by the crew
of the chase aircraft and through the telemetry at the ground station.
Earlier, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the ﬁrst UK sweep tests were
conducted with the research Puma ﬁtted with a full fatigue usage monitoring strain
gauge ﬁt (Ref. 6.45). Higher fatigue usage was encountered in pitch axis sweeps in
forward ﬂight, and although we are still discussing the roll axis, the results are of
such general signiﬁcance in understanding the role of load monitoring that they are
presented here. The tests were conducted to derive equivalent low-order system
models for pitch axis dynamics (reported in Refs 6.28 and 6.45), but the test inputs
were essentially the same as for the bandwidth measurement. Figure 6.35(a)
illustrates two longitudinal cyclic frequency sweeps, one with the SCAS engaged,
the other disengaged, captured at 60 knots airspeed. The additional data are the
normal acceleration at the fuselage ﬂoor and the stress in the forward gearbox strut,
derived from the component strain, which transpired to be the most critical for the
pitch manoeuvre. The control input is maintained within the recommended range and
the control frequency spectrum is primarily below 2 Hz, the required test upper limit.
The larger response at the lower frequencies with the SCAS disengaged is noted.
Figure 6.35(b) shows results at 100 knots, for two cases, one where the frequency
range was limited to 2 Hz, the second where it was extended to 4 Hz. In the second
case, the crew experienced signiﬁcant vertical bounce at the higher end of the range.
The normal acceleration record shows amplitude excursions of ±0.25 g at high
frequency. A combination of real-time monitoring through a telemetry link to a
ground station coupled with post-ﬂight fatigue life accumulation analysis revealed
the extent of the damage done during these tests. Figure 6.36 shows data for one
ﬂight (Flt No 728) comprising nine sweeps over the speed range 60–120 knots. The

ﬁgure shows the percentage of the never-exceed fatigue load level, the so-called
β-level, in the forward gear box strut and the fatigue life usage across the speed
range, for both SCAS-in and SCAS-out. A striking result is that the SCAS-out
manoeuvres were less damaging than the SCAS-in manoeuvres. The SCAS-in sweep
at 120 knots resulted in gearbox strut loads within 5% of the β-level. The single
triangle point at 100 knots corresponds to the case shown in Fig. 6.35(b), when the
frequency range was extended to 4 Hz, again taking the load close to the limit. At the
higher speeds, component life was being fatigued at the rate of more than
40 h/min. Following these tests, the calculation of the fatigue life used during ﬂight
728 revealed that more than 11 h of life had been used in just nine sweeps.
Accumulated life over the period of the tests indicated that the gearbox mounts were
prematurely approaching their 2000-h limit. The aircraft was grounded while the
gearbox mounts and other related components were replaced.
The lessons learned during these ﬁrst few years of sweeping suggest that load
monitoring, preferably in real time, is the safest precaution against undue structural
damage. This requirement elevates the risk level associated with ﬂying qualities
testing, placing increased instrumentation demands on prototype aircraft. However,
as will be discussed in the sections on subjective assessment in Chapter 7, ﬂying

397
MTEs can also incur larger than usual fatigue life usage. The new approach to ﬂying
qualities criteria and test, epitomized by ADS-33, is clearly much more than just a
new cookbook.
(10) Incrementally safe
This ﬁnal rule attempts to sum up the approach by emphasizing
the importance to safety of engaging with frequency sweeping in an incremental
manner, increasing frequency and amplitude only when conﬁdence has been gained
at lower values.
These ten rules have been laboured because of the novelty and the safety implications
associated with frequency sweeping and because of the lack of guidance in the open
literature. A frequency sweep is a ﬂying qualities test but it shares many of the same
characteristics as a loads test. Indeed, it might be argued that a rotor/airframe loads
scan using the same test technique would yield valuable data for the stress engineers
to conduct their part of the airframe qualiﬁcation. It seems only natural, and certainly
economical, to combine the activities in one test programme for a new aircraft, hence
elevating the safety issues involved in bandwidth testing to the proper level.
Estimating ωbw and τp
Having measured the frequency response of the aircraft to control excitation, the
remaining task is to estimate the bandwidth and phase delay from graphical repre-
sentations of the amplitude and phase of the response as shown in Fig. 6.25. But
how do we ensure that the estimated frequency response functions are as accurate as
possible or even valid? The frequency response analysis, whereby the time response
data are converted into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
technique (Ref. 6.50), assumes that the input–output relationship is approximately
linear and that any ‘noise’ on the signals is random and uncorrelated with the re-
sponse. Both of these assumptions break down to some degree in practice and it is
important to process the time histories systematically to calibrate the data quality. The
linear FFT converts a sweep time history of, say, roll rate of duration T, into a com-
plex function of frequency (with in-phase and quadrature components) given by the
relation
p(ω, T ) =
T

0
p(t) e−jωt dt
(6.13)
The minimum frequency in the transformed function is related to the time duration of
the sweep by the simple function
ωmin = 2π
T
(6.14)
In practice, with digitized data, the transformation is conducted discretely, over the
time response samples pn, measured every

The frequency response functions H for all required input–output pairs (e.g., η1c, p)
can be assembled from the spectral density functions G (Ref. 6.50) as
Hη1c p(ω) = Gη1c p(ω)
Gη1cη1c(ω)
(6.16)
A measure of accuracy of the derived frequency response function in terms of the linear

Anycoherenceless thanunitysigniﬁesthepresenceofnonlinearitiesorcorrelatednoise
on the response. In close-to-ideal conditions, the computations given by eqns 6.15 and
6.16 will generate frequency response data from which good estimates of bandwidth
and phase delay can be derived. In practice, further and more detailed processing is
often required to ensure that the handling qualities parameter estimates are the best
obtainable. In Ref. 6.51, Tischler and Cauffman discuss the details as implemented in
the US Army’s CIPHER analysis software, involving concatenation of multiple sweeps
in the time domain and windowing to derive the best estimates of the individual power
spectra. A second stage involves the derivation of the conditional frequency responses
to take account of the effects of corrective control inputs in secondary axes. The
associated partial coherence functions serve as a guide to the accuracy of the results
and the linearity of the input–output relationships. The third stage in the data quality
improvement ensures that the degrading effects of noise on the data are minimized.
Effectively, composite frequency responses are derived from averaging with different
data ‘window’ sizes in the frequency domain – small for the high-frequency range and
large for the lower frequencies. A rough rule of thumb for data validity is given when
the coherence function exceeds 0.8.
The calculation of bandwidth and phase delay follows according to the procedure
given in Fig. 6.25. Most of the data improvement process described above is actually
aimed at raising the coherence in the critical frequency range between ω180 and 2ω180,
where the phase delay is computed. An accurate estimate of phase delay is clearly
important to deﬁne the handling qualities, but measuring the slope from the phase
roll-off is not always straightforward. Reference 6.41 describes how the least-squares
ﬁt of the phase line had to be restricted to avoid being distorted by a high-frequency
phase drop due to a rotor structural mode.

handling qualities in the small amplitude regime. The supporting test and analysis
methodologies have received considerable attention since the initial debate on the
merits of time and frequency domain methods, and the extensive, and more general,
coverage given to the topic in this roll control section reﬂects the level of effort and
importance given to the bandwidth concept by the rotorcraft community.

In the characterization of helicopter response portrayed by the framework dia-

prior to the publication of ADS-33 – the control sensitivity, and before leaving

small amplitude dynamics, it is important to discuss the apparent demise of this
parameter.
Control sensitivity
Control sensitivity is a measure of the initial angular acceleration of the aircraft fol-
lowing a step input command, is traditionally measured in rad/s2 in, and is recognized
as a primary parameter affecting pilot opinion of aircraft handling. ADS-33 does not
dispute this but says that, ‘all controller sensitivities shall be consistent with the air-
craft dynamic response characteristics in each axis at all ﬂight conditions’; no criteria
for the acceleration sensitivity are given. This is not difﬁcult to live with for simple
ﬁrst-order-type responses where the control sensitivity is given by the product of the
bandwidth and control power. In simple derivative language, the sensitivity would then
be related to the control derivative through the control gearing, i.e.,
(θ1c max)Lθ1c = −ps L p
(6.18)
For simple response types, the requirements on sensitivity are therefore deﬁned by
those for response characteristics already discussed. The most obvious interpretation
of this relationship was given by Edenborough and Wernicke (Ref. 6.53) who ﬁrst at-
tempted to deﬁne requirements for roll control characteristics for combat helicopters.
The boundary lines are shown in the earlier Fig. 6.23, with a minimum sensitivity
level of 1 rad/(s2 in) and an increasing range of acceptable sensitivities for increasing
roll damping. The upper limits on sensitivity reﬂect the fact that the initial response
can be too jerky as well as too sluggish. In Fig. 6.23, the boundaries from a variety
of different studies, conducted over the last few decades, illustrate the wide range of
sensitivity that appears to be acceptable. In Ref. 6.54, Pausder and Von Grunhagen
map quality boundaries onto a similar diagram, based on ﬂight data from the DLR
ACT Bo105, replacing roll damping with bandwidth (Fig. 6.37). This would seem
to be the most suitable format for relating the short-term response to the sensitivity
but, like all the other criteria we have discussed, will almost certainly have differ-
ent boundary lines for different types of MTEs. Note that the minimum bandwidths
for Level 1 and 2 handling qualities do not conform to the ADS-33C boundaries. A
second series of in-ﬂight experiments to explore sensitivity boundaries is reported in
Ref. 6.55, based on tests with the Canadian ACT Bell 205. The authors of this work
argue that a more meaningful measure of sensitivity is the rate sensitivity (measured
in ◦/(s in)), rather than the control sensitivity. Note that on Figs 6.23 and 6.37, the rate
sensitivity is constant along radial lines. The results presented in Ref. 6.55 conﬁrm that
there is a range of acceptable sensitivities for given bandwidth, but with much sharper

degradations for reducing sensitivity than increasing. This may reﬂect the difference
between conﬁgurations that are becoming impossible to ﬂy and those that are merely
difﬁcult. One thing that seems clear from all studies on sensitivity is that the lower the
bandwidth, the narrower the range of acceptable sensitivities. The results in Fig. 6.37
suggest that the Level 1 boundary may be a closed contour, as postulated by Edenbor-
ough and Wernicke (Ref. 6.53), reﬂecting the potential for having an over-responsive
aircraft. To date, insufﬁcient attention has been given to this topic to give clear guidance,
but there are parallels with ﬁxed-wing ﬂying qualities where very high-performance
ﬁghter aircraft do have prescribed upper limits on sensitivity and bandwidth (Ref. 6.6).
But there is another major inﬂuence on the quality of control or rate sensitivity –
the characteristics of the pilot’s controller or inceptor. Even conventional centre sticks
can vary in shape and size and, given the control power requirements, the sensitivity
is dependent on the size of the control throw. With the advent of sidestick controllers,
the sensitivity requirements have become even more complicated. Early research into
sidesticks for helicopters soon established the need for nonlinear shaping of the re-
sponse/control deﬂexion relationship (Refs 6.56–6.58). For small displacement con-
trollers with linear response gradients, pilots ﬁnd that the sensitivity for small amplitude
inputs is too high to allow smooth control actions, and a much reduced gradient near
centre is required. To allow a high control power to be achieved at maximum control
throw, the gradient will then typically have to increase several-fold with the possibility
of too high a sensitivity at larger displacements. There are many ﬂying qualities issues
that are accentuated with sidesticks, and we devote more discussion to these in Chapter
7. So we leave sensitivity, a vital inﬂuence but still something of a mystery, with very
little data to substantiate well-deﬁned quality boundaries. Perhaps it is as well that
such a critical parameter is left for the engineer and pilot to optimize in the design
phase.
Staying with small amplitude motions we now increase the timescale to discuss
a facet of helicopter ﬂying qualities that is perhaps the most notorious, if not the most
critical, of all – stability.

Small amplitude/low to moderate frequency: dynamic stability
Stability is important in any dynamic system, and for helicopters this is reﬂected in the
need for the aircraft to not diverge from its trim condition if the pilot’s controls are left
momentarily unattended. The theoretical foundation for dynamic stability has already
been covered in detail in Chapter 4, and the reader is referred there for discussions on
modes of motion and associated eigenvalues. Stability was discussed in terms of the
character of the response to small disturbances and the tendency of the aircraft to return
to or depart from equilibrium. One of the problems encountered when discussing sta-
bility criteria in separated axes form is that the natural modes of motion are generally
coupled and the roll DoF actually appears in most. However, there is often, but not
always, a single dominant axis per mode and this appears the most logical manner by
which to approach the discussion. With this rationale we discuss the lateral/directional
oscillatory mode under the yaw axis stability and the pitch–roll long period oscilla-
tion under pitch axis stability, although both have implications on roll stability. The
remaining mode for which there are stability concerns is the roll–yaw spiral and we
choose to discuss relevant criteria in this section.
The characteristics of the spiral mode will determine the tendency of the aircraft to
return to or depart from a level trim condition following a perturbation in roll. Spiral and
Dutch roll stability are naturally at variance with one another so that a strongly stable
spiral mode will result in an attitude command response type in roll, accompanied by
a strong excitation of a weakly stable, or even unstable, roll–sideslip oscillation during
simple uncoordinated turns. Criteria relating to the roll–sideslip coupling are discussed
in Section 6.7 and, of course, the Dutch roll stability itself in Section 6.5. ADS-33 sets
the handling boundaries on the time-to-double amplitude of the roll angle following a
pulse input in lateral cyclic; i.e.
Level 1:
td > 20 s
Level 2:
td > 12 s
Level 3:
td > 4 s
The degree of spiral stability can be demonstrated qualitatively by the ‘turns on one
control’ technique. Having established a trim condition, lateral cyclic is used to roll
the aircraft to a small bank angle. Speed is held constant with longitudinal cyclic and
the lateral cyclic retrimmed to hold the new bank angle and turn rate; pedal and col-
lective are held ﬁxed. The manoeuvre is repeated in the opposite direction and for a
range of increasing bank angles. Similar tests can be performed using yaw pedals to
initiate and trim in the turn. For both tests, the control deﬂexion required to maintain
the steady turn gives a direct indication of the spiral stability. If out-of-turn control is
required then the aircraft exhibits spiral instability; conversely, if into-turn control is
required then the aircraft is spirally stable. Recalling the linearized derivative theory
in Chapter 4 and combining terms in the rolling and yawing equations of motion in a
steady turn, the control perturbations can be written as

moments generated by the helicopter’s pitch rate in the turn can be neglected. The
numerator in the above equations is the spiral stability parameter derived in Chapter 4.
From the test results, only the ratio of this parameter with the control derivatives can
be obtained as a function of ﬂight condition, and the inclusion of the rolling moment
due to pedal complicates the analysis. The spiral stability test technique recommended
by the FAA (Refs 6.10, 6.13) involves establishing an out-of-balance trim, returning
controls to the level trim position and measuring the bank angle response. Refer-
ence 6.13 states that the time for the bank angle to pass 20◦should not be so short
as to cause the aircraft to have objectionable ﬂight characteristics in the IFR envi-
ronment (UCE >1). For unstable aircraft, the time-to-double amplitude should be at
least 9 s.
As we examine handling qualities boundaries based on stability for other axes,
we shall see that pilots can tolerate some degree of instability in the long period modes
of helicopter motion, particularly during attentive ﬂight phases. But before the aircraft
even moves, the pilot will be concerned about the ability to establish and maintain
trim. We now come to the ﬁnal area on our response diagram, encompassing trim and
classical quasi-static stability.
6.3.5
Trim and quasi-static stability
A key ﬂying qualities concern relates to the ability to trim a helicopter with adequate
control margins remaining for manoeuvring, throughout the OFE. We have already
discussed aspects of control adequacy in the section on control power but this can
now be expanded in an examination of the roll axis. Just as with dynamic stabil-
ity, however, it is difﬁcult to discuss roll motion in isolation. The ease with which
a pilot can coordinate entry to a turn, maintain trim in asymmetric ﬂight or point
the fuselage away from the direction of ﬂight depends critically upon the ratio of
two static stability effects, the yawing moment (Nv) and rolling moment (Lv) due
to sideslip, i.e., directional and dihedral stability, respectively. ADS-33 requires the
dihedral to be positive and essentially linear for Level 1 ﬂying qualities. To protect
against control limits being reached in sideslipping or sideways ﬂight, upper limits on
dihedral effects in the required MTEs are deﬁned in terms of amount of control used, as
follows:
Level 1: <75% control/49 N (11 lbf) control force;
Level 2: <90% control/60 N (13.5 lbf) control force.
Estimates of both the rolling and the yawing moments can be derived from steady
heading sideslip ﬂight tests at a range of forward speeds from climbing through to au-
torotative ﬂight. Such tests will also highlight any control problems within the sideslip
envelope which is usually deﬁned from fuselage stress considerations as a piecewise
linear function of airspeed. At each test point, control angles to trim and aircraft at-
titudes are recorded. Figures 6.38(a)–(c) illustrate trim control results for the Puma;
Fig. 6.38(a) illustrates how the control gradients vary with forward speed while Figs
6.38(b) and 6.38(c) show results at three different ﬂight states descent, level and climb
at 100 knots, with the slopes of the curves again indicating directional and dihedral
stability. The calculation of derivative ratios can be demonstrated using the analysis of
Chapter 4. The following ratios can be derived from the steady moment balance in a

where δη1c and δηp are the pilot’s control deﬂections from level trim and v is the

be neglected, the trends, though not absolute variations, in dihedral and directional
stability can therefore be derived. For helicopter conﬁgurations with a high set tail

rotor, the rolling moment from the tail rotor will contribute signiﬁcantly to the lateral
cyclic required in steady sideslipping ﬂight. When the dihedral effect is small the
trimmed cyclic may be in the same direction as the pedal trim, leading to Level 2
qualities according to ADS-33. An overriding pilot consideration when testing for
directional and dihedral stability should be that clear unambiguous sideforce cues
indicate the direction of sideslip. In particular, the pilot needs to be clearly alerted by
these cues when sideslip limits are approached, as normally information on sideslip is
not available to the pilot.
6.4
Pitch Axis Response Criteria
Before we embark on a discussion of pitch axis ﬂying qualities criteria, it is useful
to reﬂect on the different axis pairings that arise in ﬂying qualities. The conventional
approach places roll and yaw together, and pitch and heave together, in classical lateral-
directionalandlongitudinalmotions.ThisiscertainlytheapproachwetookinChapter4
when analysing ﬂight dynamics in terms of the natural modes. But when it comes to
ﬂying qualities criteria, we typically ﬁnd roll and pitch having much in common. Just
as with ﬁxed-wing aircraft, in high-speed ﬂight the pilot has the most powerful control
overanaircraft’sﬂightpathwithhiscentre-stick,throughaileronsandelevatororlateral
and longitudinal cyclic. At hover, and in low-speed ﬂight, the cyclic is used to redirect
the helicopter rotor’s thrust, and harmony between roll and pitch ﬂying qualities is
particularly important because mixed pilot commands are a regular occurrence. In this
context we should expect similar formats for roll and pitch ﬂying qualities criteria.
While this is the case in low-speed manoeuvres, the requirements on the pitch axis in
forward ﬂight are quite different from roll in many details. Pitch cyclic is the primary
speed control, provides the mechanism for pulling g in manoeuvres, enables fuselage
pointing and is a powerful motivator for the control of ﬂight path angle in high-speed
ﬂight. Pilots of conventional helicopters are familiar with an impure response type in
the pitch axis in forward ﬂight rate in the short term, washing off quite rapidly as speed
and incidence change, to give an attitude change in the mid term. The longitudinal
stick position therefore provides a powerful cue to the pilot of the forward airspeed
and pitch attitude of the helicopter. In response-type terms, however, this most closely
resembles a rate response type and hence the related criteria apply.
As we examine the criteria for different areas on the response diagram, we shall
ﬁnd many similarities with the roll axis, but we will also see differences, especially in
the areas of dynamic and quasi-static stability. Comparison with equivalent criteria for
ﬁxed-wing aircraft will provide interesting points for discussion when comparing the
different roles and associated task bandwidths associated with the two types of aircraft.
6.4.1
Moderate to large amplitude/low to moderate frequency:
quickness and control power
For low speed and hover MTEs, criteria for moderate and large amplitude pitch axis
handling qualities mirror the roll axis very closely. The pilot’s ability to manoeuvre
is determined by the same performance or agility parameters – control power and
attitude quickness. Figure 6.39 illustrates ﬂight results from the DRA research Lynx
(Ref. 6.45) performing a quickhop MTE; the aircraft is repositioned from one hover

position to another, across a 50-m (150 ft) clearing. The results are displayed as a phase
plane portrait with pitch rate plotted against attitude for three different levels of pilot
aggressiveness – low, moderate and high, deﬁned by the initial pitch angle and the
rate of application of cyclic control. At the highest level of aggressiveness, the pilot
is nominally attempting to ﬂy the manoeuvre as quickly as possible, achieving pitch
angles of over 30◦during the acceleration phase and corresponding rates of 40◦/s.
Pitch rates of 50◦/s were used in the reversal phase of the manoeuvre to initiate the
deceleration. In many respects the quickhop is similar to the lateral sidestep described
earlier and illustrated in Fig. 6.19. Moreover, in hover, the control power in the pitch
axis is essentially the same as in the roll axis, scaled by the ratio of control ranges. This
can mean that the pitch axis control power is actually higher than the corresponding roll
axis control power. However, there are two handling aspects that serve to differentiate
between pitch and roll requirements for control power and quickness. First, the ﬁeld-
of-view constraints resulting from large positive and negative pitch excursions tend
to make pilots less willing to use the full agility in the pitch axis. This is coupled
with pilot concern of where the tail of the aircraft is; during the quickhop reversal at
maximum aggression, for example, the Lynx’s tail rotor descends 10 m (30 ft) closer to
the ground. While the same is true for the blade tips in the sidestep, the pilot can more
easily monitor the aircraft’s safety as he or she looks into the manoeuvre. Second, to
achieve similar quickness levels in pitch and roll, the pilot needs to apply larger control
inputs to quicken the pitch response effectively, since the higher inertia in the pitch
axis reduces the achievable angular acceleration and hence bandwidth, for the same
applied control moments. This can lead to overcontrolling and reduced safety margins

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.40 Minimum pitch control power requirements – rate response type (Ref. 6.5)
when manoeuvring close to the ground. The result of these effects is that requirements
for pitch axis control power and quickness tend to be lower than for roll. Figures 6.40
and 6.41 show the ADS-33 minimum control power and quickness required for rate
response types, for the different classes of MTE. Unlike the roll axis criteria shown in
Figs 6.15 and 6.17, the pitch criteria are deﬁned only for hover/low-speed MTEs. In
forward ﬂight MTEs, ADS-33 is much more qualitative, requiring the pitch authority
to be sufﬁcient to accelerate between deﬁned speeds at constant altitude, with no levels
of aggressiveness deﬁned.
The minimum control power levels in Fig. 6.40 were developed from ﬂight and
simulation experiments conducted on ground-based and in-ﬂight simulators and apply
to the cases of aircraft manoeuvring from the hover at the most critical wind state for
pitch manoeuvring. They represent the minimum manoeuvre margins for successfully
accomplishing battleﬁeld helicopter operations. For moderate amplitude manouevres,
the quickness minima in Fig. 6.41 apply. Compared with the roll boundaries, we
immediately see the levels are reduced across the range by signiﬁcant amounts, for
the reasons given above. While the rationale for the mismatch between pitch and roll
requirements is understandable, when these are realized in practice, the pilot does not
have fully harmonized cyclic control; if he or she pushes the cyclic 45◦to the right, the
aircraft might accelerate away at 70◦, simply because the roll quickness is higher than
the pitch. The author believes that there is a strong case for full harmonization with
rate or attitude response types for low-speed MTEs, as would be found, for example,
with TRC (see Section 6.8).
The use of quickness and response to large control inputs to quantify attitude
ﬂying qualities at moderate to large amplitude is an innovation of ADS-33 and replaces
the earlier measures adopted in MIL-H-8501A and the UK’s Def Stan, based on the
attitude response in a deﬁned time, independent of response type. Earlier versions of
the ADS, in the original draft Mil Spec 8501B version, did adopt the ‘attitude change
in one second’ criterion, but the very compelling and more intuitive quickness, which

Fig. 6.41 Pitch attitude quickness criteria (Ref. 6.5): (a) target acquisition and tracking
(pitch); (b) general MTEs (pitch)
had emerged as a natural roll axis handling and agility parameter, soon replaced this
for moderate pitch attitude manoeuvres, with excursions between 10◦and 30◦.
Figure 6.42 shows the Lynx quickness envelope from the DRA Quickhop tests,
overlaid with the ADS-33 Level 1/2 boundaries for tracking and general MTEs. The
attitude change has been extended out to beyond 60◦to include the excursions dur-
ing the pitch reversal. The quickness, corresponding to the ADS-33 minimum control
power requirement at this end of the manoeuvre range, would be about 0.5 rad/s, or
approximately half that achieved by the Lynx. A similar result was found with the roll
axis sidesteps. The Lynx is a very agile airframe of course, empowered by its hingeless
rotor and it does raise the question as to what are the desirable levels, rather than the
minimum levels, of quickness for different MTEs. We shall return to this subject under
the special topic of agility in Chapter 7. At the lower end of the amplitude range in
Fig. 6.42 the measured quickness values rise up to well beyond the minimum require-
ments; here we are in the domain of the tracking phase of the MTE and we have to
look again to the bandwidth criterion to set the standards.

unaugmented or partially augmented aircraft have a characteristic short period pitch

The exponential function has been added to account for any unmodelled time delays
or high frequency lags in the aircraft, e.g., actuators with time constant τ. Fixed-wing
aircraft short-term pitch handling qualities can be established on the basis of the param-
eter set in the model structure for the short-period mode given above. As discussed in
Ref. 6.59, the parameters are used to derive the control anticipation parameter, which
is the fundamental manoeuvre margin parameter for ﬁxed-wing aircraft. This so-called
LOES approach (Ref. 6.60), whereby the parameters are derived from a model matched
to frequency response ﬂight test data, currently enjoys the role of primary criterion for
classical response types or essentially where the ﬁt error is small, implying second-
order dynamic characteristics. For conventional ﬁxed-wing aircraft, without stability
and control augmentation in the pitch axis, the phugoid mode is normally well sepa-
rated from the short period in frequency terms and the approximation has a wide range

409
of application. For non-classical response types, or when the ﬁt error is too large to
trust the estimated frequency and damping, one of the proposed alternate criteria is
bandwidth. The bandwidth and phase delay parameter pair were, in fact, born out of
the difﬁculties encountered in achieving satisfactory equivalent system matching for
ﬁxed-wing aircraft with complex, high-order control systems that completely changed
the shape of the frequency response and replaced the classical short-period mode with
a combination of others.
A discussion of the bandwidth concept formed part of the treatment of roll axis
handling qualities in the previous section and this reads across directly to the pitch axis,
where for helicopters, bandwidth is no longer the alternate, but primary parameter.
Indeed, the need for an alternate to LOES for pitch axis handling of helicopters is
even stronger, with typical phugoid and short-period modes much closer together in
the frequency range. Research results presented by Houston and Horton (Ref. 6.28)
showed that second-order equivalent systems for pitch–heave dynamics in forward
ﬂight do have potential, and can be used to simulate the response to limited bandwidth
inputs, although not all of the estimated handling parameters reported were physically
plausible. The character of the longitudinal modes was discussed in Chapter 4 along
with the theoretical framework for linearized models of pitch dynamics.
Comparison of the bandwidth/phase delay handling qualities boundaries for ﬁxed-
and rotary-wing aircraft are shown in Figs 6.43 and 6.44. Figure 6.43 compares the
boundariesforaircombatandhover/low-speedtrackingtasks,whileFig.6.44compares
the boundaries for more general rotorcraft MTEs with ﬁxed-wing aircraft in Category
C ﬂight phases, including landing. Two points are immediately apparent. The ﬁrst is
that the ﬁxed-wing Level 1/2 boundaries are typically set at bandwidths two to four
times those for helicopters. Second, that the phase delay boundaries are set much
lower for ﬁxed-wing aircraft. Both of these differences serve to reﬂect the different
character of the rotary- and ﬁxed-wing aircraft MTEs, which in turn is a reﬂection

of the different speed ranges over which the aircraft operate. It is no coincidence
that ﬁxed-wing air combat typically takes place at speeds three to four times those
envisaged for rotary-wing aircraft with similar differences in target closure range and
rate. Not only is the higher bandwidth required to enable the pilot to track effectively,
but the higher speeds in ﬁxed-wing combat provide the aerodynamic forces to achieve
the higher bandwidth. It would be very difﬁcult, if not impossible, to engineer the
6 rad/s capability in rotorcraft manoeuvring at 100 knots. The much greater allowed
phase delay for rotorcraft is still somewhat controversial, for similar reasons to those
discussed for the roll axis. Some research ﬁndings have indicated (Refs 6.45, 6.51)
that capping of the phase delay boundary down to 200 ms, or even lower, is warranted,
and the author has supported this view. However, until a more substantial handling
qualities database for pitch axis MTEs is available that clearly demonstrates degraded
handling or even PIO tendencies for the higher bandwidth/phase delay conﬁgurations,
the ADS-33 boundaries will probably be preserved. It should be emphasized that to
achieve a phase delay of 300 ms with a 4 rad/s bandwidth, the manufacturer would
be working very hard and incorporating very unusual features in the design; in fact, it
seems a highly unlikely, if not impossible, practical combination. With the application
of digital ﬂight controls to helicopters, however, the controversial issue of phase delay
limits for pitch axis dynamics may well re-emerge.

Small amplitude/low to moderate frequency: dynamic stability
The lack of natural longitudinal stability in helicopters was highlighted in Chapter 2 as
one of the signiﬁcant differences between ﬁxed- and rotary-wing aircraft; this particular
aspect was also discussed in some detail in Chapter 4, where approximate theoretical
models provided some insight into the physical mechanisms – the pitching moments
due to incidence and speed – that cause the unstable behaviour. The unstable mode

requirements (Refs 6.5, 6.6)
of an unaugmented helicopter is often referred to as the phugoid, for both hover and
forward ﬂight, even though the character of the mode is signiﬁcantly different in the
two speed regimes. As discussed in Chapter 4, for some conﬁgurations the ‘phugoid’
frequency reduces to zero in high-speed ﬂight and the motion can become so divergent
that the main inﬂuence is on short-term control response rather than long-term stability
per se.
We reproduce Fig. 2.39 here for the reader’s convenience as Fig. 6.45, show-
ing a comparison of ﬁxed- and rotary-wing handling qualities boundaries on the
frequency/damping plane for the long-period mode. The rotary-wing requirements
are taken from ADS-33 and strictly apply only to RC response types, but criteria in
Def Stan 970 and the civil standards are very similar. The dashed boundary, corre-
sponding to a damping ratio of 0.35, applies to cases where the pilot is required to
divide his or her attention between tasks and for ﬂight in degraded visual environ-
ments. For fully attended operations, a small amount of instability is allowed, but this
is curtailed abruptly for frequencies above 0.5 rad/s. An interesting comparison with
the ﬁxed-wing boundaries is the presence of the shaded region where a Level 1 rotary-
wing aircraft handling corresponds to worse than Level 3 handling for a ﬁxed-wing

aircraft. Also, for frequencies above 0.5 rad/s, there is a large region where Level 1
rotary-wing handling coincides with Level 2 ﬁxed-wing handling. We shall discuss
the ﬁrst of these observations only, which appears to be quite anomalous. It has to be
recognized that in the development of new ﬂying qualities requirements, any new crite-
rion should not immediately exclude existing operational aircraft (unless there is very
good reason to), and the allowance of the region of instability on Fig. 6.45 conforms
with this philosophy. On the other hand, the requirement for the 0.35 damping indi-
cates that if any ‘serious’ mission-related ﬂying is to be conducted, then some form of
artiﬁcial stability and control augmentation is mandatory. This is exactly how designs
evolve in practice, and typically a signiﬁcant proportion of the development ﬂying on a
new type will be dedicated to the reﬁnement of the stability and control augmentation
system, with particular emphasis on longitudinal handling. Figure 6.46 shows how
the phugoid mode of the BK117 helicopter at 130 knots was stabilized with a com-
bination of rate and attitude feedback with the relatively low gain values −0.06◦/◦s
and 0.3◦/◦, with the attitude stabilization providing by far the strongest contribution
(Ref. 6.61).
A pulse input in longitudinal cyclic is usually sufﬁcient to excite the pitch long
period oscillation; the period can lie between 10 and 30 s, or even higher, hence the
motion will have to be allowed to develop over a long time to obtain good estimates of
both damping and frequency. As discussed in Chapter 2, this can lead to large amplitude
motions from which the recovery can be even more dramatic than the test manoeuvre
itself. The lesson is to apply a small amplitude exciting pulse, and to ensure that the
motion does not exceed the normal linear range (e.g., attitude excursions <10◦, speed
excursions <10 knots).

6.4.4
Trim and quasi-static stability
A pilot ﬂying under IFR in turbulent conditions will have his or her workload signif-
icantly increased if, in attempting to control speed errors with cyclic, the new stick
position to trim is in the opposite sense to that initially required to cancel the per-
turbation. Likewise, when manoeuvring to avoid obstacles, a pilot will need to work
harder if having rolled into a turn and pulled back on cyclic to increase turn rate, the
pilot ﬁnds that he or she needs to push forward to avoid ‘digging-in’. Both of these
handling characteristics, are, generally speaking, unacceptable by any military or civil
requirements standards, and ﬂight tests need to be performed to establish if they are
present within the OFE. They represent negative margins of speed and manoeuvre
stability, respectively, that, together with their close companion ﬂight path stability,
form the topic of this section. Requirements tend to be very qualitative for trim and
static/manoeuvre stability and therefore the emphasis below is on the required ﬂight
test techniques.
Figure 6.47 illustrates the consequences of positive and negative speed stability
for cyclic control — in both cases the speed excursion is the same, but, with negative
speed stability, the cyclic retrims the ‘wrong way’. There are two concepts tradition-
ally associated with this characteristic, namely, apparent and true speed stability. The
apparent speed stability is determined by the slope of the longitudinal cyclic trim vari-
ation with speed, i.e., with collective varying to maintain level ﬂight or a deﬁned rate
of climb or descent. True speed stability, on the other hand, usually of more concern
to the pilot, is determined at a given speed by noting the new trim stick position for
speed increments at constant collective pitch. The two results are sketched in Fig. 6.48
where, for illustration, the true speed stability is shown to be negative and contrary to
the apparent speed stability at the lower speed trim condition.
The test technique to investigate true speed stability is fairly straightforward.
Having established trimmed ﬂight at a deﬁned airspeed and power setting, the heli-
copter is retrimmed in a series of speed increments, below and above the test airspeed,
with cyclic. Alternation between positive and negative increments allows the aircraft
to remain within a sensible altitude band (e.g., 1000 ft) for level ﬂight airspeed tests.

414
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.48 Effects of speed stability; true and apparent speed stability (Ref. 6.62)
For climb and descent conditions, two passes through the required altitude band are
typically required. While conducting these tests, the pilot will also be concerned with
any related ‘ease of trimming’ issues, e.g., controller breakout forces and force gradi-
ents. Particular attention will be paid to identifying strong nonlinearities, for example,
discontinuities in the speed stability and to distinguishing these from any adverse
controller force characteristics or the effects of atmospheric disturbances.
Most certiﬁcation requirements allow a limited degree of speed instability at
low speeds, on the basis that the effect is not so critical here with the pilot normally
controlling both speed and ﬂight path angle with a combined cyclic/collective control
strategy. At higher speeds, particularly for cold weather operations, adverse speed
stability can limit the safe maximum ﬂight speed, and careful testing is required to
highlight any advancing blade Mach number effects. One such problem arises when
a forward speed increment results in the centre of pressure moving further aft on the
outboard sections of the advancing blade. This compressibility effect twists the blade
cyclically to give a nose-down pitching moment on the aircraft, which needs to be
counteracted with aft cyclic.
Within the framework of the linearized stability theory discussed in Chapter 4,
the speed stability of a helicopter is determined by the value of the effective derivative
M∗
u = Mu −Zu

(6.24)
obtained from the equations for the initial pitching moment due to a speed disturbance
and the ﬁnal steady-state cyclic increment. The effect is usually dominated by the
pitching moment derivative Mu which has a stabilizing contribution from the main
rotor. The fuselage and tailplane contributions will depend upon the trimmed incidence
of these components. Tailplane effects can dominate in some situations. Reference 6.63
describes the adverse effect on speed stability caused by tailplane stall during climbing
ﬂight in the SA 365N helicopter. Fitting small trailing edge strips on the tailplane
attenuated this effect, but to guarantee speed stability for steep climbs in the range
80–100 knots, an additional speed hold function was incorporated into the autopilot.
Similar small design modiﬁcations to the tailplane leading and trailing edges were
required to achieve speed stability for the BK117 helicopter (Ref. 6.61).

In addition to the speed stability testing described above, further tests are required
to explore the cyclic trim changes with power settings at different speeds from autoro-
tation to max power climb. These tests are required largely to check that adequate
control margins are available in these conditions but will also highlight the essential
features of ﬂight path stability. Although there are no general requirements concerned
with helicopter ﬂight path stability, for aircraft roles that demand precise ﬂight path
control, e.g., guided approaches, testing will need to be carried out to establish the
optimum pilot control strategy for the various ﬂight phases. Such tests are likely to be
carried out in conjunction with the development of the associated displays and stabil-
ity augmentation. Collective is, of course, the natural control to counteract ﬂight path
errors, but above the minimum power speed the use of cyclic can achieve a similar
effect. If the aircraft has, for example, fallen below the glide path and is ﬂying too
fast, pulling back on the stick will eventually cancel both errors. Problems arise below
minimum power speed where, although the initial effect of pulling back on the stick
is to climb the aircraft, the new equilibrium state will be an increased rate of descent.
Although normal control strategy should preclude such problems under ‘controlled’
approach conditions, for unguided steep approaches or emergency situations the pilot
needs to be aware of the potential problems. At very steep descent angles the problem
can be exacerbated by power settling effects (Ref. 6.64) and ultimately the vortex-ring
condition (see Section 6.5), where static stability characteristics are overshadowed by
dynamic effects.
While speed and ﬂight path stability are concerned essentially with cyclic to trim
requirements in 1 g ﬂight, manoeuvre stability is related to cyclic changes required in
manoeuvres involving a change in normal acceleration, or the stick displacement (or
force) per g. All handling requirements specify that this should be positive, i.e., aft stick
is required to hold an increased load factor, and as a consequence, there should be no
tendency to ‘dig in’ during turning ﬂight. The manoeuvre stability can be determined
in ﬂight from either symmetric pull-up and push-over manoeuvres or steady turns,
and needs to be measured across the full range of operational conditions, i.e., speeds,
atmospheric conditions, aircraft loading. For the pull-up tests, the aircraft is trimmed
in level ﬂight at the test airspeed. With collective ﬁxed, the aircraft is then decelerated
with cyclic and then dived to accelerate back to the test airspeed. As the test speed is
approached, an aft cyclic step is applied to achieve the desired load factor and airspeed
as the aircraft passes through a level attitude. The test is repeated with increasing
increments of aft cyclic until the maximum permitted load factor is achieved. Similar
tests are performed to establish the manoeuvre margin for load factors less than 1,
using the push-over technique. For steady turn tests, the aircraft is again trimmed in
level ﬂight at the test airspeed. Load factor is applied incrementally by increasing bank
angle at constant collective and airspeed, and maintaining balance with pedals. Cyclic
is retrimmed at each test condition and the tests conducted for both left and right turns.
Rotorspeed should be adjusted only to remain within power-on limits, and since high
rates of descent may be achieved, care should be taken to remain within a deﬁned
altitude band (e.g., +1000 ft of test condition).
Figure 6.49 illustrates results that may be derived from these tests; the manoeuvre
stability is deliberately shown to be negative (and therefore not Level 1) at the higher
speed. The cyclic to trim variation with load factor in the steady turn will typically
be steeper than the corresponding pull-up result on account of the increased pitch rate
in a turn for a given load factor. The relationship between cyclic to trim and pitch

Here θ1s is the applied cyclic pitch (positive aft), q the pitch rate, V the ﬂight speed and

thrust and rotor disc incidence, and a more exact analysis will certainly be required
for higher values of n. Nevertheless, eqns 6.25 and 6.27 are valid representations of
manoeuvre stability parameters. The numerator in eqn 6.25 is the classical manoeuvre
margin parameter that should be positive for ‘stability’ and acceptable handling char-
acteristics. Typically, an increasingly positive Mw variation with speed will lead to a

deterioration in manoeuvre stability to the point where the margin can change sign.
The load factor parameter in the manoeuvre margin for steady turns arises from the
inclination of the weight component from the fuselage normal and, at low bank angles,
will serve to reduce any undesirable effects of a positive Mw. At higher bank angles,
however, any unstable tendencies are likely to re-emerge.
The tests described above to establish the manoeuvre margin are carried out at
constant collective pitch settings. In many practical situations, however, the pilot will
use collective in conjunction with cyclic to maintain height. The pitching moment
generated by collective application will be nose up and hence the cyclic position to
trim will be further forward than indicated by the tests at constant collective unless
control interlinks have been built in. This effect can be compounded by an increased
download on the tail from the main rotor downwash. On other occasions, the pilot
may choose to decelerate the aircraft in the turn, hence requiring increased aft cyclic
displacement. This variability of stick position with load factor, depending on the type
of manoeuvre ﬂown, does not provide the pilot with a reliable tactile cue in manoeuvres.
In any case, stick force per g is of more concern to the pilot, particularly in the mid–
high speed band, and several current operational helicopters (e.g., AH-64, SH-60) have
force feel systems that provide a positive and reliable cue to the pilot of manoeuvre
margin.
6.5
Heave Axis Response Criteria
Heave, or vertical, axis handling qualities criteria are concerned principally with the
response of the aircraft to collective pitch application. In hover and low-speed ﬂight,
collective provides the pilot with direct lift control, a feature that clearly makes the
helicopter almost unique. In forward ﬂight, control of the aircraft’s ﬂight path can be
achieved through a combination of collective and cyclic, but in this section we shall
restrict the discussion to the response to collective control. The extent to which the pilot
is able to exercise this degree of freedom depends on a number of factors, which we
shall discuss, but is often dominated by the thrust margin available before transmission
torque, rotorspeed or engine limits are exceeded. The thrust margin is a strong function
of airspeed through the variation of the power required in trimmed ﬂight; this point has
been discussed earlier in the modelling chapters of this book, but it is worth recalling
the shape of the power required curve given in Fig. 4.11. Typically, for a fully laden
helicopter at its mission weight, the power margin at hover is very low, of the order
of 5–10%, giving thrust margins between 3 and 7%. At minimum power speed, the
same helicopter may have more than a 100% thrust margin, enabling the aircraft to
sustain a 2 g turn. Other fundamental response parameters are the heave damping
and control sensitivity derivatives. Again, both vary signiﬁcantly with forward speed.
These aerodynamic effects are a reﬂection of the increasing efﬁciency of the rotor
as a lifting device through to the mid-speed range. As speed is further increased, the
power required increases again and the response derivatives level off to their maximum
values as the aerodynamic lift becomes dissipated in higher harmonic loadings that
contribute nothing to ﬂight path response. Unlike roll response characteristics, the
heave dynamic characteristics therefore vary signiﬁcantly with forward speed. The
pilot is able to exploit these varying characteristics in different ways, and we must
expect the associated handling criteria to reﬂect this.

The low-speed vertical axis response characteristics are highlighted in the bob-up
task, a vertical unmask manoeuvre illustrated in Fig. 6.50. Results from DRA tests with
the research Puma are shown in Figs. 6.51 and 6.52; the pilot’s task was to climb with
maximum power from the low hover position and to re-establish a hover when the
ground markers were lined up with the top of the gate (Ref. 6.65). Height responses
are shown in Fig. 6.51 for bob-up heights from 25 to 80 ft together with the case of
a maximum power vertical climb, when the climb rate exceeded 30 ft/s (10 m/s). In
comparison, the maximum rate achieved during the 25-ft bob-up was only 14 ft/s. This
result is a function of the vertical damping of the rotor, which gives an effective time

a sharp rise in normal acceleration. The overshoot in the time history of normal g is
explained by the delay in build up of the induced inﬂow, described in Chapters 3 and 5.
A thrust margin of about 15% is sustained for about 1 s before the pilot lowers the
collective by more than 40% and almost immediately pulls in power again to arrest the
deceleration and level out at the top of the bob-up. The manoeuvre is relatively simple
but has required the pilot to apply large control inputs in three phases. The lower traces
in Fig. 6.52 show the excursions of rotor rpm and torque. The lower rotor rpm limit
of 240 rpm is actually reached during the settling phase at the top of the bob-up. The
need to respect rotor collective, torque and rpm limits plays a signiﬁcant role in pilot
subjective opinion of vertical axis handling qualities. This has been exposed in most of
the ﬂight and ground-based simulation work supporting the development of associated
criteria, and we shall return to this aspect later in this section and in Chapter 7.

Fig. 6.53 Puma height quickness in bob-up task
Height quickness results derived from the Puma tests are shown in Fig. 6.53 and
highlight the much lower values than those found for attitude response, even though the
bob-up has been quickened by the pilot through the application of a collective doublet.
Control of helicopter vertical motion is generally regarded as a relatively low-gain task
for pilots, and criteria developments have been limited to fairly simple formats that
apply across the frequency range. The RAE Puma tests referred to above were one of a
series conducted during the early- to mid-1980s to develop new heave handling criteria
for rotorcraft (Refs 6.65–6.68), building on previous work applied to VSTOL aircraft,
with particular emphasis on hover and low speed. Flight path control in forward ﬂight
will be discussed later in this section.
6.5.1
Criteria for hover and low-speed ﬂight
The work reported in Refs 6.65 and 6.66 generally supported the use of VSTOL aircraft
formats and an early version of the revision to MIL-H-8501 placed the boundaries on
time domain parameters – rise time, response shape and control sensitivity, based on
the height rate response to a step collective input. The lower boundary for Level 1/2
handling corresponded to a vertical damping Zw of −0.25 / s centred around a collec-
tive sensitivity of 0.4 g/in. Later tests conducted on the NASA VMS (Ref. 6.68) and at
the Canadian Flight Research Laboratories (Ref. 6.69) demonstrated the importance of
thrust to weight (T/W). A new format, based on T/W, was proposed with revised heave
damping boundaries (Fig. 6.54). The Canadian trials provided a range of new insights
into rotorcraft vertical axis handling. First, for the bob-up task, the required heave
damping for Level 1 handling qualities appeared to be independent of T/W down to the
boundary at 1.08 (i.e., 8% thrust margin), provided that the damping was above the min-
imum required value of 0.25; Level 2 handling could be achieved with thrust margins
greater than 4%, for any value of damping, down to zero. Second, the response shape
criteria discussed earlier appeared to have little signiﬁcance in determining Level 1

421
Fig. 6.54 Heave handling qualities boundaries on damping versus T/W diagram (Ref. 6.69)
handling qualities for low values of T/W typical of rotorcraft loaded to their mission
gross weights. Third, the dynamics of the torque response, and particularly the dynamic
response of the cockpit-displayed torque, signiﬁcantly affected pilot control strategy
and hence handling qualities, emphasizing the need for criteria relating to this effect.
Fourth, pilots preferred a collective control sensitivity linearly matched to the heave
damping such that the ratio was a constant. Fifth, the boundaries on the damping/thrust
margin charts, suggested by the earlier NASA VMS trials (Ref. 6.66), actually sloped
a different way; the results from NRC ﬂight trials suggested that as the damping in-
creased, the thrust margin should at least be held constant and possibly increase, to give
the pilot a similar level of climb performance. There is a deﬁnite trade-off involved
here – performance versus stability – and the ﬂight data favours the former, at least
for the bob-up task. Reference 6.69 argues that in ground-based simulation experi-
ments, pilots have greater difﬁculty with the stabilization task than in real ﬂight due to
deﬁcient visual cues, hence biasing their preference towards greater stability. Finally,
the level of augmentation in pitch and roll had a signiﬁcant effect on the workload
capacity available for pilots to concentrate on the primary vertical axis task. These
results fed into the development of the US Army’s military handling requirements,
and a major revision to the height response criteria eventually appeared in ADS-33
(Ref. 6.5).
The current requirements on vertical axis response characteristics in Ref. 6.5 are
based on the premise that the height rate response to a collective step input should have
a qualitative ﬁrst-order shape as shown in Fig. 6.55. Handling qualities parameters can
be derived from a response model structure in the ﬁrst-order form
˙h
δc
= Ke−τ˙heq s
T˙heq s + 1
(6.29)
where h is the height, δc the pilot’s collective lever and the estimated (time domain)
handling qualities parameters should have values less than those given in Table 6.4.

The maximum acceptable value of the time constant T˙heq for Level 1 handling
corresponds to a minimum value of heave damping of −0.2. The time delay is included
in the model structure to account for actuation and rotor dynamic lags. The gain or
control power K is determined from the steady-state response to the step input and,
for the simple ﬁrst-order representation, is given by the ratio of control sensitivity to
damping. In ADS-33, the limits on vertical axis control power are expressed in terms
of the achievable height rate in 1.5 s and are given in Table 6.5.
The requirements of Table 6.5 can be interpreted in terms of required hover
thrust margins if it is assumed that the initial 1.5 s of height response takes the form
of a ﬁrst-order exponential function. The Level 1 requirements then correspond to a
thrust margin of 5.5% while the Level 2 boundary lies at 1.9% at zero damping; both
values are far lower than any previous results obtained in clinical ﬂying qualities tests
with the bob-up task. In this requirement we see a degree of conﬂict between current
capabilities and future requirements. Most helicopters, whether civil or military, will
carry the maximum allowed payload on a mission, and this generally leaves little
margin for manoeuvring at low speed. As fuel burns off, the available excess thrust and
power margins increase, but to insist on 8%, 10% or even higher margins at take-off can
signiﬁcantly reduce the payload and hence mission effectiveness from a productivity
perspective. Thus, a compromise has been made in the performance requirements of
vertical axis handling, in recognition of current operational practices. For increasing
heave damping, the T/W has to increase to achieve the same vertical velocity, and the
control power requirements of Table 6.5 can be interpreted as boundaries on Fig. 6.54.
The lines again indicate the apparent preference for performance, rather than stability,

in MTEs like the bob-up. In contrast, preliminary results from DRA piloted simulation
trials of ship landings in poor weather (Ref. 6.70) indicate that increased stability
(damping) is preferred as T/W is reduced. The tentative results published in Ref. 6.70
suggest that in sea state 5 (typical worst operating conditions with deck motion ±2 m)
a heave damping of −0.4 would be required with a T/W of 1.08.
The handling parameters in eqn 6.29 can be derived from a curve-ﬁtting procedure
deﬁned in Ref. 6.5 and summarized below. This is the only criterion in ADS-33 that
requires explicit parameter estimation from a model-ﬁtting process. The technique and
some examples have already been discussed in Chapter 5 of this book. In the present
case the ﬁtting process is classed as least squares, output error and is accomplished as
follows:
(1) The helicopter is trimmed in hover and a step input in collective applied;
measurements of height rate are obtained at 0.05-s intervals for a 5-s duration.
(2) Setting initial values for the parameters in eqn 6.29, based on a priori knowledge, an
estimate of the height rate is obtained from the solution to eqn 6.29

The t ≥τ requirement in eqn 6.30 is made to ensure that the response is causal, a
point noted in Ref. 6.71.

constructed as an error function ε(t) given by

The LOES for low-speed heave axis handling qualities described above has evolved
from a number of attempts to model important handling effects during the development

 
424

of ADS-33. It appears to capture, with a reasonably high degree of ﬁdelity, the natural
characteristics of unaugmented helicopter heave motion in the frequency range of pilot
closed-loop control in manoeuvres like the bob-up and precision landing.
One ﬁnal aspect of the response to collective concerns the shape of the normal
acceleration following a very sharp control input. This subject was discussed in Chap-
ter 5 and is also given some attention in Ref. 6.67. The delay in the build up of the rotor
inﬂow causes the acceleration response to peak at much higher values than the ‘steady
state’ (see Fig. 6.52). This ‘high order’ effect will be reﬂected in the height rate response
and will ‘spoil’ the simple ﬁrst-order character, with the potential consequence that
the model parameters will be distorted, in trying to match the more complex response
shape. One solution to this potential difﬁculty is to ensure that the pilot applies a
ramp collective input over, say, a 1-s period, thus allowing the inﬂow time to develop
during the input. This is an expedient measure to satisfy the low–moderate frequency
requirements of the handling effects accommodated by eqn 6.29, but obscures any
additional handling effects at higher pilot gains. We have already stated that control
of vertical motion is largely a low–moderate gain task for the pilot, but automatic
height-keeping controllers will typically have to work at much higher frequencies
where the simple model structure given above will be inadequate. Raising this issue
here highlights the different modelling requirements for handling qualities and control
law design, a topic given some attention in Chapter 5 of this book.
6.5.2
Criteria for torque and rotorspeed during vertical axis manoeuvres
The vertical handling qualities research exercises at NASA Ames and the Canadian
FRL, described in Refs 6.67 and 6.69, both highlighted the importance of monitoring
rotor rpm and torque during MTEs like the bob-up. In some cases the monitoring
requirements on the pilot dominated the workload and hence the pilot HQRs. This
was particularly true for conﬁgurations with low T/W or with slow engine/rotorspeed
governor systems leading to large excursions in rotorspeed. Various attempts were
made to develop supplementary criteria relating to the response of these variables,
but the ﬁndings from the available database were not entirely consistent. The eventual
formats that were settled on for ADS-33 were of a qualitative form for rotorspeed
governing, requiring transients to remain within limits for all tasks ﬂown within the
OFE, and a quantitative form for displayed torque as shown in Fig. 6.56. The Level 1/2
and 2/3 boundaries are based on the character of the displayed torque in terms of time
to ﬁrst peak and overshoot ratio. To the author’s knowledge, there are very few data in
the open literature to validate the criterion set down in Fig. 6.56, and the topic has to
be one of the weak areas of current handling criteria and, in view of its importance to
pilot workload, in need of further research.
6.5.3
Heave response criteria in forward ﬂight
In the ﬁeld of ﬁxed-wing aircraft ﬂying qualities, the subject of ﬂight path response
has received considerable attention and remains one of the areas of ongoing research
and even controversy (Ref. 6.23). Two reasons explain why this level of interest has
not carried over to rotary-wing aircraft handling. First, a critical ﬂight phase and MTE
for ﬁxed-wing aircraft is the approach and precision ﬂare and landing. The ﬂight path

aircraft, and different criteria are required for each, accommodating both attitude and
pathanglebandwidthrequirements.Forhelicopters,thereisnorealequivalentMTE,for
while guided approaches are common, by the time the helicopter is close to touchdown,
the speed will have been reduced to the point that pitch and ﬂight path are independent
degrees of freedom. Second, through collective pitch, the helicopter pilot has direct
lift or direct ﬂight path control, and can normally use a combination of collective and
cyclic to achieve a combination of pitch and ﬂight path angle in forward ﬂight to suit
the mission requirements. These two reasons go some way towards explaining why
the same level of attention has not been given to rotorcraft; the problems are not the
same and the low-speed criteria for rotorcraft are more important. In the absence of
a substantial test database, ADS-33 proposed an identical criterion to the one derived
for hover and low-speed ﬂight, based on an equivalent ﬁrst-order system response. In
the years since ADS-33 was published, several attempts at using this format have been
published. For unaugmented aircraft, the important coupling parameter between pitch
and incidence motion is the static stability derivative Mw. For aircraft with close to
neutral stability, the pitch and heave motions are uncoupled in the short term and the
ﬂight path has a distinct ﬁrst-order shape. An example of this case is presented for the
AH-64A at 130 knots in Ref. 6.72; the time domain ﬁt is shown in Fig. 6.57 and the
handling parameters estimated from the ﬁrst-order ﬁt compare well with stability and
control derivatives estimated from test data using six degrees of freedom models. Much
poorerresultsarepresentedinRefs6.19and6.71.InRef.6.19,thecorrespondingresults
for the Bo105 at 80 knots are presented. Figure 6.58 shows the height rate response to
a step collective input, indicating a non-ﬁrst-order-like shape in the 5-s window. For
the Bo105, the pitch response to a collective step is very strong, causing the speed to
reduce and the aircraft ﬂight path to change as the nose pitches up. Applying cyclic
to minimize pitch excursions resulted in a ﬁrst-order height rate response (see full

curve on Fig. 6.58), but the estimated parameters were dependent on the cyclic control
strategy. The Bo105 results show clearly that the simple ﬁrst-order equivalent system
is not a consistently good approximation to heave dynamics and needs to be applied
with considerable caution. Heave axis handling qualities in forward ﬂight is an area
clearly needing more attention.
6.5.4
Heave response characteristics in steep descent
Flight in conditions of steep descent presents particular dangers for helicopters. It is
generally avoided by pilots but the continuing occurrence of accidents and incidents
in this ﬂight regime indicates that it is both operationally useful (e.g., positioning
underslung loads) and easy to encroach inadvertently. In Chapter 5 we saw that the
response to collective pitch at steep angles of descent can reverse, and so increased
collective is required to descend more rapidly. Under controlled or directed conditions,
this feature can be contained by a pilot, but in other conditions it can easily give rise to
serious handling deﬁciencies. In Chapters 4 and 5 we discussed the problem of power
settling, when the ﬂight path steepens in response to an increase in collective. In Ref.
6.64 Heyson presents a useful theoretical analysis of the problem; the reader is referred
to Fig. 4.12 where the power requirements in steep descent are illustrated. Heyson also
comments on the operational implications of power settling – to quote from Ref. 6.64.
Operationally, the appearance of the phenomenon is rapid and usually unexpected.
Pilots sometimes refer to it as ‘stepping in the sinkhole’. The particular problem
is that the pilot has no means of determining his aerodynamic ﬂightpath. He may
successfully negotiate a combination of geometric glide slope and speed so many
times that he is conﬁdent of its safety; however, the next approach may encounter
winds that produce disastrous consequences.
A similar sequence of events can be encountered even without a tailwind. If any
disturbance increases the speed along the glide slope, the instinctive reaction of a
pilot is to correct the airspeed by pulling back on the cyclic-pitch stick to increase the
rotor inclination. If the original stabilised glide slope was near a minimum power
condition, comparison of the various parts of Fig. 12 shows that such a rearward
stick movement may result in a power requirement far in excess of that available in
the helicopter.
The operational signiﬁcance of this effect is that pilots should be speciﬁcally
cautioned against any large or rapid rearward stick motions while in steep descents.
Any recovery from power settling is likely to result in a signiﬁcant loss in
altitude. Thus, the safest procedure is to ﬂy so as to avoid power settling at all times.
Power settling and the associated nonlinear ﬂight path response to controls occurs in
steep descent ( >60◦) in the speed range of about one to two times the hover induced
velocity (20–50 knots, depending on rotor disc loading). At much lower rates of descent
and in near-vertical descent, a helicopter can enter a potentially hazardous ﬂight state
wherehighratesofdescentcanbuilduprapidlyanderraticpitchandrolloscillationscan
develop. In addition, control effectiveness can change markedly, particularly collective
control, with normal recovery techniques seeming only to exacerbate the situation.
Analogous to the stall in ﬁxed-wing aircraft, at least in terms of the consequences
to the ﬂight path trajectory, but quite dissimilar in aerodynamic origin, this so-called
vortex-ring condition is deﬁnitely a state to avoid, especially at low altitude. Flying

 
428
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
qualities in vortex ring become severely degraded and a pilot’s ﬁrst consideration
should be to ﬂy out of the condition.
The phenomenon has its origin in the peculiar ﬂow characteristics that develop
throughtherotorintheintermediaterangebetweenthehelicopterandwindmillworking
states (see Fig. 2.8). At very low ﬂight speeds (<15 knots) and rates of descent between
500 and 1500 ft/min, depending on the rotor disc.loading, the ﬂow becomes entrained
in a toroidal-shaped vortex ring that leads to extensive recirculation in the outer regions
of the rotor disc. The vortex ring is very sensitive to small changes in ﬂow direction,
and rapid ﬂuctuating asymmetric development of the ring can lead to ﬁerce moments
being applied to the fuselage.
The standard recovery technique involves lowering the nose of the aircraft until
sufﬁcient speed is gained that the vortex is ‘washed’ away, and then applying collective
pitch to cancel the rate of descent. Different aircraft types have their own peculiar
characteristics in the vortex-ring state. Early tests conducted at the RAE (Ref. 6.73)
produced results that varied from loss of control to mild wallowing instability. In
general, the aircrew manual for a type will contain an entry describing any particular
features and advising the best recovery procedures. One such manual notes that rates
of descent can build up to 6000 ft/min if vortex ring becomes fully established and that
‘the aircraft pitches sharply nose down if rearward ﬂight is attained’. Another refers
to ‘an uncontrollable yaw in either direction’ eventually occurring. This same manual
adds that ‘any increase in collective pitch during established vortex ring state creates
a marked pitching moment and should be avoided’. All such references make it clear
that considerable height will be lost if the vortex-ring state is allowed to develop fully
before recovery action is taken.
Interest in the effectiveness of collective control during recovery prompted a
series of trials being carried out by the author at RAE Bedford using Wessex 2 and
Puma helicopters. The tests were qualitative in nature and aimed at exploring the
behaviour of these two aircraft in the vortex-ring state and establishing the beneﬁts to
recovery proﬁle of increasing collective pitch before the aircraft nose is lowered to gain
air-speed. The test technique options for approaching the vortex-ring condition were
somewhat constrained by the need to operate well above the ground (minimum height
for initiating recovery action, 3000 ft above ground level) and the lack of reliable low
airspeed measurement on both aircraft. The procedure adopted involved a deceleration
from 50 knots to the hover, maintaining a constant pre-established (hover) attitude and
rate of descent. The rate of descent was then increased incrementally until the vortex
region was encountered (Fig. 6.59). For both test aircraft the vortex region was quite
difﬁcult to ﬁnd and apparently limited to a range of very low airspeed. With the Wessex,
the region was ﬁrst encountered with the entry proﬁle at 800 ft/min rate of descent. To
quote from the pilot’s report (Ref. 6.62)
. . . with the rate of descent at about 800 ft/min we settled into the vortex ring; the rate
of descent increased through 2000 ft/min in spite of increasing power to 3000 ft lb
(hover torque reading). The vibration level was marked and a considerable amount
of control activity was required to hold the attitude, though the cyclic controls always
responded normally. Applying full power produced a rapid reduction of the rate of
descent as soon as the rotor moved into clear air.

ﬁrst and then increased when airspeed developed, the height loss was about 500 ft.
Similar results were found with the Puma, except that the pitching and rolling moments
were of higher amplitude and frequency and became more intense as the collective lever
was raised during recovery. It is emphasized here that the results discussed above are
particular to type, and the beneﬁcial use of collective during recovery may not read
across to other aircraft. The difference in height loss during recovery for the two
techniques is, however, quite marked and is operationally signiﬁcant, particularly for
low-level sorties. Vortex ring is a real hazard area and can be encountered in a variety
of situations, some less obvious than near-vertical descents into restricted landing
areas. If a pilot misjudges the wind direction, for example, and inadvertently turns and
descends downwind into a landing area, concentrating perhaps more on ground speed
than airspeed, then he may ﬂy dangerously close to the vortex-ring condition. The
ﬁnal stages of a quick stop manoeuvre can also take the rotor through the vortex-ring
condition as the pilot pulls in power. Such manoeuvres are typically carried out close
to the ground and the consequences of a delayed or inappropriate recovery procedure
could be serious.
Speciﬁc ﬂying qualities criteria for the response characteristics in ﬂight at steep
descent angles do not exist, but perhaps the emphasis should be on deriving methods
to assist the pilot in respecting the very real limits to safe ﬂight that exist in this ﬂight
regime, conferring carefree handling, a topic returned to in Chapter 7.
6.6
Yaw Axis Response Criteria
As we turn our attention to the fourth and ﬁnal axis of control, the reader may ﬁnd it
useful to reﬂect on the fact that of all the ‘control’ axes available to the pilot, yaw is,
arguably, the most complex and the one that deﬁnes the greatest extent of the ﬂight
envelope boundary, both directly or indirectly. Figures 6.60 (a) and (b), for example,
show the SA330 Puma control limits for the forward ﬂight sideslip envelope, bounding
the envelope at higher speeds, and for hovering in a wind from the starboard side,
bounding the low-speed envelope. Excursions beyond these boundaries can lead to

loss of control or structural damage. Within these constraints, the pilot may feel able to
command yaw motion in a relatively carefree manner. However, the pilot is not provided
with a cue as to the magnitude of the loads in the tail rotor critical components. The
tail rotor can absorb up to 30% of the total engine power, and in some ﬂight conditions,
tail rotor torque transients can lead to damaging loads. The pilot is also not provided
with precise knowledge of sideways velocity or sideslip angle, but will typically ﬂy at
low level with primary reference to ground cues, oblivious to velocities relative to the
air mass, and relying on tactile cues through control position for information on the
proximity to aerodynamic limits. Our discussion suggests that yaw control is far from
carefree and any handling deﬁciencies can contribute signiﬁcantly to pilot workload
for both civil and military operations.
Yaw control functions can be grouped into the following categories:
(1) balance of powerplant torque reaction on the fuselage, in steady state and
manoeuvring ﬂight;
(2) control of heading and yaw rate in hover and low-speed ﬂight, giving all-aspect ﬂight
capability;
(3) sideslip control in forward ﬂight, giving fuselage pointing capability;
(4) balancing or unbalancing manoeuvres, to increase or decrease turn rate.
Of these, the control functions in category (2) have probably accounted for by far the
greatest range of yaw handling problems, stemming largely from the effects of main
rotor wake–tail rotor–rear fuselage–empennage interactions (Refs 6.74–6.76).
In ADS-33, criteria for yaw handling are deﬁned in much the same formats as for
roll and pitch. These will be reviewed brieﬂy.
6.6.1
Moderate to large amplitude/low to moderate frequency:
quickness and control power
Following the formats adopted for the roll and pitch handling criteria, Fig. 6.61 shows
the heading quickness boundaries for hover and low-speed MTEs, and Fig. 6.62
shows the minimum control power requirements for rate response types. It can be seen
that the requirements for quickness are as demanding as for roll response, placing a
particularly strong emphasis on yaw moment capability. For example, the ability to

and tracking; (b) general MTEs
achieve a yaw rate of 40◦/s in a discrete 20◦heading change requires a maximum
acceleration of about 2 rad/s2. For an aircraft like Lynx this corresponds to generating
a tail rotor thrust perturbation of about 1000 lbf. Overlaid on Fig. 6.61 is the boundary
of maximum quickness values measured on Lynx performing precision hover turns,
with heading changes from 30◦through to 180◦. The ADS-33 requirements for target
acquisition and tracking are fairly demanding and call for a powerful tail rotor, or
fantail in the case of the aircraft for which ADS-33 was developed, the RAH-66. The
high quickness levels were partly established through simulation trials conducted on
the VMS. Reference 6.77 presents results from simulation trials that included target

acquisition and tracking MTEs. Experimental variables under investigation included
the yaw damping, weathercock stability and response shape. Figure 6.63, taken from
Ref. 6.77, shows the apparently very limited region ﬁt for Level 1 handling in air-to-air
target engagement, on a damping/response-shape diagram. The high levels of yaw
damping required to achieve Level 1 for this kind of operation could not normally
be produced without signiﬁcant artiﬁcial response augmentation. Similar results were
reported in Ref. 6.78 for forward ﬂight MTEs. The tracking phase of an aerial combat
engagement is more concerned with the higher frequency, small amplitude behaviour,
and once again, the authors of ADS-33 turned to bandwidth to discern quality.

6.6.2
Small amplitude/moderate to high frequency: bandwidth
The heading response bandwidth requirements are presented in Figs 6.64(a) and (b).
The higher performance required for tracking tasks is common to both hover/low-
speed and forward ﬂight MTEs, e.g., Level 1 boundary at 3.5 rad/s. Such high values
of bandwidth do not occur naturally in helicopters; typically, the yaw axis has very
low damping, particularly at low speed, with rise times of the order of 2 s (see Chapter
4). The results of Refs 6.77 and 6.78 have already indicated the levels of damping that
pilots feel are appropriate for aggressive yaw tasks. Bandwidths of 3.5 rad/s and higher
are more consistent with rise times of the order 0.5 s and hence require some form of
response quickening control augmentation.

stability and strong dihedral effect. The theory for this coupled mode has been presented
in Chapter 4. In response to a doublet pedal input, the aircraft motion will soon be dom-
inated by a weakly damped oscillation, comprising strongly coupled yaw, roll, sideslip
and, for helicopters, pitch motions. The two fundamental parameters are the natural
frequency and damping, and it is not surprising that efforts to deﬁne handling qualities
related to the stability characteristics of this mode should have been focused on the
corresponding two-parameter chart, or classical frequency/damping plane. The quality
boundaries deﬁned in ADS-33 are derived largely from the considerable database for
ﬁxed-wing aircraft (Ref. 6.6), with slightly relaxed stability requirements. A compar-
ison of military and civil requirements (for single pilot IFR) is shown in Figs 6.65(a)
and (b). The variety of boundaries drawn in Fig. 6.65(a) once again reﬂects the mission
orientation of the military requirements. The comparison between civil and military
requirements highlights several aspects already met in previous criteria – chieﬂy the
greater demands made on designers of military aircraft. Another noticeable difference
is shown in the low-frequency damping requirements. Both are based on minimum
total damping at zero frequency. The more stringent military Level 1/2 boundary is set
at time to half amplitude of 0.69 s, while the civil boundary is set at time to double
amplitude of 9 s. The evidence supporting the minimum ωn boundary for military

helicopters in Fig. 6.65(a) is thought to be fairly limited; to the author’s knowledge, no
supporting data for these boundaries relevant to helicopters have appeared in the open
literature since the publication of ADS-33. It is interesting to note that the criterion
for the stability of long-period pitch and roll modes (frequencies less than 1 rad/s)
lies within the ωn >1.0 contour (see Fig. 6.45). One aspect raised here is the impor-
tance to handling qualities of the separation of frequencies between the modes with
low stability. Modes with overlapping frequencies can cause additional pilot workload,
especially when strong cross-couplings are present.
The reader is referred to the analysis of Dutch roll stability and response in
Chapters 4 and 5 where the results of the AGARD WG18 study on Dutch roll stability
are discussed (Ref. 6.79). Most military and civil helicopters have autostabilization
in the yaw axis to improve the Dutch roll damping and, generally, augmented rate
damping is sufﬁcient to achieve Level 1. In some cases, design efforts are successful
in improving the natural aerodynamic stability in yaw. Reference 6.63, for example,
describes how modiﬁcations to the ﬁn of the SA332 Super Puma signiﬁcantly improved
the Dutch roll characteristics of this aircraft compared with the original Puma. Figure
6.66, taken from Ref. 6.61, illustrates the marked improvement in Dutch roll damping
through the ﬁtting of end-plates on the BK117 helicopter; the new design met the FAA
requirement without autostabilization.

 
436

Two ﬁnal points need to be made about the lateral/directional oscillatory mode.
First, at high speed, the frequencies are encroaching on the range appropriate to small
amplitude tracking, and the requirements on damping should be seen as supplementing
the bandwidth criterion. Second, a very important handling characteristic associated
with Dutch roll motion is the phase and relative amplitude between roll and yaw;
separate criteria address these issues under the heading yaw–sideslip response to lateral
cyclic, and we shall address these when discussing cross-coupling, in Section 6.7.
6.6.4
Trim and quasi-static stability
We have already discussed many of the issues relevant to lateral/directional trim and
quasi-static stability in the section on roll axis response characteristics, particularly the
need for positive trim control gradients. One additional handling criterion that ﬁts best
in this category is the requirement on heading (or roll and pitch attitude) hold functions
as deﬁned in ADS-33. With heading hold engaged and activated by the release of the
yaw control device, the reference heading should be captured within 10% of the yaw
rate at release. In addition, following a disturbance in yaw, the heading should return to
within 10% of the peak excursion within 20 s for UCE 1, and within 10 s for UCE > 1.
Asdiscussedintheintroductiontothissection,athoverandlowspeed,particularly
close to the ground, the helicopter creates a disturbed aerodynamic environment in
which the tail rotor is required to work. When the powerful main rotor vortex wake
strikes the tail, particularly from the port side, or in the form of the ground vortex
in rearward ﬂight (see discussion on interactional aerodynamics in Chapter 3), large
yawing moment disturbances can make it difﬁcult for the pilot and even for the simple
automatic hold functions to perform well. The problem is intimately associated with
the open tail rotor; while generally more efﬁcient than an enclosed fan or jet thrust
device in clean aerodynamic conditions, the tail rotor tends to be more sensitive to wind
strength and direction, particularly when positioned close to the vertical stabilizer. This
sensitivity manifests itself as a non-uniform distribution of lift over the tail rotor, giving
rise to large collective and power requirements in critical ﬂight conditions. Reference
6.76 discusses the merits of tail rotor cyclic control in this context, which could be
scheduledwithcollectivetoprovidetheoptimumliftdistributioninallﬂightconditions.

6.7
Cross-Coupling Criteria
Helicopters are characterized by cross-couplings in practically every axis-pairing, and
the ubiquitous nature of cross-coupling constitutes one of the chief reasons why piloting
this type of aircraft requires such high skill levels developed through long training
programmes. Satisfying the direct, or ‘on-axis’, response characteristics, described
in previous sections for roll, pitch, heave and yaw, is necessary but not sufﬁcient to
guarantee good helicopter ﬂying qualities. Any helicopter test pilot would be quick
to conﬁrm this and might even advise that ﬁxing the off-axis, cross-coupled response,
was a higher priority for conferring Level 1 on-axis handling. Ideally, a designer would
like to eliminate all sources of coupling. This is not only impossible (with only four
controls), but probably also unnecessary, and one focus of the efforts in handling
research has been to establish the maximum level of tolerable coupling. As with on-
axis response criteria, this has proved to be task speciﬁc and particularly task-gain,
or task-bandwidth, dependent. In very general terms, the low frequency/trim coupling
effects are driven by the velocity couplings; the moderate frequency effects are reﬂected
in the angular rate couplings and the higher frequency effects are dominated by the
control couplings, in either sustained or washed-out form. Pilot subjective opinion of
the degrading inﬂuence of coupling will therefore depend on the task, e.g., precise
positioning, rapid slalom or target tracking. Many of the physical sources of cross-
coupling have been described and discussed in Chapter 4 of this book. Here, we shall
review the major types of couplings, and the database of results relating to handling
qualities criteria and discuss what more needs to be done to set quality requirements.
In the following subsections, the use of the condensed descriptor, e.g., pitch to roll,
refers to the roll response due to pitch; any distinctions between control and motion
couplings will be made as appropriate.
6.7.1
Pitch-to-roll and roll-to-pitch couplings
Pitch–roll and roll–pitch cross-couplings can be powerful and insidious. The natural
sources of both are the gyroscopic and aerodynamic moments developed by the main
rotor and, in dynamic manoeuvres with large attitude excursions, the uncommanded
and sometimes unpredictable off-axis motion can require continuous attention by the
pilot. Generally, the magnitude of the pitch-to-roll couplings are more severe than roll
to pitch, due to the large ratio of pitch to roll moment of inertia, but are, arguably, more
easily contained by the pilot, at least at low to moderate frequencies. Roll-to-pitch
coupling effects can have a much stronger impact on ﬂight path and speed control and
hence handling qualities in moderate to large manoeuvres. From the results of a piloted
simulation study on the NASA Flight Simulator for Advanced Aircraft (FSAA), Chen
and Talbot (Ref. 6.80) hypothesized that the critical cross-coupling handling qualities
parameters were the ratios of short-term steady-state roll (pitch) to pitch (roll) angular
rates, approximated by the ratios of aerodynamic derivatives

Pilot HQRs were consistently awarded in the Level 2 area for values of the ratios greater
than about 0.35. When the revision to MIL-H-8501 was initiated in the early 1980s, the

 
438

NASA results were initially used as the basis of new pitch–roll criteria. The derivative
ratios clearly took no account of the control couplings, however, and were also difﬁcult
to measure with accuracy. After some reﬁnement, the criteria adopted in ADS-33 were
based on a time domain formulation, in terms of the ratio of the peak off-axis response
to the desired on-axis response after 4 s following an abrupt step input, in the form

A series of additional piloted simulation and ﬂight trials, conducted in the late 1980s at
the Ames Research Center (Refs 6.81, 6.82), conﬁrmed the importance of the derivative
ratios, but argued that the new ADS-33 criteria did not cater for the higher frequency
control coupling effects, or the interaction with on-axis characteristics. With regard to
control coupling, the data in Refs 6.81 and 6.82 suggested that equivalent rotor control
phase angles of about 30◦would lead to Level 3 handling, conﬁrming the RAE results
reported earlier in Ref. 6.17. The relationship between the ADS-33 criteria and the
equivalent linear system parameters can be illustrated using the simple ﬁrst-order rate
response formulation (Ref. 6.83), given by the equations

indicating that the pitch attitude coupling in a roll manoeuvre is dependent on both the
cross-damping ratio of Ref. 6.80 (Mp/Mq) and the control sensitivity ratio scaled by
the ratio of roll to pitch damping. Even with a zero value for the rate coupling Mp,
control couplings can give rise to similar levels of pitch attitude excursion. The ADS
time domain parameter in this simple model is therefore linearly related to the derivative
ratios Mp/Mq and Mη1c/Lη1c. Given the roll axis control sensitivity and bandwidth,
the importance of the control coupling is therefore inversely proportional to the pitch
attitude bandwidth, Mq, hence emphasizing the importance of pitch axis effectiveness
in cancelling coupling effects. Contours of equal ADS response are therefore given as
shown in Fig. 6.67.
Our understanding of the handling qualities effects of roll–pitch coupling has been
signiﬁcantly extended by the series of ﬂight/simulation experiments conducted by the
US Army/DLR in the early 1990s, with support from DRA. The work to date is reported
in Refs 6.84 and 6.85 and has focused on evaluating handling qualities in forward ﬂight
MTEs typiﬁed by the lateral slalom. In Ref. 6.84, couplings are classiﬁed into three
types – those due to rate and control effects and the so-called washed-out coupling
effects, more typical of augmented rotorcraft. Reference 6.85 concludes that the current
ADS format is adequate for discriminating against unacceptable characteristics in the

ﬁrst two categories, but not the washed-out effects, which appear to be frequency
dependent. However, data are presented in Ref. 6.85 which suggest a modiﬁcation
to the ADS Level 1/2 boundary as shown in Fig. 6.68(a), where the acceptable level
of coupling has been reduced to 0.1. A new frequency domain criterion is proposed
in Ref. 6.85 which appears to give a more consistent picture for all three types of
coupling. The general form of the criterion is presented in Fig. 6.68(b), where the key
parameters are the magnitudes of the frequency response functions between pitch (roll)
and roll (pitch) rates, evaluated at the bandwidth of the off-axis attitude response. This
format, therefore, again reﬂects the importance of the response characteristics in the
coupled axis. Strictly, the data from Ref. 6.85 will deﬁne only the vertical portions
of the boundaries in Fig. 6.68(b): the author has hypothesized the upper, horizontal
boundaries, which would be deﬁned for pitch axis tasks, and the curved boundary
between, reﬂecting the additional degradation in multi-axis tasks, when couplings in
both axes are present.

Collective to pitch coupling
At high speed, the application of main rotor collective pitch can generate powerful pitch
and roll moments on the fuselage. Experiments to quantify the effects of collective to
pitch coupling on handling qualities were reported in Ref. 6.86. The results were not
conclusive but did indicate the powerful degrading effect, sending HQRs across the
full span of the Level 2 range as the coupling parameter increased. ADS-33 reﬂects the
limited dataset for collective to attitude couplings and sets limits on the pitch attitude
change occurring within 3 s of an abrupt collective input. The limits are set as the ratio
of pitch attitude change to the corresponding change in normal acceleration and take
the form

where the negative value in eqn 6.40 corresponds to down collective inputs. The above
criteriaapplytoforwardﬂight.Inlow-speedﬂighttheemphasisismoreonthecollective
to yaw couplings.
6.7.3
Collective to yaw coupling
The application of collective pitch causes the rotor to slow down (or speed up)
and the governor to increase (or decrease) the fuel ﬂow, hence to increase (or decrease)
the engine torque, which in turn results in a yawing moment reaction on the fuselage.
Helicopter pilots learn to compensate for this effect early in their training and need
to allocate a certain level of compensatory workload for harmonious inputs in pedal
when applying collective. Most helicopters are built with a mechanical interlink
between tail rotor collective pitch and main rotor collective lever, hence nullifying the
gross effects at one particular ﬂight condition. ADS-33 sets a limit of maximum yaw
rate excursions of 5◦/s following abrupt collective inputs, and also sets more complex
limits on the ratio of yaw rate to vertical velocity, for which no substantiating data
have appeared in the open literature; readers are referred to Ref. 6.5 for details.
6.7.4
Sideslip to pitch and roll coupling
The remaining cross-coupling effect to which we give some attention is the attitude
response to sideslip. Pitch response to sideslip is a peculiar helicopter phenomenon
that can lead to control problems in uncoordinated manoeuvres when it is required to
point the fuselage off the ﬂight path. The rotor downwash ﬁeld can affect the horizontal
stabilizer giving a powerful nose-up pitching moment in zero sideslip conditions. As
sideslip builds up, the wake washes off to one side, exposing the tail to free air and
leading to pitch down moments in both port and starboard manoeuvres. Figure 6.69,
taken from Ref. 6.87, illustrates the various contributions to the pitching moment due
to sideslip on the UH-60 helicopter. The canted tail rotor contributes 50% of the strong
cross-coupling and the horizontal stabilizer, contributes 25%. The overall value for the
derivative Mβ is about 2000 ft lb/◦and is equally as powerful as main rotor cyclic

control, therefore requiring signiﬁcant pilot compensation. A strong pitch response to
sideslip can exacerbate pilot disorientation problems following tail rotor failures. To the
author’s knowledge there are no published data deﬁning handling qualities boundaries
for sideslip to pitch effects; it remains a topic for future research.
Roll–sideslip coupling is deﬁned in ADS-33 as part of the forward ﬂight criteria
for lateral/directional oscillatory characteristics (Ref. 6.5). It follows the ﬁxed-wing
format and is expressed in terms of the ratio of the oscillatory to the average component
of roll attitude response following a lateral cyclic control input. The assumption with
this type of format is that the roll oscillations are caused by sideslip excursions in a
roll manoeuvre. The Level 1/2 boundary for this parameter depends on the phase angle
between roll and sideslip.
Two ﬁnal points need to be made on cross-coupling in general. First, it should
be stated that most helicopters are designed with mechanical interlinks, or control
couplings, that minimize the initial coupled motions following abrupt control inputs.
In both the Sikorsky CH-53E and UH-60A, for example, application of collective lever
couples to all the remaining controls through mechanical interlinks. This is a relatively
simple and effective way of reducing some of the primary effects, but does nothing
about the rate and velocity couplings. Second, there is evidence that the maximum
level of acceptable coupling is a strong function of on-axis response characteristics
– the poorer the on-axis handling qualities, the less tolerant pilots are of coupling.
This is consistent with the intuitive rule that the presence of more than one degrading
handling inﬂuence will lead to a combined handling worse than the average of the
individual characteristics. This is bad news of course, but shouldn’t come as a surprise
to any pilot who has tried to ‘tighten-up’ on the controls with an unstabilized or
partially stabilized helicopter, or tried to deﬁne a Level 1 roll axis response boundary,
with a conﬁguration having Level 2 pitch or cross-coupling characteristics. But future
helicopters with active control technology will have low levels of couplings by design.
What does need consideration with these highly augmented aircraft is the level of

 
442
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
mission criticality and even ﬂight criticality of the coupling augmentation. Future pilots
may not be as well trained to ﬂy cross-coupled helicopters, and loss of augmentation
may be analogous to engine or tail rotor failure in today’s helicopter operations. The
central issue then becomes one of system integrity, particularly relating to sensors,
and sufﬁcient integrity/redundancy needs to be incorporated so that the risk of loss of
coupling augmentation is remote.
6.8
Multi-Axis Response Criteria and
Novel-Response Types
This section covers two areas that are relatively immature in terms of the existence of
any underlying ﬂying qualities database. The primary emphasis of all ﬂying qualities
requirements has been the division of criteria into axes over which the pilot has control.
In practice, most MTEs require coordinated control inputs in all axes, and the question
arises as to whether the combination of single axis criteria is sufﬁcient to ensure pilot
acceptance in multi-axis tasks. Practically all the material in the earlier sections of this
chapter deals with the most conventional, rate or attitude command, response types.
With the advent of ﬂy-by-wire/light and the attendant active controls technologies, the
scope for changing the way pilots ﬂy helicopters is very broad indeed. The term novel
response types is coined to classify non-attitude-based systems, and some discussion
on the current status and thinking in this area constitutes the ﬁnal topic in this section.
6.8.1
Multi-axis response criteria
Most of the test MTEs in ADS-33 are primarily single axis tasks, e.g., accel–decel
(pitch), bob-up (heave), sidestep (roll) and hover turn (yaw). For these, at least in theory,
off-axis control inputs are required only to compensate for cross-couplings. Flying
qualities requirements on couplings (see Section 6.7), at least when fully developed,
should ensure that aircraft are built that demand minimum compensation only. Other
MTEs are in their nature multi-axis and require the pilot to apply coordinated controls
to achieve satisfactory task performance, e.g., pirouette, angled approach to hover,
yo-yo combat manoeuvres and roll reversals at reduced and elevated load factors. Very
little research has been done, at least in recent years and hence related to modern
missions, on ﬂying qualities criteria speciﬁcally suited for combined-axis helicopter
manoeuvres. ADS-33 refers only to the requirement that control sensitivities should
be compatible and responses should be harmonious. Control harmony is arguably one
of the most important aspects of ﬂying qualities, but ﬁnding any formal quantiﬁcation
has proved difﬁcult. An intuitive deﬁnition seems to be that harmony is a quality
achieved by having similar levels of characteristic response parameters, at least in the
interacting axes. At a fundamental level, harmony then implies the same response types
in the different axes, e.g., rate command in pitch combined with attitude in roll would
not be harmonious, perhaps even leading to degraded ratings. Harmony applies most
of all to pitch and roll, normally commanded through the same right-hand controller.
Manoeuvring at low speed and close to the ground, the pilot directs the rotor thrust
with the right-hand controller. The author is of the view that harmony in this mode
of control should, as far as possible, encompass response type, bandwidth and control
power (particularly for AC response types). Then if the pilot wants to ﬂy at 45◦to

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development
443
the right, he initiates and terminates the manoeuvre by moving his controller in the
desired direction. This requirement is naturally met in TRC response types discussed
below, but would not be for AC or RC types if the ratio of the minimum requirements
of ADS-33 were maintained (e.g., ±30◦pitch, ±60◦roll for aggressive manoeuvring
with attitude response types in UCE 1).
Inforwardﬂight,oneoftheimportantmulti-axiscriteriathathasreceivedattention
is the requirement for turn coordination. As a pilot rolls into a turn, two compensating
controls have to be applied. Aft cyclic is required, for helicopters with manoeuvre
stability, to compensate for the pitch damping moment in the turn. Into-turn pedal is
required to compensate for the yaw damping in the turn. Additional compensation
will be needed for any steady-state incidence or sideslip required to augment the turn
performance. The requirements for manoeuvre stability have already been discussed in
Section 6.3. The requirements on yaw control harmony, and on the attendant sideslip
response, are more complicated as they depend on the phase between roll and sideslip
in the Dutch roll lateral/directional oscillation. The turn coordination requirements in
ADS-33, for example, focus on the amount of sideslip resulting from an abrupt lateral
cyclic control input; the criterion also highlights the point that sideslip response is more
tolerable when it obviously lags the roll response.
The requirement for cyclic control harmony in manoeuvring ﬂight at moderate to
high speed translates into the need for similar time constants for roll attitude and normal
acceleration response. Fortunately, this is normally the case, with the pitch bandwidth
and control power being harmonized with the correspondingly higher parameters for
roll. For example, as a pilot rolls into a turn with rate command in both pitch and roll,
a bank angle of 60◦and load factor of 2 can be achieved in similar times (about 1.5 s
for an agile helicopter). One potential problem can arise with a pure RC response type
during a roll reversal manoeuvre. Flying a steady turn the pilot will be pulling back
to maintain the pitch rate in the turn. As the pilot executes the roll reversal, he has to
judgehiscontrolstrategycarefully,makingsurethatthecyclicpassesthroughthecentre
with zero pitch input, to avoid making a discrete change in pitch attitude. Reference
6.35 reports on a study to evaluate the relative beneﬁts of rate and attitude command
response types. One of the workload problems with RC highlighted by pilots was the
care required when reversing a roll to avoid making a pitch change that inevitably led to
a speed decrease or increase as the manoeuvre progressed. To overcome this problem,
speed hold functions were proposed. Also, automatic turn coordination was generally
preferred by pilots, at least up to a moderate level of agility, obviating the need to apply
any compensating pitch or yaw inputs.
One ﬁnal point on multi-axis tasks, and to make it we assume that an aircraft that
has been demonstrated as Level 1 in all axes according to clinical objective criteria will
also consistently achieve ‘desired performance’ in practice. It is recognized that this is
a contentious issue, but for the moment we assume that the individual criteria are robust
enough that failure to comply will guarantee bad ﬂying qualities. It is well recognized
that at high levels of pilot aggression or in degraded environmental conditions, an
otherwise Level 1 aircraft can degrade to Level 2. This is generally accepted as being
an inevitable consequence of operating helicopters in harsh environments and can
apply to both military and civil operations. But this raises the question as to whether
a helicopter that has degraded to Level 2 in two or more axes will still be able to
meet adequate performance levels in multi-axis manoeuvres. There is some evidence
to suggest that the answer is negative. In discussing combined axis handling qualities,

 
444
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Hoh (Ref. 6.60) advances an advisory ‘product rule’ that predicts that an aircraft with
two axes both receiving ratings of 5 on the Cooper–Harper scale will actually work
out as a 7 in practice, i.e., Level 3. We shall return to this and other related issues
concerning subjective pilot opinion in the next chapter.
6.8.2
Novel response types
The unique capability of helicopter ﬂight in three dimensions is typiﬁed by low-speed
manoeuvring close to the ground. The pilot’s task can be conceptually divided into three
subtasks – navigation, guidance and stabilization. Navigation, or generally where the
pilot wants to go in the long term, requires low workload and intermittent attention by
the pilot to make course corrections. Guidance relates more to where the pilot wants to
go in the shorter term and requires moderate levels of workload that depend principally
on the speed of ﬂight and on the level of visibility, or how many ﬂight seconds the pilot
can see ahead. In poor visibility and at low level the guidance workload can become
very high. Stabilization relates to the continuous activity and workload to maintain the
required aircraft attitudes. With unaugmented helicopters, the stabilization workload
can be high and requires continuous pilot compensation as the helicopter is disturbed
and deviates from the intended ﬂight path. Most of the effort into augmentation for
supportingpreciseﬂightpathcontrolclosetothegroundandobstacleshasbeendirected
towards reducing the stabilization workload by incorporating attitude hold functions,
in combination with rate command, or even attitude command response types. For
example, both Puma and Lynx have short-term attitude hold as part of their limited
authority SCAS, triggered when the attitude falls within a small range close to zero
(Lynx), or the pilot’s cyclic is stationary (Puma). With the advent of high authority
digital ﬂight control, the capability now exists for providing response types that not
only remove the stabilization workload, but also directly support the guidance task.
Conceptually, the pilot requires control over the magnitude and direction of the aircraft
velocity vector. To date the only criterion developed for ﬂying qualities in the guidance
task has been the TRC response type required for operations in the DVE according
to ADS-33 (Ref. 6.5). TRC refers to a response characteristic where constant pilot
controller input leads to a proportional earth-referenced translational velocity response.
Level 1 ﬂying qualities are deﬁned by a TRC response having a qualitative ﬁrst-
order shape and equivalent rise time of between 2.5 and 5 s. The lower limit is set to
avoid abrupt attitude changes during TRC manoeuvres. Equivalent rise time and the
Level 1 TRC control power and sensitivity boundaries are deﬁned as shown in Fig.
6.70. The limited supporting data for TRC response characteristics are published in
Ref. 6.32.
Two notable examples of the implementation of novel response types are worth
highlighting – the advanced digital ﬂight control system (ADFCS) implemented in the
McDonnell Douglas experimental AH-64 Apache AV05 (Ref. 6.88) and the Velstab
System designed for the production Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche (Refs 6.89,
6.90). The philosophy behind the ADFCS experimental system, designed and ﬂown in
the mid–late 1980s, was to provide low workload management of aircraft control for
single-pilot operations. The provision of automatic moding was part of this philoso-
phy, hence not ‘trading ﬂight path with button management’. The ﬂight path control
logic implemented in AV05 comprised two selectable modes – the ﬂight path vector
system (FPVS) and aerobatic system. The control logic for the FPVS contained many

innovative features as summarized in Fig. 6.71, showing three auto-transition modes for
hover, low speed and cruise. In the low-speed mode, (translational) inertial acceleration
is commanded with the right-hand controller, with inertial velocity hold. This response
type was selected for low-speed NoE ﬂight to ensure that pilots would not be required
to hold stick forces for long periods, as would occur with a pure TRC system. In the
cruise mode, the turn rate hold feature gives the pilot the ability to maintain relative
ﬂight paths while changing speed. In both low-speed and cruise modes, the vertical axis
response type of acceleration command/ﬂight path hold simpliﬁed the task of terrain
ﬂight – the pilot could place the ﬂight path vector symbol in the helmet-mounted
display on the desired point on the terrain, e.g., hill top, to ensure clearance of vertical
obstacles. In the author’s view, AV05 represented, in its day, the state of the art in a
full ﬂight envelope ACT system with novel response types. To quote from Ref. 6.88,
‘. . . non-pilots could command near envelope limit performance from the aircraft in
the course of a one hour demonstration ﬂight’; the present author can testify to this, as
he was one of the privileged engineers to ﬂy AV05 in exactly this fashion.
Atthetimeofwritingtheﬁrsteditionofthisbook,thecoreactiveﬂightcontrolsys-
tem (AFCS) of the RAH-66 Comanche had been demonstrated in piloted simulation to
confer Level 1/ good Level 2 ﬂying qualities for the UCE 1 ADS-33 MTEs (Ref. 6.89).
In addition, the selectable control modes, giving the pilot hybrid ACVH (attitude com-
mand, velocity hold) for ﬂight in DVE, were evaluated as solid Level 1 for the ADS-33
DVE MTEs (Ref. 6.90). On the RAH-66, the DVE control system is described as
the VELSTAB mode, and the characteristics relative to inertial groundspeed (V <60

knots)/airspeed (V > 60 knots) are illustrated in Fig. 6.72 (from Ref. 6.90). At very low
speed (groundspeed within ±5 knots), in the shaded hover-hold region on Fig. 6.72,
TRCPH is provided, giving the pilot a precise positioning aid. Hover-hold break-out
is enabled when the pilot demands a velocity outside the threshold or applies a large
cyclic demand. Below 60 knots groundspeed, the pilot ﬂies with ACVH, with wind
compensation to eliminate, as far as possible, non-uniformities in the required pilot con-
trol strategies in windy conditions, and to ensure a smooth blend between ground and
airspeed at 60 knots. Low-speed turn coordination combined with altitude hold allows
the pilot to ﬂy single handed with the aircraft body axis always aligned with the ﬂight
path.
ADFCS on the Apache and AFCS with VELSTAB on the Comanche are visions
of things to come in helicopter ﬂight control and ﬂying qualities, which have been
realized successfully in ﬂight and simulation. Flight with novel ground-referenced
response types is being enabled by advances in sensor and digital ﬂight control system
technologies and clearly offers the potential for signiﬁcant reductions in pilot workload,
particularly for ﬂight in DVE. The military driver is to provide capabilities previously
not possible, but signiﬁcant safety improvements in civil operations in poor visibility
or congested and/or conﬁned areas are also likely to be realized with this technology.
6.9
Objective Criteria Revisited
In this chapter a great play has been made of the concept of dynamic response criteria,
used to form the predicted handling qualities, ﬁtting into their place on the frequency–
amplitude chart, conceptualized earlier in Figs 6.5 and 6.14. This can be summarized
more holistically using Fig. 6.73 where the different criteria can be further classiﬁed
into two groups – those determining the aircraft’s agility and those determining the
aircraft’s stability (Ref. 6.91).
As before, the manoeuvre envelope line is shown to restrict criteria to practical
manoeuvres, the achievable manoeuvre amplitude reducing as frequency increases.
Within this overall envelope, four areas can be distinguished, two dealing with stability
and two dealing with agility. The dynamic response requirements relating to agility and

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 6.73 Differentiating agility and stability criteria on the frequency–amplitude chart
stability cannot easily be ‘divorced’, since too much stability can degrade agility and
vice versa. Designing to achieve the right balance requires careful optimization and,
as with the design of ﬁxed-wing aircraft, digital ﬂy-by-wire/light ﬂight control tech-
nology has provided the designer with considerably more freedom than hitherto in this
trade-off. However, it is signiﬁcantly not essential for control augmentation systems to
have full authority over the control actuation to be able to deal with this. The essence of
this challenging compromise can be seen in the designs of the augmentation systems
on two of the aircraft featured in this book – the Lynx and the Puma. The Lynx system
features both pitch–roll attitude and rate feedback signals, but the gain on the attitude
signal has two values – a high value for small perturbations and a much reduced value
when the attitude increases above certain values. The response type is therefore ACAH

for small amplitude inputs and RC for large amplitude inputs. The increased stability
conferred by the attitude feedback also improves the aircraft ﬂying qualities in turbu-
lent conditions where the pilot does not have to apply continuous corrective actions to
maintain a desired attitude and speed. In the Puma system, a different approach is used.
A pseudo-attitude is derived by integrating the signal from the rate gyro and used to
provide short-term attitude stabilization. When the pilot moves the cyclic stick outside
a prescribed range from the trim position, the pseudo-attitude component is switched
out, providing the pilot with full RC response. Both the Lynx and Puma designs were
innovative 40 years ago and speciﬁcally designed to address the stability–agility trade-
off; the augmentation on both aircraft acts through limited authority (≈±10%) series
actuators. Nowadays, task-tailored control and ﬂying qualities are commonplace con-
cepts, although the implementation of such strongly nonlinear design functionality
seems to be much less common.
In Fig. 6.73, examples of agility and stability criteria from ADS-33 are shown.
The moderate amplitude quickness criteria (shown for the roll axis) provide a direct link
between closed-loop stability, encapsulated in the bandwidth criteria (shown for the
pitch axis), and the maximum agility, encapsulated in the control power criteria (shown
for the yaw axis). The basic stability is deﬁned by the position of the eigenvalues on the
complex plane, shown in the ﬁgure for the Dutch roll–yaw oscillation. Flying qualities
requirements extend far beyond those summarized in Fig. 6.73, of course, including
trim and static stability, ﬂight path response, cross-coupling behaviour and controller
characteristics, and most of these aspects have been covered to varying extent in this
chapter. During the period since the publication of the ﬁrst edition of Helicopter Flight
Dynamics, various basic research and application studies have reﬁned the understand-
ing of helicopter ﬂying/handling qualities and some of this has been embodied in the
performance speciﬁcation version of ADS-33E (Ref. 6.92). The changes from the C-
version, used throughout Chapter 6, have been numerous and no attempt has been made
to fully revise the material presented earlier. Rather, a number of key developments are
highlighted here to draw speciﬁc attention to them.
ADS-33 contains the ﬁrst truly mission-oriented set of requirements, embodied
in the fact that the location of criteria boundaries are related to the types of ‘mission-
task-element’ to be ﬂown, rather than the aircraft size or weight. In ADS-33E-PRF
the aircraft role (i.e., attack, scout, utility, cargo) is then described by a subset of
recommended MTEs to be ﬂown and level of agility used (i.e., limited, moderate,
aggressive, tracking). The objective criteria then link with the MTEs in two ways –
through the Response Type table (see Table 7.4) and also the level of agility associated
with an MTE that, in turn, deﬁnes the handling qualities boundary to be used. An
example from Ref. 6.92 is the set of requirements for large amplitude attitude changes
in hover and low-speed ﬂight, i.e., the control power, shown in Table 6.6. The normal
levels of agility for the 13 different MTEs that are used to deﬁne the control power
requirements are deﬁned. For example, slaloms would normally be ﬂown at moderate
levels of agility while the acceleration–deceleration would require aggressive agility.
A change to the closed-loop stability requirements appears in the bandwidth for
the general or ‘all other’ MTEs in a UCE > 1 and/or divided attention. Figure 6.74
should be compared with Fig. 6.30(c), showing the shift of the Level 2/3 boundary from
0.5 rad/s to 1 rad/s; the boundary is also raised for forward ﬂight. Generally speaking,
less research has been conducted to deﬁne the Level 2/3 handling qualities boundary
than that conducted for the Level 1/2 boundary; it is known that pilot perception of

handling qualities at the Level 2/3 boundary is very dependent on skill and training.
Considering the simple ﬁrst-order roll response (analysis from eqn 6.2 and Fig. 6.3), a
bandwidth of 0.5 corresponds to a roll time constant of 2 s, and it is not surprising that
a pilot would experience major difﬁculties ﬂying the precision elements of a slalom or
a sidestep, faced with such response lags.

 
Objective Assessment and Criteria Development

The attitude quickness criteria remain as documented in ADS-33C, apart from
clariﬁcation on the testing requirements, particularly relating to the need for the pilot
to change attitude ‘as rapidly as possible without signiﬁcant reversals in the sign
of the cockpit control input’. Control overshoots are known to result in increased
quickness and give a ‘false’ sense of agility, even though the pilot might commonly
use this technique to change attitude. The point is also emphasized that the full range
of moderate amplitudes should be covered. Figures 6.10 and 6.18 showed what we
described as closed-loop quickness (pilot using overshoot technique) for the Lynx
ﬂying slalom and sidestep MTEs, measured across a wide range of attitude changes.
A signiﬁcant change is that aircraft with response types appropriate to UCE = 2 and
3 no longer have to meet the quickness requirements, on the basis that operations in
DVEs require only limited agility.
In Section 6.5.3, discussion centred around the complexities of helicopter ﬂight
path control in forward ﬂight and the shortcomings of the requirements of ADS-33C
were highlighted, particularly relating to testing difﬁculties, and the distinctly non-
ﬁrst-order response of some types (e.g., see Fig. 6.58). In ADS-33E-PRF, new criteria
have been introduced for ﬂight path behaviour in response to a pitch attitude change
through cyclic pitch with collective ﬁxed. Criteria are distinguished for front-side and
back-side (of the power curve) operations. If 
γss is the change in ﬂight path and 
Vss
is the change in speed resulting from a step change in pitch attitude, then
Front-side operation

γss/
Vss < 0
(6.41)
Back-side operation

γss/
Vss ≥0
(6.42)
For back-side operation, the ﬂight path handling requirements are essentially the same
as the low-speed height response to collective requirements discussed in Section 6.51,
except that the maximum value of the time constant, T˙heq , for Level 2 handling, is
reduced to 10 s. For front-side operation, the criteria is based on the lag between ﬂight
path and pitch attitude (equivalent to the heave time constant, or inverse of the derivative
−Zw, at low frequency), expressed in the frequency domain as follows: the lag should
be<45◦atallfrequenciesbelow0.4rad/sforLevel1,andbelow0.25rad/sforLevel2.It
is considered that these criteria are still open to development, particularly for complex
precision approach trajectories envisaged to enable the expansion of simultaneous,
non-interfering operations of helicopter at busy hubs.
Finally, we turn to cross-coupling criteria and Fig. 6.75 summarizes the vari-
ous important cross-coupling effects found in helicopters. The starred boxes denote
response couplings for which no handling criteria exist.
Requirements in ADS-33 include detailed quantitative ratio criteria, for example,
the roll to pitch or collective to yaw, and also qualitative ‘not objectionable’ type state-
ments, although the ﬂight path response to pitch attitude changes has been developed
in Ref. 6.92 into the quantitative criteria described in the previous paragraph. Cross-
couplings emerge as a serious impediment to task performance for manoeuvres where
higher levels of precision and aggressiveness are required, and this has been taken into
account in Ref. 6.92 by requiring that the coupling requirements on yaw from collective
and pitch–roll and roll–pitch be applicable to aircraft that need to meet the aggressive
and acquisition/tracking levels of agility. New requirements have been developed for
the tracking level of agility based on the research reported in Refs 6.93 and 6.94, which

Fig. 6.75 Dynamic response criteria for cross-couplings or off-axis response
identiﬁed the frequency dependence of the handling qualities for small amplitude track-
ing. In Fig. 6.76 the response ratios (average q/p (dB), average p/q (dB)) are derived
from the amplitudes of the frequency response functions q/δlat divided by p/δlat and
p/δlong divided by q/δlong, averaged between the attitude bandwidth frequency and
frequency at which the attitude response phase is −180◦. The requirements focus on
the pitch due to roll requirements, derived from tests where pitch control was disrupted
by varying levels of coupling during a roll tracking task (Ref. 6.93).
The methodology expressed in ADS-33 has been applied extensively since the
publication of the ﬁrst edition of this book. Some guidance for the tailoring of the
requirements to speciﬁc roles was given in Ref. 6.95. In the United Kingdom an initial
emphasis was placed on the application to the attack helicopter procurement competi-
tion (Ref. 6.96), while in mainland Europe to the design and development of the NH90
(Ref. 6.97). A continuing theme in the research community has been the development
of a maritime version of ADS-33, with particular application to operations to and from
ships. A series of ﬂight and ﬂight simulation trials have been conducted and results
reported (Refs 6.98–6.101), which have guided speciﬁc applications, but no generally
accepted and conclusive product has emerged. What seems to be universally agreed,
however, is that (Ref. 6.101) ‘Level 1 handling qualities are not achievable at high sea

Fig. 6.76 Pitch–roll cross-coupling requirements for target acquisition and tracking MTEs
states using current landing practices with standard levels of aircraft augmentation’. A
somewhat similar situation has arisen with regard to extending the scout/attack heli-
copterrequirements–originallythefocusofADS-33–tocargohelicopters,particularly
for operations with external, underslung loads. References 6.102–6.104 document part
of the story, but ultimately ADS-33E-PRF, in its discussion on the ﬂight and simulation
tests conducted to develop criteria, concludes that, ‘The outcome of this testing has been
overwhelming evidence that quantitative criteria will be extremely difﬁcult to derive’.
In Ref. 6.105 a comprehensive analysis of the handling qualities of the UH-60M prior to
ﬁrst ﬂight is reported, demonstrating the utility of the methodology to vehicle upgrades.
The author’s own research has also taken the methodology into new directions,
particularly the relationship between handling qualities and loads. In Ref. 6.106, for
example, some of the structural fatigue issues in helicopter ﬂight testing are addressed,
with particular emphasis to ﬂying qualities tests. In Ref. 6.107 an approach to integrat-
ing the handling qualities/agility and load alleviation design processes is presented,
taking advantage of and extending the ADS-33 metrics to embrace both disciplines.
Finally, it seems appropriate to brieﬂy mention the main intended recipient of the
ADS-33 development efforts, the RAH-66 Comanche. The programme was cancelled
on 23 February 2004, but not before the aircraft had demonstrated the fruits of the ef-
fort to design and build the ﬁrst helicopter with Level 1 handling qualities throughout
the OFE, at least in the good visual environment (Ref. 6.108). A salutary lesson lies
in the conclusions of Ref. 6.108, however, that ‘. . . while the analytical requirements
of ADS-33D, Section 3, are an indispensable resource for control law development,
they do not obviate the requirement for a vigorous ﬂight test programme with active
engagement between pilot and engineers, without which many of the critical improve-
ments . . . would not have been possible’. With these words, the authors of Ref. 6.108
lead us naturally to the subject of subjective pilot assessment and the assigned handling
qualities.

Flying qualities: subjective
assessment and other topics
If test manoeuvres are too dangerous for a skilled test pilot to perform in
a tightly controlled environment, it is unreasonable to expect the user to
ﬂy such manoeuvres in an unfamiliar, unfriendly environment in the fog
of war.
(Key, 1993)
7.1
Introduction and Scope
While objective measurements and assessment are necessary for demonstrating com-
pliance with quality standards, they are still not sufﬁcient to ensure that a new he-
licopter will be safe in achieving its operational goals. Gaps in the criteria due to
limited test data, and the drive to extend operations to new areas, continue to make it
vital that additional piloted tests, with a subjective orientation, are conducted prior to
certiﬁcation. A further issue relates to the robustness of the criteria and an aircraft’s
ﬂying qualities at higher levels of performance. The point has been made on several
occasions that criteria in standards like ADS-33 represent the minimum levels to en-
sure Level 1 in normal operation. A good design will do better than just meet the
objective Level 1 requirements, and the absence of upper limits on most of the han-
dling parameters means that there is practically no guidance as to when or whether
handling might degrade again. An aircraft will need to be ﬂight tested to assess its
ﬂying qualities in a range of mission task elements MTEs, throughout its intended
operational ﬂight envelope (OFE), and including operations at the performance lim-
its to expose any potential handling cliff edges. During such testing, measurements
will be made of aircraft task performance and control activity, but there is, as yet,
no practical substitute for pilot subjective opinion. The measurement and interpreta-
tion of pilot opinion is a continuing theme throughout this chapter but is exclusively
the subject of Section 7.2, where a range of topics are covered, including handling
qualities ratings (HQRs), MTEs and the design and conduct of a handling qualities
experiment.
Section 7.3 deals with a selection of what we have described as special ﬂying
qualities, including agility, carefree handling and ﬂight in poor visual conditions.
One of the areas omitted from the comprehensive treatment of objective assess-
ment in Chapter 6 was the requirements for pilot’s inceptors or controllers. The issues
surrounding the assessment of quality for inceptors, particularly sidesticks, are so pilot
centred that coverage in this chapter was considered more appropriate; Section 7.4
deals with this topic.
For both military and civil helicopters, the potential improvements in ﬂying qual-
ities offered by active control technology (ACT) through the almost inﬁnite variety

 
456
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
of response shaping, where computers take on the ‘compensation’, have prompted a
more serious examination of the beneﬁts of improved ﬂying qualities to safety and
performance. Helicopters’ accidents and incidents due to so-called pilot error are still
far too high and many can be attributed to poor ﬂying qualities in a broad sense. Even
those accidents caused by system failures can ultimately be attributed to degraded
ﬂying qualities, as the pilot struggles to ﬂy a disabled aircraft to a safe landing. With
these ideas in mind, Section 7.5 examines the contribution of ﬂying qualities to per-
formance and safety by viewing the pilot as a system element, with the potential of
failing when under ‘stress’, and outlines a new approach to quantifying the risk of
failure.
7.2
The Subjective Assessment of Flying Quality
Opinion on what constitutes quality when it comes to ﬂying has been demonstrated over
the years to be wide and varied amongst pilots, and will undoubtedly continue to be so.
Individuals can have different preferences and achieving universal agreement over all
aspects of quality is probably unrealistic, and perhaps even undesirable. Fortunately,
pilots, like most of the human race, are exceptionally adaptable and can learn to use
someone else’s favourite ﬂight vehicle very effectively. If we consider ﬂying quality to
be valued in both aesthetic and functional terms by pilots, then by far the most effort
has been expended by ﬂying qualities engineers on trying to establish a consensus
regarding functional quality. This effort has received considerable leverage through
the development of mission-oriented or functional ﬂying qualities criteria. Prior to
this, over several decades, the merging of functional values with aesthetic values has
led to ﬂying quality being a ‘nice to have’ attribute rather than essential for achieving
safety and performance. The importance of aesthetic quality is recognized, but treating
this aspect is beyond the scope of this engineering text. The emphasis with mission-
oriented ﬂying qualities is the ability to perform a deﬁned set of tasks with temporal
and spatial constraints, and what better test of quality than ﬂying the tasks themselves.
When ﬂying a task, or to use the parlance of ADS-33 (Ref. 7.1), an MTE, the pilot will
adopt a control strategy to maximize performance and minimize workload. Control
strategy may vary from pilot to pilot, reﬂecting the complex network of inﬂuences
on how different pilots elect to use their controls. Figure 7.1, taken from Ref. 7.2,
illustrates the point. The task requirements in a given environment will determine the
accuracy and spare workload capacity required; McRuer has described this through
the dual concepts of attentional demand and spare control capacity (Ref. 7.3). Landing
a helicopter on the deck of a small ship may require considerable accuracy, and a pilot
may well take his time to achieve a safe landing. Evading a threat may place greater
demands on acting quickly than ﬂying precisely. Whatever the drivers, the combination
of vehicle response characteristics and task cues will determine the control strategy
adopted by the pilot, which in turn will be reﬂected in the realized task performance and
actual pilot workload. In making a subjective assessment of the ﬂying quality, a pilot
will need to take into account these interacting inﬂuences and then articulate his or her
thoughts to the ﬂying qualities engineer, whose job at this stage is to make changes for
the better, if at all possible. It is the articulation and the associated interpretation of the
pilot’s subjective opinion that underpins any successful development of ﬂying qualities,

and it is hardly surprising that this activity has been ‘assisted’ by a wide range of
different support tools including rating scales and questionnaires. One rating scale has
achieved more universal acceptance than any other since it was ﬁrst proposed in the late
1960s – the Cooper and Harper handling qualities rating scale (Ref. 7.4). In view of its
importance to the subject and partly to highlight potential misuses, the next subsection
will give exclusive coverage to this scale and the associated pilot handling qualities
rating (HQR).
7.2.1
Pilot handling qualities ratings – HQRs
Figure 7.2 illustrates the decision tree format of the Cooper–Harper handling qualities
rating scale. Test pilots and ﬂying qualities engineers need to be intimately familiar
with its format, its intended uses and potential misuses. Before we begin a discussion
on the rating scale, we refer the reader back to Fig. 7.1 and to the key inﬂuences on
control strategy which should be reﬂected in pilot opinion; we could look even further
back to Fig. 6.1, highlighting the internal attributes and external factors as inﬂuences
on ﬂying qualities. The pilot judges quality in terms of his or her ability to perform a
task, usually requiring closed-loop control action. A key point in both ﬁgures is that
the handling qualities and pilot control strategy are a result of the combined quality of
the aircraft characteristics and the task cues. The same aircraft can be Level 1 ﬂying
routine operations at day and then Level 3 at night, or when the wind blows hard, or
when the pilot tries to accomplish a landing in a conﬁned area. An aircraft may be
improved from Level 3 to 2 by providing the pilot with a night vision aid or from Level
2 to 1 by including appropriate symbology on a helmet-mounted display. Handling
qualities are task dependent and that includes the natural environmental conditions in
which the task is to be performed, and the pilot will be rating the situation as much as
the aircraft. We will discuss the scale and HQRs in the form of a set of rules of thumb
for their application.

(1) Follow the decision tree from left to right. Pilots should arrive at their ratings by
working through the decision tree systematically. This is rule number 1 because it
helps the pilot to address the critical issue of whether the aircraft is Level 1, 2 or 3 in
the intended task or subtask. The decision tree solicits from the pilot his opinion of
the aircraft’s ability to achieve deﬁned performance levels at perceived levels of
workload.
(2) An HQR is a summary of pilot subjective opinion on the workload required to ﬂy a
task with a deﬁned level of performance. An HQR can be meaningless without
back-up pilot comment. It is the recorded pilot opinion which will be used to make
technical decisions, not the HQR, because the HQR does not tell the engineer or his
manager what the problems are. Often a structured approach to qualitative
assessment will draw on a questionnaire that ensures that all the subject pilots
address at least a common set of issues. We will consider the ingredients of a
questionnaire in more detail later.
(3) Pilot HQRs should be a reﬂection of an aircraft’s ability to perform an operational
role. The MTEs should be designed with realistic performance requirements and
realistic task constraints. The pilot then needs to base his rating on his judgement of
how an ‘average’ pilot with normal additional tactical duties could be expected to
perform in a similar real-world task.
(4) Task performance and workload come together to make up the rating, but workload
should be the driver. This is most important. To highlight the emphasis we refer to
Fig. 7.3 where workload and task performance are shown as two dimensions in the
piloting trade-off. Task performance is shown in three categories – desired, adequate
and inadequate. Workload is also shown in three categories – low, moderate to
extensive and maximum tolerable, reﬂecting the rating scale parlance. HQRs on the
Cooper – Harper scale fall into the areas shown shaded. Figure 7.3 acknowledges
that a pilot may be able to work very hard (e.g., using maximum tolerable

compensation) and achieve desired performance, but it is not appropriate then to
return a Level 1 rating. Instead, he should aim for adequate performance with some
spare workload capacity. Similarly, a pilot should not be satisﬁed with achieving
adequate performance at low workload; he should strive to do better. A common
target for pilots in this situation would be to try to achieve desired performance at the
lower end of Level 2, i.e., HQR 4. Level 1 characteristics should be reserved for the
very best, those aircraft that are ﬁt for operational service. An HQR 4 means that the
aircraft is almost good enough, but deﬁciencies still warrant improvement.
(5) Two wrongs can make a disaster. Handling qualities experiments often focus on one
response axis at a time, two at the most. We have seen in Chapter 6 how much it
takes to be a Level 1 helicopter, and a question often arises as to how much one or
two deﬁciencies, among other superb qualities, can degrade an aircraft. The answer
is that any Level 2 or 3 deﬁciency will degrade the whole vehicle. A second point is
that several Level 2 deﬁciencies can accumulate into a Level 3 aircraft.
Unfortunately, there seems to be very little rotorcraft data on this topic, but Hoh has
given a hint of the potential degradations in the advisory ‘product rule’ (Ref. 7.5)
Rm = 10 + −1(m+1)
8.3(m−1)
m

(Ri −10)
(7.1)
where Rm is the predicted overall rating and Ri are the predicted ratings in the
individual m axes. According to the above, two individual HQR 5s would lead to a
multi-axis rating of 7. The fragile nature of such prediction algorithms emphasizes
the critical role of the pilot in judging overall handling qualities and the importance
of tasks that properly exercise the aircraft in its multi-axis roles. So while sidesteps
and quickhops might be appropriate MTEs for establishing roll and pitch control
power requirements, the evaluations should culminate with tasks that require the
pilot to check the harmony when ﬂying a mixed roll–pitch manoeuvre. Ultimately,
the combined handling should be evaluated in real missions with the attendant
mission duties, before being passed as ﬁt for duty.
(6) The HQR scale is an ordinal one, and the intervals are far from uniform. For
example, a pilot returning an HQR of 6 is not necessarily working twice as hard as
when he returns an HQR of 3; Cooper and Harper, in discussing this topic, suggest
that ‘. . . the change in pilot rating per unit quality should be the same throughout the
rating scale’. The implied workload nonlinearity has not hindered the almost
universal practice of averaging ratings and analysing their statistical signiﬁcance.
Many examples in this book present HQRs with a mean and outer ratings shown, so
the author clearly supports simple arithmetic operations with HQRs. However, this
practice should be undertaken with great care, particularly paying attention to the
extent of the rating spread. If this is large, with ratings for one conﬁguration
appearing in all three levels for example, then averaging would seem to be
inappropriate. If the rating spread is only 1 or 2 points, then it is likely that the pilots
are ‘experiencing’ the same handling qualities. Of course, if the ratings still cross a
boundary, and the mean value works out at close to 3.5 or 6.5, then it may be
necessary to put more pilots through the evaluation or explore some task variations.
The whole issue of averaging, which can make data presentation so appealing, has to
be undertaken in the light of the pilots’ subjective comments. Clearly, it would be

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
461
inappropriate to average a group of ratings when the perceived handling deﬁciencies
recorded in each of the pilot’s notes were different.
(7) Are non-whole ratings legal? There appears to be universal agreement that pilots
should not give ratings of 3.5 or 6.5; there is no space here to sit on the fence and the
trial engineer should always reinforce this point. Beyond this restriction, there seems
to be no good reason to limit pilots to the whole numbers, provided they can explain
why they need to award ratings at the ﬁner detail. A good example is the ‘distance’
between HQR 4 and 5. It is one of the most important in the rating scale and pilots
should be particularly careful not to get stuck in the handling qualities ‘potential
well’ syndrome of the HQR 4. In many ways the step from HQR 4 to HQR 5 is a
bigger workload step than from 3 to 4 and pilots may feel the need to return HQRs
between 4 and 5; equally, pilots may prefer to distinguish between good and very
good conﬁgurations in the region between HQR 2 and 3.
(8) How many pilots make a good rating? This question is always raised when
designing a handling qualities experiment. The obvious trade-off involving the data
value is expressed in terms of authenticity versus economy. Three pilots seems to be
the bare minimum with four or ﬁve likely to lead to a more reliable result and six
being optimal for establishing conﬁdence in the average HQR (Ref. 7.6). For a
well-designed handling qualities experiment, there will inevitably be variations in
pilot ratings as a result of different pilot backgrounds, skill level, pilots’ perception
of cues, their natural piloting techniques and standards to which they are accustomed
(e.g., one pilot’s HQR 4 might be another’s 5). Measuring this ‘scatter’ is an
important part of the process of understanding how well the aircraft will work in
practice. But if the scatter is greater than about two ratings, the engineer may need to
consider redesigning the experiment.
(9) How to know when things are going wrong. A wide variation of ratings for the same
MTE should ring alarm bells for the trial engineer. There are many legitimate
reasons for a spread in HQRs but also some illegitimate ones. One reason could be
that the pilots are not ﬂying the same task. Part of the task deﬁnition are the
standards for desired and adequate performance. These will be based on some
realistic scenario, e.g., sidestep from one cover point to another, 100 m distant, and
establish a hover within a deﬁned world-referenced box, with permitted errors up to,
say, 2 m. The task deﬁnition might also add that the pilot should maintain his ﬂight
path below 10 m above the ground and accomplish the task in a deﬁned time. The
more detail that is added to the task deﬁnition, the more likely it is that each pilot
will try to ﬂy the same MTE and the more the HQR scatter will be left to pilot
differences, which is what is required. Conversely, the less detail there is, the more
likely is the chance of different pilots interpreting the task differently; one may ﬂy
the task in 15 s, another in 20 s and the different demands will drive the workload
and hence ratings. Next to the need for complete and coherent task deﬁnition comes
the need to provide the pilot with sufﬁcient cues to enable him to judge his task
performance. This is a critical issue. In real-world scenarios, pilots will judge their
own task performance requirements and they will usually do this on the basis of
requiring low to moderate pilot compensation. Pilots do not usually choose to ﬂy at
high levels of workload, unless they have to, and will normally set performance
requirements based on task cues that they can clearly perceive. Unless a pilot has
made an error of judgement, he or she will not normally ﬂy into a condition where
the task cues are insufﬁcient for guidance and stabilization. In clinical ﬂying

qualities tests, it is important for the trials engineer to work closely with the
‘work-up’ pilot to deﬁne realistic performance goals that an average pilot would be
expected to perceive in operations. Then, when the pilot returns an HQR, the actual
task performance achieved should correlate well with that perceived by the pilot.
Unless properly addressed, this issue can devalue results of handling qualities
experiments. A third factor in HQR scatter deserves a rule all on its own.
(10) How long before a pilot is ready to give a rating? There is no simple answer to this
question, but pilots and engineers should be sensitive to the effects of learning with a
new conﬁguration. Brieﬂy, pilots should be allowed enough time to familiarize with
a conﬁguration, for general ﬂying and in the test MTEs, before they are ready to ﬂy
the evaluation runs. The DLR test technique, adopted during in-ﬂight simulation
trials, involves computing the ‘score factor’ of the MTE, i.e., the ratio of successive
performance measures (Fig. 7.4, Ref. 7.7). When the score factor rises above a
pre-deﬁned level, then the pilot is at least achieving repeatable task performance, if
not workload. Ultimately, the pilot should judge when he is ready to give a formal
evaluation and the trial engineer should resist forcing a ‘half-baked’ HQR.
Something for both the test pilot and the engineer to bear in mind is that the
subjective comments recorded during the learning phase are very important for
understanding the basis for the eventual HQR; a communicative pilot will usually
have a lot of very useful things to say at this stage. This brings us to the subject of
communication between the pilot and engineer and ﬂying qualities jargon.
(11) Interpreting test pilot talk. In handling qualities evaluations, test pilots will use a
variety of descriptors within their subjective comment to explain the impact of good
and bad characteristics. To simplify this discussion, we will relate two categories –
the classical pilot qualitative language, e.g., sluggish, crisp, smooth and predictable,
and the engineering parlance, e.g., control power, damping and bandwidth. HQRs
are the summary of pilot comment, and it is important that the pilot comment is

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
463
consistent and understandable; once again, it is the pilot comment that directs the
engineer towards improvement. Two observations on pilot comment are worth
highlighting here. First, any classical parlance should be deﬁned in terms relating to
task; e.g., the roll response of this aircraft is sluggish because it takes too long to
achieve the required bank angle. There is no universal dictionary for classical
parlance so it is a good idea to establish agreed meanings early in a trial; the HQRs
will then be more valuable. Second, it is the author’s considered opinion that test
pilots should be strongly discouraged from using engineering parlance during
evaluations, unless they are conversant with the engineering background. Sometimes
quite different engineering parameters can lead to similar effects and if pilots try to
associate effects with causes, they run the risk of making predictive judgements
based on what they think will be the case. Engineers need test pilots to tell them
what aspects are good or bad and not try to diagnose why. Ironically, it is the very
skill that test pilots are valued for – the ability to think about and interpret their
response – that can spoil their ratings. When it comes to the evaluation, deeply
learned and instinctive skills are being exercised and, to an extent, thinking can
intrude on this process. It is far better for test pilots to describe their workload in
terms that are subjective but unambiguous.
(12) When is an HQR not an HQR? During the assembly of a handling qualities database,
conﬁgurations will be evaluated that span the range from good to bad, and pilots
need not think that it is their fault if they cannot achieve the performance targets.
During the development of a new product, ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies may appear
and the test pilots need to present their ﬁndings in a detached manner. Above all, test
pilots that participate in such evaluations need to be free from commercial
constraints or programme commitments that might inﬂuence their ratings. This point
is stressed by Hoh in Ref. 7.8. Eventually it will be in both the user’s and
manufacturer’s interest to establish the best level of ﬂying quality.
(13) Pilot fatigue – when does an HQR lose its freshness? This will certainly vary from
pilot to pilot and task to task, but evaluation periods between 45 and 90 min seem
from experience to cover an acceptable range. The pilot fatigue level, and to an extent
this can be inﬂuenced by their attitude to the evaluation, can be a primary cause for
spread in HQRs. The pilot is usually the best judge of when his performance is being
impaired by fatigue, but a useful practice is to introduce a reference conﬁguration
into the test matrix on occasions as a means of pilot calibration.
(14) HQRs are absolute, not relative. This is an important rule, but perhaps the most
difﬁcult to apply or live by, especially if several different aircraft are being compared
in an experiment; there will always be the temptation for the pilot to compare an
aircraft or conﬁguration with another that has already achieved a particular standard
and been awarded a rating. Disciplined use of the Cooper–Harper decision tree
should help the pilots resist this temptation, and appropriate training and good early
practice would seem to be the best preventative medicine for this particular bad habit.
(15) The HQR is for the aircraft, not for the pilot. Piloting workload determines the rating
but the rating needs to be attributed to characteristics of the aircraft and task cues as
deﬁned in the Cooper–Harper rating scale. Emphasis on HQR, rather than pilot
rating, can help with this important distinction.
(16) An HQR does not tell the whole story. In this last point we reiterate rule number 2
that every HQR should be accompanied by a sheet of pilot comments to give the full
story. This can often be derived as a series of answers on a questionnaire addressing

 
464
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
the various aspects covered in the Cooper–Harper decision tree – vehicle
characteristics, workload (compensation) and task performance; task cues also need
to be addressed, and the absence of any reference to task cues in the Cooper–Harper
decision tree is explained by the assumption that sufﬁcient task cues exist for ﬂying
the task. The subject of task cues and the need for pilot subjective impressions of the
quality of task cues have received more prominence with the introduction of vision
aids to support ﬂying at night and in poor weather. This topic is addressed further in
Section 7.3.3.
These 16 rules represent this ﬂying qualities engineer’s assessment of the important
facets of the subjective measurement scale and the HQR. Put together, the issues raised
above highlight the importance of the special skills required of test pilots, enhanced
by extensive training programmes. To examine how these work in practice, we need
to discuss the design, conduct and test results from handling qualities evaluations.
7.2.2
Conducting a handling qualities experiment
Depending on the objectives, a handling qualities experiment can commit ﬂight or
ground-based simulation facilities and a trials team for periods from several days to
several weeks or even months. The subjective and objective data gathered may take
months or even years to be analysed fully. The success, and hence value, of such an
endeavour rests heavily on the experimental design and trials planning. There are a
multitude of issues involved here, most of which would be inappropriate for discussion
in this book. One of the critical elements is the design of the MTEs in which the
handling qualities are to be evaluated. This has already been raised as an important
issue in the discussion on HQRs above; the task performance drives the workload,
which drives the pilot rating. Before we examine results from a handling experiment,
it is worth looking more closely at the design of an MTE.
Designing a mission task element
The concept of the MTE was introduced in Chapter 2, the Introductory Tour to this
book. Any mission can be analysed in terms of mission phases and MTEs and sample
manoeuvres. An MTE is identiﬁable by its clearly deﬁned start and end conditions.
To be viable as a test for handling qualities, an MTE also needs to be deﬁned in
terms of spatial and temporal constraints. Above all, the constraints need to be related
to real operational needs, or the data will be of questionable value and test pilots
will quickly lose interest. During the 10 years between 1984 and 1994, the MTE has
become central to the development of military handling qualities criteria and work
reported at conferences, specialist meetings and in journals abound with examples of
different MTEs and related HQR diagrams. At the core of these activities, the ADS-
33 MTEs have evolved into a set of mature test manoeuvres, aimed at providing the
acid test for new military helicopters. In the early 1990s, a major reﬁnement exercise
was undertaken on these manoeuvres, as reported in Refs 7.9–7.11. The emphases of
the reﬁnements were (Ref. 7.10) ease of understanding, mission-oriented performance
standards for good and degraded visual environments (DVEs), simple task cueing and
affordable instrumentation. In this programme, several current operational helicopters
were used in a ﬂight test activity that served to concentrate attention on ﬂight safety
issues. Handling qualities testing, by its very nature, carries risk as the boundaries to

safe operation are mapped out. The new ADS-33 MTEs were designed to highlight
any deﬁciencies in a pseudo-operational context and test programmes will certainly
need to give a higher level of attention to safety than previously. The importance and
justiﬁcation for this approach is well summarized by Key in Ref. 7.10 when referring
to the AH-64 ADS-33 ﬂight tests: ‘Some of the aggressive manoeuvres, especially in
DVE, were quite thrilling. . .if they are too dangerous for a skilled test pilot to perform
in a tightly controlled environment, it is unreasonable to expect the user to ﬂy such
manoeuvres in an unfamiliar, unfriendly environment in the fog of war’.
The test manoeuvres proposed for the new Military Standard (Ref. 7.12) are
summarized in Table 7.1, and include both GVE (good visual environment) and DVE
cases.
Figure 7.5, taken from Ref. 7.9, illustrates results from handling qualities tests
during development of the reﬁned MTEs using three test aircraft – the NRC variable
stability Bell 205, the AH-64A and the UH-60A; the 205 was tested with both Level 1
and 2 response characteristics, according to the objective ADS-33 criteria. ADS-33 was
targeted at a new design of course, the RAH-66 Comanche, so it is hardly surprising
that current operational aircraft appear as good Level 2 on average.
To illustrate an MTE in more detail we have chosen the lateral sidestep reposi-
tioning manoeuvre and also to compare the ADS-33 task description and performance
standards with those developed for the DRA’s ACT research programme (Ref. 7.13).
The layout of the sidestep ground markers for the DRA ACT simulations is sketched
in Fig. 7.6 and quantiﬁed in Table 7.2. The pilot is required to initiate the MTE from a
hover point with the triangle and square aligned, sidestepping to a new hover position
again aligning the triangle and square. There is a close comparison between the DRA
and ADS-33 manoeuvres, but the DRA requirements are slightly more demanding,
reﬂecting the expected improvements conferred by full authority ACT. Important dif-
ferences appear in the temporal and spatial constraints, with the DRA placing more
emphasisonmeasuringtheeffectsofpilotingaggressiveness(threelevelsspeciﬁed)and
repositioning at a deﬁned point, to introduce a realistic spatial constraint. In contrast,

Fig. 7.6 Layout of the DRA sidestep MTE (Ref. 7.13)
the ADS-33 standards place more emphasis on pilots’ achieving close to maximum
lateral velocities with aggressiveness deﬁned by the times to accelerate and decelerate.
Evaluating roll axis handling characteristics
Roll axis handling characteristics have ﬁgured prominently in Chapter 6, where many
of the new concepts associated with modern mission-oriented response criteria were
introduced and the development processes described. As we continue the discussion of
subjective measurement and assessment we return to this reference topic and present
results of tests conducted at the DRA in the early 1990s utilizing the ground-based
ﬂying qualities facility – the advanced ﬂight simulator (Ref. 7.13). Before discussing
details of this work it is appropriate to review the original data that contributed to
the deﬁnition of satisfactory roll axis characteristics, in particular the small amplitude
bandwidth criteria. In Ref. 7.14, Condon highlighted the point that during the early
1980s the ﬁdelity of ground-based simulators was considered inadequate for deﬁning

Both sidesteps are intended to assess lateral directional handling qualities for aggressive
manoeuvring near the rotorcraft limits of performance. The ﬂight path constraints
reﬂect operations close to the ground and obstacles. Secondary objectives are to check
for any objectionable cross-couplings and to evaluate the ability to coordinate bank
angle and collective to hold constant altitude.
Task description
Both sidesteps require the pilot to reposition from hover to hover with a lateral
manoeuvre maintaining task performance requirements as shown above. The ADS-33
sidestep puts emphasis on achieving close to limiting lateral velocity without step size
constraints. The DRA ACT sidestep places emphasis on repositioning to a particular
location, hence requiring the pilot to judge the acceleration and deceleration phases
carefully, on the basis that an operational sidestep is likely to have relatively tight
terminal position constraints. The ADS-33 step requires the pilot to achieve a minimum
bank angle in a maximum time during the accel and decel phases. The DRA ACT
sidestep requires the pilot to ﬂy at three initial bank angles to quantify the effects of
pilot aggressiveness.
the Level 1/2 boundaries for rate command rotorcraft. Figure 7.7, from Ref. 7.11,
shows how HQRs derived from the NRC Bell 205 compare with those derived from
the NASA VMS facility, for equivalent MTEs. As a result of this kind of comparison,
ground-based simulation data were considered unreliable and were not used in the
early development of ADS-33 for rate command systems. Problems were attributed
to a number of different areas including poor visual cueing, particularly ﬁne detail
and ﬁeld-of-view, the harmony between visual and motion cues and time delays in
the cue development, all areas where there were no equivalent ﬂight problems. During
the late 1980s and early 1990s, simulation technology improved signiﬁcantly and a
number of studies were reported with varying degrees of success, but all acknowledged

continuing limitations compared with in-ﬂight simulation (Refs 7.14–7.16). With the
commissioning of the DRA’s AFS for helicopter research in 1991, it was considered
important to calibrate handling qualities results for rate command systems to deter-
mine whether the ﬁdelity of the AFS was good enough for deﬁnitive ﬂying qualities
research. The study, reported in Ref. 7.13, explored roll and pitch axes with a primary
objective of establishing at what values of attitude bandwidth pilots would start return-
ing Level 1 ratings consistently, if at all. The trial was conﬁgured with a futuristic ACT
helicopter, with a two-axis sidestick, conventional collective and pedals, with primary
ﬂight instruments displayed head-up and pure rate response characteristics.
The key elements of the experiment are summarized in Fig. 7.8, showing the large
motion system, computer-generated imagery (CGI) visuals, generic helicopter cockpit
and the conceptual simulation model (CSM). A number of MTEs were developed on the
CGI database that included sufﬁcient textural detail for the evaluation pilots to perceive
the desired and adequate task performance standards clearly. The photographs in Fig.
7.9 show the layout of four of the critical MTEs for evaluating roll and pitch handling at
low speed and in forward ﬂight – the low-speed sidestep and quickhop and the forward
ﬂight lateral jinking and hurdles. The task deﬁnitions included speciﬁcation of the level
of task aggressiveness to be ﬂown by the pilots, as illustrated in the sidestep in Table
7.2 where initial bank angle was used as the deﬁning parameter. We will return to the
results for the sidestep later, but ﬁrst we will consider the lateral jinking MTE in more
detail, shown in plan form in Fig. 7.10, with the task performance standards deﬁned in
Table 7.3.
The lateral jinking or slalom manoeuvre is essentially a forward ﬂight roll axis
task comprising a sequence of ‘S’ turn manoeuvres followed by line tracking elements,
as pilots attempt to ﬂy through the gates shown in Fig. 7.10. Secondary handling
qualities considerations include the ability to coordinate turns with pitch and yaw
controlandtheharmonizeduseofcollectiveandrolltomaintainheight.Taskaggression
is deﬁned in terms of the maximum roll attitude used during the turning phases; values
of 15◦, 30◦and 45◦were found appropriate for designating low, moderate and high
aggressiveness. These levels correspond to relaxed ﬂying, normal operations with a

degree of urgency and emergency or other life-threatening situations, respectively. The
task objective is to ﬂy through the course whilst maintaining a height of 8 m and a speed
of 60 knots, turning at the designated gates to acquire the new tracking line as quickly
as possible, within the constraints of the set level of aggression. The turning gates are
represented by adjacent vertical posts, which also provide height cueing – the white
band on the posts delineating the desired performance margin. The intermediate gates
were added to give enhanced tracking cues supplementing the runway lines. The width
of the gates was determined by the adequate margin of performance for the tracking
task (±20 ft/6 m).

damping of 9 rad/s). The ﬁrst digit assigns the control sensitivity (T1 = 0.1, T3 = 0.2,
T5 = 0.3 rad/s2 per %). All conﬁgurations share the same roll control power, 96 deg/s,
hence the control sensitivity increased in proportion with the damping. Contributions
to the approximate 110-ms phase delay for all three conﬁgurations include the actuator
lag and pure time delay from the AFS system computing and image generation. It is
interesting to note that the bandwidth of conﬁguration T509, with a natural damping
of 9 rad/s, is reduced to 3 rad/s by the time delays. Conﬁguration T306 + 80 included
80-ms additional pure time delay. The conﬁgurations spanned the ADS-33C Level
1/2 handling qualities boundary for general MTEs situated at 2 rad/s.
The trial was ﬂown by six test pilots whose HQRs are shown as a function of roll
bandwidth in Fig. 7.12. The ratings are shown with the mean, maximum and minimum
values. For each conﬁguration, ratings are shown for the three levels of pilot aggression.
The maximum spread of the HQRs for each conﬁguration/aggression level is about 2.
If the spread had been much greater than this, then there would have been cause for
concern, but a spread of 2 is regarded as acceptable. Several observations can be made
about these subjective results, drawn from the pilot comments gathered in the tests, as
follows:
(1) First, we address the primary objective of the trial – to establish the Level 1/2
boundary for rate response types on the AFS. The result depends on which level of
aggression is taken, and we will return to this particular issue later. On the basis that
pilots can be expected to ﬂy with moderate levels of aggression on a regular basis to
accomplish tasks with some urgency, we would argue that Level 1 qualities are
achievable with conﬁguration T306 (≈2.5 rad/s) and higher bandwidths. This is a
little higher than the ADS-33 value at 2 rad/s but actually agrees with the NRC mean

rating line shown in Fig. 7.7. This result was a clear indication that the AFS was able
to predict Level 1 handling qualities with good accuracy.
(2) At the high aggression level, Level 1 ratings were not achievable, and ratings strayed
into the Level 3 region for the lower bandwidth conﬁgurations T103 and T306. Pilots
complained of insufﬁcient control and a sluggish response in negotiating the tighter
turns for the lower bandwidth conﬁgurations. Conﬁguration T509 was solid Level 2,
and it could be speculated that even higher bandwidths would confer better ﬂying
qualities still.
(3) The spread of ratings for each conﬁguration gives an indication of the powerful effect
of task demands on pilot workload. Pilots rated the same aircraft, conﬁguration T103,
between a 2 and a 7 as the urgency level increased from low to high. This emphasizes
the importance of deﬁning the level of pilot aggression required; it is one of the
parameters that workload is most sensitive to, even more so than bandwidth over the
range considered. At the higher urgency level, several new handling qualities issues
come to light, including ﬂight envelope limit monitoring, task cue deﬁciencies at
high-bank angles and the need for improved pilot judgement of ﬂight path trajectory.
We will address these in more detail in later sections of this chapter.
(4) One of the classic problems experienced by pilots ﬂying low-bandwidth aircraft in
moderately demanding manoeuvres is the need to command a high roll rate to
compensate for the long rise time, combined with the need to arrest the rate quickly to
stabilize on a new attitude. This can lead to overcontrolling and difﬁculties with ﬂight
path control. Figure 7.13 shows the attitude quickness values (see Chapter 6) for
conﬁgurations T306 and T509 ﬂown up to moderate levels of aggression – both
achieved borderline Level 1/2 ratings. Pilots ﬂew the lower bandwidth conﬁguration,

 
474

T306, with signiﬁcantly higher levels of quickness than T509, compensating for the
lower bandwidth by using more of the control power. There is a usable limit to this
trade-off between bandwidth and control power; the reader might note that the
achieved roll quickness for T306 rises to the ADS-33 Level 1/2 track boundary.
(5) The single HQR 7 for conﬁguration T306 + 80 at the moderate aggression level is
also shown in Fig. 7.12. According to Fig. 7.11, the addition of 80-ms time delay to
T306 should lead to Level 2 ﬂying qualities for general MTEs and Level 3 ﬂying
qualities for tracking MTEs; in the event, a Level 3 rating was returned, indicating the
signiﬁcant tracking content of the lateral jinking task at moderate to high levels of
aggression. For this case the pilot actually experienced a roll pilot-induced oscillation
(PIO) while trying to tighten up the ﬂight path to negotiate the gates. Figure 7.14
illustrates the plan view of the task showing the aircraft ground track for the same
pilot ﬂying T306 (upper ﬁgure) and T306 + 80 (lower ﬁgure). The (roll) PIO on the
approach to, and ﬂying through, the third gate is quite pronounced, and this
experience highlights the real dangers of operating with low-bandwidth aircraft with
large values of phase delay, in this kind of task. It carries a particularly strong message
to the designers of ACT helicopters with digital ﬂight control systems where high
values of phase delay can be introduced by digital system transport delays and ﬁlters.
(6) The deterioration from borderline Level 1/2 to Level 3 with the addition of 80-ms time
delay is an important result, suggesting that the pilots are more sensitive to increases in
phase delay than the boundaries in Fig. 7.11 would suggest. We have already presented
results in Chapter 6, which suggest that the phase delay boundaries should be capped
rather than extend linearly out above 150 ms. The AFS slalom data tend to conﬁrm this,
although the pilot was forced to use a more aggressive control strategy for T306 + 80
than for the standard T306, often hitting the control stops during the roll reversals. We

Fig. 7.14 Comparison of ground tracks in slalom MTE (Ref. 7.13)
have made the point on several occasions in this book that handling deﬁciencies can
emerge as cliff edges, developing rapidly as some detail of the task or conﬁguration
is changed. The slalom PIO is a classic example of this and serves as a reminder
of the importance of testing through moderate and up to high levels of aggression.
The pilot ratings for the DRA sidestep are shown in Fig. 7.15, comparing well with
the ADS-33 ﬂight test data; the results show a similar trend to the slalom data, except
that the degradation with level of aggression does not appear nearly as strong for the
higher bandwidth conﬁgurations. This is partly explained by the pilot comments that
the sidestep task is considerably easier and more natural to ﬂy with a more aggressive
control strategy than the slalom, provided the attitude bandwidth and control power
are available.

In Ref. 7.18, results are reported from trials on the DRA’s AFS for a maritime
mission – the recovery of large helicopters to non-aviation ships in various sea states.
The landing MTE was quickly identiﬁed as by far the most critical for handling qualities
for all sea states. Figure 7.16 illustrates the task performance requirements for the
landing, based on the need to touch down on the deck grid within deﬁned velocity
constraints. The pilot is required to bring the helicopter to the hover alongside the ship,
wait for a quiescent period in the ship motion, exercise a lateral sidestep towards, and
land onto, the deck. As often happens in practice, as the aircraft arrives over the deck,
the pilot is unable to execute a successful landing immediately and has to maintain
station over the deck grid, waiting for another quiescent period. The study reported
in Ref. 7.18 examined roll, pitch and heave handling qualities, again using the CSM,
but now conﬁgured as a much larger helicopter. Figure 7.17 shows the pilot HQRs for
the landing MTE as a function of roll attitude bandwidth for various sea states. Figure
7.18 shows the achieved task performance in terms of landing scatter and touchdown
velocities. For comparison, ﬂight test results from a Sea King helicopter are included.
The pilot was able to achieve adequate performance for the points shown and the HQRs
were driven by the extreme levels of workload required at the higher sea states. For this
MTE, sea state is the principal task driver, just as urgency level was for the battleﬁeld
sidestep and slalom MTEs, and the pilot’s ability to achieve desired performance
levels at low workload is a strong function of the deck motion induced by the sea state
(SS). While the data indicate that SS3 can be achieved with relatively low-bandwidth
conﬁgurations (≈1.5 rad/s), SS5 will require considerably higher values, perhaps as
high as the 3.5 rad/s boundary of the ADS-33 air combat/tracking tasks, as indicated
by the suggested performance requirements shaded on Fig. 7.17. This will be more

difﬁcult to achieve with large helicopters, and high gain/high authority active control
may be required to guarantee consistent performance in poor weather conditions.
This section has discussed some of the important issues associated with pilot
subjective opinion of aircraft handling qualities and the practical use of the Cooper–
Harper HQR scale. The reader will be able to ﬁnd many examples of handling qualities
experiment reported in the open literature during the 1980s and 1990s; it has been a rich
and productive period for this subject, spurred on to a large extent by the new handling
qualities speciﬁcations on the one hand and the advent of active control technology on
the other. These broad and concerted efforts to deﬁne and improve handling qualities
have exposed and highlighted many new areas and facets of handling, where previous
work had not been deﬁnitive. We now turn to examine some of these under the heading
– Special ﬂying qualities.
7.3
Special Flying Qualities
7.3.1
Agility
Agility as a military attribute
In Chapter 6 and Section 7.2, the measurement of ﬂying qualities from objective and
subjective standpoints was discussed. Two additional issues arise out of the quality
scale and assessment. First, the boundaries are deﬁned for minimum requirements
that reﬂect and exercise moderate levels of the dynamic OFE only, rather than high
or extreme levels. Second, the assessments are usually made in ‘clean’ or clinical
conditions, uncluttered by secondary tasks, degraded visual cues or the stress of real
combat. Beyond the minimum quality levels there remains the question of the value of
good ﬂying qualities to the overall mission effectiveness. For example, how much more
effective is an aircraft that has, say, double the minimum required (Level 1) roll control

velocity; (b) landing scatter
power? A second question asks whether there are any upper limits to the ﬂying qualities
parameters, making quality boundaries closed contours. The answers to these questions
cannot generally be found in ﬂying qualities requirements like ADS-33. At higher
performance levels, very little data are available on ﬂying qualities and, consequently,

 
480
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
there are very few deﬁned upper limits on handling parameters. Regular and safe, or
carefree, use of high levels of transient performance has come to be synonymous with
agility. The relationship between ﬂying qualities and agility is important because it
potentially quantiﬁes the value of ﬂying qualities to operational effectiveness. We will
return to this question of value in Section 7.5, but ﬁrst we examine agility in a more
general context.
Operational agility is a key attribute for weapon system effectiveness. Within the
broadercontextofthetotalweaponsystem,themissiontasknaturallyextendstoinclude
the actions of the different cooperating, and non-cooperating, subsystems, each having
its own associated time delay (Ref. 7.19). We can imagine, for example, the sequence
of actions for an air-to-air engagement – threat detection, engagement, combat and
disengagement; the pilot initiates the action and stays in command throughout, but
a key to operational agility is the automation of subsystems – the sensors, mission
systems, airframe/engine/control systems and weapon – to maximize the concurrency
in the process. Concurrency is one of the keys to operational agility. Another key relates
to minimizing the time delays of the subsystems to reach full operational capability and
hence effectiveness in the MTE. Extensions to the MTE concept are required which
encompass the functions and operations of the subsystems and so provide an approach
to assessing system operational agility. Working Group 19, set up by AGARD in 1990,
was tasked to address these issues (Ref. 7.19). In this study, addressing both ﬁxed- and
rotary-wing aircraft, ﬂying qualities were a major concern. Minimizing time delays is
crucial for the airframe, but ﬂying qualities can suffer if the accelerations are too high
or time constants too short, leading to jerky motion. The following discussion is based
on the author’s contribution to AGARD WG19.
We need to examine how well existing ﬂying qualities requirements address
agility, but to set the scene we ﬁrst reﬂect on the WG19 generalized deﬁnition of
agility:
the ability to adapt and respond rapidly and precisely with safety and with poise, to
maximise mission effectiveness.
To place this deﬁnition in context it is useful to list the four mission phases where
agility might be important:
(1) stealthy ﬂying, in particular terrain-masked, to avoid detection;
(2) threat avoidance once detected;
(3) the primary mission (e.g., threat engagement);
(4) recovery and launch from conﬁned, or otherwise demanding, areas.
In addition, we can include the need for agility in response to emergency situations for
both military and civil operations, such as those following major system failures. The
key attributes of airframe agility, as contained in the above deﬁnition, are as follows:
(1) Rapid. Emphasizing speed of response, including both transient and steady-state
phases in the manoeuvre change; the pilot is concerned to complete the manoeuvre
change in the shortest possible time; what is possible will be bounded by a number of
different aspects.
(2) Precise. Accuracy is the driver here, with the motivation that the greater the task
precision, e.g., pointing, ﬂight path achievable, the greater the chance of a successful
outcome.

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
481
(Note: the combination of speed and precision emphasizes the special nature of agility;
one would normally conduct a process slowly to achieve precision, but agility requires
both.)
(3) Safety. This reﬂects the need to reduce piloting workload, making ﬂying easy and
freeing the pilot from unnecessary concerns relating to safety of ﬂight, e.g., respecting
ﬂight envelope limits.
(4) Poise. This relates to the ability of the pilot to establish new steady-state conditions
quickly and to be free to attend to the next task; it relates to precision in the last
moments of the manoeuvre change but is also a key driver for ride qualities that
enhance steadiness in the presence of disturbances.
(Poise can be thought of as an efﬁciency factor, or measure of the unused energy
potential.)
(5) Adapt. The special emphasis here relates to the requirements on the pilot and aircraft
systems to be continuously updating awareness of the operational situation; the
possibility of rapid changes in the external factors, discussed earlier in this chapter
(e.g., threats, UCE, wind shear/vortex wakes), or the internals, through failed or
damaged systems, makes it important that agility is considered, not just in relation to
set-piece manoeuvres and classical engagements, but also for initial conditions of low
energy and/or high vulnerability or uncertainty.
Existingﬂying qualities requirementsaddress some of theseagility attributes implicitly,
through the use of the HQRs, which relate the pilot workload to task performance
achieved, and explicitly through criteria on response performance, e.g., control power,
bandwidth, stability. A new parameter, the agility factor, makes a direct link between
inherent vehicle performance and handling.
The agility factor
One of the most common causes of dispersion in pilot HQRs stems from poor or im-
precise deﬁnition of the performance requirements in an MTE, leading to variations
in interpretation and hence perception of achieved task performance and associated
workload. We have already illustrated this with the controlled experiment data from
the AFS slalom and sidestep MTEs. In operational situations, this translates into the
variability and uncertainty of task drivers, commonly expressed in terms of precision,
but the temporal demands are equally important. The effects of task time constraints
on perceived handling have been well documented (Refs 7.20–7.24) and represent
one of the most important external factors that impact pilot workload. Flight results
gathered on Puma and Lynx test aircraft at DRA (Refs 7.20, 7.23, 7.24) showed that
a critical parameter was the ratio of the task performance achieved to the maximum
available from the aircraft; this ratio gives an indirect measure of the spare capacity
or performance margin and was consequently named the agility factor. The notion
developed that if a pilot could use the full performance safely, while achieving desired
task precision requirements, then the aircraft could be described as agile. If not, then
no matter how much performance margin was built into the helicopter, it could not
be described as agile. The DRA agility trials were conducted with Lynx and Puma
operating at light weights to simulate the higher levels of performance margin ex-
pected to be readily available, even at mission gross weights, in future types (e.g.,
up to 20–30% hover thrust margin). A convenient method of computing the agility
factor was developed as the ratio of ideal task time to actual task time. The task was

 
482
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
deemed to commence at the ﬁrst pilot control input and to complete when the aircraft
motion decayed to within prescribed limits (e.g., position within a prescribed cube,
rates <5◦/s) for repositioning tasks, or when the accuracy/time requirements were met
for tracking or pursuit tasks. The ideal task time is calculated by assuming that the
maximum acceleration is achieved instantaneously, in much the same way that some
aircraft models work in combat games. So, for example, in a sidestep repositioning
manoeuvre,theidealtasktimeisderivedwiththeassumptionthatthemaximumtransla-
tional acceleration (hence aircraft roll angle) is achieved instantaneously and sustained
for half the manoeuvre, when it is reversed and sustained until the velocity is again
zero.
The ideal task time is then simply given by
Ti = √(4S/amax)
(7.3)
where S is the sidestep length and amax is the maximum translational acceleration.
With a 15% hover thrust margin, the corresponding maximum bank angle is about 30◦,
with amax equal to 0.58 g. For a 100-ft sidestep, Ti then equals 4.6 s. Factors that
increase the achieved task time, beyond the ideal, include
(1) delays in achieving the maximum acceleration (e.g., due to low roll attitude
bandwidth/control power);
(2) pilot reluctance to use the maximum performance (e.g., no carefree handling
capability, fear of hitting ground);
(3) inability to sustain the maximum acceleration due to drag effects and sideways
velocity limits;
(4) pilot errors of judgement leading to terminal repositioning problems (e.g., caused by
poor task cues, strong cross-coupling).
To establish the kinds of agility factors that could be achieved in ﬂight test, pilots
were required to ﬂy the Lynx and Puma with various levels of aggressiveness or ma-
noeuvre ‘attack’, deﬁned by the maximum attitude angles used and rate of control
application. For the low speed, repositioning sidestep and quickhop MTEs, data were
gathered at roll and pitch angles of 10◦, 20◦and 30◦corresponding to low, mod-
erate and high levels of attack, respectively. Figure 7.19 illustrates the variation of
HQRs with agility factor for the two aircraft (Ref. 7.24). The higher agility factors
achieved with Lynx are principally attributed to the hingeless rotor system and faster
engine/governor response. Even so, maximum values of only 0.6–0.7 were recorded
compared with 0.5–0.6 for the Puma. For both aircraft, the highest agility factors
were achieved at marginal Level 2/3 handling. In these conditions, the pilot is either
working with little or no spare capacity, or not able to achieve the ﬂight path pre-
cision requirements. According to Fig. 7.19, the situation rapidly deteriorates from
Level 1 to Level 3 as the pilot attempts to exploit the full performance, emphasizing
the ‘cliff edge’ nature of the effects of handling deﬁciencies. The Lynx and Puma
are typical of current operational types with low authority stability and control aug-
mentation. While they may be adequate for their current roles, ﬂying qualities deﬁ-
ciencies emerge when simulating the higher performance required in future combat
helicopters.
The different possibilities are illustrated in Fig. 7.20. All three conﬁgurations are
assumed to have the same performance margin and hence ideal task time. Conﬁguration

Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
A can achieve the task performance requirements at high agility factors but only at the
expense of maximum pilot effort (poor Level 2 HQRs); the aircraft cannot be described
as agile. Conﬁguration B cannot achieve the task performance when the pilot increases
his or her attack and Level 3 ratings are returned; in addition, the attempts to improve
task performance by increasing manoeuvre attack have led to a decrease in agility
factor, hence a waste of performance. This situation can arise when an aircraft is PIO
prone, is difﬁcult to re-trim or when control or airframe limits are easily exceeded in
the transient response. Conﬁguration B is certainly not agile and the proverb ‘more
haste, less speed’ sums the situation up. With conﬁguration C, the pilot is able to
exploit the full performance at low workload. The pilot has spare capacity for situation
awareness and being prepared for the unexpected. Conﬁguration C can be described
as truly agile. The inclusion of such attributes as safeness and poise within the concept
of agility emphasizes its nature as a ﬂying quality and suggests a correspondence
with the quality levels. These conceptual ﬁndings are signiﬁcant because the ﬂying
qualities boundaries, which separate different quality levels, now become boundaries
of available agility. Although good ﬂying qualities are sometimes thought to be merely
‘nice to have’, with this interpretation they can actually delineate a vehicle’s achievable
performance. This lends a much greater urgency to deﬁning where those boundaries
should be. Put simply, if high performance is dangerous to use, then most pilots will
avoid using it.
In agility factor experiments the deﬁnition of the level of manoeuvre attack needs
to be related to the key manoeuvre parameter, e.g., aircraft speed, attitude, turn rate or
target motion. By increasing attack in an experiment, we are trying to reduce the time
constant of the task, or increasing the task bandwidth. It is adequate to deﬁne three
levels – low, moderate and high, the lower corresponding to normal manoeuvring, the
upper to emergency manoeuvres.
There are also potential misuses of the agility factor when comparing aircraft.
The primary use of the Af is in measuring the characteristics of a particular aircraft
performing different MTEs with different performance requirements. However, Af
also compares different aircraft ﬂying the same MTE. Clearly, a low-performance
aircraft will take longer to complete a task than one with high performance, all else
being equal. The normalizing ideal time will therefore be greater for the lower than
the higher performer, and if the agility factors are compared, this will bias in favour of
the poor performer. Also, the ratio of time in the steady state to time in the transients
may well be higher for the low performer. To ensure that such potential anomalies are
not encountered, when comparing aircraft using the agility factor it is important to use
the same normalizing factor – deﬁned by the ideal time computed from a performance
requirement.
Relating agility to handling qualities parameters
Conferring operational agility on future rotary-wing aircraft, emulating conﬁguration
C above in Fig. 7.20, requires signiﬁcant improvements in handling, but research
into criteria at high-performance levels are needed to lead the way. A natural agility
parameter has developed as one of the ADS-33 innovations – the response quickness.
We have already discussed the properties of this parameter in Chapter 6 but it is useful
to take a closer look at the effect of this and other handling parameters on the equi-
response charts shown in Fig. 7.21. For a simple illustration we refer back to the CSM

If we interpret the frequency axis as roll response quickness as shown in Fig. 7.21, the
effect of independent variation of the different parameters in eqn 7.4 can be illustrated
as in Fig. 7.22. The sensitivity of agility factor with the parameters of the CSM is
relatively easy to establish. For example, if we consider a bank and stop MTE (Fig.
7.23), some useful insight can be gained. A pulse-type control input will be assumed,
although, in practice, pilots would adopt a more complex strategy to increase the agility
factor. To illustrate the primary effect, we consider the case where the ‘secondary’ time
delays are set to zero (i.e., τ = 0, ωa = ∞). For a roll angle change of 
φ, the ideal

time (assuming the time to achieve maximum rate is zero) is then given by

where

the sensitivity of Af to both bandwidth and quickness. The normalized bandwidth is a
useful parameter as it represents the ratio of aircraft bandwidth to control input band-
width, albeit rather approximately. For short, sharp control inputs, typical in tracking
corrections, high aircraft bandwidths are required to achieve reasonable agility factors.
For example, at the ADS-33C minimum required roll attitude bandwidth of 3.5 rad/s
and with 1-s pulses, the pilot can expect to achieve agility factors of 0.5 using simple
control strategies in the bank and stop manoeuvre. To achieve the same agility factor
with a 0.5-s pulse would require double the bandwidth. This is entirely consistent with
the argument that the ADS-33C boundaries are set for low to moderate levels of at-
tack. If values of agility factor up to 0.75 are to be achieved, it is suggested as in Fig.
7.24, that bandwidths up to 8 rad/s will be required. Whether the 30% reduction in
task time is worth the additional effort and cost to develop the higher bandwidth can
be judged only in an overall operational context. Such high values of roll bandwidth
may be achievable in very high performance ﬁxed-wing aircraft and Fig. 7.24 serves
to illustrate and underline the different operational requirements of the two vehicle
classes, and also, to a large extent, the different expectations of the operators.
This simple example has many questionable assumptions, but the underlying point
that increasing the key ﬂying qualities parameters above the Level 1/2 boundary has a
ﬁrst-order effect on task performance still holds. But it provides no clues to possible
upper performance boundaries set by ﬂying qualities considerations. Existing require-
ments do not address upper limits directly, and more research with high-performance
variable stability helicopters is required to address this issue. Intuitively, we might ex-
pect upper limits to be related to the acceleration capability of the aircraft (Ref. 7.25).
This is largely the case with ﬁxed-wing aircraft but there are also tentative upper limits
on pitch attitude bandwidth (see Figs 6.43, 6.44). However, it is suspected that these
are actually a reﬂection of the high control sensitivity required to achieve a deﬁned
level of control power, rather than the high values of bandwidth per se. Upper limits
on control sensitivity are typically set to reduce the jerkiness or abruptness for small
amplitude precision control, but the numerical values depend very much on the incep-
tor characteristics. Regarding the moderate and large amplitude motions, the best we
can say at the moment is that the parameters on the quickness–amplitude charts are
likely to have upper bounds beyond which agility would deteriorate.
Agility is a special ﬂying quality catering for extreme operational requirements
and a key technology driver for military functions. At the other end of the spectrum we
ﬁnd another, equally demanding, requirement for ﬂight in very poor visibility. Here the
pilot is not so much interested in agility as increased stabilization and the enhancement
of his visual cues for the guidance task. Flight in degraded visual conditions exempliﬁes
the tension and contrast between stability and agility requirements and is pressing
hard on cockpit-related technologies that support pilotage; it is also the next topic of
investigation.

meteorological conditions (VMC or IMC). If aircraft have to operate in IMC then
typically there will be two crew, one ﬂying while the other keeps an eye open for any
hazards appearing in the visual scene. Except for the important case of military ﬁxed-
wing aircraft ﬂying low level to avoid radar and other detection systems, nearly all
ﬁxed-wing IMC ﬂying is conducted at altitude, well away from obstacles, and means
little more than ﬂying on instruments while in cloud or at night. Key instruments that
the pilot would scan include the attitude indicator, heading gyro, airspeed indicator,
ball and slip and rate of climb/descent indicator. A guided approach to a landing site
would, in addition, require the pilot to follow a ﬂight path as directed by special guid-
ance instruments until the aircraft emerges into VMC below cloud to carry out a normal
touchdown. Airports are equipped with various levels of guidance facilities enabling
up to fully automatic landings in poor visibility or IMC. With ﬁxed-wing aircraft, the
characterization of visibility conditions is therefore fairly simple and the associated
operational decision making, e.g., whether to initiate a sortie, can be based on rela-
tively simple criteria, e.g., how much of the airﬁeld can be seen. Rotary-wing aircraft
operations have also been constrained by the same physical conditions but the ability
to operate at low speed, combined with the military need to operate at very low level
to avoid detection, has led to the development of a considerably more detailed and
structured approach to the characterization of outside visual cues (OVCs). The general
term adopted in the rotary-wing technical community for characterizing poor visibility
conditions is the DVE – degraded visual environment, and this section examines some
of the special considerations that accompany helicopter operations and ﬂying qualities
in the DVE.
Pilotage functions
To initiate the discussion it is useful to reﬂect on the piloting task and to review our pre-
vious classiﬁcation into three subtasks – navigation (and general situation awareness),
guidance and stabilization. The discussion will be aided by Fig. 7.25 showing the pilot
performing as the feedback element in the closed-loop task. Navigation is concerned
with knowing where you are and where you are going – the very outer loop in Fig. 7.25,
with typical time/space scales measured in min/km. Most of the time, the pilot will not

be concerned with applying control actions to support the navigation function. Typi-
cally, he will be following maps that lead him from one ‘way-point’ to the next, when
he applies control to direct the aircraft on to the next heading and perhaps speed and
height. Flying at low level and in the nap of the earth (NoE) makes considerably more
demands on piloting, particularly on the inner-loop functions. The guidance function
works within time/space scales of a few seconds and tens of metres and is concerned
with avoiding obstacles and the ground. The closer the pilot has to ﬂy to obstacles, the
more arduous the guidance task becomes and, typically, the slower the groundspeed
selected. A general rule of thumb is that pilots will select a speed that gives them a
perception – action timeframe of between 3 and 5 s. Hence, a 3-s pilot may elect to ﬂy
at 40 knots to give a 60-m straight line see-ahead distance for avoiding obstacles. At
80 knots the same pilot would need to be able to see 120 m ahead. These are minimum
distances and pilots normally ﬂy with much greater safety margins. In the same terrain,
for example, a different pilot may prefer to ﬂy with less urgency, making more spare
capacity available for observation, and chose to ﬂy at 20 knots, giving a 3-s to ﬂy 30 m,
or 6-s see-ahead time in a DVE with a 60-m visibility. Similarly, the vertical ﬂight path
excursions caused by disturbances will increase with increasing forward speed, forcing
the pilot to ﬂy higher to maintain the same level of safety. In the NoE, a general rule
is to trade feet for knots – 10 knots at a height of 10 ft, 60 knots at a height of 60 ft.
The selected overall piloting strategy for guidance will depend on a number of factors
– pilot familiarity with the terrain and experience of NoE ﬂying, the aircraft response
characteristics, the level of task urgency and last, but perhaps most important of all,
the quality of the OVCs. This is the cue to the main subject of this section but before
discussing ﬂying qualities in the DVE in more detail, we need to examine the third,
and perhaps most, distinguishing feature of helicopter pilotage – stabilization.
Automobiledriversaregenerallyunconcernedwithstability,exceptintightcurves
or on slippery surfaces, or perhaps with faulty steering/uneven tyre wear or balance.
However, without some form of artiﬁcial stability augmentation, helicopter pilots need
to make continual corrections with their controls to ensure that the aircraft does not
depart from a prescribed ﬂight path. Different helicopters have their own particular
stability characteristics and problems, but most suffer from natural instabilities in
both longitudinal and lateral motions that are difﬁcult to cure completely with limited
authority artiﬁcial stability augmentation. Control of instabilities is primarily achieved
through attitude as illustrated in Fig. 7.25 and often requires the pilot to be continuously
attentive to ﬂight path control, hence contributing signiﬁcantly to pilot workload.
Flying in DVE
Military helicopter operations require pilots to ﬂy at low level in the NoE at night
and in bad weather, and clearly the DVE has a major impact on all three pilotage
functions – navigation, guidance and stabilization. To a lesser extent, recovery of
civil transport helicopters in poor weather to conﬁned landing sites, such as ships and
building tops, also makes additional demands on ﬂying qualities. Pilots need support
for all three functions described above. Fear of getting lost may well be a primary
concern but navigation is not directly a ﬂying qualities issue. We are more concerned
with guidance and stabilization. As the OVCs degrade, pilots will have two related
concerns. First, they will need to supplement the disappearing outside world position
and velocity cues to enable them to continue low-level ﬂight without risk of bumping
into things, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Second, they will need to ﬁxate

 
490
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
on their attitude instruments, particularly in gusty conditions, to prevent the aircraft
departing from trim or level ﬂight. Without any artiﬁcial guidance and stabilization
aids, these requirements are clearly incompatible (the one requiring the pilot to keep
eyes out, the other to ﬁx gaze on displays) and a pilot will sensibly climb out of the
unsafe ﬂight condition. To enable helicopters to continue operations in low-level DVE,
special guidance and control technologies are being developed, and requirements on
these have been clariﬁed in the new parlance of ADS-33.
It is recognized that the guidance function can really be augmented only through
the provision to the pilot of augmented visual cues projected either onto the visor of
his helmet or onto cockpit panels, either head-up or -down. The ﬁrst generation of
such displays can be found in systems like the AH-64A Apache helicopter with the
integrated helmet and display system (IHADS), which provides a thermal image from a
forward-looking infra-red sensor (FLIR) onto a monocular display, overlaid with ﬂight
path symbology and integrated and slaved with the pilot’s helmet (Ref. 7.26). We will
discuss this as representative of current operational technology later in this section. It
is also recognized that the stabilization task can be augmented properly only through
feedback control functions, augmenting the poor natural damping and aerodynamic
stiffness of the helicopter (which is practically absent at low speed). Two outstanding
questions arise from this simple analysis – how best to ensure a harmonious integration
of the guidance and stabilization augmentations for ﬂight in DVE and what trade-offs
exist in the design of the related display and SCAS technologies.
The usable cue environment
ADS-33 addresses these issues through the requirement for different response types
(effectivelythestabilizationlevel)indifferentusablecueenvironments(UCE)toensure
Level 1 ﬂying qualities. Of course, the quality levels still depend upon what the pilot
is trying to achieve in terms of MTE, and Fig. 7.26 illustrates conceptually the three
dimensions associated with this problem. We have brieﬂy reviewed some of the issues
involved previously in Chapters 2 and 6, but with this discussion of ﬂying qualities in
the DVE we are at the heart of the UCE concept and can give it more attention. One of
the ﬁrst discussions on the need for a more elaborate structure to deﬁne the quality of
visual cues for rotorcraft operations appeared in Ref. 7.27. Hoh introduced the concept
of the OVC scale in the form of Fig. 7.27, to establish the quality of task cues for the

Fig. 7.27 The outside visual cue scale (Ref. 7.27): (a) quantiﬁcation of outside visual cues
(OVC); (b) required outside visual cues for control
control of attitude and velocity or translational rate. In a ﬂight test study to deﬁne the
relative importance of such attributes as texture and ﬁeld of view, Hoh developed the
OVC concept and gathered pilot ratings for visual cues – the so-called VCRs (Ref.
7.28). A conclusion of this study was that the stabilization function can be performed
well with only a narrow ﬁeld of view but ﬁne-grain texture is vital, and also that the
guidance function, and more general situation awareness, requires a wide ﬁeld of view
with macro texture. The OVC scale was further developed into the UCE (Refs 7.28,
7.29) to measure the usefulness and quality of artiﬁcial vision aids. The UCE scale
along with the adjectival meanings of the different subjective VCRs are shown in Fig.
7.28. Pilots must rate the visual cues based on their ability to perform various low-
speed/hover MTEs (with the DVE, rather than day, task performance requirements).
The method for deriving the UCE is described in Refs 7.29 and 7.30. VCRs from at
least three test pilots must be used to derive the UCE. Once derived for a given task,

the individual VCRs are then processed according to the following rules derived from
Ref. 7.30.
(1) Choose the worst attitude VCR and worse translational VCR for each pilot in each
task.
(2) Average all the pilots’ worst attitude VCRs and average all the pilots’ worst
translational VCRs.
(3) Calculate the standard deviation for the VCRs found in step (2).
(4) Check that the standard deviation is less than 0.75.
(5) Plot the two average VCRs on the UCE 2D scale to derive an overall task UCE
(Fig. 7.28).
An important point in the derivation of the UCE is that the baseline aircraft used
should exhibit Level 1 rate response characteristics in day visual conditions, i.e., before

is used in ADS-33 to identify the requirement for enhanced stability augmentation
and/or display augmentation. The requirement is summarized in Table 7.4, illustrating
the response types needed to confer Level 1 ﬂying qualities in different UCEs. Thus,
if an aircraft with its vision aids is required to operate in a UCE 3 then only the full
augmentation provided by translational rate command/position hold (TRCPH) will
confer Level 1. Alternatively, if the vision aids could be enhanced to improve the UCE
from 3 to 2, then attitude command/attitude hold (ACAH) will be sufﬁcient. If a UCE 3
could be upgraded to 1, through the provision of high-quality world scene cues inside
the cockpit, then the lowest level of augmentation provided by rate command (RC) will
besufﬁcient.Wecannowseethetrade-offbetweenvision,orguidance,aidsandcontrol,
or stability, augmentation, and with both technologies advancing rapidly in the 1990s
it is likely that a wide variety of options will be available on future types depending on
the character of the tasks. For example, recovering civil or military helicopters to small
ships in poor visibility will certainly require both improved guidance and stabilization
aids if the operational risks are to be signiﬁcantly reduced.
The basic substantiating data for the requirements of Table 7.4 came originally
from ﬂight test data on the Canadian Bell 205 in-ﬂight simulator (Ref. 7.31). Tests were
conducted with varying levels of stability augmentation while the pilot ﬂew with night
vision goggles, fogged to vary the UCE. Later, a more systematic piloted simulation
investigation was performed on the NASA vertical motion simulator (VMS), designed
speciﬁcally to explore the need for enhanced stability augmentation in DVE (Ref.
7.30). In Fig. 7.29, taken from Ref. 7.30, HQRs are shown plotted against response
type for ﬁve low-speed MTEs ﬂown in the sequence – hover, hover, vertical landing,
pirouette, 2 accel/decels, sidesteps, hover, hover and landing – as shown in Fig. 7.30.
The CGI visual scene was degraded to UCE 3 by fogging the far ﬁeld and reducing
the micro- and macrotexture in the near- to mid-ﬁeld. The HQRs illustrate clearly
how the workload reduces as the augmentation is increased, poor Level 2 ratings
characterizing the RC response type in all MTEs. Level 1 ratings were given for the
TRC in most of the MTEs, with the ACAH system generally lying in the good Level
2 region. The results were obtained without any visual display augmentation. In a
series of similar, more recent, trials using the advanced ﬂight simulator at the DRA,
pilots viewed the UCE 3 world scene through a monochrome, bi-ocular HMD (Ref.
7.32) shown previously in Fig. 2.49. The outside world scene, with an allround ﬁeld of
regard, but only a 48 × 36◦ﬁeld of view, was overlaid with different symbology sets
to aid the pilots’ stabilization and guidance tasks. HQR data for two DVE tasks from
ADS-33, the recovery to hover and sidestep, are superimposed on the results in Fig.
7.29 for comparison. In the AFS trials, the UCE 3 was obtained with a combination of
a sparse outside world scene and superimposed symbology; strictly speaking, the data
cannot be directly compared with the VMS data, where the pilots ﬂew with the outside
world scene alone. Nevertheless, the data correlate very well and conﬁrm the marked
change in performance and workload with level of stability augmentation. One of the
symbology sets evaluated in Ref. 7.32 is illustrated in Fig. 7.31 and is based on the
horizontal situation display featured in the current generation AH-64A helicopter. We
shall discuss this type of format in more detail later in this section. Results from the AFS
trial have highlighted the importance of the height hold facility to ensure Level 1 ratings
with the ACAH and TRC response types. Another result of the AFS trial questioned

the value of attitude bars on displays during very-low-speed MTEs, particularly when
attitude stabilization is provided artiﬁcially, as in the ACAH and TRC response types.
The bars did not provide signiﬁcant improvements with the RC response type. Also,
the dynamic cues provided by the moving bars could be distracting while not fulﬁlling
a useful function. This introduction to the use of symbology to supplement the OVC
brings us to the ﬁnal topic of this section.
UCE augmentation with overlaid symbology
It should be obvious to the reader that NoE ﬂight in the DVE makes considerable
demands on the piloting task. The pilot needs support with both the stabilization and the
guidance functions that he or she performs, and developments in display and control
technologies have been so rapid during the late 1980s and early 1990s that ﬂying
qualities requirements for their effective use have been slow to catch up. Even as
the chapters of this book are laid down the subject is expanding in several directions
embracing and mixing the traditional ﬂying qualities and human factors disciplines. It
is therefore not appropriate to be deﬁnitive at this stage and as one of the contributors
at a TTCP workshop on the subject (Ref. 7.33) remarked, ‘the more we know about the
subject the less we seem to understand’. This old adage seems particularly germane to
the present topic and is enhanced by the apparent notion that every pilot would prefer
to design the display in his own image. Stepping back from the detail we can review
the different kinds of information required by the crew during a DVE mission, and
which are candidates for superposition on an outside world scene:
(1) primary ﬂight path information for guidance and stabilization, including speed,
height, attitude, heading, etc;
(2) guidance information related to special tasks, e.g., recovery to ship, pathway in the
sky for ﬂying NoE, target acquisition and weapon aiming;
(3) ﬂight envelope and carefree handling cueing;

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
497
(4) aircraft system status, e.g., engine torque, AFCS modes;
(5) situational (tactical) awareness data, e.g., navigation – Where am I?, hazards – Where
are the obstacles or the threats?
Any attempt to cram all the above information on to one display will quickly lead to
crew overload. One of the basic messages in display design is to provide information
only as and when it fulﬁls a useful function, hence increasing situational awareness or
task performance. Unfortunately, the achievement of maximum situational awareness
seems at times to be at odds with achieving a speciﬁc task performance. Put another
way, well-designed displays can help to recover the full OFE, previously reduced for
ﬂight in the DVE, but only at the expense of high pilot workload caused by poor
ﬁelds of view, poor resolution and the increased potential for spatial disorientation.
There are times when the crew need to gaze down a narrow ﬁeld-of-view ‘soda straw’
and see ﬁne detail with precision symbology, and others when they need to scan
continuously a 220◦ﬁeld-of-view scene overlaid with guidance symbology cues. Each
makes different demands on the display technology but, ultimately, ﬁeld of view and
symbology content, like many display attributes, need provide only the functionality
required for a given task.
A good example of how symbology can be designed to aid speciﬁc tasks is
provided by the AH-64A format shown previously in Fig. 7.31, in the so-called hover
‘pad capture’ or ‘bob-up’ mode. We supplement Fig. 7.31 with Figs 7.32 and 7.33,
taken from Ref. 7.26, showing how the pilot uses this particular display to position the
aircraft in the very-low-speed regime. The display is intended to aid the pilot maintain
an accurate hover in a DVE. By ‘ﬂying’ the acceleration cue into the hover pad and
‘ﬂying’ both the cue and pad to the ﬁxed aircraft reticle, the pilot is able to achieve
a hover at a prescribed location, deﬁned by the hover pad. Other ﬂight data on the
display include the heading, height and rate of climb and airspeed. The velocity vector
indicates the aircraft’s horizontal inertial velocity. The box in the lower portion of the
display shows the pilot where the FLIR image on the monocular display is positioned
in the ﬁeld of regard of the FLIR sensor. The three plan features that dominate the
pilot’s attention during the pad capture MTE are shown in Fig. 7.33 and consist of the
velocity vector, the acceleration cue and the hover pad. The 8-ft hover pad is driven on
the display relative to the ﬁxed reticle. The velocity vector has a full scale deﬂection
of 12 ft/s, hence the display is intended to support very-low-speed manoeuvring to
recover to the hover over a pilot-selected plan position. This display format provides

insight into how display dynamics can play a critical role in the overall achievement
of task performance. Display dynamics are represented by the Ax/δb (translational
acceleration to stick) transfer function in Fig. 7.32, deﬁning the dynamic relationship
between the acceleration cue (Ax) and the pilot cyclic stick (δb). As pointed out in
Ref. 7.26, a pure gain display law would be the easiest to control but would be likely
to lead to poor hover performance. At the other extreme, driving the acceleration
cue with the trajectory demand would enable an improved task performance but
would certainly require the pilot to work a lot harder. In the production version of the
Apache display laws, a compromise is struck with a blend of the two. Reference 7.26
discusses three alternative drive law designs, designated the modiﬁed-production,
performance and workload designs, that appear to offer signiﬁcant improvements
over the production version, principally by tailoring the response characteristics at
frequencies above 2 rad/s, where the pilot will be working to make small and precise
position corrections. Figure 7.34 shows the time responses of the aircraft horizontal
position and longitudinal cyclic derived from an analytic simulation of Fig. 7.32. The
theoretical predictions of improved performance and reduced workload are apparent.
The results of an extensive piloted simulation exercise are also reported in Ref. 7.26,
where ten pilots evaluated the different designs and concluded that the performance
and workload designs were far superior. Figure 7.35 shows the HQRs for the different
designs, indicating an improvement from poor to good Level 2 ratings for the pad
capture task, with very high statistical signiﬁcance.
The design of the display laws are clearly dependent on the response charac-
teristics of the aircraft, as indicated conceptually in Fig. 7.32. For example, in the
simulation trials conducted at DRA and reported in Ref. 7.32, the Ames display law

design methodology (Ref. 7.26), using the performance variant, was applied to derive
laws that were compatible with the three response types evaluated, RC, ACAH and
TRC. The general principle is to tailor the acceleration cue response to aircraft position
x, attitude θ and cyclic δ, through transfer functions given by the general form
Ax

(s) + fθ(s) θ

by matching to desired response and cancelling unwanted vehicle dynamics from the
cue motion. The principles for achieving different design goals are described in Ref.
7.26. As with control law design for tailoring the aircraft response characteristics,
display law design can be partially completed off-line using linear control techniques,
but the ﬁnal optimization still requires piloted evaluation. This example highlights
some of the important integration aspects between displays that support pilotage and
the response characteristics of the aircraft, hence any automatic guidance and control
augmentation. Several other examples of emerging display formats for supplementing
OVCs are discussed in Ref. 7.33 and indicate the potential of things to come, but are
perhapsonlysteppingstonestowardsthetenuousaviationconceptsofvirtualrealityand
the computerized Pilot’s Associate that performs all the mechanical aviation functions,
including pilotage, leaving the mission manager to direct the operation.
Flight in the DVE and agility represent the extremes of operation and obviously
have a signiﬁcant, although not exclusive, military relevance. Our third topic, carefree
handling, is applicable to both civil and military operations, although once again the
leading edge research has been forged by military requirements.
7.3.3
Carefree ﬂying qualities
A survey conducted with UK operational military pilots from all three services during
the 1980s concluded that some 40% of the piloting workload derived from the need
to monitor aircraft and ﬂight envelope limits (Ref. 7.34). Some 70 pilots completed
questionnaires in the survey and seven different aircraft types were addressed. One of
the questions enquired as to which limits were the most demanding on pilot workload.
From the response it was clear that the top two limits were engine/gearbox torque,
selected by 75% of pilots, and rotorspeed, selected by about 60% of pilots. Some of
the limits considered were actual limits, i.e., the pilot refers to an instrument showing
the critical ﬂight parameter with appropriate green and red zones, e.g., torque, engine
temperature, rotorspeed. Others were derived limits, with parameters displayed on
instruments giving essentially kinematic information about the aircraft state. Examples
in this category are airspeed (reﬂecting rotor and fuselage loads), bank angle in steady
turns and normal acceleration (reﬂecting rotor fatigue loads and static strength). Some
limits are not normally presented to the pilot at all, e.g., sideslip and lateral velocity
(reﬂecting rear fuselage strength) and yaw rate (reﬂecting tail rotor gearbox torque).
The study reported in Ref. 7.34 also solicited pilot opinion of the potential value of
differenttypesofsystemthatmightassistinthemonitoringandrespectingoflimits.The
class of such systems was described as carefree handling systems and included head-
up/down visual cues, audio cues, tactile cues and direct intervention control systems,
with and without pilot override. The majority of pilots believed that the display of ﬂight
envelope limits on a helmet-mounted device would satisfy most of their concerns and
would be effective in reducing the monitoring workload. Equally, the majority of pilots

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
501
considered that direct intervention control systems without pilot override would not be
acceptable – about half of the pilots interviewed rated the potential effectiveness of such
systems as zero. This last point should be placed in the context of ﬁxed-wing aircraft
experience, where most of the carefree handling features are in the direct intervention
class; the only way the pilot has to override them is to turn them off. The results of
this review of current perception and practice spawned a UK research activity into the
functional attributes of helicopter carefree handling systems, which is ongoing at the
time of writing. Selected results from the study are presented below.
Carefreehandlingisaconceptveryfamiliarintheﬁxed-wingworld,withTornado,
F-16, F-18 and Airbus A320 all featuring some form of system that protects the aircraft
from exceeding limits; in general, as noted above, such systems cannot be overidden by
the pilot unless he turns them off. The principal reason for this is that the protected limits
are bounding regions where there is a high risk of loss of control, e.g., deep stall on the
F-16, stall and spin departure on Tornado. In contrast, with helicopters, most of the lim-
its are associated with structural considerations and, generally speaking, overstressing
is preferable to hitting the ground. It is convenient to classify helicopter limits into four
categories, as shown in Fig. 7.36, and related to structural/aerodynamic loads on the
rotor or fuselage, engine speed and temperature, transmission loads and loss of control.
For all but the last category (which has dominated the ﬁxed-wing experience), the limits
can be described as soft or with varying degrees of hardness. For example, a gearbox
transient torque limit can be exceeded as the pilot pulls up to avoid an obstacle; perma-
nent damage may have been done and the gearbox may need replacing, but the aircraft
and crew have survived. It is for this reason that helicopter pilots, almost unanimously,
are unwilling to accept carefree handling without an override capability. Before
discussing the research efforts in this area it is important to give brief attention to

potential loss of control regimes in helicopters. Vortex ring can be as severe for heli-
copter pilots as stall is for ﬁxed-wing pilots, and is a deﬁnite inhibition to manoeuvring
vertically at low speed. Similarly, loss of tail rotor control can lead to a period of un-
controlled yaw motion which can be disastrous in conﬁned areas. Both these examples
require good knowledge of the aircraft’s velocity relative to the air, which is notoriously
inaccurate at low speed. A third example where the helicopter’s ﬂight envelope is lim-
ited by control problems is at low normal ‘g’, which is a particular concern for teetering
rotors; control power can reduce to zero or even reverse at negative ‘g’. Helicopters
have been lost because of excursions into unsafe control regions, and these corners of
the ﬂight envelope should not be neglected in the striving for safe and carefree handling.
In the study reported in Ref. 7.34, four combinations of different carefree handling
features were trialled on the ground-based ﬂight simulator at RAE Bedford. Table 7.5
lists the features evaluated. Conﬁgurations 4 and 5 featured direct intervention carefree
handling. The error between the aircraft ﬂight state and ﬂight envelope limit was
continuously estimated from measurements and triggered high-gain feedback control
as the limit was approached. Warning systems included visual cues on a head-up
display, audio tones and tactile cues fed through the variable force–feel control system.
The vertical axis included a torque command system (TCS), as an alternative to the
direct drive collective.
Six test pilots participated in the trial which included eight MTEs, designed to
exercise the limits in both single and combined ways. The results of this study were
quite illuminating. As predicted by the pilot opinion survey, protection of rotor torque
and rotorspeed was valued the most. Contrary to the results of the pilot opinion reviews,
the presentation of visual warning (ﬂashing) cues on the head-up display (HUD) did
not improve performance in the selected MTEs (conﬁguration 2). Typically, pilots
could be distracted by the visual warnings or even ignore them in high workload
situations, hence limit transgressions were typically as numerous and high as without
any carefree handling features (conﬁguration 1). Of the warning systems, both audio
and tactile were judged to be useful, because they reduced pilot workload although

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics
503
they still demanded pilot corrective action following the approach to, or exceedance of,
the limit. The direct intervention systems scored the highest in terms of performance
improvement and workload reduction, even when tactile cues, in the form of hard stops
on the controls, inhibited the pilots from pulling through. On balance, the conﬁguration
with soft stops and stiffening control forces was preferred because pilots were more
conﬁdent that the excess performance was available, if required.

improvement in task time and reduction in workload as the direct intervention systems
are introduced (Fig. 7.37(a)). The principal ﬂight limit of interest in this MTE was
the lateral velocity, set at 30 knots, shown in Fig. 7.37(b). With only the warning sys-
tems, 30% limit exceedances were typical, while the direct intervention system held
the limits to within 10%. The achievement of marginal Level 1/2 HQRs for the MTEs
ﬂown with high levels of aggression on a ground-based simulator was a signiﬁcant
achievement when these trials were conducted and was attributed to the truly carefree
manner in which the pilots were able to ﬂy the tasks. The TCS was also well received by
pilots and few cases of overtorquing occurred, even in multi-axis manoeuvres like the
slalom and accel–decel. However, pilots did complain that the TCS appeared to reduce
vertical axis performance, compared with the direct drive. The aircraft model used in
the simulation was the RAE’s CSM, discussed earlier in this chapter, that possessed
good Level 1 rate command ﬂying qualities.
Since the completion of the UK conceptual studies into carefree handling, a num-
ber of extensions and applications to different aircraft types have been accomplished.
In Ref. 7.35, the problem of torque control received primary attention, applied to a
simulation of the Bo105 helicopter. The sluggish vertical response characteristic of a
TCS was demonstrated to be an inherent feature of the linear deadbeat torque response.
The key to resolving the conﬂict, and thus conferring both crisp height rate response
and torque command, lay in an innovative control law design technique that effectively
varied the control law gains and structure as the limit was approached. Figure 7.38 il-
lustrates the torque and height rate responses to small and large collective pulse inputs
in the improved TCS design. For the small, 10% pulse, the crisp height response is
accompanied by a 50% torque overshoot, which would, of course, be unacceptable if
the test input had been applied closer to the maximum transient torque limit. For the
larger input, demanding 50% torque, the height rate is constrained as the torque is held
at the limit. For hands-off collective operation, a height hold, trim follow-up function
automatically backdrove the collective to give the desired torque demand. This design
was successfully trialled in a simulation on the DRA’s advanced ﬂight simulator (AFS)
with pilots ﬂying air-to-air (ATA) target tracking and terrain following MTEs. The ATA
MTEs are illustrated in Fig. 7.39, with the pilot’s task being to turn, climb and acceler-
ate to acquire and track the moving target aircraft. Selected results from the simulation
are illustrated in Fig. 7.40, showing a comparison of task time (a), transmission torque
(b) and pilot HQRs (c) for the Bo105 with and without the torque carefree handling
system. The carefree handling system enabled the target to be acquired 20% sooner,
virtually eliminated unintentional limit transgressions and conferred Level 1 ﬂying
qualities on an otherwise Level 2 aircraft. The baseline aircraft simulated in this study
was a Bo105 with full-authority active control system having solid Level 1 handling
according to the ADS-33 criteria.
The results of the UK simulation programme appear quite convincing regarding
the beneﬁts of carefree handling qualities, at least for military operations, where the
requirement to use the full performance potential of the helicopter on a regular basis is
clear. In comparison, for civil operations there is no requirement for pilots to ﬂy close to
envelope limits, except in emergencies. It is therefore likely that the military application
will continue to drive the enabling active control technologies; improved safety in civil
operations will almost certainly be a fallout however. One of the ﬁndings of the results
to date is that, given the safety of operations at the limits, pilots can be expected to
ﬂy there more often and, hence, aircraft incorporating carefree handling may well be

exposed to more damaging fatigue usage. In this context, carefree handling will almost
certainly need to be integrated with a fatigue usage monitoring system. The positive
side to this additional complexity is that pilots, together with the carefree handling
associate, can learn to ﬂy with less damaging control strategies, if required. There will
always be trade-offs involved, this time between performance and structural integrity,
but the pilot should be able to make the decision which way to play the weightings, in
any given situation.
One aircraft where a degree of carefree handling has been incorporated into
the development programme is the Boeing-Bell V22 Osprey tiltrotor. Reference 7.36

effects of structural load exceedances, including
(1) limiting the rotor disc angle of attack during high load factor manoeuvres, using
elevator to reduce the blade stall on the high disc loading rotor (helicopter mode);
(2) reduction of transient rotor ﬂapping and yoke chord bending loads during aggressive
pitch manoeuvres through limiting of high-frequency rotor commands (helicopter
mode);

(3) reduction of trim rotor ﬂapping with elevator control (helicopter mode);
(4) reduction of transient mast and driveshaft torques in roll manoeuvres through roll rate
feedback to differential rotor collective (airplane mode);
(5) prevention of nacelles from lifting off the downstop during aggressive roll
manoeuvres through roll acceleration limiter (airplane mode);
(6) reduction of oscillatory yoke chord bending in pitch manoeuvres through tailoring
pitch response characteristics.
The functionality of these design control law shaping features has been veriﬁed in
simulation as reported in Ref. 7.36, highlighting that the loads in worst cases have
been contained within the design limit loads, with an almost insigniﬁcant effect on
handling qualities when ﬂying the V-22 MTEs.
It could be argued that helicopters should be designed so that the ﬂight limits are
outside the capability of the aircraft, providing it remains within the OFE. Then the
ﬂying qualities engineer would not need to be concerned with artiﬁcial aids, and
the aircraft would possess natural carefree handling. The pilot could never overtorque
the gearbox, droop the rotor, pull too much g or exceed the sideslip or sideways ve-
locity limits. The problem is that achieving this multi-objective design goal is actually
very difﬁcult, if not impossible, and with the classical helicopter design, the large
control ranges to trim throughout the speed range provide sufﬁcient control power at
most ﬂight conditions to inadvertently exceed one or other limit. With the tilt rotor,
achieving a balanced design appears to be even more difﬁcult and this aircraft has
demonstrated that true carefree handling, where the full performance is not inhibited
for safety reasons, will come only through the application of active ﬂight control.
7.4
Pilot’s Controllers
Evaluation of a helicopter’s ﬂying qualities for a particular role will include an assess-
ment of the mechanical characteristics of the pilot’s controls. No matter how good the
response characteristics of the aircraft are, the overall ﬂying qualities will be judged
by the quality of the operation of the pilot’s controls reﬂected in a range of design
features including cyclic self-centring, breakout forces and force gradients, deadbands
and trimming actuators. Breakout forces that are too high, for example, can inhibit the
pilot from making small, precise changes in ﬂight path, and sluggish hydraulic systems
can impede manoeuvrability. Slow trim motors can increase pilot workload and con-
trol force gradients that are too light or too strong can spoil the use of smooth control
action by the pilot. Nowadays there should be little controversy about what consti-
tutes good controller characteristics when discussing central cyclic control sticks with
large displacement; most medium to large helicopters have featured such devices with
ﬁxed-stiffness centring springs and operating through hydraulic actuation systems, for
several decades. The range of acceptable characteristics needs to be fairly broad as
the control forces generally have to be harmonized with the response characteristics.
Figure 7.41 illustrates the general form of the control force/displacement relationship
showing maximum and minimum values for the breakout force levels and gradients.
The accompanying table gives values for Level 1 qualities as deﬁned by ADS-33 (Ref.
7.1) and Def Stan 00970 (Ref. 7.37). Notable differences are in the roll force gradients
and the maximum tolerable breakout forces, which appear to reﬂect traditional prefer-
ences in the different countries’ armed services. Unlike ﬁxed-wing aircraft, helicopters

Fig. 7.41 Control force versus control displacement for centre-sticks (Refs 7.1, 7.37)
do not usually include any artiﬁcial feel augmentation to cue the pilot in manoeuvres.
However, a new requirement in ADS-33 for achieving Level 1 handling is for the stick
force per g to lie between 3 lb (13 N) and 15 lb (67 N) per g (Ref. 7.1).
All current operational helicopters are ﬁtted with a conventional cyclic centre-
stick, collective lever and pedals, with a wide variety of different mechanical charac-
teristics, reﬂecting the varying design preferences and, ultimately, pilot adaptability.
Future helicopters with ﬂy-by-wire control systems are likely to feature integrated side-
stick controllers, and during the period between the late 1970s and late 1980s much of
the basic research was undertaken to explore the potential of such devices (Refs 7.38–
7.41). A key initial concern was whether equivalent handling qualities and performance
could be achieved with sidesticks, considering the high levels of cross-coupling in heli-
copters. Other issues related to the required level of stability and control augmentation
to enable satisfactory performance with sidesticks, the trim mechanisms, grip designs
and force–feel characteristics. The review paper of in-ﬂight simulation activities at the
Canadian Flight Research Laboratory (FRL), Ref. 7.41, offers the most comprehensive
and coherent insight into what is currently known about passive sidesticks for heli-
copters and forms the basic material for this short discussion. Sidestick control is now
generally recognized as being a step in the right direction for helicopters and entirely
commensurate with the development of ﬂy-by-wire control. Signiﬁcant improvements
in cockpit ergonomics, including a dramatic inﬂuence on seating posture, relieving
pilot fatigue and lower spinal damage, coupled with the potential for greater precision
through integrated hand movements, are powerful reasons for their application.
One of the ﬁrst issues to be encountered with helicopter sidesticks was concerned
with the need for command shaping to tailor the control sensitivity. Basically, to provide

 
510
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
Fig. 7.42 Typical nonlinear shaping function for sidestick controllers
the same levels of control power as with conventional controllers, the stick to response
gearing would need to be nonlinear with a steepening gradient (Fig. 7.42). Linear
gearing results in the control sensitivity being too high for small amplitude control
inputs, giving rise to a strong tendency to overcontrol. A major question regarding
the use of sidesticks has been how many control functions should be included in a
single inceptor – 2, 3 or 4. Another question is related to whether there is a strong
preference for displacement or force sensing. These two issues are not unrelated.
Reference 7.41 reports pilot preference for a separate collective with a displacement
sidestick, compared with no preference between 4 + 0 and 3 + 1 (collective) with a
force sensing stick. The Canadian studies have demonstrated that four-axis control is
entirelyfeasibleforlow–moderategaintasks.Forhigherlevelsofaggressionandhigher
bandwidth helicopters than the FRL Bell 205, little ﬂight data have been published in
the open literature, but it is suspected that 3 + 1 (collective) will be the extent of the
integration. The Canadian research conﬁdently proclaims that, to quote from Ref. 7.41:
The studies. . .consistently suggest that there is no evidence that the use of integrated
side-mounted controllers in a helicopter. . .is detrimental to the overall handling
qualities of the vehicle, nor that they demand of the pilot any unusual or exceptional
skills in their use. Neither handling qualities nor pilot performance should control
decisions as to the use of integrated sidesticks in helicopters.
For any speciﬁc application, however, there is an insufﬁcient database to draw
ﬁrm guidelines on the many design issues involved – the optimum force characteristics,
grip shape and orientation, etc. ADS-33 reserves the section on sidesticks for future
requirements. Two future projects are already committed to sidesticks. In Ref. 7.42,
the design for the RAH-66 sidestick is referred to in passing as a three-axis (roll, pitch
and yaw) sidestick with limited vertical axis capability, used in conjunction with the
altitude hold function. In Ref. 7.43, the design of the NH-90 is shown to include a
more conservative two-axis sidestick. Both will be passive, in the sense that the force
characteristics will be ﬁxed. New research into active sidesticks is underway at the
time of writing. These should enable tactile cueing and more general, variable force–
feel characteristics, tailored to the changing response types in an actively controlled
helicopter.

The Contribution of Flying Qualities to Operational
Effectiveness and the Safety of Flight
The two overriding considerations for both civil and military rotorcraft operations are
to achieve good performance at low workload. Like stability and agility, these dual
aims can often conﬂict. Typically, military operations are characterized by achieving
performance goals as a priority, while civil operations are biased towards safety. In
any mission or operational situation, the pilot will make the tactical decision of which
to favour but the tension between performance and safety is ever present. In consider-
ing the contribution of ﬂying qualities to effectiveness and safety, this tension forms
a centrepoint of the discussion. The HQR scale measures pilot workload required to
achieve a deﬁned performance, hence giving an indication of the safety margins avail-
able. HQRs are explicit measures of pilot workload and implicit measures of aircraft
stability and control characteristics. However, there appears to have been very little
work done on the operational beneﬁts using the HQR approach. For example, how
much more mission effective is a Level 1 than a Level 2 aircraft when, for example,
the pilot is stressed due to poor weather or the need for rapid action? Generally, and in
objective terms, the value of good ﬂying qualities should be reﬂected in three principal
areas:
(1) productivity – how many missions or sorties can be accomplished;
(2) performance – how well can each sortie be accomplished;
(3) attrition – how many losses can be expected.
We will examine these issues within the framework of a probabilistic approach along
the lines ﬁrst put forward in Refs 7.44 and 7.45 and later developed in Ref. 7.25.
The basic notion is that ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies increase the chance of pilot error,
hence can lead to accidents, incidents or MTE failures. This is a controversial concept.
A signiﬁcant proportion of accidents and incidents are attributed to human error, but
there is often a counter-argument put forward that suggests some deﬁciency in the
aircraft’s handling qualities. In this context, Refs 7.44 and 7.45 considered the beneﬁts
to ﬂight safety using the Cooper–Harper pilot rating scale as a metric (Fig. 7.2). These
referencesconsideredthepilotasavitalsystemcomponentwhocanfail(i.e.,bestressed
to failure) in an operational context, just like any mechanical or electrical component.
Pilot failure can be manifested in MTE failure, corresponding to HQRs > 6.5 or,
in the extreme, a loss of control, corresponding to a HQR > 9.5. We have already
discussed on several occasions the variability of ﬂying qualities with both internal
attributes and external factors. In the life of an aircraft, there is a ﬁnite probability that
‘virtual’ ratings across the whole range will be experienced. We refer to these as virtual
ratings because in reality they are not awarded; one can imagine, however, an HQR
meter, sampling workload and pilot-set performance targets. For every distinguishable
MTE that is ﬂown, the HQR meter takes a recording. Examples might be as given in
Table 7.6.
The next assumption we make is that over a long period of time the distribution of
the virtual ratings takes a normal form as shown conceptually in Fig. 7.43. The regions
of desired, adequate and inadequate performance are clearly identiﬁed. The desired and
adequate regions can be considered as reﬂecting varying degrees of MTE success, while
the inadequate level corresponds to MTE failure. Effectively, each mission is composed
of a number of contiguous MTEs, each having its own virtual HQR. If a particular MTE

was assigned a Level 3 rating, then the pilot would have to either try again or give up
on that particular MTE. Loss of control has obvious ramiﬁcations on mission success.
For certain types of operation, loss of control will almost certainly result in a crash.
The probability of obtaining a rating in one of the regions is proportional to the area
under the distribution in that region. Note that, as discussed in Ref. 7.25, we include
ratings greater than 10 and less than 1 in the analysis. The rationale is that there are
especially bad and good aircraft or situations, whose qualities correspond to ratings
like 13 or −2. However, the scale enforces recording them as 10 or 1.
Note too that the scatter produces, even with a good mean rating, a large probabil-
ity of merely adequate performance and even a ﬁnite probability of total loss of control
and, in some cases, a crash. We have said elsewhere in this book that ﬂying qualities
are determined by the synergy between internal attributes and external inﬂuences. It
follows then that sources of scatter originate both internally and externally. Internals in-
clude divided attention, stress and fatigue, pilot skill and experience. Externals include
atmospheric disturbances, changing operational requirements and timelines, threats,
etc. The ﬂying qualities community has done much to minimize scatter by careful

attention to experimental protocol (Ref. 7.6), but here we emphasize that in opera-
tional environments, the effective pilot rating scatter is omnipresent.
With the assumed normal distribution of ratings, the probability of control loss,
Ploc, can be calculated for various mean ratings and dispersions; these are plotted in
Fig. 7.44. Ploc is the probability of obtaining a rating greater or worse than 9.5, which
in turn is simply proportional to the area under the distribution to the right of the 9.5
rating. Thus, the probability of loss of control (i.e., ﬂight failure) due to ﬂying qualities
deﬁciencies can be estimated. For the cases studied in Refs 7.44 and 7.45 and depicted
in Fig. 7.44, operating a Level 1 aircraft can be seen to reduce the probability of a loss
of control by an order of magnitude relative to a Level 2 aircraft. Interestingly, the Ploc
of an aircraft with a mean HQR of 3.5, on the Level 1/2 boundary, is 1 in 109, the value
quoted for ﬂight critical component reliability in civil transports.
If we now consider the same approach applied to the full extent of the rating
scale, the effectiveness in terms of MTE success or failure can be estimated. Figure
7.45 shows the probability of obtaining ratings in the various regions when the stan-
dard deviation of the ratings is unity. This curve has some interesting characteristics.
First, the intersections of the lines fall on the ratings 4.5, 6.5 and 9.5, as expected.
Also it turns out that for a mean rating of 7, the probability of achieving inadequate
performance is, of course, high, and we can also see that the probability of achieving
desired performance is about the same as that for loss of control – about one in a hun-
dred. Improving the mean HQR to 2 lowers the probability of loss to 10−13 (for our
purposes zero) and ensures that performance is mostly at desired levels. Degrading the
mean rating from 2 to 5 will increase the chances of mission failure by three orders of
magnitude.
If we consider the above results applying to a ﬂeet of 100 of the same aircraft
type, some interesting statistics begin to emerge. We assume that each aircraft in the
ﬂeet ﬂies one mission per day, and each mission comprises 20 MTEs. Over a 20-year
period the ﬂeet will ﬂy about 15 × 106 MTEs. If we assume that loss of control equates
to loss of an aircraft, then Fig. 7.45 provides information on the expected losses due
to ﬂying qualities deﬁciencies over the life of the ﬂeet. For an aircraft with a mean

 
514
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Quality
Fig. 7.45 Relationship between mean HQR and probability of mission success, failure and
loss of control (Ref. 7.25)
HQR of 5, the ﬂeet can expect to lose one aircraft per year (i.e., 20% of the ﬂeet over
the ﬂeet life). With a mean HQR of 3, no aircraft will be lost from poor handling
qualities during the life of the ﬂeet. It is likely that most operational aircraft in service
today do not have mean HQRs in the Level 1 region, because of limited stability and
control augmentation, the poor cueing of ﬂight envelope limits and the degraded ﬂying
qualities associated with failures and in emergency situations. It would be inappropriate
to discuss data on particular types in this book, but these preliminary results give some
cause for concern; on the other hand, they also offer a methodology for quantifying
the value of good ﬂying qualities.
We describe these results as preliminary because we assume that there is a rational
continuum between desired performance, adequate performance and control loss. For
example, desired and adequate performance may be represented by discrete touchdown
zones/velocities on the back of a ship, and loss of control might be represented by,
say, landing on the edge of the ship or hanger door. On a smaller ship (or bigger
helicopter, for example), the desired and adequate zones may be the same size, which
puts the deck-edge closer to the adequate boundary, or represent a similar fraction of
the deck size, hence tightening up the whole continuum. This raises some fundamental
questions about the underlying linearity of the scale. Assuming these issues can be
resolved satisfactorily, there is also the question of how to establish the mean rating for
a particular aircraft type. This could, in principle, be estimated from a series of tests
as outlined in Chapters 6 and 7 of this book, but data in the most degraded conditions
in which the aircraft is expected to operate will need to be captured.
Though these questions remain, pilot rating and mission success or failure are
powerfully related through the preliminary data in Fig. 7.45. Put simply, ﬂying qualities
alone can determine whether operational agility and ﬂight safety are ﬂawless or whether
control is lost. Flying qualities are at the heart of the subject of Flight Dynamics

 
Subjective Assessment and Other Topics

and, through a holistic approach, this book has attempted to establish the intimate
connection between the theoretical foundations of modelling and handling criteria and
the operational world of ﬂight safety and performance.
Nowhere is safety more prominent an issue as when handling qualities degrade,
as a result of loss of visual cues, loss of some ﬂight control function or when the aircraft
is exposed to the effect of severe atmospheric disturbances; this is the subject of the
last chapter of this book.

Flying qualities: forms of degradation
The future of the helicopter is immense and later the craft will be a
very familiar sight in the air to everyone. It will also be capable of
rendering a great number of services which no other craft can render,
and can be described as the greatest friend in need in the case of an
emergency.
Igor Sikorsky at the end of his lecture ‘Sikorsky Helicopter Develop-
ment’ presented to the Helicopter Association of Great Britain at Mansion
House, London, on Saturday 8 September 1947
8.1
Introduction and Scope
As Sikorsky foretold with conﬁdence and optimism 60 years ago in Ref. 8.1, the
helicopter would indeed serve mankind as a ‘friend in need’, but as often happens,
its unique capability would be usable only by pilots exercising very high levels of
ﬂying skills, and, in dangerous and emergency situations, by pushing both safety and
performance to the limits. Sikorsky talked in his lecture about the signiﬁcance of the
helicopter in rescue service. He recounted a recent occurrence with ‘satisfaction and
great encouragement’, to quote:
The police rang up the factory to say that an oil carrying barge with two men on board
was in distress and was starting to disintegrate, water sweeping over the surface of
the barge. We immediately dispatched a helicopter with a hoisting sling and in spite
of a wind of 60 m.p.h and gusty, the helicopter quickly reached the barge and was
able to hover 20–25 ft. over it, lower the hoisting sling and take the men off, one
after another. The rescue was made as the end of the day was approaching and the
general consensus of opinion was that these two would certainly not have been able
to stay on the damaged barge overnight.
Igor Sikorsky presented the lecture published as Ref. 8.1 just a few years after the birth
of the practical helicopter. He talked about ‘. . . absolute accuracy of the control’ and
‘. . . control as perfect as any other system of control.’ Today, we can only try to imagine
the motivation, the courage and the optimism of the early pioneers as they shaped the
ﬁrst vertical ﬂight machines with four axes of control. A few months later, on 19 April
1948, as reported in Ref. 8.2 and discussed in the Introductory Tour to this book
(Chapter 2), a Sikorsky S-51 during a test ﬂight at the Royal Aircraft Establishment
would almost crash as the pilot momentarily lost control during a high-speed (4 g) pull-
out and inadvertent rapid roll to 90◦of bank. The other side of the coin, so to speak,
was experienced with the consequences of degraded handling qualities. Helicopter
control, while qualitatively precise, would always require close pilot attentiveness and
relatively high workload.

 
518
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Chapter 7 ended with a discussion on the impact of ﬂying qualities on safety and
mission effectiveness. The twin goals of safety and performance, with the consequent
tension between them, have pervaded the whole business of aviation since the Wright
brothers’ ﬁrst ﬂight in December 1903. In the helicopter world, the performance–safety
tension is perhaps strongest when ﬂying close to the surface with what is sometimes
described as mission imperative, or at the edges of the operational envelope, in harsh
environments, or when the pilot has to deal with ﬂight system failures. When ﬂying
close to the surface, the ﬁrst priority for the pilot is to maintain a sufﬁcient margin of
‘spatial awareness’ to guarantee safe ﬂight. This spatial awareness also has a temporal
dimension; the pilot is actually trying to predict and control the future ﬂight trajectory.
We can imagine a pilot ﬂying to maintain a safe time margin, avoiding obstacles and
the ground, with a relaxed control strategy allowing plenty of time for navigation and
monitoring aircraft systems. The pilot will want to maintain a sufﬁciently long ‘time
to encounter’ between the aircraft and any potential hazard, so that there is ample time
to manoeuvre around, climb over or even stop, if required. But external pressures can
make things more difﬁcult for the pilot, increasing the workload. Imagine that the task
is to transit, within tight time constraints, to deliver an underslung load to a conﬁned
forest clearing at night, with the threat of enemy action. Under relentless time pressures,
the pilot has some scope for trading off performance and workload, depending on the
requirements of the moment. He or she will be forced to ﬂy low to avoid detection by
the enemy. Increasing the tempo at low level reduces the safety margin; more precision
or more agility requires higher levels of concentration on ﬂight path guidance and
attitude stabilization. The more the pilot concentrates on ﬂight management, the more
the global situation awareness is compromised with increased risk of getting lost or
becoming disconnected with the military situation. Flying qualities affect and are
powerfully affected by these demands and nowadays can be sensibly discussed only in
terms of mission-oriented requirements and criteria, hence the considerable emphasis
on the development of handling qualities engineering and the standards, particularly
Aeronautical Design Standard-33 (Ref. 8.3).
Military standards have wholly embraced the concept of handling qualities levels
and pilot assessment through the Cooper–Harper handling qualities rating scale, dis-
cussed extensively in Chapter 7 of this book. For an aircraft to be ﬁt for service (i.e.,
according to ADS-33 ‘. . . no limitations on ﬂight safety or on the capability to perform
intended missions will result from deﬁciencies in ﬂying qualities’), it has to exhibit
Level 1 handling qualities throughout the normal operational ﬂight envelope (OFE).
Degradation to Level 2 is ‘acceptable’ following the failure of some ﬂight functions, in
emergency situations or when the aircraft strays outside the OFE. Some operators may
also allow Level 2 handling qualities in parts of the OFE, provided exposure is limited,
e.g., deck landings in high sea states. Even though guided and constrained by their
own experience and standard operational procedures, pilots need to make judgements
all the time as to whether a particular manoeuvre is achievable or not. Sometimes they
make the wrong judgement but the usual outcome is that the pilot gets a second chance
at the landing or to position the load or pick up the survivor. Failing a mission task
element (MTE) might push the aircraft into Level 3, but provided the degradation is not
too severe the situation is recoverable. A more sudden or rapid degradation can push
the aircraft towards the Level 4 condition however, where there is a high risk of loss of
control. Chapter 7 closed with a statistical interpretation of the consequences on ﬂight

safety of an aircraft exhibiting different handling qualities (see Fig. 7.45). Acknowl-
edging the assumptions of the analysis adopted, we drew the tentative conclusion that
for an aircraft exhibiting a mean HQR at the Level 1/2 borderline, the probability of
loss of control would be approximately 1 in 109 MTEs across the ﬂeet. In comparison,
an aircraft that exhibited a mean HQR in the middle of the Level 2 range would have
a probability of loss of control across the ﬂeet of about 1 in 105 MTEs, a massive
increase in risk to safety.
These conclusions are borne out by the accident data. For example, in Ref. 8.4,
Key pointed out that 54% of all accidents on the H-60 Blackhawk in the 10-year period
up to 1996 involved deﬁciencies in handling qualities or situation awareness. The data
also revealed that marginal handling was much more of a problem for low-time pilots.
In a complementary study on US civil helicopter accidents, Ref. 8.5 reports that of the
547 accidents that occurred between 1993 and 2004, 23% could be ‘. . . attributed to
loss of control by the pilot – caused or aggravated by inadequate or deﬁcient handling
qualities’. The relationship between handling and safety is an important link to make,
even more so because in the drive to ‘weather-proof’ ﬂight operations future rotorcraft
will be required to perform roles in more degraded conditions than is currently possible
with safety, hence an understanding of the ways degradation can occur, and some of
the consequences, can assist in forming the requirements for day–night, all-weather
augmentation systems. This chapter addresses these issues and material is drawn from
the author’s own research over the 10 years since the publication of the ﬁrst edition of
this book, e.g., Refs 8.6–8.9. During the second half of this period, the author relocated
to The University of Liverpool, creating and building a research group focused on
all aspects of Flight Science and Technology, and with a strong emphasis on ﬂight
safety. Central to the research at Liverpool is the Bibby Flight Simulator and, within
this chapter, research results using this facility are presented liberally; the simulation
facility is described in some detail in Appendix 8A.
To create a framework for the chapter, handling qualities degradation is described
in four categories:
(a)
degradation resulting from ﬂight in degraded visual conditions;
(b)
degradation resulting from ﬂight system failures, both transient and steady state;
(c)
degradation resulting from ﬂight in severe atmospheric disturbances;
(d)
degradation resulting from loss of control effectiveness.
Strictly speaking, category (d) should not occur, almost by deﬁnition, within the OFE
and usually results from pilots inadvertently straying outside this, as a result of degra-
dations in categories (a)–(c). Discussion on category (d) situations, for example, loss
of heave control following entry into vortex ring, loss of tail rotor effectiveness in
quartering ﬂight or loss of pitch/roll control power in high-speed stall, will not be
included.

Flight in Degraded Visual Environments
Imagine a bird ﬂying through a cluttered environment; a sparrow hawk is a good
example. It is so successful at avoiding bumping into things and eventually catching
prey on the wing that we can assume that the bird has very accurate knowledge of

 
520
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
where it is heading, its rates of closure with objects in its path, its orientation and, more
generally, its ﬂight trajectory. How does it pick up the required information from the
‘visual ﬂow’ of the world around it, projected onto its visual sensors? We might ask
the same question of a fell-runner who successfully tracks over rough terrain without
stumbling, or indeed an athlete who somersaults and lands, precisely balanced, on two
feet, or a pigeon landing gently on the ledge rather than overshooting and crashing into
the window. Motion control is ubiquitous in the natural world, and without completely
reliable and precise functioning life would be very vulnerable. When the visual world
is obscured, so too are the stimuli to the perception system and again life becomes
vulnerable; most life sleeps at night, with the visual sensors, the eyes, shut, although
there are some notable exceptions, of course. However, in the world of man-made
ﬂying machines, we regularly practice ﬂight at night and in poor visual conditions,
and technology even allows us to land ﬁxed-wing aircraft on narrow runways, or
bring a helicopter to hover, in zero visibility. Without precise control augmentation
however, such manoeuvres would not be possible and such precision approaches are
only really possible in tightly controlled airspace. Inadvertent ﬂight into a degraded
visual environment (DVE) is extremely hazardous with a high risk of loss of control
through a loss of awareness of spatial orientation. Looking to the future, technology is
under development that will provide pilots with a sufﬁciently reliable ‘synthetic’ world
in which they have conﬁdence to manoeuvre, to exercise motion control, in a cluttered
environment with no natural outside world information. Until then, ﬂight will be risky
in poor visibility. We can gain valuable information on motion control by studying
ﬂight in good visual environments (GVE). By doing this we can also attempt to build
an engineering framework for motion control using visual stimuli, which can inform
the development of vision augmentation systems. This is the theme of this section.
Through his research into motion control in the natural world, this author has observed
that the subject is still in development with different ‘schools of thought’ existing on
the key stimuli and mechanisms involved. I have had to be selective in attempting
to build the bridge between the engineering and psycho-physics approaches to ﬂight
control, and my foundation has, naturally, been the work of James Gibson and the
developments of his theory of optical ﬂow. In the quest for solutions to how to design
for completely autonomous ﬂight in a cluttered, undulating environment however, I
believe strongly that there is much still to be learned and understood, and that much
of the contemporary, seemingly contradictory, research will have helped to inform
progress.
8.2.1
Recapping the usable cue environment
Just like the sparrow hawk, a pilot ﬂying a helicopter close to the surface and near obsta-
cles requires clear visual information for attitude stabilization and ﬂight path guidance,
tasks not too dissimilar to cycling or walking over uneven or rough terrain. Although
critical for short-term stabilization, vestibular motion cues are generally unreliable for
guidance; turn the lights off or shut the eyes, and the cyclist or walker would soon fall
over. Attitude stabilization cues for helicopter ﬂight are derived from knowledge of the
horizon, an awareness of spatial orientation and rotational motion. The requirements
of ADS-33 are quite clear about the importance of stability augmentation when the
usable cue environment (UCE) degrades below 1. Figure 8.1 summarizes the material
presented in Chapter 7 – increased attitude stabilization (attitude command) as the

521

522
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
UCE degrades to 2 and increased velocity stabilization (translational rate command)
as the UCE degrades to 3.
In Ref. 8.10, Hoh applied the UCE/VCR approach to quantifying the risk of
spatial disorientation when ﬂying in the DVE, using the original ADS-33 ﬂight test
database. The work reported addresses the wide class of ground/obstacle collisions
that occur when aircrew are unaware that they have an inaccurate perception of their
position, altitude or their motion. Hoh’s analysis models situations where the overall
pilotworkloadisacombinationoftheattentionaldemands(AD)ofﬂightcontrolandthe
effort required to maintain situation awareness (SA). The greater the requirements for
control attention, the less capacity remains for SA and Hoh hypothesizes a relationship.
To quote from Ref. 8.10
The risk of a spatial disorientation accident is linked to the attentional demand
required for control as follows. High risk is deﬁned when attentional demand exceeds
42% of the total available workload capacity. Extreme risk is deﬁned when the
AD exceeds 66% of the available workload capacity. The attentional demand for
rotorcraft control in the DVE depends on two factors, 1) the basic handling qualities
in the GVE and 2) the Response Type (Rate or ACAH + HH). The relationship between
these factors is summarised in Fig. 8 where the attitude VCR and translational VCR
are assumed to be equal to simplify the presentation of the effects. These results
indicate that as the visual environment is degraded: 1) the use of ACAH+HH is highly
effective in minimising the increase in AD, and 2) helicopters with a rate response
type (conventional) suffer a rapid increase in AD. Any factor that degrades the HQR
in the GVE (e.g. marginal basic handling qualities or turbulence) exacerbates the
second result.
The presentation in Fig. 8.2 is compelling but also conceptual, since it is acknowledged
that the relationships between handling qualities, control workload and UCE proposed
Fig. 8.2 Summary of the effect of the DVE on attentional demand (from Ref. 8.10)

 
Degraded Flying Qualities
523
are approximate and have not been fully quantiﬁed or validated. Nevertheless, they
represent an intuitive and compelling argument for the importance of providing the pilot
with augmented attitude control in the DVE. Moreover, Hoh concludes that providing
additional instruments or displayed information to ‘cue’ the pilot can actually increase,
rather than decrease, the AD, further increasing the risk of disorientation.
With this line of thinking, research into improving the UCE becomes focused on
improving spatial awareness for the pilot. This research needs to establish relationships
between the pilot’s VCRs, features in the visual scene and the pilot’s control strategy.
The two components of a pilot’s VCR can be thought of the adequacy of cues for
ﬂight guidance (translational rate) on the one hand, and the adequacy of cues for ﬂight
stabilization (attitude) on the other, i.e., the two dimensions of spatial awareness. While
the previous discussions in this book on ﬂying qualities have centred on the vehicle
and the associated response characteristics, when addressing spatial awareness, we
have to face the most adaptable and least well-understood element of the system and,
indeed, the whole ﬂying qualities discipline – the pilot and his or her perception
system. To understand more about what makes up the UCE/VCR, we need to develop
an engineer’s appreciation of how the pilot organizes visual information and the human
factors of ﬂight control. Improved understanding here can lead to the development of
more efﬁcient pilot aids that function harmoniously with the natural systems, and are
hence more effective at helping pilots maintain spatial awareness. Unlike the aircraft
motion however, pilot action is not simply governed by Newton’s laws and the rules of
continuum mechanics; the perception–action system is far from completely understood
and behaviour is often confused by misjudgements and malfunctions that are difﬁcult
to describe, let alone model. The following sections should be read in the light of this
uncertainty.
8.2.2
Visual perception in ﬂight control – optical ﬂow and motion parallax
One of the earliest published works on visual perception in ﬂight control presented a
mathematical analysis of ‘motion perspective’ as used by pilots when landing aircraft
(Ref. 8.11). The ﬁrst author of this work, James Gibson, introduced the concept of the
optical ﬂow and the centre of expansion when considering locomotion relative to, and
particularly approaching, a surface. Gibson suggested that the ‘psychology of aircraft
landing does not consist of the classical problems of space perception and the cues
to depth’. In making this suggestion, Gibson was challenging conventional wisdom
that piloting ability was determined by the sufﬁciency of linear/aerial perspective and
parallax cues. Gibson had earlier introduced the concept of motion perspective in Ref.
8.12, but in applying it to ﬂight control he laid the foundation for a new understanding
of, what we might generally call, spatial awareness. To quote from Ref. 8.11:
Speaking in terms of visual sensations, there might be said to exist two distinct
characteristics of ﬂow in the visual ﬁeld, one being the gradients of ‘amount’ of ﬂow
and the other being the radial patterns of ‘directions’ of ﬂow. The former may be
considered a cue for the perception of distance and the latter a cue for the perception
of direction of locomotion relative to the surface.
Gibson focused mainly on ﬁxed-wing landings but he also presented an example of the
optical ﬂow-ﬁeld generated by motion perspective for the case of a helicopter landing
vertically, as shown in Fig. 8.3. ‘For the case of a helicopter landing, the apparent

 
524
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 8.3 Projected differential velocities (optical ﬂow-ﬁeld) on the ground in a helicopter
vertical landing
velocity of points in the plane below ﬁrst increases to a maximum and then decreases
again.’ The optical ﬂow-ﬁeld concept clearly has relevance to a helicopter landing at
a heliport, on a moving deck or in a clearing, and raises questions as to how pilots
reconstruct a sufﬁciently coherent motion picture from within the conﬁnes of a closed-
in cockpit to allow efﬁcient use of such cues.
Gibson’s ecological approach (Ref. 8.13) is a ‘direct’ theory of visual perception,
in contrast with the ‘indirect’ theories which deal more with the reconstruction and
organization of components in the visual scene by the visual system and associated
mental processes (Ref. 8.14). The direct theory can be related to the engineering theory
of handling qualities. The ﬂight variables of interest when ﬂying close to obstacles and
the surface are encapsulated in the deﬁnition of performance requirements in the ADS-
33 ﬂight manoeuvres – speed, heading, height above surface, ﬂight path accuracies,
etc. In visual perception parlance these have been described as ego-motion attributes
(Ref. 8.14) and key questions concern the relationship between these and the optical
variables, like Gibson’s motion perspective. If the relationships are not one-to-one then
there is a risk of uncertainty when controlling the ego motion. Also, are the relationships
consistent and hence predictable? The framework for the discussion is a set of three
optical variables considered critical to recovering a safe UCE for helicopter nap-of-the-
earth (NoE) ﬂight – optical ﬂow, differential motion parallax and the temporal variable
tau, the time to contact or close a gap.
Figure 8.4, from Ref. 8.15 (contained within Ref. 8.16), illustrates the optical
ﬂow-ﬁeld when ﬂying over a surface at 3 eye-heights per second (corresponds to fast
NoE ﬂight – about 50 knots at 30-ft height – or the ﬂow-ﬁeld observed by a running
person). The eye-height scale has been used in human sciences because of its value
to deriving body-scaled information about the environment during motion. Each ﬂow
vector represents the angular change of a point on the ground during a 0.25-s snapshot.
Inter-point distance is 1 eye-height. The scene is shown for a limited ﬁeld-of-view

window, typical of current helmet-mounted display formats. A 360◦perspective would
show ﬂow vectors curving around the sides and to the rear of the aircraft (see Gibson,
Ref. 8.12). The centre of optical expansion is on the horizon, although the ﬂow vectors
are shown to ‘disappear’ well before that, to indicate the consequent ‘disappearance’ of
motion information to an observer with normal eyesight. If the pilot were to descend,
the centre of optical expansion would move closer to the aircraft, in theory giving the
pilot a cue that his or her ﬂight trajectory has changed.
The length of the ﬂow vectors gives an indication of the motion cues available to
a pilot; they appear to decrease rapidly with distance. In the ﬁgure, the ‘ﬂow’ is shown
to disappear after 16 eye-heights.
The velocity in eye-heights per second is given by

In terms of the optical ﬂow, or rate of change of elevation angle θ (Fig. 8.5), we can

(8.2)
where xe is the pilot’s viewpoint distance ahead of the aircraft scaled in eye-heights.

 
526

Fig. 8.5 Viewing eccentricity and elevation angles
When the eye-height velocity, ˙xe, is constant, then the optical ﬂow is also constant;
they are in effect measures of the same quantity. However, the simple linear relationship
between ˙xe and ground speed given by eqn 8.2 is disrupted by changes in altitude. If
the pilot descends while keeping forward speed constant, ˙xe increases; if he climbs, ˙xe
decreases. A similar effect is brought about by changes in surface layout, e.g., if the
ground ahead of the aircraft rises or falls away. Generalizing eqn 8.2 to the case where
the aircraft has a climb or descent rate ( dz

A related optical variable comes in the form of a discrete version of that given
by eqn 8.2 and occurs when optically speciﬁed edges within the surface texture pass
some reference in the pilot’s ﬁeld of vision, e.g., the cockpit frame usually serves as
such a reference. This optical edge rate is deﬁned as

where Tx is the spacing between the surface edges. A pilot ﬂying at 50 ft/s over a
network of 50-ft square grids would therefore experience an edge rate of 1/s. Unlike

optical ﬂow rate, edge rate is invariant as altitude changes. However, when ground speed
is constant, edge rate increases as the edges in the ground texture become denser, and
decreases as they becomes sparser.
From eqn 8.2, it can be seen that ﬂow rate falls off as the square of the distance
from the observer. Figure 8.6, from Ref. 8.15, shows how the velocity, in minutes-of-
arc/second, varies with distance for an eye-point moving at 3 eye-heights/s.
Perrone suggests that a realistic value for the threshold of velocity perception
in complex situations would be about 40 min arc/s. In Fig. 8.6, this corresponds to
information being subthreshold at about 15–16 eye-heights distant from the observer.
To quote from Ref. 8.15, ‘This is the length of the “headlight beam” deﬁned by motion
information alone. At a speed of 3 eye-heights/sec, this only gives about 5 seconds
to respond to features on the ground that are revealed by the motion process’. The
value of optical streaming for the detection and control of speed and altitude has been
discussed in a series of papers by Johnson and co-workers (Refs 8.16–8.20). Flow
rate and texture/edge rate are identiﬁed as primary cues. These velocity cues can be
picked up from both foveal (information detected by the central retinal fovea) and
ambient (information detected by the peripheral retina) vision. An issue with ambient
information, however, is the signiﬁcant degradation in visual acuity as a function of
eccentricity. The fovea of the human eye, where there is a massive concentration of
visual sensors, has a ﬁeld of regard of less than 1◦(approximately a thumb’s width
at arm’s length). The visual acuity at 20◦eccentricity is about 15% as good as the
fovea for resolution, although Cutting points out that this increases to 30% for motion
detection (Ref. 8.21). Cutting also observes that the product of motion sensitivity and
motion ﬂow (magnitude of ﬂow vectors) when moving over a surface is such that
‘the thresholds for detecting motion resulting from linear movement over a plane are
roughly the same across a horizontal meridian of the retina’.
In Fig. 8.4, the centre of optical expansion or outﬂow is on the horizon. If the
pilot is looking directly at this point then the information seen will be ‘ﬁltered’ by the

 
528
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
ψ
Fig. 8.7 Visual resolution as a function of eccentricity (from Ref. 8.21)
variable sensitivity across the retina. The motion acuity gradient or visual resolution
takes the form illustrated in Fig. 8.7 (Ref. 8.21), based on the eccentricity and elevation
angles deﬁned in Fig. 8.5.
In Fig. 8.7, data are shown for static resolution and motion resolution referenced
to the fovea performance of 100. The results show that the strength of visual inputs
20◦off-centre reduce to about 40% of those picked up by the fovea when in motion
compared with 15% statically. However, the magnitude of the motion ﬂow vectors
depicted in Fig. 8.4 increases away from the line of sight in a normalized manner
shown in Fig. 8.8 (also from Ref. 8.21). The sensitivity of the retina to motion is
therefore the resultant product of the two effects and is actually fairly uniform across
a horizontal meridian. Figure 8.9 shows the case for viewing at 8◦below the horizon,
corresponding to about 7 eye-heights ahead of the aircraft.
A more irregular surface will give rise to deformations in the sensitivity but the
same underlying effect will be present, leading to the conjecture that the pilot’s gaze will
naturally be drawn to the direction of ﬂight, i.e., that direction which, on average, gives
uniform stimulation across the retina. This is good news for pilots, and a determining
factor on piloting skill is how well this capability is ‘programmed’ into an individual’s
perceptual system.
The subject of way-ﬁnding, or establishing the direction of ﬂight, has also been
addressed in some detail in Ref. 8.21, where the notion of directed perception was
introduced. Cutting developed the optical ﬂow-ﬁeld concept, arguing that people and
animals make more use of the retinal ﬂow-ﬁeld, ﬁxating with the fovea on speciﬁc

parts of the environment and deriving information from the way in which surrounding
features move relative to that point on the retina. In this way the concept of differential
motion parallax (DMP) was hypothesized as the principal optical variable used for way-
ﬁnding in a cluttered environment. Figure 8.10 illustrates how motion and direction of
motion can be derived from DMP. The helicopter is being ﬂown through a cluttered
environment. The pilot ﬁxates his or her gaze on one of the obstacles (to the left of
motion heading) and observes the motion parallax effects on objects closer and farther
away. Objects farther away move to the right and those closer move to the left of the
gaze (as seen on the retinal array). The pilot can judge which objects are closer and
further away by the relative velocities. Figure 8.10 indicates that closer objects move
more quickly across the line of gaze. There is no requirement to know the actual size
or distance of any of the objects in the clutter. The pilot can judge from this motion
perception that the direction of motion is to the right of the ﬁxated point. He or she
can now ﬁxate on a different object. If objects further away (slower movements) move

 
Degraded Flying Qualities
531
to the left and those closer (faster movements) move to the right, then the pilot will
perceive that motion is to the left of the ﬁxated object. By applying a series of such
ﬁxations the pilot will be able to keep updating his or her information about direction
of motion, and home in on the true direction with potentially great accuracy (the
point where there is no ﬂow across the line of gaze). Cutting observed that in high-
performance situations, for example, deck landings of ﬁxed- and rotary-wing aircraft,
required heading accuracies might need to be 0.5◦or better. DMP does not always
work however, e.g., in the direction of motion itself or in the far ﬁeld, where there is
no DMP, or in the near ﬁeld, where DMP will fail if there are no objects nearer than
half the distance to the point of gaze (Ref. 8.21).
In Ref. 8.15, Perrone also discusses the question of how pilots might infer surface
layout, or the slants of surfaces, ahead of the aircraft. This is particularly relevant
to ﬂight in a DVE where controlled ﬂight into terrain is a major hazard and still all
too common. The correct perception of slope is critical for achieving ‘desired’ height
safety margins for ﬂight over undulating terrain, and hence for providing good visual
cue ratings for vertical translational rate, for example. Figure 8.11 illustrates the ﬂow-
ﬁeld when approaching a 60◦slope hill about 8 eye-heights away. The centre of optical
3 eye-heights/s

532
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
expansion has now moved up the slope and the motion cues over a signiﬁcant area
around this are very sparse. If the pilot wants to maintain gaze at a point where the
motion threshold cuts in (e.g., 5 s ahead) he or she will have to lift his or her gaze, and
pilots will tend to do this as they approach a hill. This aspect is discussed again later
in this chapter when results are presented from simulation research into terrain ﬂight,
where the question – how long do pilots look forward? – is addressed.
Any vision augmentation system that tries to infer slope based on ﬂow vectors
around the centre of expansion is likely be fairly ineffective. In Ref. 8.22, a novel vision
augmentation system was proposed for aiding ﬂight over featureless terrain at night.
An obstacle detector system was evaluated in simulation, consisting of a set of cueing
lights, each with a different look-ahead time, presenting a cluster of spots to the pilot
of the light beams on the terrain ahead of the aircraft. As altitude or the terrain layout
ahead changed, so the cluster changed shape, providing the pilot with an ‘intuitive
spatial motion cue’ to climb or descend.
In a cluttered environment, the optical variables – ﬂow/edge rate and DMP –
appear to provide primary cues to pilots for judging the direction in which they are
heading. The question as to how they judge their speed and distance takes us onto the
third optical ﬂow variable in this discussion, the results of which suggest that pilots
do not actually need to know speed and distance for safe ﬂight control; rather the
prospective control is temporally based within an ordered spatial environment.

Time to contact; optical tau, τ
When xe >> 1 (or x >> z), we can simplify eqns 8.1 and 8.3 to the form
˙θ = ˙xe

θ = ˙x
x θ
(8.5)
The ratio of distance to velocity is the instantaneous time to reach the viewpoint,
which we designate as τ(t),
τ(t) = x
˙x
(8.6)
This temporal optical variable is considered to be important in ﬂight control. A
clear requirement for pilots to maintain safe ﬂight is that they are able to predict the
future trajectory of their aircraft far enough ahead so that they can stop, turn or climb to
avoid a hazard or follow a required track. This requirement can be interpreted in terms of
the pilot’s ability to detect motion ahead of the aircraft. In his explorations of temporal
optical variables in nature (Refs 8.23–8.28), David Lee makes the fundamental point
that an animal’s ability to determine the time to pass or contact an obstacle or piece of
ground does not depend on explicit knowledge of the size of the obstacle, its distance
away or relative velocity. The ratio of the size to rate of growth of the image of an
obstacle on the pilot’s retina is equal to the ratio of distance to rate of closure, as
conceptualized in Fig. 8.12, and given in angular form by eqn 8.7.
τ(t) = x
˙x = θ

Lee hypothesized that this ‘looming’ is a fundamental optical variable that has evolved
in nature, featuring properties of simplicity and robustness. The brain does not have to

apply computations on the more primitive variables of distance or speed, thus avoiding
the associated lags and noise contamination. The time-to-contact information can read-
ily be body scaled in terms of eye-heights, using a combination of surface and obstacle
τ(t)’s, thus affording animals with knowledge of, for example, obstacle heights relative
to themselves.
While making these assertions, it is recognized that much spatial information
is available to a pilot and will provide critical cues to position and orientation and
perhaps even motion. For example, familiar objects clearly provide a scale reference
and can guide a pilot’s judgement about clearances or manoeuvre options. However,
the temporal view of motion perception purports that the spatial information is not
essential to the primitive, instinctive processes involved in the control of motion.
Tau research has led to an improved understanding of how animals and humans
control their motion and humans control vehicles. A particular interest is how a driver
or pilot might use τ to avoid a crash state, or how τ might help animals alight on objects.
A driver approaching an obstacle needs to apply a braking (deceleration) strategy that
will avoid collision. One collision-avoid strategy is to control directly the rate of change
of optical tau, which can be written in terms of the instantaneous distance to stop (x),
velocity (˙x) and acceleration (¨x) in the form:
˙τ = 1 −x ¨x
˙x2
(8.8)
The system used here for deﬁning the kinematics of motion is based on a negative gap
x being closed. Hence, with x < 0 and ˙x > 0, ˙τ > 1 implies accelerating ﬂight, ˙τ = 1
implies constant velocity and ˙τ<1 corresponds to deceleration. In the special case of a
constant deceleration, the stopping distance from a velocity ˙x is given by
x = −˙x2
2¨x
(8.9)
Hence, a decelerating helicopter will stop short of the intended hover point if at any

A constant deceleration results in ˙τ progressively decreasing with time and the pilot

The hypothesis that optical τ and ˙τ are the variables that evolution has provided
the animal world with to detect and rapidly process visual information, suggests that
these should be key variables in ﬂight guidance. In Ref. 8.26, Lee extends the concept
to the control of rotations, related to how athletes ensure that they land on their feet
after a somersault. For helicopter manoeuvring, this can be applied to control in turns,
connecting with the heading component of ﬂight motion, or in vertical manoeuvres,
with the ﬂight path angle component of the motion. For example, with heading angle
ψ and turn rate ˙ψ, we can write angular τ as
τ(t) = ψ
˙ψ
(8.12)
A combination of angular and translational τ’s, associated with physical gaps, needs
to be successfully picked up by pilots to ensure ﬂight safety. Figure 8.13 illustrates
three examples of motion τ variations as a function of normalized manoeuvre time.
The results are derived from ﬂight simulation tests undertaken on the Liverpool Flight
Simulator in, nominally, good visual conditions. In all three cases the ﬁnal stages of
the manoeuvre (t approaches 1) are characterized by a roughly constant ˙τ, implying,
as noted above, a constant deceleration to the goal.
Reaching a goal with a constant ˙τ can be achieved without a constant deceleration
of course, and we shall see later in this chapter what the different deceleration proﬁles
look like. For example, if the maximum deceleration towards the goal occurs late in
the manoeuvre, then 0.5 < ˙τ < 1.0, while an earlier peak deceleration corresponds to
0.0 < ˙τ < 0.5. An interesting case occurs when ˙τ = 0, so that however close to the
goal τ remains a constant c, i.e.,
τ = x
˙x = c
(8.13)
The only motion that satisﬁes this relationship is an exponential one, with the goal
approached asymptotically.
An interesting discovery of τ control, although unbeknown at the time, is de-
scribed in Ref. 8.29. In the early 1970s, researchers at NASA Langley conducted ﬂight

trials using several different helicopter types in support of the development of instru-
ment ﬂight procedures and the design of ﬂight director displays to aid pilots during
the approach and landing phases in poor visibility conditions. The engineers had pos-
tulated particular deceleration proﬁles as functions of height and distance from the
landing zone, and the pilots were asked to evaluate the systems based on workload
and performance. Several different design philosophies were evaluated and the pilots
commented that none felt intuitive and that they would use different control strategies
in manual landings, particularly during the ﬁnal stages of the approach. The linear
deceleration proﬁles resulted in pilots concerned that they were being commanded to
hover well short of the touchdown point. The constant deceleration proﬁle was equally
undesirable and led to a high pitch/low power condition as the hover was approached.
The pilots were asked to ﬂy the approaches manually in good visual conditions, from
which the deceleration proﬁles would be derived and then used to drive the ﬂight di-
rector. Figure 8.14 shows a typical variation of deceleration during the approach with
50 knots initial velocity at 500 ft above the ground.
Also shown in the ﬁgure is the computer-generated proﬁle showing a gradual
reduction in speed until the peak deceleration of about 0.15 g is reached 70 m from
the landing pad. The ‘computer-generated’ relationship between acceleration, velocity
and distance took the form
¨x = k ˙x2
xn
(8.14)
where k is a constant derived from the initial conditions. Recalling the formulae for ˙τ
in eqn 8.8, the relationship given by eqn 8.14 can be written in the form
1 −˙τ = k x1−n
(8.15)
The parameters k and n were computed as constants in any single deceleration but
varied with initial condition and across the different pilots. The range power parameter

n varied between 1.2 and 1.7. Note that a value of unity corresponds to a constant
˙τ for the whole manoeuvre. Equation 8.15 suggests that, at long range, the pilot is
maintaining constant velocity (˙τ=1), consistent, of course, with the steady initial ﬂight
condition. As range is reduced, ˙τ reduces until x = k
1
n−1 when ˙τ = 0 and the approach
becomes exponential. Beyond this, the representation in eqn 8.15 breaks down, as it
predicts a negative ˙τ, i.e., the helicopter backs away from the landing pad, although
this can happen in practice. Approaches at constant τ may seem ineffective because
the goal is never reached, but there is evidence that pilots sometimes use this strategy
during the landing ﬂare in ﬁxed-wing aircraft, perhaps as a ‘holding’ strategy as the
ﬂight path lines up with the desired trajectory (see Ref. 8.30).
The concept of τ in motion control has signiﬁcance for helicopter ﬂight in de-
graded visual conditions. If the critical issue for sufﬁciency of visual cues is that they
afford the information to allow the pilot to pick up τ’s of objects and surfaces, then it
follows that the τ’s are measures of spatial awareness. It would also follow that they
would be appropriate measures to use to judge the quality of artiﬁcial vision aids and
form the underlying basis for the design and the information content of vision aids.
This author has conducted a number of experiments to address the question – how do
pilots know when to stop, or to turn or pull up to avoid collision? In the following
sections some results from this research will be presented.

ﬂying a 500 ft accel–decel in a ﬂight simulator trial, and Fig. 8.17 shows the variation
of time to stop, τx, during the deceleration phase of the manoeuvre. The data are taken
from Ref. 8.31, where the author and his colleagues introduced the concept of τ-control
in helicopter ﬂight, also described as prospective control in recognition of the temporal
nature of ﬂight control. The deceleration is seen to extend from about 11 s into the
manoeuvre, when the peak velocity is about 30 knots, for about 10 s, when the time to
stop is nearly 6 s.
Figure 8.17 shows that the correlation of τx with time is very strong, with a
correlation coefﬁcient R2 of 0.998. The slope of the ﬁt, i.e., ˙τ, is 0.58, indicating
a non-constant deceleration with peak during the second half of the manoeuvre. So
the pilot initiates the deceleration when the time to stop is about 6 s and holds an
approximately constant ˙τ strategy through to the stop.
As referred to above, the use of τ in motion control has been the subject of research
in the natural world for some time. In Ref. 8.32, Lee and colleagues have measured
the τ control strategy of pigeons approaching a perch to land. Figure 8.18 shows a
sequence of stills taken during the ﬁnal 0.5 s of the manoeuvre. The analysis of the
photographic data shows that the pigeon controls braking in the last few moments of
ﬂight by maintaining a constant ˙τ for the gap between its feet and the perch, as shown
in Fig. 8.19. The τ of the pigeon’s feet to the landing position is given by τ(xfeet,lp).
The feet are moving forward and the head is moving back, so the visual ‘cues’ are far
from simple. The average slope of the lines in Fig. 8.19 (˙τ) is about 0.8, indicating that

the maximum braking occurs very late in the manoeuvre – the pigeon almost crash
lands, or at least experiences a hard touchdown, which ensures positive contact and is
probably quite deliberate.
So how does a pilot or a pigeon manage to maintain a constant ˙τ, or indeed
any other τ variation, as they approach a goal? In addressing this question for action
in the natural world, Lee gives a new interpretation to the whole process of motion
control, which has signiﬁcant implications for helicopter ﬂight control and the design
of augmentation systems. We now turn to the general theory of τ-coupling, which also
addresses the need for controlling several motion τ’s in more complex manoeuvres
and introduces the concept of the motion guide and its associated τ.
8.2.5
Tau-Coupling – a paradigm for safety in action
General τ theory hypothesizes that the closure of any motion gap is guided by sensing
and adjusting the τ of the associated physical gap (Ref. 8.24). The theory reinforces
the evidence presented in the previous section that information solely about ˙τx is
sufﬁcient to enable the gap x to be closed in a controlled manner, as when making
a gentle landing or coming to hover next to an obstacle. According to the theory, and
contrary to what might be expected, information about the distance to the landing
surface or about the speed and deceleration of approach is not necessary for precise
control of the approach and landing. The theory further suggests that a pilot might
perceive τ of a motion gap by virtue of its proportionality to the τ of a gap in a
‘sensory ﬂow-ﬁeld’ within the visual perception system. In helicopter ﬂight dynamics,
the example of decelerating a helicopter to hover over a landing point on the ground
serves to illustrate the point. The τ of the gap in the optic ﬂow-ﬁeld between the
image of the landing point and the centre of optical outﬂow (which speciﬁes the
instantaneous direction of travel, see Fig. 8.4) is equal to the τ of the motion gap
between the pilot and the vertical plane through the landing point. This is always so,
despite the actual sizes of the optical and motion gaps being quite different; the same
applies to stopping at a point adjacent to an obstacle – see Fig. 8.20.
Often movements have to be rapidly coordinated, as when simultaneously making
a turn and decelerating to stop, or descending and stopping, or performing a bob-up

and, simultaneously, a 90◦turn. This requires accurate synchronizing and sequencing
of the closure of different gaps. To achieve this, visual cues have to be picked up rapidly
and continuously and used to guide the action. τ theory shows how such closed-loop
control might be accomplished by keeping the τ’s of gaps in constant ratio during
the movement, i.e., by τ-coupling. Evidence of τ-coupling in nature is presented in
Refs 8.27 and 8.28 for experiments with echo-locating bats landing on a perch and
infants feeding. In the present context, if a helicopter pilot, descending (along z) and
decelerating (along x), follows the τ-coupling law
τx = kτz
(8.16)
then the desired height will automatically be attained just as the aircraft comes to a
stop at the landing pad. The kinematics of the motion can be regulated by appropriate
choice of the value of the coupling constant k. There is evidence that such coupling
can be exploited successfully in vision aids. For example, the system reported in Ref.
8.22 functioned on the principle of the matching of a cluster of forward-directed light
beams with different look-ahead distances, which translated into times at a given speed.
Such a system was designed as an aid in situations where the natural optical ﬂow was
obscured.
In many manoeuvres such as a hover turn or bob-up, there is essentially only
one gap to be closed, yet the feedback actions must in principle be similar, whether
there are two coupled motion gaps or just one. When a pilot is able to perceive the
motion gaps associated with both the displacement and velocity, then τ-coupling takes
a special form,
τx = x
˙x ,
τ˙x = ˙x
¨x
(8.17)
with
τx = kτ˙x
(8.18)
Combining eqns 8.17 and 8.18, we can write
˙τx = 1 −¨xx
˙x2 = 1 −k
(8.19)
Hence, the ˙τ constant strategy can be expressed as the pilot maintaining the τ’s of the
displacement and velocity in a constant ratio. The more general hypothesis is that the
closure of a single motion gap is controlled by keeping the τ of the motion gap coupled
onto what has been described as an intrinsically generated τ guide, τg (Ref. 8.24).
One form of such a guide is a constant deceleration motion, from an initial condition
xg0(<0), vg0 (>0) given by (c < 0)
ag = c,
vg = vg0 + ct,
xg = xg0 + vg0 t + c

(8.20)
At t = T , the manoeuvre duration, we can write

(8.22)
The constant deceleration τ guide has a ˙τ = 0.5, a result obtained earlier in this section,
and coupling onto this guide with coupling constant k implies
˙τx = k
2
(8.23)
For motions that start at rest, vg = 0, and end at rest, we need to ﬁnd a different form of
guide. In Ref. 8.24, Lee argues that for natural motions such as reaching, which involve
simple phases of acceleration followed by deceleration, it is reasonable to hypothesize
that a simple form of intrinsic τ guide will have evolved that is adequate for guiding
such fundamental movements. In the context of helicopter NoE ﬂight, any of the classic
hover-to-hover repositioning manoeuvres ﬁt into this category of motions. Indeed, in
any manoeuvre that takes the aircraft from one state to another, the pilot is, in essence,
closingagapofonekindoranother.Thehypothesizedintrinsictauguidecorrespondsto
a time-varyingquantity, perhapsa triggeredpattern withinthe perceptionsystem,which
changes from one state to another with a constant acceleration. Surprisingly, coupling
onto this ‘constant acceleration’ intrinsic guide does not, however, generate a motion
of constant acceleration. The resultant motion is, rather, one with an accelerating phase
followed by a decelerating phase. From a similar analyses to the case of the constant
deceleration guide, the equations describing the changing τg can be derived and written
in the form

where T is the duration of the aircraft or body movement and t is the time from the
start of the movement. Coupling the τ of a motion gap, τx, onto such an intrinsic
tauguide, τg, is then described by the equation
τx = kτg
(8.25)
for some coupling constant k. The intrinsic tau guide, τg, has a single adjustable
parameter, T , i.e., its duration. The value of T is assumed to be set to ﬁt the movement
either into a deﬁned temporal structure, as when coming to a stop in a conﬁned space,
or in a relatively free way, as in the simple movement of reaching for an object. In the
case of a helicopter ﬂying from hover to hover across a clearing, we can hypothesize
that time constraints are mission related and the pilot can adjust the urgency, within
limits, through the level of aggressiveness applied to the controls. The kinematics of
a movement can be regulated by setting both T and the coupling constant, k in eqn
8.18, to appropriate values. For example, the higher the value of k, the longer will be
the acceleration period of the movement, the shorter the deceleration period and the
more abruptly will the movement end. We describe situations with k values >0.5 as
hard stops (i.e., k close to unity corresponds to a situation where the peak velocity is
pushed close to the end of the manoeuvre) and situations with k < 0.5 as soft stops,
similar to the constant ˙τ strategy.
The following of a constant acceleration guide in an accel–decel manoeuvre is
conceptualized in Fig. 8.21. Both aircraft and guide, shown as a ball, start at the same

point (normalized distance xg = −1.0) and time (t = 0) and reach the end of the
manoeuvre at the same time, t = T. The ball is continuing to accelerate at this point
of course, while the helicopter has come to the hover. For the case k = 0.5, the aircraft
has covered about 35% of the manoeuvre distance when xg = −0.8 and about 85% of
the distance when xg = −0.4. With k = 0.2, when xg = −0.8, the aircraft has covered
two-thirds of the manoeuvre and when xg = −0.6, the aircraft is within 10% of the
stopping point. As k increases, so does the point in the manoeuvre when the reversal
from acceleration to deceleration occurs. The time in the manoeuvre when the reversal
occurs, tr, can be derived as a function of the coupling coefﬁcient k by noting that, at
this point, ˙τx = 1; from eqns 8.24 and 8.25, we can write
˙τx = k

Thus, when k = 0.2, tr = 0.333T , when k = 0.4, tr = 0.5T and when k = 0.6,
tr = 0.67T , etc.
When two variables, i.e., the motion x and the motion guide xg, are related through
their τ-coupling in the form of eqn 8.25, it can be shown (Ref. 8.23) that they are also
related through a power law
x ∝x1/k

(8.28)
This relationship is ubiquitous in nature, governing the relationships between stimuli
and sensory responses. Normalizing the distance and time by the manoeuvre length
and duration respectively, the motion kinematics (for negative initial x) can be written
as

The coupling parameter k determines exactly how the closed-loop control func-

The manoeuvre kinematics are presented in Fig. 8.22 of a motion that perfectly tracks
the constant acceleration τ guide for various values of coupling constant k. The mo-
tion t is shown in Fig. 8.22(a), the motion gap, x, in Fig. 8.22(b), the gap closure rate
(normalized velocity) in Fig. 8.22(c) and the normalized acceleration in Fig. 8.22(d);
all are shown plotted against normalized time.
The closure rate, shown in Fig. 8.22(c), illustrates a typical accel-decel-type
velocity proﬁle (cf. ˙x in Fig. 8.16). For k = 0.2 the maximum velocity occurs about
30% into the manoeuvre, while for k = 0.8 the peak occurs close to the end of the
manoeuvre.

An example of the success of this more general strategy is shown in Fig. 8.23,
showing the same case from Ref. 8.31, illustrated previously in Fig. 8.16, but now for
the helicopter ﬂying the complete accel–decel manoeuvre. The coupling coefﬁcient is
0.28, giving a power factor of 3.5, with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.98.
In the analysis of the Ref. 8.31 data, the start and end of the manoeuvres were
cropped at 10% of the peak velocity. The tests were ﬂown on the DERA/QinetiQ large
motion simulator as part of a series of tests with a Lynx-like helicopter examining
the effect of levels of aggressiveness on handling qualities and simulation ﬁdelity.
Considering all 15 accel–decels that were ﬂown, the mean values of k follow the
trends expected based on Fig. 8.22 (low aggression, k = 0.381; moderate aggression,
k = 0.324; high aggression, k = 0.317). As the aggression level increases, the pilot
elects to initiate the deceleration earlier in the manoeuvre: low aggression 0.5T into
manoeuvre when τ ≈6 s; high aggression 0.4T into manoeuvre when τ ≈4.5 s. The
pilot is more constrained during the deceleration phase, with the pilot limiting the
nose-up attitude to about 20◦to avoid a complete loss of visual cues in the vertical
ﬁeld of view.

An intrinsic τ guide is effectively a mental model, created by the nervous system,
which directs the motion. It clearly has to be well informed (by visual cues in the present
case) to be safe. Constant acceleration is one of the few natural motions, created in the
short term by the gravitational ﬁeld, so it is not surprising that the perception system
might well have developed to exploit such motions. But the nature of the coupling, the
chosen manoeuvre time T and proﬁle parameter k must depend on the performance
capability of the aircraft (or the animal performing a purposeful action), and pilots (or
birds) need to train to ‘programme’ these patterns into their repertoire of ﬂying skills.
When the visual environment degrades so does the ability of the pilot’s perception
system to pick up the required information and hence to track the error between actual
motionsandintrinsicguides.TheUCEis,inasense,ameasureofthisability,suggesting
that there should be a relationship between UCE and the τ of the motion when initiating
a manoeuvre to stop, turn or pull-up. In the low-aggression case of Ref. 8.31, the pilot
returned Level 1 HQRs and initiated the deceleration when τ ≈6 s, taking about 10 s
to come to the hover. The pilot could clearly pick up the visual ‘cues’ of the trees at
the stopping point throughout.
The question of how far, or more appropriately how long, into the future the pilot
needs to be able to see is critical to ﬂight safety and the design of vision augmentation
systems. The research reported in Ref. 8.31 has been extended to address this question
speciﬁcally, and preliminary results are reported in Ref. 8.33. The focus of attention
in this study was terrain following in the presence of degraded visibility, in particular
fog, and we continue this chapter with a review of the results of this work and analysis
of low-speed terrain following in the DVE.
8.2.6
Terrain-following ﬂight in degraded visibility
As a pilot approaches rising ground, the point at which the climb is initiated depends
on the forward speed and also the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft, reﬂected
in the vertical performance capability and the time constant in response to collective
pitch inputs; at speeds below minimum power, height control is exercised almost
solely through collective inputs. A matched manoeuvre could be postulated as one

 
546
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
where the pilot applies the required amount of collective at the last possible moment
so that the climb rate reaches steady state, with the aircraft ﬂying parallel to the surface
of the hill. For low-speed ﬂight, vertical manoeuvres can be approximately described
by a ﬁrst-order differential equation (see Chapter 5, eqn 5.52), with its solution to a
step input in the pilot’s collective lever given by
˙w −Zww = Zθ0θ0
w = wss(1 −eZwt)
(8.32)
In the usual notation, w is the aircraft normal velocity (positive down), wss the
steady state value of w and θ0 is the collective pitch angle. Zw is the heave damping
derivative (see Chapter 4), or the negative inverse of the aircraft time constant in the
heave axis, tw. Writing δw =
w
wss , the time to achieve δw can be written in the form
tδw
tw
= −loge(1 −δw)
(8.33)
When δw = 0.63, tδw = tw, the heave time constant. To reach 90% of the ﬁnal
steady state would take 2.3 time constants and to reach 99% would take nearly 5 time
constants. In ADS-33, Level 1 handling qualities are achieved if tw < 5 s, and for
many aircraft types, values of 3–4 s are typical. In reality, because of the exponential
nature of the response, the aircraft never reaches the steady-state climb following a
step input. In fact, following a step collective, the aircraft approaches its steady-state
in a particular manner. The instantaneous time to reach steady-state rate of climb
−w, τw, varies with time and is deﬁned as the ratio of the instantaneous differential
(negative) velocity to the acceleration; hence
˙w = −wss ZweZwt
τw = w −wss
˙w
=
1
Zw
= −tw
(8.34)
The instantaneous time to reach steady state, τw, is therefore a constant and equal to
the negative of the time constant of the aircraft tw – a somewhat novel interpretation
of the heave time constant. The step input requires no compensatory workload but,
theoretically, the aircraft never reaches its destination. To achieve the steady-state
goal, the pilot needs to adopt a more complex control strategy and will use the
available visual cues to ensure that τ w reaches zero when the aircraft has reached the
appropriate climb rate; the complexity of this strategy determines the pilot workload.
In the simulation trial reported in Ref. 8.33, the pilot was launched in a low hover
and requested to accelerate forward and climb to a level ﬂight trim condition that he
or she considered suited the environment. To ensure that all the visual information for
stabilization and guidance was derived from the outside world, head-down instruments
were turned off. After establishing the trim condition, the pilot was required to negotiate
a hill with 5◦slope rising 60 m above the terrain. The terrain was textured with a rich,
relatively unstructured surface, and to explore the effects of degraded visual conditions
fog was located at distances of 80, 240, 480 and 720 m ahead of the aircraft. The fog was
simulated as a shell of abrupt obscuration surrounding a sphere of ‘clear air’ centred
on the pilot.

Fig. 8.24 Terrain following – UCE chart for different fog cases
The visual cue ratings (VCRs) and associated UCEs and handling qualities ratings
(HQRs) for the different cases are given in Table 8.1. The methodology adopted was
an adaptation of that in ADS-33, where the UCE is derived from VCRs given by
three pilots ﬂying a set of low-speed manoeuvres. The concept of UCE >3 is also an
adaptation to reﬂect visual conditions where the pilot was not prepared to award a VCR
within the deﬁned scale (1–5). The VCRs are also plotted on the UCE chart in Fig. 8.24.
As expected, the increased workload in the DVE led the pilot to award poorer HQRs,
and the UCE degraded from 1 to 3. For the HQRs, the adequate performance boundary
was set at 50% of nominal height and the desired boundary at 25% of nominal height.
No numerical constraints were placed on speed but the pilot was requested to maintain
a reasonably constant speed.
Key questions addressed in Ref. 8.33 were ‘would the pilot elect to ﬂy at dif-
ferent heights and speeds in the different conditions,’ and ‘how would these relate to
the body-scaled measure, the eye-height?’ Would the pilot use intrinsic τguides to
successfully transition into the climb, and what form would these take? Could the pilot
control strategy be modelled based on τ following principles? Earlier in this chapter
we discussed a pilot’s ability to pick up visual information from the surface over which

the aircraft was ﬂying and drew attention to Ref. 8.15, where Perrone had hypothesized
that the looming of patterns on a rough surface would become detectable at about 16
eye-heights (xe) ahead of the aircraft. In the various simulation exercises conducted
at Liverpool there is some evidence that this reduces to about 12xe for the textured
surfaces used; hence, we reference results to this metric in the following discussion.
The average distances and times to the fog-lines, along with the velocity and time
to the 12 eye-height point ahead of the aircraft, are given in Table 8.2. The results
indicate that as the distance to the fog-line reduces the pilot ﬂies lower and slower,
while maintaining eye-height speed relatively constant. Comparing the 720-m fog-line
case with the 240-m case, the average eye-height velocity is almost identical, while
the actual speed and height has almost doubled. For the UCE = 3 case, the aircraft
has slowed to below 2 xe per second, as the distance to the fog-line has reduced to
within 20% of the 12 eye-height point. It is worth noting that the test pilot, who has
extensive military and civil piloting experience, declared that the UCE = 3 case would
not be acceptable unless urgent operational requirements prevailed; it simply would not
be safe in an undulating, cluttered environment, and where the navigational demands
would strongly interfere with guidance.
Figure 8.25 shows the vertical ﬂight path (height in metres) and ﬂight velocity (in
metres/second and xe per second) plotted against range (metres) for the different fog
cases. The pilots were requested to ﬂy along the top of the hill for a further 2000 m
to complete the run.
The distances along the ﬂight path to the terrain surface, as the sloping ground
is approached, are shown in Fig. 8.26. While the actual distances vary signiﬁcantly,
the distances in eye-heights to the surface reduce to between 12 and 16 eye-heights,
as the hill is approached and during the initial climb phase. The times to contact the
terrain, τ surface, are shown in Fig. 8.27. Typically, the pilot allowed τsurface to reduce
to between 6 and 8 s before initiating the climb. These results are consistent with those
derived in the acceleration–deceleration manoeuvre. In the UCE = 3 case (fog at 80 m)
the pilot is ﬂying at 10 m/s, giving about 8 s look-ahead time to the fog-line and only
2–3 s margin from the 12 xe point. The results suggest a relationship between the UCE
and the margin between the postulated, 12 xe, look-ahead point and any obscuration;
this point will be revisited towards the end of this section, but prior to this the variation
of ﬂight path angle during the climb will be analyzed to investigate the degree of τ
guide following during the manoeuvre.
τ on the rising curve
For the τ analysis, the aircraft ﬂight path angle γ is converted to γa, the negative
perturbation in γ from the ﬁnal state, as illustrated in Fig. 8.28.

Fig. 8.29 γa, ˙γa during the climb
The γ ’s-to-go and associated time rates of change are plotted in Fig. 8.29 for the
UCE = 1 and UCE = 2 fog-line cases, although it should be noted that the 240-m case
is actually borderline UCE = 2/UCE = 3. In Fig. 8.29, time has been normalized by
the duration of the climb transient (fog = 240 m, T = 2.5 s; fog = 480 m, T = 4.3 s;
fog = 720 m, T = 4.7 s). The ﬁnal value of the ﬂight path angle was chosen as the value
when ˙γ ﬁrst became zero (thus deﬁning T and γ f ); hence, although the hill had a 5◦
slope, the values used correspond to the ﬁrst overshoot peak value. From that time on,
the pilot closes the loop on a new τ gap, related to the ﬂight path error from above. As
can be seen from the initial conditions, the pilot tends to overshoot the 5◦hill slope with
increasing extent as the UCE degrades – ﬂight path angle of 8.5◦for the 240-m fog-line
(UCE 2/3), 7◦for the 480-m fog-line case (UCE 2) and 6◦for the 720-m case (UCE 1).
Figure 8.30 shows the variation of τγ with normalized time. The ﬂuctuations
reﬂect the higher frequency content in the ˙γ function. As the goal is approached the
curves straighten out and develop a slope of between 0.6 and 0.7, corresponding to the
pilot following the ˙τ constant guide with peak deceleration close to the goal.
As with the accel–decel manoeuvre, the pilot is changing from one state to an-
other (horizontal position for the accel–decel, ﬂight path angle for the climb), and as
discussed earlier, the natural guide for ensuring that such changes of state are achieved
successfully is the constant acceleration guide, with the relationship, τγ = kτg.
Figure 8.31 shows results for the τγ versus τg correlation for the terrain climb
in the three fog conditions. In the UCE = 1 case (720 m fog), apart from a slight
departure at the end of the manoeuvre, the ﬁt is tight for the full 5 s (R2 = 0.99).
The departures from the close ﬁt at both the beginning and end of such state change

manoeuvres are considered to be transient effects, partly due to the need for the pilot
to ‘organize’ the visual information so that the required gaps are clearly perceived and
partly due to the contaminating effects of the pitch changes that disrupt the visual cues
for ﬂight path changes picked up from the optic ﬂow. Table 8.3 gives the coupling
coefﬁcients, k, for all cases ﬂown. The lower the k value, the earlier in the manoeuvre
the maximum motion gap closure rate occurs (e.g., a value of 0.5 corresponds to
a symmetric manoeuvre). There is a suggestion that k reduces as UCE degrades,
conﬁrmed by the results in Fig. 8.31. The pilot has commanded a ﬂight path angle
rate of about 6◦/s less than 40% into the manoeuvre in the UCE = 2–3 case compared
with about 2.5◦/s about 50% into the manoeuvre in the UCE = 1 case.
Typical correlations between τγ and τg are shown in Fig. 8.32, plotted against
normalized time. The relatively constant slope during the second half of the manoeuvre
indicates that the pilot has adopted a constant ˙τ strategy. As expected, the test data
track the constant acceleration guide fairly closely over the whole manoeuvre.
The results reveal a strong level of coupling with the τ guide. This was not
unexpected. In a complementary study, τ analysis has been conducted on data from
approach and landing manoeuvres for ﬁxed-wing aircraft (Ref. 8.30). During the land-
ing ﬂare, the pilot follows the τ guide to the touchdown. Instrument approaches where
the visibility was reduced to the equivalent of Cat IIIb (cloud base 50 ft, runway visual
range 150 ft) were investigated, and in some cases the coupling reached the limiting
case of constant τ, the pilot effectively levelling off just above the runway. The results
presented are consistent with those presented in Ref. 8.30, unsurprisingly as the ﬂare
and terrain climb tasks make very similar demands on the pilot in terms of visual
information.

The normalized functions θ0 and γ a(independent of tw ) are plotted in Figs 8.33 and

three cases correspond to the parameter tw set at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5. The strategy involves
increasing the collective gradually, and well beyond the steady-state value, and then
decreasing as the target rate of climb is approached. For tw = 0.5, when the heave
time constant is half the manoeuvre duration, the overdriving of the control is limited
to about 50% of the steady-state value. As the ratio increases to 1.5, so too does the
overdriving to as much as 250% at the lower k values. This overshoot is unlikely to
be achievable even when operating with a low-power margin. As k increases, the peak

collective lever position occurs later in the manoeuvre until the limiting case where it
is reduced as a down-step in the ﬁnal instant to bring ˙γ a to zero. When approaching
a slope, the pilot has scope to select T, hence tw, and k, to ensure that the control
and hence the manoeuvre trajectory are within the capability of the aircraft. Whatever
values are selected, the control strategy is far removed from the abrupt, open-loop
character associated with a step input.

Normalized Flight Path Response
Fig. 8.34 Normalized ﬂight path response for a ﬂight path angle change following a
constant acceleration τ guide–variations with k
A comparison of normalized collective inputs and ﬂight path angles with the
τ-coupled predictions for representative cases is shown in Fig. 8.35. The large peak
for the 240-m fog-line case resulted in the overshoot to 10◦ﬂight path angle discussed
earlier and could be argued in a case where the pilot has lost track of the cues that enable
the τ-coupling to remain coherent. The actual pilot control inputs appear more abrupt
than the predicted values but it again could be argued that the pilot needs to stimulate
the ﬂow-ﬁeld initially with such inputs. There is good agreement for the ﬂight path
angle variations.
In Ref. 8.31, the notion was put forward that ‘the overall pilot’s goal is to overlay
the optic ﬂow-ﬁeld over the required ﬂight trajectory – the chosen path between the
trees, over the hill or through the valley – thus matching the optical and required ﬂight
motion’. This concept can be extended to embrace the idea that the overlay technique
can happen within a temporal as well as spatial context. The results presented above
convey a compelling impression of pilots coupling onto a natural τ guide during the
3–5 s of the climb phase of the terrain-hugging manoeuvre. As in the accel–decel
manoeuvre, pilots appear to pick up their visual information from about 12 to 16 eye-
heights ahead of the aircraft and establish a ﬂight speed that gives a corresponding
look-ahead time of about 6–8 s. As height is reduced, the pilot slows down to maintain
velocity in eye-heights, and corresponding look-ahead time, relatively constant. The
manoeuvre is typically initiated when the τsurface reduces to about 6 s and takes between
4 and 5 s to complete. Of course, the manoeuvre time must depend on the heave time
constant of the aircraft being ﬂown. For the FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft simula-
tionmodelusedinthetrials,tw variesbetween3sinhoverand1.3sat60knots,reducing
to below 1 s above 100 knots. Much stronger interference between the aircraft and task
dynamics would be expected with aircraft that exhibited much slower heave response
(e.g., aircraft featuring rotors with high-disc loadings), as illustrated in Fig. 8.32.
The temporal framework of ﬂight control offers the potential for developing more
quantitative UCE metrics. For example, in the terrain manoeuvres described above, the
UCE = 3 case was characterized by the distance to visual obscuration coming within
about 20% of the 12 eye-height point (i.e., ≈1 s). For the UCE = 1 case, the margin
was more than 6 s. Sufﬁciency of visual information for the task is the essence of
safe ﬂight and τ envelopes can be imagined which relate to the terrain contouring and

associated MTEs. These constructs might then be used to deﬁne the appropriate speed
and height to be ﬂown in given terrain and visual environment. Visual information that
provides clear cues to the pilot to enable coupling onto the natural τ guides could then
form the basis for quantitative requirements for artiﬁcial aids to visual guidance that
improve both attitude and translational rate contributions to the UCE.
The goal of a pilotage augmentation system, designed to extend operational ca-
pability in a DVE, must be to achieve performance without compromising safety,
reducing fatigue by reducing cognitive workload and increasing conﬁdence to allow
aggressive manoeuvring. The designers of such synthetic vision systems can utilize the
natural, reﬂexive pilot skills, and several pathway-in-the-sky type formats are currently
under development or being explored in research (e.g., Refs 8.34, 8.35) that exhibit
such properties. Designers also have the freedom to combine such formats with more
detailed display structures for precision tracking, e.g., the pad-capture mode on the
AH-64A (Ref. 8.36). This type of format requires the pilot to apply cognitive atten-
tion, closing the control loop using detailed individual features to achieve the desired
precision, hence risking a loss of situation awareness with respect to the outside world.
Achieving a balance between precision and situation awareness is the pilot’s task and
what is appropriate will change with different circumstances. Quite generally however,
when equipped with an adequate sensor suite, there seems no good reason why a large
part of the stabilization and tracking tasks should not be accomplished by the automatic
ﬂight control system.
Improving ﬂying qualities for ﬂight in a DVE is about the integration of vision and
control augmentation. The UCE describes the utility and adequacy of visual cues for
guidance and stabilization. The pilot rates the visual cues based on how aggressively
and precisely corrections to attitude and velocity can be made. An assumption in this
approach is that the aircraft has Level 1, rate command handling qualities in a GVE. In
a DVE, the handling qualities of the aircraft degrade because of the impoverishment
Fig. 8.36 Conceptualization of ﬂying qualities improvements in the DVE

 
560
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
of the visual cues. According to the UCE methodology of ADS-33, provided the DVE
is no worse than UCE = 3, Level 1 handling qualities can be ‘recovered’ by control
augmentation. The augmentation process therefore appears straightforward, at least in
principle: recover to UCE = 3 or better via vision augmentation, and then use control
augmentation, to recover Level 1 ﬂying qualities – Fig. 8.36 conceptualizes this idea.
Helicopter ﬂight in degraded visibility will remain dangerous, with a consequent
higher risk to ﬂight safety, without vision augmentation. A key characteristic of a
good vision aid is that it should provide the pilot with clear and coherent cues for
judging operationally relevant, desired and adequate performance standards for ﬂight
path and attitude control. The ADS-33 handling qualities requirements then provide the
design criteria for control augmentation. The higher the levels of augmentation and the
stronger the control feedback gains, required an increased level of safety monitoring
and redundancy to protect against the negative effects of failure, which leads us to the
second topic in this chapter.
8.3
Handling Qualities Degradation through Flight
System Failures
The second issue of the Journal of the Helicopter Society of Great Britain, published
in 1947, featured just two papers. The ﬁrst was by Sikorsky and has already been
referred to in the Introduction to this chapter (Ref. 8.1). The second was by O.L.L.
Fitzwilliams, or ‘Fitz’ as he was affectionately known to his colleagues at Westland
Helicopters, where he worked at the time of writing the paper in late 1947. Fitz had
previously worked at the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at Beaulieu,
near Southampton, England, during the Second World War and his paper partly cov-
ered his experiences there, including tests conducted on German rotorcraft acquired
during the closing stages of the war. One such type was the ﬁrst production helicopter
(Ref. 8.37) – the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223, a development of the ﬁrst practical heli-
copter, the FW.61. The Fa 223 aircraft was ﬂown ‘by its German crew, via Paris, to
the A.F.E.E., at Beaulieu, where it arrived in September 1945, having performed the
ﬁrst crossing of the English Channel by a helicopter’. The Fa 223 was a twin rotor
conﬁguration with longitudinal cyclic control for pitch and differential collective for
roll. Differential longitudinal cyclic gave yaw control in hover, supplemented by the
rudder in forward ﬂight. All these functions are nowadays to be found on a modern tilt
rotor aircraft. More details of the ﬂight control system on the Fa 223 are reported in
Refs 8.38 and 8.39. Figure 8.37, from Ref. 8.39, shows a photograph of the aircraft at
Beaulieu.
The handling qualities problems of the Fa 223 largely stemmed from the mech-
anism for lift control – essentially throttle and rotorspeed, which resulted in major
deﬁciencies. To quote from Ref. 8.39,
In hovering or in low speed ﬂight, the control of the lift by means of the throttle
is extremely sluggish and has contributed to the destruction of at least one aircraft
following a downwind turn after take off. Moreover, the sluggishness of the lift control
necessitates a high approach for landing and a protracted landing manoeuvre, during
which the aircraft is exposed to the dangers consequent on operation of the change
mechanism.

 
Degraded Flying Qualities
561
Fig. 8.37 The Fa 223 twin rotor helicopter at Beaulieu in British markings
The ‘change mechanism’ allowed the pilot, via a two-position lever, to change the mean
blade pitch to its helicopter position (up) or its autorotation position (down). Lowering
the lever caused the engine clutch to be disengaged, and the rotor blades rotate at
a controlled rate (via a hydraulic ram and spring) to the autorotative pitch setting.
This mechanism operated automatically in the event of engine failure, transmission
failure and a number of other ‘failure modes’, some of which appear not to have been
fully taken into account during design (Ref. 8.39). The failure mechanism was also
irreversible and Fitz recounts his experience during an early ﬂight test with the aircraft,
when an auxiliary drive failure caused an automatic change to the autorotative condition
(Ref. 8.37).
Once the mechanism had operated, even voluntarily, it was impossible to regain
the helicopter condition in ﬂight and a glide landing was necessary. In fact, with
the high disc loading of this aircraft (author’s note; 5.9 lb/ft2 at 9,500 lb) and the
absence of any control over the blade pitch, a glide landing was essential and if
there was not enough height for this purpose the operation of this so-called safety
mechanism would dump the aircraft as a heap of wreckage on to the ground. This
actually happened, at about 60–70 ft above the ground, shortly after the machine
arrived at Beaulieu, and I was among those who were sitting in it at the time. In
consequence, I have a strong prejudice against trick gadgets in helicopter control
systems and also a rooted objection to helicopters, however light their disc loadings,
which do not allow the pilot direct manual control over the blade pitch in order to
cushion a forced landing.
Although the Fa 223 ﬁrst ﬂew in August 1940, at the cessation of hostilities only three
aircraft existed and the loss of the aircraft at Beaulieu brought to a premature end to
the testing of what was undoubtedly a remarkable aircraft with a number of ingenious
design features, notwithstanding Fitz’s prejudices.
Nowadays, the safety assessment of this design through a failure modes and
effects analysis (FMEA) would have deemed the consequences of this failure mode
close to the ground ‘catastrophic’, and a greater reliability would be required in the
basic design. An engine failure at low altitude would have been equally catastrophic of
course, without control of collective pitch, as Fitz implied, but this is no justiﬁcation

 
562

for having a safety device that itself had a hazardous failure mode. In handling qualities
terms, the failure, at least while the aircraft was in hover close to the ground, resulted
in degradation to Level 4 conditions, the pilot effectively losing control of the aircraft.
In the Introductory Tour to this book in Chapter 2, the author cited another example
of a helicopter being ﬂown in severely degraded handling qualities. The cases of the
S.51 and the Fa 223 are highlighted not to demonstrate poor design features of early
types (hindsight offers some clarity but usually fails to show the complete picture),
but rather to draw to the reader’s attention to the way in which the helicopter brought
new experiences to the world of aviation, 40 years after the Wright brothers’ ﬁrst
ﬂight, at a time when ‘ﬂying qualities’ was in its infancy and still a very immature
discipline. But a holistic discipline it would become, spurred by the need for pilots and
engineers to deﬁne a framework within which the performance increases pursued by
operators, for commercial or military advantage, could be accommodated with safety.
How to deal with failures has always been an important part of this framework and
we continue this chapter with a discussion of current practices for quantifying ﬂying
qualities degradation following failures of ﬂight system functions.
8.3.1
Methodology for quantifying ﬂying qualities following
ﬂight function failures
The structure of Flying Qualities Levels provides the framework for analysing and
quantifying the effects in the event of a ﬂight system failure. Failures can be described
under three headings – loss, malfunction or degradation – as described below:
(a)
Loss of function: for example, when a control becomes locked at a particular value or
some default status, hence where the control surface does not respond at all to a
control input;
(b)
Malfunction: for example, when the control surface does not move consistently with
the input, as in a hard-over, slow-over or oscillatory movement;
(c)
Degradation of function: in this case the function is still operating but with degraded
performance, e.g., low-voltage power supply or reduced hydraulic pressure.
The ﬁrst stage in a ﬂying qualities degradation assessment involves drawing up
a failure hazard analysis table, whereby every possible control function (e.g., pitch
through longitudinal cyclic, yaw through tail rotor collective, trim switch) is examined
for the effects of loss, malfunction and degradation. This assessment is normally con-
ducted by an experienced team of engineers and pilots to establish the failure effect as
minor, major, hazardous or catastrophic. Table 8.4 summarizes the deﬁnitions of these
hazard categories in terms of the effects of the failure and the associated allowable
maximum probability of occurrence per ﬂight hour (Ref. 8.40). The table refers to the
system safety requirements for civil aircraft.
In the military standard ADS-33, the approach taken is deﬁned in the following
steps (Ref. 8.3) (author’s italics for emphasis):
(a)
tabulate all rotorcraft failure states (loss, malfunction, degradation),
(b)
determine the degree of handling qualities degradation associated with the transient
for each rotorcraft failure state,
(c)
determine the degree of handling qualities degradation associated with the
subsequent steady rotorcraft failure state,

calculate the probability of encountering each identiﬁed rotorcraft failure state per
ﬂight hour,
(e)
compute the total probabilities of encountering Level 2 and Level 3 ﬂying qualities in
the Operational and Service Flight Envelopes. This total is the sum of the rate of
each failure only if the failures are statistically independent.
Degradation in the handling qualities level, due to a failure, is permitted only if the
probability of encountering the degraded level is sufﬁciently small. These probabilities
shall be less than the values shown in Table 8.5. The probabilities used in ADS-33 are
based on the ﬁxed-wing requirements in Ref. 8.41, but converted from the probability
per ﬂight to the probability per ﬂight hour, with the premise that a typical ﬁxed-
wing mission lasts 4 h. The requirements are not nearly as demanding as the civil
requirements of Table 8.4 where the probabilities are typically two orders of magnitude
lower.
In contrast, the UK Defence Standard (Ref. 8.42) deﬁnes safety criteria for failures
of automatic ﬂight control systems (AFCS) according to Table 8.6. The effect is deﬁned

Loss of control is a most serious event, and huge emphasis on safety in the aviation
world is there to ensure that all possible events that might lead to a loss of a ﬂight
critical function are thoroughly examined and steps taken in the design process to
ensure that such losses are extremely improbable. In military use, when helicopters
can be exposed to the hazards of war, steps are sometimes taken to build in additional
levels of redundancy in case of battle damage. For example, the AH-64 Apache features
a back-up, ﬂy-by-wire control system that can be engaged following a jam or damage in
the mechanical control runs. The tail rotor is particularly vulnerable to battle damage,
and a study carried out by DERA and Westland for the UK MoD and CAA, during
the mid–late 1990s, identiﬁed that tail rotor failures occur in training and peace-time
operations at a rate signiﬁcantly higher than the airworthiness requirements demand.
In the following section some of the ﬁndings of that study are presented and discussed.
Tail rotor failures
We broaden the scope to include both types of tail rotor failure: drive failure, where the
drive-train is broken and a complete loss of tail rotor effectiveness results, and control
failure, where the drive is maintained but the pilot is no longer able to apply pitch to
the tail rotor. Both examples result in a loss of the yaw control function and can occur
because of technical faults or operational damage. References 8.43 and 8.44 describe
a programme of research aimed at reviewing the whole issue of tail rotor failures and
developing improved advice to aircrew on the actions required, following a tail rotor
failure in ﬂight. The activity was spurred by the ﬁndings of the UK MoD/CAA Tail
Rotor Action Committee (TRAC), which in particular were as follows (Ref. 8.9):
(a)
Tail rotor failures occur at an unacceptably high rate. MoD statistics between 1974
and 1993 showed a tail rotor technical failure rate of about 11 per million ﬂying
hours; the design standards require the probability of transmission/drive failure that
would prevent a subsequent landing to be remote (<1 in a million ﬂying hours, Ref.
8.42); a review of UK civil accident and incident data revealed a similar failure rate.
(b)
Tail rotor drive failures are three times more prevalent than control failures.
(c)
There appear to be signiﬁcant differences in the handling qualities post-tail rotor
failure, between different types (e.g., some designs appeared to be uncontrollable,

and the probability of an accident resulting from a failure is greater with some types
than others), although there is a dearth of knowledge on individual types.
(d)
Improved handling advice would enhance survivability.
TRAC recommended that work should be undertaken to develop validated advice
for pilot action in the event of a tail rotor failure for the different types in the UK
military ﬂeet, and also that airworthiness requirements should be reviewed and updated
to minimize the likelihood of tail rotor failures on future designs. In the study that
followed, validation was classiﬁed into three types – validation type 1 corresponding
to full demonstration in ﬂight, validation type 2 corresponding to demonstration in
piloted simulation combined with best analysis and validation type 3 corresponding to
engineering judgement based on calculation and also read-across from other types. It
was judged that the best advice that could be achieved would be supported by type 1
validation for control failures and type 2 validation for drive failures.
Thestudy,reportedfullyinRef.8.44,drewdatafromavarietyofsourcesincluding
the MoD and CAA, the US Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard and the US National
Transport Safety Board (NTSB). The overall failures rates were relatively consistent
across all helicopter ‘ﬂeets’ and occurred in the range 9–16 per million ﬂying hours.
Recall that civil transport category aircraft are required to have a failure rate for ﬂight
critical components of no more than 1 in 109 ﬂying hours. Of the 100 ‘tailfails’ in
the UK helicopter ﬂeet between the mid-70s and mid-90s, 30% were caused by drive
failure and 16% by control failure or loss of control effectiveness. Tail rotor loss due
to collision with obstacle or vice versa accounted for 45% of the failures.
When investigating ﬂying qualities in failed conditions, two different aspects need
to be addressed – the characteristics during the failure transient and post-failure ﬂying
qualities, including those during any emergency landing. Both are, to some extent,
inﬂuenced by the ﬂight condition from which the failure has occurred. For example,
the failure transients and optimum pilot actions will be quite different when in a low
hover compared with those in high-speed cruise, well clear of the ground. The required
actions will also be different for drive and control failures. Furthermore, in the case
of control failures, the aircraft and appropriate pilot responses will depend on whether
the control fails to a high pitch or low pitch, or some intermediate value, perhaps
designed in as a fail-safe mechanism to mitigate the adverse effects of a control linkage
failure.
Reference 8.44 describes a ﬂight trial, using a Lynx helicopter, where control fail-
ures were ‘simulated’ by the second pilot (P2) applying pedals to the failure condition.
P2 held the failed condition, while P1 endeavoured to develop successful recovery
strategies using a combination of cyclic and collective. The high-pitch control fail-
ure mode results in a nose-left yaw (for anti-clockwise rotors), the severity of which
depends on the initial power setting and aircraft speed. For example, the magnitude
of control and yaw excursions will be greater from ﬂight at minimum power speed
than cruise. Accompanying the yaw will be roll and pitch motions, driven by the in-
creasing sideslip. In the ﬂight trials, a number of different techniques were explored to
recover the aircraft to a stable and controllable ﬂight condition. For failures in high-
speed cruise, attempts to decelerate through the power bucket to a safe-landing speed
were unsuccessful; the right sideslip (left yaw) built up to limiting values, and control-
ling heading with cyclic demanded a very high workload. A successful strategy was
developed as illustrated in Fig. 8.38.

 
566
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
Fig. 8.38 Sequence of events following high-pitch tail rotor failure in cruise
A high-power climbing turn to the left gave a sufﬁciently stable ﬂight condition
so that deceleration could be accomplished without the aircraft diverging in yaw. The
aircraft could then be levelled out at about 40 knots and a slow decelerating descent
initiated. Gentle turns to both right and left (left preferred) were possible in this condi-
tion. The landing was accomplished by lining the aircraft up with the nose well to port
and applying collective, and levelling the aircraft, just before touchdown to arrest the
rate of descent and align the aircraft with the ﬂight path. Running landings between 20
and 40 knots could be achieved with this strategy. In comparison, low thrust control
failures resulted in the aircraft yawing to starboard. Reducing power then arrests the
yaw transient and allows the aircraft to be manoeuvred to a new trimmed airspeed.
During recovery it was important that the pilot yawed the aircraft with collective to
achieve a right sideslip condition, so that collective cushioning prior to landing yawed
the aircraft into the ﬂight path.
The drive failures were conducted in the relative safety of the DERA advanced
ﬂight simulator (see Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2). The trial was conducted within the broad
framework of the ﬂying qualities methodology with task performance judged by the
pilot’s ability to land within the airframe limits, i.e., touchdown velocities and drift
angle. Unlike a control failure, where the tail rotor continues to provide directional
stability in forward ﬂight, in a drive failure this stability augmentation reduces to zero
as the tail rotor runs down. For failures from both hover and forward ﬂight, survival
is critically dependent on the pilot recognizing the failure and reducing the power to
zero as quickly as possible. Figure 8.39 shows the sequence of events following a
drive failure from a cruise condition. The aircraft will yaw violently to the right as tail

rotor thrust reduces. The study showed that a short pilot intervention time is critical
here to avoid sideslip excursions beyond the structural limits of the aircraft. The pilot
should reduce power to zero as quickly as possible by lowering the collective lever.
Once the yaw transients have been successfully contained, and the aircraft is in a stable
condition, the engines can be shut down and the aircraft retrimmed at an airspeed of
about 80 knots. With the Lynx, this gives about a 20% margin above the speed where
loss of yaw control is threatened. Any attempt to ﬁnd a speed–power combination
that enabled continued powered ﬂight risked a yaw breakaway which could drive the
aircraft into a ﬂat spin. Gentle turns to right and left (more stable) were possible from
the 80 knots autorotation. The pilot approaches the landing with the aircraft nose to
starboard and, in this case, raising collective to cushion touchdown yaws the nose to
port and aligns with the ﬂight path.
Reference 8.44 describes typical examples of tail rotor failure that were in the
database investigated. One such example involved a Lynx helicopter taking off on a
test ﬂight following the ﬁtting of a new tail rotor gearbox. With the aircraft in a low
hover, a ‘low power’ control failure occurred. To quote from Ref. 8.44,
As the aircraft lifted there was a slight yaw to the right which the pilot compensated
for, but by the time the aircraft was established in a 10 feet hover, a matter of only 2–3
seconds after launch, the aircraft was continuing to diverge to the right with full left
pedal applied. The pilot called out ‘full left pedal’, and the aircraft accelerated into a
right hand spot turn over which the aircrew had no control. The aircrew recalled the
AEO’s brieﬁng and reduced the MR speed (which also reduced tail rotor speed and
thrust), the yaw accelerated further, exacerbated by the fact that they were entering
the downwind arc. The words of the brieﬁng were then recalled ‘right hand turn
equals low power setting, therefore increase NR’. The speed select lever was pushed
forward to increase MR speed (and hence tail rotor speed and thrust), the yaw rate
slowed down. The aircrew regained control of the aircraft and were able to land
without further incident.
The Aircraft Engineering Ofﬁcer (AEO) referred to here had actually led the tail rotor
ﬂight and simulation programme at DERA and is the ﬁrst author of Ref. 8.43, and
hence was very familiar with tail rotor failures. He had briefed the maintenance ﬂight
aircrew on actions to take in the event of a tail rotor failure. The advice proved crucial
and the pilot’s actions averted a crash; the story is told in Ref. 8.45.
Reference 8.44 also identiﬁes a number of candidate technologies that could
mitigate the effects of tail rotor failure, e.g., warning systems, integrated with health
and usage monitoring systems, emergency drag parachutes. This is an important line
of development in the context of safety. The accident data highlight that drive failures
on most types are not very survivable. The two illustrations used to describe the failure
types show a straightforward transition from the failure through the recovery to the
landing. In practice, however, the pilot is likely to be confused initially by what has
happened (note above example where the pilot operated the speed select lever in the
wrong direction initially) and can quickly become disoriented as the aircraft not only
yaws, but also rolls and pitches, as sideslip builds up. Also, the accident/incident data
show that on several occasions the pilot has successfully recovered from the failure but
the aircraft has turned over during the landing. Tail rotor failures make undue demands
on pilot skill and attention and the way forward has to be to ensure that designs have
sufﬁciently reliable drive and control systems so that the likelihood of component

 
568
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
failure is extremely remote in the life of a ﬂeet. Reference 8.44 recommends that the
Joint Aviation Requirements be revised to provide a two-path solution to ‘closing the
regulatory gap’ in respect of tail rotor control systems. Firstly, ﬁxed-wing aircraft levels
of redundancy of ﬂight critical components are required. Secondly, where redundancy
may be impractical, ‘the design assessment should include a failure analysis to identify
all failure modes that will prevent continued safe ﬂight and landing and identiﬁcation
of the means provided to minimise the likelihood of their occurrence’.
Reference 8.44 also recommended that the ADS-33 approach of specifying failure
transients (see next section) be adopted along with the collective to yaw coupling
requirements and sideslip excursion limitations as a method of quantifying the effects
of failure. Such criteria could also form the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of
retroﬁt technologies, including contributions from the automatic ﬂight control system.
Tail rotor failures require the pilot to exercise supreme skill to survive what is, quite
simply, a loss of control situation. If ﬂying qualities degradation could be contained
within the Level 3 regime, with controllability itself not threatened, then the probability
of losing aircraft to such failures would be reduced signiﬁcantly. Time will tell how
effectively the recommendations of Ref. 8.44 are taken up by the Industry.
8.3.3
Malfunction of control – hard-over failures
A control malfunction occurs when the control surface does not move consistently
with the input, and in this section the failure corresponding to an actuator moving
‘hard-over’ to its limit is considered. The effect of such a failure in the longer term
is likely to be that the actuator is disengaged, although it does not necessarily follow
that the control function is then ‘lost’. The failure may be in a limited-authority ac-
tuator, feeding augmentation signals to the control surface in series with the pilot’s
inputs. The loss of this function is unlikely to be ﬂight critical although it may be
mission critical. For example, the loss of control augmentation may reduce the han-
dling qualities in degraded visual conditions from Level 1 to Level 3 (e.g., loss of
TRC sensor systems degrading response type to RC in a UCE = 3). The aircraft is
still controllable but should the pilot attempt any manoeuvring close to the ground,
the high risk of loss of spatial awareness would render the operation unsafe. If the
actuator forms part of the primary ﬂight control system then it would be normal to
have sufﬁcient redundancy so that a back-up system is brought into play to retain
the control function following the failure. The question then becomes how much of
a failure transient can be tolerated before the back-up system takes over? Similarly,
how much failure transient can be tolerated before a runaway augmentation function
is made safe? The transient response of the aircraft to failures therefore becomes part
of the FMEA. ADS-33 (Ref. 8.3) addresses the consequences of these transients in a
threefold context – possible loss of control, exceedance of structural limits and colli-
sion with nearby objects. Table 8.7 summarizes the requirements in terms of attitude
excursions, translational accelerations and proximity to the OFE. The hover/low-speed
requirements are based on the pilot being in a passive, hands-on state, perhaps engaged
with other mission-related tasks. The 3-s intervention time then takes account of pilot
recognition and diagnosis of the failure, before initiating the correct recovery action.
The Level 3 requirements relate to the aircraft having been disturbed about 50 ft from
its hover position before the pilot reacts. The assumption is that in such circumstances,
the aircraft would have collided with surrounding obstacles or the ground. The Level

situation.
References 8.46 and 8.47 both deal with failure transients and degraded ﬂying
qualities of tilt rotor aircraft. In Ref. 8.46, the methodology for dealing with loss,
malfunction and degradation in the development of the European Civil Tilt Rotor is
described. Reference 8.47 is concerned with the V-22 and will be returned to later in
this section. In Ref. 8.46, the up-and-away requirements for the civil tilt rotor were
expressed in terms of the transient attitude excursions following a failure, shown in
Table 8.8, with the assumption that the pilot was hands-off the controls and would
require 3.5 s to initiate recovery action (Ref. 8.48).
Degradation into Level 4 handling qualities would result from attitude transients
shown with the consequent high risk of loss of spatial awareness and hence control.
An analysis was conducted using the civil tilt rotor simulation model to establish
the handling qualities boundaries as a function of the parameters of the hard-over as
summarized in Fig. 8.40. The control surface is driven at the maximum actuation rate
to a value X1, which is then held for the so-called passivation time, after which the
surface returns to an offset value X2.
Figure 8.41 shows results for the roll angle following a failure of the left aileron
to 16◦initiated at 0.1 s. For the case shown, the aileron reached the failure limit, driven
at the maximum actuation rate, in 0.4 s. The aileron holds the hard-over position for
the passivation time of 1.5 s, after which the surface is returned to an offset value of 3◦
at the reduced rate of the back-up system. The pilot takes control at 3.5 s, applying full
right aileron and achieving this in 1 s (reduced actuation rate of 100%/s). In the example

shown, the maximum roll angle of 30◦occurred at about 3 s and the transient response
was already reducing by the time the pilot applied corrective action. In the study re-
ported in Ref. 8.46, the failure parameters in Fig. 8.40 were varied to deﬁne the handling
qualities boundaries according to Table 8.8, using the methodology typiﬁed in Fig. 8.41.
In this way the designer can use the results to establish the required safety margins in
the design that guarantee that the handling stays within the Level 1 or Level 2 regions.
Figure 8.42 shows the handling qualities regions using the two-parameter chart
of maximum aileron deﬂection versus passivation time. The results are shown for the
zero offset condition. So, for example, with a passivation time of 1.5 s, the Level 3
boundary is reached with failure amplitude of about 15◦. The methodology allows a
wide range of different scenarios to be assessed. Cases where the failed actuator is not

and aileron hard-over amplitude (Ref. 8.46)
returned to an offset can also be considered, as can cases where the failure magnitude
is limited to the authority of the in-series, stability augmentation.
The recovery control action discussed above is formulated clinically as shown in
Fig. 8.40 and with the very large number of test cases needing quantiﬁcation, off-line
production of the knowledge contained in charts like Fig. 8.42 is the only realistic
approach. The results derived from such analysis provide the ‘predicted’ handling
qualities. But, as with ﬂying qualities testing in normal conditions, piloted tests are
required to support and validate the analysis. It has become a normal practice in some
qualiﬁcation standards to require ﬂight testing to be carried out, e.g., SCAS failures in
the UK Defence Standard (Ref. 8.42), but in most cases, the risk to ﬂight safety is so
high that such testing is actually never carried out, particularly addressing the question
– what impact does the degradation have on ﬂying qualities post-failure? In Ref. 8.47,
the methodology adopted during qualiﬁcation of the V-22 ﬂying qualities is described,
wherein extensive use of piloted simulation was made to answer this question. Follow-
ing the recovery from the failure transient, it is expected that this aircraft will need to ﬂy
the equivalent of MTEs even in ﬂy-home mode, although some may be impossible to
set up. Reference 8.47 highlights the importance of maintaining the same performance
standards as when ﬂying operationally without failures. To quote from Ref. 8.47,
Relaxing task requirements can open the possibility of a very undesirable dilemma:
the severely crippled aircraft could receive HQRs that are not much worse than, or
possibly are even better than, those for the unfailed aircraft. For the precision hover
example, suppose the performance limits were relaxed from ‘hover within an area
that is X feet on each side’ to ‘don’t hit the ground’. Precision hover is typically
more difﬁcult in the simulator than in ﬂight, so Level 2 HQRs (4, 5, or 6) would not
be surprising for the unfailed aircraft performing the tight hover MTE. Artiﬁcially
opening the performance limits, to accommodate the presence of the failure, could
lead a pilot to assign a comparable – or better – HQR for what might be an almost
uncontrollable conﬁguration.

 
572
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
So, the extent of the handling degradation following system failures can be properly
measured only through a direct comparison with the unfailed aircraft, using both pre-
dictive (off-line) and assignment (pilot assessment) methods.
It is also important to establish the pilot’s impressions of the transient effect of
the failure and ability to recover, aspects not covered by a handling rating per se. The
failure rating scale developed by Hindson, Eshow and Schroeder (Ref. 8.49) in support

of the development of an experimental ﬂy-by-wire helicopter was modiﬁed in the V-22
study, and this version is reproduced here as Fig. 8.43. The essential modiﬁcations
relative to the original Ref. 8.49 scale were ﬁrstly the nature of the questions on the
left-hand side; positive answers moved up the scale, as in the Cooper–Harper handling
qualities scale. Secondly, the exceedances in failure categories A to F were referred
to the safe ﬂight envelope (SFE) rather than the OFE, and thus to effectively maintain
Level 2 handling qualities.
Pilots rate two aspects of the failure using Fig. 8.43 – the effect of the failure
itself and the consequent ability to recover to a safe equilibrium state. Failure ratings
(FR) A to E would be regarded as tolerable, F to G as intolerable, with a marginal
recovery capability, while a rating of H means there is ‘no possibility of averting a
catastrophe’. In the programme to develop the European civil tilt rotor this methodology
has been extended to produce an integrated classiﬁcation of failures as illustrated in
Fig. 8.44 (Ref. 8.50) and is itself an extension of that adopted in the development
and certiﬁcation of the NH-90 helicopter. The integration brings together the failure
category concept (minor-catastrophic), the FR and the HQR. In Fig. 8.44, the OFE
exceedance requirements were maintained corresponding to failures A to E rather than
the SFE modiﬁcation in Ref. 8.47. We can see that a ‘minor’ failure that elicits an FR
Fig. 8.44 Integrated classiﬁcation of failures

 
574
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
of A or B results in the aircraft maintaining its Level 1 handling qualities. If the ratings
degrade to C or D, the aircraft falls into the Level 2 category. Major failures correspond
to degradations to Level 3 handling qualities while Hazardous or Catastrophic failures
correspond to the aircraft being ‘thrown into’ the Level 4 region where loss of control
is threatened.
The integration is considered to offer an important new framework for relating
the impact of ﬂight system failures on ﬂight handling qualities, within which engineers
and pilots can develop and qualify systems that are safe.
As discussed above, a malfunction can often lead to a loss of control function,
but we need now to consider the third failure type where the control function is still
operating but with degraded performance.
8.3.4
Degradation of control function – actuator rate limiting
Degradation in performance of a control function typically occurs when the power
supply to a control surface actuator, mechanical or electrical, fails in some way. With the
exception of some very small types, most helicopters feature powered control systems.
The pilot moves the cockpit inceptors, and through a system of rods, bell-cranks,
levers and pulleys (or computers and electrical signalling in a ﬂy-by-wire system)
the movement is transmitted to the input side of a hydraulic (or electro-mechanical)
actuator. The output side of the actuator is connected to the non-rotating face of the
rotor swashplate, which can be tilted or raised/lowered, transmitting signals through
the rotating face of the swashplate and through the mechanical pitch link rods to the
rotor blades. Three actuators are required on the main rotor to provide collective pitch,
longitudinal cyclic and lateral cyclic pitch. The tail rotor normally requires only a
collective pitch actuator. The high-reliability level required for rotor controls is usually
achieved, ‘below the swashplate’, through redundancy of the mechanical or electrical
actuation system. A dual-redundant hydraulic actuator would normally be supplied
by two hydraulic systems, each providing 50% of the power. Failure of one of the
supplies results in a degradation of performance, such that the maximum velocity
and acceleration at which the control surface can be moved are reduced. The extent
of the reduction depends on the pilot’s control inputs, since the same power system
is typically driving collective and cyclic, but a straight comparison before and after
failure would normally show a corresponding 50% reduction in maximum rate. This
rather simple assumption is being used to establish the actuation power requirements
in the preliminary design of the European civil tilt rotor aircraft as reported in Ref.
8.46. Degradation in the ‘predicted’ handling qualities, e.g., attitude bandwidth and
quickness, can be derived from off-line analysis of the nonlinear simulation of the
aircraft and its systems. The actuation rate at which the predicted handling falls into the
Level 3 region establishes a minimum acceptable value corresponding to the transition
from minor to major failure category (Fig. 8.44). Because it is likely that the predicted
handling for several parameters is likely to degrade at the same time in this scenario,
it is especially important to check the predictions by carrying out piloted tests using
operational MTEs. The importance of this requirement is emphasized in Ref. 8.47,
where the point is made that anything less than the same performance requirements
as demanded in the MTEs for normal operational ﬂight would lead to pilots relaxing
their control strategy and consequently not really experiencing the adverse effects of
degradation. While this might be possible in some or even most conditions, ﬂight

through heavy turbulence, recovering to a moving deck or a conﬁned area in poor
visibility may be unavoidable, hence some assessment of the likely consequences
needs to be conducted.
Figure 8.45, from Ref. 8.46, captures this point perfectly. The data show results
for two test pilots ﬂying a tilt rotor aircraft in a 90◦hover-turn manoeuvre to the ADS-
33 GVE performance standards. The actuation rate for the yaw control function, in this
case provided by differential longitudinal cyclic pitch, was reduced incrementally until
Level 3 ratings were awarded. The case shown corresponds to a reduced cyclic pitch
rate of 3◦/s. It can be seen that Pilot B ﬂew the manoeuvre with an initial step control
input, allowing the aircraft to slow gradually to the required heading with minimal
closed-loop action. Pilot A, on the other hand, attempted to stop the yaw rate with
a more abrupt input but immediately entered a pilot-induced oscillation. Over about
10 s the oscillatory pedal inputs increased to the stops with yaw rate building up to
greater than 20◦/s. The rate limiting on the cyclic pitch (differential longitudinal cyclic
provides yaw control in hover) can be seen clearly in the lower-right ﬁgure. Pilot B
returned an HQR 4 for this case, the same rating that both pilots had returned for the
case with no rate limiting. Pilot B had continued to adapt his strategy as the system
performance degraded to ﬂy the task with moderate levels of compensation. Pilot A,
with each new conﬁguration, initially attempted the manoeuvre with a similar strategy,
deliberately to focus on changes in handling. For the case shown, the pilot returned
an HQR of 10 on the basis that he had to stop ﬂying the aircraft (get ‘out-of-the-
loop’) for several seconds. The aircraft had not, however, drifted outside the adequate
performance limits on position and bank, only yaw angle, and arguably, a Level 3 rating
would have been more appropriate. However, the pilot was holding right pedal on the
stops for more than 5 s to bring the aircraft onto heading before coming out of the loop

 
576
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
and his impression was that he had, indeed, lost control. The rate limit on longitudinal
cyclic was set at 4◦/s, a very similar value to that deﬁned for pitch control in the accel–
decel manoeuvre. The full power actuation rate authority was actually set at 10◦/s
in this preliminary design study, 2.5 times the rate at which the Level 2/3 boundary
had been predicted, hence giving an additional margin of safety for compensation in
harsher environmental conditions.
Studying the effects of system failure brings home the importance and associated
cost of safety in aviation, by far the safest sector in the transport industry. Ensuring
that the effects of ﬂight system loss, malfunction or degradation do not lead to a
worsening of handling beyond Level 2 provides a major contribution to this safety.
Players in this aspect of safety include regulatory bodies, requirements writers, design
engineers, manufacturers, certiﬁcation agencies, operators, maintenance engineers,
training organizations and the pilots themselves; in other words, practically the whole
aerospace community is involved. Nothing less than a total commitment to safety by
the whole community will lead to an eradication of accidents resulting from system
failures.
This brings us to the third situation where an otherwise Level 1 aircraft can
be literally thrown into a degraded condition – by encountering severe atmospheric
disturbances.
8.4
Encounters with Atmospheric Disturbances
To a ﬁrst, albeit rather crude, approximation, the response of a helicopter to an atmo-
spheric disturbance can be measured in terms of the force and moment derivatives
discussed in Chapters 1, 4 and 5 of this book. In Chapter 1, the heave response to a
vertical gust was touched on, and expressions for the contributing derivative Zw were
then developed in Chapter 4. The discussion was extended in Section 5.4 to the mod-
elling of atmospheric disturbances and the subsequent ride qualities. Heave response
tends to dominate the concern because the rotor is the dominant lifting component on
a helicopter. As the forward velocity increases, the energy of the ‘gust response’ is
absorbed more and more by the vibratory loading, since this dominates the component
of lift proportional to forward speed. The heave response derivative, Zw, becomes
asymptotic to the expression −ρ a0 (R)
4 ℓb
as velocity increases (see eqn 5.79). This rep-
resents an approximation to the initial vertical bump when ﬂying into a vertical gust
and is proportional to rotor blade tip speed and inversely proportional to blade load-
ing (ℓb). In comparison, as a ﬁxed-wing aircraft ﬂies faster, the product of dynamic

2 ℓw ) and inversely proportional to wing loading (ℓw). The charts and tables of
derivatives at the end of Chapter 4 give a ‘feel’ for the magnitude of the gust response;
a typical helicopter has a value of Zw of about 1 m/s2 per m/s at high speed, giving a
1-g bump when entering a vertical gust of magnitude about 10 m/s. On entering such
a gust the aircraft would be climbing at 6.3 m/s after 1 s (t63% = −1
Zw ) and would
continue climbing, approaching 10 m/s asymptotically. Similarly, the response to ﬂight
through a variable gust ﬁeld can be approximated by the aerodynamic components of
the damping derivatives L p and Mq (the gyroscopic components in expressions like
eqns 4.86–4.89 are not included, only the aerodynamic terms), assuming the gust ﬁeld
can be approximated by a linear variation across the rotor disc. Linear approximations

have been used extensively by the ﬁxed-wing community to analyze and quantify the
gust response of aircraft, and similar methods are available and used in helicopter
design.
Very strong atmospheric disturbances, where linear models are questionable,
should be avoided in operations where possible. However, there are some situations
where a helicopter has to be ﬂown through a vortex-infested, swirling ﬂow-ﬁeld to
reach its landing site. The helicopter, recovering to a ship or helideck, having to ﬂy
through the airwake from the superstructure presents such an example. In Ref. 8.7
(see also Refs 8.51 and 8.52), the ship airwake was described as the ‘invisible enemy’
by virtue of the fact that a pilot is very vulnerable to the degraded handling qualities
arising from the effects of the unseen, unsteady and swirling vortical ﬂow structures
in the lee of a ship’s superstructure, which commonly is where the helicopter landing
deck is situated. Over the decade since the publication of the ﬁrst edition of this book
a considerable amount of research, typiﬁed by that reported in Refs 8.51 and 8.52,
has been conducted to develop modelling and simulation capabilities able to predict
the ship–helicopter operating limits (SHOLs) in the presence of the ship’s airwake.
The kind of problem faced by operators is shown in the example of the Royal Navy’s
Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), which has two landing spots, spot 1 on the port side
close to the hangar and spot 2 on the starboard side to the aft of the ﬂight deck. The
difference in the SHOLs for spots 1 and 2 is compared with the original requirement
during procurement in Fig. 8.46 (Ref. 8.51). The SHOL is the shaded area on the polar

plot of relative wind speed and direction. Although both are restricted, the SHOL for
spot 1 makes it almost unusable in most wind-over-deck conditions. The problem is
caused by the combination of the helicopter operating close to the hangar face at low
heights and the airwake created by the geometry of the ship, the hangar and the ﬂight
deck. Mean and unsteady downwash velocity components are so high in this region
that the pilot has difﬁculty taking off and hovering.
The SHOL is deﬁned to allow operations to be conducted safely in the presence
of disturbed atmospheric conditions and the additional difﬁculties associated with ship
motion and degraded visibility. For the main discussion in this section of the chapter,
we turn to a situation where operating limits are more difﬁcult to deﬁne – the effect of
ﬁxed-wing aircraft trailing vortices on helicopter handling qualities.
8.4.1
Helicopter response to aircraft vortex wakes
A key part in the process of assessing the response of helicopters to the vortices of ﬁxed-
wing aircraft is the development of severity criteria for the encounters. Severity criteria
based on handling qualities analysis link directly with the central thrust of this book.
The results presented here are drawn from the author’s research with colleagues (Ref.
8.53–8.56), which was initially aimed at developing safety cases for the positioning of
ﬁnal approach and take-off areas (FATO) at airports. The work has since expanded to
inform the development of operating procedures for runway-independent aircraft (Ref.
8.56), hence assisting the timely expansion of vertical ﬂight aircraft operations, both
helicopters and tilt rotor aircraft, to and from busy hubs.
The wake vortex
Wake vortices are an extension of the so-called bound vorticity of a lifting surface,
shed from the wing tips as distinct vortex structures and rolling up with the span-wise
shed vorticity into a counter-rotating pair. The resulting ﬂow structure descends in
the mean downwash from the wing, moves laterally with any horizontal wind and
eventually breaks up as the inner core, kept together almost as a solid body by strong
viscous forces, becomes unstable. Both ﬁxed- and rotary-wing aircraft leave a vortex
wake behind, dissipating the energy required to maintain the aircraft aloft. Figure 8.47
illustrates the ﬂow topology in the tip vortex.
The velocity in the vortex core increases linearly with radial location from the
centre, the ﬂuid rotating effectively as a solid body. The ﬂow here is ‘rotational’ so that
elements of ﬂuid rotate as they are drawn around in a circular pattern (see the white
triangular ﬂuid elements in Fig. 8.47). Outside the core, the ﬂow is largely irrotational
and the velocity decreases with distance from the core centre. An element of ﬂuid would
be drawn into the vortex from the surroundings, and would move toward the centre
along a spiralling streamline, without rotation (the decreasing velocity with radius
allows this to happen – see the grey ﬂuid elements in Fig. 8.47) until reaching the outer
edge of the core. The manner in which the rotational core is fed with irrotational ﬂuid
and the 3-dimensional development of the vortex, both radially and streamwise, has
been the subject of aviation research for decades (see Ref. 8.57 for ‘. . . a consolidated
European view on the current status of knowledge of the nature and characteristics
of aircraft wakes . . .’). For the purposes of this analysis a rather simple model of the
vortex structure is used and will be described following an appraisal of the severity
criteria in handling qualities terms.

Hazard severity criteria
The deﬁnition of a hazard set out in the SAE’s Aerospace Recommended Practice
ARP4761 (Ref. 8.40) is ‘a potentially unsafe condition resulting from failures, mal-
functions, external events, errors or a combination thereof’. In busy airspace, aircraft
are regularly exposed to the risk of experiencing unsafe conditions through wake-vortex

 
580
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
encounters (Ref. 8.58). Separation is designed to minimize this risk, but the risk is ever
present, and its ‘acceptability’ is a function of the severity of the disturbance and the
probability of occurrence. Generally, severe disturbances must be improbable and as
the level of severity decreases, the frequency of occurrence can increase for the same
risk. This critical relationship underpins aviation safety and system design.
There are two main concerns and related questions regarding disturbance severity:
(a)
Does the disturbed aircraft have sufﬁcient control margin for the pilot to overcome
the disturbance?
(b)
Can the disturbance transient lead to an unsafe ﬂight condition if not checked within
a reasonable pilot intervention time, in terms of collision with surfaces, exceedance
of ﬂight envelope, risk of pilot disorientation or loss of control?
The detailed answers to these questions lie in understanding the nature of the
response of the aircraft to a vortex disturbance. In handling qualities terms, the response
characteristics of immediate interest relate to the moderate to large amplitude criteria –
quickness and control power (see Chapter 6). To recap, the control power is the amount
of response achievable with the available control margin; the response quickness is the
ratio of peak attitude rate to attitude change in a discrete attitude change manoeuvre.
Quickness is inversely related to the time to change attitude and will be affected by
roll/pitch damping, actuator limits and, to an extent, static stability effects, e.g., how
much and in what sense sideslip or incidence changes occur during the manoeuvre.
The sufﬁciency of attitude control margins in terms of quickness (for pitch ma-
noeuvres up to 30◦, roll up to 60◦) and control power (for pitch manoeuvres >30◦, roll
>60◦) is of primary concern. Reference 8.53 highlighted that the initial disturbance
to an encounter with a vortex, aligned in the same direction as the helicopter (parallel
encounter), will be in pitch. The non-uniform (lateral) incidence distribution imposed
on the rotor disc by the vortex in a parallel encounter has a similar effect to the ap-
plication of longitudinal cyclic pitch, the ﬂapping response occurring 90◦later to give
pitch up/down moments. This is in contrast to the rolling moment disturbance expe-
rienced by ﬁxed-wing aircraft following a parallel encounter. Figures 8.48 and 8.49
show the MTE-dependent pitch axis quickness and control power criteria boundaries
for low-speed/hover tasks according to ADS-33 (Ref. 8.3, also Section 6.4).
A helicopter ﬂying into the irrotational ‘tail’ of the vortex wake will experience
a more uniform incidence distribution across the rotor disc, leading to thrust and
power changes. In the heave axis, the corresponding Level 1 response criteria are
deﬁned in terms of control power (minimum of 160 ft/min, 1.5 s after initiation of
rapid displacement of collective control from trim) and vertical rate time constant
(t63% < 5 s). These correspond approximately to a hover rate of climb performance of
650 ft/min with a 5% thrust margin. Level 2 performance is obtained with a minimum
climb rate of 55 ft/min and Level 3 with 40 ft/min. These values are relatively low
and it can be appreciated that a general downwash of magnitude about 10 ft/s would
nearly swamp the Level 1 performance margin. An aircraft should possess at least the
Level 1 performance standards described above for the pilot to be able to ﬂy moderately
aggressive low-speed manoeuvres with precision and low compensation. The question
arises as to whether an aircraft designed to meet the ADS-33 performance standards
will have sufﬁcient margin for the pilot to overcome the effects of a vortex encounter.
The second issue listed above concerns the aircraft motion transients in response to the
vortex encounter, and this will be addressed using the same methodology described for

control system failures. ADS-33 sets requirements for the response to system failure
transients in the form of Table 8.7 presented earlier in this chapter.
The focus in the study described in Ref. 8.55 was the severity of encounters for
rotorcraft ﬂying in hover and low speed (<45 knots), including low-speed climbs.
The main concern is with the ﬁrst column in Table 8.7, and particularly the Level 2/3
boundary, on the basis that this differentiates between safe and unsafe conditions. The
Level 2/3 boundary corresponds to a transient that would result in a displacement of
the aircraft of about 20 ft (6.1 m), with a velocity of about 20 ft/s (6.1 m/s) and angular
rate of 10◦/s, after 3 s. A question that arises when expressing the encounter transients
using these criteria is – what should the pilot intervention time be? The 3 s in ADS-33
corresponds to a scenario of a single pilot attending to other mission duties while in
hover with auto-hover engaged. In the UK Defence Standard (Ref. 8.42) this would
correspond to passive hands-on operation. For attentive hands-on operation, the pilot
response time is 1.5 s according to Ref. 8.42, following control system failures. In the
US civil certiﬁcation standards (Ref. 8.59) the response time (for hover operations)
is set at the normal pilot recognition time (0.5 s). However, a strong argument could
be made for increasing this to 1.5 s in divided-attention situations or when operating
with auto-hover engaged.
To address the two questions posed above, a series of piloted simulation trials
using the facility at The University of Liverpool (see Appendix 8A) was carried out.
The modelling and simulation environment used in the studies was FLIGHTLAB and
the HELIFLIGHT motion simulator (Ref. 8.60). The two aircraft featured in the study
were the Westland Lynx and the FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft (FGR), conﬁgured
as a UH-60 type helicopter. Key conﬁguration parameters of the two aircraft are given
in Table 8.9.

parameters are also reasonably well predicted by this modelling standard. A variety
of empirical models have been used to describe the tangential velocity proﬁle of a tip
vortex. Two commonly used examples are the ‘Dispersion’ model (Ref. 8.61) and the
‘Burnham’ model (Refs 8.62, 8.63); the Dispersion model takes the form
VT (r) =
 r
2 π (r2 + r2c )
(8.49)
where VT (r) is the tangential velocity at a distance r from the vortex core, rc is the core
radius (deﬁned as the distance from the centre of the vortex to the peak of the tangential
velocity) and  is the total circulation around the vortex (with units of m2−s−1).
The Burnham model takes the form
VT (r) = Vc (1 + ln(r/rc))
r/rc
,
|r| > rc
VT (r) = Vc (r/rc),
|r| ≤rc
(8.50)
where VT (r) and rc are as deﬁned previously, and Vc is the peak velocity, i.e., the value
of VT (r) at the edge of the rotational core, r = rc. These vortex models are compared
to LIDAR (Coherent Laser Radar) measurements of the tangential velocities in the
(young) vortex wake of a Boeing 747 in Fig. 8.50 (Ref. 8.54). A best ﬁt was obtained
for the velocity proﬁles of several aircraft types, and the resulting parameters are
given in Table 8.10.

As discussed in Ref. 8.54, the parameter values for the larger aircraft (Boeing
747, Airbus A340) should be reliable, but the maximum velocities for the medium
twin engine aircraft (Boeing 757, Airbus A310) are estimates, which will be equal to
or less than the true value, as the LIDAR sensitivity was insufﬁcient to detect the peak.
In the study, the encounters occur when the vortex is at the (full) strength. Vortices
do decay with time and the decay rate is a function of prevailing wind, humidity and
wing ﬂap conﬁguration. The results presented therefore probably represent worse-
case scenarios and the encounter effects in a real scenario may differ considerably.
Key assumptions are that the vortex ﬂow-ﬁeld is unaffected by the rotorcraft and is
superimposed on the quasi-steady incidence changes on the rotor. These assumptions
are clearly open to question, but there is little reliable information on the interactional
effects and they are likely to be very complex, particularly if the rotor blade cuts through
the vortex core.
The velocity ﬁeld of a Boeing 747 vortex when centred at the rotor hub is sketched
in Fig. 8.51. Note that, at the rotor tips, the downwash/upwash is still considerable

(12 m/s, 39 ft/s), and with a rotor tip speed of about 220 m/s (720 ft/s) the perturba-
tion in incidence is approximately 3◦. This cyclic variation in incidence will result in
longitudinal, forward, ﬂapping of the rotor blades and a nose-down pitch moment for
the anti-clockwise rotors on the Lynx and FGR.
A similar rationale can be applied to the perturbations in heave velocity. In this
case the greatest disturbances are experienced when the rotorcraft is in the vortex tail,
close to the core. The cyclic stick and collective lever margins available to the pilot to
negate the effects of the vortex depend on trim position of the controls.
The technique of constrained simulation was used extensively in the study de-
scribed in Refs 8.53–8.55 to ensure that the rotorcraft–vortex encounters have pre-
dictable initial conditions. Also, it proved more convenient and tractable to ﬁx the
position of the vortex in space and to move the aircraft laterally at different encounter
velocities through the tails and core. As described in Ref. 8.53, with unconstrained
simulations it was found that as the vortex approached the aircraft at the same height
the aircraft would be lifted up in the approaching tail of the vortex and carried over the
top and down in the following tail, as shown in Fig. 8.52.
In contrast, Fig. 8.53 illustrates the case when the initial position of the helicopter
was such that an encounter with the vortex core was forced to occur. This scenario is not
unrealistic as the vortex wakes tend to remain at about a semi-span (of the ﬁxed-wing
aircraft) above the ground. Hence, to avoid the complications of having to set different
initial conditions for the different helicopters, vortex wakes and encounter speeds and
to ensure that worst-case scenarios are explored, the constrained simulation approach
was adopted. The initial condition was with the rotorcraft positioned 100 ft (∼30 m)

to the port side of the (port wing) vortex, simulating an encounter with a vortex shed
from an aircraft taking off to starboard of the rotorcraft.
In the following section, results are presented for two cases: (i) with constrained
vertical/forward motion and heading to explore pitch attitude perturbations as the
core is encountered and (ii) with constrained attitude, heading and forward motion to
explore heave perturbations as the tails are traversed. Both Lynx and FGR have been
investigated, with and without their SCAS engaged, although only results with SCAS-
on are presented as this will be the normal conﬁguration. Encounters with the vortex
wake of the Boeing 747 are shown; Ref. 8.54 presents comparisons of encounters with
the different aircraft mentioned in Table 8.10.
Analysis of encounters – attitude response
Figures 8.54–8.57 show aspects of the helicopter attitude response to a vortex encounter
with no pilot recovery inputs. Figures 8.54 and 8.55 show the pitch attitude and rate
response of the rotorcraft for three vortex encounter speeds: 5, 10 and 20 ft/s (∼1.5,
3 and 6 m/s). The attitude transients increase as vortex-passing speed decreases as
expected, since the aircraft is exposed to the vortex ﬂow-ﬁeld for longer. Note that
the attitude hold system in the Lynx SCAS returns the aircraft to the hover attitude
after the passage of the vortex, contrasting with the rate-damping SCAS in the FGR,
which leaves the aircraft in a disturbed attitude state. Both rotorcraft initially pitch up
as they pass through the advancing tail of the vortex induced by the lateral distribution
of inﬂow through the rotor disc. As the rotor hub encounters the vortex core, the lateral
inﬂow distribution reverses, leading to a much larger ﬂapping and nose-down pitching
moment. The attitude perturbations for the 10 and 20 ft/s encounters are approximately
30 and 20◦, respectively, in 3–4 s, similar for both aircraft, while the slower encounter
results in a pitch of nearly 40◦in 5 s for the Lynx and more than 50◦in 10 s for the FGR.
The pitching moment and corresponding accelerations are much higher on the
Lynx with its hingeless rotor system, but the FGR is pitched to the larger attitude
−

because the increased diameter rotor is in the vortex for about 30% longer. The pitch
response would be reversed for clockwise rotors (e.g., Eurocopter Super Puma).
The attitude responses are plotted on the pitch quickness charts in Figs 8.55 and
8.56. On each chart the maximum quickness is also plotted as a function of attitude
derived from applying high-amplitude pulse inputs with varying duration. The ADS-33
handling qualities boundaries are also included.
Both aircraft have signiﬁcant quickness margin (40–100%) to overcome the vor-
tex, up to the 30◦pitch attitude change (limit set in the ADS manoeuvre perfor-
mance). Also, just meeting the ADS-33 minimum quickness requirements for tracking
tasks (Level 1/2 boundary) gives a signiﬁcant response margin (50–100%) for attitude
changes up to 30◦. It should be recognized that the pitch rates are transient and the
nature of encounters is such that the pilot should need to apply compensatory control
inputs only momentarily. This is not to say that the transient disturbance is not a se-
rious handling ‘problem’ for the pilot. Such encounters are most likely to occur close
to airports, and Ref. 8.56 highlights the result that pilots would most likely abort an
approach following such upsets. The results also indicate that an aircraft that just met
the minimum Level 1/2 quickness requirements for general MTEs would have wholly
inadequate control for counteracting the effects of a vortex encounter. As with control
system failures, quantifying response in terms of ﬂight-handling qualities parameters
provides a description of severity that links with safety and provides the basis for safety
cases. While the attitude response is important, the vertical disturbance can be even
more serious.
Analysis of encounters – vertical response
The vertical motions of the rotorcraft during the vortex encounters are illustrated in Fig.
8.58 (height), Fig. 8.59 (height rate) and Fig. 8.60 (vertical acceleration). The effects
of SCAS are negligible in most cases; hence only SCAS-off results are presented.
An exception is the vertical acceleration response of the Lynx, which has a feedback
loop from acceleration to collective to improve high-speed stability characteristics.

The acceleration peaks in Fig. 8.60 would be reduced by 20% with SCAS engaged on

An important point to take into account when interpreting these data is that the
initial trim of both aircraft is 100 ft to port of the clockwise-rotating vortex. The
collective pitch is therefore lower than the hover value by an amount depending on the
rotorspeed and rotor solidity. The ﬁxed collective setting then results in a descent rate in

the receding vortex tail, which is higher than that corresponding to the hover collective
setting. For the Lynx, the reference rate of descent (i.e., the descent rate corresponding
to the decreased collective at the initial condition) is about 900 ft/min and for the FGR
about 1200 ft/min.
Approaching the vortex core the rotorcraft are lifted up to a maximum rate of
climb of about 500 ft/min, followed by a reversal to a rapid descent rate of more than
2500 ft/min (more than 1500 ft/min relative to reference rate of descent noted in the
previous paragraph). The slower the encounter, the greater time is spent in the vortex
wakes and the larger height loss. At 20 ft/s encounter, 100 ft is lost in about 3 s; at 10 ft/s,
100 ft in 5 s; at 5 ft/s, 100 ft in about 8 s. The lower disc loading on the FGR results in
larger peak accelerations and higher descent rates; at the fastest encounter of 20 ft/s, a
bump of about −0.5 g is experienced within 3 s of a small positive bump. The descent
rates induced in the vortex tail (1100 ft/min – Lynx; 2000 ft/min – FGR, again, relative
to reference) are signiﬁcantly higher than the 650 ft/min minimum requirement for
Level 1 performance deﬁned in ADS-33. This suggests that thrust margins of 10–15%
would be required to enable a pilot to completely counteract the effects of a vortex
encounter.
Handling qualities criteria provide a natural framework within which to set per-
formance margins and quantify severity during upsets caused by vortex encounters.
The preceding analysis has demonstrated that an aircraft satisfying minimum Level 1
(tracking) attitude quickness and (aggressive manoeuvring) control power performance
should have sufﬁcient control margin to overcome the effects of a full-strength vortex.
Satisfying the normal minimum performance requirements for general MTEs will not
provide an adequate margin, however. A rate SCAS signiﬁcantly reduces the distur-
bance, while the addition of the attitude hold function (Lynx) returns the aircraft to the
hover attitude, further reducing the upset. In terms of vertical performance, the mini-
mum Level 1 standard, when translated into a margin for climb performance, is insufﬁ-
cient by a signiﬁcant margin to overcome the effects of the downwash in the vortex tail.

The performance criteria indicate what is ultimately achievable, but further insight
can be gained by comparing the severity of the disturbance against the ADS-33 criteria
for the transient response following failures.
8.4.2
Severity of transient response
Referring back to Table 8.7, showing the limits on attitudes and accelerations following
a failure, the questions asked are – can this approach also apply to the response caused
by external disturbances and are the same standards applicable? Table 8.11 shows the
approximate pitch attitude transients at 3 s following the maximum pitch-up attitude.
The values represent the changes in attitude from the maximum pitch-up rather than
the initial pitch. This method leads to signiﬁcantly greater transients in some cases but
is justiﬁed because although the pilot would not be expected to allow the aircraft to
pitch, he/she would have to apply forward cyclic to maintain the hover, which would
exacerbate the pitch-down as the vortex core was crossed. The italicized numbers in
Table 8.11 correspond to the cases where the Level 3 boundary is exceeded. SCAS
disengaged results are also shown to illustrate the power of the SCAS and its positive
impact on safety.
Similarly, Table 8.12 lists the 3-s perturbations in vertical acceleration. Only
SCAS-off data are included; the SCAS does not change the level. In this case the
reference conditions are the points where the larger negative bump begins (e.g., at 17.5
s for the FGR with the 5 ft/s crossing, Fig. 8.60).
If the pilot intervention time had been set at 1.5 s, the perturbations would have
reduced to less than 50% of those in Tables 8.11 and 8.12 (with the possible exception
of some SCAS-off cases); the italic cases would then be within the Level 3 boundary

Handling qualities Level 3 – hazard category MAJOR (safety of ﬂight compromised;
signiﬁcant reduction in safety margins or increase in crew workload)
r
Handling qualities Level >3 – hazard category HAZARDOUS (safety of ﬂight
compromised; large reduction in safety margin)
From this classiﬁcation, and without considering control margins, it can be deduced
that with a 3-s pilot intervention time the vortex encounter is HAZARDOUS, and with
a 1.5-s intervention time the hazard category of the encounter is MAJOR. Both relate to
the disturbance-induced ﬂight path variations and the resulting risk of disorientation or
loss of control. It should be noted that the largest attitude and acceleration changes occur
after the initial pitch-up or negative bump. It could be argued that the pilot may at this
stage be aware of the vortex encounter and the normal, full-attention, 0.5-s intervention
time is more appropriate. The hazard category may then reduce to MINOR.
The effect of intervention time on the severity of the response can be investigated
with the aid of the upset severity rating (USR) scale shown in Fig. 8.61. This scale is
based on the pilot rating scale for failure transients described in Ref. 8.49 and already
presented in modiﬁed form in Fig. 8.43. In summary, ratings A to E indicate tolerable
severity and are awarded for cases where the disturbed excursions range from minimal,
requiring no corrective action, to very objectionable, requiring immediate and intense
pilot effort. For cases A through E, safety of ﬂight is judged not to be compromised,
and the hazard category is MINOR. Safety of ﬂight is compromised with ratings of F
through G, with excursions leading to possible encounter with obstacles, unintentional
landing or exceedance of ﬂight envelope limits; recovery is marginal and the hazard
category is MAJOR (F) or HAZARDOUS (G). A rating of H means that the pilot
judged recovery to be impossible with the hazard category CATASTROPHIC.
Figure 8.62 shows results from simulation trials at Liverpool with the FGR, with
power, collective and vertical motion changes as the vortex is traversed at a nominal
10 ft/s. Also shown is the lateral track as a function of time with the core and outer
boundaries indicated. The pilot reduces collective as the rotor enters the upwash of the
advancing tail. The pilot is able to maintain height within ±10 ft during this phase of
ﬂight and reduces collective to command a very low engine torque, less than 20% of the
hover setting. At about 25 s the vortex core is passed and as the helicopter moves into
the downwash of the retreating tail, a descent rate of more than 1000 ft/min builds up
in about 5 s, arrested by the pilot applying signiﬁcantly more than the 106% transient
torque limit. This transient overtorque limited the height loss to about 50 ft. Height and
collective excursions when the helicopter experiences the downwash in the vortex tail
are double those during the ‘upwash’ phase. The effect of the helicopter being rolled
and accelerated to starboard during the core encounter, i.e., pushed out of the vortex,
can be seen in the increased slope of the lateral position trace. An HQR of 7 and USR
of F (MAJOR) were awarded for this case on the grounds that the torque limit was
exceeded and the height excursion was beyond the adequate boundary of ±30 ft.
The ability to counteract the vertical motion induced by the vortex clearly depends
on the available power and thrust margin. As shown in Fig. 8.62, the FGR was being
ﬂown with a power margin of more than 30%, reinforcing the point made earlier that the

ADS-33 minimum standards for Level 1 performance margins in hover are insufﬁcient
in this respect. Another observation made by pilots during the trials related to the large
changes in roll and yaw attitude during the encounter. Yaw motion can be induced by
the lateral velocities in the lower and upper portions of the vortex. If the aircraft yaws
by 90◦then the pitch effects described earlier would transform into roll.
The solution to the wake vortex problem for runway-dependent aircraft approach-
ing and departing along similar trajectories is to deﬁne minimum longitudinal sepa-
ration distances. The severity of encounters can be catastrophic close to the ground,
but the risk is lowered to an acceptable level by reducing the probability of occurrence
through separation. When considering runway-independent aircraft and the associated

concept of simultaneous, non-interfering operations (SNIOps), the problem is more
complex and lateral separation of approach and departure ﬂight paths also becomes a
major issue. At any particular location, the positioning of a helicopter ﬁnal approach
and landing area can be optimized on the basis of prevailing winds and atmospheric
conditions, ﬁxed-wing aircraft landing and take-off patterns and the nature of the trafﬁc
at any particular time. Whether it will ever be acceptable to operate with this ﬂexibility
is another question, but the risk certainly needs to be carefully managed through ﬂight
path constraints and positioning of the terminal area ground operations. The most con-
cerning result is the potential loss of height due to encounters with the downwash side
of a vortex. Reference 8.64 documents an accident following a suspected encounter
of a light helicopter with a vortex, and it was the vertical motion of the aircraft that
most disturbed the crew prior to the loss of control and crash. Helicopters typically
operate with fairly low power/thrust margins in hover (<10%). Although these may
satisfy the handling standards for vertical performance, the results of both off-line and
piloted simulations show that they may be wholly inadequate to overcome the effects
of a vortex encounter. The situation will improve when some forward velocity has been
gained and also when the helicopter has a rate of climb.

Chapter Review
In this chapter some of the ways in which handling qualities can degrade have been
discussed, and methodologies for taking them into account are outlined. What should
be clear to the reader from the ideas and results presented is that the pilot’s task
can become very difﬁcult if the visual cues degrade, if ﬂight systems fail or when
strong atmospheric disturbances are encountered; the risk to safety and the likelihood
of an accident increase in such situations. If such degradations happen quickly and
are unforeseen, taking the pilot by surprise, then the risk further increases. With a
good understanding of the degrading mechanisms, appropriate design criteria, more
stringent operational procedures and the availability of safety-related technologies, for
both new and old aircraft, there seems to be no good reason, apart from cost, why
all existing and new helicopters cannot be made more ‘accident proof’. At the time
of writing, this goal is being pursued in an international initiative, stimulated partly
by the revelations of a comprehensive analysis of US civil helicopter accidents over
a 40-year period by Harris et al. (Ref. 8.65), summarized in the 2006 AHS Nikolsky
Lecture (Ref. 8.66) – No Accidents – That’s the Objective. In the 40-year period from
1964, the US civil helicopter accident rate per 100 000 ﬂying hours decreased from 65
in 1966 to 11 in 2004; these data relate to a total number of accidents i.e., 10 410 in the
period, where nearly 2700 people lost their lives. The accident rate per 1000 aircraft
has also decreased substantially over this period – 120 in 1964 to 12 in 2005. However,
the helicopter accident rate is still about an order of magnitude greater than the ﬁxed-
wing aircraft accident rate. Challenging the oft-made point that safety improvements
are uneconomical, Harris presents data showing that the cost of one accident is about
1 million US dollars, so that the total cost to the Industry over the 40-year period has
been about 11 billion US dollars. More than three quarters of this relates to insurance
claims.
Figure 8.63 summarizes the distribution of US civil rotorcraft accidents presented
by Harris (Ref. 8.66). The data show that loss of control is a growing problem; with
1114 in total, less than 10% were in this category in 1964 but greater than 20% in 2005,

making loss of control equal the number one contributor to accidents, alongside loss of
engine power. In-ﬂight collision with objects (including wires, poles, trees, but not the
surface) has reduced as a cause, but a total of 1322 accidents in this category over the
period highlights the problem that pilots too often bump into things and the helicopter
is very unforgiving to such. The surface collision accidents are contained in the lower
30% ‘mixed-bag’ in Fig. 8.63, so details are unclear, but it is likely, based on more
dedicated studies (e.g., Ref. 8.4, 8.67), that the proportion in this category, where loss
of visual cues is a major factor, will be signiﬁcant.
The safety initiative referred to above, led by the International Helicopter Safety
Team (IHST), was launched at the AHS Safety Symposium in Montreal in September
2005 (Ref. 8.68), where a commitment was made to reduce the helicopter accident
rate by 80%, from 8.09 to 1.62 per 100 000 ﬂying hours, within 10 years. The activity
is being modelled on the US Commercial Aircraft Safety Team (CAST) programme,
which had set a similar goal for ﬁxed-wing aircraft accidents in the mid-1990s. While
it might seem unusual to describe such contemporary initiatives in a textbook, it is
considered by the author that this activity is vitally important to the helicopter industry
and to the theme of this chapter. IHST has deﬁned a three-stage process summarized
as follows: conduct data analysis, set safety priorities and integrate safety enhance-
ments. A substantial number of operators, regulators and manufacturers worldwide
have signed up to the master plan summarized in three components (Ref. 8.69):
‘IHST Mission: To provide government, industry and operator leadership to develop
and focus implementation of an integrated, data-driven strategy to improve
helicopter aviation safety worldwide, both military and civil
IHST Vision: To achieve the highest levels of safety in the international helicopter
communities by focusing on appropriate initiatives prioritized to result in the
greatest improvement in helicopter aviation safety
IHST Goal: To reduce the helicopter aviation accident rate by 80 percent by 2016’

The IHST was consolidated at the 62nd Annual Forum of the AHS in May 2006 (Ref.
8.69), where a number of participants reported on analysis conducted to date. Cross, in
Ref. 8.70, examined the potential impact on safety of various mitigating technologies,
noting that the airline industry had made signiﬁcant improvements in its safety record
through the introduction of, for example, damage-tolerant/fail-safe designs, extensive
use of simulators in ﬂight training, safety management systems and quality assurance to
reduce human errors, ﬂight data monitoring programs, disciplined take-off and landing
proﬁles (e.g., stabilized approach), digital ﬂight management systems to reduce pilot
workload, improved situational awareness, help to cope with emergencies, improved
one-engine-inoperative performance and various terrain/collision avoidance systems.
Speciﬁcally, Cross drew the conclusion that more than 50% of accidents were pre-
ventable with a combination of enhanced handling, conferred by meeting modern FAR
standards, and improved pilot training.
Handling qualities are central to both ﬂight performance and ﬂight safety and
much has been made of the trade-off between these twin goals in the design of air-
craft. Nowadays, the environmental impact and the economics of a system’s life cycle
introduce further constraints in the management of this trade-off. There is much to be
done, and much will no doubt be accomplished, in the relentless pursuit of perfection
in ﬂight.
Appendix 8A
Heliﬂight and Flightlab at the University
of Liverpool
In the production of this second edition, research results derived from the Univer-
sity of Liverpool’s motion simulator, HELIFLIGHT, and its simulation environment,
FLIGHTLAB, have been used extensively. This appendix provides an overview of the
facility; the material is derived largely from Ref. 8A.1.
The HELIFLIGHT facility can be described as a reconﬁgurable ﬂight simulator,
with six key components that are combined to produce a relatively high-ﬁdelity system,
including
(a)
interchangeable ﬂight dynamics modelling software (FLIGHTLAB), featuring
‘selective ﬁdelity’, e.g., different types of rotor wake model, with a real-time
interface, PilotStation;
(b)
6-DoF motion platform;
(c)
four-axis dynamic control loading;
(d)
three-channel collimated visual display system (135 × 40◦) plus two ﬂat panel chin
windows (60◦), each channel running its own visual database;
(e)
reconﬁgurable, computer-generated instrument display panel and heads-up-display
(HUD)
(f)
data record and time history capture facility.
A schematic of the HELIFLIGHT conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 8A.1.
The main host computer is a dual processor PC running Linux. One processor
runs FLIGHTLAB and PilotStation, whilst the second processor drives the control
loaders. In addition, this machine acts as both a ﬁle server and a server for other hosts.
The use of two Ethernet cards (one to access the Internet and the other to access the
HELIFLIGHT network via a hub) enables isolation of the local area network from the

Internet, maximizing throughput and security. There are seven other Windows-based
host computers running the motion base, the two chin windows, the three forward Out
the Window (OTW) displays and the instrument display. The HUD on the OTW centre
can be toggled on/off. All the Windows computers are equipped with graphics cards
that send signals to the cockpit displays, asynchronously. The keyboard and mouse of
each computer are also multiplexed, allowing each Windows computer to be controlled
from a single station.

Fig. 8A.2 Flight simulation laboratory at The University of Liverpool
The simulation laboratory has two main areas: the simulator control room and the
cockpit pod room. An authorized simulator operator controls the real-time operation of
the simulator from the main host running PilotStation in the control room and interacts
with the pilot in the cockpit room using a two-way communication system. From this
viewpoint, the operator can observe both the motion of the cockpit and also the displays
which are replicas of those present in the cockpit pod (Fig. 8A.2).
During a real-time session or ‘sortie’, the operator is responsible for ensuring
the safe operation of the motion base and can override a pilot’s inputs in the event of
loss of pilot control. A lap belt is worn by the pilot during a sortie and is part of the
safety interlock system that incorporates electromagnetic door releases on the gull wing
capsule door and a cockpit room door interlock. Emergency stop buttons are available
to both the pilot and the operator. In the case of an emergency or power failure, the
simulator parks, returning the capsule safely to its down position and the cockpit pod
door opens.
Throughout a sortie, a video/DVD record is taken of OTW centre, generating
both a visual and audio log of the mission for use in post-trial analysis. PilotStation
also has a data-logging function, allowing a range of aircraft performance parameters,
ﬂight model outputs and pilot control inputs to be captured for subsequent processing.
Using a computer image of the aircraft being ﬂown, ﬂights can later be reconstructed
from any viewing point.
Flightlab
The software at the centre of operation of the facility is FLIGHTLAB, a multi-body
modelling environment, providing a modular approach to the creation of ﬂight dynam-
ics models, including enabling the user to produce a complete vehicle system from
a library of pre-deﬁned components. In particular, FLIGHTLAB provides a range of
tools to assist in the rapid generation of nonlinear, multi-body models, signiﬁcantly
reducing the effort required for computer coding. Although FLIGHTLAB was origi-
nally developed for rotorcraft using blade element models, it can readily be used as a
simulation tool for ﬁxed-wing aircraft. For example, within the FLIGHTLAB library at
Liverpool are models of the Wright Flyers, Grob 115, X-29, Boeing 707/747, Jetstream
and Space Shuttle Orbiter.

 
602
Helicopter Flight Dynamics: Flying Qualities
To aid the generation and analysis of ﬂight models, three graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) are available: GSCOPE, FLIGHTLAB Model Editor (FLME) and Xanalysis.
A schematic representation of the desired model can be generated using a component-
level editor called GSCOPE. Components are selected from a menu of icons, which
are then interconnected to produce the desired architecture and data are assigned to
the component ﬁelds. When the representation is complete, the user selects the script
generation option and a simulation script in FLIGHTLAB’s Scope language is auto-
matically generated from the schematic. Scope is an interpretive language that uses
MATLAB syntax, together with new language constructs, for building and solving
nonlinear dynamic models.
FLME is a subsystem model editor allowing a user to create models from higher
level primitives such as rotors and airframes. Typically, a user will select and conﬁgure
the subsystem of interest by inputting data values and selecting options that deter-
mine the required level of sophistication. This approach provides a selective-ﬁdelity
modelling capability while maximizing computational efﬁciency. Models are created
hierarchically, with a complete vehicle model consisting of lower level subsystem mod-
els, which in turn are collections of primitive components. This is the Model Editor
Tree, which puts all the pre-deﬁned aircraft subsystems into a logical ‘tree’ structure.
This tool facilitates conﬁguration management by keeping all models in a pre-deﬁned
structure, while at the same time allowing the user ﬂexibility in deﬁning the individual
aircraft structure and subsystems.
Prior to running a real-time simulation, the model generated using the above
tools can be analysed using Xanalysis. This GUI has a number of tools allowing a
user to change model parameters and examine the dynamic response, static stability,
performanceandhandlingqualitiesofdesignalternatives.Additionaltoolsareavailable
to generate linear models with prescribed perturbation sizes, perform eigen-analyses,
time and frequency response analyses and control system design. The nonlinear model
may also be directly evaluated through utilities that support trim and time and frequency
response.
The real-time simulation is coordinated using PilotStation, which controls and
interfaces image generation for the OTW displays, instruments and the HUD with the
control loaders, motion base and ﬂight dynamics models generated using FLIGHT-
LAB, in real time. Typically, a helicopter simulation, with a four-bladed rotor and ﬁve
elements per blade, runs at 200 Hz. The frame time can be increased or decreased to
ensure optimized performance, taking account of model complexity (number of op-
erations per second) and the highest frequency modes (numerical stability). During
a simulation, a circular buffer is continuously updated containing pre-deﬁned output
variables. Selecting the History option makes the buffer accessible to the operator,
which can be plotted or saved for off-line analysis. The operator console can be used
to modify the vehicle conﬁguration and ﬂight condition and initiate faults or inputs
on-line, e.g., SCAS on/off, tail rotor failure, gusts.
Immersive cockpit environment
The ﬂight dynamics models are an important part of a ﬂight simulator and ultimately
deﬁne the ﬁdelity level of the simulation. Of equal importance is the environment into
which a pilot is immersed. HELIFLIGHT uses six-axis motion cueing together with

 
Degraded Flying Qualities
603
Fig. 8A.3 Collimated display system in the HELIFLIGHT
collimated displays and pilot control loaders to create a virtual ﬂying experience. A
pilot will derive information about the vehicle behaviour from a number of sources.
The basic mechanisms are visual perception, perception through the vestibular system
of the inner ears and perception through the proprioceptors distributed throughout the
body. Each of these mechanisms provides important information or ‘cues’ to the pilot.
Three collimated visual displays (Fig. 8A.3) are used to provide inﬁnity optics
for enhanced depth perception, which is particularly important for hovering and low-
speed ﬂying tasks. The displays provide 135◦horizontal by 40◦vertical ﬁeld of view,
extended to 60◦vertical ﬁeld of view using two ﬂat-screen displays in the foot-well
chin windows (Fig. 8A.4). The displays have a 1024 × 768 pixel resolution, refreshing
at 60 Hz giving good visual cues when displaying a texture-rich visual database (Fig.
8A.5).
The capsule has a main instrument panel that can be reconﬁgured to represent
displays from different aircraft presented on a ﬂat screen monitor. The ‘standard’ HUD
is displayed in OTW centre and contains an attitude indicator, vertical speed indicator,
airspeed and altitude indicator and has a ‘hover box’ to aid helicopter control at low
speed.
The sensation of motion is generated using the six-axis motion platform, with
movement envelope as given in Table 8A.1.
The electrically actuated motion platform has a position resolution of 0.6 µm.
The human visual system is relatively slow to detect changes in speed, compared with
the vestibular system, which is much quicker to react to accelerations. As a result,
certain tasks may be difﬁcult to perform without motion cues, in particular helicopter
hovering. To ensure that the pilot does not receive ‘false’ cues, the motion cueing
algorithms can be tuned to correspond with the desired vehicle performance and MTE
requirements. The parameters are accessible in a conﬁguration ﬁle, which can be made
aircraft speciﬁc. A major limitation with motion platforms is the stroke available.

To maximize the usable motion envelope, the drive algorithms features conventional
washout ﬁlters that return the simulator to its neutral position after a period of simulator
motion at low enough acceleration rates to minimize false cues.
Pilots can gain information about the behaviour of the aircraft by the feel and
position of the controls. HELIFLIGHT uses electric control loaders for the three pri-
mary pilot inceptors: cyclic, collective and pedals. The collective lever and cyclic stick
host several switches for various functions that can be reprogrammed or are directly

associated with PilotStation (e.g., run/pause, trim release). The HELIFLIGHT capsule
also contains two secondary controls – a joystick and a throttle lever. All the controls,
buttons and switches are conﬁgurable, e.g., the hat button on the cyclic controls nacelle
tilt in the FLIGHTLABXV-15 and the collective button conﬁgured as a brake for the
undercarriage wheels on ﬁxed-wing aircraft models. Digital control of the stick gra-
dient and control position is carried out with a resolution of 2.5 µm. Such accuracy
allows a pilot to utilize the force trim release feature to zero the control forces at the
trim position. The force feel characteristics are also reconﬁgurable through software
to represent an aircraft-speciﬁc control system.
Vibration and audio cues contribute to the realism of the simulation. Aircraft-
speciﬁc noise is played through two loudspeakers in the HELIFLIGHT cockpit to
provide audio cues to the pilot. Vibration can be detected directly through the motion
platform driven by variables in the model. A ‘low’ frequency audio actuator is mounted
under the ﬂoor of the capsule, directly beneath the pilot. This can transmit sounds of
frequency 20–100 Hz into the ﬂoor of the capsule to provide vibration or impact cues.
An important aspect of the overall ﬁdelity of the system is the amount of latency
present. The latency is produced by the transport delays in the transfer of information
between the various components of the simulator, from the control inputs to the ﬂight
model outputs through the motion base and the visual system to the pilot and back
through to the ﬂight model via the pilot’s controls. If the degree of latency is high,
the pilot is likely to notice a lag between an input control command and perceived
response of the system. This can seriously affect handling, particularly for precision-
tracking tasks. In HELIFLIGHT, the ﬂight dynamics model, running typically at 200
Hz,producesa5-msdelay.Adelayoflessthan16msoccursastheoutputfromtheﬂight
model is converted to produce a corresponding change in the simulator motion system.
The graphics cards receive a signal broadcast across the HELIFLIGHT network near

the start of each time frame. However, variable latency in the visuals occurs due to the
terrain texture density being displayed, which also varies with the speciﬁcation of the
graphics card. Currently, this causes delays of between 16 and 30 ms in the redrawing
of the terrain. In addition to this, the monitors are refreshing at 60 Hz. Finally, the
Loadcue feel system introduces a potential 5-ms delay into the system. With all these
contributions, the overall transport delay between pilot stick and motion base and visual
response is estimated to be below 50 ms.
The scope of activity undertaken on HELIFLIGHT over the ﬁrst 5 years of oper-
ation is documented in the wide range of journal and conference papers (Refs 8A.1–
8A.28). These publications give something of the ﬂavour of what can be achieved with
a research quality ﬂight simulator in the continuing development of ﬂight handling
qualities.
